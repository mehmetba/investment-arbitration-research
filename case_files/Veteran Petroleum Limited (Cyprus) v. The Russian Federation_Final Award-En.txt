INTRODUCTION

1. In February 2005, three controlling shareholders of OAO Yukos Oil Company (or
“Yukos”)—Hulley Enterprises Limited (“Hulley”), a company organized under the laws of
Cyprus, Yukos Universal Limited (“YUL”), a company organized under the laws of the Isle of
Man, and Veteran Petroleum Limited (“VPL”), a company organized under the laws of Cyprus
(collectively, “Claimants”)—initiated arbitrations against the Russian Federation

(“Respondent” or “Russia”), which together with Claimants constitute the “Parties.”

2. The three arbitrations were heard in parallel with the full participation of the Parties at all
relevant stages of the proceedings. Mindful of the fact that each of the three Claimants
maintains separate claims in separate arbitrations that require separate awards (the “Final
Awards”), the Tribunal nevertheless shall discuss these arbitrations as a single set of
proceedings, except where circumstances distinct to particular Claimants necessitate separate

treatment.

3. The Final Awards address: (a) those of Respondent’s objections to jurisdiction and admissibility
that remain to be decided after the Interim Awards on Jurisdiction and Admissibility of
30 November 2009 (the “Interim Awards”); (b) Claimants’ claims on the merits; and

(c) quantum.

4, By any standard, and as will be seen, these have been mammoth arbitrations. At the highest,
Claimants are claiming damages from Respondent of “no less than US$ 114.174 billion.”
Since February 2005, the Tribunal has held five procedural hearings with the Parties and issued
18 procedural orders. In the fall of 2008, the Tribunal held a ten-day hearing on jurisdiction
and admissibility in The Hague and, in November 2009, issued three Interim Awards, each over
200 pages. A twenty-one day Hearing on the Merits (or “Hearing”) took place in The Hague
from 10 October to 9 November 2012. The written submissions of the Parties span more than
4,000 pages and the transcripts of the hearings more than 2,700 pages. Over 8,800 exhibits
have been filed with the Tribunal.

Hulley Enterprises Limited v. The Russian Federation, PCA Case No. 226, Interim Award on Jurisdiction and
Admissibility, 30 November 2009 (hereinafter “Interim Award (Hulley)”); Yukos Universal Limited v. The Russian
Federation, PCA Case No. 226, Interim Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 30 November 2009 (hereinafter
“Interim Award (YUL)”); Veteran Petroleum Limited v. The Russian Federation, PCA Case No. 226, Interim Award
on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 30 November 2009 (hereinafter “Interim Award (VPL)”).

2? Claimants’ Reply on the Merits, 15 March 2012 4 1199(3) (hereinafter “Reply”).

  
 

The facts of this dispute have been the subject of attention in the media for more than a decade,
involving as they do, as central actors, Mr. Vladimir Putin, the President of the Russian
Federation, and a Russian “oligarch”, Mr. Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who, at the outset of the
dispute, was the principal shareholder and Chief Executive Officer of Yukos, then the largest

oil company in Russia and one of the largest oil companies in the world.

Throughout this lengthy and heavily contested arbitration, in circumstances that were often
trying and stressful, counsel for the Parties acted in a highly professional way. The Tribunal is
most grateful for their assistance. The Tribunal particularly acknowledges the grace and acuity
of the participation of Mr. Robert Greig, who was forced by ill health to retire in the midst of

the proceedings.

Having studied carefully the voluminous record of these three arbitrations, and having weighed
the arguments of the counsel who have so ably represented the Parties, the Tribunal is now

ready to deliver its Final Awards.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

The Interim Awards recount in detail the procedural history of the arbitrations from their
commencement up until the date those Awards were issued. The Tribunal has also issued
18 procedural orders, each of which contains a relevant procedural history. In this Part of the
Final Award, the Tribunal recalls only the key procedural details from the early phase of the

proceedings and summarizes developments since November 2009.

COMMENCEMENT OF THE ARBITRATION

On 2 November 2004, all three Claimants delivered to the President of Russia notifications of
claim with respect to Russia’s alleged violation of its obligations under the Energy Charter
Treaty (“ECT” or “Treaty”) and sought to settle the disputes amicably pursuant to
Article 26(1) of the ECT.’

Having failed to settle their disputes amicably within the three-month period prescribed under
Article 26(2) of the ECT, on 3 February 2005, Hulley and YUL initiated arbitration

proceedings through Notices of Arbitration and Statements of Claim against Respondent.

Energy Charter Treaty, Lisbon, 17 December 1994, 2080 UNTS 95 (hereinafter “ECT” or “Treaty”).

Subsequently, through a Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim dated 14 February 2005,
VPL initiated arbitration proceedings against Respondent. Claimants’ requests for arbitration
against Respondent were made pursuant to Article 26(4)(b) of the ECT and the Arbitration
Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, 1976 (“UNCITRAL
Rules”).

Claimants alleged that Respondent had expropriated and failed to protect Claimants’
investments in Yukos, resulting in “enormous losses,” and sought all available relief in respect

of those losses.

CONSTITUTION OF THE TRIBUNAL

The history of the constitution of the Tribunal is recounted in detail in the Interim Awards. The
Tribunal is composed of Judge Stephen M. Schwebel (appointed by Respondent on 8 April
2005), Dr. Charles Poncet (appointed as a replacement arbitrator by Claimants on 24 September
2007) and The Hon. L. Yves Fortier PC CC OQ QC (appointed as Chairman on 21 July 2005
by the agreed appointing authority, the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration
(“PCA”).

On | August 2005, the Parties agreed on The Hague as the legal seat of the arbitrations.

On 15 October 2005, Respondent submitted its Statements of Defense, in which it objected to
the Tribunal’s jurisdiction and denied Claimants’ allegations of expropriation and unfair and

inequitable treatment.

On 31 October 2005, a preliminary procedural hearing was held in The Hague, at which the
Parties and members of the Tribunal signed Terms of Appointment confirming, inter alia, that:
(a) the members of the Tribunal had been validly appointed in accordance with the ECT and the
UNCITRAL Rules; (b) the proceedings would be conducted in accordance with the
UNCITRAL Rules; (c) the International Bureau of the PCA would act as registry; (d) the
dispute would be decided in accordance with the ECT and applicable rules and principles of
international law; (e) the language of the arbitration would be English; and (f) all pleadings,
documents, testimonial evidence, deliberations and actions taken by the Tribunal would remain
confidential in perpetuity, unless the Parties were to release the arbitrators from this obligation.

The Tribunal also set a procedural calendar and determined that it would rule on Respondent’s

20.

21.

plea concerning jurisdiction and the admissibility of the claim as a preliminary question. The

calendar was confirmed in Procedural Order No. 1 on 8 November 2005.

PRELIMINARY PHASE ON JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY

Respondent filed its First Memorials on Jurisdiction and Admissibility on 28 February 2006
and Claimants filed their Counter-Memorials on Jurisdiction and Admissibility on 30 June

2006.

On 8 September 2006, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 dealing with document
production. The Tribunal invited the Parties to agree on whether requests relating to the
Parties’ respective “unclean hands” contentions and Respondent’s contention that the corporate
personality of Claimants “must be disregarded” because they are “an instrumentality of a
criminal enterprise” should be considered during the jurisdiction and admissibility phase or

deferred to the merits phase.

On 31 October 2006, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, in which it deferred
consideration of the Parties’ contentions concerning “unclean hands” and Respondent’s
“criminal enterprise” contention to the merits phase. On 3 November 2006, Claimants
submitted a stipulation of facts, and on 8 November 2006, Respondent submitted its

observations on the stipulation.

Between November 2006 and November 2008, the Tribunal issued six further procedural
orders relating to the conduct of the jurisdiction and admissibility phase of the arbitrations.
During this period the Parties exchanged two rounds of written submissions on jurisdiction and
admissibility, as well as Skeleton Arguments for the hearing. As noted in the Interim Awards,
the written record in the jurisdictional phase contained detailed and extensive filings of

hundreds of pages, accompanied by over a thousand exhibits and dozens of witness statements.

The hearing on jurisdiction and admissibility was conducted at the Peace Palace in

The Hague, from 17 to 21 November, 26 to 29 November and | December 2008.
On 30 November 2009, the Tribunal rendered the Interim Awards, stating in operative part:

For the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal:

  

(a) DISMISSES the objections to jurisdiction and/or admissibility based on
Article 1(6) and 1(7), Article 17, Article 26(3)(b)(i) and Article 45 of the
ECT;

 

22.

23.

24.

(b) DEFERS its decision on the objection to jurisdiction and/or admissibility
based on Article 21 of the ECT to the merits phase of the arbitration,
consistent with [paragraph numbers], above;

(c) CONFIRMS that its decision on the objections to jurisdiction and/or
admissibility involving the Parties’ contentions concerning “unclean hands”
and Respondent’s contention that “Claimant’s personality must be
disregarded because it is an instrumentality of a criminal enterprise” is
deferred to the merits phase of the arbitration, consistent with Procedural
Order No. 3;

(d) HOLDS that, subject to the preceding two sub-paragraphs, the present
dispute is admissible and within its jurisdiction, and that the Tribunal has
jurisdiction over the Russian Federation in connection with the merits of the
present dispute;

(ec) RESERVES all questions concerning costs, fees and expenses, including the
Parties’ costs of legal representation, for subsequent determination; and

(f) INVITES the Parties to confer regarding the procedural calendar for the
merits phase of the arbitration, and to report to the Tribunal in this respect
within 60 days of receipt of this Interim Award.

On 4 February 2010, Respondent wrote to the Tribunal “to protest Claimants’ counsel’s
publication of the [Interim Awards] in violation of applicable obligations,” noting that the

Interim Awards had appeared on various websites.

BIFURCATION AND OTHER SCHEDULING MATTERS

On 24 February 2010, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they disagreed as to whether or not
to bifurcate the proceedings between a liability and a damages phase, and as to the sequence
and timing of document production. Following an exchange of submissions on these issues, a

hearing was held at the International Dispute Resolution Centre in London on 7 May 2010.

The Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 10 on 13 May 2010, in which it: (a) decided that
documentary discovery would take place in a single phase, after the Parties’ first round of
written pleadings on the merits; (b) deferred the decision on bifurcation of the proceedings
between a liability and a quantum phase and on the issue of referral arising under Article 21 of
the ECT until after the Parties’ first round of written pleadings on the merits; and (c) fixed a
procedural calendar. The Tribunal specified that the Parties’ first round of written pleadings on
the merits was to address all issues, including the deferred preliminary questions, liability,
quantum and the issue of referral under Article 21 of the ECT. With respect to documentary
discovery, the Tribunal confirmed that some of its earlier rulings on requests relating to
“unclean hands” and “criminal enterprise” in the jurisdiction and admissibility phase had been

without prejudice to the Parties’ ability to restate one or more of these requests in the merits

phase. The Parties also agreed for each filing that they would submit one brief and one set of

exhibits for all three cases.

In accordance with Procedural Order No. 10 (as amended by the Tribunal on 23 June 2010),
Claimants filed their Memorial on the Merits (“Memorial”) on 16 September 2010. It spanned
424 pages and was accompanied by 1045 exhibits, nine witness statements and two expert
reports (with annexures). On 17 November 2010, further to a request by Respondent,
Claimants provided an electronic copy of the appendices to the report of Claimants’ damages

expert.

On 4 November 2010, Respondent informed the Tribunal that Baker Botts LLP was joining

Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP as Respondent’s counsel in these arbitrations.

Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on the Merits (“Counter-Memorial”) on 4 April 2011
and submitted a corrected version on 29 July 2011. The Counter-Memorial spanned 787 pages

and was accompanied by 2868 exhibits and eight expert reports (some with annexures).

On 29 April 2011, the Parties filed their respective submissions on the bifurcation of the
proceedings and the issue of referral arising under Article 21 of the ECT. A hearing on these

matters was held at the Church House Conference Centre in London on 9 May 2011.

On 31 May 2011, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 11, in which it: (a) denied
Respondent’s request that the proceedings be bifurcated between a liability and a damages
phase; (b) reserved its decision on referral under Article 21(5)(b)(i) of the ECT to a later stage
of the proceedings, when the evidentiary record would be completed; and (c) ordered the

Parties to proceed in accordance with the amended procedural calendar.

DOCUMENT PRODUCTION AND CONFIDENTIALITY

The Parties exchanged requests for documents on 17 June 2011 and the following month
exchanged objections and comments on objections to the document requests. Respondent also
requested an oral hearing on disclosure issues and repeated a request for more time to file its

Rejoinder.

On 11 August 2011, the Tribunal ruled on certain procedural aspects of document production

and the timing of submissions, and informed the Parties that it “considered then, as it does

today, that the Amended Procedural Calendar is in compliance with the requirement of due

process and equality between the parties taking into account all the circumstances.”

On 16 September 2011, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 12, in which it ruled on the
Parties’ document requests (with some rulings being “without prejudice” to a further decision

after the reply rounds of written submissions).

By letter of 23 September 2011, Respondent informed the Tribunal that the European Court of
Human Rights (“ECtHR”) had, on 20 September 2011, issued a judgment in OAO Neftyanaya
Kompaniya Yukos v. Russia (“ECtHR Yukos Judgment”),’ which addressed the “same

circumstances” on which Claimants’ claims in these arbitrations are based.

On 16 December 2011, Claimants produced documents pursuant to Procedural Order No. 12.
Respondent did not produce documents, but wrote to the Tribunal, expressing concern that
Claimants had provided no assurance that documents collected for disclosure would be kept
confidential and used only for the purposes of these arbitrations. Respondent requested the
Tribunal to issue a directive “requiring the Parties to protect the confidentiality of all
documents disclosed by the other, using them solely for purposes of these arbitrations.”
9g

Claimants objected to Respondent’s “eleventh hour” request for a confidentiality order.

On 19 December 2011, the Tribunal ordered Respondent to provide by the end of that day
documents to Claimants that had been ordered to be produced in Procedural Order No. 12,
requested written submissions on confidentiality and directed that until it decided the
confidentiality issue, the documents produced by both Parties were to remain confidential and
be used solely for purposes of these arbitrations. Pursuant to the Tribunal’s directive,

Respondent produced documents on 19 December 2011.

On 18 January and 2 February 2012, the Parties exchanged submissions on the scope of
confidentiality of the documents produced. From January to May 2012, the Parties exchanged

extensive correspondence concerning compliance with Procedural Order No.12.

On 27 February 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 13, in which it: (a) ordered
that all documents produced by a Party to the other Party and the Tribunal following an order of
the Tribunal “be and remain confidential in perpetuity” and “be used solely for the purpose of

OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya Yukos v. Russia, ECtHR, Appl. No. 14902/04, Judgment, 20 September 2011,

the pursuit or defense of these arbitrations and not for any other purpose;” (b) listed the persons
involved in these arbitrations to whom these documents could be disclosed; and (c) invited the
Parties to refrain from discussing these arbitrations in public in order not to exacerbate their

dispute or otherwise compromise the integrity of these arbitration proceedings.

Claimants filed their Reply on the Merits (“Reply”) on 15 March 2012. It spanned 474 pages

and was accompanied by a further 629 exhibits and two expert reports (with annexures).

On 30 April 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 14, granting some of
Respondent’s document production requests which had earlier been denied “without prejudice”
in Procedural Order No. 12. Claimants produced documents pursuant to Procedural Order No. 14
on 29 May 2012. On 29 June 2012, Respondent produced additional documents “in accordance
with the parties’ continuing obligation to disclose requ dd as they are di d”
under Procedural Order No. 12. Throughout June and July 2012, the Parties exchanged extensive

correspondence as to whether that was in violation of Procedural Order No. 12.

On 16 August 2012, Respondent filed its Rejoinder on the Merits (“Rejoinder”). It spanned

819 pages and was accompanied by 1739 exhibits and seven expert reports (with annexures).

HEARING ON THE MERITS

On 28 August 2012, a pre-hearing telephone conference took place during which the Parties
agreed on a number of issues, but disagreed on others. For example, Respondent requested that
the Tribunal set a deadline for the exchange between the Parties of witness “impeachment”
evidence prior to the Hearing on the Merits, while Claimants raised several “due process”
issues and requested permission to file written submissions in support of their requests. The

Parties then exchanged written comments on these issues.

By exchange of letters dated 10 September 2012, Claimants provided the names and order of
three Respondent witnesses they wished to cross-examine and Respondent advised the names

and order of ten of Claimants’ witnesses whom it wished to cross-examine.

On 12 September 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 15 dealing with logistical

and procedural issues for the Hearing on the Merits.

On 14 September 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 16, in which it determined

the outstanding procedural issues for the Hearing on the Merits, inter alia (a) denying

45.

46.

47.

48.

49.

Respondent’s requests relating to the exchange of “impeachment” evidence (noting that “in
international arbitration practice, documents used at an evidentiary hearing should generally be
submitted with the Parties’ written pleadings, in accordance with the established procedural
calendar”); and (b) granting Claimants permission to file certain documents that would

“complete the record” in relation to selected exhibits that Respondent had included in its

Rejoinder.

Claimants filed additional exhibits on 20 September 2012. On 25 September 2012, Respondent
objected to certain of these exhibits on the grounds that they exceeded the scope of Procedural
Orders No. 15 and 16. Following an exchange of views by the Parties, the Tribunal ruled on

Respondent’s objection in Procedural Order No. 17 dated 2 October 2012.

On 1 October 2012, the Parties submitted their respective Skeleton Arguments in aid of the

oral arguments to be presented at the Hearing on the Merits.

On 4 October 2012, Respondent advised that it no longer intended to cross-examine one of
Claimants’ tax law experts, Mr. Philip Baker QC. The same day Claimants withdrew the
witness statement of former Russian Prime Minister, Mr. Mikhail Kasyanov, which had been
submitted with the Memorial, on the ground that Mr. Kasyanov had informed Claimants’

counsel that “he will not appear at the hearing in these arbitrations.”

On 8 October 2012, Claimants advised that they no longer intended to cross-examine one of

Respondent’s tax law experts, Professor Rosenbloom.

The Hearing on the Merits took place at the Peace Palace, The Hague from 10 October to

9 November 2012. Over the course of the Hearing, the following were in attendance:

comments in response on 16 June 2014, and Respondent further commented on 20 June 2014.

On 27 June 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 18 in which it: (a) ordered that
these Final Awards remain confidential for a period of ten calendar days following electronic
dispatch to the Parties, after which period the PCA would post the Final Awards to its website
and so notify the Parties and the Tribunal, whereupon all confidentiality obligations in respect
of the Final Awards shall terminate; and (b) modified Procedural Order No. 13 to provide for

limited disclosure of documents in related proceedings.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

The disputes between the Parties to the present proceedings involve various measures taken by
Respondent against Yukos and associated companies primarily in the period between July 2003
and November 2007, when Yukos had emerged after the dissolution of the Soviet Union to
become the largest oil company in the Russian Federation. The measures complained of
include criminal prosecutions, harassment of Yukos, its employees and related persons and
entities; massive tax reassessments, VAT charges, fines, asset freezes and other measures
against Yukos to enforce the tax reassessments; the forced sale of Yukos’ core oil production
asset; and other measures culminating in the bankruptcy of Yukos in August 2006, the
subsequent sale of its remaining assets, and Yukos being struck off the register of companies in
November 2007. Claimants contend, and Respondent denies, that Respondent failed to treat
Claimants’ investments in Yukos in a fair and equitable manner and on a non-discriminatory
basis, in breach of Article 10(1) of the ECT, and that Respondent expropriated Claimants’
investments in breach of Article 13(1) of the ECT. Claimants seek full reparation in excess of

USD 114 billion.

The factual matrix of this case is complex. A detailed exposition of the relevant facts,
including specific references to the record, is set out for each part of the narrative in Part VIII
(broken down into eight chapters, starting with Yukos’ tax optimization scheme and the
Russian Federation’s tax assessments against Yukos and ending with the bankruptcy of Yukos
and the withdrawal of audit opinions by PricewaterhouseCoopers (“PwC”)). It is also in
Part VIII that the Tribunal makes determinations in respect of the many highly contested issues
of fact and observations on the significance of various facts and findings. By contrast, the
purpose of the introductory overview of the facts contained in this Part II of the Award is only

to provide sufficient background for what follows.

THE PARTIES TO THESE PROCEEDINGS

1. Claimants and Related Entities

The three Claimants in these related cases are all part of the Yukos group of companies, which

had at its center Yukos, headed by Chief Executive Officer Mr. Mikhail Khodorkovsky.

Claimant in PCA Case No. AA 226, Hulley, was incorporated in the Republic of Cyprus on
17 September 1997 and was a 100 percent owned subsidiary of YUL.

Claimant in PCA Case No. AA 227, YUL, was incorporated on 24 September 1997 in the Isle
of Man (a Dependency of the United Kingdom).

Claimant in PCA Case No. AA 228, VPL, was incorporated in the Republic of Cyprus on
7 February 2001.

Hulley held approximately 56.3 percent, YUL held approximately 2.6 percent and VPL held
approximately 11.6 percent of the outstanding shares in Yukos. Collectively therefore,

Claimants approximately had a 70.5 percent shareholding in Yukos.

2. Respondent

Respondent in these three arbitrations is the Russian Federation.

OAO YUKOS OIL COMPANY

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Yukos was incorporated as a joint stock company in

1993 by Presidential Decree. Fully privatized in 1995-1996, it was a vertically integrated

-13-

72.

73.

74,

75.

group engaging in exploration, production, refining, marketing and distribution of crude oil,
natural gas and petroleum products. Its three main production subsidiaries were

Yuganskneftegaz (“YNG”), Samaraneftegaz and, from 1997, Tomskneft.

In May 2002, Yukos became the first Russian company to be ranked among the top ten largest
oil and gas companies by market capitalization worldwide. In the fourth quarter of 2002,
Claimants submit that Yukos became the largest oil company in Russia in terms of daily crude

oil production.

At its peak in 2003, it had around 100,000 employees, six main refineries and a market
capitalization estimated at over USD 33 billion. According to Claimants, after its projected
2003 merger with then Russia’s fifth largest oil company Sibneft (“Sibneft”), YukosSibneft
would have become the fourth largest private oil producer worldwide, behind BP, Exxon and
Shell. At the time of Respondent’s alleged adverse actions in the summer of 2003, Yukos was
engaged in negotiations with ExxonMobil and ChevronTexaco for a merger or other form of
business combination. Claimants contend that this level of success was the result of efforts to
modernize Yukos’ operations and implement Western business practices. According to
Claimants, Yukos’ success and the increasing social and economic influence gained by its
management—including financial support given by Mr. Khodorkovsky to opposition parties—
were perceived as a political threat by the Russian authorities and accordingly Yukos would fall
from grace and be targeted for destruction. Respondent, however, contends that Yukos was a
“criminal enterprise”, engaged in a variety of tax evasion schemes and other fraudulent

activities.

THE RUSSIAN LOW-TAX REGION PROGRAM

The low-tax region program was established in the 1990s to foster economic development in
impoverished areas of the Russian Federation. The Russian low-tax regions were permitted to
exempt taxpayers from federal corporate profit tax for the purpose of fostering taxpayers’

investments in the low-tax regions, provided the taxpayer complied with certain requirements.
The Russian low-tax regions that are relevant to Yukos’ “tax optimization” scheme include:

. Closed Administrative Territorial Units (known as “ZATOs”): Lesnoy and

Trekhgorniy; and

. Other low-tax regions: Mordovia, Kalmykia and Evenkia.

-14-

76.

77.

78.

With respect to the tax benefits available in the ZATOs (Lesnoy and Trekhgorniy), in 1999, the
ZATOs were permitted to exempt taxpayers fully from federal corporate profit tax. In 2000,
most ZATOs were permitted to exempt taxpayers from the portion of the federal corporate
profit tax that was payable to their budget (e.g., up to 19 percent). In 2001, all ZATOs were
permitted to exempt taxpayers from the portion of the federal corporate profit tax that was
payable to their budget (e.g., also up to 19 percent). In 2002, however, these exemptions were

revoked.

With respect to the tax benefits available in other low-tax regions, in 2000 and 2001, Mordovia,
Kalmykia and Evenkia were permitted to exempt taxpayers fully from the portion of the federal
corporate profit tax that was payable to their budget (e.g., from up to 19 percent to zero
percent). From | July 2002 until 31 December 2003, low-tax regions were permitted to exempt
taxpayers from the portion of the federal corporate profit tax payable to their budget, but only
up to four percent. An exception existed for ‘grandfathered’ tax investment agreements entered
into prior to 1 July 2001, such that these taxpayers could still receive a zero percent profit tax
rate if they fulfilled certain other conditions. As of 1 January 2004, the existing tax investment
agreements were terminated, but the Tax Code of the Russian Federation (the “Russian Tax
Code”) still allowed low-tax regions to reduce the federal corporate profit tax payable to their

budget up to four percent.

Respondent contends that Yukos’ restructuring of its trading operations from high-tax
jurisdictions, such as Moscow and Nefteyugansk, to trading companies incorporated in the low-
tax jurisdictions of Lesnoy, Trekhgorny, Mordovia, Kalmykia and Evenkia was aimed at
evading taxes, rather than to achieve any genuine economic result. Respondent alleges that
Yukos interposed between Yukos and its customer its “sham” trading shells registered in
Russian low-tax regions. Yukos’ oil producing subsidiaries sold the extracted oil to the trading
companies at a fraction of the market price. The trading companies then sold the oil either
abroad at a market price or to Yukos’ refineries, and subsequently re-bought it at a reduced
price and re-sold it at the market price. Respondent asserts that prices increased step by step
from sham shell to sham shell, generating artificially inflated profits through non-armslength
transactions. Those profits were then taxed at reduced rates in the low-tax regions, where the
sham trading shells were registered. Respondent contends that the tax authorities identified
abuses by the Lesnoy trading shells, which resulted in further investigations and, ultimately, in

the tax assessments against Yukos and related proceedings.

-15-

81.

82.

83.

Claimants contend that Yukos, like other Russian companies at that time, was merely taking
advantage of the legislation in place in the low-tax regions. Claimants assert that any findings
of “abuse” by the Russian tax authorities was a function of the arbitrary and unpredictable

interpretations of the law in Russia.

The details of the Russian low-tax region program and Yukos’ tax optimization scheme are set

out more comprehensively in Chapter VIII.A of this Award.

CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS

Starting in July 2003, a series of criminal investigations were initiated by the Russian
Federation against Yukos management and activities. According to Claimants, these actions
included the “targeting” of Yukos’ employees, auditor PwC, in-house counsel, lawyers
involved in various Yukos-related cases, as well as searches and seizures, threats to revoke its
oil licenses, and mutual legal assistance requests and extradition proceedings against Yukos
management. Claimants characterize these actions as harassment, motivated by
Mr. Khodorkovsky’s participation in Russian opposition politics, that were intended—together
with tax reassessments—to lead to the expropriation of Yukos’ assets. Respondent contends
that its actions were in response to illegal acts committed by Yukos and its officers and

shareholders.

Between July and October 2003, three key Yukos officers were arrested. In July 2003,
Mr. Platon Lebedev, Director of Hulley and YUL, was arrested on charges of embezzlement
and fraud; he was sentenced to nine years in prison in May 2005. In October 2003, Mr. Vasily
Shakhovsky, President of Yukos-Moscow, was charged with and later convicted of tax evasion.
In October 2003, Mr. Khodorkovsky himself was arrested and charged with crimes including
forgery, fraud and tax evasion; he was also sentenced to a nine-year prison term in May 2005.
As a result of these arrests, a number of high-ranking Yukos executives fled Russia, such as
Mr. Leonid Nevzlin, Deputy Chairman of the Yukos Board of Directors until 2003. On
2 February 2007, new charges of embezzlement and money laundering were brought against
Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev, leading to further convictions in December 2010.

Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev were each imprisoned for over a decade.

Claimants contend that by April 2006, no fewer than 35 top managers and employees of Yukos
had been interrogated, arrested or sentenced, and that lawyers acting for Yukos had been

obstructed in their work. During the same period, Russian authorities conducted searches,

-16-

84.

85.

86.

87.

88.

seizures and interrogations of Yukos property and personnel. Claimants contend that all of
these actions amounted to harassment and intimidation, that they deprived Yukos’ management
of the ability to manage and control Yukos as a business, and that the underlying motive was to

expropriate Yukos’ assets.

Respondent contends that in addition to participation in tax fraud schemes, Yukos participated
in a massive transfer pricing scheme by which hundreds of millions of dollars from the sales of
oil and other products were illegally siphoned off to offshore entities for the benefit of
Khodorkovsky/Lebedev and other controlling Russian “Oligarchs”.°

Respondent also contends that Yukos officials have been engaged in violent crimes, such as the
murder, attempted murder and assault of persons seeking to enforce Russian tax laws or
otherwise perceived to threaten Yukos interests. Claimants deny Respondent’s allegations of

criminal acts as well as acts of tax evasion.

Respondent denies that Yukos and its officers were targeted in a discriminatory way,
contending that Russian taxation measures have also applied to other offenders and that the
searches and seizures were taken as part of legitimate taxation measures and conducted in
accordance with normal Russian practice and the appropriate procedural protections available

under Russian law.

The particulars of Claimants’ allegations concerning harassment, intimidation and arrests are

presented in Chapter VIII.C of this Award.

ADDITIONAL MEASURES

In the period between October 2003 and December 2004, Yukos and its subsidiaries faced a
series of major setbacks, including the alleged frustration of its merger with Sibneft, hefty tax
reassessments, fines, VAT exactions, the freezing of shares and assets, the threatened
revocation of licenses, and the forced sale of Yukos’ main oil production subsidiary, YNG.

These measures were followed by the bankruptcy of Yukos in August 2006.

Respondent’s Counter-Memorial on the Merits dated 4 April 2011, as corrected 29 July 2011, p.1 n.1 (hereinafter
“Counter-Memorial”): Respondent employs the term “Oligarchs” throughout its pleadings to refer to
s. Khodorkovsky, Lebedev, Nevzlin, Dubov, Brudno, Shakhnovsky, Golubovitch; the individual owners
standing behind Claimants (hereinafter the “Oligarchs”).

1. Alleged Frustration of Merger Between Yukos and Sibneft

In October 2003, a merger was about to be completed between Yukos and Sibneft, Russia’s
fifth largest oil company. According to Claimants, the resulting entity, YukosSibneft, would
have become the world’s fourth largest oil company. In November 2003, however, after Yukos
had already acquired 92 percent of Sibneft’s shares as part of the merger and after the arrest of
Mr. Khodorkovsky, Sibneft’s controlling shareholder, Mr. Roman Abramovich, called off the
merger process and the transactions were then unwound by a series of court decisions. Further

details are included in Chapter VIII.D of this Award.

2. Tax Reassessments for Years 2000-2004

On 28 April 2003, the Tax Ministry issued a Field Tax Audit Report for the years 2000 and
2001 that raised no questions concerning Yukos’ tax optimization structure. On 1 September,
1 October and 1 November 2003, the Tax Ministry issued certificates confirming that Yukos
had no outstanding debts.

On 8 December 2003, the Tax Ministry ordered a tax re-audit of Yukos for the year 2000. On
29 December 2003, the tax authorities of the Russian Federation issued the first of five tax
assessments against Yukos that were based on the alleged abuse by Yukos of its tax

optimization scheme.

The Tax Ministry demanded payment from Yukos for approximately USD 3.5 billion for 2000,
which was largely upheld by the Moscow Arbitrazh Court. Similarly large tax reassessments
were issued in the period between 2004 and 2006 for subsequent tax years. 2001 taxes were
re-assessed in the amount of approximately USD 4.1 billion, 2002 taxes in the amount of
approximately USD 6.8 billion, 2003 taxes in the amount of approximately USD 6.1 billion,
and 2004 taxes in the amount of approximately USD 3.7 billion. By the time the Tax Ministry
issued the last of these demands, Yukos faced a tax bill of more than USD 24 billion, of which
approximately USD 10.6 billion constituted allegedly evaded revenue-based taxes (including
interest and fines), and the remainder (approximately USD 13.6 billion) comprised of VAT and

related, interest and fines.

Respond ds that the r were a q of Yukos’ activities relating to

the tax fraud scheme. Claimants submit, however, that the reassessments were so excessive

that the Russian authorities’ strategy of destroying Yukos became plain.

99.

At the same time that tax reassessments were being filed against Yukos and its subsidiaries,
Russian authorities began freezing shares and other assets belonging to Yukos and related
entities. In October 2003, Russian prosecutors froze shares held by YUL and Hulley in
Yukos. Orders issued by the Moscow Arbitrazh Court in April and June 2004 prevented
Yukos from disposing of its assets. An application by Yukos in July 2004 to have
sufficient assets released to meet its tax liabilities was ignored and a surcharge of
approximately USD 240 million was applied for late payment of taxes. Claimants also
maintain that Yukos’ numerous proposals throughout this period to settle the tax claims were
ignored or rejected by the Russian authorities, despite the fact that the government settled with

taxpayers in several other cases.

In July 2004, Russian authorities began seizing Yukos’ shares in YNG, Samaraneftegaz and
Tomskneft. YNG bank accounts were also frozen. The Russian authorities also used mutual

legal assistance treaties to affect Yukos’ interests abroad.

Respondent does not dispute the freezing of Yukos’ assets but contends that freezing assets of a
debtor, including shares owned by it, is a standard enforcement measure for tax levies and
judgments. Respondent maintains that its freezing orders did not cover all of the assets of

Yukos in Russia and that Yukos remained in possession of large assets abroad.

The details of the tax assessments against Yukos and of Yukos’ attempts to settle the tax claims

are set out in Chapters VIII.B and VIII-E, respectively.

3. Auction of YNG

In July 2004, the Russian Federation indicated that it intended to appraise and sell YNG to pay
off Yukos’ back taxes. A valuation carried out by investment bank ZAO Dresdner Bank
(“Dresdner”) at the request of the Russian Federation valued YNG at between USD 15.7
billion and USD 18.3 billion. A valuation carried out by JP Morgan, at the request of Yukos,
valued YNG at between USD 16 billion and USD 22 billion. The Russian Ministry of Justice
announced that YNG was worth USD 10.4 billion.

After Yukos’ attempts to enjoin the sale of YNG by legal recourse in the United States failed,
YNG was sold at auction on 19 December 2004 for USD 9.37 billion to sole bidder and newly
incorporated entity, Baikal Finance Group (“Baikal”), which was quickly bought by Russian
State-owned Rosneft (“Rosneft”).

4, Bankruptcy Proceedings

Claimants allege that the Russian Federation first reported in March 2005 that it intended to
“push Yukos into bankruptcy in order to redistribute its remaining assets.” On 6 March 2006, a
syndicate of foreign bank creditors of Yukos filed a bankruptcy petition before the Moscow
Arbitrazh Court, pursuant to a Confidential Sale Agreement with Rosneft (the “Confidential
Sale Agreement”). YNG—then owned by Rosneft—filed a separate bankruptcy petition
against Yukos, which was subsequently joined to that of the bank syndicate. On 28 March
2006, bankruptcy proceedings were commenced against Yukos, placing it under external

supervision, and on 4 August 2006, Yukos was declared bankrupt.

Yukos’ remaining assets were nearly all acquired by State-owned Gazprom and Rosneft, with
the bankruptcy auctions raising a total of USD 31.5 billion. In November 2007, Yukos was

liquidated and struck off the register of legal entities.

The specifics relating to Yukos’ bankruptcy are set out in Chapter VIII.G of this Award.

5. Withdrawal of PwC’s Audits

In June 2007, PwC (which had served as both auditor and consultant to Yukos starting in 1997)
withdrew all of its audits of Yukos from 1995 to 2004.

This final aspect of the factual matrix is treated in detail in Chapter VIII.H of this Award.

PARTIES’ WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS

As indicated in the Procedural History above, the Parties submitted two rounds of memorials on
the merits. Each side took full advantage of the written phase of these proceedings, filing
detailed and extensive written submissions. Claimants’ Memorial runs to 424 pages and was
accompanied by 1045 exhibits and 12 witness statements. Respondent’s Counter-Memorial is
787 pages long, and was accompanied by 2868 exhibits and 8 witness statements. Claimants’
Reply runs to 474 pages, and was accompanied by over 600 further exhibits. Finally,
Respondent’s Rejoinder runs to 819 pages, and was submitted with over 1700 further exhibits

and seven witness statements. The Parties filed Post-Hearing Briefs of over 100 pages.

Throughout the arbitration the Parties filed extensive written submissions on various procedural

issues.

The Tribunal studied these submissions carefully. The Parties’ principal arguments are
re-stated in the Tribunal’s analysis of the issues in Parts VIII to XIII below. For the purposes
of introduction, the Tribunal reproduces below verbatim the written “skeleton arguments” that

the Parties submitted prior to the Hearing on the Merits at the Tribunal’s request.

CLAIMANTS’ SKELETON ARGUMENTS

The text of the paragraphs below is produced directly from paragraphs | to 82 of Claimants’
Skeleton Argument submitted on 1 October 2012 (““Claimants’ Skeleton”)( footnotes omitted).

L INTRODUCTION

1. The dispute between the Parties arises from the various actions taken by the Russian
Federation against Yukos Oil Company (“Yukos” or the “Company”) and related
persons and entities, which culminated in the expropriation of the Company for the
exclusive benefit of the Russian State and State-owned entities, thereby destroying
the Claimants’ investments in Yukos. As the Claimants have demonstrated, by
(i) failing to treat the Claimants’ investments in Yukos in a fair and equitable
manner and on a non-discriminatory basis, and (ii) expropriating the Claimants’
investments therein, the Russian Federation breached its obligations under Articles
10(1) and 13(1) of the Energy Charter Treaty (“ECT”), respectively, for which the
Claimants are entitled to full reparation.

2. The Claimants’ positions on the merits are described in detail in their written
submissions. This skeleton argument summarizes, for the benefit of the Tribunal,
the Claimants’ principal arguments, with reference to key supporting materials. It
does not replace or supplement those submissions, nor is it a substitute for oral
argument.

I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

3. The various actions taken by the Russian Federation against Yukos, and related
persons and entities, were aimed at the destruction and expropriation of the
Company. The expropriation of Yukos was achieved in 3 overlapping steps: first,
the paralysis of the Company (A); second, the manufacturing of a pretext for the
taking of the Company’s assets, namely, the fabrication of debt (B); finally, the use
of that pretext to take Yukos’ assets piece by piece, including its most valuable
asset, Yuganskneftegaz, and transfer them to the State-owned companies Rosneft
and Gazprom (C). Each of these steps was accompanied by serious due process
violations. The result was the liquidation of Yukos in November 2007, and the
complete and total deprivation of the Claimants’ investments therein.

A. PARALYSIS OF YUKOS

4. Prior to the Russian Federation’s attack, Yukos was a flourishing oil company. In
May 2002, it was the only Russian company to be ranked among the top 10 largest
oil and gas companies by market capitalization worldwide. In the fourth quarter of
2002, it became the largest oil company in Russia in terms of daily crude oil
production. In October 2003, it completed its merger with Sibneft, another of

-21-

Russia’s leading oil companies, creating the world’s fourth largest private oil
producer, behind BP, ExxonMobil and Shell. Yukos was also engaged in advanced
discussions with American oil majors, ExxonMobil and ChevronTexaco, in relation
to a merger or other form of business combination. This success was the result of
concerted efforts to modernize the Company and implement Western business
practices.

Starting in the summer of 2003, the Russian Federation took a series of actions
aimed at undermining the ability of the Company’s management to run the
business. These included: (i) the arrests of Messrs. Lebedev and Khodorkovsky,
Yukos’ CEO; (ii) the targeting, intimidation and/or prosecution of other high-
ranking Yukos managers, employees and related persons; (iii) the harassment,
prosecution and/or arrest of Yukos’ in-house counsel and lawyers involved in
various Yukos-related cases; (iv) the conduct of widespread and aggressive searches
and seizures; (v) the seizure of the Claimants’ shares in Yukos; (vi) the threats to
revoke Yukos’ oil licenses; (vii) the numerous mutual legal assistance requests and
extradition proceedings to affect Yukos and entities/persons associated with the
Company abroad; and (viii) the targeting and harassment of Yukos’ auditor, PwC.
These actions were taken in violation of the most basic standards of due process and
fair treatment.

  

Contrary to the Respondent’s allegations, the actions described above deprived
Yukos’ management of the ability to manage and control the Company, thereby
facilitating its dismantling and ultimate destruction. One early casualty of the
Russian Federation’s attack on Yukos was the YukosSibneft merger.

MANUFACTURING A PRETEXT — THE FABRICATION OF DEBT

1. The fabrication of massive tax claims against Yukos for the years 2000-2004

In December 2003, the Russian Federation’s campaign against Yukos entered into a
new phase with the fabrication of massive tax claims against the Company.

On December 8, 2003, 6 weeks after Mr. Khodorkovsky’s arrest, the Tax Ministry
ordered a tax re-audit of Yukos for the year 2000. Only 3 weeks later, it issued a
Field Tax Audit Report exceeding 100 pages in length and proposing to collect
from Yukos US$ 3.4 billion in alleged tax arrears, interest and fines on the
purported basis that the use of regional tax incentives by Yukos trading companies
constituted unlawful tax evasion by Yukos itself.

The December 2003 re-audit of Yukos was extraordinary in many respects. Less
than 8 months earlier, on April 28, 2003, the Tax Ministry had issued a Field Tax
Audit Report for the years 2000 and 2001 that raised no questions concerning
Yukos’ tax optimization structure. That audit had taken 5 months to conduct,
followed by 2 months for drafting the report. On several occasions after this audit,
including on September 1, October 1 and November 1, 2003, the Tax Ministry
confirmed that Yukos had no outstanding tax debts. Prior tax audits of the
Mordovian trading companies likewise raised no major concerns and specifically
found their use of regional tax incentives to be lawful.

The Respondent alleges that the Russian authorities lacked knowledge of Yukos’
tax optimization structure and only “discovered” its allegedly abusive features in the
course of the 3-week audit carried out in December 2003. This allegation is not
credible. As the record demonstrates, the Russian authorities had long been aware
of Yukos’ practices, and the Respondent has failed to identify a single piece of
material information relevant to the alleged tax claims that it lacked prior to the
December 2003 repeat audit. In particular:

-22-

 

* Yuko was one of Russia’s largest taxpayers and was therefore under constant
scrutiny by the Russian tax authorities, who had never found any significant
problems prior to the attack on Yukos.

* The use of trading companies incorporated in low-tax regions was a common
practice among Russia’s vertically integrated oil companies, a fact that was well
known to Russian authorities.

= Several trading companies’ affiliations with Yukos were reflected in their
names, for instance, Yukos-M and Yu-Mordovia.

* Prior to using trading companies in Mordovia—the source of the overwhelming
majority of the purported tax claims—Yukos discussed the issue with federal
and regional officials, who approved Yukos’ plan. Mordovia’s Government
then signed investment agreements with these trading companies specifying the
amounts of monthly payments. Audits of the Mordovian trading companies
confirm the tax authorities’ knowledge of the factual circumstances later alleged
to constitute “abuse”.

* As the Respondent concedes, Yukos’ financial statements disclosed that
companies within Yukos’ consolidation perimeter enjoyed tax benefits under the
low-tax region program and the overall amounts of such benefits.

* VAT refund submissions documented the entire chain of transactions prior to
export, including, in particular, the trading companies’ transactions with Yukos’
production companies, refineries, and the holding company.

*  Yukos’ monthly submissions to obtain access to export pipelines confirmed that
the trading companies’ tax payments were in relation to the trading of oil
produced by Yukos’ production subsidiaries and exported under Yukos’ export
quotas.

The Tax Ministry went on to fabricate similar tax claims against Yukos covering the
years 2001-2004. As discussed below, the timing of these claims was instrumental
in carrying out the Russian Federation’s expropriation plan. By the time the Tax
Ministry issued the last of these demands, Yukos faced a tax bill of more than US$
24 billion, of which only US$ 5.2 billion constituted allegedly evaded revenue-
based taxes, the remainder being comprised of VAT, interest, and fines. These
payment demands dwarfed the Company’s consolidated net income for the relevant
periods.

 

2. The purported tax claims were unprecedented, arbitrary and manifestly
expropriatory

Purported bases for revoking regional profit tax incentives. Yukos’ tax optimization
structure fully complied with the legislation in force and current practices. Indeed,
the Respondent does not allege that Yukos or the trading companies failed to
comply with the federal or regional legislation. Nor does it allege that the trading
companies failed to fulfill the terms of the investment agreements signed with the
regional governments. Rather, it claims that the trading companies failed to satisfy
additional, unwritten requirements beyond the statutory cligibility criteria,
including, in particular, an alleged “proportionality of investments” requirement that
directly icted both the legislation and the i signed by
the regional governments. This justification is not credible.

 

Re-attribution. The primary weapon in the expropriation of Yukos’ assets was the
reattribution of the alleged tax liabilities of the trading companies to Yukos. Russian
law did not allow such re-attribution, and the Respondent cannot point to a single
example of such a re-attribution other than the Yukos case. Had the Russian
authorities genuinely believed that the tax benefits had been improperly granted to
the trading companies, which was not the case, the proper course under Russian law

  

-23-

would have been to pursue those companies for the allegedly underpaid taxes.
Alternatively, had they genuinely believed that sales had occurred at below market
prices, Russian tax law contained a specific statutory mechanism for such transfer-
pricing situations. However, the Russian authorities ignored these statutory
provisions. Re-attribution served 2 purposes: first, shifting liability to Yukos itself
paved the way for the expropriation of the Company’s assets; second, re-attribution
provided the basis for massive VAT claims.

 

VAT. Simultaneously invoking and contradicting their own re-attribution theory, the
tax authorities re-attributed to Yukos all the revenues from the trading companies’
transactions, but refused to re-attribute to Yukos the trading companies’
entitlements to VAT refunds for export transactions. The purported basis for
denying refunds was that the paperwork, although proper and timely, had been
submitted by the trading companies rather than Yukos. This enabled the tax
authorities to claim an additional US$ 13.59 billion—56.20% of the total claims
against Yukos—despite the uncontested fact that no VAT was owed on these
transactions. Such a step was clearly confiscatory in nature. Further, the fact that,
even when Yukos attempted to submit the updated VAT returns in its own name, its
submissions were rejected as improper and untimely, confirms that the purported
VAT claims had nothing to do with taxation. The Respondent has been unable to
offer any defense whatsoever for the fundamentally contradictory way in which its
re-attribution theory was deployed.

Fines. The tax authorities further inflated their claims through the unjustified
imposition of fines, including by imposing fines after the statute of limitations had
expired; by doubling fines for “willfulness” despite the fact that Yukos did not—and
could not possibly—know” of the alleged illegality; and by doubling fines again
for “repeat offenses” despite the fact that at the time of the alleged “repeat” offenses
Yukos had never been previously held liable for a similar offense. Overall, these
inflated fines amounted to USS 8.5 billion, ie., 35.13% of the total alleged tax
liabilities, with the “repeat” offender fines alone amounting to US$ 3.92 billion.

The common thread unifying the Russian Federation’s approach was an overarching
desire to manufacture and inflate claims against Yukos, with a view to expropriating
the Company. As Yukos’ tax lawyer noted after reviewing the December 2003 audit
report, “[e]ven if we assume political pressure on the court the extent of the
violations committed by the Ministry for Taxes and Levies will make it impossible
even for the most biased judge to support the clearly unlawful inspection act”. The
Russian courts proved Yukos’ tax lawyer wrong, rubber-stamping the fabricated tax
debts.

3. Due process violations in the administrative and judicial proceedings

The administrative and judicial proceedings with respect to the alleged tax debts
were conducted in blatant disregard of Yukos’ basic due process rights. This
involved, inter alia, pressure on the courts to ensure that only Government-friendly
judges would preside over Yukos’ challenges—and subsequently rewarding those
judges for their efforts; overly speedy proceedings, denying Yukos adequate time
and facilities to prepare its defense; and arbitrary denials of Yukos’ motions to join
to the dings the trading ies and the ian Gi . Coupled
with the harassment of Yukos’ lawyers noted above, the Russian Federation ensured
the hasty conclusion of these proceedings, bringing it one step closer to its
objective, namely the taking of Yukos’ assets.

APPROPRIATION OF YUKOS’ ASSETS — SEIZING YUKOS’ ASSETS AND
TRANSFERRING THEM TO STATE-OWNED COMPANIES

1. Yukos was prevented from settling its alleged tax debts or discharging them
in full

The swift and manifestly disproportionate enforcement of the 2000 tax
reassessment. On April 14, 2004, the tax authorities issued their payment demands
for the year 2000. Yukos was given until April 16, 2004, i.e., less than 48 hours, to
pay in full US$ 3.48 billion in alleged tax arrears, interest and fines.

Even this symbolic “voluntary” payment period was illusory. On April 15, 2004, the
very next day after the demand for payment was issued, the tax authorities obtained
from the Moscow Arbitrazh Court an ex parte injunctive order freezing, as a
purported security measure, all of Yukos’ non-cash Russian assets, with the
exception of oil and oil products.

 

On June 30, 2004, following Yukos’ unsuccessful appeal, an enforcement writ was
issued giving the Tax Ministry 3 years to collect the 2000 tax debt. Rather than
engage in discussions with the Company about the discharge of this debt within that
period, the bailiffs initiated enforcement proceedings that very same day. The
Company was given 5 days to pay voluntarily US$ 3.42 billion in alleged tax
arrears, interest and fines for the year 2000 and threatened with a 7% enforcement
fee if it failed to do so.

  

  
  

At the same time, the bailiffs ordered the seizure of (i) monies deposited in Yukos’
accounts with 16 Russian banks, and (ii) the Company’s Russian non-cash assets
(which had previously been the subject of a freeze). On July 1, 2004, a wave of
seizures on Yukos’ non-monetary assets began, culminating in the seizure on July
14, 2004 of Yukos’ shares in its 3 main production subsidiaries—Yuganskneftegaz,
Samaraneftegaz and Tomskneft.

It should be recalled that all these seizures were conducted within the framework of
the enforcement proceeding initiated on June 30, 2004 to recover from Yukos USS
3.42 billion in alleged tax liabilities for 2000. These seizures covered virtually all of
Yukos’ assets, whose value was staggeringly higher.

Further, within days, on July 20, 2004, the Ministry of Justice announced its
intention to appraise and sell Yuganskneftegaz to satisfy the 2000 alleged tax debt.

The decision to seize and sell Yuganskneftegaz, which accounted for approximately
12% of Russia’s oil output and whose value on any estimation dramatically
exceeded that of the alleged tax debt, can only be reconciled with a desire to destroy
the Company and appropriate its core assets. This reality is confirmed by the fact
that the decision was taken less than 3 weeks after the writ of execution had been
issued and when all of Yukos’ domestic assets remained seized and available to
satisfy the 2000 tax debt.

The failure to consider Yukos’ proposals of alternative means of paying the alleged
debt. Further confirmation of the Russian Federation’s expropriatory intent is the
systematic rejection of Yukos’ numerous offers to the bailiffs, courts and other
Russian authorities and officials to settle or discharge its tax debts. These included:
(i) the offers of Yukos’ Russian non-core assets and its stake in Sibnefft, initially
34.5% and subsequently reduced to 20% minus 1 share following the seizure of the
14.5% stake in Sibneft on July 9, 2004, in the context of the Chukotka Arbitrazh
Court proceedings; (ii) Yukos” petition to pay its alleged tax debt for the year 2000
in installments; (iii) Yukos’ amicable proposal to the Ministry of Finance to defer
the payment of the federal share of its alleged debt for 6 months or to pay it in
tranches; (iv) the proposals by Mr. Jean Chrétien, former Canadian Prime Minister,
to Prime Minister Fradkov and President Putin of a global settlement of the

 

-25-

disputes, which envisaged the payment to the Russian Federation of approximately
USS 8 billion over the course of 2 years; (v) Yukos’ October 2004 full settlement
proposal in the range of USS 21 billion, which included non-core assets and Sibneft
shares, as well as a concession to re-elect a new board of directors that would
include people selected by the Government.

Each of these offers, as well as numerous others, was either denied or, in most
cases, simply ignored. The Respondent's attempts to provide post-hoc
rationalizations for its conduct by qualifying each of Yukos’ offers as unacceptable
or inadequate are unfounded. In any event, the Russian authorities’ failure to work
with—or even respond to—the multiple offers by Yukos, one of the largest private
taxpayers in Russia, or to consider other options for enforcement, confirms that the
Russian Federation was not interested in collecting taxes. This is even more so in
light of the fact that the Russian authorities had no difficulty entering into settlement
discussions and negotiating repayment plans with other Russian oil companies,
including, inter alia, Rosneft and Sibneft.

2. The forced sale of Yukos’ shares in Yuganskneftegaz

Fabrication of further debt to maintain the pretext. Despite the effect of the seizures
described above, by the time of the Yuganskneftegaz auction, Yukos had paid off
the 2000 tax reassessment in its entirety, eliminating the raison d’étre of the
decision to sell Yuganskneftegaz. Recognizing this difficulty as well as the gross
disparity between the alleged tax debts and the value of Yuganskneftegaz, the Tax
Ministry set about fabricating new claims.

= On September 2, 2004, the Tax Ministry served Yukos with a tax
reassessment for 2001 in the amount of US$ 4.1 billion. Yukos was given
only 2 days to pay voluntarily this amount, with the bailiffs initiating
enforcement proceedings on September 9, 2004.

= On November 16, 2004, the Tax Ministry served Yukos with a tax
reassessment for 2002 in the amount of US$ 6.76 billion, the largest among
the 5 tax reassessments for the years 2000-2004. Yukos was given only I day
to pay voluntarily this amount, with the bailiffs initiating enforcement
proceedings on November 18, 2004.

= On December 6, 2004, the Tax Ministry served Yukos with a tax reassessment
for 2003 in the amount of US$ 6.1 billion, giving the Company | day to pay in
fall. On December 9, 2004, the bailiffs initiated enforcement proceedings.

 

In cach case, the bailiffs allowed Yukos at most 5 days for voluntary payment and
charged the 7% enforcement fee for failure to comply with these unreasonably short
time limits.

Thus, in the 4 months from September 2004 up until the auction of
Yuganskneftegaz on December 19, 2004, the Russian Federation managed to
increase Yukos’ alleged tax liability by approximately US$ 17 billion.

Efforts to depress the auction price of Yuganskneftegaz. At the same time, with a
view to facilitating the Russian Federation’s acquisition of Yugansh ata
bargain price, the Russian Tax Ministry also fabricated claims against
Yuganskneftegaz. These claims were premised on the application of statutory
provisions on transfer pricing, which the tax authorities systematically refused to
apply in relation to Yukos itself. Significantly, these claims concerned the same oil
trading revenues that had already been re-attributed to Yukos, thus resulting in
double taxation.

Thus, on October 29, 2004, the tax authorities simultaneously: (i) issued a Repeat
Field Tax Audit Report for 2001 requesting Yuganskneftegaz to pay US$ 2.35
billion in alleged tax arrears, interest and fines;93 and (ii) rendered a Decision

-26-

40.

holding Yuganskneftegaz liable for an alleged tax offense for the year 2002 and
requiring payment of US$ 1.03 billion in alleged tax arrears, interest and fines.

On December 3, 2004, a Field Tax Audit Report was issued for the year 2003,
imposing on Yuganskneftegaz an additional USS 1.22 billion in alleged tax arrears,
interest and fines.

In addition to fabricating these US$ 4.6 billion in additional alleged liability, the
Russian authorities also began to sow doubts about the security of
Yuganskneftegaz’s oil licenses to depress further the Company’s value.

That all these payments demands, imposed simultaneously on Yukos and its main
production subsidiary, were issued in the run-up to the auction of Yuganskneftegaz
is no coincidence. Nor is it a coincidence that, after Yuganskneftegaz was acquired
by Rosneft, the tax claims along with the oil license concerns promptly disappeared.
Together with the generous payment terms accorded to Rosneft’s new subsidiary
but systematically denied to Yukos, these facts confirm both the discriminatory
nature of the Russian Federation’s treatment of Yukos, and the true purpose of the
purported tax reassessments against Yuganskneftegaz, namely, to facilitate the
expropriation of the Company and not to collect taxes.

Sham auction of Yugansknefiegaz. As noted above, the Ministry of Justice publicly
announced its plan to sell Yuganskneftegaz on July 20, 2004, purportedly in order to
satisfy the 2000 alleged tax debt.

On August 12, 2004, the bailiffs appointed ZAO Dresdner Bank (“Dresdner”) to
carry out the valuation of Yuganskneftegaz in preparation for its sale. On October
6, 2004, Dresdner issued a confidential report valuing Yuganskneftegaz on a
standalone basis at US$ 18.6 billion — 21.1 billion.

On November 18, 2004, the bailiffs announced that Yuganskneftegaz would be
auctioned to satisfy Yukos’ outstanding tax debt, with the Russian Federal Property
Fund issuing the formal auction notice the following day. The opening price for
100% of the ordinary shares, or 76.79% of Yuganskneftegaz’s total share capital,
was set at USS 8.65 billion, a price well below its true value. The auction date was
set for December 19, 2004, which was the earliest possible date to hold the auction
and only | month away.

In an attempt to prevent the auction of its core asset, Yukos filed an application with
the Moscow Arbitrazh Court to declare unlawful the Bailiff’s Resolution of
November 18, 2004 and sought interim measures. These efforts failed.

Confronted, yet again, with the futility of its efforts to obtain justice before the
Russian courts, on December 14, 2004, Yukos filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection before the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas. By
that date, only 3 companies, Gazpromneft (the new wholly-owned subsidiary of
State-owned Gazprom), First Venture and Intercom, had sought antimonopoly
clearance required in anticipation of the auction. On December 16, 2004, the U.S.
Court issued a Temporary Restraining Order (“TRO”) enjoining Gazpromneft, its
potential lenders, First Venture and Intercom from participating in the auction of
Yuganskneftegaz.

Nonetheless, on December 19, 2004, which was a Sunday, the Russian authorities
proceeded with the auction of Yuganskneftegaz. Gazpromneft and OOO
Baikalfinancegroup (“Baikal”) were registered as participants. Baikal was a
previously unknown company established at the address of a local bar in the
provincial town of Tver on December 6, 2004. With only US$ 359 in capital, it
mysteriously managed to pay a cash deposit in the amount of US$ 1.77 billion to
register for the auction on December 16, 2004.

-27-

41.

42.

43.

44.

45.

46.

47.

At the auction, Baikal opened the bidding at US$ 9.35 billion. Gazpromneft’s
representative asked for a recess and left the room to make a telephone call. Upon
his return, he did not make a single bid and Baikal was pronounced the winner of
the auction with its opening bid of US$ 9.35 billion. The whole bidding process
lasted approximately 10 minutes.

The Respondent's allegation that the low price for Yuganskneftegaz reflected
attempts by Yukos to “sabotage” the auction is unconvincing. Neither “litigation
risk” nor the TRO had a material effect on the participants or the outcome of the
auction. The reality is that, ignoring the advice of its own appraisal firm, the
Russian authorities systematically acted in ways that negatively affected the ability
and willingness of potential bidders to participate, as well as the price they would be
willing to pay. Market participants also understood that political support was
required to participate in auctions for Yukos assets.

The use of Baikal as a conduit for the eventual transfer of Yuganskneftegaz to a
State-owned company was confirmed when, only a few days later, on December 23,
2004, Rosneft issued a statement announcing its acquisition of Baikal. Meeting
journalists that day, President Putin confirmed his knowledge of the acquisition,
stating that: “Today, the state, resorting to absolutely legal market mechanisms, is
looking after its own interests. I consider this to be quite logical”. Rosneft then
enabled Baikal to repay the principal and interest on its debt by granting it, on
December 30, 2004, a 1-year interest-free loan.

Rosneft benefited significantly from this acquisition, with Rosneft’s estimated value
increasing dramatically from US$ 7 billion in December 2004 to USS 80 billion for
its IPO in mid-2006. Based on the valuation disclosed by Rosneft at the time,
Yuganskneftegaz was worth US$ 55.78 billion. Further, as noted above, the tax
bills raised against Yuganskneftegaz as a Yukos subsidiary were almost entirely set
aside by the Russian courts following its acquisition by Rosneft.

Looked at from any angle, the Russian Federation’s approach to enforcement of the
alleged tax debts, culminating in the transfer of Yuganskneftegaz to Rosneft in a
sham auction, confirms that the Russian Federation’s real goal was to expropriate
the Company, and not to collect taxes.

Even after the sham auction of Yuganskneftegaz, there was no legitimate reason to
put Yukos into bankruptcy. There were no substantial creditors apart from the
Russian Federation, and the seizure of Yukos’ assets remained in place, so there was
no risk of assets being dissipated and no need to resolve conflicting creditors’
claims. Yukos still possessed 2 substantial production subsidiaries—
Samaraneftegaz and Tomskneft—as well as refining and marketing assets, and
several non-core assets that it could readily have disposed of to pay off its
outstanding debts and remain a going concern. However, the Russian authorities’
priority was not recouping taxes; nor did they have any intention of allowing Yukos
to survive as a going concern. The initiation of the bankruptcy proceedings provided
a convenient way to sideline Yukos’ management and to facilitate the taking of the
Company’s remaining assets.

  

Forcing Yukos into bankruptcy. As a result of the Russian Federation’s attack,
Yukos defaulted on a US$ | billion loan granted by a syndicate of Western banks.
On December 13, 2005, Rosneft entered into a confidential agreement with the
syndicate under which Rosneft agreed to pay the outstanding amount owed by
Yukos in exchange for the assignment to Rosneft of the syndicate’s rights of claim
against Yukos. Crucially, the payment of Yukos’ debt by Rosneft was conditioned
upon the initiation of Yukos’ bankruptcy by the syndicate. Pursuant to that
agreement, on March 6, 2006, the syndicate filed a petition with the Moscow
Arbitrazh Court to declare Yukos bankrupt, and on March 14, 2006, Rosneft paid
off the loan.

-28 -

48.

49.

On March 28, 2006, the Moscow Arbitrazh Court ordered the commencement of
bankruptcy proceedings, placed Yukos under supervision, appointed Mr. Rebgun as
interim administrator, and formally substituted Rosneft for the syndicate as creditor.

The Respondent argues that “sound commercial interests” explain both the
syndicate’s sale of the loan and Rosneft’s reasons for acquiring the same. However,
even if that were the case, the Respondent still fails to answer the basic question:
why not simply have the syndicate of banks assign their claim to Rosneft, and let
Rosneft put Yukos into bankruptcy? The only plausible explanation for this
elaborate stratagem was to conceal the Russian Federation’s role in initiating the
bankruptcy of Yukos.

Ensuring the Russian State’s control over the bankruptcy proceedings. After
Rosneft initiated the bankruptcy through the syndicate, the Russian courts ensured
that the Russian State, either directly or through Rosneft, would become Yukos’
main creditor.

First, the Russian courts bent over backwards to ensure that the tax authorities’
purported claims would be admitted, by: (i) delaying a scheduled hearing in order
to give “the State more time to prove new tax claims”, namely, the US$ 3.9 billion
in tax payment demands for 2004, which the tax authorities rushed to issue on
March 17, 2006, 11 days after the bankruptcy petition was filed; (ii) merging
Yukos’ challenge to that payment demand into the bankruptcy proceedings; and
(iii) approving all the tax authorities’ purported claims against Yukos for the years
2000-2004 following a wholly perfunctory review of the voluminous case files.
Consequently, the Federal Taxation Service was by far Yukos’ largest creditor with
60.50% of all registered bankruptcy claims.

Second, in the period leading up to the first meeting of Yukos’ registered creditors
on July 20, 2006, some 29 purported claims were admitted on behalf of
Yuganskneftegaz, now Rosneft’s subsidiary, totaling approximately US$ 4.42
billion. Subsequently, Rosneft secured admission of an even larger claim of
USS 5.55 billion premised on an allegation that Yuganskneftegaz had suffered “lost
profits” in this amount during the period 2000-2003. These purported claims of
USS 9.97 billion enabled Rosneft to more than recoup the USS 9.35 billion paid for
Yuganskneftegaz and thereby acquire the Company for free. With the admission of
these and various smaller claims, Rosneft became Yukos’ second largest creditor
with 37.17% of all registered bankruptcy claims.

Third, while the Russian court hearing Yukos’ bankruptcy showed great flexibility
in admitting any and all claims to benefit the Russian State, it was intransigent and
formalistic in finding pretexts not to recognize substantial claims of creditors related
to Yukos or to Yukos’ shareholders.

These combined efforts resulted in the complete monopolization of Yukos’
bankruptcy proceedings by the Russian State, which held 97.67% of all bankruptcy
claims, guaranteeing its control over the bankruptcy process.

Rejection of Yukos’ Rehabilitation Plan. The Financial Rehabilitation Plan proposed
by Yukos’ management (“the Rehabilitation Plan”) set out a series of concrete
measures that would enable Yukos to pay off its alleged liabilities fully within
2 years, while remaining a viable going concern. This would be achieved by, among
other things, creating a “cash pool” from the sale of ancillary assets, cash flows
generated by Yukos’ remaining core assets, and more than US$ 1.5 billion from the
sale of Yukos’ 53.7% stake in the Lithuanian oil company Mazeikiu Nafta and
Yukos’ 49% stake in Slovakian oil transport major Transpetrol.

By contrast, according to Mr. Rebgun, the potential proceeds from the sale of
Yukos’ remaining assets, which he significantly undervalued at US$ 17.75 billion
(after deducting the 24% profit tax payable on auction proceeds), were not sufficient

-29-

60.

Til.

62.

to cover the US$ 18.3 billion of registered bankruptcy claims. Accordingly, he did
not even bother to propose any measure for the Company’s financial restoration but
simply recommended liquidation. In the event, despite the fact that the bankruptcy
auction prices represented significant markdowns from market value, the
bankruptcy estate netted approximately US$ 35.55 billion—twice the amount
Mr. Rebgun had put forward to argue in favor of liquidation.

Ultimately, the Federal Taxation Service and Rosneft held 93.87% of votes at the
meeting of Yukos’ creditors of July 25, 2006. It therefore came as no surprise that
they rejected the Rehabilitation Plan and voted to liquidate Yukos’ assets, despite
the fact that Yukos’ assets exceeded its alleged liabilities, and the Company was
clearly solvent.

The bankruptcy auctions. Yukos’ remaining assets were transferred to the Russian
State at well below their fair market value through a series of 17 auctions held
between March 2006 and August 2007. Rosneft thereby directly or indirectly
acquired Yukos’ key remaining assets, including Samaraneftegaz (Lot No. 11) and
Tomskneft (Lot No. 10), which were sold at a gross discount of approximately 37%
and 33%, respectively, of their fair market value. For its part, Gazprom acquired
through Eni/Enel the 20% minus | share stake in Sibneft that the Russian Federation
had persistently refused to let Yukos sell to pay off alleged tax debts. As with the
sham auction of Yuganskneftegaz, there was no genuine competition in the
bankruptcy auctions and, in many instances, including those for Samaraneftegaz and
Tomskneft, the only participants were Rosneft and a previously unknown entity
whose sole role was to satisfy the formal requirement that there be a minimum of
2 bidders.

Finally, when, by the end of July 2007, it became clear that despite the low auction
prices, the bankruptcy might still generate some surplus, further claims were
admitted in the bankruptcy proceedings on behalf of the Russian State, through the
Federal Taxation Service and Rosneft. This ensured the completeness of Yukos’
destruction and the transfer of its value and assets to the Russian State. Thus, the
Russian Federation received, either directly or through State-owned Rosneft or
Gazprom, approximately 99.71% of the bankruptcy proceeds and over 95% of
Yukos’ remaining assets, including all of Yukos’ main production assets.

On November 12, 2007, the Moscow Arbitrazh Court formally endorsed all the
activities of Yukos’ receiver Mr. Rebgun, closed the Company’s receivership and
ordered that Yukos be struck off the register of legal entities. The latter happened on
November 21, 2007: Yukos was removed from the register of companies, its shares
were legally extinguished and so, too, were the Claimants’ investments.

CONCLUSION

Seen together, the Russian Federation’s actions can only be reasonably understood
as a deliberate and sustained effort to destroy Yukos, gain control over its assets and
eliminate Mr. Khodorkovsky as a potential political opponent. Indeed, viewed any
other way, they make no sense and the Respondent has been unable to provide a
plausible alternative explanation for its actions.

LAW

THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION IS IN BREACH OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER ART. 10(1)
ECT

Under Article 10(1) ECT, the Russian Federation undertook to “encourage and
create stable, equitable, favorable and transparent conditions for Investors”, to
accord at all times “fair and equitable treatment” to investments made in its territory
and not to “in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures [the]

-30-

65.

66.

67.

68.

69.

70.

management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal” of such investments, which
“shall also enjoy the most constant protection and security”.

The Russian Federation violated the above mentioned undertakings in the most
egregious manner. In particular, it violated its obligation under Article 10(1) ECT to
provide to the Claimants’ investments fair and equitable treatment, by failing to
meet basic requirements of procedural propriety and due process, engaging in
conduct that was unreasonable, arbitrary, disproportionate and abusive, and failing
to ensure a stable and transparent legal and business framework. The Russian
Federation’s actions also constituted a denial of justice in breach of the fair and
equitable treatment standard of Article 10(1) ECT, as demonstrated by, inter alia,
the removal of judges refusing to rule in the Russian State’s favor and the lack of
independence and impartiality of judges hearing Yukos’ cases.

‘The Russian Federation also breached Article 10(1) ECT by discriminating against
the Claimants’ investments. In particular, it (i) singled out Yukos and treated it in a
markedly different manner from other similar oil companies in Russia, (ii) treated
Yuganskneftegaz differently before and after its acquisition by State-owned
Rosneft, in the hands of which the former Yukos subsidiary’s alleged tax liabilities
all but disappeared, and (iii) ensured a differential treatment in the bankruptcy
proceedings between creditors related to Yukos, on the one hand, and State-related
creditors, on the other.

The Respondent’s primary defense is to invoke Article 21 ECT to argue that the
Claimants’ claims should be dismissed on the ground that they are “based
exclusively on measures ‘with respect to Taxation Measures.”” As discussed below,
not only is the Respondent's interpretation of Article 21 ECT untenable, but the
Russian Federation’s conduct had nothing to do with the genuine exercise of its
taxation power and is thus not covered by Article 21 ECT.

The Respondent has moreover attempted to restrict the scope of its treaty
obligations by misrepresenting the content of the fair and equitable treatment and
discrimination standards in Article 10(1) ECT. Such attempts are groundless and
should be rejected.

THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION IS IN BREACH OF ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER ART. 13(1)
ECT

The Russian Federation expropriated the Claimants’ investments in breach of
Article 13(1) ECT.

As of October 2003, Yukos was one of the largest oil companies in the world. It
held 92% of Sibneft, 3 core production subsidiaries (Yuganskneftegaz,
Samaraneftegaz and Tomskneft), as well as refining and marketing subsidiaries. As
of November 21, 2007, it ceased to exist as a company, owing to a series of actions
by which the Russian Federation seized its assets and transferred their title to State-
owned Rosneft and Gazprom. The only plausible explanation for the Russian
Federation’s actions is the twin desire of dismantling the Company and transferring
its assets to the State and the removal of Mr. Khodorkovsky as a potential political
opponent. The result of those actions was a complete and total deprivation of the
Claimants’ investments therein.

‘The Russian Federation moreover failed to satisfy any of the 4 conditions set out in
Article 13(1) ECT. The expropriation of the Claimants’ investments was manifestly:
(i) not in the public interest; (ii) discriminatory; (iii) carried out without due process
of law; and (iv) not accompanied by the payment of any compensation, let alone
prompt, adequate and effective compensation.

Unable to deny the total deprivation of the Claimants’ investments and the transfer
of title of Yukos’ assets to State-owned Rosneft and Gazprom, the Respondent

-31-

74.

75.

76.

77.

disaggregates its actions and argues that, when taken in isolation, each of them was,
under Russian law, a proper response to Yukos’ alleged conduct. While, in fact,
many of those actions amounted to a gross distortion or abuse of Russian law,
lawfulness under domestic law is not, in any event, the proper inquiry under Article
13(1) ECT. Under the applicable international law standards, the actions of the
Russian Federation, in their totality, constitute an expropriation of the Claimants’
investments in breach of Article 13(1) ECT for which compensation is due.

DAMAGES

The Russian Federation is under an obligation to make full reparation to the
Claimants for the financial consequences of its breaches of Articles 10(1) and 13(1)
ECT. This standard of reparation is not challenged by the Respondent.

The magnitude of these financial consequences cannot be underestimated. As a
result of the Respondent's actions, the Claimants have lost the entire value of their
investments in YukosSibneft, as well as the benefits they should have received from
those investments. The Claimants’ valuation expert, Navigant, has quantified the
Claimants’ damages for the loss of their investments in YukosSibneft at USS
114.174 billion.

Navigant has also quantified the Claimants’ damages for the loss of their
investments in YukosSibneft in 3 alternative scenarios, assuming that: (i) the
Respondent does not bear responsibility for the demerger between Yukos and
Sibneft, which it does; (ii) further, all tax reassessments were legitimate, which they
were not; and (iii) in addition, the sale of Yuganskneftegaz was legitimate, which it
was not, and assessing the Claimants’ damages at US$ 107.966 billion, US$ 69.583
billion, and USS 33.317 billion, respectively.

In its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent chose not to challenge Navigant’s
valuation of the Claimants’ expropriated investments underlying their principal
claims for damages, instead seeking to divert the Tribunal’s attention through a
series of flawed objections. When the Respondent did make an effort to address the
subject, in its Rejoinder, its arguments were inaccurate and entirely divorced from
historical data and contemporaneous valuations of YukosSibneft’s assets.

Navigant has provided the only reliable and methodologically sound model for
calculating the compensation due to the Claimants by the Russian Federation for the
expropriation of their investments in breach of Articles 10(1) and 13(1) ECT.

THE RESPONDENT’S OBJECTIONS SHOULD BE REJECTED

The Respondent's rehashed ‘fork-in-the-road’ objection is both res judicata and
groundless. The Respondent contends that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the
Claimants’ claims because the Claimants are allegedly pursuing identical claims
before the ECtHR. This very same objection was first raised in the jurisdiction and
admissibility phase of these arbitrations and unequivocally dismissed by the
Tribunal. It is entirely inappropriate for the Respondent to reopen this issue, which
is res judicata, on the basis that it was allegedly poorly decided. Further, the
Respondent's allegations that the Interim Awards were based on an “incorrect
assumption” or that there are “special circumstances” justifying a new examination
of the issue are unfounded. The Respondent’s objection based on Article 26(3)(b)(i)
ECT is manifestly without merit and must fail.

 

The Respondent's attempt to rely on Article 21 ECT is misguided. The issues arising
in relation to Article 21 ECT have already been briefed at length in the jurisdiction
and admissibility phase of these arbitrations. In deferring the Respondent's
objection based on Article 21 ECT to the merits phase, the Tribunal indicated that it
did not wish to rule in a vacuum on the issue of the background to, and motivation
behind, the Russian Federation’s actions. In light of the Parties’ pleadings on the

-32-

Vi

merits, it is clear that those actions had nothing whatsoever to do with the genuine
exercise of the Russian Federation’s taxation powers, but were rather solely
intended to destroy Yukos and gain control of its assets. Article 21 ECT clearly was
not meant to shield a Contracting Party from such egregious conduct.

Even assuming, however, that the Russian Federation’s actions were a genuine
exercise of its taxation powers, which they were not, those actions would
nonetheless fall outside the scope of Article 21 ECT, which is limited to the
enactment of tax provisions. Further, even if Article 21 ECT were applicable, which
it is not, Article 21(5) ECT ensures that Article 13(1) ECT’s substantive protection
from expropriation remains fully intact. Finally, under any interpretation of
Article 21 ECT, many of the Russian Federation’s actions had nothing to do with
taxation and thus fall outside the ambit of Article 21 ECT altogether.

Conversely, under the Respondent's interpretation of Article 21 ECT, save for
expropriatory “charges or payments, to the exclusion of enforcement and collection
measures, including interest and fines”, investors would stand unprotected from any
and all State actions, so long as the respondent State in an arbitration labels its
actions as “taxation”—regardless of whether such actions had anything to do with
taxation, or were being pursued with the sole aim of expropriating or otherwise
harming an investor’s investment. Such an interpretation, which would turn
Article 21 ECT into a gaping hole in one of the key multilateral treaties on
investment protection, is clearly untenable and should be rejected.

The Respondent's so-called “unclean hands” theory is without merit. The
Respondent argues that over a period of approximately 12 years, an array of actors
engaged in a variety of allegedly “illegal and bad faith misconduct” that somehow
deprive the Claimants’ investments of ECT protection. The Respondent's position is
fundamentally unfounded for several reasons. First, the so-called “unclean hands”
theory finds no support in the text of the ECT, customary international law, or
investment treaty jurisprudence. Second, even assuming the existence of such a
general principle of international law, which the Claimants deny, its scope would be
dramatically more limited than the Respondent contends, such that the Respondent
has not alleged any facts that could establish its applicability in the present case. As
demonstrated by the Claimants, the Respondent’s theory is premised almost
exclusively on allegations of collateral illegalities, unrelated either to the making of
the Claimants’ investments, or to the Claimants’ claims in these arbitrations, and all
but one of which assert misconduct by third parties. Third, and in any event, the
Respondent has failed utterly to substantiate any of its allegations. Finally, the
principles of estoppel and proportionality prevent the Respondent from invoking
such alleged illegalities in an attempt to escape liability for its violations of the
ECT.

In its Rejoinder, while recounting its laundry list of alleged misconduct, the
Respondent devotes attention solely to its allegation concerning the application of
the 1998 Russia-Cyprus Double Taxation Agreement (“DTA”). Apart from the fact
that: (i) this allegation has no bearing on the merits of these arbitrations; and
(ii) these arbitrations are not the appropriate forum to hear and decide an alleged
dispute on the application of the DTA, the Claimants have, in any event,
demonstrated that this allegation is baseless. The Respondent’s so-called “unclean
hands” objection is thus without merit and must fail.

REQUEST FOR RELIEF

For the reasons set out above, the Claimants respectfully request the Arbitral
Tribunal to render an Award granting the relief set out in paragraph 1199 of the
Claimants’ Reply.

B. RESPONDENT’S SKELETON ARGUMENTS

109. The text of the paragraphs below is produced directly from paragraphs | to 104 of
Respondent’s Skeleton Argument submitted on 1 October 2012 (“Respondent’s Skeleton”)

(annexes omitted).

L The Russian Federation Properly Assessed Taxes And Fines Against Yukos

1. Yukos fraudulently evaded billions of dollars of Russian corporate profit tax from
1999 to 2004, abusing the program authorized by the Russian Government in the
early 1990s to foster economic development in designated economically
underdeveloped areas. Under this program, corporate profits in the low-tax regions
were taxed at substantially reduced rates if the taxpayer complied with the
applicable legal rules, including Russia’s anti-tax abuse principles.

2. In order to properly avail itself of the benefits available in a low-tax region, Yukos
was required to comply with three legal regimes: (a) the federal statute authorizing
the low-tax region program and the region’s own statutes; (b) Yukos’ agreements
with the regional authorities; and (c) Russia’s federal anti-tax abuse “bad faith
taxpayer” doctrine.

3. The federal bad faith taxpayer doctrine is rooted in Russia’s federal Constitution,
and has been applied by Russian tax authorities and courts in thousands of cases
since the mid-1990s to condemn abusive transactions that, in substance, constitute
unlawful tax evasion. As described by Yukos’ own tax lawyers in commentaries
they published before the assessments at issue in these arbitrations, this doctrine
condemns as tax evasion transactions in which “the taxpayer’s actions were aimed
solely to reduce the amount of its tax payments rather than to achieve an economic
result, [as] this would demonstrate that the relevant transaction was inconsistent
with law because the motive underlying such transaction was to avoid tax [...}. A
person’s actions aimed solely at tax evasion may not be regarded as actions made in
good faith.”

4. Yukos abused the low-tax region program, and evaded Russian corporate profit tax
in violation of the bad faith taxpayer doctrine, by implementing what Yukos
referred to internally as its “tax optimization” scheme. Pursuant to this scheme,
Yukos established dozens of sham “trading companies” in low-tax regions that had
no business purpose, and then shifted its own profits to the sham trading companies.
These sham trading shells had no genuine economic substance and served no
purpose other than to reduce Yukos’ tax liabilities, an arrangement described by
Yukos’ own lawyers as constituting unlawful tax evasion.

 

5. The European Court of Human Rights (“ECtHR”) unanimously rejected Yukos’
challenge of the tax assessments that are at issue here, on the basis of the same core
principles that underlie these arbitrations. The ECtHR found that Yukos’ “tax
optimization” scheme consisted of “switching the tax burden from [Yukos] and its
production and service units to letter-box companies in domestic tax havens in
Russia,” and that these “letter box companies” had “no assets, employees or
operations of their own [and] were nominally owned and managed by third parties,
although in reality they were set up and run by [Yukos] itself.”

 

6. According to the ECtHR, the “letter-box companies” (a) purchased oil and oil
products from Yukos’ production companies at a fraction of their true market
prices, (b) “acting in cascade, then sold the oil either abroad, this time at market
price or to [Yukos’] refineries and subsequently re-bought it at a reduced price and
re-sold it at the market price,” (c) thereby accumulated most of Yukos” profits in the
low-tax regions, resulting in Yukos paying substantially lower taxes on those

-34-

profits, and (d) then unilaterally transferred to Yukos, as a gift or in purported
repayment of sham loans, the profits that had been improperly taxed at reduced
rates in the low-tax regions. The ECtHR unanimously concluded that this scheme
“was obviously aimed at evading the general requirements of the Tax Code [...].”

The Russian tax authorities concluded that Yukos’ “tax optimization” scheme
constituted unlawful tax evasion under the bad faith taxpayer doctrine. In particular,
the Russian tax authorities found, and the Russian courts later agreed, that Yukos
had abused the low-tax region program because its trading shells (a) did not engage
in any genuine business activities in the low-tax regions, but were instead controlled
by Yukos from Moscow, (b) purchased oil and oil products at below-market prices
solely to artificially concentrate Yukos’ profits in low-tax regions, and (c) made
only paltry investments in the low-tax regions that were dwarfed by the tax benefits
they claimed, thereby failing to fulfill the purpose of the low-tax region program.

Yukos did not then -- or later -- offer any rationale for selling Yukos’ oil through its
network of low tax region trading companies other than reducing Yukos” own tax
liabilities, nor have Claimants done so in these arbitrations.

Yukos was aware of the bad faith taxpayer doctrine and the risk that its scheme
would result in substantial tax assessments if the Russian authorities were ever to
learn of it. Among other things, (a) Yukos knew that the authorities had previously
denied the low-tax region benefits claimed by several sham trading shells in the
Lesnoy region and Sibirskaya based on the same Russian anti-abuse rules that were
later applied to Yukos (the Russian authorities only later learned that Yukos
exercised de facto control over and management of Sibirskaya and the Lesnoy
trading shells, and that Yukos surreptitiously liquidated the latter in order to prevent
the collection of their overdue taxes), (b) Yukos managers had expressly warned the
company’s senior executives in internal memoranda that public disclosure of the
scheme “will result in substantial tax claims against the Company,” (c) as Yukos’
former deputy general counsel later conceded, none of the company’s external
lawyers was willing to render an opinion endorsing its scheme (to the contrary, in
refusing to render a “clean” opinion, one cited the need to comply with the same
bad faith taxpayer doctrine that later led the Russian tax authorities and courts to
find that Yukos was guilty of tax evasion), and (d) Yukos had access to the
numerous court decisions applying the bad faith taxpayer doctrine to abusive tax
schemes -- including those finding Lukoil, one of Yukos’ major competitors, liable
for substantial additional amounts for having abused the low-tax region program --
and to the published legal commentaries discussing the bad faith taxpayer doctrine
and its requirements, including those written by its own tax lawyers.

Yukos’ knowledge that its “tax optimization” scheme was unlawful is further
confirmed by Yukos’ repeated lies to the tax authorities, the Russian courts, the
ECtHR, and Yukos’ own external auditors, including Yukos’ knowingly false
assertion that it was not affiliated with (and did not control) the sham trading shells,
a point now conceded even by Claimants. Yukos’ repeated false denial of its
affiliation with the sham trading shells can only be explained by the company’s
awareness of the illegality of its scheme.

Yukos’ tax evasion was not victimless. The billions of dollars in tax benefits it
wrongfully claimed caused commensurate damage to the regional budget of
Moscow, where Yukos, as the real party in interest, should have paid profit tax at
the full rate.

Claimants’ claims that the Russian authorities’ measures were expropriatory and
unfair are meritless. First, Claimants’ contention that the legal principles applied by
the Russian courts were “novel” or “vague” is, as the ECtHR unanimously found,
refuted by the numerous Russian court decisions that applied these principles and
similar ones to hold taxpayers liable for tax evasion since the mid-1990s, including

-35-

their abuse of the low-tax region program. Moreover, the published legal
commentaries, including the guidance published by Yukos’ own tax counsel,
describe those principles in the same terms as they were applied to Yukos. The
relevant Russian judicial precedents include those compiled for the Tribunal by
Russian tax law expert Oleg Konnov, whose description of the history and content
of the bad faith taxpayer doctrine Claimants have not sought to rebut with any
expert testimony.

Mr. Konnov shows that the fines assessed against Yukos were also proper because,
among other reasons, no taxpayer -- in Russia or elsewhere -- could legitimately
claim to be surprised that it may not invoke a limitations period that has expired
only because of its own obstruction of tax audits.

Claimants also ignore the extensive international precedents demonstrating that the
principles applied by the Russian authorities and the actions they took against
Yukos’ tax evasion were consistent with those of ECT signatories and other nations
worldwide.

Second, Claimants’ attack on Yukos’ VAT assessments -- holding Yukos liable for
the VAT due on revenues nominally realized by the sham trading shells but
properly attributable to Yukos itself -- is also meritless. As the ECtHR unanimously
held, the Russian authorities acted properly in disregarding Yukos’ sham trading
shells for profit tax purposes and denying Yukos the benefit of the shells’ 0% VAT
filings. Claimants also ignore Yukos’ still unexplained failure to submit proper 0%
VAT returns in its own name after it received its December 29, 2003 tax audit
report. It is not disputed that Yukos could have filed proper VAT returns -- nothing
prevented it from doing so -- or that had it done so, it would have avoided more
than half of its challenged tax liabilities,

Third, Claimants’ assertion that the tax assessments were discriminatory is
contradicted by the facts. The ECtHR unanimously rejected this charge. Several
large Russian companies, including a number of Yukos’ principal competitors, were
also held liable for tax evasion and assessed substantial amounts of tax on grounds
similar to those relied on by the Russian authorities and courts in dealing with
Yukos. But unlike Yukos, these other companies promptly paid their taxes and, in
the case of Lukoil, publicly abandoned its own “tax optimization” scheme.

 

There were also numerous material differences between Yukos’ conduct and that of
many other Russian oil companies: (a) no other Russian oil company committed
abuses that were as egregious as those of Yukos, (b) none did so for as long as
Yukos, (c) none attempted to conceal its abuses as did Yukos (to the extent of lying
about them to the tax authorities, the courts, and even its own auditors), (d) none
obstructed their tax audits as did Yukos, including by sending documents and
employees to distant locations before they could be reviewed and interviewed, (e)
none made investments in the low-tax regions that were so miniscule in comparison
to the tax benefits they claimed, (f) none diverted billions of dollars offshore to
prevent the collection of overdue taxes, and (g) none refused to pay their assessed
taxes when ultimately required to do so.

Fourth, Claimants’ contention that the Russian authorities knew and approved of
Yukos’ scheme is completely unsupported by any credible evidence, as the ECtHR
again unanimously found. Claimants’ contention cannot be reconciled with Yukos’
unflagging efforts to conceal its scheme from the Russian authorities. Yukos would
obviously have had no reason to hide its scheme if it believed the authorities were
already aware of it, let alone had approved it, or if it thought its scheme was lawful
and its disclosure would not lead to substantial tax claims. Yukos’ efforts to conceal
its scheme are reflected in (a) the company’s convoluted offshore structures, serving
no purpose other than to mask Yukos’ affiliation with its sham trading shells, (b)
Yukos’ seriatim restructuring of its Lesnoy trading shells after their abuse of that

-36-

region’s low tax program was discovered, (c) Yukos’ management’s internal
warnings that disclosure of its scheme “will result in substantial tax claims against
the Company,” (d) Yukos’ failure to disclose its scheme in its purportedly
“transparent” financial statements, and (e) Yukos” repeated lies about its scheme to
the tax authorities, the courts, the ECtHR, and its own auditors.

In any event, as a matter of Russian law and as Claimants concede, even if the tax
authorities had known of Yukos’ scheme -- and there is no evidence they did -- they
would not have been estopped from later challenging it.

Fifth, Claimants’ contention that the assessments against Yukos were fabricated as

 

part of a politically motivated tod le Yukos — an all on
which Claimants have unambiguously staked their claims, contending that the
assessments “cannot be explained in any other way” -- is, as the ECtHR again

unanimously found, unsupported by any credible evidence. If the assessments were,
as Claimants insist, the product of a massive political conspiracy spanning several
years and involving agencies, engineered and i d
by hundreds if not thousands of officials, including no fewer than 60 judges at four
different levels of courts, along with a large cast of third parties around the globe,
then surely after nearly a decade of challenges -- by Yukos, its minority
shareholders, and now Claimants -- at least one internal government memorandum,
instruction or minute of a meeting evidencing or referring to the grand conspiracy
alleged by Claimants would have surfaced, or one disgruntled former Government
official would have reported having participated in a meeting or telephone call
where the alleged conspiracy was discussed. Instead, Claimants rely solely on
double and triple hearsay renditions of purported conversations by vocal opponents
of the Russian Government, inaccurate and uninformed reports by political
commentators, and sheer innuendo, none of which, even as proffered, competently
supports Claimants’ conspiracy allegations.

Claimants’ failure to prove the supposed vast conspiracy confirms that it is merely
one more sham perpetrated by the Oligarchs who controlled Yukos and were
ultimately responsible for its demise.

Yukos’ dealings with PricewaterhouseCoopers (“PwC”) provide yet another
example of Yukos’ blaming the Russian Federation for the consequences of its own
misconduct.

PwC withdrew all of its Yukos audit opinions in June 2007 (after refusing to
continue to audit the company’s U.S. GAAP financial statements in 2003, itself an
extraordinary event for a supposedly “transparent” company), following
confirmation that Yukos’ senior managers had repeatedly lied to PwC about, among
other things, Yukos’ de facto control over the management of its sham trading
shells -- an essential element in the company’s “tax optimization” scheme.

Claimants’ attempt to blame the Russian Federation for PwC’s withdrawal of the
firm’s audit opinions finds no support in the record. To the contrary, both PwC’s
senior Russian representative at the time (in a contemporaneous private
conversation with U.S. Embassy officials in Moscow) and PwC’s senior Yukos
auditor (in sworn U.S. deposition testimony) confirm that PwC, in withdrawing its
audit opinions, acted in accordance with applicable auditing standards, a conclusion
supported by Mr. John Ellison, a former KPMG LLP partner, in his unchallenged
expert report. The U.S. deposition testimony of Mr. Douglas Miller, the PwC
partner in charge of auditing Yukos, is especially relevant, because (a) it was sought
by counsel for Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev on the grounds that it would
provide the best opportunity to obtain a truthful account of the reasons for PwC’s
actions, and (b) Mr. Miller repeatedly rejected Claimants’ “harassment” theory.

On all of these points, the Ros/nvestCo and Rovime awards are inconsistent with the
facts and Russian law, and ignore a wealth of uncontested international practice.

Til

The Russian Federation Is Not Responsible For And Did Not Cause The
Unwinding Of The Sibneft Merger

The Russian Federation is not responsible for the unwinding of Yukos’ proposed
merger with Sibneft because Claimants do not allege -- let alone establish -- that
Sibneft was then exercising governmental authority or acting under the instructions
of Russian State organs. Nor was the Russian Federation the cause of the unwinding
of the merger. To the contrary, the Russian Federation repeatedly supported the
proposed merger, and Claimants themselves acknowledge that the Russian
Federation provided all of the approvals necessary for the merger, including
approvals granted long after the Russian Federation’s supposed attack on Yukos.

The merger in fact collapsed because Yukos refused to accommodate Sibneft’s
request. that Mr. Khodorkovsky, following his resignation from Yukos’
management, be replaced by a Sibneft nominee as head of the to-be merged
company. Sibneft’s proposal would have left Yukos representatives in all of the
surviving company’s other senior management positions.

Documents that Claimants were ordered to produce in these proceedings (over their
objection) show that Claimants and Sibneft’s principal shareholders agreed to
unwind the merger without the payment of additional compensation by either side,
an agreement fatal to Claimants’ request for damages relating to the proposed
merger. The same documents also reveal that Yukos’ management proposed its own
plan to unwind the merger without the payment of additional compensation, and
that this plan contemplated the initiation of a “sham” lawsuit challenging the
previously-completed exchange of Yukos and Sibneft shares. The contemplated
lawsuit bears a striking resemblance to the actual lawsuit (challenged by Yukos in
these arbitrations) that was brought by two of Yukos’ shareholders and ultimately
led to the legal unwinding of the merger without the payment of additional
compensation.

Claimants’ assertion that the US$ 2 billion giga-dividend was required by the
Sibneft merger is patently untrue. The record shows that the giga-dividend was
approved on November 28, 2003 (and not on September 25, 2003, as Claimants
falsely asserted in their Reply), one day after Yukos was informed that the Sibneft
merger would not proceed. At the Extraordinary General Meeting of Yukos’
shareholders held on November 28, Claimants voted against all the other
shareholder proposals linked to the completion of the Sibneft merger, but supported
payment of the giga-dividend “for Yukos” (that is, for Claimants to the extent of
70% of the dividend).

Yukos Bears Sole ibility For The C Of The A

Properly Made Against It, Because It Could Have Avoided Those
Consequences -- And Reduced Its Liability By Well More Than Half — By
Paying The Amounts Due During The First Quarter Of 2004, While
Continuing To Challenge The Assessments In Full

During the first quarter of 2004, Yukos could have avoided well more than half of
its ultimate tax exposure by paying its corporate profit taxes and the interest then
due and by filing proper amended VAT returns in its own name. Had Yukos taken
these few simple steps -- abiding by its own tax counsel’s published advice as to
how a taxpayer should mitigate its tax liabilities -- it would also have avoided all of
the subsequent enforcement measures about which Claimants complain, and still
preserved its right to seek a refund of all the taxes it paid.

If Yukos had mitigated its liabilities in this way, its total exposure under the
Russian court rulings that Claimants challenge in these arbitrations would have
been capped at less than US$ 9.8 billion, rather than the US$ 25.8 billion that was
ultimately assessed.

-38-

Yukos had more than ample resources in the first quarter of 2004 to cap its tax
exposure at less than US$ 9.8 billion and to satisfy that liability, even after paying
its unprecedented USS 2 billion giga-dividend, but it elected not to do so.

Instead, Yukos pursued an irrational and ultimately self-destructive course of
action, for which only the managers of Yukos, installed and controlled by
Claimants, are to blame. This course of action included (a) Yukos’ continuing
denial of any liability for its assessed taxes, (b) Yukos’ now acknowledged false
denial that it controlled the sham trading shells, (c) Yukos’ repeated obstruction of
the actions taken by the Russian authorities to enforce and collect the company’s
overdue taxes, (d) Yukos’ dissipation of its own assets and those of the companies it
controlled, to frustrate the collection of the taxes it owed, and (e) Yukos” attempt to
put pressure on the Russian Government by mounting an aggressive international
lobbying and disinformation campaign that sought to politicize what, for the
Russian authorities, was always a matter of tax evasion and collection.

All of the subsequent enforcement proceedings and other measures about which
Claimants now complain were thus the result of Yukos’ own adamant refusal to
acknowledge or mitigate its tax liabilities, and its repeated attempts to dissipate and
conceal its assets and to frustrate the enforcement and collection of its overdue taxes.
Had Yukos not persisted in this self-destructive course of action, there would have
been no April injunction (discussed below), and YNG would not have been sold.

Permitting Claimants to benefit from Yukos’ self-inflicted wounds would
contravene basic legal principles, and provide Claimants with a windfall -- beyond
the billions of dollars they have already extracted from Yukos, including by way of
dividends, share sales, and stichting assets -- to which they are not entitled.

The Russian Federation Acted Properly In Enforcing The Tax Assessments
Against Yukos, Including By Auctioning YNG

‘The tax assessments were enforced against Yukos in compliance with Russian law
and after ample notice to Yukos. As the ECtHR unanimously concluded, there is
“no reason to doubt that throughout the proceedings the actions of various
authorities had a lawful basis and that the legal provisions in question were
sufficiently precise and clear.” The enforcement actions were also measured and
appropriate in the circumstances and entirely consistent with international practice.

Claimants’ and Yukos’ contention that Yukos was “surprised” by the timing of the
assessment for 2000 and the need to make prompt payment is false and indicative of
Yukos’ lack of good faith. Promptly upon receipt of the December 29, 2003 audit
report, Yukos’ internal and external counsel advised Yukos that, under established
Russian law and practice, it should expect to receive a final tax assessment within
about a month, and that this assessment would require Yukos to make full payment
promptly, most likely within one day. In the event, the tax assessment for 2000 was
issued on April 14, 2004, more than two months later than Yukos’ advisors had
expected, and required payment in two days, not one.

  

Although Yukos had ample notice of when and how much it would be required to
pay, it made no effort to marshal the necessary assets, instead claiming that it was
not able to pay, even though Claimants now acknowledge that Yukos had sufficient
resources to pay all of its 2000 taxes.

By the time of Yukos’ April 2004 assessment, the tax authorities had learned that
Yukos controlled the Lesnoy shell companies and had sought to prevent the
payment of their overdue taxes by dissolving them. The tax authorities thus
understandably applied to the Moscow Arbitrazh Court in April 2004 for
enforcement of Yukos’ 2000 tax liability and for an injunction prohibiting Yukos
from selling or encumbering the company’s shareholdings in its Russian
subsidiaries,

49.

As the ECtHR held, the authorities’ actions were neither arbitrary nor unfair:

“[T]he Ministry’s action was lodged under the rule which made it unnecessary to
wait until the end of the grace period if there was evidence that the dispute was
insoluble and, regard being had to the circumstances of the case, [the Court] finds
no indication of arbitrariness or unfairness [...] in this connection.” [emphases
added]

The April injunction did not affect Yukos’ use of its substantial on- and off-shore
cash resources, and did not affect Yukos’ offshore assets at all. Yukos nonetheless
falsely claimed that the injunction prevented Yukos from paying its taxes, again
evidencing its lack of good faith and credibility.

No further enforcement efforts were taken for more than two months. During this
period, Yukos continued to generate close to US$ 2 billion each month in gross
receipts that Yukos partly transferred off-shore and partly used to voluntarily pay its
loan to GML’s Moravel shell subsidiary -- but not to pay its tax liabilities.

Yukos also began a pattern of diminishing the value of its assets, often to the benefit
of Claimants and the Oligarchs whose interests they represented. For example,
Yukos forced its prod subsidiaries to Yukos’ already

US$ 1.6 billion loan from Moravel, corroborating the concerns that had led the
authorities to obtain the April injunction.

Following Yukos’ failure to make (or even to promise to make) any tax payments,
as well as its dissipation of substantial assets, Russia’s bailiffs finally attached a
number of Yukos’ on-shore bank accounts at the end of June 2004 -- ten weeks after
the April tax assessment and 26 weeks after Yukos’ legal advisors advised that it
needed to be prepared to pay promptly. It was only then that Yukos began to pay
some, but not all, of its taxes.

The authorities also sought to seize Yukos’ shares in its production subsidiaries to
prevent Yukos from encumbering them. True to form, Yukos attempted to frustrate
the bailiffs’ efforts by terminating the share registry company contract for its
production subsidiaries and concealing their registries, directing that they be sent
from central Moscow to remote locations around the country.

 

 

 

Yukos also took steps to reduce the value of its largest production subsidiary, YNG.
First, Yukos caused YNG to stop paying its mineral extraction taxes, imperiling its
production licenses. Second, Yukos and its trading shells stopped paying YNG for
its crude oil, leaving YNG with more than USS 4 billion in unpaid invoices. And
third, Yukos continued to divert funds to GML, its majority shareholder, arranging
for the payment of more than US$ 700 million to Moravel, even after the cash
freeze orders were in place.

Yukos also made a series of bad faith offers to “settle” a portion of its tax liabilities,
repeatedly offering Sibneft shares as a partial payment or as security for proposed
future payment, even though Russian law did not allow payment in kind, Yukos’
title to the proffered shares had been challenged by a third-party, and an injunction
had been issued (at the request of the third-party) prohibiting their sale or
encumbrance.

 

During this entire period, nothing prevented Yukos from selling its assets subject to
the bailiffs’ approval and using the proceeds to pay its tax obligations.

Thus, the authorities found themselves confronted by a company that was fiercely
resisting the payment of its overdue taxes, that had previously obstructed its tax
audit, lied to the tax authorities and courts, and attempted to make itself and its
subsidiaries judgment proof, and that was now burdening the tax authorities’
principal security -- YNG -- with new liabilities. In these circumstances, the
bailiffs understandably decided to sell a majority of YNG’s shares -- the only

-40-

realistic way to timely collect Yukos’ unpaid taxes. Despite criticizing the bailiff’
for not adequately documenting their decision-making process, the ECtHR
concluded that the bailiffs’ actions were not unreasonable. It is commonplace in
other countries too for tax collection authorities to sell first the assets that best
ensure payment.

The sale of the YNG shares was carried out in accordance with Russian law and
consistent with international practice. The authorities could have sold the shares to a
designated purchaser in a directly negotiated transaction, but instead granted Yukos’
request that the shares be auctioned. A formal and careful appraisal was conducted
by DKW, and the starting price for the auction was set at a level consistent with
DKW’s appraisal, taking account of the fact that only 76.79% of the company’s
shares were sold and that YNG had its own outstanding tax liabilities. All bidders,
foreign or domestic, were welcome to participate.

Claimants and Yukos did all they could to prevent the auction from succeeding,
threatening a “lifetime of litigation” against anyone who participated in or
facilitated the sale. Yukos also initiated sham bankruptcy proceedings in Houston,
obtaining a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) that prevented all the previously
announced bidders and all of their banks from participating in the auction. If the
price achieved was lower than it might otherwise have been, the fault lies solely
with Claimants and Yukos.

The YNG auction achieved a price of approximately US$ 9.4 billion, US$ 500
million more than the starting price. This result was consistent with the shares’
appraised value and contemporaneous fair market value estimates.

The evidence does not support Claimants’ contention that the winning bidder,
Baikal Finance, conspired with Rosneft. Rather, Baikal Finance found itself unable
to finance its winning bid because of the Houston court’s TRO, and thus at risk of
losing its US$ 1.7 billion deposit unless a substitute purchaser, not dependent on
immediate bank financing, could be found on very short notice. Rosneft simply
seized a commercial opportunity that presented itself as a result of Claimants’
misconduct.

The net proceeds of the YNG sale were not sufficient to meet all of Yukos’ tax
obligations. The Russian authorities nonetheless gave Yukos ample time to pay the
remaining balance, but it declined to do so, making clear that its priority was to
place assets behind the shield of the Dutch stichtings.

The Russian Federation Acted Properly In Connection With Yukos’
Bankruptcy, Which Was Precipitated By Yukos’ Failure To Pay Its Debts To
The SocGen Syndicate, And Is Not Attributable To The Russian Federation

Claimants’ bankruptcy-related claims fail because critical conduct essential to these
claims was taken by actors for which the Russian Federation is not responsible,
including the SocGen syndicate, YNG, Rosneft, the Federal Tax Service acting as
creditor, the meeting and committee of Yukos’ creditors, Yukos’ interim manager
and bankruptcy receiver, the participants in Yukos’ bankruptcy auctions, and the
purchasers of the auctioned assets sold. In taking the actions complained of by
Claimants, none of these actors was exercising sovereign authority or acting
pursuant to the direction or control of sovereign authority. Claimants have provided
no evidence on which the Tribunal could make a contrary finding.

Yukos’ dilatory and obstructionist treatment of its commercial creditors paralleled
closely its treatment of the tax authorities. In both instances, Yukos (a) falsely
claimed it was unable to meet its obligations, (b) forced its creditors to pursue their
claims in multiple court proceedings where Yukos presented unsubstantiated
defenses, (c) offered to negotiate with its creditors only when they were close to
collecting their claims, (d) made unrealistic settlement proposals that were

63.

subsequently withdrawn, and (e) together with its controlling shareholders,
resisted all collection efforts, ing more aggressive action on the
part of its creditors.

Both sides agree that Yukos’ bankruptcy was initiated by the SocGen syndicate,
based upon Yukos’ failure to pay an outstanding English court judgment after it was
recognized in Russia.

The SocGen syndicate simultaneously also sought payment of the same debt from
Rosneft pursuant to the 2004 loan guarantee that Yukos had foisted on YNG, which
Rosneft then owned. Although Rosneft disputed the validity of the guarantee,
Rosneft required forbearance from the same banks on covenant breaches arising
from the YNG acquisition, and Rosneft needed the banks’ cooperation for its
planned IPO. The convergence of the syndicate’s and Rosneft’s commercial
interests resulted in their agreeing that Rosneft would pay the syndicate in full, but
only after the syndicate had pursued all legal avenues to obtain payment from
Yukos, the primary obligor. If Rosneft instead paid, the syndicate’s rights under the
loan agreement were to be assigned to Rosneft.

Claimants ack ledge that this was i ivated and on

commercial terms, but contend that its confidentiality clause evidences a conspiracy
on the part of the SocGen syndicate to act secretly on behalf of Rosneft, which
Claimants improperly equate with Respondent. The confidentiality clause, however,
was itself a standard commercial term necessary to preserve the possibility that
Yukos would pay the SocGen syndicate before Rosneft became unconditionally
obligated to do so, and remained in effect only for so long as Yukos’ payment
would have discharged Rosneft’s own obligation to pay the syndicate.

Yukos satisfied the criteria for bankruptcy under Russian law due to its persistent
failure to pay its commercial creditors, and was insolvent long before the
proceedings were commenced. This is also undisputed.

The proceedings were conducted in compliance with Russian law and international
practice. The courts properly allowed the Federal Tax Service’s, Rosneft’s and
YNG?s claims, and substantial amounts of YNG’s claims were never disputed by
Yukos. Belying Claimants’ discrimination charge, the courts also allowed some
Yukos related-party claims, but properly rejected other abusive claims, such as the
Moravel loan, a barely disguised attempt to turn equity into debt.

Yukos’ management, actively supported by Claimants, had the opportunity to
present a rehabilitation plan to the meeting of creditors. The rough outline
management submitted was, however, legally defective and did not provide any
basis for creditors to prefer rehabilitation to liquidation. It was not properly
presented to or approved by Yukos’ shareholders, did not meet the legal
requirement that the company’s tax claims be satisfied within six months, and did
not ensure full, let alone timely, payment of Yukos’ creditors’ claims.

Once Yukos’ liquidation was properly approved, the company’s assets were sold at
auction in accordance with Russian law and international practice. Yukos’ receiver
obtained appraisals for the fair value of the assets, and used those appraisals to set
minimum bids in the auctions, all of which were exceeded, some by very large
margins. The auctions were open to domestic and foreign bidders, adequately
noticed and advertised, and competitive. To the extent that any bidders may have
been discouraged from participating, this was again the result of Claimants and
Yukos having threatened potential bidders with legal action. While the aggregate
results exceeded Yukos’ own (and other) contemporaneous fair market value
estimates, more than US$ 9 billion in creditor claims nonetheless remained
unsatisfied.

Claimants Have Failed To Establish Sine Qua Non Elements Of Their Article
13 And 10(1) ECT Claims

A. Article 21 ECT

First, as an initial matter, Claimants’ claims must be based on measures outside the
taxation carve-out of Article 21(1) ECT or, alternatively, within Article 21(1) ECT,
but subject to one of the claw-backs of Article 21(2) to (5) ECT.

Taxation carve-outs such as this one fulfill plainly legitimate functions. They (a)
preserve the Contracting Parties’ sovereign power in the field of taxation, which is
of critical importance to the very existence of a State, (b) delineate the extensive
network of investment treaties from the even broader network of taxation treaties,
(c) pay due regard to the complexity of tax matters, and, in many cases, preserve the
coordination role of the competent tax authorities under double taxation treaties.

To fulfill these functions, taxation carve-outs are typically broad, covering all
aspects of tax regimes, including tax enforcement measures.

Article 21(1) ECT, under its plain meaning, covers the whole range of measures
taken by all branches of government in the field of taxation. Tax legislation and
enforcement measures are inextricably linked, and it is not possible to meaningfully
dissociate them in the context of Article 21(1) ECT.

The core allegations on which Claimants base their claims are squarely within the
scope of Article 21(1) ECT: tax audits, tax assessments, interest and fines provoked
by Yukos’ failure to pay its assessed taxes, measures to ensure the effective
collection of its taxes, and the sale of Yukos’ assets to satisfy its tax liabilities.

Claimants seek to avoid Article 21 ECT on two grounds, that Article 21(7)(a) ECT
limits the scope of the taxation carve-out to tax legislation and tax treaties and does
not apply to mala fide taxation measures. These arguments are baseless.

Article 21(7)(a) ECT contains an illustrative list of taxation measures that does not
replace the term “measures” with the term “provisions,” but underscores that the
term “Taxation Measures” covers all aspects of the tax regime, including
international and domestic measures.

Claimants’ position that Article 21(1) ECT is inapplicable to the taxation measures
they complain about fails as a matter of fact and law. The record shows that the
taxation measures at issue were a justified response to Yukos” massive tax fraud
and its willful strategy to obstruct efforts to collect the taxes due. As a matter of
law, Claimants mix two issues, the concept and definition of “Taxation Measures,”
on the one hand, and their legality, on the other. Legality is determined under Part
III of the ECT, but only to the extent of the claw-backs pursuant to Article 21(2) to
(5) ECT.

Article 21 ECT contains no claw-back for Article 10(1) ECT, and the Tribunal
therefore lacks jurisdiction over core allegations of Claimants’ Article 10(1) ECT
claims.

Article 21(5) ECT contains a claw-back for Article 13 ECT claims, but is applicable
only to “taxes,” and is combined with a mandatory referral to the competent tax
authorities, a procedure invoked by Respondent in these proceedings. The
expropriation claw-back, in its ordinary meaning, supported by the travaux
préparatoires, applies to charges imposed by the State for public purposes,

tax and collection measures. When to the varying
practices with respect to Sinwbacks | in taxation carve-outs, the deliberate choice of
the ECT negotiating States to reinstate expropriatory “taxes” represents a middle
ground, which must be respected.

B. Article 13(1) ECT

In order to establish their claim for a breach of Article 13(1) ECT, Claimants must
show that, in addition to being outside the scope of the taxation carveout of Article
21(1) ECT -- or within Article 21(1) ECT, but reinstated by Article 21(5) ECT --
the measures complained of must be “measures having effect equivalent to
nationalization or expropriation.”

First, Claimants have failed to establish that conduct not carved-out by Article 21
ECT that is (a) attributable to Respondent, and (b) an exercise of its sovereign
power caused a total or near total deprivation of Claimants’ investment. Critically,
the core allegations of Claimants’ claims are outside the scope of Article 13(1) ECT
by virtue of Article 21 ECT. Moreover, Yukos itself engaged in conduct -- by
refusing to pay the assessments against it when due, while preserving its right to
challenge them — that directly resulted in the company’s demise and the ensuing
loss of Claimants’ investments. Finally, conduct that was essential to Yukos’
liquidation, including in particular the filing of the bankruptcy petition by the
SocGen syndicate, and the creditors’ meeting decision to liquidate Yukos, is not
expropriatory because it is not attributable to Respondent under the rules of State
responsibility, or does not involve an exercise of sovereign power.

Second, Claimants have failed to establish that the measures complained of
frustrated distinct, reasonable, investment-backed expectations, an important
element in ing whether regulatory measures amount to “measures having
effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation.” Claimants had no right or
legitimate expectation to operate Yukos in violation of Russian law, and no right or
legitimate expectation that Respondent would exempt Yukos from the tax
enforcement and collection measures about which Claimants complain if Yukos
failed to pay its taxes and obstructed the collection of taxes due.

 

 

In particular, Claimants have failed to establish that Respondent at any time made a
representation, based upon complete disclosure, that it would allow Yukos to
operate its fraudulent tax evasion scheme or refrain from enforcing and collecting
the taxes Yukos owed. Yukos’ tax evasion scheme was illegal under Russian law
when Claimants made their investments, and the tax enforcement and collection
measures taken against Yukos were all provided for by Russian law at that time.
The bad faith taxpayer anti-abuse doctrine that Respondent’s tax authorities and
courts applied to counter Yukos’ tax evasion dates back to the mid 1990s, well
before Claimants acquired their Yukos shares.

Third, putting aside the other elements required to establish “measures having effect
equivalent to nationalization or expropriation,” the executive and judicial measures
at issue, in any event, constitute a legitimate exercise of Respondent's regulatory
power.

The measures alleged to be expropriatory are well within the range of what is
generally accepted as a legitimate exercise of States’ police powers. First,
Respondent has established that the measures complained of accord in all material
respects with international and comparative standards.

Second, the measures challenged by Claimants conform with Russian law, which in
turn accords with international standards, and have been reviewed and upheld by
multiple levels of Respondent’s judiciary, including the Russian Supreme Court.

Third, the European Court of Human Rights has found that the very same measures
Claimants allege to be expropriatory were a legitimate exercise of Respondent’s
regulatory power.

Fourth, the measures complained of must be assessed in their proper context --
Yukos’ massive tax evasion, compounded by its illegal and deliberate strategy to
frustrate any effort by the authorities to collect the company’s overdue taxes.

- 44 -

Vil.

90.

Contrary to Claimants’ perception, respect for the rule of law is not a oneway-street.
Foreign investors have a duty to abide by the law, pay taxes, provide required
disclosures of their activities in the host State, and cooperate with the authorities.

Measures taken to combat illegal conduct may legitimately result in the loss of an
investment. Yukos’ tax evasion scheme violated Russian law, and the assessment of
the evaded taxes was a legitimate measure to combat Yukos’ fraud. The resulting
tax enforcement and collection measures were completely justified in light of
Yukos’ failure to pay the assessed taxes and its willful obstruction of Respondent’s
collection efforts. Indeed, none of the subsequent enforcement measures, including
the auction of YNG, would have occurred, and Yukos would not have been
liquidated, had Yukos acted as a responsible taxpayer should have done.

C. Article 10(1) ECT

Claimants’ Article 10(1) ECT claims fail for many of the same reasons as their
expropriation claim. At the threshold, the core allegations on which Claimants base
their Article 10(1) ECT claims are within the taxation carve-out of Article 21(1)
ECT. The Tribunal therefore lacks jurisdiction over these claims and Article 10(1)
ECT is inapplicable.

Again, at the threshold, critical conduct alleged to be unlawful under Article 10(1)
ECT is not attributable to Respondent or not an exercise of sovereign authority. The
harm attributed to Respondent’s alleged breaches of Article 10(1) ECT, the loss of
Claimants’ Yukos shares, was caused by Yukos’ own misconduct and conduct of
third parties not attributable to Respondent. Claimants have failed to show that any
of the irregularities they allege in the administrative and judicial proceedings at
issue affected the outcome of the case, the liquidation of Yukos, and the ensuing
loss of Claimants’ shares.

In any event, Claimants have failed to establish that the challenged measures
interfered with their legitimate expectations at the time they made their investment
or were not taken in the proper exercise of the authorities’ statutory duties. The
contested measures (a) accord with international and comparative standards, (b)
were reviewed and upheld by the Russian courts, and (c) have been assessed by the
ECTHR to be a legitimate exercise of Respondent’s taxation power.

Finally, but no less important, the host State’s conduct under Article 10(1) ECT
cannot be assessed in isolation from that of the investor or its investment. Yukos’
massive tax fraud and illegal obstruction of the efforts to collect the taxes it owed
provoked the measures complained of, which were justified responses to combat
Yukos’ illegal conduct and enforce overdue taxes. None of the measures at issue
can therefore be said to be arbitrary, unfair, or inequitable for purposes of Article
10(1) ECT.

Nor are such measures discriminatory within the meaning of Article 10(1) ECT.
Article 10(1) ECT does not establish a right of impunity based on the host State’s
authorities’ alleged failure to enforce mandatory legal requirements, and Claimants
have in any event failed to show nationality-based discrimination, or unjustified
differential treatment of similar cases.

The Tribunal Lacks Jurisdiction Over Claimants’ Claims Concerning The
Alleged Mistreatment Of Messrs. Khodorkovsky And Lebedev And Other
Yukos Officials, And In Any Event, These Claims, And Claims Concerning
Searches Of Yukos Records, Are Unsupported

The Tribunal should reject Claimants’ attempt to distract its attention from the only
matter that is genuinely at issue in these arbitrations -- Claimants’ investments in
Yukos, and the consequences for those investments of Yukos’ tax evasion scheme -

-45-

91.

VUL.

94.

95.

96.

- with extensive allegations concerning the arrests and prosecution of Yukos
officials and searches and seizures of the company’s records.

First, the Tribunal cannot assert jurisdiction under Article 26 ECT to address
alleged violations of the rights of Yukos officials, because Claimants have not
proven that any such violations directly impaired Claimants’ management or control
of their investments. To the contrary, Yukos expressly confirmed after Mr.
Khodorkovsky’s arrest and subsequent resignation that they had “no impact
whatsoever on [its] operations,” and Mr. Lebedev did not even hold a position with
Yukos at that time. The prosecutions of Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev
likewise did not impair Yukos’ performance, which the company informed its
investors in 2005 “was extremely healthy.”

Claimants have also failed to establish that the prosecutions of any Yukos officials
reflect a systemic failure of the Russian judicial system or, at a minimum, were
fundamentally unjustified or groundless. To the contrary, all were reviewed by the
Russian courts at multiple levels, and by the ECtHR (with respect to the initiation of
Mr. Khodorkovsky’s prosecution), and were found to be in accord with Russian law
and international standards. Tellingly, Claimants have never disputed that Mr.
Khodorkovsky, Mr. Lebedev, or any of the other Yukos officials who were
convicted of crimes related to their management of Yukos, actually committed
those crimes, relying instead on conclusory complaints about various procedural
matters, based on mischaracterizations of the pertinent facts.

Finally, Claimants have not established that the searches of certain of Yukos’
offices and the seizure of certain of its records pursuant to the official investigations
of its misconduct were expropriatory, evidence a systemic judicial failure, or were
otherwise fundamentally unjustified or groundless. This allegation is at best ironic,
in light of Yukos’ unrelenting obstruction of those investigations. It is also
unsustainable. All of these procedures conformed to Russian law, and Yukos’ own
contemporaneous public statements and internal documents confirm that Yukos
itself did not believe they had any significant impact on the company.

 

The Tribunal Lacks Jurisdiction Over Claimants’ Claims, Or Must Dismiss
Them, Because They Are Based On Illegal Conduct By Claimants And The
Yukos Managers They Installed And Controlled

The Oligarchs who controlled Claimants acquired and consolidated their
investments in Yukos through illegal acts and bad faith conduct, and thereafter
perpetrated -- either directly or through the Yukos managers they installed and
controlled -- a long series of illegal acts, including the tax evasion that is at the heart
of these arbitrations.

Claimants contend that these illegalities are “collateral” or “unrelated to” their
investments, even though they relate to the acquisition or enhancement of the value
of Yukos, or to Claimants’ own unlawful abuse of the Russia-Cyprus Tax Treaty.
Through that abuse, Claimants themselves fraudulently evaded -- in violation of
both Russian and Cypriot criminal laws -- more than US$ 230 million in Russian
withholding taxes, and more than triple that amount in Russian profit taxes.

This history of repeated illegal conduct by Claimants -- culminating in the diversion
of assets worth billions of dollars to the illegally-created Dutch stichtings, placing
those assets beyond the reach of the Russian tax authorities -- deprives the Tribunal
of jurisdiction over Claimants’ claims, because ECT protection does not extend to
illegal investments, or requires that the Tribunal dismiss those claims under the
principle of unclean hands. The Tribunal should reject Claimants’ attack on the
existence of the principle of unclean hands in international law, as well as their
baseless charge that Respondent is estopped from raising Claimants’ illegalities.

Claimants Have Failed To Establish Any Entitlement To Damages

Claimants are not entitled to any compensation, in light of (a) their own illegal
conduct, including their and the Oligarchs’ illegal acquisition and consolidation of
their ownership and control of Yukos, their abuse of the Russia-Cyprus Tax Treaty,
and their implementation of Yukos’ tax evasion scheme, and (b) Yukos’ failure to
mitigate its tax liability, and Yukos’ and Claimants’ actions to prevent the
collection of Yukos’ overdue taxes.

Claimants are not entitled to any compensation for acts of the Russian Federation
that are within the carve-out of Article 21(1) ECT and not within the clawback of
Article 21(5) ECT.

Claimants also are not entitled to any compensation based on Yukos’ claimed value
at any given point in time, because they have failed to demonstrate any causal link
between any diminution in Yukos’ then-supposed value and specific violations of
the ECT. Claimants’ “all-or-nothing” approach does not provide a means by which
the Tribunal can (a) assess whether the Russian Federation’s actions constituted an
“expropriation,” or (b) quantify the damages, if any, arising in the event some, but
not all, of the measures Claimants complain about are found to violate the ECT.
This is the inevitable result of Claimants’ failure to present a damages measure, but
instead a static valuation, devoid of any causation analysis.

 

Claimants’ valuations also fail on their own terms, because they are entirely
dependent on Claimants’ unsustainable valuation date of November 21, 2007.

Claimants and their expert concede that the valuations presented in their opening
submissions are infected by numerous material errors. These errors fatally
undermine Claimants’ core assertions and render Claimants’ evidence unreliable for
any purpose. The revised valuations submitted in Claimants’ Reply are likewise
riddled with errors and are manifestly result-driven, leaving Claimants with no
competent evidence of damages at all. This is true, too, of their “method of
collection” scenarios, which are unsupportable and fail of their own terms.

Once Yukos chose not to mitigate its tax liability during the first quarter of 2004 -
- by paying no more than US$ 9.8 billion, capping its tax exposure at that amount
and avoiding all of the subsequent enforcement measures -- there was no realistic
means by which Yukos could have paid all of its liabilities, let alone continued in
business as a going concern. Claimants’ failure to mitigate is a further reason why
their damages model, based on the claimed value of Yukos as of a given date,
does not provide a meaningful measure of damages. Thus, even if the Tribunal
were to conclude that an award of damages is warranted, it must be capped at
Claimants’ proportionate interest in the amount, if any, of Yukos’ unavoidable
liabilities -- not more than USS 9.8 billion -- that the Tribunal concludes were
improperly assessed.

Claimants’ damages claim represents a 58% compound annual rate of return on
their investment in Yukos. Claimants’ requested rate of return fails to take account
of Claimants’, the Oligarchs’, and Yukos’ unlawful misconduct and is well beyond
that which any legitimate investor would have earned.

Measured against a reasonable return on investment, and after taking account of the
returns on their investment in Yukos that Claimants have already received (not to
mention the fruits of their ill-gotten gains and assets secreted offshore), Claimants
have not incurred any damages at all.

APPLICABLE LAW
PROCEDURAL LAW

The procedural law to be applied by the Tribunal consists of the procedural provisions of the
ECT (particularly Article 26), the UNCITRAL Rules of 1976, and, because The Hague is the
place of arbitration, any mandatory provisions of Dutch arbitration law. The Final Awards are

made pursuant to Article 1049 of the Netherlands Arbitration Act 1986.

SUBSTANTIVE LAW

The substantive law to be applied by the Tribunal consists of the substantive provisions of the
ECT, the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (“VCLT”)? and applicable rules and
principles of international law, including those authoritatively set out in the Articles on
Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts of the International Law
Commission of the United Nations (“ILC Articles on State Responsibility”).'” In addition to
the foregoing sources, the national law of the Russian Federation is relevant with regard to

certain issues.

Throughout this Award, the Tribunal refers to and analyzes specific provisions of the ECT. For
ease of reference, the key relevant provisions are also collected and reproduced below, in the
order in which they appear in the Treaty:

Exh. C-1681 (hereinafter “ILC Articles on State Responsibility”). The full text of the ILC Articles, along with parts of
the official commentary, was also submitted submitted by Respondent. See Exhs. R-1031 and R-4235. The Tribunal
is aware that Part II of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, which sets out the consequences of internationally
wrongful acts, is concerned with claims between States and may not directly apply to ci involving persons or
entities other than States. That being said, the ILC Articles reflect customary international law in the matter of state
responsibility, and to the extent that a matter is not ruled by the ECT and there are no circumstances commanding
otherwise, the Tribunal will turn to the ILC Articles on State Responsibility for guidance. The Tribunal further notes
that both Parties have cited to and relied on Parts I and II of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility in their
submissions.

SUMMARY OF WITNESS TESTIMONY

In the merits phase of these proceedings, Claimants and Respondent each submitted statements

or opinions from 11 witnesses.'' In all, the Tribunal has reviewed over 1,400 pages of written

testimony, as well as thousands of exhibits to the witness statements and opinions.

The purpose of the present part of the Award is to provide an overview of the witnesses’
evidence. It is not meant to be exhaustive. Rather, it serves as a summary of the vast
evidentiary foundation on which the Tribunal has reached its conclusions. Additional
references to witness testimony, including specific extracts of their oral examinations, are set

out in the relevant portions of the Tribunal’s analysis of the evidentiary record.'?

The Tribunal has considered the evidence of those witnesses that were cross-examined, as well
as those witnesses who submitted written statements but were not called to the Hearing. With

respect to this latter category, the Tribunal has kept in mind that these witnesses were not

Having initially submitted statements or opinions from 12 witnesses, on 4 October 2012, shortly before the Hearing on
the Merits, Claimants notified the Tribunal that one of their witnesses, the former Prime Minister of the Russian
Federation, Mr. Mikhail Kasyanov, had informed them that he would not appear at the Hearing and that, in the
circumstances, Claimants would withdraw his witness statement. Mr. Kasyanov’s witness statement has been filed on
3 September 2010 and consisted of a two-paragraph confirmation of the contents of the following document:

submitted as independently-numbered exhibits with the Memorial. Respondent’s position at the Hearing was that the
documents annexed to Mr. Kasyanov’s witness statement could not be considered by the Tribunal (Transcript, Day 18
at 19-21). Claimants maintained that the exhibits stood on their own as part of the record in these arbitrations. The
Tribunal has decided that while Mr. Kasyanov’s witness statement itself was withdrawn and thus no longer forms part of
the record, the documents annexed to the statement, which have come into the record as independent exhibits to the
Memorial, and include statements made by Mr. Kasyanov prior to these proceedings, continue to form part of the record
of these arbitrations.

CLAIMANTS’ WITNESSES

At the Hearing on the Merits, Respondent called 8 of Claimants’ 11 witnesses for examination.

They were, in the order in which they testified:

1) Mr. Jacques Kosciusko-Morizet;
2) Mr. Vladimir Dubov;

3) Mr. Frank Rieger;

4) Dr. Andrei Illarionov;

5) Mr. Leonid Nevzlin;

6) Mr. Bruce Misamore;

7) Mr. Steven Theede; and

8) Mr. Brent Kaczmarek CFA.

Claimants’ other witnesses, who did not appear for cross-examination, were:

9) Mr. Philip Baker QC;

10) Mr. Yuri Schmidt; and

11) Dr. Sergei Kovalev.
The following summary first addresses the testimony of Claimants’ eight witnesses who
appeared before the Tribunal, in order of appearance. It then reviews the evidence from

Claimants’ three witnesses whom Respondent chose not to cross-examine.

1. Mr. Jacques Kosciusko-Morizet

Mr. Jacques Kosciusko-Morizet'? was a Member of the Board of Directors of Yukos and the
Chairman of the Board’s Audit Committee from June 2000 to December 2004. In his witness
statement, Mr. Kosciusko-Morizet describes Mr. Khodorkovsky’s plans in the late 1990s “to
modernize Yukos and to break the company’s ties with the Soviet traditions” through a Western
board and consolidation of Yukos’ accounts. According to Mr. Kosciusko-Morizet, the reforms
brought success: Yukos’ shares increased in value by 50 percent after it published U.S.
Generally Accepted Account Principles (“U.S. GAAP”) consolidated financial statements in

July 2000, and its leadership in transparency and corporate governance brought the verb

“to Yukosize” into common parlance in Russian business circles.

Mr. Kosciusko-Morizet’s statement also deals with the relationship with PwC, which he
describes as “cordial and close” while he was Chairman of the Audit Committee. Yukos was

one of PwC’s major clients; PwC conducted Yukos’ external audits and assisted with training

 

Yukos’ in-house ac and with designing and impl ing p d Thus, he
testifies, “from 1997 to 2004, PwC was given access to the entire documentation of the whole
of Yukos without restriction and had a very detailed and global view of the financial situation

and the procedures of Yukos and its subsidiaries.”"*

After the arrest of Mr. Platon Lebedev in July 2003, Mr. Kosciusko-Morizet chaired a
temporary ad hoc committee set up to assess the situation through interviews with individual
managers at Yukos and PwC. He states that Mr. Michael Kubena, a PwC partner, assured the
committee that Yukos had always complied with Russian law, including in its tax optimization
structure, and that “PwC did not consider that there was any possibility for the Russian

wl

authorities to attack Yukos on these issues. Mr.Kosciusko-Morizet referred to this advice

several times during his oral testimony. Thus, according to Mr. Kosciusko-Morizet, the “late

and spectacular volte-face of PwC,” including the withdrawal of the certification of Yukos’
accounts that took place on 15 June 2007, was “in blatant contradiction” to his relationship with
PwC, was “questionable and damaging to [PwC’s] reputation,” and can only be explained by

Respondent’s pressure on PwC’s Moscow office from December 2006 onwards.

Mr. Kosciusko-Morizet appeared before the Tribunal on 15 October 2012. He was cross-
examined about, inter alia: (a) his responsibilities as the Chairman of Yukos’ Audit
Committee; (b) the relationship between Yukos and PwC including as to disclosures about
Behles Petroleum S.A., Baltic Petroleum Trading Limited and South Petroleum Limited
(known collectively as the “BBS Companies”); (c) the Yukos consolidation perimeter for
purposes of U.S. GAAP; (d) the abandoned plans to list Yukos on the New York Stock
Exchange (“NYSE”) due to the Yukos—Sibneft merger; and (e) his knowledge of Yukos’ tax
optimization structures and the tax assessments against regional Yukos trading entities (in

which context he remarked that “[t]rying to minimise tax is good management . . . within the

legislation applicable.”)'°

Mr. Kosciusko-Morizet was also given the opportunity to recount to the Tribunal a story that
Mr. Khodorkovsky had conveyed to him in August 2003 about threats from the Russian

authorities and their potential impact on Yukos.'”

2. Mr. Vladimir Dubov

Mr. Vladimir Dubov'* held various senior positions in Bank Menatep and Yukos entities,
including on the Yukos Board from 1998 to 1999. He was elected as a State Duma Deputy in
December 1999 (representing a region encompassing Mordovia) and was Chairman of the Tax
Sub-Committee of the State Duma from February 2000 to October 2003. From 1997 he was a
shareholder, and then a beneficiary of trusts holding shares in GML Limited (“GML”) (the
parent company of YUL). He first met Mr. Khodorkovsky in the late 1980s. In his witness
statement, Mr. Dubov makes three key assertions: (a) Respondent was aware of, and approved
Yukos’ trading structure and tax optimization scheme; (b) Yukos’ trading companies
significantly contributed to the social and economic development of the regions in which they
operated; and (c) Respondent’s tax claims were aimed at appropriating Yukos’ assets and

removing Mr. Khodorkovsky as a “potential political threat”.

Mr. Dubov explains in his statement that, given that Yukos’ tax payments accounted for
approximately four percent of the country’s 2003 budget, the company was under “constant
supervision and control of the Russian tax authorities.”'” Before 2003 there was never “any
suggestion that Yukos’ trading structure was other than in compliance with legal requirements
and appropriate.”””. The authorities were extensively consulted and approved Yukos’ practice
of operating through trading companies in low-tax regions like the Republic of Mordovia.
Yukos’ trading companies significantly contributed to the local economy. Yukos’ trading

companies’ VAT refunds were also closely monitored. According to Mr. Dubov, all four major

testimony appear in Chapters VIILA (The Tax Optimization Scheme), VIILB (The Tax Assessments Starting in
December 2003) and VIIL.C (Harrassment, Intimidation and Arrests).

Russian oil companies (Lukoil, Sibneft, TNK, Yukos) engaged in tax optimization. Their taxes
were closely supervised. Access to pipelines was conditioned on payment of taxes. This

involved liaising with officials and opening up records to inspection.”!

Mr. Dubov describes how he and Mr. Khodorkovsky became increasingly involved in social
and political activities to build a civil society based on “liberal, open and democratic values”
and in 2001 co-founded Open Russia to manage and fund projects to foster a “social and liberal
ethos.”” Mr. Khodorkovsky’s funding of political parties openly and legally “put pressure on
other political parties to be more transparent.” These efforts “sent shockwaves through the
entire Russian political system.””>

Mr. Dubov expresses “no doubt that the alleged tax claims and the other trumped-up charges
brought against Yukos, Khodorkovsky and his associates, were merely a pretext to remove
Khodorkovsky as a potential political threat and to destroy Yukos with a view to taking its

assets.”** According to Mr. Dubov’s statement, as the 2004 presidential elections approached,
the Administration shifted attention to seizing Yukos’ assets. At a meeting of the Russian
Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs with President Putin at the Kremlin in February 2003,
Mr. Khodorkovsky raised questions about official corruption. President Putin rebuked him and
suggested that Yukos be scrutinized. At an April 2003 meeting, President Putin approved the
Sibneft merger but warned that Mr. Khodorkovsky should restrict his political activities and not
finance the Communist Party. In October 2003, Mr. Khodorkovsky was arrested just before a

planned meeting with opposition parties.”*

Mr. Dubov testifies that, on 27 October 2003, he learned his name had been removed as a
Duma candidate. He was advised to leave Russia and was told by a Kremlin official that
President Putin “had gone absolutely berserk over Khodorkovsky.””° He left that night and has
not returned since. In January 2004, the financial support of Messrs. Dubov and Nevzlin to an

opposition presidential candidate was announced. The next day, international arrest warrants

were issued against both men on “entirely unfounded and politically motivated” charges. They

were both found guilty in absentia.”

Mr. Dubov appeared before the Tribunal for examination on 16 October 2012. He was cross-
examined about his financial interest in the case, being the beneficiary of the Draco Trust, in
which had made an initial investment of around USD 10,000 and which now has a seven
percent interest in GML.** He was also extensively cross-examined about the extent of
disclosures he made to Russian government officials about Yukos’ tax scheme in Mordovia and
his knowledge and understanding about the Yukos trading entities in the ZATOs and the tax

assessments leveled against them.”

Mr. Dubov stated his belief, held since he heard about the tax assessments against Yukos in

2004 from media reports, that the tax claims were being used by Respondent as an instrument

30

of confiscation.” When asked by the Tribunal to elaborate on what information at the time led

him to that conclusion, he testified:

Thad a personal relationship with the Deputy Head of Staff of the President, Mr. Vladislav
Surkov.... [O]n the first business day following Khodorkovsky’s arrest, Surkov asked
me to come see him in the Kremlin... He told me that he was asking for my
forgiveness .... I had been struck from the list upon petition from the Prosecutor General
by the council of the party without leveling any charges against me.... And I remember
asking, “What will happen to Yukos?” And he said—and I am quoting him verbatim;
Iremember it very well—he said, “Yukos will be taken away from... you
gentlemen.” ... And [ also had a longstanding good relationship with yet another Deputy
Head of the Staff of the President who, in late November of that year, told us .. . there
would be criminal claims against every single shareholder. He said that an instruction had
been issued to commence criminal cases against us and to take Yukos from us.*!

3. Mr. Frank Rieger

and its subsidiaries from 2000 until 2006. He resigned on 26 March 2006, due to the

“deepening crisis surrounding the company and the persecution of its management.” In his
witness statement, Mr. Rieger recounts that under Mr. Khodorkovsky’s leadership, Yukos acted
as a “trail-blazer” in corporate governance in Russia. When Mr. Rieger joined Yukos in 2000
from Roland Berger Consulting, he was directed by Mr. Khodorkovsky to “apply the same
benchmark of Western corporate accountability and responsibility.” Yukos modernized its
production process, disclosed the company’s shareholding details, and implemented
international accounting and reporting procedures. Mr. Rieger states that Yukos “set a new
standard for corporate social responsibility in Russia” but its achievements provoked concern

amongst competitors.

According to Mr. Rieger, the Russian authorities targeted and harassed Yukos’ auditor, PwC.
Yukos engaged PwC as its external auditor and gave it “unrestricted access” to its “personnel,
management, the Board of Directors, books and accounts.” Mr. Rieger’s “personal

involvement with PwC was extensive.” After PwC employees began to be questioned by the
Prosecutor General’s Office, PwC ceased to have further contact with Yukos. Mr. Rieger
learned about PwC’s withdrawal of its Yukos audits from 1995 to 2004 from the media. The
suggestion that PwC did not have full access to information or that Yukos deliberately withheld
information “defies credibility”; PwC raised no such concerns until its June 2007 withdrawal

letter (“PwC’s Withdrawal Letter”).

According to Mr. Rieger, Yukos made numerous attempts to settle the alleged tax claims
against it, including through negotiations and significant payments. However, the Russian
authorities did not respond to Yukos’ various proposals, and refused to provide written
confirmation of the payments. It became clear to Mr. Rieger that “this was a political case, not

a tax case, aimed at the destruction and expropriation of the company itself.”

Mr. Rieger claims that Respondent conducted a campaign of harassment against Yukos, including
illegal raids by armed masked men, searches and seizures of up to 70 percent of the Accounting
Department’s documents. In addition, numerous Yukos employees were questioned by the
Prosecutor General’s Office. Mr. Rieger himself was detained and interrogated at Moscow’s

airport in May 2006.

Mr. Rieger appeared before the Tribunal for examination on 17 October 2012. He was cross-
examined about, inter alia: (a) his role at Yukos and understanding of its related entities;
(b) Yukos’ accounting structure including the extent to which it was designed by PwC; (c) the

timing and process of Yukos’ identification of assets for payment of taxes; (d) Yukos”

settlement offers, the responses from the Russian authorities and the legal limits within which
the authorities were operating; (e) the repayment of the SocGen and Moravel Investments
Limited (“Moravel”) loans, relevant to the bankruptcy; (f) dividend payments via the “Laurel”
group of Yukos companies; and (g) his awareness and understanding of tax assessment of

Yukos entities in the ZATOs.

Mr. Rieger was also given an opportunity to describe to the Tribunal how in 2006 he was asked
a series of questions at the General Prosecutor Office for which the investigator had already
prepared his answers, a situation he said he “couldn’t believe” had he not experienced it

himself. He refused to sign the pre-prepared answers and gave his own version instead.**

4, Dr. Andrei Illarionov

Dr. Andrei Illarionov™ served as Chief Economic Advisor to President Putin from April 2000
until his resignation in December 2005. He was also President Putin’s personal representative
(“sherpa”) to the G-8. He is currently a Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute’s Center for Global
Liberty and Prosperity in Washington, D.C., as well as the President of the Institute of
Economic Analysis in Moscow, which he founded. Dr. Ilarionov maintains a residence in
Moscow and visits approximately five times a year.** In his witness statement, Dr. Illarionov
recounts the evolution of Yukos since its establishment by government decree in 1993
following the dissolution of the USSR and the restructuring of the oil industry. Yukos saw
remarkable growth and improvements in performance after its privatization in 1995-96, as a
result of substantial investment, the employment of foreign engineers and managers, and the
use of Western technology. Some officials viewed such reforms negatively. Yukos’ public
revelation, in 2002, of details of its shareholding, including the structure of GML, “had the
effect of an earthquake on the Russian business community.” It contrasted with the

traditionally secretive manner of doing business and was viewed as setting a “harmful”

precedent. In Dr. Illarionov’s words, Yukos was “one of the most dangerous enemies for those
9936

who did not want to see Russia a free country.
According to Dr. Illarionov, the arrests of Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev and the
dismantlement of Yukos were politically and economically motivated. Yukos’ intended merger
with Western oil majors was seen as a national betrayal and a hurdle to expropriation.
Dr. Illarionov describes the 19 February 2003 meeting at the Kremlin between President Putin
and business leaders, at which Mr. Khodorkovsky made a presentation on corruption, to which
President Putin responded that everyone knew how various assets, including Yukos, were
acquired, and told Mr. Khodorkovsky: “I return the ball in your corner.” The tone of the
meeting became “steely and menacing” as if something had gone “really wrong.” It signaled
the “gloves [had come] off,” and that Mr. Khodorkovsky was no longer tolerated. From then
on, according to Dr. Illarionov, “a case needed to be fabricated to launch the Government
attack under the guise of ‘legitimate’ court proceedings” and a special unit was set up to
fabricate evidence against Yukos. In October 2003, the “dramatic arrest” of Mr. Khodorkovsky
at the airport signaled Yukos could be attacked. Few dared to voice support, and Prime

Minister Mikhail Kasyanov, among others, was dismissed for doing so.”

Dr. Illarionov’s statement further recounts that the campaign against Yukos culminated in the
confiscation of YNG. While it was independently valued at USD 14.7-17.3 billion, the
Russian authorities sold YNG for USD 9.3 billion—‘a price well below even the most
conservative estimates prepared by experts”—on a Sunday, at a forced auction attended by two
participants, to an unknown company (Baikal) which was registered at an address above a local
bar and had a charter capital of USD 350. President Putin said he knew the individuals behind
the company and they were “well-established in the oil business.” Four days later, Rosneft
purchased Baikal with funds from State banks. According to Dr. Illarionov, the auction “sent
shockwaves” and was internationally condemned. This “scam” was “one of the low points in
Russia’s recent history.” The dismantling of Yukos was contrary to “basic principles of due
process,” and led Dr. Illarionov to resign as sherpa in 2004 and as the President’s Chief

Economic Advisor in December 2005."

sought to undermine his credibility by showing he is now a vocal critic of the Russian
Government, and that he has taken extreme positions against climate change regulation.*””
Respondent also challenged his assertion that Yukos’ financial statements had complied with
U.S. GAAP, on the basis that Dr. Illarionov lacked an understanding of GAAP and had not read
Yukos’ financial statements in full. Dr. Illarionov was cross-examined mostly about his

claimed knowledge and understanding of the valuation of YNG and the auction process.“”

The Tribunal asked Dr. Illarionov whether he had ever felt able to discuss with President Putin
the arrest of Mr. Khodorkovsky and the measures of the Russian Government in respect of

Yukos.' He replied:

the most important conversation that I had with Mr. Putin was several days after
Mr. Khodorkovsky had been arrested .... Mr. Putin has said that Mr. Khodorkovsky has
made mistakes and behaved pretty badly .... And for a long time Mr. Putin himself was
protecting Mr. Khodorkovsky from these attacks of his friends, of Mr. Putin’s friends, but
unfortunately Mr. Khodorkovsky continued to behave badly, and not cooperatively... One
thing, he said that Mr. Khodorkovsky lied to us because he was in negotiations with
American oil company about possible merger. Another issue he has mentioned: that
Mr. Khodorkovsky joined Communist Party in preparation to the parliamentary election of
year 2003... That is not something that “mi dogovarivalis”—I will try, “we had an
agreement on.” So he said ..

So he said that after protecting Mr Khodorkovsky for some time—now it’s almost a
quotation—“I decided and I stepped aside to allow Mr Khodorkovsky to solve his

problems with the boys by himself.” ...."so Mr Khodorkovsky has chosen to fight.
Okay,” said Mr Putin, “if he has chosen to fight, let him to fight and we'll see what will
happen.”

The Tribunal also asked Dr. Illarionov about the 50-person special unit that, according to
paragraph 35 of his statement, was set up at the Russian General Prosecutor’s office to work
exclusively on “fabricating” evidence against Mr. Khodorkovsky and Yukos and, in particular,
whether he could identify the sources on which he relied for that statement. He could not
disclose the identity of his source—due to that individual still residing in Moscow and thus
facing “serious risks” but his source was a “very high-placed official in the Russian
administration at the time” and was very reliable.” Dr. Illarionov testified that the official had

told him that the targeting of Yukos was “a big mistake ... but it is a mistake that would be

impossible to stop.... This unit has been created to ‘zanyatsa’ Khodorkovsky, [meaning to]
‘take care of Khodorkovsky... which means one day... security services and officers did
receive an order so-called to solve the problem.”**

Dr. Illarionov elaborated on his assertion, at paragraph 41 of his statement, that Russian Prime
Minister Mikhail Kasyanov had “expressed his disapproval of Mr. Khodorkovsky’s arrest and

the mounting attack on Yukos”, and explained that after Mr. Khodorkovsky’s arrest:

there was public outrage in mass media... From the Government ranks, I cannot recall
any person who would express disapproval of the arrest... with the exception of
Mr. Kasyanov.... And after making such a statement, Mr. Putin publicly made a very
rude statement that you can find recorded in video . . . that, “I would ask everybody in the
Government to shut up on Mr. Khodorkovsky’s arrest.” And it was very clear that this
comment was addressed to Mr. Kasyanov, and later Mr. Kasyanov . . . [was] removed from
his position.”**

5. Mr. Leonid Nevzlin

Mr. Leonid Nevzlin*® is a long-standing friend and close business colleague of
Mr. Khodorkovsky. They first met at a research centre in 1987. Mr. Nevzlin held various high
level positions in Bank Menatep and Yukos, including as Vice-President of Yukos responsible
for public relations, and as First Deputy Chairman of the Yukos Board of Directors.
Mr Nevzlin helped found Open Russia in 2001. He also later served as a senator representing
Mordovia until March 2003. He is a beneficiary of three of the trusts that hold ownership

shares in GML. He now resides in Israel, working in philanthropy.

In his witness statement of 15 September 2010, Mr. Nevzlin testifies that his support for
democratic causes led the Russian authorities to target him for persecution. For example, after
he announced his financial support for an opposition presidential candidate in January 2004, the
Prosecutor General’s Office brought “entirely unfounded and politically motivated” charges

against him for tax evasion and embezzlement. “Ludicrous” murder charges were added in

in Russian, through English interpretation), Transcript, Day 7 at 176-224 and Day 8 at 1-43. References to

2004 and 2005. Israel refused to extradite him to Russia but after a “show trial” in 2008, he

was sentenced in absentia to life imprisonment.”

Mr. Nevzlin explains that Mr. Khodorkovsky was perceived by the Kremlin as a political threat
and a potential presidential candidate. According to Mr. Nevzlin, the attacks on Yukos were
motivated by the objectives “to remove Mr. Khodorkovsky as a potential political threat,” “to
punish and make an example of’ Yukos leaders, and to “expropriate Yukos without
compensation.” Mr. Nevzlin received warnings of the attacks on Yukos, including at a meeting
with the Media Minister in Spring 2003, who told him that Mr. Khodorkovsky risked losing
everything, including his liberty, if he did not immediately stop criticism of President Putin. He

was told that President Putin was “furious” about Mr. Khodorkovsky’s media coverage.**

With regard to the Yukos—Sibneft merger, Mr. Nevzlin testifies that he understood that
“everything that happened with Sibneft was approved by President Putin.” At a meeting with
Mr. Khodorkovsky, President Putin cautioned against a U.S. oil major acquiring more than
25 percent of YukosSibneft. The merger was completed in October 2003, but Mr. Abramovich
“abruptly changed his mind and sought to unwind the merger” after it “became apparent that
Khodorkovsky was being targeted by the Kremlin.” Mr. Nevzlin testifies that shortly after
Mr. Khodorkovsky’s arrest in October 2003, Mr. Abramovich approached Mr. Nevzlin in
Tel Aviv to convey that the Yukos—Sibneft merger could only be preserved if Sibneft was given
management of the merged company. The companies were not integrated and eventually

de-merged.”

Mr. Nevzlin appeared before the Tribunal for examination on 18 and 19 October 2012.
Respondent highlighted his lack of banking experience when he rose to the top of Bank
Menatep. Mr. Nevzlin pointed out that “there had not been any commercial banks in the Soviet
Union, and not a single person in the Soviet Union worked in a commercial bank prior to
1988;” and further that “the position of bank president did not mean that [he] in fact was
responsible for banking operations; it was a position that was established specifically for

someone who engaged in public relations.” *”

Mr. Nevzlin was cross-examined on his interest in GML, his motives for testifying in these
arbitrations, and a recent UK court case relating to individuals involved in the Yukos—Sibneft
merger. He acknowledged that the trusts in which he has beneficial interests (the Pictor Trust,
the Southern Cross Trust and the Palmus Trust) hold a total of approximately 67 percent of
GML, and thus that he would benefit financially if the outcome of these arbitrations was

favourable to Claimants.”!

Mr. Nevzlin testified that he had not paid anything for his interests
in the trusts and confirmed also that Messrs. Brudno, Lebedev and Shakhnovsky had not paid
any consideration for their beneficial interests in the Palmus Trust. Amidst this line of

questioning, Mr. Nevzlin pointed out:

everything I own, just like my partners used to own, was earned through extremely hard
work, starting, as you will know from...in 1987.... [VJirtually all the business
revenue, except for what was paid to charity or used for personal needs, was reinvested in
the business .... So all the money, all the shares that we owned we earned through our
titanic—if you will—efforts that had spread over a long period of time.”
Mr. Nevzlin confirmed that he knew about the 2004 tax assessments soon after they were
issued, but by that point he had “already realised that Putin will not stop, and will take away the
company anyway. So I was not surprised by tax claims in this size and consequent actions by
the Russian Federation.” He also confirmed his long-held belief that the tax assessments were

improper, as were the Russian authorities’ enforcement actions, claiming:

Yukos was led into bankruptcy ... They [the Russian authorities] did everything in order

to prevent Yukos from paying off its debts. The company was in perfect shape, with a lot

of cash, with the best rating in the country, with a good market capitalisation, but it took

about two years for Putin and Sechin . . . to destroy this company completely.*>
When asked whether he had hoped Yukos would prevail and defeat the assessments, he replied
that “[t]hose proceedings took place in the Russian Federation, and the outcomes, the decisions
were made in the Kremlin. The decisions were not made in the courtroom.... We are not
talking about a democratic country; we are talking about a dictatorship.”™
Mr. Nevzlin was questioned about why he had waited until 2010, when providing his witness

statement in these proceedings, to disclose that in 2003 Mr. Abramovich told him that

Mr. Khodorkovsky “had been targeted because of his involvement in politics. He was also

asked why he had not included this evidence in his 6 August 2006 witness statement in the
ECtHR proceedings, nor in any of the Russian criminal cases against Mr. Khodorkovsky. He

explained:

if I had spread the information about Abramovich and Putin fairly broadly, and if it had
become available to the public, then from the perspective of Khodorkovsky, who is in
Russian prison, I would have damaged him.

. I would have caused him tremendous amounts of harm. . . in the other comer facing
him were Putin, Sechin and others; but I also would have turned Abramovich into an
enemy of Khodorkovsky’s by disclosing this information.

[A]fter... things moved to a second absurd set of charges and a second trial,
Khodorkovsky’s position changed radically. He was no longer wary of a
political . . . confrontation with Putin’s regime because he realised that he was not going to
be able to find truth in a Russian court if he tried to defend himself based on the laws.

. Russian courts have no interest in my position: it would be either ignored or rejected
by them. . . Because it’s not a judge who makes decision on Khodorkovsky and Lebedev;
the judge just rubber-stamps decisions that are made by investigative committee and
Prosecutor’s Office ....The fact that I trust this court and tell this court a lot more than
I’ve ever said on the matter, this is a typical position for me, because . . . if we're able to
defend our interests, that would be either in courts in free countries or international
courts.

 

 

Mr. Nevzlin was cross-examined about his May 2011 witness statement to the High Court of
Justice in England in a case brought by Mr. Berezovsky against Mr. Abramovich. Mr. Nevzlin
was shown the English judge’s decision, in which the judge declined to attach significant
weight to Mr. Nevzlin’s evidence, as she found him to be “tendentious,” that he “expressed
opinions about matters in respect of which he had no knowledge,” and that she had “the
impression that Mr. Nevzlin had crafted his evidence to suit Mr. Berezovsky’s case.”

Mr. Nevzlin observed the judge was “entitled to her opinion” and he “only told her the truth.”*”

Committee from April 2001 to December 2005. He was a Member of the Executive Committee
of the Yukos Board commencing in 2005. He has 38 years experience in financial and
executive roles in the oil industry. In his witness statement, Mr. Misamore explains that as
CFO, he was to ensure that Yukos met international best practices in financial management.
He describes how, by 2003, Yukos had become an industry leader in transparency, corporate
governance and production and that, “[c]ontemplating significant expansion and growth”
Yukos closed its merger with Sibneft on 3 October 2003 and was in talks with Western oil

majors.°°

Mr. Misamore testifies that PwC played an “integral role” in developing Yukos’ financial
reporting system and was given full access to Yukos’ books, accounts, and employees, and was
“very knowledgeable about and had full access to Yukos’ principal subsidiaries.” He considers
PwC’s withdrawal of the Yukos audit reports as having been “motivated by the continuing
attack ...on Yukos and persons associated with the company” and that it was “highly
questionable professionally.”°°

According to Mr. Misamore, the campaign by the Russian authorities to dismantle Yukos began
in earnest in the summer of 2003 with arrests, raids, searches, and seizures. In July 2003,
Russian authorities raided Yukos’ Moscow offices “in an incredible scene full of armed,
masked officers” and “trawled through [the company’s] computer records for approximately
17 hours.” Large volumes of documents and electronic files were seized, with no copies or
record left.” In August 2006, “baseless, politically motivated” criminal investigations were

announced against Mr. Misamore and others.°'

According to Mr. Misamore, Russian authorities also interfered with the Yukos—Sibneft
merger; Sibneft put the merger “on hold,” and refused to negotiate the demerger. Russian
authorities then imposed a series of “huge fabricated tax reassessments” on Yukos “designed to
financially cripple the company” and to “serve as a pretext under which the Government broke
up the company and expropriated its assets.” Yukos made numerous efforts to negotiate and to

pay its tax bills; these were rejected, “stifle[d],” or went unanswered. He described how on

19 December 2004, the Russian authorities held an auction for YNG. As one of only two
bidders, Baikal won the auction, in ten minutes, for USD 9.35 billion. Baikal was immediately
sold to State-owned Rosneft. In 2007, the court-appointed receiver in the bankruptcy
proceedings, Mr. Eduard Rebgun, liquidated the remaining 40 percent of the company in

auctions won by State-owned entities at prices well below market value.”

Mr. Misamore appeared for examination on 22 October 2012. He was cross-examined on a
wide range of issues encompassing, inter alia: (a) the Yukos—Sibneft merger including the
dividend payment and the unwinding of the merger; (b) PwC and its role in developing the
concepts of golden shares and call options which allowed Yukos to consolidate the financial
performance of companies that it did not own, but for which it had call options;
(c) Mr. Misamore’s knowledge and understanding of Yukos’ domestic offshore trading entities
and the tax assessments levied against some of them; (d) the responses to the tax assessments
and use of proceeds from the sale of Yukos assets; and (e) the creation of two Dutch
foundations, namely Stichting Administratiekantoor Yukos International (“Stichting 1”) and
Stichting Administratiekantoor Small World Telecommunication Holdings B.V. (“Stichting 2,”
together with Stichting 1, the “Stichtings”).

The Tribunal also asked Mr. Misamore whether he was aware of any written legal opinion that
concluded that Yukos’ tax optimization scheme was lawful under Russian law. He replied that
upon receiving the tax assessment in December 2003, Yukos requested opinions from
Mr. Sergey Pepeliaev, a tax expert and regular advisor to Yukos, and PwC. Mr. Misamore
stated that “[bJloth of those opinions basically said what Yukos was doing was completely
legal,” but he could not recall if Yukos’ tax structure had received the blessing of a lawyer or
an accounting firm in writing prior to December 2003. He added that he “was informed
consistently, throughout the entire time [he] was at Yukos, that everything Yukos did with

respect to these things was entirely in accordance with Russian law.”*

30 year career with ConocoPhilips. From June 2004 until February 2005, he served as CEO of
Yukos. Upon the advice of the U.S. State Department, in November 2004 he decided not to
return to Russia. From May 2005 until resigning in August 2006, Mr. Theede was President of
Yukos. In his witness statement, Mr. Theede testifies that within a few years he saw “one of
the largest oil companies in the world . . . managed in accordance with the highest international
standards” be “brought to its knees through the orchestrated attacks of the Russian
authorities.”°”
Mr. Theede states that he was involved in many attempts by Yukos to discharge or settle its
alleged tax liabilities. While Yukos did not accept the validity of the tax claims, it nonetheless
tried to discharge or settle them, only to be prevented from doing so by Respondent. For
instance, in April 2004, Yukos was told to pay USD 3.4 billion within two days, but the next
day was prohibited by the Moscow Arbitrazh Court from alienating assets. This “impossible
situation” of demanding that Yukos pay but depriving it of any means to pay, became a pattern
that led to “a state of paralysis.”
According to Mr. Theede’s statement, Yukos made about 80 proposals and communications to
various Russian authorities but “all our efforts were in vain.” For example, he states that in
July 2004, an offer by Yukos to relinquish its stake in Sibneft to satisfy the alleged debt was
ignored. Yukos retained former Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien to seek a global
| but his proposals went d. M hile, the tax bill kept increasing and
Yukos paid taxes nearly equal to its total revenue. In October 2004, Mr. Theede testifies that
Yukos submitted a “full settlement proposal” in the range of USD 21 billion, but negotiations
“came to an abrupt end” when Yukos’ principal negotiator, Yukos Vice-President Alexander
Temerko was advised to leave Russia to avoid arrest. In December 2004, YNG, Yukos’ core
asset, was sold for a “grossly undervalued price” of USD 9.35 billion in a “sham auction” to an
“unknown company.” After that, there were no more settlement discussions. Mr. Theede

stated that the undervaluation of YNG became obvious when in 2006 Rosneft valued it at

approximately USD 80 billion.”

According to Mr. Theede’s statement, in March 2006, a consortium of Western banks that had
obtained a judgment in England against Yukos filed a bankruptcy petition with the Moscow
Arbitrazh Court. Mr. Theede states that his urgent letter to the Chief Bailiff, requesting that
assets be released to satisfy the debt, went unanswered. He further describes how, in a
confidential agreement, Rosneft agreed to purchase Yukos’ debt to the consortium upon the
initiation of bankruptcy proceedings, which began in March 2006. Respondent was thus the
only creditor of significance. Mr. Theede testifies that in July 2006, Mr. Rebgun produced a
report concluding that Yukos was insolvent, and at the 20 July 2006 creditors’ meeting, he
recommended Yukos be declared bankrupt. By contrast, Yukos had submitted a rehabilitation
plan in June 2006 (the “Rehabilitation Plan”), which valued the company at USD 31 billion,
and would have seen Yukos pay its creditors in two years. The Rehabilitation Plan was not
mentioned in Mr. Regbun’s report. Not wanting to lend credibility to a “charade”, Mr. Theede
did not attend the 20 July 2006 creditors’ meeting and, feeling there was nothing more to do to

protect the company’s assets, he resigned with effect from 1 August 2006.”

Mr. Theede appeared before the Tribunal for examination on 23 and 24 October 2012.
Mr. Theede was cross-examined about, inter alia: (a) the 15 April 2004 injunction (“April
2004 Injunction”) and its effect on Yukos’ control over certain assets; (b) Yukos’ perception
of the tax assessments as politically motivated; (c) the nature, adequacy and legitimacy of
various settlement proposals offered by Yukos to pay off its tax debts; (d) the bankruptcy

proceedings and proceeds from asset sales; and (e) the establishment of the Stichtings.

Upon cross-examination, Mr. Theede confirmed that, in light of Yukos’ strong performance in
2004, “[d]espite the ongoing external pressure,” Yukos’ Board approved approximately
USD 50 million in bonuses. Mr. Theede himself received a USD 5 million bonus. The
decision to issue bonuses was motivated by Yukos’ acute concerns about employee retention
and “hiring others was going to be almost impossible, because . . . it was a scary place to be.””!
He recalled the exceptional hire of Mr. Aleksanyan as executive vice-president of Yukos
because the bankruptcy administrator, Mr. Rebgun, wanted a Yukos executive in Moscow with
whom he could work directly. Mr. Theede recounted that Mr. Aleksanyan “went and met with
Mr. Rebgun and explained to him that we were in a difficult situation but we wanted to

cooperate, and we really felt that we could find a way to survive.” Within three days, police

stormed Mr. Aleksanyan’s house and he was held in jail without a hearing for three years and
only released as a result of a ECtHR ruling.” He died a year later from an illness contracted in

jail.

In response to a Tribunal question, Mr. Theede testified that he met with PwC at least quarterly,
but he did not recall that the trading companies ever came up in their discussions. He never
asked PwC for a written opinion on the structure of the trading companies, and he “was told

that PwC’s consulting arm was actually the architect of those structures.” He did not discuss

any of the tax reassessments with either Messrs. Kubena or Miller of PwC.”

8. Mr. Brent Kaczmarek

Mr. Brent C. Kaczmarek CFA™ is Managing Director of Navigant Consulting, Inc. and has
served as a financial, valuation and damages expert in more than 40 international investment
arbitrations. Mr. Kaczmarek was retained by Claimants as a damages expert to calculate
Claimants’ losses result from a “series of acts which resulted in the demerger of Yukos Sibneft,
the piece-by-piece sale of Yukos’ assets, and eventually the destruction of Yukos,” which he

defines as “the Actions.”

Mr. Kaczmarek’s two expert reports and oral testimony are summarized in Part XII of the
Award. In essence he concludes that, assuming the underlying tax assessments and all
subsequent Actions were violations of the ECT, Claimants should be compensated for the value
of their shareholding in a hypothetical Yukos entity (as merged with Sibneft and listed on the
NYSE) as at the date of 21 November 2007, as well as any dividends that would have been paid
to them up to that point in time, plus interest. The total amount of damages calculated on this
basis would be USD 114.174 billion. Mr. Kaczmarek relies on a number of techniques in

support of this figure, including valuations of Yukos’ assets, a Discounted Cash Flow (“DCF”)

analysis, a and a transactions approach.
Mr. Kaczmarek also offers valuations in scenarios where there is no merger with Sibneft and no

listing on the NYSE. He additionally makes assessments of the damages which would be due

to compensate Yukos were the Tribunal to find that the original tax assessments did not breach
the ECT but that the subsequent enforcement of the tax claims did. His damages calculations

for the latter scenario range between USD 33 billion and USD 67 billion.

Mr. Kaczmarek was cross-examined about (a) revisions he made between his first and second
reports; (b) errors made with respect to the crude oil export tariff rate, the mineral extraction tax
rate, inflation rates, the use of the U.S. Consumer Price Index, an erroneous conversion of tons
to barrels, (c) assumptions about Yukos’ borrowing capacity, and (d) various reasonableness

tests. The Tribunal also questioned him about the choice of valuation dates.”

9. Mr. Philip Baker QC

Mr. Philip Baker QC” practices at Gray’s Inn Tax Chambers in London and is presently a
senior research fellow at the University of London. Claimants presented him as an expert on
international tax law to counter claims made by Respondent’s expert Professor Rosenbloom,
regarding the benefits claimed by Hulley and VPL under the Agreement between Cyprus and
the Russian Federation for the Avoidance of Double Taxation with Respect to Taxes on Income
and Capital, signed on 5 December 1998 (““Cyprus-Russia DTA”). For reasons explained in
more detail in Chapter IX.B of this Award (on “Unclean Hands”), Mr. Baker disagrees with
Professor Rosenbloom’s conclusion that the claims to benefit from the Cyprus-Russia DTA
were not appropriate, were vitiated by tax treaty abuse and were not justified by the provisions

of the DTA.

In essence, Mr. Baker firstly maintains that the benefits that Hulley and VPL received under the
Cyprus-Russia DTA are consistent with its purpose. Secondly, Mr. Baker opines that the abuse
of law doctrine is found in the domestic law of certain countries, but is not universal and, where
it applies, it is for that domestic jurisdiction to resolve whether the doctrine applies to
international obligations such as double taxation conventions. Thirdly, Mr. Baker maintains
that Hulley and VPL were the beneficial owners of the dividends received from Yukos in the
sense of Article 10 of the Cyprus-Russia DTA. Hulley and VPL were acknowledged

investment companies holding shares in Russian companies and did not have a permanent

establishment in Russia under Article 10(4).

10. Mr. Yuri Schmidt

Mr. Yuri Schmidt” was Mr. Khodorkovsky’s defense lawyer in his 2004 and 2007 criminal
trials, prior to which Mr. Schmidt had no previous dealings with Mr. Khodorkovsky or with
Yukos. In his witness statement, Mr. Schmidt recounts that Russian authorities systematically
intimidated and harassed Yukos’ lawyers and personnel. Illegal and aggressive raids and
seizures were “meticulously calculated to correspond to the critical stages in the dismantlement
of Yukos.” Russian authorities also engaged in physical attacks and other provocation,
including long and abusive interrogations and beatings. In February 2007, defense lawyers
were illegally and invasively searched at the airport while en route to visit Mr. Khodorkovsky
in Siberia. Russian authorities also (unsuccessfully) brought libel proceedings against and

attempted to disbar Mr. Schmidt. Respondent chose not to call him for cross-examination.

Mr. Schmidt testifies that in the criminal cases against Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev,
Russian authorities violated basic standards of due process and fair trial. In 50 years of legal
practice in Russia, Mr. Schmidt had “never seen breaches of due process so flagrant and so

egregious,” nor had he ever, even in the “darkest hours of the Soviet regime,” “seen the Russian
State undertake such coordinated, systematic and intense efforts, and deploy such huge
resources, against a person accused of an alleged economic offense.” The raids resulted in the
“massive confiscation” of documents that were not returned. In December 2006, the
defendants were transferred to a “pre-trial detention isolator” in Chita and Siberia. Mr. Schmidt
recounts that during the trials, seized documents were presented out of context; the defendants
sat in metal and glass cages that were equipped with hidden microphones; criminal charges
were brought against defense witnesses; and prosecution motions were systematically granted,

while defense motions were refused.

According to Mr. Schmidt, the goal of destroying Yukos and confiscating its assets was carried
out by the coordinated actions of all branches of the Russian State. The judiciary blocked
Mr. Khodorkovsky’s registration of candidacy for the 2005 parliamentary elections by

accelerating his appeal. The administration transferred Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev to

the “most inaccessible penal colonies in Russia,” “in blatant violation of Russian law.” The
legislature amended legislation to permit the transfer and amended the law on NGOs to force

the closure of Open Russia.

11. Dr. Sergei Kovalev

Dr. Sergei Kovalev’* is a Russian human rights activist, former politician, Soviet dissident and
political prisoner. From 1993 to 2003 he served as an elected State Duma Deputy. He has been
nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Dr. Kovalev’s expert opinion is on the independence of
the Russian judiciary in cases with a political element or representing a particular interest to
Russian authorities. Dr. Kovalev concludes that the Russian judicial system was not, and is still
not, independent. According to Dr. Kovalev, where cases implicate the interests of the State,
trials are political and decisions dictated by extralegal motives. There exists “absolute
submission of the Russian judiciary to the executive power.” Respondent did not call him for

cross-examination.

Dr. Kovalev opines that the normative regulation of the Russian judiciary ensures its
dependence, including through the role of the executive branch of government in the
appointment of judges. Court Presidents have “excessive powers,” courts are under-funded,
judges earn bonuses for “exemplary behavior” (as defined by the regime), and disciplinary

action is taken against disobedient judges.

Dr. Kovalev’s answer to the question of whether the Russian judiciary was independent of the
executive branch in the Yukos and Khodorkovsky/Lebedev cases, is “unequivocal and
definitely negative,” because of the “clearly political nature” of the cases. The political motive
was “to dispose of Mikhail Khodorkovsky,” whom the Putin administration saw as an
“unmistakable political opponent.” According to Dr. Kovalev, the attacks on Yukos also had
economic motives, as evidenced by President Putin’s vouching for the unknown last minute
purchasers of YNG. Pressure (including the imprisonment of Yukos lawyer Vasiliy
Aleksanyan) was exerted on other Yukos associates to obtain testimony. Dr. Kovalev lists
“egregious due process violations” against Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev, including:

(a) a pretrial investigation that was conducted without the defendants’ participation; (b) the

Professor Dow’s two expert reports and oral testimony are summarized in Part XII of the
Award. Professor Dow acknowledges focusing on “explaining why the Kaczmarek Report is
not useful for calculating damages in this matter.” His reports contain no alternative valuation
of his own. He basically describes a series of flaws in the analysis of Mr. Kaczmarek,
highlighting his choice of a valuation date which, he says, is arbitrary and unjustifiably inflates
damages. He also criticizes Mr. Kaczmarek for ignoring causation and the extent to which
Yukos’ own actions might have contributed to the loss. Professor Dow identifies a number of
errors in Claimants’ DCF analysis and questions the way in which Mr. Kaczmarek sought to
correct them without impacting the ultimate valuation. He also articulates problems with
Claimants’ comparable companies method and the assumptions underlying the “alternative
collection scenarios” whereby Claimants would have been given an opportunity to make
arrangements to pay off legitimate tax assessments. He identifies some “obvious and
significant errors” relating to the application of the inflation rate, the export duty rate and the
mineral extract tax rate. He also criticizes any valuation based on an American Depository
Receipt (“ADR”) listing on the NYSE as too speculative. Professor Dow was cross-examined

about these issues.

At the Hearing, Professor Dow testified that he would be prepared to put some weight on
Mr. Kaczmarek’s analysis for YNG with corrections (USD 17.1 billion for the comparable
companies approach and USD 17.2 billion for the comparable transactions approach); which
represented a “reasonable stab”.“' Professor Dow was asked if his corrected figures for Yukos
and YukosSibneft valuations resulting from the comparable companies analysis (of USD 67.8
billion and US 93.7 billion respectively) could provide “a valid result in terms of valuation in
the same manner as for YNG,” to which he answered that: “They are not presented in that
context, but I think I’d have to agree that they could be a useful valuation, yes.”*” He qualified
this answer by noting he had not done enough analysis, for example by accounting for changes
in oil prices. Claimants’ counsel also challenged Professor Dow on his criticisms of Claimants’
comparable companies approach. With respect to the proper valuation date, from an economic
standpoint, he considered that the end of 2004 was the appropriate valuation date, since that is
when the loss of value in Yukos had taken place and the market thought, based on the share

price, that the company’s fortunes had no chance of being reversed. Professor Dow opined that

“it’s indisputable that there was no value by the end of 2004." By the end of 2004, Yukos’
share price had plummeted, it was a penny stock, and in the three years that followed there was

no recovery in the share price.”**

2. Mr. Oleg Y. Konnov

Mr. Oleg Y. Konnov* is a partner at Herbert Smith LLP and head of its Russian tax group
based in Moscow. He has practiced tax law for 17 years and taught at the Law Faculty of
Moscow State University. Respondent retained him as an expert on Russian tax law.
Mr. Konnov was the only Russian tax lawyer who appeared as a witness before the Tribunal.
Extensive extracts from his testimony are set out in the Analysis portion of the Award,
especially the chapters dealing with Yukos’ tax optimization scheme and the tax assessments.

Accordingly, his testimony is not reproduced here in any detail.

His first expert report describes the tax optimization scheme adopted by Yukos using domestic
offshore companies and sets out some basic principles of the Russian federal tax legislation at

the relevant times. He then addresses seven specific questions.

The first question is whether the tax authorities acted in accordance with applicable law and
practice when assessing profit tax on Yukos with respect to sales by the domestic offshore
companies. Mr. Konnov answers affirmatively and opines that the actions of the Russian tax
authorities against Yukos were consistent with pronouncements by Russian courts on the
“anti-abuse doctrine”, which according to Mr. Konnov, was “accepted and consistently

applied” by Russian courts before and after the Yukos tax cases.*°

The second question is whether Yukos was automatically entitled to a zero percent VAT rate in
connection with exports declared by domestic offshore companies. Mr. Konnov answers no,

because the application of a zero percent VAT rate was “strictly conditioned” on the taxpayer’s

Ibid. at 176.

Mr. Konnov submitted two expert reports for these proceedings. First Expert Report of Mr. Oleg Konnov, 4 April
2011 (hereinafter “First Konnov Report”); Second Expert Report of Mr. Oleg Konnov, 15 August 2012 (hereinafter
“Second Konnov Report”). Mr. Konnov appeared for examination on 29-31 October 2012; Transcript, Day 13 at |—
257; Day 14 at 1-261; Day 15 at 1-256. References to Mr. Konnov’s testimony appear Chapters VIIIA (The Tax
Optimization Scheme), VIILB (The Tax Assessments Starting in December 2003), VILE (Attempts to Settle) and
VIILF (The Auction of YNG).

filing of a “special” zero percent monthly VAT return. According to Mr. Konnov, Yukos
should have complied with the specific procedures because the courts and the tax authorities

established that Yukos was “the actual owner and exporter of goods.”*”

The third question is whether Yukos had disclosed to the Russian tax authorities prior to the
commencement of the 2003 tax audit its tax minimization practices involving the use of
domestic offshore companies registered in domestic low-tax jurisdictions. Mr. Konnov saw
nothing in the record indicating that Yukos “made any significant disclosure of its tax scheme,”

but even so, illegal tax practices may not be legitimized through a tax offender’s disclosure.**

The fourth question is whether the Russian Tax Ministry complied with applicable law in
appointing and conducting a tax audit of Yukos in December 2003. Mr. Konnov answers

affirmatively.

The fifth question is whether the Russian tax authorities and courts complied with applicable
law in imposing fines on Yukos. Mr. Konnov explains that the base fine under Russian tax law
is 20 percent, which can be increased to 40 percent if non-payment results from the willful acts
of a taxpayer, which in turn may be doubled for repeat offenders. Mr. Konnov concludes that

the imposition of fines on Yukos was justified and accorded with prevailing court practice.”

The sixth question concerns actions that Yukos could have taken after receiving the 2000 Tax
Audit Report in December 2003 to reduce its tax liability. Mr. Konnov explains that Yukos
could have: (a) voluntarily paid all tax arrears and accrued interest and reserved cash for fines;
(b) filed amended tax returns, and paid tax and interest due for 2001-2003; (c) complied with
the legal requirements for claiming the zero percent VAT rate; and (d) discontinued as of

1 January 2004 the use of domestic offshore companies.”!

The seventh question is whether the tax treatment of YNG changed after its sale to Rosneft.

Mr. Konnov concludes that the treatment of YNG before and after its sale to Rosneft “was

consistent with then current practice of the Russian tax authorities and courts, and does not

suggest any irregularity.”””

Mr. Konnov’s second report responds to alleged misstatements of Russian tax law found in the
Reply, including with respect to the “anti-abuse doctrine” under Russian tax law,”
“re-attribution,” and the “bad-faith taxpayer” doctrine.“ Mr. Konnov also addresses
Claimants’ arguments about proportionality between tax benefits claimed and investments
made in the low-tax regions, Yukos’ awareness that its tax optimization scheme was not fully
compliant with the law, the application of the Law of the Russian Federation governing Value

Added Tax (“WAT Law”), and fines on Yukos.”*

Mr. Konnov appeared before the Tribunal for examination on 29, 30 and 31 October 2012. He
was cross-examined on a range of documents from the record, legal authorities and their
application to Yukos and its domestic offshore companies. Issues canvassed in the cross-
examination included, inter alia: (a) the factual record underlying his views expressed about
alleged improprieties in Yukos’ domestic offshore companies; (b) whether oil products must be
physically stored or moved from the premises of trading companies; (c) the re-attribution
theory applied to Yukos and the existence of legal precedents for the theory at the relevant
time; (d) provisions in the regional tax legislation in Mordovia and elsewhere; (e) the
investment agreements concluded between the domestic offshore trading companies and
Mordovian authorities; (f) the existence of the anti-abuse doctrine at relevant times; (g) fines
and penalties; (h) prior audits conducted by local and regional authorities on Yukos’ domestic
offshore trading companies and the extent to which they demonstrate familiarity with and
tolerance of the tax optimization scheme; (i) audit inspection practices; (j) the meaning of
“interrelatedness” in the context of Russian tax legislation; (k) the consequences of the
reattribution theory on entitlement to VAT refunds and the formalities required to enjoy VAT
exemption; (I) the evolution of the ZATO tax laws and certain internal memoranda within

ZATO tax inspectorates; and (m) timing for enforcement of tax assessments.”°

Mr. Konnov also answered questions from the Tribunal, including about the principle of
resolving doubts in favor of the taxpayer.°’ He was asked why, in the interests of justice the
Russian courts did not treat the filings for VAT by the trading companies as filings by Yukos.”*
When he emphasized the formalities required for filing for VAT, he was further asked whether
the trustee in bankruptcy (Mr Rebgun), who was charged with maximizing the resources
available for creditors, himself could have filed the monthly forms for VAT return.
Mr. Konnov answered that he could have done so, subject to the three-year limitation period,
ie., he could have re-filed for the three years preceding his appointment as trustee.” The
Tribunal also asked Mr. Konnov how the tax authorities determine the motivation of a taxpayer
in making use of a low-tax region and about his experience in advising clients with respect to

tax minimization.’

Mr. Konnov was asked about a comment made by him as an expert witness in the Ros/nvestCo
UK Ltd. v. The Russian Federation arbitration (““RosInvestCo”), to the effect that “sometimes
Russian courts [do not] have an excellent reputation.” Mr. Konnov responded that he had not
come across corruption or irregularities in tax cases.'"! He was invited to share his views on the
tax evasion aspects of the convictions of Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev. The parts of the
judgment dealing with tax elements of the ZATOs and issues of personal income tax avoidance

seemed to him to make sense, but he could not comment on other parts of the judgment.'”

3. Professor Reinier Kraakman

Professor Reinier Kraakman'® is a Harvard law professor specializing in comparative corporate
law and governance. Claimants chose not to call him for cross-examination. His expert report
concers the activities of Bank Menatep, Mikhail Khodorkovsky and his “tight-knit group of

from the period 1995-1999. He addresses provisions of the Russian Civil Law, Joint Stock

Company Law (“JSC Law”) and privatization law.

Professor Kraakman maintains that Mr. Khodorkovsky, his Group, and Bank Menatep acted in
bad faith and “probably illegally” in violation of the spirit and letter of Presidential Decree
No. 889, which was the legal foundation of the Loans-For-Shares (“LFS”) Program. At stake
in the initial auction of Yukos shares in December 1996 were (i) the right to lend funds to the
Russian Federation secured by a pledge of 45 percent of Yukos stock, and (ii) the right to
purchase a block of 33 percent of Yukos Stock in a so-called “Investment Tender”. Bank
Menatep held shares pledged by the State and sold those shares to their close affiliates, a “tactic”
that “allowed the Khodorkovsky Group to gain title to the pledged shares while avoiding Bank
Menatep’s agency duty to maximize their value,” thus violating “the intent of Decree 889, while

making a gesture toward formal compliance.”

According to Professor Kraakman, secondary sources, and some primary documentation,
support “a reasonable inference” that, prior to the Russian Federation’s sovereign debt crisis in
late 1998, the Khodorkovsky Group systematically skimmed revenue from Yukos’
partially-held operating subsidiaries—YNG, Samarneftegaz, and Tomskneft—in bad faith and
in violation of the JSC Law’s regulations on self-dealing transactions. Circumstantial evidence
indicates that the Khodorkovsky Group skimmed revenue directly from Yukos from mid-1996
until 1999, and transferred it to offshore companies around the world that were controlled or

beneficially owned by members of the Khodorkovsky Group.

He testifies that following the Russian sovereign debt crisis, Yukos and the Khodorkovsky
Group largely succeeded in squeezing out minority shareholders from Yukos’ operating
subsidiaries. Yukos managed this by committing serious violations of the provisions in the JSC
Law intended to protect minority shareholders. Yukos exhibited egregious bad faith by
blocking minority shareholders from participating in extraordinary shareholders meetings
called in March 1999. He claims: “As a professor of corporate law with a particular interest in
the JSC Law, I have never read—or read about—anything more chilling in a professional sense
than the documents and manipulative behavior surrounding the March 1999 EGMs
[Extraordinary General Meetings] held for YNG, Samareneftegaz, and Tomskneft.” In Professor
Kraakman’s opinion, Yukos and the Khodorkovsky Group opportunistically devalued Yukos
shares, which Bank Menatep—the Group’s financial arm—had previously pledged to Western

banks in order to finance Yukos’ efforts to gain control of Tomskneft.

4, Professor H. David Rosenbloom

Professor H. David Rosenbloom" is a practicing attorney, a consultant and NYU law professor
specializing in international taxation. He has worked for the U.S. Government on international
tax matters. Respondent retained him as an international tax law expert. He opines on the
appropriateness of the actions from 2000-2003 by four Cypriot entities—Hulley, VPL, Dunsley
Limited, and Nassaubridge Management Limited—in claiming a reduced Russian Federation

tax on dividends paid by Yukos and affiliates, under the Cyprus-Russia DTA.

Professor Rosenbloom concludes that each of the four entities is a “paper entity”, with “total
control” and “ultimate ownership” exercised by Russian individuals operating solely within
Russia and enjoying all economic benefits. According to Professor Rosenbloom, the invocation
of the Cyprus-Russia DTA under these circumstances was a “blatant example of tax treaty
abuse.” Professor Rosenbloom refers to pervasive recognition of the international “abuse of
law” doctrine, to the OECD Commentaries (the DTA follows the OECD Model), and to the
CLT to assert that: (a) taxpayers must act in good faith to benefit from an income tax treaty;
and (b) the employment of entities in one State party to a tax treaty exclusively to reduce taxes

otherwise applicable under the laws of the other State party constitutes tax treaty abuse.

For reasons described in more detail in Chapter IX.B (on “Unclean Hands”), Professor
Rosenbloom concludes that the benefits claimed were not justified by Article 10 of the Cyprus-
Russia DTA, which limits the tax charged by one State on dividends paid from a company in
that State to beneficial owners of the stock resident in the other State, provided they do not
operate through a “permanent establishment” in the first State, to which the dividends are
attributable. Firstly, he opines, the Cypriot entities were not beneficial owners of the dividends
received on Yukos shares, and the beneficial owners were not residents of Cyprus. Secondly,
in his view, the entities were not eligible for the claimed benefits because they operated through
permanent establishments in the Russian Federation, to which the dividends were attributable.
In sum, according to Professor Rosenbloom, the claims under the Cyprus-Russia DTA on

behalf of the Cypriot entities were unjustified. They were not only abusive, but without merit.

First Expert Report of Professor H. David Rosenbloom, 1 April 2011, filed with Counter-Memorial, Second Expert
Report of Professor H. David Rosenbloom, 15 August 2012, filed with Rejoinder. Initially Claimants i
cross-examine Professor Rosenbloom, but decided not to after Respondent advised it would not be cross-examining

210.

In his second expert report, Professor Rosenbloom replies to the opinion of Claimants’ tax law
expert, Mr. Baker, which he describes as “long on law and history” but “short, very short, on
the facts.” The facts here, according to Professor Rosenbloom, involve Russian nationals and
residents earning Russian source income and claiming a treaty-based reduction of normal
Russian tax by reason of a “wafer-thin Cypriot corporate veneer managed from Russian soil.”
Neither the DTA nor any other income tax treaty would condone such a structure and no
rational country would endorse it as sound policy. Professor Rosenbloom then sets out in
further detail facts pertaining to several Yukos-related entities which inappropriately claimed

benefits under the Cyprus-Russia DTA.

Professor Rosenbloom opines that the primary purpose of a tax treaty is to eliminate or at least
mitigate international double taxation and none of the authorities in Mr. Baker’s report deal
with a country using treaties to reduce tax on its own residents but rather discuss third-country
investors. Interpreting the Cyprus-Russia DTA as an instrument to attract foreign direct
investment into Russia without regard to tax revenue loss exceeds the limited scope of OECD-
based treaties and undermines the purpose of tax avoidance and evasion. Professor
Rosenbloom also accuses Mr. Baker of failing to differentiate between treaty shopping and
“round tripping”. Russia’s inaction to insist on strict limitation on benefit or its failure to

terminate the Cyprus-Russia DTA does not establish Russia’s endorsement of round tripping.

Finally, Professor Rosenbloom refers to documents provided after the filing of his first report,
which he says confirm that neither Hulley nor VPL beneficially owned dividends received from
Yukos. Even if Hulley and VPL were considered beneficial owners of the Yukos dividends on
the transferred shares, the related-party “repos” or stock-lending agreements, which had no

purpose other than to enable claims of treaty benefits, are an improper use of the DTA.

According to Professor Rosenbloom, even if the Yukos structure and transactions with the
Cypriot entities were not abusive, dividend distributions by Yukos and its affiliates to Hulley,
‘VPL and the other Cypriot entities did not qualify under the DTA for reduced tax in Russia
since they should have been taxed as “business profits” under Article 10(4) of the DTA. The
facts also confirm that all the Laurel subsidiaries had permanent establishments in Russia to
which the dividends received from their Russian subsidiaries were attributable. According to
Professor Rosenbloom, it is not necessary to adopt a complicated “economic substance” or
“substance-over-form” analysis to see that the Yukos structure cannot be defended as within the
scope of the Cyprus-Russia DTA or legitimate tax planning. Had Mr. Baker and Claimants

“focused on the facts presented” they could not reasonably have come to any other conclusion.

5. Professor Thomas Z. Lys

Professor Thomas Lys'*

is a professor of accounting at Kellogg School of Management,
Northwestern University in Chicago. He has a PhD in accounting and finance from the
University of Rochester and an economics degree from the University of Berne, Switzerland.
He has served as a consultant to several companies. He was retained by Respondent to
expound in detail various financial transactions and operations of Yukos. Claimants chose not
to call him for cross-examination. The appendices attached to Professor Lys’ Reports were

used at various times throughout the Hearing to help illustrate Yukos’ structure and activities.

Professor Lys recounts Yukos’ incorporation in 1993, privatization in 1995 and public sale of
shares in 1996. He describes Yukos’ structure and activities and the role of the various
producing subsidiaries, trading entities and off-shore entities, and the structure and flow of

funds originating in the trading companies into “offshore and Yukos entities.”

Professor Lys explains that starting in 1999, the majority of Yukos shares were owned by
subsidiaries of GML, an entity whose major interest was held by Mr. Khodorkovsky, the CEO
and Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors of Yukos. Other
shareholders of GML also had senior management positions in Yukos. In several instances,
shares of Yukos stock were transferred between various entities under the control of GML.
Many such transactions placed the Yukos shares temporarily, sometimes for less than a week,
under nominal ownership of Cypriot entities on dates that established record ownership for
purposes of Yukos dividend distributions, apparently in an effort to reduce Russian taxes on
these dividends. YUL was a wholly-owned subsidiary of GML. Hulley was a wholly-owned
subsidiary of YUL. Although VPL did not fall under the ownership structure of GML, it was a
subsidiary of the Veteran Petroleum Trust (a Jersey trust), of which YUL controlled at least

three quarters of the voting rights.

Professor Lys describes and details how there were hundreds of transactions of Yukos shares
among the above-described entities and their affiliates; in some instances multiple transactions
occurred on a single day. Many appear to Professor Lys to “have been structured to place
Yukos shares temporarily in the hands of Hulley and a specific account held in the name of
VPL, both of which are Cypriot entities, as of the record dates of Yukos dividend payments.”
First Expert Report of Thomas Z. Lys, | April 2011, filed with Counter-Memorial, Supplemental Expert Report of

Professor Thomas Z. Lys, 15 August 2012, filed with Rejoinder. References to Professor Lys’ Reports appear in
Chapters VIILA (The Tax Optimization Scheme) and X.E (Contributory Fault).

He states that “they appear to have been performed to allow the Cypriot entities to claim
beneficial ownership of these shares to reduce the Russian withholding taxes on the dividends
Yukos paid on these shares, pursuant to the [Cyprus-Russia DTA].” Given their timing,

Professor Lys sees no apparent business purpose for these transactions.

Professor Lys also describes Yukos’ dividend flows through YUL, Hulley, VPL, and GML. He
concludes that YUL, and its beneficiary GML, not only received the economic benefit of the
dividends paid on the Yukos shares owned by Hulley, but also received the benefit of the gains
Hulley reported from the sales of Yukos shares to YUL. In other words, the profits earned on
those sales were effectively “returned” through the dividend. YUL (and GML) were also the

beneficiaries of dividends paid on Yukos shares owned by VPL.

Professor Lys describes how from 2000 to 2003, groups of Yukos-related entities “moved funds
in a common pattern from Russia’s low-tax regions out of Russia, into off-shore entities.” He
details the flow structures of profits through the Fargoil and Ratibor structures. He sets out the
Mega Alyans flow structure, showing the ultimate ownership of trading entities by Laurel, a
BVI entity, and its sole shareholder, Stephen Curtis. He describes how Yukos had a call option

to acquire all of Mr. Curtis’ Laurel shares for one rouble.

He also details the flow structures in 2000-2001 of the trading companies registered in the
ZATOs of Lesnoy and Trekhgorny (Business-Oil, Flander, Forest-Oil, Greis, Kolkrein,
Kverkus, Mitra, Muscron, Nortkes, and Vald Oil). He explains how the Lesnoy and Trekgorny
trading companies passed funds through two Russian entities—Neftetrade and Neftemarket—to
a number of Cypriot companies, which in turn passed the funds on through Laurel to Halsley

and Belmont, two BVI entities owned by Brill.

Finally, Professor Lys describes loans made by and to Yukos Capital (incorporated in
Luxembourg in 2003). Yukos Capital’s 2005 financial statements show that it borrowed
extensively from and lent extensively to other Yukos entities. Professor Lys details loan
transactions where the exact amount borrowed by Yukos Capital was then lent by Yukos

Capital to other Yukos-related entities.

6. Ms. Felicity Cullen QC

Ms. Felicity Cullen QC’ is a barrister specializing in United Kingdom tax law. Respondent
asked Ms. Cullen to opine on rules concerning the assessment, collection, and enforcement of
tax in the UK, in the context of showing that “[t]he treatment by the Russian tax authorities of
Yukos’ tax evasion scheme is entirely consistent with the positions that would have been taken
by the tax authorities of virtually every other country [including the UK].”""” Claimants chose

not to call her for cross-examination.

Ms. Cullen was asked to give her opinion on the basis of a number of assumptions about a large
corporate taxpayer who has entered into transactions to reduce its tax liability. She was asked
to assume that the transactions are considered by tax authorities to involve avoidance and/or
criminal evasion of tax, to lack genuine commerciality, and to have been carried out on non-
arm’s length terms. The same taxpayer is assumed to have deliberately concealed the true
character of its transactions, to have been deliberately uncooperative in tax investigations and to
have dissipated assets otherwise available to satisfy potential tax liabilities. In such assumed
circumstances, Ms. Cullen describes the investigation and enforcement options open to an
officer of Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”) during an enquiry into a tax return.
For example, HMRC can amend a company’s self-assessment if its suspected of understating
the company’s true tax liability and there is a real risk of substantial loss of tax to the
government. Under a discovery process, HMRC is allowed to re-open returns for periods
otherwise considered closed when there has been careless or deliberate conduct leading to loss

of revenue.

With respect to penalities, Ms. Cullen notes that under the current UK civil tax penalty regime
may vary from 30 to 100 percent of the potential lost revenue (depending on whether there was
deliberate concealment). She further describes the considerable methods of enforcement
available to HMRC, which include proceedings in English courts, freezing orders, and pursuit
of insolvency proceedings. Criminal action may, according to Ms. Cullen, be pursued where
appropriate, in which case HMRC will often conduct a form of “dawn raid”, require production

of documents, seize items like computers and make arrests.

Ms Cullen observes that traditionally, tax legislation in the UK was construed literally but
today, it is construed purposively, which has facilitated challenging and countering tax

avoidance schemes.

7. Mr. Dale Hart

Mr. Dale Hart'®’ is a retired executive of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”).
Respondent retained Mr. Hart to describe the U.S. legal framework against tax abuse and
evasion and enforcement powers of the IRS, in the context of Respondent’s claim that “tax
administrations around the world [including the U.S.] would have been at least as firm as the

+9109

Russian Federation in dealing with abuses of the kind perpetrated by Yukos. Claimants

chose not to call him for cross-examination.

Mr. Hart testifies that under U.S. law, abusive or fraudulent tax shelters are broadly defined to
include investment schemes that reduce tax income without changing the value of the business.
To combat them, the IRS relies on a legal framework that provides the authority to reallocate
income and deductions to properly reflect income. The framework includes the judicial
doctrines of economic substance, business purpose, sham transactions, substance over form and
step transactions. The IRS has extensive civil and criminal enforcement powers, which
according to Mr. Hart, it uses “aggressively”. It has broad discretion in determining which tax
returns and taxpayers to select for audit and it tailors the scope of its audit to the taxpayer’s
financial and tax situation. If evidence of fraud is revealed, the civil audit is discontinued and a
criminal investigation may be launched. Mr. Hart notes that the typical three-year limitation

period may be extended for fraud or other misconduct.

With respect to penalties, Mr. Hart describes how U.S. law imposes “heavy” penalties on
fraudulently underpaid tax, including failure to pay and failure to file penalties, accuracy-
related penalties on underpayments and a civil fraud penalty of 75 percent. The collection
process begins with a formal notice of assessment requesting payment. According to Mr. Hart,
a deferred payment arrangement is only ever considered when the taxpayer is unable to pay in
full. Mr. Hart describes the “strong arsenal” of administrative enforcement collection tools at

the disposal of the IRS, including a federal tax lien, a notice of levy and the sale of property by

8. Mr. Polyvios Polyviou

Mr. Polyvios Polyviou'””

of Chryssafinis & Polyviou LLC in Nicosia is a lawyer practicing
Cypriot law. Respondent retained him as an expert to show that Claimants’ alleged abuses of
the Cyprus-Russia DTA also violated the criminal laws of Cyprus. Claimants chose not to call

him for cross-examination.

Mr. Polyviou’s report is based on the following assumptions: (a) that for purposes of the
Cyprus-Russia DTA, Hulley and Veteran were “residents” of Cyprus and Yukos was a
“resident” of Russia; (b) that in reliance on the Cyprus-Russia DTA, Hulley and Veteran paid a
reduced five percent withholding tax to Russia on dividends received from Yukos; (c) that
Hulley and Veteran had no right to take the benefit of the Cyprus-Russia DTA because the
relevant dividends were connected with activities carried out in Russia and/or because Hulley
and Veteran were not the beneficial owners of the relevant dividends; (d) that the natural
persons who declared/confirmed on forms submitted by Hulley and Veteran to Cypriot tax
authorities that the relevant dividends received from Yukos were not connected with activities
carried out in Russia and that Hulley/Veteran was the beneficial owner of the relevant
dividends were authorized to do so on Hulley/Veteran’s behalf; and (e) that at the time of
making the declarations/confirmations, these natural persons knew that the dividends from
Yukos were connected with activities carried out in Russia or that Hulley/Veteran was not the
beneficial owner and intended for the forms to be submitted to the Cypriot authorities so as to
obtain completion, dating, signing and stamping of Box 4 (the “Note of the foreign Tax
authority”) on the forms. On the basis of these assumptions, Mr. Polyviou was asked to address

two questions, as described below.

The first question was: “Did the circumstances under which Hulley and Veteran obtained the
completion, dating, signing and stamping of certain tax forms by the Cypriot tax authorities
give rise to criminal offences under the Criminal Code of Cyprus?” Mr. Polyviou answers
“Yes” under sections 297 (false pretences), 305 (willfully obtaining a “certificate” by false
pretences) and 341 (willfully procuring execution of documents by false pretences) of Cap. 154

Expert Report of Mr. Polyvios G. Polyviou, 1 April 2011 (hereinafter “Polyviou Report”). References to
Mr. Polyviou’s report appear in Chapters IX.B (Unclean Hands) and X.E (Contributory Fault).

of the Criminal Code. According to Mr. Polyviou, but for the false pretence, Cypriot tax
authorities would have rejected the request to complete, date, sign and stamp the forms as it

would have been pointless and tantamount to assisting an abuse of the Cyprus-Russia DTA.

The second question was: “Were criminal offences committed under the Criminal Code and/or
the Companies Law of Cyprus?”, assuming that during the period 1 January 2000 to 28 October
2003: (a) in reliance upon the Cyprus-Russia DTA Hulley and Veteran paid a reduced five
percent withholding tax to Russia on dividends received from Yukos; (b) neither Hulley nor
Veteran had the right to take the benefit of the Cyprus-Russia DTA, at least vis-a-vis Yukos”
above-mentioned dividends; and (c) neither Hulley nor Veteran disclosed point (b) in their
annual accounts for financial years 2000-2002? Mr. Polyviou answered “Yes” under
section 311(b)(iii) (directors and officers of corporations keeping fraudulent accounts or
falsifying books or accounts) of Cap. 154 and section 143(6) (contents and forms of accounts)

of Cap. 113 of the Criminal Code.

9. Mr. John Ellison

Mr. John Ellison''' is a consultant at KPMG in London, having retired as a senior partner in
2010. His report concerns the withdrawal by PwC of its audit opinions on Yukos’ financial
statements for the years 1995-2004. Claimants chose not to cross-examine him.'!?

Mr. Ellison opines that for a reputable international firm such as KPMG to withdraw an audit
opinion is an “unusual and serious” event, of which he knows of only a handful of cases. At
KPMG, whether in the UK, the U.S., or Russia, such decision would necessarily be preceded
by extensive consultations with several senior partners of the firm together with its technical
departments and legal counsel. According to Mr. Ellison, PwC’s procedures were similar, as
shown by a declaration (appended to the Ellison Report) from Ms. Laurie Endsley, PwC’s

in-house counsel who worked on the Yukos matter at the time of withdrawing the audits.

Mr. Ellison analyzes PwC’s letter of 15 June 2007,'? in which PwC announced the withdrawal
of its audit opinions of Yukos’ financial statements, explaining that it had acquired new

information that caused it to question the reliability of the representations made by Yukos’

na

management during the audits. Assuming the veracity of the contents of the letter, Mr. Ellison
concludes that in withdrawing its audit opinions, PwC acted in accordance with the auditing

standards generally accepted in the U.S., Russia and internationally.

Mr. Ellison notes that under U.S. Statement of Auditing Standards No. 1, Section 333, when an
auditor after issuing its report becomes aware of facts that existed at the time the report was
being compiled, believes there are persons relying or likely to rely on his report and considers
that the new facts are material to his report, or shake his confidence in the overall veracity of
representations made by management, the auditor must advise his client to disclose the new
facts and possibly revise its financial statements. Mr. Ellison refers to PwC’s claim that in light
of the bankruptcy of Yukos, PwC “was unable to access the information required that could
lead to revision of the financial statements and was also unable to discuss the matter with
management, as recommended by [U.S. Auditing standards] AU Section 561.” Mr. Ellison

accepts that in those circumstances, PwC “had no option but to withdraw its audit reports.”

Under International Standard on Auditing 560 and Russian Federal Auditing Rule 10, when
new material facts become known to the auditor after issuance of the audit report, the auditor
should consider revising the company’s financial statements, discuss the matter with the
company’s management and “take the action appropriate in the circumstances” or “take steps

necessary in the circumstances.” In Mr. Ellison’s view, PwC did take the appropriate steps.

10. Mr. Raymond Gross

Mr. Raymond Gross''* is a partner of KPMG’s U.S. Accounting & Reporting Group in London.
Claimants chose not to cross-examine him. Respondent asked Mr. Gross to review what
Yukos’ consolidated financial statements prepared under U.S. GAAP revealed with respect to:
(a) Yukos’ tax optimization scheme, including its use of trading companies in low-tax regions
of Russia to buy oil and oil products from production subsidiaries and transfer the proceeds to
offshore companies established or controlled by Yukos; (b) the Jurby Lake structure, a group of
offshore trading companies controlled by Yukos or its former Russian majority shareholders
and comprising Jurby Lake Limited (Ireland) and the BBS Companies; and (c) the taxes
assessed against Yukos’ trading companies in the ZATO of Lesnoy for tax years 1999 and

2000.

237.

238.

Mr. Gross was instructed to assume that the statements would have “put a reader on notice of
facts relevant to the nature and legality of Yukos’ use of the Tax Optimization Scheme” if they
had included: (a) identification of the involved trading and offshore companies (listed in the
exhibits to the Report); (b) the monetary value of the investments made and tax savings
achieved by Yukos through the scheme; (c) details of the extent of the trading companies’
investments in Russia’s low-tax regions; (d) details the extent of Yukos’ direction of and
control over the trading companies; (e) details of the flow of funds from the trading companies
to Yukos; (f) details about the taxes assessed against Yukos’ trading companies in the ZATO of
Lesnoy in 1999 and 2000 and the Republic of Kalmykia in 2001 due to improperly received tax
benefits; and (g) disclosure of the possible financial impact on Yukos if the tax optimization

scheme was disallowed by the Russian authorities.

Mr. Gross concludes that the statements for the years 2000-2002 and the first three quarters of
2003 were not transparent with regard to Yukos’ tax optimization scheme, as they disclosed
none of the above-listed information necessary to put a reader on notice. While the statements
showed that Yukos’ effective tax level was lower than the statutory tax level, they failed to
explain the nature of the difference. The statements also failed, according to Mr. Gross, to

identify the companies composing the Jurby Lake structure.

Mr. Gross also concludes that the 2001-2002 statements were not transparent and not
consistent with the U.S. GAAP in that they failed to disclose as contingent liabilities the taxes
assessed against the trading companies of the ZATO of Lesnoy for 1999 and 2000, despite the
fact that these tax assessments were material to the statements. Under the U.S. GAAP, Yukos
could omit these assessments from the statements if it determined that the probability of loss
was remote; however, the written support of outside legal counsel or another competent
authority which would usually be required for such a determination was not obtained in this
case. Mr. Gross opines that Yukos should have disclosed that the validity of the tax
optimization scheme had been called into question and discussed the risk involved in

continuing with the scheme.

11. Professor Dr. Albert Jan van den Berg

Professor Dr. Albert Jan van den Berg''* of Hanotiau & van den Berg in Brussels, specializes in
international arbitration. He was previously in private practice in the Netherlands and is a
professor at Erasmus University in Rotterdam. Respondent retained Professor Van den Berg to
provide an expert opinion addressing the legality under Dutch law of the 2005 transfer of Yukos’

foreign assets into the Stichtings. Claimants chose not to cross-examine Professor Van den Berg.

Professor Van den Berg was provided with a 12-page Statement of Assumed Facts on which to
base his opinion. These assumed facts may be summarized as follows. Before the auction of
YNG in December 2004, Yukos’ assets outside the Russian Federation (the “Foreign Assets”)
were held by two wholly-owned subsidiaries of Yukos, Yukos Finance B.V. (“Yukos
Finance”) and Yukos CIS Investment Limited (“Yukos CIS”). After the auction, Yukos
management transferred the Foreign Assets to the two Stichtings, which issued depositary
receipts in return to Yukos Finance and Wincanton Holding BV (“Wincanton”), a Dutch
subsidiary of Yukos CIS. This restructuring had the “stated purpose . . . to prevent the
non-Russian assets of Yukos Oil from being used to satisfy the tax debts that Russian courts
had found Yukos Oil to owe, and, more broadly, to prevent the non-Russian assets from being

available to satisfy claims of Yukos’ Russian creditors.”

Under the Articles of A jation of the Stichti ( ded in 2008), the board,
including former Yukos managers David Godfrey, Bruce Misamore and Steven Theede,
manages the Foreign Assets in the interests of Yukos, its subsidiaries, shareholders, employees
and “legitimate” creditors. As a result of the restructuring: (a) even after Yukos CIS and
Yukos Finance were sold in Yukos’ bankruptcy auction, the former Yukos managers have
continued to manage and control the Foreign Assets; (b) the lending group under a USD
1 billion loan was unable to enforce an English judgment against Yukos Finance’s assets; and
(c) Moravel, whose loan had been held to be unenforceable by Russian courts because of its
status as a subsidiary of Yukos, was able to negotiate the repayment of its loan from one of the

Stichtings.

Based on the above-described assumed facts, Professor Van den Berg opines that the
restructuring of Yukos Finance and Yukos CIS was illegal, as Dutch law does not permit a
Legal Opinion on the Validity of Restructuring Devices under Dutch Law by Professor Dr. Albert Jan van den Berg,

14 August 2012 (hereinafter “Van den Berg Report”). References to Professor Van den Berg’s legal opinion appear in
Chapter VIILG (The Bankruptcy of Yukos).

a

company to transfer its assets for the purpose of making it more difficult for a creditor to satisfy
its claims, or for the new ultimate parent company to exercise control. This is so even when a
company believes the claims against it are illegitimate. The company is not entitled to exercise

self-help.

According to Professor Van den Berg, this illegality gave rise to the directors’ “internal
liability” (liability of the directors to the company itself) pursuant to Articles 2:8 and 2:9 of the
Dutch Civil Code (the “DCC”) and to the directors’ “external liability” (liability of the
directors to creditors) as well as “company liability” (liability of the company to creditors)
pursuant to Article 6:162 of the DCC. Further, this illegality renders the board decisions
regarding the restructuring voidable pursuant to Articles 2:8 and 2:15(1)(b) of the DCC (as
contrary to the principles of reasonableness and fairness) and pursuant to Article 3:40(1) of the
DCC (as contrary to “good morals”). Professor Van den Berg opines that the Stichtings are
also disallowed as invalid permanent protective devices; even if they are treated as temporary

protective devices, the requirements to uphold such temporary devices are not met in this case.

12. Professor Stef van Weeghel

The Tribunal recalls that Respondent had raised the question of “unclean hands” in the
jurisdictional phase of the case, an issue which the Tribunal decided to defer for consideration

6

until the merits phase of the arbitration.''’ During the jurisdictional phase of the case,

Respondent had adduced expert testimony from Professor Stef van Weeghel,''”

a professor of
international tax law at the University of Amsterdam and a tax law partner at Stibbe. In his
expert report, Professor Van Weeghel reached three main conclusions about Claimants and
taxation law, as summarized in the Interim Awards.''® The Parties did not reference his report
in their pleadings in the merits phase of the case and he was not cross-examined at the Hearing
on the Merits. The Tribunal has decided to include in the Final Awards the summary of

Professor Van Weeghel’s expert evidence.

According to Professor Van Weeghel, Hulley was not entitled to obtain the taxation benefits

contained in the Cyprus-Russia DTA in respect of the Yukos dividends because: (a) Hulley

had a permanent establishment in Russia under Article 10(4) of the Cyprus-Russia DTA) as it
either had a place of management in Russia, or it had an agent in Russia; and (b) those
dividends were attributable to the permanent establishment in Russia. He also opines that VPL
was similarly not entitled to obtain the taxation benefits contained in the Cyprus-Russia DTA
because it was not the beneficial owner of the Yukos dividends within the meaning of

Article 10(2) of the Cyprus-Russia DTA.

According to Professor Van Weeghel, the Yukos holding structure is a sham or otherwise
abusive under general principles of international tax law and designed specifically to avoid
taxation obligations. Therefore rights to tax benefits under the Cyprus-Russia DTA should be
denied. Tax authorities do not always have to accept artificial legal constructions. Anti-abuse
doctrines to counter artificial legal constructions have developed in and are common to many
countries including the Russian Federation and Cyprus. Professor Van Weeghel refers to the
example of the Swiss Federal Court denying the benefits of a double taxation treaty to a Danish
company in circumstances analogous to the Yukos holding structure. He refers to international
efforts to control the use of tax havens and notes that the OECD Forum on Harmful Tax
Practices in its 2000 Progress Report identified 35 tax havens which included the Isle of Man,
Gibraltar, Jersey and the British Virgin Islands. Professor Van Weeghel examines the Yukos
holding structure, and notes that at the bottom of the structure is the successful and profitable
Russian oil company developing and exploiting natural energy resources in Russia, while at the
top of the structure are a small number of Russian individual shareholders. He concludes that it
is “hardly perceivable” that the Russian individual shareholders, in setting up the Yukos
holding structure, had any other goal in mind than low taxation and lack of transparency in
respect of the ownership of Yukos shares. Such a structure would normally fall within the

scope of international efforts to counter the harmful use of tax havens.

THE SO-CALLED “EMPTY CHAIRS”

At the Hearing on the Merits, each side accused the other of leaving conspicuous “empty
chairs” in its presentation of witness evidence. Each side asked the Tribunal to draw adverse
inferences against the other from the absence of the persons who should have filled the empty

chairs.'”

1. Individuals that Claimants Wished were Available for Examination

At the Hearing, Claimants submitted that the following individuals should have been called as
witnesses by Respondent as they could have been cross-examined in respect of the knowledge

of Yukos’ tax structure by high-ranking Russian officials:

. Aleksei Kudrin, First Deputy Minister of Finance, including in particular on the
January 2000 meeting with Mr. Dubov at which the establishment of Yukos’
trading companies in Mordovia was discussed;

. Vladimir Gusev, First Deputy Minister in charge of VAT, including in particular on
the meeting with Mr. Dubov at which Yukos’ VAT refunds in Mordovia were
discussed;

. Alexander Pochinok, Tax Minister, including in particular on the December 1999
meeting with Mr. Dubov at which Yukos’ plan to use trading companies in
Mordovia was discussed;

. Alexander Smirnov, First Deputy Minister of Tax, including in particular on the
December 1999 meeting with Mr. Dubov; and

. Nicolai Merkushkin, Head of the Republic of Mordovia, including in particular on

the December 1999 meeting.'”°
Claimants also argued that they should have had the opportunity to hear from and examine the
following individuals in respect of their knowledge of Yukos’ tax structure derived from the

audits of Yukos’ trading companies:

. P. A. Puschin, Senior Tax Inspector of Russian Tax Ministry’s Interregional
Inspectorate for major Taxpayer No. 1; and

. A.V. Ivushkina, Senior Tax Inspector of Russian Tax Ministry’s Interregional
Inspectorate for major Taxpayer No. 1.'?!
In addition, Claimants complained that they did not have the opportunity to hear from and
examine Sergei Bogdanchikov, the President of Rosneft, on the circumstances of Rosneft’s
acquisition of Baikal in December 2004 and Rosneft’s agreement with a syndicate of Western
banks led by Société Générale S.A. (the “Western Banks”) regarding the initiation of Yukos’
bankruptey.'*

Finally, Claimants argued that they should have had the opportunity to hear from and examine
the following individuals in respect of PwC’s audit of Yukos and the circumstances of the

withdrawal of PwC’s audit reports:

. Douglas Miller, Director, ZAO PwC Audit, including in particular regarding the
work conducted for the purposes of the certification of Yukos’ accounts for years
1998-2003 and the circumstances of the withdrawal of the reports in 2007; and

. Michael Kubena, General Director, ZAO PwC Audit, including in particular
regarding the establishment of Yukos’ tax optimization structure and its legality.'”*

2. Individuals that Respondent Wished were Available for Examination

At the Hearing, Respondent argued that the following individuals should have been made
available for questioning with respect to: (a) the establishment and history of Yukos’ “tax
optimization” schemes and Yukos’ understanding of their legality; (b) Yukos’ relationship with
its Lesnoy, Mordovian, and other “sham” trading shells; and (c) Yukos’ reaction to the
assessments against and criminal investigation of the Lesnoy and Trekhgorniy trading shells,
including the restructurings and liquidations, the instructions to destroy documents, and other

apparent attempts at obstruction:
. Dmitry Gololobov, Yukos’ former Deputy General Counsel;
. Irina Golub, Yukos’ former Chief Accountant;

. Dmitry Maruev, former head of the Financial Engineering Section of Yukos
Treasury Department (Deputy Chief Accountant);

. Alexey Smirnov, former head of Yukos’ Tax Department;

. Vasily Shakhnovsky, GML shareholder/beneficiary and former President of Yukos-
Moscow; and

¢ Mikhail Brudno, GML shareholder/beneficiary.'*

According to Respondent, Mr. Golobolov, together with Mr. Sergey Pepeliaev, Yukos’ tax
counsel, could also have addressed the following issues: (a) Yukos’ unsuccessful attempts to
obtain a legal opinion approving its “tax optimization” schemes, including why Mr. Pepeliaev

did not provide a legal opinion to Yukos on the schemes prior to the 29 December 2003 tax

audit report; (b) the bases for Yukos’ responses and reactions to the 29 December 2003 tax
audit report, and the bases on which outside counsel prepared its post-hoc opinions for Yukos
on the “tax optimization” schemes; and (c) the reasons why Yukos tried to file “annual”
amended VAT returns, and did not submit proper amended monthly VAT returns after the

“annual” ones were rejected.'?°

Respondent also argued that on the issue of Yukos’ consideration of an enhanced ADR listing,
including warnings that were provided to Yukos’ senior management concerning the substantial
risks of disclosing Yukos’ “tax optimization” schemes in connection with such a listing, the
failure to disclose Messrs. Khodorkovsky’s and Lebedev’s relationship to the BBS Companies,
and Mr. Khodorkovsky’s concerns for his own personal liability if he signed Yukos’ F-1

Registration Statement, Claimants should have made available for testimony:

. Pavel Malyi, former Deputy Head of Yukos’ Corporate Finance Department; and

. Oleg Sheiko, former Vice President/Director of Yukos’ Corporate Finance
Department.'”°

On issues relating to the understanding by Yukos’ Russian management of the legality of
Yukos’ “tax optimization” scheme, Respondent complained about the absence of:

. Yury Beilin, Yukos’ former Deputy CEO; and

* Simon Kukes, Yukos’ former CEO.'””

Finally, with respect to GML’s “sustained and aggressive threats that deterred broader
participation in the YNG and bankruptcy auctions,” Respondent wished they could have heard

from and examined Mr. Tim Osborne, GML Director and member of the Stichtings’ boards.

ISSUES FOR ANALYSIS

In this second phase of the present arbitrations, the Parties presented their arguments and
evidence on the many substantive issues related directly to the merits of the case under

Articles 10 and 13 of the ECT. In addition, the Parties presented extensive argument on the

Respondent's Rebuttal Slides, pp. 656-57; see also Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief 4 136.

two preliminary objections that the Tribunal had decided to defer to the merits phase, namely
the objection based on Claimants’ alleged “unclean hands” and the objection based on

Article 21 of the ECT.

The deferred preliminary objections—like the merits issues—require the Tribunal to untangle
the complex factual matrix underlying Claimant’s claims. Indeed, the Tribunal had decided to
defer the preliminary objections relating to alleged “unclean hands” and Article 21 to avoid

making findings on these important questions in a vacuum.

This Award therefore begins, in Part VIII, with the Tribunal’s analysis of the factual issues.
Guided in large measure by the Parties’ presentations of the issues, the Tribunal considers it

convenient to analyze the evidentiary record under the following eight headings
A. — Yukos’ Tax Optimization Scheme

B. _ The Russian Federation’s Tax Assessments

Cc. Harassment, Intimidation and Arrests

D. — Unwinding of the Yukos—Sibneft Merger

E. _Yukos’ Attempts to Settle its Tax Liabilities

F. Auction of YNG

G. The Bankruptcy of Yukos

H. — The Withdrawal of PwC’s Audit Opinions

As mentioned previously, the Tribunal, in Part VIII, makes determinations in respect of the
many highly contested issues of fact and observations on the significance of various facts and

findings.

Next, in Part IX of this Award, the Tribunal turns to Respondent’s preliminary objections.

Specifically, the Tribunal considers:

A. — whether all or some of Claimants’ claims are barred by the “fork-in-the-road” provision
in Article 26(3)(b)(i) of the ECT (the Tribunal dismissed this objection in the Interim

Awards, but Respondent has renewed the objection in this merits phase);

- 99 -

262.

263.

264.

265.

B. whether Claimants’ conduct—their alleged “unclean hands’”—deprives Claimants of
protection under the ECT (in the Interim Awards, the Tribunal confirmed the deferral of
its decision on this objection to the merits phase of this arbitration, consistent with

Procedural Order No. 3); and/or

Cc. whether Article 21 of the ECT, which contains a “carve out” for “Taxation Measures”,
bars the Claimants’ claims either as a matter of jurisdiction or admissibility (in the
Interim Awards, the Tribunal decided to defer these issues to the merits phase, to avoid

ruling on them in a vacuum).

Since the Tribunal dismisses each of Respondent’s preliminary objections, thereby confirming
that it has jurisdiction over Claimants’ claims under the ECT, it next addresses Respondent’s

liability under the ECT. This analysis is undertaken in Part X of the Award.

Claimants allege that R di by di and legal pr di against

Yukos, its subsidiaries, and their management, has failed to accord Claimants’ investments fair

 

and equitable treatment. In particular, Claimants allege Respondent failed to refrain from
impairing the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment and disposal of Claimants’
investments by unreasonable or discriminatory measures, in contravention of Article 10 of the
ECT. Claimants maintain that the treatment of Yukos was discriminatory as compared to other

Russian oil companies.

Claimants further submit that Respondent’s actions amount to an expropriation of the
Claimants’ investments, in breach of Article 13 of the ECT. According to Claimants, the
alleged interventions of Respondent, and other entities directed and controlled by it—including
in the Sibneft demerger, the sale of YNG at a cost alleged to be much lower than its real value
to Baikal (a special purpose company that was quickly bought by the State-owned oil company
Rosneft) and the pursuit of Yukos’ bankruptcy proceedings—resulted in the total loss of value

of Claimants’ investments.

Claimants contend that Respondent’s actions were politically and economically motivated,
rather than aimed at legitimate tax enforcement. In that regard, Claimants purport to establish
that Respondent acted through almost all its organs, at all levels, in seeking the destruction of

Yukos.

129

In response, Respondent contends that Claimants have failed to establish a violation under
either Articles 10 or 13 of the ECT. For Respondent, this case is about Yukos’ tax evasion,”
and therefore about Yukos’ self-inflicted demise: Respondent contends that any losses suffered
by Claimants are attributable to their own actions, those of the Yukos managers they installed
and allegedly controlled, and of Messrs. Khodorkovsky, Lebedev, Nevzlin, Dubov, Brudno,
Shakhnovsky and Golubovitch (the so-called “Oligarchs”). It follows, argues Respondent, that
Claimants had no legitimate expectation that Russian tax law would not be applied to them and

their investment when Yukos breached its tax obligations.

In addition to lacking the factual predicate for an expropriation claim under Article 13 of the
ECT, Respondent also contends that Claimants’ claims fail because the assessment and
collection of taxes is in the public interest, as to which States are afforded a wide margin of
discretion. Respondent maintains that its conduct in this regard did not radically depart from

either Russian law or international norms.

To the extent that Claimants allege discriminatory taxation compared to other Russian oil
companies—in contravention of the fair and equitable treatment in Article 10 of the ECT, as
well as one of Article 13’s four conditions for a lawful expropriation—Respondent answers that
these claims fail because Claimants do not contend that their investment was subjected to
discrimination based on foreign ownership. Respondent also disputes the facts presented by

Claimants in support of their allegations of discrimination.

Respondent further contends that Claimants’ allegations of due process violations with respect
to tax, tax enforcement, the sale of YNG and Yukos’ bankruptcy proceedings are equally

meritless, and, in any event, did not affect the management and operations of Yukos.

The Tribunal’s conclusions on these liability issues, in Part X, follow necessarily as the legal
consequences of its factual conclusions in Part VIII. The Tribunal includes in Part X its
decision on the attribution of the conduct of various actors to the Russian Federation, and its

findings in relation to Claimant’s contributory fault.

Finally, in Parts XI, XII and XIII of this Award, respectively, the Tribunal decides the issues

relating to interest, the quantification of damages, and the allocation of costs.

ANALYSIS OF THE EVIDENTIARY RECORD
THE TAX OPTIMIZATION SCHEME
1. Introduction

In the latter years of the twentieth century and in the early years of the twenty first, oil
companies in the Russian Federation were growing, consolidating and becoming large
corporate entities. By the end of 2000, there were nine major oil companies in Russia. Yukos
was the largest, followed by Lukoil. During that period, all nine major oil companies operated
in a similar fashion. The key features of their operations were firstly vertical integration;
secondly transfer pricing; and thirdly the use of low-tax regions to mitigate tax burdens.'"” In
relation to the third element, one-time Prime Minister of Russia, Mikhail Kasyanov stated that

“the tax havens in the ZATOs had been used by every oil company.”"*! In fact,

[tJhousands of companies took advantage of the low-tax regimes available in Russian tax
havens zones, including businesses engaged in construction, services, the sale of oil
products, investments, as well as holding companies and groups of companies involved in
financing and taxation arrangements. This activity was well known to the Russian
government, including the Federal Tax Ministry.'*?
Respondent acknowledges that the majority of large Russian oil companies operated in a way
similar to Yukos and did “use low-tax regions to evade taxes.” At the same time, Respondent
alleges that those companies did so “on a much more modest scale in comparison to Yukos.”
In this sense, Yukos was a typical Russian oil company, as it also used the low-tax regions as
part of its tax optimization strategy. A central disputed issue in this arbitration concerns the
legality, under Russian law, of the modalities of Yukos’ use of the low-tax regions. Was Yukos
merely taking advantage of the legislative arrangements in place to minimize its taxes, or was

there an element of abuse in its scheme? A related disputed issue concerns the legitimacy of

the tax assessments against Yukos that began in December 2003. Was the Russian Federation
merely enforcing its tax laws, or rather was it carrying out a punitive campaign against Yukos
and its principal beneficial owners? Were the other Russian oil companies subjected to the
same tax enforcement actions by the Russian Federation, or was Yukos discriminated against
and specifically targeted by the Russian Federation? Before turning to the question of the
legitimacy of those tax assessments, which the Tribunal does in the next chapter of the Award,
the Tribunal considers it important to address the first question: were Yukos’ practices in the
low-tax regions, and specifically the practices of Yukos’ trading companies in those regions,

lawful?

In sections 2 and 3 of this chapter, the Tribunal summarizes the evidence that was presented by
the Parties regarding the structure and legal framework of Yukos’ tax optimization scheme. In
section 4, the Tribunal distills, as best it can from the massive documentary record, the complex
and extensive background relating to the activities and audits of the Yukos trading entities
before December 2003. Finally, in section 5, the Tribunal reviews, on the basis of this complex

record, the legality of Yukos’ tax optimization scheme under Russian law.

The Tribunal observes that it considers the question of the legality of the tax optimization
scheme to be a matter of fact in the present arbitration. It is not the role of the Tribunal in the
present proceedings to review and determine, as if it were a Russian court of appeal, the
decisions made pursuant to Russian law in respect of the legality of this scheme. However,
even in considering the issue as a matter of fact, the Tribunal’s observations on the legality of
Yukos’ tax optimization scheme based on what the record reveals will inform its decision on

the principal legal questions facing the Tribunal under the ECT.

2. The Structure of the Tax Optimization Scheme

The Tribunal has been presented with an enormous volume of material relating to Yukos’
structure and tax optimization scheme. In short, Yukos’ tax optimization scheme consisted of
using “trading companies” located in the low-tax regions as intermediaries in the chain of
transactions between Yukos’ core oil-producing entities YNG, Samaraneftegaz and Tomskneft
at one end, and its customers at the other. The trading companies at issue were established in
three types of low-tax regions. The first type was closed administrative territories, or ZATOs
(Lesnoy, Trekhgorny, Sarov). ZATOs are territories established in the former Soviet Union as
defense and nuclear sites, or as sites with sensitive military, scientific or industrial significance

which faced economic catastrophe at the end of the Cold War. For this reason, special tax

- 103 -

278.

regimes were instituted in those territories aimed at boosting economic activity." The second
type was “domestic-offshore territories”, regions that faced significant economic challenges
and where the Russian Federation wanted to facilitate investment (Mordovia, Evenkia,
Kalmykia).'*> The third low-tax region was Baikonur, a former spaceport, which was treated as

a ZATO but is on the territory of Kazakhstan.'*°

The names of the trading entities of particular relevance in this arbitration and the regions or

ZATOs in which they were located are set out in the following table:

In 2000, sales were conducted by at least 16 of these companies. From 2001 to 2003, Yukos

employed at least eight such companies, and in 2004 at least three of them. Through this

structure, Yukos was able to capture much of the profit from the sale of crude oil to its

customers on the books of the entities in the low-tax regions, thus benefiting from substantial

tax savings.

Some of these after-tax profits, in turn, left the Russian Federation through

dividends to the off-shore holding companies that Yukos controlled (for U.S. GAAP

consolidation purposes) through trusts and call options.'*”

3. The Legal Framework of the Tax Optimization Scheme

(a)

The Low-Tax Region Program

The low-tax region program was established in the 1990s to foster economic development in

impoverished areas of the Russian Federation. The Russian low-tax regions were allowed to

exempt taxpayers from federal corporate profit taxfor the purpose of encouraging taxpayers”

investments in their regions, provided the taxpayers complied with certain requirements. There

is no dispute between the Parties as to the source of the formal requirements; it is agreed that

they are to be found in the low-tax regions’ legislation, any applicable tax investment

agreements, and the applicable federal legislation, including the Russian Tax Code.

More

controversial, and contested by Claimants, is the existence and significance of various so-called

“anti-abuse” doctrines which, according to Respondent, have been established and applied in

decisions of Russia’s federal courts.

jurisprudence in the next subsection.

The Tribunal addresses these doctrines and the relevant

The benefits provided in the low-tax regions were related to profit tax, which was described by

Mr. Konnov in his first report as follows:

29.

See Lys Reports,

Profit tax is a federal tax, however tax revenues are shared between the federal,
regional and (in certain years) local budgets. Through the end of 2001, profit tax
was governed by the Law of the Russian Federation No. 2116-1 “On Tax on Profit

- 105 -

282.

283.

of Enterprises and Organisations” dated December 27, 1991 (the “Profit Tax Law”)
and subsequently by Chapter 25 of the Tax Code. In 1999-2006, profit tax rates
applicable to Russian entities and foreign entities having a permanent establishment
in Russia (with respect to income attributable to such permanent establishments)
were as follows:

With respect to the tax benefits available in the ZATOs (e.g., Lesnoy and Trekhgorny), in 1999,
the ZATOs were allowed to fully exempt taxpayers from federal corporate profit tax. In 2000,
most ZATOs were allowed to exempt taxpayers from the portion of the federal corporate profit
tax that was payable to their budget (i.e., up to 19 percent). In 2001, all ZATOs were permitted
to exempt taxpayers from the portion of the federal corporate profit tax that was payable to their

budget (i.e., also up to 19 percent). In 2002, however, these exemptions were revoked.

With respect to the tax benefits available in other low-tax regions (e.g., Mordovia, Kalmykia
and Evenkia), in 2000 and 2001, such regions were allowed to fully exempt taxpayers from the
portion of the federal corporate profit tax that was payable to their budget (ie., up to
19 percent). From 1 July 2002 until 31 December 2003, low-tax regions were allowed to
exempt taxpayers from the portion of the federal corporate profit tax payable to their budget,
but only up to four percent. An exception existed for “grandfathered” tax investment
agreements entered into prior to | July 2001, and these taxpayers could still receive a zero
percent tax rate on the relevant portion of the profit tax if they fulfilled certain other conditions.
As of | January 2004, the existing tax investment agreements were terminated, but the Russian
Tax Code still allowed low-tax regions to reduce the federal corporate profit tax payable to

their budget up to four percent.

(b) Anti-Abuse Decisions and Doctrines Promulgated by Russia’s Federal Courts

Before considering the individual court decisions in which the anti-abuse doctrines are said to
have been developed and applied, the Tribunal will describe the different courts within the
judicial system of the Russian Federation.'**

The Russian court system is based on four types of distinct judicial procedures—constitutional,
civil, administrative and criminal.'*? Each area has created its own court structure. For its civil
procedure, Russia created a system of commercial, or “arbitrazh” courts. The arbitrazh courts
have jurisdiction over general commercial disputes and disputes directly relating to commercial
matters, such as tax disputes. At the first instance, there are 81 arbitrazh courts, located in and

‘40 At the next level, the appellate

for the constituent entities of the Russian Federation.
instance, there are 20 appellate arbitrazh courts. Then, at the “cassation instance,” there are ten
federal arbitrazh courts.'*' At the apex of the Russian commercial courts system is the Supreme

Arbitrazh Court of the Russian Federation.'*

The Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation and the local constitutional courts of its
constituent entities are the courts created for Russia’s constitutional procedure. Among its
other functions, the Constitutional Court plays a supervisory role over all four Russian judicial
procedures at the federal level; the local constitutional courts play the same role at the level of
the constituent entities. The task of the Constitutional Court is to ensure compliance of the

judiciary with the Constitution of the Russian Federation (“Russian Constitution”).'" In this

This information is derived from the Constitution of the Russian Federation, Exh. C-1698 (hereinafter “Rt
Constitution”) and other particulars in the public domain of interest to narration of the many decisions of the courts of
the Russian Federation which the Tribunal reviews.

 

  

 

Russian Constitution, Article 118(2), Exh. C-1698.

  
 

 

Russia as a federation con: f 83 “constituent entities” —relatively autonomous territorial and political units. Most
of them have their own constitutions, local laws, presidents, governments, parliaments, and court system:
for example, is a “constituent entity”. The judicial districts usually match up with thes
political units, but there are several “mismatches”: there are 83 “constituent entitie:
arbitrazh courts.

   

   
 

 

   

In 2000, the Russian Federation created “federal districts”, which are administrative units that group several
“constituent entiti Currently there are eight federal districts. Since there are ten federal arbitrazh courts but only
eight federal districts, there is a “mismatch” there too. For example, the Siberian Federal District has two federal
arbitrazh courts, which are the Federal Arbitrazh Court of the East Siberian District and the Federal Arbitrazh Court of
the West Siberian District.

  
    

In late 2013, the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation announced a judicial reform which would result in
merging the Supreme Arbitrazh Court of the Russian Federation with the Supreme Court, which is the apex of the
general jurisdiction courts. The reform has not yet been finalized.

capacity, the Constitutional Court is the court of last resort, which decides whether a particular
law applied by the courts of lower instance is constitutional. For example, an individual or a
company may apply to the Constitutional Court in a tax matter when the individual or company
considers that a particular provision of the Russian Tax Code applied by an arbitrazh court is
not incompliance with the Russian Constitution. The decisions of the Constitutional Court are

not subject to appeal.
The Tribunal turns now to the anti-abuse principle under Russian law.

Respondent’s expert on Russian law, Mr. Oleg Konnov, introduced the anti-abuse principle as

follows:

It is essential to distinguish clearly between the legitimate use of the tax benefits and abuse
of tax law. Russian law generally prohibits abuse of law. The constitutional anti-abuse
principle has been incorporated in some branches of law (e.g. civil law). However, it has
been consistently applied even in branches of law where no explicit provisions have been
included in the text of the law, e.g. labour law and tax law. In these instances, Russian
courts have themselves developed anti-abuse doctrines. In the tax area, anti-abuse
doctrines have been used to combat aggressive tax planning and abuse.

One should not be misled by the terminology. Even though the term “substance over
form” is not commonly used in Russia, the terms “bad faith,” “abuse of rights,”
“proportionality” and “business substance” are used to achieve the same result as the
“substance over form” notion in other countries.

Courts (including the highest courts of Russia) accepted and consistently applied anti-
abuse measures both before and after the YUKOS tax cases. The anti-abuse doctrines have
been evolving over the time. In some cases, the tax authorities challenged the abusive
transactions based on the application of civil law principles (“sham” and “fictitious”
transactions and transactions “deliberately contrary to fundamentals of civil law and
morality”), and in others they applied the notions of “bad faith” and “unjustified tax
benefit” developed by court practice. There were also cases in which the tax authorities
used a combination of legal principles to challenge tax avoidance misconduct.'+

 

 

decided by the “entities”. At the same time, the Russian Constitution does not allow the “entities” to act contrary to
the Russian Federation even within the “entity’” assigned autonomy. For example, one of the tasks of the
Constitutional Court is to ensure that the local laws of the “entities” are in compliance with the Russian Constitution
and the federal laws.

 

   

First Konnov Report §/ 45-47. Mr. Konnov cites: Article 17(3) of the Russian Constitution, Exh. R-2211; Resolution
of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation No. 3-P, 15 March 2005, section 4.3, Exh. R-2217 (as support
for the proposition that the Constitutional Court describes non-abuse of law as a general legal principle); an assistant
professor of the faculty of law of the Higher School of Economi: In general terms, anti-
abuse principle is set forth in Article 17 (3) of the Russian Constitution according to which exercise of rights and
freedoms by citizens and individuals may not violate rights and freedoms of other persons. This principle is set forth
in Chapter 2 of the Russian Constitution governing rights and freedoms of citizens and individuals. However these
rights and freedoms may be applied to legal persons to the extent their nature permits so (s nce, par
Section 4 of dicta of the Constitutional Court Ruling No. 20-P dated December 17, 1996, para. 4 Section 2 of dicta of

Court PRACTICE (Consultant Plus, 2009), Exh. R-2214). Mr. Kurbatov also writes: “It would be fundamentally
wrong to consider anti-abuse as only civil law (branch) principle. It may, however, be set in provisions of specific
branches of law”); Resolution of the Plenum of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation No. 2, 17 March 2004, at

289.

290.

291.

292.

In support of his assertion that the various anti-abuse doctrines are part of Russian law,
Mr. Konnov relies on a series of decisions issued by various Russian courts, starting with the
decision of the Supreme Arbitrazh Court No. 367/96 on 17 September 1996 (“Sibservice”) and
including recent cases such as the 2010 Novozlatoustovskoye decision of the same court.
Between these bookends, particular reliance is placed on Constitutional Court Ruling 138-0 of
25 July 2001 (which introduced the concept of “bad-faith taxpayer”) and on Resolution No. 53
dated 12 October 2006 of the Plenum of the Russian Supreme Arbitrazh Court
(“Resolution No. 53”)(which linked the concepts of “unjustified tax benefit”, “actual economic

substance” of a transaction and the “business purpose” of a taxpayer’s actions).

According to Mr. Konnov, the cases upholding the tax assessments against Yukos
(i.e., confirming the tax authorities’ position that Yukos’ tax optimization scheme was abusive)
were “an integral part of the evolution of the ‘business substance’ doctrine which eventually
resulted in adoption by the Russian Supreme Arbitrazh Court on 12 October 2006 of Resolution
No. 53.”"""

Claimants argue that the “business purpose” doctrine could not possibly have played any role in
the tax assessments against Yukos, since “it did not exist in Russian law at the time, having
only been introduced into Russian law in 2006" (in Resolution No. 53 of the Plenum of the
Russian Supreme Arbitrazh Court). Indeed, Claimants note, “the notion of business purpose
was never mentioned in the December 29, 2003 Audit Report and played no role in the tax
assessments against Yukos.”'*”

The Tribunal’s task in evaluating the Parties’ arguments is a difficult one. As with many
aspects of this case, the record is voluminous and, in certain respects, contradictory. Moreover,
regarding issues of Russian tax law, the Tribunal heard only from Mr. Konnov; Claimants put

forward no testimony challenging Mr. Konnov’s interpretation of the relevant cases from an

 

 

clause 27, Exh. R-2213 (“If a court iblishes the fact that the employee abused his rights, the court can dismiss his
claim on reinstatement in a job ... since in the specified the employer should not be responsible for the adverse
consequences resulting from the employee’ bad faith actions.”). See also V.V. Arkhipov, Abuse of Rights in Labor
Relations: Wilful Hoax or Honest Mistake?, Zakonodatelstvo i Ekonomika, No. 2, 2008, Exh. R-2215; Civil Code of
the Russian Federation, entered into force on | January 1995, Articles 10, 169, 170, Exh. R-909 (hereinafter “Russian
Civil Code”). Mr. Konnovy notes that in a number of cases Article 170 of the Civil Code was applied jointly with
Article 169 of the Russian Civil Code.

expert on the subject. And, as discussed further below, Claimants’ counsel chose not to cross-
examine Mr. Konnov on the existence or evolution of the anti-abuse doctrines. At the same
time, in argument, Claimants have challenged almost every aspect of Mr. Konnov’s testimony,

including on the existence and evolution of the anti-abuse doctrine.

Therefore the Tribunal has had to delve into the voluminous record, including the translations
of dozens of Russian court decisions and commentaries thereon, to come to its own view on
what anti-abuse principles may have existed during the period relevant for an analysis of

Yukos’ tax optimization scheme.

The earliest cases relied upon by Respondent, from the mid-1990s, appear to rely on a
“substance over form” doctrine. These cases include Sibservice and the Resolution of the
Presidium of the Supreme Arbitrazh Court No. 3661/96 on 21 January 1997 (“Yekaterinburg
Telephone”).

Mr. Konnov summarizes these cases as follows:

a. As early as in 1996, the Russian Supreme Arbitrazh Court reviewed a case
involving the Russia-Austrian joint venture Sibservice. Sibservice was assembling
and selling computers. Its sales of computers were subject to VAT. In order to
defer or avoid VAT payment, Sibservice entered into loan agreements with
customers under which the customers purportedly loaned funds to Sibservice, and
Sibservice purportedly repaid the loans by transferring computers to the customers.
Based on the letter of the law, the making of the loan and the repayment of the loan
(unlike sale of computers) were exempt from VAT. The Supreme Arbitrazh Court
focused on substance of the transactions between Sibservice and its customers and
ruled that the sale of computers had been artificially structured using the loan
agreements, thereby supporting the position of the tax authorities. Specifically, the
Supreme Arbitrazh Court noted that:

“The conclusion of the state tax inspectorate that Joint Venture
Sibservice supplied the goods on the condition of the prepayment of
their price [is justified] since the relations with the customers (buyers)
were actually developed that way (supply, contractor relationships)
regardless of the name of the agreement.”

b. One year later, in 1997, the Russian Supreme Arbitrazh Court reviewed a case
involving the state-owned enterprise Yekaterinburg City Telephone Network. In
1994, the state-owned enterprise had concluded what they claimed to be several
joint venture agreements with private persons and legal entities according to which
the participants allegedly agreed to cooperate for the purposes of developing the
telephone network of the city of Yekaterinburg. The private persons and legal
entities made what purported to be joint venture financing contributions to the state
enterprise which they claimed were exempt from VAT and VAT surtax under the
then applicable law. ‘The tax authorities conducted a tax audit of the state enterprise
and concluded that in practice no true joint venture activity had been conducted and,
therefore, VAT and VAT surtax had to apply. The Presidium of the Russian
Supreme Arbitrazh Court supported this conclusion:

“In fact, those transactions have been made in order to raise financing
from the relevant entities and individuals in order to finance the
claimant’s business.”

With reference to this case, a group of prominent Russian scholars noted later that
Russian tax law required that the tax consequences of a transaction or other
arrangement be determined according to its substance rather than its form:

. Therefore, the arbitrazh courts as well as the tax authorities
currently follow the principle of “substance of contract over its name
(form)”. Thus, any attempts to conceal the real substance of an
agreement by using a name of a different contract will most likely be
fruitless.”'“*

Respondent also refers to Constitutional Court Resolution No. 14-P, 28 October 1999
(“Energomashbank”), which, according to Respondent, “reiterated the notion that when
looking at the tax aspects of a particular transaction, Russian courts should be mindful of its
substance, and not merely its form.” Mr. Konnov describes the case as follows in his First

Expert Report:

d. Likewise in 1999 the Russian Constitutional Court in the Energomashbank case
advised Russian courts to analyze the substance of transactions rather than their
form:

“... in instances when the courts while examining a case fail to investigate
in essence actual facts thereof but limit themselves to the establishment of
formal conditions of the application of the law only, the right to judicial
defence envisaged by Part | of Article 46 of the Constitution of the Russian
Federation is found to be substantially infringed."

In their Reply, Claimants write that the Sibservice and Yekaterinburg Telephone cases:

involved the application of the principles enshrined in Article 170 of the Russian Civil
Code, which allows the tax authorities, in certain well-defined circumstances, to disregard
the form of a particular transaction and to impose taxes based on the actual facts
(ie., based on the actual transaction which occurred, or the fact that no such transaction
occurred). Such cases can obviously offer no support to the Respondent’s re-attribution
theory. Neither at the time nor in these arbitrations has the Respondent sought to rely on
Article 170. Moreover, as the Accounts Chamber emphasized in its 2002 report on
Sibneft, apart from the transfer pricing rules under Articles 20 and 40 of the Russian Tax
Code (which were also not used against Yukos), Article 170 is the only basis under
Russian law to challenge relations or transactions between companies as being “shams” or

“fictitious”, refuting the Respondent’s claim that such theories as the “bad faith taxpayer”
concept conferred authority to re-attribute revenues between companies.'”

Claimants also challenge the relevance of the Energomashbank ruling:

If that case has any relevance to these arbitrations, it is as a wholesale condemnation of the

tax authorities’ formalistic approach to VAT, divorced from the actual facts, as in breach

of Yukos’ constitutional rights. The constitutional issue in the case was the taxpayer's

right to a fair opportunity to defend itself against tax claims by the State before a court, and

the Constitutional Court held that respect for this right meant that courts could not limit

their inquiry to purely “formal conditions”, but rather must examine the actual facts.'*!
Putting aside, for the moment, the remedy of re-attribution in the case of a finding of abuse,
which the Tribunal considers in Chapter VIII.B of the present Award (in connection with the
tax assessments themselves), the question here is whether the decisions cited by Respondent

support the existence of a judicial anti-abuse doctrine in tax cases.

Respondent insists that they do. Focusing specifically on the Sibservice and Yekaterinburg

demonstrating that Russian courts have recognized and applied anti-abuse rules in the tax area
to combat aggressive tax planning and abuse since at least 1996.'° In its Rejoinder,

Respondent dismisses Claimants’ comments on these cases as “misleading”:

Claimants misleadingly suggest that Respondent’s reliance on the 1996 Sibservice decision
and the 1997 Yekateringburg City Telephone Network decision “involve[s] the application
of principles enshrined in Article 170 of the Russian Civil Code” ..... But nowhere in
these decisions do the courts rely on, or even mention, Article 170 of the Civil Code.
Rather, in both the Supreme Arbitrazh Court upheld the tax authorities’ assessments by
looking at the substance of the challenged transaction, as opposed to its form.'**

Based on its review of these cases, the Tribunal observes that Respondent’s submission appears

to be well-founded. Article 170 of the Russian Civil Code provides as follows:

Article 170. Invalidity of Mock and Sham Transactions

1. A mock transaction, i.e., a transaction made only for appearances without an intent
to create the legal consequences corresponding to it, is void.

2. Asham transaction, i.e., a transaction that is made for the purpose of hiding another

However, there is no mention of Article 170 of the Russian Civil Code in either of the
Sibservice or Yekaterinburg decisions in the record of this arbitration.’ Based on this record,
it appears to the Tribunal that the Supreme Arbitrazh Court is relying in these cases on a
general doctrine of substance over form. The Tribunal further observes that such a doctrine
seems entirely consistent with the principles enshrined in Article 170 of the Russian Civil
Code. It also seems consistent, in a general way, with the anti-abuse principle that Mr. Konnov
says existed in the Russian Constitution, even though the Tribunal notes that no authority was

brought to its attention in which this principle was expressly extended into the area of tax.'**

On the other hand, the Tribunal is of the view that Respondent cannot draw much support from
the Energomashbank decision. It appears to the Tribunal that, while the Constitutional Court
referred to the importance of investigating the “actual facts” of a case as opposed to confirming
“the establishment of formal conditions of the application of the law only,” it did so in the
context of highlighting substance over form as an important feature of “the right to judicial
defense” of a taxpayer against the claims of the tax authorities, not as a basis for tax authorities
to challenge taxpayers. At the same time, the Tribunal notes that the Energomashbank decision
is not inconsistent with the application of the substance over form doctrine by the tax

authorities against a taxpayer’s scheme.

Another doctrine invoked by Respondent is known as the “bad-faith taxpayer” doctrine, or
sometimes as the “good faith taxpayer” doctrine. This doctrine, submits Respondent, is rooted
in the jurisprudence of the Russian Constitutional Court, notably Constitutional Court Ruling
No. 24-P of 12 October 1998'*° and Constitutional Court Ruling 138-O of 25 July 2001.'*7 In

his First Expert Report, Mr. Konnov summarizes the significance of these cases as follows:

c. In 1998, the Russian Constitutional Court introduced the concept of good/bad faith
taxpayers. In 2001, the Russian Constitutional Court held that bad faith taxpayers

The Tribunal observes that there appear to be at least six other decisions in the procedural history of these two cases,
and that these are not in the record.

The authorities cited by Mr. Konnov demonstrate only that the constitutional anti-abuse principle (i.e., persons should
not violate other persons’ rights and freedoms in exercising their own rights and freedoms) has been extended to the
area of labour law. See generally First Konnov Report 45, n.64, 66 (authorities cited therein).

would not be entitled to the same level of protection as good faith taxpayers.
Mr. Savseris in his book “Bad Faith Category In Tax Law” states:

“The criterion of bad faith taxpayer was chosen by the Constitutional
Court of the Russian Federation in order to distinguish legitimate tax
planning and illegal tax evasion.

Since the adoption of the Ruling of the Constitutional Court of the

Russian Federation No. 138-0 the criterion of bad faith has become an

independent criterion for settlement of disputes on many categories of
ts8

case

 

Claimants do not deny the existence of the “bad-faith taxpayer” doctrine,’ but argue that its
origins and subsequent application by the Russian courts suggest that it has only a “limited
role” in Russian law.'® The Tribunal considers it important to set out Claimants’ position, as

articulated at paragraphs 218 to 224 of their Reply, in full:

218, The phrase “good faith taxpayer” first appeared in the inoperative part of a decision
of the Constitutional Court arising out of the 1998 financial crisis, during which
many tax payments never reached the Treasury because the banks through which
such payments were sent had become insolvent. When the funds did not arrive, the
tax authorities simply confiscated the unreceived payments directly from the
taxpayers’ accounts. The Court concluded that the constitutional obligation to pay
taxes is fulfilled and the tax is deemed “paid” at the moment when the funds are
debited from the taxpayer’s account and that it would be improper to hold the
taxpayer liable for the banks’ failure to retransmit those funds to the State. In these
circumstances, the Court held that a second collection of these “paid” taxes would
be inconsistent with constitutionally protected property rights.

Exh. R-307; S.V. Savseris, Bad Faith Category in Tax Law, Statut, 2007, pp. 42, 46, Exh. R-2218. He also refers to
another illustration offered by Professor D.V Vinnitsky, The Principle of Good Faith and Abuse of Right in Taxation,
Pravo i Ekonomika, No. 1, January 2003, Exh, R-2219 (“the tax legislation does not directly use the notion “good
i ssing activity of tax relations party. However, this is not to say that tax law is
st, for this branch of law “good faith” is a fundamental principle to be used in the
resolution of disputes and execution of certain tax law provisions.”). Mr. Konnovy notes that bad faith is one of the
anti-abuse doctrines which was applied either on a stand-alone b: or together with other doctrines in the Yukos
case. In many cases, the term “bad faith” was used along with other anti-abuse terms, such as “proportionality”,
“unjustified tax benefit” or “abuse of rights.” According to Mr. Konnovy, during the period in question there were a
number of non-Yukos s where the tax authorities applied the concept of bad faith to disallow tax benefits, and the
courts upheld their Specifically, between 2001 and 2005 the concept of bad faith was applied in the following
number of court cases: (i) 2001—262 court cases; (ii) 2002—644 court cases; (iii) 2003—1.189 court cases:

219, In 2001, the Tax Ministry asked the Constitutional Court to clarify its earlier
decision, in particular, whether the rule (that a taxpayer’s constitutional duty to pay
taxes ceases when the funds are debited from its account) applied even if the
taxpayer deliberately contrived, in bad faith, to use an insolvent bank in order to
evade taxes. In the resulting decision, the Russian Constitutional Court held that
“the conclusions which are contained in the motivational and operative parts of the
[1998] Ruling do not extend to the dishonest taxpayers, and recovery by
enforcement in the manner established by law from dishonest taxpayers of taxes not
coming into the budget does not violate the constitutional guarantees of the right of
private ownership”. This decision introduced the concept of “bad faith taxpayer”
into Russian law.

220. Since introducing this novel doctrine, the Constitutional Court has been called on to
address its proper scope on a few occasions, and has consistently imposed limits.

   

221. In its decision of October 16, 2003, for example, the Court for the first time
recognized the possibility of the doctrine’s application in a context other than tax
payments through failed banks, in particular, in relation to claims for VAT refunds
for exports. However, the Court emphasized the limited nature of this extension,
recalling that, under Article 57 of the Russian Constitution and Article 3(7) of the
Tax Code, “law authorities may not construe the concept of ‘good faith
tax_payer’_as imposing on the tax_payer_additional_obli which are_not
provided for in the legislation”. The Russian Constitutional Court reiterated this
limiting principle in a 2005 decision and specifically criticized the Moscow
Arbitrazh Court’s sweeping attempt to “universalize” the concept so as to
circumvent express statutory provisions in the context of the Yukos case.

222. In sum, in its limited endorsement of a “bad faith taxpayer” doctrine, the Russian
Constitutional Court has at all times clearly indicated that any such doctrine was
inate to, and led by, relevant Constitutional and statutory provisi

 

 

223. The primacy and supremacy of Constitutional and statutory provisions over the “bad
faith taxpayer” concept have since been reaffirmed by the Presidium of the Highest
Arbitrazh Court in a decision wholly rejecting, in circumstances unrelated to the
Yukos affair but involving tax claims against another oil company, the approach of
the Moscow Arbitrazh Courts in the Yukos cases and emphasizing that “courts
should assess of tax authorities with respect to underpayment of taxes
with consideration of specific statutory provisions rather than such subjective
concepts as ‘bad-faith taxpayer”.

224. Accordingly, there was nothing in the “bad faith taxpayer” concept introduced by
the Russian Constitutional Court that could have permitted the tax authorities to re-
attribute revenues between taxpayers or otherwise disregard directly applicable
statutory provisions and impose additional, unwritten obligations beyond those
contained in the legislation."

 

305. In its Rejoinder, Respondent dismisses Claimants’ suggestion that the Constitutional Court has
limited the application of the doctrine since it arose in 1998, notably through its decisions since

2003:

661. Contrary to Claimants’ allegations, the Constitutional Court in 2003 was not “called
on to address” the “scope” of the bad-faith taxpayer doctrine, much less to “limit[]”
it, but rather to adjudicate a complaint that had been raised in connection with the

Reply {218-24 (footnotes omitted; emphasis in original).

-115-

tax authorities’ denial of a refund of input VAT based on the taxpayer's bad-faith
conduct. Thus, the Constitutional Court confirmed its earlier holdings, including its
1998 ruling, reiterating that “in the sphere of fiscal relations, there shall be a
presumption of good faith” in favor of taxpayers, which the authorities bear the
burden of rebutting. The Court also noted that the authorities “may not construe the
concept of ‘good-faith taxpayer’ as imposing on the taxpayer additional obligations
which are not provided for in the legislation.”

662. Claimants’ self-serving reliance on this quotation -- which they extract from its all-
important context -- is misplaced. It is clear from this ruling that the Court did not
at all intend to “limit” the scope of the bad-faith taxpayer doctrine, but rather to
clarify that a taxpayer’s good or bad faith must be determined on a case-by-case
basis, upon “review of all the circumstances of the particular case.” ‘That is exactly
what the tax authorities and courts did with respect to Yukos. Specifically, the
Constitutional Court explained that:

“[tJhe determination of the complainant’s good or bad faith in the
performance of its tax obligations and realisation of its rights to the
reimbursement of amounts of tax deductions is connected with the

i and review of the factual ci of the particular
case and falls under the jurisdiction of the arbitrazh courts.”

663. That the Court did not intend to limit the scope of the doctrine as formulated in its
earlier jurisprudence is also apparent from its actual holding:

“Based on the above [...] the Constitutional Court of the Russian
Federation ruled: 1. The complaint of OOO Export-Service shall not
be accepted for examination because the subject matter of the
application to the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation was
earlier clarified in a decision which is still in force.”

664, In sum, neither in this nor in other later rulings has the “Constitutional Court [...]
suggested that the bad faith-taxpayer doctrine could not be used to combat abusive
arrangements such as those used by YUKOS.”!

306. The Tribunal has read and reviewed the many Constitutional Court decisions that form the

backbone of the “bad faith taxpayer” doctrine in Russian law as well as papers of various
Russian legal scholars. The Tribunal has formed the view that, during the period relevant for

It is the Tribunal’s opinion that Claimants cannot persuasively maintain that the “bad faith

taxpayer” doctrine is subordinated to, and controlled by, not just the Russian Constitution

167

(which must be the case), but also statutory provisions. It seems evident that if the tax

authorities establish dishonesty (bad faith) by the taxpayer in a particular case, based on
specific factual circumstances, then the taxpayer may lose certain statutory benefits such as tax
deductions or exemptions provided in the legislation. However, even a bad-faith taxpayer

cannot be deprived of its constitutional rights or of statutory rights that guarantee the

taxpayer’s constitutional rights.'*

alludes generally to “thousands of bad faith cases adjudicated in the relevant period,”!”
Respondent places particular emphasis on the Sibirskaya case'”' and Resolution No. 53 of the

Supreme Arbitrazh Court.'”

Claimants, for their part, emphasize a Resolution of the Federal
Arbitrazh Court for the North-Western District of 5 June 2002 (the “Pribrezhnoye” case).'73
The Tribunal considers this case in the next chapter of its Award since it relates more directly
to the application of any anti-abuse doctrine to circumstances similar to those that are at issue in

the present case, rather than to the existence of any anti-abuse doctrine.

309. Mr. Konnov describes the Sibirskaya case as follows:

i. In May 2002, OOO Sibirskaya Transportnaya Kompaniya (“Sibirskaya”), which
was later found to be a Domestic Offshore Company, lost a cassation appeal before
the Federal Arbitrazh Court for the North-Caucasian District. Like YUKOS two
years later, Sibirskaya argued that it had complied with the letter of the Kalmykian
law. The tax authorities and courts, however, concluded that Sibirskaya was a bad
faith taxpayer and that the tax benefits granted to it were manifestly disproportionate
(0.4%) to the amount of investment made by Sibirskaya:

“Such investments neither have any effect on the economy nor cover
any of the losses of the budget relating to the granting of tax
incentives to taxpayers. On the contrary, those investments result in
unjust enrichment (saving) of funds at the expense of budgetary funds.
Therefore, being aware of a clear disproportion between the amount
of investment and the amount of the tax incentives applied, the
claimant has abused its right, i.e., the claimant acted in bad faith.”!

The Tribunal notes that no further appeals appear to have been made in this case. During his
cross-examination, Mr. Konnov observed that the amount at stake in Sibirskaya (around

USD 200,000) “was peanuts.”'”*

Respondent argues that the Sibirskaya case is one of “numerous cases [in which] the courts
ruled against taxpayers on the basis that disproportion between the tax benefits granted to the
taxpayer and amounts of investment into the relevant low-tax region economy is an indication
of an abuse of rights and evidence of the bad faith of the taxpayer.”'”° Although Sibirskaya
involved a Yukos-related entity, Sibirskaya Transportnaya Kompaniya, Respondent argues that
“the tax authorities did not realize the connection of that company with Yukos at the time.”!””

Claimants challenge the assertion that the authorities did not know that the company was
related to Yukos.'”* Furthermore, and of direct relevance to the topic at issue here, Claimants
contest the validity of the “purported ‘proportionality’ requirement” imposed by the court on

the basis of the “bad faith taxpayer” doctrine:

Not only was the Court’s reliance on the “bad faith taxpayer” doctrine improper . . . the
purported “proportionality” requirement it sought to introduce was wholly arbitrary and
contravened other statutory and Constitutional provisions as well as basic principles of the
tule of law.'”

The Tribunal cannot accept Respondent’s submission that the Sibirskaya case is an authority
for the proposition that proportionality, standing alone, is a sufficient criterion for a finding of
abuse. The decision does appear indeed to stand alone and, as far as the Tribunal can tell, was
not followed subsequently. Moreover, contrary to Mr. Konnov’s opinion, it was not Sibirskaya
Transportnaya Kompaniya that “lost” an appeal at the cassation level of the arbitrazh court,
suggesting that the tax authorities had been successful at all other levels. In fact, the company
had actually prevailed in the earlier decisions on this issue.'*” Those judgments are not in the

record. In addition, Claimants underline that, during his expert testimony in the Quasar de

Mr. Konnov disclaimed reliance on the “proportionality” requirement.'*!

As is apparent from the many cases reviewed above, Russian courts did consider and rule on
tax-related cases before they were seized of the dispute involving the tax assessments against

Yukos, including in the “anti-abuse” area.

Respondent also raised a 2006 ruling of the Supreme Arbitrazh Court known as Resolution
No. 53. In principle cases decided afier the Yukos tax assessments and decisions should not be
relevant for ascertaining the state of the law at the time of those assessments and decisions.
However, in view of Respondent’s argument that Resolution No. 53 represents the end point of
the evolution of the anti-abuse doctrine in the Russian courts, the decision is of interest to the
Tribunal in ascertaining the state of the law on the anti-abuse doctrines not only after, but also

before and during the Yukos tax assessments.

In Resolution No. 53, the Supreme Arbitrazh Court set out to ensure greater uniformity in its
evaluation of the “justifiability” of tax benefits received by the taxpayer by setting out
straightforward interpretations of certain doctrines. As a starting point, it reaffirmed that the
good faith of the taxpayer was presumed and that the tax authority had the burden to prove the
facts upon which it relies in making its determinations. It noted that benefits may be
considered unjustified when transactions are recorded without reflecting their true nature or are
concluded without a business purpose or connection to economic activity. In such situations,
the court would determine the rights and obligations of the taxpayer on the basis of the actual
economic substance of a transaction. The Supreme Arbitrazh Court noted, however, that no
adverse inference should be drawn from the fact that there was another, less beneficial way to
conduct a transaction. It laid out four scenarios which may “point to” an unjustified tax benefit,
and nine factors which, taken by themselves, may not constitute grounds to find a tax benefit
unjustified. However, taken in concert with other factors, they may be considered as evidence
of an improperly obtained benefit. Finally, it stated that a court should “establish the existence
of economic or other reasons (business purpose) in the taxpayer's actions subject to evaluation
of circumstances evidencing its intent to obtain an economic effect as a result of actual business
or economic activity.” It held that the tax benefit itself could not be considered an independent
business purpose: “Therefore, if the court determines that the main purpose pursued by the

taxpayer was obtaining of income exclusively or predominantly out of the tax benefit and there

was no intention to carry out actual economic activity, the tax benefit may be disallowed.”!*”

Many articles on Resolution No. 53 have been written by Russian tax scholars and

importance of Resolution No. 53, although they reach different conclusions regarding the
novelty of its content. One article by Mr. Y.M. Lermontov concludes that Resolution No. 53
was an innovation in Russian tax law: “[t]he concept of the ‘bad-faith’ of the taxpayer has been
eliminated by Resolution No. 53,” and instead other doctrines have been “incorporated into the
regulatory framework.”' Mr. Lermontov notes that in the past, “the judicial practice
concerning the treatment of taxpayers as those of good faith and of bad faith in these matters
used to be inconsistent,” and that as a result of Resolution No. 53, more specific doctrines such

as “business purpose”, “substance over form” and “economic justifiability” were substituted in

its place.'*°

The other commentary was written by Messrs. A.V. Bryzgalin and V.V. Goryunov. '*° For
these authors, the doctrine affirmed in Resolution No. 53 represents less of a break with the
bad-faith taxpayer doctrine that existed at the time of the Yukos assessments. Instead, they see
Resolution No. 53 as linking the “business purpose” doctrine to the “bad-faith taxpayer”
doctrine. The authors note that bad faith of the taxpayer was “considered for the first time . . .
[in] N 138-0 regarding dubious schemes for payment of taxes through ‘problem banks.’”” The
authors further note that since the doctrine had not been “directly provided for in the law,” it
created “uncertainty” leading to “considerable complications for . . . taxpayers, but also for the
judges.” Prior to Resolution No. 53, the authors write, “no criteria in this area existed at all,
and the question of bad faith was completely dominated by judicial discretion.” For the
authors, Resolution No. 53 represents a “positive step” in which the Supreme Arbitrazh Court
“attempted to establish specific indications of bad faith of taxpayers, characteristic features and

approximate examples of permissible and impermissible conduct.” The authors suggest that the

change from “bad faith” to “unjustified tax benefit” is more a matter of terminology than
doctrine. The authors write that “despite the substitution of terms...the concept of an
unjustified tax benefit is illustrated in Resolution N[o]. 53 by what used to be called bad-faith

behavior of taxpayers.”

The link between these doctrines was made, as early as 2002, in a commentary on

Constitutional Court Ruling 138-O that was published in 2002 by Mr. Sergey Pepeliaev, who

187

would later be retained by Yukos in the Russian tax litigation. In his commentary,

Mr. Pepeliaev wrote as follows:

In this Ruling the court considers the issue of limitations on tax planning, which implies
the recognition of the right of each taxpayer to use the means, ways and methods permitted
by law to reduce such taxpayer’s tax liabilities to the maximum extent possible. However,
sometimes tax planning goes beyond the permitted limits and results in tax evasion. The
boundaries between the tax planning and tax evasion [are] determined by reference [to] the
taxpayer’s purposes. If tax savings are only ancillary to the relevant economic result, then
the relevant tax consequences shall be determined by reference to the form of the relevant
transaction. However, where the taxpayer’s actions were aimed solely to reduce the
amount of its tax payments rather than to achieve an economic result, this would
demonstrate that the relevant transaction was inconsistent with law because the motive
underlying such transaction was to avoid tax.

The expression “good faith of the parties to a transaction” is closely related to the
expression “good faith taxpayer” which was used by the Constitutional Court of the
Russian Federation twice in the opinion section of Resolution No. 24-P dated 12 October
1998. In other words, in the context of the Resolution, the expression “good faith of the
parties to a transaction” was used in its public legal meaning. A person’s actions aimed
solely at tax evasion may not be regarded as actions made in good faith.

 

If the parties to a transaction act reasonably, ice., if they aim to achieve the actual business
result and also choose such line of action which leads to minimal tax loss, then the parties’
tax liabilities should be determined formally.

 

If it appears that parties act both unreasonably and not in good faith then this constitutes a
ground for reassessment of the parties’ tax liabilities for which various mechanisms can be
used. Upon a claim brought by the tax authorities the actual relations between the parties
may be assessed by court[s]. The substance of such court proceedings would be an
examination of whether the actions of the relevant parties were aimed at achievement of
business (economic) results or whether the idea of tax saving was the prevailing
idea...

The Tribunal also observes that the ECtHR, in its separate judgments relating to the claims against the Ru:

The Tribunal concludes that, in respect of the period relevant for the Yukos tax assessments and
decisions, while the “bad faith taxpayer” doctrine had not yet gelled in the way that it did in
2006, in Resolution No. 53, it had already been recognized and applied in some Russian court
decisions. This conclusion, while based primarily on the Tribunal’s review of the cases,!*? is
also supported by the cross-examination of Mr. Konnov at the Hearing, as explained in the

following paragraphs.

In his cross-examination of Mr. Konnov, Professor Gaillard focused on the sanction that the
Russian Federation imposed on Yukos in the present case, rather than on the existence of any

anti-abuse doctrine per se.

Mr. Friedman emphasized the limited scope of Claimants’ cross-examination of Mr. Konnov

during his re-direct examination of the witness:

MR FRIEDMAN: Just to make sure I am clear, Mr Konnov, you understood the questions
yesterday to be about the remedy that’s applied based on the anti-abuse doctrine, as
opposed to the substance of the anti-abuse doctrine?

A. I thought that Professor Gaillard limited his question—and the Tribunal did the

same thing—very specifically to the attribution; which I explained—and I think the

record said that—that I don’t view that as a separate instrument. But I was

nevertheless asked the question about court cases with respect to attribution.'”
As Claimants had stipulated to the existence of the bad-faith taxpayer doctrine (while
contesting the scope and manner of its application), they instead implied in their argument that
any such doctrine was irrelevant, since formal compliance with the legislation governing the
low-tax benefits in the respective regions, including fulfilment of the terms of any applicable
investment agreements, was sufficient to claim the tax benefits.!"!
Accordingly, in his cross-examination of Mr. Konnov, Professor Gaillard stressed the
compliance of Yukos’ tax scheme with the existing legislative framework. In his answer,
Mr. Konnov, while acknowledging that the formal requirements of the law may have been met,

reiterated the relevance of the anti-abuse doctrine:

 
  

Federation brought by Yukos and Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev, respectively, considered the relevant domes
(i.e., Russian) law and practice, including the Russian courts’ case-law on substance over form and related doctrines.

compliance with the strict letter of the law, can also be seen in the following extract of his

gives the regions the power to negotiate their taxes downwards in exchange for

No, | am not saying that at all. | am not saying that at all. I am saying that what was
done in this case, it was an abuse of law. So the Law was applied by Yukos in such
an abusive manner so that, in violation of the constitutional principles which I’ve
summarized in my report, Yukos did not pay taxes duty in Moscow. It used this
whole fraudulent sham arrangement, with the use of the Mordovian companies, to
evade taxes in Moscow.'*

What do you call the proportionality principle? Is it the proportionality between the

black letter of the Law of Mordovia; yes or no?

No. As I said—

Having completed its review of what it considers to be the central evidence in the record in
respect of the legal framework applicable to the Yukos tax optimization scheme under Russian
law, the Tribunal now turns to the complex factual matrix involving Yukos’ trading entities in

the low-tax regions.

4, The History of the Yukos Trading Entities before 2003

In the present proceedings, the Parties vigorously debated the significance of the history of the
Yukos trading companies, including various tax audits that took place before 2003. The
pertinent activities of Yukos’ trading companies took place in the regions of Mordovia and
Kalmykia, as well as in the ZATOs of Lesnoy and Trekhgorny. The Tribunal will now

summarize these activities and the results of the many tax audits which were issued.

(a) Mordovia

Mordovia is a region within the Russian Federation. Sometimes referred to as a “domestic
offshore territory”, in the late 1990s it was granted some autonomy as regards taxation, which
made it a more attractive destination for investment and business operations.'* This was part
of a broader plan by the Russian Government in the 1990s to foster economic development in
areas designated as “economically underdeveloped”.'** As noted earlier, the special exemption

plan for domestic offshore territories was largely repealed as of 1 January 2004.'°°

On 9 March 1999, the Law of the Republic of Mordovia No. 9-Z (“Law 9-Z””) was enacted.'””
Law 9-Z was the framework which allowed Mordovia to offer tax benefits to corporate entities
operating in the region. Article 4.4 of the law states that “[t]he Government of the Republic of
Mordovia shall determine the order and terms and conditions of granting the tax benefit under
this Law, as well as the order of keeping reports and records to be able to obtain the tax benefits

listed in this Law."

Mr. Vladimir Dubov, a member of the Yukos management board'®? and later a member of the
State Duma for the Upper Volga region (which includes Mordovia), was the primary point of
contact between Yukos and the regional and federal taxation authorities in Mordovia. He

appeared as a witness on behalf of Claimants.
In his witness statement, Mr. Dubov stated the following:

e On 20 December 1999, he attended meetings in Mordovia to explain Yukos’ plan to
operate through trading companies in Mordovia. He met with Mr. Nicolai Merkushkin, the
head of the Republic of Mordovia; Mordovian Prime Minister Vladimir Volkov,; and
Mordovian Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Ruzhenkov, who was also Head of the
Administration of the Government of Mordovia. Mr. Dubov swears that “[a]ll terms and
conditions associated with the use of trading companies in the Republic of Mordovia were
discussed and agreed at the meeting, including that Yukos’ trading companies would pay
[80 million rubles] per month to the Republic.” He stated that the Mordovian authorities
“fully approved” of the plan.”

e In late December 1999, he met with the Tax Minister of the Russian Federation,
Mr. Alexander Pochinok, and Mr. Alexander Smirnov, one of Mr. Pochinok’s deputy
ministers, to discuss Yukos’ plan to use trading companies in the Republic of Mordovia.
Mr. Smirnov was very interested and called the head of the Special Inspectorate for Major
Taxpayers, Mr. Aslambek Pasckachev, and the head of the Oil Department within the
special inspectorate, Ms. Lydia Smirnova, into the in the meeting, to ask them to analyze
the beneficial taxation plan.””"

e After that meeting, he spoke with Mr. Gusev, First Deputy Minister in charge of the VAT
Department, to discuss Yukos’ plan. He thought this important as “it was obvious to me
that any trading companies established in Mordovia would be claiming significant VAT

refunds on the export of oil and oil products.”"’ He also spoke with Ms. Olga Serdiuk,

then Deputy Head of the Indirect Taxes Department and one of the three deputy First
Ministers, Mr. Kirill Ugolnikov.?

e Around late December 1999 or January 2000, he met with each of the deputy First
Ministers at the Tax Ministry and at the Menatep office on Kolpachniy Lane to outline the
plan for the Mordovian companies. Following these meetings, Mr. Smirnov called the
Head of the Regional Department of the Tax Ministry in Mordovia, Mr. Aleksey
Averiasov, in Mr. Dubov’s presence, to inform him that such discussions had taken place
and that Yukos had been “given the green light at the Ministry level for the use of trading
companies in the region.””™

e He met with the then First Deputy Minister of Finance (later Minister of Finance and
Deputy Prime Minister), Mr. Alexei Kudrin at the Ministry of Finance in January 2000.
They discussed establishing Yukos trading companies in Mordovia so that Yukos could
take advantage of tax benefits available in the region and that Yukos’ trading companies
would be able to contribute to the regional economy through fixed monthly payments.
Mr. Dubov recalls that “Alexei Kudrin consented to Yukos’ proposal, with the proviso that
Yukos’ overall tax burden should essentially remain the same.””°*

When he was cross-examined, Mr. Dubov repeated his statement that he told Mr. Kudrin that

Yukos was planning to work in Mordovia through trading companies, as well as “which taxes it

will pay in each level of national budget, which preferences would the budgets provide for

Yukos, what benefits Yukos would reap from these preferences and what amounts would be

paid in[to] the federal budget, and if there were any issues, how they were going to be

resolved.””"°

Mr. Dubov concludes in his witness statement that, after these meetings, “[i]t follows that all
the relevant authorities, both federal and regional, including the Minister of Taxation, his first
Deputies, and the First Deputy Minister of Finance were aware of, cooperated with and

approved of Yukos’ plan to operate through the trading companies in the Republic of Mordovia

Ibid.
Ibid. 25.

Ibid. 26. It is common ground between Claimants and Respondent (hereinafter “the Parties”) that the point of Yukos’
tax arrangements was to lower its tax burden, not to keep it at the level it would have been at without resort to them.

07 In Mr. Dubov’s view, this was favorable

to take advantage of the favorable tax climate.
both for Mordovia and the Russian Federation, as any improvement in the financial situation of
Mordovia would decrease the burden it placed on the federal budget. According to Mr. Dubov,
“t]he Russian Federation was clearly interested in decreasing the significant disparities in
well-being between the regions [of the Federation].””"*

The record reveals that, as the trading companies began operations, VAT refunds to the
companies were very significant. In fact, VAT refunds to the trading companies often
exceeded the total amount of VAT collected in Mordovia from all the other companies
operating on its territory. The regional section of the Federal Treasury therefore had to transfer
the necessary funds to the Tax Ministry’s regional VAT Department. This decision to transfer
funds, according to Mr. Dubov, had to be taken at the federal level, including obtaining the
approval of the Ministry of Finance.

During his cross-examination, Mr. Dubov explained that “[w]hen, as a result of the operations
of the trading companies, the VAT refunds increased many times over, many fold, by many
hundreds of per cent, the Tax Ministry department asked the question why[;] the Tax Ministry,
the Tax and Charges Ministry for Mordovia replied that we have Yukos trading entities
incorporated here, these have to do with the Yukos exports; that is why the VAT refunds are so
high.” He also stated that “[tJhis is exactly why, before the scheme became operational, I
had cleared [it] with the head of the department and the First Deputy Minister who was in
charge of this department.””!°

In addition, in his witness statement, Mr. Dubov affirms that the funds paid into the Mordovian
budget were used to fund various projects, such as Internet House, an internet-training center,
and the rebuilding of the Saransk Airport. In 2001, according to Mr. Dubov, several
dignitaries, including President Vladimir Putin, repeatedly visited the area (using the airport)
and discussed the trading companies’ work in the region. Mr. Dubov states: “During such
visits, President Putin was told by Nicolai Merkushkin, the Head of the Republic of Mordovia,
and other representatives of the Republic of Mordovia, about the social, cultural and industrial

projects that had been developed in the region in the previous year through the support and

~!1 Mr. Dubov also recalls that President Putin had been told about

cooperation of Yukos.
several other improvement projects funded by Yukos’ support, such as the building of plants
for machinery construction, construction materials and the production of optic fiber; the
realization of a number of environmental projects such as the recycling of rotten wood and raw
materials; the rehabilitation of the meat industry; reconstruction of the Saransk Theatre and
Saransk Art Museum; the construction of two asphalt plants just outside of Saransk; and the
reconstruction of the Saransk-Moscow highway.””

Mr. Dubov concludes that “[i]t follows that the federal authorities, who had to authorize the
VAT refund, as well as any subsequent transfer of funds, were fully aware of Yukos’ trading
structure, including the activities of the production and trading companies and the transactions
between them,””!?

The Tribunal notes that during his cross-examination, Mr. Dubov could not confirm that the
VAT forms submitted by the trading companies to the Tax Ministry contained the full
particulars as to how the tax optimization scheme was being implemented by Yukos. This was
because, as he said, he was not familiar with the specifics of the VAT submissions although he
knew that they would be submitted to the Leninsky district of Saransk (Mordovia) and they
were likely to be very large.!* It seems unlikely to the Tribunal that such information would
have been disclosed in the VAT forms, as the tax benefits of the low-tax regions did not extend

to VAT.

During his cross-examination, Mr. Dubov affirmed that he only discussed with Mr. Kudrin “the
general scheme”, not the formalities or the details of the activities of the trading companies.”'*
The Tribunal further notes that in his witness statement, Mr. Dubov asserts that “[p]rior to the
attacks on Yukos, which began in the Summer of 2003, the Russian authorities never
challenged the legality of this structure or the materiality of the facts underlying this

39216

structure. During his cross-examination before the Tribunal, he stated that he had no

knowledge of the use of the ZATO Lesnoy companies,”"’ and in light of such testimony,

Mr. Dubov’s evidence must be understood as being limited to Yukos’ activities in Mordovia.

In the following subsections, the Tribunal will review the detailed information that was

presented to it regarding the trading companies incorporated in Mordovia.

i. Alta-Trade (Mercury XXIII)

Alta-Trade was incorporated on 17 December 1999 as Mercury XXIII pursuant to the
resolution of a meeting of the company’s founders, Polikant ZAO and A-Trust OOO, each with
a 50 percent [RUR 5,000] stake in the share capital. In March 2001, Nefteinvest OOO became
a shareholder, taking a 2 percent (RUR 200) share in the company’s share capital.”'* In August
2001, Yukos-Import OOO acquired the shares of Polikant ZAO and A-Trust OOO, and became
the owner of 98 percent of the share capital (RUR 9,800).”””

On 27 June 2001, Alta-Trade concluded an investment agreement with Mordovia, which was
2,220

supplemented in March 200:
The record reveals two decisions by the Saransk Tax Inspectorate in 2001 where Alta-Trade
was denied the right to offset the VAT in respect of some of its activities. The decision of
15 June 2001 notes that Alta-Trade is “an enterprise producing oil products and selling its
output domestically and [abroad],” that it purchases crude oil from Yu-Mordovia, and that sales
are made through OAO NK Yukos and ZAO Trading House Angarsk-Nefto as commission

221

agents. The decision of 29 October 2001 refers to transactions with, for example, Siberian

Transportation Company and noted that the commission agent was Yukos Export Trade.”?
Thus, this information pertinent to the activities of Alta-Trade in Mordovia and linking Alta-

Trade to the Yukos “family” was known to the authorities as early as 2001.

In April 2002, Alta-Trade’s first ever field tax audit was conducted. It covered the year
2000.3 The report from that audit noted the tax-benefit structure under Law 9-Z and the
investment agreement between Mordovia and Alta-Trade. It noted that Alta-Trade was
engaged in “crude oil refining [through intermediaries], sale of crude oil and oil products in the
domestic market, as well as for export.”*4 It noted the tax benefit structure under Law 9-2,

26

and that the company had no capital assets on its balance sheet.~” It also noted that
Alta-Trade’s accounting and tax services were completed by Yukos Invest.” The Audit

Report found no violation of any tax laws.”**

As will be seen in the next chapter, tax reassessments would eventually be made against Yukos

for Alta-Trade for the years 2000,””° 2001,7*° 2002” and 2003,”” totaling RUR 7,143,036,557
(approximately. USD 238,101,219).

In September 2003, a Field Tax Audit Report for 2001 to 2002 was issued. It found no
violation of Article 40 of the Russian Tax Code; but did find some underpayments, resulting in
an order to Fargoil to pay additional road tax and income tax in the amount of
RUR 590,847,939 (USD 19.7 Million). Notably, the report concluded that “Fargoil lawfully

used exemptions applicable to all taxes under review.””?”

Tax reassessments would eventually be made against Yukos for Fargoil for the years 2001,"
2002™' and 2003,” totaling RUR 130,243,731,762 (approximately USD 4,341,457,725).%

Macro-Trade

Macro-Trade was incorporated on 14 May 2001. The sole founder and chief accountant of
Macro-Trade was Ms. Gulnura Karimovna Zhukova, who was also the founder and director of
Mega-Alliance OOO. Pursuant to a resolution of 24 May 2002 and amendments to the charter
of Macro-Trade on 22 October 2002, her shareholding was transferred, in equal 50 percent
shares, to Conbrook Limited (LLC) and Silverdale Trading Limited (LLC), both registered in
Cyprus. On 16 December 2002, Macro-Trade’s share capital was increased to RUR 7,700,000
and “was formed by a deposit of cash assets into the entity’s current account from an account at

Trust and Investment Bank JSCB on 20 December 2001 [sic]

Ms. Zhukova submitted a statement in court proceedings in Moscow in May of 2005 in which
she alleged that she knew nothing about becoming a director of Macro-Trade and that her name
was on the books of the company as a result of a fraud. She stated that in December 1998 or
early 1999, her purse with her passport had been stolen. She stated that she did not report the
theft because the passport was returned at the end of January 1999.“° Mr. Konnoy, in his first

246

expert report, referred to Ms. Zukhova’s statement.” When Professor Gaillard cross-examined

Mr. Konnov on this “story”, Professor Gaillard pointed out that Macro-Trade was incorporated
in May 2001, more than two years afier Ms. Zukhova’s passport was returned to her.”

An investment agreement was concluded between Macro-Trade and Mordovia, exempting the
company from paying property tax and corporation profit tax payable to the republican and

local budgets of the Republic of Mordovia.***

Tax reassessments would eventually be made against Yukos for Macro-Trade for the years

2003” and 2004,” totaling RUR 841,582,281 (approximately USD 28,052,743).°*!

iv. Mars XXII (Energotrade)

Mars XXII was incorporated on 17 December 1999. The founders were OOO Akra, registered
in the Kaluga Region, and Renmet ZAO, registered in Moscow, both with equal shares of
50 percent (RUR 5,000).2°? Renmet ZAO is also a founder of Elbrus OOO, which had a
20 percent holding in the share capital of Yu-Mordovia and Yukos-M. Ms. Tatiana Subbotina
was one of the directors of Mars XXII. In a witness statement of 18 May 2004, Ms. Subbotina
affirmed that, while she was formally in charge of the company, she only signed documents and
did not know whether any investment agreements were concluded by Mars-XXII.”** According
to its charter, the main activities of Mars XXII were the production and wholesale sale of oil
products in the internal market and for export.

The Tribunal notes that an investment agreement was concluded between Mars XXII and

Mordovia on 27 June 2001, and supplemented on 26 March 2002.7

On 27 December 2001, a decision was issued by the Saransk Tax Inspectorate on “a Partial
Refusal to Refund (Offset) VAT Amounts.” The decision notes that the commission agent for
the export transactions is OAO NK Yukos. The decision refers to oil prices as well as a chain
of VAT transactions, and notes that the suppliers of the crude oil at issue were Ratmir and
Norteks.”* Again, this information linking Mars XXII to the Yukos “family” was known to the

authorities as early as 2001.

In October 2003, a Field Tax Audit Report was issued for 2000 to 2002. It specifically stated
that the “terms and conditions for applying the special taxation procedure have been complied
with.”?57 Some minor violations were found, however, with respect to personal income and
profit taxes. The decision specifically noted that Mars XXII used Yukos FBTs for all of their

accounting services.”**

i. Siberian Transportation Company (Sibirskaya)

Sibirskaya was founded by Step ZAO, registered in Kaluzhskaya Region, and Polinep ZAO,
registered in Moscow, both holding 50 percent shares.’ The Tribunal notes that Polinep ZAO
was also a founder of Sonata OOO and Elbrus OOO, which were founders of Yu-Mordovia
000 and Yukos-M ZAO.*”

Sibirskaya received tax benefits under the Law of the Republic of Kalmykia No. 12-I-Z of
12 March 1999 referred to above and the Resolution of the Elista Municipal Assembly No. 7 of
25 January 2001.°°°

In September 2001, a resolution was issued by the Inspectorate of the Ministry of Taxes and
Levies of Russia (Elista). It found that the Siberian Transportation Company was ineligible for
the tax benefits applied to it in the autonomous region.*™ On the same day, a tax payment
demand was issued to recoup the costs of the inappropriately applied benefits, in the amount of

RUR 6,918,617 (approximately USD 230,000).*°*

In December 2001, the Arbitrazh Court of the Republic of Kalmykia ruled that the tax
incentives were, in fact, lawfully applied to the Siberian Transportation Company and the
resolution and payment demand were declared invalid. In addition, the court specifically stated
that it had not found any evidence that the company had acted in bad faith or that it abused its
rights."°° The Inspectorate of the Ministry of Taxes and Levies of Russia (Elista) appealed the
December 2001 judgment. The court of appeal upheld the decision of the lower court,

affirming that the resolution and the payment demand were invalid. The court of appeal found

no bad faith on the part of the Siberian Transportation Company.*”

The Inspectorate of the Ministry of Taxes and Levies of Russia (Elista) appealed this decision
to the Federal Arbitrazh Court of the North-Caucasian District. The Federal Arbitrazh Court
reversed the decisions of the lower courts and ruled that the Siberian Transportation Company
was not eligible for the benefits and that the company had acted in bad faith. The resolution
and the payment demand therefore became valid once again and were reinstated.’ The
Federal Arbitrazh Court held that the tax benefits granted to the company were disproportionate
to the investment it had made in Kalmykia. It found that the amount invested was 0.4 percent
of the amount of tax benefits. There is no further information in the record as to any further
steps in those proceedings, and, in particular, no evidence that the company appealed the

decision of the Federal Arbitrazh Court to the Supreme Arbitrazh Court.

Tax reassessments would eventually be made against Yukos for the Siberian Transportation

Company for the year 2000,*” totaling RUR 240,437,174 (approximately USD 8,014,572).

(c) Lesnoy and Trekhgorny

Lesnoy and Trekhgorny are ZATOs. As noted earlier, ZATOs or “Closed Adminstrative
Territorial Units” are restricted-access territories “established in the former Soviet Union from
the late 1940s as defense and nuclear power plant cities, which included communities with
sensitive military, industrial or scientific facilities, such as arms plants or nuclear research
sites.”*'' Due to the fact that their local economies were particularly dependent on increasingly
obsolete military or nuclear functions, the ZATOs faced economic collapse at the end of the
Cold War. To address the problem, in 1992, the Russian State Duma “enacted a federal law to
define the special tax regime of the ZATOs and the financing of these territories by the federal
government, and guaranteed the ZATOs’ residents certain social and health benefits.”*'? The
number of restricted access jurisdictions in Russia is unknown, and it was not until the late

1990s that the territories were even named or mapped.*? In 1996, about half of the ZATOs
were declassified of ZATO status.

i. Lesnoy

At the end of 1997, four trading companies were established by Yukos in Lesnoy: Business-
Oil, Forest-Oil, Mitra, and Vald-Oil. In early 1998, the trading companies entered into
agreements with the Lesnoy Town Administration to make investments in the region that would

entitle them to certain tax benefits.*'* These were renewed in 2000.°°

In January 1999, the trading companies based in Lesnoy and the Lesnoy Administration agreed
to allow the companies to use interest-bearing promissory notes of OAO Yukos Oil Company
in order to pay their taxes.*"° This agreement was later formalized in a decision by the head of

ZATO Lesnoy.*!”

In 1999, the Lesnoy Administration also entered into several other agreements with the trading
companies. Resolution 189 of the Duma of Lesnoy referred to joint investment activity within
the framework of a partnership “between the Lesnoy administration and YUKOS OC OJSC.”*'*
The investments included construction and reconstruction of gas stations based on joint-activity

agreements entered into “for a total of [RUR] 2,730 Million.*"? In late 1999, three of the four

trading companies were subjected to “desk audits”, which “confirmed the validity

application of additional tax incentives granted.””°

On 3 December 1999, the Minister of Taxes of the Russian Federation instructed the
Interregional State Tax Inspectorate for Operational Control over Problem Taxpayers to audit
the legality of tax incentives granted in the Lesnoy ZATO to Mitra, Business Oil and Forest
oi?!

There is in the record an undated Internal Tax Ministry “Memorandum on the results of the
audit” initiated on 3 December 1999.’ The Tribunal recalls that this memorandum has been

the subject of extensive representations by the Parties.

The Tribunal notes that, in essence, the memorandum concludes that while each entity has the
formal right to receive the “additional tax incentives under Law of the Russian Federation
No. 67-FZ of 2 April 19993 based on an examination of the entity’s operations, it was
established during the interrogation of a witness, in respect of each entity, that “the employees
residing on the ZATO territory are not involved in the work related to the main activity of the

company.”***

Respond bmitted that this dum and the i igation which preceded it “put
Yukos on notice” of the tax authorities’ investigations into the legality of the use of the ZATOs.
On the other hand, Claimants replied that the memorandum was a document internal to the tax

ministry.”° Claimants also aver that contemporaneous field tax audits conducted in March and

May 2000 found no violations of any tax law by Business Oil, Forest Oil or Mitra in relation to
326

the application of these taxation arrangements.
At approximately the same time, Yukos undertook a series of corporate restructurings which
resulted in the merger of the audited Lesnoy companies (i.e., Business-Oil, Forest-Oil, Mitra,
and Vald-Oil) into another, new company, OOO Perspektiva Optimum, that was registered in
the Aginsky Buryatsky Autonomous Okrug (“ABAO”) in the Chita Region, which is located
thousands of miles from the ZATO of Lesnoy.

Concurrently, a similar restructuring was carried out with respect to a number of other trading
entities established in the ZATO of Trekhgorny (i.e., OOO Alebra, OOO Flander, OOO Grace,
OOO Kolrein, OOO Kverkus, OOO Muskron, and OOO Norteks), which Yukos merged into
still another newly created company also registered in ABAO by the name of OOO Trading
Company Alkhanay.

As a result of these restructurings, on 21 May 2001, the Lesnoy and the Trekhgorny trading
entities, as well as the subsequently merged successor entities (OOO Perspektiva Optimum and
OOO Trading Company Alkhanay), were liquidated. The new entity that emerged was named
OOO Investproekt and was registered in the Kirov region. In August 2001, Investproekt moved

across Russia to the Chita Region.

These restructurings and movements by Yukos—referred to collectively by Respondent as the
“Lesnoy Shuffle’—are seen differently by the Parties. According to Claimants, they were
merely a simplification of the corporate group of “hundreds of companies.” *°” Claimants also

noted that the restructurings occurred before any Tax Ministry decisions were rendered against

it.’ Respondent, on the other hand, submitted that they were indicative of a pattern of

behavior on the part of Yukos that shows an intent to frustrate the taxation authorities.*” While

the Tribunal need not determine why these restructurings took place at this time, it has formed

the view that the simplification claim is a simplification. No persuasive argument has been
advanced by Claimants to explain why the series of mergers occurred at this precise time.” At
the same time, the Tribunal notes that the tax authorities were then slowly moving away from
the taxation autonomy previously given to the ZATOs and that, on | January 2002, the right of

the ZATOs to grant any tax incentives was removed from the law completely.*™!

In late June and early July 2001, the Tax Ministry circulated internally several memoranda (or

examined the lawfulness of the benefits granted between | January 1999 and March 2001.
Internal Tax Ministry Statement No. 6, which examined the benefits granted to Business-Oil,
found that the tax incentives were actually not in accordance with the law on ZATOs and not
approved by the Ministry of Finance. It also found a violation due to payment of taxes with
promissory notes. It assessed taxes of approximately RUR 2.8 Billion (USD 98 Million) for the
whole period. The memorandum also notes specifically that the Lesnoy entities were

enterprises of OAO NK Yukos.**?

Internal Tax Ministry Statement No.7, which examined the benefits granted to Forest-Oil,
found that the company’s employees residing in Lesnoy were not engaged in trading, and also

found violations due to payment of taxes with Yukos promissory notes and assessed

approximately RUR 671 Million (USD 22 Million) in taxes that were not paid in cash.***

Benefits granted to Mitra were examined in Internal Tax Ministry Statement No. 8, which

found that Lesnoy unlawfully granted tax incentives, found a violation due to payment of taxes

by Yukos promissory notes and assessed approximately RUR 783 Million (USD 26 Million) in

taxes paid with promissory notes.**°

Internal Tax Ministry Statement No. 9 examined benefits granted to Vald-Oil. It found that
Lesnoy could not grant incentives for 2000 and assessed that RUR 986 Million
(USD 33 Million) was owed. It also found fault on the basis of a substance over form analysis,
and a violation due to payment of taxes by Yukos promissory notes in the amount of

RUR 1.8 Billion (USD 60 Million)*°

In September 2001, a criminal investigation was initiated to look into whether the managers of

In October 2001, a decision was taken to conduct a repeat field tax audit of Investproekt,*** and

Later in November 2001, Ms. Irina Golub, Yukos’ Chief Accountant, received an e-mail from

In December 2001, Ms. Golub drafted a letter to be used as a template by one or more of the
directors of the Lesnoy trading companies regarding the investigation into the use of
promissory notes and sent it to Mr.D.V. Gololobov, Deputy Head of Yukos’ Legal

342

Department. Later, Mr. V.G. Aleksanyan, the Head of the Legal Department, wrote to

Ms. Golub regarding her draft letter, asking that in correspondence with the authorities, no

reference be made to the tax incentives granted by Lesnoy.*

Respondent argued during the
Hearing that this demonstrates knowledge of and intent to conceal wrongdoing by Yukos.**
Claimants answered that the document merely notes that the tax incentives were not at issue in
the investigation (only the use of promissory notes to pay taxes was), and that Mr. Aleksanyan

was simply asking Ms. Golub not to bring up an issue that was not being investigated."

In December 2001, the tax authorities decided “to conduct additional control activities in
99346

respect of Investproekt.
In January 2002, the criminal investigation of the directors of the Lesnoy trading companies
was terminated because the investigation had not determined that a crime was committed. The
report stated that “there is no constitution of a crime,” and “tax payments in non-monetary form
cannot indicate the intention of tax evasion.”"’ The document also concludes that the head of
the Lesnoy Administration, Mr. A.I. Ivannikov, believed at the time that tax payments by
promissory notes were legal and that his actions and the actions of Lesnoy officials relating to
granting of tax benefits should be considered as exceeding their authority and as negligent.“

However, a few days later, that decision was reversed.*”” The reason then given was that no
“legal assessment was conducted during the preliminary investigation as to whether the
selection by the [trading companies] of such a knowingly illegal method of tax payment

involving intentional overpayment of charged taxes and subsequent refund of surplus sums to

the accounts of these same companies in real monetary form could be considered as ‘another
99350

method’ of tax avoidance . . .
Ultimately though, the Tribunal notes that the investigation was suspended because, in the
words of the resolution, “all possible investigative actions have been taken in the absence of an
accused.”**! The resolution noted that “this type of tax crime should be assessed as a tax
evasion scheme by making advance payments for taxes of future periods,” and that “[h]ere a
mandatory condition is the fact that the advance payment is made in non-monetary form.”
The resolution concluded that it was not possible to determine who among the directors of the
trading companies or who in the Municipal Department of the City of Lesnoy actually
committed a crime? Claimants stressed, in their Closing Statement, that no further action was
taken.*™' In this connection, the Tribunal recalls that Mr. Khodorkovsky and Mr. Lebedev were
ultimately convicted, inter alia, for tax evasion, including in relation to the trading companies’

use of promissory notes to pay taxes in Lesnoy.**°

In the period between the reversal and the suspension of the criminal case regarding the
promissory notes, the report on additional control measures against Investproekt for 1999 was
released.** It considered that Business-Oil was not entitled to tax benefits in 1999, as it “was

carrying out its business within ZATO Lesnoy as a matter of form only.”**”

The report also
considered that the other Lesnoy companies were not entitled to tax benefits in 1999. The

report estimated their tax liabilities on the basis of Business-Oil as a “similar taxpayer”.***

The report assessed the value of the tax benefits that it concluded had been improperly granted

at approximately RUR 5.3 Billion (USD 177 Million). However, no assessment or decision

was issued on the basis of this report to recoup the funds, which could have occurred any time
up until 31 December 2002, before becoming time barred.**” No assessment was issued during

the subsequent ten-month period against Investproekt.

The Tribunal notes that, in March 2002, Mr. Dmitry Maruev, Yukos’ Deputy Financial
Manager, e-mailed M. U. Barbarovich and V. M. Zhuravlev and asked that they clean their
e-mail folders and servers of references to a number of companies, some of which (“Alebra,
Greis, Business Oil, Vald Oil, Kverkys [sic], Kolrein, Mitra, Muskorn, Nortex”) had been
merged into Investproekt.*”

Around this time, a demand requesting enforcement of a tax debt against Investproekt in the
amount of RUR 25 Million (USD 833,000) was sent by the Ministry of Taxes and Levies for
Chernyshevsk District to Bailiffs in the Chita region. It was returned by the bailiffs who
considered this matter to be outside of their jurisdiction since, when the debt was incurred, the
company was located in Kirov. The bailiffs also noted that Investproekt’s executive

S. A. Verketin still resided in Kirov, and supplied his address.**'

In April 2002, a decision was issued not to hold Investproekt liable for tax offenses in 2000.
Rather, it proposed to collect taxes but not fines as offenses were “discovered after the
completion of their reorganization.” It assessed the taxes owed at RUR 11.985 Billion
(approximately USD 400 Million).** Two months later, a decision was issued by the Federal
Arbitrazh Court for the North West District in the Pribrezhnoye case, which found (on nearly
identical facts to those relied upon in the decision against Investproekt) that the tax authorities
had acted in breach of the Russian Tax Code.* Claimants argued that this decision explains, at

least in part, the reason why the tax assessment against Investproekt was never collected. In

prevailed in 2002, the assessment would not have survived court review.>°>

However, in August 2003, a decision was issued relating to the activities of the Investproekt
companies in the year 2000. The taxes owing were assessed at RUR 11.985 Billion
(USD 400 Million); and this time, the authorities decided that they would also fine
Investproekt, adding an additional approximate amount of RUR 2.4 Billion (USD 84
Million). It is not clear to the Tribunal as to whether this assessment was ever paid.” The
Tribunal notes that the basis for reversing the April 2002 decision (i.e., the decision not to hold

the company liable) was not explained in the August 2003 decision.

Business-Oil

Business-Oil was registered by order of the head of the Administration of the Town of Lesnoy,
on 30 December 1997, with RUR 10,000 capital. It was founded by Special Project OOO
(holding 5 percent of the shares) and Rasin OOO (holding 95 percent of the shares).

In February 1998, Business-Oil and the Lesnoy Town Administration concluded an investment
agreement, which granted incentives in relation to 17 different types of taxes and required
payment of 5 percent of tax benefits granted by the administration to an off-budgetary fund.
This agreement was later supplemented in 2000, and provided additional incentives in relation

to eight additional taxes.”

In November 1999, a desk audit was conducted. The audit report confirmed the validity of the
application of the additional tax incentives granted.*” The following month, a resolution of the

tax authorities was issued which lead to an audit regarding compliance with the tax laws of the

incentives were granted between | January 1998 and 1 October 1999.’ In March 2000, a
Field Tax Audit Report was issued regarding the lawfulness of the additional incentives for

legislation was established.”*””

As set out above, however, an internal memorandum of the Tax Ministry questioned the
entitlement of Business-Oil to the tax benefits, on the basis that it might not have been fulfilling
the requirements of the legislation in substance (as opposed to form). This, and other concerns
about the entity’s conduct, led to a criminal investigation inquiring into whether the managers
of the Lesnoy entities were involved in tax evasion. The investigation was ultimately
suspended, but charges relating to the Lesnoy entities figured in the case by the Russian

prosecutor against Messrs. Lebedev and Khodorkovsky in 2003.

In December 1999, a resolution of the tax authorities was issued leading to a field tax audit for
1 January 1998 to 1 October 1999, in order “to inspect its compliance with the tax laws of the
Russian Federation and check the terms and conditions under which additional tax incentives

As set out above, however, an internal memorandum of the Tax Ministry questioned the
entitlement of Forest Oil to the tax benefits because it might not have been fulfilling the

Mitra**”

In February 1998, Mitra and the Lesnoy Town Administration concluded an investment

381

agreement,” which was supplemented in a further agreement in January of 2000, in which the

administration provided additional incentives in respect of 8 types of taxes.***

In October 1999, a Field Tax Audit Report was issued,*** followed by a desk audit report***

which confirmed the validity of the additional tax incentives granted. In December 1999, a
resolution of the tax authorities was issued which led to the conduct of a field tax audit for
1 January 1998 to 1 October 1999 “to inspect its compliance with the tax laws of the Russian
Federation and check the terms and conditions under which additional tax incentives were
granted.”*** In May 2000, the Field Tax Audit Report was released. It found no violation in
relation to tax incentives and only a profit tax error in the amount of RUR 3,122,000

(USD 105,000).**°

As set out above, however, an internal memorandum of the Tax Ministry questioned the
entitlement of Mitra to the tax benefits, on the basis that it might not have been fulfilling the
requirements of the legislation in substance (as opposed to form). This, and other concerns
about the entity’s conduct, led to a criminal investigation inquiring into whether the managers
of the Lesnoy entities were involved in tax evasion. The investigation was ultimately
suspended, but, as noted earlier, charges relating to the Lesnoy entities figured in the case by

the Russian prosecutor against Messrs. Lebedev and Khodorkovsky in 2003.

On 5 March 2001, Mitra was merged into Perspektiva Optimum, which later merged into

Investproekt.

ii, Trekhgorny

Far less information is available to the Tribunal regarding the activities of the trading

Torgovaya Kompaniya Alkhanay or Alkhanai Trading on 16 March 2001, a company

registered in Aginskoye, in the Aginsko-Buryatsky region.” Two months later, in May 2001,

incentives to investors in the region. Pursuant to Article 6(1)(d) of the law, preferential tax
rates were offered to participants in investment projects on the territory of the Evenkiysky
Autonomous District. Pursuant to Article 5(1) of the Law, commercial and noncommercial
entities were deemed participants of investment projects which are created in the territory of the
region, regardless of the origin of their capital, and can include those with foreign legal entities
as shareholders, so long as they were participants in programs for the social and economic

development of the region and investment projects.

In May 2001, Mr. Boris Zolotarev, the former head of Yukos R&M, became governor of
Evenkia. After his election, he spoke about the positive effects he hoped Yukos investment

could have on the region.**

v. Yukos Vostok Trade

Yukos Vostok Trade was registered by Decision 36 of the Interdistrict Inspectorate of the
Russian Ministry of Taxes and Levies No.3 for the Evenki Autonomous District,
9 February 2004.“ It was founded by OAO Yukos Oil Company with 70 percent of the
shareholding and Yukos-Import with 30 percent of the shareholding.“**

While there is no reference to any tax agreements on the record, the Tribunal notes that Field
Tax Audit Report No. 52/996 refers to Yukos Vostok Trade making use of the beneficial tax
system in Law 108 of 24 September 1998, with a preferential income tax rate reduced to 13
percent and a preferential property tax rate of 0 percent.“

Tax reassessments would later be made against Yukos for Yukos Vostok Trade for 2004,"

totaling RUR 8,660,507,192 (USD 311,337,530).**

5. Tribunal’s Observations

Having set out the evidence regarding Yukos’ tax optimization scheme, the Tribunal now
returns to the question posed at the beginning of this chapter: does the record which it has
reviewed at length demonstrate that Yukos was merely taking advantage of the legislation in
place in the low-tax regions of the Russian Federation to minimize its taxes, or was there an

element of abuse in its activities that made them illegal under Russian law?

The Tribunal first reiterates that the evidence reveals—indeed, the Parties are agreed—that the
Russian Federation had enacted (in the late 1990s and early 2000s) a legislative structure to
encourage investment in some of its low-tax regions, and that Yukos (as did many other

Russian companies, including other oil companies) sought to take advantage of that legislative

structure. As a result, Yukos set up trading companies in various low-tax regions and, where

required, entered into investment agreements with the local authorities.

There is evidence in the record that Mr. Dubov informed the authorities, at least in respect of
the Yukos trading companies in Mordovia, that Yukos was using the legislative arrangements
in place to minimize its taxes, and that none of his interlocutors, including the then First Deputy
of Finance, Alexei Kudrin, formulated any objection. Finally, the Tribunal recalls that few of
the audits of the trading companies conducted in the regions prior to 2003 ever resulted in any
tax assessments, and, when they did, the transgressions were generally minor and the

assessments insignificant.

In this connection, the Tribunal notes that Respondent chose not to call any fact witnesses to
challenge Claimants’ fact witnesses. That is unfortunate. The Tribunal would have been
assisted, for example, by the evidence of Mr. Kudrin who, after his meeting with Mr. Dubov,
became Minister of Finance and Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation. Instead,
Respondent has relied solely on the documentary record to build its case that Yukos’ activities
in the low-tax regions were abusive and illegal. As Claimants pointed out during the Hearing,
and as the Tribunal found out for itself, the documentary record compiled and presented by

Respondent to the Tribunal, while significant, is selective and unfortunately incomplete.

The record does reveal, however, that Yukos had some concerns about the legality of its trading
operations in certain low-tax regions, notably in Lesnoy and Trekhgorny. As recorded in the
previous section of the present chapter, there were audit reports and memoranda that attest to an
investigation of whether the practices of some of the Yukos trading companies in those regions
were abusing the system, since those companies were acting in conformity with the relevant

legislation in form only and not in substance.

The Tribunal recalls that, in November 2001, after an extensive corporate restructuring had
taken place (as a result of which the trading entities in Lesnoy and Trekhgorny ceased to exist,
and were merged into entities created in other regions), Ms. Irina Golub, the Chief Accountant
of Yukos, received a document by e-mail from Mr. Kartashov, a general director of Yukos.
That document referred specifically to the ongoing investigations in Lesnoy and Trekhgorny by
the Federal Tax Police Service of Sverdlovsk as part of a criminal case “in connection with tax
evasion” by the Yukos entities and to the fact that office personnel in Lesnoy and Trekhgorny
(including, in the case of the Lesnoy entities, the General Directors) had been interrogated by

tax authorities.

During the Hearing and in its Post-Hearing Brief, Respondent referred many times to the
Kartashov e-mail, as well as the following evidence, which, it argued, demonstrated that Yukos
knew that its scheme was unlawful and “took pains to conceal its scheme from the

authorities”:

e Firstly, the 22 April 2002 memorandum from Mr. Maly, in which he expressed his concern
that if Yukos’ affiliation with the trading entities were included in the SEC filing, that
information “may be used by the Russian tax authorities to challenge [Yukos’] approach to
certain transactions and, consequently, will result in substantial tax claims against the
[c]ompany”;**”

e Secondly, the e-mail from Mr. Maruev (from the Treasury Department) to employees in

2002 to “clean your folders” of references to the Lesnoy trading companies;"””

e Thirdly, the internal memorandum from Yukos’ General Counsel Mr. Aleksanyan advising
Ms. Golub not to draw the attention of the authorities to the use of tax incentives in the

ZATO Lesnoy, since “an investigation into the legality of the use of the incentives...

entails substantial risks, including under criminal law”;"”'

e Fourthly, Mr. Khodorkovsky’s refusal in early 2003 to sign Yukos’ registration statement

(for a confidential SEC filing) over concerns for his “personal risks”;*”” and

e  Fifthly, a “blackline” version of Yukos’ draft filing for the SEC sent on 23 July 2002 by
Natalia Kuznetsova of PwC to Stephen Wilson (at that time Yukos’ international tax
director), proposing that the following be deleted from an earlier draft: “We use tax
optimization mechanisms that may be challenged by the tax authorities” and “If a number
of regional tax incentives we have used to reduce our tax burden are successfully
challenged by the Russian tax authorities, we will face significant losses associated with
the additionally assessed amount of tax and related interest and penalties.”*”*

In their reply to the evidence regarding concern over potential tax liabilities, Claimants submit

that the Russian tax authorities “were notorious for displaying arbitrary and unpredictable

interpretations of law generating significant and unquantifiable risks for taxpayers[,] risks that

Yukos and other Russian oil companies . . . disclosed in their financial statements.’ They

conclude that references by Yukos’ management to such risks “[could not] reasonably be

construed as evidencing ‘knowledge’ or ‘belief? that Yukos’ tax structure was unlawful.”

Claimants also argue that Respondent’s reliance on Mr. Maly’s e-mail was “much ado about

nothing,” and that “it is clear that any risks were neither a problem, nor an obstacle, to Yukos

pursuing the NYSE listing because Yukos continued to draft its Form F-1 into mid-March

2003, nearly a year after this memo.””° Claimants also note that, in respect of the blackline

filing that it “in fact states—in a sentence the Respondent omits to quote—that Yukos’

In fact, the record before the Tribunal reveals that Lukoil, Rosneft, Sibneft and TNK, in their
financial statements in those years, all referred to the significant risks associated with the

varying interpretation by the Russian tax authorities of the Russian tax legislation.“

Although the Yukos entities in Lesnoy and Trekhgorny were only a small part of Yukos’ tax

a 9
optimization scheme,”

it is clear to the Tribunal that these entities were being investigated as
of late 1999 by the tax authorities in these regions, and were suspected of being “shams”. It is
the view of the Tribunal that the legal basis for this scrutiny was the jurisprudential “good faith
taxpayer” doctrine (“substance over form” or “anti-abuse” doctrine) and that, within the senior
management of Yukos, there were a number of persons who were aware that Yukos was

vulnerable in respect of certain facets of its tax optimization scheme.

As for the existence of the “good faith taxpayer” doctrine in Russia at that time, the Tribunal
has reviewed the evidence of Mr. Konnov, the only expert on Russian tax law to give evidence

in these proceedings, who appeared on behalf of Respondent. Although Claimants elected not

“The taxation systems in the Rus Federation and other emerging markets where Group companies operate are
relatively new and are characterized by numerous taxes and changing legislation, which may be applied retroactively
and is sometimes unclear, contradictory, and subject to interpretation. Often, differing interpretations exist among
different tax authorities within the same ju ions and among taxing authorities in different jurisdictions. Taxes are
subject to review and investigation by a number of authorities, which are enabled by law to impose severe fines,
penalties and interest charges. Such factors may create taxation risks in the Russian Federation and other countries
where Group companies operate substantially more significant than those in other countries where taxation regimes
have been subject to development and clarification over long periods.

significant.”

The tax assessments levied against Yukos in connection with the trading entities in Lesnoy and Trekhgorny, which
related only to the 2000 tax year (since the entities ceased to exist in early 2001), represented approximately 19

percent of the total tax assessment against Yukos for 2000, and represented under 3 percent of the total of all tax
a sments against Yukos (for the years 2000-2003). See Yukos Tax Reassessment Breakdown, Exh. C-1752.

to present their own expert on Russian tax law,*” in their written submissions, they referred to
and criticized various Russian court decisions, which they contended did not support
Respondent’s interpretation. As noted earlier in the present chapter, the Tribunal has

considered Claimant’s submissions.

The Tribunal has also considered the lengthy cross-examination of Mr. Konnov by Professor
Gaillard. The Tribunal recalls again that Professor Gaillard did not challenge Mr. Konnov on
the existence of the anti-abuse doctrine but rather sought Respondent’s expert’s
acknowledgement that the Yukos tax optimization scheme complied with the existing
legislative framework in Russia as well as in the regions. The Tribunal notes in this context
that Claimants stipulate to the existence of the “bad-faith taxpayer” doctrine in their Reply, but
argue that “neither it nor any other alleged judicial doctrine had previously been applied as in
the Yukos case.”*"!

As a matter of background fact, the record before the Tribunal is clear that, at the time of the
issuance on 29 December 2003 of the Field Tax Audit Report, the “bad faith taxpayer”
doctrine, although it had not yet gelled in the way that it did in 2006 in the ruling of the
Supreme Arbitrazh Court in Resolution No. 53, had been recognized and applied in some

Russian court decisions.

The Tribunal recalls that the eminent Russian tax lawyer, Mr. Sergey Pepeliaev, who later
represented Yukos in the Russian tax litigation, wrote in 2002 that the doctrine existed and that

“[i]f it appears that parties act both unreasonably and not in good faith then this constitutes a

ground for reassessment of the parties’ tax liabilities . . . °°?

Beyond this conclusion, which the Tribunal considers a matter of fact, the Tribunal does not

need to determine, as a matter of Russian law, whether any of the activities of the Yukos

The Tribunal notes that in the RosInvestCo arbitration, the claimant presented a Russian tax law expert,
Professor Maggs. The Russian Federation relied on Mr. Konnov. The Ros/nvestCo tribunal stated that it found
Professor Maggs’ evidence more persuasive, but it also acknowledged that Professor Maggs did not dispute the
existence of the “bad faith taxpayer” doctrine. See RosInvestCo §§ 432, 495, Exh. C-1049. Similarly, in the Quasar
arbitration, claimants presented a Russian tax law expert, Professor Stephan, as well as an expert on the Russian Civil
Code, Professor Mozolin, who opined, inter alia, on the distinction between good and bad faith taxpayers. See
Quasar, § 66, 77-78, Exh. R-3383. As in this arbitration, and the Ros/nvestCo arbitration, the Russian Federation’s
expert on Russian law was Mr. Konnov. As in the RosInvestCo , the debate turned primarily on the application to
Yukos of the anti-abuse doctrine, as opposed to the existence of the anti-abuse doctrine.

trading companies in the low tax regions in 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003 in the implementation
of its tax optimization scheme were in violation of this doctrine. As noted in the introduction to
the present chapter, it is not the role of the Tribunal in the present arbitrations to sit as a court

applying Russian law.

However, the Tribunal does note that that, in using the available tax benefit legislation in the
Russian Federation, the Yukos group principally availed itself of facilities under the laws of
Mordovia, the region which represents approximately 78 percent of the 2000 to 2004 tax
reassessments against Yukos. Another significant portion of the reassessments relates to
Evenkia, while the tax reassessments in ZATO Lesnoy and Trekhgorny represent less than
three percent of the total. It is important for the Tribunal to stress that the bad faith doctrine

was never used against Yukos prior to December 2003.

The Tribunal will now turn in the next chapter of its Award to the central question which it
posed at the beginning of the present chapter: were the December 2003 and the subsequent tax
assessments a legitimate exercise by the Russian Federation of its prerogative to enforce its tax
laws or were they, as Claimants argued, a mere fabrication of massive tax claims against Yukos
serving as instruments which allowed the premeditated expropriation of all Yukos assets by the

State after the arrest of Mr. Lebedev and Mr. Khodorkovsky.

As will be seen, a crucial consideration for the Tribunal concerns the remedy or sanction of
“re-attribution”, and the application of the “re-attribution” remedy to revenues (for purposes of
profit tax) without a corresponding “re-attribution” of tax filings for purposes of VAT. Also
considered in the next chapter is the legitimacy of associated fines levied against Yukos,

notably the “willful offender” and “repeat offender” fines.

THE TAX ASSESSMENTS STARTING IN DECEMBER 2003

1. Introduction

This chapter addresses the next crucial facet in the factual narrative of the present arbitration,
namely the tax assessments that were issued against Yukos starting in December 2003, the
manner in which those assessments were made and how they were reasoned and, eventually,

enforced.

This important review will lead the Tribunal to consider a central question in this case: were

the December 2003 and subsequent tax assessments covering the tax years 2000 to 2004 a

- 170-

505.

507.

508.

legitimate exercise by the Russian Federation of its prerogative to enforce its tax laws
(Respondent’s position), or were they a fabrication of massive tax claims against Yukos that
allowed the premeditated expropriation of all Yukos assets by the State (Claimants’ position)?
Or does the record rather suggest that the truth lies somewhere between these two positions:
could certain taxes in the assessments have legitimately been imposed while others plainly not,
and were the consequential sanctions inexorably exacted by Russian authorities so excessively
disproportionate as to require an answer to the question described as key by counsel for the
claimant in Quasar, Mr. O.T. Johnson: “Why would Russia have treated Yukos as it did if its
purpose was to collect taxes?”*"*

A closely related question concerns the arrests in 2003 of Messrs. Lebedev and Khodorkovsky:
were the arrests and the subsequent convictions of Messrs. Lebedev and Khodorkovsky (not
once but twice), again, a legitimate exercise by the Russian Federation of its prerogative to
enforce its criminal and tax laws (Respondent’s position), or were they a politically motivated
attack on these individuals as part of a broader campaign to confiscate the rich assets of Yukos

(Claimants’ position)?

The issues raised by the arrests and convictions of Messrs. Lebedev and Khodorkovsky, and of
other individuals connected with Yukos, and the alleged harassment of Yukos management,
are addressed in detail in Chapter VIII.C of the present Award. The Tribunal considers it
opportune however at this time to comment upon some of the circumstances surrounding those

arrests.

Claimants have argued that the arrests, and the broader campaign of harassment and
intimidation of the leading officers and employees of Yukos, were prompted by
President Putin’s desire to retaliate against Mr. Khodorkovsky and Yukos for
Mr. Khodorkovsky’s political and social activism, which Claimants allege became intolerable

for President Putin subsequent to a public encounter between the two men in February 2003.

Specifically, on 19 February 2003, in the context of a meeting between President Putin and a
group of the country’s most powerful businessmen, a televised confrontation between President

504

Putin and Mr. Khodorkovsky took place. According to the testimony of Dr. Illarionov,

S11.

President Putin had scheduled regular meetings between himself and the business leaders,
facilitated by the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs headed by Mr. Arkady
Volsky.*

At the meeting, which would, according to Dr. Illarionov, turn out to be the last of its kind,
Mr. Khodorkovsky made a presentation on the topic of corruption. In his presentation, he
asserted that corruption in Russia was rife, and that it was “rotting the Russian Government and
the Presidential Administration.”*"° While no names were mentioned, relates Dr. Illarionov,
President Putin did discuss the acquisition of Severnaya Neft by Rosneft, for which Rosneft had
paid approximately USD 622 million. Dr. Illarionov states that “[i]t was widely considered that
the price was exaggerated and that a portion of the price represented kickbacks to State
officials.”°”

Dr. Illarionov concludes as follows in relation to his understanding of the significance of that

encounter:

During his closing remarks, the President turned to Mr. Khodorkovsky and stated that

everyone knew how various assets, including Yukos, were acquired. The President

indicated to Khodorkovsky that “I return the ball in your corner”.... Later, it became

clear that this was a signal to the governing elites that Mr. Khodorkovsky could be attacked

and he was no longer tolerated.**
At the same time, the Tribunal’s findings in the previous chapter of the present Award suggest
that well before the clash between President Putin and Mr. Khodorkovsky at the February 2003
meeting, the tax authorities of the Russian Federation were challenging the tax benefits claimed
by some Yukos entities (in ZATO Lesnoy) and, in a few cases, had made findings adverse to

those trading companies. Moreover, the Tribunal recalls, as it did in the previous chapter, that
Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev were ultimately convicted, inter alia, for tax evasion in
relation to Yukos’ activities in Lesnoy, in which (the record revealed) the authorities had
suspended an investigation into the commission of tax crimes because, according to the
conclusions in the relevant Resolution, it was not then possible to determine who actually

committed the crimes.

Respondent emphasized Yukos’ earlier tax problems in its comments on the February 2003
meeting. Respondent noted in its Closing Statement that President Putin publicly told
Mr. Khodorkovsky that the political protection or assistance he was allegedly receiving from
the Kremlin until that meeting would be removed, and he added that “we’ve talked about taxes
before.”*”

Based on the extensive record that was presented to it, the Tribunal is unable to accept the
proposition that the February 2003 confrontation created Yukos’ tax problems and that, but for
such a confrontation, Yukos would have avoided any and all tax reassessments against it.
While this meeting may well have marked a turning point in the relations between Yukos and
the Russian Federation, as the Tribunal observed in the previous chapter, within the senior
management of Yukos, and well before February 2003, there were individuals who were aware
that the company’s tax optimization mechanisms were vulnerable and could be challenged by
the tax authorities. Some of the evidence presented to the Tribunal also revealed that there was
at least some awareness within Yukos that a successful challenge to the Yukos tax structure

+9510

would result in “substantial tax claims” or “significant losses associated with the additional

995 ‘ ew
"and possibly even criminal

assessed amount of tax and related interest and penalties’
liability. At the same time, the Tribunal notes that the tax assessments and decisions against
Yukos led not just to “substantial tax claims” or to “significant losses” but to its bankruptcy and
destruction, and to the transfer of the principal assets of Yukos to Rosneft, a company

controlled by the Russian Federation.

The crucial question addressed in this chapter of the Award, therefore, is whether Claimants
have discharged their burden of proof and established that the tax assessments, and the
enforcement processes of the Russian Federation which followed, are more consistent with the
conclusion that they evidence a punitive campaign against Yukos and its principal beneficial
owners with sanctions entirely disproportionate to the company’s tax liability, rather than with

the conclusion that they were a legitimate exercise of tax enforcement.

In the Tribunal’s view, it may well be that, while Yukos was vulnerable on some aspects of its
tax optimization scheme, and possibly even would have faced “substantial tax claims” that
might have resulted in “significant losses,” principally because of the sham-like nature of some
elements of its operations in at least some of the low-tax regions, the State apparatus decided to
take advantage of that vulnerability by launching a full assault on Yukos and its beneficial
owners in order to bankrupt Yukos and appropriate its assets while, at the same time, removing

Mr. Khodorkovsky from the political arena.

Dr. Illarionov asserts in his witness statement that “various possible justifications for
Mr. Khodorkovsky’s arrest and Yukos’ dismantlement were tested in the Fall of 2003." He
then goes on to list fifteen “theories” that, he says, “were gradually created as a smoke screen

513 Tn other words,

and advanced for public consumption,” including “tax evasion schemes.
Yukos’ tax arrangements in certain low-tax regions (some of which, notably in ZATO Lesnoy,
as related in Chapter VIII.A, were being scrutinized as of 1999 by the tax authorities and were
suspected of being “shams”) may have served as a plausible pretext for the State apparatus to
crush Mr. Khodorkovsky and expropriate Yukos. In this chapter, the Tribunal considers
evidence that is crucial to its determination of this central issue in the present proceedings. The
Tribunal observes again that its conclusions in this chapter are only concerned with factual
findings. The determination of the relevant legal issues under the provisions of the ECT will be

considered later, in Part X of the Award.

2. Chronology of the Tax Assessments and Related Decisions

On 29 December 2003, the tax authorities of the Russian Federation issued the first of five tax
assessments against Yukos based on the alleged abuse by Yukos of its tax optimization scheme.

These five assessments were:

For each year that the Tax Ministry re-assessed Yukos a Repeat/Field Tax Audit Report and a
Decision were issued. For ease of reference, in this chapter, each Audit Report and Decision
will be referred to by the tax year to which it relates. For example, the Tax Ministry audited
Yukos’ activities in the year 2000. It issued Field Tax Audit Report No. 08-1/1 on
29 December 2003 (“2000 Audit Report”). It issued Decision No. 14-3-05/1609-1 to hold the
taxpayer fiscally liable for a tax offense on 14 April 2004 (“2000 Decision”).

In the subsections below, the Tribunal records, for each tax year, the extensive chronology of
tax assessments and related decisions of the tax authorities, bailiffs and Russian courts. These

events as such are not disputed by the Parties.

(a) The 2000 Decision

As noted above, on 29 December 2003, the 2000 Audit Report, was issued.*'* It was followed,
on 14 April 2004, by the 2000 Decision holding the taxpayer liable for a tax offense.*!* It

levied the following amounts in tax arrears:

On the same day, 14 April 2004, a tax payment demand was issued to Yukos in the amount of
RUR 80,179,841,454 (USD 2.8 billion).*'7 Payment was due just two days later, on 16 April
2004. Also on 14 April 2004, a related fine was issued, imposing penalties in the amount of
RUR 19,195,696,780 (USD 671 million).°"* Payment of this sum was also due on 16 April
2004. The total amount payable within two days by Yukos was thus approximately
USD 3.48 billion.

On the same day, a ruling of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court prohibiting Yukos from alienating
and encumbering “in any way” its assets, including shares and other securities, was issued.**°

Yukos began parallel proceedings to those initiated by the Tax Ministry, challenging the 2000

suspending the effect of the 2000 Decision, pending a judgment on the merits of Yukos’

petition in respect of the lawfulness of the 2000 Decision? In her decision, Judge
Cheburashkina wrote that the seizure of such assets would “cause significant damage to the

Applicant’s activities and make it impossible to execute the judicial act” and that “the

d id d

 

ing that the indi d in

Applicant has
Article 90(2) of the RF Arbitrazh Procedure Code might arise, and that serious damage and
disruption might be caused to production activities.”***

On 26 May 2004, Yukos made a motion in the collection proceedings (those initiated by the
Tax Ministry) to join the Republic of Mordovia in those proceedings.*** The motion was not
successful. Presumably, Yukos sought the joinder of Mordovia, by far the major focus of its
trading companies’ activities and investments, in the expectation that Mordovian officials
would support the legitimacy of Yukos’ tax optimization procedures and attest to the value of

Yukos’ substantial investments in Mordovia.

In the collection proceedings, the court had also denied Yukos’ motion to stay the
proceedings.**° In a decision dated 26 May 2004 and released on 28 May 2004, Judge
Grechishkin of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court granted the Tax Ministry’s petition, allowing the
collection of tax arrears, interest and fines in the amount of RUR 99,375,110,548

(USD 3.48 billion) pertaining to the 2000 Decision.”

Judge Grechishkin found that Yukos had acted in bad faith,°* that the use by the trading
companies of tax benefits was illegal because it was “not aimed at strengthening the economy
of the Republic of Mordovia” but rather was used to “evade payment of taxes.”**? The judge
adopted the same reasoning as the Tax Ministry on the VAT issue, writing that: “In order to
use its right to the benefit, the taxpayer had to declare its right and confirm its right by
documents in accordance with the current legislation.... The taxpayer—OAO Yukos Oil
Company—did not declare its desire to use its benefit either in 2000 or later.”**” However, this

judgment could not be executed by the Tax Ministry as the interim relief in the parallel
proceedings prevented enforcement until a determination of the lawfulness of the 2000

Decision was made.

On 11 June 2004, Judge Cheburashkina, the presiding judge in the case brought by Yukos
against the lawfulness of the 2000 Decision, was challenged by the Tax Ministry for bias

531

towards Yukos in the granting of interim relief on 19 May 2004. The Tax Ministry cited
several reasons as a basis for her removal for bias towards Yukos, including: the allegation that
the interim measures “did not comply with the principles of justice in a democratic
constitutional State”;** the allegation that the judge granted a “recess solely for OAO Yukos
Oil Company to file a petition to stay proceedings in the [parallel] case to collect tax arrears,
interest and fines,” which the Tax Ministry saw as “evidence of the Judge’s interest in the
outcome of the proceedings in favor of the taxpayer”;*** her “behavior” in the preliminary court
proceedings;* the allegation that the judge declined the petition of the Tax Ministry to
abandon these proceedings in favour of the other set of collection proceedings initiated by the
Tax Ministry;**° and the allegation that the Tax Ministry was not granted extra time to copy
documents to bring to court. The challenge was upheld by the Moscow Arbitrazh Court the

same day.

On 15 June 2004, Judge O.R. Mikhailova, a deputy chair of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court, was
appointed to replace Judge Cheburashkina.**’ On 22 June 2004, Judge Mikhailova set the date
of 19 July 2004 for the hearing of the merits phase of the case on the lawfulness of the 2000
Decision. She also directed the Tax Ministry to provide originals of the documents rather than
photocopies and to organize the documents, including explanations “in order to confirm which

circumstances they support.”***

In the proceedings to initiate collection of the taxes assessed in the 2000 Decision, on 29 June
2004, a resolution of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court reduced the amount to be collected to

approximately USD 3.42 billion.”

In a decision dated 23 June 2004 but published on 30 June 2004, the interim measures granted
by Judge Cheburashkina were annulled by an appeal panel of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court.”
The court reasoned that as the Tax Ministry had not, at the time of the filing of the request,
placed any direct collection orders in accordance with Article 46(4) of the Russian Tax Code on
Yukos’ bank accounts, the interim measures had been granted without the proper basis in
law.*' It also concluded that there were other specific procedures that could be followed under
Article 91(1)(5) (in lieu of the interim relief granted under Article 90(2)) that did not require

a 342
interim measures.°”

Also on 30 June 2004, a resolution of Bailiff Solovyova was issued initiating enforcement
proceedings.** The bailiff then issued several more resolutions freezing cash in 16 Yukos bank

accounts up to the total amount of taxes then due.*“*

On 30 June 2004, the Tax Ministry obtained the reversal of the interim measures and initiated
enforcement proceedings. On the same day, the Field Tax Audit Report for 2001 was

released. It assessed taxes, interest, and fines totaling approximately USD 4.1 billion.*®

On 1 July 2004, another resolution was issued by Bailiff Solovyova limiting Yukos’ rights

pertaining to securities of 37 production, refining, and research subsidiaries.*””

On 9 July 2004, Bailiff Solovyova issued a resolution for a seven percent enforcement fee for
the proceedings relating to the 2000 Decision.*“* The fee amounted to approximately more than

RUR 6.8 billion (approximately USD 240 million).

On 13 July 2004, further resolutions were issued by the bailiffs to seize Yukos’ 14.5 percent
stake in Sibneft which had been ordered by the Chukotka Arbitrazh Court as an interim
measure in those proceedings.“ The Chukotka proceedings had been initiated by Mr. Roman
Abramovich and they related to disputes following the Yukos—Sibneft aborted merger. The
Tribunal notes that while this seizure was not directly related to Yukos’ trading companies, as
will be seen later, it limited the options available to Yukos to satisfy the payment demands it

was facing.

On 14 July 2004, pursuant to another resolution of the bailiffs, 43 ordinary shares and
13 preferred shares of Yukos in YNG were seized.*” At the same time, a resolution to restrict

the rights of the securities owner with respect to those shares was issued.**!

On 16 July 2004, Mr. Steven Theede sent a letter signed by Mr. Bruce Misamore to Mr. Alexei
Kudrin, then Minister of Finance. In the letter, Yukos petitioned the Ministry, “[i]n
consideration of the unprecedented nature of the sum that is subject to collection from
OAO Yukos Oil Company” for deferral of, or the opportunity to pay in installments, the
amount imposed by the collection decision of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court issued on 28 May
2004.5? When he gave evidence, Mr. Theede acknowledged that the letter was not perfect (the
proposals did not have a great deal of detail) but he described the letter as an attempt “to create
a dialogue [between Yukos and the Russian Federation].”**>

In the days leading to the Hearing on the Merits in the case brought by Yukos against the

lawfulness of the 2000 Decision, certain statements were made “in the mass media relat[ing] to

the [Yukos] case.”** The statements apparently included charges of bias against Judge

Mikhailova because she had previously written articles for a magazine edited by one of Yukos’

955

lawyers, Mr. Sergey Pepeliaev.””” While Judge Mikhailova denied the accusations of bias, she
nonetheless asked to be recused.**° On 19 July 2004, the day Judge Mikhailova had originally
scheduled a hearing on the lawfulness of the 2000 Decision, the Moscow Arbitrazh Court

granted her request to resign.°*’

On 6 August 2004, Yukos in-house counsel, Mr. Gololobov, sent a letter to the Chief Bailiff of
the Russian Federation renewing Yukos’ request to give priority to its 20 percent stake in
Sibneft above other assets. The same day, the Moscow Arbitrazh Court found that a 14 July
2004 bailiff’s resolution to seize shares of YNG was issued in error and that, instead, Yukos’
20 percent stake in Sibneft should have been seized.*** The court ruled that federal law on
enforcement proceedings outlines a priority order for enforcement against a debtor’s assets and
enforcement against lower assets is only possible when the higher assets are insufficient to

559)

settle the debts. Since the shares in YNG were of a lower priority than the more liquid

0

Sibneft shares, they should not have been seized before the Sibneft shares. Claimants

consider this to be a “rare victory” by Yukos before the Russian courts.°°'

On 12 August 2004, a ruling of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court denied Yukos’ petition to pay by
installments the amount levied by the Moscow Arbitrazh Court on 28 May 2004.%* Five days
later, the same court denied Yukos’ application that the bailiffs undertake enforcement against
its 34.5 percent stake in Sibneft before enforcement against other assets.**

In a decision of 18 August 2004 released on 23 August 2004, Yukos’ “rare victory” was
overturned by the Ninth Arbitrazh Court of Appeal. The court quashed the 6 August 2004

decision to give priority to enforcement against the 20 percent stake in Sibneft. The court
found that, as the shares in YNG had been issued by YNG after its privatization, they were not
related to primary production and thus could be considered as a higher priority. As Yukos
had not discharged its debt “voluntarily,” the court found that the YNG shares were part of an

inventory legally open to seizure by the bailiffs.*°

On 30 August 2004, the Tax Ministry sent a letter to Yukos, denying its request for deferred
payment or payment by installments.*°° This letter was in response to the letter intended to
“create a dialogue” between Yukos and the Russian Federation sent more than a month earlier

to the Finance Ministry by Messrs. Theede and Misamore.

On 9 September 2004, five days after a decision reassessing taxes against Yukos for 2001, a
letter from the Deputy Head of the Bailiffs Department notified the company that the arbitrazh

courts had approved seizures against YNG and other production subsidiaries.*””

On 23 November 2004, the resolution of the Ninth Arbitrazh Court of Appeal of 16 November

2004 was issued. It affirmed the lawfulness of the 2000 Decision.*®

(b) The 2001 Decision

On the same day, a tax payment demand with respect to the 2001 Decision was issued in the
amount of RUR 79,279,641,154 (approximately USD 2.7 billion). Again, payment was due
two days later, on 4 September 2004. A tax penalty was issued in the amount of

day, there was another resolution of Bailiff Borisov to join the enforcement proceedings for the

2000 Decision and the 2001 Decision.*”°

On 16 September 2004, Yukos reiterated its petition for voluntary enforcement by the bailiffs
against its holdings in Sibneft and non-core subsidiaries.°”* No response was received from the
bailiffs.’ The next communication received from the bailiffs was on 20 September 2004,
when they issued a resolution to collect a seven percent enforcement fee—

RUR 5,549,574,880.78 (approximately USD 190 million) for the 2001 Decision.*”*

As it had done in respect of the 2000 Decision, Yukos challenged the lawfulness of the 2001
Decision. Parallel proceedings were filed by the Tax Ministry for collection of the 2001

Decision. Judge Dzuba ruled in favour of the Tax Ministry.°”

On 29 October 2004, a Field Tax Audit Report for 2002 was released.**° It assessed tax arrears,
interest, and fines of approximately USD 6.8 billion.*™'

On 12 November 2004, Yukos sent a letter to the Judicial Collegium of the Russian Federation

 

laining that its chall to Judge K ko in the p dings concerning the lawfulness
of the 2001 Decision had not been heard.’ Yukos had challenged Judge Korotenko for bias,
on the ground that he had presided over the appeal panel of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court which

had made a decision in favour of the Tax Ministry in respect of the 2000 Decision.

In a hearing on 16-17 November 2004, Judge Korotenko denied Yukos’ request to join the
trading companies as third parties in the case against the 2001 Decision. Judge Korotenko

also denied Yukos’ motion to obtain an expert opinion on market prices of oil.***

On 18 November 2004, the Moscow Arbitrazh Court, Judge Korotenko presiding, affirmed the
legality of the two-day time limits set forth in the previous payment demands.*** The court also
rejected the arguments relating to the “massive” amounts assessed and the short time granted
for voluntary payment. The court stated that “[t]he tax legislation does not stipulate any
deadline for voluntary fulfillment by the taxpayer of the demand to pay taxes. Upon issue of
the Claim, the Inspectorate is entitled to stipulate a time period for its voluntary execution.”**°
This decision of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court was announced on the same day as a one-day
payment demand, relating to Decision No. 52/896 holding the taxpayer liable for a tax offense

(“2002 Decision”), became due. It also affirmed the lawfulness of the 2001 Decision.

Later, on 16 February 2005, a resolution of the Ninth Arbitrazh Court of Appeal of 9 February
2005, was issued. It reduced the overall amount payable for 2001 by approximately
USD 150 million.*’ On 15 November 2005, the Federal Arbitrazh Court for the Moscow

District also reduced, slightly, the amount of fines payable for 2001.***

On 19 November 2004, Field Audit Report No. 52/907 for 2003 was issued. It assessed tax

arrears, interest and fines of approximately USD 5.9 billion.”

On 24 November 2004, Yukos filed a petition for voluntary enforcement of the resolution of

18 November 2004.°°° No response was received from the bailiffs.

In relation to the 2002 Decision, there were no parallel proceedings: only a single proceeding
which addressed both the lawfulness and the collection of the 2002 Decision. In a hearing on
8-9 December 2004, Yukos challenged Judge D.I. Dzuba, because, it submitted, the judge had
“already formed a subjective negative opinion about OAO Yukos Oil Company as the guilty
party” since he had presided over the collections case relating to the 2001 Decision. The
challenge was never heard by the court.” On 16 December 2004, Judge Dzuba denied Yukos’

request to obtain an expert opinion on oil market prices.**

Between these events, on 9 December 2004, a resolution of the bailiffs to collect a 7 percent
enforcement fee, RUR 2,737,919,857.85, was issued.’ On 23 December 2004, the court
upheld the lawfulness of the 2002 Decision.

However, on 21 June 2006, the Moscow Arbitrazh Court issued a decision®'* confirming the
lawfulness of the Tax Ministry’s claims relating to the arrears claimed in the 2004 Decision in
the amount of RUR 66,391,719,284 (USD 2.4 billion). On 18 August 2004, the Ninth

The lawfulness of the fines was eventually affirmed by the Moscow Arbitrazh Court on

(f) Observation

This chronology of the five tax assessments against Yukos for the years 2000-2004 and related
decisions of the Tax Ministry, the Russian courts and the bailiffs is lengthy and tedious. But it
is very much part of the factual matrix which will inform the Tribunal when it answers the
question posed at the outset of the chapter: “Why would Russia have treated Yukos as it did if

its purpose was to collect taxes?”

3. The Taxes Assessed Against Yukos

The principal taxes assessed against Yukos were profit tax and VAT. Together they account
for over 95 percent of the total amount of more than USD 24 billion including related fines and
interest. Details in relation to profit tax and certain other revenue-based taxes are provided in

Subsection (a) below. Details in relation to VAT are set out in Subsection (b) below.

(a) Profit Tax and Other Revenue-based Taxes

As shown in the table below, for the tax years 2000 to 2004, the tax authorities imposed a
demand for the payment of profit tax (including interest and fines) ranging from
USD 261 million to USD 4 billion per year, for a total of USD 9.5 billion. This represents
some 39 percent of the total tax claims levied against Yukos in the reassessments for those
years. Other revenue-based taxes (also including interest and fines) assessed against Yukos

added approximately USD | billion to the total. The breakdown by individual tax year is as

 

 

 

 

follows:°"”

(IN USD BILLION) 2000 | 2001 2002 2003 2004 Total %
Profit tax 1.356 | 1.695 | 4.005 | 2.184 | 0.261 9.502 39.3

The reasoning by the tax authorities for the imposition of profit tax and the other sundry
revenue-based taxes did not vary substantively from year to year. For purposes of the present

chapter, the Tribunal will therefore consider the documents relating to the 2000 tax year.

The 2000 Audit Report concludes that, during the year 2000, Yukos knowingly and deliberately

operated a tax evasion scheme through the use of “sham dependent entities”. The Audit Report

2618

describes the “discovery” ” of the scheme as follows:

During the field tax audit, non-payment by OAO Yukos Oil Company of corporate profit
tax, road users tax, property tax and housing support tax, arising from the use of an
unlawful scheme involving evasion of tax through artificial creation of sham companies in
the oil and oil product movement chain, which were registered in territories with a
beneficial tax regime, was discovered.

The aim of using this scheme was non-payment of taxes on the sum of revenue (income)
received from the sale of oil and oil products. For this purpose OAO Yukos Oil Company
created sham dependent entities, which functioned as oil and oil product owners
(hereinafter — the “owners”). These entities were registered in territories in which a
beneficial tax regime applied (Closed administrative-territorial formations) [CATF],
regions of the Russian Federation, providing tax benefits on investments). OAO Yukos
Oil Company had control over the operations, conducted by the oil and oil product
“owners”, by participating in the transactions as an intermediary (confirmed by documents
shown in Attachment No. /4 to the field tax audit document) or by bringing in other
entities dependent on OAO Yukos Oil Company to participate in transactions as an
intermediary."'

The 2000 Audit Report continues:

According to Mr. Konnov the use of the term “discovered” at the end of the first paragraph of the cited passage of the

 

Audit Report (*L...] non-payment [. of corporate profit tax [...] arising from the use of an unlawful scheme
involving evasion of taxes [...] was discovered.”) is a mistranslation. Mr. Konnov suggested that the original wording
inR in is better translated as “the audit concluded or established that [...].” Transcript, Day 13 at 167; see also

The audit established that the actual owner of the oil and oil products was OAO Yukos Oil
Company. The oil was in fact acquired and transferred for refining, and the oil and oil
products sold, by OAO Yukos Oil Company, as evidenced by the actual movement of oil
and oil products from production entities to oil refineries or to oil bases controlled by OAO
Yukos Oil Company, as confirmed in the trade and transport documents, and also the direct
participation by OAO Yukos Oil Company in all the operations. The following also
provides proof that the oil and oil products actually belonged to OAO Yukos Oil Company
[sic] and that the tax evasion scheme applied by them was illegal:

- interdependence of persons participating in the transactions and their control by OAO
Yukos Oil Company;

registration of the “owners” in territories with beneficial tax regimes;
= non-activity by the “owners” in their places of registration;

- the fictitious commission payments to OAO Yukos Oil Company, which are much
smaller than the actual payments made on the intermediary market;

- the understated prices of acquisition of oil from production entities and from other
sham companies;

the conduct of accounting in all the entities by OOO Yukos-Invest, or by Yukos-FBTs
000, which are dependent on OAO Yukos Oil Company;

= the opening of accounts for all the entities in the same banks, which are dependent on
OAO Yukos Oil Company;

- the utilisation of promissory note settlements between the entities, or settlements by
means of mutual set-off.

The 2000 Audit Report goes into great detail in explaining the tax benefits that were claimed by
each of the trading entities. The Audit Reports for subsequent tax years generally follow the
same form. They audit OAO Yukos Oil Company and the trading companies. They are
divided into separate sections for each trading company; some of the later reassessments also
include sums assessed directly against OAO Yukos Oil Company. The sections on the trading
companies generally begin with an overview of the incorporation, ownership, and capital of the
company. They then affirm that the directors of the company and its operations are not based
in the region in which it had been incorporated, which according to the authors of the Audit
Reports, shows that the company could not benefit from preferential taxation agreements
offered to companies operating in the low-tax regions. The reassessments then assert that the
trading companies are “interrelated” and thus “dependent” on OAO Yukos Oil Company,

thereby allowing OAO Yukos Oil Company to fraudulently claim taxation benefits.
The 2000 Audit Report concludes in relation to the tax evasion by Yukos as follows:

The tax evasion by OAO Yukos Oil Company, through registration of sham companies in
territories with preferential tax rates, with the exclusive aim of evading tax, and

which ... did not actually trade or engage in any activity in those territories or indeed
anywhere else, or invest any money in the economies of the relevant constituent entities of
the Russian Federation, and which, therefore, illegally applied the additional tax benefits,
indicates that OAO Yukos Oil Company acted in bad faith,

According to the Russian Federation Constitutional Court’s 25 July 2001 Ruling
No. 138-O interpreting the provision contained in Article 3(7) of the RF Tax Code, in the
area of taxation there is a presumption of good faith on the part of taxpayers.

As is evident from the above-mentioned Ruling, the presumption of taxpayer good faith,
enshrined in the RF Tax Code, presupposes an obligation on the tax authorities to prove
any bad faith on the part of taxpayers in the manner set out by the Russian Federation Tax
Code, and to conduct the necessary audits in order to establish such bad faith with the aim
of ensuring a balance between state and private interests.

Similar provisions are contained in RF Constitutional Court Rulings Nos. 4-O dated
10.01.2002 and 108-O dated 14.05.2002.

The Judgements of the Presidium of the RF Supreme Court of Arbitration Nos. 9408/00
dated 18.09.2001, 7374/01 dated 18.06.2002, 6294/01 dated 05.11.2002 and 11259/02
dated 17.12.2002, and a letter from the Deputy President of the RF Supreme Court of
Arbitration No. $5-3/up-342 dated 17.04.2002, also point out the need to examine the
question of bad faith on the part of taxpayers, that is, their commission of deliberate acts
aimed at not fulfilling the constitutional obligation to pay taxes.

The above-mentioned circumstances, namely OAO Yukos Oil Company carrying out
operations involving the purchase and sale of oil and oil products, indicate Yukos Oil
Company’s OAO bad faith, which evidences its deliberate actions in evading payment of
taxes through the application of illegal schemes.

... According to the Regulations of 01.01.2000 on the accounting policy for the year 2000,
in OAO Yukos Oil Company for purposes of taxation (in order to calculate corporate profit
tax, value added tax, Road users tax and housing support tax) revenue from the sale of
products and goods (work, services) was determined on the basis of actual payments.

For purposes of taxation revenue was indicated by the entity in the accounts in the line 010
of the account using form No.2 “Profit and Loss Account” taking into account the
Information on the procedure for determination of data indicated in line 1 of “Calculation
of tax on actual profit” in a sum of RUR 36,396,312,000 (RUR 36,264,009,000 in Form
No. 2, “Profit and Loss Account” + RUR 132,303,000 according to the Information on the
procedure for determination of data indicated in p.1 of “Calculation of tax on actual
profit”).

According to the data of the audit, revenue from the sale of goods (work, services)
amounted to RUR 245,907,712,162.

Thus, the revenue from the sale of goods (work, services) in the sum of RUR
209,511,400,162 was understated as a result of non-indication in the accounting registers
of the revenue which had been received as a result of utilising a scheme with the
participation of sham entities which were dependent on OAO Yukos Oil Company and
which had been created for the purpose of tax evasion on the part of OAO Yukos Oil
Company... .°2!
587. The 16 November 2004 decision of the Ninth Arbitrazh Court of Appeal upheld the 2000
Decision to hold Yukos liable for all these taxes. The English translation of the judgment is

25 pages long. The key passages, which the Tribunal believes should be set out so as to give

1 Tbid., pp. 14-15.

- 195 -

visibility to the court’s reasoning (which the Tribunal will consider later as part of the totality

of the evidence), follow:

OAO Yukos Oil Company did not agree with the decision of the Court and filed an appeal
requesting that the decision of the Court of First Instance be quashed and that the presented
claim be granted in full: to declare unlawful the Russian Federation Ministry of Taxes and
Levies Decision No. 14-3-05/1609-1 of 14.04.2004 to Hold the Taxpayer Fiscally Liable
for a Tax Offense.

.. The interested party, the Russian Federation Ministry of Taxes and Levies, argues that
the Court of First Instance legally and justifiably found that the decision and resolution
issued in Case No. A40-17669/04-109-241 [i.e., the 26May 2004 decision], which
involves the same parties as Case No. A40-21839/04-76-276 [i-e., the case before the Court
of Appeal], established the legality and validity of the disputed RF Tax Ministry Decision,
the circumstances surrounding OAO Yukos Oil Company’s performance of actions aimed
at evading taxes through the artificial formation of entities registered in territories with
preferential tax rates and their “participation” in the chain of movement of oil and oil
products, and the illegality and invalidity of OAO Yukos Oil Company’s arguments
regarding the illegality of the RF Tax Ministry’s disputed Decision.

 

Pursuant to Article 69(2) of the RF Arbitrazh Procedure Code, facts established by the
legally effective judicial act of an arbitrazh court in connection with a previously heard
case do not need to be proven again when the arbitrazh court hears another case involving
the same parties.

The Court Decision of 26.05.2004 in Case No. A40-17669/ 04-109-241 established that the
tax authority did not breach the requirements of Article 87 of the RF Tax Code when
issuing Decision No. 14-3-05/1609-1 of 14.04.2004. The Court found that RF Tax
Ministry Decision No. 14-3-05/1609-1 of 14.04.2004 is consistent with the Russian
Federation Tax Code, federal laws adopted pursuant to the RF Tax Code, and other tax
laws that were in effect during the audit period.

  

.. The Court found that the entities registered in territories with preferential tax rates and
named in the RF Tax Ministry’s Decision (Yu-Mordovia OOO, Alta-Trade OOO, Ratmir
000, Mars XXII OOO, Jupiter XXIV OOO, ZAO Yukos-M, Saturn XXV OOO, Yuksar
000, Siberian Transportation Company OOO, Quercus OOO, Muskron OOO, Nortex
000, Grace 000, Colrain OOO, Virtus OOO, Plast OOO, Mitra OOO, Vald-Oil OOO,
Business-Oil OOO, Staf OOO, Petroleum-Trading OOO) were related to each other and
dependent on OAO Yukos Oil Company. The relationship of all the entities and their
dependence on OAO Yukos Oil Company, as one of the items of evidence of bad faith on
the part of the Applicant which applied the illegal tax evasion scheme is also confirmed by
the fact that the same individuals were the founders and (or) officers in the aforementioned
entities.

.. The Court rightly found that control of the oil and oil-product transactions performed
by the entities registered in territories with preferential tax rates was exercised OAO Yukos
Oil Company by means of participation in the transactions as an intermediary or by means
of involvement of other entities, dependent on OAO Yukos Oil Company, as
intermediaries in the transactions. The entities registered in territories with preferential tax
rates concluded agency agreements for the purchase of crude oil with OAO Yukos Oil
Company. In turn, OAO Yukos Oil Company, acting on behalf of entities registered in
territories with preferential tax rates, purchased oil from producing entities or from other
suppliers. Thereafter, the crude oil purchased via the agent (OAO Yukos Oil Company)
was sold to buyers (Russian or foreign) via this same OAO Yukos Oil Company (as the
commission agent or the agent) or transferred for refining to refineries which were
subsidiaries of OAO Yukos Oil Company. Apart from agency agreements, purchase and

 

- 196 -

sale agreements were drawn up for purchase of oil, according to conditions thereof, OAO
Yukos Oil Company “sold” oil from the resources of its producing entities - OAO
Yuganskneftegaz, OAO Samaraneftegaz, and OAO Tomskneft. Unlike OAO Yukos Oil
Company and its producing companies, which according to the customs cargo declarations
were shippers, the entities registered in regions with preferential tax rates were not
mentioned in the export documents.

The dependence of entities, registered in territories with preferential tax rates, on OAO
Yukos Oil Company and the control by OAO Yukos Oil Company of all transactions is
also confirmed by the fact that the records of all transactions associated with the purchase
and transfer of oil for refining, as well as with the sale of oil and oil products (including
accounting records) were kept by Yukos-Invest OOO and Yukos-FBTs, which are
dependent on OAO Yukos Oil Company. Furthermore, the entities registered in territories
with preferential tax rates entered into production management service contracts with OOO
Yukos RM, which is also dependent on OAO Yukos Oil Company. The financial
statements and tax filings were submitted to the tax authorities by post from the address at
which OAO Yukos Oil Company was located according to the invoices. Furthermore, this
address was the mailing address of OOO Yukos-Moscow, which is the executive body of
OAO Yukos Oil Company.

The accounts of all entities are opened with the same banks, ic. OAO Trust Investment
Bank, OAO Bank Menatep St. Petersburg and Bank Solidarnost, where OAO Yukos Oil
Company was a shareholder.

In addition to concluding agreements on the purchase and sale of oil and oil products, these
entities also conducted activities involving the purchase and sale of promissory notes,
which they used in settlements with one another and with OAO Yukos Oil Company for
oil and oil products. Or by purchasing and selling promissory notes, these entities returned
to OAO Yukos Oil Company funds supposedly earned for oil they sold. Therefore, the
business of these entities related to the purchase and sale of promissory notes is a business
related to the purchase and sale of oil and oil products. Therefore, the Court lawfully and
justifiably rejected the Applicant’s argument that the entities registered in territories with
preferential tax rates engaged in business activities other than the sale of oil and oil
products.

The Applicant’s assertion that the determination of bad faith is possible exclusively in the
instances of payment of taxes through insolvent banks is unfounded, as the finding that it is
necessary for the tax authorities to conduct audits and determine bad faith was made by the
Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation based on the interpretation of Article 3(7)
of the RF Tax Code, i.e. the presumption of the taxpayers’ good faith. From this follows
the obligation of taxpayers to act in good faith when conducting any actions associated
with the discharge of their tax liability and the right of the tax authorities to determine bad
faith on the part of taxpayers committing actions (inaction) intentionally aimed at tax
evasion.

In light of the foregoing circumstances, the Court rightly found that the owner of the oil
and oil products was OAO Yukos Oil Company. The purchase and transfer of the oil for
refining and the sale of oil and oil products were actually carried out by OAO Yukos Oil
Company as the owner.

...The Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation, in Ruling No. 138-O of
25.07.2001, points out that, according to the tenor of Article 3(7) of the RF Tax Code, the
presumption of good faith on the part of taxpayers is in effect in the area of tax relations.
For the purpose of determination of bad faith on the part of taxpayers, the tax authorities
have the right—in order to ensure a balance between State and private interests—to carry
out the necessary audit and to file with the arbitrazh courts claims that ensure the receipt of
taxes into the budget. In light of the above, in order to ensure a balance between State and
private interests, the tax authorities have the right to conduct audits for the purpose of

 

- 197-

622

determination of the actual owner of sold property and for determination of bad faith on the
part thereof, d in the application of a tax evasion scheme.

The fact that OAO Yukos Oil Company had the rights of possession, use and disposal with
respect to the oil and oil products, and at its own discretion performed with respect thereto
any actions, including alienation, transfer_for ing, etc. through sham entities

dent on OAO Yukos Oil Company was i by the legally effective judicial
acts in Case No. A40-17669/04-109-241.

The Court therefore rightly does not accept the argument of the Applicant and the third
party regarding the ii with law and the factual _cii of the
of taxes to OAO Yukos Oil Company as the owner of the oil and oil products.

 

. . The circumstances established by the Court concerning the transactions of OAO Yukos
Oil Company associated with the purchase and sale of oil and oil products and in their
interconnection and collectively indicate bad faith on the part of OAO Yukos Oil
Company, which is reflected in the intentional actions aimed at tax evasion by means of
application of illegal schemes, as a result of which the RF Tax Ministry lawfully held OAO
Yukos Oil Company liable pursuant to Article 122(3) of the Russian Federation Tax Code,
for the intentional failure to pay or an incomplete payment of tax as a result of reduction of
the tax base, other incorrect tax calculations, or other unlawful actions (inaction), in the
form of a fine in the amount of 40 percent of the unpaid tax amount, as established by the
judicial acts in Case No. A40-17669/04-109-241.

. . .Therefore, the Moscow Arbitrazh Court in its decision legally and justifiably found that
RF Tax Ministry Decision No. 14-3-05/1609-1 of 14.04.2004 to Hold the Taxpayer
Fiscally Liable for a Tax Offense is legal and well-founded in part and complies with the
Russian Federation Tax Code, federal laws adopted pursuant to the RF Tax Code, and
other tax laws that were in effect during the audit period (the Russian Federation Law
No. 2116-1 of 27.12.91 “On Corporate Profit Tax”, the Russian Federation Law
No. 1759-1 of 18.10.1991 “On Road Funds in the Russian Federation”, the Russian
Federation Law No. 2118-1 of 27.12.1991 “On Fundamentals of the Tax System”, the
Russian Federation Law No. 2030-1 of 13.12.1991 “On Corporate Property Tax” and the
Russian Federation Law No. 1992-1 of 06.12.1991 “On Value Added Tax”).

[emphasis added]

The Tribunal will discuss the key elements of this decision, notably its endorsement of the
assessment of taxes against Yukos on the basis that Yukos was the “actual owner” of the oil

and oil products, in Section VIII.B.5 below.

(b) VAT

As shown in the table below, for the tax years 2000 to 2004, the tax authorities imposed a
demand for the payment of VAT (including interest and fines) ranging from USD 1 billion to
USD 4 billion per year, for a total of USD 13.59 billion. This represents some 56 percent of

The reasoning of the tax authorities for the imposition of VAT payments did not change from
year to year. For purposes of this chapter, the Tribunal will therefore consider solely the

documents relating to the 2000 tax year.

But before turning to the reasoning for the imposition of VAT payments on Yukos, the Tribunal

will review some features of the VAT regulations of the Russian Federation.

In Russia, VAT is a federal tax levied at uniform rates throughout the Federation. As a result,
all companies pay VAT regardless of the region where they are registered, under identical
terms and conditions. There are accordingly no additional VAT benefits for companies
incorporated in low-tax regions. The applicable rate of VAT to oil and oil products was 20% in

2000 to 2003 and 18 percent in 2004.5

If the products were exported, they were either exempt from VAT (2000) or subject to a zero

percent VAT rate (2001 onwards). The zero percent rate is not automatic, but available when

626

the taxpayer files a monthly or quarterly VAT return.’ It is common ground between the

Figures derived from Details of Yukos’ Alleged Tax Reassessments, Exh. C-593; see also Claimants’ Opening Slides,
pp. 62-63.

First Konnoy Report § 56. See also Articles 165(9) and 164(3), Russian Tax Code, Exhs. R-1484 and R-1483.

 

As a result, exporting companies did not charge VAT to their foreign customers and were entitled to the refunds on the
VAT charged by their own suppliers. See Dubov WS § 37; see also Memorial § 319.

Parties that, in the years 1999 to 2003, the Yukos trading companies filed the VAT returns for
1,27

their exports of oil
The 2000 Decision notes that Yukos failed to reflect revenue from the sale of products “arising
from the use of an unlawful scheme involving evasion of tax through artificial creation of sham
companies in the oil and oil product movement chain, which were registered in territories with

a beneficial tax regime.”** The 2000 Decision then states:

The aim of using this scheme was non-payment of corporate profit tax value added tax,
road users tax, tax on sales of fuel and lubricants (hereinafter referred to as F&L) and
housing support tax on the sum of revenue (income) received from the sale of oil and oil
products.
The VAT at issue was the VAT in relation to which the Yukos trading companies had already
obtained an exemption or zero percent rate, not VAT that could be said to arise from new or
additional transactions or from a finding that the oil or oil products had not actually been
exported. During his cross-examination at the Hearing, Mr. Konnov explained that the
reasoning behind the imposition of VAT on Yukos is very clear from the original Russian-
language version of the decision. The 2000 Decision states (in the Russian language original)
that it is Yukos, as the actual exporter, which must file the VAT return in order to get the VAT

tax benefit which had earlier been granted to its trading entities. Mr. Konnov explained:

A. And then there is a sentence which I don’t see in the English text, which says:

“Based on the foregoing, the actual export operations were conducted by
OAO NK Yukos and tax claim were provided to ZAO Yukos-M.”

And that’s the sentence on the point; for some reason it’s not in the English text.
So I agree maybe it’s not a detailed sentence, but what it clearly tells to any tax
lawyer, or to Yukos, I think: that Yukos — sorry, Yukos-M claimed the tax benefits
and was provided the tax benefits, and the actual exporter who must file the return
is Yukos.*”
In other words, while it was the trading companies that were set up in Yukos’ tax structure as
the entities exporting oil and oil products to purchasers abroad that filed VAT returns to claim

the exemption or zero percent rate that applies to export transactions, and in spite of the fact

that the trading companies had already qualified for the exemption or zero percent rate on the
basis of duly submitted VAT returns, the tax authorities subsequently determined that Yukos
itself was the “actual exporter”, and that it was Yukos, instead of the trading entities, that had
to qualify for the exemption or zero percent rate. Since Yukos had not filed the returns itself, it
was deemed to have failed to file the VAT returns required to benefit from the exemption or

zero percent rate.

The judgment of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court that confirmed the decision for the 2000 tax year

rejected Yukos’ appeal against the VAT assessments:

The court does not accept the arguments of OAO Yukos Oil Company regarding
unlawfulness of the RF Tax Ministry Decision No. 14-3-05/1609-1 of 14.04.2004 relating
to assessment of the value added tax. It follows from the RF Tax Ministry Decision that
the tax authority assessed VAT reimbursed to entities registered in the territories with
preferential tax rates upon their applications on export transactions. Pursuant to Law
No. 1992-1 of 06.12.1991 “On Value-Added Tax,” effective during that period, exemption
from payment of value-added tax when exporting goods (work, services) was a benefit. In
order to use its right to the benefit, the taxpayer had to declare its right and confirm its right
by d in with the current legislation. The taxpayer — OAO Yukos Oil
Company ~ did not declare its desire to use its benefit either in 2000 or later.°"

 

[emphasis added]
At the Hearing, Mr. Konnov described as follows “the essence” of the reasoning in the decision

and subsequent judgment:

[T]hat Yukos did not file tax return, and in the absence of the tax return it is not eligible for
a 0% VAT rate.”

Mr. Konnoyv also confirmed at the Hearing that the same reasoning was applied for subsequent

tax years.

4, The Fines Assessed Against Yukos

against Yukos ranging from USD 670 million to USD 2.5 billion per year, for a total of

USD 8.5 billion. This represents some 35% of the total tax claims levied against Yukos in the

reassessments for those years. The breakdown by individual tax year is as follows:°™*

Article 122 of the Russian Tax Code establishes a taxpayer’s liability for “non-payment or
underpayment of taxes.” Pursuant to paragraph | of this provision, the sanction is a 20 percent
fine on the unpaid amount of taxes. Under paragraph 3 of this provision, this fine can be
increased to 40 percent of the unpaid amount if the offense is committed intentionally. This fine
has been referred to in this case as the “willful offender” fine. Under Articles 110(2) and 110(4)
of the Russian Tax Code, the intention of a company requires, inter alia, that the awareness of
the company’s executives of the unlawful nature of their actions (or failure to act) be
established. Finally, under Articles 112(2) and 114(4) of the Russian Tax Code, the fines can
be increased to 80 percent, concretely, be doubled, in cases of so-called “repeat” offenses,
i.e. offenses committed by “‘a person, which has been previously held liable for a similar tax

99635
offense.”®

This fine has been referred to in this case as the “repeat offender” fine.
Yukos was assessed both the “willful offender’ and the “repeat offender” fines by the

authorities.

The Tax Ministry, referring to Article 110(2) of the Russian Tax Code, claimed that for the year

2000, “[Yukos] deliberately committed the acts aimed at evading payment of taxes, and its

39636

officers were aware of the unlawful nature of such actions. On this basis, the fines on

Figures (in USD billions) derived from Details of Yukos’ Alleged Tax Reassessments, Exh. C-593. The fines levied
in relation to unpaid VAT alone account for a total of some USD 4.8 billion for the tax years 2000-2004, with the
balance of USD 3.7 billion levied in relation to all of the other types of taxes (the majority—-USD 3.3 billion—of the
remaining amount being levied in relation to profit tax).

Yukos were doubled from the standard rate of 20 percent to 40 percent. Yukos was thus
charged, by reference to Article 122(3), with a 40 percent fine on the amount of its alleged tax
arrears.” The same reasoning was used by the tax authorities to impose fines on Yukos for the

years 2001-2004.°%*

The Tax Ministry then doubled the fines once more for the years 2001 to 2004 (the year 2000
being considered as the first “offense”), in order to reach an 80 percent fine on the alleged tax
arrears. This was done on the basis of Articles 112(2) and 114(4) of the Russian Tax Code

regarding repeat tax offenses.”

5. Parties’ Arguments and Tribunal’s Observations

In Chapter VIII.A of the present Award, the Tribunal has found that Yukos had run afoul of the
tax authorities prior to December 2003 in some of the low-tax regions, notably in the ZATOs
(Lesnoy and Trekhgorny) and in Kalmykia. The Tribunal noted earlier that Yukos had wound
up its trading entities in Lesnoy and Trekhgorny, and merged them into two separate companies
based outside of the ZATOs. These companies later merged to form Investproekt, based in yet
another region of Russia. The shuffling of these companies, as the Tribunal observed in
Chapter VIII.A, while completed before any decisions were issued against the companies for
being shams and for their use of promissory notes to pay (and even overpay) its tax bills, does
raise troubling questions which were never answered to the satisfaction of the Tribunal. It
suggests that Yukos was aware of the vulnerability of its tax optimization scheme and took
steps to minimize its exposure when elements of the scheme were being investigated. This
evidence has been thoroughly reviewed and commented upon by the Tribunal in

Chapter VIILA.

In principle, therefore, both Yukos and members of its management were exposed to further
findings of civil and/or criminal liability in connection with these activities as there is no
evidence in the record that any tax payable as a result of the investigation of the trading entities

in the ZATOs was ever paid. It is in this context that the Russian Federation charged

Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev with tax offenses, and reassessed taxes against Yukos as

of December 2003.

In this section, the Tribunal considers the Parties’ specific arguments in respect of each element
of the tax assessments that began in December 2003 and continued at a very rapid pace
throughout 2004 (covering the tax years 2000 through 2004). As described in the earlier
subsections of the present chapter, these elements included assessments for profit tax and other
revenue-based taxes, VAT and fines. While the Tribunal considers the Parties’ arguments for
each discrete element of the tax assessments, ultimately its conclusions are based on a
consideration of the tax assessments as a whole as well as the two trials and convictions of
Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev. The Tribunal adopts this totality-of-the-evidence

approach for several reasons.

Firstly, the Parties’ arguments regarding the tax assessments rest on all-or-nothing propositions.
On the one hand, Claimants argue that the tax assessments as a whole were conceived and
crafted to fabricate debt “under the guise of taxes,” and in amounts deliberately large enough to
bankrupt Yukos. Respondent, on the other hand, insists that the tax assessments were entirely

legitimate, and that Yukos’ demise was self-inflicted.

Secondly, the discrete elements of the tax assessments are, in fact and in law, closely
intertwined. For example, as explained in greater detail below, the enormous liability imposed
on Yukos for non-payment of VAT (and for the multiple fines associated with their
non-payment) was made possible only because the revenues of Yukos’ trading entities were
“re-attributed” to Yukos itself. It would therefore be artificial to deal with the complexity of
this case by deconstructing the various elements of the tax assessments without, in the end,

taking the broader perspective that is required to properly appreciate each one of them.

(a) Profit Tax and Other Revenue-Based Taxes

i. Introduction

Claimants submit that the revocation of regional tax benefits on revenue-based taxes
(principally the regional and local shares of profit tax) was the first step in the Russian
Federation’s fabrication of taxes targeting Yukos. Claimants argue that the revocation of these
benefits was arbitrary because (a) such benefits were expressly provided for in Russian federal

and regional legislation with which the Yukos entities complied, and (b) the tax benefits were

613.

known to and approved by the relevant authorities (with whom, in some cases the trading
640

entities entered into tax investment agreements).
Respondent submits that the Russian Federation’s revocation of the tax benefits was a
legitimate and appropriate response to Yukos’ tax optimization scheme under Russia’s anti-
abuse doctrine. Respondent contends that all of the Yukos trading entities were sham letter-box
companies, with no assets, employees or operations of their own, that were managed by Yukos

itself."

ii, | Was the “Bad-Faith Taxpayer” Doctrine Available at the Time of
the Yukos Tax Assessments to Challenge a Tax Evasion Scheme?

As an initial matter, the Tribunal notes that it has already confirmed, in Chapter VIII.A of the
present Award, that the “bad-faith taxpayer doctrine” existed in the Russian Federation at the
time of the issuance of the 2000 Tax Audit in December 2003 and, therefore, at the time of

1,42

subsequent audits as well Indeed, even Claimants acknowledged the existence of the

doctrine.

Claimants cannot, therefore, impugn the Russian Federation’s revocation of the benefits related
to profit tax solely on the basis that the low-tax regions were competent to grant such tax
benefits under that applicable legislation, and that “no breach of that legislation has been
alleged.”** However, such an argument does not seem to take account of the impact of
Russia’s anti-abuse doctrine or “bad-faith taxpayer” doctrine which, as the Tribunal has already

concluded, may constitute a ground for the reassessment of a party’s tax liabilities.

The Tribunal recalls however that, at the time of the tax assessments against Yukos, the
“business purpose” doctrine (a variant of the “substance over form” and “bad faith taxpayer”
doctrines) had not yet been explicitly adopted into Russian law. As noted earlier in
Chapter VIII.A, the “business purpose” doctrine was not adopted until October 2006, in
Resolution No. 53 dated 12 October 2006 of the Plenum of the Russian Supreme Arbitrazh

Court. As also mentioned in Chapter VIII.A, Russian tax scholars and practitioners appear

divided as to whether Resolution No. 53 represented a break with the doctrines that existed at

the time of the Yukos assessments, or was a natural evolution of those doctrines.

The Tribunal, recalling that Mr. Pepeliaev alluded to something akin to the “business purpose”
doctrine in his commentary on Constitutional Court Ruling 138-O (published in 2002), is of the
view that it was open to the Russian authorities and the courts to rely on the “bad faith
taxpayer” doctrine to challenge a tax evasion scheme at the time of the Yukos tax assessments,
whether based on “substance over form” or “business purpose.” Although this was an area of
the law that was evolving at the time, this alone cannot be determinative. Indeed, the
anti-abuse doctrine was a judicial doctrine, and the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate to
criticize the Russian Federation only because such a doctrine had not yet fully crystallized. To
the contrary, the circumstances surrounding Yukos’ tax optimization scheme suggest to the
Tribunal that this is precisely the kind of case in which the doctrine could be relied upon by the
authorities and the judiciary. Nevertheless, Claimants argue that the decision to revoke the
profit tax benefits was illegitimate because of the manner in which the “bad-faith taxpayer”
doctrine was applied. In particular, Claimants submit that the “re-attribution” of the trading
companies’ revenue to Yukos was unprecedented and had no basis in law. Further, Claimants
submit that there were glaring violations of due process throughout the tax assessment and tax

enforcement proceedings. The Tribunal addresses each of those arguments in turn.

 

Was “Re-attribution” an Appropriate Remedy to Apply to
Yukos?

Claimants argue that the authorities should have applied the transfer-pricing rules of Articles 20
and 40 of the Russian Tax Code to address any concerns about Yukos’ avoidance of tax in the
low-tax regions. Instead, the authorities “re-attributed” to Yukos the revenues of all of its
trading companies. According to Claimants, this remedy was unprecedented, had no basis in
law and was obviously another ploy in the Russian Federation’s fabrication of taxes against

5
Yukos.*

As mentioned, Claimants submit that the proper decision, and indeed the only decision, that the
tax authorities should have issued would have been to apply the transfer-pricing provisions of
Articles 20 and 40 of the Russian Tax Code. In this context, in their Post-Hearing Brief,

Claimants argue as follows:

11. Similarly, the Respondent’s attempt to dismiss the relevance of the ubiquitous
references to Yukos in the tax authorities’ documentation relating to the trading companies
ignores the realities of the Russian context. There was no domestic market for crude oil in
Russia, and as Dresdner observed, “[o]il sales on the Russian internal market consist[ed]
mainly of internal sales between the sister companies of the large integrated Russian oil
companies”. In this context, when conducting a tax audit of a company whose activities
consisted of trading crude oil produced by Yukos’ production companies, it would have
been natural for the tax authorities to examine whether the trading company and the
production company were “interdependent” under Article 20 of the Tax Code, and if so,
whether the sales transactions complied with the transfer pricing provisions of Article 40.
This is precisely what the tax authorities did, finding no violations of Article 40 prior to the
December 2003 Audit Report.“°

Claimants add:

Mr. Konnov has conceded that the transfer pricing provisions of Articles 20 and 40 were
available to the tax authorities and, although cumbersome to apply, could have fully dealt
with any allegedly improper tax savings, yet as he has confirmed, the tax authorities never
offered any explanation as to why they did not use Article 40 and instead invented a re-
attribution theory. As Mr. Savseris has written, referring specifically to the Yukos case, it
was wholly inappropriate for the tax authorities to resort to judicial doctrines to address a
situation covered by these express statutory provisions, noting that “[iJf the generally
established principles in the West for the application of judicial doctrines were respected,

this would have been impossible”.

During the Hearing, Respondent asserted that re-attribution “is an entirely appropriate
application of the ‘substance over form’ anti-abuse doctrine.’ Respondent referred to what it
called “pre-December 30, 2003 cases” (Bashkirian refineries case (2003-2005); Lukoil (2002)
and VAT cases) as well as what it called “post-Yukos authorities” (Korus-Holding (2005-2006),
MIAN (2007-2008) and Syktyvkarsky Milk Factory (2008-2009)).*”

However, Mr. Konnov, when asked a specific question by the Chairman of the Tribunal, had
great difficulty in explaining the existence of a pre-Yukos precedent for the re-attribution that
was imposed on Yukos with the assessments. Claimants recall this incident in their

Post-Hearing Brief in the following words:

First, as the Tribunal will recall, when asked point blank by the President to identify a
precedent for reattribution, Mr. Konnov was unable to do so. The next day Mr. Konnov
sought to “correct” this answer by referring to cases involving the “Bashkirian oil
refineries” and a Lukoil assessment that never went to court. However, Mr. Konnov then
corrected the correction by noting, with respect to the Bashkirian cases, that “the court
decisions . . . are not particularly helpful because the lower court decided in favour of the
taxpayer, and only in 2005 the court decided in favour of the tax authorities.”®

620. Having reviewed the decisions cited by Respondent, the Tribunal concludes that none of them

is truly apposite to Respondent’s argument:

(1) the “Bashkirian refineries case”: in this case (cases, actually), the tax authorities did “re-
attribute” sales revenue from a Baikonur entity to the three selling oil refineries, and they
did so by assessments dated 16 July 2003. However, these assessments were overturned,
in each of the three cases, by the first instance arbitrazh court in November 2003, and the
tax authorities’ appeals in early 2004 were initially unsuccessful. It was only in 2005 that
the Supreme Arbitrazh Court overturned the lower court decisions, and upheld the July
2003 assessments (Exhibits R-1488, 1489, and 1490). Thus, this case cannot serve as a

pre-Yukos precedent.

(2) the “Lukoil case”: this case involved the invalidation of a lease between OAO Lukoil-
Ukhtaneftepererabotka and a Baikonur shell, and the resulting claim against the former for
taxes. While the court decisions (first instance, appellate and cassation levels) all date back
to 2002, they do not show that the taxes of the Lukoil entity were “re-attributed” to Lukoil.
In the view of the Tribunal, therefore, this case does not support Respondent’s re-

attribution theory.

(3) the “VAT cases”: Respondent argues that “[b]oth before and after the Yukos assessments,
the Russian tax authorities routinely assessed VAT on purchasers with respect to revenues
representing value that had been added by their suppliers, rather than the purchasers
themselves.”*°' Respondent points to one pre-Yukos example in the record, a decision that
dates from 22 September 2003 (Exhibit R-3372). On the Tribunal’s reading of this

decision, it is difficult to make out the re-attribution from seller to purchaser, since the

Claimant’s Post-Hearing Brief, § 38 (citing Transcript, Day 14 at 221-23 (Mr. Konnov) (“I don’t think I can give you
any reference to the pre-Yukos precedent where attribution was applied in an identical way.”); Transcript, Day 15
at 83-84 (Mr. Konnov); Transcript, Day 15 at 215 (Mr. Konnov)). Claimants cite their Reply § 233 to note that:
“Moreover, these alleged precedents involved alleged evasion of excise taxes rather than alleged abuses of profit tax
incentives, and were decided on entirely different legal grounds).” Ibid. n.85.

654

Court’s attention is quite definitely on the purchaser in its analysis of the transaction. In

any event, it is not a situation which is at all analogous to the Yukos case.

By contrast, the Korus-Holding case appears to be on all fours with the Yukos case, in terms of
the re-attribution remedy, but it was decided in 2006, well after the assessments against Yukos

in 2003 and 2004.

The Tribunal notes another factor that supports Claimants’ position, namely the contrast
between the first and second decisions involving Investproekt. In the first decision, dated
2 April 2002,°* the tax authorities refused to impose any tax liability on Investproekt for the
past tax offenses of Business-Oil, Vald-Oil, Forest-Oil and Mitra. In the second decision, dated
8 August 2003,°* Investproekt was held liable for those offenses. The Tribunal observes that

the basis for reversing, in August 2003, the earlier decision of April 2002, was not explained in

"1

the August 2003 decision,° and the latter decision followed soon after the arrest of

Mr. Lebedev on 2 July 2003. Moreover, neither of these earlier assessments purported to re-
attribute the tax burden to Yukos, but rather to the successor entity of the trading companies—

Investproekt.

Regarding the transfer-pricing provisions of the Russian Tax Code as a proposed alternative
remedy for whatever mischief is connected to the use of the Yukos trading entities, Respondent

in its Rejoinder argues:

701. Claimants suggest that the “proper course of action” for the authorities “would have
been to pursue” Yukos’ trading shells as opposed to Yukos. But the tax authorities looked
to the economic substance and concluded that Yukos was the real taxpayer. That was both
legally proper and practically sensible. As illustrated by the authorities’ inability to collect
unpaid taxes from the Lesnoy trading shells, Yukos deliberately engineered its scheme so
that its trading shells, if they were ever audited and reassessed, would have no assets with
which to pay any such assessment, with the result that Yukos’ fraudulent scheme would
have enjoyed de facto impunity. Yukos was at all times the real party in interest in the
challenged transactions. It was thus entirely appropriate for the tax authorities to pursue
their claims against it, instead of the trading shells it had created to evade taxes.

702. Equally unavailing is Claimants’ reliance on Article 40 of the Tax Code. The
Yukos “tax optimization” scheme was not an ordinary “transfer pricing” scheme, but rather
a tax evasion scheme involving the abusive exploitation of the low-tax region program
through dozens of sham entities which had no genuine business operations. It was
therefore entirely appropriate for the authorities to challenge that scheme by reference to
anti-abuse rules, rather than the transfer pricing rules set forth in Article 40, insofar as

625.

Yukos had deliberately constructed its tax evasion scheme so as to circumvent the
application of Article 40, including by (a) using chains of shells which increased the
likelihood that, if audited, each link in the chain could avoid an assessment under the 20%
“safe harbor,” and (b) owning most of the trading shells through call options, offshore
companies, and other devices, which would make it more difficult for the authorities to
establish an “interdependence” within the technical meaning of Article 40 between Yukos
and its trading shells.°°*

 

During the Hearing, Respondent argued that the “substance over form” doctrine would be
illusory if re-attribution were precluded, since it would permit tax evasion with impunity as the
taxpayer could simply cause the relevant income or revenues to be recorded, on paper, in the
books of a judgment proof domestic affiliate or a foreign affiliate that was solvent but
territorially beyond the reach of any enforcement measure.*° Respondent also referred to other
jurisdictions where a “general anti-avoidance provision” allows the tax authorities to allocate
“any income” to “any person” in connection with “an avoidance transaction”.°”

The Tribunal sees some merit, in principle, to Respondent’s argument that the “anti-abuse”
doctrine would be eviscerated if the tax authorities were unable to attribute income to the
person responsible for the wrongdoing. The Tribunal also notes with interest Respondent’s
reference to the anti-avoidance provisions of other countries, such as the United States, France,
Germany, Canada and Australia, which grant the taxation authorities similar powers, as well as

to some decisions from other jurisdictions.°* In the Russian context, however, it is clear to the

Rejoinder J 701-702 (citing 9599, 597-600 of Rejoinder; Second Konnov Report §§ 19, 24-25 and 63).
Respondent also notes: “This also confirms the lack of merit in Claimants’ contention that Respondent’s “multiple
allegations about non-arm’s length pricing [...] contradict” Respondent’s “concession that Yukos’ alleged tax
liabilities [are] not premised on any violation of transfer pricing rules” [citing Reply 214]. In reality, there is no such
contradiction, because it is well-settled in Russian tax law that the transfer pricing rules set forth in Article 40 of the
Tax Code are not the exclusive remedy available to the Ri in tax authorities to combat abusive tax practices based
on price manipulations (see First Konnov Report §] 40-44). In other countries too, the general view is that the
existence of specific statutory anti-avoidance rules does not prevent the authorities from deploying their anti-abuse
arsenal, including general anti-avoidance rules, whether enacted by statute (as is the case, for instance, in Germany) or
developed by the judiciary (as is the case, for instance, in the United States) .. . .

   

 

 

 

      

 

 

In the Yukos case, the authorities’ reliance on alternative theories of liability was not only proper but particularly
appropriate, because the Yukos tax evasion scheme was deliberately engineered so that Yukos, through its trading
shells, could circumvent the transfer pricing rules, which require an under- or over-statement of prices of more than
20 percent of the market price. Yukos evaded those rules by running inventories through chains of multiple trading
shells in a series of nominally independent transactions, none of which individually exceeded the 20 percent threshold.
See Protocol of Witness Interrogation of Vladislav P. Brazhkov (15 February 2008), 4, 6 (Exh. R-3370).” bid. n.1098

 

 

   

Respondent further notes: “Yukos’ internal communications confirm that it was a “headache” for Yukos’ employees
to ensure that the transactions among the trading shells were structured to prevent detection of the scheme by the tax
authorities. [citing Counter-Memorial {304 and e-mail from A.V. Brazhkov to A.P Kuchusheva, 9 October 2001,

Tribunal that there was no precedent for re-attribution at the time that the tax assessments and

related decisions were issued in respect of Yukos.

Moreover, the Tribunal could have been persuaded to accept Respondent’s argument if the tax
authorities had only imposed revenue-based taxes against Yukos on the basis of re-attribution.
However, and as already noted, the tax authorities attributed to Yukos the trading companies’
revenues while, at the same time, refusing to attribute to Yukos the trading companies’ VAT
refunds and it did so for purely technical reasons. This leads the Tribunal to the conclusion that
the authorities used the “re-attribution” formula not only so as to be able to collect the
revenue-based taxes, but also so as to establish a basis for imposing the massive VAT liability

and excessive fines that followed.

In short, the Tribunal accepts the following conclusion, as expressed in paragraph 41 of

Claimants’ Post-Hearing Brief:

The obvious explanation for the Respondent’s use of a novel and arbitrary re-attribution
theory rather than correctly applying existing law on interdependence and transfer pricing
is that this was not a bona fide exercise of taxation powers; instead, the novel re-attribution
theory provided a pretext to impose US$ 13.59 billion in VAT claims that, as Mr. Konnov
confirmed, could not have been made in the absence of the unprecedented re-attribution of

revenues.°?

 

iv. Did the Russian Federation Violate Due Process?

Claimants submit that the Russian Federation violated due process by (a) ensuring that the
courts were obedient and did not question the legality of the tax assessments; (b) ensuring that
Yukos could not present its case; and (c) ensuring that neither the trading companies nor the

Mordovian authorities could participate in the proceedings.

Regarding the legality and legitimacy of the tax assessments which Claimants say the courts
should have scrutinized, the Tribunal recalls its finding in Chapter VIII.A that, during the
period relevant for the tax assessments against Yukos (2003-2004), the “bad faith taxpayer”

doctrine included the following principles:

© The good faith (honesty) of the taxpayer is presumed.

© The tax authorities have the burden to prove the taxpayer’s bad faith (dishonesty), and
in doing so “may not construe the concept of ‘good faith taxpayers’ as imposing on the
taxpayer additional obligations which are not provided for in the legislation.”

661

In the view of the Tribunal, questions can be asked about whether the tax assessments disclose
a record establishing that the tax authorities discharged their burden of proving Yukos’ bad
faith in respect of all the trading entities said to be an integral part of its tax evasion scheme.
Some of these questions were raised by Yukos’ tax lawyers immediately after the 2000 tax

assessment was issued. They commented:

The act of inspection of OAO NK YUKOS contains the amounts of revenues of each
company however it is absolutely unclear what control actions produced this information
and what documents confirm it, ete."

This question was developed in the Objections against the tax assessment filed by Yukos on
12 January 2004. Under objection no. 6 (“Breach of the procedure for conducting an audit”),

Yukos complained that the auditors referred to materials from the criminal case, but did not
indicate “what specific documents of the criminal case confirm the fault of the taxpayer.”°*

Yukos’ detailed objection continued:

Attention should also be paid to the failure to analyze and indicate taxation objects on
additionally assessed taxes for all re-assessments under 17 companies. Furthermore, audit
materials do not contain any source documents (waybills, statements, commercial invoices,
etc.) and does not contain contracts for sale and purchase of goods and information about
payment for goods. At the same time the auditors concentrated only on the matter of
unlawfulness of tax benefits' application, although does not review at all the basic matter
that shall be proved in the course of tax audit - the value of taxation objects of these
17 companies. It should be mentioned that it is impossible to state the fact of non-payment
of taxes without analysis of business operations and economic results obtained thereunder
(revenues, profits). However, the auditors do not bother themselves with study of business
operations, under which billions of Rubles are imputed to OAO NK YUKOS for payment.

 

This directly contradict to Article 100 of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, which
indicates that the Audit Report must contain information about tax offense confirmed by
the documents and Instruction of the Ministry of Taxes and Levies the Russian Federation
No. 60 of 10.04.2000 “On Procedure for Compilation of Field Tax Audit Report and
Proceedings in the Case of Violation of the Legislation on Taxes and Levies”, according to
which the Audit Report must contain references to source accounting documents (with
indication, in case of necessity, according transactions and order for reflection the
respective operations in the accounting registers) and other evidences confirming the fact
of violation. The Instruction also stipulates that the Report must be based on results of
audit of all documents that may be related to the stated facts, and on results of performance
of all other actions necessary for exercising tax control.

According to this Instruction, the following must be attached to the Audit Report:

* clarified calculations by types of taxes (levies) drawn up by the auditors in connection
with the discovered tax offence (except for the cases when the specified calculations
are presented in the body text of the report). Calculations must be signed by the

auditor (the auditors), the head of the company or private entrepreneur or their
representatives; and

+ materials of cross audits (in case these were performed).

However, these requirements are not met and source documents and tax returns of 17
companies mentioned in the Report are not attached to the Report, which virtually deprives
OAO NK YUKOS of opportunity to assess accusations of tax offence brought against it.

It is also necessary to mention that in violation of the requirements of the abovementioned
Instruction about fairness and reasonableness of the reflected facts, the Audit Report was
written in obviously biased manner, with accusative tendency and starts with conclusions
on presence of a certain tax evasion “scheme”. The obvious prejudice of the auditors does
not allow to consider the Audit Report as the evidence of committed tax offence.°

The Tribunal notes that Article 100(2) of the Russian Tax Code requires a tax audit to contain
99663

“documentarily attested references to facts of tax offenses revealed during the audit .
The Russian Tax Code also requires the Director of the Tax Authority to consider the
taxpayer’s objections prior to issuing a decision (which may hold, or not hold, the taxpayer

liable for a tax offense, or direct further tax control measures).° Article 101(3) provides:

3. The decision to hold the taxpayer liable for a tax offense shall indicate the
circumstances of the committed tax offence, how they were established by the audit, the
documents and other evidence, which attest to these circumstances, arguments presented
by the taxpayer for his defense and the results of their verification, the decision to hold the
taxpayer for specific tax offenses with a reference to the articles of this Code providing for
such tax offenses and liability incurred.°
The 2000 Decision summarizes Yukos’ objections, but selectively so. Notably, Yukos’ specific
objection regarding the tax authorities’ failure to document the facts allegedly underpinning the
conclusions in the tax audit is omitted from the description in the Decision of Yukos’ objection
no. 6.%° Moreover, while the decision contains responses or comments regarding some of

Yukos’ other objections, it does not contain any response to this specific objection.°””

The court decisions that affirmed the legality of the decision, both in first instance and on
appeal, used similar wording to dismiss Yukos’ objection based on breach of procedure for

Results of the audit and the Decision were formalized in compliance with requirements of
Articles 100 and 101 of the Russian Federation Tax Code. The Decision indicates its
subject, essence and features of the tax offense imputed to the taxpayer, with reference to
Article 122(3) of the Russian Federation Tax Code. Demand for the payment of tax
arrears, interest and fines indicated in the Decision of the Russian Federation Ministry of
Taxes and Levies No. 14-3-05/1609-1 of 14.04.2004 are well-founded, comply with the
current legislation and are supported by the primary documents of audit materials,
presented by the Russian Federation Ministry of Taxes and levies to the Court for
substantiation of its claim.°*

The Ninth Arbitrazh Court of Appeal added that “[Yukos’] reference to a lack of documents
and information confirming bad faith on the part of the taxpayer is unfounded.” The
Tribunal observes, however, that neither court identifies any specific documents in coming to
these conclusions; nor did Respondent submit to the Tribunal the record that was before those
courts, or present a witness who could attest to it. This makes it impossible for the Tribunal to
assess whether the tax authorities did indeed discharge their burden against Yukos in issuing

and defending their tax assessments.

Claimants sum up their argument on this important point in their Post-Hearing Brief with the
following submission. The Tribunal notes that these crucial allegations of Claimants were

never rebutted by Respondent:

In addition, the December 29, 2003 Audit Report did not comply with the requirements of
the Russian Tax Code, including, in particular, by failing to document the factual
allegations made and by relying on unidentified and undisclosed documents from the
criminal investigation against Mr. Khodorkovsky. Continuing this flagrant breach of due
process, the tax authorities refused to allow Yukos access to the documents upon which the
purported claims were based, making it impossible for Yukos to defend itself.
Notwithstanding the fact that the results of the court cases were determined in the Kremlin
and it therefore could not possibly have made any difference how Yukos presented its
defense, this refusal even to subject the purported claims to the scrutiny of Yukos’ lawyers
attests to the Russian authorities’ complete lack of belief in the validity of those claims and
their determination to destroy the company at a rapid pace.”

substantial amount of evidence that suggests that Yukos was abusing at least some of the low

tax regions prior to 2003.°"!

However, the Tribunal observes that nearly all of the evidence on this point relates to the
entities in Lesnoy and Trekhgorny. The Tribunal has not found any evidence in the massive
record that would support Respondent’s submission that there was a basis for the Russian
authorities to conclude that the entities in Mordovia, for example, were “shams”. Indeed,
instead of pointing to any specific evidence on which the tax authorities might have based their
finding that the Mordovian entities were shams, Respondent reversed the burden and asserted
that “there is no evidence that the Mordovian shells ever had any greater substance than the

Lesnoy shells”;°” and that “[fJactually, Yukos did not even attempt to demonstrate that any

genuine trading activities had ever been conducted in Mordovia.”*”

While the incomplete
record before the Tribunal may not, in point of fact, establish that the Mordovian trading
companies conducted genuine trading activities in Mordovia, the Tribunal notes that the
Russian courts systematically denied Yukos’ motions to join to the proceedings its trading
companies and the Government of the Republic of Mordovia. This leads the Tribunal to
conclude that the Russian courts may have prevented Yukos from adducing evidence bearing
on the nature of its activities in Mordovia.*” The record, insofar as the Tribunal has been able
to find, does not reveal reasons, still less persuasive reasons, for denial by the Russian courts of

joinder of the Mordovian government and the trading companies.

In the specific context of determining whether, in relation to the tax assessments against Yukos,
the tax authorities discharged their own burden of proving Yukos’ bad faith so as to be able to
rely on the “bad-faith taxpayer” doctrine, the Tribunal makes two observations. Firstly, the tax
authorities failed to address at the time of the 2000 Decision, Yukos’ reasoned objection based
on the absence of specific documents in the tax audit. Secondly, Respondent failed to identify
during the Hearing any satisfactory evidence that the abuses found in the trading firms
operating in Lesnoy and Trekhgorny were also found in the trading companies operating in
Mordovia and all the other low-tax regions where Yukos entities were present. While it is true,

and suggestive, that Claimants did not introduce evidence at the Hearing showing that trading

companies which operated in Mordovia were not “shams”, it is first and foremost the conduct
of the tax authorities that the Tribunal must examine in the context of the tax assessments that
these authorities imposed on Yukos. Focusing exclusively on Claimants’ failure to demonstrate
that the Mordovian entities were not “shams” would empty of meaning the important principle
that the tax authorities had the burden of proving the taxpayer’s bad faith under Russian law.
On this point, the following extract from the Pribrezhnoye decision issued by the Federal
Arbitrazh Court for the North-Western District on 5 June 2002 (well before the tax assessments

against Yukos) is instructive:

In addition, the IMNS’s reference to the absence of presentation of evidence by the
Company on the conduct of its business in the ZATO territory, which was supported by the
court, is erroneous.

Pursuant to Article 53 (part one) of the Arbitrazh Procedure Code of the Russian
Federation in considering disputes on the invalidity of acts of State authorities, local self-
government authorities and other authorities; it is up to the relevant authority to prove the
circumstances, which provided the grounds for issuing the said acts. Due to the fact that
the disputed tax benefit had been granted to the defendant by a competent ZATO authority,
and that the IMNS issuing the challenged non-regulatory decision found the granting of the
benefit unlawful, the courts erroneously imposed the burden of proof on the Company.’
[emphasis added]
Looking at the tax assessments themselves, the Tribunal observes that, if there is an “unbroken
thread” running through the tax authorities’ analysis of Yukos’ tax optimization scheme, it is
the consistent and uniform finding that each trading entity is “interdependent” with Yukos. But
that interdependence in the view of the Tribunal of itself does not establish bad faith on the part

of all the trading entities.

In its objections to the Tax Audit (objection No. 1: “Illegal conclusions concerning legal
definition of interdependent persons”), Yukos complained about the authorities’ reliance on
interdependence as the principal factor motivating their conclusion that Yukos’ tax
optimization scheme was a tax evasion scheme, noting that interdependence has a specific
meaning under the Russian Tax Code (in Article 20), and with strictly determined legal
consequences (under Article 40).°° These provisions allow authorities to disregard prices used
in transactions between interdependent persons when those prices deviate by more than

20 percent from the market price, and to assess additional taxes and interest calculated as if the

transactions were concluded at the market price. Again, the Tribunal notes that this objection

was not directly addressed in the 2000 Decision.*”

The Tribunal notes that the relevant audit reports and decisions do refer generally to various
factors that would seem to be relevant to a finding that the legislation in low-tax regions was
being abused by Yukos. For example, they refer to the absence of trading activity in the
regions and the absence of sufficient or even of any investment by the trading entities in the
low tax regions. However, a close analysis of the tax assessment for 2000, for example, reveals
that it was not established by the tax authorities that each of the trading entities which it
labelled as a “sham” had no trading activity whatsoever, as opposed to just being

“interdependent” on Yukos or not having physical facilities to handle oil and oil refining.

The Tribunal agrees with Claimants (and apparently also with Mr. Konnov) that it is nonsense
to require a trading company to demonstrate physical interaction with the goods or
commodities that it is trading, especially in the era of electronic communications. In this sense,
the Tribunal is highly skeptical of the reasoning in the 2000 Audit Report (and subsequent
reports) that the absence of physical movement of oil in and out of the low-tax region where the
respective trading entity is located is evidence of a sham. The Tribunal observes that the
reasoning on this point in the 2000 Audit Report is also inconsistent with the decision in the

Pribrezhnoye case.

In that case, the Federal Arbitrazh Court for the North-Western District reversed decisions of
lower courts that had accepted the tax authorities’ efforts to impose additional eligibility
requirements on a ZATO-based oil trading company beyond those laid out in the ZATO law. It
explicitly noted that:

Under these circumstances the examination of whether the Company had fixed assets for
oil products storage and transportation in the ZATO territory is beyond the scope of this
case, because operations of trade in oil products, i.e. conclusion of contracts of sale, do not
require the Company to own such fixed assets or for the oil products to be present within
the ZATO territory.°"

2000 Decision, pp. 87-90, Exh, C-104. There is also only a minor reference to the objection in the Decision of the
Moscow Arbitrazh Court, No. A40-17669/04-109-241, 26 May 2004, p. 19, Exh. C-116. (“The court considers
unfounded the Respondent: arguments that the status of interdependent entities has legal importance solely for the
possibility of applying market prices to determine the results of the transactions for tax purpos Interdependence of
entities in this case is one of the circumstances by which the tax authority substantiates bad faith of the taxpayer.”).

on

The court added

The references by the courts to the facts that transfer and acceptance of crude oil occurred
outside the ZATO territory; that [the manager of a customer company was in a different
ZATO when the transfer was signed]; that the phone numbers of the rented office premises
are recorded to the name of a person other than the Company; and that the defendant had
not paid the office electricity bills are equally unfounded. The said circumstances per se
do not refute the fact that the Company was doing business as a trade company in the

territory of the ZATO, and they have no relevance for the case because they are not taken
into account by tax legislation in determining eligibility for tax benefits.

The examination of the said circumstances by the first instance court and the court of
appeal reveals their misinterpretation of Article 5(1) of the ZATO Law, in that the court
went beyond the eligibility criteria for tax benefits that are explicitly set forth in this
provision. In violation of Article 3(7) of the TC, the first instance court and the court of
appeal regarded the absence of any criteria on doing business in ZATO territory other than
fixed assets, workers on payroll and salary payments as grounds for the independent
establishment of such criteria by a tax authority or a court.°”

[emphasis added]
Finally, the Tribunal agrees with Claimants that the criterion of “proportionality” seems to be
difficult to apply as a stand-alone basis to invalidate the structure in the low-tax regions. This
is due to the fact that the proportion between the tax savings and the investment in the low-tax
region should have been readily apparent to the tax authorities on the face of the tax filings and
related tax documents. On the other hand, where properly evidenced, a grossly
disproportionate arrangement combined with an “empty shell” structure could, in the Tribunal’s

view, validly attract the attention of the authorities under the “anti-abuse” doctrine.

To conclude, it thus appears to the Tribunal that the Tax Ministry, in its assessments against
Yukos, painted all of the Yukos’ entities in the low tax regions with the same brush, even
though it marshalled little, if any, documented evidence that all, and not only some, of the
trading entities were abusing the low tax regime in which they had respectively been
constituted. On the one hand, the Tribunal accepts that, if Claimants had evidence of genuine
business activity of the trading companies in the low-tax regions, they would have introduced it
or referred to it orally. Accordingly, resolution of these critical issues is not free from doubt.
But on the other hand, and on balance, where neither side was able to demonstrate the facts, but
where Yukos’ files were in the hands of Respondent, the Tribunal feels justified in holding
Respondent bound by the burden of proof. Respondent failed to meet that burden. Moreover,
it refused to join Mordovian authorities and the trading companies to the litigation.

Furthermore, the re-attribution remedy was unprecedented at that time in the Russian

Federation. Respondent’s resort to re-attribution appears to be linked to its determination to

impose a massive VAT liability on Yukos.

(b) VAT

i. Introduction

Claimants argue that the imposition of VAT by the tax authorities, and more specifically their
refusal to attribute to Yukos the trading companies’ VAT returns and refunds, is arbitrary
because (a) it is undisputed that the goods at issue in the underlying transactions were exported
and that the trading entities timely and duly filed VAT returns (and thus that the transactions
benefited from the exemption from VAT or zero percent rating, depending on the year);°*
(b) the refusal to attribute the trading companies’ VAT returns and refunds to Yukos is
inconsistent with Respondent’s attribution to Yukos of the trading companies’ revenues for
purposes of calculation of tax (be it profit tax or VAT or any of the other taxes); and (c) Yukos”
refilings of VAT returns were rejected on the basis of technicalities, thus demonstrating that

Respondent had no intention of treating Yukos in good faith.°"'

Respondent takes the position that the VAT assessments against Yukos were perfectly proper,
and consistent with the corporate profit tax assessments. In both cases, Respondent argues, the
assessments were based on the application of Russian tax law to the true situation, established
by the tax authorities, that Yukos was the “real taxpayer” and “actual exporter” in the various
transactions that the trading companies had entered into. Respondent’s position is also based on
its assertions that under Russian law, the granting of a zero percent VAT rate is subject to
compliance with stringent documentary requirements; and that it is undisputed that Yukos itself
never filed regular VAT returns or proper amended VAT returns in relation to the transactions

in question.**”

The Tribunal observes that there was no element in Yukos’ tax scheme that enabled Yukos to

benefit improperly or illegally from a VAT exemption or a zero percent rating. As noted earlier

See Second Konnov Report {| 84, 0.137. Mr. Konnov explains: “Prior to entry into force on January 1, 2001 of
Chapter 21 of the Russian Tax Code governing VAT, VAT was governed by Law of the Russian Federation
No. 1992-1, On the Value Added Tax, December 6, 1991 (the ‘VAT Law’). Under the terminology of the VAT Law,
exports were ‘exempt’ from VAT whilst under the Russian Tax Code they are subject to 0% VAT rate. In substance,
exemption from VAT on exports was similar to the 0% tax regime.” [bid.

in this Award, VAT is a uniform federal tax that benefits from an exemption or a zero percent
rating if the transaction involves an export to a foreign purchaser. In other words, even if
Yukos’ tax scheme was entirely unlawful (or unlawful in some respects), and the authorities
were justified in attributing the trading companies’ revenues to Yukos for tax purposes, there is
no suggestion by Respondent that the trading companies (or Yukos) did anything “wrong” vis-
a-vis VAT with their tax scheme. The Tribunal must consider the propriety of the multibillion

dollar VAT assessments against Yukos in this context.

The Tribunal addresses the specific questions arising on the topic of the VAT assessments in

the following subsections.

ii, | Was the Imposition of VAT Payments on Yukos Inconsistent with
the Attribution to Yukos of the Trading Companies’ Revenues?

Claimants assert that when the Russian Tax Ministry reattributed to Yukos all of the revenues
(including the export revenues) of its trading companies, it should have attributed to Yukos the
VAT refunds previously obtained by the trading companies with respect to their exports.
Instead, in what Claimants characterize as a “contradiction with its own theory,” the Tax
Ministry chose to impose the amounts on Yukos, justifying the VAT payment demands on the
failure by Yukos, as the “real taxpayer”, to file on time “the documentation required to validate

the VAT exemption or the 0% VAT rate”.
Claimants sum up their argument in their Memorial as follows:

This formalistic position, systematically challenged by Yukos before the arbitrazh courts,
but endorsed without any thorough analysis by these courts, was obviously circular: the
trading companies, not Yukos, had exported oil and oil products and filed all the necessary
documentation; under the applicable laws, Yukos did not have to file and could not have
filed such documentation at the relevant times. The fact that, even when Yukos attempted
to submit the updated VAT returns in its own name to satisfy the Tax Ministry, its
submissions were simply rejected as improper and untimely, amply shows the Tax
Ministry’s bad faith and true intentions.

In its Counter-Memorial, Respondent asserts that the tax authorities were justified to treat
Yukos itself as the real party in interest, “which for VAT purposes, meant treating it as the real
exporter. This approach simply reflected reality.”“* As such, Respondent argues, Yukos could
have benefited from exemption (or “zero-rating”) only if, as “the true exporter”, it had timely
filed “the requisite documentation in the correct manner.”***

Claimants reaffirm their position in their Reply, stating that Respondent’s position on VAT
“was wholly inconsistent with the entire re-attribution theory upon which all of the other

d.”°? In short, Claimants argue that “it was arbitrary and

purported tax claims were premise
contradictory for the authorities to re-attribute the trading companies’ oil, revenues, profits, tax
liabilities and activities to Yukos but to refuse to re-attribute to Yukos those companies’
entitlement to VAT refunds,“

More specifically, Claimants note that “there is no support in Russian law for the tax authorities
to conclude that the ‘true exporter’ could be someone other than the legal owner as reflected in
the relevant documentation.” In particular, Claimants assert that neither Article 165 of the

690

Russian Tax Code nor the decision of the Constitutional Court’ affirming the constitutionality

of Article 165, on which Respondent relies, say anything about “true exporters”.°”

The Tribunal notes that, in audit reports and decisions prior to the reassessments in December
2003, there are frequent references to the trading companies’ use of export agents. For
example, in Decision No. 23 in respect of Alta-Trade, the decision notes that “Oil products are
being exported through commission agent OAO NK Yukos and ZAO Trading House

The Tribunal also notes that, in these audits, the taxation authorities did not appear to be

concerned with these relationships. Several other audit reports and decisions also mention the

use of export agents.“

In its Rejoinder, Respondent maintains its position regarding the propriety of the VAT
assessments and their consistency with the profit tax assessments against Yukos. Respondent
explains why Claimants are wrong, in its view, for characterizing the VAT assessments as

being arbitrary and contradictory:

Once again, Claimants are wrong. The authorities’ approach with respect to Yukos’ VAT
liability was consistent with their approach to Yukos’ corporate profit tax liability. In both
instances, they treated Yukos as the actual owner and exporter of the oil and oil products,
and therefore the actual entity responsible for both profit tax and VAT. Thus, the
authorities found that:

(i) Yukos was the real party in interest in the challenged transactions.

(ii) The profit generated through those transactions was Yukos’ own profit, which
Yukos had fictitiously allocated to the trading shells for no purpose other than to
evade taxes which it otherwise was obligated to pay.

(iii) Yukos, not its trading shells, was the real exporter of the oil and oil products that
were the subject matter of those transactions.

The inescapable conclusion from these findings is that Yukos, not its trading shells, should
have filed the requisite documents to claim a 0% VAT rate, which as discussed below
Yukos did not do properly. The VAT was thus due from Yukos and the Yukos VAT
assessments were proper.“

 

Claimants sum up their position in their Post Hearing Brief:

I may disagree with you on some aspects of that, but I’m not reopening that. I am
just talking about VAT.

If the tax authorities had decided that the trading companies themselves had
violated, say, the Mordovian Law, or the Law which is applicable to them, or the
Federal Anti-Abuse Law, or whatever Law, but they have violated that Law; and if
the tax authorities had said, “Okay, they abused, so all these tax benefits which they
had, they should never have had these benefits, because there is no proportionality,
because it’s form over substance”, whatever reason, “So they should pay, they
should reimburse all these benefits”, and possibly pay interest, fines, whatever --
okay? -- if that had been the case, would the VAT issue have arisen at all?

No.
You are with me on that?
Yes.

So it would not. And the VAT issue arises only because it’s Yukos which has been
deemed to be the person having the revenues, and hence not having declared those
revenues, and hence not having paid the VAT corresponding to the sales which
generated those revenues; correct?

To be more specific, the VAT issue arises because VAT returns were not refiled.
No, because they were not filed in the first place, right?

No, because they were not refiled by Yukos. So the basis is not attribution; the
basis is failure to file VAT returns.

found by the tax authorities to be the true exporter:

PROFESSOR GAILLARD: Okay, the next question is: is it your understanding of what
happened that when the VAT issue did arise for Yukos, because Yukos was deemed to be
the person having received the revenues from the sales, when it did arise, is it your
understanding of the case that the reason why they had to pay this massive amount of VAT
is from the outset because they were criticised for not having submitted themselves the tax
returns in time? Is that your understanding of what happened?

A.

Right: VAT returns primarily, and the documents that need to be attached to that.
But the main issue relates to the failure of Yukos to file the VAT returns with
respect to these exports.

I thought I had responded to that in my reports. But in essence the Tax Code
requires VAT returns to be filed by the exporter. There is a formalistic procedure.
Tax authorities have historically applied the law very formally. They said that
Yukos had to refile. There is nothing difficult in refiling, and Yukos did not refile.

So therefore the basis for VAT assessment is not failure of Yukos to export, as we
agreed; but the basis is failure of Yukos to file the di ion _in its own

666. However, Mr. Konnov did not perceive any inconsistency between the attribution of revenue to
Yukos and the position of the tax authorities and the courts that Yukos itself needed to file the
VAT returns:

Q. Do we agree that for the revenues themselves, the authorities applied a substance
over form principle? Do we agree on that?

A. The tax authorities applied substance over form for both profits tax and VAT
purposes.””!

667. In his First Report, Mr. Konnov explains his position in the following terms:

At the outset, I should note that the tax authorities and courts were fully consistent in
treating YUKOS for profit tax and VAT purposes. Revenue of the Domestic Offshore
Companies was recognized as revenue of YUKOS for both profit tax and VAT
purposes.”

668. The Tribunal observes that while the approach taken by the Tax Ministry was consistent in the
sense that revenue was recognized as revenue of Yukos for both profit tax and VAT purposes,
it was inconsistent in that, while the burden of the substance over form doctrine was imposed
on Yukos, its corresponding benefit was not. Put another way, while technicalities and
formalism are said to preclude the attribution of the VAT filings of the trading entities to
Yukos, it does not appear that the Tax Ministry was concerned with technicalities and

formalism when it came time to attribute their revenue to Yukos.

669. A member of the Tribunal put the pertinent question to Mr. Konnov. The following exchange

with the witness is important:

JUDGE SCHWEBEL: In substance, Russian courts treated the activities of the trading
companies as the activities of Yukos itself, while at the same time they did not attribute to
Yukos a critical element of those activities, namely their filing for VAT refunds.

In the interests of obvious justice, why did not the Russian courts treat the filings for VAT
by the trading companies as filings by Yukos?

A. If I may, I see two aspects in your question. First, I do not think that Russian tax
authorities -- as I think was suggested in your question -- treated the activities of
trading companies as the activities of Yukos. I think it would be more correct, if I
may, to say that they established that trading companies conducted no activity, and
therefore they simply ignored that for tax purposes.

As regards ... the substance of your question, the reason is very simple: is that, as I
mentioned, in order to get the tax benefit, you need to comply with the substance
and with the documents. And here the documentary requirement was not
burdensome; it was not difficult to refile the VAT return. The tax authorities did

672.

look at the substance, but simply said, “You need to comply with the documentary
requirement,” and consistently Yukos failed to comply with that.

So I don’t see contradiction.”

Respondent relies on both Article 165 of the Russian Tax Code and Constitutional Court
Resolution No. 12-P. Neither of these texts, however, appears to the Tribunal to provide a clear
basis for the authorities’ refusal to attribute to Yukos the VAT filings that had been made by
the trading entities when they were considered the taxpayer. On the other hand, they do support
the basic proposition that the Russian Tax Code requires the VAT return to be filed by the
“taxpayer.”"™
In the view of the Tribunal, the jurisprudence of the Russian courts does not support the
imposition of VAT payments on Yukos as happened in this case. In particular, the
Energomashbank decision of the Russian Constitutional Court stands for the proposition that
courts must not limit themselves to a purely formalistic analysis in assessing tax claims by the
State, but rather must examine the actual facts in order to respect the taxpayer’s right to a fair

opportunity to defend itself against the claim.”

iii, Would any Illicit Conduct by a Taxpayer Justify the Denial of a
VAT Exemption, Irrespective of Whether the Illicit Conduct was
Connected to VAT, and without any Regard to Proportionality?

In its Counter-Memorial, Respondent raises an additional argument in support of the
authorities’ denial of the VAT exemption to Yukos. Respondent asserts that, in any event, “the
denial of [a] VAT exemption is appropriate when the exporter, like Yukos, has been involved

in flagrantly illicit conduct.””°°

In support of its argument, Respondent relies on what it
characterizes as the practice in many countries to deny “the benefit of exemption or 0% rating,
even where documentary requirements have been punctually satisfied, if the relevant export

transaction is tainted by illegality (as was the case with Yukos) or even simply by

impropriety.""” In particular, Respondent relies on the decision of the ECJ in

R. v. Germany.”
Respondent summarizes the R. v. Germany decision as follows in its Counter-Memorial:

More recently, the European Court of Justice, in the case of R. v. Germany,upheld the
imposition of VAT by the German tax authorities on export transactions that had been
carried out by an individual who had made fraudulent misrepresentations in his
applications for exemption from German VAT, notwithstanding the fact that the fraud had
not deprived Germany of any tax revenues, since the goods in question had effectively
been exported out of Germany and therefore—but for the fraud in the attendant

Id have been bly entitled to full from German
VAT. The ECJ rejected the argument that imposition of VAT on the exporter would
violate “principles of fiscal neutrality or legal certainty, or . . . legitimate expectations,”
holding that none of those principles can “legitimately be invoked by a taxable person who
has intentionally participated in tax evasion. . .”. This was true, the court held, even though
the tax evaded was not one that the taxpayer himself would normally have had to pay, and
even though the result was that Germany ended up with a windfall, collecting a tax that, in
the absence of fraud, it would never have been able to assess.”

 

In their Reply, Claimants contend that this decision is of no assistance to Respondent, because
it “does not suggest that the tax authorities may deny VAT exemptions because of allegations
of illegality unrelated to actual compliance with the VAT law.””"” Indeed, contrary to the R. v.

Germany decision (in which, Claimants assert, the ECJ expressly rejected a punitive approach),

 

Claimants argue that the “staggering d ds for VAT pay plus fines and interest:

made by the Tax Ministry constitute an entirely disproportionate response to the alleged

Counter-Memorial § 1208 (citing R. v. Germany 22). Respondent notes: “In fact, as made clear by the ECJ, the
German taxpayer had not himself evaded any tax for which he might have been liable, because the sole purpose and
effect of his fraudulent conduct had been to assist unrelated third parties—his foreign customers—to evade taxes in
their home country of Portugal.” /bid. n.1878.

Respondent adds further: “The ECJ stated that “[t]hose principles cannot legitimately be invoked by a taxable person
who has intentionally participated in tax evasion and who has jeopardized the operation of the common system on
VAT”. Ibid. 154. The ECJ also summarily dismissed the argument that imposition of VAT on an exporter (who, as
had been pointed out by the Advocate General, would probably never be able to recover it from his customer) would
violate the general EU principle « of proportionality. The court held that the exporter’s involvement in the third party’s
tax evasion scheme was “decisive” in this regard. Specifically the court stated that “[a]s regards the principle of
proportionality, it must be observed that this does not preclude a supplier who participates in tax evasion from being
obliged to pay VAT subsequently on this intra-community supply, inasmuch as his involvement in the ev:

defects in the paperwork submitted by Yukos, and are evidence of “the tax authorities’ manifest

bad faith on this issue.”

According to Respondent, however, the decision is directly applicable to the present case
because, in that case, the ECJ held “that it is entirely appropriate for a State to deny VAT
refunds (or exemptions) to an exporting company whose conduct, like Yukos’, involves

‘evasion, avoidance or abuse,’ even though the scheme did not deprive that State of any VAT

e713

or other revenues. Respondent asserts that Claimants’ attempt to distinguish the R. v.

Germany decision on the grounds that, in that case, the scheme involved an attempt to evade
VAT charges, whereas Yukos’ fraud was designed to evade a tax on profits, is “sophistic.””"*

Respondent explains:

What makes the European Court of Justice’s decision relevant to these arbitrations is its
holding that, because the export transactions in that case were part of an abusive scheme,
Germany was entitled to levy VAT on those exports, notwithstanding the fact that no
German tax (of any kind) had been evaded. Reasoning by analogy, Russia’s VAT
assessments against Yukos were appropriate a fortiori, since Yukos’ fraudulent scheme—
unlike the one in R v. Germany—most assuredly involved a revenue loss for Russia, to wit,
the loss of huge amounts of corporate profit tax that the Yukos tax evasion scheme was
engineered to evade.”'*

  

In its Post-Hearing Brief, Respondent again invokes the ECJ’s decision in R. v. Germany.”'*
Claimants, in their own Post-Hearing Brief, reiterated that “Yukos’ tax optimization structure
was not aimed at, and indeed could not possibly achieve, any reduction in VAT liabilities.””!”

Claimants conclude that this decision is of no assistance to the Tribunal.

The Tribunal is not persuaded that the Russian Federation’s imposition of massive VAT
liabilities on Yukos can be excused or justified on the basis of the R. v. Germany decision.
Firstly, no element of Yukos’ tax optimization scheme could be said to constitute an abuse of
the VAT system. In the R. v. Germany case, however, the taxpayer who was denied the VAT
exemption was convicted on two counts of tax evasion by means of which he had evaded more
that €1 million of VAT in 2002 and more than €1.5 million of VAT in 2003. Secondly, the

Tribunal considers the imposition of VAT on Yukos to be a disproportionate response to

whatever abuse took place in the low-tax regions, considering that the tax authorities had
already imposed all of the revenue-based taxes deemed to be owed by the trading entities on

Yukos. In the R. v. Germany decision, the ECJ reminded Member States that they

must observe the general principles of law that form part of the European Union legal
order, which include, in particular, the principles of legal certainty and proportionality and
the principle of protection of legitimate expectations (see, to that effect, Joined Cases C-
286/94, C-340/95, C-401/95 and C-47/96 Molenheide and Others [1977] ECR 1-7281,
paragraph 48; Case C-384/04 Federation of Technological Industries and others [2006]
ECR 1-4191, paragraphs 29 and 30; and Case C-271/06 Netto Supermarkt [2008] ECR 1-
771, paragraph 18). As regards, in particular, the principle of proportionality, the Court
has already held that, in accordance with that principle, the measures which the Member
States may thus adopt must not go further than is necessary to attain the objectives of
ensuring the correct levying and collection of the tax and the prevention of tax evasion
(see, in particular, Case C-188/09 Profaktor Kulesza, Frankowski Jézwiak, Orlowski
[2010] ECR 1-0000, paragraph 26).”'*

In the present case, with respect to the denial by the Russian tax authorities of the VAT

exemption to Yukos, the Tribunal finds that the Russian Federation did go much further than

was necessary to attain a legitimate objective of collecting taxes.

Did Yukos Contribute to its Own Demise by Failing to File
Proper VAT documentation, or Does the Evidence Suggest that
Any Efforts by Yukos to Minimize its Liability would have been
Thwarted by the Authorities?

 

In its Counter-Memorial, Respondent also contends that Yukos acted self-destructively in

relation to VAT, in as much as:

(a) Yukos could have avoided further VAT assessments “easily and at no cost, simply by
having Yukos itself (or one of the other genuine companies of the Yukos group)

acknowledge its status as the real exporter and file the requisite documentation itself”.”””

(b) | Yukos, when it belatedly filed amended VAT returns for some prior periods, “submitted
those returns in a format that was incapable of being processed by the authorities’
computer, with the result that, as any tax expert would have predicted, they were

rejected.””””

681.

In relation to the format for filing the VAT returns, Respondent, in its Counter-Memorial,

wrote:

For an unexplained reason, Yukos belatedly filed yearly VAT returns, whereas quarterly or
monthly returns were required. See Konnov Report, 4 58. See Article 163 of the Tax Code,
providing with respect to VAT that “1. Tax period shall be established as a calendar month,
unless otherwise provided by paragraph 2 of this Article (this applies to taxpayers
performing the obligations of tax agents, hereinafter referred to as tax agents), 2. For
taxpayers (tax agents) whose monthly revenues from the sale of goods (works, services)
within a quarter, excluding the tax and sales tax, do not exceed one million rubles, the tax
period shall be established as a quarter.” With effect from Jan. 1, 2004, Article 163 was
amended to read: “1, Tax period shall be established as a calendar month, unless otherwise
provided by paragraph 2 of this Article (this applies to taxpayers performing the
obligations of tax agents, hereinafter referred to as tax agents). 2. For taxpayers (tax
agents) whose monthly revenues from the sale of goods (works, services) within a quarter,
excluding the tax, do not exceed one million rubles, the tax period shall be established as a
quarter.” [Exh. R-1502]. Not surprisingly, the courts have rejected such returns. See,
eg., Decision of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court, Case No. A40-4338/05-107-9/
A40-7780/05-98-90 (Apr. 28, 2005), 59 [Exh. C-196] (“The tax return submitted by OAO
Yukos Oil Company for value added tax for 2003 cannot be considered, since it does not
meet the requirements of tax legislation regarding submission of a VAT tax return for each
tax period, which is a month or quarter”).””"

[emphasis added by Respondent]

For Claimants, the particular format of the VAT filings was just a pretext by the tax authorities
for refusing to credit Yukos for the VAT refunds obtained by the trading companies:

The Respondent accuses Yukos of having “acted self-destructively” by filing yearly VAT
returns instead of quarterly or monthly returns and, by way of support, refers to the
Decision of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court regarding the alleged tax reassessment for the
year 2003. However, the monthly reporting requirement relates solely to the periodicity at
which, in the ordinary course of events, companies are required to file VAT returns. In

i where the d ion was being submitted four years after the fact, it
would have made no sense—and would likely have generated unnecessary additional work
for the tax authorities—to disaggregate the annual information into monthly data.”

Reply § 250. Claimants note that: “The Respondent is unable to make up its mind as to whether the documents needed
to be filed on a monthly or quarterly bi or whether either is permissible, a position whose vagueness cannot be
reconciled with the purported certainty with which it affirms that yearly submissions were improper. [citing

Claimants add further: “The Respondent offers no support for it tion that the returns submitted by Yukos were
“incapable of being processed by the authorities’ computer”, an mplausible on its face, particularly
in light of the Respondent's own uncertainty as to whether monthly or quarterly submissions were required, and was
in any event not relied on as a basis for the original rejection.” Ibid. n.442.

Claimants add in their Reply that “the text of Article 165 of the Russian Tax Code seriously
undermines this pretext in that it imposes no timing restrictions whatsoever in relation to the

submission of the required documentation for obtaining a VAT refund.”””?
Respondent disagrees:

Equally meritless is the allegation that the “monthly reporting requirement relates solely to
the periodicity at which, in the ordinary course of events, companies are required to file
VAT returns” and is not applicable when “the documentation is being submitted four years
after the fact.” Contrary to Claimants’ suggestion, the Russian Tax Code does not
contemplate any exception for non-“ordinary course” filings, and in particular allows no
derogation from the requirement that filings be made on a monthly (or, in cases not
relevant to Yukos, quarterly) basis. Rather, it clearly provides what a taxpayer must file to
claim a 0% VAT rate on exports, and neither Yukos nor any other taxpayer is entitled to
decide for itself whether or not to comply with the law based on “convenience”.”**

In his Second Expert Report, Mr. Konnov refers to the strict formalism of Russian tax
legislation with respect to VAT and cites, in support of the decision of the tax authorities, a

decision of the Russian Supreme Arbitrazh Court issued in 2011:

86. The strict formalism of Russian tax legislation with respect to VAT was recently
confirmed in the Forward VAT case (unrelated to YUKOS) which has reached the Russian
Supreme Arbitrazh Court. Forward was a construction company. In relation to the
construction of a residential building in the city of Bryansk, it was collecting investment
contributions. Forward failed to assess VAT on its remuneration when due. Based on a
field audit, the tax authorities assessed VAT (and profit tax) on Forward. The taxpayer
claimed input VAT credit in court. Neither the amounts of input VAT, nor the payment
made by the suppliers was disputed by the tax authorities. The taxpayer submitted to the
court documents evidencing input VAT, but failed to file an amended VAT return claiming
the respective amounts of input VAT. Even though the amount of the input VAT paid by
the taxpayer was undisputed, the court denied the input VAT credit solely on the basis that
the taxpayer failed to file an amended VAT return.

87. The Supreme Arbitrazh Court concluded that, in accordance with the Russian Tax
Code and the prevailing court practice, input VAT credit had to be claimed by a taxpayer
in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Russian Tax Code, and that the tax
authorities were not obliged to identify and credit undeclared input VAT on their own:

“The fact that documents confirming, in the taxpayer's opinion, a right for tax
credit are available without reflecting (showing, claiming) the amount of the
tax credit in a tax return is not a ground for reduction of VAT payable to the

Reply 251 (citing Russian Tax Code, Article 165, Exh. R-1484 (“In the event that no documents (copies thereof)
referred above are provided by the taxpayer within 180 days after the expiry of 180 days of the date of the release by
the regional customs authority under export or transit customs procedure, said transactions involving the sale of goods
(performance of works, provision of services) shall be taxed at a rate of 10 percent or 18 percent accordingly. In the
event that subsequently the taxpayer submits to the tax authorities any documents (copies thereof) proving eligibility
of the zero percent tax rate application, the tax paid shall be refunded to the taxpayer in the manner and on terms and
conditions expressly provided by article 176 of this Code.”).

making this argument, but Article 165 had nothing to do with the period (i.e., monthly or annual) that Yukos’ VAT
filing should have covered.” and also citing Second Konnov Report § 93).

budget for a tax period. Availability of documents confirming the right for
VAT credit does not replace an obligation to claim it in a tax return.”

88. The Supreme Arbitrazh Court unequivocally confirmed that, as concerns VAT,
Russian tax legislation is very formal and no VAT benefit can be allowed if it was not
properly claimed by a taxpayer in a tax return.”°

When he gave evidence, Mr.Konnov also offered a practical justification for the

monthly/quarterly requirement:

But secondly, you cannot simply amend VAT law to allow annual return, because there are
a few corresponding provisions. For instance, there is a provision on the chamber audit, on
which I was questioned by Professor Gaillard: it is three months. And what that means:
that if one taxpayer is on a monthly VAT return and the other one is on a quarterly return,
the three months are sufficient for the tax authorities to do a counter-audit with respect to
all the suppliers and other interested parties.

If, however, you simply introduce annual return, and without corresponding changes to
other provisions in the Tax Code, the tax authorities -- basically the VAT law will not
function properly. So you can do that, but that would mean not only allowing acceptance
of annual return, but redrafting the whole VAT chapter of the Tax Code to work it
properly.””°
The Tribunal observes that while this practical justification does seem to support the
monthly/quarterly filing requirement when the tax authorities are auditing the underlying
transactions, it is more difficult to understand how that justification applied to Yukos’ attempts
to obtain credit for the trading companies’ VAT refunds, in a situation where those VAT
refunds had already been vetted and approved by the authorities at the time they had been

claimed (for the first time) by the trading entities.

In their Reply, Claimants assert that there was no reason to believe that, if Yukos had
disaggregated the VAT data into monthly submissions as Respondent suggests it should have

done the tax authorities would have accepted the filings:

Indeed, the Claimants note that if such resubmissions were a genuinely available option,
the Respondent offers no explanation as to why, once Yukos’ allegedly self-destructive
management had been replaced with a bankruptcy receiver, that receiver, Mr. Rebgun,
failed to resubmit the VAT returns in the allegedly required format, given that if such an
option had existed, Mr. Rebgun’s fiduciary duties to the creditors would have required him
to take advantage of it.”””

689.

In respect of this point, Professor Gaillard opined that the Russian authorities, including the
courts, would certainly have found another reason to deny Yukos the VAT exemption if Yukos
had filed monthly amended returns. Professor Gaillard referred Mr. Konnov to the following

extract from the Moscow Arbitrazh Court’s decision relating to the 2003 tax year:

“The tax return submitted by ... Yukos Oil Company for value added tax for 2003 cannot
be considered, since it does not meet the requirements of tax legislation regarding
submission of a VAT tax return for each tax period, which is a month or quarter, and
documents were not submitted at these times confirming the sale of goods for export and
tax deductions...”

Professor Gaillard then put the following question to Respondent’s expert:

. Simply, Mr Konnoy, when you look at this sentence which the Chairman directed
ply: y
you to, do you also see that the court says that the tax return cannot be considered
because:

“.., documents were not submitted at these times ...”
Do you see that?
A. Yes, I do.

Q. So the reason the court is articulating is that: (1) it’s not monthly or quarterly; and
(2) it was not submitted at the right time. Correct?”””

690. Mr. Konnov disagreed with Professor Gaillard’s interpretation:

691.

No, no. It says that you need to submit supporting documents, which are in Article 165,
with your VAT return. Article 165 says VAT return and supporting documents.’

Earlier in his evidence, Mr. Konnov had also supported the court’s reasoning in the following

words:

And this is exactly the reason I explain in my report, I believe, that Yukos had to file
monthly returns, and there is no such thing as an annual return, And the document that is
in the record suggests that Yukos filed an annual return by even using a pen, I believe, or
one way or another just crossing out and filling in the form the way it electronically cannot
be done. And the court addresses it here, and says that, “What you filed is not a proper
VAT return”!

692. The Tribunal finds the following exchange between Professor Gaillard and Mr. Konnov of

78

particular interest. Professor Gaillard asked Mr. Konnov for his reaction to another reason

which could have been invoked by the Russian authorities/courts to deny the VAT refunds to

Yukos even if it had filed “proper” monthly VAT returns:

Q. Okay. Do you see the sentence pursuant to which the court [the Moscow Arbitrazh
Court rejecting Yukos’s VAT argument in relation to the 2002 tax year] says:

“The court did not accept the argument of ... YUKOS [Oil Company]
that tax returns submitted to tax authorities by the said organisations
[ie., the trading entities] shall be deemed as tax retuns of ... YUKOS
{Oil Company] since such returns were signed by persons who had no
powers to submit tax returns on behalf of .... YUKOS [Oil
Company].”

Do you see that?

A. Right.

PROFESSOR GAILLARD: So what interests me is this sentence which we read, the court
saying that they:

“... did not accept the argument of ... Yukos that tax returns submitted
... by the [trading companies] shall be deemed as tax returns of ...
YUKOS [Oil Company] since such tax returns were signed by
persons who had no powers to submit tax returns on behalf of ...
YUKOS [Oil Company].”
Can you confirm that this is a correct translation of the Russian original?

A. [think it is. And I think, again, as you have read out, the court responds to “the
argument of ... Yukos”. So this sentence suggests that Yukos argued that they
should be deemed as if they were filed by Yukos. And probably the question was:
how can someone act on behalf of Yukos? And the court said, “Look, they cannot
be accepted as Yukos tax returns, at least because someone who signed them, in the
name of Yukos-M here, could not act on behalf of Yukos.”

Q. But conversely the papers themselves would say that Ratibor -- or Yukos-M, in this
example -- is the exporter. The documentation they could file would say Yukos-M,
Ratibor, Fargoil, whatever, has sold abroad. So the documents are not going to bear
the name of Yukos, are they?

A. Absolutely.

Q. Right. So Yukos loses one way or the other, because either the documents do not
say that they are the exporter, or they are not deemed to be the beneficiaries of the
revenues, right?

A. No, Yukos wins one way: it simply refiles.””

693. According to Respondent, Claimants’ submission that there was no reason to believe that, had

Yukos made proper filings, the tax authorities would have accepted them, is “gratuitously self-

serving’ According to Respondent, “Russian law clearly indicates what Yukos should have

done, but inexplicably failed to do.”

The Tribunal is of the view, having considered the evidence and arguments canvassed above,
that the Russian Federation was determined to impose the VAT liability on Yukos, and would
have done whatever was necessary to ensure that the VAT liability was imposed on Yukos.
The Tribunal observes that this determination of the Russian Federation to do whatever it
deemed necessary to impose massive tax liabilities on Yukos is also evidenced by the second
trial and conviction of Mikhail Khodorkovsky. After having been convicted of various tax-

735

related crimes in May 2005,” largely stemming from his leadership of Yukos, for which he
was sentenced to a term of nine years of imprisonment, Mr. Khodorkovsky was implausibly
convicted of money laundering and theft of oil in December 2010.”° This second verdict, for
which Mr. Khodorkovsky was sentenced to an additional thirteen years and six months in
prison, was based on essentially the same circumstances surrounding Yukos that led to the
original conviction for tax evasion. This shows how far the Russian Federation was willing to
go to keep Mr. Khodorkovsky imprisoned, and supports the Tribunal’s conclusion that it was

Respondents intent to impose VAT liability on Yukos no matter what Yukos did.

The Tribunal also heard submissions from the Parties on the responsibility of the bankruptcy

trustee (Mr. Rebgun) for his failure to file VAT forms in the proper format.
On this issue, Respondent contends as follows:

Finally, while the Russian Federation does not speak for Mr.Rebgun or know the
circumstances of his treatment of the VAT issue, it is specious for Claimants to attempt to
blame Mr. Rebgun for Yukos’ failure to file proper amended VAT returns for 2000-2003
(or any amended VAT return at all for 2004). Mr. Rebgun took office only in

had appointed. That team, as noted above, had submitted non-processable amended VAT
filings for years 2000-2003 in August 2004, and had done nothing in the ensuing two-year

period to correct those errors. As for the 2004 tax year, the managers appointed by
Claimants failed to submit any amended returns at all. Accordingly, Claimants and their
appointees bear sole responsibility for Yukos’ mishandling of the VAT filings. Mr. Rebgun
cannot be blamed, if only because by the time he finally took office (a) the 2000-2004 tax
assessments had already been issued and become due and payable for all five of the
relevant years, (b) the court rulings that had upheld the 2000-2003 tax assessments had
become res judicata, and (c) in any event, the three-year time limits to file amended VAT
returns had already expired for the whole of the 2000, 2001, and 2002 tax years, as well as
for more than half of the 2003 tax year. In any event, as established at paragraphs 388-395
above, it is clear as a matter of public international law that the Russian Federation is not
responsible for acts or omissions of bankruptcy receivers such as Mr. Rebgun.”*”

 

697. To conclude this subsection, the Tribunal will now quote the following exchange between a

member of the Tribunal and Respondent’s expert Mr. Konnov, in respect of Yukos’ VAT
liability.

JUDGE SCHWEBEL: Is it right, then, to infer from your testimony—particularly what
you've just said—that the management of Yukos, or its counsel, in not filing full VAT
returns monthly, committed an astounding error worth more than $13 billion?

A. Right. It’s absolutely clear to me—whether you call it “error” or whether that was
intentional action, I don’t know—but the defect in the VAT return was so apparent
for not only a professional tax advisor and not only for Yukos, which, as we know,
had a big tax team and was filing and processing this VAT return on a routine basis,
but we also -- I think I referred to documents, correspondence by Golub where she
admitted that it should be monthly and they required it monthly.

So I think I have absolutely no doubt that they perfectly understood that the
amended returns cannot and will not be accepted.

JUDGE SCHWEBEL: And can you find any rational explanation for such behaviour?

enjoyed a considerable amount of operational and institutional independence, as State authorities did not have the
power to give instructions to him and therefore could not directly interfere with the liquidation proce: such. The
State’s involvement in the liquidation procedure resulted only from its role in establishing the legislative framework
for such procedures, in defining the functions and the powers of the creditors’ body and of the liquidator, and in
overseeing observance of the rules. It follows that the liquidator did not act as a State agent. Consequently, the
respondent State cannot be held directly responsible for his wrongful acts in the present case. The fact that a court was
entitled to review the lawfulness of the liquidator’s actions does not alter this anal; ”)

A. Ihave difficulties finding the rational behaviour, and there is nothing in the record.
My only guess, and that would only be a guess: that what Yukos was trying to do, it
was trying to take a position that in its view will not compromise its position with
respect to the profits tax.

In other words, if Yukos—Yukos clearly would not follow my advice, and my
advice, as you have seen, will be to refile both. If they refiled proper VAT return
without refiling—sorry, if they refiled proper—if they refiled proper VAT returns
without refiling proper profit tax retum, I think they were—my guess, my
speculation, is they thought that court would look at that and would see that as them
taking an inconsistent position for VAT and profits tax purposes.

 

So therefore my guess, again, is that they filed something—which I would not call
even maybe a VAT return, but something that they knew was apparently not
acceptable—just to take procedural actions. But, as came during the cross-
examination by Professor Gaillard, I think I mentioned that they file in August and
they don’t even refer to these returns till the—till late 2005—till 2005.

So that’s my only guess: that they tried to put in—to file something with the tax
service which could later on be used in argument, but would not compromise, in
their view, their position on the profits tax.

JUDGE SCHWEBEL: Could the Trustee in Bankruptcy, who was charged with
maximising the resources available for creditors, himself have filed the monthly forms for
VAT return?

A. — Yes, he could have refiled, subject to the three-year limitation that I referred to
previously. So you look at the date when he came to power, if I may say, and for
the previous three years he could have refiled.

THE CHAIRMAN: Should he be criticised for that?

A. — I would say so. But it’s easy now to criticise, when I look back. So I would say I
would—

Yes, I would say I would criticise him ”**
v. Extracts from Other Yukos-Related Awards

698. The Quasar tribunal, citing the RosInvestCo tribunal’s holding, traversed the VAT issue in the
following words and concluded without any hesitation that Respondent’s position on this issue

was indefensible:

D) The rejection of the VAT refund

80. The unattractiveness of the Respondent's position in this connection is readily
apparent. The amounts involved were vast — in excess of $13.5 billion. The export sales in
question undoubtedly qualified for VAT refunds. The trading company sellers had duly
applied for them. But once the tax authorities had invalidated the transactions by which
the sellers had come into possession of the goods, they concluded that Yukos was the true
original owner and therefore should be deemed to be the true export seller. If this was so,
one would expect that by a parity of reasoning under their basic premise, the tax authorities
should have held that the true applicant for the refund was also Yukos — and that Yukos

was therefore entitled to the VAT credit in the same way as it was assigned the debit for
the profit tax. To try to have it both ways would surely bespeak unprincipled hostility
towards the taxpayer.

 

81. Yet that is precisely what the tax officials did — with the subsequent endorsement of
the courts.

82. Unsurprisingly, Ros/Invest viewed this conduct in the harsh light it deserves:

“The extremely formalistic interpretation of the VAT lax law regarding
Yukos and its trading companies to the effect that, though exports were
undisputedly not subject to VAT, the documentation also undisputedly
submitted by the trading companies could not be used in relation to Yukos
and thus Yukos was liable far more than US$ 13.5 billion in VAT related
taxes is difficult to accept as a justification for a tax liability the size of which
was sufficient to lead Yukos into bankruptcy.” (41452)

The present Tribunal entirely endorses this conclusion, and agrees with the Claimants that
the ECHR appears, in 601-602, to have entirely missed the point being made, namely
that if the tax authorities were going to attribute to Yukos the transactions carried out in the
names of its trading companies, they should also have attributed to Yukos the submission
of normal VAT documentation by the trading companies. Given that the export
transactions in question were indisputably zero-rated for VAT purposes, the refusal to do
so can only seem y toa degree which comes close to validating the claims in

their entirety on this basis alone.””
[emphasis added]

699. The following extract from the judgment of the ECtHR, which found in favour of the Russian

Federation on this issue is of interest:

601. The Court notes that both Section 5 of Law no. 1992-1 of 6 December 1991 “On
Value-Added Tax” governing the relevant sphere until 1 January 2001 as well as
Article 165 of the Tax Code applicable to the subsequent period provided unequivocally
that a zero rate of value-added tax in respect of exported goods and its refund could by no
means be applied automatically, and that the company was required to claim the tax
exemptions or refunds under its own name under the procedure set out initially in Letter
no. B3-8-05/848, 04-03-08 of the State Tax Service of Russia and the Ministry of Finance
and subsequently in Article 176 of the Tax Code to substantiate the requests in order to
obtain the impugned refunds (see paragraphs 326-336). In view of the above, the Court
finds that the relevant rules made the procedure for VAT refunds sufficiently clear and
accessible for the applicant company to able to comply with it.

602. Having examined the case file materials and the parties’ submissions, including the
company’s allegation made at the hearing on 4 March 2010 that it had filed the VAT
exemption forms for each of the years 2000 to 2003 on 31 August 2004, the Court finds
that the applicant company failed to submit any proof that it had made a properly

d filing in dance with the estat dure, and not simply raised it
as one of the arguments in the Tax Assessment proceedings, and that it had then contested
any refusal by the tax authorities before the competent domestic courts (see paragraphs 49
and 171, 196, 196 and 216). The Court concludes that the applicant company did not
receive any adverse treatment in this respect.”“°

In the view of this Tribunal however, far from not receiving “any adverse treatment in this
respect” as the ECtHR held, Yukos received some thirteen billion dollars worth of adverse
treatment by reason of the imposition on it of VAT liabilities earlier excluded by the undisputed

export of the oil in question.

(c) Fines

i. Introduction

Claimants contend that neither the “willful offender” nor the “repeat offender” fines should
have been assessed, and that “the animating, confiscatory purpose behind the Respondent’s
actions is palpable.””*' Claimants also assert that the imposition of fines for the year 2000 was
barred by the statute of limitations, and that the authorities’ reliance on what Claimants
characterize as a new, retroactive, and judicially-created exception to the statute is further

demonstration of its expropriatory intent.”

Respondent insists that the authorities’ conduct was proper, that the Russian courts properly
rejected Yukos’ arguments against the fines, and that the Tribunal should do the same here in

the present arbitration.

The following questions with respect to fines arise from a review of the Parties’ written and

oral submissions:

e Were the fines levied in relation to the 2000 tax year barred by the statute of

limitations?;
e Were the “willful offender” fines properly imposed?;
e Were the “repeat offender” fines properly imposed?;
e Could Yukos have avoided the fines?; and
e Was the quantum of the fines reasonable, in terms of both the rate and the absolute

amount?

ii, | Were Fines Levied in Relation to the 2000 Tax Year Barred by
the Statute of Limitations?

Article 113 of the Russian Tax Code establishes a three-year statute of limitations for all tax
offenses.’ In respect of the 2000 tax year, Yukos had argued before the Russian courts that it
was improper for the authorities to levy any fine because their assessment was not issued until
14 April 2004, i.e.,a few months after the posited expiration of the statute of limitations for
fines. Yukos’ argument was considered by Russia’s courts and ultimately rejected on the
ground that the statute of limitations had been tolled by Yukos’ “interference” with the

authorities’ following the December 2003 tax audit.

The Tribunal notes that after the 2000 Audit Report was issued, Mr. Pepeliaev, in his first

opinion to his client Yukos, on 5 January 2004, concluded that:

The Russian tax law envisages a legal process to collect fines. However the fine cannot be
actually collected in 2004 due to the expiration of the 3-year limitation period.”

Ina later opinion, Mr. Pepeliaev wrote:

In accordance with the currently applicable procedure set out in Art. 101 of the Tax Code
of the Russian Federation, a decision to hold the company liable pursuant to the Inspection
Report of December 29, 2003 may be passed no earlier than in 2004. Moreover, by virtue
of art. 113 of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation no one may be held liable for a tax
offence if three years have expired (limitation period) from the date of this tax offence or
from the date following the end date of the tax period in which this offence was committed.
In breach of this rule of law, the Inspection Report says that YUKOS should be held liable
for the activities of 17 companies that took place in 2000.”°

Respondent, in its Counter-Memorial, objects that Claimants did not raise the statute of
limitations argument in their Memorial. In any event, Respondent submits, the argument is
meritless. Respondent adopts the reasoning of the Russian Courts.“ Respondent adds: “[T]he

statute of limitations provided a windfall to Yukos, insofar as the tax authorities never disturbed

Russian Tax Code, Article 11(1), Exh. C-1276. Mr. Konnov opines, in his Second Expert Report, that, under Russian
law, the statute of limitations applies to fines only, and does not apply to tax arrears or default interest. Second

Yukos’ abuses of the low-tax region regime prior to 2000. Yukos thus obtained a ‘free ride’ for

the frauds it perpetrated in 1999, which involved significant amounts.””*”

In their Reply, Claimants invoked the limitations period. They argue that it was unlawful for
the tax authorities to seek to collect fines in relation to 2000 because “the decision of the
Russian tax authorities to hold Yukos liable in respect of alleged tax offenses committed in
2000 was issued on 14 April 2004, several months after the three-year statute of limitations had
expired in relation to the year 2000 (i.e., after 31 December 2003).”"*

Claimants respond to Respondent’s reliance on the decisions of the Russian courts in the

following words:

The Respondent’s assertion (see Respondent’s Counter-Memorial on the Merits, April 4,
2011, footnote 1708) that the Russian courts approved its circumvention of the statute of
limitations against Yukos is unavailing given that, as discussed below, the ECtHR has
found the Russian courts’ decisions to violate the principle of legality embodied in
Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the European Convention on Human Rights, notwithstanding
the extraordinary broad deference it accords to States under that provision.”
Claimants assert that the tax authorities were able to circumvent the statute of limitations only
because the Constitutional Court “creat[ed] for the first time an exception to the statute of
limitations for any taxpayer who ‘resisted’ tax inspection, so long as an audit report was issued

before the end of the limitations period.””*”

Respondent resists Claimants’ submission that the Constitutional Court’s resolution allowing
tolling of the statute of limitations in cases of taxpayer obstruction was “tailor-made” for
Yukos.”*' In its Rejoinder, Respondent argues that Claimants’ submission is unsupported by
any evidence and contradicted by the fact that this exception has been applied to numerous

taxpayers, all unrelated to Yukos.”” As to the specific Constitutional Court Resolution No. 9 P,

Counter-Memorial 1081, n.1708. Claimants reply that the 1999 audit report relating to Investproekt (Exh. R-304)
was issued with ten months remaining on the statute of limitations, but that no Decision or Tax Payment Demand was
issued (or, at least, none is in the record of this arbitration). See Claimants’ Post-Hearing Brief § 63, n.36.

Respondent says that it was issued in response to two different complaints, only one of which

was related to Yukos.’**

712. In his Second Expert Report, Mr. Konnov explains that the Constitutional Court ruled, in

Resolution No. 9-P, as follows:

a. _if'a taxpayer obstructs tax control and tax audits, the arbitrazh court may rule that
the tax authority was justified in acting after expiration of the limitations period; and

b. in any event, the limitations period for tax offenses ends at the moment of execution
of a tax audit report summarising documented facts of tax offenses identified in the
course of the audit.”

713. Mr. Konnov addresses Claimants’ argument on this point:

The Claimants’ allegation (Claimants’ Reply on the Merits, para. 258) that the Russian
Constitutional Court created an “exception to the statute of limitations for any taxpayer
who “resisted” tax inspection, so long as an audit report was issued before the end of the
limitations period” is misleading (emphasis added). The Constitutional Court made two
separate conclusions not dependent on each other. The Claimants’ contention that the “tax
audit report” rule was “tailor-made” for YUKOS is not correct either. The tax authorities
would have nonetheless been deemed within the statute of limitations period under the
obstruction of the audit limb of the Resolution.”

[emphasis in original]

714. Mr. Konnov also adds:

The ruling of the Constitutional Court issued in July 2005 is described by the Claimants as
“tailor-made” to YUKOS and in conflict with the ruling of the Constitutional Court issued
in January 2005. I cannot agree. There is no inconsistency between these two rulings.
Rather, in the July 2005 ruling, the Constitutional Court analyzed, in particular, the impact
on the limitations period resulting from obstruction of the audit, an issue which was not
addressed in any way in the January 2005 ruling.

The Claimants’ reliance on the dissenting opinions in the July 2005 ruling is incomplete.
The Claimants refer only to two dissenting opinions relating to the July 2005 ruling.
However, they fail to mention the third dissenting opinion to the same ruling in which
Judge G.A. Gadzhiev has taken an approach which, in my opinion, is even harsher than the
approach taken by the Constitutional Court. In the view of Judge G.A. Gadzhiev, the
statute of limitations should be applied differently depending on the amount of the tax
arrears at issue. He believes that the non-differentiated statute of limitation, as it is
provided in the tax legislation, contradicts the constitutional principle of equality before the
law.”

718.

Finally, Respondent adds in its Rejoinder on this point:

It is also worth reiterating that, as noted above, the Russian authorities’ long-standing
position, including when the Yukos cases were being argued in the Russian courts, has
been that the three-year limitation period runs from the end of the taxable period in which
payment was due (because this is the period when the tax offense actually occurred), and
not from the end of the taxable period in which the relevant income or revenue accrued
(and therefore, here, that the statute of limitations expired on December 31, 2004 rather
than December 31, 2003). While this position was rejected by the courts in the Yukos
case, it was upheld in other cases, and ultimately endorsed by the Supreme Arbitrazh
Court. As a result, if the Yukos case were before the Russian courts today, it would be
undisputable that the fines for tax year 2000 were assessed in a timely manner.”*”

In their Post-Hearing Brief, Claimants assert that “it is factually untrue that alleged obstruction
by Yukos caused the tax authorities to miss the statute of limitations: the audit was completed

in just 3 weeks and before the limitations period had expired.””*

 

In its Post-Hearing Brief, Respondent asserts that “Yukos unquestionably obstructed the field
tax audit leading to the 2000 assessment, and it was completely foreseeable that Russian law
would not allow Yukos to invoke a limitations period so as to benefit from its own

5 975
obstruction.”””

The Tribunal concludes, on the basis of the record, that Respondent has made a credible
argument regarding Yukos’ obstruction of the field tax audit leading to the 2000 assessment.”
However, the Tribunal agrees with Claimants, and with the ECtHR, that the retroactive
application of Resolution 9-P violated a fundamental principle of legality." The Tribunal
concludes that the fines levied in relation to the 2000 tax year were therefore barred by the

statute of limitations.

iii, | Were the “Willful Offender” Fines Properly Imposed?

Claimants contest the imposition of the “willful offender” fines for the years 2000 through 2003
because “for Yukos’ executives to be ‘aware of the unlawful nature of such actions’, there must
have existed an enforceable decision of the tax authorities to that effect.” Such a decision,
Claimants note, did not come until 14 April 2004, and thus only after Yukos filed its tax returns
for the years 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003.” Consequently, for the years 2000 through 2003,

Yukos’ executives could not have been “aware” of the alleged “unlawful nature of the[ir]

actions.”

In respect of the 2004 tax year, Claimants have a different argument:

As regards the 2004 tax reassessment, the regional and local tax benefits that these
companies had enjoyed were significantly reduced by the federal legislator as from
January 1, 2004. With the change in legislation, the alleged tax offenses for which Yukos
was held liable with respect to the year 2004 could therefore not have been considered
similar to those which had allegedly been committed by Yukos in 2000-2003 under the
former legislation. In this context, the reference made by the Moscow Arbitrazh Court in
2006 to the 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003 Decisions in order to justify the 40% fines for the
year 2004 appear to be nothing less than a manifest misapplication of the law to Yukos.”°

In response, Respondent asserts, in its Counter-Memorial, that “‘willfulness’ does not require

criminal mens rea: it is sufficient that the taxpayer’s underassessment indicate a degree of

99766

awareness of the potential unlawfulness of its conduct. Nor does Respondent accept

Claimants’ argument that, in order for a violation to be deemed “willful”, the taxpayer must

already have been found liable. Respondent counters that:

Even if Yukos, quod non, had been transparent and subjectively in good faith with respect
to its “tax optimization” scheme, the very complexity of its scheme made it unavoidable
that it would, at a minimum, be deemed “willful”: one does not create a network of trading
companies carelessly or as a result of honest mistake. In any event, . . . Yukos’ managers
knew perfectly well that their scheme was illegal when they first implemented it -- an
aggravated form of “willfulness.”””

grant to taxpayers out of the regional and local shares of this tax were limited to four percent.”

725.

Mr. Konnov supported Respondent’s position with the following observations in his First

Report:

At the time, YUKOS was one of the major Russian companies with substantial tax, legal
and accounting departments. It knew that: (i) its tax minimization practices in ZATO
Lesnoy had been investigated and challenged since late 1999; and (ii) its Sibirskaya
Domestic Trading Company had been challenged by the tax authorities in 2001 and had
lost its tax case in 2002. It also must have known that Russian authorities have been
regularly challenging transactions involving other taxpayers aimed at tax evasion,
including by means of abuses of companies registered in low-tax jurisdictions, and that
Russian highest courts had introduced anti-abuse doctrines, including “bad faith.”
Accordingly, in my view, YUKOS was a clear target for assessment of a “wilful offender
fine,” which would have been justified even under far less extreme circumstances.’

In their Reply, Claimants argue that Respondent is wrong in its contention that the Tax Ministry

was merely required to show a “degree of awareness of the potential unlawfulness of Yukos”

39769

conduct. Claimants contend that Respondent’s theory is “refuted by the plain text of the

provision itself as well as the Respondent’s own expert, who accepts that the statute requires

the Authorities to prove that the offender ‘was aware of the unlawful nature of his action

(or inaction)’.””” Claimants contend that Respondent’s position requires it to “attempt to

rewrite the statute.”””!

Claimants take particular issue with the imposition of fines in respect of the VAT refunds:

[A]s a general point, the imposition of fines in circumstances where no violation of
statutory law has been alleged is a matter of dubious legitimacy. Particularly improper was
the imposition of fines in relation to the revocation of VAT refunds. In circumstances
where it was not alleged that any tax was owed, much less unpaid or underpaid, there was
no statutory basis for such fines.”

Claimants elaborate this argument in their Post-Hearing Brief:

Particularly egregious is the imposition of such inflated fines in relation to VAT, where it
is not even alleged that there was any intent to evade VAT nor any actual evasion of VAT.
In any case, as set out above, Yukos was not, and could not possibly be “aware of the
unlawful nature of its actions”.

726. In its Rejoinder, Respondent reiterates its argument that the relevant inquiry for purposes of the

“willful offender” fine is whether Yukos’ management was aware of the illegality of its tax
scheme.’ Respondent states that Yukos did not implement the tax optimization scheme by
accident, and that it knew that the scheme was unlawful. In support of its submission,

Respondent raised several arguments:

. Yukos masked its affiliation with the trading shells and falsely denied to the Russian
authorities and courts that it had any knowledge of their documents or officers

© Yukos knew from its experience with its sham Lesnoy trading shells that its scheme
was unlawful

. Yukos’s senior management was warned at least twice that the authorities would
have challenged Yukos’ “tax optimization” scheme if they had known the names
and details of Yukos’ trading shells and their affiliation with Yukos

© No legal counsel ever provided Yukos with an opinion that its “tax optimization”
scheme was lawful

. Yukos lied about its affiliation with its sham trading companies to the Russian tax
authorities and courts, the ECtHR, and PwC

© Yukos had access to the case law and commentaries published by its own tax
counsel, which confirmed its scheme was unlawful.”

727. Finally, Respondent argues:

728.

729.

The Tribunal should reject Claimants’ contention that the willful offender fines were
improper because Yukos’ tax practices were purportedly based on the trading shells’
investment agreements with local tax authorities, which as Mr. Konnov opined - without
contradiction - were not sufficient to establish compliance with federal anti-abuse
doctrines.””*
The Tribunal is of the view that the willful offender fines were clearly improper insofar as they
related to VAT. This follows necessarily from the Tribunal’s findings that there was no valid

basis to impose the VAT liability on Yukos.

On the totality of the evidence, the Tribunal is also of the view that the willful offender fines as
they related to the revenue-based taxes were improperly assessed against Yukos. The Tribunal
recalls its findings, above, that those taxes, considering all of the evidence, were not properly

assessed against Yukos.

Moreover, while he did not appear at the Hearing, the contemporaneous quote from
Mr. Kasyanov to journalists in January 2004 shows just how unlikely it was that Yukos could

have been certain that its tax optimization plan was illegal:

[Question:] The Tax Ministry claimed from Yukos to pay an additional 98 billion rubles,
which the company allegedly saved on taxes in 2000 with the help of the schemes, which
was also used by other companies. Until autumn 2003, neither the Ministry of Finance nor
the Tax Ministry, though criticizing the schemes, had challenged their legality. How do
you react to the fact that the tax optimization is retroactively declared unlawful?

[Answer:] If lawful actions for tax optimization are declared unlawful retroactively, then I

react to that negatively. For the simple reason that there were loopholes in the law

allowing the optimization of p ts. The Tax Code did not forbid Yukos and other
ies to conduct ions through domestic offshore zones.”

[emphasis added]

The opinion of Mr. Kasyanov, the Prime Minister at the time the assessment was made, is
persuasive. It confirms the conclusion of the Tribunal that, even if the legality of Yukos’ tax
optimization scheme was, in certain regions and respects, questionable and vulnerable to attack

by the tax authorities, it could not be characterized as a “willful offense”.

The Tribunal also recalls Claimants’ position as to the governing statutory provision in the

Russian Tax Code:

Whereas the Tax Code clearly provides that fines may be increased for willfulness only “if
the person who committed it was aware of the unlawful nature of his actions (inaction) and
intended or consciously allowed the harmful consequences of such actions (inaction)” the
Respondent claimed that such fines could be imposed if the taxpayer had “a degree of
awareness of the potential unlawfulness of its conduct”. The Respondent’s position is
obviously not the law.”

[emphasis in original]
The Tribunal agrees. Respondent’s interpretation of the standard is inconsistent with the
Russian Tax Code. The strict language of the Russian Tax Code makes it difficult for the
Tribunal to conclude that Yukos should have been assessed the willful offender fines, even if
there were a basis to conclude (as the Tribunal has held earlier) that some of the revenue-based

taxes could legitimately have been imposed against Yukos.

iv. Were the “Repeat Offender” Fines Properly Imposed?

Claimants contend that the 100 percent increase of the fines imposed on the basis of the
“Repeat Offender” provision of the Russian Tax Code was even less justified than the

imposition of the “Willful Offender” fine:

[T]he plain wording of Article 112(2) of the Russian Tax Code directs that such increase
be only permitted in cases in which a taxpayer has been held liable for a similar tax offense
prior to the commission of the disputed offense. The Presidium of Highest Arbitrazh
Court of the Russian Federation has been unequivocal in considering that the previous
similar offense must not only be committed, but also be detected and sanctioned. No such
sanction came before April 14, 2004. As a result, in declaring that the tax offenses
allegedly committed by Yukos in 2001, 2002 and 2003 were repeat offenses triggering a
further 100% increase, both the Russian tax authorities and the Russian courts grossly
misapplied Article 112(2). As regards the 2004 fines, their 100% increase was all the more
egregious that the tax offenses purportedly committed by Yukos in 2004 were not similar
to those allegedly committed in 2000-2003.””

Claimants also rely on the Resolution of the Presidium of the Highest Arbitrazh Court of the
Russian Federation No. 15557/07 of 1 April 2008 (Annex (Merits) C 415) for the proposition
that, in order for a taxpayer to be considered a “Repeat Offender”, the taxpayer’s previous
similar offence must have been “detected and sanctioned” before the commission of the repeat

offence. Respondent takes issue with Claimants’ reliance on this decision adopted in 2008,
“years after Yukos’ appeals against the assessments at issue had run their course.””*°
Respondent contends that the jurisprudence prior to 2008, at the time that the authorities

imposed the “Repeat Offender” fines, supported the authorities’ approach:

Prior to the issuance of the 2008 Resolution, there had been a number of cases, unrelated to
Yukos, in which the courts had upheld the assessment of repeat offender fines in the same
manner as was done in the Yukos cases. Thus, when the tax authorities levied repeat
offender fines against Yukos -- an egregious repeat offender if there ever was one -- they
were not deviating from established practice but rather, applying one of the interpretations
of the relevant statute that was in current use at the time. As much was effectively
conceded by Yukos’ own lawyer who, while urging that Yukos not be assessed a repeat
offender fine, noted the “unclarity” of the law.”*'

Claimants contend, in their Reply, that Respondent’s argument should be rejected. According
to Claimants, Respondent does not contest the existence and significance of the 2008 decision,
but merely contends that because this decision came in 2008, it should not be considered by the

Tribunal. Claimants conclude:

In other words, while the Respondent concedes that the repeat offender fines were
unlawful under the correct interpretation of the provision, it seeks to justify the fines on the
basis of an alleged uncertainty about the correctness of that interpretation.

In their Post-Hearing Brief, Claimants also criticize Respondent’s reliance on the pre-2008

jurisprudence:

The Respondent and its expert concede that the imposition of repeat offender fines against
Yukos was contrary to the interpretation of the Highest Arbitrazh Court issued in 2008.
The Respondent’s only defense is to argue that some other courts had previously applied
the statute in the same (incorrect) way. Thus, notwithstanding the requirement in
Article 3(7) of the Tax Code to resolve doubts in favor of the taxpayer, the Respondent
insists it was appropriate for the tax authorities to apply an interpretation that was both
incorrect and nearly US$ 4 billion less favorable to the taxpayer. The animating,
confiscatory purpose behind the Respondent's actions is palpable.’**

Mr. Konnov was cross-examined at length about the 2008 Arbitrazh Court decision.”
Throughout, he maintained his support for the authorities’ treatment of Yukos, prior to the 2008
decision. He did not concede that it was incorrect, but merely that it was a function of the

uncertainty inherent in the provision.

Mr. Konnov had indeed referred to the “uncertainty” or ambiguity surrounding Article 112(2)
of the Russian Tax Code in his First Expert Report:

77. The Claimants argue that the imposition of repeat offender fines on YUKOS was
unjustified and ignored the plain language of the governing law and the Supreme Arbitrazh
Court guidance. I cannot agree with the suggestion by the Claimants that the language of
Article 112(2) of the Tax Code was “plain” and that there is only one possible
interpretation of that provision. The relevant provision of the Tax Code reads as follows:

“Aggravating circumstance means commitment of a tax offence by a person
previously held liable for an analogous violation”.

78. YUKOS itself admitted during the court hearings related to the 2000 tax year there
was more than one possible reading of Article 112(2) of the Tax Code. The minutes of the
court hearing read as follows:

[A representative of YUKOS] “... believes that there is unclarity in
interpretation of Article 112 of the Russian Tax Code.””**

Code requires doubts as to the proper interpretation of its provisions to be resolved in favor of

39786

In relation to Article 3(7) of the Russian Tax Code, Respondent makes the following final

argument in its Post-Hearing Brief:

Claimants’ ion that d ambiguities in the statute governing repeat offender
fines had to be resolved in Yukos’ favor is baseless (Claim. Reb., Day 20 Tr. 196:18:23;
Konn, Test., Day 15 Tr, 33:14-33:25, 34:25-35:8). As Mr. Konnov explained without
contradiction (Konn. Test., Day 15 Tr. 34:1-34:24), and as is confirmed in a 2004 article
written by Mr, Zaripov (Exh, R-3223), only those doubts that courts cannot resolve must
be decided in favor of the taxpayer. Here, however, the relevant Tax Code provision was
interpreted consistently with prior caselaw, confirming that it did not give rise to any
irresolvable doubts. Konn. Rep. 1, 79; Konn. Rep. 2, § 102.7”

Respondent has another defense for the “repeat offender” fines, namely that Yukos would have
been deemed a repeat tax offender even under the approach adopted by the 2008 Resolution,
because it had been subjected to fines for underpayment of taxes well before any of the
assessments was issued. Respondent refers in this connection to paragraphs 81 and 82 of the

First Konnov Report, which reads as follows:

81. Furthermore, there could have been additional grounds for imposition of repeat
offender fines on YUKOS. Based on my experience, any Russian company of a size
comparable to that of YUKOS at the end of 1990s and the beginning of this decade was
regularly subject to tax audits. Almost all of these audits resulted in discovery of tax
violations and imposition of fines, even though in some instances the amounts were
relatively insignificant. The Nefteyugansk Tax Inspectorate imposed fines on YUKOS
pursuant to Decision No. 289 dated June 9, 2003. Even before that, the tax authorities
conducted a tax audit of YUKOS. The Report of the Nefteyugansk Tax Inspectorate
No. 66, dated April 28, 2003, notes that on April 16, 2001 the Inter-Regional Inspectorate
of the Tax Ministry for Operational Oversight of Problem Taxpayers issued a report
No. 34-03-10/6. Although I have not been able to review that act, it would not be
unreasonable to assume that fines were imposed on YUKOS based on that act. Moreover,
the US GAAP financials produced by YUKOS suggest that in each of 1998, 1999, 2000,
2001, 2002 and 2003, YUKOS was subject to substantial fines and interest for tax
violations.

82. In accordance with the prevailing court practice, a repeat offender fine may be
levied so long as the prior fine involved the same provision of the Tax Code with respect to

the same taxes, even if the nature and the amount of the violations were different.
Accordingly, even minor violations with respect to the same taxes imposed in connection
with different arrangements would have sufficed to justify the repeat offender fines even
under the approach taken by the 2008 Resolution.”**

Claimants counter Respondent’s alternative argument as follows:

The Respondent’s alternative theory, according to which any previous violation on profit
tax, on whatever basis and in whatever amount, would be sufficient to justify these
USS 3.92 billion in repeat offender fines is far-fetched to say the least, relying on
Mr. Konnov’s dubious assertion as to the content of “prevailing court practice”, his
speculation that Yukos may have had a previous violation at some point in time and his
assumption that that hypothetical violation involved the same provision of the Tax Code
with respect to the same taxes. In any event, since by the Respondent’s own admission its
tax claims were not premised on alleged violations of any provision of the Tax Code,
Mr. Konnov’s theory has no conceivable application in relation to Yukos.”*”

744. On the issue of the “repeat offender” fines, the Tribunal is persuaded by Claimants’ argument

74S.

746.

that these fines should not have been imposed.

v. Could Yukos Have Avoided the Fines?

In its Counter-Memorial, Respondent draws the attention of the Tribunal to Article 81(4) of the
Russian Tax Code which allows taxpayers to avoid all penalties for past misdeeds provided
only that they file amended tax returns before being formally notified of the onset of the audit
relating to the relevant tax years. If the taxpayer takes advantage of Article 81(4) in a timely
fashion, it needs to pay only the tax previously evaded (and interest), but no fine. This
provision, combined with the Russian practice (followed in the Yukos case) of auditing “open”
tax years (i.e., tax years not time-barred by the statute of limitations) one after the other, rather
than simultaneously, gives tax offenders an opportunity to eliminate their exposure to fines by

filing last-minute amended returns.”

On the basis of this provision, Respondent contends that Yukos could have easily avoided the
fines associated with the assessments for tax years 2001, 2002 and 2003, if only it had taken
advantage of Article 81(4) of the Russian Tax Code:

In Yukos’ case, the authorities had made clear their complete condemnation of Yukos’
scheme when they delivered their audit report for 2000 to Yukos, i.e., on December 29,
2003. They did not, however, announce commencement of their audit of the next year

749.

(2001) until March 23, 2004, i.e., 84 days later. As a result, Yukos had a window of
opportunity of nearly three months duration in which it could have legally avoided any
penalty whatsoever for tax year 2001 (including a willful offender fine and a repeat
offender fine), simply by filing amended returns and paying the respective taxes and
interest. The authorities’ audit for 2002 and 2003 did not start until August 9, 2004 and
October 28, 2004, respectively, and Yukos could likewise have avoided all penalties
simply by filing amended returns for 2002 and 2003 before those dates and paying the
overdue taxes and interest. Instead, Yukos’ managers recklessly squandered this
opportunity.”""

 

As an additional point for the tax year 2003, Respondent asserts that Yukos had only itself to
blame “for filing a fraudulent annual return for that year, which ended on or around 28 March
2004, the filing deadline.””” It is Respondent’s position that instead of continuing to pretend
that its scheme was lawful, some three months after the December 2003 audit, Yukos could

have filed an amended return.”

Similarly, Respondent submits that Yukos could have filed a “lawful tax return” for the 2004

tax year. On the basis of this reasoning, Respondent sums up its position as follows:

Had Yukos filed lawful tax returns beginning as of January 1, 2004 (i.e., after its receipt of
the December 29, 2003 tax audit report) and exercised in timely fashion its right to file
amended returns for years 2001 and 2002, and paid the respective taxes and default
interest, it would have reduced its overall tax liabilities in an amount that would have
ensured that Yukos would have not faced bankruptcy proceedings, and that would in all
likelihood also have avoided the need for the YNG auction.”

Claimants reject Respondent’s suggestion that Yukos should have pre-emptively conceded the
validity of the December 2003 tax audit for the 2000 tax year and filed amended tax returns for
subsequent years prior to being notified of the audits for those years. Claimants assert that
Respondent’s position “confirms the Russian authorities’ complete disregard for due process

and fundamental rights of taxpayers.””*

According to Claimants, Yukos had every right to
avail itself of its rights under Russian law to challenge these unlawful tax reassessments and
fines in court, or even await the results of the tax authorities’ own review of Yukos’ objections

and declaration of their final position in the decision to hold Yukos liable with respect to the

year 2000.”° Claimants note that Respondent decided to carry out additional control measures
and to review the 29 December 2003 audit report in light of Yukos’ objections but
communicated no information about this review prior to issuing its Decision to hold Yukos

liable on 14 April 2004 when it dismissed Yukos’ objections.”

The Tribunal does not accept that, if Yukos had acted as Respondent maintains, it would have
been able to escape the imposition of fines. As with the issue of VAT liability, the Tribunal is
convinced that had Yukos done so, the Russian Federation would still have found a way or a

reason to impose the fines on Yukos.

vi. Was the Quantum of the Fines Reasonable, in Terms of Both the
Rate and the Absolute Amount?

In its Counter-Memorial, Respondent compares the regime for fines in the Russian Federation
with those that exist in other countries. Respondent notes that fines for taxpayers that have
underpaid their taxes, whether or not associated with tax evasion, can lead to fines at rates
ranging up to 300 percent of the evaded tax (this highest rate applies, according to Respondent,
in Austria, the Netherlands, and Switzerland). On this basis, Respondent concludes: “It is clear
from the foregoing that the fines levied on Yukos were not excessive by international
standards.”””*

The Tribunal notes that Claimants did not address this last submission of Respondent. In any
event, given the Tribunal’s conclusions regarding the legitimacy of the willful and repeat
offender fines imposed by the tax authorities on Yukos, it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to

deal with this contention.

Extracts from Other Yukos-Related Awards

 

In respect of the limitations period as it applied to the 2000 tax year, the ECtHR found,
“notwithstanding the State’s margin of appreciation”, against the Russian Federation:
571. Turning to the facts of the case, the Court would note firstly that the rule which, in
the present case, underwent changes as a result of the decision of 14 July 2005, was
contained in Article 113 of Chapter 15 “General provisions concerning the liability for tax
Ibid.

Ibid., n.475
Counter-Memorial § 1224.

- 253 -

offences” of the Tax Code (see paragraph 403) and thus formed a part of the domestic
substantive law. Even though the rule in itself did not describe the substantive elements of
the offence and the applicable penalty, it nevertheless constituted a sine qua non condition
with which the authorities had to comply in order to be able to prosecute the relevant
taxpayers in connection with the alleged tax offences. Accordingly, Article 113 of the Tax
Code defined a crime for the purposes of the Court’s analysis of lawfulness. It remains to
be determined whether in the circumstances the decision of 14 July 2005 could be seen as a
gradual clarification of the rules on criminal liability which “[was] consistent with the
essence of the offence and could reasonably be foreseen” (see Kafkaris, cited above,
§ 141).

572. In this connection the Court may accept that the change in question did not change
the substance of the offence. The Constitutional Court interpreted the existing rules on
time-limits in relation to taxpayers who acted abusively. At the same time, the Court is not
persuaded that the change in question could have been reasonably foreseen.

573. It observes that the decision of 14 July 2005 had changed the rules applicable at the
relevant time by creating an exception from a rule which had had no previous exceptions
(see paragraphs 86 and 88). The decision represented a reversal and departure from the
well-established practice directions of the Supreme Commercial Court (see, by contrast,
Achour, cited above, § 52) and the Court finds no indication in the cases submitted by the
parties suggesting a divergent practice or any previous difficulty in connection with the
application of Article 113 of the Tax Code at the domestic level (see paragraphs 407-408).
Although the previous jurisprudence of the Constitutional Court contained some general
references to unfavourable legal consequences which taxpayers acting in bad faith could
face in certain situations, these indications, as such, were insufficient to provide a clear
guidance to the applicant company in the circumstances of the present case.

574, Overall, notwithstanding the State’s margin of appreciation in this sphere, the Court
finds that there has been a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 on account of the change
in interpretation of the rules on the statutory time-bar resulting from the Constitutional
Court’s decision of 14 July 2005 and the effect of this decision on the outcome of the Tax
Assessment 2000 proceedings.

575. Since the applicant company’s conviction under Article 122 of the Tax Code in the
2000 Tax Assessment proceedings laid the basis for finding the applicant company liable
for a repeated offence with a 100% increase in the amount of the penalties due in the 2001
Tax Assessment proceedings, the Court also finds that the 2001 Tax Assessment in the part
ordering the applicant company to pay the double fines was not in accordance with the law,
as required by Article 1 of Protocol No. 1.””

754. On the issue of the “repeat offender” fines, the Ros/nvestCo tribunal held as follows against the

Russian Federation:

From the evidence on file, the Tribunal concludes that the interpretation of Articles 122
and 114 of the Tax Code used on Yukos was not used before or thereafter in any
comparable cases. Again, this resulted in an extremely large liability in the range of
USS 3.8 billion.”

Repeat offender fines: The USS 3.8 billion repeat offender fines on the basis of conduct
pre-dating the tax audit again appears to the Tribunal as a departure from practice applied

earlier and from that granted to other companies and thus to be one part of a cumulative

Concluding Observations

The Tribunal recalls that, at the outset of this chapter, it referred to the question put by Counsel

for the claimant to the arbitral tribunal in the Quasar arbitration. “Why would Russia have

treated Yukos as it did if its purpose was to collect taxes’

79802

After having now traversed, at some length, the treatment of Yukos by Russian tax authorities,

the bailiffs and the courts, and having considered the totality of the evidence, especially the

VAT evidence, the Tribunal has concluded that the primary objective of the Russian Federation

was not to collect taxes but rather to bankrupt Yukos and appropriate its valuable assets.

The principal reasons, discussed in this chapter, which lead the Tribunal to this conclusion

include:

ii)

iii)

iv)

Ibid. § 620(c).

the attribution to Yukos of the revenues earned by its trading companies, even
though there was no precedent in Russia for such attribution based on the theory of
“actual owner”, and the refusal at the same time to give Yukos any of the benefits
of the VAT filings made by the trading companies, with the result that Yukos was
assessed USD 13.5 billion or 56 percent of the total tax claims levied against

Yukos;

the imposition on Yukos of the “willful offender” fines, at the very least as they

related to VAT;

the refusal of the tax authorities to give Yukos the benefit of Article 3(7) of the
Russian Tax Code to resolve doubts as to the interpretation of Article 112(2) of the
Russian Tax Code in favor of the taxpayer, with the resulting imposition of nearly

USD 4 billion in “repeat offender” fines; and

the imposition of “repeat offender” fines on Yukos when the conduct that was
punished occurred prior to the determination by the courts that the conduct was

wrongful; for example, the “repeat offender” fine assessed against Yukos for the

See above at paragraphs 504 and 579.

- 255 -

2001 tax year is based on the finding by the courts in 2004 that the conduct in 2000

was wrongful.

758. In reaching its conclusion, the Tribunal has also taken into account the fact that, in February

2007, before Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev had served half of their prison terms, the

Prosecutor General’s Office levelled new charges against them, this time for theft of oil and

funds from Yukos, embezzlement and money laundering.

759. As will be seen in subsequent chapters of this Part VIII of the Award which now follow, the

Tribunal is sustained in this central and all important conclusion by its analysis of other

disturbing facets of the Yukos saga, including:

HARASSMENT, INTIMIDATION AND ARRESTS

1. Introduction

Claimants allege that Respondent carried out a campaign of harassment and intimidation of
Yukos, its management, employees, external advisers and associates with a view to destroying

the company and removing Mr. Khodorkovsky as a political threat:

In what has been described as “a literal orgy of lawlessness”, the Russian Federation instigated and
conducted a campaign of terror aimed at depriving Yukos of its ability to run its business, and thus
facilitating the destruction of the company. This was achieved through an escalating process of
arrests, intimidation, harassment, searches and seizures. The breadth of the campaign, which
targeted not only Yukos and its management but also entities and individuals associated with the
company, and the flagrant violations of due process that characterized the actions of the Russian
Federation, underscore both the ruthlessness with which the Russian Federation sought the
destruction of Yukos and the coordinated nature of the attack.

 

The undeniable effect of the actions described below was to undermine the viability of Yukos,

placing the Russian Federation in a position to carry out the dismantling of the Company..*
Claimants allege that Respondent’s harassment campaign has “continued throughout the time
period at issue in these arbitrations and continues even today,” most notably with a second
round of charges in 2007 against Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev leading to a trial
described as a “travesty of justice” that resulted in a sentence of a further thirteen and a half

years in prison.*”

Respondent for the most part does not question the facts underlying Claimants’ allegations,
though it does question the credibility of some of Claimants’ witness accounts. Rather, the
events described by Claimants as constituting a campaign of “harassment and intimidation” are,

to better ch ized as legiti acts of law undertaken
in full compliance with Russian law and Russian practices as well as standards of other

countries."

In any event, Respondent considers the events complained of to be largely irrelevant to the
Tribunal’s enquiry in these arbitrations. That is because Article 26 of the ECT limits the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction to disputes alleging the breach of an obligation under Part III of the
ECT, of which Articles 10(1) and 13 are directed only to investments, and afford no personal

protection for nationals. Respondent observes that “the alleged violations of the human rights
of Messrs. Khodorkovsky, Lebedev and others... are outside the scope of this Tribunal’s
jurisdiction, unless Claimants can establish that any such violations directly impaired the
management or operation of their investments.”*'' Respondent argues Claimants have failed to
2

do so,‘ and that the prosecutions of Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev did not destroy

Yukos. To the contrary, Yukos exceeded its 2003 performance in 2004."

The Tribunal recognizes that it is not a human rights court. Nevertheless, it is within the scope
of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to consider the allegations of harassment and intimidation as they
form part of the factual matrix of Claimants’ complaints that the Russian Federation violated its
obligations under Part III of the ECT. The Tribunal’s task includes determining whether the
Russian Federation “in any way impair[ed] by unreasonable or discriminatory measures
[Claimants’] management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal” of its investment, or
subjected Claimants’ investment to measures having the effect equivalent to an expropriation.
In the context of that inquiry, the Tribunal will set out the evidentiary record with respect to the

alleged “campaign of harassment and intimidation.”

2. Chronology of Facts

(a) Yukos Grows; Mr. Khodorkovsky Becomes More Politically Engaged; Yukos
Leaders Receive Warnings

Claimants allege that by early 2003 “Mikhail Khodorkovsky’s participation in the social policy
and political spheres in Russia, coupled with Yukos’ growing economic power, came to be
perceived as a threat by the Russian authorities.”*"*

As already noted in Chapter VIII.B above, President Putin’s former Chief Economic Advisor,
Dr. Illarionov alleged in his witness statement that around late 2002, a “special unit was set up
at the General Prosecutor’s office, comprised of approximately 50 people and working

815

exclusively on fabricating evidence against Mr. Khodorkovsky and Yukos. The special unit

came up with approximately 15 possible theories to justify Mr. Khodorkovsky’s arrest, amongst
them “tax evasion schemes allegedly set up either for Mr. Khodorkovsky’s personal benefit or
for the benefit of Yukos.”*'® Upon cross-examination, Dr. Illarionov declined to identify his
source, a “high-placed official in the Russian Administration at the time” who still lives in
Moscow, out of concerns for the official’s safety.*"” Dr. Ilarionov testified that the official told
him the unit had “been created to ‘zanyatsa’ Khodorkovsky... ‘take care of”
Khodorkovsky .. which means one day some kind of security services and officers did receive
an order so-called to solve the problem.”*'*

The turning point, according to Claimants, was a meeting at the Kremlin between President
Putin and the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs on 19 February 2003, to which
the Tribunal has referred earlier, at which Mr. Khodorkovsky delivered a speech about
corruption in Russia.*!? President Putin responded by alluding to some companies, including
Yukos, having accumulated considerable wealth from non-payment of tax, and thus told
Mr. Khodorkovsky that he was “passing the puck back to you.” At this point, according to

821

Dr. Illarionov, the tone became “steely and menacing, and from then on, the “gloves were
off.’*? The Tribunal has observed earlier in this Award that the Russian authorities,
particularly in the ZATOs, were questioning the legality of Yukos’ tax optimization scheme
prior to the February 2003 meeting and that this meeting was not a “turning point” in terms of

“3 Nevertheless the record does show

that from around the time of the February 2003 meeting, the Russian authorities escalated the

intensity and extent of their investigations into Yukos and associated individuals and entities.

opposition parties, including the Communist party, apparently was increasingly of concern to
President Putin. For example, Mr. Dubov testified that President Putin had advised
Mr. Khodorkovsky in April 2003 to restrict his political activities and not to finance the

Communists.“

Similarly, former Prime Minister Kasyanov testified to the ECtHR that a
conversation with President Putin had left him in no doubt that “by funding the communists
Khodorkovsky had crossed a line so far as Putin was concerned and that the criminal
prosecution case of Yukos employees was started exactly because of the funding of political
parties not sanctioned by Putin.”*”°

Mr. Khodorkovsky’s close business associate, Mr. Leonid Nevzlin, testified that in the Spring
of 2003 the then Media Minister met him for lunch and informed him that “the decision had
been taken to seize Yukos, and that [President Putin’s deputy chiefs of staff] would not stop at

826 From this,

anything in order to achieve that end, including arresting Khodorkovsky.
Mr. Nevzlin received the message that Mr. Khodorkovsky should put an end to his criticism of
President Putin and his administration, “otherwise he could lose everything.” Mr. Nevzlin
reported warnings from other sources at the time, including Sibneft’s Roman Abramovich
saying President Putin told him he “would like to see Mr. Khodorkovsky’s bottom on a prison
bench” and Federation Council members telling Mr. Nevzlin that Mr. Khodorkovsky “could

face problems should he stay in Russia.”*””

(b) Prosecutor General Launches Investigations Involving Searches and Seizures

From June 2003, the Office of the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation launched a
series of investigations against various members of Yukos’ management, most prominently
among them Mr. Khodorkovsky and Mr. Platon Lebedev (GML director and close associate of
Mr. Khodorkovsky).** Mr. Lebedev was arrested on his hospital bed on 2 July 2003 on

charges of fraud, embezzlement and tax evasion.” Two days later, Messrs. Khodorkovsky and

Nevzlin were summoned for questioning in what Mr. Nevzlin described as an “absurd”
investigation.” That same day, the Russian authorities raided the office of the registrar of
Yukos’ shares and confiscated documents.“*!

On 11 July 2003, the Russian authorities conducted the first large-scale raid on Yukos. Yukos”

then Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Bruce Misamore, describes it as:

an incredible scene full of armed, masked officers—during which they trawled through our
computer records for approximately 17 hours. This was to begin a wave of raids on
Yukos’ Moscow headquarters and other companies affiliated with Yukos by investigative
officers . . . sometimes accompanied by . . . heavily armed police officers."
Yukos group Financial Controller, Mr. Frank Rieger, also recounts the raids on the accounting
department, which started from July 2003. He describes how the staff was forced to stop work
during the raid, that a Deputy Chief Accountant had been told by the authorities that they
“knew that she had grandchildren, a dacha etc and that she had better tell them what they
wanted to hear,” another staff member resigned having been told by the prosecutors it would be
best for him, and that the authorities regularly seized “lorry loads of documents” in an

unsystematic fashion, without leaving copies or any record of the documents seized.***

According to Mr. Misamore, the loss of key documents “created great difficulties not only in

»S4 Mr. Misamore

managing the company, but in preparing the annual financial statements.
elaborated that “these raids with the guys in their balaclavas and their AK47s coming in and
harassing our employees, taking original documents away from our offices, not leaving us with
any copies, we couldn’t even accomplish accounting.... We lost our entire U.S. GAAP
consolidation accounting group by the end of 2004: they all left the company because they
didn’t want to be harassed.”*** Steven Theede, who joined Yukos as Chief Operating Office in

August 2003 noted that by the end of 2003:

It was obvious that . . . the Government was out to get us; it was that simple. The number
of raids we had in the office, police coming and charging through our accounting
department, knocking computers off desks, . . . tipping desks up on their side. I had four
men in black masks outside my office with machine guns once, trying to get in.**°

Following the arrest of Mr. Lebedev, the Board of Directors of Yukos set up a temporary
ad hoc committee to assess the situation and potential risks related to the arrest, which was
chaired by Mr. Jacques Kosciusko-Morizet, then chair of the Board’s Audit Committee.**”
Mr. Kosciusko-Morizet testified (over Respondent’s objection) about Mr. Khodorkovsky’s
appearance before the ad hoc committee in August 2003.** Although Mr. Khodorkovsky
initially assured the Board that “everything is fine,” Mr. Kosciusko-Morizet pressed him for

“some explanation” and recounted his response to the Tribunal:

He said the following, ‘I’m in touch with generals from the FSB’ [the successor of the
KGB] .. . ‘They want a kompromat.’ . . . ‘kompromat’, which is a Soviet word... A
kompromat is a document which gives you leverage on somebody, and practically forces
him or her to follow whatever instructions he or she is given. And we asked, ‘What kind
of kompromat do they mean?’ ‘Well’, he said, ‘all I have to do is write two lines: I
committed criminal deeds.” And then I said, ‘And what will happen if you sign such a
kompromat?’ He said, ‘Nothing. They will just keep it, and from time to time I’ll receive a
phone call asking me for some favour.’ And I asked again, ‘But for Yukos—so will you
sign it?’ . . . He said, ‘No, I don’t want to live like that with my children.’ And then I said,
“But under the assumption that you would sign it, what would happen?’ And his words
were, ‘Well, if I would sign such a two-line letter, the problems of Yukos would disappear
faster than it takes to switch off the light in this room.’ . . . And I did not leave this meeting
in a very optimistic mood on future events. And indeed two months later he was in jail, in
pre-trial detention. He did not sign the kompromat.*

Dr. Illarionov testifies that in September 2003 he met with Mr. Khodorkovsky to tell him he was
in danger and it would be preferable for him to leave Russia. Mr. Khodorkovsky reportedly
replied that he did not feel he had committed any offence and did not want to leave Russia.”

In early October 2003, the authorities conducted raids at the home of Mr. Lebedev, the offices
of GML Management Services SA, and a boarding school for disadvantaged children

sponsored by Yukos.“! Further raids were conducted in the office of Mr. Lebedev’s lawyer, a

move criticized by the Moscow Bar Association at the time.“

(c) Arrest and Trial of Mr. Khodorkovsky; Flight from Russia of His Associates

On 25 October 2003, Mr. Khodorkovsky was arrested at gunpoint by an armed special forces
unit in a Siberian airport, and taken to Moscow where he was charged with economic crimes
including fraud, tax evasion and embezzlement.“ He was detained for over ten years until his
much publicized release on 20 December 2013.“ According to Claimants, the arrest “paved
the way for the subsequent actions of the Russian Federation, which eventually resulted in the
dismantling of Yukos.”"“* The ECtHR, in its judgment of 31 May 2011, criticized the manner
of Mr. Khodorkovsky’s arrest, the denial of bail, violations of due process and attorney-client
privilege, and the subjection of Mr. Khodorkovsky to inhuman and degrading treatment in his

pre-trial detention."

Mr. Yuri Schmidt, a criminal lawyer who has acted for Mr. Khodorkovsky, testifies that never
before in his 50 years of experience had he “seen the Russian State undertake such coordinated,
systematic and intense efforts, and deploy such huge resources, against a person accused of an

alleged economic offense.”“"” Respondent chose not to cross-examine Mr. Schmidt.

In response to a question from a member of the Tribunal, Dr. Illarionov testified about a
conversation he had with President Putin shortly after the arrest of Mr. Khodorkovsky.
According to Dr. Illarionov, President Putin explained that Mr. Khodorkovsky had “behave[d]
badly” and stopped “cooperating,” for example by negotiating with an American oil company

about a possible merger and supporting the Communist Party in advance of the Duma elections.

The Parties agree that Mr. Khodorkovsky’s release has no impact whatsoever on the present arbitration proceedings.
See Claimants’ Letter to the Tribunal of 24 January 2014 (“The Claimants submit that Mr. Khodorkovsky’s pardon by
the President of the Russian Federation and his release from prison . . . have no impact whatsoever on the present
proceedings”); and Respondent’s Letter to the Tribunal of 24 January 2014 (“Mr. Khodorkovsky’s pardon itself has no
effect on these proceedings”). Claimants further point out that the pardon entailed no admission of guilt by
Mr. Khodorkovsky. Respondent further points out that the pardon had no effect on Mr. Khodorkovsky’s criminal
convictions or the findings by Russian courts with respect to tax evasion by Yukos. The Tribunal also notes that
Mr. Lebedev was released after his sentence was reduced by the Russian Supreme Court on 23 January 2014. See

Following these actions, President Putin decided to “step aside” and allow Mr. Khodorkovsky

»8 Dr. Illarianov also recalled that there was wide

to fend for himself against “the boys.
“public outrage” in the mass media. The then Prime Minister, Mr. Mikhail Kasyanov, publicly
disapproved of the arrest. Dr. Illarionov referred to President Putin’s order that “I would ask
everybody in the Government to shut up on Mr. Khodorkovsky’s arrest,” and it was very clear
to him that this comment was addressed to Mr. Kasyanov, who was later removed from his

position.”

Mr. Dubov testifies that a Kremlin official informed him on 27 October 2003 that his name had
been struck off the list of candidates running for the Duma, at the direction of President
Putin.*’ At the Hearing Mr. Dubov elaborated on the conversation he had with the Kremlin
official, to whom he had asked “What will happen to Yukos?” Mr. Dubov received the answer
“Yukos will be taken away from you gentlemen” and that there would be criminal claims

against every single shareholder.**!

He was told President Putin had “gone berserk over
Khodorkovsky.” Upon advice from the official, Mr. Dubov left Russia that night and has never
returned. Mr. Nevzlin also left Russia late in 2003 and has not returned since. Shortly
thereafter Mr. Dubov, Mr. Nevzlin and Mr. Brudno were charged with embezzlement and

money  laundering.**?

International arrest warrants were issued in January 2004 for
Messrs. Nevzlin and Dubov, the day after Mr. Nevzlin announced their joint support for a

presidential candidate opposing President Putin.***

On 3 November 2003, Mr. Khodorkovsky resigned as CEO of Yukos. In that connection,
Respondent submits that he resigned voluntarily and that, shortly thereafter, Yukos confirmed
that it had “a strong management team in place”, that it was “continuing to operate” and that it

was “business as usual” following Mr. Khodorkovsky’s resignation.““* However, raids and

arrests at the offices and homes of Yukos-connected personnel continued over the ensuing

allege that Yukos’ auditors, PwC, were targeted and harassed because of their association with

Yukos,**° an issue discussed in more detail below in Chapter VIII.H.

(d) Complaints of Further Harassment and Intimidation of Yukos Executives,
Employees, Lawyers and External Advisers

Claimants have also referred the Tribunal to the interrogations and arrests of in-house and
external lawyers for Yukos and Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev.*” Their telephones were
put under surveillance. In his witness statement, Mr. Schmidt recounts that the treatment of
some lawyers acting for Yukos personnel included threats, harsh interrogations and beatings
requiring hospitalization, leading some local and international bar associations to voice their
deep concerns.** Mr. Schmidt himself recounts incidents of intimidation against him,
including disbarment and libel suits.**”

Mr. Schmidt observes that “the timing of the attacks on the lawyers acting for
Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev and on Yukos’ lawyers and personnel was always
meticulously calculated to correspond to the critical stages in the dismantlement of Yukos.”*”
Thus, at a time when Yukos was deeply engaged in its defense of tax proceedings brought
against it, the Head of Yukos’ Legal Department, Mr. Gololobov, was arrested and his

computers and documents confiscated. In July 2004, at the time of the enforcement

a Saturday afternoon, confiscating computer servers. At the time of the forced sale of YNG in

December 2004, there were further raids on Yukos offices and personnel
carried out in the offices of Yukos’ external lawyers, ALM Feldmans, who also faced an

extensive audit of their own after the search.

On 31 May 2005, the Meshchansky Court of the city of Moscow sentenced
Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev to nine years in prison on charges of fraud and tax
evasion, following a trial that was widely criticized for its lack of due process.“ Mr. Schmidt,
himself intimately involved with the trial, stated he had never seen “such a mockery of justice
and violations of the most basic standards of due process and fundamental rights, including the
right to a fair trial, at all stages of a case.”* Similar observations were made by Russian and

international media outlets and opposition parties within Russia.“ Messrs. Khodorkovsky and

 

Lebedev were transferred to Siberia to serve their sentences in remote penal colonies, and their
sentences were reduced on appeal to 8 years, which Claimants maintain was in violation of

Russian law at the time.*®

Meanwhile, a number of Yukos associates who had fled Russia were subject to extradition
requests from the Russian Federation, none of which were granted by the courts of the countries
where they were residing. Mr. Nevzlin mentioned his trial in absentia and Israel’s refusal to
extradite him to Russia.*® In 2005 and 2007, courts in the United Kingdom refused to extradite
former financial and business managers of Yukos, on the basis that the prosecutions were “so
politically motivated that there is a substantial risk that the Judges of the Moscow City court
would succumb to political interference in a way which would call into question their

independence.”*”’ Courts in Lithuania, Cyprus and the Czech Republic also refused to extradite

former Yukos managers or former Yukos service providers on the basis of the political

dimensions of the underlying requests.**

In late 2003, most of the shares in Yukos held by Claimants Hulley and YUL were seized by
the Russian courts and remained frozen until the liquidation of Yukos in November 2007.5
The shares owned by Claimant Veteran, which were held in a Swiss bank account, were also
subject to an asset freeze following a request for mutual legal assistance from the Russian
Federation to Switzerland. However, in June 2004, the Swiss Federal Tribunal overturned the
freeze orders and released the shares. Over the following years, the Swiss courts were also
engaged in mutual legal assistance requests for searches and seizures of documents of various
Yukos-related entities, culminating in the Swiss Federal Tribunal expressing the view that the
case against Mr. Khodorkovsky was politically motivated and “orchestrated by the regime in
power with a view to subordinating the class of rich ‘oligarchs’ and eliminating potential or
sworn political opponents.”*”

By late 2004, many mid-level Yukos managers and employees had been arrested, questioned or
put on wanted lists, generating an atmosphere of pressure. Several of the remaining senior
executives decided not to return to Russia.*” In August 2006, the Russian Prosecutor General’s
office announced criminal investigations against senior level executives, including
Messrs. Misamore and Theede. Mr. Misamore, noting he had never been formally notified of
the charges, considers that they were part of a “general campaign to intimidate those associated
with Yukos.”*” Mr. Rieger also testified about being interrogated by the Russian Prosecutor
General’s Office, when he was presented with a series of questions for which the investigator

had already prepared his answers. He described this as:

a kind of never expected story. And if I wouldn’t have been the witness of such an event, I

couldn’t believe this: being called as a witness, arriving, and seeing, “Here, Mr Rieger,

We'd like to talk to you today. These are the questions, and wouldn't you mind to look at

this document? . ... I think this is what you'd like to say to us.”
Mr. Rieger refused to sign and was kept for eight hours of questioning. The next morning, the
German Embassy advised him to leave the country. He has not returned to Russia since
May 2006.°" Similarly, Mr. Theede was advised by the U.S. State Department that it was not

safe for him to return to Russia.*”°

By the time bankruptcy proceedings had started against Yukos at the end of March 2006,
approximately 35 senior managers, employees and in-house counsel of Yukos had been
interrogated, arrested and/or sentenced.’ At that time, Mr. Theede appointed Vasily
Aleksanyan as Executive Vice President of Yukos to serve as the main point of contact for the
bankruptcy.*”” Shortly afterwards, on 6 April 2006, Mr. Aleksanyan was arrested at home by
masked and armed men and charged with embezzlement allegedly committed when he was

head of the Yukos legal department.‘

A few months after his detention, he was diagnosed
with lymphoma and AIDS. It is alleged that he was offered medical treatment and freedom in
return for evidence against Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev, an offer which he refused.*”
He remained in pre-trial detention for almost three years in conditions described by Russia’s

own human rights council as “simply monstrous.”**

His treatment was criticized by the
ECtHR, whose initial interim measures were ignored by the Russian Federation, but after the
ECtHR issued a final judgment, the authorities released Mr. Aleksanyan on bail (for USD 1.8
million) and finally dropped charges against him due to the statute of limitations.**' Claimants’

(e) Second Trial of Mr. Khodorkovsky; Allegations of Continuing Harassment
and Intimidation

In February 2007, before Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev had served half of their prison
terms, the Prosecutor-General’s Office levelled new charges against them, this time for theft of

oil and funds from Yukos, embezzlement and money laundering.**°

Claimants describe the second trial as a “travesty of justice,” a view shared by international
organizations and human rights NGOs such as the International Bar Association and Amnesty
International.**° Before the verdict was issued, President Putin responded to a question during
his annual televised address that: “It is my conviction that a ‘thief should be in jail.’... we

must start from the fact that Khodorkovsky’s guilt has been proved in court.”**”

On 27 December 2010, Judge Danilkin issued his verdict finding Messrs. Khodorkovsky and
Lebedev guilty of charges of embezzlement and money laundering. He sentenced them to the

maximum penalty requested by the prosecution, thirteen and a half years. The verdicts were

widely criticized. Judge Danilkin questioned over 90 fact witnesses and reviewed an
extensive documentary record. His verdict focused on a holding that in the period 1996-2003,
Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev “stole” the entire oil output of the Yukos production
entities, concealed the fact that the oil was “stolen” both from Yukos’ shareholders and the
Russian tax authorities, orchestrated the “theft” through Lesnoy and Trekhgorny entities, which
led to tax evasion, and then “laundered” the proceeds of the “theft.” Judge Danilkin rejected all

of Mr. Khodorkovsky’s arguments, including those relating to double jeopardy.*”

Within a few months, the 689-page verdict was upheld on appeal, a decision noted with
concern by the European Parliament, which condemned “political interference with the trial."
Russia’s own Human Rights Council reviewed the second criminal case at the request of then
President Medvedev. The Council issued a report in December 2011 which concluded that the
trial was unlawful and should be annulled. The author of the report told local media there was
“no evidence or substance behind the accusations of embezzlement,’ and that
Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev had received “punishment for carrying out legal

9891

activities. Other members of the Council described the verdict as “profoundly unjust”,

“contradictory, arbitrary and malicious,” “illegal,” containing “numerous legal errors and

. «oe . 9
inaccuracies” and selectively prosecuted.*”

and tax evasion are the same crimes because taxes, as per their theory, were paid on the stolen oil, are unsustainable.
Taxes were paid on profit, and the organized group participants stole property in the form of oil. Profit is not Property
because it is a calculated accounting value which is a difference between income and expenses. It is impossible to steal
figures, which exist in accounting records, but it is possible to commit theft of oil, which is a material value, which is
property. Relations concerning the making of tax payments (taxes) to the budget are the object of a tax offence (crime)

While relations concerning right, title, and interest in certain property are the object of embezzlement (theft) . . .”).

addresses (a) the credibility of Claimants’ allegations of a campaign of harassment and
intimidation, (b) the characterization of such events in the context of the Russian Federation’s
law enforcement efforts against Yukos’ tax optimization scheme and (c) the actual impact of

the events on Claimants’ investment.

(a) Are Claimants’ Allegations about a Campaign of Harassment Credible?

Respondent does not deny that the investigations, searches, seizures, arrests, interrogations and
criminal trials took place. Respondent’s main defence to the allegations is not that they are not
true, but that the events complained of were legitimate and justified for purposes of law

enforcement, that they were in line with practice in Russia and other countries, and that in any

event they were not expropriatory and did not impair Claimants’ investment."

There are, however, some portions of the witness testimony with which Respondent takes issue.

Respondent contends that Claimants’ “conspiracy theory relies heavily on circumstantial

evidence and sheer innuendo, attributable to the Oligarchs’ public relations and lobbying

campaign.”** Respondent argues that:

if the assessments and the subsequent enforcement measures were the product of a massive
political conspiracy spanning several years and implemented by hundreds if not thousands
of officials, including no fewer than 60 judges at four different levels of courts, along with
a large cast of third parties worldwide, then surely, after nearly a decade of vigorous
challenges, at least one document referring to this purported conspiracy would have
surfaced, or one disgruntled conspirator would have reported having participated in it.
Conspicuously, Claimants have offered no such evidence at all. To the contrary, they rely
on double and triple hearsay renditions of purported conversations, provided by vocal
opponents of the Russian Government, inaccurate and uninformed reports by political
commentators, and mere speculation."

Respondent also argues that “Claimants’ hearing testimony on this issue is not credible, in light

of its reliance on those who stand to gain billions of dollars if Claimants prevail.”*°°
For example, Respondent decries Dr. Illarionov’s testimony about a special unit established to

come up with a theory to put Mr. Khodorkovsky away as “rank hearsay of the most grotesque

sort, because Dr. Illarionov declined to identify the person who supposedly told him that.”*°”

Respondent described Dr. Illarionov’s report as “manifestly not credible” because he had said
nothing about it for seven years, and because he continued to serve President Putin for more
than two years after hearing that report.”***
The Tribunal found Dr. Illarionov to be a credible and convincing witness. He offered a
satisfactory explanation for protecting the source of his information about the special unit. The
Tribunal does not consider his evidence impeached merely because he had not come forward
earlier with his evidence about the special unit nor that he stayed for a certain period in his

position working for the President.

Similarly, Respondent attacks the credibility of Mr. Nevzlin’s testimony on the basis that he

had waited until 2010 to disclose certain facts, such as what Mr. Abramovich had told him

899

about Mr. Khodorkovsky being targeted for political reasons." When pressed as to why he

had not disclosed the information in the earlier Russian criminal proceedings or the ECtHR

proceedings, Mr. Nevzlin gave the following explanations: °°

[I]f I had spread the information about Abramovich and Putin fairly broadly, and if it had
become available to the public, then from the perspective of Khodorkovsky, who is in
Russian prison, I would have damaged him.... I would have caused him tremendous
amounts of harm. ... in the other corner facing him were Putin, Sechin and others; but I
also would have turned Abramovich into an enemy of Khodorkovsky by disclosing this
information.

 

[After] things moved to a second absurd set of charges and a second trial, Khodorkovsky’s
position changed radically. He was no longer wary of a political . . . confrontation with
Putin’s regime because he realised that he was not going to be able to find truth in a
Russian court if he tried to defend himself based on the laws . . .

Russian courts have no interest in my position: it would be either ignored or rejected by
them. Because it’s not a judge who makes decision on Khodorkovsky and Lebedev; the
judge just rubber-stamps decisions that are made by investigative committee and
Prosecutor’s Office... . The fact that I trust this court and tell this court a lot more than
I’ve ever said on the matter, this is a typical position for me, because . . . if we're able to
defend our interests, that would be either in courts in free countries or international courts.

The Tribunal accepts Mr. Nevzlin’s explanations. The Tribunal notes again that the Russian
Federation called no fact witnesses of their own to contradict or weaken the testimony of
Claimants’ fact witnesses. Respondent chose not to cross-examine Mr. Schmidt, simply noting
instead that as he was Mr. Khodorkovsky’s criminal lawyer his statement is “special
95901

pleading. Respondent also chose not to cross-examine Dr. Kovalev, whose evidence,

accordingly, also stands unchallenged.

During the Hearing on the Merits, the Chairman of the Tribunal invited Respondent’s

counsel:

to address the allegations of harassment: Rieger being presented by the Prosecutor's
Office with a statement, “Just sign here on the bottom line”; the number of Yukos
employees who were detained; Misamore, who was told “You shouldn’t go back to
Russia”; the campaign to make life impossible for Yukos-related officials, officers? That
stands uncontradicted on the record right now. And it bothers us, my colleagues and me,
and we would like to hear from the Respondent in respect of these matters.
With respect to Mr. Rieger, Respondent’s counsel pointed out that the incident had occurred in
2006, several years after the arrest of Mr. Khodorkovsky and that “it’s not atypical that an
investigatory agency would have an idea of what they think a witness does or doesn’t know,
and might suggest to that [witness] what that evidence is and then find out from the witness
whether they agree with it or disagree with it. Mr. Rieger said he didn’t agree, and he didn’t
sign it.” The Chairman recalled: “He was threatened, he was detained at the airport. This is
background that speaks about the atmosphere. The Russian authorities are seen as being out to
get Yukos.” Respondent’s counsel explained that: “I think that what you are seeing is the
authorities having established that there was quite substantial fraud at many, many different
levels of activity within a large company.”
The Tribunal accepts the evidence of Claimants’ witnesses who testified with respect to the
campaign of harassment and intimidation conducted by Respondent against Yukos. The

Tribunal will now turn to the nature and consequences of the events described above.

(b) Were the Actions of the Russian Federation Justified as Legitimate Law
Enforcement Measures?

Respondent explains that its actions were consistent with a legitimate wide-scale investigation
as part of “an attempt to enforce and try to understand what turned out to be one of the largest
frauds in the experience of the modern Russian State.””’ Thus, in response to Mr. Kosciusko-
Morizet’s evidence recounting Mr. Khodorkovsky’s kKompromat, Respondent observes that this
“is absolutely consistent with the fact that the authorities had valid grounds to bring criminal

charges against Mr. Khodorkovsky.”

Likewise, Respondent describes as “no surprise” that
Mr. Dubov would have been advised to leave the country and warned that every shareholder of
Yukos would face criminal charges. Respondent states that this is “not inconsistent with the
unbroken thread of tax evasion in which Yukos engaged and for which it was held to
account."
In a similar vein, while acknowledging the unfortunate circumstances surrounding
Mr. Aleksanyan’s illness, Respondent remarked that “it is not shocking” that the Russian
authorities were interested in Mr. Aleksanyan, given his role since 2001 in suppressing

information about vulnerabilities of Yukos in the low-tax regions.”””

Respondent argues that the “searches of Yukos offices and the seizures of its records as part of
Russian law enforcement authorities’ investigations have parallels in other countries as proper
instruments of law enforcement, especially when those authorities are faced with the types of
egregious violations in which Yukos engaged.” Respondent cites the EU and the U.S. as
jurisdictions that authorize expansive and aggressive, even armed, searches and seizures to

wp eg
combat financial crimes.”

Transcript, Day 19 at 50 (Respondent’s closing).

Respondent’s Post-Hearing Brief § 209-10. For example, in the European Union, companies are often subjected to
“dawn raids”, in which EU officials, without prior judicial authorization, conduct searches and seizures. See
Transcript, Day 19 at 49-50 (Respondent’s closing) (“[I]n the United States a search warrant is never executed
unarmed; it’s always executed by armed officers, sometimes wearing other gear that sug;
simple commercial exercise. That’s the way it happens. In Rt
practice. It doesn’t reflect or project anything unique to Yukos.”). Claimants however point to the “very exacting
standard of proof” at the ECtHR requiring “incontrovertible and direct” evidence, but that the ECtHR nevertheless
accepted that “the circumstances surrounding the applicants’ criminal case may be interpreted as supporting the
applicants’ claim of improper motives” and that “it is clear that the authorities were trying to reduce political influence

811.

As for the convictions of Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev in 2005, Respondent asserts that
Claimants have not criticized the conduct of the Russian appellate judges who upheld the

9

convictions.” Respondent points to the ECtHR as having “rejected the central premise of

Claimants’ argument that Mr. Khodorkovsky was prosecuted in 2005 for political or other
improper reasons.””"”

With respect to the second criminal trial of Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev, Respondent
notes that it “had no effect on the investments at issue in these arbitrations and that, regardless,
Claimants have not contested the factual bases of the charges in that trial. Their attempt to
portray the charges as concerning the physical theft of oil, rather than complicated schemes of
corporate abuse and sham auctions to secure underpayments of oil purchased from Yukos”
subsidiaries for the Oligarchs’ benefit, is manifestly baseless.””'' Respondent contends that the
IBA Report was prepared without access to the full court file and without any knowledge of
Russian criminal law, and that other criticisms reported by Claimants were biased and

ill-informed.

Respondent also contends that its actions were necessary due to Yukos’ attempts to obstruct

Russia’s investigative efforts.”'”

Claimants deny that Yukos was obstructing the investigation,
and note that most of the evidence relied upon by Respondent was based on interrogation
records of individuals that Respondent has failed to put forward as witnesses. Claimants urge
the Tribunal to treat the interrogation records with skepticism, “[g]iven the campaign of terror
being waged against persons associated with Yukos and the relentless pressure deployed by the
prosecutors to get Yukos’ former employees or other Yukos-related persons to give false
incriminating evidence against Yukos and Yukos’ management.””"?

The Tribunal accepts that the Russian Federation had the power to conduct searches and
seizures in Yukos’ premises during the ongoing criminal investigations. Nevertheless, having

reviewed the record, the Tribunal finds that the investigation of Yukos was carried out by the

 

 

of ‘oligarchs’ and that the State was one of the main beneficiaries of the dismantlement of Yukos.” See Khodorkov:
v. Russia 2 4] 634-48, 931-32; and Claimants’ submissions dated 30 August 2013 {| 47 concerning that judgment.

Russian Federation with excessive harsk Respondent’s counsel acknowledged that in the
context of the large-scale fraud investigation “not everything is pretty in those circumstances, and
we may each of us have circumstances that we would regret or have done differently””'* The
Tribunal considers “not pretty” to be an understatement in this case. The treatment of Yukos
senior executives, mid-level employees, in-house counsel, external lawyers and related entities
as described in this chapter support Claimants’ central submission that the Russian authorities
were conducting a “ruthless campaign to destroy Yukos, appropriate its assets and eliminate

Mr. Khodorkovsky as a political opponent.”’!®

The legal consequences of Claimants’
submission will be analyzed later in Part X of this Award when the Tribunal considers the

alleged violations of Chapter III of the ECT.

The Tribunal will now examine the effect on Yukos, as a matter of fact, of the campaign of

harassment and intimidation waged against it by Respondent.

(c) Did the Events Complained of Impact Claimants’ Investments or was Yukos
Able to Carry on Unaffected?

Having noted that the record is replete with evidence of intimidation and harassment of Yukos
personnel by the Russian authorities, the key question for the Tribunal is whether such
intimidation and harassment actually disrupted Yukos’ operations and thus adversely affected

Claimants’ investment.

Claimants maintain that the harassment and intimidation campaign “crippled” Yukos by
prosecuting its management and paralyzing its operations through massive raids and seizures

with a view to undermining the viability of Yukos.

Claimants’ witnesses spoke of the impact that the searches, seizures and, generally, the
campaign of intimidation had on the company. As noted earlier, Mr. Misamore testified that
the loss of key documents created difficulties in running the company and preparing the annual
financial statements.”° Mr. Rieger stated that 60 to 70 percent of the accounting department’s
documents were confiscated. He explained in his witness statement: “[w]hen you take into

account the fact that all the day to day business operations of the company were reflected in

paperwork, such as invoices, bills, efc., we soon reached a stage where Yukos employees didn’t
have access to the basic data they needed to perform their functions.” He recalled that “[t]he

constant threats and harassment caused many of my former colleagues to leave the company

and, in the worst case, the country; a fate that I would soon share.”?!7

Mr. Misamore described how staff retention became extremely difficult for Yukos. For
example, he said that in the GAAP section of the accounting department “they all left the
company because they didn’t want to be harassed.”°'* Similarly, in defending the company’s

decision to pay bonuses in 2004, Mr. Theede testified that:

[I]t was a Stalinesque-type of environment there. It was a fearful kind of a place to have to
work, We never knew when we were going to have another raid, and people would come
in and, as I said yesterday, knock computers off the desks, tip desks over, and just
roughneck through the place; or when someone would be called in for questioning to the
Prosecutor’s Office with totally unknown and illogical results. And in that kind of an
environment, Yukos was not a particularly friendly place to work. We had huge concerns
about retaining our employees. And if we didn’t meet contractual obligations to them to
pay the bonuses, it was our view that they would begin to leave. And so it was in that light
that we felt it was really very important that we lived up to the obligations we had to these
people, just so we could retain them and so that we could continue to operate the company.
Because if we lost those people, hiring others was going to be almost impossible, because
people just—it was a scary place to be, and to bring new people in—in fact, I don’t really
recall us being able to hire any new employees after the attack started . . .°!°

2003.”! Respondent points to the following evidence in the record:

e The working group set up to deal study the effect of the government’s actions confirmed
that as at August 2003, despite the searches and seizures, “[o]perational activities [were]
proceeding normally” and as at September 2003 “there had been no new adverse

” ps “bys 99922
developments” and it was “business as usual”

e Yukos stated on a conference call with financial analysts in November 2003 that
Mr. Khodorkovsky’s arrest and subsequent resignation had “no impact whatsoever on [its]

operations”?

e Some 16 months later, Yukos stated to investors and the press that it “was extremely

healthy.

39924

e = The January-March 2004 internal Yukos newsletter publishing 2003 operational results of

Yukos shows that the Company was not disrupted.””°

The Tribunal views these statements of Yukos officers pertaining to the well-being of the
company as an attempt by Yukos to project to its investors an image of stability and thus
maintain their confidence. It is obvious to the Tribunal that a company which was targeted in
the way Yukos was during those many years had to be severely affected and that its operations
could not be managed by its officers and other employees in the normal and usual manner. In
short, the Tribunal agrees with Claimants that, as a matter of fact, Respondent’s aggressive

campaign against Yukos impacted significantly the management of the company.

Having reviewed the abundant evidence in the record of the intimidation and harassment of
Yukos’ senior executives, mid-level employees, in-house counsel and external lawyers by the
Russian authorities, the Tribunal is convinced that such intimidation and harassment not only
disrupted the operations of Yukos but also contributed to its demise and thereby damaged

Claimants’ investment.

The Tribunal will now turn its attention to another chapter in Claimants’ litany of conduct by

the Russian Federation alleged to have negatively impacted their investment.

THE UNWINDING OF THE YUKOS-SIBNEFT MERGER
1. Introduction

In April 2003, Yukos, which was then Russia’s largest oil company, announced plans to merge
with Sibneft, then Russia’s fourth largest oil company, into a new entity that would be called

YukosSibneft Oil Company and constitute the world’s fourth largest private oil producer.

Steps were taken to effectuate the merger between April and October 2003. By 3 October
2003, the main components of the transaction (a share purchase and a share exchange between
Yukos’ and Sibneft’s principal shareholders) had been completed. An Extraordinary General
Meeting (“EGM”) of Yukos’ shareholders was scheduled for 28 November 2003 for the
approval of the merger’s final details.”’° However, shortly before the scheduled meeting, the

Sibneft shareholders announced their intention to halt the merger process.”””

Ultimately, the share exchange component of the merger was invalidated through a series of

928

court cases in Moscow and the Russian Far Eastern province of Chukotka, ~~ and Sibneft was

acquired by the Russian Federation through the State-owned company Gazprom.”

Claimants submit that Respondent was responsible for the unwinding of the merger, making it

“one of the first casualties” of the Russian Federation’s assault on Yukos.”””

According to
Claimants, Sibneft’s decision to halt the merger process was the direct result of
Mr. Khodorkovsky’s arrest. The arrest led Sibneft to insist on a change of the senior executives
of the merged entity. This request was not acceptable to Yukos and the deal was aborted.
Claimants also argue that the Russian courts were then “only too happy to lend their assistance”

by invalidating parts of the merger on spurious grounds, paving the way for the Russian

Federation’s acquisition of Sibneft.”*! Claimants’ primary damages claim of USD 114.174
billion reflects the value of YukosSibneft as a successfully merged entity. Alternatively,
Claimants submit that if the Tribunal does not hold Respondent responsible for the unwinding

of the merger, the damages claim should be reduced by approximately USD 6 billion.°”

Respondent denies any responsibility for the unwinding of the merger. Sibneft, Respondent
argues, was neither exercising governmental authority nor acting under the instructions of
Russian state organs. The Russian Government in fact supported the merger. Moreover,
Sibneft’s leaders had every right to insist on changes to the management of the merged entity
due to concerns about Mr. Khodorkovsky’s arrest and charges of criminal activities against
him; in so doing, they were acting “in the pursuit of their own legitimate commercial
interests.””* As for the Moscow and Chukotka courts, Respondent submits that they acted in
accordance with Russian company law. Respondent also suggests that Yukos acquiesced in the
court proceedings as they allowed Yukos to cancel the merger without obtaining the approval of

minority shareholders and thus risking further claims being brought against it.”**

In this chapter, the Tribunal will consider the circumstances of the Yukos—Sibneft merger and
seek to determine whether the Russian Federation is responsible for the unwinding of the
merger. The Tribunal’s view on this issue may have an impact on the quantum of damages the
Tribunal may ultimately award Claimants. The Tribunal will also consider in this chapter
whether the merger was an important factor, as Claimants submit, in Yukos’ decision not to
pursue its ADR listing on the NYSE. The Tribunal recalls that Respondent argues that Yukos”
decision was taken because the company had concerns about elements of its tax optimization
scheme. The Tribunal will also consider Yukos’ declaration of a USD 2 billion interim dividend
in November 2003 (“2003 Interim Dividend”), which Respondent argues was intended to shield

this sum from the reach of the Russian tax authorities.”**

2. Chronology

In the context of arguments about the Yukos—Sibneft merger, Respondent has accused

36 while Claimants have accused

Claimants of fighting a “losing battle with the calendar,
Respondent of attempting “to rewrite history”.°°” The Tribunal therefore considers it useful to

lay out a short chronology of key events.

(a) Merger is Announced; NYSE Listing is Put on Hold; Steps are Taken to
Complete Merger

On 22 April 2003, Yukos and Sibneft announced their merger in a press release describing the
principal features of the transaction.’** The merger would be achieved in two parts. Firstly,
Yukos would acquire 20 percent (minus one share) of Sibneft shares from Sibneft’s principal
shareholders for a cash consideration of USD 3 billion pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement
(“Share Purchase Agreement”). Secondly, Yukos would acquire 72 percent (plus one share)
of Sibneft shares from Sibneft’s principal shareholders in exchange for 26.01 percent of the
fully diluted share capital of Yukos pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share
Exchange Agreement”).””

A few days after the merger was announced, President Putin stated that he had approved the
transaction in a meeting with Mr. Khodorkovsky, Mr. Roman Abramovich (a Board member

and significant shareholder of Sibneft) and Mr. Evgeny Shvidler (Sibneft’s CEO).”"°

Concurrently with this announcement, the proposed listing of Yukos on the NYSE, which
Yukos and a team of external advisers had been preparing for over a year, was put on hold. By

then, Yukos and its advisers had conducted an extensive review of the company’s operations

for purposes of drafting the required SEC form." A first draft had been circulated in June

2002 and a near final draft had been circulated on 19 March 2003.”

From April to October 2003, steps were taken to complete the merger. On 30 April 2003,

943

Yukos and Sibneft’s principal shareholders signed the Share Purchase Agreement” and the

Share Exchange Agreement.” The share exchange component of the merger was broken down
into two tranches: the exchange of 57.5 percent of Sibneft shares for newly issued shares in
Yukos representing 17.2 percent of Yukos’ fully diluted share capital and the exchange of
14.5 percent of Sibneft shares for 8.8 percent of Yukos shares (consisting of a mixture of newly

issued shares, treasury shares and shares acquired through a share buy-back).”*°

On 1 May 2003, Yukos’ and Sibneft’s principal shareholders signed a Shareholders’
Agreement, which specified, inter alia, that the Yukos shareholder group would nominate the
“Senior Management Positions.’ On 27 May 2003, Yukos’ shareholders approved the

merger.”

with respect to the merger.” In July and August 2003, regulatory approvals were obtained for
the merger.” On 28 August 2003, Yukos made a further cash payment of USD 500 million
pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement.”*!

On 25 September 2003, the Yukos Board of Directors set 28 November 2003 as the date for the

EGM at which final details for the merger would be submitted to shareholders.*”

On 2 October 2003, Yukos made a final cash payment of USD 1.25 billion pursuant to the

Share Purchase Agreement.”

On 3 October 2003, Yukos acquired 72 percent plus one share of Sibneft shares, in exchange
954

for 26.01 percent of Yukos shares, pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement.
Thus, by 3 October 2003, with both the share purchase and share exchange components of the
transaction complete, Yukos had acquired 92 percent of Sibneft. The remaining steps for
implementing the merger included the “full operational integration” of the two companies,

changing the name of Yukos to YukosSibneft and electing a new board of directors.°**

On 28 October 2003, the Yukos Board of Directors recommended, in view of the capital
restructuring of the company in anticipation of the merger, that shareholders approve the 2003
Interim Dividend of USD 2 billion to all shareholders of record as at 25 September 2003."
Mr. Khodorkovsky resigned as CEO of Yukos on 3 November 2003. Yukos then issued a press
release which named the persons it would nominate to the new management board of the
merged YukosSibneft entity.°’ Mr Khodorkovsky was not on that list. On 21 and
22 November 2003, Yukos and Sibneft senior executives met to discuss the logistics of the

95
merger.°**

In late November, the media reported that Mr. Abramovich had met with President Putin to
discuss the Yukos—Sibneft merger. Reference was made to the fact that “Abramovich is
understood to have raised the prospect of changing the management team of the combined
company with Putin, who welcomed the idea.”

In his witness statement, Mr. Nevzlin narrates that he had met with Mr. Abramovich in “late

2003” in Tel Aviv and that he had been told that

YukosSibneft could be saved if the management of the merged company was transferred to
his team . . . President Putin had told Roman Abramovich that Mikhail Khodorkovsky had
been targeted because of his involvement in politics and . . . was too angry with Mikhail
Khodorkovsky to even discuss his release.”

Shortly before the Yukos EGM scheduled for 28 November 2003, representatives of Sibneft’s
principal shareholders summoned representatives of Yukos’ principal shareholders and advised
them that they no longer wished to proceed with the merger. They asked that steps be taken to

. 9
unwind the merger.”*!

However, the EGM was held as scheduled. The agenda included:
(a) early termination of the powers of board members and election of a new board; (b) approval

of new articles of association (including a name change to YukosSibneft); and (c) payment of

the 2003 Interim Dividend. Claimants voted against the election of Sibneft’s nominees to the
Yukos Board of Directors, abstained on the vote to change the company’s name to

YukosSibneft and voted to approve the dividend.”

After the EGM, Yukos’ principal shareholders proceeded as if the merger was still going

forward. For example, on 2 December 2003, GML issued a press release stating that the

963

merger agreements remained in full effect.” On 8 December 2003, Claimant Hulley received

payment for the 2003 Interim Dividend.* At the same time, Yukos and its principal

shareholders were exploring options to negotiate the unwinding of the merger with Sibneft.°°

Yukos continued to resist Sibneft’s proposal to appoint Sibneft nominees as members of the

merged entity.”

(c) Russian Courts Invalidate the Share Exchange Agreement

On 19 January 2004, a few weeks after Yukos received the 2000 Tax Audit Report, NP Gemini
Holdings Limited and Nimegan Trading Limited, two former Sibneft shareholders,”” applied to
a Moscow court to have the issue of Yukos shares carried out in the context of the first tranche
of the share exchange declared invalid. On 1 March 2004, the Moscow Arbitrazh Court

annulled the share issue.” The decision was upheld on appeal on 31 May 2004 and confirmed

was already a shareholder of Yukos when the Share Exchange Agreement was signed, with less than 0.001 percent of

by the Federal Arbitrazh Court on 26 August 2004.°” Accordingly, in September 2004, Yukos
returned to Sibneft’s shareholders the 57.5 percent shareholding in Sibneft it had received in
exchange for its newly issued shares. Yukos’ shareholding in Sibneft was then reduced to
34.5 percent.”

On 6 July 2004, Nimegan Trading Limited commenced legal proceedings against Yukos and
others before the Arbitrazh Court of Chukotka, the Russian Far Eastern province where
Mr. Abramovich was governor, seeking to have the second tranche of the share exchange
(concerning a 14.5 percent stake in Sibneft) declared invalid. In order to confer jurisdiction to
the Chukotka Court, a defendant related to Mr. Abramovich had opened a bank account in the
Chukotka province on the day that Nimegan paid the filing fee. The other nominal defendants
all supported the court action."”” The Chukotka Arbitrazh Court invalidated the second tranche
of the share exchange on 14 September 2004. After a series of appeals, this decision was
ultimately confirmed by the Federal Arbitrazh Court for the Far-East District in April 2006,°7
following which Yukos returned the 14.5 percent shareholding in Sibneft obtained through the
second tranche of the share exchange to Sibneft’s shareholders. Yukos’ shareholding in Sibneft
was then reduced to the 20 percent minus one share acquired pursuant to the Share Purchase

Agreement.

On 30 September 2004, Yukos commenced an LCIA arbitration against the former principal
shareholders of Sibneft, seeking an injunction prohibiting the respondents from initiating,
continuing or encouraging any proceedings in the Russian courts to invalidate the share
exchange.” Ultimately, the arbitration would be discontinued by Yukos’ Russian bankruptcy

receiver, Mr. Eduard Rebgun.””

The Tribunal notes that the 20 percent minus one shareholding in Sibneft that Yukos had
acquired under the Share Purchase Agreement was sold in Yukos’ bankruptcy auctions in April
2007 to EniNeftegaz, an Italian company,” and that in 2009, Gazprom exercised a call option
(which had been in place since April 2007) to purchase the Sibneft shares from EniNeftegaz for
the sum of USD 4.1 billion.”

3. Parties’ Arguments and Tribunal’s Observations

(a) Was Yukos’ NYSE Listing Put on Hold Because of the Yukos—Sibneft Merger
or Fears of Exposing Yukos’ Tax Optimization Scheme?

Claimants maintain that Yukos’ proposed NYSE listing was put on hold in April 2003 as a

result of the proposed Yukos—Sibneft merger and the need to conduct further due diligence.”

In his witness statement, Mr. Misamore stated that

Yukos’ plan to obtain a Level 2 or 3 ADR listing on the NYSE was put on hold because of
the decision in the beginning of 2003 to merge with Sibneft . . . and the need for further
due diligence with respect to Sibneft to ensure complete transparency and financial
statement accuracy before proceeding with any kind of listing of the merged company.”*!

Mr. Misamore confirmed this statement in his re-direct examination before the Tribunal:

Mr. Khodorkovsky informed me early in 2003 that he was working on a significant
transaction—that turned out to be Sibneft—and he asked me to put the F-1 registration
process on hold. Certainly I could not have gone ahead with an F-1 in a significant
transaction mode anyway. So we put it on hold solely as a result of what subsequently
became the Sibneft transaction.”

Mr. Kosciusko-Morizet also confirmed this explanation when he testified. After referring to

the considerable work done in preparation for the NYSE listing and the extensive disclosure

involved, he said:

So work was pursued during and until the end of the year and the beginning of 2003, and
then in April it was interrupted by the prospect of the Sibneft-Yukos merger, which
obviously was material to any filing. So negotiations were going on, and that prevented
the filing of an ADR 3."

The Tribunal notes that, in the April-June 2003 edition of the Yukos Review, it was reported

that the merger plans were “likely to push back Yukos’ listing on the New York stock exchange

from later this year into 2004.”°**

Claimants also refer to an e-mail of 29 April 2003 from a lawyer at Akin Gump—the firm
advising Yukos on its proposed NYSE listing—to Mr. Misamore reporting that the lawyer had
spoken to an SEC official “to let him know about the proposed merger . . . and to tell him that
although the timetable for the listing has been extended due to the merger, the company still
intends to pursue a listing after the merger . . . .”°*°

Respondent, however, maintains that the NYSE listing project was “abandoned” not because of
the merger but because of “fears that, as a result of the extensive disclosures required by the
[SEC], the process would publicly reveal Yukos’ ‘tax optimization’ program, and this in turn

would lead to major tax reassessments.””** According to Respondent:

Whatever excuse Yukos may have provided to the SEC in March 2003 for halting its
proposed NYSE listing, the possibility of a 2003 listing was in fact called off in February
of that year as the result of Mr. Khodorkovsky’s refusal to sign the company’s registration
statement out of an understandable concern for his own personal liability.°*’

In support of its submission, Respondent refers to an exchange of e-mails of 19 and
20 February 2004 between Mr. Oleg Sheiko, Yukos’ Director of Corporate Finance, and
Mr. Khodorkovsky, in which Mr. Sheiko notes that Mr. Misamore had been asked by
Mr. Khodorkovsky to delay the NYSE, and Mr. Khodorkovsky replies:

If the lawyers do not confirm to me that my personal risks are limited by a reasonable
period of time, I will not sign the form, because if my political career develops in 5 years,
the American hook will become dangerous. I warned about this.”**

Claimants did not comment on this e-mail. In the Tribunal’s view, this e-mail is consistent with

Mr. Misamore’s testimony that, in “early 2003”, Mr. Khodorkovsky had asked him to put the

listing on hold due to a substantial transaction, which turned out to be the merger with Sibneft.

Respondent also relies on a “blackline” version of Yukos’ draft filing for the SEC sent by PwC

to Yukos on 23 July 2002." As telling as that document may be with respect to Yukos’

990

awareness of its tax risks,” the Tribunal notes that this document pre-dates by more than

9 months Yukos’ decision to suspend the NYSE listing.

In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that Yukos’ decision to put the NYSE listing project on hold
in the spring of 2003 appears to have been motivated by the anticipated Yukos—Sibneft merger.

(b) Was the 2003 Interim Dividend a Component of the Yukos—Sibneft Merger
or a Means to Siphon Funds out of Russia?

Claimants submit that the timing and amount of the 2003 Interim Dividend were solely related

to and dictated by the Yukos—Sibneft merger. They write:

Yukos and Sibneft had agreed to target specific levels of net debt intended to reflect the
relative values of the individual companies prior to the completion of the merger. At that
time, Yukos was substantially underleveraged as compared to Sibneft, with significant cash
reserves. It was therefore agreed that in order to leverage up and meet its target net debt
level, Yukos would undertake the payment of dividends, a share buy-back and/or the
taking out of a loan. The 2003 interim dividend was therefore part of the Company’s
efforts to match the capital structure of Yukos and Sibneft, and return value to its
shareholders prior to the completion of the merger, as is confirmed by the
contemporaneous documentation.”

&

With respect to the “contemporaneous documentation”, Claimants refer to Yukos’ press release

of 22 April 2003 announcing the merger, which stated that

[p]rior to completing the transaction, YUKOS intends to increase its leverage and is
considering, among other things, cash distributions to its shareholders in the form of
dividends and share buybacks. It is expected that after such capital restructuring and the
completion of the transaction, YukosSibneft will have a moderate level of leverage and a
strong working capital position.

Claimants also refer to analysts’ reports from the same period, which are all consistent with
their submission. For example, a Brunswick UBS Report dated 23 April 2003 stated that
“Yukos has every reason to leverage up further—if its leverage reached levels similar to
Sibneft . . ., implying $3.75 bn of new debt, Yukos could return $5.15 bn to shareholders . . .

before the deal.”** An internal Yukos PowerPoint presentation about the merger also referred

to the plan to declare a dividend in order to achieve the targeted net debt level.”

Mr. Misamore testified that the 2003 Interim Dividend was “an integral part” of the merger

transaction:

[The approval and payment of the dividend] was entirely related to the Sibneft
transaction . . . [As part of the Sibneft transaction it was a desire of both of the shareholder
groups to have a capital structure in YukosSibneft which did not disadvantage either of the
two shareholder groups. And therefore there were a series of transactions in association
with the Sibneft merger/acquisition that were undertaken, including share repurchases, the
bank debt, the payment of the dividend . . . and that was the reason for the dividend{, it]
was the very last step in the consummation of the Sibneft transaction.””>

Claimants explain that the decision to pay the 2003 Interim Dividend was taken in three
steps.°°° Firstly, on 25 September 2003, when the Yukos Board of Directors scheduled for

28 November 2003 an EGM of Yukos’ shareholders for purposes of approving the merger, the

3.7997

agenda included as an item “payment of dividend for 9 months of 200. Secondly, on

28 October 2003, the Yukos Board of Directors set the amount of and process for approving and

paying the dividend.””* Thirdly, Yukos shareholders approved the 2003 Interim Dividend at the
EGM on 28 November 2003. According to Claimants, this sequence of events undermines
Respondent’s argument that the 2003 Interim Dividend was declared with unprecedented haste

as a “clever”, “eleventh hour” ploy to siphon funds out of Russia.”

In its Counter-Memorial, Respondent argues that the 2003 Interim Dividend “betrays an
unusual sense of urgency on the part of those who proposed it . . . who evidently sensed the
gathering storm, wanted to get as much money as possible, as quickly as possible, out of the
company, and out of Russia, and into their pockets.” In its Rejoinder, Respondent argues
that, while the dividend might have had its origins in the Yukos—Sibneft merger, “by the time
the dividend was actually declared, on November 28, 2003, the Sibneft merger had been halted
and there was no longer any merger-related reason for the dividend.”!' Respondent recalls
that Sibneft’s principal shareholders informed Claimants before the EGM that they no longer
wished to proceed with the merger, and points out that Claimants agreed with the Sibneft
shareholders not to vote for items 1 and 2 of the EGM’s agenda (changes to the board and the
company’s articles of association), but proceeded to vote in favour of the dividend. Thus,
Respondent argues, “the giga-dividend can only be explained by Claimants’ desire to transfer
outside the reach of the Russian authorities US$ 2 billion that could otherwise have been used
to pay Yukos’ taxes and other liabilities.”!"

During the hearing, in response to a question from the Tribunal regarding the fact that the 2003
Interim Dividend had been planned since the spring of 2003, counsel for Respondent explained
that, between this planning stage and the declaration of the dividend, “the world had changed,”
Mr. Khodorkovsky had been arrested and Sibneft had called off the merger, so that the “link
between the declaration of the dividend and the Sibneft merger had been severed, and any
prudent company, frankly, would have marshaled its resources rather than declared and paid a
dividend that was unprecedented in size, at a time when it was under considerable financial

pressure.”!°°

It is not entirely clear to the Tribunal when Yukos’ shareholders found out about the decision of

Sibneft’s shareholders to withdraw from the merger.'" However, the exact timing does not

 

matter. The Tribunal accepts that Sibneft’s decision was communicated to Yukos shortly
before the EGM, but in time for Yukos’ shareholders to agree with Sibneft’s principal

shareholders not to vote on the first two items of the agenda.

Mr. Misamore testified that the Sibneft shareholders, Hulley and YUL “agreed between
themselves to agree to vote for the dividend” because it was “an integral part of that [merger]

transaction,” although one of the parties had, at that point, changed its min
submit that, after the Sibneft announcement, as at 28 November 2003, the completed merger
transaction was still in place and the 2003 Interim Dividend was a final step in consummating
the merger. The status of the transaction was not affected and there were ongoing negotiations
to resolve outstanding issues with Sibneft.'°° In fact, in an announcement by GML in
December 2003, it was stated that the merger agreement remained in full effect.'°”

In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that the decision to approve the 2003 Interim Dividend at the
EGM on 28 November 2003 was an integral part of the merger process, which was still legally
alive at the date of the EGM. Whether it was practically still alive is questionable. On balance,
the evidence does not support Respondent’s contention that the dividend was simply an
“eleventh hour” device to siphon funds out of Russia for improper purposes. Nevertheless the
Tribunal sees some force in Respondent’s contention that Yukos’ stockholders might have
more prudently acted to conserve Yukos’ resources rather than to proceed with a massive

dividend whose essential rationale was evaporating.

(c) Was the Unwinding of the Merger Caused by the Russian Federation?

As noted earlier, the Russian Federation initially supported the Yukos—Sibneft merger.

President Putin expressed his approval of the transaction in a meeting with Mr. Khodorkovsky

  

Some sources suggest that the announcement was made on the day of the EGM (e.g., Misamore WS {| 37), while
others state it took place on the eve of the meeting (e,g., Yukos Oil Company v. Kravin Investments and others, LCIA
Arbitration No. 4589, Statement of Case, 2 May 2005, Exh. R-3601).

Transcript, Day 9 at 20 (cross-examination of Mr. Misamore). However, as Respondent pointed out in its closing
statement, Sibneft shareholders were not yet Yukos shareholders of record and could therefore not have voted for the
dividend. See Transcript, Day 18 at 147-48.

and Messrs. Abramovich and Shvidler in April 2003.'°* In May 2003, Mr. Shvidler stated in
an interview that President Putin and Prime Minister Kasyanov had encouraged him to promote
the merged YukosSibneft entity as a “national-champion”.'°” On 22 July 2003, the Russian
Federal Commission for the Securities Market approved the registration of new Yukos shares to
be issued in connection with the merger.' On 14 August 2003, the Russian Ministry for
Antimonopoly Policies and Support to Entrepreneurship approved Yukos’ acquisition of the

Sibneft shares.'""!

Following the arrest of Mr. Khodorkovsky in October 2003, Sibneft declared that it would halt

the merger process unless the management team was changed.

Claimants argue that the Russian Federation is responsible for the unwinding of the Yukos—

 

Sibneft merger, despite its initial support for the transaction. Claimants frame the question as

one of causation. As Claimants’ counsel put it: “[B]ut for the Russian Federation’s attack on

Yukos, the Yukos—Sibneft merger would never have been unwound. And that point is not

1012

seriously challenged by the Respondent. Claimants describe the arrest of

Mr. Khodorkovsky as having “marked a radical escalation in the Russian Federation’s attack on
Yukos and . . . also marked the beginning of the end for the YukosSibneft merger.”!°"?

According to Mr. Theede:

[A}fter [Sibneft] saw what the Russian Federation was doing to Yukos, . . . saw it being
destroyed . . . and in my opinion it was a direct result of that that caused Sibneft to want to
detach itself from Yukos .... I knew Sibneft was doing everything they could to get out
of this, and they were fairly panicked because they wanted to get out before the
Government destroyed our company .. . [A]s soon as Sibneft saw and learned what was
happening to Yukos, they wanted out of the deal . . . . [W]e had completed the merger, we
were moving ahead with it; everything was really going along quite smoothly, and I think
we were all excited about it. But Mr. Khodorkovsky’s arrest and the political fallout from
that, and then the subsequent attack on the company that was related to

Mr. Khodorkovsky’ arrest, scared Sibneft off. And there’s no question in my mind that
they were afraid that the attack on Yukos was going to carry over to them... .'°*

Mr. Nevzlin also testified that “[a]fter it became apparent that Mikhail Khodorkovsky was
being targeted by the Kremlin, Roman Abramovich abruptly changed his mind and sought to

unwind the merger.”!°"°

In support of their submission, Claimants mention that Mr. Abramovich met with President

Putin only a few days before Sibneft’s announcement of its decision to cancel the merger.'""®

Respondent does not dispute that concerns over Mr. Khodorkovsky’s arrest led Sibneft to

change its mind about the merger. Respondent says that Sibneft’s decision

was not at all surprising, as Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev, Yukos’ two leading
Directors, had recently been arrested and charged with various criminal acts... .. [Their]
future leadership of the company was thus in serious doubt, and any proposed partner
would have understandably been concerned .

One London newspaper speculated that “[a]nalysts believe Mr. Abramovich’s decision to cut
ties with Yukos is an attempt to insulate himself from an apparently politically motivated
campaign by the Kremlin against Mr. Khodorkovsky and Yukos.”"°'*

However, Respondent forcefully denies that Mr. Abramovich’s decision was made “at the

behest” of President Putin. It writes in its Counter-Memorial that

Mr. Abramovich did not need the President of the Russian Federation to tell him that
Sibneft’s proposed merger partner was the subject of a contentious tax dispute .... In the
circumstances, any reasonable company would have sought to extricate itself from the
planned merger, or at least to ensure that the new company was not led by two executives
recently indicted for tax evasion.'°””

According to Respondent, the meeting between Mr. Abramovich and President Putin, if at all

relevant, only demonstrates that the Russian President welcomed Sibneft’s proposal of a change

in the management of the merged entity.'”°

The Tribunal notes that the Parties agree that Sibneft was firmly of the view that the only way
for the merger to be saved would be if there was a change in the senior management of the

merged company, i.e., if Mr Shvidler was appointed as President. Yukos was equally

1021

“adamant” that management issues were “not negotiable. As the BBC reported on

28 November 2003, the “breaking point [of the merger] came when Yukos was not ready to

hand over management of the company.”"°

Claimants characterize Mr. Abramovich’s insistence on a change of management as “a
manifestly unreasonable proposal which sought to turn the agreed terms of the merger upside-

down.”!> They refer to the terms of the initial merger agreement which provided that Yukos

would i the “Senior Mi Positions” includii 14 and to the

22 April 2003 press release which announced that Mr. Khodorkovsky would be CEO."

Claimants contend that Yukos’ refusal to change the agreed terms of the merger was “hardly

the President,

surprising” and that Respondent’s “attempt to rely on such refusal to exonerate itself from

responsibility for the consequences of its own actions should be rejected.”"°”°

Respondent replies that Yukos “could and should have accommodated” the entirely reasonable
concerns of Sibneft.'"’ Respondent points out that Yukos would still have nominated the other
senior managers and that the CEO Yukos suggested in replacement of Mr. Khodorkovsky (Mr.
Simon Kukes), was a relatively unknown figure. With respect to causation, Respondent argues

that it was “Yukos’ stubborn refusal to consider Sibneft’s change-in-management proposal—

and not any action on the part of the Russian Federation—that ultimately doomed the Yukos—
Sibneft merger.”"”*

Respondent also argues that it cannot bear any responsibility for the unwinding of the merger
because Claimants and/or Yukos voluntarily agreed to it. It is a matter of public record that, in
early 2004, Yukos retained external advisers for negotiations with Sibneft.'"? Respondent also
alleges that Claimants signed two protocols dated December 2003 and February 2004 to
unwind the merger.'*’ The Tribunal notes that these protocols are not in the record of this
arbitration. Under cross-examination, Mr. Misamore stated that he did not recall ever seeing
the protocols.'°*!

Claimants acknowledge that, “[a]lthough under no obligation to do so, Yukos and its majority
shareholders agreed to enter into formal discussions with the former principal shareholders of

12 Claimants add however that

Sibneft to consider a possible unwind of the transaction.
Yukos and its majority shareholders made it clear that unless an acceptable agreement was
reached and approved by the Yukos Board of Directors and its shareholders, Yukos would

maintain the existing agreements and proceed with its merger with Sibneft.'°*

The Tribunal observes that, in the end, the decisions of the Moscow and Chukotka Arbitrazh

Courts, although criticized by Claimants, effectively put an end to the merger. There never was

a consensual negotiated solution.'°™*

Respondent speculates that it could have been Yukos that instigated the two court cases in order

to achieve the demerger without having to seek the approval of minority shareholders.'°**

proposed a five-part “Scheme of Actions for Unwinding Transaction.”'"° The first step was a
“[s]uit to have issuance of shares declared invalid,”!7 which, Respondent argues, bears a
striking resemblance to the lawsuit brought in January 2004 by NP Gemini Holdings Limited
and Nimegan Trading Limited before the Moscow Arbitrazh Court.

The Tribunal notes that this e-mail was sent after the commencement of the Moscow lawsuit.
Respondent’s theory is also inconsistent with the fact that Yukos applied to an LCIA tribunal to
prevent the former Sibneft shareholders from pursuing actions for the invalidation of the share
issuance before the Moscow and Chukotka courts. The Tribunal finds this argument of

Respondent unpersuasive.

The central question remains. Did the Russian Federation cause the demerger? In the view of
the Tribunal, it did not. It is abundantly clear that Sibneft wanted out of the merger after the
arrest of Mr. Khodorkovsky. It was perfectly understandable for Sibneft to have second
thoughts about the merger under the leadership of a CEO who was under arrest and embroiled

‘8 The Tribunal does not see the fingerprints of Respondent in Sibneft’s

decision to insist upon a change in management after the arrest of Mr. Khodorkovsky or in

Sibneft’s subsequent announcement that it would not proceed with the merger.

The Tribunal therefore concludes that Claimants have not established any basis which would
allow them to claim damages based on the assumption that the merged YukosSibneft company
would have been successful.'°”

However, the circumstances of the Yukos—Sibneft merger are instructive in evaluating Yukos’
attempts to settle its tax debts with the Russian authorities, which will be discussed in the next

chapter.

The Tribunal will now review the attempts by Yukos to settle its tax debts and the reaction of

the Russian authorities to Yukos’ offers.

ATTEMPTS TO SETTLE
1. Introduction

In the second half of 2004, Yukos made several proposals to the Russian authorities for the
settlement of its tax debts. None of these proposals was accepted by the Russian Federation,

which moved to auction off YNG in December 2004 in spite of Yukos’ protests.

This chapter examines the context of Yukos’ settlement offers, their content and the Russian
Federation’s reaction to them, with a view to determining whether the conduct of the Russian
Federation was more consistent with the goal of collecting taxes or, as Claimants argue, with

the aim of leading Yukos to bankruptcy and appropriating its most valuable assets.

Claimants submit that, through its settlement offers, Yukos sought to initiate a dialogue with
the Russian Federation that could lead to Yukos paying its tax debts while “preserv[ing] the
company as a going concern.”"™’ However, the settlement offers were met with a “complete

1041

lack of responsiveness” and utter inflexibility from the Russian Federation. For Claimants,

this reaction is “one of the strongest testaments” to the fact that Respondent was not interested

2

in tax collection, but only the destruction of Yukos.'“? As put by Claimants’ counsel at the

Hearing:
the bottom line is: if the Russian Federation was interested in collecting taxes, it would
have responded to Yukos; it would have worked with Yukos to try and find a way for the
company to pay its alleged tax debt. ... And we say that this is consistent and supports the
Claimants’ conclusion that this was not about paying taxes but was about the expropriation
of the company.'"?
Claimants add that the Russian Federation’s real intent with respect to Yukos is also revealed
by the fact that it did settle the tax debts of other oil companies, such as Rosneft, Sibneft and
TNK-BP.'““

Claimants also submit that, in addition to rejecting Yukos’ settlement offers, the Russian

authorities actively prevented Yukos from discharging its tax liabilities by freezing and seizing

Yukos’ assets (through the April 2004 injunction of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court and the
bailiffs’ resolutions of June and July 2004).'“* As a result, Yukos could only pay its tax debts
from the proceeds of the business operations of its subsidiaries, which did not suffice to meet

Yukos’ liabilities in the short time allowed by the Russian authorities.'“°

For its part, Respondent submits that the Russian authorities responded to each of Yukos’

offers!”

and, moreover, were entitled to reject these offers because none of them amounted to
a serious proposal.'“* From Respondent’s perspective, Yukos’ settlement offers were a mere
posturing exercise intended to give “an appearance of cooperation, while fostering the image—
embellished by their public relations machines—that Yukos was a victim of the authorities’
conduct.”"” Yukos’ offers were “invariably unacceptable, either because they were contrary
to Russian law, or because they involved impaired assets, or because they were otherwise
inadequate.”"°*°

Respondent further submits that, by the second half of 2004, “Yukos’ management faced a
serious credibility problem, among other things because it had made manifestly false claims
that it was unable to pay any of its tax bills."'°' Given Yukos’ bad faith, the Russian
authorities’ refusal to negotiate was reasonable.'"” Respondent concludes that Yukos caused
its own demise by failing to pay its tax debts in full in the first quarter of 2004 (instead making
disingenuous and inadequate settlement proposals), thereby attracting mounting interest and
fines.'°

The Tribunal recalls that the Quasar tribunal found that the Russian Federation’s failure “even

to respond” to the offers made by Yukos, “the largest private taxpayer in Russia” and a major

good faith in attempting to resolve its tax dispute with Yukos.”!°

2. Yukos’ Settlement Offers (and the Russian Federation’s Replies)

To place the settlement offers in context, it is helpful to recall the dates of some key events.'°*°
The 2000 Audit Report, the first audit report to assess tax arrears against Yukos, was issued on
29 December 2003.'°°° The 2000 Decision holding Yukos fiscally liable for a tax offense and
concluding that an amount of approximately USD 3.48 billion was due within two days, was

issued on 14 April 2004.'°”

On 15 April 2004, the Moscow Arbitrazh Court, upon application by the Tax Ministry, issued
the 2004 Injunction prohibiting Yukos “from alienation and encumbrance in any way of its
assets, including shares (including prohibition from the transfer of securities to a nominee
holder and in trust management), interests in the charter capital of other legal entities,
securities, excluding main types of products manufactured by [it].”"°™*

In a decision dated 23 June 2004 and published on 30 June 2004, the Appeal Panel of the
Moscow Arbitrazh Court reversed a 19 May 2004 ruling that had provisionally suspended the
effect of the 2000 Decision."

On 29 June 2004, an appeal resolution of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court upheld a first instance
decision allowing the Tax Ministry to collect “tax arrears, interest, and fines” from Yukos in an

amount of USD 3.42 billion.’ On 30 June 2004, the Moscow Arbitrazh Court issued an

enforcement writ for this amount.'°*'

On the same day, Bailiff Solovyova issued a resolution to initiate an enforcement proceeding.
The resolution granted Yukos a 5-day period for voluntary payment of the full amount due,
failing which the Bailiff would consider imposing a 7 percent enforcement fee.’ The Bailiff
then issued several more resolutions, freezing cash in 16 Yukos bank accounts.!°

The 2001 Tax Audit, assessing USD 4.1 billion in taxes, interest and fines against Yukos, was
released on 30 June 2004.1

During July 2004, Bailiffs Solovyova and Borisov issued further resolutions restricting Yukos’
1065

access to its assets and imposing the collection of a 7 percent enforcement fee.
On 9 July 2004, the Chukotka Arbitrazh Court issued interim measure orders in proceedings
between former shareholders of Sibneft and Yukos, attaching 72 percent of Sibneft’s share
capital and thus shrinking Yukos’ alienable stake in Sibneft to 20 percent minus one share (the

“Chukotka Injunctions”).'°°

On 6 July 2004, Yukos began making cash payments against its tax debts from the proceeds of
the business operations of its subsidiaries." By 16 November 2004, Yukos had paid USD
3.47 billion—a little more than the amount of its tax liability for the year 2000.'°*

However, Yukos’ tax liabilities increased with the 2001 Decision, the 2002 Decision and the
2003 Decision, which were issued on 2 September, 16 November and 6 December 2004,
respectively, and required payment by Yukos of tax arrears, fines and interest in the amounts of

USD 4.1, 6.7 and 6 billion.”

Between 29-30 June 2004—when one appeals decision lifted the provisional suspension of the
effect of the 2000 Decision and another confirmed the Tax Ministry’s USD 3.42 billion claim
against Yukos—and December 2004—when the YNG auction took place—Yukos made
several proposals to the Russian authorities to settle its tax debts. These proposals may be
classified in four categories: (a) proposals made to the bailiffs, requesting enforcement against
specific assets; (b) proposals for a global settlement conveyed by the Right Honourable Jean
Chrétien, PC, OM, CC, QC, former Prime Minister of Canada; (c) requests for a deferral or
payment in instalments; and (d) other proposals (which are not in the documentary record in
this arbitration). The Rehabilitation Plan, proposed by Yukos’ management in the bankruptcy
proceedings and discussed in greater detail in Chapter VIII.G of this Award, can be seen as

Yukos’ final attempt to discharge its tax liabilities while continuing as a going concern.

(a) Proposals Made to the Bailiffs

On 2 July 2004, Mr. Gololobov, Yukos’ legal counsel, wrote to Bailiff Solovyeva, explaining
that the April 2004 Injunction and the Bailiff's 30 June 2004 seizure of 16 Yukos bank
accounts prevented Yukos from voluntarily complying with the 30 June 2004 enforcement
resolution and requesting that Bailiff Solovyeva accept, by way of voluntary enforcement, the
transfer of a 34.5 percent stake in Sibneft, corresponding to the 20 percent minus one share
stake obtained by Yukos under the Share Purchase Agreement plus the 14.5 percent stake
obtained by Yukos as the second tranche under the Share Exchange Agreement.'°”!
Mr. Gololobov’s letter stated that the value of the 34.5 percent stake in Sibneft was

approximately USD 4 billion.

On 9 July 2004, Mr. Gololobov again requested Bailiff Solovyeva to accept Yukos”

1072

34.5 percent stake in Sibneft in payment of Yukos’ tax debts. Respondent has described this

request dated 13 July 2004 as being “in clear violation of the Chukotka [I]njunctions.’”!°
However, Claimants correctly point out that, while 13 July 2004 may have been the date when

the letter was received by the Bailiff, the letter itself is dated 9 July 2004.'°

On 14 July 2004, Mr. Gololobov amended Yukos’ previous requests and lowered the offer to a
20 percent minus one share stake in Sibneft ostensibly to take account of the Chukotka
Injunctions dated 9 July 2004.'°> Mr. Gololobov indicated that the 20 percent minus one share
stake in Sibneft was worth between USD 2.3 and 2.5 billion.'°

On 6 August 2004, Mr. Gololobov wrote to Chief Bailiff Melnikov, requesting that the 20
percent minus one share stake in Sibneft, as well as Yukos’ holdings in 15 other companies
with a purported value of approximately USD 1.1 billion, be used for enforcement purposes as

a matter of priority.'°”

The letter incorrectly stated that the 20 percent stake comprised
1,637,633,048 shares (a number that in fact corresponds to a 34.5 percent stake), prompting
Respondent to argue that Yukos sought to conceal from the bailiffs that at least a 14.5 percent

stake in Sibneft was encumbered pursuant to the Chukotka Injunctions.'°*

The letter also
stated that the total value of the assets offered in payment was USD 3.4 billion.'°” But, the
annex to the letter valued the shareholdings in Sibneft at USD 2.351 billion, which corresponds
to the value of a 20 percent minus one share stake (as stated in Yukos’ letter of 14 July 2004),
and all the assets offered at USD 3.4 billion.'"” It is obvious that the letter contained some
errors, which could have been corrected by the bailiffs by comparing it to its annex and the

letter of 14 July 2004.

On 16 September, 24 November and 16 December 2004, Yukos wrote further letters to the
bailiffs (in response to the issuance of the 2001, 2002 and 2003 Decisions),'"*' again proposing
that enforcement be made as a matter of priority against its stake in Sibneft and 15 other

1082

entities. These proposals did not specify the number or percentage of Sibneft shares that

Yukos was offering, but the total value of the assets offered in each case was said to be

USD 3.407 billion. This figure is identical to the total amount of assets referred to in the annex

to the 6 August 2004 letter, and it appears to have been calculated on the basis of a 20 percent
1083

minus one share stake in Sibneft.
The bailiffs did not respond to the proposals made by Mr. Gololobov in July 2004. Yukos
challenged the bailiffs’ silence before the Moscow Arbitrazh Court, which found, in a decision
dated 17 August 2004, that the bailiffs had acted lawfully because both the 14.5 percent stake in
Sibneft, which was attached pursuant to the Chukotka Injunctions, and the remaining
20 percent minus one share stake in Sibneft, were disputed by Sibneft’s former shareholders.'°™*
The Department of Bailiffs within the Russian Ministry of Justice responded to Yukos’
6 August 2004 letter on 9 September 2004, referring in particular to the decision of the Moscow
Arbitrazh Court of 17 August 2004 and concluding that the Russian judiciary had “affirmed the
right of the bailiff to make the final decision regarding the sequence for seizures.”!**

The bailiffs did not respond to Yukos’ letters of 16 September, 24 November and 16 December
2004. Respondent submits that the bailiffs did not need to respond as, by then, Yukos had
already been put on notice by the 17 July 2004 decision of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court that its
offers of Sibneft shares were unacceptable.'°*° The Tribunal notes, however, that the bailiffs
also failed to react to Yukos’ offer of shares in companies other than Sibneft, in respect of

which the Moscow Arbitrazh Court had not commented.

(b) Proposals for a Global Settlement Conveyed by Mr. Chrétien

Mr. Chrétien wrote to Prime Minister Fradkov on behalf of Yukos for the first time on 6 July
2004, offering a “global settlement” of USD 8 billion for the taxes assessed against Yukos in
2000-2003, with 2 billion to be paid in cash in July 2004 and two more tranches to be paid in

With respect to the Sibneft shares, in addition to the proposals listed here, Yukos also applied on 22 April 2004 to the
Moscow Arbitrazh Court for a replacement of the April 2004 Injunction with a new injunction that would instead
freeze Yukos’ 57.5 percent stake in Sibneft (see Exhs. R-476 and R-477). Yukos’ application was rejected the
following day (Exh. R-452). Respondent discussed this application in the context of Yukos’ settlement offers
(Counter-Memorial § 420). However, since the purpose of the application was the unfreezing of Yukos’ assets in the
context of interim measures ordered against it, rather than a final settlement of the tax claims, the Tribunal considers
that this application cannot properly be characterized as a settlement proposal.

July 2005 and July 2006.'°’ As security for the payment of the July 2005 tranche, Yukos

offered its 35 percent stake in Sibneft.'°**

Having received no reply, Mr. Chrétien reiterated the global settlement proposal in another
letter to Prime Minister Fradkov dated 15 July 2004 and in letters addressed to President Putin
dated 30 July, 10 September and 17 November 2004.'"°

Noting that Mr. Chrétien’s letter of 30 July 2004 offered an “uncontested” 35 percent stake in
Sibneft as collateral, Respondent again argues that Yukos sought to conceal from Respondent
that at that time at least a 14.5 percent stake in Sibneft was encumbered pursuant to the
Chukotka Injunctions. However, as Mr. Chrétien’s letter in this respect contradicted
Mr. Gololobov’s letter to the bailiffs of 14 July 2004, the Tribunal views the reference to the
uncontested stake in Sibneft as a mistake rather than a deliberate attempt by Yukos to mislead

the Russian authorities.

Referring to Mr. Chrétien’s letters of 30 July 2004 and 17 November 2004, Respondent submits
that, while Prime Minister Fradkov and President Putin did not respond to Mr. Chrétien in

writing, they did discuss with him the tax claims against Yukos.'"”

In his letter of 30 July 2004, Mr. Chrétien refers to a discussion with President Putin during a
“meeting in July." In his letter of 17 November 2004, he describes a meeting with President

Putin as follows:

[w]hen we last met in Moscow, you told me that I could take the mandate to represent the
interests of Group Menatep, and possibly other minority shareholders of Yukos, to find a
solution to the tax problems confronting them. ... When you and I last spoke after our
meeting, you asked for a letter outlining our proposal to settle this matter and you assured
me that a response from the Minister responsible for this file would be forthcoming. I sent
you the letter at the end of July, but have received no communications from your
government as yet.'°?

From these excerpts, it appears that President Putin initially encouraged the overture of a
dialogue regarding Yukos’ tax liability, but that neither he nor any other Russian authority ever

responded to the concrete proposal made by Mr. Chrétien on Yukos’ behalf.

Under cross-examination at the Hearing, Mr. Theede expressed Yukos’ frustration with the lack

of response from the Russian Federation:

By this time it was really becoming obvious that Mr. Chrétien’s, you know, admirable
efforts just weren’t going to get us where we needed to go, because he had been made—a
lot of promises had been made to him about ‘All I want Yukos to do is pay taxes, you
know? That’s all I want out of them: I just want them to pay taxes. And if you can get
them to do that, then send me a proposal and it will work.’

And he did all that, and never got a response. And it’s now several months after the
original proposal. I suppose—I suppose, you know, no question in my mind—the
authorities probably already by July had in mind the amount of money that they were
going to rack up against us in tax liabilities. They probably knew that they were going for
something in the order of $30 billion, and so to them the $8 billion was low. And of
course, they couldn’t come back and say, ‘Look, our plan is to tax you $30 billion, and so
you guys are well off the mark.’ They couldn’t say that, because it would have blown their
cover.

But we were trying, and thought Mr Chrétien was a very credible way to open the dialogue
I’ve been talking about all afternoon. But by this time, I don’t—I had pretty much lost
hope, and was, I guess, impressed that Mr Chrétien was continuing to try, but to no
avail.'"°

(c) Requests for a Deferral or Payment in Instalments

On 16 July 2004, Mr. Steven Theede sent a letter signed by Mr. Bruce Misamore to the
Minister of Finance, Mr. Kudrin, then Minister of Finance, requesting a six-month deferral or
payment in instalments of the tax arrears and interest for the year 2000.'"* The letter referred
to the “unprecedented nature” of the sum subject to collection and the potentially negative
consequences of rapid enforcement on Yukos’ production operations and the Russian

budget.!%

During the Hearing, Mr. Theede acknowledged that the letter was not perfect (the
proposals were not detailed) but he described the letter as an attempt to “create a dialogue”
between Yukos and the Russian Federation.'°°° The Ministry of Finance rejected Mr. Theede’s

request by letter dated 30 August 2004, relying on Art. 62(1)(2) of the Russian Tax Code,

which provides that the term for the payment of tax cannot be changed if the entity applying for
1097

such a change is the subject of proceedings for a tax offence.
On 12 August 2004, Yukos petitioned the Moscow Arbitrazh Court for the right to pay its tax
debt for the year 2000 in 15 monthly instalments of USD 143.96 million. Judge Grechishkin
denied the petition, stating that while he had discretion under the law to order payment in

instalments, in this case the circumstances did not justify such an order."

(d) Other Proposals

Claimants submit that the settlement offers described above are “just a sample” of the “roughly
80 proposals and attempts to communicate with various authorities” made by Yukos.'”” They

say that other settlement proposals were made, but did not leave a paper trail.

For example, Mr. Rieger recounts in his witness statement that, in the summer of 2004, he and
Mr. Gololobov had a meeting with Chief Bailiff Belyakov during which they “explained that
Yukos could start selling off its assets within a month in order to pay off its alleged tax debts”
and “left a two-page letter for the Russian authorities setting out Yukos’ settlement proposal.”
Mr. Rieger adds that the authorities did not respond to this proposal.''"’ Noting that Mr. Rieger
could not recall the exact terms of the proposal, Respondent suggests that, in the light of the

“cautiously optimistic”, the negotiations ended abruptly when Mr. Temerko, Yukos’ chief
1103

negotiator in the process, was threatened with arrest and fled Russia.
Respondent emphasizes that there is no written record of this proposal and no witness statement
by Mr. Temerko. Respondent also contends that “[i]f there were such a proposal in any amount,
there is no rational basis for believing it totalled US $21 billion, because after it was allegedly
made in October 2004, Yukos continued to make proposals it valued at US$ 3.4 billion, and
Mr. Chrétien kept reiterating his ‘global settlement’ proposal of US$ 8 billion.”!!*

When asked in cross-examination whether there was a record of this offer, Mr. Theede replied
“Ty]ou have no record, but you do have my word. And I believe certainly Bruce Misamore and

I have exactly the same recollection. Mr. Misamore was not cross-examined regarding this

settlement proposal.

3. Parties’ Arguments and Tribunal’s Observations

(a) Did Yukos Contribute to its Own Demise by Failing to Discharge Tax Debt in
the Amount of USD 9 Billion in the First Quarter of 2004?

As discussed in paragraphs 679-80 and 745-48 above, Respondent submits that Yukos could
have avoided some of the taxes, fines and interest eventually assessed against it, in the first
quarter of 2004, by filing amended VAT returns in its own name, amended tax returns for
2000-2002 and a tax return for 2003 recognizing all of Yukos’ income without assigning it to
its trading entities. According to Respondent, had Yukos taken these steps, it would have faced
only USD 9 billion in unavoidable tax debt, comprising the full amount assessed against it for
the year 2000 and the amounts assessed against it for 2001-2003 minus VAT, willful and
repeat offender fines and a part of the default interest accrued on the taxes for those years.''°°

Respondent also contends that Yukos could have paid this anount—USD 9 billion—in the first
quarter of 2004. At that time, Respondent argues, Yukos had both the ability to calculate its tax

liabilities for 2001-2003 based on the amounts assessed against it for the year 2000 and

sufficient funds.'"” Specifically, Respondent submits that Yukos had “unrestricted access” to:
(a) over USD 6.8 billion in cash, constituting revenue from Yukos’ trading entities paid out in
dividends to Brittany Ltd., a British Virgin Islands indirect subsidiary of Yukos;''°* (b) USD 3
billion in cash, which Yukos was entitled to receive in the context of the unwinding of the
Sibneft merger for the 20 percent minus one share stake it had acquired under the Share
Purchase Agreement;'"”? (c) over USD 1.1 billion in cash generated by Yukos’ continuing
operations; (d) the USD 2 billion “giga-dividend” Yukos paid out to its shareholders in
December 2003 and January 2004;'!"' and (e) at least USD 1.55 billion in offshore non-

1110

monetary assets.'''? Respondent also points out that, until the April 2004 Injunction, all of

Yukos’ assets in Russia were available to it to pay its tax debts.'!'*

Respondent submits that, by re-filing its VAT and tax returns and paying USD 9 billion in the
first quarter of 2004, Yukos could have avoided the 7 percent enforcement fee imposed by the
bailiffs and “all of the enforcement measures about which Claimants complain, including the
April 14, 2004 injunction, the June 30, 2003 cash freeze orders, the seizures of shares, and the
YNG auction.”'''* Yukos would thus “have survived as a going concern and still could have

pursued a claim for a refund of any amounts the courts found it did not need to pay."

Respondent insists that, as Mr Konnov stated in his second expert report, “[t]he filing of tax
returns and the payment of the tax would not have prejudiced Yukos’ appeal rights.”'''®
According to Respondent, Mr Konnov’s opinion is confirmed by Yukos’ counsel Mr Pepeliaev

who, in a commentary published in 2002, wrote:

We often recommend for the sake of a client’s safety to pay tax for a short period (a

month) in a maximum amount which can possibly be inferred from interpretation of the
relevant provision. And immediately thereafter we file an application to the tax
inspectorate requesting a refund or offset of an overpaid amount, It basically reads, ‘Hey!
We used to interpret this norm this way but our consultants tell us that we overpaid tax, so
please refund it.’ Of course, the inspectorate refuses to refund implying that we paid
correctly — the more the better. Then a court claim is filed and it is up to court to decide.
As a result a precedent is established.''"”

However, Respondent submits, despite this possibility to discharge the totality of its tax debt at

an early stage for a fraction of the amounts eventually assessed against it, Yukos “failed to use

the time and its resources to pay its tax debt,” its managers choosing to “ignore that payment

sol 118,

was due as provided in the assessment, not months later. Instead, Yukos only started

making payments and considering a payment plan in July 2004.'!"°

Respondent submits that, in the light of Yukos’ conduct, the Russian authorities were entitled to
view Yukos’ settlement offers with “caution and scepticism”.'"?° In addition, by the time of the
first settlement offers, Yukos’ untrustworthiness had become manifest in other ways,
particularly when Yukos: (a) accused the Russian authorities of running a “tax racket”;
(b) denied affiliation with, or the ability to get information about, its trading entities; (c) asked
that the April 2004 Injunction be substituted with an injunction against already-encumbered

Sibneft shares; and (d) engaged in serial corporate dissolution to frustrate tax collection.''!

Respondent concludes that the destruction of Yukos is therefore “the consequence of the
contributory fault and failure to mitigate of Yukos, under the control of Claimants.”!!??

Claimants reject the argument that they could have avoided enforcement of the tax assessments
by the Russian Federation and the bankruptcy of Yukos by paying USD 9 billion in the first
quarter of 2004, asserting that, to be convinced by this argument, “the Tribunal would need to
ignore the most salient facts—the Respondent’s breaches—and assume . . . that the very same
Russian authorities who committed those breaches would have acted differently if only Yukos

vl

had taken the actions specified by the Respondent.”''?? Claimants argue that there is no “duty

to appease” and that “a victim of extortion is not to blame if the threats against it are carried out

after it refuses to pay.
In addition, Claimants are of the view that taking the steps suggested by Respondent would
have prejudiced Yukos’ position for subsequent litigation.'’* As Mr. Theede stated at the
Hearing, “you don’t run a business by talking about paying taxes until they become an official

tax.

Moreover, Claimants submit that, as a matter of fact, Yukos “did everything it could to pay off

vol

the tax assessments as soon as they became due.”''”” The obligation to pay arose on 16 April
2004,'* and Yukos made its first payment shortly thereafter on 6 July 2004. However,
contrary to Respondent’s contention, Yukos did not have enough cash available to settle an
alleged tax debt of USD 9 billion in the first quarter of 2004. Mr. Theede explained at the
Hearing that the USD 6.8 billion on the balance sheet of Brittany Ltd. “were basically loans of
cash that had already been repatriated into Russia to fund our capital programs and operating
expenses and so forth” and thus represented a “zero-sum” game.''”? The offer by the former
Sibneft shareholders to buy back the 20 percent minus one share stake in Sibneft that Yukos
had acquired pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement for USD 3 billion was only made in
October 2004 (and was rejected because it significantly undervalued the shares).''*° The
2 billion dividend could not be reversed and the sale of Yukos’ offshore assets would have

1131

taken longer than three months to realize. As for Yukos’ assets in Russia, Yukos was

prevented from using them by the April 2004 Injunction, which was “grossly disproportionate”
to the debt it was intended to secure, and subsequent seizures,!?
Thus, according to Claimants, by adding the “wide-ranging freeze and seizures” of the

company’s non-cash assets to the “massive payment demands” and “impossibly short

deadlines,” the Russian Federation itself “engineer[ed] the circumstances of non-payment.”!!*3

In the circumstances, “it was evident that Yukos would not be able [to] settle its alleged tax
debts or discharge them in full without the cooperation of the Russian authorities.”!'*

In the Tribunal’s view, Yukos cannot be held responsible (even in part) for the rejection of its
settlement offers and the enforcement measures subsequently taken by the Russian Federation
merely because it did not pay USD 9 billion in the first quarter of 2004. Although the 2000
Audit Report was issued at the end of 2003, Yukos’ obligation to pay its tax debt for the year
2000 did not arise until the 2000 Decision was issued in April 2004. Similarly, Yukos’
obligation to pay its tax debts for 2001-2003 arose only with the issuance of the 2001, 2002
and 2003 Decisions in September—December 2004. Although some of the amounts that became
due under these decisions could have been estimated based on the findings set out in the 2000
Audit Report, the Tribunal does not see why Yukos, at a time when it considered the tax
assessments to be ill-founded, should have made any payments before a legal obligation to pay
the tax arose. The Tribunal notes that Yukos began making payments toward its tax debts on
6 July 2004, less than a week after the issuance of the appeals decisions in its challenge
proceedings against the 2000 Decision and the enforcement proceedings initiated by the
Russian Federation. In the circumstances, the Tribunal does not consider it unreasonable for

Yukos to have delayed payment of its tax debts until these decisions were issued.

(b) Did Yukos’ Settlement Offers Constitute Real Alternatives to Enforcement?

Respondent invokes several reasons why Yukos’ settlement offers could not be accepted by the
Russian Federation, all of which are disputed by Claimants. Principally, the Parties disagree as
to whether (i) all the Sibneft shares were either encumbered or disputed; (ii) Yukos sought to
enter into negotiations that are not permissible under Russian law; and (iii) Russian law permits

payment in kind of tax arrears.

For Respondent, because of the flaws in Yukos’ offers, the Russian authorities were justified in
doubting the sincerity of Yukos’ intention to pay. This justified distrust explains why the
Russian authorities did not respond to each one of Yukos’ offers (although, according to

Respondent, they did respond to all the sound offers).

Se

Disputing that Yukos’ offers suffered from any insurmountable defects, Claimants repeat that it
was Yukos’ genuine intention to commence a dialogue with the Russian Federation aimed at

finding a workable solution to pay off its tax debts.

In this section, the Tribunal first addresses the specific areas of disagreement between the
Parties and then makes some general observations regarding Yukos’ settlement offers and the

Russian Federation’s responses.

i. Whether all the Sibneft Shares were Either Encumbered or
Disputed

Respondent submits that the Sibneft shares could not be accepted in payment of Yukos’ tax
debts because Yukos’ ownership of these shares was disputed by Sibneft’s former
shareholders.'*> This defect, says Respondent, affected all the offers made to the bailiffs, all
the offers conveyed by Mr. Chrétien to Prime Minister Fradkov and President Putin, as well as

the USD 21 billion settlement proposal allegedly made by Yukos in October 2004.

Claimants recognize that Yukos’ ownership of the 14.5 percent stake in Sibneft corresponding
to the second tranche under the Share Exchange Agreement was challenged by Nimegan
Trading Limited before the Chukotka Arbitrazh Court in proceedings initiated on 6 July 2004
and that those shares were attached by the Chukotka Injunctions of 9 July 2004, pending
resolution of the merits of the dispute. Claimants assert, however, that the 20 percent minus
one share stake in Sibneft acquired by Yukos under the Share Purchase Agreement was never

encumbered or challenged in any legal proceeding.''*°

As explained in paragraphs 2-915 and 922 above, the Tribunal considers that, although Yukos
initially offered a 34.5 percent stake in Sibneft in payment of its tax debts to the bailiffs, after
the Chukotka Injunctions it sought only to offer in payment the 20 percent minus one share

stake in Sibneft that was not the object of the Injunctions.

As for this 20 percent stake, the Tribunal notes that a number of Sibneft’s original shareholders
wrote to the Russian authorities in July and August 2004, opposing Yukos’ proposals to use
Sibneft shares to settle its tax debts, since the shares’ ownership was disputed between them

and Yukos. Thus, on 6 July 2004, these former shareholders wrote to the bailiffs, claiming that
“tights to the shares of OAO Sibneft held by OAO NK YUKOS are the subject of the dispute
and OAO NK YUKOS is unable to exercise its ownership rights to such shares.”"'’ On 13
July 2004, the same former shareholders wrote to the Deputy Minister for Taxes, stating that
“OAO NK YUKOS is not entitled to use the whole block of shares in OAO Sibneft held by it
for settlements with its creditors, including with respect to tax liabilities.”''** In a further letter
dated 16 August 2004, the former shareholders specifically asserted that the Share Purchase
Agreement and the Share Exchange Agreement constituted “a single transaction” and that “all
92 percent of shares in [Sibneft] that were transferred to [Yukos] under both agreements are in
dispute.”"!”

Despite these allegations, it is clear to the Tribunal that the Share Purchase Agreement was
never formally challenged. The 6 July 2004 letter refers to an LCIA proceeding; yet, the only
LCIA proceeding related to Sibneft shares that is in the record in this arbitration is LCIA
Arbitration No. 4589, in the context of which Yukos sought damages arising out of the
purported termination of the Share Exchange Agreement, but made no claim in relation to the
Share Purchase Agreement.''*°

In light of these findings, the Tribunal considers the bailiffs’ failure to respond in July 2004 to
Yukos’ settlement offers to be inexcusable. On 2 July 2004, when Yukos first wrote to the
bailiffs to request enforcement against its 34.5 percent shareholding in Sibneft, its ownership of
these shares had not yet been challenged. The Chukotka court proceedings (challenging the
transfer of the 14.5 percent stake) were commenced four days later, on 6 July 2004. This was
also the date on which the former Sibneft shareholders, for the first time, wrote to the bailiffs
claiming that Yukos was “unable to exercise its ownership rights” to the Sibneft shares. For

four days, therefore, the bailiffs had no reason to believe that ownership of these shares by

Yukos was disputed. Yet the bailiffs did not respond to Yukos’ offer during that period or at

any time thereafter.

In addition, after Yukos, on 14 July 2004, reduced its offer to the 20 percent minus one share

mere letters to the bailiffs from a third party asserting a claim to an asset held by the debtor
(without asserting this claim vis-a-vis the debtor itself) can constitute a sufficient reason for the

bailiffs to disregard the debtor’s request to use this asset for enforcement purposes.

ii, | Whether Yukos Sought to Enter into Negotiations that are Not
Permissible under Russian Law

According to Respondent, Yukos management believed erroneously that tax assessments
provided an opportunity for a “business negotiation” that could end in a “compromise”.''”
Such negotiations, says Respondent, seeking a reduction, deferral or payment in instalments of
tax arrears, are not permitted under Russian law.''* Specifically, Respondent contends that,
once “a resolution of the highest tax authority or a court judgment has entered into force, the

liad

tax authorities and bailiffs cannot reduce the amount of the tax that’s due. Nor, avers

Respondent, can the tax authorities agree to a delay for payment of more than 6 months, or
change the term for payment when the entity applying for such a change is the subject of

1145

proceedings for a tax offence. Moreover, adds Respondent, the Moscow Arbitrazh Court

was justified in rejecting Yukos’ request for payment in instalments of its tax arrears due to the
absence of exceptional circumstances. ''*°
Respondent maintains that a major problem with Yukos’ settlement proposals was that the

amounts offered were insufficient to cover the tax arrears, fines and interest assessed against

Yukos at that time and thus demonstrated that Yukos never intended to pay its tax debts in

full.!'47

Respondent contends that, even if it accepted that Yukos’ 20 percent minus one shareholding in
Sibneft was formally unencumbered, its value was nevertheless uncertain, since Yukos was
unable to offer a controlling block of shares and the public controversy with respect to the
shares could affect their market value.''“* The fact that Yukos did not itself sell the Sibneft

49 Respondent notes that Yukos’ Board, when

shares is also proof of their illiquidity.
authorising the sale of the shares in August 2004, expressly acknowledged that “certain terms
of the sale of these stakes may differ from the existing market terms because of the need to sell
the assets as soon as possible in order to discharge the Company’s tax liabilities.”''*’ When the
20 percent minus one shareholding in Sibneft was tendered on 14 July 2004, it was valued by
Yukos at USD 2.3 billion, which was insufficient to cover Yukos’ liabilities for the year 2000.
The value of the Sibneft shares plus the shares in the other 15 companies offered by Yukos in
its letters of 16 September, 24 November and 16 December was also insufficient having regard

to Yukos’ tax debt assessed in the 2001, 2002 and 2003 Decisions.''*!

As for Mr. Chrétien’s offer of USD 8 billion to settle the claims for the years 2000-2003,
asserts Respondent, it would have covered only about half the amount then assessed against
Yukos.'' The USD 21 billion settlement offer allegedly made by Yukos in October 2004 was
also insufficient, submits Respondent, since Yukos’ tax liabilities for the years 2000-2004
totalled USD 24.2 billion.''*

Claimants deny that Yukos was asking the authorities for a reduction in the amount of the tax
arrears that were due.''** As Mr. Theede testified at the Hearing, Yukos “never tried to make

any kind of proposal that was less than the tax that was due . . . we didn’t try to negotiate the

amount; we were willing to pay all the taxes back.”''** Mr. Theede further observed that Yukos
“could never in a million years have anticipated the level of taxes that would ultimately be
presented to the company; and fines and VAT.”''°? Claimants submit that the Russian
authorities could have ascertained the sincerity of Yukos’ intention if only they had bothered to
discuss the settlement offers.''”

A dialogue, say Claimants, was necessary given the enormous amounts assessed against Yukos.
During the Hearing, when asked by a member of the Tribunal: “when a State assesses taxes and
the taxpayer has exhausted administrative and judicial recourse in respect of the assessments, is
it normal for the State to enter into a dialogue to negotiate a settlement of the assessments with
the taxpayer?,” Mr. Theede replied that while he was not “sure what is normal . . . , there was
no way that we would have been able to pay the taxes without being able to talk to the
authorities and come to some agreement. We felt like our feet were nailed to the floor and we
were being asked to jump. It was very frustrating,”!'**

Concerning the value of the Sibneft shares, Claimants assert that they were Yukos’ most liquid
asset.''? Yukos’ assessment of the value of its 20 percent minus one shareholding at
USD 2.3 billion in its letters to the bailiffs was not exaggerated since, as stated above, in the
bankruptcy proceedings in 2006, Gazprom acquired these shares for USD 4.1 billion.'"®° Under
cross-examination at the Hearing, Mr. Theede acknowledged that Yukos did not try to sell the
Sibneft shares itself.'"°' He explained that Yukos did not know what the Russian authorities
wanted. He testified that if the bailiffs had said to Yukos “‘[w]e don’t want the shares, but we
will take the $3 billion. You can sell the Sibneft stock without any interference,’ [Yukos]

would have done that in a second.”!'

Claimants also note that the settlement offers conveyed by Mr. Chrétien in July 2004 were well

in excess of the tax debt that had been assessed at that time—USD 3.42 billion for the year

2000. At the Hearing, Mr. Theede explained that the USD 8 billion figure was arrived at by
considering the 2000 tax assessment of USD 3.4 billion and scaling it back for subsequent years
to account for the shorter period over which interest would be calculated.'" In terms of
Yukos’ ability to honor the proposal, Mr. Theede confirmed that Yukos would have been in a
position to pay the first installment of USD 2 billion in July 2004, and states that, despite the
absence of a response from the Tax Ministry, Yukos “did take immediate action to start
accumulating the offshore cash ... within a day or two of this letter.”!'® When asked to explain
why the settlement offer remained at the level of USD 8 billion in the proposal of 10 September
2004, when the amount of taxes assessed against Yukos (for 2000 and 2001) had reached
USD 7.5 billion, Mr. Theede stated as follows:

[W]hat [the 10 September proposal] is saying is: with what we've already paid, plus the
[VAT] that you haven’t refunded us, we’ve nearly paid our 2000 tax arrears. I think it’s
important to maybe explain . . . this [VAT], because by the end of the attack that...
unrefunded [VAT] amounted to nearly [USD] 5 billion of the total assessment against the
company. And what it was is: when you sell oil in Russia, you pay a [VAT] on it; and
then, if you export it, you automatically get that [VAT] back."
And Mr. Theede testified that in October 2004 Yukos made a USD 21 billion offer.
Mr. Theede’s evidence on this alleged offer was confirmed by Mr. Misamore. However, the

Tribunal notes that there is no documentary evidence of this offer in the record.

As for Respondent’s argument that the amounts and payment modalities of tax arrears cannot
be negotiated under Russian law, Claimants submit that it is disingenuous, since the Russian
Federation has entered into negotiations and agreed settlements of tax assessments with other

Russian and international oil companies such as Sibneft, TNK-BP and Rosneft.!!7

The Tribunal observes that according to press reports submitted by Claimants Sibneft was able to

settle a 1 billion tax arrears claim by paying only 300 million, °* while the one billion tax

arrears claim against TNK-BP was reduced by “hundreds of million of dollars,” after a meeting

took place between Lord Browne, BP’s chief executive, and President Putin." As for
Rosneft, the Tribunal notes that its financial statements reveal that, after Rosneft purchased
YNG, the Russian authorities approved a restructuring plan allowing it to pay the tax arrears
that had been assessed against YNG in February and October 2004 in quarterly payments over
a period of 5 years starting in March 2008.'!”

Claimants also affirm that Rosneft received a concession from Respondent in the guise of an
83 percent reduction in the amount of YNG’s tax arrears and a corresponding 89 percent
reduction in fines.'!”!

Respondent answers that Yukos’ case is “totally different” from those of Sibneft or TNK-BP,
because there is no evidence that these companies, contrary to Yukos, engaged in “knowing and
longstanding tax evasion” and lied to the courts and tax authorities. From the limited record
available in this arbitration in this respect, it does appear as if these companies cooperated with
the tax authorities in order to settle the amount due. Moreover, there is no evidence that the

NP For

authorities compromised after having reached a final assessment of liability.
Respondent, “considering the flagrancy of Yukos’ violation, the not[o]riety of its failure to
accept responsibility and indeed its efforts to undermine tax enforcement, common sense and
straightforward deterrent interest would dictate different results.”!'”*

Regarding Rosneft, Respondent explains that, unlike Yukos, it was eligible for a “tax
restructuring process” because it had, also unlike Yukos, been designated as a “strategic
company” by the Russian Government. According to Mr. Konnov’s first expert report,
Article 191 of the Federal Law on Insolvency “contemplates a possibility to restructure federal

tax debt of certain ‘strategic’ companies in order to prevent their bankruptcy.”'' A list of

“strategic” companies was approved in early 2004, and Rosneft (contrary to Yukos) was

eligible for inclusion on the list given its status as a state-owned company.'!”°

At the Hearing, counsel for Respondent provided the following explanation as to the

requirements for a “strategic” company:

It was necessary to be State-owned. It was necessary that one of the ministries request that
the company qualify to be a strategic company and to undertake responsibilities of a
strategic company, and ultimately to be approved by the relevant federal agency, which
involved the defence services; and in the case of Rosneft involved committing to supply
petroleum products to the Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation. So these were
all things that were not open to Yukos.''”°

While Claimants appeared to suggest at the Hearing that, since “it’s the Government that
decides which company is strategic,” it would have been “fairly easy” for Respondent to accept
Yukos as a strategic company. The Tribunal notes that no specific requirements for purposes of

designating a strategic company were proffered by either side.'!””

 

Whether Russian Law Permits Payment in Kind of Tax Arrears

Respondent submits that the Russian Federation could not accept Yukos’ shares in Sibneft and
other companies as payment because Russian law does not allow a taxpayer to settle its
liabilities in kind.''"* Specifically, Article 45(3) of the Russian Tax Code stipulates that “[t]he
obligation to pay taxes/duties shall be executed in the currency of the Russian Federation.”!'”
This defect affected all of Yukos’ settlement offers with the exception of those conveyed by

Mr. Chrétien.

Claimants reply that Respondent misrepresents “both the legal context and the substance of
Yukos’ settlement proposals.”''*” While Article 45(3) of the Russian Tax Code requires the
payment of taxes in Russian rubles, Article 45(1) expressly provides that in case of late or
incomplete payments, outstanding taxes may be collected through a forced sale of the

taxpayer’s assets other than cash, as provided for in Articles 47 and 48 of the Russian Tax Code

and Article 46 of the Federal Law “On Enforcement Proceedings”.''*' Respondent itself relies
on the latter provision for the proposition that, for the purposes of the settlement of Yukos”
alleged tax liabilities, the company’s assets seized by the bailiffs were subject to a coercive

sale.

iv. Concluding Observations

Having reviewed the totality of the evidence and the Parties’ representations, the Tribunal is of
the view that Yukos’ settlement offers represented a good faith attempt by the company to
initiate a dialogue with the Russian Federation regarding the payment of Yukos’ tax arrears.
While it is true that these offers were for less than the total amount of taxes, fines and arrears
assessed against Yukos, the Tribunal observes that, at the time when each offer was made, it
either would have been sufficient to cover the amounts for which decisions had been issued by
the Tax Ministry at the time, or was close enough to those amounts to allow the Russian
Federation to assume that Yukos did indeed intend to discharge its tax liabilities. As for
Yukos’ offer of its 20 percent minus one share holding of Sibneft shares, in the opinion of the
Tribunal, since this shareholding was never formally disputed, it should have convinced the

Russian Tax authorities that Yukos was serious in wishing to settle its tax liabilities.

Respondent’s argument that the Russian Federation does not negotiate tax liabilities is belied
by the fact that it agreed to tax settlements with other companies. Given the paucity of
evidence before this Tribunal regarding the settlements actually reached by Sibneft and TNK-
BP, the Tribunal cannot judge the extent to which their situations were similar to that of Yukos.
However, the simple fact that these companies were able to negotiate the reduction of tax
arrears initially claimed by the tax authorities suggests to the Tribunal that such negotiations

can in fact take place under Russian law and practice.

Thus, even if Yukos’ settlement offers may not have resolved definitively all of its tax
liabilities, the Tribunal sees no valid reason why the Russian Federation, if it sought only to
collect taxes (and, presumably, to allow its largest taxpayer to continue in business) would not
have reacted more positively to Yukos’ settlement offers at the very least to the extent of

engaging constructively in discussion.

The Russian Federation never showed any interest in Yukos’ offers. With the exception of the
letter of 9 September 2004, the bailiffs never replied to Yukos, never even troubling to explain
why they considered its offers inadequate. The Tribunal finds this silence very revealing,
particularly in circumstances where the bailiffs’ views as to the unacceptability of the offers
were based in part on correspondence they had received from a third party (the former Sibneft
shareholders), which had not even been copied to Yukos. The settlement offers conveyed by

Mr. Chrétien, at the end of the day, were also met with silence.

When the Russian authorities did provide responses to Yukos’ proposals, these were in the
nature of blanket rejections. It is manifest that the authorities never seriously considered any
one of Yukos’ proposals. The only letter from the bailiffs to Yukos (dated 9 September 2004)
relies on the decision of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court of 17 July 2004, which merely addressed
the issue of the Sibneft shares, but fails to explain why the shares in the other 15 companies
offered by Yukos could not be accepted in payment. The Tribunal notes that the letter has a
ring of finality to it, emphasizing as it does “the right of the bailiff to make the final
decision.”'"” In the entire period from July to December 2004, the Russian authorities did not
make a single counter-proposal to Yukos or even state that they were prepared to engage with
the taxpayer. Mr. Rieger testified at the Hearing that “it was like a one way road: making
proposals, talking, offering, and . . . no substantial feedback . . . no sitting down and willing to
discuss.”"'*? This statement aptly describes the impression that the Tribunal garners from the

record.

In conclusion, Respondent’s total failure to engage with any of Yukos’ settlement proposals
raises significant doubts in the Tribunal’s mind as to whether Respondent’s true and sole
concern in its dealings with Yukos after the tax assesments were issued was the collection of

taxes.

THE AUCTION OF YNG
1. Introduction

After having reviewed these futile attempts by Yukos to settle its tax debts to the State, the

Tribunal comes to one of the most striking episodes in the saga of Yukos’ demise, the

December 2004 auction of its core asset, the oil production company Yuganskneftegaz

(“YNG”) and the subsequent acquisition of YNG by State-owned Rosneft.

Claimants argue that the auction was a sham, “carefully orchestrated to achieve the transfer of
Yukos’ crown jewel to the State at the lowest price that could be achieved while maintaining a
facade of legality.”''** Claimants accuse Respondent of having depressed the value of YNG by
fabricating USD 4.6 billion in tax claims against the company. They argue that Respondent set
a low starting price which ignored both a valuation by Dresdner and Dresdner’s advice on how
to conduct the auction in order to maximize the sale price. Claimants deny that their own
actions contributed to the low price achieved at the auction. They maintain that the sole bidder
at the auction, a previously unknown entity called Baikal Finance Group (“Baikal”), was a
dummy that was used to mask the Russian State’s interest and involvement in the process.''**

Respondent answers that the decision to sell YNG to satisfy Yukos’ massive debt was a direct
consequence of Yukos’ misconduct and the only realistic way to collect Yukos’ unpaid taxes in
circumstances where Yukos had fiercely obstructed audits, resisted payment and attempted to
make itself judgment proof.''’ Although YNG was sold during a 10-minute auction attended
by two bidders on a Sunday afternoon in the outskirts of Moscow, Respondent observes that it
was done in compliance with Russian law. Respondent avers that the price realized—
USD 9.35 billion—was consistent with the formal appraisal conducted by Dresdner and other
market estimates, and notes that this price reflected YNG’s own tax liabilities.''” If the price
was lower than it might otherwise have been, says Respondent, the fault lies solely with
Claimants and Yukos, who sabotaged the auction through a sham bankruptcy proceeding in
Texas and published threats of “a lifetime of litigation” which kept potential bidders away.
Respondent rejects Claimants’ theory that Baikal was a veneer for the Russian Government.
Rather, Respondent submits that it was a special purpose vehicle associated with
Surgutneftegaz. When Baikal suddenly found itself unable to finance its purchase (due to the

Temporary Restraining Order (“TRO”) obtained by Yukos in Texas), Rosneft simply seized a

commercial opportunity that presented itself as a result of Claimants’ misconduct.''**
At the outset of its analysis, the Tribunal will recall that during the February 2003 meeting with
the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs Industrialists attended by Michael Khordokovsky
and referred to earlier in this Award, President Putin made this seemingly prescient
observation:

[C]ertain things are obviously clear, [Rosneft] is a State-owned company. It has

insufficient reserves and should increase them. Some other oil companies, such as Yukos,
have a surplus of reserves.''*

As will be seen, after having reviewed the totality of the circumstances leading to the YNG
auction and the auction itself, the Tribunal concludes that this episode provides yet more
compelling evidence that the Russian Federation was not engaged in a true, good faith tax
collection exercise but rather was intent on confiscating the most valuable asset of Yukos and

effectively transferring it to the Russian State.

The Tribunal notes that its findings are consistent with those of the Ros/nvestCo and Quasar

+1190

tribunals, which found “many aspects of the YNG auction more than suspect’ and

concluded that “the auction of YNG was rigged.”!'"!

2. Chronology

As is evident from the chronology of events recounted in Chapter VIII.B, and as observed by
the ECtHR, the Russian authorities “were unyieldingly inflexible as to the pace of the
enforcement proceedings, acting very swiftly.”"'? This chronology reviews the key events as
of the date when the sale of YNG was announced to the auction itself on 19 December 2004,
and the transfer of the YNG shares to the Russian State-owned Rosneft three days later on 22

December.

(a) | Yukos’ Shares in YNG are Seized and the Government Announces they will
be Sold; Yukos Brings Unsuccessful Court Challenges

On 20 July 2004, the Ministry of Justice announced its plan to sell YNG in order to satisfy
Yukos’ tax debt for the year 2000.'"° Mr. Misamore testified that at the time of this
announcement the only tax levied against Yukos and confirmed by the courts was for the year
2000, in the amount of approximately USD 3.42 billion, which Yukos had already started to

1194

pay. In the circumstances, he viewed the seizure of YNG as disproportionate and

unjustified.

Industry analysts interpreted the bailiff’s plans to sell “Yukos’s most valuable asset” as “a clear
sign the authorities are going in for the kill,” observing that the move “leaves little doubt the

authorities’ final goal is for Yukos to cease to exist in its current form, materially erasing most,

if not all, shareholder value in the process.” 195

On 23 July 2004, GML director Tim Osborne declared that any purchaser of YNG would be

“buying a whole heap of trouble.”!""*

Yukos applied to the Russian courts to prevent the sale from proceeding, but to no avail.''” In

a letter to the Chief Bailiff of the Russian Federation dated 6 August 2004, Yukos requested

that any sale of YNG be conducted by public auction. This request was granted.'!*

Dresdner issued its valuation report on 6 October 2004; it valued YNG as a stand-alone
enterprise at USD 18.6 to 21.1 billion.’ Dresdner noted in the summary of its Report that this
amount could be reduced by tax and other liabilities, which would lower the value to USD 14.7
to 17.3 billion.'*°' In its report, Dresdner observed that “[t]he sales process usually has a
significant impact on the revenue from the sale” and that “[a] quick auction will most likely
prevent the achievement of a full price.”'”” Dresdner added that “[i]f access to full information
is not provided to potential purchasers, this will lead to a significant reduction in the number of

parties interested in YNG and also in their ability to offer the full price.”

A few days after Dresdner delivered its report, on 11 October 2004, the bailiffs recommended a
minimum sale price for the YNG shares that reflected a 60 percent discount of the value
determined by Dresdner.'* The bailiffs’ declaration caused Yukos shares to fall “so far so

fast . . . that trading had to be halted twice on MICEX.”"°°

On 13 October 2004, GML’s Tim Osborne reiterated his earlier threat, and said that “[w]hoever

issued a decision finding YNG liable for a tax offense for the year 2002 in the amount of

(d) After a 10-Minute Auction, the Successful Bidder Baikal is Sold to State-
Owned Rosneft; a “Monumental Bargain”; the “State, Looking After its Own
Interests”

1003. The auction of YNG took place on 19 December 2004 at 4:00 p.m. Baikal opened the bidding
at USD 9.35 billion. Gazpromneft’s representative then asked for a recess and left the room to
make a call. Upon his return, Baikal was declared the winner with its opening bid. The

bidding process was over within ten minutes.'””

1004. One press article reported that the Baikal bidders worked for Surgutneftegaz and had “hastily
departed for vacations abroad as soon as the auction ended.”'”* At a press conference on
21 December 2004, President Putin was invited to comment on the perception that “a state

company is in fact behind the organisation Baikal Finance Group” and responded as follows:

 

As is well known, the shareholders of this company are all private individuals, but they are
individuals who have been involved in business in the energy sphere for many years. They
intend, as far as I am informed, to establish relations with other energy companies in
Russia which have an interest in their company. And within the framework of current
legislation, the participants of this process have the right to work with this company after
the auction is held. For us, it is only important that all these actions, as I already said, are
within strict accordance with the current legislation of Russia. I hope that this is the way it
will be. As for the ability of state company to buy these assets, they of course have this
right, just like other market participants.'”””

1005. What was not public knowledge at the time President Putin gave his press conference was the

fact that, the previous day, the State-owned company Rosneft had sought and obtained

antimonopoly clearance to acquire Baikal.'**°

1006. On 22 December 2004, Rosneft purchased Baikal, before it had paid the balance of the

purchase price for the YNG shares.'3! Rosneft’s purchase was announced publicly the

following day. During another press conference, on 23 December 2004, President Putin

said:

Now regarding the acquisition by Rosneft of the well-known asset of the company—I do
not remember its exact name—is it Baikal Investment Company? Essentially, Rosneft, a
100% state owned company, has bought the well-known asset Yuganskneftegaz. That is
the story. In my view, everything was done according to the best market rules. As I have
said, I think it was at a press conference in Germany, a state-owned company or, rather
companies with 100% state capital, just as any other market players, have the right to do so
and, as it emerged, exercised it.
Now what would I like to say in this context? You all know only too well how the
privatisation drive was carried out in this country in the early 90s and, how, using all sorts of
stratagems, some of them in breach even of the then current legislation, many market players
received state property worth many billions. Today, the state, resorting to absolutely legal
market mechanisms, is looking after its own interests. I consider this to be quite logical.'?**
[emphasis added]

(e) Once it is State-Owned, YNG’s Fate Improves, with Reductions in Tax
Liabilities and a Dramatic Increase in Value

1007. The Tribunal notes that, as at 31 December 2004, ten days after Baikal purchased YNG for

USD 9.35 billion, Rosneft stated in its consolidated financial statements that “negative
goodwill” in the amount of USD 7.052 billion arose in the context of its acquisition of YNG “as
a result of excess of the net assets measured at fair value, over the purchase price.”'?**
Rosneft’s total revenues increased from USD 5.28 billion in 2004 to USD 23.95 billion in 2005,
while its net income increased from USD 0.84 billion to USD 4.16 billion over the same
period.'*> At the time of its IPO in mid-2006, Rosneft’s share capital was USD 79.8
billion;'”*° YNG alone was then valued at USD 55.78 billion.'*’ Rosneft itself described the

YNG acquisition as “the most monumental bargain in Russia’s modern history.”"?**

1008. Subsequent to the YNG auction, Yukos continued its efforts to have the sale invalidated in the

Russian courts, but all its claims were dismi: sed.

1009. The Tribunal notes with interest that very soon after it was acquired by Rosneft, a significant

portion of the tax assessments levied against YNG were set aside or vastly reduced by Russian

courts. '24° According to Mr. Konnov, after YNG contested the assessments, “the court-

appointed experts who calculated the market prices” found in a number of cases “that the price

deviation was within the 20% ‘safe harbour’ [for transfer pricing].”"™"! As a consequence,
91242

“large parts of the assessments against YNG were overturned by the courts. Claimants,

while not explicitly disputing the “supposed technicality” of the provisions on transfer

pricing,’ insist that, given the “scale of the reduction . . . the purported tax reassessments
against Yuganskneftegaz lacked any credibility in the first place.”'?*

1010. As for YNG’s remaining debts, Rosneft, according to Mr. Konnov, as a “strategic company”

owned by the State and supplying the State with petroleum, was able to “restructure[e]” them

through a series of negotiations.'*°

it has traversed are consistent with a genuine attempt by the Russian Federation to collect taxes,
or whether they disclose that the auction was rigged so as to enable YNG to fall into the hands
of the State through the veneer of a legitimate process. The Tribunal will review, in turn, (a)
the fairness of the price achieved at the auction, (b) the role of Baikal and its acquisition by

Rosneft, and (c) the impact of the YNG auction on the future of Yukos.

(a) Did the Auction Price Reflect the True Value of YNG; If not, was Either
Party Responsible for the Price Reduction?

1012. The Parties have different views as to whether the sale price of USD 9.35 billion reflected the

fair value of YNG. Claimants argue that if the purpose of the auction had been to collect
revenues in order to pay legitimate tax debts, the Russian Federation would have been expected
to make every effort to maximize the proceeds. Instead, Claimants allege that Russia took steps
to reduce the price so that it could, via Rosneft, acquire YNG for a derisory amount, and still be

1246

able to enforce the remaining tax liabilities against other Yukos assets. Respondent

maintains that the price for which YNG was acquired was not a “knock down” price but, to the

extent it was, only Yukos was to blame.!747

1013. Claimants complain that the auction price paid by Baikal represented less than half of the

1248

1249

1250

enterprise value of YNG, which the Dresdner Valuation Report had assessed to be in the range
of USD 18.6-21.1 billion. Respondent answers that other contemporaneous valuations,
including Morgan Stanley’s, estimated a much lower value (USD 8.9 billion).“* Respondent
also recalls that it was necessary to adjust the value of the enterprise to account for the fact that
only the 76.79 percent stake of Yukos in YNG was being auctioned. Respondent put these
issues to Dr. Illarionov, when challenging his claim that the price achieved was “well below
even the most conservative estimates prepared by experts.”'* Dr. Illarionov admitted that his
figure of USD 14.7-17.3 billion was based on a full enterprise value that did not take into

1250

account the tax liabilities. At the end of his cross-examination, however, Dr. Illarionov

maintained that he did not think “this discount rate of 60% that has been applied by the Russian

authorities produces a number that [he] would consider . . . a legitimate valuation.”!”*!

1014. Respondent points out that Dresdner’s valuation did not take into account outstanding tax

liabilities in the amount of USD 4.6 billion, and that “[i]f this were to be judicially upheld, the
estimate of net debt and other liabilities would increase by a corresponding amount.”!?*?
Claimants reply that these tax liabilities were fabricated by the Russian authorities in the period
from October to December 2004 in order to depress the price of YNG. The tax liabilities, say
Claimants, related to transfer pricing and were applied to oil trading revenue that had already

53° Respondent argues that

been re-attributed to Yukos, thus resulting in double taxation.
YNG’s transfer pricing issues had arisen over many years and that the allegation of double
taxation was misconceived. Respondent says the assessments were made in accordance with
Russian law, since Yukos had forced YNG to sell oil to the trading companies at very low

prices which exposed it to liability.'"**

1015. Claimants also argue that the sale price was affected by the nature and speed of the process

adopted by the Russian authorities. While it is common ground that the time frame for the
auction was within the minimum statutory requirements, Claimants recall that the Government
ignored Dresdner’s recommendation for a two-stage auction process to allow for proper due
diligence, and its warning that failure to provide access to full information could lead to a
reduction in the number of potential purchasers and the price they would be willing to pay.'?*°
No due diligence was provided beyond a “data room” that consisted of the report itself, auction
rules and 89 pages of additional documents. Respondent answers that Russian law requires no

due diligence, that Gazpromneft was still able to undertake a thorough assessment, and that any

due diligence issue was due to Yukos’ lack of cooperation with Dresdner.'?*°

1016. The bare minimum time frame meant that the auction was conducted on a Sunday, which

1017. Claimants conclude that by any measure “the auction process was perfunctory and did not

991259

involve genuine competition. Although the auction process complied with the letter of

 

Russian legislation,'*® Claimants insist that it is not a defence to an expropriation claim under

international law that the State complied with its own domestic law.

1018. Respondent accuses Yukos of turning YNG into a “wasting asset” by foisting upon it

“upstream guarantees”! for its loan in favour of Moravel and forcing YNG to borrow USD
485 million from affiliate Yukos Capital. Respondent adds that Yukos caused YNG to default
on at least USD 586 million of mineral extraction tax, imperilling its oil licenses. Yukos’ press
service issued a statement on 11 October 2004 attributing the non-payment of mineral

whether these statements likely encouraged or discouraged bidders from participating in the

auction, he answered that Gazpromneft and Baikal probably “felt very well protected, maybe

by the Russian Government.”

1020. Having considered all of the factors that it has reviewed, the Tribunal concludes that the price
of USD 9.35 billion which Baikal paid at the auction for the 76.79 percent stake of Yukos in

YNG was far below the fair value of those shares.

1021. In the opinion of the Tribunal, the imposition during the few weeks prior to the auction of
massive tax liabilities on YNG (which were cancelled in the months after the acquisition of
YNG by Rosneft) appear designed specifically to depress the value of YNG. The amount of
the tax liabilities imposed which were subtracted from the Dresdner valuation cannot be
justified. In addition, in the view of the Tribunal, the failure by YNG to pay its mineral

extraction tax was inextricably linked to the asset freeze of Yukos’ cash.

1022. The Tribunal also finds that the Russian authorities deliberately ignored the advice of Dresdner
that haste in carrying out the auction could decrease the price. The Tribunal notes that the
Quasar tribunal criticized Respondent’s decision to hold the auction only one month after its
announcement, and found that “the auction procedure was highly irregular in a number of ways

that all relate to the extraordinary speed with which it was conducted.”!?

1023. While the Tribunal accepts, as did the Ros/nvestCo and Quasar tribunals,”

that the actions of
Claimants in warding off prospective buyers through a media campaign and the TRO may have

deterred some potential buyers and may have resulted in a low winning bid,'*”' these actions, at

“receptive to the Respondent’s argument that some of the blame i
at the YNG auction should be attributed to the Claimants for their media campaign . . . and for initiating bankruptcy
proceedings... that led to the TRO” and to the “argument that Yukos’ actions reasonably could have deterred
potential bidders from participating in the YNG auction”) Both tribunals contrasted these findings with their serious
doubts about the bona fide nature of the auction, stemming largely from the dubious identity of Baikal and the
circumstances of its acquisition by Rosneft.

 

 

 
 
 

 

 

 

On the other hand, the Tribunal notes that the Russian Justice Minister on 14 October 2004, in a commentary on the
auction price, is reported to have said that this value “takes into account the ‘high risk to a potential buyer’ of the

  

- 335 -

the end of the day, had no relevant impact on the bankruptcy of Yukos.'”” The circumstances
surrounding the appearance and disappearance of Baikal make the auction process seem all the

more questionable to the Tribunal. The Tribunal now turns to these events.

(b) Who was Behind Baikal and were They a Front for the Russian State?

1024. In the view of the Tribunal, one of the most opaque facets of the YNG auction is the identity of

Baikal, the sole and successful bidder at the auction which was acquired by State-owned
Rosneft three days after its successful bid. Baikal did not exist until less than two weeks before
the YNG auction. It was obviously a vehicle created solely for the purpose of bidding for YNG

at the auction. As noted earlier, it was incorporated with capital of USD 359.

1025. During the closing oral arguments, the Chairman told Respondent’s counsel: “you still have to

convince us that Baikalfinance ... was not a sham company. That’s your challenge.”"?”

1026. Respondent sought to explain that Baikal was a special purpose vehicle established strictly for

bidding at the auction. Respondent added that “it was well known that those lying behind

1274 Respondent stated that Baikal was represented at the

auction by two managers of Surgutneftegaz, Mr. Igor Minibayev and Ms. Valentina Komarova.
Ms. Valentina Davletgareeva, the person who incorporated Baikal, was also connected to
companies affiliated with Surgutneftegaz. According to Counsel for Respondent, she sold 100
percent of her interest in Baikal to Makoil, a company owned in part by a secretary to the Board

"75 Accordingly, Respondent submits that “all of those who had a

of Surgutneftegaz.
connection to the company in a formal manner or who were identified with it can be identified
as having significant positions or relationships with respect to Surgutneftegaz.”'?”° Baikal’s
Tver office was close to a subsidiary of Surgutneftegaz, which in turn was located directly

across the river from YNG."27 In addition, there had been reports in the media since

September 2004 that Surgutneftegaz was interested in the auction.'?*

1027. Claimants insist that, even accepting Respondent’s theory that Baikal was a front for

Surgutneftegaz, the “facts in the record . . . compel the conclusion that Baikal served the
interests of the State, and any involvement of Surgut, a company known to be ‘friendly with the

Kremlin’, was solely to mask the State’s involvement.”!?”

1028. The fact that Baikal was incorporated only a few weeks before the auction and had the

minimum-required capital is, according to Respondent, irrelevant. The other three entities who
had antimonopoly clearance for the auction were also relatively new companies with little
capital. Respondent alleged that Baikal paid the USD 1.77 billion deposit itself after having

received the financing from a third party.'?*”

Respondent submitted that Surgutneftegaz had
sufficient resources to enable Baikal Finance to pay the deposit, but not the full purchase price
without recourse to international capital markets.'**' Respondent’s theory is that such financing
was foreclosed on the day of the auction by the TRO, leaving Baikal (and Surgutneftegaz) with
a stark choice of defaulting on the obligation to pay the balance, and lose the USD 1.77 billion

1282

deposit, or find someone else to buy the asset. On the other hand, Respondent’s counsel

agreed that the transaction “turned out to be very productive for Rosneft; there’s no question

about it.”"7*

were familiar with such filings confirm, according to Claimants, that the authorities did not
perform even a perfunctory review of the 13-page application and its 98 pages of

attachments, '°*°

1030. Claimants also refer to the fact that Rosneft filed for antimonopoly clearance on a Monday, the

day after the auction. Thus, Respondent’s allegation that Surgutneftegaz was obliged to sell
“the bid” because the TRO prevented it from accessing financing rings hollow since
Surgutneftegaz would have needed to seek and be denied financing by every commercial bank
on the Sunday of the auction. Claimants ask whether Baikal would have risked a deposit of

USD 1.77 billion by making a bid without first having financing in place.'?*°

1031. Respondent claims Rosneft had no ownership interest in Baikal prior to the auction, and that

Rosneft put together a finance package for the purchase of Baikal after the auction, on an

emergency basis, and, in so doing, even breached covenants related to its prior borrowings.

1032. When Rosneft completed the acquisition of YNG on 22 December 2004, using funds borrowed

from State-owned banks, the transaction was described in the Russian Press as “the State
budget via a State bank help[ing] a State company acquire from the State a very profitable

determined in advance that Rosneft would acquire YNG, and that the elaborate sham involving

Baikal was set up to mask the State’s involvement and thus reduce legal risks.

1033. Claimants also submit that the events after the auction speak for themselves. YNG’s tax debts

1285

1286,

were reduced from USD 4 billion to less than a billion. In addition, after having filed claims by
YNG of almost USD 10 billion in Yukos’ bankruptcy, the net cost to Rosneft for the purchase
of Yukos’ jewel was, according to Claimants, less than USD 3 billion. Thus, bearing in mind

that in 2006 Rosneft’s IPO valued YNG at USD 55.78 billion, Rosneft’s description of the

Claimants, an understatement.'?°

1034. The Tribunal notes that the Ros/nvestCo tribunal in reaching its conclusion that the auction was

1035. The identity of Baikal was also of “[p]aramount’

rigged observed that “the winning bidder was a completely unknown company just created
before the auction and disappearing right after the auction and assigning its interests to
Ru[ss]ian state-owned Rosneft.”!?" To the RosInvestCo tribunal, “t]he circumstances that this
bidder was further found to have no real offices and nevertheless was able to raise the deposit
in the range of US$ 1.7 billion and then the purchase price with the apparent help of Rosneft
further contribute to the impression that the scheme was set up under the control of respondent

to bring Yukos’ assets under Respondents control.”!”!

991292 5 A
12 Concern for the Quasar tribunal, which

described its unease with the circumstances of Baikal’s purchase as follows:

an unknown entity, placed a $9.3 billion, uncontested winning bid for YNG, the largest oil
production company in Russia, and was then acquired a mere three days later by state-
owned Rosneft, even before payment of the purchase price was due. . .. The Respondent's
argument . . . to the effect that [the] YNG auction was of a public nature, and that [Baikal]
bid $500 million above the starting price, are insufficient to remove the suspicion of
collusion, particularly when [Baikal] was quickly taken over by Rosneft before payment of
the purchase price was due.'7”>

 

1036. Having assessed the evidence with respect to the identity and role of Baikal, and the timing and

nature of Rosneft’s acquisition of that company, this Tribunal agrees with the conclusions of

the RosInvestCo and Quasar tribunals that the YNG auction was rigged.

1037. The additional evidence placed before this Tribunal connecting Baikal to Surgutneftegez does

1289)

1290

not erase the suspicion that Baikal was created by instruments of Respondent in order to
facilitate the acquisition of YNG by State-owned Rosneft. The statement by Rosneft that the

purchase was a “monumental bargain”, the remarks by President Putin acknowledging that the

State had looked after the State’s interest '** by increasing its reserves, and the good fortunes of
YNG once it was in the hands of a State-owned company all support the Tribunal’s conclusion
that the auction of YNG was not driven by motives of tax collection but by the desire of the
State to acquire Yukos’ most valuable asset and bankrupt Yukos. In short, it was in effect a

devious and calculated expropriation by Respondent of YNG.

(c) What were Yukos’ Prospects for Survival Once it Lost its Core Asset?

1038. While the legal implications of the YNG auction will be discussed in Part X of the Award, the

Tribunal will set out briefly Claimants’ factual allegations that the sale of YNG dealt a “fatal
blow” to the survival prospects of Yukos.'”> Was the sale of YNG the point of no return for
the survival of Yukos? On the basis of the totality of the evidence and, in particular, the
testimony of Messrs. Misamore and Theede and Dr. Illarionov, the Tribunal answers that

question in the affirmative.

1039. Mr. Misamore testified that with the auction of YNG, “Yukos lost over 60% of its total

production capacity.” This “meant a massive downsizing of the company’s activities.”
Mr. Misamore hoped it “was not the end of the company,” and Yukos started 2005 on the basis
that it would carry on operations on a smaller scale with the remaining production assets and
refineries. However, “it soon became evident there was little that Yukos’ management could
do to protect the company’s Russian assets. Despite our best efforts to challenge the tax
reassessments, the Russian courts were biased against us. Bankruptcy proceedings in Russia
were increasingly likely and the Yuganskneftegaz auction had highlighted the real risk that

company assets would be transferred to State-owned entities at substantial undervalue.”!?°

1040. Mr. Theede considered the announcement of the auction as the point in time when “the die was

1295

1296,

finally cast” for Yukos. The auction put an end to settlement discussions with the Russian

Government. He considered the sale of YNG at a “grossly undervalued price through a sham

auction” to be a “clear theft by the Russian State,” which became all the more obvious in the

context of the IPO by Rosneft in July 2006.'””

1041. Dr. Illarionov described the confiscation of YNG as the “culminating point of th[e] attack” on

Yukos, following which the Russian authorities took no further steps to satisfy Yukos’ alleged

tax debts. Such conduct was inconsistent with a genuine attempt to collect taxes.'”*

1042. At the time, Claimant YUL and its subsidiaries (including Hulley), as majority shareholders of

Yukos, acknowledged that they had “lost the power to govern the financial and operating
policies of Yukos so as to obtain benefits from its activities.”'” It was noted in the 2004
Annual Report for YUL that Yukos had become “incapable of operating as a business as

evidenced by the forced sale of [YNG].”"°"

1043. The effect of the auction on Yukos’ prospects did not escape the attention of the ECtHR, which

acknowledged that YNG had been Yukos’ “only hope of survival.”"""' It was “rather obvious”
to the ECtHR that the choice of YNG as the first Yukos asset to be auctioned to satisfy Yukos”

tax debts was “capable of dealing a fatal blow to its ability to survive the tax claims and to

991302

continue its existence. This Tribunal agrees. This Tribunal also agrees with the Quasar

tribunal’s characterization of the seizure of YNG as an extreme measure capable of “drastic”

consequences for Yukos.'*°°

1044. Those “drastic” consequences will be important for the Tribunal’s determination of an

THE BANKRUPTCY OF YUKOS

1. Introduction

1045. Claimants’ case is that Yukos’ bankruptcy, announced by the Moscow Arbitrazh Court on

4 August 2006 and followed by the removal of Yukos from the companies’ register on
21 November 2007, was the “final act of the destruction of the Company by the Russian
Federation and the expropriation of its assets for the sole benefit of the Russian State and State-
owned companies Rosneft and Gazprom.”'** Claimants allege that Respondent “instigated” a

syndicate of western banks led by Société Générale (the “Western Banks”)'*”°

to commence
bankruptcy proceedings against Yukos based on Yukos’ default under a loan agreement
concluded between Yukos and the Western Banks for the purposes of funding the Sibneft
merger.'*° Claimants contend that Respondent ensured, through the initiation of bankruptcy
proceedings and discriminatory treatment of bankruptcy claims, that the Russian State and
Rosneft would hold over 97 percent of the alleged claims against Yukos in the bankruptcy.'*””
Having made certain that Yukos’ proposed Rehabilitation Plan would be rejected at the general
creditors’ meeting, the Russian Federation completed its expropriation scheme by auctioning
Yukos’ remaining assets. Through the bankruptcy and liquidation of Yukos, the Russian State
directly received more than 60.5 percent of the bankruptcy proceeds and, indirectly, through
Rosneft, received more than 39.21 percent of the bankruptcy proceeds and all of Yukos’ main

production assets.

1046. Respondent denies all allegations of impropriety or bias in relation to the bankruptcy

1307

proceedings. Moreover, Respondent argues that the bankruptcy proceedings are irrelevant to
the Tribunal’s determination because the conduct that directly caused Yukos’ liquidation—the
initiation of Yukos’ bankruptcy and the vote to liquidate Yukos—is either not attributable to
Respondent or not an exercise of its sovereign power. Respondent’s case is that “the
insolvency of the Yukos holding company was the consequence of the Oligarchs’ and Yukos’

management’s disastrous strategy of tax evasion, resistance to and obstruction of the collection

of overdue taxes, self imposition of massive non-tax and intercompany liabilities on the

company, and failure to draw on Yukos’ ample offshore assets.”'**

2. Chronology

(a) The Initiation of the Bankruptcy

1047. The initiation of bankruptcy proceedings against Yukos is inextricably tied up in the history of

two loans connected with the Sibneft merger, one from the Western Banks (“A Loan”) and the
other from Société Générale (“B Loan”). It is therefore important to review the key facts

relating to each of those loans.

1048. For purposes of funding the Sibneft merger, Yukos entered into two loan agreements. The

A Loan consisted of USD 1 billion borrowed by Yukos from the Western Banks, which was
secured by certain of Yukos’ oil export contracts and by YNG. This loan was entered into on

24 September 2003."

1049. The B Loan consisted of USD 1.6 billion borrowed by Yukos from Société Générale, which

was fully collateralized in cash by GML, Yukos’ ultimate parent company. This loan was

entered into on 30 September 2003.'*!°

1050. On 3 October 2003, Société Générale drew on the collateral under the B Loan, making GML

the lender. GML’s rights were then assigned to Moravel, which was GML’s wholly-owned

indirect subsidiary in Cyprus.'*"!

1051. On 30 June 2004, an appeal panel of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court issued an enforcement writ

1308

1310

Bu

against Yukos for payment of the taxes assessed for the year 2000. Following this

development, the Western Banks notified Yukos that they would not demand immediate

payment, but would instead rely on the security supporting the A Loan, namely payments

through the proceeds of export sales of crude oi

1052. Soon after, however, as described in the previous chapter, the tax authorities seized and
auctioned YNG, depriving Yukos of its primary oil producing asset. Claimants contend that
when YNG was taken from Yukos in December 2004, YNG stopped shipping oil under the
export contracts and “[i]t was thus the actions of the Russian Federation, not Yukos, which
obstructed the payment of [the A Loan].”!""°

1053. Since Yukos ceased making payments under the A Loan, the Western Banks brought a claim
against Yukos for approximately USD 472.8 million, plus interest under the A Loan. The claim
was recognized by the High Court of England and Wales on 24 June 2005 (“English
Judgment”).'** Respondent contends that, by this time, Yukos had already paid Moravel over
USD | billion under the B Loan, and thus had more than enough cash to have repaid the
Western Banks in full under the A Loan.

1054. During this same time period, Yukos management implemented two restructurings that
transferred Yukos’ non-Russian assets, previously held through Yukos’ wholly-owned Dutch
and Armenian subsidiaries Yukos Finance and Yukos CIS into two “stichting

administratiekantoor”.

1315

1055. A stichting is a Dutch “foundation. It does not have members or shareholders. All

management powers are vested in a board of directors, subject only to the stichting’s articles of
association and Dutch law.'*'® In the case of a stichting administratiekantoor or “foundation

trust,” the stichting issues depository receipts for shares in exchange for shares transferred to

it.'"!7_ This trust-like structure separates legal ownership and beneficial ownership: — the

Western Banks. Respondent puts particular emphasis on proceedings in Dutch courts, where
the Western Banks attempted to enforce the English Judgment.'° On 15 July 2005, the
Western Banks petitioned the District Court of Amsterdam to enforce the English Judgment,
and to issue a judgment permitting the sale and transfer of Yukos’ share interest in Yukos

The Western Banks informed the court that the creation of the Stichtings had
rendered Yukos’ shares in Yukos Finance, over which the Western Banks had obtained a
prejudgment attachment, “worthless” and “more or less unsellable.”'*?* Respondent asserts that
the Western Banks’ failure to enforce the English Judgment in the Netherlands was “the death

knell of Yukos’ pretense of cooperation in its negotiations with the syndicate.”"*””

1061. Back in Russia, on 22 September 2005, the bailiff adopted a resolution to seize all of Yukos’

assets."

1062. The Western Banks proceeded to seek to enforce the English Judgment against Yukos in

Russia. The Western Banks succeeded in the first instance, before the Moscow Arbitrazh
Court, but the Court’s favourable ruling (issued on 28 September 2005) was reversed on

1063. Following the unfavourable decision by the Federal Arbitrazh Court for the Moscow District,

the Western Banks entered into a confidential sale agreement with Rosneft (“Confidential Sale

Agreement”).'*!

1064. Pursuant to this Confidential Sale Agreement, Rosneft agreed to satisfy the outstanding debt

owed by Yukos to the Western Banks (the outstanding principal being at the time
USD 455,124,215.03), in exchange for the assignment of the banks’ rights of claim against

Yukos under the A Loan to Rosneft.'*?

1065. Significantly, the payment of the purchase price by Rosneft was predicated upon the Western

Banks agreeing to take the steps described in Schedule 8 of the Confidential Sale Agreement,
entitled “Application For Bankruptcy.” Schedule 8 sets out the Western Banks’ obligations
under three steps: “1. Proceedings on recognition and enforcement of the English Judgment in
Russia (the ‘Enforcement Case’); “2.Execution proceedings against the Borrower
[ie Yukos] (based on the Enforcement Case) (the ‘Execution Proceedings’)”; and

“3. Bankruptcy proceedings against the Borrower.'**?

1066. Following the conclusion of the Confidential Sale Agreement between the Western Banks and

Rosneft, the enforcement of the A Loan was back before the Russian courts. On 21 December
2005, the Moscow Arbitrazh Court formally recognized the English Judgment against Yukos in

favour of the Western Banks and issued a writ of enforcement with respect to the judgment.

1067. On 29 December 2005, the Western Banks submitted the enforcement writ to the bailiffs, who

then initiated enforcement proceedings to recover from Yukos the amounts ordered under the
English Judgment, namely USD 455,124,214.99 in principal and USD 9,459, 143.18 in interest.
These enforcement proceedings failed. Claimants assert that they were bound to fail due to the

seizure of Yukos’ assets, which had been imposed since July 2004.

1068. The order of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court that recognized the English Judgment was

1331

1332

1333

challenged by Yukos, and upheld by the Federal Arbitrazh Court of the Moscow District. In its
decision of 2 March 2006, the Federal Arbitrazh Court reasoned as follows:

2003 Between, Amongst Others, “Yukos Oil Company” and Société Générale SA, 13 December 2005, Exh. C-300

When re-examining the case, the Court did comply with the directions given by the
cassation Resolution of December 5, 2005. The Court fully and comprehensively reviewed
the circumstances of the case. Its conclusions on the application of legal rules are
consistent with the established circumstances and evidence in the case.'***

On 6 March 2006, the Western Banks petitioned the Moscow Arbitrazh Court to declare Yukos
1335

bankrupt.
In an undated letter, Mr. Theede wrote in mid-March to the bailiffs requesting that the
authorities “immediately release Company property from the freezing order in an amount
sufficient to satisfy” the debt owed to the A Loan lenders, and thus avert the commencement of
the bankruptcy proceedings.'**°

On 14 March 2006, consistent with the terms of the Confidential Sale Agreement, Rosneft paid
the Western Banks the full outstanding amount of the A Loan; in exchange, the Western Banks

assigned their rights of claim to Rosneft.'**”

On 24 March 2006, YNG—by then a subsidiary of Rosneft—filed a separate and parallel

petition against Yukos before the Moscow Arbitrazh Court to declare Yukos bankrupt.'***

According to Respondent, the YNG petition was based on a judgment in respect of
transportation services provided while Yukos owned YNG in January through March 2004,

1075. On 28 March 2006, the Moscow Arbitrazh Court ordered the commencement of bankruptcy

proceedings, placed Yukos under supervision, appointed Mr. Rebgun as interim administrator,

and formally substituted Rosneft for the Western Banks as creditor.’

1076. The Tribunal recalls that around that time Mr. Theede appointed Mr. Aleksanyan to represent

Yukos in connection with the bankruptcy proceedings, but that within days of his appointment,
Mr. Aleksanyan was arrested on 6 April 2006 at his house by masked and armed men on
charges of money laundering and embezzlement allegedly committed when he was head of

Yukos’ legal department. '*#*

(b) The Treatment of Bankruptcy Claims; the Creditors’ Meeting; the
Declaration of Yukos’ Bankruptcy

1077. In accordance with Russian bankruptcy law, it was for Mr. Rebgun, as interim administrator of

Yukos, to convene a first meeting of Yukos’ creditors. At that meeting, Yukos’ creditors
would, under the options available under Russian Bankruptcy Law, vote either in favour of a

Rehabilitation Plan proposed by Yukos or for the alternative of a liquidation of Yukos.

1078. In anticipation of these steps, on 1 June 2006, Yukos convened an extraordinary general

1079. Claimants’ Rehabilitation Plan was based on, inter alia:

1080. On the same day that the shareholders approved the Rehabilitation Plan (i.e., on 1 June 2006),

Yukos’ counsel transmitted an “Outline of the Proposed Financial Rehabilitation Plan” to
Mr. Rebgun’s counsel in the U.S. (Chadbourne & Parke LLP), requesting that the
Rehabilitation Plan be placed on the agenda of the first meeting of Yukos’ creditors, and

circulated to all of Yukos’ registered creditors.

1083. At the hearing of 14 June 2006, a bankruptcy judge (not a tax judge) of the Moscow Arbitrazh

Court ruled in favour of the Federal Taxation Service “after taking just 15 minutes to consider
127,000 pages of information submitted by Russian tax officials,” admitting in their entirety as
valid bankruptcy claims the tax authorities’ claims based on years 2000-2003, plus 2004. In so
doing, the judge confirmed the Federal Taxation Service as Yukos’ largest creditor, with
registered claims of USD 13.06 billion (amounting to 60.5 percent of all registered bankruptcy

. 3.
claims). 1348

1084. Some two weeks later, the Court’s hearing on Yukos’ bankruptcy was postponed to | August

2006. The Court granted the postponement, noting that the “first meeting of creditors did not
take place because not all of the creditors’ claims submitted before the established deadline

have been reviewed by the Court.”!*”

1085. On 28 June 2006, Mr. Rebgun sent a revised notice of the first creditors’ meeting to be held on

20 July 2006 and invited registered creditors to consult the bankruptcy materials from 14 to
19 July 2006.'**° Claimants assert that Mr. Rebgun did not circulate the Rehabilitation Plan
that had been proposed by Yukos with his original notice of 2 June 2006.'**' Indeed, the
existence of the Rehabilitation Plan appears to have been notified to the creditors by
Mr. Rebgun only in his revised notice of 28 June 2006, and made available for review between

14 and 19 July.

1086. On 17 July 2006, the Moscow Arbitrazh Court admitted into the bankruptcy proceedings four

claims by YNG (now Rosneft’s subsidiary) based on the sale of oil produced by YNG and sold
to Yukos’ trading companies in 2004. The Court decided that Yukos, not the trading
companies, was liable to pay for the purchased oil. Thus, YNG’s registered claims (Rosneft’s)
were USD 4.42 billion (including penalties) or 22.16 percent of the claims admitted into the

bankruptcy proceedings at the time.'**

1087. In accordance with Mr. Rebgun’s revised notice of 28 June 2006, the first meeting of Yukos’

creditors was held on 20 July 2006. Creditors were offered two alternative scenarios: (1) the
Rehabilitation Plan proposed by Yukos’ management; and (2) the Analysis of Yukos’ Financial
Situation proposed by Mr. Rebgun. At the request of Federal Taxation Service, the meeting
was adjourned to 25 July 2006 to allow Mr. Rebgun to complete his Analysis with a separate

exhibit analyzing the possibility of Yukos’ breakeven activities.'***

1088. Mr. Rebgun’s Analysis did not contemplate the restoration of Yukos’ financial situation.

Instead, Mr. Rebgun concluded that Yukos’ remaining assets, totalling approximately
USD 17.75 billion after a deduction of a 24 percent profit tax, were not sufficient to cover the
USD 18.3 billion of registered bankruptcy claims. On this basis, Mr. Rebgun recommended
that Yukos be declared bankrupt and that receivership proceedings against Yukos be

initiated.'**

1089. On 25 July 2006, when the creditors’ meeting that had been adjourned resumed, the creditors

voted against the Rehabilitation Plan and recommended that Yukos be declared bankrupt.
Twenty-four creditors were admitted as voting participants to the creditors’ meeting. The
Tribunal notes that Respondent, through the Federal Taxation Service, and indirectly through
Rosneft (which had acquired the Western Banks’ claim under the A Loan) and YNG (now
Rosneft’s subsidiary), had 93.87% of the votes.'355

during 2000 to 2003. Thus, from July to October 2006, the Russian courts admitted over
USD 9.9 billion of claims by YNG into Yukos’ bankruptcy.'**”

1092. YNG was fully consolidated into Rosneft as of 1 October 2006.'*** As a result of this

consolidation, on 9 November 2006, the Moscow Arbitrazh Court ordered that YNG be
replaced by Rosneft as a bankruptcy creditor, thereby attributing to Rosneft all of the claims
registered to that time in the name of YNG. Eventually, adding a few minor claims, Rosneft

held USD 10.69 billion or 37.17% of all registered bankruptcy claims.'*”

1093. Under Russian bankruptcy law, Mr. Rebgun needed to select an appraiser in connection with

the liquidation of Yukos’ assets. On 23 October 2006, Mr. Rebgun selected a consortium of
five appraisers headed by ZAO ROSECO (“ROSECO”).'°°

1094. On 15 January 2007, ROSECO issued an appraisal report on Yukos’ assets, including the

some uncertainty, however, over what exactly the appraisers determined in respect of the value

of Yukos’ remaining assets.

1095. On 19 January 2007, Mr. Rebgun reportedly declared that his appraisers had valued Yukos’

assets at USD 22 billion.'** It was also reported that Mr. Rebgun later revised his valuation of
Yukos’ assets to USD 25.6 and 26.8 billion and indicated that “the liquidation discount during

the sale would not exceed 30 percent. Another article reported that the consortium of

appraisers had valued Yukos’ remaining assets at USD 33 billion.'*

bankruptcy auctions.'*’ These claims amounted to USD 8.82 billion.'***

activities as receiver, closed Yukos’ receivership, and ordered that Yukos be struck off the
register of legal entities.'*”” Yukos was struck off the register of companies and its shares were

legally extinguished on 21 November 2007.'*”'

3. Parties’ Arguments and Tribunal’s Observations

1100. In broad terms, Claimants allege that the Russian Federation decided to “push Yukos into

bankruptcy in order to redistribute its remaining assets.” In their Memorial, Claimants set out

what they characterized as Russia’s orchestrated plan to bankrupt and liquidate Yukos:

The Russian Federation ensured, through the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings at the
behest of Rosneft and using the cover of a consortium of Western banks (1), and through
the biased and discriminatory conduct of the proceedings by its courts, that the Russian
State and Rosneft would hold over 97% of the alleged claims against Yukos in the
bankruptcy (2). Having also made certain that Yukos’ rehabilitation plan would be
rejected (3), the Russian Federation completed its expropriation scheme by auctioning the
Company’s remaining assets. As a result of the bankruptcy and liquidation of Yukos, the
Russian State received directly more than 60.5% of the bankruptcy proceeds and, through
Rosnefi, more than 39.21% of the bankruptcy proceeds and all of Yukos’ main production
assets (4).

 

  

1101. Respondent rejects this suggestion, and argues instead that it was Yukos’ management that

forced the company into bankruptcy:

[T]he bankruptcy and ultimately the liquidation of Yukos was not the aim or the result of a
massive, global plot orchestrated by the Russian Government, but rather the inevitable
consequence of the consistent and repeated lawless and reckless misconduct of the
Oligarchs and the Yukos management they installed to conduct their—including
Claimants’—investment. '*”

1102. According to Respondent, “Claimants have failed to establish their primary contentions

regarding Yukos’ bankruptcy proceedings: that the bankruptcy was instigated ‘by the Russian
Federation through State-owned Rosneft,’ that ‘the only logic behind the decision to liquidate

Yukos was to expropriate the company,’ and that the proceedings were conducted improperly

so that the Russian Federation could ‘take its assets.’°”*

1103. The Parties’ arguments are related to and can be organized under the following two headings:
(a) why was the bankruptcy initiated and who was truly behind it? And (b) were the

bankruptcy proceedings conducted properly and fairly?

1104. The Parties’ arguments and the Tribunal’s observations on each of these are presented below.

(a) | Why was the Bankruptcy Initiated and Who was Truly Behind It?

1105. It is not contested that the non-payment of the A Loan was an important factor leading to the
bankruptcy of Yukos, since it was the creditor under the A Loan, the Western Banks, who
initiated the bankruptcy (consistent with terms agreed with Rosneft in the Confidential Sale
Agreement). There is disagreement, however, over the following two issues related to the

non-payment of the A Loan:

i) Who was responsible for the non-payment of the A Loan — was Yukos prevented
from paying by Respondent’s conduct, or did Yukos have some control over the

matter?

ii

Was the Confidential Sale Agreement a reasonable commercial arrangement between
the Western Banks, as creditor, and Rosneft, as parent of YNG, the guarantor of the
A Loan, or was it imposed on the Western Banks as part of Respondent’s deliberate
plan (executed through or with the assistance of Rosneft) to expropriate the remaining

assets of Yukos?

1106. Each of these issues is analyzed in the respective subsections below, followed by the Tribunal’s

observations on why the bankruptcy was initiated and who was truly behind it.

(i) Non-Payment of the A Loan

1107. The Parties present opposing views on the reasons for which the A Loan had not been paid off

by Yukos by the end of 2005.

574 Respondent’s Post-Hearing Brief § 122 (internal footnotes omitted).

- 356 -

1108. Respondent argues that the Western Banks were not paid simply because “Yukos adamantly

refused to pay.”'>”

In other words, according to Respondent, “Yukos’ dilatory and
obstructionist treatment of its commercial creditors paralleled closely its treatment of its tax
creditors.”""”° Respondent advances four arguments, as summarized at paragraphs 125 to 129

of its Post-Hearing Brief.

1109. Firstly, starting in January 2004, Yukos refused the syndicate’s requests for full prepayment of

the loan and denied the syndicate’s requests to subordinate the B Loan to the A Loan.
Secondly, Yukos “re-routed” its exports and chose to leave the banks with an unsecured non-
performing loan. Thirdly, Yukos failed to satisfy the English Judgment even though it had the
available resources to pay it, frustrating collection efforts in the United States and in the
Netherlands. Fourthly, Yukos engaged in “bad-faith negotiations” with the syndicate, which

eventually led the syndicate to contact Rosneft and come to an agreement with it.

1110. Claimants generally argue that “Yukos worked closely with [the syndicate] to ensure payment

of the debt” but that “at each step, the Russian Federation’s actions impeded the Company’s
efforts.”°"" Claimants submit that “[hjad the A Lenders not received an offer from Rosneft in
the interim, they too would have been paid out of the proceeds of the sale of the Dutch assets,

along with Moravel.”"°”8

1111. Each of Respondent’s specific arguments in relation to the non-payment of the A Loan is

addressed in the respective subsections below.

(a) Yukos’ Refusal to Fully Prepay the A Loan or to Subordinate the
B Loan

1112. Respondent argues that “[t]rouble arose almost immediately after the A Loan was funded.”"3”

It claims that the syndicate “first raised the possibility of Yukos’ bankruptcy” in early 2004.'**°

Transcript, Day 20 at 229 (Claimant’s rebuttal): “Indeed, Moravel would eventually be paid out from the proceeds of

proceeds of the sale of that asset had they not in the meantime received an offer that was difficult to refuse.”

In January 2004, the following options were discussed: full prepayment of the A Loan; partial
acceleration of the A Loan; additional security; and subordination of the B Loan to the
A Loan.'**' Respondent, relying on a news article, claims that the syndicate was “especially

concerned” with the so-called “giga-dividend.”"**

1113. After the syndicate served notice on Yukos of a potential event of default in April 2004,"

Respondent asserts that Yukos “compelled” its production subsidiaries YNG, Samaraneftegaz,

1384 85

and Tomskneft to provide guarantees'** and agreed to make pre-payments.'*** Respondent

notes that Yukos insisted that the A Loan and the B Loan be treated pari passu.'**°

1114. Respondent emphasizes that if Yukos had subordinated the B Loan, the syndicate would have

been paid in full.'**’ In response to Claimants’ argument that the loans were pari passu,'***

Respondent underlines that the B Loan “was nothing more and nothing less than a shareholder

391389

loan. Therefore, according to Respondent, there is nothing that prevented Yukos (or

Claimants) from agreeing to subordination.'*”

making the loan through an intermediary bank. And as a result, ultimately GML’s rights in the loan were assigned to
Moravel, which was its wholly owned subsidiary. So there is no doubt that this was a shareholder loan from the outset,
not a commercial loan.”

(b) The Export Contracts as Security for the A Loan

1116. On 2 July 2004, the syndicate declared an Event of Default, following the bailiff’s cash freeze

orders.'*? Respondent explains that, as Yukos claimed that it was unable to pay the relevant
amounts, the syndicate did not call the loan “but instead relied on the default as the basis to

access funds under the export trade guarantees.”!*°>

1117. The syndicate received payment through this security mechanism'*”* until the end of 2004 and

recovered around half of Yukos’ USD 1 billion obligation.'*°

27 December 2004, following the sale of YNG, Yukos notified the syndicate that it would

produced by its other oil production subsidiaries Samaraneftegaz and Tomskneft” but that it
“simply manipulated the export stream so that the oil was not exported pursuant to the specific

export agreements used to secure the A Loan.”'*°”

1118. At the Hearing, Mr. Theede asserted that there was “no cash from exported oil to be used to pay

the banks” because of a sweep by the tax authorities.'** Respondent responds that this is
“simply false,”"*”” and seeks to demonstrate that none of the funds under the export guarantee
came from Yukos accounts, whether in Russia or elsewhere.'*”°

reduced its claim to judgment, obtaining the English Judgment in June 200:

1121. Respondent faults Yukos for seeking to frustrate the syndicate’s efforts to collect on the English

Judgment, in the United States, the Netherlands, and Russia.'“* Respondent puts particular
emphasis on the Dutch Stichtings.'*”° Respondent argues that Yukos must be faulted for its use
of the Stichtings to put its foreign assets out of reach of not just Rosneft or the tax authorities,
but also of the Western Banks. Respondent contends that that the creation of the Stichtings
“constitutes a blatant violation of Russian bankruptcy and criminal law.”'“°’ Respondent also
submitted with its Rejoinder an expert report by Professor Dr. Albert Jan van den Berg (the
“Van den Berg Report”), arguing that the creation of the Stichtings was illegal under Dutch

law, 407

1122. Professor Van den Berg concludes that the creation of the Stichtings was:

illegal, as it goes against the Dutch law principle, discussed in length above, that does not
permit a company, or its directors, to transfer its assets for the purpose of making it more
difficult for a creditor to satisfy its claims against the company and its assets, or for the
new ultimate parent company to exercise control, even when the company reacts to what it
believes to be illegitimate acts.

In this connection, the establishment of the Stichting-structure (including the issuance of
depositary receipts) as a protective device was not valid either, as it qualifies as a
permanent protective device and, in any event, was established to make it more difficult for
creditors to collect on debts.'4°*

conclusions stand unrebutted.

1124. In response to Respondent’s claim that the Stichtings were created to frustrate the syndicate’s

collection efforts, Claimants state that Respondent “misrepresents the purpose” of the

1410

Stichtings. Claimants argue that the Stichtings “sought to protect certain [assets] from

further attack by the Respondent and in the best interests of the Yukos group, its management,

employees, shareholders and legitimate creditors.”'"'' At the Hearing, Mr. Theede asserted that

the Stichtings were created to remove certain assets from the reach of Respondent: '"”

after [the YNG auction] happened, it became very obvious that we were not going to be
able to do anything to protect our Russian assets; they were going to take them away from
us, one way or another. And of course it was going to be through taxes: that was the
decided approach.

But we were presented with a way to add some additional security to our international

assets.

satisfy the English Judgment, and that, had the syndicate not accepted an offer it could not

refuse from Rosneft in the meanwhile, the proceeds of the sale of Mazeikiu Nafta would have

been applied to the English Judgment.'’*'® Claimants claim that Respondent was actively

1126. Respondent criticizes Claimant’s assertion that Yukos was unable to satisfy the English
Judgment because of the asset freeze.'*'* Respondent emphasizes that counsel for Yukos in the

English proceedings stated that the

evidence would show that Yukos had assets outside Russia free from the Russian court’s
freezing order which could have been, and which still could be, exploited to raise money
with which to make payments under the Loan Agreement as they became due.'*!

1127. Respondent also notes that Mr. Misamore conceded at the Hearing that when Stichting 2 was
formed in September 2005, it held approximately USD 500 million in cash, more than enough
to satisfy the debt to the syndicate.”

notes that Yukos offered the syndicate a “poisoned chalice”: seats on the board of a stichting in

collection efforts in the Netherlands, it withdrew its settlement offer to the syndicate."

(ii) |The Confidential Sale Agreement Between the Western Banks and
Rosneft

1132. Claimants argue that, while it was the Western Banks that formally initiated the bankruptcy of

Yukos, it was the Russian Federation, acting through Rosneft, that orchestrated the
commencement of the bankruptcy. In particular, Claimants place great emphasis on the
Confidential Sale Agreement that was entered into between the Western Banks and Rosneft on
13 December 2005. Pursuant to that Agreement, Rosneft agreed to satisfy the outstanding debt
owed by Yukos to the Western Banks (over USD 455 million plus interest) in exchange for the
Western Banks agreeing to take the steps described in Schedule 8 of the Confidential Sale

Agreement, entitled “Application for Bankruptcy.”

1133. Claimants assert that each of Rosneft, on the one hand, and the Western Banks, on the other,

fulfilled their respective roles under the Confidential Sale Agreement meticulously. Thus, on
6 March 2006, having completed the other steps contemplated under the Confidential Sale
Agreement, the Western Banks filed a petition with the Moscow Arbitrazh Court to declare

Rosneft in the place of the Western Banks for the purposes of the bankruptcy proceedings. '“"!

1134. Respondent explains that the Confidential Sale Agreement was concluded between Rosneft and

the Western Banks because of the “convergence of their commercial interests”:

The SocGen syndicate simultaneously also sought payment of the same debt from Rosneft
pursuant to the 2004 loan guarantee that Yukos had foisted on YNG, which Rosneft then
owned. Although Rosneft disputed the validity of the guarantee, Rosneft required
forbearance from the same banks on covenant breaches arising from the YNG acquisition,
and Rosneft needed the bank’s cooperation for its planned IPO. The convergence of the
syndicate’s and Rosneft’s commercial interests resulted in their agreeing that Rosneft

would pay the syndicate in full, but only after the syndicate had pursued all legal avenues
to obtain payment from Yukos, the primary obligor. If Rosneft instead paid, the
syndicate’s rights under the A Loan agreement were to be assigned to Rosneft.'*”

1135. Respondent disagrees with Claimants that the confidentiality clause in the Confidential Sale

Agreement evidences a “conspiracy on the part of the SocGen syndicate to act secretly on

behalf of Rosneft, which Claimants improperly equate with Resp .” Instead, Resp
contends that the confidentiality clause was a standard commercial term “necessary to preserve
the possibility that Yukos would pay the SocGen syndicate before Rosneft became
unconditionally obligated to do so, and remained in effect only for so long as Yukos’ payment

would have discharged Rosneft’s own obligations to pay the syndicate.”'**

1136. Respondent argues that the syndicate “ha[d] been nothing if not patient during this whole

process”'*™ and that, in its frustrated effort to satisfy the English Judgment, the syndicate in last

1435,

resort turned to Rosneft for payment under the YNG guarantee. After “a little bit of a dance

going on between them,” the syndicate and Rosneft concluded a mutually advantageous

deal,!36

rationale for why Rosneft would insist upon the further _and highly unusual step that the

A Lenders initiate bankruptcy proceedings against Yukos, save for the sake of appearances.”'*”

1139. The Parties also disagree when it comes to the significance of the separate and parallel

bankruptcy petition filed by YNG (then a subsidiary of Rosneft) on 24 March 2006. According
to Respondent, the YNG petition “alone disposes of Claimants’ contention that the bankruptcy
filing by the SocGen syndicate had been orchestrated by the Russian Federation so as to allow

Rosneft not to ‘appear as the instigator of Yukos’ bankruptey.””"“#

1140. According to Claimants, Rosneft had decided to “hedge its bets” by filing a separate

bankruptcy petition through YNG in the event the court would reject the petition filed by the
banks.'““* Claimants further contend that having the syndicate file its petition prior to YNG

as “evidently important to Rosneft and the Kremlin’s public relations efforts.”'“**

Finally,
Claimants argue that the YNG petition refutes Respondent’s argument that Yukos itself caused
the bankruptcy by failing to pay the syndicate: “Respondent offers no explanation as to how
the Claimants suffered additional damages because it was the Société Générale syndicate who

initiated the bankruptcy rather than Rosneft.”'““°

(iii) Tribunal’s Observations

1141. Having considered the extensive record and the maze of documents as well as the Parties’

arguments, the Tribunal concludes that while it is undisputed that the Western Banks formally
initiated the bankruptcy proceedings, and that Yukos is partly to blame for giving the Banks the
incentive to enter into the Confidential Sale Agreement with Rosneft, the role of Rosneft and of

Respondent in creating the conditions for Yukos’ bankruptcy cannot be ignored.

1142. Turning firstly to the fault that Yukos bears in this matter, the Tribunal largely accepts

Respondent’s arguments that Yukos could have paid the A Loan in full prior to the end of 2005,
whether by subordinating the B Loan to the A Loan, allowing the export contracts to continue

to operate as security for the Western Banks, or indeed using assets that were placed into the

Stichtings. It can therefore be said that Yukos is not without fault in connection with the
initiation of the bankruptcy, since it contributed to creating conditions that gave the Western
Banks every incentive to enter into the Confidential Sale Agreement with Rosneft, and it was
pursuant to that Confidential Sale Agreement that the Banks initiated bankruptcy proceedings
against Yukos in exchange for payment from Rosneft under the A Loan. As Mr. Theede
testified, banks being banks, the solution presented by the Confidential Sale Agreement was

“an easy, low-risk way out of this for them.”!“”

1143. However, to focus only on these narrow reasons for non-payment of the A Loan, and on the

commercial considerations that drove the Western Banks to enter into the Confidential Sale
Agreement, is to miss the bigger picture. The Tribunal observes that Yukos was current in its
payments to the Western Banks until December 2004, when YNG was auctioned to Rosneft.
Had YNG not been seized, therefore, it is reasonable to assume that Yukos would not have had
problems repaying the A Loan. By the same token, given the circumstances under which YNG
was seized (discussed in Chapter VIII.F of this Award), it stands to reason that Yukos felt
justified in forcing Respondent, through Rosneft, to pay the Western Banks under the YNG

guarantee, rather than paying the debt itself.

1144. The Tribunal therefore cannot accept Respondent’s argument that because Yukos, even after

the seizure of YNG, could have paid the Western Banks under the A Loan but did not do so,
there is no link to be made between Rosneft (and, indeed, Respondent) and the bankruptcy.
The big picture established by the record, including in respect of the tax assessments and the

auction of YNG, suggests otherwise.

1145. The Tribunal’s conclusion is also supported by two particular facts more closely related to the

enforcement of the A Loan in Russia.

1146. Firstly, the Tribunal notes that the Western Banks entered into the Confidential Sale Agreement

14a7

with Rosneft very soon after the Federal Arbitrazh Court for the Moscow District reversed an
earlier decision that had authorized the enforcement of the English Judgment, and that the same
Court ultimately allowed the Western Banks to proceed with its enforcement after it had
entered into the Confidential Sale Agreement. This suggests to the Tribunal, at best, a very
happy coincidence as between the decision of the Court and the interests served by the terms

presented to the Western Banks in the Confidential Sale Agreement. It is also consistent with

Transcript, Day 10 at 113 (cross-examination of Mr. Theede).

- 366 -

Claimants’ argument that the decisions of the Court and the conduct of Rosneft were being

coordinated as part of a deliberate strategy to drive Yukos into bankruptcy.

1147. Secondly, if Rosneft itself (or the State, as its owner) were not interested in orchestrating the

initiation of the bankruptcy proceedings against Yukos, why was the requirement to initiate
bankruptcy included in the Confidential Sale Agreement? In other words, while the Tribunal
can accept both that the Western Banks had a commercial interest in getting paid by Rosneft
(especially after the 5 December 2005 decision of the Federal Arbitrazh Court that reversed the
enforcement of the English Judgment) and that Rosneft had a commercial interest in having the
Western Banks’ claim against Yukos assigned to it in exchange for such payment, the Tribunal
does not see any evident commercial rationale for the inclusion in the Confidential Sale

Agreement of the requirement that the Banks initiate bankruptcy in order to be paid.

1148. It thus appears to the Tribunal that the Western Banks, since Yukos was not reimbursing the

loan, were actively “encouraged” to enter into the Confidential Sale Agreement in order to
accomplish their objective of being paid. While, as the Tribunal said earlier, Yukos must
shoulder some of the blame for not paying the Western Banks and thereby increasing its
exposure to the risk that it could be petitioned into bankrupcy, it appears undeniable to the
Tribunal that initiating bankruptcy was not a goal of the Western Banks, but rather the
objective of Rosneft, in the interests of its owner, the Russian Federation. The Tribunal
concludes that in the end the bankruptcy was initiated by the Russian Federation. The separate
and parallel bankruptcy petition filed by Rosneft-controlled YNG on 24 March 2006 reinforces

this conclusion.

1149. The Tribunal, in light of the evidence reviewed above, finds the following passage from

148

Claimants’ Post-Hearing Brief compelling and adopts it as its own:

The only rational explanation for the highly unusual manner in which the bankruptcy
proceedings against Yukos were initiated was to act as a cover for the Russian Federation’s
involvement, allowing the Russian government to keep its word—in the context of
ongoing legal proceedings, including these arbitrations—that it was not interested in the
bankruptcy of Yukos (and thus maintaining the appearance that it was commercial
parties—not the State—that sought Yukos’ bankruptcy), while achieving its desired
end.

(b) Were the Bankruptcy Proceedings Conducted Properly and Fairly?

1150. Claimants paint the bankruptcy as “the final act of the destruction” of Yukos.'“? Claimants

1450

argue that Respondent (or entities whose conduct is attributable to Respondent)” not only

initiated the bankruptcy, but also (i) ensured that it monopolized the bankruptcy process by

discriminatory rejection and allowance of bankruptcy claims; isl

Yukos’ proposed Rehabilitation Plan;'** and (iii) confiscated the residual assets of Yukos

(ii) ensured the rejection of

through sham auctions and Yukos’ eventual liquidation.'***

1151. Claimants claim that Respondent monopolized the bankruptcy and, directly or indirectly,

obtained 97.67 percent of all bankruptcy claims, obtained approximately 93.87 percent of the
votes in the creditors’ meeting, claimed USD 6 billion in profit tax on the auction proceedings,
acquired over 95 percent of Yukos’ remaining assets in the bankruptcy, and received as creditor

approximately 99.71 percent of the bankruptcy proceeds.'***

(i) — The Courts’ Treatment of Bankruptcy Claims

1152. Claimants argue that the Russian courts never had the interests of Yukos or its rehabilitation in

1450

Masi

1452

1453

las4

1455

1456

mind when conducting the bankruptcy proceedings. Firstly, the Russian courts ensured that the
Russian State would become Yukos’ main creditor in the bankruptcy proceedings by
postponing the date of the first meeting of Yukos’ creditors to give the State “more time to

prove new tax claims” against Yukos.'*°*

These tax claims comprised Yukos’ outstanding
alleged tax liabilities for the years 2000 to 2003. As noted above, at the hearing of the Moscow
Arbitrazh Court on 14 June 2006, the bankruptcy judge ruled in favour of the Federal Taxation
Service, setting “a new speed reading record” after taking just 15 minutes to consider 127,000

pages of information submitted by Russian tax officials.’ As a result of that judgment, the

Federal Taxation Service became Yukos’ single largest creditor with registered claims

1457

amounting to approximately USD 13.06 billion.

1153. Secondly, Claimants contend that the Russian courts ensured that State-controlled Rosneft—of

which the Russian State has been the majority shareholder since the company’s privatization in
the nineties—would become Yukos’ second largest creditor in the bankruptcy. On 17 July
2006, the Moscow Arbitrazh Court admitted into the bankruptcy proceedings four claims by
YNG, which by that that time had already become a subsidiary of Rosneft:

The claims were based on the sale of oil produced by Yuganskneftegaz and sold to Yukos’
trading companies in 2004: the Court decided that Yukos, and not the trading

i i ding that those ies were Y k ”s counterparties
under the relevant oil sale contracts—was liable to pay for the oil sold.'***

1154. Thirdly, in Claimants’ view, the Russian courts ensured that creditor claims belonging to

Yukos-related entities or to Yukos’ shareholders would not be recognized in the bankruptcy
proceedings. For example, in its Memorial on the Merits, Claimants explain the Russian

courts’ treatment of Moravel Investment Limited, a GML affiliate:

This was the case, for example, for the claim filed by Moravel Investment Limited
(“Moravel”), a GML affiliate, on the basis of an LCIA award of September 16, 2005,
rendered by an arbitral tribunal comprised of Peter Leaver QC, Jonathan Hirst QC and
J. William Rowley QC, Chairman. The award ordered Yukos to pay to Moravel
US$ 655,725,238.60 in principal plus corresponding interest, which was outstanding under
the B Loan Agreement concluded between Yukos and Société Générale in September 2003
for the purposes of Yukos’ merger with Sibneft. This loan was identical, in all material
aspects, to the A Loan which had been assigned to Rosneft by the Western Banks headed
by Société Générale and on the basis of which Rosneft had been admitted into the
bankruptcy proceedings. However, unlike Rosneft’s claim, for which the Russian courts
had recognized the English Judgment rendered in favor of the Western banks (later
assigned to Rosneft), the courts refused the enforcement of the awards in favor of
Moravel.

1155. Russian courts accorded similar treatment to the remaining Yukos affiliates with outstanding

claims against Yukos, such as Yukos Capital SARL, Glendale Group Limited, OOO

(ii) | The Rejection of Yukos’ Rehabilitation Plan

1156.On 1 June 2006, Yukos’ general shareholders’ meeting approved Yukos’ Financial

Rehabilitation Plan and appointed Mr. Osborne as the shareholders’ representative in the
bankruptcy proceedings.'“' Claimants point out that according to Yukos’ Rehabilitation Plan,
Yukos was in a position to pay off its alleged liabilities fully within two years." Mr. Rebgun,
the appointed administrator, was required to circulate Yukos’ Rehabilitation Plan to all Yukos’
registered creditors. According to Claimants, Mr. Rebgun did not do so, although Respondent
alleges that Mr. Rebgun made the Rehabilitation Plan available for the creditors’ review before

the creditors’ meeting.

1157. Mr. Rebgun’s own proposal to the creditors was to sell all Yukos’ assets to satisfy the creditors’

claims and then liquidate the company. At the creditors’ meeting of 25 July 2006, at which the
Federal Taxation Service and Rosneft held 93.87 percent of votes, Yukos’ Rehabilitation Plan
was rejected, and the creditors decided to liquidate Yukos, “which had the added bonus of
creating an additional claim for the tax authorities of 24% profit tax on the auction proceedings,

aclaim on which it would collect US$ 6 billion.“

1158. In their Post-Hearing Brief, Claimants further contend that:

During the hearing, the Respondent made a limited number of unfounded attacks on
Yukos’ Financial Rehabilitation Plan. For example, the Respondent alleged that Yukos’
Financial Rehabilitation Plan was “highly speculative” as the “cash pool” was to be funded
from “uncertain revenues” including USS 18 billion from “litigation claims.” However, as
even the most cursory review of the Plan reveals, “litigation claims” were not ascribed a
value in determining the aggregate value of Yukos’ assets available to pay claims and were
merely intended to supplement the “cash pool”, if and when anything was received.'**

1159. Yukos’ creditors gathered for their first meeting on 20 July 2006. Yukos’ management

Situation. After the meeting was adjourned and resumed on 25 July 2006, the Federal

Taxation Service, representing together with Rosneft 93.87 percent of the votes, voted against

the Rehabilitation Plan and in favor of the liquidation of Yukos.'“”

1160. Claimants argue that the decision to liquidate was “preposterou[s], even from an economic

standpoint!“

and that “[t]he absurdity of Yukos’ fate was only the flip side of the coin of the
Russian Federation’s and Rosneft’s fortune.”'* Claimants allege that there was an “obvious
conflict of interest” in the vote as the sales of Yukos’ assets were subject to a 24 percent profit
tax, “which meant that liquidation would bring an enormous windfall to the Federal Taxation

Service”,'"”

1161. Respondent denies all allegations of impropriety in relation to Mr. Rebgun’s conduct of the

creditors’ meeting and the rejection of Yukos’ Rehabilitation Plan:

All registered creditors and the representatives of the debtor had an opportunity to review
the Rehabilitation Plan and the analysis of Yukos’ financial situation (along with relevant
enclosures) prepared by Mr. Rebgun at his offices during the week preceding the meeting
(and for five full days, from July 20, 2006 until July 25, 2006).'47!

1162. Respondent contends that the Rehabilitation Plan was rejected because it was flawed and overly

optimistic:

Yukos’ management, actively supported by the Claimants, had the opportunity to present a
rehabilitation claim to the meeting of creditors. The rough outline management submitted
was, however, legally defective and did not provide any basis for creditors to prefer
rehabilitation to liquidation. It was not properly presented to or approved by Yukos
shareholders, did not meet the legal requirements that the company’s tax claims be
satisfied within six months, and did not ensure full, let alone timely, payment of Yukos’
creditors’ claims.'4”

1163. Respondent argues that the Rehabilitation Plan was “a blatant and untenable attempt on the part

1164. Respondent underlines that in Russia, “the vote for the liquidation or rehabilitation of the

debtor is within the full discretion of the creditors.”'4"4

1165. On the question of the late claims, Respondent does not contest that the Federal Taxation Service

claimed USD 8.82 billion in profit taxes out of the proceeds of the bankruptcy and eventually
received USD 6.02 billion; it submits however, that “[t]hese are standard ‘/ate’ claims that arise in
connection with any sale generating profits, including in the context of rehabilitation

proceedings’ and that there is therefore nothing improper about them.

(iii) The Declaration of Yukos’ Bankruptcy

1166. On 1 August 2006, the Moscow Arbitrazh Court stated that it had “established that the debtor

showed the signs of bankruptcy as defined in Article 3 of the Federal Law ‘On Insolvency
(Bankruptcy)’” and that Yukos had “not fulfilled its monetary obligations towards its creditors
for three months from the time when these obligations should have been fulfilled,” without

making any reference to the difference between Yukos’ liabilities and its assets.'*”°

1167. The Claimants assert that on 1 August 2006, when Yukos was declared bankrupt, “Yukos’

473

assets exceeded its alleged liabilities, and... the Company was clearly solvent." The
Claimants further suggest that “there was nothing inevitable about the bankruptcy of Yukos”
and that “Yukos could have avoided bankruptcy if allowed to pay off its fabricated tax
debts.”“”* To support this claim, Claimants refer to the Rehabilitation Plan proposed by
Yukos’ management, which proposed “to leave intact Yukos’ ‘core assets’ as a viable ongoing

company, while addressing and paying in full all valid creditors’ claims.”'*”

By contrast, Respondent points out that the insolvency test applicable to the initiation of
bankruptcy proceedings against Yukos was an “illiquidity test,” based on the debtor’s inability
to discharge a certain debt “within three months of its due date.”'*’ According to Respondent,
this “illiquidity test” was satisfied when the Western Banks filed a petition for Yukos’

1481

bankruptcy. Further, the question of whether the bankruptcy proceedings will result in the

adoption of a financial rehabilitation plan and the company’s survival or in the company’s
liquidation depends on whether the financial rehabilitation plan provides for the discharge of all

debt repayment schedule in the Rehabilitation Plan did not do so.

Respondent denies all allegations of impropriety or bias relating to the way the Russian courts

conducted the bankruptcy proceedings:

As confirmed by the Moscow Arbitrazh Court, the syndicate’s petition satisfied the
insolvency test under Russian bankruptcy law applicable at the time, which was based on
the debtor’s inability to discharge a debt exceeding US$ 3,500 within three months of its
due date.

Nothing in Russian law in this regard concerning the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings
is at odds with international practice. In a number of other jurisdictions, the so-called
“illiquidity test: (i.e, the debtor’s inability to pay its debts as they become due) is sufficient
to initiate bankruptcy proceedings."

In any event, Respondent claims that Yukos’ liabilities did exceed its assets, a position
Respondent seeks to support by stressing that, after the sale of Yukos’ assets, liabilities of

Yukos in an amount of USD 9.2 billion remained unsatisfied.'**°

(iv) The Liquidation of Yukos’ Remaining Assets

1172. Claimants’ argument regarding the auctions does not point to specific acts. While Claimants

fault Rosneft for the initiation of the bankruptcy, the courts for the discriminatory rejection and
allowance of claims, the Federal Taxation Service and Rosneft for the rejection of the
Rehabilitation Plan, they fault “the Russian Federation” for the auctions.'“** Claimants state

»!48° Claimants argue that the small number

of bidders, the speed of the auctions, the below-market-value resulting prices, and the overall
benefits to Respondent leave no doubt about Respondent’s “monopolization” of the

auctions.’

1173. Claimants note that Respondent as creditor in the bankruptcy was involved in the auctions in

four ways. Firstly, it approved the procedure for the auctions'“*' and Mr. Rebgun’s allotment of
Yukos’ assets into twenty lots.’ Secondly, it selected the Russian Federal Property Fund to
1493

organize and conduct the auctions. Thirdly, it set the starting price for the auctioned

assets.'44 Fourthly, it “actively communicated with [Mr. Rebgun] on other issues as well.”"°5

1174. Respondent underlines that this involvement was in accordance with Russian law and

emphasizes that Respondent as creditor in the bankruptcy did not have the power to control the
identity of the bidders, and that in each instance the starting price for the auctioned assets was

at least equal to the appraised market value.'*°°

“Rosneft [having] won 11 out of the 17 bankruptcy auctions, including acquiring

Samaraneftegaz (Lot No. 11) and Tomskeneft (Lot No. 10.78

1176. In their Skeleton Argument, Claimants summarize the eleven auctions that completed the

bankruptcy proceedings as follows:

Yukos’ remaining assets were transferred to the Russian State at well below their fair
market value through a series of 17 auctions held between March 2006 and August 2007.
Rosneft thereby directly or indirectly acquired Yukos’ key remaining assets, including
Samaraneftegaz (Lot No. 11) and Tomskneft (Lot No. 10), which were sold at a gross
discount of approximately 37% and 33%, respectively, of their fair market value. For its
part, Gazprom acquired through Eni/Enel the 20% minus | share stake in Sibneft that the
Russian Federation had persistently refused to let Yukos sell to pay off alleged tax debts.
As with the sham auction of Yuganskneftegaz, there was no genuine competition in the
bankruptcy auctions and, in many instances, including those for Samaraneftegaz and
Tomsknefi, the only participants were Rosneft and a previously unknown entity whose sole
role was to satisfy the formal requirement that there be a minimum of 2 bidders.

Finally, when, by the end of July 2007, it became clear that despite the low auction prices,
the bankruptcy might still generate some surplus, further claims were admitted in the
bankruptcy proceedings on behalf of the Russian State, through the Federal Taxation
Service and Rosneft. This ensured the completeness of Yukos” destruction and the transfer
of its value and assets to the Russian State. Thus, the Russian Federation received, either
directly or through State-owned Rosneft or Gazprom, approximately 99.71% of the
bankruptcy proceeds and over 95% of Yukos’ remaining assets, including all of Yukos’
main production assets.

On November 12, 2007, the Moscow Arbitrazh Court formally endorsed all the activities
of Yukos’ receiver Mr. Rebgun, closed the Company’s receivership and ordered that
Yukos be struck off the register of legal entities. The latter happened on November 21,
2007.'°

1177. Respondent contends that Yukos’ bankruptcy auctions were held in full compliance with

Russian law, and that Mr. Rebgun had secured appraisals for the fair value of the assets:

Once Yukos’ liquidation was properly approved, the company’s assets were sold at auction
in accordance with Russian law and international practice. Yukos’ receiver obtained
appraisals for the fair value of the assets, and used those appraisals to set minimum bids in
the auctions, all of which were exceeded, some by very large margins. The auctions were
open to domestic and foreign bidders, adequately noticed and advertised, and competitive.
To the extent that any bidders may have been discouraged from participating, this was
again the result of Claimants and Yukos having threatened potential bidders with legal
action. While the aggregate results exceeded Yukos’ own (and other) contemporaneous
fair market value estimates, more than US$9 billion in creditor claims nonetheless
remained unsatisfied.'*

(v) | Tribunal’s Observations

1178. The Tribunal notes Respondent’s insistence that all aspects of the bankruptcy were conducted
in accordance with Russian bankruptcy law. However, the Tribunal’s inquiry is not limited to
a mere review of the formalities of the bankruptcy. It must address and review all the

substantial features of the proceedings.

1179. Thus, the Tribunal views as improper and unfair that, for example:

. All claims filed by Rosneft and the Federal Taxation Service, valued in the billions, were
peremptorily accepted by the Court, while the many claims filed by Yukos’ affiliated

companies were rejected by the Court in a very summary way; and

. Yukos was saddled with a claim of some USD 6 billion that related only to the profit tax
to be collected by the Federal Taxation Service as a result of the liquidation of Yukos’
assets in the bankruptey.'*"!

. The Tribunal is also troubled by the fact that Rosneft’s acquisition of YNG (discussed in
Chapter VIII.F of this Award) generated a claim of almost USD 10 billion against Yukos
in the bankruptcy, including a claim based on the attribution to Yukos of debts owed to
YNG by Yukos’ trading companies. Since the Tribunal has already found that Rosneft’s
acquisition of YNG was, to say the least, questionable, in its view, this claim is equally

questionable.

1180. In light of the above conclusions, the Tribunal cannot accept that it was in any sense proper or
fair for the creditors’ committee to reject the Rehabilitation Plan, for the court to declare Yukos
bankrupt, or for Yukos to have been deprived of all of its remaining assets through a hasty and
questionable liquidation process. On the contrary, it is evident to the Tribunal that the totality
of the bankruptcy proceedings reviewed in this chapter were not part of a process for the
collection of taxes but rather, as submitted by Claimants, indeed the “final act of the destruction
of the Company by the Russian Federation and the expropriation of its assets for the sole

benefit of the Russian State and State-owned companies Rosneft and Gazprom.”

1501

  

The Tribunal notes that this claim or liability was considered in determining whether Yukos should be liquidated or
rehabilitated, and indeed declared bankrupt, and the Federal Taxation Service itself—which stood to benefit from that
claim—had a majority vote at the creditors’ meeting.

- 376 -

1181. The Tribunal notes that its conclusions are consistent with those of the Ros/nvestCo tribunal

and the Quasar tribunal.
1182. With respect to the bankruptcy proceedings, the Ros/nvestCo tribunal concluded as follows:

Though the Tribunal did not find the bankruptcy auctions to be conducted contrary to
Russian law, this does not change the general impression from the evidence on file for the
Tribunal, since the application for bankruptcy by the SocGen Group was also conducted by
association with the State-controlled company, Rosneft, and that they fitted into the
obvious general pattern and obvious intention of the totality of the scheme to deprive

Yukos of its assets.'*”?

1183. The Quasar tribunal concluded:

141, The Tribunal has carefully considered each of the Respondent’s defences, but is
ultimately unpersuaded by them. The issue here is not one of the legality of the bankruptcy
proceedings, nor their conformity with Russian bankruptcy regulations. Rather, it is
whether the steps that were taken can properly and fairly be characterised as part of an
ordinary process of collecting taxes. In the Tribunal’s view, they cannot fairly be so
characterised, particularly when viewed against the broader chronology of which they form
part (as summarised later in this section). This conclusion is not overcome by the
Respondent's various technical analyses of the consortium agreement.

157. But the Tribunal also notes that, as a result of these auctions, “at the end of the day”
... the Russian Federation has ended up with 93% of Yukos Oil Company.” . . .

158. As summarised below, the overall chronology of which the liquidation auctions
form part, casts them and their outcome in a particular light. After careful consideration of
the entire record, the Tribunal concludes that, as with the preceding events, the liquidation
auctions were part of the same overall scheme of confiscation. In this regard, the
Tribunal’s findings are consistent with those of the Ros/nvest Tribunal. ... The ECHR’s
finding to the contrary—i.e., that Yukos failed to prove that the Russian Federation “had
misused those [enforcement] proceedings with a view to destroying the company and
taking control of its assets”—must be understood as based on a heightened requirement of
“incontrovertible and direct proof,” given the “wide margin of appreciation” a State enjoys
under Protocol No. | to the European Convention on Human Rights. . . .

 

H. THE WITHDRAWAL OF PWC’s AUDIT OPINIONS
1. Introduction
1184. As noted earlier in this Award, Yukos’ auditor, PwC, withdrew its audit reports for Yukos in

June 2007. This withdrawal was often mentioned, mostly by Respondent’s counsel, during

these proceedings. Although neither Party called as a witness anyone from PwC, the Tribunal

has formed the view that it is essential for it to review PwC’s role in the present Awards.

PwC was Yukos’ auditor from 1997 to 2004. It also played an advisory role to Yukos,
consulting on the company’s domestic and international structures. On 15 June 2007, PwC
formally withdrew all its prior audit reports for Yukos for the period from 31 December 1995
until 31 December 2004, stating that “new information” had led it to conclude that such reports
could no longer be relied upon as trustworthy.'°°°

. Claimants say that the Russian Government exerted pressure on PwC to withdraw the audits in
order to bolster the legitimacy of the destruction of Yukos. The harassment of PwC, say
Claimants, took the form of searches, seizures, interrogations, criminal charges, two tax
lawsuits, and the potential loss of clients and its license to do business in Russia. Rather than
risk its business and employees for the sake of a client that was “no longer a going concern,”

PwC chose the “only viable option,” namely to cooperate with the Russian authorities by

finding pretexts to withdraw its Yukos audits.'°°°

In contrast, Respondent says that PwC and Yukos had had a troubled relationship for a long
time, noting that PwC refused to audit the company after 2004. During interrogations of PwC
auditor Douglas Miller in May and June 2007, PwC received credible “new” information
showing that Yukos’ senior management had repeatedly lied to its auditors, confirming PwC’s
prior suspicions on four particular issues, and causing PwC to lose confidence in the content of
its audit reports. At the time, Yukos was in bankruptcy and former executives and company
records were no longer accessible. PwC thus could not conduct satisfactory inquiries to
determine how the new information affected the audited financial statements. In the
circumstances, the “only viable option” for PwC was to withdraw the audits, a move endorsed

and approved by Respondent’s audit expert, Mr. Ellison.'*°”

1508

. No witnesses from PwC were presented by the Parties. PwC is not on trial before this

Tribunal. The Tribunal draws no conclusions in this Award on PwC’s professional conduct.

Nevertheless, the events surrounding PwC’s withdrawal of the Yukos audits help to inform the
Tribunal’s view as to whether Yukos was the object of a series of politically-motivated attacks,
or is now simply “blaming the Russian Federation for the consequences of its own

misconduct.”

2. Chronology

1189. Absent direct testimony from PwC, the Tribunal must draw its conclusions from the testimony

of Claimants’ witnesses; correspondence amongst Yukos, PwC, external advisors and the
Russian authorities; and the testimony of PwC personnel before other fora. There are also

contemporaneous U.S. State Department cables, which emerged via “Wikileaks” and reveal

the “candid””’'*"° and “unguarded”'*"' views of PwC’s senior management.

(a) PwC Serves as Both Auditor and Consultant to Yukos

1190. From 1997, Yukos was one of PwC’s major clients in Russia. At the Hearing, Claimants’

witnesses described a “perfectly normal”, “cordial and close” business relationship in which
PwC was a “permanent partner of Yukos and its subsidiaries for a long time.”'*’? PwC

conducted Yukos’ external audits and assisted with training Yukos’ in-house accountants. PwC

s1513

played an “integral role in developing Yukos’ financial reporting system, and, according to

Mr. Theede, “PwC’s consulting arm was actually the architect of [the trading company]

structures.”!°!4

1191. Mr. Kosciusko-Morizet testified that “from 1997 to 2004, PwC was given access to the entire

1509

1510

1513

1514

documentation of the whole of the Yukos group without restriction and had a very detailed and
global view of the financial situation and the procedures of Yukos and its subsidiaries.”'*'° It

was a consistent theme among Claimants’ witnesses that PwC enjoyed full access to Yukos”

accounts, employees and information, “including related-party transactions, shareholders, costs

[and] taxation.”'"© PwC also maintained a permanent staff presence within Yukos and
performed site visits to Yukos entities.'*'”

1192. Claimants’ witnesses pointed out that PwC never voiced complaints about access to the

company or any of its staff. Mr. Kosciusko-Morizet affirmed that PwC was “perfectly able to
check for themselves any documentation, ask for any documentation anywhere in the group at
any level.”!*'* Mr. Misamore observed that if PwC “did not have sufficient information, they
should have asked for more.”'*"” It is interesting to note that in 1998 PwC initially refused to
sign the Yukos financials, as it was unable to resolve which trading companies should be
consolidated as “controlled by Yukos and used for tax optimization.” However, the next year,
PwC did sign, as by then it had apparently been shown information sufficient to enable it to

understand the control relationships.'*”°

1193. Similarly, as detailed in the next section, PwC occasionally requested additional information

about certain aspects of Yukos’ activities, and was provided each time with sufficient answers

to enable it to certify the financial statements according to U.S. GAAP standards.

(b) PwC Responds to the Massive Tax Reassessments against Yukos

1194. When Mr. Lebedev was arrested in 2003 on tax-related charges, Yukos turned to PwC.

Mr. Michael Kubena, a PwC partner, assured the specially-formed adhoc Yukos Board
committee chaired by Mr. Kosciusko-Morizet that Yukos had always complied with Russian
law, including in the operation of its tax optimization structure, and that PwC did not believe
that there was any possibility that the Russian authorities would attack Yukos on these

p 1521
issues.

1195. In December 2003, after Yukos received the 2000 Audit Report, Yukos again asked PwC for its

wanted to check. And if they agreed on the consolidated perimeter, that was enough for us . . . . The U.S. GAAP
consolidating statements were done according to the rules... . The accounts were approved by an eminent firm.”

comments. In a letter dated 15 January 2004, Mr. Kubena advised that, under the relevant
Russian tax legislation, Yukos was not required to discharge the tax obligations of other

taxpayers, regardless of whether they were affiliated parties."

1196. PwC’s advice to Yukos was to set up a Board committee with independent legal counsel to

1523

carry out an investigation. Mr. Kosciusko-Morizet thus resurrected the special ad hoc Board

committee and Yukos engaged the law firm Akin Gump to examine the tax reassessments.
PwC explained in a letter to Yukos of 29 January 2004 that an independent investigation of the
pending charges and allegations against key Yukos personnel would enable PwC to obtain an
understanding of possible illegal acts for purposes of its own auditing standards.'**
Mr. Kosciusko-Morizet said that “to understand this letter, you have to remember the events . . .
if you know that the problem was political, as everybody did... . The answer is you get cold
feet and you start hedging, and this letter in technical language is about hedging.”'*> PwC’s
persistence about the investigation led Mr. Kosciusko-Morizet to suggest at the time that PwC
was “trying to evade its responsibilities.”'*° At the Hearing, he explained what he meant by

this comment:

You’re an auditor, you're in Russia, you know it’s political; you get cold feet. What do
you do? You don’t want to be involved in the matter, so you find reasons to technically
withdraw from the issue. What happened here is that we made every effort to satisfy the
PwC requirements. The effort continued. Akin Gump was hired. ‘A couple of memos,
interviews and so on. And in the midst of April . . . assets of Yukos . . . were frozen. So
that was that. At that point, any realistic hope of having PwC approving the 2003 GAAP
accounts disappeared, for it was practically impossible. Even though we had satisfied all
their requirements, they would not have approved the accounts because they knew—they
thought, “It’s a political struggle. What about our office?” And they were right, because
two years later they got into a problem that we all know about .... They know it’s
political; they don’t want to be in the middle of the battle, they don’t want to be touched.
So they will keep raising arguments, technical arguments, in order not to be dragged into
the fight.

General of the Russian Federation, that the results of the Yukos/Akin Gump investigation
“were not final for us, they did not help us, i.e. we did not obtain the confirmation or comfort
that would satisfy us as auditors. This was one of the factors which led to our refusal to audit

the company in the future.”"**

1198. The timing of PwC’s April 2004 decision to cease auditing Yukos coincides with the period

when, according to Mr. Rieger, harassment of PwC at the hands of the Russian authorities
commenced. PwC employees involved in Yukos’ Russian accounts were interrogated.'”? In
the spring of 2005, Mr. Miller told Mr. Rieger that he could not even meet with Yukos
employees or management anymore, which Mr. Rieger understood to be a “direct result of the

permanent pressure put by the Russian authorities on PwC.”"**°

(c) PwC Faces Mounting Pressure from the Russian Federation around the Same
Time as Mr. Khodorkovsky’s Second Trial Starts

1199. Pressure on PwC from the Russian authorities was sustained. In March 2006, a court case was

brought against PwC for tax violations relating to expatriate salaries. There was speculation

that the lawsuit was indirectly connected with investigations against Yukos.'**!

1200. In December 2006, a second court case was filed against PwC by the Tax Inspectorate. The

Tax Inspectorate accused PwC of colluding with Yukos on tax evasion. PwC categorically

rejected the claims that the Yukos audit reports were defective in any professional, legal or

1532

regulatory way. While PwC acknowledged that it had raised certain matters with Yukos, it

insisted that these matters did not materially affect the company’s financial statements or alter

PwC’s opinion in respect of the financial statements. '**3

[w]hat is clear is that the firm’s association with Yukos and the fact that the oil company
was paralysed and eventually bankrupted after being slapped with more than US$30 billion
in back-tax claims despite financial reports approved by PwC has made the auditor a clear
target for Russian tax authorities.

1202. PwC published an official statement in which it “strongly object[ed] to the seizure of such

information . . . [and] strongly denie[d] any wrongdoing in either the 2002 tax case or in
relation to its audits,’ and stated that it continued “to work to resolve both matters.”!"*6
Mr. Kubena told the U.S. Embassy that the treatment of PwC employees during the March
2007 raids was “shocking” and a “disgrace.”'**’ Nevertheless, he was reported as saying that
he wished to limit the public profile of the case and urged restraint in discussing it until the
facts were clear. He said that, in the meantime, PwC “better not . . . raise the public profile of

the case in ways that could come back to hurt the prospects for a reasonable solution.”'***

1203. On 20 March 2007, the Moscow Arbitrazh Court found against PwC in the Yukos audit case

Mr. Kubena expressed disappointment about the outcome to the U.S. Embassy, but again urged

restraint when discussing the case in public. PwC was anxious about the renewal of its

 

license. Having met with PwC rep ives, the U.S. Amt dor sought from
Finance Minister Kudrin, who advised the Ambassador that there was no basis for the license to

be revoked.'“” The press still speculated, however, that PwC might risk losing the license.'**

In fact, the license was renewed in April 2007 but PwC continued to fear that it would be
revoked long after.'““* Press reports in April also noted that PwC had started losing clients,

including State-owned companies Transneft and Sakhalin II.'**

1204. While these events were unfolding, in early 2007, prosecutors filed new charges against

Mr. Khodorkovsky, causing PwC to start an internal review. According to the declaration of a
PwC in-house counsel in a separate forum, PwC was at that time already considering and

drafting a possible withdrawal of the audits.'*"°

1205. In April 2007, the Russian tax authorities asked the Finance Ministry to initiate a “review” of

PwC’s auditing practices.'*“” On 18 April 2007, PwC received a summons from prosecutors in
the second Khodorkovsky trial. The prosecutors wanted to interrogate Mr. Miller while
reprimanding PwC for failing to cooperate with earlier requests.'“* On 19 April 2007, PwC
urgently recalled Mr. Miller from his new post in London. They informed him that PwC was
now cooperating with investigators. Mr. Miller was instructed to attend the Prosecutor

General’s Office, where he was interrogated on six occasions in May and June.'*”

During
these sessions he was presented with “new” evidence obtained in connection with the
Khodorkovsky prosecution.'**” Other PwC personnel were also interrogated in the first half of
2007. During his last interrogation session, on 4 June 2007, Mr. Miller told the prosecutor that,
in his opinion, the audit opinions issued in respect of Yukos’ financial statements “starting from

at least 1999 should be withdrawn.” '*°!

investigation has at its disposal data that certain persons at the present time are relying” on

1552

PwC’s audit reports for Yukos. PwC was asked to consider whether its Yukos audit reports

“ought to be relied upon” and whether PwC could confirm the reliability of the financial reports
for 1995-2004 in light of “information, that had earlier been inaccessible to the auditors.”"***

The Tribunal also notes that the following day PwC withdrew its Yukos audit reports.

(d) PwC’s “Volte-Face” in Withdrawing the Yukos Audits; Improved Treatment
and Continued Pressures in the Russian Federation

1207. On 15 June 2007, in a letter from Mr. Kubena to Yukos’ receiver, Mr. Rebgun, PwC withdrew

all of its audit reports for Yukos for the years 1995 to 2004 on the basis of “new information” it
had received that had caused it to lose confidence in Yukos’ management.'*‘ Four categories

of “new” information were highlighted by PwC, concerning:

. control over Behles Petroleum S.A., Baltic Petroleum Trading Limited and South
Petroleum Limited (the “BBS Companies”);

e — Yukos’ control over the trading companies and consequential avoidance of profit
tax;

e  Yukos’ purchases of Bank Menatep’s liabilities; and

* compensation to certain individuals who had led Yukos at the time of its
privatization.'°°*

1208. Senior PwC manager Pete Gerendasi reportedly explained to the U.S. Embassy that the “new”

 

1583

15s

1556

information had been carefully reviewed and deemed credible; that PwC’s U.S. headquarters
had been closely consulted; and that PwC had concluded after a thorough review that, “since
Yukos was no longer a going concern, the only viable option was to withdraw its audits.”'°°°
The Embassy observed that Mr. Gerendasi was uncomfortable discussing the sources of the

“new” information but that he was “unequivocal” that the withdrawal was “a difficult call.”"°*”

As described in the Wikileaks cable, at the time, PwC was still facing: (a) a review by the
Finance Ministry of its auditing practices; (b) an appeal regarding the expatriate tax case; and
(c) an appeal regarding the Yukos collusion case.'** While Mr. Gerendasi noted that PwC’s
legal counsel “was uncertain what effect PwC’s decision to withdraw its Yukos audits would
have on the outcome” of the Yukos collusion case, he stated that “the withdrawal would not

have an adverse effect on the Finance Ministry’s review of PwC’s auditing practices.”'**

1209. PwC made a public announcement of its withdrawal decision on 24 June 2007.'% The

Financial Times reported:

PwC’s sudden about face comes after a government pressure campaign that included police
raids in March on its Moscow office and an ongoing criminal investigation into alleged
underpayment of taxes by Yukos. The audit firm has also risked losing its license . . . .
The move will strengthen the Kremlin’s case against Mikhail Khodorkovsky.'**!

1210. The Tribunal notes that just one day after the public announcement, the criminal charges

against Mr. Kubena and other PwC personnel were dropped.’ In dropping the charges, the
prosecutor noted that “the unjustified nature of the [audit opinions] ... was the result of
misrepresentation by [Yukos’] major shareholders and the persons acting on their

: - ss1563
instructions.”!**

1211. In July 2009, the Financial Times reported that the prosecutors had cleared PwC with respect to

its Yukos audits, having found no wrongdoing by the firm. PwC was “pleased the general

 

prosecutor ha[d] decided not to take any action against PwC Russia, its partners or

employees.”'**

1212. PwC has always denied that there was a tit-for-tat deal whereby the Russian authorities would

Times that “the audit firm’s apparent reversal of fortune had nothing to do with its withdrawal

of the audits . . . and nothing to do with any attempt to reduce the legal pressure.”'° A few
years later, in a 2009 deposition conducted in the U.S. by Mr. Khodorkovsky’s criminal
lawyers, Mr. Miller categorically denied any connection between PwC’s decision to withdraw

its audits and the legal pressure against PwC:

Q. Mr. Miller, how much did the—did the criminal investigation into PwC in 2007 impact
PwC’s decision to withdraw the audits?

THE WITNESS: I believe that the decision to withdraw was based firmly [on] the
information that was shown to us . . . during the investigation.

Q. And is it the same answer as to the tax claims filed against PwC?

A. Yes.

Q. And did you receive any assurances from the investigators, including Mr. Karimov, that
if PwC withdrew the audits, that the criminal investigation against PwC would be
terminated?

A. No.

Q. Have you received any other assurances from the investigators as to treatment of PwC if
you were—if PwC were to withdraw the audit letters?

A. No.

Q. How about any of the investigators from the Russian authorities, did anybody ask you
to develop reasons to withdraw the Yukos audits?

A. No.
Q. Are you aware of anyone from the . . . [Prosecutor General’s Office] asking PwC to
develop reasons to withdraw the audits?

A. No, I’m not aware of that.'°°

1213. At the same time, the Tribunal notes that an October 2007 Wikileaks cable reveals that

1565

1567

1568

Messrs. Kubena and Gerendasi of PwC conveyed to the U.S. Embassy “that the Yukos and
expatriate salary tax cases against the auditor were politically motivated.”'*°’ Mr. Kubena
speculated that the case against PwC for colluding with Yukos might have been “an effort by
the [Government of Russia] to prove ex post facto that its actions against Yukos had a

legitimate basis.”'°°*

Mr. Gerendasi drew a direct connection between the expatriate tax case

against PwC and the prosecution against Yukos’ former management, saying that “tax and law

enforcement authorities may be trying to cast PwC as reckless in an attempt to underscore that

391569

the [Government of Russia] rightfully prosecuted Yukos senior management. Following

this meeting, the Ambassador commented that “PwC is under serious duress in Russia.” 1570

1214. The following month, PwC told the Embassy it was worried that the criminal charges laid in the

context of the expatriate tax case had “devolved into a pressure tactic against the firm.”'°”! As
for the Yukos tax case, which was on appeal, Mr. Gerendasi noted that “[a]lthough the potential
financial penalties in this case were only on the order of USD 500,000 . . . the real threat
remained to the firm’s auditing license.”'*” The Ambassador noted that “Russia matters to
PwC,” and that “[d]espite the rather stark picture Gerendasi painted, he said that PwC remained
bullish on Russia and intended to maintain its operations in-country .... He added that in the
interest of facilitating a resolution to the firm’s short-term difficulties, PwC’s international
leadership would try to meet with senior [Russian governmental] officials in the near

future.”573

1215. Mr. Miller and other PwC employees then cooperated as prosecution witnesses in the second

 

Khodorkovsky trial. The record discloses that they consulted with the prosecutors prior to their
testimony, as demonstrated by an e-mail dated 28 March 2009 from the Prosecutor General’s
Office, in which the prosecutors answered questions posed by Mr. Miller as follows:

2. For every witness,

- The testimony of each witness from among your company’s employees should be unified,

3. Can we obtain a list of approximate expected questions by the Prosecutor for each
witness?

- Carefully analyze your testimony (records of interrogations) and recall our recent
conversation: you will understand the general meaning of such questions. You and I should
phrase specific questions ourselves once you have personally got to the bottom of the

In December 2009, the U.S. Embassy commented on the role that PwC played in the

Khodorkovsky trial and related Yukos lawsuits. It observed as follows:

. if the audits were properly withdrawn, this will be a “black mark” for the
[Yukos/Khodorkovsky] defense: if not, it could help the defense, but would greatly tarnish
PWC’s international reputation . ... [The Khodorkovsky trial is] applying a superficial
rule-of-law gloss to a cynical system where political enemies are eliminated with impunity
. There is a widespread understanding that Khodorkovskiy violated the tacit rules of
the game: if you keep out of politics, you can line your pockets as much as you desire,
Most Russians believe the Khodorkovskiy trial is politically motivated .

 

 

Eventually the two court cases against PwC were resolved in PwC’s favor and PwC’s fines

were refunded.'*”° Meanwhile, Mr. Miller’s evidence, and that of other cooperative PwC

witnesses, was accepted and relied upon by the trial judge who found Mr. Khodorkovsky guilty

at the conclusion of his second criminal trial.'°””

3. Parties’ Arguments and Tribunal’s Observations

The main question the Tribunal will address is whether PwC’s withdrawal of its Yukos audits
was a decision brought about by pressure from the Russian Federation, as Claimants argue, or
whether PwC decided to withdraw the audit opinions out of the genuine concern that they were
tainted by newly-discovered misrepresentations, as Respondent argues. There is a third
possibility as well, namely, that PwC’s withdrawal of its audits was a tactical response to
pressure of the Russian authorities but that nevertheless PwC did have some valid grounds to

believe that Yukos had made important misrepresentations to it.

(a) Did PwC Withdraw its Audits because it was under Pressure from the
Russian Government?

Claimants’ witnesses were unequivocal. In their view, PwC gave in to pressure from the
Russian authorities when it withdrew the audits. Mr. Rieger had noticed that after the attacks
on Yukos began in 2003, “PwC grew much more distant from Yukos . . . . I understood this to

be the direct result of the permanent pressure put by the Russian authorities on Pwo!

- 389 -

Mr. Misamore stated at the Hearing his belief that “PwC withdrew its audit reports as a result of
tremendous pressure from the Russian Government . . . .”'°” Mr. Kosciusko-Morizet agreed.

He testified:

Well, knowing Russia, knowing that this whole Yukos affair is basically political, with a
financial dimension for some people of course, there is a complete logic here in the
harassment that PwC was submitted to from December 2006; the raid on their offices, the
usual methods of armed masked men with machine guns, in March; their denial again of
any wrongdoing in April; and finally this letter, I would not say written but signed by
Doug Miller; and then I believe that all the criminal prosecutions disappeared in a matter of
days .... I saw this letter. I considered that this letter was extorted from them by force. I
know and they know what happened to the Yukos personnel, Vasily Aleksanyan, .
Svetlana Bakhmina and others; there is a long list. And they had to face a decision
between, of course, protecting their business and protecting their people, especially their
Russian personnel, from dire consequences and/or insisting on no wrongdoing; that is,
keeping the ethical line... But PwC, as everybody else, was familiar with the kind of
treatment you could expect if you resist in that context, and they made a decision—I don’t
blame them for that decision—protecting their staff. It’s just unethical but realistic. And
now they have a thriving business in Moscow. '**°

  

1220. Respondent did not deny that the raids, seizures and lawsuits occurred, but explained they were

part of regular law enforcement activities. Respondent pointed out, for example, that many
companies (including Ernst & Young) faced lawsuits about expatriation tax issues. It argued

that auditor collusion lawsuits are standard in other countries.'**!

1221. The record before the Tribunal is abundantly clear. PwC’s treatment improved significantly

once it started to cooperate with the authorities and then withdrew its audits. Almost overnight,
charges were dropped against PwC personnel. PwC’s own legal problems started to be
resolved. At the same time, some cases took longer to resolve, and concerns by PwC over loss
of its license were real. It is clear that cooperation from PwC, once given, was expected to be

enduring. This is easily understood. Mr. Khodorkovsky’s second trial was still ongoing.

1222. Respondent relies heavily on Mr. Miller’s deposition to contradict Claimants’ account of the

1579

1581

events. That deposition was taken under oath in the U.S., at the request of

Mr. Khodorkovsky’s own lawyers, and, according to Respondent, it is “hard to imagine a

clearer or more credible denial of Claimants’ ‘harassment’ theory.”!***

1223. Although Mr. Miller was not offered as a witness, the Tribunal does not accept his denial in

another forum of any link between PwC’s decision to withdraw the audits and the pressure
against PwC mounted by the Russian authorities. Mr. Miller was then subjected to six sessions

of interrogation. When he was recalled from London hi:

 

superiors instructed him to cooperate
with the Russian authorities. The March 2009 e-mail exchange with the prosecutor’s office,
suggests that he was prepared to cooperate when he testified in Mr. Khodorkovsky’s second
trial. Moreover, the candid views expressed by PwC officials in the U.S. Embassy’s cables
published by Wikileaks confirm that PwC was under pressure. The cables demonstrate that
PwC was concerned not to aggravate its difficulties with the Government (“better not raise the

public profile of the case in ways that could come back to hurt the prospects for a reasonable

1584 1585

solution”); that PwC was anxious not to lose its license or its business in Russia; that it

considered the Yukos cases to be politically motivated and saw some connections between the

1586

withdrawal of the audit opinions and PwC’s treatment by the Russia Government; and that it

felt that criminal charges in the expatriate tax case were being used as a “pressure tactic.”!**”
The Embassy considered PwC to be under duress and concluded that “the political and legal
concerns that are driving the heightened scrutiny of PWC’s accounting practices appear to have

taken on a life of their own.”!***

(b) Were the Grounds Provided by PwC in its Withdrawal Letter Contrived or
Credible?

1224. As noted earlier, Claimants assert that PwC played a role in establishing and auditing Yukos’

information it required.'**”

1225. Respondent on the other hand points to “a long and troubled relationship” between Yukos and

PwC, recalling that PwC had refused to continue to audit the company’s U.S. GAAP statements
after 2003.'° Respondent asserts that in 2007 PwC withdrew its opinions in good faith, upon
learning “new information” via Mr. Miller’s interrogations in May and June 2007.'°!
Respondent emphasizes “that the Tribunal is not a trier of fact as to the reliability of the
information learned by PwC. In order to rebut Claimants’ unsupported harassment theory, it is
sufficient that PwC had a good-faith belief in the credibility of that information. . . 2”
According to Respondent, it is for Claimants to prove that Yukos never lied to PwC and that
PwC’s four reasons for withdrawal of the audits were a mere pretext. Although the Tribunal
agrees with Respondent that it is not a trier of facts as to the soundness of this “new

information,” it finds it appropriate to examine those four reasons.

i. Did Yukos’ Management Lie to PwC about the BBS Companies
Being “Related”?

1226. The first category of alleged misinformation identified in PwC’s Withdrawal Letter was the

following:

Whilst we were auditing the Company, its management many times declared to us that the
Company and companies to which substantial volumes of crude oil and oil products were
exported, namely Behles Petroleum S.A., Baltic Petroleum Trading Limited and South
Petroleum Limited (hereinafter together referred to as “BBS”), were not affiliated parties.
In the course of the Investigation, we were provided with information showing that BBS
had been controlled by the shareholders of Group Menatep Limited (hereinafter “Group
Menatep”) and had been used to their advantage. At the material time, Group Menatep
held a controlling block of shares in the Company.'**

1227. It appears as if Yukos’ management had repeatedly assured PwC that Yukos was not “related”

to the BBS Companies (in the sense of sharing the same beneficial owners within the meaning

At the Hearing, Mr. Misamore stated that he did not “agree that anything was misrepresented to PwC.” In his view,
“PwC had access to all the information they wanted; and if they didn’t have sufficient information, they should have
asked for more.” Transcript, Day 9 at 249. Mr. Theede also testified that up until the Russian Federation’s attack on
PwC began, “there was never any indication of any concerns or problems or anything to me.” Transcript, Day 11 at

of GAAP standards).'°** PwC had looked at the issue itself and expressed doubts, but concluded
that even if they were related, the transactions with the BBS Companies were done under fair
market conditions, and were so immaterial that they could have no impact on the financial
statements and thus did not need to be disclosed.'*?> Then, in 2007, while being interrogated,
Mr. Miller found out “new information,” in the form of the record of an interrogation of a
Mr. Anilionis, who described how the BBS Companies were set up in a structure that would
enable Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev to “keep [them] under control but on the surface
the structure should not belong to ‘Yukos.””"* A trade office was set up in Geneva, prices
were coordinated with Mr. Lebedev, and Yukos’ employees were responsible for oil trading
activities. The discovery of this “lie”, even though relating to an immaterial matter from a
financial reporting standpoint, is said to have shattered PwC’s confidence in the statements of
Yukos’ management and thus caused PwC to withdraw its audit opinions.'*” Claimants say it
is simply not credible for PwC to have invoked the BBS Companies issue as an excuse to

1598

withdraw its audit opinions. They also question the reliability of the source of “new

information,” the interrogation of Mr. Anilionis.'°

1228. When Mr. Kosciusko-Morizet was shown documents indicating that PwC had raised concerns

in the past about Yukos’ relationship with the BBS Companies, he emphasized that PwC had
approved Yukos’ G.A.A.P. accounts and thus “ any problem they might have had was
solved.”'% Mr. Misamore also confirmed the view that the BBS Companies were not related
parties vis-a-vis Yukos, that the issue had been on PwC’s radar, and that PwC could have

caused Yukos to identify the BBS Companies as related if it were essential, but did not.'°"

1229. Mr. Misamore denied that PwC had repeatedly recommended that Yukos disclose the

1594

1597

1601

ownership structure of the BBS Companies and that Yukos had refused such disclosure. He

conclusion as to whether or not [information about Yukos’ relationship with the BBS
Companies] should be disclosed.”'“* Further, he noted that PwC signed Yukos’ audited
financial statements without that information. Upon being shown an internal PwC document,
“Matters for Partner Attention”, for year 2000, wherein PwC stated that “[t]he absence of
disclosure, while not desirable, does not constitute a material omission,” Mr. Misamore said
that this document too supports his view that disclosure was not so desirable as to warrant PwC

insisting on its inclusion in Yukos’ F-1 document.'**

1230. Nevertheless, the Tribunal is unconvinced by the claims that the BBS Companies, apparently

the, or certainly, a, principal exporter of the oil produced by Yukos, were not controlled by or

related to Yukos. PwC’s contention that it was misled in this regard may have been true.

ii, Did Yukos Management Lie to PwC about Yukos’ Control over
the Trading Companies?

1231. The second category of alleged misinformation identified in PwC’s Withdrawal Letter was the

following:

Now we have information demonstrating that the management of certain Russian legal
entities affiliated with the Company did not control the activities of these entities, rather
these legal entities were fully controlled directly by the Company’s management. Since
the management of these affiliated entities were not in control of these entities’ activities,
the court found that these activities were fictitious. Consecutively, the courts found that
the profit earned by these legal entities affiliated with the Company was a profit of the
Company, and therefore the Company should have accrued and paid taxes on this profit.
Nevertheless, in the course of the audits, the Company’s management told us that key
issues of the activities of these affiliated legal entities were under supervision and control
of their own management."

1232. This is an issue that was traversed at length in Chapters VIII.A and B of the present Award.

1233. Claimants argued that PwC was fully aware of the structures of the trading companies, and that

1602

in the context of the preparation of Yukos’ U.S. GAAP financial statements, PwC had given

specific and detailed advice to Yukos on how to demonstrate control over affiliated companies

so that they could be included within the consolidation umbrella.'°”

Respondent accuses
Claimants of conflating concepts of accounting (control relationships amongst various Yukos
entities for consolidation purposes under the U.S. GAAP), which PwC did understand, with
questions of tax (how much actual control Yukos exerted at an operational level over the
trading shells from Moscow while maintaining the fiction of management in the low-tax region
to avoid tax under Russian tax law), which PwC certainly did not appreciate, because it never
audited the trading companies.'®” Respondent does not actually refer to any “new” information
PwC learned which would have caused them concern about this in June 2007; it simply points
to a series of negatives (PwC did not design the trading company scheme, PwC did not audit

the trading companies).

1234. At the hearing, Respondent referred to the August 2007 interrogation of Mr. Kubena’s

predecessor as PwC tax advisor in Russia, Mr. Klubnichkin, to show PwC never audited the

trading companies.'°*

While PwC was fully aware of Yukos’ use of the tax optimization
scheme, Mr. Klubnichkin said, it was not aware of any abusive elements. Mr. Klubnichkin said
that as Yukos’ auditor, PwC had “never been aware of the fictitious nature of these
‘operational’ companies .. . . The deceit lies in the fact that a corporation creates false
appearance of normal activity, of a serious business, with respect to a fictitious business . . . .
We could only learn about such nature of these companies in case of a full audit of these
companies themselves, which would include our visits to their operational premises." The
Tribunal notes that Mr. Klubnichkin’s interrogation took place in August 2007, afier the PwC

withdrawal.

1235. Respondent submits that PwC did not know about the Lesnoy assessments. Respondent thus

disputes that PwC was ever aware that the trading companies were sham entities directly
controlled by Yukos from Moscow, and disputes that Yukos’ tax scheme was adopted on

PwC’s advice or recommendation.'*”

1236. Claimants’ response is two-fold. Firstly, they refer to oral and documentary evidence in the

record confirming PwC’s participation in the Yukos tax scheme in the regions.'°'"

They point
to a contemporaneous internal memo from PwC Cyprus to PwC Moscow, which discloses that
PwC was familiar with the details of the group structure and the relationships of the trading
companies.'°” In addition, Claimants underline the closeness of Yukos’ relationship with PwC
as shown by PwC’s attendance at an “international symposium” held by Yukos in early 2002, at
which tax issues, group structure, international accounting standards and related party

disclosure requirements were discussed.'°"*

1237. Finally, Claimants point to a timing problem that in their view undermines the credibility of

PwC’s statement that it obtained “new information” only in May 2007. The Tribunal finds
much force in Claimants’ submission that PwC was on notice of the Russian Federation’s
alleged concerns about Yukos’ tax optimization structure at least as early as January 2004,
when it issued its opinion on the 2000 Audit Report. As Yukos’ auditor since 1997, PwC
obviously had a strong incentive in ensuring that its previous audit reports were accurate, and if
there was anything new or worrying in what it had seen, it would have raised it at the time.
PwC did not withdraw the audits in 2004, 2005, or 2006 when the issues were being aired
through the Russian courts and in the public domain. Rather it waited three and a half years,
and then suddenly decided that there was “new information” on the basis of which the audits

should be withdrawn.

iii, Did Yukos’ Management Lie to PwC about Transactions with
Bank Menatep?

1238. The third category of alleged misinformation identified in PwC’s Withdrawal Letter was the

owned and controlled by Group Menatep before AKB Menatep Bank. Complete
information about the nature of these transactions and relations was not disclosed to us in
the course of the audits.'°"*

1239. This “new information” concerned transactions going back to the late 1990s, when Yukos

purchased what Respondent calls “worthless claims” against Bank Menatep, which was in
bankruptcy at the time.'*'° The principal shareholders of Bank Menatep were the same as the
principal shareholders of Yukos. PwC was concerned that the purchase of claims against a
bankrupt bank was undertaken to further the interests of the companies’ common shareholders,
using Yukos’ funds and at the expense of Yukos’ minority shareholders. By May 2000, Yukos
had accumulated USD 500 million in claims against Bank Menatep, but had at most

USD 220 million in guarantees.

1240. During one of the 2007 interrogations, Mr. Miller was shown minutes of a May 2000 meeting,

in which Yukos’ managers stated that “it would be not be desirable to disclose this information
since those shares were bought out from the borrowers.”!°'® The minutes then state that “[iJt is
necessary to immediately demonstrate to the Company’s auditors the intention to sell the excess
of the purchased assets—with a book profit—to unrelated third parties. . . .” Although
Mr. Miller could not in fact remember if he worked on this issue or if the information was
disclosed to PwC, he was outraged what he described as the “unacceptable manipulation of
information” revealed by the minutes and by Yukos’ plan to lie to the auditors about its

worthless claims against Bank Menatep.'°"”

1241. Claimants assert that PwC was always fully aware of the substance of the transactions

iv. Did Yukos’ Management Lie to PwC about its Compensation
Payments to Certain VPL Managers?

1242. The fourth category of alleged misinformation identified in PwC’s Withdrawal Letter was the

following:

The Company failed to timely disclose to us information about certain payments made by
the shareholders of Group Menatep in favor of certain individuals, who were leading
executives of the Company at the time of its privatization. In the course of the
Investigation, some information disclosed to us ran counter to the explanations given to us
by the management and shareholders of the Company in the course of our audits with
regard to the exact nature of those payments.'"”

1243. This allegation concerned the extraordinarily generous compensation plan that had been put in

place for certain persons who had been managers of Yukos at the time of its privatization. PwC
suspected that the immense sums paid to those persons could not have been for services
rendered to Yukos itself. Respondent alleges that Yukos had misrepresented to PwC the
purpose of the compensation plan. PwC’s long-held suspicion about the nature of the payments
was only confirmed when the Prosecutor General showed Mr. Miller statements signed by the
beneficiaries of the payments to the effect that they had been made to them “not for services
provided to Yukos but were . . . connected to Group Menatep’s acquisition of Yukos.”'”°
Mr. Miller expressed “indignation” at the “lie” and alleged that Mr. Khodorkovsky had told
him he would go to jail if forced to disclose the real reason for the payments.’ This category
of so-called “lies” was seen as important to PwC not in terms of material effect on the audited

reports, but insofar as they undermined the credibility of Yukos’ management’s statements.'°

1244. Claimants affirm that Mr. Miller had always been familiar with the payment arrangements.

1619

1620

1621

1622

1623

How the payments are identified in the accounts is only an accounting issue (as opined by
Clifford Chance and Cleary Gottlieb at the time).'° When PwC signed off on the Yukos

financial statements, they were aware of the issue. Even Mr. Miller acknowledged that the

“reliability of the financial statements is not affected.”"* Claimants were prepared to disclose

the existence and purpose of the compensation fund to the public for the ADR listing.

(c) Concluding Observations

1245. The Tribunal observes that there are some notable timing problems concerning the date of

PwC’s withdrawal following the revelation of “new” information. For example, the fact that
PwC did not audit the trading shells would have been known to Mr. Miller before June 2007.
PwC would have known about alleged “sham” or “abusive” elements of the Yukos tax
optimization scheme at least as early as January 2004 when it was shown the 2000 Audit
Report. It is not understandable that PwC would wait until June 2007 before determining that
its audits were unreliable. Respondent itself notes that “[a] question can be raised as to whether

PwC waited too long to withdraw its audit opinions.”!”°

1246. In addition, PwC said that its withdrawal letter was drafted on the basis of “new” information

that Mr. Miller learned in the course of his interrogations in May 2007. However, it appears

that a draft withdrawal letter was prepared as early as March of that year.'”

1247. PwC was clearly pressed by the Russian authorities to find grounds for withdrawing its audits

of Yukos. Bearing in mind the complexity of the Yukos structure, the business environment at
the time it was set up, and the grey areas of Russian tax law at the time, it is not surprising that
PwC could identify elements of evidence with respect to some aspects of Yukos’ business
practice that it affirms gave rise to credibility issues. As far as the Tribunal can judge, Yukos
may not have been candid in its representations to PwC about control of the BBS Companies
and about the reasons for the immense payments Yukos undertook to make, and did make, to

individuals who were involved in its privatization.

1248. However, the Tribunal cannot accept that the four issues identified in PwC’s Withdrawal Letter

1624

1625

1626

1627

were in fact “new” for PwC. In addition, even if the information was new, it was not

unequivocal, and could have been tested with Yukos when it was still operational. In this

regard, the Tribunal notes that PwC did not give former Yukos senior officials an opportunity
to comment on the new information before signing the withdrawal letter. At the Hearing,
Mr. Misamore testified that he stood by the following statement he made in 2009 in relation to

the PwC withdrawal:

PWC never said anything to me or, as far as I know, anyone else at Yukos, to my
knowledge, about a lack of information or the refusal to provide information, other than the
instance concerning the ownership interests in [the] BBS [Companies]. If PWC had asked
me to intervene—and I did intervene with the BBS inquiry—I would have gone to Group
Menatep shareholders or their lawyers, and would have urged the release of the requested
information.'°**

1249. According to Respondent’s accounting expert, Mr. Ellison, who was not cross-examined, the

1250. Similar steps are expected to be taken under international and Russian auditing standards.

U.S. Statement of Auditing Standards No. | sets the following standard for the “Subsequent
Discovery of Facts Existing at the Date of the Auditor’s Report”:

When the auditor becomes aware of information which relates to financial statements
previously reported on by him, but which was not known to him at the date of his report,
and which is of such a nature and from such a source that he would have investigated it had
it come to his attention during the course of his audit, he should, as soon as practicable,
undertake to determine whether the information is reliable and whether the facts existed at
the date of his report. In this connection, the auditor should discuss the matter with his
client_at_whatever levels he deems appropriate, including the board of
directors, and request cooperation in whatever investigation may be necessary.'*

[emphasis added]

1630

Mr. Ellison notes that PwC’s Withdrawal Letter stated that “due to the company undergoing
bankruptcy and the former company executives no longer working for the company, PwC was
unable to access the information required that could lead to revision of the financial statements
and was also unable to discuss the matter with management, as recommended by [the audit
standards].” Mr. Ellison concludes that under those circumstances “PwC had no option but to

withdraw its audit reports."

1251. Mr. Ellison observes that when a reputable international firm withdraws an audit opinion it is

1628

1629

1630

1631

1632

1632

an “unusual and serious” event. In light of the seriousness of the decision to withdraw the

Standards ISA 560 and Russian Federal Auditing Rule No. 10. Ellison Report {f[ 3.5.5, 3.5.11, 3.6.1.

audit opinions, and the industry standard of consulting with the audited company before taking
any action, it is noteworthy that PwC made no effort to reach out to Yukos’ management or ex-

management to discuss the “new” information.

1252. PwC’s senior executives confided to the U.S. Embassy that the withdrawal decision was a

“difficult” call." At stake for PwC on the one hand was its reputation and loyalty to a “dead”
client, and on the other hand its continued viability in the Russian market. As the cables reveal,
Russia mattered to PwC.“ PwC’s senior executives met with the Russian Government to
resolve PwC’s problems. And, as noted earlier, after PwC made its decision, criminal charges
were dropped, and PwC prevailed in two lawsuits, received a refund of its fines, maintained its
license and retained important Russian clients such as Gazprom. As observed by Mr.
Kosciusko-Morizet, “PwC undoubtedly opted in the end for the most pragmatic approach so as

to maintain its office in Russia and protect its employees from being sued.”"**

1253. As the Tribunal stated at the outset of this chapter, PwC is not on trial before this Tribunal,

which draws no conclusion in the present Award about PwC’s professional conduct. However,
the pressure mounted by the Russian authorities against Yukos’ auditors, which led to PwC’s
eventual withdrawal of its audits and even to a PwC auditor testifying against
Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev at their second trial, informs the Tribunal’s view that
Yukos was the object of a series of politically-motivated attacks by the Russian authorities that

eventually led to its destruction, as alleged by Claimants.

PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS

1256. Article 26(3)(b)(i) of the ECT contains the ECT’s “fork-in-the-road” provision. It must be read

together with the preceding paragraphs of Article 26:

Article 26

SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES BETWEEN AN INVESTOR AND A CONTRACTING PARTY

(1) Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party
relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the former, which concern an
alleged breach of an obligation of the former under Part III shall, if possible, be
settled amicably.

(2) If such disputes can not be settled according to the provisions of paragraph (1)
within a period of three months from the date on which either party to the dispute
requested amicable settlement, the Investor party to the dispute may choose to
submit it for resolution:

(a)
(b)

(©)
B) @

(by)

(ii)

1257. Before turning to the Parties’ submissions, the Tribunal recalls its dismissal in the Interim

Awards of Respondent’s identical Article 26(3)(b)(i) objection to jurisdiction and/or

admissibility:

to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party party to the
dispute;

in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute settlement
procedure; or

in accordance with the following paragraphs of this Article.
Subject only to subparagraphs (b) and (c), each Contracting Party hereby

gives its unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international
arbitration or conciliation in accordance with the provisions of this Article.

  

The Contracting Parties listed in Annex ID do not give such unconditional
consent where the Investor has previously submitted the dispute under
subparagraph (2)(a) or (b);

For the sake of transparency, each Contracting Party that is listed in
Annex ID shall provide a written statement of its policies, practices and
conditions in this regard to the Secretariat no later than the date of the
deposit of its instrument of ratification, acceptance or approval in accordance
with Article 39 or the deposit of its instrument of accession in accordance
with Article 41.

Lo]

The Tribunal finds that Respondent’s arguments are unconvincing. Indeed, in its written
submissions, Respondent did appear to concede that, as a general matter, there is ample

= 402 -

authority for the application of a “triple identity” test [identity of parties, cause of action
and object of the dispute] in the context of a “fork-in-the-road” provision. To that extent,
there is no question that the various Russian court proceedings and applications to the
European Court of Human Rights cited by Respondent fail to trigger the “fork-in-the-road
provision” of the ECT.'

2. Parties’ Positions

1258. In its Counter-Memorial, Respondent renews its objection that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction

pursuant to Article 26(3)(b)(i) of the ECT. In its view, developments subsequent to the Interim
Awards show that Claimants, as Yukos shareholders, are seeking before the ECtHR damages
for the same alleged loss arising from Yukos’ demise. Accordingly, Respondent submits that

the ECT arbitrations expose it to double recovery.’

1259. Respondent relies on the Application for Just Satisfaction made by Yukos’ former

representative, Mr. Gardner, before the ECtHR, requesting damages “and, for the first time ...
compensation for the ‘ultimate stakeholders’ in Yukos through a Stichting created under Dutch
law.”'* Respondent argues that these circumstances deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction under

Articles 26(3)(b)(i) and 26(2)(b), and Annex ID of the EcT.'°?

1260. Respondent submits that the European Convention on Human Rights (“ECHR”) and ECT

claims share the same fundamental basis, and, accordingly, the ECT claims should be
dismissed. As previously submitted in its First Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility,
Respondent emphasizes that its consent to submit a dispute to international arbitration is
expressly conditioned on Claimants not having already submitted the dispute to a “previously
agreed dispute resolution procedure,” pursuant to Article 26(3)(b)(i) read in conjunction with

Article 26(2)(a) and Annex ID of the ECT.'*”

1261. Respondent argues that the Tribunal’s dismissal of this objection was premised on the

“incorrect assumption” that the parties in the proceedings before the ECtHR and the present

Counter-Memorial § 828. Annex ID lists the Contracting Parties that have conditioned their consent to the submission

the dispute to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party to the dispute. The Russian Federation is
listed in Annex ID. (Interim Awards §§ 588-89 (YUL); | 599-600 (VPL); {587-88 (Hulley).

proceedings are different.'“’ Respondent further submits that the Tribunal erred in “fail[ing] to
mention the requirements of the ‘triple identity test’ and state which requirement was not

fulfilled.”'“? In satisfaction of the identity threshold, Respondent submits as follows:

. the Application for Just Satisfaction before the ECtHR establishes that the

ultimate stakeholders’, including Claimants, are the only Yukos interests that are

represented in the EC[t]HR proceedings”;'°

. the monetary relief requested in both proceedings for Yukos’ alleged expropriation

is identical;!*+ and

. the ECHR and ECT claims both aim to obtain compensation for the purported
expropriation of Yukos and “have the same normative source,” as Article 13(1) of
the ECT and Article | of Protocol No. 1 ECHR do not lay down independent

standards by which Respondent’s conduct is to be judged.’

1262. Claimants maintain their rejection of this objection, emphasizing in their Reply that “it is
entirely inappropriate and an abuse of process for the Respondent now to seek to reopen this
issue.”!*°

1263. Firstly, Claimants emphasize that the merits phase of these arbitrations is not an instance of
appeal and, further, that the principles of res judicata and ne bis in idem are absolute bars to
Respondent renewing this objection.'”

1264. Secondly, Claimants submit that Respondent’s contention that the parties in the ECtHR
proceedings and these arbitrations are the same is incorrect. Mr. Gardner'“* does not act on
behalf of Claimants, nor did Claimants make any submissions in those proceedings. Contrary
to Respondent’s characterization, Mr. Gardner was not seeking compensation “on behalf of

Claimants.” Rather, Claimants say Mr. Gardner he was simply arguing that the destruction of

the Company need not pose an obstacle to an award of just satisfaction, “because the Dutch
Foundation was able to receive such an award and dispose of it in accordance with its
statutes.”'“” Claimants also highlight that Mr. Gardner’s submission is dated 4 May 2009, thus

preceding the Interim Awards in these arbitrations by several months.

1265. Thirdly, Claimants submit that Respondent advanced essentially the same argument previously

before the ECtHR. Claimants submit that Respondent’s position in that regard was rejected by
the ECtHR because the parties in the ECT arbitrations were different, and thus the matters were

not substantially the same.'°?

1266. Finally, Claimants submit that no issue of double recovery arises in these arbitrations. They

repeat the disclaimer they provided to the Tribunal on | April 2010, that “should any pecuniary
damages be awarded to Yukos in the ECtHR proceedings, and should the Claimants receive
any payments, such payments would be deducted from the amounts claimed in these

arbitrations.”!*!

1267. In its Rejoinder, Respondent draws the Tribunal’s attention to the 2012 decision in Chevron v.

1652

Ecuador,” which, according to Respondent, confirms “‘a narrow interpretation of ‘fork-in-the-

road’ provisions that focuses strictly on the legal bases of the claims would deprive such a

. 991653
clause of effective scope.”"®

1268. Respondent also objects to Claimants’ res judicata argument. Respondent submits that the

ECtHR proceedings, which were “formally instituted by Yukos, under Claimants’ direction and
control” and involve “the very same economic interests that are represented in these
arbitrations, constitute a special circumstance that justifies a new examination of Respondent’s

Article 26(3)(b)(i) ECT objection.”

1269. Respondent also alleges that Claimants admit there is privity of interest between the two

3. Tribunal’s Decision

1271. Having considered the Parties’ submissions and reviewed the reasons for its dismissal in the
Interim Awards of Respondent’s identical objection to jurisdiction pursuant to Article

26(3)(b)(i) of the ECT, the Tribunal sees no reason to reopen this issue and change its decision.

1272. Accordingly, Respondent’s objection that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction pursuant to
Article 26(3)(b)(i) of the ECT is dismissed.

B. “UNCLEAN HANDS” (DID CLAIMANTS ACT ILLEGALLY SO AS TO DEPRIVE THEM OF
PROTECTION UNDER THE ECT?)

1. Introduction

1273. As its second preliminary objection, Respondent submits that Claimants have come to this
Tribunal with “unclean hands,” with one or many of the following consequences: (a) the
Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over Claimants’ claims; (b) Claimants’ claims are
inadmissible; and/or (c) Claimants should be deprived of the substantive protections of the

ECT. The Tribunal addresses this argument in the present chapter.

1274. Should the Tribunal reject the “unclean hands” argument as a preliminary objection,

1655 Thid. 4369.
1656 Thid. 4] 99-193.
1657 Tid. 4374.

= 406 -

Respondent also submits that some instances of Claimants’ unclean hands should be treated as
contributory fault and/or a failure to mitigate on the part of Claimants, and that any damages
awarded to Claimants should be discounted on the basis of their unclean hands. These

arguments are addressed in Chapters X.E and XILC.

1275. Respondent initially made its “unclean hands” argument in the jurisdictional phase of these

arbitrations. In Paragraph 3 of its Procedural Order No. 3 dated 31 October 2006, the Tribunal
decided that it would be “appropriate to defer consideration of the Parties’ contentions
concerning ‘unclean hands’ [and] Respondent’s ‘criminal enterprise’ contention . . . to the

merits phase, if any.”

1276. In its Interim Awards, the Tribunal stated:

The Tribunal is well aware of Respondent’s argument that Claimant in this arbitration has
“unclean hands” and that Claimant’ s corporate personality should be disregarded because it
is an instrumentality of a “criminal enterprise.” The Tribunal recalls that it addressed these
issues in its Procedural Orders Nos. 2 and 3 on 8 September and 31 October 2006.
Specifically, the Tribunal then decided to defer consideration of Respondent’s arguments
concerning the “unclean hands” of Claimant or Claimant being an instrumentality of a
“criminal enterprise” to any merits phase of this arbitration. Accordingly, by finding, as it
does, that Claimant qualifies as an Investor owning and controlling an Investment for the
purposes of Articles 1(7) and (6) of the ECT, the Tribunal does not dispose of the issues
argued by Respondent concerning the “unclean hands” of Claimant and Claimant being an
instrumentality of a “criminal enterprise,” which it will address during any merits phase of
this arbitration.'°**

1277. As anticipated in the Interim Awards, now with the benefit of a full presentation of the facts by

the Parties on all aspects of the Yukos affair, the Tribunal addresses Respondent’s “unclean

hands” argument in this final Award.

1278. The Tribunal notes that, in their First Submission on Costs, Claimants argue that Respondent,

1658

1659)

after insisting on its “unclean hands” allegations and the assertion that Claimants are an
instrumentality of a “criminal enterprise” in the jurisdictional phase of this arbitration and
dedicating nearly two hundred pages of its Counter-Memorial and Rejoinder to the first of these
two arguments, ultimately abandoned these arguments at the Hearing, pursuing only the
allegations related to alleged abuse by Claimants of the Cyprus-Russia DTA.'°* In its Reply
Submission on Costs, Respondent confirmed that it had not abandoned its unclean hands

defense. To the contrary, Respondent argued that Claimants had explicitly refused to join issue

Interim Awards § 435 (Hulley); 4 436; (YUL); 4 492 (VPL).
Exh. C-916

- 407 -

and submit rebuttal and Respondent had dingly relied on its arguments as and

accepted. According to Respondent, this alleviated the need to devote substantial hearing time

to these points.’

1279. Claimants correctly observe that at the merits hearing (and in their Post-Hearing Brief)

Respondent expanded only on the Cyprus-Russia DTA abuses part of its “unclean hands”
argument, making only passing reference to other aspects of this argument.'°' However, in the
Tribunal’s view, this circumstance speaks only to Respondent’s freedom to present its case as it
chooses, and represents Respondent’s strategic decision to focus on certain arguments instead
of others in the limited time available to it at the Hearing and within the page limit for post-
hearing submissions imposed by the Tribunal. The fact that Respondent did not repeat in full
all of the arguments made in previous pleadings at the Hearing and in its Post-Hearing Brief

does not mean that these arguments were abandoned.

1280. Below, the Tribunal first summarizes the factual allegations constituting the foundation of

Respondent’s “unclean hands” argument and then the Parties’ arguments regarding the impact
of the alleged facts on the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, the admissibility of claims and the
availability of the substantive protections of the ECT to Claimants. In the last section of this
chapter, the Tribunal sets out its decision with respect to “unclean hands” as a preliminary

objection.

2. Claimants’ Alleged “Unclean Hands”

1281. Respondent lists 28 instances of alleged “illegal and bad faith conduct” by Claimants or

“attributable to” Claimants involving a variety of actors and spanning over ten years, from the
privatization of Yukos in the mid-1990s to its liquidation in November 2007. Claimants
dispute that any of their conduct (or any conduct attributable to them) was illegal or in bad

faith.

1282. Given the number and diversity of Respondent’s allegations, the Tribunal presents them below

1660

1661

in groups intended to facilitate its subsequent analysis. Where facts related to Respondent’s
“unclean hands” allegations fall outside the scope of the analysis of the factual background set

out in Part VIII above, they are briefly summarized here.

(a) Conduct Related to the Acquisition of Yukos and the Subsequent
Consolidation of Control over Yukos and its Subsidiaries

1283. The first eleven items of Respondent's list of “illegal and bad faith conduct” are dedicated to

conduct related to the acquisition of Yukos by Bank Menatep; and the so-called “Oligarchs”

and their subsequent consolidation of control and ownership over Yukos and its subsidiaries:

i. Violating the legal requirements governing the loans-for-shares program that
allowed Menatep to gain its controlling interest in Yukos.

ii, Using shell company proxies to feign competition in the loans-for-shares auction
and a simultaneous investment tender for Yukos shares.

 

Precluding actual competitors from bidding on Yukos shares in the loans-for-shares
auction and investment tender, including through the abuse of Menatep’s role as
auction organizer to disqualify Russian competitors.

iv. Rigging a subsequent auction for the Yukos shares that were being held as collateral
following the initial loans-for-shares auction, which deprived the Russian
Government of substantial revenue.

v.  Conspiring with Yukos’ pre-existing managers to facilitate the unlawful acquisition
of Yukos by the Oligarchs, including by entering into an agreement whereby “Yukos
Universal” committed to pay them compensation consisting of 15% of Menatep’s
beneficial interest in Yukos, ultimately worth billions of dollars, for “services
rendered to ‘Yukos””.

vi. Colluding with others to predetermine the post-privatization ownership of Yukos.

vii. Skimming profits from Yukos and its production subsidiaries for their own self-
enrichment.

viii. Abusing Russian corporate law and principles of corporate governance by squeezing
out minority shareholders in Yukos’ production subsidiaries through ruthless and
self-enriching share dilutions, asset stripping, and transfer pricing.

ix. Siphoning off huge sums for the benefit of the Oligarchs from Yukos’ proceeds from
the sale of oil and oil products, while concealing related-party transactions from
Yukos’ own auditor.

x. Further mistreatment of minority shareholders by manipulating shareholder
meetings, pressuring the Russian Federal Securities Commission not to pursue its
challenges against illegal misconduct, relying on fraudulently determined stock and
asset values and deceiving those minority shareholders, the government, and
domestic and foreign courts about the nature and control of offshore companies that
were created to benefit Claimants and their cohorts.

= 409 -

xi. Manipulating Yukos’ stock value to devalue and reacquire the interests of creditors
to which Yukos stock had been pledged.'°?

1284. As context to Respondent’s allegations, it is useful to recall some of Yukos’ early history. The

Russian Federation created the company in 1993 as part of a large-scale reorganization of the
Soviet oil production and processing industry into vertically integrated oil companies. Yukos

remained largely state-run until 1995.'°

1285. Respondent recounts, based on a report by Professor Reinier Kraakman that, in March 1995, a

consortium of Russian commercial banks, including Bank Menatep (the Chairman of which
was Mr. Khodorkovsky), proposed to the Russian government that they would lend it money in
exchange for the right to hold as collateral and manage shares of major state-owned companies
such as Yukos.'* A presidential decree of August 1995 provided for the auctioning of the
right to hold and manage shares of individual companies.'* Once the terms of the proposed
management agreement expired, the government would have a choice between paying back the
loan and reclaiming its shares, and allowing the lender to sell the shares, with the government
keeping 70 percent of the difference between the sale price and the original amount of the

loan.'°°° This mechanism became known as the “loans-for-shares program.”

1286. In December 1995, the Russian Government retained Bank Menatep to organize the auction for

the shares in Yukos.'°°”

1287. Respondent alleges that Bank Menatep “completely rigged the auction” by preventing potential

competitors from participating, while using two front companies, Laguna and Regent, to
formally comply with the requirements for bids.'“* Respondent recounts that Laguna won the
right to hold as collateral and manage a 45 percent stake in Yukos for a USD 159 million loan
to the Russian government and an additional investment obligation of USD 200 million.
According to Respondent, Laguna acquired an additional 33 percent stake in Yukos by

pledging just over USD 150 million in investments at a simultaneously held “investment

Respondent also suggests that Bank Menatep was “an insider among

1288. Respondent makes additional allegations regarding Bank Menatep’s and the Oligarchs’

treatment of foreign and Russian investors holding minority shares in Yukos’ main production

subsidiaries—YNG, Samaraneftegaz and Tomskneft—in the aftermath of the privatization.

1673

Respondent alleges that from 1996 to 1999 Bank Menatep and the Oligarchs engaged in

significant profit skimming and, in 1999 and 2000, abused Russian corporate law and principles

of corporate governance to “squeeze out the minority shareholders through massive share

dilutions, transfer pricing, and asset stripping,

preclude foreign companies and individuals from bidding and to disallow bids.'®* Claimants

add that Respondent’s “vague insinuations” as to the source of funds used to privatize Yukos

do not prove that anything unlawful took place.

Claimants suggest that Respondent’s

argument “amounts to nothing more than an attempt to shift blame for the actions of the

Russian Government itself onto Bank Menatep.”!*°

1290. As regards the manner of the consolidation of Bank Menatep’s ownership over Yukos,

Claimants reply that Respondent’s allegations are vague and “not only irrelevant, but also
moot.”'*! Claimants point out that Respondent relies on share issuances and transfers that

were ultimately cancelled and on an alleged dispute with a minority shareholder that was

eventually settled.'°*”

(b) Conduct Related to the Cyprus-Russia DTA

1291. Next, Respondent complains of Claimants’ use of the Cyprus-Russia DTA, listing the following
“bad faith and illegal conduct”:

xii, Submitting fraudulent claims under, or otherwise abusing, the Russia-Cyprus Tax
Treaty to evade hundreds of millions of dollars in Russian taxes payable on
dividends involving Yukos shares, thereby also violating Russian and Cypriot
criminal laws.

xiii. Entering into hundreds of sham transactions involving the sale and repurchase of
Yukos shares between Claimants and their affiliates, the sole purpose of which was
to fraudulently suggest that Claimants beneficially owned dividends declared on
Yukos shares, and thereby to further Claimants’ fraudulent claims for favorable tax
treatment under the Russia-Cyprus Tax Treaty.

xiv. Evading hundreds of millions of dollars in Russian taxes on profits from transactions
in and profits from sales of Yukos shares.

xvi. Diverting the proceeds of the Yukos tax evasion scheme into highly opaque Cypriot
and British Virgin Islands entities and trusts to conceal the unlawful provenance of
those proceeds, including through dividend distributions to undisclosed Cypriot
parent companies of trading shells, thereby further abusing the Russia-Cyprus Tax
Treaty.!

 

 

1292. The Russia—Cyprus DTA, as stated in its preamble, serves the “avoidance of double taxation
with respect to taxes on income and capital” and the promotion of “economic cooperation

between the two countries.” Article 10 of the DTA provides:

1. Dividends paid by a company which is a resident of a Contracting State to a resident of the
other Contracting State may be taxed in that other State.

2. However, such dividends may also be taxed in the State of which the company paying the
dividends is a resident and according to the laws of that State, but if the beneficial owner of

the dividends is a resident of the other State, the tax so charged shall not exceed:

5% of the gross amount of the dividends...”

1293. The Parties agree that Claimants Hulley and VPL obtained monetary benefits running in excess

of USD 230 million under this provision by claiming the reduced withholding tax rate of 5

percent instead of the standard 15 percent rate of the Russian Federation.

1294. Respondent argues that, in so doing, Hulley and VPL fraudulently relied on the Russia-Cyprus

DTA to evade Russian taxes, because they: (a) were not the “beneficial owners” of the dividend

income but mere “conduits” for the Oligarchs, and (b) had a “permanent establishment” in

1684

Russia to which the dividend income was attributable. According to Respondent,

Claimants’ reliance on the DTA was a “complete perversion of the Treaty’s purpose,” and, as

stated by Professor Rosenbloom, a “blatant example of tax treaty abuse.”!*

Respondent
alleges that Claimants contrived a series of artificial sales and repurchases of Yukos shares by
Hulley from YUL, and VPL parked shares in a UBS Moscow account at suspicious times,
solely to benefit from the DTA. According to Respondent, Claimants offer no justification for
this practice, aside from their expert, Mr. Baker, mischaracterizing it as a “standard

arrangement.””!°*°

1295. Respondent submits that the beneficial ownership requirement “should be construed in light of

L684

1685

1686

1687

the object and purposes of the [DTA], including avoiding double taxation and the prevention of

fiscal evasion and avoidance.”'**”

According to Respondent, Hulley and VPL never had the
full right to use or enjoy Yukos’ dividends. In support, Respondent refers to the following

documents:

. Hulley’s and VPL’s bank statements from | January 2000 to 31 December 2004,
as well as GML’s statement for 2004, which purportedly establish that the

dividends paid to Hulley and VPL by Yukos only stayed in their accounts for one

or two days prior to going to YUL;'8

. Hulley’s Articles of Association, which according to Respondent reserved to the

“Oligarchs” any decision concerning the disposal of Hulley’s assets;!°? and

° the Deed of Appointment of Chiltern as a custodian trustee for VPL, which,
according to Respondent, provides that all dividend income from VPL’s Yukos

shares “shall be paid” to YUL so long as Chiltern owns VPL.

1296. Respondent also argues that Claimants have contradicted their own arguments in the

jurisdictional phase of these proceedings by acknowledging an “obligation to pass all future
dividends” to YUL; this, argues Respondent, falls within even Claimants’ narrow interpretation

of the beneficial ownership limitation.'°”

1297. Respondent further asserts that Hulley and VPL each had a “Russian permanent

establishment.”!!

Respondent interprets Claimants’ admission that Hulley and VPL were
holding companies to mean that any activity necessary to conduct the business of holding
Yukos shares had to be carried out in Russia through a “deemed permanent establishment”
(Article 5(5) of the Cyprus-Russia DTA) or a “fixed place of business” (Article 5(2) of the
Cyprus-Russia DTA).'? Respondent contends that Messrs. Lebedev and Kakorin, both
Russian citizens and residents, carried out all the activities relating to Hulley’s and VPL’s

= 1693,
Yukos shares from Russia.'*

1298. Respondent further submits that Claimants’ alleged abuses violate both Russian and Cypriot

criminal laws, as shown in the expert report of Mr. Polyviou.'°*

1299. Finally, Respondent argues that Claimants’ expert, Mr. Baker, fails to differentiate the

tripping,” which Respondent alleges is what Claimants di Accordingly, Respondent

submits that, “at best,” Hulley and VPL “perverted” the purposes of the Cyprus-Russia DTA,

even if they satisfied its “literal requirements.”"°”°

1300. Claimants protest that Respondent’s allegations are unsubstantiated in fact and in law.

1301. Firstly, Claimants argue that the beneficial ownership limitation set forth in Article 10(2)(a) of

the Cyprus-Russia DTA is a “narrow one targeted at nominees, agents and other conduits under
an obligation to pass on the amount received as a dividend to another party.”!” Hulley and
‘VPL in the present case had the full right to use and enjoy the dividends they received from
Yukos and were under no obligation to pass them on to another entity, as is evident from
Clause 117 and Article 1 of their respective Articles of Association, which provide that the
power to propose the declaration and payment of dividends lies solely with the directors of the

respective companies.'°*

1302. Claimants assert that shares “transferred to a company shortly before the dividend dates and

transferred back after the dividend has been paid are lawful and a common feature in stock-

lending, and also in the sale and repurchase of shares (‘repos’).”"°”

1303. Secondly, Claimants assert that Hulley and VPL were holding companies, and that their

1700

business as such was not carried on in Russia. None of the cumulative conditions in

Article10(4) of the DTA were made out to show that Hulley or VPL had a permanent

establishment in Russia, as demonstrated by Mr. Baker’s report.'7"'

that ‘treaty shopping’ to minimize tax is permissible.'”

1305. Finally, Claimants submit that Hulley’s and VPL’s claims under the Cyprus-Russia DTA were
consistent with the purpose of the DTA. Claimants recall that one purpose of double-taxation
treaties is to promote the flow of investment, and argue that both countries have derived

significant benefits from the DTA.'™

1306. In any event, Claimants submit that the claiming of benefits under a double-taxation treaty is a
technical matter, for which specific mechanisms of redress are available under the treaty itself
and domestic law. Accordingly, this Tribunal is not the proper forum to hear and decide such

disputes.!7°°

(c) Conduct Related to the Tax Optimization Scheme

1307. Three items on Respondent’s list of Claimants’ “illegal and bad faith” conduct relate to
Claimants’ use of the low-tax regions of the Russian Federation to mitigate tax burdens:
xv. Engineering through management installed and controlled by Claimants the massive

Yukos tax evasion scheme to avoid paying hundreds of billions of rubles in Russian
taxes.

xvii. Engaging in abusive corporate restructurings to conceal Yukos’ affiliation with its
trading shells, thereby preventing Russian authorities from identifying and
addressing Yukos’ tax abuses.

xviii, Concealing Yukos’ continued control of its trading shells by resorting to call options
or other artifices and by fabricating corporate and other transactional documents.'

1308. A detailed discussion of these allegations is found in Chapter VIII.A of this Award.
(d) Actions Taken in Hindrance of the Enforcement of Russia’s Tax Claims

1309. The remaining ten items on Respondent’s list of Claimants’ “bad faith and illegal conduct”

refer to actions allegedly taken to obstruct enforcement of Russia’s tax claims against Yukos:

xix. Repeatedly obstructing the conduct of the tax authorities’ audits of Yukos by
refusing to provide documents and information which would show the extent of
Yukos’ abuses, and by causing Yukos’ producing subsidiaries and other related
entities to be similarly obstructive.

xx. Failing to pay Yukos’ tax liabilities for tax year 2000 and following years, despite
having received ample notice that Yukos would be required to pay these amounts
and despite the fact that Yukos had abundant resources to do so.

 

xxi, Dissipating assets to frustrate the Russian authorities’ collection of the tax
assessments, including by way of paying dividends of unprecedented amounts,
making 1 erated loan “ ” to Oligarch d Moravel,
and foisting upon YNG an upstream guarantee up to USS 3 billion for the repayment
of Yukos’ alleged “debts” to Moravel.

  

xxii. Offering to the Russian authorities assets which Yukos knew to be tainted to settle
its tax liabilities.

xxiii. Concealing the share registers of Yukos’ subsidiaries to obstruct the bailiffs’
enforcement of Yukos’ tax obligations.

xxiv. Sabotaging the YNG auction through litigation threats and a spurious bankruptcy
filing in the United States that effectively prevented all but one bidder from placing
a bid at the auction and artificially depressed the amount of the auction proceeds.

xxv. Implementing asset-stripping measures by diverting Yukos’ valuable assets to the
stichtings managed by former Yukos officers and representatives of Claimants in
anticipation of Yukos’ bankruptcy.

xxvi. Failing to repay Yukos’ debt to the SocGen syndicate and frustrating the banks’
attempts to collect against Yukos’ Dutch assets.

xxvii. In the process of all of the foregoing, lying to Yukos’ auditors PwC about core
aspects of their misconduct and, through PwC’s certification of Yukos’ financial
statements based on this deception of Yukos’ auditors, to Yukos’ creditors and other
members of the investing public who relied upon those financial statements and
PwC’s certification of them.

xxviii. Yukos management’s shielding of Yukos’ very substantial foreign assets behind the

veil of two Dutch stichtings, to place those assets beyond the reach of Russian tax
authorities, violated Dutch law.'””

1310. In sum, Respondent alleges that Yukos neither paid its tax debts in full immediately after these
debts were assessed, nor made reasonable settlement offers; dissipated the assets it had on
hand; lied to its auditors; obstructed the work of the bailiffs; and sabotaged the YNG auction.

Each of these allegations is discussed by the Tribunal in Part VIII of this Award.

3. Parties’ Positions Regarding the Impact of Claimants’ Allegedly “Unclean Hands”
on this Arbitration

1311. The Parties disagree as to whether any of the instances of alleged illegal or bad faith conduct
enumerated above could serve as a complete bar to Claimants’ claims under the ECT (whether
as a matter of jurisdiction, admissibility or otherwise) by virtue of the application of some rule

or principle of law.

1312. Between them, the Parties have dedicated to this controversy several hundreds of pages of
pleadings in the merits phase alone, citing in the process dozens of arbitral awards and
decisions rendered by the Permanent Court of International Justice (the “PCIJ”), the
International Court of Justice (“ICJ”) and mixed-claims commissions. Below, the Tribunal
does not attempt to do justice to the full breadth of the Parties’ arguments, but focuses instead

on their most salient points.

(a) Respondent’s Position

1313. Respondent submits that Claimants’ “unclean hands” deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction,
render Claimants’ claims inadmissible and/or deprive Claimants of the substantive protections

of the ECT. This submission is based on two main principles.

1314. First, Respondent argues that “the ECT protects only bona fide and lawful investments and

Respondent’s consent to arbitrate only extends to such investments.”!7*

Respondent
emphasizes that, as provided by Article 31(1) of the VCLT, a treaty must be interpreted in good
faith and in accordance with its object and purpose. According to Respondent, the object and
purpose of the ECT does not include the promotion and protection of illegal investments.'””
Rather, as stated in the Treaty’s introductory note, “[t]he fundamental aim of the [ECT] is to
strengthen the rule of law on energy issues.” Respondent argues that several arbitral awards,
including Phoenix Action, Ltd. v. Czech Republic (“Phoenix”), SAUR International S.A. v. The
Argentine Republic and Plama Consortium Limited v. Bulgaria (“Plama”) support the
proposition that, even in the absence of an express legality requirement clause in an investment

710

treaty, illegal investments will not be protectes With respect to Plama, in particular,

1315

Respondent notes that the tribunal dismissed the claimants’ ECT claims in the merits phase on
the grounds that: (a) the investment violated Bulgarian law and applicable principles of
international law; (b) the claimant’s conduct was not in good faith; and (c) to grant ECT

protection would therefore have been contrary to the clean hands requirement.'7"!

. Second, Respondent argues that a claimant who is guilty of illegal conduct is deprived of the

necessary ius standi to complain of corresponding illegalities by the State.'”

This requirement
of “clean hands,” argues Respondent, is a “general principle of law” within the meaning of
Article 38(1)(c) of the ICJ Statute.'7> Respondent cites the ICJ’s decision in the Case
Concerning the Gabéikovo-Nagymaros Project and various dissenting opinions by ICJ judges,
as well as a number of decisions of mixed claims commissions rendered in cases of diplomatic

protection.'”* Regarding the latter set of cases, Respondent submits that the “unclean hands

principle has [an even] greater role with respect to claims brought directly by private parties,

Respondent also relies on Barcelona Traction for the proposition that in international law the
corporate “veil is lifted” to “prevent the misuse of the privileges of legal personality, as in
certain cases of fraud or malfeasance . . . or to prevent the evasion of legal requirements or of

ssl 716

obligations. Finally, Respondent argues that if the “unclean hands” doctrine was not

included in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility and Articles on Diplomatic Protection of
the International Law Commission, it is only “because it corresponded to the doctrine of

inadmissibility” and did not fall within the projected scope of both sets of ILC Articles.'”"”

1316. With respect to Claimants’ contention that the instances of “unclean hands” referred to by

Respondent can have no impact on this arbitration because they are collateral illegalities

unrelated to either the making of Claimants’ investments or their claims in these arbitrations, '7!*

Respondent argues that it is “unsupported both by the investment treaty awards on which

[Claimants rely], and by common sense and good faith.”!”"°

1317. With respect to post-investment conduct, Respondent submits that the awards in Gustav FW

case dismissed claims brought by Canadian individuals who had invested in a “Ponzi scheme”
for lack of jurisdiction ratione materiae. Respondent highlights that tribunal’s finding that the
entire underlying transaction was illegal and, by that fact, “it follows that the acquisition by
each [c]laimant of the asset resulting from that transaction was also not in accordance with the
law of Costa Rica.”"”” Respondent submits that the finding of the Anderson tribunal applies in

the present case, highlighting that:

where an investment is simply transferred by the same ultimate owner from one investment
vehicle to another, the concept of the unity of the investment requires that the process of
the making and operation of the investment by the ultimate owner and the owner’s
investment vehicle be considered as a whole for purposes of determining the legality of the
investment, even if the acquisition of the investment by the claimant, standing alone, is not
illegal.'”

1319. To hold otherwise, argues Respondent, would extend investment treaty protection to claimants

who shift investments through several layers of ownership and control in order to launder their

illegal investments into legal ones qualifying for treaty protection.'”*

1320. In response to Claimants’ assertion that ‘in accordance with the law’ requirements should be

 

14

1726

limited to domestic laws regulating the admission of foreign investment, Respondent submits a

number of counter-arguments, including the following:

© Claimants’ reliance on the “isolated 2010 dictum” in Mr. Saba Fakes v. the Republic of
Turkey (“Saba Fakes”) to limit the substantive scope of the ‘in accordance with the law’
requirement is “unpersuasive and contrary to a consistent line of arbitral awards that have
applied ‘in accordance with the law’ clauses to domestic legislation other than laws

. soos : 991725
governing the admission of investments.

e the illegalities “infecting” Claimants’ investments are “quintessential breaches of
‘fundamental principles” and were “central to the profitability of and dividend flow from

js . 991726
Claimants’ investments.”’“°

e Claimants’ attempt to exclude minor violations from the scope of ‘in accordance with the

minor.

1321. In response to Claimants’ contention that they were not the relevant actors in the context of
Respondent’s allegations regarding Yukos’ tax optimization scheme and the obstruction of the
enforcement of tax claims against Yukos by the Russian Federation, Respondent submits that

Claimants are “essential instrumentalities of illegal acts, through Claimants’ control of Yukos

s91728

and its management, noting that during the relevant period, “Claimants owned a majority

of Yukos shares and appointed the totality of the members of its board of directors,

including . . . Mikhail Khodorkovsky.”

1322. Respondent also states that it is not estopped from invoking Claimants’ unclean hands in this

arbitration by any failure to take prompt action.'” Respondent submits that Claimants have

1731

failed to satisfy the legal standard for estoppel This standard, argues Respondent, was

confirmed by the ICJ in the North Sea Continental Shelf Cases:

[I]t appears to the Court that only the existence of a situation of estoppel could suffice to
lend substance to this contention, -- that is to say if the Federal Republic were now
precluded from denying the applicability of the conventional regime, by reason of part
conduct, declarations, etc., which not only clearly and consistently evinced acceptance of
that regime, but also had caused Denmark or the Netherlands, in reliance on such conduct,
detrimentally to change position or suffer some prejudice. Of this there is no evidence
whatever in the present case.'”*”

1323. Respondent submits that Claimants have failed to identify an unequivocal representation by

Respondent. In that regard, Respondent argues that Claimants’ reliance on Respondent’s
alleged failure to challenge illegalities earlier does not amount to an unequivocal
representation. Respondent also submits that Claimants have failed to establish that they
changed their conduct to their detriment in reliance on said representation. Particularly
regarding the alleged abuses of the Cyprus-Russia DTA, Respondent contends it raised its
objection to Hulley’s and VPL’s alleged violations in these arbitrations as early as October
2006, and thus, argues Respondent, “Claimants’ further suggestion that Respondent might be

estopped because it did not also raise these abuses ‘in an appropriate forum’ is absurd.’"”**

1324. Respondent adds that informal or contra legem acceptance of an investment by the host State’s

authorities that is illegal under the host State’s domestic law, or based on covert arrangements
unknown to the host State, cannot provide a basis for estoppel. In support, Respondent relies

on the Fraport award.'™*

1325. Finally, Respondent rejects Claimants proportionality argument, stating that it is based on

1735 Th the words

“rules governing countermeasures by an injured State in inter-State relations.
of Respondent: “the legality requirement excludes illegal investments from the scope of ECT
protection. As a result it is not that a host State is not justified in breaching obligations with
respect to illegal investments, but instead that it has no treaty obligations in the first

instance.”!”*°

(b) Claimants’ Position

1326. Claimants object that their “unclean hands,” even if proven by Respondent, could have no

impact on their claims in these arbitrations because: (a) the ECT does not contain any principle
of “unclean hands”; (b) no principle of “unclean hands” has been recognized as a general
principle of law; and (c) the instances of “unclean hands” alleged by Respondent are “collateral

illegalities” that do not fall within the parameters of any “unclean hands” doctrine.

1327. Claimants assert that it is “impossible to find any textual basis in the [ECT] for the

Ibid. | 1596, referring to Fraport 347
Ibid. §§ 1584-7

Respondent’s contention.”!”” They add that the introductory note to the ECT—a note which
Claimants contend is not an official document or interpretation of the ECT—confers an
obligation to strengthen the rule of law on States parties, rather than on the investor.'”**
Claimants highlight that Respondent chose not to quote the remainder of the note, which goes
on to state that the ECT’s aim of strengthening the rule of law on energy issues is to be
accomplished “by creating a level playing field of rules to be observed by all participating
governments, thus minimising the risks associated with energy-related investments and

391739

trade. In this regard, Claimants contend that denying a claimant access to a forum for

resolving its claims altogether would violate, rather than support, the rule of law.'”””

1328. Claimants seek to distinguish the Phoenix and Hamester ICSID awards relied upon by
Respondent. Claimants highlight that the statement relied on by Respondent to infer that a
jurisdictional requirement of compliance with host State laws is implicit, even when not stated,
is obiter dictum on account of the BIT provisions being applied by those tribunals.'”!

Similarly, Claimants submit that any reliance on the Plama award to insert a jurisdictional

requirement of “clean hands” into the relevant treaty is incorrect. Claimants submit that in the

Plama decision on jurisdiction, the tribunal considered and rejected an argument that the
illegality of the investment could affect its capacity to hear the dispute.'””

1329. Further, Claimants emphasize that the bar for recognition of general principles of international
law is set “extremely high”.'* Claimants assert that Respondent’s “unclean hands” theory

fails to meet this high threshold.

1330. Claimants allege that neither the PCIJ nor the ICJ have ever endorsed “unclean hands” as a
general principle of law.'' They also argue that the inter-state cases relied on by Respondent

are inapposite to this arbitration as they concern “situations in which two sovereign States have

assumed an identical or reciprocal obligation.”!75

Claimants further argue that the awards of
mixed claims commissions are of little guidance, as they deal mostly with diplomatic protection
and are of “ancient vintage.” In support, Claimants cite the Saba Fakes v. Turkey ICSID award,
in which the tribunal held that the “rules of customary international law applicable in the

context of diplomatic protection do not apply as such to investor-State arbitration.”!”“°

1331. Claimants note that the ILC Articles on State Responsibility and Articles on Diplomatic

Protection do not contain a principle of “unclean hands.”'*” They also argue that most scholars
reject the existence of an “unclean hands” general principle altogether, while its proponents

argue that it should be subject to certain well-defined limits.'”

1332. Claimants also submit that the investment tribunal awards relied on by Respondent in support

of a general principle of “unclean hands” were decided on other grounds and that Respondent’s
analysis of these awards is incomplete and misleading.’ According to Claimants, in each of
the ICSID awards cited by Respondent—Plama, Phoenix, Hamester and Inceysa Vallisoletana,
S.L. v. Republic of El Salvador (“Inceysa”)—the tribunal’s decision rested on a clause in the
relevant BIT conditioning jurisdiction on compliance by the investor with the laws of the host

State.

1333. Furthermore, Claimants argue that even if Respondent can make the case for a general principle

1745

of “unclean hands” or a legality requirement under the ECT, Respondent’s theory as applied to

this case rests on allegations of collateral illegalities unrelated to either the making of

Claimants’ investments or their claims in these arbitrations.'”*

1334. Claimants submit that even when interpreting treaty provisions expressly requiring compliance

with host State laws as a condition of jurisdiction, investment tribunals have strictly construed
such provisions.'”* Claimants submit that investment tribunals have only subjected the initial
making of the investment to a legality test. They also assert that the limited temporal scope

3 and

employed by investment tribunals renders alleged pre-investment conduct irrelevant,
limits its substantive scope, e.g., by extending only to host State laws “governing the admission
of foreign investments in its territory.’ Claimants emphasize that misconduct unrelated to
the making of an investment, or which concerns minor violations, has been disregarded by

investment tribunals.'”*°

1335. Claimants also submit that Anglo-American jurisprudence confirms that alleged illegalities

must have an “immediate” and “necessary” relation to a claimant’s cause of action.'”*°

1336. It follows, argue Claimants, that none of Respondent’s allegations are covered by any principle

of “unclean hands”. The actions complained of by Respondent with respect to the acquisition
of Yukos pre-date Claimants’ investments, depriving the Tribunal of jurisdiction ratione
temporis over those actions.'*’ The alleged abuses of the Cyprus-Russia DTA do not,
according to Claimants, have the required “immediate” or “necessary” relation to Claimants’

1758

claims. Claimants argue that to bar Hulley and VPL permanently from bringing claims

under the ECT for having claiming benefits under the Cyprus-Russia DTA to which they were

not entitled rests on an “impossibly broad interpretation” of the “unclean hands” concept.'””

1337. Claimants also point out that only the allegations of DTA abuses concern the conduct of

Claimants themselves, while the other 24 allegations concern the conduct of persons other than

Claimants. Claimants contend that Respondent provides no basis on which the conduct of these

third parties could render Claimants’ hands “unclean”.'”

1338. Claimants further assert that, even if any principle of “unclean hands” is potentially applicable

in the situation at hand, Respondent is estopped from raising matters in these arbitrations of
which it has long been aware, but has never challenged.'”*' Claimants argue that acquiescence,
or the silence or absence of protest in circumstances which generally call for a positive reaction
signifying an objection, may “in and of itself’ result in estoppel, where the other elements of

estoppel are not made out.'"

1339. In particular, Claimants reject Respondent’s allegations with respect to the creation and original

acquisition of Yukos in 1995. Claimants submit that it was Respondent that “planned,
organized, conducted and completed the privatization of the Russian Federation’s property

through the loans-for-shares program, including the privatization of Yukos.”!7

Similarly,
Claimants highlight that Respondent did not take legal action against Claimants for any of the
alleged violations of the Cyprus-Russia DTA by Hulley and VPL. Claimants underline that
Respondent must have had knowledge of many, if not all, of the alleged violations “as early as
October 2003, through the searches and seizures of documents at the Moscow premises of
GML MS, or at least as early as October 6, 2006 when the Respondent first raised the matter in

these arbitrations.”!”*

1340. Claimants also submit that, even if an “unclean hands” general principle existed, it would not

confer upon States the right to violate investors’ rights.'7°*

Drawing an analogy to counter-
measures, Claimants refer to Articles 49 and 54 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility and
to the ILC Commentary on the provisions, which states that such measures “are not intended as
a form of punishment for wrongful conduct, but as an instrument for achieving compliance with

the obligations of the responsible State.”!7°°

1341. The ILC Commentary further emphasizes that proportionality is a stand-alone requirement,

. Claimants submit that the need to weigh the proportionality of Respondent’s response to the
illegalities it alleges against Claimants provides further reason for rejecting Respondent’s
“unclean hands” objection to jurisdiction/admissibility. In Claimants’ own words: “it is for the
tribunal to assess such allegations . . . in its consideration of the merits of the investor’s claims,
bearing in mind that any response by the host State to any alleged illegality must comport with

its international obligations.”"”*

4, Tribunal’s Decision

Article 26(6) of the ECT provides that “[a] tribunal established under paragraph (4) shall decide
the issues in dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and principles of

international law.”

Article 31 of the VCLT, which is widely recognized as reflecting customary international law,
provides in its first paragraph that “[a] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance
with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light

of its object and purpose.”

. Looking first at the text of the ECT, the Tribunal observes that it does not contain any express
reference to a principle of “clean hands.” Nor, unlike some other investment treaties, does the
ECT contain an express requirement that investments be made in accordance with the laws of

the host country.'"® These points are not disputed by the Parties.

In the absence of any specific textual hook, the Tribunal must consider whether, given the need
to interpret treaties in good faith and take account of their object and purpose, the ECT as a
whole may be understood as conditioning the protection of investments on their legality, or on

the good faith of the investor. The Tribunal addresses this question in subsection (a) below.

Ibid. § 1195.
Ibid. § 1197.

See e.g. the bilateral investment treaties applied in Fraport, Exh, R-1006 (Germany-Philippines BIT: “[tJhe term
investment shall mean any kind of asset accepted in accordance with the respective laws and regulations of either
Contracting State”); Inceysa, Exh. R-1083 (Spain-El Salvador BIT: “[eJach Contracting Party shall protect in its
territory investments made, in accordance with its legislation”; “[the BIT shall] apply to investments .
accordance with the laws”); Phoenix, Exh. RE-1078 (Israel-Czech Republic BIT: “[tJhe term ‘investment’ sha
comprise any kinds of asset invested . . . in accordance with the respective laws and regulations.”

1347. In addition to any potential limitation on the protection of investments inherent in the ECT, a

principle of “clean hands” could be relevant to this arbitration pursuant to Article 26(6) of the
ECT if it were an “applicable rule[. . .] or principle[. . .] of international law.” The Parties
dispute whether “clean hands” exists as a “general principle of international law recognized by
civilized nations” in the meaning of Article 38(1)(c) of the Statute of the ICJ. The Tribunal

addresses this question in subsection (b) below.

1348. Finally, in subsection (c) below, the Tribunal considers whether any of the 28 instances of “bad

faith and illegal conduct” of which Respondent accuses Claimants fall within the scope of any

“unclean hands” or similar principle applicable in the ECT context.

(a) Cana Clean Hands Principle or Legality Requirement be Read into the ECT?

1349. The Tribunal notes that there is support in the decisions of tribunals in investment treaty

arbitrations for the notion that, even where the applicable investment treaty does not contain an
express requirement of compliance with host State laws (as is the case with the ECT), an
investment that is made in breach of the laws of the host State may either: (a) not qualify as an
investment, thus depriving the tribunal of jurisdiction; or (b) be refused the benefit of the

substantive protections of the investment treaty.

1350. The Plama tribunal, deciding a case under the ECT, thus stated that the “substantive protections

of the ECT cannot apply to investments made contrary to law.”"”” It acknowledged that the
ECT “does not contain a provision requiring the conformity of the Investment with a particular
law,” but stated that “[t]his does not mean . . . that the protections provided for by the ECT
cover all kinds of investments, including those contrary to domestic and international law.”!””!
The tribunal explained that, in that case, granting the claimant protection would have “be[en]
contrary to the principle nemo auditor propriam turpitudinem allegans” and “the basic notion

of international public policy—that a contract obtained by wrongful means (fraudulent

misrepresentation) should not be enforced by a tribunal.”!””

1351. Other arbitral tribunals have stated in obiter dicta that the principle that an investment “will not

0

be protected if it has been created in violation of national or international principles of good
Plama, Exh. C-994 139.

Ibid. § 138.
Ibid. 4 143.

= 429 -

faith” or “of the host State’s law” is a “general principle[. . . ] that exist[s] independently of

specific language” in an investment treaty.'””*

1352. The Tribunal agrees with this proposition. In imposing obligations on States to treat investors
in a fair and transparent fashion, investment treaties seek to encourage legal and bona fide
investments. An investor who has obtained an investment in the host State only by acting in
bad faith or in violation of the laws of the host state, has brought itself within the scope of
application of the ECT through wrongful acts. Such an investor should not be allowed to

benefit from the Treaty.

1353. For reasons that will become apparent further in this chapter, the Tribunal does not need to
decide here whether the legality requirement it reads into the ECT operates as a bar to
jurisdiction or, as suggested in Plama, to deprive claimants of the substantive protections of the

ECT.

1354. However, the Tribunal does need to address Respondent’s contention that the right to invoke
the ECT must be denied to an investor not only in the case of illegality in the making of the
investment but also in its performance. The Tribunal finds Respondent’s contention

unpersuasive.

1355. There is no compelling reason to deny altogether the right to invoke the ECT to any investor
who has breached the law of the host State in the course of its investment. If the investor acts
illegally, the host state can request it to correct its behavior and impose upon it sanctions
available under domestic law, as the Russian Federation indeed purports to have done by
reassessing taxes and imposing fines. However, if the investor believes these sanctions to be
unjustified (as Claimants do in the present case), it must have the possibility of challenging
their validity in accordance with the applicable investment treaty. It would undermine the
purpose and object of the ECT to deny the investor the right to make its case before an arbitral
tribunal based on the same alleged violations the existence of which the investor seeks to

dispute on the merits.

"5 Hamester §§ 123-24, Exh. R-1079. See also Phoenix § 101, Exh. R-1078 (“it is the Tribunal’s view that this condition
— the conformity of the establishment of the investment with the national laws — is implicit even when not expressly
stated in the relevant BIT”); SAUR { 308, Exh. R-4186 (“[the tribunal] is aware that the finality of the investment
arbitration system is to protect only lawful and bona fide investments. Whether or not the BIT between France and
Argentina mentions the requirement that the investor act in conformity with domestic legislation does not constitute a

ctor. The condition of not committing a serious violation of the legal order is a tacit condition, inherent to

‘s, in any event, it is incomprehensible that a State offer the benefit of protection through arbitration if the

investor, in order to obtain such protection, has acted contrary to the law.”)

1356. Respondent has not been able to cite any apposite authority in support of its contention. The
statements of investment tribunals it relies on were all made obiter and are too vague to allow
any certain conclusions to be drawn as to their intended meaning. For example, the statement
in Fraport that illegal acts in the course of an investment “might be a defense to claimed
substantive violations” appears to suggest that, in some cases, the State’s actions will have been
justified as an appropriate response to the investor’s violations of national law.'”* As is clear
from the decision, the statement by the Fraport tribunal does not imply the unavailability of the
substantive protections of the treaty, but rather concludes that the respondent State has not

incurred any liability under the treaty.

(b) Does the “Clean Hands” Doctrine Constitute a “General Principle of Law
Recognized by Civilized Nations”?

1357. Since the Tribunal will not read into the ECT any legality requirement with respect to the
conduct of the investment, it must consider Respondent’s more general proposition that a
claimant who comes before an international tribunal with “unclean hands” is barred from

claiming on the basis of a “general principle of law.”

1358. The Tribunal is not persuaded that there exists a “general principle of law recognized by
civilized nations” within the meaning of Article 38(1)(c) of the ICJ Statute that would bar an
investor from making a claim before an arbitral tribunal under an investment treaty because it

has so-called “unclean hands.”

1359. General principles of law require a certain level of recognition and consensus. However, on the
basis of the cases cited by the Parties, the Tribunal has formed the view that there is a
significant amount of controversy as to the existence of an “unclean hands” principle in

international law.

1360. Respondent has demonstrated that certain principles associated with the “clean hands” doctrine,
such as exceptio non adimpleti contractus and ex iniuria ius non oritur have been endorsed by

the PCIJ and the ICJ.'’”> However, the Tribunal notes that Judge Simma in his separate opinion

1361. With regard to the “unclean hands” doctrine proper, Respondent has referred to the dissenting
opinion of Judge Schwebel (a member of this Tribunal) in the Military and Paramilitary
Activities in and against Nicaragua ICJ case, where he concluded that Nicaragua’s claims
against the United States should fail because Nicaragua had “not come to Court with clean
hands.”'’”” Respondent also referred to other dissenting ICJ and PCIJ opinions where the
principle of “unclean hands” was invoked (albeit often without referring to it by name).'7”*
1362. However, as Claimants point out, despite what appears to have been an extensive review of
jurisprudence, Respondent has been unable to cite a single majority decision where an
international court or arbitral tribunal has applied the principle of “unclean hands” in an inter-
State or investor-State dispute and concluded that, as a principle of international law, it

operated as a bar to a claim.

1363. The Tribunal therefore concludes that “unclean hands” does not exist as a general principle of

international law which would bar a claim by an investor, such as Claimants in this case.

 

disregard the fact that the Treaty has not been fully implemented by either party for years, and indeed that their acts of
sion and omission have contributed to creating the factual situation that now exists. Nor can it overlook that
when deciding on the legal requirements for the future conduct of the Parties. This does not mean
is case, facts which flow from wrongful conduct—determine the law. The principle ex injuria jus non
ained by the Court’s finding that the legal relationship created by the 1977 Treaty is preserved and cannot
in this case be treated as voided by unlawful conduct.”)

(c) Would any Instances of Claimants’ Alleged “Bad Faith and Illegal” Conduct
be Caught by a Legality Requirement Read into the ECT?

1364. To summarize, the Tribunal accepts that a claimant may be barred from seeking relief under the

ECT if its investment was made in bad faith or in violation of the laws of the host state.

1365. It follows that the alleged instances of “unclean hands” listed in Subsections IX.B.2(b), (c) and

(d) above—specifically, the instances related to the alleged abuse of the Russia~Cyprus DTA,
the tax optimization scheme and the obstruction of Russia’s enforcement of tax claims against
Yukos, all of which relate to actions that were taken after the making of Claimants’ investment,

cannot have any impact on the availability of ECT protection for Claimants.

1366. This leaves for the Tribunal’s consideration Respondent’s allegations of bad faith and illegal

conduct in the acquisition of Yukos and the subsequent consolidation of control and ownership

over Yukos and its subsidiaries, set out in Subsection [X.B.2(a) above.

1367. It is common ground between the Parties that these actions were taken before Claimants

became shareholders of Yukos in 1999, 2000 and 2001 and, consequently, were not taken by
Claimants themselves, but by other actors, such as Bank Menatep and the Oligarchs.'””
Claimants submit that these actions are thus irrelevant to these arbitrations, as the conduct
complained of was not that of Claimants’ themselves and, in any event, pre-dates Claimants’

investment.'”*°

1368. Respondent replies that, on the contrary, the process of the acquisition of the Yukos shares by

1779

1780

Claimants should not be seen in isolation but as an integral part of the “making of the
investment” by Claimants. Respondent’s argument was most convincingly put by Dr. Claudia

Annacker during the Hearing. Dr. Annacker argued as follows:

Contrary to Claimants’ position, the serious illegalities that infect the entire process of the
acquisition of the Yukos shares by Claimants cannot simply be ignored because the
transfer of the shares to the Claimants . . . viewed in isolation, is asserted to be legal. These
illegalities cannot somehow be cured through multiple transfers within this network of the
oligarchs’ offshore companies from one shell company to another.

Indeed, the making of an investment is often a process rather than an instantaneous act, and
often comprises a number of diverse transactions. These transactions must be treated as an

See Counter-Memorial §{ 910-13, explaining the alleged illegal conduct of Bank Menatep and the Oligarchs in the
acquisition of Yukos shares by the Oligarchs in 1995 and 1996

See Reply ¥] 1135-36.

= 433 -

integrated whole. The transactions may have a separate legal existence, but they have a
common economic aim... .

Indeed, it would be incompatible with economic reality and undermine the integrity of the
legal process if serious irregularities — illegalities — infecting the process of the making of
the investment would not affect the availability of investment treaty protection, whether or
not a specific transaction, part of the process, if viewed in isolation, might be legal.

Now, this conclusion applies a fortiori where a claimant is not unrelated to the persons or
entities that committed these illegalities, but is an investment vehicle owned and controlled
by the same persons who committed the illegalities . . . Otherwise, investment treaty
protection could be achieved simply by shifting investments through layers of ownership
and control to launder illegal investments . . .

While Claimants’ acquisition of their shares may be a separate legal transaction, there is a
common economic aim pursued by the same oligarchs . . .'7*"'

1369. The Tribunal agrees with Respondent that an examination of the legality of an investment
should not be limited to verifying whether the last in a series of transactions leading up to the
investment was in conformity with the law. The making of the investment will often consist of

several consecutive acts and all of these must be legal and bona fide.

1370. In the present case, however, Respondent has failed to demonstrate that the alleged illegalities
to which it refers are sufficiently connected with the final transaction by which the investment
was made by Claimants. The transactions by which each Claimant acquired its investment
were their purchases of Yukos shares. As established in the Interim Award, these purchases
were legal and occurred starting in 1999.'"* On the other hand, the alleged illegalities
connected to the acquisition of Yukos through the loans-for-shares program occurred in 1995
and 1996, at the time of Yukos’ privatization. They involved Bank Menatep and the Oligarchs,
an entity and persons separate from Claimants, one of which—Veteran—had not even come

into existence.
and the oppression of minority shareholders, it is also clear to the Tribunal that they are not part

of the transaction or transactions by which each Claimant acquired their interest in Yukos.

1371. Respondent relies on Anderson for the proposition that “illegalities infecting an investment that
pre-date a claimant’s acquisition of the investment are not irrelevant or outside the tribunal’s

jurisdiction ratione temporis.”'"* However, the tribunal in that case examined and found to be

1372. While it is true that the claimants in Anderson were not blamed for the illegality that tainted

their investment, nevertheless it is the very transaction by which their respective investments

were obtained that was considered illegal by the tribunal, and led it to decline jurisdiction.

(d) Conclusion

1373. The Tribunal concludes that Respondent’s “unclean hands” argument fails as a preliminary

objection. It does not operate to deprive the Tribunal of its jurisdiction in this arbitration,
render inadmissible any of the Claimants’ claims or otherwise bar Claimants’ from invoking

the substantive protections of the ECT.

1374. However, as will be seen in Chapter X.E and Part XII, some of the instances of Claimants’

“jllegal and bad faith” conduct complained of by Respondent in the context of this preliminary

objection, could have an impact on the Tribunal’s assessment of liability and damages.

RESPONDENT’S OBJECTIONS UNDER ARTICLE 21 OF THE ECT

1. Introduction

1375. Another important threshold issue in this arbitration arises from Respondent’s objection under

1785

1786,

1787

Article 21 of the ECT. Respondent argues that, pursuant to this complex provision (containing
a “carve out” from the ECT for “Taxation Measures” at Article 21(1) and a “claw back” for
Article 13 of the ECT in relation to “taxes” at Article 21(5)), the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction
over claims with respect to “Taxation Measures” other than those based on expropriatory
“taxes”.!78° Claimants argue that the objection is without merit since, inter alia, Article 21 does

not apply to actions—including expropriations—carried out “under the guise of taxation.”!”*”

1376. The relevant provisions of Article 21 of the ECT for present purposes are paragraphs | (the

88

1788,

“carve-out”), 5 (the “claw-back”) and 7 (definitions), which in the English version’’™” read as

follows:

(1) Except as otherwise provided in this Article, nothing in this Treaty shall create rights or
impose obligations with respect to Taxation Measures of the Contracting Parties. In the
event of any inconsistency between this Article and any other provision of the Treaty, this
Article shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.

(5) (a) Article 13 shall apply to taxes.

(b) Whenever an issue arises under Article 13, to the extent it pertains to
whether a tax constitutes an expropriation or whether a tax alleged to
constitute an expropriation is discriminatory, the following provisions shall
apply:

(i) The Investor or the Contracting Party alleging expropriation shall
refer the issue of whether the tax is an expropriation or whether the
tax is discriminatory to the relevant Competent Tax Authority.
Failing such referral by the Investor or the Contracting Party, bodies
called upon to settle disputes pursuant to Article 26(2)(c) or 27(2)
shall make a referral to the relevant Competent Tax Authorities;

(ii) The Competent Tax Authorities shall, within a period of six months
of such referral, strive to resolve the issues so referred. Where
nondiscrimination issues are concerned, the Competent Tax
Authorities shall apply the non-discrimination provisions of the
relevant tax convention or, if there is no non-discrimination provision
in the relevant tax convention applicable to the tax or no such tax
convention is in force between the Contracting Parties concerned,
they shall apply the non-discrimination principles under the Model

The Tribunal has taken note of Claimants’ highlighting of the differences in the wording of paragraphs 5 and 7 of
Article 21 in some of the other official languages of the ECT. As will be seen from the Tribunal’s findings in this
chapter, the Tribunal does not need to address the relevance, if any, of these differences.

(7) For the purposes of this Article:

(a) The term “Taxation Measure” includes:

 

(i) any provision relating to taxes of the domestic law of the Contracting
Party or of a political subdivision thereof or a local authority therein;

and

(ii) any provision relating to taxes of any convention for the avoidance of
double taxation or of any other international agreement or
arrangement by which the Contracting Party is bound.

(b) There shall be regarded as taxes on income or on capital all taxes imposed on
total income, on total capital or on elements of income or of capital,
including taxes on gains from the alienation of property, taxes on estates,
inheritances and gifts, or substantially similar taxes, taxes on the total
amounts of wages or salaries paid by enterprises, as well as taxes on capital
appreciation.

(c) | A “Competent Tax Authority” means the competent authority pursuant to a
double taxation agreement in force between the Contracting Parties or, when
no such agreement is in force, the minister or ministry responsible for taxes
or their authorized representatives.

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, the terms “tax provisions” and “taxes” do not
include customs duties.

1377. Respondent’s objection under Article 21 of the ECT was originally addressed by the Parties

during the jurisdictional phase of the arbitration. In its Interim Awards, the Tribunal observed
that some of the arguments raised by the Parties under Article 21 went to the heart of the merits
of the dispute, in that they related to the background to and motivation behind Respondent’s tax
assessments, enforcement measures and other conduct, and that the Tribunal would not rule on
these issues in a vacuum.!” As a consequence, the Tribunal decided “to defer its definitive
interpretation of Article 21, and its characterization of [Claimants’] claims for purposes of

Article 21, to the next phase of the arbitration.”"””

1378. As a consequence, the Parties had a further opportunity to develop their positions under

Article 21 of the ECT during the merits phase of the present proceedings. Claimants’ and

Respondent’s arguments are now summarized in turn.

2. Claimants’ Position

1379. Claimants argue that Article 21 of the ECT does not apply to the case at hand since

actions”!”!

and merely a tool “to achieve a purpose that had nothing to do with taxation: the
elimination of a potential opponent and the appropriation of Yukos’ assets.”'””? According to
Claimants, “[i]t is no answer for a state to say that its courts have used the [word] ‘taxation’ . . .
in describing judgments by which they effect the dispossession of foreign investors. If that
were enough, investment protection through international law would likely become an illusion,
as states would quickly learn to avoid responsibility by dressing up all adverse measures,

991793

perhaps expropriation first of all, as taxation. Claimants refer in particular to the decisions

of the Quasar and RosInvestCo tribunals to support their view that in a case such as this one a

carve-out with regard to taxation measures cannot apply.'”*

1380. In addition, Claimants suggest that the carve-out under Article 21 of the ECT is narrower than

that in other treaties in that it only applies to the enactment of “provisions” relating to taxes, but
not to the application of these provisions and the “collection and enforcement” of taxes.'”°
Claimants refer to the ECT’s travaux préparatoires in this regard.” In particular, they point
out that during the negotiations of the ECT, the French delegation, in response to a
memorandum of the Legal Sub-Group noting that “taxation measures” were identified in an
illustrative manner, took the view that Article 21(7) of the ECT would constitute a definition

and that, therefore, “includes” in that provision would have to be replaced by “means”.!”””

1381. Claimants say that they “have no issue with the right of the Russian Federation to enact tax

Accordingly, Claimants take the view that for this reason alone Article 21 of the ECT cannot

apply.

1382. Claimants also take the view that, in any event, the ECT’s protection would still apply with

regard to the expropriation standard under Article 13 of the ECT, due to the claw-back
provision in Article 21(5) of the ECT, which they say must have the same scope as Article
21(1) of the ECT.'"* Claimants suggest that Respondent’s interpretation (according to which
the claw-back provision would be narrower in scope than the taxation carve-out) would lead to
“a_gaping hole in the ECT where investors would stand completely unprotected from
expropriatory taxation,” thus “defeat[ing] the object and purpose of the ‘claw-back’ and of the
ECT itself.”"' Claimants also dispute Respondent’s argument that Russian law should
determine the meaning of “tax” under Article 21(5) of the ECT, since “for the interpretation of

a treaty, you do not look at domestic law of one of the States parties to a treaty.”"*”

1383. In any event, Claimants argue that many of Respondent’s actions that they complain of have

nothing to do with taxation and thus fall outside of the scope of Article 21 of the ECT.'** In
this regard, Claimants state that “the attacks on Yukos and related persons involved all of the
following organs and entities: the Presidential Administration, the Russian courts, Ministry of
Justice, Federal Bailiff Service, Penitentiary Service, Ministry of Natural Resources, Internal
Affairs, FSB, Prosecutor General’s Office, Federal Property Fund, Rosneft” and included
“freezes, searches and seizures,” the auctioning of YNG and the forcing of Yukos into

bankruptcy, all of which would “have nothing to do with taxation.”

1384. Finally, Claimants assert that referring any questions with regard to taxation measures to the

1801

1802

1803

Russian Federation’s tax authorities as envisaged under the claw-back provision of Article
21(5) of the ECT would be an exercise in futility, as the relevant Russian authorities would
already have looked at the issues, the Parties’ submissions would be too voluminous to be

considered by any of the relevant authorities and the Tribunal would, in any event, not be

if the Tribunal were to find that Article 21(5) of the ECT applies, it should still proceed with its

examination of the case without any referral to the Russian authorities.

3. Respondent’s Position

1385. Respondent argues that most of the actions complained of by Claimants are outside the scope of

the Tribunal’s scrutiny due to the taxation carve-out provision in Article 21(1) of the ECT.

1386. Respondent points out that taxation carve-outs have a number of functions, which include

preserving States’ sovereignty in fiscal matters, the coordination of obligations under
investment treaties and double taxation treaties, and assuring that complex tax issues are

1806 To achieve these functions, taxation carve-outs

would typically be “broad, covering all aspects of the tax regime.”"*”” Respondent refers to a
number of instances where investment treaty tribunals gave effect to taxation carve-outs in
international investment treaties, namely the decisions in Duke Energy v. Ecuador, EnCana v.
Ecuador, El Paso International Company v. The Argentine Republic (“El Paso”), Burlington v.

Ecuador and Nations Energy v. Panama.'***

1387. With regard to the wording of Article 21(1) of the ECT, Respondent argues that the term

1810

“measures” is given a broad meaning throughout the ECT, in contradistinction to the narrower
term of “laws and regulations”.'*? As a consequence, says Respondent, an interpretation of
Article 21(1) of the ECT in accordance with recognized principles of treaty interpretation
shows that the provision “covers all measures taken by the legislative, executive, and judiciary
in the field of taxation, whether of general or individual application.”!*"° Respondent refers to

the ICJ’s judgment in Fisheries Jurisdiction (Spain v. Canada) to support its view that

cannot be to such a dissociation would be

absurd, since “[e]very time a contracting State enforces tax legislation that is carved out, but
would be inconsistent with the treatment standards in Part III, the State would incur

international responsibility for breach of Part III of the Energy Charter Treaty.”'*”?

1388. Respondent disputes Claimants’ argument that Article 21(7) of the ECT, properly interpreted,

applies only to the enactment of “provisions” relating to taxes. Respondent points out that the
word “includes” used in Article 21(7) of the ECT stands in contrast to the word “means” used
elsewhere, thus suggesting that the enumeration in that provision is not exhaustive.'*'?
Respondent also argues that, if the term “Taxation Measure” were limited to provisions relating
to taxes, the use of the word “includes” would not make sense, since Article 21(7) of the ECT
specifically refers to both “any provision relating to taxes” in “the domestic law of the
Contracting Party” and “any provision relating to taxes” in an “international agreement . . . by
which the Contracting Party is bound.”'*'* Since “all provisions relating to taxes are either
contained in domestic law or in international treaties,” Respondent claims that there would be

nothing left to add.'*'°

1389. Respondent rather suggests that “[t]he term ‘Taxation Measure’ has a meaning in itself’ and

that “it provides a benchmark to determine which measures or categories of measures, in

the ECT.”'*'® Respondent refers to the ECT’s travaux préparatoires to support its view that the
list in Article 21(7) of the ECT is “illustrative” and “not a definition”.'"*""7 In particular,

Respondent points out that, during the negotiations of the ECT, the Canadian delegation, in

response to a memorandum of the Legal Sub-Group noting that “taxation measures” were
identified in an illustrative manner, remarked that this was intentional and that “it would be
counterproductive to come up with anything more precise.”'*'® It also suggests that, while the
French delegation expressed a preference for an exhaustive definition and for the word
“includes” to be replaced by “means”, by not proceeding with the suggested replacement, the

“negotiating States chose to maintain an illustrative list.”!*!”

1390. In addition, Respondent refers to Article 21(2)(b) and (3)(b) of the ECT as implying that the

term “Taxation Measure” includes the generic term “measure” “as consistently used throughout

the Energy Charter Treaty.”'**’ According to Respondent, “Claimants would have this Tribunal

rewrite Article 21(7)(a) to read: ‘The term ‘Taxation Measure’ only includes provisions

p91 821

relating to taxes. In reality, according to Respondent, “[t]he purpose of Article 21,

paragraph 7(a) ECT is not to replace the term ‘measures’ with the term ‘provisions’, but to
clarify that the carve-out extends to both domestic and international taxation measures.”'*”?
This would be in line with general treaty practice, which would show that “there is not a single

taxation carve-out that is limited in scope to tax legislation.”!*”*

1391. The result of this interpretation, according to Respondent, is that “the core allegations on which

Claimants base their claims are squarely within the taxation carve-out of Article 21(1)” of the

EcT,'*

Respondent refers to the ECtHR Yukos Judgment to support its claim that the tax assessments

against Yukos pursued a legitimate aim and were not politically motivated.'*”*

1393. In any event, Respondent claims, referring to the ICJ’s Fisheries Jurisdiction (Spain v. Canada)
judgment, that the question of legality can have no impact on the qualification of an act as a
“taxation measure”,'*”° and it suggests that measures “in apparent reliance” on taxation

legislation, even if abusive, must be covered by a taxation carve-out.'*”” Respondent also refers

 

to a number of decisions of investment treaty tribunals to support this view. In particular,
Respondent quotes from the decision in EnCana v. Ecuador, according to which “provided a
matter is sufficiently clearly connected to a taxation law or regulation (or to a procedure,
requirement or practice of the taxation authorities in apparent reliance on such a law or
regulation), its legality is a matter for the courts of the host State.”'** Similarly, Respondent
quotes from the decision in Burlington v. Ecuador as having taken the view that the claim that a

State “used its tax power in bad faith . . . challenges [that State’s] tax power, and therefore

ises « 5 > 991829
raises ‘matters of taxation’ .”"*”?

1394. In addition, Respondent avers that an exception to a substantive standard (such as the carve-out

of Article 21(1)) cannot logically refer to the substantive standard (such as the expropriation

0

standard of Article 13) to determine whether or not the exception applies.'*’ Therefore,

according to Respondent, “neither the standards under Article 13 . . . nor the standards under
Article 10, paragraph 1 of the ECT can be used to determine the scope or the applicability of
the taxation carve-out.”"*' Accordingly, Respondent claims that the question of the legality of
any taxation measures, including their bona fide nature, falls under Article 21(1) of the ECT

and can be determined by an arbitral tribunal “only to the extent clawed back” pursuant to

Article 21(5) of the ECT.'*? This would mean in particular that “[t]he Tribunal . . . lacks

jurisdiction over Claimants’ Article 10 claims, and Article 10(1) ECT is inapplicable.”'*

1395. With regard to the claw-back provision in Article 21(5) of the ECT, Respondent argues that the

reference to “taxes” rather than “taxation measures” is deliberate and implies that only
“compulsory contributions to the Government” can be examined under that provision, but not
“fines, interest, enforcement fees” or “other tax collection and enforcement measures.”!*** The
basis for this would be that, in its ordinary meaning, “a tax” would be “a charge or a
contribution imposed by the State for public purposes,” but not “tax enforcement and collection

991835
measures.

1396. To support its reading of the claw-back provision, Respondent refers to the travaux

préparatoires, claiming that, while the claw-back provision originally referred to “Taxation
Measures”, in June 1993 a new version of the draft of the provision was circulated, in which
these references were replaced with references to “taxes”.'*’ According to Respondent, this
change “was certainly not incidental or unintentional.”'*” Respondent also dismisses the idea
that the different wording of Article 21(5) of the ECT in some of the other official languages of
the ECT should be accorded any relevance, since the negotiations of the Treaty would have
been conducted solely in English and translations into other languages would only have been
prepared after the conclusion of the negotiations without input from the negotiating teams.'***
This must, according to Respondent, be taken into account as part of the circumstances

surrounding the conclusion of the ECT in accordance with Article 32 of the VCLT.'*”

needs to be determined pursuant to Russian law. This would be in line with the practice under
tax treaties, which generally leaves the term of “taxes” undefined, adopting the meaning of the

term under the domestic law of the State that imposed the tax.'*!

Respondent refers in this
regard for instance to Article 3(2) of the OECD Model Tax Convention on Income and Capital
and the Cyprus-Russia DTA, pointing out that both instruments are referenced in the claw-back

provision of Article 21(5) of the ECT.'**

1398. More generally, Respondent argues that “in the absence of autonomous rules or concepts of

international law, international law must turn for guidance to domestic law . . . as developed
within the State’s domestic jurisdiction”? Under Russian law, a “tax” would be defined in

Article 8 of the Russian Tax Code as a “mandatory . . . payment” collected “to provide financial

1844

support to the government” for public purposes. This would exclude “tax enforcement,

[and] collection measures,” including “interest, fines, [and] enforcement fees,”'*45

1399. Respondent argues that a limited claw-back would also be “very much in line with treaty

1841

1842

practice,” which would be “diverse” and variable “with respect to the type of measures that are
clawed back.”!™® In particular, Respondent refers to the Russia-Sweden BIT, which contains a

carve-out with regard to “taxation matters”, whilst also providing that some of its provisions

oy 1847

shall apply to “taxes’ For Respondent, this provision constitutes proof that “States

are... free to claw back only a subcategory of the measures they decided to exclude from the
scope of the Treaty” and that “they do so”.'“* The “deliberate choice of the ECT Contracting
Parties to limit the expropriation claw-back to taxes” would in fact “represen[t] a middle

ground of varying practices of the ECT Contracting Parties.”'"“”

1400. Finally, Respondent argues that, if the Tribunal were to find that both the carve-out and the

claw-back provisions apply, the Tribunal would be required to make a referral to the
“Competent Tax Authorities”.'*’ This would include “the Russian Ministry of Finance, the
Cypriot Ministry of Finance, and the UK Inland Revenue”'**'; and this is so “because the
referral procedure replicates the dispute settlement procedures under double taxation
agreements.”'** According to Respondent, “[tJhe referral mechanism . . . forms part of the
ECT Contracting Parties’ consent to submit themselves to international arbitration pursuant to
Article 26 ECT, and it precludes any ruling by the Tribunal whether a tax constitutes an

expropriation . . . without having made referral to the tax authorities.”!***

4, Tribunal’s Decision

(a) Introduction

1401. As mentioned earlier, the Tribunal deferred its decision on Article 21 because the Parties’

arguments in relation to this provision during the jurisdictional phase raised issues that went to
the heart of the merits of the dispute and the Tribunal decided that it could not rule on these

issues in a vacuum.

1402. Now, at the conclusion of the merits phase of the present proceedings, the Tribunal has the

necessary context within which to evaluate the Parties’ arguments, analyze and interpret

Article 21, and characterize Claimants’ claims for purposes of Article 21.

1403. Before turning to Article 21 itself, the Tribunal considers it helpful to recall its principal

findings on those core issues relating to the merits that are particularly relevant for Article 21.

1404. In Chapter VIII.B, the Tribunal concluded, on the totality of the evidence, that the tax

authorities used the “re-attribution” formula not only so as to be able to collect the revenue-
based taxes against Yukos, but also so as to establish a basis for imposing on Yukos the
massive VAT liability and excessive fines that followed. In the Tribunal’s view, while Yukos
was vulnerable on some aspects of its tax optimization scheme, principally because of the
sham-like nature of certain elements of its operations in at least some of the low-tax regions,

1408.

and could have faced some legitimate claims relating to revenue-based taxes had the Russian
Federation limited itself to bona fide taxation measures, the State apparatus decided to take
advantage of that vulnerability; it did so by launching a full assault on Yukos and its beneficial
owners in order to bankrupt Yukos and appropriate its assets while, at the same time, removing
Mr. Khodorkovsky from the political arena. The Tribunal has come to these conclusions based

on its review of the entire record, as detailed in the other chapters of Part VIII, above.

The Tribunal now has to decide, in these circumstances, if and how Article 21 applies, and
whether it deprives the Tribunal of its jurisdiction, as argued by Respondent, to consider
Claimants’ claims under Article 10 of the ECT (in the event the carve-out applies), and perhaps

even under Article 13 of the ECT (if the carve-out applies and the claw-back does not apply).

Both Parties made extensive submissions on Article 21, both in writing and orally. Having
considered the Parties’ arguments, the Tribunal concludes that it has jurisdiction to rule on
Claimants’ claims under Article 13 of the ECT for two independent reasons, each of which in
and of itself suffices to justify the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. Firstly, the Tribunal finds that,
irrespective of its findings regarding the applicability of Article 21 of the ECT to the present
case, it would have “indirect” jurisdiction over claims under Article 13 of the ECT because any
measures excluded by the carve-out under Article 21(1) of the ECT would be brought back
within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction by the claw-back of Article 21(5) of the ECT and any referral
to the Competent Taxation Authorities within the meaning of this latter provision would clearly

have been futile.

Secondly, the Tribunal finds that, in any event, the carve-out of Article 21(1) can apply only to
bona fide taxation actions, i.e., actions that are motivated by the purpose of raising general
revenue for the State. By contrast, actions that are taken only under the guise of taxation, but in
reality aim to achieve an entirely unrelated purpose (such as the destruction of a company or the
elimination of a political opponent) cannot qualify for exemption from the protection standards
of the ECT under the taxation carve-out in Article 21(1). As a consequence, the Tribunal finds
that it does indeed have “direct” jurisdiction over claims under Article 13 (as well as Article 10)

in the extraordinary circumstances of this case.

The Tribunal will now develop each of these reasons.

= 447 -

(b) First Reason: Assuming the Carve-Out Applies, So Does the Claw-Back, and
Any Referral to the Competent Tax Authorities Would Clearly have been
Futile

1409. Firstly, the Tribunal concludes that it has jurisdiction under Article 13 of the ECT, even

assuming that the carve-out in Article 21(1) of the ECT applies. This determination is based on
both the scope of the expropriation claw-back in Article 21(5) of the ECT relative to the scope
of the taxation carve-out in Article 21(1) of the ECT, and the futility of any referral to the
Competent Tax Authorities under Article 21(5) of the ECT. The Tribunal will expand upon

each of these points in turn.

i. The Scope of the Claw-Back in Article 21(5)

1410. Respondent argues that the term “Taxation Measures”, used in the carve-out, should be given a

broad meaning, including collection and enforcement measures, while the term “taxes”, used in
the claw-back, should be given a narrow meaning, which would exclude collection and
enforcement measures. The Tribunal cannot accept Respondent’s arguments for the following

reasons.

1411. Firstly, the Tribunal observes that the term “Taxation Measures”, used in Article 21(1), is

defined in Article 21(7)(a) to mean “provisions” of domestic tax law and tax treaties, while the

term “taxes”, used in Article 21(5), is not defined in the Treaty.

1412. Pursuant to Article 31 of the VCLT, “[a] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance

with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light

of its object and purpose.”

1413. In the view of the Tribunal, the ordinary meaning of “tax” used in Article 21(5) cannot be

1854

narrower than the meaning of “Taxation Measure” used in Article 21(1). Respondent’s
interpretation of “Taxation Measures” and “taxes” would, as Claimants submit, result in a wide
carve-out and a narrow claw-back, “reinstating protection from expropriation [under Article 13
of the ECT] only in relation to ‘charges and payments’, but not collection and enforcement

sl 854

measures or interests and fines. The Tribunal agrees with Claimants that such an

interpretation would lead to “a gaping hole in the ECT where investors would stand completely

= 448 -

991855

unprotected from expropriatory taxation. Such an interpretation would defeat the object

and purpose of the claw-back and of the ECT itself.

1414. Respondent refers the Tribunal to a number of treaties that contain a taxation carve-out, but that

either do not contain any claw-back provision or limit the claw-back to certain substantive
protection standards, and argues that its proposed interpretation of Article 21 of the ECT
corresponds to a “middle ground of varying practices.” The Tribunal, having reviewed those

treaties, finds those provisions of no assistance to its interpretation of Article 21 of the ECT.

1415. In any event, the Tribunal, having found that the interpretation of Article 21 of the ECT

according to the general rule of interpretation under Article 31 of the VCLT results in a
meaning that is neither ambiguous nor obscure and does not lead to a result which is manifestly
absurd or unreasonable, does not need to call in aid any other rule of interpretation. Finally, the
Tribunal does not find much helpful guidance in the travaux préparatoires of the ECT.
Respondent claims that the replacement of “Taxation Measures” with “taxes” in a draft of
Article 21(5) of the ECT circulated in June 1993 could not have been incidental. However, if
this replacement had been motivated by the intention of the negotiators to limit the scope of the
claw-back provision in Article 21(5) of the ECT compared to the scope of the carve-out in
Article 21(1) of ECT, the Tribunal would expect such a motivation to have found some

additional expression in the record.

1416. The Tribunal therefore holds that any measures falling under the taxation carve-out of

Article 21(1) of the ECT are also covered by the scope of the expropriation claw-back in
Article 21(5) of the ECT.

ii, The Referral to Competent Tax Authorities

1417. The Tribunal recalls Article 21(5)(b), which sets out the following referral mechanism:

1855

(b) Whenever an issue arises under Article 13, to the extent it pertains to whether a tax
constitutes an expropriation or whether a tax alleged to constitute an expropriation
is discriminatory, the following provisions shall apply:

(i) The Investor or the Contracting Party alleging expropriation shall refer the
issue of whether the tax is an expropriation or whether the tax is
discriminatory to the relevant Competent Tax Authority. Failing such
referral by the Investor or the Contracting Party, bodies called upon to settle

1418. According to Respondent, “[t]he referral mechanism . .

disputes pursuant to Article 26(2)(c) or 27(2) shall make a referral to the
relevant Competent Tax Authorities;

The Competent Tax Authorities shall, within a period of six months of such
referral, strive to resolve the issues so referred. Where non discrimination
issues are concerned, the Competent Tax Authorities shall apply the non-
discrimination provisions of the relevant tax convention or, if there is no
non-discrimination provision in the relevant tax convention applicable to the
tax or no such tax convention is in force between the Contracting Parties
concerned, they shall apply the non-discrimination principles under the
Model Tax Convention on Income and Capital of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development;

Bodies called upon to settle disputes pursuant to Article 26(2)(c) or 27(2)
may take into account any conclusions arrived at by the Competent Tax
Authorities regarding whether the tax is an expropriation. Such bodies shall
take into account any conclusions arrived at within the six-month period
prescribed in subparagraph (b)(ii) by the Competent Tax Authorities
regarding whether the tax is discriminatory. Such bodies may also take into
account any conclusions arrived at by the Competent Tax Authorities after
the expiry of the six-month period;

Under no circumstances shall involvement of the Competent Tax Authorities,

beyond the end of the six-month period referred to in subparagraph (b)(ii),
lead to a delay of proceedings under Articles 26 and 27.

. precludes any ruling by the Tribunal
without having made referral to the tax
authorities.”'*°* Specifically, Respondent argues that Article 21(5)(b)(i) requires the Tribunal
to make a referral to “the Russian Ministry of Finance, the Cypriot Ministry of Finance, and the

UK Inland Revenue.”'**”

1419. Claimants, on the other hand, take the view that a referral is not warranted, for two reasons.

Firstly, Claimants argue that the requirement is triggered only if there is an allegation that “a
tax constitutes an expropriation,” whereas in the present case, according to Claimants, their
investments were not expropriated by “a tax”, but “by a combination of many types of actions
Secondly,

Claimants argue that any referral made to the Russian Ministry of Finance, or the tax authorities

1859

According to Claimants, the Russian Ministry of Finance would effectively be asked to “be a

judge in its own cause,” and asking the tax authorities to review the entire file—written

submissions, relevant correspondence, expert reports, witness statements, hearing transcripts

and over 8,000 exhibits—and to comment on it, would amount to a “useless exercise”. °°

1420. The Tribunal does not accept Claimants’ first argument, since it ignores the logic by which the

Tribunal would have come to this point in its reasoning. If the Tribunal were considering
Respondent’s measures under the claw-back of Article 21(5), it would be because the Tribunal
would have found previously that there was no meaningful distinction between the scope of
“Taxation Measures” and “taxes” for purposes of Article 21, or indeed because it would have
found that even if measures “under the guise” of taxation were covered by the carve-out, then
they must also be covered by the claw-back. The referral mechanism therefore cannot be

avoided on the basis of a narrow interpretation of the term “tax” in Article 21(5)(b)(i).

1421. Claimants’ futility argument, however, is persuasive. In this particular case, the Tribunal is

convinced that a referral to the tax authorities of the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom
and/or Cyprus would be (and, at any earlier stage of the proceedings, would have been) an

exercise in futility.

1422. The record before the Tribunal is enormous. The arguments and allegations of the Parties

relating to various taxes and the reasons for which they should or should not be considered
expropriatory have filled briefs adding up to thousands of pages, have relied on some
8,800 exhibits and were presented to the Tribunal in oral hearings scheduled over a six-week
period. It is inconceivable that the gist of this case, for either side, could have been reduced to
a meaningful submission of a size and scope that might have been digested by the relevant tax
authorities in a way that would have given them an opportunity to provide timely and pertinent

guidance to the Tribunal.

1423. Thus, while the Tribunal acknowledges that the referral mechanism in the claw-back provision

1860)

1861

of Article 21(5) was designed to assist tribunals “to distinguish normal and abusive taxes,” as
noted by Professor Park in his “Tax Arbitration and Investor Protection” article cited by

Respondent,'**!

this is simply not a case in which the Tribunal could have been assisted by
referring the matter to the tax authorities. As the Tribunal has noted at various stages in the

present Award, its conclusions ultimately rest on a consideration of the totality of the evidence

presented to it. The tax authorities, on the other hand, would necessarily need to focus on

discrete taxes or discrete issues related to taxes.

1424. The requirement for an investor to make a referral under Article 21(5)(b)(i), first sentence (and,

a fortiori, the requirement for the Tribunal to make a referral under Article 21(5)(b)(i), second
sentence) cannot, in the Tribunal’s view, apply in cases where such a referral would obviously
be futile. Like any provision in an international treaty, Article 21(5)(b)(i) of the ECT must be
interpreted in good faith. A good faith interpretation of the provision leads to the conclusion
that a referral cannot be required if following the referral procedure would clearly be futile

under the circumstances of a specific case.

1425. It has long been recognized, with regard to the exhaustion of local remedies requirement in the

1862

context of the principles on diplomatic protection,” that following a prescribed procedure

may be dispensed with under circumstances where doing so clearly would not produce the
result that the procedure seeks to achieve. The relevant principle is set out in Article 15(a) of
the 2006 ILC Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection, providing that “[l]ocal remedies do not
need to be exhausted where . . . there are no reasonably available local remedies to provide
effective redress, or the local remedies provide no reasonable possibility of such redress.”'*
Tribunals adjudicating claims of investors under international investment treaties have made
similar findings with regard to the obligation of investors to observe so-called cooling-off

1864

periods” or the requirement to submit a dispute to litigation in the host State’s domestic

: . . s
courts for a certain period of time.'**°

1426. The Tribunal is of the view that a referral must be regarded as clearly futile if there is no

1862

1863

1865

possibility that the relevant authorities would in fact be able to come to some timely and

meaningful conclusion about the dispute or make any timely determinations that could

potentially serve to assist the Tribunal’s decision-making. The Tribunal finds, for the reasons

stated above, that no such possibility exists or existed in this case.

1427. Furthermore, the Tribunal notes that neither Party disputes that, in the event of a referral, any

determinations of the Competent Tax Authorities regarding whatever discrete issues they might
have been able to focus on relating to whether any tax was an expropriation would not have
been binding on the Tribunal. The wording of Article 21(5)(b)(iii) of the ECT is very clear:
bodies such as the present Tribunal may take into account any conclusion arrived at by the

Competent Tax Authorities regarding which the tax is an expropriation.'*°

1428. In conclusion, the Tribunal holds that a referral of the dispute to the “Competent Tax

Authorities” within the meaning of Article 21(5)(b)(i) of the ECT would clearly have been

futile at the outset of this arbitration and was therefore not required. It remains futile today.

iii, Conclusion

1429. As a consequence, assuming (for the sake of argument) that some of Respondent’s measures

fell within the scope of the carve-out in Article 21(1), the Tribunal would nevertheless be in a
position to proceed to determine whether the relevant measures constituted a violation of
Article 13 of the ECT under the claw-back. It could do so even though it has not referred the
issue of whether any tax is an expropriation to any of the Competent Tax Authorities because to

do so would clearly be an exercise in futility.

(c) Second Reason: The Carve-Out Does Not Apply

1430. Secondly, and independently from the above reasoning, the Tribunal concludes that it has

jurisdiction to rule on Claimants’ claims under Article 13 of the ECT due to the fact that the
Article 21 carve-out does not apply to the Russian Federation’s measures because they are not,
as the Tribunal has concluded above, on the whole, a bona fide exercise of the Russian

Federation’s tax powers.

1431. This accords with Claimants’ view that Article 21 of the ECT can apply only to bona fide

1866,

taxation actions, i.e., actions that are motivated for the purpose of raising general revenue for

the State. By contrast, actions that are taken only “under the guise” of taxation, but in reality

1436.

aim to achieve an entirely unrelated purpose (such as the destruction of a company or the
elimination of a political opponent), argue Claimants, cannot qualify for exemption from the

protection standards of the ECT under the taxation carve-out in Article 21(1).

The Tribunal essentially accepts the latter interpretation of Article 21.

To find otherwise would mean that the mere labelling of a measure as “taxation” would be
sufficient to bring such measure within the ambit of Article 21(1) of the ECT, and produce a
loophole in the protective scope of the ECT. Since the claw-back in Article 21(5) of the ECT
relates only to expropriations under Article 13 of the ECT, a State could, simply by labelling a
measure as “taxation”, effectively avoid the control of that measure under the ECT’s other
protection standards. It would seem difficult to reconcile such an interpretation with the

purpose of Part III of the ECT.

The Tribunal cannot agree with Respondent that, by finding that Article 21(1) of the ECT
applies only to bona fide taxation, the Tribunal would be conflating the requirements for the
application of the taxation carve-out (representing an exception to the protection standards
under the ECT) and the requirements for the application of the protection standards themselves.
For example, Article 13 of the ECT could be violated through a bona fide taxation measure that
was aimed at the raising of State revenue, but whose effect was expropriatory. By contrast, the
characterization of an incriminated action by a respondent State as a Taxation Measure for
purposes of Article 21(1) of the ECT would be independent of the effects of that action, but

rather depend on the motivation underlying it.

The Tribunal also sees no reason to assume that it would be better for the question of the
motivation underlying a particular measure to first be addressed through the “Competent Tax
Authorities” (pursuant to the referral mechanism under Article 21(5) of the ECT), as the
particular expertise of these authorities does not extend to the question of whether an act that on
its face appears to be a taxation measure is in reality implemented for improper reasons. To the
contrary, where the tax authorities of a State have participated in measures against an investor
whose true purpose is unrelated to taxation, submitting these issues to the preliminary

examination of the same authorities would add little value for an arbitral tribunal.

The Tribunal further observes that, by making this finding, it is in good company, and that the
two eminent arbitral tribunals which have previously considered, on an admittedly more limited

record, essential elements of the dispute now before it, have adopted the same view.

= 454 -

1437. Thus, the Ros/nvestCo tribunal concluded that:

[I]t is generally accepted that the mere fact that measures by a host state are taken in the
form of application and enforcement of its tax law, does not prevent a tribunal from
examining whether this conduct of the host state must be considered, under the applicable
BIT or other international treaties on investment protection, as an abuse of tax law to in
fact enact an expropriation.'*””

1438. Similarly, the Quasar tribunal opined that:

1439. By contrast, neither the EnCana v. Ecuador decision

It is no answer for a state to say that its courts have used the word “taxation” . . . in
describing judgments by which they effect the dispossession of foreign investors. If that
were enough, investment protection through international law would likely become an
illusion, as states would quickly learn to avoid responsibility by dressing up all adverse
measures, perhaps expropriation first of all, as taxation. When agreeing to the jurisdiction
of international tribunals, states perforce accept that those jurisdictions will exercise their
judgment, and not be stumped by the use of labels.'**

award'*” to which Respondent refers in support of its view that any measure “adopted in
1871

apparent [reliance on] tax legislation” should fall under the taxation carve-out, in fact

appears to endorse such a position.

1440. Thus, while the tribunal in EnCana stated that, for a measure to fall under the taxation carve-

1873

out in the treaty before it, it would have to be “sufficiently clearly connected to a taxation law
or regulation (or to a procedure, requirement or practice of the taxation authorities in apparent

reliance on such a law or regulation),”"*””

the emphasis in this formulation appears to have been
on the “sufficiently clea[r]” connection to an existing legal provision or practice, rather than the
“apparent reliance” of the authorities on the existence of a legal basis for their actions. This is
supported by another statement of the EnCana tribunal in the same paragraph, according to
which “an arbitrary demand unsupported by any provision of the law of the host State would

not qualify” for an exemption under the taxation carve-out.'*”

1441. The context of the statement also makes it clear that the tribunal was only addressing minimum

requirements for the application of the taxation carve-out before it, rather than expressing any
views about situations in which the carve-out provision would not apply. Thus the tribunal
emphasized that, for a measure to come under the treaty’s carve-out, it would have to be
“sufficiently clearly connected to” or supported by some taxation law, regulation or actual
practice (the latter of which would in turn have to be based on a taxation law or regulation). It
did, however, neither say nor imply that any measure which the authorities based on a taxation
law or regulation would by definition be regarded as a taxation measure and therefore justify

the application of the carve-out.

1442. It makes sense to regard a tax demand that is effectively motivated not by the aim of raising

public revenue but by a purpose extraneous to taxation as an “arbitrary demand” that, in the
words of the EnCana tribunal, cannot qualify for an exemption under a taxation carve-out.'*”
Such an interpretation is also supported by the statement of Claimants’ expert Professor
Crawford, who was the presiding arbitrator in the EnCana arbitration and according to whom
the decision was not meant to imply “that anything labelled as a taxation measure is excluded”

by a taxation carve-out.'*”

1443. Neither does the Burlington decision referred to by Respondent support the view that a taxation

1874

1875

1876

177

carve-out would have to apply to any measure adopted by tax authorities in apparent reliance
on tax legislation. In Burlington, the tribunal notes that “bad faith” of the respondent
mentioned by the claimant rested on its allegation that Ecuador had forced the claimant to give
up certain contractual rights by the use of its taxation legislation.'*”° There was no suggestion
in that case that Ecuador had taken any measures against the investor for motives that were
entirely unrelated to the raising of public revenue. As a consequence, the tribunal in
Burlington, when it said that the claimant’s suggestion “that Respondent used its tax power in
bad faith in order to force Claimant to surrender its rights” under the contracts raised “matters
of taxation”,'*”’ was referring to the specific situation in that case that cannot in any way be

compared to the one at issue in the present proceedings.

1449,

It follows that Article 21(1) of the ECT, which applies only to bona fide taxation measures,
does not find any application in this arbitration. The tax assessments levied against Yukos by
the Russian Federation, which the Tribunal has found were designed mainly to impose massive
liabilities based on VAT and related fines, and were essentially aimed at paralyzing Yukos
rather than collecting taxes, are not exempt from scrutiny under the ECT, as they are not

captured by the carve-out of Article 21(1).

Similarly, and a fortiori, subseq! steps in the of the tax are not
captured by the carve-out, because the Tribunal has found that they too were exigently pursued
by means that indicate that Yukos was not just being chased to pay taxes, but was being driven

into bankruptcy.

(d) Conclusion

Based on the analysis set out in this chapter of the Award and for the two independent reasons
set out above, the Tribunal has jurisdiction to consider whether the Russian Federation is liable
to Claimants under Article 13 of the ECT for the measures which it has adopted and which

have resulted in the evisceration of their investments and the destruction of Yukos.

While the Tribunal’s finding that the carve-out in Article 21(1) does not apply would in
principle allow the Tribunal to consider the measures under both Articles 10 and 13 of the ECT,
in the circumstances, as will be seen, it will not be necessary for the Tribunal to consider

whether the expropriatory measures of Respondent are also in breach of Article 10 of the ECT.

LIABILITY

Having dismissed Respondent’s preliminary objections to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, the
admissibility of Claimants’ claims and the applicability of the ECT in the present case, the
Tribunal now turns to the question of the Russian Federation’s liability under the Treaty. In
Part VIII, the Tribunal canvassed the evidentiary record put before it by the Parties. In this
Part X, the Tribunal draws the legal consequences of its factual conclusions, beginning by

addressing questions of attribution.

As has already been mentioned, the Tribunal’s eventual conclusions regarding the alleged
breaches by Respondent of Article 13 (Expropriation) of the ECT will make it unnecessary for

the Tribunal to consider the application of Article 10 (Promotion, Protection and Treatment of

-457-

Investments). Nevertheless, for the sake of completeness, the Tribunal will set out the Parties’
arguments with regard to Article 10. The Tribunal will then set out the Parties’ arguments in
respect of Article 13. Finally, the Tribunal will set out its decision regarding Respondent’s

liability and Claimants’ contributory fault.

A. ATTRIBUTION

1450. The Parties are divided on the question of whether some of the actions of which Claimants
complain are attributable to the Russian Federation. Below, the Tribunal sets out the Parties’

submissions and its own views on this question.

1. Claimants’ Position

1451. Claimants summarize their position with regard to the attribution of acts said to constitute

breaches of the ECT to Respondent in their Memorial as follows:

[T]he Russian Federation has acted through almost all of its organs, be it Executive or
Judiciary, at all levels, including the highest, in seeking the destruction of Yukos. These
include the President of the Russian Federation, the Presidential Administration, the Tax
Ministry (later to become the Federal Taxation Service, a federal body of executive
authority within the Ministry of Finance), the Ministry of Justice (under whose authority
federal bodies of executive authority such the Federal Bailiff Service or the Federal
Penitentiary Service are acting), the Prosecutor General’s Office (a federal body entrusted
with the task of execution of the laws in the name of the Russian Federation), the Ministry
of Internal Affairs (responsible for the police forces), the Federal Security Service (also a
federal body of executive authority, acting under the authority of the President). When not
acting through these Executive organs or through the Russian courts, the Russian
Federation was acting through State-owned entities, first and foremost State-owned
company Rosneft . . .'""*

 

   

[emphasis added]
1452. Claimants put forward a similar view at the Hearing:
[W]e complain of acts of the executive organs. That’s the President: the Prime Minister:

ministries, including Tax, Justice and Interior Ministries; and their constituent bodies, the
Federal Bailiffs Service and the Federal Penitentiary Service under Justice.

  

We complain of the actions of executive bodies or agencies: that would be the Prosecutor
General’s Office, the Federal Property Fund and the Federal Security Services. We also
complain of the actions of the courts .... These are actions of the Russian Federation
State organs, and they are, by definition, actions of the State.'*”

1453. In particular, with regard to the bankruptcy proceedings against Yukos, Claimants assert that:

The Russian Federation initiated the bankruptcy proceedings through Rosneft, whilst the
Russian courts ensured that the Russian State directly and through Rosneft would be the
main creditor in the proceedings, systematically rejecting the claims of creditors related to
Yukos or Yukos’ shareholders. Thus placed in the driving seat in these bankruptcy
proceedings, the Russian State, acting through the Federal Taxation Service and Rosneft,
rejected the Rehabilitation Plan proposed by Yukos’ management and paved the way for
itself, through bankruptcy receiver (Mr. Rebgun) and the Russian Federal Property Fund to
distribute the rest of Yukos’ assets by auctioning them at bargain prices. The vast majority
of the proceeds went to the Russian State, with Rosneft acquiring Yukos’ two other main
production assets, Samaraneftegaz and Tomskneft, at a substantial discount.”"**”

 

 

[emphasis added]

1454. Claimants seek to attribute the following actions of Rosneft (some of them through Rosneft-

Rosneft’s action in acquiring Yugansk through Baikal, a special vehicle used to conceal
Rosneft’s involvement in the Yuganskneftegaz auction.

Rosneft’s entering into an agreement with the consortium of banks in order to initiate the
bankruptcy and precipitate the liquidation of Yukos.

[T]he decisions made at the creditors’ meeting hand in hand with the Russian Tax
Ministry, namely: to vote against the rehabilitation plan; to vote against the admission of
any Yukos-related creditor; and to vote for the liquidation of Yukos.'**'

due to the latter’s ownership of and control over the former, which would be “established by
the fact that members of Rosneft’s Board of Directors hold parallel positions in the Executive
branch of the Russian Federation and that Rosneft’s President is appointed by the Russian
Executive.”'*** Claimants refer to a statement made by Rosneft in the context of its IPO in July
2006, acknowledging that “the Russian Government . . . controls Rosneft and may cause
Rosneft to engage in business practices that do not maximize shareholder value.”'** Claimants
also cite a statement made by President Putin at a press conference in December 2004 and a

decision rendered by the Amsterdam Court of Appeal in proceedings between Yukos Capital

and Rosneft in April 2009 as further support for the control of Rosneft’s actions by

Respondent.'***

1456. Finally, Claimants submit that Respondent’s argument that, for a breach of a host State’s ECT

obligations to have occurred, challenged actions must have been taken by the host State in the
exercise of puissance publique is a “nice invention.”'**° All that matters, argue Claimants, is
whether the acting entity is an organ of the State, not the capacity in which it is acting.'**”
Claimants quote the commentary to Article 4 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility: “[i]t
is irrelevant for the purposes of attribution that the conduct of a State organ may be classified as
‘commercial’ or acta iure gestionis . . . the entry into or breach of a contract by a State organ is
nonetheless an act of the State for the purposes of article 4, and it might in certain

circumstances amount to an internationally wrongful act.”'***

2. Respondent’s Position

1457. Respondent denies that the actions of any of the following entities can be attributed to it, as

none of these entities would have exercised governmental authority or acted under the
instructions of, or under the direction or control of, Respondent: Sibneft, Gemini Holdings,
Nimegan Trading, Rosneft, YNG.'** Respondent also denies that the actions of Mr. Rebgun,
Yukos’ interim manager and receiver, or the actions of “the meeting and the committee of

Yukos’ bankruptcy creditors,” can be attributed to Respondent, for the same reasons.'*””

State. Respondent cites several decisions of investment treaty tribunals as well as the

decision of the Grand Chamber of the ECtHR in Kotov v. Russia to support this view.'**

Regarding Rosneft, Respondent does not deny that it held 75.16 percent of the shares in this
company, that members of the company’s Board of Directors held parallel positions in the
Russian Government, or that the company’s President was appointed by the Russian
Government. However, Respondent insists that this is not enough to satisfy the standard of
attribution under Article 8 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, and that Claimants must
prove a link between any relevant actions of Rosneft or YNG and specific instructions given by

the Russian State.'*** As explained by Respondent at the Hearing:

[W]hat Claimants must establish to attribute the conduct of Rosneft under Article 8 to
Respondent—but which they clearly have not proven—is that in acquiring YNG from
Baikalfinance, entering into the agreement with SocGen and voting for Yukos’ liquidation
at the creditors’ meeting, Rosneft was acting pursuant to specific instructions of a Russian
State organ.'*

[emphasis added]

Similarly, with respect to the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings, Respondent asserts that
“what Claimants must establish, but what they clearly have not proven, is that in filing the
bankruptcy petitions... YNG were acting under the instructions or directions or control of
Russian State organs.”"*°°

With regard to the standard applicable under Article 8 of the ILC Articles on State
Responsibility, Respondent explains that:

The commentary to Article 8 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility notes that “it is
made clear that the instructions, direction or control must relate to the conduct which is
said to have amounted to an internationally wrongful act.” As regards “direction or
control,” the commentary states that “[s]uch conduct will be attributable to the State only if
it directed or controlled the specific operation and the conduct complained of was an
integral part of that operation.”

1462. Respondent also quotes the following passage from the commentary on the ILC Articles on

State Responsibility, which notes that the fact a State initially establishes a corporate entity is
not a sufficient basis for the attribution to the State of the conduct of that entity, unless the

. . “189
entity exercises elements of governmental authority.'***

1463. Respondent refers to several decisions of investment treaty tribunals (in particular Jan de Nul v.

Egypt, White Industries v. India and Hamester) as well as to the decision of the Iran-U.S.

Claims Tribunal in Flexi-Van Leasing v. Iran to support these statements.'*”

1464. Finally, although Respondent does not deny that the Russian Tax Ministry is a State organ, the

actions of which can in principle be attributed to the State under Article 4 of the ILC Articles
on State Responsibility, Respondent submits that it cannot be held liable for the actions taken
by the Tax Ministry in the context of Yukos’ bankruptcy because such actions were not taken in
the exercise of puissance publique. In particular, Respondent submits that it cannot be held

liable for the Tax Ministry’s vote to liquidate Yukos at the creditors’ meeting.'"°°

3. Tribunal’s Decision on Attribution

1465. The Parties’ differences in respect of attribution are centered on whether there can be attributed

to Respondent actions of Rosneft in the acquisition of YNG, and in precipitating and
participating in the bankruptcy proceedings. Their differences also include whether the course
of the bankruptcy proceedings and the actions in respect of them by the bankruptcy

administrator, Mr. Rebgun, are, in whole or in part, attributable to the Russian Federation.

1466. The ILC Articles on State Responsibility are in point. They and their commentary are

conveniently republished in a book edited by Professor James Crawford, then the

1901

Commission’s special rapporteur on the topic. Chapter II, “Attribution of Conduct to a

attributed to the State at the international level is that of its organs of government, or of others
who have acted under the direction, instigation or control of those organs, i.e., as agents of the

State"

Article 8, “Conduct directed or controlled by a State,” provides that “[t]he conduct
of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of State under international law if the
person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction and
control of, that State in carrying out the conduct.”!°> The commentary to Article 8 observes

that:

Questions arise with respect to the conduct of companies or enterprises which are State-
owned and controlled .... The fact that the State initially establishes a corporate entity . . .
is not a sufficient basis for the attribution to the State of the subsequent conduct of that
entity... Since corporate entities, although owned by and in that sense subject to the
control of the State, are considered to be separate, prima facie their conduct in carrying out
their activities is not attributable to the State unless they are exercising elements of
governmental authority... [and] the instructions, direction or control [of the State] must
relate to the conduct which is said to have amounted to an internationally wrongful act.'°**
The Parties agree that the actions of organs of the Russian State, whether executive, judicial or
administrative, are attributable to Russia. As noted, disagreement is essentially confined to the
actions of Rosneft (and Rosneft-controlled YNG) and the actions of the bankruptcy

administrator.

. The Russian State owned all, or, subsequently, over 70 percent of the shares of Rosneft.
Rosneft’s officers were and are appointed by the State and many of the members of Rosneft’s
Board of Directors concurrently occupied and occupy senior executive positions in
Government, some close to President Putin.'°> All this however does not suffice to attribute to
the Russian State the actions of which Claimants especially complain: (a) Rosneft’s
collaboration with Baikal in the sale of YNG at auction and its immediate repurchase by
Rosneft; (b) Rosneft’s agreement with the SocGen bank creditors syndicate of Yukos to pay the

debt of Yukos to those banks, the banks at the same time undertaking to petition Russian courts

For example, Mr. Igor Sechin, the Chairman of Rosneft’s Board of Directors from 2004 to 2012, was also from 2004

for the bankruptcy of Yukos; and (c) Rosneft’s successful bids at the bankruptcy auction for

much of what was left of Yukos.

1469. That is because it would be difficult, if not impossible, to prove that Rosneft in so acting, did so
at the instructions or direction, or under the control of the Russian State—but for one
remarkable fortuity that bears on the auction of the shares of YNG and their acquisition by
Rosneft.

1470. President Putin conducted a press conference with Russian and foreign media on 23 December
2004.'°°> He was asked by V. Terekhov (Interfax), “in the wake of serious events that occurred
tonight, when Nefteyugansk passed into the ownership of a state company. Will you comment .

.. 2” President Putin replied:

Now regarding the acquisition by Rosneft of the well-known asset of the company—I do
not remember its exact name—is it Baikal Investment Company? Essentially, Rosneft, a
100% state owned company, has bought the well-known asset Yuganskneftgaz. That is the
story. In my view, everything was done according to the best market rules . . . a state
owned company or, rather, companies with 100% state capital, just as any other market
players, have the right to do so and, as it emerged, exercised it. Now what would I like to
say in this context? You all know only too well how the privatization drive was carried out
in this country in the early 90s and how, using all sorts of stratagems, some of them in
breach even of the then current legislation, many market players received state property
worth many billions. Today, the state, resorting to absolutely legal market mechanisms, is
looking after its own interests. I consider this to be quite logical.

1471. Towards the end of this lengthy press conference, K. Eggert (BBC), noting that there had been
a lot of criticism in Western press and official circles of the sale of YNG, asked for the reaction
of President Putin to “this criticism and does it concern you at all?” President Putin responded
by sharply criticizing the Texas bankruptcy proceedings brought by Yukos and the responsive
court ruling as “unacceptable from an international legal point of view . . . a breach of
international politeness” and a manifestation of U.S. “imperium”. He concluded: “As for the
deal that took place, I think that it was carried out in strict conformity with the Russian
legislation and in accordance with the norms of international law and the international
commitments that Russia has taken on as part of the agreements that we have signed with our

partners on the international stage. So I do not see any real problems here.”

1472. In this latter comment about agreements that Russia had signed, President Putin may have had

the ECT in mind. What at any rate is critical is his statement at the opening of the press

196 President of Russ
Exh. C-422

 

Official Web Portal, Press Conference with Russian and Foreign Media, 23 December 2004,

conference that, with regard to Rosneft’s purchase of the YNG shares from Baikal, “the state,
resorting to absolutely legal market mechanisms, is looking after its own interests.” He did not
say that Rosneft was looking after its own interests, but that the purchase signified that the
Russian State was looking after “its own interests”. In the view of the Tribunal, that statement
constitutes President Putin’s public acceptance and assertion that Rosneft’s purchase of the
YNG shares from Baikal was an action in the State’s interest, the inference being that the State,
then 100 percent shareholder of Rosneft, the most senior officers of which were members of
President Putin’s entourage, directed that purchase in the interest of the State. It follows that
that act, as well as the auction of YNG shares that underlay it, is attributable to the Russian

State.

1473. Claimants have invoked as well Rosneft’s press release of 27 June 2005, in which Rosneft
declared that, given that it is wholly owned by the State, “Rosneft acts on its behalf.”""’ They
also noted a statement made by Rosneft in the context of its IPO in July 2006, acknowledging

that “the Russian Government . . . controls Rosneft . . . .”'°°*

1474. It does not necessarily follow from the foregoing that the actions of Rosneft in contracting with
the SocGen bank creditors of Yukos, and in bidding at the bankruptcy auction of Yukos itself,
are attributable to Russia. Yet it may well be that in taking those actions, Rosneft did so at the
sub rosa direction of the Russian State, at the direction of senior officers of President Putin’s
entourage who concurrently ran Rosneft. In the view of the Tribunal, it may reasonably be
concluded that Rosneft was so directed. Or, if not, that it was not because it did not need to be;
Rosneft was such a creature of President Putin’s entourage that it reflexively implemented his
policies. But proving that admittedly is elusive, in the absence of an inculpatory admission on

behalf of the Russian State such as that of President Putin in respect of the acquisition of YNG.

1475. Are the actions of the bankruptcy administrator, Mr. Rebgun, attributable to the Russian

Federation?

1476. Respondent observed in its Rejoinder that “[i]Jn most European legal systems a liquidator or
bankruptcy receiver is not a State organ” and that bankruptcy managers and receivers do not

“generally exercise elements of governmental authority or act under the instructions, direction

including Plama’’” and Oostergeel v. Slovak Republic’ as well as the decision of the Grand
Chamber of the ECtHR in Kotov v. Russia'*”? in support of this conclusion. Those decisions

are indeed supportive.

1477. Claimants did not address these arguments at the Hearing, where they appeared to limit their
complaints in the context of the bankruptcy proceedings to “the actions of the Russian courts,
who appointed the interim receiver and confirmed all his actions, as well as the actions of the

admitted creditors, namely the Tax Ministry and Rosneft.”!°"*

1478. Respondent has maintained that the actions of the Tax Ministry—incontestably an organ of the
Russian State—in asserting and realizing its predominant claims to the assets of Yukos in the
bankruptcy proceedings, nevertheless are not in breach of the ECT because the Tax Ministry
there acted as a mere commercial creditor and did not exercise governmental authority. “The
votes of the Russian tax authorities are attributable to Respondent, but are not an exercise of
puissance publique. The tax authorities voted at the Creditors’ Meeting, and, more generally,
participated in Yukos’ bankruptcy proceedings in their capacity as a Yukos creditor alongside
other creditors, enjoyed no special prerogatives or privileges, and were subject to the same rules
as private creditors, the 2002 Bankruptcy Law.”'*'* Moreover, Respondent contends that the
Moscow Arbitrazh Court’s “acceptance of the bankruptcy petitions and ratification of the
creditors’ decision to liquidate Yukos does not change this conclusion . . . [It] enforced
legislation governing private-law relations, specifically, bankruptcy legislation, which imposes
limitations inherent in private property. Loss resulting from a court’s enforcement of legal
limitations inherent in private property is not compensable under Article 13 or 10(1) ECT,
irrespective of whether the court proceedings were instituted by a State organ.”"*'°

1479. The foregoing line of argument runs up however against the ILC Articles on State

Responsibility. Article 4 provides that “[t]he conduct of any State organ shall be considered an

The commentary to this article specifies that “[i]t is irrelevant for the purposes of attribution
that the conduct of a State organ may be classified as ‘commercial’ or as ‘acta iure

gestionis’.”"""6

1480. In respect of attribution, the Tribunal concludes that the Russian Federation is responsible for

its organs, executive, judicial and administrative, in the actions that they took against and in
relation to Yukos and its stockholders; that, for the reasons stated above, the Russian
Federation, speaking through its President, accepted responsibility for Rosneft’s acquisition of
YNG and for the auction that underlay it; and that, in respect of other actions of Rosneft that
bear on the destruction of Yukos, while proof of specific State direction is lacking, it may
reasonably be held that the highest officers of Rosneft who at the same time served as officials
of the Russian Federation in close association with President Putin acted in implementation of
the policy of the Russian Federation. The actions of Mr. Rebgun as bankruptcy administrator

are not attributable to Respondent.'?"”

Article 10
PROMOTION, PROTECTION AND TREATMENT OF INVESTMENTS.

(1) Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty,

encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for

conditions shall include a commitment to accord at all times to Investments of
Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment. Such
Investments shall also enjoy the most constant protection and security and no

measures their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal. In no case
shall such Investments be accorded treatment less favourable than that required by
international law, including treaty obligations. . . .

It is of interest to note that, in an interview with the Vedomosti paper in October 2006, Mr. Rebgun is alleged to have

1482. The Tribunal will first summarize the Parties’ arguments regarding applicable legal standards

under Article 10(1) of the ECT, and then turn to the Parties’ arguments regarding whether

Claimants have made out a breach of these standards by Respondent.

2. Applicable Legal Standards under Article 10(1) of the ECT

(a) Claimants’ Position

1483. In respect of the obligations imposed by Article 10(1) on host States, Claimants refer, as being

particularly relevant to the present case, to Respondent’s obligation to accord Claimants’
investments “fair and equitable treatment” and its obligation not to impair Claimants’

investments by discriminatory measures.!°'*

1484. With regard to fair and equitable treatment, Claimants submit that, as a general matter, it is “a

broad and widely accepted standard”'’!? encompassing such fundamental standards as “good

faith, due process, non-discrimination and proportionality”,'°”” “procedural propriety”,'”' “the

right to be heard and to present evidence”,'"” “proper notice of administrative actions to be
taken by the State”!””* and “transparency, protection of legitimate expectations . . . and freedom

- 39 192
from coercion and harassment”.'°™*

1485. Claimants submit that fair and equitable treatment in Article 10(1) of the ECT is a “non-

of treatment for investments.'””°

1486. Claimants emphasize that fair and equitable treatment is an “objective standard that does not

require bad faith by the [host] State.”"”?”

1487. Claimants further submit that denial of justice can constitute a breach of the fair and equitable

treatment standard and refer to several awards that define the legal standard for establishing a

denial of justice: Azinian v. Mexico, Rumeli v. Kazakhstan, Chattin, Mondev v. United States,

1928

Brown vy. Great Britain, and Petrobart v. Kyrgyz Republic. Claimants submit that

“[iJnternational law has long accepted the responsibility of States for the actions of their courts,

especially where those actions involve judicial impropriety and malfunctions in the

91929

administration of justice. Claimants submit that a substantive denial of justice may be

found in instances of gross misapplication of the law,'*° but that most often denial of justice

will be related to p dural inad ies." A dingly, say Claimants, the concepts of due

process and denial of justice are “closely linked”, such that “a failure to allow a party due

process will often result in a denial of justice.”

1488. However, Claimants contend that Respondent, by arguing that the threshold for Article 10(1) is

In support of their criticism, Claimants refer to the awards in

of this Tribunal, where he wrote that:

[w]hat in another case may or may not be fair and equitable treatment by a State of foreign
investment may involve procedural matters, or matters of substance, or both, far removed
from the confines and criteria of a denial of justice.'™*

1489. It follows, submit Claimants, that while investment tribunals have considered the fair and

equitable treatment standard to include the manner in which an investor and its investment are

treated by the host State’s courts “mainly through the prism of denial of justice . . . this is by no

means exhaustive of the standar In sum, Claimants’ position is that, while denial of

justice forms part of the fair and equitable treatment standard, the latter standard is not limited

to the former.'°*°

1490. Claimants also submit that freedom from arbitrariness and discrimination forms part of the fair

and equitable treatment standard.'°*”

In support of their submission, Claimants refer to the
award in Saluka Investments BV v. The Czech Republic (“Saluka”)—quoted verbatim by the
Biwater Gauff v. United Republic of Tanzania (“Biwater”) and Rumeli v. Kazakhstan
tribunals—which established the proposition that the standard of reasonableness has no
different meaning in this context than in that of the fair and equitable treatment standard with

pe . 3
which it is associated,’

1491. Claimants submit that the Plama v. Bulgaria award confirms that “unreasonable” conduct is

1934

synonymous with “arbitrary” conduct.'**’ Claimants also contend that many tribunals, such as
those in Lemire v. Ukraine and Siemens A.G. v. The Argentine Republic (“Siemens”), have
tuled that various State actions, not “based on reason”, and comparable to those alleged against

Respondent were “arbitrary”.'“°

1492. Claimants further submit that the principle of proportionality is an element of the fair and

equitable treatment standard, as confirmed in MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A. v.
Chile (“MTD v. Chile” and Vivendi v. Argentina."

1493. Many arbitral tribunals, say Claimants, have also held that a stable legal and business

environment is an essential element of fair and equitable treatment.'**

They refer to the
concepts of consistency, transparency and treatment that does not frustrate the legitimate
expectations of the investor as being essential to ensure such an environment’? Claimants cite
the PSEG Global v. Turkey award, where the tribunal stated that “the ‘roller-coaster’ effect of
the continuing legislative changes” seriously breached the fair and equitable treatment

obligation.'°*

1494. Claimants also contend that Article 10(1) of the ECT includes a stand-alone prohibition against

discrimination that is breached if the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of
the investor’s investment is impaired. The test for identifying discriminatory measures, submit
Claimants, is described in Plama as entailing “like persons being treated in a different manner

in similar circumstances without reasonable or justifiable grounds.”!"**

1495. Further, Claimants argue that the non-discrimination standard in Article 10(1) of the ECT is not

1941

1942

1943

1944

1945

1946,

limited to measures taken because of the foreign nationality of the investor. Claimants
emphasize that nothing in the wording of Article 10(1) of the ECT suggests such a limit to the
standard. This is particularly obvious when Article 10(1) is contrasted with Article 10(7) of the
ECT, which contains the most-favored-nation treatment and national treatment standards. It
follows, argue Claimants, that “when the ECT’s drafters intended to restrict a non-
discrimination provision to nationality-based discrimination, they expressly did so.”!™**
Claimants contend that the former U.S. BIT negotiator, Mr. Vandevelde supported this
interpretation:

Nothing in the language [of the ECT] suggests that it is limited to discrimination based on
nationality... Although the most common competitive disadvantages imposed on

Claimants also rely on the awards in Plama, Al-Bahloul v. Tajikistan’”” and National Grit
for the proposition that arbitral tribunals interpreting the ECT and other investment protection
treaties with identical or similar provisions have concluded that the non-discrimination standard

is not restricted to a protection against nationality-based discrimination.'°*°

Claimants contend that the authorities relied upon by Respondent for the contrary proposition

9 . .
5! Claimants characterize

either contradict Respondent’s position or are inapposite.
Respondent’s “selective quoting” from the LG&E Energy Corp. et al. v. The Argentine
Republic award as “unfortunate.” They say that, in fact, in the paragraph immediately
following the one cited by Respondent, the Tribunal said the exact opposite. They point out
that the tribunal found that “while there was no intent to discriminate against the investments
on account of the investors’ nationality, there was differential treatment of similar
companies.”'*? Claimants also highlight that Respondent’s reliance on declarations from the

U.S. and Canada is of no assistance, as they are non-signatories to the ECT.'°*

(b) Respondent’s Position

Respondent submits that, in determining whether the host State’s conduct is fair and equitable,
an investor’s legitimate and reasonable expectations are the “dominant” element. Respondent
also submits that the assessment of the reasonableness and legitimacy of an investor’s
expectations of fair and equitable treatment must be based on the state of the law of the host

State, its political and historical conditions, and any particular conditions of treatment the State

offered the investor at the time it made its investment. In support of these propositions,

Respondent cites Saluka and Duke Energy v. Ecuador.'°**

1499. Respondent also refers to the award in M.C.J. v. Ecuador to support the proposition that the
obligation to provide an investor with stable, equitable, favorable and transparent conditions
cannot be construed as an obligation to refrain from enforcing existing law.'’** Respondent
relies on Professor Dolzer’s view that “[t]he pre-investment legal order forms the framework
for the positive reach of the expectation which will be protected and also the scope of
considerations upon which the host state is entitled to rely when it defends [itself].”!°”

1500. Respondent refers to the awards in Lauder v. Czech Republic and Genin v. Estonia in support of
its contention that conduct cannot be in breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard if
authorities are only taking the actions necessary to enforce the their laws.'*** Respondent also
relies on the Genin v. Estonia award for the proposition that where a State’s actions are the
justified exercise of its power to enforce its laws, the procedural irregularities complained of by
investors must be very severe to amount to a violation of the relevant investment treaty.'°”

1501. Moreover, Respondent contends that the fair and equitable treatment standard in Article 10(1)
of the ECT—specifically with respect to establishing a denial of justice, or conduct that is
otherwise manifestly unfair or unreasonable—corresponds to an international law minimum
standard of treatment of foreign investment. This minimum standard, submits Respondent,
incorporates the customary international law minimum standard of treatment for alien property,
as well as treaty obligations of the host State, but excludes decisions by international

organizations, such as the ECtHR.!!

1502. According to Respondent, Claimants’ burden for showing a violation of the minimum standard
is “demanding”.'* Thus, some tribunals have equated the fair and equitable treatment
standard with the Neer standard, which for allegations of due process violations by a host
State’s courts would require a showing of outrage, bad faith, willful neglect of duty, or
“insufficiency of governmental action so far short of international standards that every
reasonable and impartial man would readily recognize its insufficiency”.'°*

1503. Thus, due process violations in one or more proceedings “do not by themselves establish a
treaty violation if the procedures are only part of the judicial process available to the
parties.”'** Citing AMTO v. Ukraine, Respondent argues that the assessment of the conduct of
national courts must include the availability of remedies in the host State’s legal system and
whether or not such remedies were exercised; and if they were exercised, whether they were

1965

exercised fully and wisely. In addition, in order to prove their claim for denial of justice,

Claimants must show a “clear and malicious misapplication of the law” based on the content of

judicial opinions themselves.'°°°

1504. With respect to the standard of non-discrimination, Respondent submits that Article 10(1) of
the ECT “only prohibits discrimination based on nationality.”'°"’ Accordingly, it argues that
discriminatory measures must have been “taken because of the foreign nationality of the

shareholders.”

1505. Part VII of the Table of Contents in Respondent’s Rejoinder provides a short list of the
conditions that, according to Respondent, Claimants’ claims must meet in order to show a
breach of Article 10(1) (in addition to showing that the conduct alleged to be in breach of
Article 10(1) is attributable to Respondent and is an exercise of puissance publique, as

discussed above in Chapter X.A):

(a) Claimants’ Position

1507. Claimants submit that Respondent violated its obligations under Article 10(1) of the ECT by
failing to accord Claimants’ investments fair and equitable treatment and by impairing

Claimants’ investments by discriminatory measures.

1508. In terms of fair and equitable treatment, Claimants contend that Respondent’s actions, both

individually and collectively, constitute breaches of the most basic requirements of procedural

propriety and due process, as well as a denial of justice.'*”! Claimants emphasize that their case

is not limited to one of “systematic denial of justice”, as Respondent maintains.'°”

Claimants also emphasize that, in considering whether Respondent violated the fair and

equitable treatment standard under Article 10(1) of the ECT, the Tribunal should not view each

1973

fact in isolation, but rather look at the totality of Respondent’s actions. Thus, Claimants

state that, while some of Respondent’s actions could and do, in and of themselves, constitute
breaches of Articles 10(1), their position is that “the totality of the Russian Federation’s actions

and their cumulative effect” constitute a violation of the fair and equitable treatment

standard,'°”

Claimants offer a list of specific actions taken by Respondent, or attributable to it, which, they

say, d ate that R dent t hed the fair and equitabl standard.

Firstly, Claimants contend that Respondent breached the fair and equitable treatment standard
by the conduct of “over 150 raids . . . in brutal conditions from July 4, 2003 to November 18,
2004, and the innumerable searches and seizures conducted by armed and masked officers at
Yukos’ headquarters, the premises of affiliates or entities related to Yukos, or the offices of

lawyers acting in Yukos-related cases, leaving neither a copy nor a simple list of the documents

391975

and items seized, in breach of even the most basic requirements of Russian law. Claimants

allege that these searches and seizures were part of the Russian Federation’s campaign to
destroy Yukos and had a major disruptive effect on the operations of Yukos, reducing the

company’s chances of survival in the face of the Russian Federation’s attacks (and, in

particular, “the accelerated pace in which tax debts were fabricated”).'"”° As for the “campaign
of harassment” on PwC, and subsequent raid, Claimants allege that it precipitated PwC’s

withdrawal of its certification of Yukos’ audits.'°””

1512. Secondly, Claimants contend that Respondent did not provide proper notice of administrative

actions to be taken by the State.'°”* In that regard, Claimants submit that the Tax Ministry, the
Russian courts and the bailiffs repeatedly failed to afford Yukos reasonable timeframes in
which to pay or challenge the alleged tax reassessments: just two days to voluntarily pay after
issuance of the 2000 Decision, and a single day to pay after issuance of each of the 2002 and
2003 Decisions. In addition, Claimants allege that Respondent did not wait for these short time
limits to expire before filing a petition for collection with the Moscow Arbitrazh Court, which

Claimants allege were swiftly “rubber-stamped” in favor of Respondent.'””

1513. Thirdly, Claimants submit that Respondent did not afford them the opportunity to be heard by

an impartial tribunal. Claimants contend that Respondent instead ensured that government-
friendly judges sanctioned the tax reassessments and that the three judges who failed to rule
against Yukos were removed, and their rulings later overturned. Yukos’ requests for interim
relief to suspend the effect of the tax reassessment decisions pending appeal on the merits were
also systematically rejected. Claimants further submit that hearings on these matters were set,
and appeals ruled upon, almost immediately, and that Yukos was not given real access to case

materials. '°*°

1514. Fourthly, Claimants assert that the sale of YNG was a sham auction, orchestrated by

Respondent under the pretext of satisfying Yukos’ alleged tax liability for the 2000 Decision;
an alleged liability that Claimants submit was fully paid prior to the auction date.'**' With only

YNG for a “bargain” price. Claimant also notes that Baikal was purchased by State-owned

Rosneft shortly following the auction, and that President Putin himself admitted Baikal was

used as a front company to shield the future owner — Rosneft — from legal claims.'°**

1515. Fifthly, Claimants assert that the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings against Yukos at the
behest of Rosneft, the biased conduct of those proceedings by Russian courts, and the sale of
Yukos’ remaining assets also violated due process requirements.'°**

1516. Claimants submit that the following actions taken by Respondent in breach of due process

amount to a denial of justice:

e the administration of justice by Russian courts with respect to all Yukos related matters did
not meet generally accepted international law standards of due process, impartiality and
legitimacy;'**°

e Russian courts were unduly hasty in their decision-making, refusing to provide Yukos with
sufficient time or adequate opportunity to review the evidence on which the tax

reassessment payment demands were based which eventually lead to its bankruptcy;'°** and

e the systematic removal of judges who ruled in Yukos’ favor and dismissal of Yukos’

challenges against judges who had previously ruled against it in tax proceedings.'*”

1517. In their discussion of denial of justice, Claimants invited the Tribunal to note the fact that
Yukos lost nearly all of its cases in 2000 against the tax authorities and the statistic put forward

by Mr. Konnov that the taxpayer in Russia wins in 75 percent of the cases.'**

1518. Moreover, Claimants argue that even if it purported to discuss denial of justice claims,
Respondent has actually failed to defend its conduct, limiting itself to misstating the standard

1989

applicable to a claim of denial of justice. According to Claimants, Respondent has

“concentrated its energies on urging the Arbitral Tribunal to impose a higher burden on

Claimants, for the facts of the Russian Federation’s conduct are devastating.”"°” Claimants
assert that Respondent’s attempts to elevate the applicable threshold fail because Respondent’s

conduct was under any plausible interp ion of the dard: ined in

Article 10(1) of the ECT."

. Claimants also contend that Respondent’s actions were arbitrary, unreasonable,

1992

disproportionate, and abusive, ~~ in their reference to the following actions of Respondent:

e Respondent’s unrelenting campaign of coercion, harassment, and intimidation against

Yukos and related persons and entities;'””?

e the imposition of arbitrarily and disproportionately large payment demands by Respondent

under the guise of tax reassessments, enforced within short time periods and accompanied

by arbitrary freezing of assets orders;'°”* and

e Respondent’s unreasonable and arbitrary rejection of Yukos’ proposals to settle or resolve

the alleged tax claims.'**
Claimants submit that Respondent failed to ensure a predictable and stable legal and business

framework for the Claimants’ investments.'°° They refer as examples to:

e Respondent’s reversal of its previous acceptance of Yukos’ tax optimization structure as

legal;
e Respondent’s reversal of its approval of the Sibneft merger; and

Memorial §¥] 644-95. Claimants submit that while Article 10(1) of the ECT only expressly prohibits “unreasonable or

measures”, confirms that “ ” measures have the same meaning as “arbitrary”
conduct, and similarly violate the fair and equitable treatment standard (Jbid. $9 665-67, citing EDF (Services)

1521. In support of their contention that Respondent discriminated against Claimants’ investments,

Claimants rely on the following facts:

e Respondent treated Yukos in a significantly different way from other comparable Russian

oil companies;

e Respondent treated YNG differently before and after its acquisition by Rosneft; and

e Respondent ensured differential treatment between creditors related to Yukos or Yukos’

shareholders, and State or State-related creditors in the Yukos bankruptcy proceedings.

1522. In their Reply, Claimants assert that in its Counter-Memorial Respondent does not address

Claimants’ claims of discrimination under Article 10(1) of the ECT, except in its assertion that

Claimants’ allegations with respect to the Yukos-Sibneft demerger do not involve

discrimination based on nationality.'°* Claimants also argue that Respondent improperly
invokes its domestic law in defense of its breaches of international law.'”””

1523. Also in their Reply, Claimants argue that Respondent’s only defense against the bulk of

Claimants’ claims under Article 10(1) is to invoke Article 21(1) ECT. According to Claimants,
in providing no other defense, Respondent has conceded that its conduct breached Article

10(1). Claimants view Respondent’s defense as resting

squarely on the theory that Article 21(1) . . . operates as a license to ECT signatories to
freely violate their treaty obligations under Article 10(1) . . . so long as they create the
appearance that their actions have some connection, however remote and indirect, to

taxation.”

 

(b) Respondent’s Position

1524. Respondent’s main position is that Claimants have failed to establish any violation of

Article 10(1) of the ECT.

1525. In particular, Respondent submits that (a) Claimants have failed to establish that conduct,

which is attributable to Respondent and an exercise of its sovereign power, proximately caused

the loss of Claimants’ investment;?"' (b) Claimants have failed to establish that the measures
2002

they challenge interfered with Claimants’ legitimate expectations; and (c) the measures

relating to the imposition and enforcement of taxes were well within the range of a State’s

generally accepted regulatory powers.”

1526. Respondent also argues that Claimants have failed to show that the challenged measures

2008 Ty

constitute a denial of justice or are otherwise manifestly unfair or unreasonable.
particular, Respondent argues that Claimants have failed to establish that the Moscow and
Chukotka courts “clearly and maliciously” misapplied Russian law when granting the claims of

Gemini Holdings and Nimegian Trading in the context of the Yukos-Sibneft merger.”

1527. Respondent also asserts that the challenged measures were not discriminatory."

ARTICLE 13 OF THE ECT

1. Introduction

1528. Article 13(1) of the ECT provides, in relevant part:

2001

2002

2003

Article 13
EXPROPRIATION

(1) Investments of Investors of a Contracting Party in the Area of any other Contracting
Party shall not be nationalized, expropriated or subjected to a measure or measures
having effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation (hereinafter referred to
as “Expropriation”) except where such Expropriation is:

(a) fora purpose which is in the public interest;
(b) not discriminatory;
(c) carried out under due process of law; and

(d) accompanied by the payment of prompt, adequate and effective
compensation.

Such compensation shall amount to the fair market value of the Investment
expropriated at the time immediately before the Expropriation or impending

Respondent’s Post-Hearing Brief §] 191-99. Particulars of Respondent’s submission are summarized in the next
chapter, which deals with Article 13 of the ECT.

Counter-Memorial § 1545.
Ibid. 41573.
See following chapter on Article 13 ECT.

Expropriation became known in such a way as to affect the value of the Investment
(hereinafter referred to as the “Valuation Date”).

Such fair market value shall at the request of the Investor be expressed in a Freely
Convertible Currency on the basis of the market rate of exchange existing for that
currency on the Valuation Date. Compensation shall also include interest at a
commercial rate established on a market basis from the date of Expropriation until
the date of payment.

1529. The Parties analyze Article 13 in two steps, first by addressing what constitutes expropriation

or “measures having effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation,” and then by
discussing what constitutes a legal expropriation, i.e., an expropriation conducted in accordance
with the four conditions set out in Article 13(1): that the expropriation be (a) in the public
interest; (b) not discriminatory; (c) carried out under due process of law; and (d) accompanied
by the payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation. The Tribunal will summarize
first the Parties’ principal arguments regarding the legal standards of Article 13 and will then

review the facts of the present case in the light of these standards.

2. Applicable Legal Standards under Article 13 of the ECT

(a) Claimants’ Position

1530. Claimants note that Article 13(1) of the ECT deals with nationalization and expropriation, as

well as other equivalent measures. Claimants submit that such equivalent measures include
“covert or incidental interference with the use of property which has the effect of depriving the
owner... of the use or reasonably-to-be-expected economic benefit of property even if not

necessarily to the obvious benefit of the host State.””°”

1531. Claimants submit that the standard for expropriation is objective and that while the showing of

intent to expropriate may evidence a measure to be expropriatory, it is not a requirement of

expropriation."

1532. Claimants emphasize that, in considering whether Respondent expropriated Claimants’

2008

investment within the meaning of Article 13(1), the Tribunal should look at the totality of

Respondent’s actions and not at each fact in isolation. The question is not, Claimants

submit, whether each of Respondent’s individual actions was lawful under Russian law, or was

no different than the practice in other jurisdictions, but whether the totality of Respondent’s

conduct was lawful under international law.7""”

1533. Claimants argue that, contrary to Respondent’s assertion, the standard for expropriation is not

2011

limited to the investor’s legitimate expectations. Respondent’s reference in this regard to

the treaty practice of various States is unavailing, as whether or not other treaties refer to
legitimate expectations as a criterion to establish expropriation is irrelevant to the interpretation

of the ECT."

1534. With regard to the requirement that expropriation be in the public interest, Claimants submit

that international tribunals have emphasized that expropriation must have occurred for a “bona

fide public purpose””*"? and not for “purely extraneous political reasons,”””"* “amusement and

1535. Claimants challenge Respondent’s assertion that States should be afforded a particularly wide

margin of discretion when seeking to collect taxes. According to Claimants, a State alleging
that it has legitimately exercised its powers of taxation is not impervious to scrutiny under
international law;70'8 “taxation, like the exercise of any other sovereign power, can be

expropriatory.””""”

1536. With regard to non-discrimination, Claimants assert that it is defined as the singling out of a

person or group of people without a reasonable basis. Thus, Claimants submit, a finding of
“unjustified differential treatment, whether in law or in fact,” has been regarded as

discriminatory.*””°

Claimants quote a commentary that the “expropriation of an investment
because of animosity between the host-state officials and the investor or in retaliation for
lawful, but politically unpopular, conduct of the investment would violate the non-
discrimination condition.”! Claimants add that, as in the case of Article 10(1) of the ECT,
discrimination under Article 13(1) refers not only to nationality-based discrimination, but to

other types of unjustified discriminatory treatment as well.”

1537. Claimants also maintain that, by stating that an expropriation must be “carried out under due

process of law,” the ECT, unlike some other investment treaties, requires that expropriations

2023

conform not only to local, but also international standards of due process. Claimants argue

that due process “contains both substantive and procedural elements”;”™ implies that

“whenever a State seizes property, the measures taken must be free from arbitrariness” and that
the “administrative or judicial machinery used or available must correspond at least to the

992025

minimum standard required by international law; and requires that the investor must be

1538. Finally, Claimants submit that the taking of property without compensation engages the

international responsibility of States, regardless of the purpose of the taking.””””

(b) Respondent’s Position

1539. Respondent submits that the standard for expropriation under Article 13 of the ECT must not be

conflated with the standard for fair and equitable treatment under Article 10(1), as otherwise
the taxation carve-out of Article 21, pursuant to which a tribunal may lack jurisdiction over fair
and equitable treatment claims, while retaining jurisdiction over claims of expropriation, would

. 2
be rendered meaningless.”

1540. Respondent also contends that the absence of one or more of the four requirements of

Article 13(1) (i.e., public purpose, non-discrimination, due process and compensation) “is not

in itself indicative of expropriation.”""”"

1541. Respondent submits that, to show expropriation or equivalent measures under Article 13(1),

Claimants must (in addition to showing that the challenged actions are attributable to
Respondent and constitute an exercise of puissance publique), demonstrate firstly that the
challenged measures “proximately” caused a total or substantial deprivation of their

investment;”” and secondly that they interfered with their legitimate expectations."

1542. The importance of the causal link between the challenged measures and the investors’

Argentina.” By applying the standard resulting from these precedents to the present case,
Respondent submits that Claimants must prove that the loss of their shares was the “only
possible, unavoidable consequence of conduct attributable to Respondent, conduct that is iwre
imperii and not excluded under Article 21 ECT. Therefore, Claimants cannot base a claim
for expropriation on damages suffered as a result of their own conduct or the conduct of their

. 3.
investment.”

1543. As regards investors’ legitimate expectations, Respondent submits that they are a “central

element of claims” under Article 13(1) of the ECT.° Respondent argues that this is in
accordance with the treaty practice of both ECT and non-ECT Contracting Parties, which, in

turn, reflects customary international law.?° Respondent then submits that:

[P]roperty rights have inherent limitations. The host State has the power to accept and
define the rights acquired by an investor at the time of the making of the investment. And
a foreign investor acquires rights in an investment, subject to the existing regulatory
framework. So absent a specific commitment from the host State to the investor, an
expropriation may occur only where the State measure does not reflect a pre-existing
lawful limitation inherent in private property.”

1544. Thus, argues Respondent, without a specific commitment from the host State, an investor has

no right or legitimate expectation to non-enforcement or exemption from taxes and associated

legitimate expectations cannot be based on host State commitments when the investor has

expectations be premised on illegal conduct.”

Respondent also submits that legitimate
expectations include an expectation of “the evolution of the regulatory regime, including
through interpretation or application of the law, even if without precedent, and changes through

legislative amendment.”

1545. In addition, Respondent submits that a distinction must be made between expropriatory

measures that breach a host State’s obligations under the ECT and the legitimate exercise of a

' Factors

State’s regulatory power, including for the imposition and enforcement of taxes.”™
which distinguish one from the other include the compatibility of the measures with
international and comparative standards, as well as their compatibility with national law and
review by domestic courts.?“? Applying the latter criterion, Respondent submits that States
cannot usually incur international responsibility through the actions of their tax authorities so
long as domestic courts are available to resolve disputes between the tax authorities and

taxpayers."

1546. Thus, in the present case, to establish a violation of Article 13(1) of the ECT, Claimants must

2039

demonstrate that the decisions of the Russian courts that upheld the challenged taxation
measures, as well as the decisions issued in the context of Yukos’ bankruptcy, are themselves

“ . A oo we
‘measures having effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation.”?™*

Accordingly,
Respondent says, Claimants must demonstrate that these decisions were the result of a systemic
failure of the Russian judicial system or, at a minimum, are manifestly improper, abusive,
extraordinarily excessive or arbitrary, in manifest violation of Russian law, and in violation of
international and comparative standards, so as to place them outside Russia’s wide margin of

2045

discretion in taxation matters. Respondent emphasizes that this Tribunal cannot sit as an

appellate court reviewing the decisions of the Russian courts.

1547. Finally, Respondent submits that Claimants must establish a violation of the requirements in

Article 13(1) of the ECT2™° Regarding the non-discrimination requirement, Respondent
submits that Article 13(1) calls for proof that similar cases were, without reasonable
justification, treated differently on the basis of nationality. Accordingly, Claimants must allege

differential treatment based on foreign ownership.“™”

3. Did Respondent’s Actions Constitute Expropriation (or “Measures Having Effect
Equivalent to Nationalization or Expropriation”) within the Meaning of
Article 13(1) of the ECT?

(a) Claimants’ Position

1548. According to Claimants, Respondent completely and totally deprived Claimants of their

through the harassment of executive officers, employees and other related persons,

“thereby engineering the circumstance of non-payment”;

(d) selling YNG in a sham auction that allowed State-owned company Rosneft to

acquire Yukos’ “crown jewel” for an “absurdly low price”;?”* and

(e) _ initiating and controlling the Yukos bankruptcy so as to obtain, either directly or
through State-owned Rosneft, Yukos’ main production assets, as well as almost all

2084

of the bankruptcy proceeds.

1550. Claimants submit that the liquidation of Yukos on 21 November 2007 “marked the final act in

the expropriation of Yukos.”°

1551. Finally, Claimants argue that, even viewed individually, the harassment campaign against

Yukos and its associates, the sale of YNG and the bankruptcy of Yukos each constitute an act

of expropriation.?°*°

(b) Respondent’s Position

1552. Respondent submits that Claimants have failed to establish that any of the challenged measures

constitute expropriation or “measures having effect equivalent to nationalization or

expropriation” within the meaning of Article 13(1) of the ECT.

1553. Firstly, Respondent maintains that Claimants have failed to establish that conduct that is

2082

Claimants’ total or substantial deprivation of their investment.”*’ Respondent argues that the
actions that directly caused Yukos’ liquidation and the ensuing loss of Claimants’ Yukos
shares—the bankruptcy petition and the decision to liquidate Yukos—are either not attributable

to Respondent, or not an exercise of its sovereign power.* The Moscow Arbitrazh Court’s

acceptance of the bankruptcy petitions and ratification of the creditors’ decision to liquidate
Yukos does not change this conclusion, as loss resulting from a court’s enforcement of legal
limitations inherent in private property is not compensable under Article 13 of the ECT,

irrespective of whether the court proceedings were instituted by a State organ.”””

1554. According to Respondent, it is therefore not responsible for the loss of Claimants’ investment

unless “Claimants can prove that Respondent is responsible for Yukos’ financial situation that
led to its liquidation.” Yet, argues Respondent, Yukos’ financial situation was actually “the
result of Claimants’ and their owners’ decision to siphon off billions of dollars from Yukos and
its subsidiaries to further their own financial interests, at the expense of Yukos’ creditors and

minority shareholders.”?""'

1555. Respondent emphasizes that Claimants could have avoided Yukos’ insolvency, which, in

Respondent’s view, led to Yukos’ bankruptcy and eventual liquidation, by paying the taxes
assessed against it for years 2000-2003 in the first quarter of 2004; filing amended VAT and
other tax returns; and petitioning for a refund of any amounts paid that it believed not to be

legally due.

1556. As for the criminal proceedings against Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev and certain Yukos

officials, as well as the searches, seizures and arrests carried out in support of those
proceedings, Respondent submits that these events did not cause Yukos’ liquidation.

A ding to Respond the evidence blishes that these did not impair Yukos’
operations."

1557. Respondent further contends that Claimants have failed to establish that the measures they

challenge interfered with Claimants’ legitimate expectations."

1558. With regard to the tax assessments, Respondent argues that Claimants had no “legitimate

Yukos’ tax scheme.””® In fact, prior to the 2000 Tax Audit Report, according to Respondent,

Yukos sought, but was unable to obtain, a legal opinion supporting the legality of its tax
scheme."

1559. In addition, Respondent submits that Claimants had no legitimate expectation that Yukos would
not be held liable for the taxes assessed. According to Respondent, the attribution for tax
purposes of revenues nominally earned by sham entities to a company that sought to evade
taxes was a proper application of legal doctrines that were well-settled in Russia, and are
employed by many other States.””* Yukos itself, argues Respondent, was well aware that its
tax schemes, if discovered or disclosed, would result in substantial tax liabilities.?°°

1560. Respondent also argues that the Russian legislation on which the enforcement measures
(including the asset freezes, fines, default interest, enforcement fees and the forced sales of
Yukos’ assets) were based was already extant in the 1990s. These enforcement measures were
thus foreseeable consequences of Yukos’ failure to pay.””””

1561. Respondent then submits that the measures taken for the imposition and enforcement of taxes
were well within the range of a State’s generally accepted regulatory powers.”"”' This is shown
by the fact that these measures were in conformity with Russian law and were upheld by
national courts, and were in accordance with international and comparable standards and
practices of other countries.”

1562. According to Respondent, Claimants have failed to show that the Russian courts contributed to

any “measures having effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation” through any of the

1563. Finally, Respondent submits that the ECtHR unanimously determined that the challenged tax

assessments were a legitimate exercise of Respondent’s regulatory powers.”°””

According to
Respondent, given that the vast majority of the ECT Contracting States (including the Russian
Federation, the United Kingdom, and Cyprus) are also ECHR Contracting States and that the
ECHR enshrines the common ordre public of the European States in terms of democracy and
the rule of law, the “ECtHR’s interpretation and application of the ECHR to the measures at
issue, through a final and binding judgment, must be taken into account under Article 31(3)(c)
VCLT in assessing whether they are within the bounds of generally recognized regulatory

powers.”20"8

4, If Respondent’s Actions Constitute Expropriation, Has Respondent Met the
Criteria for a Lawful Expropriation under Article 13(1) of the ECT?

(a) Claimants’ Position

1564. Claimants submit that Respondent did not meet any of the four requirements under Article

13(1) of the ECT for a lawful expropriation (i.e., public interest, non-discrimination, due

2079
process and adequate compensation).””

1565. According to Claimants, the expropriation of Claimants’ investment was not in the public

Claimants invoke the finding of the
RosInvestCo tribunal that the Russian Federation’s actions were “linked to the strategic
objective to return assets to the control of the Russian State and to an effort to suppress a
political opponent.”"*' According to Claimants, Respondent’s justification that it only sought

to enforce its laws is without any basis.”

1566. Claimants also submit that the expropriation of their investments was discriminatory and was

not carried out under due process of law.2 Nor was the expropriation accompanied by
compensation, let alone “prompt, adequate and effective compensation.”?"*

1567. Claimants conclude that the Russian Federation’s actions are in breach of Article 13(1) and

constitute an internationally wrongful act for which Respondent is responsible.””**

(b) Respondent’s Position

1568. Even if Claimants could establish expropriation, which Respondent contends they cannot,

Respondent maintains that the requirements in Article 13(1) of the ECT have not been

breached.

1569. Respondent submits that no lack of public interest has been established.*° Respondent states

1570. Respondent also contends that Claimants have failed to establish discrimination under
Article 13(1)(b) of the ECT because Claimants do not allege any discrimination based on
foreign ownership or residence, which Respondent contends is the intended scope of the term
“discriminatory” in this provision.“ Respondent submits that selective tax enforcement is not

discriminatory within the meaning of Article 13(1)(b) of the ECT.

1571. According to Respondent, Yukos “was a visible and logical candidate for tax assessments,
penalties, and enforcement actions” as its abuses of the low-tax region policy were particularly
egregious and the amounts of taxes it evaded unprecedented.” Other Russian oil companies,
argues Respondent, cannot be compared. Some companies, such as Rosneft, Tatneft and
Surgutneftegaz did not resort to tax minimization schemes involving the use of low-tax

2091

regions. While some other companies, such as Lukoil, did use such schemes, they

abandoned them much earlier than Yukos.””” Other companies, which continued to rely on the
low-tax regions program, for example Sibneft, satisfied the “proportionality of investments”

2093

requirement of the Russian anti-avoidance rules. Finally, tax arrears, default interest and

fines were in fact assessed against some companies, including TNK-BP, Sibneft and Lukoil.?*
1572. Respondent also submits that Claimants have failed to establish due process violations
cognizable under Article 13(1)(c) of the ECT. For this assertion, Respondent relies on its own
articulation of the requisite legal standard, namely that “administrative authorities cannot be
faulted for conduct upheld by their own courts unless the court system is disavowed at the
international level,” which Respondent argues is not the case here.”””*
1573. Respondent contends that in the present case most of the due process violations raised by
Claimants have been reviewed by Russian courts and dismissed on the merits, while the due

process arguments raised by Claimants for the first time in this arbitration are “specious.””"”*

1574. Respondent specifically submits that the pace of the court proceedings that led to decisions

upholding the Tax Ministry’s tax demands against Yukos was in conformity with Russian
procedural law and practice. Respondent notes that, pursuant to Article 215(1) of the Arbitrazh
Procedure Code, first instance judgments in tax disputes must be rendered no later than two

2097

months after institution of the court proceedings. Respondent denies that Yukos was not

provided with sufficient time to review documents during the collection proceedings pertaining

removal of Judge Cheburashkina and the recusal of Judge Mikhailova were proper, as there was
cause to doubt the impartiality of these two judges.’ Finally, Respondent argues that Yukos’
challenges to Judges Korotenko and Dzuba (who were charged with reviewing Yukos’
challenges to the 2001 Decision and 2002 Decision, respectively) on the ground that they had
previously been involved in other proceedings for the collection of taxes against Yukos, were
soundly rejected, as Yukos was not able to point to any rule of Russian law that would prevent

a judge from hearing similar or related cases.”'"°

TRIBUNAL’S DECISION ON BREACH OF THE ECT

1575. As set out in Section X.C.2 above, the Parties are in sharp disagreement about the place and

2100

content of the legitimate expectations that Yukos had or could have had in devising and
implementing its tax avoidance arrangements. Claimants maintain, as Mr. Dubov testified, that
the most senior officials of the Russian Federation were informed of and approved Yukos’
plans in respect of low-tax jurisdictions. Claimants point to the legislation of those
jurisdictions which, while requiring a specified level of local investment by a trading company,
for the most part did not refer to or require the presence of trading company personnel in the
low-tax jurisdiction or specify that the activities of the trading company take place in that
jurisdiction. Respondent stresses that virtually all the significant work of the trading companies
was done not in the low-tax jurisdictions by a small number of low-level and uninformed
functionaries but in and by Yukos’ Moscow offices, facts that led two panels of the ECtHR to

conclude that the trading companies were a “sham”. Respondent emphasizes that Yukos never

secured and apparently was unable to secure a legal opinion upholding the lawfulness of its tax

planning arrangements and operations.

1576. The Tribunal accepts that federal legislation and the legislation of the low-tax jurisdictions did

not provide, or at any rate, uniformly provide, that the trading companies actually conduct their
trading operations in the territory of the low-tax jurisdictions. Such a provision in any event
would have been increasingly deprived of its force in view of the advent of electronic
communications. Nevertheless there are indications in the record that Yukos itself had doubts,
or at least apprehensions, about the legality of aspects of its modus operandi. Internal Yukos
communications noted above at paragraph 491 so suggest, as may the unwillingness of
Mr. Khodorkovsky to sign papers required for SEC registration. Yukos was able to advance no
convincing explanation for the “Lesnoy shuffle”, which may well have been carried out to
frustrate investigation of perceived tax improprieties. While both PwC (Yukos’ tax
consultants) and Mr. Pepeliaev (Yukos’ tax lawyer) opined in early January 2004, after the
initial tax assessment was issued, that the tax assessment against Yukos itself was not
well-founded," the absence of a prior legal opinion supporting the propriety of Yukos’
arrangements in the low-tax jurisdictions is striking and may be suggestive. So also is the
inability of Yukos to explain immense payments to former Yukos employees and its inability to
sustain the claim that certain of its primary trading companies (the BBS companies) were not
controlled by it. There is also the issue of the questionable use by Claimants of the

Cyprus-Russia DTA, which the Tribunal addresses in Chapter X.E on contributory fault.

1577. The Tribunal has not overlooked or discounted the foregoing and other weaknesses in the

contentions of Claimants. But are they sufficient to support what the Tribunal understands to
be a central contention of Respondent, namely, that Claimants should have expected that the
Russian Federation would react as it did to what it claims were violations of Russian tax law

and practice as its courts had interpreted that law and practice to be?

1578. In the view of the Tribunal, the expectations of Claimants may have been, and certainly should

2101

have been, that Yukos’ tax avoidance operations risked adverse reaction from Russian

authorities. It is common ground between the Parties that Yukos and its competitors viewed

positions taken by the tax authorities on issues of tax liability to be exigent, erratic and
unpredictable. The Tribunal however is unable to accept that the expectations of Yukos should
have included the extremity of the actions which in the event were imposed upon it. Not only
did Mikhail Khodorkovsky not appear to expect to be arrested even after the arrest of Platon
Lebedev, he and his colleagues surely could not have been expected to anticipate the rationale
and immensity of the tax assessments and fines. They could not have been expected to
anticipate that their legal counsel would labor under the disabilities imposed upon them. They
could not have been expected to anticipate the sale of YNG for so low a price under such
questionable circumstances. They could not have been expected to anticipate that more than
thirteen billion dollars in unpaid taxes and fines would be imposed on Yukos for unpaid VAT
on oil exports when that oil had in fact been exported. They could not have been expected to

anticipate that they risked the evisceration of their investments and the destruction of Yukos.

1579. The Tribunal has earlier concluded that “the primary objective of the Russian Federation was

992102

not to collect taxes but rather to bankrupt Yukos and appropriate its valuable assets. For
the reasons that emerge in Part VIII, if the true objective were no more than tax collection,
Yukos, its officers and employees, and its properties and facilities, would not have been treated,
and mistreated, as in fact they were. Among the many incidents in this train of mistreatment
that are within the remit of this Tribunal, two stand out: finding Yukos liable for the payment
of more than 13 billion dollars in VAT in respect of oil that had been exported by the trading
companies and should have been free of VAT and free of fines in respect of VAT; and the
auction of YNG at a price that was far less than its value. But for these actions, for which the
Russian Federation for reasons set out above and in preceding chapters was responsible, Yukos
would have been able to pay the tax claims of the Russian Federation justified or not; it would
not have been bankrupted and liquidated (unless the Russian Federation were intent on its
liquidation and found still additional grounds for achieving that end, as the second criminal trial

of Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev indeed suggests).

1580. Respondent has not explicitly expropriated Yukos or the holdings of its shareholders, but the

2102

measures that Respondent has taken in respect of Yukos, set forth in detail in Part VIII, in the
view of the Tribunal have had an effect “equivalent to nationalization or expropriation”. The

four conditions specified in Article 13 (1) of the ECT do not qualify that conclusion.

See paragraph 756 above.

- 497 -

1581.

1582.

1583.

1584.

1585.

As to condition (a), whether the destruction of Russia’s leading oil company and largest
taxpayer was in the public interest is profoundly questionable. It was in the interest of the
largest State-owned oil company, Rosneft, which took over the principal assets of Yukos
virtually cost-free, but that is not the same as saying that it was in the public interest of the

economy, polity and population of the Russian Federation.

As to condition (b), the treatment of Yukos and the appropriation of its assets by Rosneft (and
to a much lesser extent, another State-owned corporation, Gazprom), when compared to the
treatment of other Russian oil companies that also took advantage of investments in low-tax
jurisdictions, may well have been discriminatory, a question that was inconclusively argued

between the Parties and need not be and has not been decided by this Tribunal.

As to condition (c), Yukos was subjected to processes of law, but the Tribunal does not accept
that the effective expropriation of Yukos was “carried out under due process of law” for
multiple reasons set out above, notably in Section VIII.C.3. The harsh treatment accorded to
Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev remotely jailed and caged in court, the mistreatment of
counsel of Yukos and the difficulties counsel encountered in reading the record and conferring
with Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev, the very pace of the legal proceedings, do not
comport with the due process of law. Rather the Russian court proceedings, and most
egregiously, the second trial and second sentencing of Messrs. Khodorkovsky and Lebedev on
the creative legal theory of their theft of Yukos’ oil production, indicate that Russian courts
bent to the will of Russian executive authorities to bankrupt Yukos, assign its assets to a State-

controlled company, and incarcerate a man who gave signs of becoming a political competitor.

As to condition (d), what in any event is incontestable is Respondent’s failure to meet its
prescription, because the effective expropriation of Yukos was not “accompanied by the
payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation”, or, in point of fact, any
compensation whatsoever. In order for the Russian Federation to be found in breach of its
treaty obligations under Article 13 of the ECT, the foregoing violations of the conditions of

Article 13 more than suffice.

It follows that Respondent stands in breach of its treaty obligations under Article 13 of the
ECT. Accordingly Respondent’s liability under international law for breach of treaty is
established. The Tribunal reaches this conclusion based on its consideration of the totality of

the extensive evidence before it. Having found Respondent liable under international law for

= 498 -

breach of Article 13 of the ECT, the Tribunal does not need to consider whether Respondent’s

actions are also in breach of Article 10 of the Treaty.

1586. The establishment of liability under international law is at the heart of its doctrine and

jurisprudence. The Statute of the PCIJ, in Article 36(2), referred to “(c) the existence of any
fact which, if established, would constitute a breach of an international obligation; (d) the
nature or extent of the reparation to be made for the breach of an international obligation”. The

identical provision is found in Article 36(2) of the Statute of the ICJ.

1587. The PCIJ held in the Factory at Chorzow case that:

It is a principle of international law that the breach of an engagement involves an
obligation to make reparation in an adequate form. Reparation therefore is the
indispensable complement of a failure to apply a convention and there is no necessity for

this to be stated in the convention itself.”

1588. In a subsequent phase of the Factory at Chorzéw case, the Court specified the content of the

obligation of reparation in the following oft-quoted terms:

The essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act—a principle which
seems to be established by international practice and in particular by the decisions of
arbitral tribunals—is that reparation must, so far as possible, wipe out all the consequences
of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed
if that act had not been committed. Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment
of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind would bear; the award, if
need be, of damages for the loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution in
kind or payment in place of it—such are the principles which should serve to determine the
amount of compensation due for an act contrary to international law."

1589. The ILC Articles on State Responsibility provide, in Article 31, an article entitled “Reparation”,

that “[t]he responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused
by the internationally wrongful act.” In support of this conclusion the Articles quote the

foregoing holdings in the Factory at Chorzéw case.’'*

1590. Article 36 of the Articles, entitled “Compensation”, provides that:

1. The State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to
compensate for the damage caused thereby . .. .

The commentary to the Articles states that:

the function of compensation is to address the actual losses incurred as a result of the
internationally wrongful act. Compensation corresponds to the financially assessable
damage suffered... it is not concerned to punish... nor does compensation have an
expressive or exemplary character.”?!°°

1591. Article 13 of the ECT specifies, in the event of expropriation, that “compensation shall amount

to the fair market value of the Investment expropriated at the time immediately before the

Expropriation . . . the Valuation Date.”

1592. Article 39 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, entitled “Contribution to the injury,”

provides that “[iJn the determination of reparation, account shall be taken of the contribution to
the injury by wilful or negligent action or omission of the injured . . . entity in relation to whom
reparation is sought.” The ILC’s commentary to the Articles refers to notions of “contributory

negligence” and “comparative fault”.”""”

1593. The Tribunal will assess damages in the light of the foregoing accepted principles of

international law.

CONTRIBUTORY FAULT

1. Introduction

1594. The Tribunal now has to determine whether the damages caused to Claimants by the wrongful

acts of Respondent should be reduced because, as Respondent argues, “Claimants may not

recover from the Russian Federation the fruits of their own wrongdoing.””!"*

1595. In support of its submission, Respondent invokes mainly the legal principle of contributory

2106

2107

2108

fault. In its Closing Statement, Respondent argued that Claimants failed to establish that their
loss was caused by the Russian Federation’s actions in violation of its obligations under the

ECT, notably by failing to account for the effects of Claimants’ own actions and of Yukos’

2109

actions. It argued*'"® that Claimants ignored Article 39 of the ILC Articles on State

Responsibility, which provides:”'!!
Article 39. Contribution to the injury

In the determination of reparation, account shall be taken of the contribution to the injury
by willful or negligent action or omission of the injured State or any person or entity in
relation to whom reparation is sought.

1596. Extracts of the ILC’s Commentary to Article 39 are pertinent, including the following:*!"”

Article 39 deals with the situation where damage has been caused by an internationally
wrongful act of a State, which is accordingly responsible for the damage in accordance
with Articles 1 and 28, but where the injured State, or the individual victim of the breach,
has materially contributed to the damage by some willful or negligent act or omission.

[emphasis added]

1597. The Tribunal also refers to Article 31 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility , which states:

Article 31. Reparation

1. The responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused
by the internationally wrongful act.

2. Injury includes any damage, whether material or moral, caused by the internationally
wrongful act of a State.

1598. The following extract from the ILC’s Commentary to Article 31 is also noted:*!?

It is true that cases can occur where an identifiable element of injury can properly be
allocated to one of several concurrently operating causes alone. But unless some part of the
injury can be shown to be severable in causal terms from that attributed to the responsible
State, the latter is held responsible for all the consequences, not being too remote, of its
wrongful conduct.

[emphasis added]

1599. The Tribunal must therefore decide, on the basis of the totality of the evidence before it,
whether there is a sufficient causal link between any willful or negligent act or omission of the
Claimants (or of Yukos, which they controlled) and the loss Claimants ultimately suffered at

the hands of the Russian Federation through the destruction of Yukos.

1600. The Tribunal notes that it is not any contribution by the injured party to the damage which it

1601.

has suffered which will trigger a finding of contributory fault. The contribution must be
material and significant. In this regard, the Tribunal has a wide margin of discretion in

apportioning fault.

2. Contributory Fault as Applied in Other Cases

Before it proceeds with its analysis of the potential contributory fault of Claimants (and Yukos)
in the present case which may have contributed to the injury caused to them by the
internationally wrongful act of the Russian Federation, the Tribunal has reviewed decisions of

investor-state tribunals which have addressed the principle of contributory fault.

1602. This review leads the Tribunal to three conclusions which will inform its analysis.

1603. Firstly, the legal concept of contributory fault must not be confused with the investor’s duty to

mitigate its losses. There are cases where the claimant’s damages were reduced because the
tribunal found that it failed to take some reasonable steps to minimize its losses. In such cases,

“the injured party must be held responsible for its own contribution to the loss.””'"*

1604. Secondly, there are cases where the contributory fault of the investor, while it may have

increased the loss which it sustained, was unrelated to the wrongdoing of the State.''> The
fault of the investor in those cases contributed to the losses which flowed from the wrongful act

of the State.

1605. Finally, the Tribunal identified certain decisions where the tribunals found that the victim

contributed to the State’s wrongful conduct.'!® The contributory fault of the investor in those

cases provoked the wrongful conduct of the State.

1606. While there is no doctrine of precedent stricto sensu in international arbitration, the Tribunal

ana

2116

has found these decisions of assistance in its analysis.

3. Tribunal’s Analysis

In Chapter IX.A above, the Tribunal reviewed some 28 instances of alleged “illegal and bad
faith conduct” by Claimants or “attributable to the Claimants”, which Respondent argues have
contributed to Yukos’ demise or should, in any event, prevent Claimants from recovering
damages from the Russian Federation. For the reasons set out in that chapter, the Tribunal has
already concluded that most of these “actions or omissions” cannot be considered as having

materially contributed to Yukos’ demise.

There are, however, four remaining instances of alleged willful or negligent conduct by
Claimants and/or Yukos which, the Tribunal agrees, must be considered as potentially
constituting fault that may have contributed to the destruction of Yukos, for which the Tribunal

has found Respondent responsible. These four instances are:
i) Yukos’ conduct in some of the low-tax regions;
ii) Yukos’ use of the Cyprus-Russia DTA;

iii) Yukos’ conduct in connection with the YNG auction, notably the procuring of a
Temporary Restraining Order by a Texas court and the published threat of a “lifetime

of litigation”; and

iv) Yukos’ conduct in connection with its bankruptcy, notably the non-payment of the

A Loan.

The Tribunal will now review these four instances and seek to determine whether any one of
them qualifies as contributory fault as that legal principle has been interpreted in the decisions

which it has reviewed earlier.

(a) Conduct of Yukos in Some of the Low-Tax Regions

At the outset of its review, the Tribunal needs to recall that the central, indeed the only, focus of
its remit with respect to the tax optimization schemes in the ZATOs and other low tax regions
of Russia was the series of arrangements implemented by one Russian oil company, Yukos.
These arrangements have been documented by hundreds of exhibits which the Tribunal has

considered and analyzed in Chapters VIII.A and VIII.B of the present Award.

- 503 -

1611. While there is ample evidence in the record that nearly all Russian oil companies also availed

21"7 there is no

themselves of such tax optimization arrangements which were permitted by law,
evidence that the operations of those other oil companies, in any respect, breached the
legislation and abused the low tax regimes as the Tribunal has found Yukos did through the
sham-like nature of some elements of its operations in at least some of the low-tax regions

notably in the ZATOs of Lesnoy and Trekhgorny.

1612. The Tribunal also recalls its further findings, in Chapters VIII.A and VIII.B above, that this
abuse by Yukos in some of the low-tax regions occurred prior to the confrontation between
President Putin and Mr. Khodorkovsky in February 2003. At the February 2003 meeting,
President Putin said to Mr. Khodorkovsky that, henceforth, he would no longer receive any
protection from the Kremlin. Specifically, President Putin said to Mr. Khodorkovsky: “We
have already discussed it with you recently, that your company, for example, has had problems
with the payment of taxes.”2!!*

1613. This specific reference by President Putin to Yukos’ tax issues at the February 2003 meeting is

significant.

1614. While the Tribunal has concluded, on the basis of the totality of the evidence, that
Respondent’s tax assessments and tax collection efforts against Yukos were not aimed
primarily at the collection of taxes, but rather at bankrupting Yukos and facilitating the transfer
of its assets to the State, it cannot ignore that Yukos’ tax avoidance arrangements in some of
the low-tax regions made it possible for Respondent to invoke and rely on that conduct as a

justification of its actions against Mr. Khodorkovsky and Yukos.

1615. Accordingly, even though the Tribunal has found that President Putin and his administration
used Yukos’ tax problems as a pretextual justification for setting in motion a plan to bankrupt

Yukos, as opposed to just collecting the taxes that might have been legitimately assessed

against the trading companies on the basis of the “bad faith taxpayer” doctrine, the Tribunal
concludes that there is a sufficient causal link between Yukos’ abuse of the system in some of
the low-tax regions and its demise which triggers a finding of contributory fault on the part of

Yukos.

(b) Conduct of Yukos under the Cyprus-Russia DTA

1616. As detailed in the Expert Reports of Thomas Z. Lys, Yukos’ “tax optimization” plan included
use of the trading companies in the low-tax regions to receive proceeds from the sale of Yukos”
oil and oil products, and the transfer of those proceeds to other Yukos-controlled trading and
holding companies in the Russian Federation and in off-shore jurisdictions such as Cyprus and
the British Virgin Islands.”""”

1617. Respondent, relying on the expert reports of Professor H. David Rosenbloom,’'”’ Professor
Dr. Stef van Weeghel and Mr. Polyvios G. Polyviou, has argued that Yukos’ use of the Cyprus-
Russia DTA was abusive. Claimants, relying on the Expert Report of Mr. Philip Baker QC,
counter Respondent’s argument and assert that the use by Yukos of the DTA was not abusive.
It is noteworthy that the Parties did not call as witnesses one another’s respective experts on

that issue.

1618. Claimants note that, to this day, the Russian authorities “have done absolutely nothing” in
respect of the alleged improper invocation of DTA benefits by Claimants, including under the
specific mechanisms of review that exist under the treaty itself and/or under the domestic laws
of the contracting parties.” They also submit that the first time Respondent raised any issue
regarding the tax arrangements subject to the Cyprus-Russia DTA was on 6 October 2006 in
the present arbitration and that Respondent “concocted [this issue] specifically for the purposes
of these arbitrations.””!?

1619. The Tribunal accepts Claimants’ argument that it is incongruous for the Russian Federation to

complain in these proceedings about Yukos’ use of the treaty while never having invoked the

mechanisms available to it to trigger the review of such use by, for example, invoking the

information-sharing provisions of the treaty.?!??

1620. At the same time, it seems clear to the Tribunal, on the facts, that Yukos’ operations under the
DTA were wholly conducted by Mr. Lebedev from Yukos’ established offices in Moscow, that
his “place of management” where he habitually concluded contracts relating to operations
under the Treaty was in Moscow, which of itself demonstrates that Yukos’ avoidance of
hundreds of millions of dollars in Russian taxes through the Cyprus-Russia DTA, was
questionable. Hulley appears to the Tribunal to have falsely declared on Cypriot withholding
tax forms that “income”—dividends from Yukos—‘“was not connected with activities carried
on in the Russian Federation” despite Mr. Lebedev’s activities in Moscow.”'**

1621. In any event, even if there was an abuse by Yukos of that treaty, as in the Tribunal’s prima
facie view there was, such conduct would be subsumed into and enlarge the abuse by some of
Yukos’ trading companies in some of the low tax regions, which the Tribunal has already found

amounted to contributory fault on the part of Yukos.

(c) Conduct of Yukos in Connection with YNG Auction

1622. The Tribunal reiterates that the abusive use of some of the low-tax regions by Yukos including
its questionable use of the Cyprus-Russia DTA occurred prior to the February 2003 encounter
between President Putin and Mr. Khodorkovsky and thus prior to the plan formed by the
Russian Federation not simply to collect taxes from Yukos but to bankrupt the company and

transfer its assets to the State.

1623. The YNG auction took place in December 2004 well after Respondent had put in motion its
plan to expropriate Yukos. It was preceded by Yukos’ resort to bankruptcy proceedings in
Texas, the issuance of a Temporary Restraining Order by the Texas court, and Yukos’ public
threats, most strikingly a full page advertisement in the Financial Times, warning prospective
purchasers of YNG against participating in the auction.

1624. Respondent submits that these actions discouraged prospective purchasers of YNG from taking

part in the auction and depreciated the price realized at the auction.

1625. The Tribunal agrees that, but for these actions of Yukos, it is reasonable to surmise that the

auction of YNG on 19 December 2004, the unlawful measure of Respondent that dealt as “fatal
blow” to the survival prospects of Yukos, could have resulted in a higher bid price than the
auction actually did. However, in the view of the Tribunal, Yukos’ ultimate fate would have
been no different if it had not threatened a lifetime of litigation or obtained a Temporary
Restraining Order from a Texas Court. Its demise may have been postponed, or the path to its

demise altered in some minor way, but it would not have been avoided.

1626. The Tribunal observes with interest that the RosinvestCo tribunal found that “Yukos did in

some respects contribute to its own demise” and that it referred in that context to the Houston

bankruptcy proceedings.”'”*

1627. In addition, before concluding its analysis of this facet of Claimants’ conduct, the Tribunal

needs to contrast these actions of Yukos with a series of actions of Respondent before the YNG
auction which must have depreciated the auction price very significantly and thus served the

Russian Federation objective of acquiring the Yukos assets at a bargain price.

1628. Those actions of Respondent include:

e The threat by Russia’s Ministry of Natural Resources to withdraw YNG’s operating
licenses;7!7

¢ The massive tax liabilities imposed on YNG in October and December 2004;7'?”

e The statement by the Russian Federation Ministry of Justice that the

e The decision by Respondent to fix the date of the auction exactly one month after the
auction was announced, being the minimum length of the notice required under
Russian law???

e The alleged pressure of Respondent on would be bidders from India and China not to

participate in the auction.”'*°

1629. In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that the actions of Yukos which may have depreciated the

auction price, do not constitute contributory fault as they did not contribute in a material way to

its demise.

(d) Conduct of Yukos in Connection with its Bankruptcy (Non-Payment of the
A Loan)

1630. With respect to the non payment by Yukos of the A Loan and Respondent’s submission that

such non-payment rendered Yukos responsible for its own bankruptcy, the Tribunal accepts
Respondent’s contention that Yukos was in a position to pay off the balance of the A Loan and
that its willful failure to do so contributed to the circumstances of its bankruptcy by leading
SocGen to petition for it. At the same time, the loan provisions contemplated that YNG oil
production and sale would fuel payment of the loan, and it was understandable that, once YNG
was taken over by Rosneft, Claimants should have felt that responsibility for repayment of the

A Loan was not theirs or theirs alone.

1631. Moreover, in the view of the Tribunal, even if Yukos had paid off the A Loan, it represented

only a fraction of the claims against Yukos which could have been used to petition the company
into bankruptcy. In view of the larger circumstances, it is difficult to conclude that, even if the
A Loan had been paid, another ground for pushing Yukos into bankruptcy would not have been

found.

1632. Consequently, the Tribunal concludes that, while Yukos may have been at fault in refusing to

2129

2130

pay off the A Loan, its behavior does not rise to the level of contributory fault.

In its report of 6 October 2004, Dresdner wrote that “[a] quick auction will most likely prevent the achievement of a

full price since purchasers will only be able to conduct a limited audit of the financial and economic performance and
accordingly will discount their valuation of the target asset.” [emphasis added]. Dresdner Valuation Rpeort,

4, Tribunal’s Decision on Contributory Fault

1633. Paraphrasing the words of Article 39 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility and its

commentary, the Tribunal must now determine whether Claimants’ and Yukos’ tax avoidance
arrangements in some of the low-tax regions, including their questionable use of the Cyprus-
Russia DTA summarized above, contributed to their injury in a material and significant way, or
were these minor contributory factors which, based on subsequent events such as the decision
of the Russian authorities to destroy Yukos, cannot be considered, legally, as a link in the
causative chain. As the Tribunal noted earlier in this chapter, an award of damages may be
reduced if the victim of the wrongful act of the respondent State also committed a fault which
contributed to the prejudice it suffered and for which the trier of facts, in the exercise of its

discretion, considers the claiming party should bear some responsibility.’'*!

1634. In the view of the Tribunal, Claimants should pay a price for Yukos’ abuse of the low-tax

regions by some of its trading entities, including its questionable use of the Cyprus-Russia
DTA, which contributed in a material way to the prejudice which they subsequently suffered at

the hands of the Russian Federation.

1635. In considering the extent of the contribution of Claimants’ faults to their injury, the Tribunal

notes that the subsequent conduct of the Russian Federation, as the Tribunal has found, was
disproportionate and tantamount to expropriation of Claimants’ investment in Yukos.
Claimants’ damages were caused by the series of events starting with the arrest of Messrs.
Khodorkovsky and Lebedev, and the tax assessments, and culminating in the YNG auction,
which led to the bankruptcy and liquidation of Yukos. The Tribunal must now determine to
what extent and in what proportion Claimants’ and Yukos’ conduct prior to 2003, including
their questionable use of the Cyprus-Russia DTA, contributed so as to lessen the responsibility

of Respondent.

1636. The Tribunal agrees with the ICSID Annulment Committee in the MTD v. Chile case that “the

2131

role of the two parties contributing to the loss [is] [...] only with difficulty commensurable

See ruling in MTD v. Chile {| 242—43 that “the Claimants should bear part of the damages suffered.” In that case,
that “part” was quantified as 50 percent of the damages. See also Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental
Exploration and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador, ICSID, ARB/06/111, Award, 5 October 2012
{| 659-687. In that case, that “part” was quantified as 25 percent of the damages.

 

- 509 -

and the Tribunal [has] a corresponding margin of estimation.” *'*? However, the Tribunal, as
other tribunals have done, must reach a decision and it has done so on the basis of all the

evidence which it has reviewed.

1637. Having considered and weighed all the arguments which the Parties have presented to it in

XL

respect of this issue the Tribunal, in the exercise of its wide discretion, finds that, as a result of
the material and significant mis-conduct by Claimants and by Yukos (which they controlled),
Claimants have contributed to the extent of 25 percent to the prejudice which they suffered as a
result of Respondent’s destruction of Yukos. The resulting apportionment of responsibility as
between Claimants and Respondent, namely 25 percent and 75 percent, is fair and reasonable in

the circumstances of the present case.

INTEREST

1638. As will be seen in Part XII of the Award dealing with quantification of Claimants’ damages for

1639. Claimants request the Tribunal to award them pre- and post-award interest.

1641. Claimants further contend that the Tribunal may award compound interes

determine the most appropriate rate of interest to achieve full reparation’ and quote the

award in Compaiia del Desarollo de Santa Elena, S.A. v. Republic of Costa Rica (“Santa
Elena’):

[T]he determination of interest is a product of the exercise of judgment, taking into account
all of the circumstances of the case at hand and especially considerations of fairness which
must form part of the law to be applied by this Tribunal.”

°° and that

compound interest has become “the norm in investment arbitration as regards full

reparation.”?"*!

Putting emphasis on the awards in Santa Elena and Wena Hotels Limited v.
Arab Republic of Egypt (“Wena”), Claimants explain that compound interest should be
awarded in order for the amount of compensation to reflect the additional sum that the claimant
would have earned if the money had been reinvested each year at generally prevailing rates of

. 2142
interest.”

1642. Claimants’ valuation expert, Mr. Kaczmarek, analyzed three possible rates of interest: the

LIBOR plus two or four percent; the yield on Russian sovereign bonds issued in USD; and the

THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK

1. Energy Charter Treaty

1650. Article 26(8) of the ECT provides that “awards of arbitration, which may include an award of

interest, shall be final and binding upon the parties to the dispute” [emphasis added]. In the

case of a lawful expropriation, Article 13(1) of the ECT directs that compensation “shall also

include interest_at_a rate_established_on_a_market_basis from the date of

Expropriation until the date of payment” [emphasis added].”!*°

Republic of Ecuador, ICSID ARB/04/19, Award, 18 August 2008 473, Exh. C-993, “the award of compound interest
is not a principle of international law.” As explained by BORZU SABAHI, COMPENSATION AND RESTITUTION IN
INVESTOR-STATE ARBITRATION (2011), p. 152, Exh. R-4234, “compound interest, in international investment law, may
be awarded if the aggrieved party can prove that it ‘could have received compound interest . . . by placing its money in
a readily available and commonly used investment vehicle . . .’.”. In RosInvestCo {| 688-90, Exh. C-1049, the
tribunal notes that the practice of awarding compound interest is “by no means unanimous” and that awarding interest
at “a normal commercial rate” does not imply that the tribunal “is bound to award compound interest.” Rejoinder

1651. The Tribunal observes that arbitral tribunals hearing disputes under the ECT have awarded

pre- and post-award interest at various rates.”1*°

2. ILC Articles on State Responsibility

1652. Article 38 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility reads as follows:

1. Interest on any principal sum due under this chapter shall be payable when necessary in
order to ensure full reparation. The interest rate and mode of calculation shall be set so as
to achieve that result.

2. Interest runs from the date when the principal sum should have been paid until the date
the obligation to pay is fulfilled?”

1653. The Commentary on Article 38 provides that “[t]he awarding of interest depends on the

circumstances of each case; in particular, on whether an award of interest is necessary in order

5 a2
to ensure full reparation.”?'**

3. RosInvestCo and Quasar

1654. The RosInvestCo tribunal awarded pre- and post-award interest using LIBOR alone, calculated

2159

annually, without any compounding,” while the Quasar tribunal awarded pre- and post-award

interest at a rate of 6.434 percent (corresponding to the relevant average yield of medium-term

Russian sovereign bonds dealt in USD) compounded annually.’

4, Treatises

1655. Two books on the issue of damages in international investment cases have recently been

2156

published. The Tribunal has found the chapters of these books dealing with interest very

The following paragraphs summarize these authors’ respective analyses and conclusions on

various aspects of the issue of interest in international investment cases.

(a) General Issues

. Dr. Irmgard Marboe explains that, on the one hand, interest should compensate the temporary
withholding of money: interest should address the claimant’s financial disadvantage of not
being able to dispose of money, which materializes either in loss of profit from alternative

. . 2162
investments or in costs for a loan.”!®

On the other hand, the awarding of interest should
prevent the debtor’s unjust enrichment since the debtor gains a financial profit through the
withholding of the money.” Additionally, post-award interest, writes Dr. Marboe, serves the
purpose of creating an effective incentive for the respondent to comply with an arbitral award
without delay.”!*

Dr. Sergey Ripinsky and Mr. Kevin Williams stress the well-established mantra that tribunals

enjoy a wide margin of discretion in awarding interest.”'°*

(b) Rate

. Dr. Ripinsky and Mr. Williams write that choosing the rate is “perhaps the issue where one sees

992166

the greatest variety in approaches of arbitration tribunals. They consider four different

approaches.

. The first is the “investment alternatives” approach, adopted by the majority opinion in the Iran—
U.S. Claims Tribunal case Sylvania Technical Systems v. Iran (“Sylvania”) and explained in the
following terms:

[T]he Tribunal will derive a rate of interes
successful claimant would have been in a p

to enrich itself by reason of the fact that the payment of compensation has been long delayed.”

and thus had the funds available to invest in a form of commercial investment in common
use in its own country.”
According to Dr. Ripinsky and Mr. Williams, this approach was followed in subsequent awards

of the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal as well as by the Santa Elena tribunal.”'*

. The second approach is the “borrowing rate” approach, which is based on borrowing rates from
banks in the claimant’s country! Investment tribunals have often used the LIBOR, an inter-
bank borrowing rate of interest. Some tribunals have also added a certain percentage to the
LIBOR rate to arrive at the approximate rate that international investors would have had to pay
if they had been obliged to borrow the money. According to Ripinsky and Williams, tribunals
have “normally” added two percent to LIBOR.”'”

. Dr. Marboe notes that Judge Holtzmann had argued in favor of a borrowing rate approach in his
separately recorded view on interest in the Sylvania decision, because it “is reasonable to

assume that most businesses habitually borrow while fewer regularly invest in certificates of

92171

deposit. Dr. Marboe writes that the borrowing rate approach can lead to different results,

such as the selection of the prime rate, the borrowing rate of the investor, the cost of capital of

the investor, the borrowing rate of the State (the “coerced loan theory”) or the average

borrowing rate.”!””

In respect of the prime rate, Dr. Marboe writes:

The “prime” or “base” rate plays an important role in negotiations about company loan
conditions in Anglo-American countries. As such, it seems to be an appropriate basis for
the assessment of the damages incurred by a delayed payment. However, it must be taken
into account that not all enterprises can borrow money from the banks at the prime rate.
Therefore, an increase by a few percentage points might be necessary as has been the
practice in the cases mentioned above. The question then arises, of course, how many
percentage points are appropriate. It appears, therefore, that the prime rate does not really
offer a viable means of ensuring adequate and consistent decisions on interest.”

In respect of the “coerced loan theory”, she opines:

According to this approach, the amount of interest has nothing to do with the claimant’s
actual loss, but rather depends on the respondent’ risk characteristics.

This approach measures the financial effect of the delay from the perspective of the
respondent. It has to be borne in mind, however, that pre-award interest in international
investment cases should fulfil the function of compensation or damages. Therefore, the
perspective of the claimant is decisive.

The perspective of the respondent, however, is important when it comes to the prevention
of enrichment as an additional function of the interest claim. While this is only of
secondary importance concerning pre-award interest, it becomes relevant with regard to
post-award interest. This means that the “coerced loan theory” would better fit with the
determination of post-award interest”!

1666. The third approach to interest is to rely on the interest rate applicable under the host State’s

domestic law provisions concerned. Dr. Ripinsky and Mr. Williams observe that investment

2175

tribunals have done so,” while Dr. Marboe asserts that, in international investment disputes,

“national legal interest rates are not applicable and not adequate.””'”°

1667. Finally, in a number of disputes, write Dr. Ripinsky and Mr. Williams, tribunals have adopted a

specific rate ranging from 5 to 10 percent, calling it “reasonable”, “fair” or “appropriate”.7!””

Dr. Marboe writes that “fair” rates have ranged from 5 to 17.5 percent.”'”*

1668. The Tribunal notes that, overall, Dr. Ripinsky and Mr. Williams favor the “investment

alternatives” approach, with the caveat that, in situations where the debtor’s actions force the

claimant to borrow funds, it would be appropriate to award interest at the claimant’s actual

2179 2180

borrowing rate,” whereas Dr. Marboe appears to prefer the use of inter-bank interest rates.

(c) Dies a quo

1669. The authors of both treatises affirm that, in cases of expropriation, “interest has invariably been

2179

2180

2181

calculated from the date of the taking.””'*'

(d) Simple or Compound

1670. With respect to the important issue of whether interest awarded should be simple or compound,

Dr. Ripinsky and Mr. Williams opine that “there is a trend away from only awarding simple

2182 while Dr. Marboe states that “compound

interest to generally awarding compound interest,
interest as opposed to simple interest appears to be predominantly accepted as appropriate in
recent international investment arbitration” because it is “regarded as better reflecting actual
economic realities both for the purpose of remedying the loss actually incurred by the injured
party and for the prevention of unjustified enrichment of the respondent  State.”?'*?
Dr. Ripinsky and Mr. Williams refer to the Santa Elena award, issued in 2000, as “a turning

we 92
point in jurisprudence.””'*

1671. Dr. Ripinsky and Mr. Williams observe that the period of compounding has ranged from one

year to one month and that annual compounding has been “predominant.”?'**

(e) Post-Award Interest

1672. After an extensive review of arbitral decisions, Dr. Ripinsky and Mr. Williams conclude that in

the majority of cases, tribunals have not considered post-award interest separately from
pre-award interest and have simply granted interest until the date of full payment of the award.

This “automatically turns pre-award interest into post-award.”?!*°

1673. They note that when post-award interest has been granted separately, tribunals have been more

severe towards the respondent, compared to the pre-award interest granted.?!*”

1674. According to Dr. Ripinsky and Mr. Williams, “[t]hese changes can be explained by the desire

2182

2183

2187

of some tribunals to ensure prompt compliance with the award by adding a punitive element to

interest and thereby turning the post-award interest from a purely compensatory instrument into

a sanction.””'**

1675. Dr. Ripinsky and Mr. Williams also note that some tribunals have provided for a grace period

following the date of the award, during which interest does not accrue.”!*”

TRIBUNAL’S DECISION

1676. The Tribunal, having considered the Parties’ submissions, the treatises of the learned authors

quoted extensively above, the many decisions of tribunals which have traversed the issue of
interest and, of course, the totality of the evidence in the case at hand that it considers pertinent
to its determination of this facet of the present arbitrations, will now proceed with its analysis

and exercise its judgment.

1677. As we saw earlier, the ECT, the relevant legal instrument, envisages an award of interest in an

arbitral award. In addition, the Treaty decrees mandatory payment of interest “at a commercial
rate established on a market basis” in the case of a lawful arbitration. In the view of the
Tribunal, there can be no doubt that, a fortiori, in the case of an unlawful expropriation, as in
the present case, Claimants are entitled to interest from Respondent in order to ensure full
reparation for the injury they suffered as a result of those of Respondent’s measures that the

Tribunal has found to be internationally wrongful.

1678. Neither the Treaty nor the ILC Articles on State Responsibility provide specific rules regarding

how interest should be determined. In addition, as the Tribunal has found, the practice of past
tribunals is varied and inconsistent and does not provide clear guidance. Thus, as is well
established, the Tribunal has a wide margin of discretion to determine the rate of interest

applicable and whether it should be simple or compound.

1679. Of the three rates proposed by Claimants, the LIBOR plus two or four percent, the yield on

2188

2189

Russian sovereign bonds issued in USD and the U.S. Prime rate plus two percent, the Tribunal
has rejected outright the first two for the following brief reasons. LIBOR, as Claimants’

counsel implicitly recognized during the Hearing, has been discredited, while the yield on

Ibid., p. 389; see Marboe § 6.245.
Ripinsky and Williams, p. 390; see also Marboe 4%] 6.262-6.268.

-519-

Russian sovereign bonds issued in USD would lead, in the Tribunal’s opinion, to excessive

compensation for Claimants.

1680. As for the U.S. Prime rate plus two percent, the Tribunal initially saw merit in this rate which is
a version of the borrowing rate approach reviewed earlier. The Tribunal notes that this method

was put forward by Judge Holtzmann in his separately recorded view on interest in the Sylvania

Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal case.?!”°

1681. The Tribunal has concluded however that this method should also be rejected. It is not an
appropriate basis for the assessment of the damages in this case. There is no evidence that
Claimants had to borrow money because they were not compensated at the time of the

expropriation.

1682. On the other hand, the Tribunal finds apposite the following statement of the Siemens v.

Argentina tribunal:

The Tribunal considers that the rate of interest to be taken into account is not the rate
associated with corporate borrowing but the interest rate the amount of compensation
would have earned had it been paid after the expropriation”!"'

1683. The Tribunal recalls that a rate of interest based on return of investment during the relevant

period was adopted by the Santa Elena tribunal:

[W]here an owner of property has at some earlier time lost the value of his asset but has
not received the monetary equivalent that then became due to him, the amount of
compensation should reflect, at least in part, the additional sum that his money would have
earned, had it, and the income generated by it, been reinvested each year at generally
prevailing rates of interest.!”

1684. The Tribunal observes that many investor-state tribunals have adopted this “investment

alternatives approach,””'* using rates of U.S. debt instruments even when the claimant was not

1685. The Tribunal, in the exercise of its discretion, has concluded that it would be appropriate to

award to Claimants interest on a rate based on ten-year U.S. Treasury bond rates.

1686. As will be seen in Part XII on damages, the Tribunal has ruled that Claimants’ shares in Yukos

should be valued as of the date of the Award. Accordingly, there will be no pre-award interest

granted to Claimants in respect of the damages representing the value of their shares.”!°°

1687. However, in order that they may be made whole, the Tribunal will grant pre-award interest to

Claimants for the damages which represent the value of the dividend streams for which, as will

be seen,”!°

the Tribunal has decided Claimants should be compensated. In order to compute
the pre-award interest awarded to Claimants at the rate based on ten-year U.S. Treasury bond
rates, the Tribunal will use the average yield of ten-year U.S. Treasury bonds over the period
from | January 2005 to 30 May 2014 as the applicable rate of interest, which the Tribunal has

determined to be 3.389 percent.”'””

1688. As will also be seen in Part XII on damages, the Tribunal has decided to award Claimants post-

award interest on the damages of USD 50,020,867,798 for which the Tribunal has found
Respondent liable.

1689. As to whether the interest awarded should be simple or compound, while the Tribunal

recognizes that the awarding of compound interest under international law now represents a

218 the Tribunal has

form of “jurisprudence constante” in investor-state expropriation cases,
concluded that, in the circumstances of this case, it would be just and reasonable to award
Claimants simple pre-award interest and post-award interest compounded annually if
Respondent fails to pay in full to Claimants the damages for which it has been held liable

before the expiry of the grace period hereinafter granted.

Pre-award interest on the value of the Claimants’ shares has, however, been applied in the context of calculating the

the Tribunal at the same rate as the interest awarded to them on the damages.”!”” In the event
that Respondent fails to pay in full to Claimants the costs awarded to them in Part XIII of the
present Award before the expiry of the grace period, post-award interest will accrue on any

outstanding amount, compounded annually.

1691. In the circumstances of the present case, in view of the significant amount of damages which

Respondent owes Claimants as a result of this Final Award, the Tribunal considers it
reasonable to grant to Respondent a grace period of 180 days following the date of the Award

before interest will accrue if not paid in full to Claimants by then.

1692. In order to compute any post-award interest awarded to Claimants on their damages and their

XII.

costs, the Tribunal orders that the interest rate be determined as the yield on ten-year
U.S. Treasury bonds as of 15 January 2015 and then the dates of compounding yearly

thereafter.

THE QUANTIFICATION OF CLAIMANTS’ DAMAGES

1693. The Tribunal will now determine the damages caused to Claimants by Respondent’s breach of

Article 13 of the ECT. The Parties’ positions in this regard can be summarized as follows.

CLAIMANTS’ POSITION

1694. Claimants assert that they are entitled to full reparation for Respondent’s breach of its

2199

2200

201

obligations under the ECT “through financial compensation measured at the date of

expropriation or at the date of the award, whichever is the greatest”””””

and seek damages in “an
amount to be determined by the Arbitral Tribunal,” but estimated at “no less than US$ 114.174
billion.””"' Claimants maintain that, while Article 13(1) of the ECT provides a specific rule of
compensation, this rule applies only to legal expropriations (i.e., expropriations satisfying the
conditions contained in Article 13(1)), and that, where one or more of the conditions of

Article 13(1) have not been met, the rules of customary international law apply to the issue of

reparation.” According to Claimants, in order to achieve full reparation in the event of an
unlawful expropriation, an investor must be able to choose between a valuation of the damages

it has suffered as at the date of the breach and a valuation as at the date of the award.”

1. Valuation Date

1695. Claimants submit that there are two potentially relevant dates with regard to the assessment of

damages, namely the moment when a treaty breach occurs and the moment when an award is
rendered. Claimants take the view that “an investor should be compensated in the highest
amount between the valuation of the damages it has suffered as at the date of the breach and
that at the date of the award.” The reason for this alternative valuation, according to
Claimants, is that “to the extent the assets expropriated have increased in value during the
arbitration process, this increase must accrue for the benefit of the Claimants, not to the Russian

99224

Federation.”””* Claimants refer to a number of legal authorities to support the conclusion that,
in cases of unlawful expropriations, investors are entitled to choose between a valuation as at

the date of the breach and a valuation as at the date of the award.”"°

1696. Claimants assert that the date of the expropriation of their investment in this case was

2202

2203

2208

2205

2206

2207

2208

21 November 2007, the date on which Yukos was struck off the Russian register of legal
entities. The justification for choosing this date, according to Claimants, is that “[i]n cases
involving expropriations through a series of coordinated interferences by the State, the date of
expropriation corresponds to the date on which the governmental interference ripened into an

92207

irreversible deprivation of the investor’s property, and that striking Yukos from the register

of legal entities constituted “a point of no return.”?2°*

2. Causation

1697. With regard to causation, Claimants assert that they do not need to establish a link between

individual actions of Respondent and the damages suffered, but that it suffices for them to show

that the sum of Respondent’s actions caused those damages. Claimants argue that:

[T]he Russian Federation sought and achieved the dismantlement and destruction of
Yukos, and the Claimants’ investments therein, through a series of cumulative actions. . . .
The breach, and the Respondent's responsibility, arises from the Russian Federation’s
actions taken as a whole and not from each and every one of these actions. It is the
cumulative effect of these acts that is criticized by the Claimants.”

1698. Claimants also argue that:

[A] causal link needs only be established between the actions of the Russian Federation
taken as a whole and the Claimants’ damages, namely the destruction of their investments.
This causal link is obvious . . ..”

1699. According to Claimants, there is ample authority to support their position that the Tribunal need

only consider “the totality of the Russian Federation’s actions and their result: the inexcusable

treatment of the Claimants’ investments and, ultimately, their outright expropriation.””?"!

3. Calculations Performed by Claimants and Mr. Kaczmarek

1700. Claimants have submitted two expert reports on damages authored by Mr. Brent Kaczmarek of

Navigant Consulting, dated 15 September 2010 and 15 March 2012, together with their
Memorial and their Reply, respectively. The calculations contained in these reports and

referred to in Claimants’ pleadings can be summarized as follows.

(a) | The “Scenarios” Presented by Claimants

1701. Claimants perform calculations based on three different “scenarios.” Within each of these

scenarios, Claimants also differentiate between a number of sub-scenarios.

1702. The first scenario developed by Claimants is based on two fundamental assumptions, namely

2209

210

(a) that the tax assessments against Yukos constituted a breach of the ECT, and (b) that this

breach caused the merger between Yukos and Sibneft to be cancelled. In addition, Claimants
call in aid an optional assumption in the context of this scenario, namely (c) that Yukos would
have had a 70 percent chance of obtaining a listing on the NYSE, which would have further

212 . : . woe ge .
222 Claimants’ first scenario can thus be subdivided into two sub-scenarios:

increased its value.
sub-scenario 1a, which is based only on assumptions (a) and (b); and sub-scenario 1b, which is

based on all three assumptions (a), (b), and (c).

1703. Claimants’ second scenario is based on assumption (a) described above, namely that the tax

assessments against Yukos constituted a breach of the ECT, whilst excluding assumption
(b) (thus not seeking damages for the demerger between Yukos and Sibneft). Here again two
sub-scenarios can be distinguished: sub-scenario 2a is based solely on assumption (a), whereas

sub-scenario 2b is based on both assumptions (a) and (c).

1704. Claimants’ third scenario assumes that the tax assessments against Yukos did not constitute a

breach of the ECT, but that the subsequent enforcement of the tax claims did. Accordingly,

Claimants calculate the “damages arising out of the 2004 and 2007 auctions, regardless of the
2:

merits of the alleged tax claims imposed on Yukos.””?!> Within this third scenario, Claimants
distinguish five sub-scenarios (subsequently referred to as 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d and 3e),214 all of which
assume that Yukos should have been allowed to settle its alleged tax debts one way or another
(thus avoiding the liquidation of the company), but propose different modalities as to how this

could have been done.””'5

1705. Sub-scenario 3a assumes that Yukos would have been allowed a grace period of five years and

would then have “been able to pay off the entire amount of its alleged tax liabilities out of its

operating cash-flows only by 2009,””?!°

1706. Sub-scenario 3b assumes that Yukos would have been granted a grace period of three years and

2213

224

216

would then have been able to pay off its alleged tax liabilities with a combination of its free

cash flows and the sale of non-core assets during that period.”"”

1707. Sub-scenario 3c assumes that Yukos would have been granted a grace period of one year and
would then have been able to pay off its alleged tax liabilities with a combination of its free
cash flows, the sale of non-core assets and debt financing during that period.””'*

1708. Sub-scenario 3d also assumes that Yukos would have been granted a grace period of only
one year, but then assumes (in contradistinction to sub-scenario 3c) that Yukos would have paid
off its alleged tax liabilities with a combination of free cash flows, the sale of certain core assets
and (limited) debt financing.”

1709. Finally, sub-scenario 3e assumes that, while Yukos would have had to sell YNG to settle its
alleged tax obligations, the auction “would have been conducted in a manner ensuring a fair,

2220

rather than grossly undervalued, price,” generating proceeds of USD 19.703 billion, ~~ with the

result that Yukos would have paid off its alleged tax liabilities with these proceeds as well as its

2221

cash flows in 2004 and 2005, while remaining a going concern.

1710. In accordance with Claimants’ submissions regarding the relevant valuation dates, Claimants
base their damages calculations in the first place on a valuation date of 21 November 2007.
Accordingly, Claimants provide calculations for all three scenarios based on this date. In
addition, Claimants also carry out a number of calculations based on the date of | January

992222

2012, as a proxy for the date of the award, “for comparison purposes. Claimants provide

calculations based on this date for scenarios | and 2, but not for scenario 3.

(b) Methodology Used for Calculations Based on Scenarios 1 and 2

1711. Claimants’ calculations for scenarios | and 2 as of November 2007 are in principle based on the
following methodology: the total of the damages claimed corresponds to the sum of Claimants’
share in a hypothetical Yukos entity as of the valuation date plus the hypothetical cash flows
that Claimants would have received in the form of dividends based on Claimants’ shareholding

in Yukos from 2004 to November 2007. In addition, in scenarios 1b and 2b, Claimants also

include the value they attribute to the “lost chance” of listing Yukos’ shares on the NYSE.”
The total amount thus obtained is then “brought forward” to a date close to the date of
Mr. Kaczmarek’s report by adding pre-award interest.”** Each one of these steps is set out in

more detail below.

i. Value of Shares

1712. With regard to the valuation date of 21 November 2007, Claimants calculate the value of their

shares in Yukos as follows:

(a) Valuation of Yukos

1713. As a first step, Claimants calculate the value of the relevant Yukos entity, as defined by the

assets that Claimants assume Yukos would have owned in November 2007 in the absence of

222

Respondent's alleged breaches.”””* The assets taken into account depend on the scenario. For

the purposes of scenario 1, both Yukos’ and Sibneft’s original assets are taken into account, °°

2207

whereas for scenario 2 the calculations are based only on Yukos’ assets. Claimants use
three different methods for valuating Yukos, namely the DCF method, the comparable

companies method and the comparable transactions method.””*

1714. With regard to the DCF method, Claimants describe their approach as an attempt to reconstruct

229

the “pro-forma financial statements” that the relevant Yukos entity would have presented in
November 2007, based on the financial and operational data published by Rosneft and
Gazprom Neft, which held the majority of Yukos’ assets at that point in time.°? Where no
such data is available, Claimants rely on “historical financial statements and operating

information published by Yukos and Sibneft . . . as well as a benchmark of indicators from

The total loss T under Claimants’ scenario 1b based on a valuation date of November 2007 can thus be described as
Value of Shares in November 2007 (V) + Dividends received from 2004 to 2007 (D) + Value of “lost chance” to
hares on NYSE (LC). Memorial 920. See also Claimants’ Opening Slides, p. 204.

Yukos’ and Sibneft’s industry peers in Russia.””**” Based on this data, Claimants estimate cash

flows between 2007 and 2015 as well as a “terminal value” of the entity in 2015.7! Claimants
then bring the above estimates to their November 2007 value by applying a discount rate based
on Yukos’ cost of capital.”

November 2007.

This operation leads them to Yukos’ enterprise value as of

1715. Claimants also use a comparable companies approach, based on data available for a pool of
Russian (Rosneft, Gazprom Neft, Lukoil, TNK-BP and Surgutneftegaz) and international (BP,
Chevron, Conoco-Philips, Exxon-Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell and Total SA) oil companies.”***

This approach identifies companies with characteristics similar to Yukos (notably in terms of

production, reserves, profitability, revenue growth and financing structure), establishes the

ratios between the enterprise value of these companies and relevant operating or financial
metrics (EBITDA, reserves and production), and then applies these ratios to the relevant

2235 The net income,

metrics of Yukos in order to estimate the latter’s enterprise value.
EBITDA, reserves and production of Yukos are derived from the “pro-forma financial

statements” established in the context of the DCF method.”*°

1716. Finally, Claimants use a comparable transactions approach based on public purchase
transactions of comparable companies.”” In this regard, Claimants apply a “sum of the parts
valuation,” in which they select transactions that are meant to match the upstream and
downstream business of Yukos separately.?* Here again, the operating and financial metrics
of Yukos as determined in the context of the DCF method are used to calculate the value of the
company.”

1717. Claimants then calculate a synthesized enterprise value of Yukos based on the results of the

three approaches, weighing the DCF approach at 50 percent, the comparable companies

approach at 40 percent and the comparable transactions approach at 10 percent.“ By then

subtracting Yukos’ assumed debt, they arrive at Yukos’ synthesized equity value."

(b) Calculation of the Value of Claimants’ Shareholding

1718. Ina final step, for each of the scenarios considered, Claimants calculate the value of Claimants’

shareholding in Yukos by multiplying the company’s equity value by Claimants’ share in the
company—53 percent (corresponding to the dilution of Claimants’ shareholding associated
with the creation of YukosSibneft) for scenario 1 and 70.5 percent (corresponding to

Claimants’ original shareholding in Yukos) for scenario 2.7

ii. | Additional Indicators Relied on by Claimants to Confirm the
Value of Yukos Shares

1719. With regard to scenario 1, Mr. Kaczmarek avers that he confirmed his valuation with a number

of additional indicators. Claimants calculate Yukos’ enterprise value based on the market
capitalization of Rosneft in November 2007, with a number of adjustments made in order to
take into account the differences between Rosneft’s assets and Yukos’ (fictitious) assets as of
that date. The result of this calculation is an enterprise value that is about USD 4.5 billion

lower than the enterprise value calculated on the basis of the above-described methodology.”

1720. Mr. Kaczmarek also confirms his valuation of Yukos’ enterprise value as of November 2007

2240

22a

2242

2243

2244

2245

based on the increase of three benchmarks (Urals blend prices, the RTS Oil and Gas index and
Lukoil’s market capitalization) between October 2003 and November 2007. These
calculations lead to an enterprise value of Yukos that is approximately halfway between
USD 14.4 billion lower (RTS Oil and Gas) and USD 46.5 billion higher (Lukoil market
capitalization) than the enterprise value of Yukos calculated on the basis of Claimants’ basic

methodology.”

Ibid. ¥§ 944-45. Claimants note that they assign a low weight to the results of their comparable transactions approach,
due to the “absence of a transaction involving a company similar to YukosSibneft in the years preceding the date of
valuation.” Ibid. | 945.

1721. Finally, Claimants calculate Yukos’ enterprise value on the basis of a share swap involving

YNG shares that would have taken place between Rosneft and Yukos in October 2006, which
Claimants say implies a valuation of YNG’s equity at USD 46.2 billion at that point in time."
On that basis, Claimants calculate an enterprise value of Yukos as of 21 November 2007 that is
approximately USD 12.8 billion lower than the value calculated on the basis of their basic

methodology.”*"”

iii, | Hypothetical Cash Flows from Dividends

1722. The second component of Claimants’ damages calculation is the cash flows from dividends that

Claimants argue would have been paid to them in the first and second scenarios but for
Respondent’s treaty breaches. Claimants assume that, without the alleged breaches of the ECT
by Respondent, Yukos would have paid dividends to its shareholders between 30 September
2003 and 21 November 2007.”* Accordingly, Claimants say that they would have received a
pro rata share of these dividends, calculated on the basis of their shareholding in the

2.
company.”

iv. Loss of Chance

1723. The third component of Claimants’ damages calculation is based on Claimants’ valuation of

2246

2247

2248

249

250

what they refer to as the loss of a chance to obtain a listing of Yukos on the NYSE. Claimants
submit that, without the breaches of Respondent, Yukos would likely have been listed on the
NYSE, and that this listing would have decreased the company’s costs of capital and thus
increased Yukos’ share value.*’ Claimants quantify the value of the loss of this chance by
multiplying the assumed increase in share value with the probability of a successful listing,
which they assume to be 70 percent.”*! This loss for Claimants is the amount thus obtained,

multiplied by Claimants’ shareholding in Yukos.”**

v. Pre-Award Interest

1724. In a final step for purposes of their calculations with regard to scenarios 1 and 2, Claimants

bring forward the total amount thus obtained to a date close to the date of their last

submissions,”*** and add pre-award interest of LIBOR plus four percent on a compound

basis.”***

(c) Methodology Used for Calculations Based on Scenario 3

1725. Claimants’ calculations for scenarios 3a to 3d are based on their calculations for the second

scenario, but are adjusted to take into account the settlement of Yukos’ tax liabilities through
Yukos’ cash flow, the sale of certain assets and/or debt financing.?>> These scenarios do not
assume any payment of dividends to Yukos’ shareholders or the loss of a chance of obtaining a
listing of Yukos on the NYSE.” Rather, Claimants determine Yukos’ equity value as of
November 2007 and derive the value of their ownership interest in Yukos from that figure.
They then bring forward the amount thus obtained to a date close to the date of their last
submissions again by adding compound pre-award interest at a rate of LIBOR plus four

2s
percent.”?*”

1726. Claimants’ calculations for scenario 3e (which assumes the sale of YNG at a price higher than

 

2254

2256

2258

259

that achieved in the 2004 auction) are somewhat more complex. In this scenario, Claimants
estimate the enterprise value of YNG as of November 2007, and then subtract this amount from
their estimate of the enterprise value of Yukos as of the same date. This leaves Claimants with
a figure for the enterprise value of Yukos’ assets without YNG.”** Claimants then subtract the
assumed debt of this smaller Yukos entity and thus arrive at the equity value of Yukos (without
YNG) in November 2007.”5° Claimants calculate their losses as a pro rata share (based on
their 70.5 percent shareholding in Yukos) of the sum of this equity value, their estimate of free

cash flows that a diminished Yukos (without YNG) would have achieved between January

2005 and November 2007, and pre-award interest brought forward to a date close to the date of

their last submissions.°

(d) Methodology Used for Calculations Based on 2012 Valuation Date

1727. The position of Claimants is that, because of the unlawful taking by Respondent of Yukos, they

are entitled to select the evaluation of the damages either at the date of Respondent’s breach or

at the date of the award, whichever is the highest?"

Thus, Claimants, in their Reply, also
quantify their damages in scenarios | and 2 based on a valuation date of 1 January 2012.
Claimants state they chose this date for practical purposes since it is close to the date of
submission of Mr. Kaczmarek’s second expert report and that, if need be, calculations “can

subsequently be updated at a date closer to the award.””°*

it can be inferred from some of the appendices to his second repot In these
appendices, Mr. Kaczmarek estimates Yukos’ cash flows for the years 2004 to 2011 as well as
the terminal value of Yukos as of | January 2012 for scenarios 1 and 2 and then applies
pre-award interest of LIBOR plus four percent to bring these figures to the present (i.e.,
15 March 2012)65 value and thus obtain Yukos’ total damages.”*°° For scenarios 1b and 2b,
Claimants also add the incremental value of the chance of obtaining a listing on the NYSE.”
Claimants then calculate their damages as a percentage of Yukos’ damages, based on their

shareholding in the relevant entity.”

4, Failure of Claimants to Mitigate

In response to Respondent’s contention that Claimants should promptly have paid the original

taxes assessed against Yukos (as well as those Yukos should have anticipated would be

imposed for succeeding years on the same grounds) to avoid massive damages, Claimants aver

that there is no “duty to appease” and that “a victim of extortion is not to blame if the threats

against it are carried out after it refuses to pay.

992282

Claimants also argue that Yukos had no reason to concede the validity of the Russian

authorities’ position with regard to the initial tax assessments “in circumstances where its

objections to the December 29, 2003 Audit Report were still under consideration” and where it

an alleged tax debt of USD 9 billion in the first quarter of 2004.74

In any event, Claimants say that Yukos did not have enough cash to settle

1732. In addition, Claimants assert that, to apply Respondent’s argument, “the Tribunal would need to
ignore the most salient facts—the Respondent’s breaches—and assume . . . that the very same
Russian authorities who committed those breaches would have acted differently if only Yukos

285 Tn particular, with regard to

had taken the actions specified by the Respondent.
Respondent’s argument that Yukos could have significantly reduced its tax burden by filing
corrected VAT returns during the first quarter of 2004, Claimants contend that the actual
conduct of the Russian authorities demonstrates that any amended returns that Yukos might

have submitted would, in any event, have been either ignored or rejected.”*°

5. Windfall and Double-Recovery

1733. Finally, Claimants also reject Respondent’s arguments that any award of damages should avoid
presenting Claimants with a windfall and take into account the risk of double-recovery.
According to Claimants, these arguments of Respondent merely seek to “repackage its
so-called ‘unclean hands’ theory in the context of damages” and Respondent, they say, “has
failed to articulate any basis on which alleged collateral illegalities could... be relevant to an

assessment of damages.””*”

In any event, conclude Claimants, any benefits they may have
received through their investments prior to Respondent’s breaches of the ECT are irrelevant for
the calculation of the damages in the present arbitration and, furthermore, any assets located

outside Russia have been excluded from Mr. Kaczmarek’s valuations.”***

B. RESPONDENT’S POSITION

1734. Respondent argues that, even if it were held to be liable for a breach of the ECT, Claimants

should not be awarded any damages in this case.”

Respondent has submitted two expert
reports on damages by Professor James Dow, one dated 1 April 2011 and the other 15 August
2012, with their Counter-Memorial and their Rejoinder, respectively. These reports and
Respondent’s arguments with regard to Claimants’ damages calculations can be summarized as

follows.

1. Valuation Date
1735. Respondent disagrees with both valuation dates proposed by Claimants.

1736. With regard to Claimants’ valuation as of the date of expropriation, Respondent invokes the
principle that “the valuation date should be when the purported substantial deprivation of the
investor’s investment has occurred.”??°° Respondent objects, however, to Claimants’

assessment that in this case a substantial deprivation of their investment occurred on

2:

21 November 2007, a date which Respondent considers “arbitrary.”*' Respondent argues that

“the hallmark of an appropriate valuation date is the loss of effective control over the investor’s

592292

investment””~~ and concludes that “Claimants have repeatedly averred that they lost control of

their investment and that it lost all value long before November 21, 2007.73

1737. As a result, Respondent disputes that the date of 21 November 2007 chosen by Claimants has

any relevance. As Professor Dow explained at the Hearing:

1am very clear in stating that the 2007 date has no economic relevance, in my view. And I
say that because at the end of 2004 Yukos shares had lost essentially all of their value.
Yukos was a penny stock. It wasn’t expected to recover, the market did not expect it to
recover; that was reflected in the share price... . So from an economic point of view, the
date of delisting i in 2007 is a bureaucratic event, “not an event at which value was lost. 22

1738. While Respondent does not propose any specific alternative date when Claimants lost control

of their investments, Professor Dow suggested at the Hearing that such a date would, in any

event, have to be before the end of 2004.

2295

1739. Respondent also rejects Claimants’ submission that the date of an award can be used as an

alternative valuation date. In this regard, Respondent argues that the “standard theoretical
framework economists typically use to calculate damages is an ‘ex ante’ one” where damages
are assessed at the moment of the relevant breaches and then brought to present value with pre-
judgment interest.”°* By contrast, an “ex post” approach would, according to Respondent, use
information based on hindsight, provide no principled basis for choosing a date and therefore
be vulnerable to error.”*” In addition, Respondent claims that, “with each passing day after the
alleged takings date, it becomes increasingly speculative to value the asset taken as of some

later date."

1740. In his first report, Professor Dow writes that there is a “general preference among economists

for the ex ante approach when evaluating damages in commercial matters” and refers, in this
connection, to an article published in the 1990 Journal of Accounting, Auditing and Finance.””
Relying on this article, Respondent submits that “an expropriation relieves the owner not only
of the value of the asset on the date of expropriation, but also of the risk associated with owning
it” and that, as a consequence, “[t]he only way to recognize both aspects is to assess the value
of the asset on the date of expropriation, when neither its owner nor the State knows whether

the asset will increase or decrease in value.”*”

2. Causation

1741. Respondent also disagrees with Claimants with respect to causation. In particular, Respondent

2295

2296

297

2298

299

2300

emphasizes the need to establish “a sufficient causal link” between breach and damage, where

2301

the latter is the “proximate result” of the former. Respondent advocates the following

methodology:

[I]f the damages are caused by a series of harmful actions . . . each violation can be treated
as a new action and the corresponding incremental change can be estimated at the time of
the action, ... [t]he incremental damage figures for each violation can then be added
together to obtain a total damage figure.”

1742. According to Respondent, Claimants’ approach to damages fails “to connect any of the alleged

treaty violations to a specific amount of damages” and provides “no mechanism for
determining the incremental damages allegedly caused by any specific alleged violation.”
As a consequence, Respondent alleges that Claimants’ valuations “do not accommodate the
situation where the Tribunal finds that fewer than all of the scores of alleged ‘bad acts’ were

violations.”°™

3. Specific Aspects of the Calculations Performed by Claimants Criticized by
Respondent

1743. Principally, Respondent criticizes Claimants’ damages claims as being “based on inherently

992305

incorrect or speculative assumptions. According to Professor Dow, Mr. Kaczmarek’s

various calculations are “riddled with errors” and the obvious result of “reverse engineering to a

992306

desired result. Respondent and its expert raise numerous arguments in support of their

criticism, the most important of which are summarized below.

(a) Credibility of Claimants’ DCF Analysis

1744. One of Respondent’s main criticisms with regard to Claimants’ valuation is directed at

2301

2302

2303

2308

2305

2306

2307

Mr. Kaczmarek’s DCF analysis. In particular, in his first expert report, Professor Dow
identifies what Respondent claims are “three obvious and significant errors” regarding the

valuation of YN Respondent points out that, while Mr. Kaczmarek admitted to two of

these errors in his second expert report, the valuation of YNG remained virtually unchanged.”>*

As a consequence, Respondent claims that Mr. Kaczmarek’s “main task” in his second report
must have been to “find a way to make up for gaping holes in his initial valuation that he
concedes were the result of readily identifiable errors that he realized had to be corrected, after

Professor Dow had identified them.”?*”

Respondent points out that, while the necessary
corrections identified by Professor Dow caused Claimants’ expert to make adjustments of over
USD 10 billion to his valuation of YNG, Mr. Kaczmarek still ended up with virtually the same
figure as in his first report as a consequence of a series of simultaneous “discretionary” upward

adjustments.”*!”

1745. Respondent also claims that Claimants’ expert “did the same thing in his other two DCF

models, correcting mistakes that reduce his valuation of Yukos and YukosSibneft by
USD 40 billion and USD 90 billion, respectively, and then adjusting other elements to bring his
conclusions back up to where he started.”**'' According to Respondent, “Mr. Kaczmarek
confirmed ...that his DCF model is simply a device for justifying an a priori conclusion,
conceding repeatedly that his focus was not on critically analyzing the inputs to his model, but
rather on whether the output met pre-conceived notions that were never disclosed in his

992312

As a result, Respondent concludes that Claimants’ results have been “reverse

engineered” and are “made-up numbers around which models were built.

(b) Claimants’ Selection of Comparable Companies for Purposes of the
Comparable Companies Analysis

analysis that excludes the data with regard to Rosneft, Gazprom Neft and the international
major oil companies from the analysis,”*"° and leads to an enterprise value for Yukos in 2007
that is approximately USD 32 billion lower than the enterprise value calculated by

Mr. Kaczmarek based on the comparable companies method.”*!”

(c) Claimants’ Reliance on Comparable Transactions

1747. With regard to Claimants’ calculations based on comparable transactions, Respondent asserts

that Claimants’ expert, Mr. Kaczmarek, admits that no truly comparable transactions exist.”>'*

In addition, Professor Dow criticizes Mr. Kaczmarek’s selection criteria for identifying
comparable upstream and downstream transactions as “indefensible from an economic

perspective. 318

(d) Claimants’ Calculations of Hypothetical Cash Flows from Dividends

1748. Respondent does not explicitly address Claimants’ calculations of hypothetical dividends that

would have been paid by Yukos to its shareholders if there had been no breach of the ECT as
alleged by Claimants. However, when criticizing Mr. Kaczmarek’s calculations with regard to
scenario 3, Professor Dow does comment on the free cash flows of Yukos that, according to
Claimants, would have been the basis for the payment of dividends. Thus, according to
Professor Dow, the free cash flows identified by Mr. Kaczmarek in this context are “inflated
because they are based on his . . . grossly erroneous[] Yukos DCF model that overstates Yukos
cash flows.”?*° Professor Dow provides an alternative set of figures that he refers to as the

(e) Claimants’ Calculations Based on the Loss of a Chance to Obtain a Listing on
the New York Stock Exchange

1749. Professor Dow also criticizes Claimants’ assumption that Yukos would have benefited from a

listing on the NYSE as “thrice wrong because it assumes an event that did not happen, that was

entirely within Yukos’ control, and overstates the economic benefit that would be expected

were the event to have come to pass. 322 I addition, Professor Dow states that there is no

basis for the assumption that, without Respondent’s actions, Yukos would have had a 70

323

percent chance of being listed on the NYSE.”

Claii Cc ‘ions Based on the A ption of a Completed Yukos—
Sibneft Merger

1750. Professor Dow criticizes Claimants’ calculations based on a completed Yukos—Sibneft merger

arguing that such a merger was never completed and that the valuation of a combined
YukosSibneft entity is therefore utterly speculative.” In particular, Professor Dow claims that
Mr. Kaczmarek’s calculations largely ignore “the effects of the merger on operational costs,
any impact on costs as a result of changed regulatory requirements, and the combined entity’s

. . so, 992325
creditworthiness and cost of borrowing.”””

2327

in any event, not obligated to do so. In addition, Respondent claims that, based on the

knowledge available regarding the development of oil prices in 2004, Claimants’ calculations

in relation to expected cash flows are not realistic.“** Respondent also disputes that Claimants

(h) Claimants’ Scenario 3e and the Valuation of YNG

1752. With regard to Claimants’ scenario 3e (which assumes that the auctioning of YNG was

necessary, but should have been realized at a fair price) and the valuation of YNG in
Mr. Kaczmarek’s first expert report, Respondent claims that Mr. Kaczmarek made three
“obvious and significant errors” relating to the application of the inflation rate, the export duty
rate and the mineral extraction tax rate.” Adjusting for these errors, the valuation of YNG
would have been USD 12.5 billion?! with the consequence that Yukos would not have been

able to pay its taxes by the end of 2005, even if YNG had been sold at a higher price.**

(i) — Claimants’ Calculation of Pre-Award Interest

1753. As described in Part XI above, Respondent submits that Claimants are not entitled to claim pre-

award interest.

4, Failure of Claimants to Mitigate

1754. Respondent asserts that Claimants had “repeated opportunities to mitigate the damage

rather than “subject[ing] itself to...US$ 12 billion in

a going concern and still could have pursued a claim for a refund of any amounts the courts

found it did not need to pay.””*° Accordingly, the “loss of all value of Yukos” would be “the

1755. Respondent claims that, as a consequence, ‘Claimants’ maximum damage claim is for their

proportion of the harm (if any) Yukos would have suffered if the assessment and payment of
the 2000-2003 Unavoidable Taxes were deemed to constitute a violation of the ECT.”***

Respondent calculates this “maximum damage” as amounting to USD 6.27 billion.*”

5. Windfall and Double-Recovery

1756. In addition, Respondent claims that any calculation of damages should take into account any

previous benefits obtained by Claimants from their investments in Russia, so as to prevent any

« 9923
‘double-recovery.””*”

Respondent contends that granting Claimants the damages sought
“would be a massive windfall to Claimants, who have already received far more from their
investment in Yukos than they would have received had they invested in a comparable Russian
oil company during the same period.”**' Respondent also suggests that, had the market known
of “Yukos’ lack of transparency, its disregard of minority interests, and its failures of corporate
governance, not to mention its internal documents acknowledging the civil and criminal
exposure it faced from its massive tax fraud, Yukos would not have experienced the share

992342

appreciation...on which Claimants’ damages claim depends. As a consequence,

Respondent claims that “the market metrics ... are not fair indicators of value and cannot be

relied upon by the Tribunal.”

1757. Respondent concludes that “any damages award should provide for no more than a reasonable

TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS AND DECISION

1758. Having reviewed and considered the Parties’ submissions and their experts’ reports, the

Tribunal will now determine the damages suffered by Claimants as a result of Respondent’s

unlawful expropriation of Yukos’ assets in breach of Article 13 of the ECT.

1. Valuation Date

1759. With regard to the date of valuation, the Tribunal needs to address two issues, namely (a) the

date of the expropriation of Claimants’ investment by Respondent, and (b) whether Claimants
are entitled to choose between a valuation based on that date of expropriation and a valuation

based on the date of the award. Each of these questions is addressed in turn.

(a) The Date of the Expropriation

1760. As noted earlier, Claimants have advanced the date of 21 November 2007, the day on which

Yukos was struck off the Russian register of legal entities, as the date of the expropriation of
their investment, and have performed their main damages analysis based on a valuation of their

shares in Yukos as of that date.

1761. The Tribunal agrees with Respondent that the date of 21 November 2007 cannot be the date of

Yukos’ expropriation. The Tribunal observes that both Parties are agreed that, in principle, in
the event of an expropriation through a series of actions, the date of the expropriation is the date
on which the incriminated actions first lead to a deprivation of the investor’s property that
crossed the threshold and became tantamount to an expropriation.*“* This is the date that is

relevant for the determination of the Tribunal.

1762. The Tribunal finds that the threshold to the expropriation of Claimants’ investment was crossed

2345

2346

earlier than in November 2007. On the basis of the record, it is clear to the Tribunal that a

substantial and irreversible deprivation of Claimants’ assets occurred on 19 December 2004,

Memorial § 912, n.1314; Reply | 940; Rejoinder § 1666; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief § 238.

= 543 -

the date of the YNG auction. YNG was Yukos’ main production asset and its loss, with the
conclusion of the auction on that date, marked a substantial and irreversible diminution of
Claimants’ investment.” This conclusion of the Tribunal is confirmed by statements made by
Claimants in December 2004 to the effect that they had “lost the power to govern the financial
and operating policies of Yukos so as to obtain the benefits from its activities” and that Yukos

48

had become “incapable of operating as a business.”’*“* The date of the expropriation of

Claimants’ investment is therefore determined by the Tribunal to be 19 December 2004.

(b) The Possibility for Claimants to Choose Between a Valuation as of the Date of
Expropriation and a Valuation as of the Date of the Award

1763. The Tribunal also holds that, in the case of an unlawful expropriation, as in the present case,

Claimants are entitled to select either the date of expropriation or the date of the award as the

date of valuation.

1764. As the Tribunal noted earlier, Respondent, relying on the opinion of its expert on damages,

maintains that Claimants may not make such a choice and that there is a preference amongst

economists for what he refers to as an “ex ante” approach to the evaluation of damages.” In

support of his opinion, Professor Dow relies on a single article published in an economics

journal in 1990.73°°

1765. Neither the text of Article 13 of the ECT nor its travaux provide a definitive answer to the

2347

2348

2349

2350

question of whether damages should be assessed as of the date of expropriation or the date of
the award. The text of Article 13, after specifying the four conditions that must be met to
render an expropriation lawful, provides that for “such” an expropriation, that is, for a lawful
expropriation, damages shall be calculated as of the date of the taking. A contrario, the text of
Article 13 may be read to import that damages for an unlawful taking need not be calculated as
of the date of taking. It follows that this Tribunal is not required by the terms of the ECT to

assess damages as of the time of the expropriation. Moreover, conflating the measure of

1768.

damages for a lawful taking with the measure of damages for an unlawful taking is, on its face,

an unconvincing option.

In the view of the Tribunal, and in exercise of the latitude that the terms of Article 13 of the
ECT afford it in this regard, the question of whether an expropriated investor is entitled to
choose between a valuation as of the expropriation date and the date of an award is one best
answered by considering which party should bear the risk and enjoy the benefits of
unanticipated events leading to a change in the value of the expropriated asset between the time
of the expropriatory actions and the rendering of an award. The Tribunal finds that the
principles on the reparation for injury as expressed in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility
are relevant in this regard. According to Article 35 of the ILC Articles, a State responsible for
an illegal expropriation is in the first place obliged to make restitution by putting the injured
party into the position that it would be in if the wrongful act had not taken place. This
obligation of restitution applies as of the date when a decision is rendered. Only to the extent
where it is not possible to make good the damage caused by restitution is the State under an

obligation to compensate pursuant to Article 36 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility.

The consequences of the application of these principles (restitution as of the date of the
decision, compensation for any damage not made good by restitution) for the calculation of
damages in the event of illegal expropriation are twofold. First, investors must enjoy the
benefits of unanticipated events that increase the value of an expropriated asset up to the date of
the decision, because they have a right to compensation in lieu of their right to restitution of the
expropriated asset as of that date. If the value of the asset increases, this also increases the
value of the right to restitution and, accordingly, the right to compensation where restitution is

not possible.

Second, investors do not bear the risk of unanticipated events decreasing the value of an
expropriated asset over that time period. While such events decrease the value of the right to
restitution (and accordingly the right to compensation in lieu of restitution), they do not affect
an investor’s entitlement to compensation of the damage “not made good by restitution” within
the meaning of Article 36(1) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. If the asset could be
returned to the investor on the date where a decision is rendered, but its value had decreased
since the expropriation, the investor would be entitled to the difference in value, the reason
being that in the absence of the expropriation the investor could have sold the asset at an earlier
date at its previous higher value. The same analysis must also apply where the asset cannot be

returned, allowing the investor to claim compensation in the amount of the asset’s higher value.

investor is entitled to choose between a valuation as of the expropriation date and as of the date
of the award. The Tribunal finds support for this conclusion in the fact that this approach has
been adopted by tribunals in a number of recent decisions dealing with illegal expropriation.**!
One of these tribunals, in Joannis Kardassopoulous and Ron Fuchs v. The Republic of Georgia,

2352

so interpreted the ECT.

2. Causation
2353,

The Tribunal finds it useful to address the Parties’ views on this matter in two steps. First, the
Tribunal will address the requirements for showing the causation of damages where several
actions are invoked at the same time. Second, it will deal with the consequences of damage
being caused by several actions, only some of which are breaches attributable to the respondent

party.

(a) Causation and Reliance on Multiple Actions

1771. Claimants assert that “a causal link needs only be established between the actions of the

Russian Federation taken as a whole and Claimants’ damages” and that “[t]his causal link is
obvious.” Respondent takes the view that, by simply asserting a link between the totality of
a number of “bad acts” and the damage, Claimants put themselves in a position where they

have to show that “all of the scores of alleged ‘bad acts’ were [treaty] violations.”*>*>

1772. The Tribunal holds that Claimants do, in fact, establish that a specific series of actions of

2351

2352

2355

Respondent, consisting of the 2000-2004 tax assessments against Yukos and the subsequent

enforcement measures (including the forced auction of YNG), constituted an_ illegal

Claimants’ Post-Hearing Brief § 191. By contrast, see Counter-Memorial J 1619 (Respondent takes the view that, by
simply asserting a link between the totality of a number of “bad acts” and a damage, Claimants put themselves in a
position where they have to show that “all of the scores of alleged ‘bad acts’ were [treaty] violations.”). See also

expropriation of Claimants’ investment, and that this expropriation caused Claimants damage.
In particular, the 2000-2004 tax assessments were actions that contributed to the expropriation
of Claimants’ investment, and without these assessments, the damage to Claimants would not
have occurred. While other actions taken by Respondent may or may not have contributed to a
violation of the ECT’s standards, showing that they did is not required for establishing
causation with regard to the damage suffered by Claimants. All of the heads of damage
subsequently identified by the Tribunal are consequences of the 2000-2004 tax assessments
that led to the expropriation of Claimants’ investment, and this expropriation was clearly a

breach of Article 13 ECT.

(b) Multiple Causes for the Same Damage

1773. The Parties also do not agree with regard to the consequences of damage being caused by
several events, where only some of those events are breaches attributable to a respondent party.
Respondent appears to suggest that concurrent causation of a particular line of damage by
Claimants’ own conduct, the conduct of third parties and conduct of Respondent that is not

2356 and that Claimants

wrongful should exclude Respondent’s responsibility for that damage,
bear the burden of showing that no such causation exists.”*’ The Tribunal does not agree with

that argument.

1774. In this regard, the Tribunal finds it instructive to look to the ILC Articles on State
Responsibility. Article 31 of the ILC Articles provides that “[t]he responsible State is under an
obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused.”**** The official commentary to this
provision notes that “[o]ften two separate factors combine to cause damage,” before pointing

out that:

Although, in such cases, the injury in question was effectively caused by a combination of
factors, only one of which is to be ascribed to the responsible State, international practice
and the decisions of international tribunals do not support the reduction or attenuation of
reparation for concurrent causes, except in cases of contributory fault... Such a result
should follow a fortiori in cases where the concurrent cause is not the act of another
State . . . but of private individuals. ... [UJnless some part of the injury can be shown to

-547-

be severable in causal terms from that attributed to the responsible State, the latter is held
responsible for all the consequences, not being too remote, of its wrongful conduct.”

1775. As the commentary makes clear, the mere fact that damage was caused not only by a breach,
but also by a concurrent action that is not a breach does not, as such, interrupt the relationship
of causation that otherwise exists between the breach and the damage. Rather, it falls to the
Respondent to establish that a particular consequence of its actions is severable in causal terms
(due to the intervening actions of Claimants or a third party) or too remote to give rise to
Respondent’s duty to compensate. As the Tribunal considers that Respondent has not
demonstrated this with regard to any of the heads of damage identified in the remainder of this
Chapter, the Tribunal holds that causation exists between the damage and Respondent’s

expropriation of Claimants’ investment.*

3. Failure of Claimants to Mitigate

1776. Respondent asserts that Claimants could have significantly mitigated their damages by taking a
few simple steps in the first quarter of 2004, namely by paying the taxes then assessed against
Yukos, filing amended VAT returns in Yukos’ name, and filing amended tax returns for the
years 2000-2002 and a tax return for 2003 recognizing all of Yukos’ income without assigning
it to its trading entities. The Tribunal has considered each of the actions Respondent suggests
Claimants should have taken (set out in paragraphs 679-80, 745-48 and 934-35 above) and has
concluded that the suggested actions would not ultimately have made a difference to the
enforcement measures subsequently taken by the Russian Federation. As seen in Part VIII
above, the measures taken by the Russian Federation demonstrate that its primary objective was
to bankrupt Yukos and appropriate its assets and that it was determined to do whatever was
necessary to achieve this purpose. In light of this finding, the Tribunal cannot accept that by
paying the taxes then assessed or re-filing VAT and tax returns in early 2004, Claimants could

have deterred Respondent in the pursuit of its objective.

4, The Methodology Followed by the Tribunal

1777. Having made these determinations in respect of the valuation dates, causation and mitigation,

the Tribunal now turns to the specific methodology of establishing the damages in this

235° Ibid. J§ 12-13 (footnotes omitted), Exh. R-1031
2569 Claimants’ contributory fault and the associated reduction of the damages suffered has already been addressed above
in Chapter X.E.

arbitration. As an initial matter, the Tribunal observes that, since it has decided that Claimants
are entitled to the higher of the damages determined as of the date of expropriation and as of the
date of the award, the Tribunal must establish the total amount of damages caused by
Respondent’s actions on each of the two valuation dates identified, namely the date of the YNG
auction and the date of this Award. For purposes of the Tribunal’s calculations, the date of the
Award will be deemed to be 30 June 2014. Claimants will be entitled to the higher of these two

figures, subject to the deduction of 25 percent for contributory fault.*°'

1778. On each of these valuation dates, Claimants are entitled to the following heads of damages:

(1) the value of Claimants’ shares in Yukos valued as of the valuation date; (2) the value of the
dividends that the Tribunal determines would have been paid to Claimants by Yukos up to the
valuation date but for the expropriation of Yukos; and (3) pre-award simple interest on these

amounts.

1779. By contrast, the Tribunal considers that a potential listing of Yukos on the NYSE and the

benefits that Claimants might have derived from such a listing are too uncertain to be taken into
account for purposes of calculating Claimants’ damages. This element of Claimants’ damages

case is therefore rejected.

1780. The Tribunal also finds that the assessment of Claimants’ damages must be based on their

shareholding in Yukos, without taking into account the potential effects of a completed merger
between Yukos and Sibneft. The Tribunal has not been convinced, on the balance of
probabilities, that in the absence of Respondent’s expropriatory actions, the envisaged merger

would have been completed; indeed, the Tribunal considers that assuming a completed
merger in the “but for” scenario is too speculative. As a consequence, the Tribunal rejects

Claimants’ first damages scenario, notably the valuation of Claimants’ share in YukosSibneft.

1781. Before turning to the calculation of the damages components for the two relevant valuation

2361

2362

dates, the Tribunal explains in the following subsections the methodology it has decided to
adopt for valuing Yukos on each of the given dates, and the basis on which it has determined
the amount of dividends that would likely have been paid to Claimants, in the “but for”

scenario, prior to each of the valuation dates.

See Chapter VIILD.

(a) Valuation of Yukos

1782. As set out earlier in this chapter, for purposes of the damages calculation, the Tribunal has

decided that the relevant valuation dates are the date of the YNG auction and the date of this
Award. However, the starting point for the Tribunal’s analysis must be the calculations done
by Claimants as of their suggested valuation date of 21 November 2007. Claimants have put
forward alternative valuations of Yukos as of that date calculated on the basis of various

valuation methods. These methods and the valuations of Yukos derived from them (in USD

 

 

 

 

billion) are summarized in the following table:°

rata stake in the outstanding shares of Yukos, which were 56.3 percent for Hulley, 2.6 percent for YUL and 11.6
percent for VPL (a total of 70.5 percent for Claimants taken together). All figures are in USD.

contained therein.”

Based on these adjustments, Respondent’s expert arrives—in orally
advancing what “could be” a “useful” evaluation—at a “corrected” enterprise value of Yukos, as
of 21 November 2007, in the amount of USD 67.862 billion.*” Assuming a 90/10 equity/debt
capital structure of Yukos, this corresponds to an equity value of Yukos, as of 21 November

2007, of approximately USD 61.076 billion.”

1784. Having considered the extensive expert evidence presented by Mr. Kaczmarek and Professor

Dow, including the written evidence in the two expert reports that each submitted (with detailed

 

 

panying annexes and appendices), and the testi: that was elicited from them during
the Hearing, the Tribunal concludes, for the reasons set out below, that the “corrected”
comparable companies figure is the best available estimate for what Yukos would have been

worth on 21 November 2007 but for the expropriation.

1785. The Tribunal finds that neither of the other two primary valuation methods put forward by

Claimants is sufficiently reliable to ground a determination of damages for this case. On
balance, the Tribunal was persuaded by Professor Dow’s analysis of Claimants’ DCF model,
and is compelled to agree that little weight should be given to it. The Tribunal observes that
Claimants’ expert admitted at the Hearing that his DCF analysis had been influenced by his

own pre-determined notions as to what would be an appropriate result.”

Similarly, the
Tribunal can put little stock in Claimants’ calculations based on the comparable transactions
method, since both Parties agree that, in fact, there were no comparable transactions,”*”° and

thus no basis that would allow a useful comparison.

1786. As for the remaining valuation methods put forward by Claimants, and the valuations of Yukos

generated by them, the Tribunal notes that Claimants use these secondary valuations primarily
in support of their main valuation. Moreover, some of these figures were only introduced by
Claimants at a very late stage of the proceedings (through demonstrative exhibits at the Hearing

and in Claimants’ Post-Hearing Brief”) and could therefore not be properly addressed by

Second Dow Report § 417.

Respondent. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that none of these secondary valuation methods

can serve as a suitable independent basis for determining the value of Yukos.

1787. By contrast to all of the other methods canvassed above, the Tribunal does have a measure of

confidence in the comparable companies method as a means of determining Yukos’ value.
While Professor Dow stated at the Hearing that he had not performed an analysis sufficient to
fully endorse the figure resulting from his corrections to Claimants’ comparable companies
approach, he agreed that it “could be a useful valuation.”** The Tribunal for its part finds that
the comparable companies method is, in the circumstances, the most tenable approach to
determine Yukos’ value as of 21 November 2007, and therefore the starting point for the

Tribunal’s further analysis.

1788. The next step for the Tribunal consists in determining the value of Yukos as of the relevant

2378

2379

2380

2381

2382

2383

valuation dates by adjusting Yukos’ value as of November 2007 on the basis of the
development of a relevant index. Having considered the various options in this regard, the
Tribunal finds that the RTS Oil and Gas index is the most appropriate index for that purpose.
The RTS Oil and Gas index is based on prices of trades executed in securities admitted to
trading on the Moscow Stock Exchange”*” and presently includes preferred or common shares
of nine Russian oil and gas companies, the most important of which are Gazprom, Lukoil,
Novatek, Rosneft and Surgutneftegas.**° The methodology for establishing the index as well
as its current and historical values are transparent and publicly available on the webpage of the
Moscow Stock Exchange.**' Both Parties have referred to the RTS Oil & Gas index as a
reliable indicator reflecting the changes in the value of Russian oil and gas companies”? and
have used it in their calculations to carry forward certain valuations from one date to

another."

1789. In order to determine the value of Yukos on each of the two valuation dates, the Tribunal will

now adjust Yukos’ value as of 21 November 2007 (USD 61.076 billion) by multiplying it by a
factor that reflects the change in the RTS Oil and Gas index between 21 November 2007 and
each of the two valuation dates. This adjustment factor is calculated and applied for each of the

two valuation dates in subections 5(a) and 5(b) below.

1790. Having explained the Tribunal’s methodology in respect of the first head of damage (the

valuation of Yukos on each of the valuation dates), the Tribunal will now explain the basis on
which it has determined the value of “lost” dividends, namely the dividends that would likely

have been paid to Claimants, in the “but for” scenario, prior to each of the valuation dates.

(b) Valuation of Lost Dividends

1791. A second element of the damages suffered by Claimants as a result of Respondent’s

expropriation of their investment is the loss of dividends that would otherwise have been paid
to them as Yukos shareholders. For each valuation calculated as of the two valuation dates, the
Tribunal must determine the value of the lost dividends up to each date, since the value of
Yukos as of that date, while it captures the expectations of future profit, does not capture any of

the past profit that the company would likely have generated.

1792. The Tribunal recalls that the two valuation dates are the date of the YNG auction (19 December

2004) and the date of this Award (deemed to be 30 June 2014 for valuation purposes). For the
first valuation date, the Tribunal must therefore determine the value of the lost dividends up to
19 December 2004; for the second valuation date, the Tribunal must determine the value of the

lost dividends up to 30 June 2014.

1793. The starting point for the Tribunal’s analysis are the “Yukos lost cash flows” (i.e., free cash

2384

flow to equity) that Claimants’ expert calculated with respect to his valuation of Claimants’
damages. In his first report, Mr. Kaczmarek values Yukos as of 21 November 2007 only, and
therefore produces a model of “lost cash flows” that does not extend beyond that date.”** The
“Jost cash flows” between 2004 and 21 November 2007 are presented as being based on actual

historical information, as opposed to the cash flows included in Mr. Kaczmarek’s DCF model

First Kaczmarek Report, Appendix J.1.

for the period 21 November 2007 through the end of 2015, which are based on forecasts and

projections built up from information available prior to the period.”***

1794. In his second report, Mr. Kaczmarek updates his valuation of Yukos as of November 2007

(including his presentation of “lost cash flows” to that date),”**° but also presents, for the first
time, a valuation of Yukos as of | January 2012 (as a proxy for the valuation of Yukos as of the
date of the Award)."*’ For purposes of the valuation as of 1 January 2012, Mr. Kaczmarek
produces a model of “lost cash flows” that extends from 2004 through to the end of 2011.75
The “lost cash flows” between 2004 and 2011 are presented as being based on actual historical
information, as opposed to the cash flows included in Mr. Kaczmarek’s DCF model for the
period 2012 through the end of 2019, which are based on forecasts and projections built up

from information available prior to the period.”

1795. The Tribunal observes that no free cash flow to equity figures are provided by Claimants’

expert for the years 2012 to 2014. While Claimants offered to update their damages

2 the Tribunal has been able to establish the

calculations at a date closer to the Awari
relevant figures on the basis of Mr. Kaczmarek’s methodology, using data provided elsewhere
in Mr. Kaczmarek’s reports. The Tribunal’s calculations are set out in Tables T4 to T6,

attached to the Award, and explained in greater detail in the following paragraphs.

1796. To calculate Yukos’ free cash flow to equity, Mr. Kaczmarek uses the following formula: Free

2385

2386

2387

2388

2389

2390

2391

2392

cash flow to equity = Free cash flow to the firm — Tax-adjusted interest payments + Change in
net debt + 20 percent of Sibneft dividends.***' Mr. Kaczmarek provides figures regarding the
free cash flow to the firm and the tax-adjusted interest payments for the relevant time period in
Appendix AJ.2 to his second report.” In addition, in note (5) to Appendix AJ.1 to his second

report, Mr. Kaczmarek defines Yukos’ annual change in net debt as the annual change in

Yukos’ long-term debt plus its short-term debt less its cash.?”? Mr. Kaczmarek provides these
figures in Appendix AJ.4 to his second report.*** With regard to the Sibneft dividends,
Mr. Kaczmarek provides figures for years 2004 through 2011 in Appendix AJ.1 to his second
report.*’> For the years 2012 through 2014, the Tribunal has assumed that the Sibneft
dividends would have been equal to those paid in 2010, the last year for which Mr. Kaczmarek
has provided an annual figure (his figure for 2011 being based on annualized third quarter

figures).

1797. With these additional numbers calculated by the Tribunal, on the basis of data and formulas set

out in Mr. Kaczmarek’s reports, the Tribunal is able to arrive at numbers for Yukos’ “lost cash
flows” (i.e., free cash flows to equity) for the entire period extending from 2004 through 2014.
The Tribunal then, in principle, has the input it needs in order to determine the lost dividends
for each of the valuation dates: for the first valuation date (the date of the YNG auction), the
Tribunal can therefore arrive at a value (based on Mr. Kaczmarek’s model) for the lost
dividends up to 19 December 2004; and for the second valuation date (the date of the Award),
the Tribunal can also arrive at a value (based on Mr. Kaczmarek’s model) of the lost dividends
up to 30 June 2014. The Tribunal notes that the total amount of lost dividends, based on
Mr. Kaczmarek’s model, for the period from 2004 to 30 June 2014, is USD 67.213 billion.*”°

1798. As mentioned earlier, however, Claimants’ calculation of Yukos’ lost cash flows is merely a

starting point for the Tribunal’s determination of what it views as the correct estimate of the
dividends that Claimants would have earned from Yukos in the “but for” scenario. As
explained in the following paragraphs, several fundamental considerations lead the Tribunal to

modify the calculations of Claimants’ expert.

1799. Firstly, although Yukos’ lost cash flows determined by Mr. Kaczmarek are based in part on

2393

2394

2395

2396

2397

actual historical information (i.e., largely information about the performance of Yukos’ former

2307

assets disclosed by Rosneft in its financial reports),~”’ the Tribunal is unable to dissociate them

from Claimants’ DCF model, which was convincingly criticized by Respondent’s expert and its

counsel.

1800. In his second report, Professor Dow identifies and explains a “series of errors” embedded in

Claimants’ DCF valuation of Yukos.”***

His “corrections” of those errors result in a very
substantial reduction (51 percent) in the valuation of Yukos generated by the DCF model.
Although not all of those “corrections” apply to the cash flows discussed above, which are
based in part on actual historical information (and thus are not plagued by some of the errors
associated with forecasts and projections), some of the “corrections”—notably those related to
the interpretation of the historical information—in the view of the Tribunal, do impact the cash

flows.

1801. For example, the Tribunal accepts Professor Dow’s opinion that Claimants have underestimated

Yukos’ transportation costs (by implicitly assuming that, in the “but for” scenario, “Yukos
would have been able to capture the efficiencies of Rosneft’s proprietary pipeline network”).””
The Tribunal also accepts Professor Dow’s opinion that Claimants’ model overlooks certain
operating expenses of Yukos, thus evidencing a “basic flaw” in Claimants’ DCF model, namely
that there is “no systematic attempt” to ensure that all of Yukos’ costs have been accounted

2.
for.4°

1802. Although, for the reasons stated above, the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate to accept

2398

2399

2401

all of Professor Dow’s “corrections” for purposes of the valuation of the dividends, the
Tribunal notes that the spreadsheets submitted by Respondent’s expert with his Second Report
allow the Tribunal to calculate “corrected” free cash flow to equity figures for the relevant
years.""' While Respondent’s expert has not explicitly endorsed this “corrected” version as
representing his views with regard to Yukos’ free cash flow to equity, it is evident to the
Tribunal that it represents a figure that is more in line with his views. According to this

“corrected” methodology, Yukos’ dividends in 2004 would have been USD 3.218 billion

(instead of USD 3.645 billion), and the sum of Yukos’ dividends over the period from 2004
through the first half of 2014 would have been USD 49.293 billion (instead of USD 67.213)24

1803. The Tribunal has formed the view that Professor Dow’s corrections, however, do not take into

account all the risks that Yukos would have had to contend with in carrying on business during
the period 2004 through to the present if the company had not been expropriated. The Tribunal
agrees with Respondent that “an expropriation relieves the owner not only of the value of the
asset on the date of expropriation, but also of the risk associated with owning it”?
Accordingly, in any model of the cash flows that would have been generated by Yukos had it
not been expropriated (i.e., the cash flows in a “but for” scenario), it is necessary to take into
account the risks to those cash flows that were eliminated by the expropriation. Those risks

must be factored back into the cash flow model in the “but for” scenario.

1804. The Tribunal observes that Mr. Kaczmarek’s cash flow model does not factor in those risks in

his calculations. To the contrary, Mr. Kaczmarek models Yukos’ financial performance after
the date of expropriation based, in large measure, on the results achieved by Yukos’ assets
in the hands of Rosneft.** As Respondent rightly submits, “Mr. Kaczmarek effectively valued

Yukos as if it were a State-owned strategic enterprise, which it never was.”*"°*

1805. The first significant risk that, in the Tribunal’s view, is not adequately accounted for in the cash

flow models of either expert is the real risk of substantially higher taxes. Since taxes other than
income taxes (also referred to as “non-income taxes”) consistently account for well over
50 percent of Yukos’ net income from year to year,“°° Yukos’ cash flows could be significantly
affected by any increases in the tariffs and rates relating to the non-income taxes.“ In
Mr. Kaczmarek’s model, the taxes that are established annually by legislation (such as the
export customs duty and domestic excise tax for refined products) are based on actual historical
data (if available) and, for the forecast period, are based on the prior year’s tax rate plus an

2408

adjustment to account for annual inflation. In other words, there is no accounting for the

possibility—even likelihood—that had Yukos remained in private hands, the State would have
increased taxes, perhaps even substantially, in order to capture a greater share of the rent earned
from the exploitation of Russia’s natural resources. Yet, the record shows that this is precisely
what the Russian Federation did in 2002 and 2003, when Yukos was still in private hands. In

paragraph 188 of his first report, for example, Mr. Kaczmarek explains that large tax increases

in 2002 and 2003 caused surging profits at Yukos to level off during that period.“

1806. In this connection, the Tribunal notes that Yukos, in its 2002 Annual Report, disclosed the

following concerns about taxation:

We are subject to numerous taxes that have had a significant effect on our results of
operations. Russian tax legislation is and has been subject to varying interpretations and
frequent changes. *4"

In the context of the significant regulatory changes related to Russia’s transition from a
centrally planned to a market economy over the past 10 years and the general instability of
the new market institutions introduced in connection with this transition, taxes, tax rates
and implementation of taxation in Russia have experienced numerous changes. Although
there are signs of improved political stability in Russia, further changes to the tax system
may be introduced which may adversely affect the financial performance of our Company.
In addition, uncertainty related to Russian tax laws exposes us to enforcement measures
and the risk of significant fines and could result in a greater than expected tax burden.”4"!

1807. The 2002 Annual Report also alerted the Yukos shareholders to risks related to the Company’s
dividend policy:

Reserves available for distribution to shareholders are based on the statutory accounting
reports of YUKOS Oil Company, which are prepared in accordance with Regulations on
Accounting and Reporting of the Russian Federation and which differ from U.S. GAAP.
Russian legislation identifies the basis of distribution as net income. For 2002, the current
year statutory net income for YUKOS Oil Company as reported in the annual statutory
accounting reports was RR 40,701 million, However, current legislation and other
statutory laws and regulations dealing with distribution rights are open to legal
interpretation and, consequently, actual distributable reserves may differ from the amount
disclosed.*#*

1808. Finally, and perhaps most significantly, there are the risks associated with the complex and
opaque structure set up by Claimants, or by others on their behalf, in order to transfer money

earned by Yukos out of the Russian Federation through a vast offshore structure. This structure

is well documented in the reports of Professor Lys. An organizational chart attached as an
appendix to a letter from PwC Cyprus to PwC Moscow dated 10 April 2003 shows the
complexity of the structure as of that date, and the fact that Yukos’ control over it was
established by means of call options.”“'? With this structure, Yukos was able to consolidate the
profits of the trading companies and offshore holding companies (entities within its
“consolidation perimeter”) into its results while remaining “free to segregate these profits from
minority shareholder claims whenever it served the majority shareholders’ or management’s

interests.””“"*

1809. As Respondent rightly points out, Yukos’ claim of corporate governance reforms, Western

standards of transparency and protection of minority interests, which Mr. Kaczmarek

2415

highlighted in his first report™ * (and which was a recurring theme heard from Claimants in this

case), “was a fagade.”*"!° Notably, even the company’s President, Mr. Theede, testified that

they had no knowledge that Yukos was using offshore structures that it did not own.”4"”

1810. The Tribunal notes that even after the tax assessments at issue in the present arbitration were

issued, Claimants and their owners were able to divert money earned by Yukos out of Yukos,

and into the two Stichtings,“"*

and therefore away from the tax authorities. The Tribunal cannot
exclude the possibility that, but for the expropriation, the very same mechanism would have
been resorted to by Claimants under different circumstances to divert some of the money

earned by Yukos.

1811. In light of all the circumstances, and taking into account: (a) the figures based on

1812. Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that Yukos’ dividends in 2004 would have been
USD 2.5 billion, and the sum of Yukos’ dividends over the period from 2004 through the first
half of 2014 would have been USD 45 billion.”

5. Application of the Methodology Followed by the Tribunal

1813. The Tribunal, applying the methodology outlined above to the two valuation dates of

19 December 2004 and 30 June 2014, can now proceed to the valuation of the expropriated

company as of those two dates."

2419 The relevant calculations with regard to both dividends and interest are set out in Table T3 attached to this Award.

9 See Table T1 annexed to this Award.

- 560 -

(a) Calculations Based on 19 December 2004 Valuation Date

1814. The damages suffered by Claimants based on a valuation date of 19 December 2004 are

determined as follows.

i. Valuation of Shares in Yukos

1815. As explained earlier, the Tribunal will determine the equity value of Yukos as of 19 December

2004 by adjusting what it considers, based on the Parties’ submissions, to be the best available
estimate of this value as of 21 November 2007, i.e., an amount of USD 61.076 billion, with a
factor that reflects the development of the RTS Oil and Gas index between 19 December 2004
and 21 November 2007. The value of the RTS Oil and Gas index on 19 December 2004 was
92.85, whereas on 21 November 2007 it had a value of 267.8. The adjustment factor to be
applied to determine Yukos’ value as of the earlier date is therefore x=92.85/267.8=0.3467. By
applying this factor to the amount of USD 61.076 billion, the Tribunal arrives at an equity value
of Yukos as of 19 December 2004 in the amount of USD 21.176 billion.””!

1816. The value of Claimants’ 70.5 percent share in Yukos, calculated as a pro rata share of this

amount, corresponds to USD (70.5/100)*21.176=14.929 billion.

ii. Dividends

1817. According to the Tribunal’s methodology outlined above, the dividends that would have been

2421

paid to Yukos’ shareholders throughout 2004 will be assumed to be USD 2.5 billion. Since
the valuation date is 19 December 2004, there are 12 days missing for the full year which
must be taken into consideration. Accordingly, this amount must be multiplied by a factor
x=(365—12)/365, corresponding to approximately 97 percent. This gives a total amount of

ivy. Total Damages Suffered by Claimants

1819. The damages suffered by Claimants due to the breach by Respondent of Article 13 of the ECT

based on a 19 December 2004 valuation date is the sum of the Claimants’ share of these
components calculated above, i.e., 70.5 percent of (21.176 + 2.418 + 7.596), which amounts to
USD 21.988 billion.“

(b) Calculations Based on 2014 Valuation Date

1820. The damages suffered by Claimants based on a valuation date of 30 June 2014 are determined

as follows.

i. Valuation of Claimants’ Share in Yukos

1821. As for the calculations based on the date of the expropriation, the Tribunal will determine the

2422

2423

2404

equity value of Yukos as of 30 June 2014 by adjusting what it considers, based on the Parties’
submissions, the best available estimate of this value as of 21 November 2007, i.e., the amount
of USD 61.076 billion, with a factor that reflects the development of the RTS Oil and Gas
index between 21 November 2007 and 30 June 2014. For practical purposes, and in order to
eliminate the effects of random fluctuations of the index on the amount to be awarded, the
See Part XI. The Tribunal has assumed that dividends would have been paid in each case at the end of the relevant

year and that interest would have started accruing at the determined pre-award interest rate from | January of the year
thereafter.

 

To avoid unnecessarily complicating the calculations, this figure does not take into account interest for the period from
19 to 31 December 2004. Adding this interest would not affect the Tribunal’s conclusions.

See Table Tl annexed to this Award. Claimants’ shareholdings in Yukos, as percentages of Yukos Issued Shares,
were 48.72 percent, 2.25 percent and 10 percent for Hulley, YUL and VPL, respectively. Interim Awards § 419
(Hulley); | 419 (YUL); $419 (VPL). In absolute numbers, out of a total number of 2,236,964,578 Issued Shares,
Hulley held 1,090,043,968 shares, YUL held 50,340,995 shares and VPL held 223,699,175 shares, while 302,000,000
shares were Treasury Shares. First Kaczmarek Report, Appendix C.5.b. This translates into a total number of
1,934,964,578 Outstanding Shares, of which 56.33405 percent, 2.60165 percent and 11.56089 percent were held by
Hulley, YUL and VPL, respectively. The exact combined share of Claimants in Yukos Outstanding Shares was
70.49659 percent.

 

- 562 -

Tribunal has chosen to use the average of the values of the index over the period from
6 January 2014 to 24 June 2014 as the basis for its calculations. This average value of the RTS
Oil and Gas index is 186.90. The adjustment factor to be applied to determine Yukos’ value
as of the later date is therefore x=186.90/267.8=69.79 percent. By applying this factor to the
amount of USD 61.076 billion the Tribunal arrives at an equity value of Yukos as of 30 June
2014 in the amount of USD 42.625 billion.””°

1822. The value of Claimants’ 70.5 percent share in Yukos, calculated as a pro rata share of this

amount, corresponds to USD (70.5/100)*42.625=30.049 billion.

ii. Dividends and Interest on Dividends

1823. According to the Tribunal’s methodology outlined earlier, the dividends that would have been

paid to Yukos’ shareholders from the beginning of 2004 to 30 June 2014 will be assumed to
correspond to USD 45 billion. Together with interest, the total amount for this period is

USD 51.981 billion.“””

1824. Claimants’ share of this amount corresponds to USD (70.5/100)*51.981=36.645 billion.

iii, Total Damages Suffered by Claimants

1825. The damages suffered by Claimants due to the breach by Respondent of Article 13 of the ECT,

based on a valuation date of 30 June 2014, is the sum of the Claimants’ share of the two
components calculated above, i.e., 70.5 percent of (42.625 + 51.981), which amounts to

USD 66.694 billion.“

(c) Comparison of the Results Based on the Two Different Valuation Dates

1826. The total amount of Claimants’ damages based on a valuation date of 19 December 2004 is

USD 21.988 billion, whereas the total amount of their damages based on a valuation date of
30 June 2014 is USD 66.694 billion. Since the Tribunal has concluded earlier that Claimants
are entitled to the higher of these two amounts, the total amount of damages to be awarded

1827. As determined earlier,

before taking into account any deductions necessary as a consequence of Claimants’

contributory fault is USD 66.694 billion.

6. Deductions Due to Claimants’ Contributory Fault

to Claimants will be reduced by

7. Windfall and Double Recovery

1828. The Tribunal sees no reason to make any further deductions beyond those set out above. In

particular, any advantages that Claimants may have obtained through their investments prior to
Respondent’s expropriatory actions can not have any impact on the damages they have

suffered. The Tribunal sees no risk of “double-recovery” in this regard.

1829. Finally, the rate of return that Claimants may realize on their original investment in Yukos as a

result of the damages that the Tribunal has awarded to them for the expropriation of their shares
is irrelevant. It is the value of the expropriated investment on the date of the Award rather than

the amount originally invested by Claimants that is the basis for the calculation of the damages

awarded.
XIII. COSTS
A. INTRODUCTION

1830. The Tribunal notes that Claimants and Respondent have each requested that the opposing party

be ordered to pay the full costs of the arbitration“!

1831. The Tribunal observes that the Treaty contains no provisions on the allocation of the costs of

2429

2430

2431

arbitration in the case of a dispute between an Investor and a Contracting Party.**?
See Section X.E.4.

Claimants shall be paid this amount in proportion to their shareholdings (as to which see n.2424 above) as follows:
EUR 39,971,834,360 (Hulley), EUR 1,846,000,687 (YUL) and EUR 8,203,032,751 (VPL). As per paragraphs 1690-92
above, post-award interest will be due on any outstanding amounts not paid in full within 180 days.

1832. However, Articles 38 to 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules do provide the Tribunal with guidelines

with respect to the allocation of costs in arbitration.
1833. Article 38 defines the “costs of arbitration” as follows:

The arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in its award. The term “costs”
includes only:

(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator and to be
fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 39;

(b) The travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;
(c) The costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral tribunal;

(d) The travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses are approved
by the arbitral tribunal;

(e) The costs for legal representation and assistance of the successful party if such costs
were claimed during the arbitral proceedings, and only to the extent that the arbitral
tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable;

(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the expenses of the
Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague.

1834. Paragraphs | and 2 of Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules set out the guidelines which will

inform the Tribunal in its determination of the apportionment of costs. They read as follows:

1. Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in principle be
borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each
of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable,
taking into account the circumstances of the case.

2. With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in
article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the circumstances
of the case, shall be free to determine which party shall bear such costs or may
apportion such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is
reasonable.

1835. On 18 March 2014, the Tribunal requested the Parties to file their claims for costs with
appropriate schedules by 17 April 2014 and to submit comments on the opposing Party’s claims
by 6 May 2014. The Tribunal wrote:

The Parties are requested to present their claims with schedules showing a breakdown of
costs for legal representation and assistance, including lawyers’ fees, experts’ fees and
other costs associated with presenting their case. The breakdown of lawyers’ fees should
indicate the number of attorneys (together with charge out rates) and the amount of time
involved in the discrete phases of these proceedings (Phase | being the period up to the

 

  

As opposed to the allocation of the c of arbitration in the case of a dispute between Contracting Pat
addressed in Article 27(3)(j) as follows: “The expenses of the tribunal, including the remuneration of
shall be borne in equal shares by the Contracting Parties parties to the dispute. The tribunal may, however, at its
discretion direct that a higher proportion of the costs be paid by one of the Contracting Parties parties to the dispute.”

     

    

 

- 565 -

Interim Awards; Phase 2 being the period after the Interim Awards). It is expected that the
breakdowns should be in sufficient detail for the Tribunal to appreciate the work in respect
of which the costs were incurred.

1836. As requested, the Parties filed their cost claims on 17 April 2014 and submitted comments on

the opposing side’s cost claims on 6 May 2014.

CLAIMANTS’ POSITION

1. Claimants are Entitled to Recover All Costs Incurred in Connection with these
Arbitrations

1837. Claimants note that Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules “establishes two approaches with

respect to costs.”

Firstly, Article 40(1) establishes a “clear presumption” that the losing
party pays all costs referred to in Article 38(a) to (d) and (f)—“loser pays” or “costs follow the
event.”"* Secondly, Article 40(2) requires that, when allocating costs for legal representation

referred to in Article 38(e), tribunals take into account “the circumstances of the case.”

1838. Claimants submit that Respondent should bear all costs set out in Article 38(a) to (d) and (f),

namely the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the PCA (including those of the PCA’s

Secretary-General).

1839. Claimants aver that Respondent was the unsuccessful party in the jurisdiction and admissibility

phase. Claimants assert that they “prevailed on every single issue that was finally decided in

the jurisdiction and admissibility phase of these arbitrations.””*°

They consider that
Respondent should bear the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the PCA related to that

phase.

1840. Claimants submit that they should prevail at the merits stage as well and that Respondent

2433

2434

2435

2436

2437

should bear the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the PCA related to that phase.”4*”

1841. According to Claimants, no circumstances in this case require the Tribunal to depart from the

starting point of “costs follow the event”; to the contrary, they argue, the circumstances in this

« ‘tate” A A 243:
case “only further necessitate” an order of costs in favour of Claimants."

1842. Claimants submit that, taking into account the circumstances of the case—and in particular the
Parties’ success in the arbitrations, their conduct during the proceedings, and the actual
measures of Respondent which gave rise to the dispute—Respondent should bear all of

Claimants’ costs of legal representation and assistance.

1843. Claimants contend that where the investor prevails in an investor-State arbitration, an order that
the State pay the investor’s costs of legal representation is based on the principle of reparation,

which mandates that the investor be fully compensated for its losses, including those incurred

as a result of having to litigate.”

1844. According to Claimants:

In the present case, the Respondent’s approach to these proceedings has been to raise (and
re-raise) as many objections, arguments and issues as possible, no matter how irrelevant or
implausible they may be, in the hopes of delaying the proceedings and somehow burying
or obfuscating the straightforward facts of the case.”

1845. Claimants opine that Respondent’s “obstructionist conduct” in this case should lead the

Tribunal to order it to pay all costs of legal representation."

1846. Claimants submit that “in no other case has the need to take into account the underlying

992442

conduct of the host State been more relevant than in these arbitrations.’ Claimants argue

3. Claimants’ Comments on Respondent’s Submission on Costs

1851. Claimants summarize their comments on Respondent’s Submission on Costs as follows:

Respondent has elected not to provide a “breakdown of costs”, as directed by the Arbitral
Tribunal. Its so-called “Schedule of Costs” cannot in any way facilitate the Tribunal’s task
in reaching its decision on costs, including in assessing the reasonableness of either of the
Parties’ claimed amounts. Moreover, the Respondent’s argument that each Party should
bear its own costs is based on a flawed presentation of investment treaty case law and a
blatantly self-serving description of the Respondent’s conduct throughout these
arbitrations. At the same time, the Respondent’s position speaks volumes as to its true
conviction (or lack thereof) in its defenses to the Claimants’ claims, Had the Respondent
truly believed that the Claimants, Yukos and/or related persons and entities had engaged in
large-scale criminal conduct—ranging from embezzlement and money laundering to tax
fraud and even murder—it would have insisted that its full costs be shouldered by the
Claimants, instead of proposing, as it has done now, that it bear its own costs in defending
the Claimants’ claims.“

1852. Claimants assert that comparing the comprehensive presentation of their costs for legal

2447

2448

2449

2450

representation with Respondent’s “opaque” Schedule of Costs would be “akin to comparing

249 ven then, Claimants maintain that their costs would still be

apples and oranges.
reasonable. In particular, Claimants note that “in ordering respondent States to bear investors’
costs, investment treaty tribunals have found that it is not unusual for claimants’ costs to be
higher than those of respondents, given that, inter alia, the burden of proof generally falls on

claimants.”"*

Cc. RESPONDENT’S POSITION

1. Equal Apportionment is an Appropriate Exercise of the Tribunal’s Discretion on
Costs

1853. Respondent notes that, while Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules states that the costs
referred to in Article 38(a) to (d) and (f) should “in principle be borne by the unsuccessful
party,” it gives the Tribunal the discretion to “apportion each of such costs between the parties
if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the
case.” Respondent asserts that Article 40(2) grants the Tribunal “complete discretion” in its

apportionment of the Parties’ costs of legal representation“!

1854. Respondent argues that the following factors should inform the exercise of the Tribunal’s

discretion:

(a) whether the dispute involved novel and complex questions of law and a long and
complex procedure such that it would be unfair to penalize a non-prevailing party for
maintaining its positions with an adverse costs award;

(b) the constructive and professional conduct of the parties and their positive impact on the
tribunal’s settlement of the dispute, which militates in favor of equal apportionment of
costs;

(c) any bad faith, unreasonable or unnecessarily burdensome conduct of a party for which
the other party should be compensated;

(d) whether the non-prevailing party succeeds in some respects during the arbitration with
legal, factual or procedural arguments, making it inappropriate to award the ultimately
successful party its costs; and

(e) the nature of the dispute resolution mechanism and the traditional position under public
international law and in investor-state arbitration that parties “bear their own costs of
legal representation and assistance.””**?

1855. Respondent submits that, in light of the above-mentioned factors, the “appropriate approach

here is for each side to bear its own costs.”"4*} Further:

If, in the exercise of its discretion, the Tribunal decides that equal apportionment of costs
in these cases is not appropriate, and that the costs incurred by the prevailing party should
be borne by the unsuccessful party, Respondent would then request that Claimants should
bear Respondent's costs based upon the relative success of the parties in these arbitrations
on issues of jurisdiction, the merits and Claimants’ demand for damages. It is clear from

misrepresentations of Claimants include: Claimants’ “continued disregard for the ECtHR’s
unanimous rejections of the essential premise for Claimants’ contentions here,”****
“misrepresentation that Respondent abandoned its unclean hands — defense,”***°

TRIBUNAL’S DECISION ON COSTS

1. Fixing and Allocation of Costs of the Arbitration Pursuant to Article 40(1) of the
UNCITRAL Rules

1859. The Parties deposited with the PCA a total of EUR 8,440,000 to cover the costs of the

arbitration; EUR 4,240,000 by Claimants and EUR 4,200,000 by Respondent.** In
determining the amount of its members’ fees, the Tribunal has taken account of Article 39(1) of
the UNCITRAL Rules, pursuant to which “[t]he fees and expenses of the arbitral tribunal shall
be reasonable in amount, taking into account the amount in dispute, the complexity of the
subject matter, the time spent by the arbitrators and any other relevant circumstances of the

case.”

1860. The fees of Mr. Daniel Price, the arbitrator initially appointed by Claimants, amount to

EUR 103,537.50. Mr. Price’s expenses amount to EUR 3,678.99. The fees of Dr. Charles
Poncet, the arbitrator appointed by Claimants following the resignation of Mr. Price, amount to

EUR 1,513,880. Dr. Poncet’s expenses amount to EUR 85,549.64.

1861. The fees of Judge Stephen M. Schwebel, the arbitrator appointed by Respondent, amount to

EUR 2,011,092.66. His expenses amount to EUR 51,927.29.

1862. The fees of The Hon. L. Yves Fortier, PC CC OQ QC, the Chairman, amount to

EUR 1,732,937.50. The Chairman’s expenses amount to EUR 51,782.24.

1863. The fees of Mr. Martin J. Valasek, the Assistant to the Tribunal, amount to EUR 970,562.50.

Mr. Valasek’s expenses amount to EUR 51,718.96.

1864. Pursuant to the Terms of Appointment and the agreement of the Parties, the PCA Secretary-

Over the course of the proceedings, the Parties contributed in equal shares to the deposits. In July 2014, the Tribunal
requested a final supplementary deposit of EUR 40,000 and invited either Party to cover the full amount in advance of
issuance of the Final Awards, which Claimants accepted to do.

designated to act as Registry in these arbitrations. The PCA’s fees for its services amount to

EUR 866,552.60.

1865. Other tribunal costs, including court reporters, interpreters, hearing rooms, meeting facilities,
travel and all other expenses relating to the arbitration proceedings, amount to

EUR 996,780.12.

1866. Accordingly, the costs of the arbitration, including all items set out in paragraphs (a), (b), (c),
(d) and (f) of Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules, amount to EUR 8,440,000 for the

jurisdiction and merit phases.
1867. The Tribunal recalls again the terms of Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules:

Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in principle be borne by the
unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs
between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account
the circumstances of the case.

1868. The costs are therefore to be awarded to the successful party and against the unsuccessful party,

unless the circumstances of the case justify a different approach.

1869. In the present proceedings, it is clear that Claimants have prevailed and been successful in both
the jurisdiction and merits phases. The Tribunal can see no reason why Respondent, the
unsuccessful party, should not bear the costs of the arbitration, EUR 8,440,000, and it so orders
Respondent to bear such costs and to reimburse the contributions that Claimants deposited in

the amount of EUR 4,240,000.

1870. There is no unexpended balance on deposit.

2. Fixing and Allocation of Costs for Legal Representation and Assistance of the
Parties Pursuant to Article 40(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules

1871. The Tribunal recalls again the terms of Article 40(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules:

 

With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in article 38,
paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the circumstances of the case, shall
be free to determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs between
the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable.
*64 Claimants shall be paid this amount in proportion to their shareholdings (as to which see n.2424 above) as follows:
EUR 3,388,197 (Hulley), EUR 156,476 (YUL) and EUR 695,327 (VPL). As per paragraphs 1690-92 above,
post-award interest will be due on any outstanding amounts not paid in full within 180 days.

Paragraph (e) of Article 38 provides that the term “costs” includes:

The costs for legal representation and assistance of the successful party if such costs were
claimed during the arbitral proceedings, and only to the extent that the arbitral tribunal
determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable.

The Tribunal observes that Claimants’ costs for their legal representation and the assistance of
their experts amount to USD 79,628,055.56 plus an additional GBP 1,066,462.10, which,

Claimants submit, are “reasonable” taking into account the circumstances of the case.

Respondent, on the other hand, provides the Tribunal with a schedule indicating the “types of
costs” incurred by Respondent in its defence. It presents a “total” figure of USD 27,000,000
which does not adequately assist the Tribunal in assessing the reasonableness of the Parties’

respective costs.

3. Conclusion on the Award of Costs

It is well established that an UNCITRAL tribunal such as the present one has the unfettered
discretion to fix and to decide in what proportion the costs for legal representation and

assistance of the parties shall be borne by the Parties.

In the present case, the Tribunal has formed the view that Claimants, the successful Party,
should be awarded a significant portion of their costs of legal representation and assistance.
The Tribunal now has to determine the portion which it considers reasonable. In determining
this reasonable portion, the Tribunal takes into account a number of relevant factors. The
Tribunal will now proceed to review some of the factors which it considers particularly relevant

in the instant case.

Claimants, in their prayer for relief, asked the Tribunal to order Respondent to pay to Claimants

damages of more than USD 100 billion.

The stakes were high and, if Claimants were thorough and vigorous in pressing their claims,

Respondent was no less thorough and vigorous in presenting its defences.

The thousands of pages of written pleadings and exhibits submitted by the Parties, the myriad
requests for production of documents, the Tribunal’s lengthy procedural orders, the ten days of
hearings in The Hague in the fall of 2008 on Respondent’s objections to jurisdiction and
admissibility, the 21 days of Hearings on the Merits in The Hague in the fall of 2013, all

demonstrate the importance which both sides attached to this arbitration.

- 576 -

1880. The Parties litigated vigorously. Each Party was represented by eminent counsel. The quality
of the written and oral pleadings was outstanding. Counsel of both Parties are commended for

their high professionalism.

1881. In the circumstances, it is unsurprising that the cost submissions of the Parties, as to their
amounts, should reflect the very considerable work which each Party was required to expend in

order to, on the one hand, press its claims and, on the other hand, defend itself.

1882. It also is not surprising that Claimants’ costs in this case should be higher than those of
Respondent since they bore the burden of proof for their claims under the ECT and produced

many fact witnesses in the Hearing on the Merits whereas Respondent produced no fact witness.

1883. However, the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that some of the fees of Claimants’ experts are

“plainly excessive”.

1884. Another factor which the Tribunal considers relevant in fixing the costs of Claimants which
should be borne by Respondent is the fact that, at the end of the day, Claimants’ experts were of

limited assistance to the Tribunal in its determination of Claimants’ damages.

1885. Even if Claimants were successful in asserting the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over Respondent, in
prevailing on the liability of Respondent and being awarded an immense sum in damages, at the
end of the day, as was seen in Part XII, the damages awarded to Claimants were reduced

significantly by the Tribunal from the claims advanced by them.

1886. Finally, a factor which the Tribunal has considered particularly relevant in fixing the portion of
their costs which Claimants should be awarded is the egregious nature of many measures of

Respondent which the Tribunal has found were in breach of the ECT.

1887. Having scrutinized the costs for legal representation and assistance of Claimants and taking into
consideration all the factors traversed above, the Tribunal, in the exercise of its discretion,
considers that reimbursement by Respondent to Claimants of USD 60,000,000 as part of their
costs would be fair and reasonable in the circumstances and it so orders.“ The Tribunal notes
that USD 60,000,000 is approximately 75 percent of Claimants’ grand total of costs for the
jurisdiction and merits phases, namely USD 79,628,055.56 and GBP 1,066,462.10.

2465

 

Claimants shall be paid this amount in proportion to their shareholdings (as to which see n.2424 above) as follows:
EUR 47,946,190 (Hulley), EUR 2,214,277 (YUL) and EUR 9,839,533 (VPL). As per paragraphs 1690-92 above,
post-award interest will be due on any outstanding amounts not paid in full within 180 days.
