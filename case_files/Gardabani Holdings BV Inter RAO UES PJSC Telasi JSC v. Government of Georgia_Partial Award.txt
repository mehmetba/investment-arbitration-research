Cc. THE COORDINATED SCC AND ICSID PROCEEDINGS

31. By the Parties’ joint letters of 14 February 2018, the Parties informed ICSID and the SCC
that they agreed to coordinate the two proceedings Gardabani Holdings B.V. and Silk Road
Holdings B.V. v. Georgia (ICSID Case No. ARB/17/29) and Gardabani Holdings BV.
(Netherlands), PJSC Inter RAO (Russia) and Telasi (Georgia) v. Government of Georgia, Ministry
of Economy and Sustainable Development of Georgia, State Service Bureau Ltd (SCC Case No.

V2017/097). The Parties reached the following agreement on the coordination of the arbitrations:

(i) Whereas the two arbitrations will remain separate proceedings, the
Parties wish for a single tribunal composed of Mr. Zachary Douglas QC
(appointed by the Respondents), Mr. Stanimir Alexandrov (appointed by
the Claimants) and Mr. Henri Alvarez (as chair) (the “Tribunal”) to hear
all claims, and hope that they, as well as the SCC and ICSID, will be
amenable to this proposal;

Page 8
SCC Arbitration V2018/039; ICSID Case No. ADM/18/1
Partial Award 19 April 2021

(ii) The two proceedings shall share a single evidentiary record, a single
set of briefings, a single hearing, and a unified procedural timetable;

(iii) Whenever reasonable to do so, and unless prohibited by or
inconsistent with the applicable arbitration rules or law, the Tribunal
shall issue single procedural orders, decisions or communications,
indicating both proceedings in the cover page of any such procedural
order, decision or communication;

 

(iv) The Tribunal shall render two separate awards;

(v) The Parties wish to express their gratitude to Professor Tercier and
Professor Grigera Naon for their service on their respective tribunals. The
fees and costs of Professor Tercier and Professor Grigera Naon will be
borne equally by the Parties, subject to the Tribunal’s final allocation of
costs in the coordinated proceedings;

(vi) As regards the appointment of Messrs. Douglas, Alexandrov and
Alvarez, the Parties have reached their agreement on the assumption that,
since the separation of the two proceedings is only formal, they would
charge their fees and expenses as if this were a single proceeding, save as
where necessary and reasonable, and that the two institutions will
cooperate in implementing this arrangement.?

32. On 16 February 2018, pursuant to Arbitration Rule 10(1), ICSID informed the Parties of
its receipt of Professor Horacio Grigera Naon’s resignation in the ICSID proceeding. In accordance
with Arbitration Rule 10(2), the ICSID proceeding was suspended until the vacancy resulting from

Professor Grigera Naon’s resignation had been filled.

33. On 20 February 2018, ICSID notified the Parties, pursuant to Arbitration Rule 8(2), Mr.
Alvarez and Professor Douglas had consented to Professor Grigera Na6n’s resignation in the
ICSID proceeding. In accordance with Arbitration Rule 11, the Claimants were invited to appoint

an arbitrator to fill the vacancy.

34, On 26 February 2018, ICSID informed the ICSID Parties that Professor Stanimir
Alexandrov had accepted his appointment as arbitrator appointed by the Claimants. On the same

date, the ICSID proceeding resumed in accordance with Arbitration Rule 12.

Iv. FACTUAL OVERVIEW
A. OVERVIEW OF GEORGIA’S ELECTRICITY SECTOR

65. Since its independence in 1991 after the collapse of the Soviet Union until 2003, the
electricity sector in Georgia has transitioned from a Soviet era state-owned monopoly system to a

liberalized system which sought to separate the different activities in the electricity supply chain

Page 17
SCC Arbitration V2018/039; ICSID Case No. ADM/18/1
Partial Award 19 April 2021

(transmission, distribution, and generation). During this period, a new legal and regulatory
framework was established for Georgia’s electricity sector.'! Telasi provided electricity during

this phase, but widespread shortages were common.

66. Georgia’s early efforts in the late 1990s to modernize and liberalize its energy sector
included privatizing its electricity system by selling a majority share in Telasi to an American
company, AES (discussed under Section B below), transferring the management of other
distribution companies to another American company, and bringing in other foreign companies to
manage transmission as well as wholesale electricity market operators.'* Concurrently, Georgia
also sought to strengthen its economic links with the European Union (“EU”) and, in 1996,
Georgia entered into a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement aimed at fostering cooperation
with the then European Community to transition Georgia into a market economy.!? While these
efforts improved Georgia’s power sector, by 2003 power cuts were still commonplace and further
privatization was needed to rehabilitate State-owned electricity generation, transmission and

distribution assets. '4

67. Georgia’s 1999 Law on Electricity and Natural Gas (the “Law on Electricity”) defines the
legal framework for water, electricity and natural gas production and distribution in Georgia.!°
The Law on Electricity allocated the ownership, commercial and regulatory functions in the power
sector between the Ministry of Energy (“MOE”) and what would later become the Georgian

National Energy and Water Supply Regulatory Commission (“NERC”).

68. The MOE develops national policy in the energy sector and promotes investments in that
sector, but does not implement ownership, regulatory and operational-economic activities in the

electricity sector.!°

69. The Law on Electricity establishes general principles for setting tariffs that “protect
consumers from monopoly tariffs and promote long-term financial stability and development of
the energy sector”, and calls for the adoption of secondary legislation to elaborate specifics.'” The
law gives NERC exclusive competence to adopt tariff-setting methodologies and set tariffs in

accordance with those methodologies. !*

70. | NERC is an independent body whose role, organization, powers and price-setting authority
are governed by the Law on Independent Regulatory Authorities (“Law on INRAs”) and its own
Charter.!? NERC is headed by a chairperson and four commissioners who adopt decisions and
resolutions by majority vote regarding the issuing and revoking of licenses, developing and
adopting tariff methodologies, setting and regulating tariffs, and settling disputes between market
participants.”° Its decisions, which must include written reasons and be published, are regulated

by the General Administrative Code of Georgia (““GACG”), and are subject to judicial review.”!

71. In respect of NERC’s competence to adopt and apply tariff-setting methodologies, Article
11(1) of the Law on Electricity was amended in July 2010 to provide that

NERC shall follow the basic directions of national policy in the energy,
security, economy, environmental protection and other areas and the
normative acts issued on the basis of these directions. [NERC] may also
take into account the transactions entered into by the State in the energy
and water supply sectors, and other relevant legal acts.”

72. NERC is one of two independent regulatory authorities operating in Georgia.”> The Law

on INRAs establishes NERC’s “independence ... from political pressure of any kind, from

the ability of both an independent regulatory Authority and the
Commissioner, without improper influence and illegal interference to
exercise the authority of a regulatory Authority as determined under the
applicable law, including discussing, investigating and deciding the
matters assigned to its authority; any interference in the activities of an
independent regulatory Authority, control of the said activities and
demanding accounts of such activities on the part of any State Authority
shall be inadmissible, if this is not explicitly provided for by the applicable
Taw.?*

 

Article 6, “Independence”, provides as follows:

1. Independent regulatory Authority and Commissioner shall be
independent within the scope of their activities and shall comply only with
the Georgian Legislation. Only an independent regulatory Authority shall
have the right to exercise the full authority in respect to the matters which
are delegated to it under the applicable law.

2. Dual, concurrent regulatory authority shall be inadmissible.

3. Any attempt of any person to exercise the jurisdiction over the sphere
of authority of an Independent Regulatory Authority shall be illegal, and
the results thereof shall be of no legal force.

5. It shall be inadmissible for an Independent Regulatory Authority to
conclude any agreement which imposes certain obligations on Georgia,
except for the cases as provided for in the Georgian Legislation.”

72. In addition to overseeing the tariffs that distribution companies can charge, controlling the
issuance of generation and distribution licenses, and setting the fees for connecting new users to
the distribution network, NERC also produces an annual energy plan of how much energy each
distribution company will acquire from each generator on a month-to-month basis over the course
of a year (“NERC’s Annual Energy Plan”). The plan is based on the “Annual Electricity
Balance” prepared by the Georgian State Electrosystem (“GSE”) before the start of each year, and

approved by the MOE. It includes a general forecast of the output of each generating plant, an

Organization of Georgia’s Electricity Sector

The basic elements of Georgia’s electricity supply chain consist of:?*

generation of electricity by power plants

- there are over 80 State-owned and privately-owned generation companies; 80% of
which are hydropower plants (“HPPs”), 20% are thermal power plants (“TPPs”)”?

transmission of electricity into the distribution network

distribution of electricity to final consumers

- until 2017, there were three distributors: Telasi, which supplied Tbilisi; Kakheti
Energy Distribution (“Kakheti”), which supplied the eastern region of Kakheti; and
Energo-Pro Georgia (“Energo-Pro”), which supplied electricity to the rest of
Georgia

- in 2017, Energo-Pro acquired Kakheti

- today, Telasi has a 35% market share and Energo-Pro holds the remaining 65%

sale of electricity to final consumers

- sales are vertically integrated with distribution, meaning that the same operators
distribute and supply electricity to end consumers, with the exception of some large
consumers who may buy electricity directly from power generators

trade of electricity produced by generators and imported from other countries on the

wholesale market

- operated by the Electricity System Commercial Operator (“ESCO”), which is also
known as the Commercial Operator of Power System (“COPS”). ESCO/COPS

balances the electricity on the market by trading the volume of electricity delivered

Respondents’ Counter-Memorial, 4] 22-28; Moselle I, Figure | at p. 29.
Most HPPs depend on the amount of water flowing through rivers, which is at its lowest in winter when electricity
consumption is at its highest, which in turn leads to electricity shortages that are serviced by TPPs and imports
from neighboring countries, primarily Russia. During spring and summer, Georgia exports its surplus electricity
to Turkey (Respondents’ Counter-Memorial, § 23).

into the network by generators and importers which is not purchased under direct
agreements with distributors.
75. In the electricity sector, transmission and distribution are natural monopolies and are
typically regulated to avoid the risk of them charging excess prices to the detriment of consumers,

whereas generation activities are competitive.*°
76. Telasi is both a distributor and a supplier of electricity.

77. ESCO/COPS is the State-owned company responsible for operating Georgia’s electricity
market. It also purchases and sells left over electricity that has not been directly contracted for, at
tariffs which depend on the amount of electricity it buys and sells, and on market conditions.*! The
price at which ESCO/COPS sells its electricity is usually higher than that of generation companies

such as the Khrami Companies.

78. Georgia owns the two largest HPPs, Enguri HPP LLC (“Enguri”) and Vardnili HPP
Cascade (“Vardnili’”), which produce the cheapest electricity in Georgia. They are required to
supply electricity to the occupied territories in Abkhazia.*? Enguri alone produces 31% of the total
generation capacity in Georgia. In comparison, the Khrami Companies produce 7% of Georgia’s

generation capacity.**

79. The GSE is the transmission system operator (“TSO”) responsible for ensuring the
functioning of the electricity system. The GSE prepares the Annual Electricity Balance which
forecasts the supply and demand of electricity in a given year for the MOE’s approval. The GSE
also assists ESCO/COPS in balancing the electricity on the market. Energy supply agreements

between generators (sellers) and distributors (buyers) must be registered with the GSE.

2) Georgia’s Tariff System
80. | NERC regulates the rates that can be charged by each company for the sale of the energy
it generates, known as the “Generation Tariffs”. Generation Tariffs are intended to cover the

generation and operating costs and capital expenditures of the company, plus a profit component.

81. For distribution companies, NERC regulates the following three types of interrelated
tariffs.
82. The “Consumer Tariffs” are the rates that a distribution company can charge to its

customers and which form the revenue component of a distribution company’s business. A
distributor’s Consumer Tariffs effectively comprise the sum of the WAPT and the Distribution

Tariff, both discussed next.

83. The Weighted Average Purchase Tariff (“WAPT”) is a distribution company’s weighted
average annual cost per kilo watt hour (“kWh”) of purchasing energy from generation companies.
It constitutes the primary purchase cost component of a distribution company’s business and is a
function of the sources from which a distribution company purchases energy. The allocation of
energy purchases from different generators to a distributor is referred to as the “purchase
portfolio”. Since the cost of energy differs from generator to generator (i.e. depending on whether
they are HPPs or TPPs), each distributor’s purchase portfolio will include a combination of more
and less expensive sources of energy for the year. NERC’s Annual Energy Plan for each
distribution company identifies, for each month, the generation companies from which a particular
distribution company must purchase electricity, and in what volumes. The Claimants say that

NERC effectively controls the WAPT of each distribution company.**

84. The Claimants explain that the “Distribution Tariff” (or “Distribution Margin”) is the
difference between the amount the distributor pays to acquire electricity it is going to distribute
and the amount it can charge its customers, which results in the profit.*> It is computed for different
voltage levels as the distributor’s forecast per unit cost, calculated on a regulated basis. NERC’s

methodology in force at any given point provides guidelines as to how to compute each component

of the total costs (including capital and operational expenses, normative losses and corrections
adjusted for time value of money) and expected distributed amounts of electricity for each group
of consumers. The Distribution Tariffs represent a distribution company’s margin on a tetri per

kWh basis,*° as opposed to the rates charged to customers.

85. The Claimants’ economic experts summarize the relationship between the different tariffs

as follows:*”

86. The Respondents’ damages expert summarizes the building blocks of the Consumer Tariff

as follows:°*

since 1995.

87. When NERC sets a particular tariff, the market participant might be charged more or less
than that amount, and it can be temporarily adjusted upon the occurrence of a previously agreed

trigger.

88. The Claimants say that because NERC can set tariffs and control the actual WAPT, it

controls the financial viability of energy generation and distribution companies in Georgia.”

89. Distribution companies’ (and generation companies’)*” purchase portfolios are set as

follows:

e Before the start of each year, the GSE prepares, and the MOE approves, the Annual
Electricity Balance (described above at paragraph 74). Based on the Annual Electricity
Balance, the NERC prepares its Annual Energy Plan. In practice, NERC’s Annual
Energy Plan forms the basis of the GSE’s daily and hourly planning and is used to
match supply and demand on a real-time basis. It also informs the GSE’s decisions to

approve energy supply agreements between generation companies.*! The Claimants

3° Claimants’ Memorial, 421.

The Claimants say that the manner in which a generation company’s electricity output is assigned to distribution
companies as part of NERC’s Annual Energy Plan, and implemented through supply contracts executed through
the ESCO/COPS, determines its revenue (Claimants’ Memorial, § 23).

! CL-0073 / RL-0001, Law on Electricity, Arts. 23.2, 35(3)(a), 35(3)(c).

say the NERC’s Annual Energy Plan informs the decisions of distribution companies
and the ESCO/COPS regarding the allocation of energy from suppliers to distributors.”

e Based on NERC’s Annual Energy Plan, the NERC calculates tariffs for each distributor
predicting an annual WAPT and Distribution Tariff. A company’s WAPT, as planned
by the NERC, is intended to reflect the annual average costs expected to be incurred
when purchasing energy. Each distribution company has a different WAPT, since its
purchase portfolio contains a unique mix of energy from various generators at different
tariffs.

e Next, a distribution company (i.e. Telasi) concludes electricity supply agreements
directly with generators. Agreements are concluded on the basis of NERC’s Annual
Energy Plan and informal discussions with the ESCO/COPS as to the volume of energy
it can receive from a particular generation company.**

¢ The agreements come into effect only upon registration by the GSE.*

e In the event that not all of a distribution company’s electricity needs are met by its
direct agreements with generation companies, the distribution company will acquire
those additional volumes from the ESCO/COPS at a higher tariff.*°

e Finally, the actual delivery of energy to a distribution company is determined on a
monthly basis by the ESCO/COPS. The ESCO/COPS determines how much energy
was received by a distribution company in a given month from each generator with
whom the company has a supply agreement. Any portion of a distribution company’s
monthly supply of energy that has not been supplied under direct contracts with

generators is deemed to have been acquired from the ESCO/COPS at its tariff.*”

Claimants’ Memorial, § 22(f): Claimants say this is consistent with the ESCO/COPS’s role as the balancing and
clearing entity for the energy market. If a distributor needs more electricity than has been planned for in its
purchase portfolio (such as if a generator under-performs or because new consumers connect to its network), in
practice it can only acquire additional electricity from the ESCO/COPS, or directly from a generator if the contract
is registered with the GSE.

The Claimants say that when a distribution company receives energy, it cannot know
from which generation companies it will be deemed to have received power for the
purposes of monthly accounts. The ESCO/COPS informs each distributor after the fact
which generators actually supplied energy to it in the previous month, in what volume
and at what tariff. Monthly “acts of acceptance” signed between distributors and
generators (and, to the extent applicable, the ESCO/COPS) confirm electricity volumes
supplied.*®

The volume of energy actually provided by various generators (as allocated by the
ESCO/COPS) may differ from the projected volume that formed the basis for
calculating a company’s WAPT. This occurs for a number of reasons, such as the
reallocation of inexpensive energy to other distribution companies and/or for export,
unplanned increases of generation tariffs, and technical breakdowns in energy supply.”
Consequently, a distribution company’s actual WAPT may exceed its planned WAPT,

reducing its Distribution Tariff (or Distribution Margin).

THE TELASI SPA: AES’s INITIAL ACQUISITION OF TELASI AND MANAGEMENT RIGHTS
TO THE KHRAMI COMPANIES

Telasi was established in 1995 as a Georgian joint stock company. Telasi is now the

second-largest distribution company of the three operators in Georgia, and covers Tbilisi and the

surrounding urban areas. From 1995 to 1998, it was State-owned. In December 1998, the

Government began privatizing distribution companies and power plants. The sale of Telasi in 1998

to an American corporation marked the first major privatization in the Georgian electricity sector.
Pursuant to a share purchase agreement, AES Silk Road Holdings B.V. (“AES”) acquired 75% of
the shares of Telasi (the “Telasi SPA”).*°

91. On the same date, NERC issued a resolution regarding the approval of methodology, rules

and procedures of setting electricity tariffs (“1998 Methodology”).*!

92. In 1999, AES also acquired the management rights for the Khrami Companies for 25 years
(the “Khrami Management Agreement”).** In 2003, AES changed its name to Silk Road
Holdings B.V., after being acquired by the Inter RAO group.

93. By 2003, AES had rehabilitated Telasi from its former state, but had not improved the
condition of Khrami Companies. The Respondents explain that when AES first took over the
management of the Khrami Companies in 1999, Khrami-2 required extensive repair in order to
operate at full capacity. To support the rehabilitation of Khrami-2, Georgia transferred its Japanese

bank lo: i iii i © AES on the condition that AES would repay

them by 2025 (by the end of the 25-year Khrami Management Agreement).*?

C. INTER RAO’s 2003 ACQUISITION OF TELASI AND MANAGEMENT RIGHTS FOR THE
KHRAMI COMPANIES

94. Pursuant to a sale and purchase agreement in 2003, Inter RAO acquired 100% of AES’s

Georgian Operations, which included:
e AES’s 75% indirect interest in Telasi;**

e the shares of AES Georgia, which held management rights for the Khrami Companies

95. At the time that Inter RAO acquired AES’s existing operations in 2003, electricity

consumption tariffs were significantly higher than those in Russia. Representatives of Inter RAO

 

stated that they assumed they would be able to substantially reduce these tariffs

96. In January 2004 (six-months after Inter RAO acquired Telasi and management rights to the
Khrami Companies), a new government was elected in Georgia. It made year-round electricity

supply a priority. In this regard, the new Government concluded an Agreement with Inter RAO

FD The Government also entered into an Agreement with Telasi and

Mtkvari-Energy LLC to improve the operation of the Georgian power system and provide a safe
power supply to the city of Tbilisi, pursuant to which Telasi would receive a monthly credit to
purchase electricity from domestic sources, including the Khrami Companies, and Telasi would
sign contracts for the purchase of electricity and ensure the importation of electricity from Russia
and Armenia as required to ensure uninterrupted power supply to the City of Tbilisi.*’ The
Government also entered into a Memorandum with JSC Khrami-2 (“Khrami-2”), and others to

support the rehabilitation of two turbines owned by Khrami-2 by way of loans at preferred rates.**

97. It appears that the Government planned to improve the reliability of the supply of electricity

and, for the first time, the supply of electricity was uninterrupted during the winter of 2005-2006.*°

98. At the time that Inter RAO acquired AES’s existing operations in 2003, the Telasi SPA
and Khrami Management Agreement, which continued to govern the relationship between the

Parties, had not been modified since their conclusion in 1998 and 1999, respectively.% Under the

103. In late 2005, NERC undertook a comprehensive review of electricity tariffs and, on 31
January 2006, it established an electricity working group tasked with formulating a new tariff

system in the long-term, and for February-April 2006 in the short term.

104. In April 2006, Telasi applied to NERC for a 12 tetri/kWh upward adjustment of its

Distribution lif ii _ _ to recover losses incurred between 1999

105. In May 2006, NERC held a public hearing to discuss the results of its tariff system revision
and Telasi’s application. NERC noted the “necessity of adjusting the entire tariff system” due to:
(i) increased Russian gas prices, which resulted in a 35% rise in the average cost of gas-fired TPP
generated electricity in Georgia; (ii) an “increase of the expensive power share in the [electricity]
balance” caused by 24-hour electricity supply; and (iii) an increase in the cost of electricity
produced by the six HPPs that had submitted tariff applications due to “wage growths”,
“revaluation of fixed assets” and “raised prices on materials”. The NERC stated that these

changes had resulted in a 61% increase in the WAPT paid by distribution companies to generation

106. Later in May 2006, the NERC issued Resolution No. 18 (the “2006 Tariff Resolution”),
wherein it granted to Telasi a 2 tetri/kWh increase (of the 12 tetri/kWh tariff increase requested in
Telasi’s tariff adjustment application), which raised its Distribution Tariff to 7.89 tetri/kWh,
effective 1 June 2006. ’* The NERC found that it was necessary to increase Telasi’s Distribution
Tariff to allow Telasi to recover GEL 22 million in losses in 2005-2006 due to a VAT change,
investments in Telasi’s power grid between 2002 and 2005, GEL 20 million in other investments

to be made by Telasi between 2006 and 2008, and to account for the temporary reduction of

Telasi’s Distribution Tariff imposed by NERC in 2003.” Ee

118. On 8 November 2007, the Government transmitted the 2007 Memorandum to the NERC
for its consideration of the long-term Distribution Tariffs and adjustment provisions and to “make
the relevant decision”.**

119. On 6 August 2008, pursuant to Article 11.1 of the Law on Electricity, the Government
resolved to introduce predefined long-term marginal and/or fixed electricity tariffs and that, “...it
shall be considered expedient to introduce predefined long-term marginal and/or fixed tariffs in
the energy sector in order to promote investments and create stable investment environment. For
this purpose, contractual obligations undertaken by the state in relation to energy facilities and
other relevant legal acts shall also be taken into account.”*? According to a. this
resolution “simply grant[ed] the NERC discretion to take such contractual tariff arrangements into

account in setting tariffs.

120. Georgia and Inter RAO continued to meet regularly in the context of the task force set up
under the 2007 Memorandum to monitor the implementation of the Parties’ respective

obligations.*!
F. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE 2007 MEMORANDUM: NERC RESOLUTION NO. 33

121. In September 2008, the NERC considered that the 2007 Memorandum was in line with the
interests of both distribution companies and consumers and approved and extended the
Distribution Tariff of 7.89 tetri/kWh provided in the 2006 Tariff Resolution and the 2007
Memorandum until 1 September 2015 and implemented the other provisions of the 2007
Memorandum.” In December 2008, the NERC reconfirmed the tariffs agreed by the Parties under

the 2007 Memorandum, which had first been confirmed in September 2008, in a consolidated

88 Government Decree No. 654, 8 November 2007, R-0016.

J. IMPLEMENTATION OF TELASI AND THE KHRAMI COMPANIES’ TARIFFS UNDER THE 2011
MEMORANDUM AND THE KHRAMI SPA: NERC RESOLUTION No. 5

143. On7 April 2011, NERC issued a resolution amending Resolution No. 33 which had set
long-term tariffs and adjustment mechanisms applicable to both Telasi and the Khrami Companies
(“NERC Resolution No. 5”). NERC Resolution No. 5 set the Khrami Companies’ tariffs as agreed
in the 2011 Memorandum (and the Khrami SPA) and their adjustment conditions. '*> This occurred
one week after the 2011 Memorandum was signed on 31 March 2011, and less than a week before

the Khrami SPA was signed.

Po As it had done with the 2007 Memorandum

pursuant to Resolution No. 33, the NERC through its Resolution No. 5 implemented the agreed

tariffs and adjustment mechanisms for the Khrami Companies and Telasi set out in the 2011

Methodology”).'2”

146. Like the 1998 Methodology before it, the 2011 Methodology was not relevant for Telasi

and the Khrami Companies because the Parties’ recently agreed tariff scheme in the 2011

Memorandum and the Khrami SPA, implemented by NERC Resolution No. 5 continued to apply.

Article 27 of the 2011 Methodology (entitled “Transitional Provision”) provided as follows:

The conditions defined by this methodology shall not apply to enterprises
(before the expiration of the period of validity of the tariff), for which long-
term tariffs were set based on transactions concluded by the state.

147. The Parties agree that Article 27 means that companies, such as Telasi and the Khrami
Companies, which had reached specific tariff agreements with the Government, such as like the
2011 Memorandum and Khrami SPA, were excluded from the scope of the 2011 Methodology’s

application.

148. The Parties’ positions differ as to whether the same applied for the 2013 Memorandum,
discussed below, which was concluded while the 2011 Methodology was still in effect. The
Claimants say Article 27 of the 2011 Methodology means that the 2013 Memorandum governed
Telasi’s and the Khrami Companies’ tariffs for the entire duration of those agreements.!8
According to them, as long as the 2011 Methodology applied, the tariff regimes contained in the
Khrami SPA and the 2013 (and 2011) Memorandum governed. The Respondents say that going
forward, the NERC would retain its discretion under Article 11(1) of the Law on Electricity as to
whether to take into account any further agreements concluded by the Government.'”? According
to the Respondents, Article 27 of the 2011 Methodology provided a transitional regime for that
Methodology only.'*° According to them, since the 2013 Memorandum did not pre-exist the 2011
Methodology, the Claimants could not have expected that the tariffs under the 2013 Memorandum
would remain exempted from any new tariff Methodology, which the NERC had announced it was

developing in late 2012.'*!

N. THE 2014 METHODOLOGY FOR SETTING ELECTRICITY TARIFFS

208. By 2012, Georgia’s electricity network had been substantially improved. In parallel with
the Parties’ negotiations concerning the 2013 Memorandum, the NERC commenced the process
of updating its tariff regime to bring it in line with the best practices of the EU, pursuant to funding
provided by the European Commission (“EC”) under the “Twinning Initiative” for inter-EU
knowledge sharing and administrative reform.”!> The tariff review process included consultations
between the NERC and electricity companies, including Telasi, and culminated in the adoption of
anew tariff setting methodology (the “2014 Methodology”) on 30 July 2014.?'° The steps leading
to the adoption of the 2014 Methodology included the following.

209. On 26 October 2012, it was publicly announced that the Government, the NERC, and
others would harmonize Georgia’s regulatory framework in line with EU energy legislation,
217

including a move to an incentive-based electricity tariff methodology.*'’ The Respondents

acknowledge that at this early stage of the process, the outcome of the project was not known, but

that “[t]he idea was to modernise the Georgian regime, and that’s what happened over time with

the adoption of the 2014 [M]ethodology.”?!®

210. It appears that there was some discussion of the Twinning Project and NERC’s plan to

revise its tariff setting methodology during the negotiations of the 2013 Memorandum.’!”

211. On 19 December 2013, the NERC hosted a discussion Re
I iss upcasing of

the existing tariff methodology and integrating quality supply practices from other energy

regulatory authorities.??°

212. On 17 February 2014, the EC reported on the NERC’s and the Twinning team’s plan to
issue a new methodology for the calculation of electricity tariffs to bring it in line with EU
legislation and to create a good climate investments it noted, noting that the calculation method
being proposed resulted from discussions of the December 2013 roundtable with Georgian market

players.7?!

213. By the end of March 2014, Inter RAO and Telasi received a Russian translation of a draft
of the 2014 Methodology.”

214. On 14 May 2014, at the Twinning Initiative’s final conference, the NERC
explained the new tariff methodology was a result of international and EU best practices and stated

that it remained open for public discussion with stakeholders.”

215. On15 July 2014, the NERC met with electricity companics, is
I 21 0c MIE) presented the genera

principles underpinning the 2014 Methodology.

216. Finally, on 30 July 2014, the NERC adopted the 2014 Methodology at a public session

atended by cletcity comes,

217. The 2014 Methodology provides for setting distribution and consumer tariffs yearly, based
on voltage levels, capital and operational expenses and the WAPT. It applies the “revenue cap”
method of regulation, in which the regulator calculates allowed revenues for a defined regulatory
period in order to allow distribution companies to cover reasonable costs associated with their
distribution activities and earn a reasonable return on their capital investment.?7°

218. The 2014 Methodology sets and adjusts the distribution tariff based on the justified
“reasonable and fair” distribution costs and then dividing them by the volume of distributed
electricity. The Distribution Tariff derives from dividing the allowed revenues for distribution
companies by their forecasted sales according to voltage levels over the required period.?”’ If the
volume increases, then the Distribution Tariff, and in turn the Consumer Tariff, will decrease; and

vice versa. It treats the cost of electricity as a pass-through cost recovered in full through the

Main Principles

1. This Methodology and the tariffs set on its bases

a. protect consumers from the monopolistic prices;

b. stimulate utility to increase its efficiency via optimization of its costs

with the requirement not to decrease quality of service standards and

technical conditions of the utility;

c. support the increase of the utility's’ returns by means of increased
operational and management efficiency;

d. support the stable and reliable functioning of the utility;

e. ensure that tariffs are transparent, stable and fair for the utility;

f reflect the state policy with regard to discount tariffs, provided that none
of the consumers categories shall receive a discount tariff subsidized by
licensee, importer, market operator or any other category;

g. reflect different costs between the different consumer categories;

h. cover costs of the utility with funds received from each consumer

category in proportion to costs incurred for servicing this consumer
category.

220. The 2014 Methodology distinguishes between controllable operational expenses

(“OPEX”) and non-controllable OPEX, and incorporates efficiency incentives for controllable

OPEX:?8

4. For calculation controllable operational costs “incentive regulation”
principle is used, which implies setting up incentives to optimize utility’s
costs. Controllable operational costs audit is carried out before regulatory
period and costs changes are made during tariff regulatory period
accordingly to this methodology.

Article 4

Tariff regulatory and tariff setting period

28 CL-0084, 2014 Methodology, Arts. 3(4), 4; Respondents’ Counter-Memorial, 4 176: The Respondents say this
OPEX distinction encouraged distribution companies to reduce their costs so as to increase their profits.

1. Based on this methodology tariff regulation period is determined
individually for specific utilities.

2. Commission sets tariff regulatory period for each year according to the
terms and conditions of this methodology.

3. The Commission sets for the whole tariff regulatory period the basic
components of the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) and fixed
rate for the efficiency factor (X-factor).

4. Tariffs are set annually by the Commission during tariff regulatory
period, and it is valid from I January to 31 December, except for the

circumstances set forth in Paragraph 4 of Article 23 of this Methodology.
221. Distribution companies’ permitted revenues are calculated as the sum of OPEX, capital
expenses (“CAPEX”), a normative allowance for electricity losses in the distribution network, and
a correction factor:?”?

CHAPTER II

CALCULATION OF THE REGULATORY COSTS

Article 5
Regulatory Cost Base for the Tariff Year

Regulatory Cost Base for the tariff year is calculated according to the
following formula:

where,

RCBery= CAPEX(+1) tCOPEX(r1)+ 2COPEX (11+ CNL +1)e CORR(+1)(1)
RCB(t+1)- Regulatory Cost Base for the tariff year (GEL);
CAPEX(t+1) - Capital Expenses for the tariff year (GEL);

cOPEX(t+1) - Controllable Operational Expenses for the tariff year
(GEL);

ncOPEX(t+1) - Non-controllable Operational Expenses for the tariff year
(GEL);

CNL(t+ 1) - Cost of Normative Losses in distribution networks for the
tariff year (GEL);

22° CL-0084, 2014 Methodology, Art. 5; see e.g., Moselle I, 4] 5.14.

CORR(t+1)- Cost correction factor, which provides the reflection of
the difference between factual and planned costs of Tariff Year in the
Regulatory Cost Base of the Tariff Year, and also received income from
non-operational activity envisaged in the subparagraph “e” of paragraph
1 of Article 19 of this Methodology, based on the principles defined in this
Methodology (GEL).

222. The NERC determines CAPEX as the sum of the annual depreciation on fixed assets and
a return on capital, which is calculated by multiplying the Regulated Asset Base (“RAB”) in GEL

by the rate of return on the RAB using the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (““WACC”)

method:?%°

Article 6
Capital Expenses

Capital Expenses for the Tariff Year are calculated according to the
following formula:

where,

CAPEXw1= RABwy* WACC + Dew

where,
CAPEX(t+1) - Capital Expenses for the tariff year (GEL);

RAB(t+1) - Regulated Assets Base for the tariff year (GEL);

WACC - Rate of return on the RAB for the tariff regulatory
period (%);

D(tt+1) - Annual depreciation for the tariff year (GEL).

Khrami Companies at a public hearing on 31 October 2017, in response in 2016:

The communication between the company and the Commission ended with
the commission giving additional time to present the additional documents
— the signatures are meant. The company missed the deadline and hence,
it is assumed that this one-year period [2016], for which the company is
asking the remuneration, this is the loss incurred due to their fault and
therefore, the Commission is entitled, rather, it is obliged not to consider
this loss. The loss amounts to GEL 14.4 million with respect to the USD

Ss. 2017/2018 CHANGES TO LAW ON ELECTRICITY

318. On 30 June 2017, Georgia amended the Law on Electricity applicable to the 35/110 kV
category to permit customers to purchase energy directly from ESCO/COPS, rather than from a
distributor, effective 1 May 2018.*° This decreased Telasi’s sales and allocation of energy.
However, after NERC incorporated the effect of the amended Law on Electricity into its annual
plan for 2018 and modified Telasi’s tariffs accordingly. On 4 May 2018, the changes were rolled
back by a subsequent amendment to the Law to require customers in the 35/110 kV category to

continue to purchase their energy from energy distributors.*””

U. Cost OF NEW CONNECTIONS ISSUE

321. The 2013 Memorandum does not mention the cost of new connections. The Claimants’
claim is that, separate from the 2013 Memorandum, the Government assured Inter RAO and Telasi
that they would fully recover Telasi’s costs of connecting new customers to the distribution
network*”*, They say this has not occurred despite the Respondents’ repeated promises. The
Claimants do not specify an amount of damages for the cost of new connections, but maintain in
their written submissions that they suffered “loss of several million GEL each year since at least

2013 ... and continues to do so.”375

322. The Claimants summarize the damages claimed in this and the ICSID arbitration as

 

follows:37°

“laimants have effectively abandoned their new connections claim (Respondents’ Rejoinder, § 203). The

323. The Claimants pursue their claim in the ICSID Arbitration on the basis that Georgia’s
treatment of the cost of new connections was erratic and inconsistent in breach of the duty of fair
and equitable treatment.*”” However, for the sake of completeness, the Parties’ arguments on this

claim are briefly summarized below.

324. Pursuant to several of the NERC’s Resolutions, since 2008 Telasi has been obliged to
connect new users to its network at its own expense, rather than users bearing the cost, as they did
previously.*”* Users pay a fixed amount set by NERC (which has not changed since 2011)
according to the applicable voltage class and capacity of the connection, and Telasi performs all
necessary connection works at its own expense. If Telasi does not comply with NERC’s connection
deadlines, it must pay a penalty. For each new connection, Telasi must obtain a construction permit
from the Tbilisi town council and approvals from ecological authorities and other city authorities.
The fast-track construction permit costs GEL 400, and Claimants say they often needed one in

order to meet Georgia’s connection deadlines.

Po The Parties’ discussions continued until 2016.

327. Commencing in 2015, the NERC took into account the difference between Telasi’s costs
and the connection fee paid by a new user as capital expenditures (“CAPEX”) recoverable through
Telasi’s Distribution Tariffs. However, the Claimants argue that the CAPEX mechanism only
partly mitigated Telasi’s losses, and that “the net present value of these payments over such a long
period of time [gradually over 25 years] is insufficient to cover Telasi’s losses.”*** It appears that

full

 

commencing in 2019 the NERC adjusted new connection fees to require payment of Telasi

costs of connection.

1) The Claimants’ Position

328. Claimants argue that the applicable rules and user fees have resulted in Telasi not being

fully compensated since 2013 for the additional cost of connecting new users. fF

addressed the new connection fee losses by treating any additional costs in excess of the fixed

connection fee as CAPEX recoverable through Telasi’s Distribution Tariff. FY

331. The Respondents say that the Claimants do not seek damages for the cost of new

connections, and have effectively abandoned their claim.**

Vv. TELASI’S PURCHASE PORTFOLIO VOLATILITY

|

333. Georgian electricity generation companies, Enguri and Vardnili, produce the cheapest
electricity in Georgia. Up until May 2017, Telasi received Enguri energy approximately in
proportion to Telasi’s share of the Georgian distribution market, pursuant to long-term supply
agreements.*°> However, on 25 May 2017, the MOE reduced Telasi’s usual allocation of Enguri
energy because of a purported imbalance between the costs and revenue of energy generation
companies in Georgia, which resulted in instability in the electricity system and distribution

companies having difficulty paying taxes.*°°

334. The Claimants claim that in the eight-month period between May-December 2017, the
allocation of energy purchases by Telasi from Enguri followed an ad hoc pattern that departed

from the planned amounts used to set Telasi’s WAPT. In each of May, June and July 2017, Telasi

32 CL-0084, 2014 Methodology, Art. 20.

395

Telasi has a 35% market share and Energo-Pro holds the remaining 65% (Energo-Pro purchased Kakheti in 2017).

Page 143
SCC Arbitration V2018/039; ICSID Case No. ADM/18/1

applied to the ESCO/COPS to approve the amount of Enguri energy forecasted in NERC’s Annual
Energy Plan, which ESCO/COPS declined, citing technical difficulties in transferring electricity
to Tbilisi.°°”

335. The Parties agree that the unavailability of Enguri energy caused an increase in the
purchase cost of electricity on the Georgian market. Telasi sought to cover the shortfall in cheap

Enguri energy with purchases from more expensive electricity sources.

336. On 25 August 2017, the MOE informed Telasi that additional volumes of Enguri and
Vardnili energy would go to Telasi to cover the shortage in May 2017, and that Energo-Pro and
Enguri’s energy for August 2017 would be used to ensure an additional 50 million kWh of supply

for Telasi.2°*

337. The Claimants pursue a claim in the ICSID arbitration arising from the volatility resulting

from what they say was an improper decision of the MOE.*”

Ww. DIVERSION OF THE KHRAMI COMPANIES’ ELECTRICITY AND SALES TO THIRD PARTIES

338. In October 2017, the NERC increased the Khrami Companies’ Generation Tariffs by
19%,4°°

339. In 2018, NERC diverted energy from the Khrami Companies away from Telasi through
Resolution No. 48, which directed that from May to August 2018 energy from the Khrami

Companies was to be replaced with Enguri energy.*°!

In interpreting the declaration of intent, the intention shall be ascertained
as a result of reasonable deliberation, and not only from the literal
meaning of its wording.

385. Article 338 provides as follows:

Article 338. Mutually Exclusive and Ambiguous Expressions in a Contract

In case of mutually exclusive and ambiguous expressions in a contract,
preference shall be given to the expression which most closely accords
with the overall content of the contract.

386. The Parties agree that the goal of contractual interpretation is to establish the parties’
common intention which can be determined from the context in which the agreement was
concluded, including with regard to the ordinary meaning of the words used in the relevant
contractual provision, the overall content and context of the contract and the reasonable meaning
of the Parties’ conduct or words before or after the contract was made. If the common intention of
the parties cannot be determined, then the meaning of the agreement should be construed by
ascertaining how the relevant contractual provisions would be understood by a reasonable person

in similar circumstances to the parties.

387. In either case, interpretation of the contract is a textual and contextual exercise which
involves various elements, including the ordinary meaning of the words in question; the overall
content of the contract; the aims enshrined in the contract’s other provisions; the facts and
circumstances in which the contract was made; the reasonable meaning of the parties’ conduct or
words either before or after entering into the contract; and other agreements the parties may have

concluded.**°

agreements pursuant to the General Administrative Code of Georgia (“GACG”), which states that
an administrative agreement is a civil law agreement concluded by an administrative body “for

3) The Tribunal’s Analysis

401. Pursuant to Article 52 of the GCC, the interpretation of a contract is to be performed by
way of reasonable deliberation, and not only from the literal meaning of the words used by the

Parties in their agreement. In this regard, the Georgian Supreme Court has held as follows:

Article 52 of GCC provides the rule for interpretation of the intent: “In interpreting the
declaration of intent, the intention shall be ascertained as a result of reasonable deliberation, and
not only from the literal meaning of its wording". The intent shall be interpreted based on the
legal-dogmatic methodology (i.e. principles of contractual interpretation). There are “subjective”
(based on intent) and “objective” (based on expression) theories of interpretation. When a
subjective approach is applied, the common intent shall be interpreted according to the analysis

  

 
    

163

Page 164
SCC Arbitration V2018/039; ICSID Case No. ADM/18/1
Partial Award 19 April 2021

of the provisions of the contract in each case. The aim is to determine what parties’ actual
intentions were at the moment in time when the contract was concluded and how to understand
them when the dispute arises. An objective theory focuses on expression of the will of a party,
explaining that this is crucial for legal certainty and stability in legal relationships. However, it
is complicated when parties have agreed on some terms but have attributed different meanings
to it, or one of them changes its mind later. In cases like this it is impossible to talk about
“common intent”. The vital criterion in such cases is the meaning that a reasonable person would
have attributed to the particular statement/expression taking into account the particular and
important circumstances of the case. The wording “reasonable deliberation” means establishing
the meaning of a disputed term by the reasonable person under the analogous circumstances.
The Chamber noted that pursuant to Article 338 of GCC, in case of mutually exclusive and
ambiguous expressions in a contract, preference shall be given to the expression that most closely
accords with the overall content of the contract. Therefore, when engaged in interpretation, the
Court shall give preference to expressions which correspond the most to the content of the
contract, the purposes enshrined in other provisions of the contract.**!

402. In the Tribunal’s view, this means determining the common intention of the Parties by way
of a textual and contextual exercise which involves consideration of the ordinary meaning of the
words used by the Parties as well as the content and purpose of the contract, the circumstances in
which the contract was made and the reasonable meaning of the Parties’ conduct or words either
before or after the conclusion of the contract.4? The Respondents agree with this articulation.
Therefore, the interpretive exercise does not stop with the words of the contract where the ordinary
meaning is clear, but in addition, includes consideration of the other relevant contextual elements.
That said, in the Tribunal’s view, the words used by parties to a contract, particularly where they

have negotiated those terms, is usually the best expression of the parties’ common intention.

403. Pursuant to Article 338 of the GCC, in the event of ambiguity arising from the language of
a provision or from inconsistent or contradictory provisions, preference should be given to the
interpretation that most closely accords with the overall content of the contract. In the event the
parties’ common intention cannot be determined using these principles, the meaning of the relevant
provisions should be determined on the basis of how a reasonable person in similar circumstances
to the parties would have understood them at the time of the contract. The Parties referred to this

as the reasonability or reasonableness test.

404. With respect to the application of the GACC, as the Parties accept, it does not contain

provisions on the interpretation of public law contracts. Accordingly, it does not directly govern

451 Supreme Court of Georgia Decision, Case No. AS-110-103-2015, CL-97.

164

Page 165
SCC Arbitration V2018/039; ICSID Case No. ADM/18/1

the interpretation of such contracts. Nevertheless, the GACC sets out a number of principles
governing the content and validity of public law contracts, including the need to balance the public
interest represented by the authority concluding the agreement with the interests of the private
party. In the Tribunal’s view, these principles form part of the nature and purpose of the contract
and thus form part of its textual and contextual interpretative exercise under the GCC.
Accordingly, the Tribunal takes into account the fact that the 2013 Memorandum and the Khrami
SPA are public contracts which are required to balance the public and private interests of the parties

to them in the interpretation of the disputed provisions of those agreements.

PARTIAL DISSENTING OPINION

Professor Zachary Douglas QC

INTRODUCTION

This case has generated a host of fiendishly complex issues of contractual interpretation. This
is due, in no small measure, to the unfortunate lack of clarity and precision that the parties
applied to the drafting of their contracts. Among the large number of issues that have been

decided in the Partial Award, there is happily only one that has divided the Tribunal, ||

The decision to commit to a dissenting opinion is rarely an easy one and it is made particularly
acute in this case by the very high esteem in which I hold my colleagues on the Tribunal. That
esteem has only been reinforced by the care and patience with which they have considered my

views on the issue that divides us throughout our long and intense deliberation process.

Despite addressing a single issue, this dissenting opinion is necessarily long because the key to
unlocking the meaning of the text iii the 2013 Memorandum is the context both
for that specific clause and the agreement as a whole. I have attempted to address this issue in

a systematic fashion and hence my opinion is structured to deal with the following points:
3.1. Applicable rules of interpretation under Georgian law;
3.2. Background to the 2011 Memorandum;

3.3. Interpretation of the 2013 Memorandum: (1) evidence of the parties’ intent during the
negotiations leading to the 2013 Memorandum; (2) evidence of the parties’ intent from a
comparison of the texts of the 2011 Memorandum and the 2013 Memorandum; (3) the
relevance fii” as evidence of the parties’ intent; (4) the balance of interests

under the 2013 Memorandum;

Io

3.4. The majority’s reasons for their interpretation the 2013 Memorandum;

=

3.6. Conclusion.

APPLICABLE RULES OF INTERPRETATION UNDER GEORGIAN LAW

The Claimants’ have cited the Georgian Supreme Court’s Decision in Case No AS-110-103-
2015 as the leading statement on the applicable principles of interpretation. In that case, the

Supreme Court endorsed the following passage from the Court of Appeal’s decision:

Article 52 of GCC provides the rule for interpretation of the intent: “In
interpreting the declaration of intent, the intention shall be ascertained as a
result of reasonable deliberation, and not only from the literal meaning of its
wording”. The intent shall be interpreted based on the legal-dogmatic
methodology (i.e. principles of contractual interpretation). There are
“subjective” (based on intent) and “objective” (based on expression) theories
of interpretation. When a subjective approach is applied, the common intent
shall be interpreted according to the analysis of the provisions of the contract
in each case. The aim is to determine what parties’ actual intentions were at
the moment in time when the contract was concluded and how to understand

 

them when the dispute arises. An objective theory focuses on expression of
the will of a party, explaining that this is crucial for legal certainty and stability

 

in legal relationships. However, it is complicated when parties have agreed on
some terms but have attributed different meanings to it, or one of them
changes its mind later. In cases like this it is impossible to talk about
“common intent”. The vital criterion in such cases is the meaning that a
reasonable person would have attributed to the _ particular
statement/expression taking into account the particular and important
circumstances of the case. The wording “reasonable deliberation” means
establishing the meaning of a disputed term by the reasonable person under
the analogous circumstances.

 

The Chamber noted that pursuant to Article 338 of GCC, in case of mutually
exclusive and ambiguous expressions in a contract, preference shall be given
to the expression that most closely accords with the overall content of the
contract. Therefore, when engaged in interpretation, the Court shall give
preference to expressions which correspond the most to the content of the
contract, the purposes enshrined in other provisions of the contract.’

CL-97.

la

In addition, it was common ground between the parties that the 2013 Memorandum is a public

 

 

law contract as defined by Article 2(1)(g) of the General Administrative Code of Georgia:* it
was concluded by a public entity (the Government of Georgia); its object is to fulfill a public
purpose (the determination of electricity tariffs for end consumers as well as for the Khrami

Companies and Telasi); and, it was approved by a Government Resolution.’

Although different views were expressed about the relevance of public law principles to the
interpretation of the 2013 Memorandum, the Tribunal has found that it is obliged to take into
account that it is a public law contract and thus needs to balance the public and private interests

of the parties.*

THE MAJORITY’S REASONS FOR THEIR INTERPRETATION 3
THE 2013 MEMORANDUM

g

108. The majority’s reasoning for upholding the Claimants’ interpretation is set out in paragraphs
503-515 and 526-534 of the Partial Award. With the greatest respect to my colleagues, it is not
possible to ascertain from a review of this reasoning how they have weighed the evidence that
I have set out above that is relevant to the interpretative exercise. It is accepted that this
evidence is relevant and indeed it is reproduced in great detail in the summaries of the patties’

positions in the Partial Award.

109. For instance, the majority’s reasoning begins with the following statement at paragraph 503:

not satisfied merely by demonstrating that the Respondent’s rival interpretation is not

and that burden is

 

completely watertight. It cannot be a matter of defaulting to the Claimants’ position in case of
doubt; there must be positive reasons to justify upholding that position. And yet there is no
contemporaneous evidence during the negotiation process supporting the Claimants’

interpretation but there are numerous elements from Inter RAO’s own documents that support

 

the Respondent’s position. An analysis of the difference in the wording between the 2011

Memorandum and the 2013 Memorandum

also supports the Respondent’s position, as does the existence of i

 

s evidence of the

 

parties’ intention. Finally, the Respondent’s position is more consistent with the idea of a fair

balance of the public and private interests under the 2013 Memorandum. There is nothing that

 

can be mobilized in favour of the Claimants’ interpretation that might serve to counteract the

weight that must be accorded to these various elements.
