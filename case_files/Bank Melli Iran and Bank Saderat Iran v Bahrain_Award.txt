Official Gazette of Iran No. 2206, Notice No. 2551, September 11, 1952 (C-2); Official Gazette of Iran
No. 5800, Notice No. 6/13573, January 13, 1965 (C-3).

11 of the Agreement on Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments between

the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Kingdom of Bahrain, dated

October 19, 2002 (the “BIT”) and Article 3 of the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations
Commission on International Trade Law, 1976 (the “UNCITRAL Rules”).

The dispute concerns the alleged breach by the Kingdom of Bahrain of its obligations
under the BIT arising out of the forced administration of Future Bank (“Future Bank”
or the “Bank”), a bank established by the Claimants together with Ahli United Bank
(“AUB”) in 2004 on the territory of Bahrain.*

According to the Claimants, “[t]he Kingdom of Bahrain expropriated Claimants’
investments without any justification or any form of due process or fairness, nor any
sense of proportionality, but rather abruptly and arbitrarily in violation of all procedural
and substantive protections under the BIT.”* According to the Claimants, the

expropriation was not accompanied by compensation.

The Respondent denies the claims in their entirety and submits that the claim is

inadmissible because of the Claimants’ illegal activities.>

Cc. THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT

Article 11 of the BIT contains the arbitration agreement and provides:

ARTICLE 11

SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES BETWEEN A CONTRACTING PARTY
AND INVESTOR(S) OF THE OTHER CONTRACTING PARTY

1. If any dispute arises between the host Contracting Party and investor(s)
of the other Contracting Party with respect to an investment, the host
Contracting Party and the investor(s) shall primarily endeavour to settle
the dispute in an amicable manner through negotiation and
consultation.

2. In the event that the host Contracting Party and the investor(s) can not
agree within 4 months from the date of notification of the claim by one
party to the other, either of them may refer the dispute to:

(a) _ the competent courts of the Contracting Party in the territory of
which the investment has been made; or

Shareholders Agreement, March 3, 2004 (hereinafter “Shareholders Agreement”) (C-97).

Statement of Claim, October 16, 2017 (hereinafter “SoC”), 1 3.
Statement of Defense, February 16, 2018 (hereinafter “SoD”), 1.

PCA Case No. 2017-25
Award
Page 3 of 235

(b) the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes
(ICSID) provided for by the Convention on the Settlement of
Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other
States, done at Washington, on March 18, 1965; as soon as both
Contracting Parties become members to that convention.

(c) an ad-hoc arbitral tribunal which, unless otherwise agreed upon
by the parties to the dispute, shall be established under the
arbitration rules of the United Nations Commission on
international Trade Law (UNCITRAL).

3. A dispute primarily referred to the competent courts of the host
Contracting Party, as long as it is pending, cannot be referred to
arbitration save with the parties agreement; and in the event that a final
judgment is rendered, it cannot be referred to arbitration.

4, National courts shall not have jurisdiction over any dispute referred to
arbitration. However, the provisions of this paragraph do not bar the
winning party to seek for the enforcement of the arbitral award before
national courts.®

D. THE APPLICABLE LAW

The Netherlands arbitration law, which applies to these proceedings as lex arbitri,
contains the following provision concerning the law applicable to the substance of the
dispute:

If a choice of law is made by the parties, the arbitral tribunal shall make its

award in accordance with the rules of law chosen by the parties. Failing such

choice of law, the arbitral tribunal shall make its award in accordance with
the rules of law which it considers appropriate.’

Article 33 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules contains essentially the same choice of
law rules, except that in the absence of a choice of law by the parties, it points to the
application of the “law determined by the conflict of law rules which [the tribunal]
considers applicable”. In the present context of an investment treaty dispute, this

difference is without effect on the law that this Tribunal will apply.

The BIT contains no choice-of-law clause, nor have the Parties otherwise made such a
choice. Therefore, the Tribunal must decide the issues in dispute pursuant to the law
which it considers appropriate. Since it is seised of this dispute on the basis of the BIT,

the Tribunal will first and foremost apply the provisions of the BIT. For the interpretation

 

on Reci | Promotion and Protection of between the G of the Islamic
Republic of Iran and the Government of the Kingdom of Bahrain, October 19, 2002 (hereinafter “BIT”)
(CL-1), Article 6.

Code of Civil Procedure (Book 4: Arbitration) of the Netherlands, Article 1054(2).

IL.

PCA Case No. 2017-25

Page 4 of 235

of the BIT, it will resort to the rules of customary international law contained in the
Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the “WCLT”). If the BIT is silent on an issue
or if it uses notions pertaining to other sets of rules, the Tribunal will determine in each
case whether a given issue is subject to rules of international law (other than the BIT) or

to municipal law.
PROCEDURAL HISTORY

A. COMMENCEMENT OF THE ARBITRATION AND CONSTITUTION OF THE TRIBUNAL

The Claimants served their Notice of Arbitration on February 8, 2017, together with
factual exhibits CE-1 to CE-68 and legal authorities CLA-1 to CLA-29. In their Notice
of Arbitration, the Claimants proposed that the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules of 2010,
as revised in 2013, or, alternatively, the UNCITRAL Rules of 2010, or of 1976, apply to
the dispute. They also proposed that the proceedings be administered by the Permanent
Court of Arbitration in The Hague (the “PCA”), that the PCA act as “appointing
authority” in accordance with the UNCITRAL Rules, that the place of arbitration be

Paris, France, and that the language of arbitration be English.

Additionally, in their Notice of Arbitration, the Claimants appointed Professor
Emmanuel Gaillard, a French national as arbitrator. Professor Gaillard’s contact details

where then as follows:

Professor Emmanuel Gaillard

Shearman & Sterling LLP

France

Tel.: +33 (0)1 53 89 70 00

Fax.: +33 (0)1 53 89 70 70

E-mail: egaillard@shearman.com
By letter dated March 13, 2017, the Respondent raised certain questions pertaining to the
status of the Claimants as Specially Designated Nationals (“SDN”) under U.S. Iranian
Financial Sanctions Regulations (“IFSR”) and the need for an arbitrator in a case
involving SDNs to obtain prior clearance from the U.S. Department of Treasury Office
of Foreign Assets Control (the “OFAC”) with respect to funds emanating from such
entities. In particular, the Respondent asked the PCA to “inquire whether Shearman &

Sterling (or Professor Gaillard, or anyone else) has obtained OFAC clearance that would

cover receipt of remittances originating from both of the Claimants with respect to fees

earned in this case”.

By letter dated March 15, 2017, the Claimants stated, inter alia, that the Respondent
“cannot rely on [the OFAC license] issue to delay its appointment of an arbitrator” and
that it had “failed to nominate an arbitrator within the 30-day deadline under Article 7 of
the 1976 [UNCITRAL Rules]’. The Claimant thus informed the PCA and the

appointing authority.

Secretary-General designate an appointing authority.

Following further correspondence between the Parties and the PCA, by e-mail dated May
8, 2017, the Respondent notified the Claimants and the PCA of its nomination as

arbitrator of The Rt. Hon. Lord (Lawrence) Collins of Mapesbury, a U.K. national.

Collins’ nomination as arbitrator.

By letter dated May 15, 2017, the Claimants objected to the “purported nomination” of
Lord Collins.

H. Post-HEARING PROCEEDINGS AND COSTS SUBMISSIONS

On May 13, 2019, the Tribunal invited the Parties to make simultaneous costs
submissions by no later than July 10, 2019. By the same letter, the Tribunal invited the

Parties to file reply comments on the other side’s costs submissions by July 24, 2019.

On July 10, 2019, the Respondent submitted its letter to the Tribunal regarding costs (the
“Respondent’s Submission on Costs”) and a declaration of costs in an Annex. On the
same date, the Claimants filed their submission on costs (the “Claimants’ Submission

on Costs”).

On July 24, 2019, the Respondent replied to the Claimants’ Submission on Costs (the
“Claimants’ Reply Comments on Submission on Costs”), and submitted a declaration
of amended costs in an Annex. On the same date, the Claimants replied to the
Respondent’s Submission on Costs (the “Respondent’s Reply Comments on

Submission on Costs”).

On September 21, 2019, the Claimants sought confirmation that no further submissions
were required from the Claimants with respect to their amended request for relief, which

the Tribunal confirmed on September 26, 2019.

On February 13, 2020, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal to “update the Tribunal in
relation to the criminal investigations in Bahrain” in respect of Future Bank “in the
interest of transparency”, enclosing a press release from the Office of the Public

Prosecutor in Bahrain.

By e-mail of February 27, 2020, the Claimants commented on such letter regarding the
criminal proceedings initiated in Bahrain against Future Bank, the Claimants, and Future
Bank executives. In this communication, the Claimants referred to the Respondent’s
letter and the underlying criminal proceedings as aggravating the dispute and the
reputational damage inflicted on them. They also reserved their rights and requested an

indication on the date of issue of the Award.

I. REPLACEMENT OF THE PRESIDING ARBITRATOR, RE-HEARING, AND
SUPPLEMENTAL COSTS SUBMISSIONS
On April 6, 2020, the PCA informed the Parties of the recent passing of Professor Rudolf

Dolzer.

On April 30, 2020, the co-arbitrators appointed Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler as
presiding arbitrator pursuant to Articles 13(1) and 7(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules.
Professor Kaufmann-Kohler’s contact details are as follows:

On May 11, 2020, with reference to Article 14(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal
invited the Parties to provide their views on the appropriate next procedural steps,
informing the Parties that the Tribunal would be inclined to hold a hearing at which
counsel would be afforded an opportunity to present oral arguments and address any

questions from the Tribunal.
By letters dated May 18, 2020, each side confirmed its availability for a hearing.

On May 25, 2020, the Tribunal proposed dates for a hearing by videoconference to the

Parties, who confirmed their availability on May 25 and June 6, 2020 respectively.

On June 15, 2020, the Tribunal confirmed that the hearing would take place on August
10 and 11, 2020, proposed to conduct the hearing via the Zoom platform, and invited the
Parties’ comments on draft Procedural Order No. 8 in respect of arrangements for a

videoconference hearing.

On July 1, 2020, having considered the Parties’ comments, the Tribunal issued
Procedural Order No. 8, inter alia setting out the hearing schedule and the

videoconference etiquette.

On July 28, 2020, the Tribunal informed the Parties of areas of particular interest and

invited them to address these in their oral arguments at the forthcoming hearing.

By letter of the same date, the Claimants updated the Tribunal on recent development in
the criminal proceedings in Bahrain and requested that “any monetary relief awarded by
the Tribunal be accompanied by language expressly setting out that such monetary relief
shall not be capable of set off against any other amounts allegedly owed by Future Bank,
Claimants, or their respective representatives, in the context of other actions initiated by
Bahrain”, citing Togo Electricité and GDF-Suez Energie Services v. Republic of Togo in

support.

On July 29, 2020, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment on the Claimants’
correspondence of July 28, 2020, noting that the Parties may further address the issues
raised in the Claimants’ correspondence in their oral arguments at the hearing if they

deemed it appropriate.

On July 30, 2020, the Claimants requested certain changes to the hearing schedule.

On the same date, the Tribunal invited the Respondent’s views on such changes, to which

the Respondent objected on July 30, 2020.

On July 31, 2020, having considered the Parties’ positions and taking into account that
what was expected was as summary of elements already in the record, the Tribunal

decided to keep the original schedule fixed in Procedural Order No. 8.

On August 4, 2020, the Respondent commented on the Claimants’ letter of July 28, 2020,

arguing inter alia that the Claimants’ new request for relief was inadmissible.

Also on August 4, 2020, the Respondent sought leave to file two updated exhibits and

two legal authorities into the record for purposes of the upcoming hearing.

On August 5, 2020, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it was inclined to admit the

documents for which the Respondent sought leave, subject to any compelling reason to

136.

the contrary raised by the Claimants, in which case the Tribunal would reconsider its

position.

On August 5, 2020, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that they did not object to the
introduction of the documents “without prejudice to the relevance and materiality of the
same”. By the same letter, the Claimants introduced legal authorities CLA-175 to CLA-
179.

Also on August 5, 2020, a pre-hearing conference took place via the Zoom platform in
which counsel and representatives for the Parties, the members of the Tribunal, and the

PCA participated and tested the features of the videoconference platform.

By letter dated August 6, 2020, the Tribunal admitted the exhibits and legal authorities
that the Respondent sought to introduce on August 4, 2020, and the Claimants’ legal
authorities CLA-175 to CLA-179 into the record. By the same letter, the Tribunal noted
the Respondent’s letter of August 4, 2020, addressing the criminal proceedings in

Bahrain.

The Re-Hearing took place on August 10 and 11, 2020 by videoconference. The

the criminal proceedings in Bahrain and claimed that the Respondent was “continuing to
use each day that elapses to aggravate the dispute” through these proceedings. They
further repeated their request that “any monetary relief awarded by the Tribunal be
accompanied by language expressly setting out that such monetary relief shall not be
capable of set off against any other amounts allegedly owed by Future Bank, Claimants,
or their respective individual representatives, in the context of other actions initiated by

Bahrain”.

On January 4, 2021, the Tribunal gave the Respondent the opportunity to submit

comments on the Claimants’ letter of December 30, 2020, by January 8, 2021.

to issue the Award by the end of March, as previously anticipated, and proposed to give

notice three days in advance of its issue.

By e-mail dated March 4, 2021, the Claimants urged for the Award “to be issued
promptly” and “within the first half of April”.

On March 18, 2021, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it would be continuing its

deliberation process and would provide a status update in two months.

By e-mail dated March 19, 2021, the Claimants repeated calls for the prompt issue of the

Award, reiterating concerns regarding the ongoing criminal proceedings in Bahrain.

J. APPOINTMENT OF A SUBSTITUTE ARBITRATOR

On April 6, 2021, the PCA informed the Parties of the passing of Professor Emmanuel
Gaillard and invited the Claimants to appoint a substitute arbitrator by May 3, 2021,
pursuant to Article 13(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules.

By letter dated April 12, 2021, the Claimants notified the Tribunal of their appointment
of Professor Hanotiau as substitute arbitrator. Professor Hanotiau’s contact details are as

follows:

Professor Bernard Hanotiau

On September 9, 2021, the Claimants requested an update as to the date of issue of the

award.

On September 10, 2021, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it had made substantial
progress and expected to be in a position to issue the award in late October or early

November 2021.

On October 21, 2021, the Respondent informed the Tribunal of “the internationally-
broadcast news of the ten year jail sentence for corruption that an Iranian court has
pronounced against the former Governor of the Central Bank of Iran, Dr. Valiollah Seif.”
On the same day, the Claimants notified the Tribunal that they did not intend to respond
to the Respondent’s communication, “other than to say that the issue bears no relevance

to the specific points in dispute.”
FACTUAL BACKGROUND

This section restates the main facts of this dispute. Where a fact or its significance is
disputed, reference is made to the Parties and, where appropriate, the Parties’ respective
positions on such facts. In particular, it addresses the establishment of Future Bank in
Bahrain, the various compliance reports issued by the Central Bank of Bahrain (the
“CBB”) and Future Bank’s responses thereto, the circumstances and events surrounding
the CBB’s decision to place Future Bank under administration and, subsequently,
liquidation. In the analysis set out in Chapters V to VIII the Tribunal will refer to

additional facts where this appears necessary.
A. THE LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK
Before setting out the chronology of the main facts, the Tribunal briefly summarizes the
relevant Bahraini legal framework.

1. Central Bank of Bahrain and Financial Institutions Law
Article 136 of the Central Bank of Bahrain and Financial Institutions Law (Decree No.
64 of 2006) (the “CBB Law’) sets out the grounds upon which the Central Bank may
place a bank holding a licence under administration as follows:

(a) The Central Bank may, pursuant to a justified resolution, assume the
administration of a Licensee or may appoint another person (the

167.

168.

PCA Case No. 2017-25
Award
Page 27 of 235

“External Administrator”) to conduct the administration of a Licensee
on behalf of the Central Bank under any of the following circumstance:

1) If the Licensee becomes insolvent or appears most likely to
be insolvent.

2) _ If the license is amended or cancelled pursuant to the provisions
of items (1) and (3) of paragraph (c) of Article (48) of this law.

3) If the Licensee continued to provide regulated services which
resulted in inflicting damages to financial services industry in
the Kingdom.

(b) In this part the term administrator denotes the Central Bank if it
assumes the administration of the Licensee or any external
administrator to be appointed for this purpose.*

Pursuant to Article 138(a), the Administrator “shall, promptly after assuming the
administration of a Licensee, publish a notice to this effect in the Official Gazette and in
one Arabic and one English language newspaper published in the Kingdom, and to show
such notice in every place of business of the Licensee in the Kingdom all through the
period in which he assumes the administration.”® Article 138(b) adds that “the
appointment of the Administrator shall only have effect on the day following the

publication of such notice [...]”!°

The CBB Law further provides in Article 139(a), that a financial institution placed under
administration may file an appeal before the CBB within ten days following the
publication of the administration. Article 139(b) then stipulates that the decision on the
appeal must be notified to the appellant within 15 days and that reasons must be given in
the event that the appeal is dismissed. Under Article 139(c), the financial institution may
then challenge the decision of administration or the dismissal of the appeal before the

competent court within 30 days.!!

Within a period of two years from the commencement of the administration, a petition
for the compulsory liquidation of the bank under administration or to terminate the

administration and reinstate the bank’s management shall be made (Art. 143).'?

Article 145 specifies that compulsory liquidation will ensue in case of insolvency and

where it is shown to be just and equitable. '°

2. The CBB Rulebook

In the exercise of its powers as the regulator of all financial institutions in Bahrain, the
CBB has issued a Rulebook (the “CBB Rulebook”), which contains regulations

governing the banking sector. '#

In an introductory statement, the CBB explains that the Rulebook contains “regulatory
and supervisory authority for all financial institutions in Bahrain, issues regulatory
instruments that licensees and other specified persons are legally obliged to comply

with.” 15
The Rulebook contains the following provisions on administration:

EN 8.1.1

Article 136 of the CBB Law empowers (but does not oblige) the CBB to
assume the administration of a licensee in certain circumstances.
These circumstances are outlined in the above Article and may include
the following:

(a) The licensee has become insolvent;

(b) Its solvency is in jeopardy;

(c) Its continued activity is detrimental to the financial services
industry in the Kingdom; or
(d) Its license has been cancelled.
EN 8.2.1

The CBB views the administration of a licensee as a very powerful sanction,
and will generally only pursue this option if less severe measures are unlikely
to achieve its supervisory objectives.

Rulebook”) (PS-30).

PCA Case No. 2017-25

Award

Page 29 of 235

EN 8.2.2

Although Article 136 of the CBB Law specifies the circumstances in which
the CBB may pursue an administration, it does not oblige the CBB to
administer a licensee. The CBB may pursue other courses of action such as
suspension of a license (under Article 131 of the CBB Law), if it considers
that these are more likely to achieve the supervisory outcomes sought.
Because an administration is likely to send a negative signal to the markets
about the status of a licensee, other supervisory actions may in fact be
preferable in terms of protecting the interests of those with a claim on the
licensee.

EN 8.2.3

The criteria used by the CBB in deciding whether to seek an administration
of a licensee include the following:

(a) the extent to which the interests of the market, its users and those
who have a claim on the licensee would be best served by the
administration of the license, for instance because of the potential
impact on asset values arising from an administration;

(b) the extent to which other regulatory actions could reasonably be
expected to achieve the CBB's desired supervisory objectives
(such as restrictions on the licensee's operations, including
limitations on new business and asset disposals);

(c) the extent to which the liquidity or solvency of the licensee is in
jeopardy; and

(d) the extent to which the licensee has contravened the conditions of
the CBB Law, including the extent to which the contraventions
reflect more widespread or systemic weaknesses in controls
and/or management.

EN 8.3 Procedure for Implementing an Administration
EN 8.3.1

All proposals for assuming the administration of a licensee are subject to a
thorough review by the CBB of all relevant facts, assessed against the criteria
outlined in Section EN 8.1.

EN 8.3.2

A formal notice of administration is issued to the licensee concerned and
copies posted in every place of business of the licensee. As soon as practicable
thereafter, the notice is also published in the Official Gazette and in one
Arabic and one English newspapers in the Kingdom. The term “in
administration” should be clearly marked in all Future Bank’s
correspondence and on its website, next to Future Bank’s name.

EN 8.3.3

Article 136 of the CBB Law allows a licensee 10 days following the
administration taking effect in which to appeal to the CBB. If the CBB refuses
the appeal, the licensee has a further 30 calendar days from the date of the
refusal in which to lodge an appeal at the courts. So as to reduce the potential
damage of an administration order being applied and then withdrawn on
appeal, where feasible the CBB will give advance notice to a licensee's Board

of its intention to seek an administration, and allow the Board the right of
appeal prior to an administration notice being formally served.'°

Volume 1 of the CBB Rulebook, which applies to all licensed conventional banks,
provides a “comprehensive framework of Rules and Guidance aimed at combating
money laundering and terrorist financing”. Within Volume 1, the so-called Financial
Crime Module (the “FC Module”) places certain obligations on conventional banks

which are summarized as follows:

The Module requires conventional bank licensees to have effective anti-
money laundering (‘AML’) policies and procedures, in addition to measures
for combating the financing of terrorism (‘CFT’). The Module contains
detailed requirements relating to customer due diligence, reporting and the
role and duties of the Money Laundering Reporting Officer (MLRO).'”

The CBB Rulebook is amended from time to time.

B. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF FUTURE BANK (2004)

BMI and BSI had been operating in Bahrain since 1971.'* According to the Claimants,
Future Bank was established on the active encouragement of Bahrain'? following the
conclusion in 2002 of the Memorandum of Understanding between the Central Bank of
Iran and its Bahraini counterpart, the Bahrain Monetary Agency (the “BMA”), which
was the predecessor of the CBB. In that Memorandum, the two signatories expressed
their willingness to “allow the establishment of banks and financial institutions” in their

respective jurisdictions.”°

For the Respondent, that Memorandum “was a far cry from inducement of the Claimants’
specific investment in Future Bank”.*! The Respondent avers that the Claimants

established Future Bank as “it was in their commercial and strategic interests”.””

Officials of the BMA met with the general managers of the Bahrain branches of BMI and
BSI to discuss a possible joint venture with a local bank for the mutual benefit of Iran

and Bahrain.*

On March 3, 2004, BMI, BSI, and a bank incorporated in Bahrain, AUB, signed a
Shareholders’ Agreement forming Future Bank, a commercial bank to be incorporated in
Bahrain.” The three banks hold an equal interest in Future Bank and the Shareholders’
Agreement provides that each shareholder will nominate three members to the nine-
member Board of Directors of Future Bank. It also addresses Future Bank’s plan to
establish a branch in the Kish Free Zone in Iran.?°

On June 23, 2004, the CBB issued a licence to Future Bank for the provision of regulated
retail banking pursuant to Decree No. 64 of 2006,7° and on July 7, 2004 BMI, BSI, and

AUB signed a Memorandum of Association to incorporate Future Bank.?”

According to the Respondent, a licensed “retail” bank may provide financial services
“generally” to individuals or small institutions, by contrast to a licensed ‘wholesale’
bank, which provides financial services primarily to foreign banks, multinationals, and

pension funds.?8

C. FUTURE BANK OPERATIONS (2005-2009)
1. Future Bank’s Operations and Strategy 2005-2009

According to the Claimants, Future Bank operated as a largely successful bank from its
inception. Between 2004 and 2006, it had significantly increased its assets and saw an
almost three-fold increase in net profits.” The Claimants attribute this growth to the co-

operation between Bahraini and Iranian authorities.*”

By contrast, for the Respondent, Future Bank’s growth was largely due to its dealings
with Iran. The Respondent points to Future Bank’s refinancing agreement of October 2,
2006 with the Central Bank of Iran, as an indication of Future Bank’s dependence on
Tranian business. Under this agreement, Future Bank was to “make available a facility
for an amount of USD 400 million for refinancing [letters of credit] opened by [the
Central Bank of Iran and other Iranian banks]”.*! The Respondent alleges that, on the
basis of this agreement, the Central Bank of Iran and other Iranian banks “would open
letters of credit for buyers of goods or services in Iran and instruct Future Bank to pay
beneficiaries of the letter of credit in Bahrain”. The Respondent claims this was the

reason Future Bank was able to grow and perform as well as it did by 2006.*7

The Claimants stress that Future Bank obtained the CBB’s approval for the refinancing
agreement with the Central Bank of Iran for this opening of a branch in the Kish Island
Free Zone in Iran as contemplated in the Shareholders’ Agreement among BMI, BSI, and
AUB.*? In the following year, on August 6, 2007, the CBB informed Future Bank that it
was in the process of reviewing Future Bank’s proposal regarding the Kish Free Zone

branch, and instructed it not to start activities until further notice.**

The Claimants allege that the CBB demanded in 2007 that Future Bank submit to
increased supervision and enhanced inspections, which the latter accepted.** In spite of

this “encumbering — scrutiny’ the Claimants argue, Future Bank maintained

profitability, increasing net profits to USD 23.5 million by the end of 2007.*7

2. Future Bank’s Board of Directors

In November 2007, the members of the Board of Directors that had been appointed by
the AUB, Mr. Hamad Al Marzougq and Mr. Adel A. El-Labban, resigned and requested
that the Board authorize the transfer of AUB’s shareholding in Future Bank to a trust, in

order to shield the AUB from “the very serious contagion effects of Iranian sanctions”.*®

In their stead, Mr. A. Aziz Ahmed A. Malek and Mr. Abel Al Mannai were appointed by
the entity which had taken over Dana Trust participation.*? The former was also
appointed to the Board Audit Committee, with responsibilities including Future Bank’s
accounting policy, internal controls, compliance procedures, risk management function,

and relations with external auditors and regulators.

The Claimants allege that these two individuals were in fact appointed by the CBB in
order to gain access to Future Bank’s internal operations.*° The Respondent denies that

these “independent board members [...] somehow acted as the CBB ‘pawns””.*!

3. Sanctions Regime against Iran (2005-2008)

On July 31, 2006, the United Nations Security Council (“UNSC”) issued Resolution
1969, which noted the concern in respect of Iran’s nuclear programme and called upon
“all States, in accordance with their national legal authorities and legislation and

consistent with international law, to exercise vigilance and prevent the transfer of any

On December 23, 2006, the UNSC issued Resolution 1737, also regarding Iran’s nuclear
program, deciding that all States shall “freeze the funds, other financial assets and
economic resources which are on their territories at the date of adoption of the resolution
or at any time thereafter, that are owned or controlled by the persons or entities designated
in the Annex, as well as those additional persons or entities designated by the Security
Council [...] and decides further that all States shall ensure that any funds, financial
assets or economic resources are prevented from being made available by their nationals
or by any person or entities within their territories, to or for the benefit of these

[designated] persons and entities”.**

Following the adoption of the UNSC Resolution 1737, on February 27, 2007, the Council
of the European Union (the “EU”) issued a common position on the enactment of
sanctions on listed persons, which included freezing “all funds and economic resources
which belong to, are owned, held or controlled, directly or indirectly” to persons and

entities designated in the annex to UNSC Resolution 1737.

On October 25, 2007, OFAC designated Bank Saderat under Executive Order 13224 and

On March 3, 2008, the UNSC issued Resolution 1803 calling on all States to “exercise
vigilance” over “the activities of financial institutions in their territories with all banks
domiciled in Iran, in particular with Bank Melli and Bank Saderat, and their branches

and subsidiaries abroad”.?

Consequently, on March 12, 2008, the CBB issued a directive with respect to UN

Resolutions 1737 and 1803 requiring in relevant part that:

licensees [...] exercise vigilance and enhanced due diligence over the
following:

. When entering into new commitments for public provided financial
support for trade with Iran, including the granting of export credits,
guarantees or insurance, to their nationals or entities involved in such
trade.

° Over activities with all bank domiciled in Iran, in particular with Bank

The Claimant alleges that, between 2007 and 2008, the U.S. exerted pressure on Bahrain

(a) The BMA 2006 Compliance Report

On August 6, 2006, the BMA communicated to Future Bank a copy of the anti-money

laundering report (the “2006 Compliance Report”),*°

of the same date relating to an
examination carried out between May 29 and June 4, 2006. The 2006 Compliance Report

contained the following findings and conclusions:

a. certain procedures needed to be put in place, including with
respect to enhanced due diligence (“EDD”) with regard to
charities, clubs and other societies, as well as persons identified
as politically exposed persons (“PEPs”) at the time of opening

an account;

b. weaknesses in customer due diligence (“CDD”) were found in
the identification documentation and background information on
clients referring to the nature of the account and the anticipated
activity. In particular, some documentation in CDD reports had

been outdated as they must have been updated every three years;

c. the bank’s money laundering reporting officer (the “MLRO”)
had failed to report unusual transactions, acknowledging that the
anti-money laundering (“AML”)/ (“CET”) procedures had been
implemented in April 2006, with the result that their

effectiveness could not yet be assessed; and

d. additional training of employees was required for purposes of

suspicious transaction reporting (“STR”).*°

The 2006 Compliance Report also noted that examiners had reviewed a random sampling
of inward wire transfers and found that there were cases where originator information

was missing,”’ a failure related to the wire stripping issue that would resurface later.**

Future Bank reacted on September 4, 2006, conveying the management’s responses to
the issues raised by the BM. The response acknowledged a number of shortcomings
identified in the 2006 Compliance Report and set out the measures that Future Bank took
or contemplated taking in order to address such shortcomings. In particular, the bank
represented that the trade finance department would ensure that all inward transfers
would include originator information and that it was in the process of updating all
customer account profiles in order to address the issue of incomplete customer

identification documentation.

(b) The 2006 CBB Inspection Report

During the month of August 2006, the Inspection Directorate of the CBB performed an
examination of Future Bank and issued a report dated March 5, 2007 (the “2006 CBB

Inspection Report”).*’

To embrace best practice corporate governance the Board is required to
implement control framework which is robust focused towards risk and is
sufficiently documented to provide direction to staff in the execution of
their duties.

The Board is alerted to the significant number of non-compliance issues
raised in this report. Immediate Board attention is warranted to ensure there
is proper and effective compliance environment within Future Bank. The
Board must therefore submit to the CBB by the end of April 2007 an action
plan on establishing both compliance culture and compliance function.

Moreover all outstanding issues in the external auditors Management Letter
and Internal Audit reports need to be resolved within the first half of 2007 to
enhance Future Banks’ internal control environment.

Management is required to improve the credit culture of Future Bank by
ensuring that measures such as credit assessment and review are undertaken
to facilitate effective credit portfolio management.

Serious misrepresentations made by previous Management regarding the
provision of consumer finance were uncovered during the examination and
the Board is required to submit immediate proposals to the CBB detailing the
actions they propose to take in respect of such finance.

Management is also required to establish connection with the Credit
Reference Bureau regarding the existing consumer loans.

Future Bank responded on March 29, 2007, with a detailed action plan, indicating that
more than half of the points had been addressed and that the remaining issues would be

addressed by September 2007.°!

(c) Political Tensions and August 2007 Meeting

As sanctions against Iran gradually gained ground, Bahrain came under increased
pressure due to its political and economic ties with Iran. This created an internal political
tension in Bahrain. The Respondent also stresses that the Financial Action Task Force
(the “FATF’”), an intergovernmental organization founded to develop policies to combat
money laundering, declared in 2007 that it was “concerned that the Islamic Republic of
Tran’s lack of a comprehensive [AML/CFT] regime represents a significant vulnerability

within the international financial system”.

In this context, on August 9, 2007 Dr. Seif, the CEO and Managing Director of Future
Bank, met with Mr. Hamad, the Executive Director of Banking Supervision at the CBB,

to discuss the adverse effects of these developments on Future Bank’s business.

After that meeting, Dr. Seif wrote to record the CBB’s recommendations that Future
Bank maintain sufficient liquidity to respond to mass withdrawal of deposits and not to
assume new risks on Iran. He also stated the bank reduce its share of business involving
Tranian trade, and shift to Bahrain based activities. He in particular concluded that trade
related activities would be under enhanced supervision and control.® The CBB also
required Future Bank to submit weekly audits by independent auditors, together with

usual compliance and risk reports, and regular updates on its Iran exposure.

(d) The 2008 CBB Report

The CBB’s Inspection Directorate conducted an on-site examination of Future Bank
between November 9, 2008 and December 14, 2008, producing a report (the “2008 CBB
Report”)™ in which it found that Future Bank had “failed to implement substantial
improvements in the control environment since the previous examination in 2006”,
especially in connection with credit controls. Among other matters, the report noted, that
the CBB has “temporarily allowed” Future Bank’s exposure to BMI and BSI, provided
that it would not exceed 60% of the bank’s capital base. At that time, the direct exposure
to BMI and BSI reportedly amounted to 58.8%.® Through credit facilities extended to
BMIIC International General Trading and Ghadir Investment Company, that percentage
increased to 83.06%.°’ The 2008 CBB Report also noted that Future Bank’s “Core

Banking System did not have the capability to automatically generate timely and tailor-

made [Management Information System] reports”, which meant that “reports were not

207. The executive summary of the Report highlighted these matters in the following terms:

It was evident that the Bank failed to implement substantial improvements in
the control environment since the previous examination in 2006. One of the
implications of this failure is that the Bank’s credit culture remains unsound.
The Bank was heavily reliant on collateral when granting credit. This control
weakness was exacerbated where the financial health of the borrower was in
question.

The Bank also lacked effective monitoring over shares and properties used to
secure the credit facilities. Moreover, compliance with consumer finance
regulations was not demonstrated in a number of instances. Such practices
violate the rules and the guidelines outlined in “Credit Risk Management”
Module of the CBB Rulebook.

In addition, the credit rating system was not consistently applied across
facilities, and there was a lack of periodical credit reviews for a number of
facilities despite this being recommended by the CBB in the last examination
report. The credit files did not include important documents such as those
related to the borrower’s financial conditions; know your customer
regulation, and property valuations.

The Board must immediately adopt corrective measures to address the
unsound credit culture of the Bank, comply with the requirements of the CBB
Rulebook,

including a plan for enhancing compliance, and advise the CBB of the action
taken accordingly.

The Bank lacked a corporate strategy and a detailed business plan. This does
not demonstrate good business practice, and it also constitutes a violation to
the “High Level Controls” Module of the CBB Rulebook.

In respect of liabilities, the Bank did not have a diversified base of depositors.
The top ten non-bank depositors constituted approximately 59% of total non-
bank deposits.

The effectiveness of the critical support functions, namely Internal Audit and
Risk Management, was considered to be significantly compromised. The
Board must immediately rectify this, including but not limited to, the
i ion of practices which d the independ of each of
the support functions noted.”

208. Although not reflected in the executive summary, the Report also noted that, in five

instances, Future Bank overstepped the precautionary cap on Iranian exposure, which the

CBB had set at USD 1,019m in its country exposure report of September 30, 2008. The

Board was thus required to establish robust controls over the exposures to Iran to ensure

full compliance with the CBB requirements. ”°

On May 6, 2009, Dr. Seif, the CEO and Managing Director of Future Bank responded to

the Inspection Report.”!

He observed that, since receiving the 2006 CBB Inspection
Report in 2007, Future Bank had taken the opportunity to pro-actively strengthen
corporate governance, internal controls, risk management and controls and credit culture,
including through the appointment of KPMG and Ernst & Young to advise on policies
and procedures. To his letter, Dr. Seif attached an action plan addressing the issues raised
by the Inspection Report, and in particular, stating that, in the five instances identified by
the CBB where the Iranian exposure limit was exceeded, there was no actual excess. In
reality, Future Bank’s report contained errors, and they were rectified because it was clear

that the exposure was within the prescribed limits.

(e) Subsequent CBB Reports and Examinations

On April 12, 2009, Future Bank wrote to the CBB requesting an extension of its
exemption from limitations to the exposure to its Iranian shareholders, which were set to
expire on June 30, 2009 until June 30, 2011. Future Bank requested the approval of the
extension in return for a commitment of limiting its exposure to its shareholders, BMI
and BSI, to 60% of its capital base. Following a meeting with the CBB, Future Bank
explained that such extension was required to maintain its profitability, including due to
the fact that its “Iranian shareholder banks together have more than 50% of the Iran
import market share”.’*

The CBB answered on July 21, 2009 demanding that Future Bank diversify its exposures
“over a wider range of counterparties” and to limit its exposure to BMI and BSI to 40%

of its capital base by September 2009.7

In the meantime, on April 23, 2009, the CBB had directed Future Bank to (a)
“immediately cease all non-trade related cross border transactions similar to those
provided on behalf of Post Bank of Iran and Export Development Bank of Iran”; (b)
amend its existing account criteria classification and implement criteria in compliance
with the CBB requirements, in relation to wholesale and retail accounts held at Future
Bank; (c) seek and obtain the prior written approval of the CBB’s Compliance
Directorate on the appointment of an external auditor for the 2010 AML/CFT audit; and
(d) “provide detailed analysis on the account of Intra National Industrial Company”, in
particular, in connection with wire transfers and the veracity of the line of credit

documents.”

In the same letter, the CBB requested that Future Bank review the attached Anti-Money
Laundering and Terrorism Financing Report (the “2009 CBB Report”), and requested

comments within one month.”>

(f) The 2009 CBB Report

In the 2009 CBB Report, the CBB examined Future Bank’s compliance with its money

laundering regulations. Among other matters, the report noted the following:

a. The majority of client files reviewed contained the required legal and
identification documents, but raised concerns about know-your-customer
(“KYC”) due diligence. Accordingly, the CBB required Future Bank to
establish and maintain thorough Original Identification Documents (“OID”)
procedures, especially in respect of Intra National Industrial Chemicals
Company;

b. Future Bank did not have an automated system to monitor high-risk accounts.
Hence, the CBB directed Future Bank to establish such a system to allow the
identification of a significant or abnormal activity on accounts held in

particular by PEPs and charities;

The CBB was concerned that Future Bank may have caused a European
counterpart to contravene Iran sanctions, by accepting instructions from
Iranian banks to forward funds without including all originator information
when making the transfers. It concluded that Future Bank needed full

originator information for cross-border transactions;

The CBB was also apprehensive of the due diligence taken in collecting
customer information, especially since the majority of wholesale customers

were not account holders and thus high risk;

Future Bank was accepting business introduced by Post Bank of Iran and
Export Development Bank of Iran, the latter being an OFAC designated
sanctioned entity. These banks were routing funds through Future Bank due
to the UN sanctions. In several instances, Future Bank had not included all
originator information in the swift transfers, thus not disclosing the true
origin of the funds. As a result, Future Bank may have unintentionally caused
its European counterpart to unknowingly contravene UN and other

sanctions.”°

215. In the covering letter enclosing the 2009 CBB Report, the CBB directed that Future Bank

16

take the following actions:

To immediately cease all non-trade related cross border transactions similar
to those on behalf of Post Bank of Iran and Export Development Bank of

Tran;

To rectify the account criteria classification pertaining to wholesale and retail

accounts to ensure full compliance with the CBB requirements;

To seek the necessary prior written approval from the CBB’s Compliance
Directorate on the appointment of an external auditor for next year’s

AML/CFT audit;

d. To provide a detailed analysis of the account of Intra National Industrial
Chemicals Company, specifically justifications for the wire transfers and

genuineness of the letter of credit documentation.””

In answer, on May 20, 2009, Future Bank affirmed that it had resolved all shortcomings

identified in the Report, except for the following:

a. It was finalizing an automated AML system, which would also monitor high-
tisk accounts, including those held by PEPs and charities. The bank
represented that it expected to implement the system by the end of 2009. This
system would also assist Future Bank in monitoring compliance with the
CBB’s directions in respect of the UNSC resolutions on terrorist financing,

which were at that time manually verified;

b. It would submit a “detailed report” on Intra National Industrial Chemicals

company by the end of May 2009; and

c. It would review its account classification criteria and bring them in line with

the CBB guidelines.”*

(g) Ernst & Young Report for 2009

On April 28, 2010, Future Bank supplied a report prepared by Ernst & Young to the CBB
Retail Banking Supervision Directorate (the “Ernst & Young Report for 2009”).”? It is
common ground that this report (and subsequent reports prepared by Ernst & Young and,

later, KPMG) is not an audit.

While largely positive in its assessment of the activities of Future Bank, the Ernst &
Young Report for 2009 identified a few of areas for Future Bank’s improvement. In

particular, the findings of the Report can be summarized as follows:

a. The policy and procedural framework complied with the CBB Rulebook;

b. Aneffectiveness testing of ten payments (five outward and five inward wire
transfers) showed that all originator information was on file, which was an

improvement compared to the deficiency recorded in the 2009 CBB Report;

c. A due diligence sample on five correspondent banks showed compliance

with relevant requirements of the FC Module;

d. The procedures to identify PEPs at the time of establishing business

relationships and thereafter were adequate;

e. CDD and EDD requirements were largely complied with, while some

samples revealed occasional shortcomings, they were exceptional; and

f. A weakness was identified in relation to verifying the source of funds for

transactions over BHD 6,000.°°

(h) The 2010 CBB Report

On May 23, 2010, the CBB issued a follow-up report based on an inspection conducted
by the competent Directorate from January 21, 2010 to February 25, 2010 (the “2010
CBB Report”).81

The 2010 CBB Report found “weaknesses [constituting] violations of the CBB
regulations in respect of High Level Controls, Financial Crime and Credit Risk
Management”. It noted that, while Future Bank had made “substantial efforts” to remedy

deficiencies raised in previous reports, several matters required attention:

The Board must ensure that systems are in place to identify, measure and
control the risks to which Future Bank is exposed in its business activities. In
fulfilling such responsibilities towards risk recognition and assessment the
Board and Management should give due consideration to the views raised by
Risk Management. This would facilitate the implementation of proper risk

Finally the Board is encouraged to enhance the overall credit culture in Future
Bank. The Board also needs to consider the consistent implementation of
Ernst and Young's proposed rating system and enhance the diversification of
the credit portfolio across various security types and economic sectors.*?

In connection to Future Bank’s Iranian exposure, a review of the position on December
1, 2009 had revealed that such exposure stood at BHD 367.043 million against the
precautionary cap of BHD 84.329 million. The 2009 country exposure reports prepared
by Future Bank mentioned 14 cases of violations of the cap, which had not been reported
to the competent Directorate,** and which called for controls to avoid recurring breaches

in the future.*4

According to the Respondent, Future Bank was then contemplating an automated system
called SafeWatch, but postponed its installation while simultaneously representing to the
CBB that it was working on installing an automated solution.** The Respondent alleges
that SafeWatch was not installed until 2012.*° In any event, according to the Respondent,
Future Bank used a system to override SafeWatch’s filters (through the so-called “Good

Guys List”) allowing transactions with sanctioned entities.*”

The Claimants do not deny the existence of the so-called “Good Guys List”. They point
out, however, that these allegations relate to events in 2009 when Future Bank was not
bound by the U.S. sanctions, and the Respondent has not demonstrated that any entities

in the “Good Guys List” fell under sanctions that applied in Bahrain.**

The Respondent points to an incident uncovered when Future Bank was under
administration, involving the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (“IRGC”), a

sanctioned entity as an example of Future Bank’s intentionally misleading the CBB.*°

The incident turned on a high-performance powerboat, Bladerunner 51, manufactured in
the UK. According to the Respondent, export of the powerboat was restricted by the U.S.;
however, in 2009, Future Bank funded the unlawful shipment of this powerboat to an

Tranian entity, in breach of the U.S. sanctions.°°

On June 10, 2010, the Future Bank CEO Dr. Seif wrote to the CBB that Future Bank had
put in place procedures to monitor country exposure. He accepted that breaches had
occurred on the days identified by the 2010 CBB Report, but not to the extent alleged
there. The breaches were due to currency fluctuations. Asked to clarify its position on
currency fluctuations, the CBB had advised Future Bank that such breaches did not need
reporting. Hence, said Dr. Seif, all breaches could be accounted for, save for a purely

technical one.*!

that all outstanding issues had been resolved by December 12, 2010.

D. THE CBB DIRECTIVE OF 8 SEPTEMBER 2010 AND THE EVENTS OF 2011
1. UNSC Resolution 1929 and the 2010 CBB Directive

On June 9, 2010, the UNSC adopted Resolution 1929, recalling its previous resolutions

concerning Iran’s nuclear programme and calling upon all States to:

prevent the provision of financial services, including insurance or re-
insurance, or the transfer to, through, or from their territory, or to or by their
nationals or entities organized under their laws (including branches abroad),
or persons or financial institutions in their territory, of any financial or other
assets or resources if they have information that provides reasonable grounds
to believe that such services, assets or resources could contribute to Iran’s
proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities, or the development of nuclear
weapon delivery systems, including by freezing any financial or other assets
or resources on their territories or that hereafter come within their territories,
or that are subject to their jurisdiction or that hereafter become subject to their
jurisdiction, that are related to such programmes or activities and applying

incorporated in their territory or subject to their jurisdiction to exercise
vigilance when doing business with entities incorporated in Iran or subject to
Iran’s jurisdiction, including those of the IRGC and IRISL, and any
individuals or entities acting on their behalf or at their direction, and entities

[...] take appropriate measures that prohibit in their territories the opening of
new branches, subsidiaries, or representative offices of Iranian banks, and
also that prohibit Iranian banks from establishing new joint ventures, taking
an ownership interest in or establishing or maintaining correspondent
relationships with banks in their jurisdiction to prevent the provision of
financial services if they have information that provides reasonable grounds
to believe that these activities could contribute to Iran’s proliferation-

228. Following up on this Resolution, on September 8, 2010, the CBB issued a directive to all

banks requiring that “all licenses [sic] in the Kingdom of Bahrain must ensure that they
are fully compliant with the requirements of all United Nations Security Council
Resolutions imposing sanctions on the Islamic Republic of Iran, most recently UNSC
Resolution No. 1929 of 2010” (the “CBB Directive”).*° The CBB Directive also required
licensed institutions to familiarize themselves with the sanctions imposed by the U.S.
pursuant to the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divesture Act of

2010, and “ensure that they do not fall foul of its provisions”.°°

2. The Events of 2011

On June 5, 2011, Future Bank’s then CEO, Mr. Gholam Souri, and representatives of the
AUB attended a meeting with the Executive Director of the Banking Supervision
Division of the CBB, Mr. Khalid Hamad. According to the Claimants, Mr. Hamad told
the representatives of Future Bank that the CBB had decided to revoke Future Bank’s
license.”” Mr. Hamad also invited the Bank’s representatives to convey to their

shareholders that the CBB recommended that they consider voluntary liquidation.

The Respondent disagrees with this narrative of the 2011 meeting. Governor Al Maraj
recalls that the meeting was an invitation to “consider voluntarily winding up Future
Bank” to “underscore just how urgently Future Bank needed to reform and live up to its
commitments”.*®

In a letter addressed to Governor Al Maraj a few days later on June 10, 2011, the
shareholders of Future Bank referred to the CBB’s decision to “revoke the license of FB
and its request for the FB shareholders to consider a voluntary liquidation process”,”? and
stated their intention to take this recommendation under consideration. They also

requested a meeting to seek advice on an action plan.

On June 15, 2011, Iran’s Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance, H.E. Mr. Seyed
Shamseddin Hosseini wrote to his Bahraini counterpart, H.E. Mr. Sheikh Ahmad Bin
Mohammed AI Khalifeh, about the CBB “orally stating that [Future Bank] has to be
closed down instantly” and requested that H.E. Mr. Al Khalifeh “investigate the matter
and cancel the order”.!°

It is the Claimants’ case that Bahrain’s action was politically motivated in the light of the
events in Bahrain linked to the Arab Spring and allegations of Iran’s involvement in these

events. The Claimants consider that Bahrain’s Report to the UNSC on October 31, 2011,

given pursuant to its reporting obligations under UNSC 1929, was one of the reasons that
this “revocation” never materialized. In this report, Bahrain stated that “Future Bank and
financial institutions licensed by the [CBB] have confirmed that no financial assets are

held by the individuals and organizations referred to in the resolution”. '°!

On the other hand, the Respondent speaks of a “warning”! for Future Bank’s repeated
violations of the CBB regulations, alleging, for example, that in April 2011, a prominent
PEP, Mr. Isa Qassim, had been found to hold approximately USD 10.6 million at Future
Bank.!°? The Respondent argues that the Financial Intelligence Directorate (“FID”) of
Bahrain’s Ministry of the Interior had notified the CBB of Mr. Qassim’s holding and that
the CBB was under “intense public pressure” to take action against Future Bank.!* While
the Respondent acknowledges that Future Bank submitted an STR concerning Mr.
Qassim, it contends that this does not show a proactive compliance by the bank, since the
filing of the STR had instead been prompted by the CBB’s express request that Future

Bank investigate Mr. Qassim. !°

E. FUTURE BANK’S OPERATIONS AND COMPLIANCE WITH BAHRAINI LAW (2011-
2015)

1. Future Bank’s Activities (2011-2014)

In January 2011, following the CBB’s directions, Future Bank developed a “Revised
Strategies and Business Plan” for 2011-2013, under which Future Bank would (i) focus

on Bahraini business for future growth; (ii) venture into new business lines to diversify

income streams; (iii) expand into new countries; and (iv) reduce Iranian exposures “in a

phased and prudent manner”. !°°

In its annual report for 2011, Future Bank reported healthy profits (with an increase of
7.1% over the previous year). According to the Claimants, it had decided to put on hold
its intention to expand its business into new countries and “reassessed its expansion plans
within the Kingdom of Bahrain”.'°’ In the same year, Future Bank had developed several
business models, including a so-called “Core Bank System” named TEMENOS to ensure

“compliance with a higher regulatory environment”. !°

The Respondent contends that TEMENOS could not ensure compliance, as it was not a
compliance software system and was distinctively not the automated, risk-based
AMLI/CFT system which Future Bank was required to implement. Instead, according to
the Respondent, it was a system assisting operational efficiency, which even in this

respect, produced inaccurate management information systems (“MIS”) reports.!°

In 2013, Future Bank moved to the “Future Bank Tower’, a large building whose
construction had cost it approximately USD 18.5 million, located in the Seef district in
Bahrain’ s capital, Manama.!'° In the same year, Future Bank also upgraded the operating
systems of its ATMs. According to the Claimants, both developments required advance
approval from the CBB and were therefore an indication of the CBB’s satisfaction with
Future Bank’s operations. The Respondent disputes this characterization; Governor Mr.
Al Maraj describes the approvals as a way for the CBB to protect Future Bank’s Bahraini

customers. !!!

2. The 2011 CBB Report

Following an inspection of Future Bank between September 29, 2011 and October 25,
2011, the CBB issued a report on March 20, 2012 (the “2011 CBB Report”). The

Executive Summary to this report provides in pertinent parts as follows:

The inspection process focused on the credit practices of Future Bank and
demonstrated that Future Bank has continued to follow lenient approach in
sanctioning credit facilities, resulting in substantial deterioration in the quality
of credit portfolio during 2011. [...]

For several restructured/new loans sanctioned by Future Bank the credit
committee of Future Bank has ignored the concerns raised by risk
management function regarding the ability of the borrower to service the
facilities.

Furthermore the credit monitoring process of Future Bank was found to be
weak as Future Bank had not obtained cash flow assessments to ascertain
utilization of funds for the purpose for which the loans were granted.

Moreover deviating from its policy of sanctioning overdrafts for short-term
working capital mismatches, Future Bank has routinely renewed overdraft
facilities without detailed assessment of fund utilization or cash flow position
of the licensee. Additionally, it was noted that loan tranches and overdrafts
were disbursed without corresponding endorsement from approving authority
This raised grave concerns of operational risks arising from deficient control
framework within Future Bank. Therefore, Future Bank needs to explore the
control weaknesses behind such disbursals and avoid the recurrence of the
same in future.

The Board is required to consider the findings of the examination report with
a view to enhance controls over credit review and administrative processes
and to ensure that sound credit culture is established within Future Bank. As
such, the Board must commission an external skilled consulting firm to
review the credit culture of Future Bank and report back to the CBB the
results accordingly.!!5

Future Bank submitted a lengthy response on April 15, 2012, in which it noted that it had

instructed external auditors to conduct a second review of all the accounts perused by the

February 4, 2012, in which they concluded that there were no serious concerns.

3.

The Ernst & Young Report for 2011

242. On May 23, 2012, Ernst & Young submitted its report for 2011 to Future Bank.!!’ This

report provided as follows:

4.

In asample of 10 high risk customer files relating to charities, clubs and other
societies, Future Bank was found to have met all identification requirements,
including confirming the identities of those purporting to act on behalf of the
entities;

For a sample of five correspondent banks, Future Bank had fully complied
with EDD requirements;

Effectiveness testing of 10 payments (five outward wire transfers and five
inward wire transfers) noted that all originator information was on file;

In a sample of five customer files, all records were retained in line with the
CBB requirements;

CDD weaknesses were identified across both individual and entity accounts

in the samples tested by Ernst & Young; and

There had been no AML training delivered in 2011.

Interbank Financial Telecommunication (“SWIFT”) code registry. Future Bank reported

that as a result, it had made “payment arrangements through test key mechanism

separately entered into with correspondent banks” to effect payments. '!*

On March 26, 2012, the CBB, following this disconnection, sent a letter to Mr. Souri of
Future Bank, notifying him of the CBB’s decision to suspend Future Bank’s membership
of two other financial settlement systems (Real Time Gross Settlement System and
Scripless Securities Settlement System) “to eliminate any prospective risks to the

financial sector”.!!

On the same day, the CBB sent a circular to all banks operating in Bahrain stating that,
following Future Bank’s disconnection from SWIFT, their dealings with Future Bank
were to be “at their own risk”.!2° On April 1, 2012, after a meeting between the CBB and
Future Bank, the CBB issued a second circular in relation to the matter, advising banks

to disregard the earlier March 26 circular. '?!

The SWIFT cut-off led the CBB to suspend from April 2, 2012 Future Bank’s
membership from two other financial settlement systems (the Real Time Gross
Settlement System (RTGS) and the Scripless Securities Settlement System (SSS)) “to
eliminate any prospective risks to the financial sector”, while noting that this “suspension
does not extinguish Future Bank’s responsibilities and potential liabilities at law”.'? As
aresult, the cut-off from SWIFT made Future Bank lose access to international banking,
and other banks in Bahrain were no longer willing to transact with Future Bank or accept

its cheques. !7°

According to the Claimants, the CBB assisted Future Bank with its transactions following

the disconnection by handling and clearing, on a daily basis, Future Bank’s

transactions. !?4 The Respondent rejects the implication that this amounted to implicit
support from the CBB, noting that this mechanism for clearing local transactions was
borne of an intention to minimize disruptions to Bahrain customers, and “protect [...]

local depositors and transactions of Bahraini-based customers”. !75

The system adopted by Future Bank as an alternative to SWIFT was the Test Key

mechanism. !7°

The Respondent further contends that Future Bank had implemented an alternative
messaging system (“AMS”) many years prior to the disconnection from SWIFT, and had
concealed this use from the Bahraini authorities.'*” The Respondent accepts that AMS,
with “ordinary due diligence, record-keeping and reporting requirements would be
consistent with the CBB laws and regulations”, and it finds the concealment and the
“misrepresentation about Future Bank’s extensive use of AMS prior to 17 March 2012,

as prohibited under Article 163 of the CBB Law”.!78

The Claimants reject these statements, asserting that “it is simply not plausible that any
alleged use by Future Bank of the Test Key mechanism prior to 2012 would have gone
unnoticed by the CBB...given the extent of internal checks and balances, external audits,
inspections undertaken by the CBB”.'?? The Claimants refer to an internal Compliance
Department Update that was prepared for the Audit Committee, in which Future Bank
had contemplated keeping “the Fully [sic] automated AML System on hold for the time
being until reinstatement of SWIFT”.'*° The Claimants recall that Mr. Malek sat as
Chairman of this Audit Committee. The Claimants explain that as a result of the cut-off,

the number of transactions and new customers giving rise to suspicion was significantly

reduced, and therefore it was no longer warranted for the implementation of such an

automated system. !!

According to the Respondent, such a failure to detect the illicit use of AMS is
unsurprising as the first internal audit on its use came in 2012,'*? and that AMS was not
listed in Future Bank’s policies and procedures before that date.'*? The Respondent

alleges that this practice took place before the SWIFT cut off.

5. The 2012 CBB Report

The CBB’s Compliance Department conducted an assessment of Future Bank in April
2012 in order to examine Future Bank’s compliance with the FC Module. This

assessment resulted in the production of a report dated October 31, 2012 (the “2012 CBB

Report”).!*+

The covering letter to the 2012 CBB Report provided as follows:

Future Bank was found to be in breach of several requirements stipulated
under FC Module of Volume 1. Furthermore, Future Bank failed to address
most of the deficiencies raised previously in the licensee’s AML/CFT report
in 2006.

Below is a summary of the issues that were pointed out in the report, which
will have to be addressed in Future Bank’s response to the CBB:

. Future Bank fell short in implementing the rules and regulations
stipulated under the CBB’s FC Module and, therefore, found to be in
breach of key regulatory requirements.

. Major deficiencies were noted regarding the licensee’s compliance
with customer identification requirements.

. The customer due diligence performed by Future Bank with respect
to Politically Exposed Persons fell short of the FC Module
EDD requirements.

. No evidence of Enhanced Due Diligence was found in the KYC files
of non-profit organizations’ accounts and a significant number of the
selected accounts included expired and/or missing KYC documents.

. Future Bank lacks an automated transaction monitoring system that can
efficiently and reliably detect significant or abnormal transactions.

. The fact that Future Bank has submitted only one STR in 2011 raises
the examination team’s concern regarding the effectiveness of the
manual monitoring process implemented by Future Bank.

. Future Bank refrained from producing KYC records in relation to two
Iranian financial institutions and failed to state a justification for the
unavailability of such documents. The examination team has also
observed inconsistent formats of account statements among the various
financial institutions requested as part of the selected sample.

 

. Future Bank was found to be in breach of the CBB Directive
EDFIS/C/021/2010 issued on 8 September 2010 regarding sanctions
against the Islamic Republic of Iran.

Considering the seriousness, duration and potential consequences of the
breaches found in Future Bank's AML/CFT frame-work, your bank is
required to submit to the CBB, within a period of one month from the date
of this letter- an action plan with definitive target dates to resolve all the issues
raised in the attached AML/CFT examination report.'>

254. The 2012 CBB Report also noted the following:

a. whilst Future Bank checked against the CBB-issued list of sanctioned
persons and entities before opening an account, Future Bank was found to be
“in breach” of the CBB Directive for conducting U.S. dollar-denominated
“dealings with Iranian Financial institutions”, and for continuing to maintain

business with “sanctioned entities”;!°°

b. that Future Bank failed to incorporate an “automated transaction monitoring
system that can effectively and reliably detect significant or abnormal
transactions”, instead leaving it to the MLRO to manually conduct a daily

review of transactions exceeding BD 6,000;!*7

c. there was no indication that Future Bank was to decrease its current exposure
in relation to sanctioned entities, and further notes that “the fact that [Future
Bank] continued its dealing with the Central Bank of Iran and other Iranian
institutions after the CBB Directive was issued raises serious concerns
regarding Future Bank’s commitment to directives and regulations enforced

by [the CBB]”. !38

255. Future Bank submitted its comments on November 29, 2012, noting:

Acceptance that there could have been a few lapses relating to updating KYC

records;

No corresponding banking relationship had been established without the

approval of the appropriate authority;

Future Bank’s MLRO reviewed reports generated and inquired about any
unusual transactions, and fewer STRs by itself did not indicate that there was
a lack of monitoring or staff members lacked training but that Future Bank’s
transaction volume (and thus the number of potentially suspicious

transactions) had come down drastically due to sanctions;

Future Bank was not in breach of the 2010 CBB sanctions directive. It
continued the relationship with Iranian banks/financial institutions/Central
Bank of Iran only to the extent that it facilitated funding of existing
assets/liquidity management. Future Bank’s exposure to Iran had decreased
from BD 371.746 million (as of October 31, 2010) to BD 347.741 million (as
of November 22, 2012), which it claimed testified that Future Bank was

making sincere efforts to comply with the CBB’s sanctions directive;

Future Bank continued its relationship with Iranian banks/Central Bank of
Iran for reasons explained to the CBB, namely that Future Bank relied on
deposits from the Central Bank of Iran for funding and liquidity needs, and
the need to keep Iranian banks as correspondent banks to manage Future

Bank’s assets portfolio in Iran.'*?

256. The Claimants submit that through this letter, Future Bank “expressly communicated to

the Respondent

the CBB” the “fact that Future Bank would rely on [...] an alternative system”, referring

to the ‘Test Key system’ alleged to be a violation of applicable laws and regulations by

257. On December 3, 2012 Mr. Al-Najem sent a memorandum to Mr. Swailim, Head of
Investigations, to say that notwithstanding Future Bank’s letter, it was in breach of the
CBB 2010 Directive on sanctions.'“! The memorandum outlined the examination team’s
concerns about Future Bank’s response to the examination conducted in April 2012. It

highlighted the following matters:

a. Future Bank failed to explain the absence of a sound methodology to assess

the client’s AML/CFT risk;

b. There was no appropriate action plan for KYC-related issues in relation to

PEP accounts;

c. Future Bank was in breach of the CBB Directive of September 8, 2010, since
it had failed to cease its business relationships with Iranian financial

institutions and the Central Bank of Iran;

d. It was in breach of UN Security Council Resolution UNSC 1929 in its
relations with the Central Bank of Iran, the maintenance of which Future

Bank said was vital as it was its main depositor;

e. Notwithstanding Future Bank’s disconnection from the SWIFT network, it
was conducting dollar-denominated transactions with Iranian financial

institutions, and had given no written explanation;

f. Future Bank claimed that its Iranian exposure had been decreasing during
2010-2012, but its quarterly reports showed that it was increasing. The net
decline of approximately BD 24 million was measured based on Future

Bank’s initial total exposure and not its ongoing progress. '4?

258. A handwritten note on the memorandum suggested that there should be a meeting with

Future Bank. '

This meeting took place on December 11, 2012. The CBB and Future Bank met on this
date to discuss a number of matters, including Future Bank’s difficulties following the
SWIFT disconnection as well as its exposure to Iranian sanctioned entities. At this
meeting, Future Bank expressed its thanks to the CBB for supporting it and enabling it
to maintain and increase banking operations in Bahrain following the SWIFT
disconnection. Among other matters, the attendees discussed Future Bank’s plans, which
included mobile banking, relocation of ATMs, and Future Bank’s Iran exposure. Noting
an increase in such exposure, the CBB inquired as to Future Bank’s exposure to
connected counterparties (BSI and BMI) and “reiterated to Future Bank that it must
further reduce its exposure to Iran”.'44 Future Bank explained that the short-term
exposure (less than 3 months) consisted of the amounts in current accounts and

placements only, whereas the longer-term exposure had “reduced significantly”. '*°

On February 14, 2013, Future Bank wrote to the CBB following up on the meeting of

December 11, outlining an action plan to:

a. reduce Future Bank’s Iran exposure, highlighting that Future Bank’s “Tran
Loans & Advances portfolio has continuously dropped in the last three
years”, and explaining that the loan repayments from Iran and UAE-based
customers has been credited to Future Bank’s Nostro accounts with BMI and
BSI, as Future Bank has been unable to build relationships with non-Iranian
correspondent banks due to international sanctions in relation to such

transactions;

b. resolve the final issue highlighted in the 2012 CBB Report, as all other

matters have been “closed & resolved”; and

c. establish a Special Asset Management unit in order to monitor Future Bank’s

nonperforming loans portfolio. '4°

6. The Ernst & Young Report for 2012

On April 30, 2013, Future Bank submitted a report to the CBB confirming that it had
addressed all issues identified in the Ernst & Young external audit of May 23, 2012, 147

concerning Future Bank’s AML/CFT procedures, systems and protocols. '48
The Ernst & Young Report for 2012 stated as follows:

. The Bank’s policy and procedural framework complied with the CBB
Rulebook.

. Effectiveness testing of 10 payments (five outward wire transfers and
five inward wire transfers) noted that all originator information was on
file.

. EDD was applied to a sample of high risk relationships.

. For a sample of 10 high risk customer files relating to charities, clubs
and other societies Future Bank was found to have met all identification
requirements, including confirming the identities of those purporting
to act on behalf of the entities.

. For a sample of five respondent banks, Future Bank had fully complied
with EDD requirements.

. Some of the customer files sampled displayed CDD weaknesses,
particularly legal entities; in addition for some PEP files source of
funds, source of wealth and expected activity could all be improved.

° There were instances in transactions over BD 6,000 where the source
of funds was not verified.'”
An internal Future Bank report was produced by Future Bank’s Compliance Department
in April 2013, in which it was noted that Future Bank was working on acquiring a risk-
based monitoring system for AML that would identify “significant or abnormal
transactions or patterns of activity”. '*° The Claimants argue that Future Bank had worked
to identify such a system in the period between April and June 2013,'*! but ultimately

found that this type of system was not necessary in the light of the “low volume of

concentrate and focus closely on the daily transactions”. '>*

7. The 2013 KPMG Report

On November 11, 2012 the CBB notified Future Bank that it had decided to appoint
KPMG as an appointed expert for Future Bank to examine Future Bank’s internal audit
function, compliance function, and internal controls.153 On July 4, 2013, KPMG
produced a report on Future Bank’s operational risk activities, internal system controls,

and compliance with the 2012 CBB Report.

On July 4, 2013, Mr. Hamad (CBB) wrote to Mr. Souri (Future Bank) enclosing the
KPMG Report and stating the following:

[...] The Report reflects significant shortcomings in relation to the sound
credit assessment and credit review as well as compliance with the CBB's
Consumer Finance Regulations. It shows weaknesses in the implementation
of strong internal controls for credit portfolio. The internal audit review,
operational risk including KYC di and i
monitoring of Future Bank are not in line with the best practices and the CBB
's rules and regulations. These shortcomings have resulted in serious
deterioration of the loans portfolio and poor oversight of internal controls
over the credit assessment and extension.

 

The CBB is concerned about this situation and expects Future Bank to fully
comply with the relevant rules and regulations.

Future Bank is directed to undertake a thorough review of the enclosed report
and submit an action plan to the CBB - detailing steps to be taken to address
and rectify the gaps identified in the aforesaid report, by no later than 4111
August 2013. Subsequently, Future Bank must provide the CBB with a
quarterly progress report starting from the end of October, 2013, until all the
outstanding issues in the attached report have been addressed to the CBB's
satisfaction. '**

In response, Mr. Souri (Future Bank) wrote to Mr. Hamad (CBB) on July 24, 2013 noting
that the report identified gaps in corporate and retail credit, as well as operational risk

activities, and informed the CBB that it had developed a plan to address all such gaps.

The letter enclosed a gap analysis report and an action plan for the gaps identified. The

CBB was assured that Future Bank would provide a quarterly progress report. !°°

Future Bank reported that it had addressed almost all the issues identified by the 2013
KPMG Report by December 31, 2013, specifically that 54 out of 56 recommendations
had been implemented. Per the CBB’s advice in this regard, Future Bank submitted a
quarterly progress report starting from the end of October 2013 until all the outstanding
issues in the report were addressed. The first progress report was sent to the CBB on

January 29, 2014,!°

8. Special Inspection Reports November-December 2013

A special inspection of Future Bank had been made during the period between October
3, 2013 and October 12, 2013 with the purpose of examining cash inflows and outflows
in the Nostro and Vostro accounts in order to verify Nostro and Vostro Account
reconciliations conducted by Future Bank, and of reviewing letters of credit issued by

Future Bank during the period between June 2013 and September 30, 2013.!°7

Two memoranda were circulated internally within the CBB following this examination,
but were not shared with Future Bank. The first was sent on November 24, 2013 from
Mr. Hamad to Mr. Abdulla (Director, Inspection Directorate) noting that Future Bank
had increased its exposure to Pars Oil and Gas Company (“POGC’”), an Iranian energy
sector company currently under OFAC SDN List and also under U.S. sanctions, and that
therefore Future Bank had not adhered to the CBB circulars on U.S. sanctions. Moreover,
the memorandum reported that a fresh AED 50 million loan had been sanctioned to
MAPNA International, FZE, a company engaged in “developing the FARS GAS Power
Plant Project in Iran”. The CBB found that MAPNA International’s parent company,

“MPNA”, a Tehran-based company, was the project manager in one oilfield of Pars Oil

& Gas Company and so there was indirect involvement with an OFAC related entity. '**

The second internal memorandum was produced on December 30, 2013. This
memorandum, which was sent from Mr. Abdulla to Mr. Mumtaia, Director, Compliance
Directorate (with a copy to Mr. Hamad), notes that the inspection team had observed two
cases where Future Bank appeared to be in “contravention of the CBB circulars on U.S.
sanctions and OFAC restrictions”.'!*° These incidents related again to POGC and
MAPNA. The CBB observed that Future Bank, when alerted to POGC’s designation
under OFAC, explained that no new investments had been made following the CBB
Directive. The CBB finds that Future Bank had reinvested the proceeds from its original
investment in the Eurobonds in March and May 2010, into additional Eurobonds issued
by that company when they became available. As such, the CBB recommended that “a
penalty of BD 20,000” be issued and to “refer the matter to the Compliance Directorate

for assessment and action”, !©°

The CBB reiterated Future Bank’s interactions with MAPNA, concluding that “this [is]
another instance where Future Bank evaded the restrictions placed on entities connected
to the Iranian energy sector”. '°!

According to the Respondent, Future Bank’s investments with POGC in the period
between 2010 and 2015 amounted to a violation of “the CBB’s Directive of 8 September
2010”, as 23 Eurobonds were purchased on or after January 1, 2011, i.e., following the
issue of the CBB Directive.'°? Accepting repayments for the bonds in 2013 and
“purchasing new POGC bonds in the same year”, amounted to a violation of U.S.

sanctions, and by extension, the CBB Directive.'®? The Respondent argues that Future

Bank had misrepresented the 2013 POGC investments as “rollovers and not new
investments”,!™ following an external examination by the CBB. Future Bank then
amended this explanation upon being confronted with new evidence to concede that the
proceeds of the 2010 investment had been put in interbank placements before Future

Bank reinvested them in Eurobonds, when such bonds became available. !©

The Claimants, on the other hand, reaffirm Future Bank’s explanation that at the time the
investment in the POGC bonds was made, the company was not under any sanctions and
the repayments from POGC occurred between March and May 2013. Future Bank denies
all allegations of any subsequent, additional investments in POGC bonds. The Claimants
dispute the accuracy of the documents on which these allegations rest, which in their

submission, are erroneous entries in fact referring to the original investment of 2010.!°

The Claimants also assert that Future Bank had been entirely transparent on these
purchases on the secondary market, having informed the CBB that when the POGC bonds
matured in the first half of 2013, Future Bank used the proceeds, parked them in interbank

placements with BSI, 167

and from there decided to “reinvest this available euro liquidity
in POGC Eurobonds, as and when available on the secondary market, given the

comparatively high rate of return of the same, and limited risk involved”.!°*

9. The Ernst & Young Report for 2013

276. So far as relevant, the Ernst & Young Report for 2013 identified the lack of appropriate
KYC procedure as low risk, and recommended that the bank “put dedicated resources to
remedy the situation and improve the KYC documentation”.!”° With respect to this item,
the Claimants submit that Future Bank accounted for this risk by installing and
integrating a “compliance monitoring” software provided by “Bench Matrix” in January
2014, which assisted in creating a comprehensive risk assessment framework within

Future Bank.!7!

277. Among the matters classified as medium risk, Ernst & Young identified that the nostro
reconciliations prepared for one of the bank’s shareholders, BMI, were inaccurate and
the reconciled balance did not match the amount in the account and recommended that
senior staff accurately review each nostro reconciliation before signing off.'"* The report
also noted, as a matter of medium risk, that Future Bank had granted credit facilities to
25 companies, amongst them National Iranian Tanker Co. and Adel Interntional
Equipment Co FZE, without obtaining their latest financial statements, and
recommended that the bank grant credit facilities after receiving the required financial

information.'” The report did not identify any items as high risk.

10. The KPMG Report for 2014

In 2014 Future Bank decided to appoint KPMG as external auditor,'” and this decision

was approved by the CBB.

On April 29, 2015, Future Bank submitted an external report by KPMG on Future Bank’s
compliance with the provisions of “the Financial Crime Module of Vol. 1 of the CBB
Rule Book”, as required under the CBB Rulebook!” dated April 28, 2015 (the “KPMG
Report for 2014”). The purpose of the report was to examine Future Bank’s compliance

with the FC Module. !7°

The covering letter to the 2015 KPMG Report notes that the report “does not constitute
either an audit or review made in accordance with the International Standards on
Auditing”.!"7 The 2015 KPMG Report notes general compliance with the FC Module,

and makes certain specific findings, including:

a. For domestic and cross border wire transfers, KPMG selected a
representative sample of payments and verified whether Originator
Information and required beneficiary information had been included with all
electronic transfers of funds they made on behalf of, including name, address
and account number of the payer (FC 3.1.1), and the report stated “no

exceptions noted.” !78

b. In relation to CDD, KPMG selected a representative sample of customers
covering existing and new (individuals, corporates, trusts, GCC nationals,
non-residents) and tested the CDD on file against the requirements of 1.2 of

the FC Module, and reported that for 9 of 25 corporates Future Bank did not

hold the most up to date audited financial statements. !7

c. In relation to Enhanced Due Diligence for Charities, Clubs and other
Societies, KPMG selected a representative sample of customers who were
charitable funds and religious, sporting, social, cooperative, and professional
societies and tested whether Future Bank had obtained identities of such
customers from the relevant Ministry confirming the identities of those
purporting to act on their behalf, and for any incoming or outgoing wire
transfer from or to any foreign country on behalf of charity and non-profit
organizations licensed by the Ministry of Social Development were obtained.

The report stated “no exceptions noted.”!®?

d. A representative sample of correspondent banks were selected and the level
of Enhanced Due Diligence for Correspondent Banking Relationships was
tested, which included a review of correspondent banks’ ownership
structures, location of the correspondent and its customers, the respondent’s
AML/CFT controls, purpose of the account and senior management

approval. The report stated “no exceptions noted.” !*!

e. KPMG tested Future Bank’s record keeping controls by selecting a sample
of business relationship records, transaction documents, compliance records
and training records to determine whether these policies were being complied

with, and stated “no exceptions noted.” !82

f. KPMG also reviewed Future Bank’s risk management systems for
determining whether a customer was a PEP at the time of opening the account
relationship and thereafter on a periodic basis, and the report stated “no

exceptions noted”. !83

F. FUTURE BANK’S IRANIAN EXPOSURE

The Parties dispute whether Future Bank violated the CBB’s instructions with respect of
the bank’s exposure to Iranian entities. The CBB’s instructions on Future Bank’s Iranian

exposure can be divided in two parts: (a) those related to the bank’s exposure to Iranian

entities in general, and (b) those in respect of the bank’s exposure to its Iranian

shareholders. While the Parties dispute the legal nature of the CBB’s instructions, the

following communications are relevant in this respect:

. Future Bank’s letter to the CBB summarizing the meeting of August 9, 2007
between the CBB and Future Bank shows that the CBB had “recommended”
that Future Bank not “assume new risks on Iran.” '*4 In the same letter, Future
Bank represented that it would “attempt to source its assets and liabilities to
the extent possible from Bahrain and other GCC countries”; “reduce the share
of activities involving Iranian trade”; and “avoid enlarging our current
exposure to Iran”!®5

, which amounted to USD 1,019 million (equivalent to

This letter of Future Bank is not clear on whether the CBB had issued a mandatory
instruction capping the bank’s Iranian exposure. However, in the 2008 CBB Report, the
CBB referred to the USD 1,019 million limit as a “precautionary cap placed by the CBB”
on Future Bank’s Iranian exposure and required the Bank to establish robust controls

over the exposures to Iran to ensure compliance with the cap.

The record shows that, in the period leading up to the impugned measures, Future Bank’s

Iranian exposure fluctuated as follows:

As for Future Bank’s exposure to its own shareholders, the record shows that, on July
21, 2009, the CBB instructed Future Bank to reduce its exposure to 40% of the capital
base (total assets) by September 2009. !88

Furthermore, on April 1, 2014, the CBB instructed Future Bank to “immediately reduce
its exposure limits to its shareholders, BSI and BMI and bring such limits down to the
outstanding balances as of end of December 2013 [amounting to BHD 174,033 million],
while not undertaking any new exposure to these shareholders”.'*? It further requested
Future Bank to “initiate measures to bring down such exposures to nil, in line with the
CBB’s requirement under the CBB Rule CM-5.5.12 which stipulates that banks must not
undertake any exposures to shareholders with significant ownership (i.e., 10% or more)

of the bank’s capital base”. !°°

Against the background of these instructions, Future Bank’s exposure to its shareholders

fluctuated as follows:

The IAEA established that Iran had implemented these commitments on January 16,
2016.'% Soon thereafter, the U.S.,!°* the UN!® and the EU!%® began easing sanctions

The Claimants argue that in anticipation of the JCPOA, it had informed the CBB on
December 4, 2014, of its intention to expand its international operations into countries
including Iran, Oman, and Malaysia. '°” The Claimants further assert that in the light of
“improvement of the international situation”, Future Bank’s Board of Directors projected

an equity return of 20%, an improvement over the 14% in 2014.!°8

The Claimants assert that while the international community welcomed the JCPOA, it

“hit on [Saudi Arabia’s] fears that the United States wants to abandon them in order to

29199

ally with Iran’ and “jeopardize the Saudi hegemony in the Gulf and the Middle East

region”. According to the Claimants, this led to Saudi political pressure on Gulf States
to cut their ties with Iran, which gave rise to the CBB’s politically motivated measures

against Future Bank.

The Respondent argues that Future Bank could in no way predict whether sanctions
would be lifted at the time it made these projections.””! It denies that the CBB’s measures

were informed by the political considerations arising out of the conclusion of the JCPOA.

H. THE ADMINISTRATION AND SUBSEQUENT LIQUIDATION OF FUTURE BANK
1. Placement of Future Bank under Administration

The Respondent asserts that, on April 30, 2015, the Crisis Management Committee of
the CBB met and decided to place Future Bank under administration pursuant to Article
136 of the CBB Law. It produced a set of minutes of that meeting, which appears to
record that the Committee recommended this action on the grounds that allowing the two
companies to continue to offer their “services under supervision will cause harm to the
production of financial services and the general interest in the Kingdom”.°? The minutes

are reproduced in full as follows:

financial services and the general interest in the Kingdom, the committee
recommends the following:

“Putting Future Bank and the Iranian Insurance Company under the
administration of the Bahrain Central Bank”.

[Signatures]?°

The Claimants dispute that such meeting took place at all. They point to the fact that the
meeting was allegedly held after office hours and that an administrator was available on

the same day.?

On the same day, the Director of the CBB Banking Services Directorate, Mr. Ahmed
Buhiji, delivered a letter from Governor Al Maraj addressed to Mr. Souri, the CEO of
Future Bank, containing the CBB’s decision to place Future Bank into administration

(the “CBB Decision’”).”°> The relevant part of the letter reads as follows:

By virtue of the power vested in the Central Bank of Bahrain (“CBB”) by
Article 136 of the Central Bank of Bahrain and Financial Institutions Law
(Decree No. 64 of 2006, the “CBB Law”), the CBB has today resolved to
place Future Bank into administration.

Your company is required to cease trading immediately. You must give the
CBB's representative, Mr. Ahmed Buhiji, Director of Banking Services
Directorate who is delivering this letter to you, full access to your premises
and business, its records and its systems. Your staff must comply with our
instructions going forward. The legal rights of all directors, management and
shareholders in relation to the company, are now suspended. The CBB has
assumed full managerial control over your business.?°°

Thus, the CBB ordered Future Bank to “cease trading immediately” and provide Mr.
Buhijji, the CBB representative, full access to the premises as well as Future Bank’s

records and systems, asserting that the CBB had assumed “full managerial control”.?°”

Accordingly, in the evening of April 30, 2015 the CBB took control of Future Bank by

securing the premises with the assistance of the security personnel of the Ministry of

Interior, and excluding the bank’s senior management from the premises.°°

On May 3, 2015, the CBB’s Executive Director, Mr. Khalid Hamad, met with Future
Bank’s CEO and Deputy CEO, Mr. Gholam Souri and Mr. Abbas Fatemi, to discuss the
reasons for Future Bank’s placement under administration. The only documentary
evidence of the meeting are the Claimants’ contemporaneous minutes, which record Mr.
Hamad of the CBB informing the representatives of Future Bank that it was a “Sovereign
Decision to put the Bank into Administration’”.”°? Future Bank was further informed that
the CBB “officials will [...] act as the CEO of Future Bank and will run Future Bank
with the help of the Heads of Departments [...] of Future Bank and a team of officials of
the CBB”, and that Mr. Ahmed Buhjji was appointed as the administrator of Future
Bank.?'° According to the minutes, the CBB informed Future Bank at this meeting that
it had “decided to liquidate Future Bank”, inviting the Claimants to agree to “voluntary
liquidation” and that of Future Bank’s four branches, two will be “closed

immediately”.?!!

Following the appointment as the administrator, Mr. Buhjji began issuing first

instructions to Future Bank’s management on May 4, 2015.7!”

On May 7, 2015, the CBB published its decision on the placement of Future Bank into

administration in the Official Gazette (the “Published CBB Decision”).”!? Pursuant to

Article 138 of the CBB Law, “the appointment of the Administrator shall only have effect

on the day following the publication of such notice [in the Official Gazette]”.?!*

The Published CBB Decision stated that the grounds on which Future Bank had been
placed under administration included the fact that Future Bank offered services that could
“cause harm to the industry of financial services in the Kingdom of Bahrain”.?!5

On the date of the publication of the decision, Future Bank sent a letter to the CBB, which
they referred to as a formal appeal against the CBB’s decision to place the bank into
administration.?'° In the letter, the Claimants emphasized, inter alia, that (i) they had been
present in Bahrain since 1971, and were two of the oldest banks continuously operating
there; (ii) they had invested in Future Bank at the invitation, and with the blessing of the
Governments of both Bahrain and Iran; (iii) ever since its incorporation in 2004, Future
Bank had conducted its activity in a transparent manner, providing all the information
and clarifications required by the CBB, and it had a track record of minimal fines or
penalties from the CBB; and (iv) since 2007, the CBB had appointed and maintained on
Future Bank’s Board of Directors two independent Bahraini directors, whose sole
mandate was to oversee and monitor, on behalf of the Government of Bahrain, the overall
functioning of Future Bank, without ever finding any material shortcomings,

infringements, or breaches.
The CBB dismissed the appeal on May 18, 2015 with the following explanations:

Due to the existence of violations of what was decreed by Law number 4 for
the year 2001 regarding the Prohibition of Money Laundering and its
amendments, as well as violations of the Law on the Central Bank of Bahrain
and Financial Institutions, issued by the law number 64 for the year 2006, in
addition to violations of the local and international regulations in relation to
bank transactions with institutions that are subject to international sanctions;

The Central Bank of Bahrain deems that the fact for Future Bank to continue
to offer services subject to scrutiny by the CBB will cause harm to the
industry of financial services in the Kingdom of Bahrain as well as

consequences of said violations in terms of damage to the reputation of the
financial and banks sector in the Kingdom of Bahrain. 7!”

By this time, Mr. Al-Najem was conducting an enquiry into Future Bank’s affairs, and
had provided progress reports on May 5, 20157!® and May 9, 2015.7! The Respondent
says that the CBB’s denial of Future Bank’s appeal was the product of the CBB’s careful
consideration of Future Bank’s violations of the applicable regulations. The Respondent
contends that it took into account the results of Mr. Al-Najem’s ongoing investigation,

which was revealing a fuller picture of Future Bank’s wrongdoings.”

On May 26, 2015, Dr. Hemmati, the dismissed Chairman of Future Bank, sent a letter to
the CBB, requesting that the CBB reconsider its decision to place Future Bank under
administration.”*! Dr. Hemmati referred to Future Bank’s adherence to the CBB
regulations and emphasized that the bank had submitted itself to the CBB’s supervision
and examination, as well as to multiple external audits. He further emphasized the fact
that Future Bank’s Management Committee, including the two members elected and
appointed by the CBB, had reviewed and approved the various examination reports of
the bank. The letter enclosed a copy of the latest report, the KPMG Report for 2014.
According to Dr. Hemmati, Future Bank had not caused any harm to the financial and
banking system of Bahrain. The letter referred to the BIT and requested negotiation and
exchange of opinions between the Bahraini Government and the Claimants.?” This letter

received no response.

2. The 2015 CBB Report

The Respondent asserts that, two days after the placement of Future Bank into

activities.?> The record contains no contemporaneous documentary evidence

demonstrating the initiation of the investigation. It does show, however, that, on May 24,

2015, the CBB issued an Investigation Report (the “2015 CBB Report”).?”4

The Claimants contest the authenticity of the 2015 CBB Report, citing the lack of
corroborating evidence that the Report was indeed produced on the indicated date.”°
They note that the Report was never shared with Future Bank or its shareholders, nor
were they requested to comment at the time.”*° The Claimants further contend that the
Respondent mischaracterizes the contents of the report as “recent discoveries”.
According to the Claimants, the information on the transactions discussed in the 2015
CBB Report had been consistently disclosed to the CBB in the course of multiple

inspection and audit reports.??’

The Respondent asserts that the 2015 CBB Report was a product of an investigation,
which the CBB commenced immediately after it put Future Bank into administration. It
refers to the witness statements of Mr. Al-Najem and Governor Al Maraj who attest to
the drafting of the 2015 CBB Report on the date specified in the report.??* Mr. Swailim,
an employee of the Central Bank of Bahrain corroborated this in his oral testimony,
asserting that once Future Bank was placed under administration, on May 4, 2015, Mr.
Bumtaia, the director of the CBB at the time, requested him to perform the investigation

into Future Bank.?”?

The content of the 2015 CBB Report relates to Future Bank’s multiple alleged violations
of applicable regulations. In particular, the report found that Future Bank violated the

United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Resolution 1747 (2007), UNSC Resolution
1803 (2008) and UNSC Resolution 1929 (2010) as it provided loans and continued to

provide financial assistance to legal entities that were directly and indirectly owned by
the Government of Iran.?*° According to the report, Future Bank was “in direct breach of
the [CBB Directive]...as the Bank failed to adhere to its provisions by providing financial
support and maintaining business relationships, including correspondent banking
relationships, with OFAC sanctioned entities”.”>! The Report also maintained that Future
Bank was in breach of regulations in relation to credit facilities, misuse of accounts, and
filing of timely STRs.?°?

The 2015 CBB Report went on to describe Future Bank’s transactions with specific
clients, which according to the report constituted violations of various applicable
regulations. These included granting credit facilities with no apparent commercial
purposes, failing to report timely STRs, processing large volumes of cash transactions
without obtaining the customer due diligence documentation, approving loans that
supported the financing of terrorist organizations, providing credit facilities to at least 8
Tranian sanctioned entities, and allowing its exposure to BMI and BSI to exceed the limits

set by the CBB.?*

With respect to a number of alleged violations, the 2015 CBB Report was inconclusive

and indicated that further investigation was required.

3. The Liquidation of Future Bank

On December 22, 2016, the CBB resolved to liquidate Future Bank and published its
decision in the Official Gazette.*4

According to the Respondent, it was on the basis of the 2015 CBB Report that the CBB
determined that the extent of Future Bank’s wrongdoings made it necessary to proceed

to liquidation. 7° Conversely, the Claimants contend that the Respondent had resolved

that the bank had to be liquidated.?°°

Following the CBB’s decision of December 22, 2016, the liquidation process has
progressed without the participation of the Claimants. The Respondent asserts that the
Claimants are entitled to the proceeds of the liquidation once the process is complete.?*”
As the record stands at the time of the issue of this Award, the liquidation is still ongoing

and the Claimants still maintain their nominal shareholding in Future Bank.

4. The 2018 CBB Report

In August 2017, following the commencement of this Arbitration, the CBB ordered a
comprehensive investigation into Future Bank’s activities in the period from July 1, 2004
to April 30, 2015. What ensued from the investigation was a report, dated February 16,
2018 (the “2018 CBB Report”), which concluded that Future Bank had misrepresented
its use of an alternative messaging system to the CBB, wire stripped transactions with a
total value of over USD 4.5 billion, engaged in systematic violations of the AML/CFT
Law, the CBB Law, the Financial Crimes Module of the CBB Rulebook, as well as the
CBB Directives implementing the UNSC and OFAC sanctions.?**

While the Respondent has filed the report as a factual exhibit, the Claimants dispute its
probative value. They refer to the 2018 CBB Report “as some sort of sui generis
evidence” and point to the fact that it is a document produced in the course of this

Arbitration in support of the Respondent’s allegations.?*”

Given that the findings of the 2018 CBB Report are not established facts, but are instead
at the centre of the Parties’ dispute, the Tribunal will provide a more detailed summary
of the report’s findings as part of the Parties’ positions and the analysis in the relevant

subsequent parts of the Award.

the date these amounts are determined to have been due to Bank Melli
Iran and Bank Saderat Iran, until the date of payment; and

d. Order any other relief that the Tribunal deems appropriate.*!
At the Hearing, the Claimants amended their request for relief, withdrawing their request
for restitution and claiming monetary damages only. The Claimants also requested, as a

minimum, pre-Award interest at Libor + 2% 2?

In a letter of July 28, 2020, the Claimants requested that “any monetary relief awarded
by the Tribunal be accompanied by language expressly setting out that such monetary
relief shall not be capable of set off against any other amounts allegedly owed by Future
Bank, Claimants, or their respective representatives, in the context of other actions

initiated by Bahrain”.

At the Re-hearing, in response to a question from the Tribunal, the Claimants clarified
their request for relief as follows: “Bank Melli and Bank Saderat each are entitled to
equal share of any monetary award, because they have the same shareholding in Future

Bank.”?3

These requests remained unchanged.

B. THE RESPONDENT’S REQUEST FOR RELIEF

The Respondent has not indicated its request for relief in a specific manner in its written
submissions. However, throughout its submissions it has requested the Tribunal do
dismiss the claims for lack of jurisdiction, as inadmissible or, in any event, as
unsubstantiated on the merits. At the Re-Hearing, the Tribunal asked the Respondent to

confirm that its request for relief is as follows:

PRESIDING ARBITRATOR: Then I have a question about Request for
Relief for the Respondent. I have not found in the record, and if I have not
looked well you will point me to it, an actual Request for Relief, and I
understand from your submissions that you ask for a decision that there is no
jurisdiction, and you will confirm this? As a result of the illegality in making
the investment. You also ask for dismissal on the merits. I think that is it. And

of course both parties also have claims in respect of costs which are specified
in your submission on costs.

Can you confirm that the way I phrased your Request for Relief is correct? It
goes to jurisdiction first and then a dismissal on the merits. “4

In response, the Respondent clarified the content of its request for relief as follows:

PROFESSOR PAULSSON: Yes. We have observed that tribunals sometimes
have different ways of approaching the distinction between admissibility and
jurisdiction, and so in that respect the factual predicates of either relief as a
matter of jurisdiction or admissibility might be the same, but it is a matter of
indifference to us whether the dismissal is on either one of those, but we are
not dropping one for the other.”4°

 
 

PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS

The Parties disagree on whether the claims are admissible. In particular, they dispute
whether Future Bank’s alleged illegal activities render the claims inadmissible under the
doctrines of clean hands and international public policy ((A) below), and whether the
Claimants had to exhaust local remedies before submitting their claims to international

arbitration ((B) below).

The Tribunal will address each of these positions in turn. Before doing so, it notes that
the Respondent has not raised any other objections to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction or to the

admissibility of the claims.

A. ALLEGED ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES OF FUTURE BANK

The Parties dispute whether Future Bank engaged in systematic illegal activities, such as
sanctions violations and money laundering, and whether such activities constitute a bar
to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction and/or render the claims inadmissible. Before setting out its

analysis on this objection, the Tribunal will summarize the Parties’ positions.

1. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent argues that the claims are “inadmissible by reason of the Claimants’

unclean hands or, alternatively, their violation of international public order.”746

According to the Respondent, the clean hands doctrine is a “fundamental principle of
international law and a prerequisite for legal claims”, and is widely recognized in both
the common and the civil law tradition.**” Among the awards having applied the unclean
hands doctrine,”“* Bahrain considers Al Warraq v. Indonesia as a particularly instructive
example. That decision, the Respondent explains, held that an investor relinquishes the
protection of an investment treaty where its conduct is “prejudicial to the public interest”,

irrespective of any hypothetical treaty breach by the host State.?4?

The Respondent rejects the Claimants’ attempt to distinguish Al Warrag v. Indonesia on
the basis of a specific provision found in the applicable treaty, arguing that the “reasoning
makes clear that the tribunal’s reliance on the general principle of unclean hands [...]
was a distinct basis on which it dismissed the investor’s claim as inadmissible”.?°° Thus,
the principle governs irrespective of whether it is “expressly embodied in the text of the
applicable treaty”.?>! Nothing suggests here that the Contracting Parties intended to

exclude the application of general principles of law, such as the clean hands doctrine.?*

Moreover, in connection with situations such as the present one and the one found in Al
Warrag v. Indonesia, where the investor’s wrongdoings post-date the making of the
investment, the Respondent refers to the Paris Court of Appeal annulment of the award

in Belokon v. Kyrgyz Republic on grounds of international public policy. In that case, the

investor had engaged in money laundering operations throughout the life of the
253

investment.
The Respondent further submits that the present case is distinguishable from all the
authorities on which the Claimants rely on the basis of the nature and scale of the
investors’ wrongdoing.* For the Respondent, the clean hands doctrine “should be
triggered [...] in cases where: (a) an investor engages in serious and/or repeated
wrongdoing by, inter alia, making false statements to a State authority; (b) that
wrongdoing is closely connected with the claim [...]; and (c) dismissing the claims in all
the circumstances [is] appropriate, considering such key factors as the gravity and extent
of the wrongdoing, and the absence of te State’s appropriation of the investor’s property
for its own benefit”.?°>

According to the Respondent, the facts set forth in the 2018 CBB Report satisfy these
conditions in the light of the repeated “false statements to the CBB” and the facilitation
of “serious criminal conduct”.*°° To establish the wrongdoing, the Respondent urges the
Tribunal to “consider whether the Claimants’ hands were clean throughout the duration
of the investment, not merely when the investment is made”.*°’ More specifically, the
inadmissibility need not be premised on illegality at the time of making the investment.?**
In the Respondent’s submission, the principle of unclean hands is not “subject to any
arbitrary division between hands that are unclean at the time an investment is made and

hands that are unclean by virtue of conduct after the investment is made”.?°° Otherwise,

foreign investors would be free to commit all kinds of wrongs as long as they complied

with the host State’s laws at the time of the investment.?

In any event, the Respondent alleges that the Claimants’ conduct at the time of making
the investment also falls under the unclean hands doctrine. It points to alleged
misrepresentations at the time of the investment according to which they would operate
Future Bank in accordance with Bahraini law, while directing Future Bank’s staff to
continue Bank Saderat Bahrain’s illegal practice of wire stripping.*°' The Respondent
relies on Inceysa Vallisoletana, v. El Salvador and Plama v. Bulgaria to support the
argument that misrepresentations at the time of making an investment preclude a

tribunal’s jurisdiction.?©

The Respondent thus contends that to entertain a claim in circumstances where the
Claimants’ conduct breaches the clean hands doctrine, at the time of the investment or

thereafter, would be in violation of the integrity of the arbitral process.7

In addition, the Respondent argues that the “Claimant’s violations and outright contempt
of the international order [...] require dismissal of this case.”?°* Relying on World Duty
Free v. Kenya, it submits that the claims are precluded in the light of the Claimants’
“illicit activities [which] implicate public international law and the clearest form of
international public policy - UN Security Council Resolutions”, including international
sanctions intended to “combat [...] terrorism, money laundering, and proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction”, forming an “international consensus against [the

Claimants’ ] unlawful behavior.”?°

The Respondent also emphasizes that, pursuant to the UN Charter, a State’s obligations
under UNSC resolutions prevail over its other international obligations.”°° Hence, non-
compliance cannot be disregarded based on the expectation that the sanctions would be

lifted in April 2015.27

Similarly, the Paris Court of Appeal, in setting aside the award in Belokon v. Kyrgyz
Republic, held that “declining to set aside the award would mean that the investor would

benefit from its unlawful acts, which would be contrary to international public policy”.?°

Apart from acts contrary to UNSC resolutions, for the Respondent, the Claimants’
behaviour also threatened “the health of the international financial system”, which
qualifies also as a violation of international public policy.”® Indeed, investment tribunals
have found fraudulent misrepresentation to constitute an affront to international public

policy,?”° and the same is true of money laundering.?”!

For the Respondent, such breaches of international public policy must be considered as
a matter of admissibility in circumstances where “so much of the conduct was concealed
from the regulator at the time that the regulatory acts in question took place and where
the dismissal of the case would be a proportionate response in the light of the seriousness

of the Claimants’ wrongdoing”.?”?

On this basis, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to rule the claims inadmissible “not

enterprise elsewhere”,””* but also because the Tribunal has a duty to preserve the values

of the international legal system.”

2. The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants argue that no precedent exists in investor-State arbitration for the
Respondent’s submissions in respect of alleged illegalities. They also claim that the
Respondent misrepresents Al Warrag v. Indonesia and erroneously invokes that
decision.” The tribunal in Al Warrag v. Indonesia was asked to interpret a sui generis
treaty provision pursuant to which

[t]he investor shall be bound by the laws and regulations in force in the host

state and shall refrain from all acts that may disturb public order or morals or

that may be prejudicial to the public interest. He is also to refrain from

exercising restrictive practices and from trying to achieve gains through

unlawful means.”
For the Claimants, it was on the basis of that provision that the Al Warrag v. Indonesia
tribunal held that the investor forfeited treaty protection. While the tribunal found that
the claimant’s conduct in breach of this provision also fell within the wider principle of
“unclean hands”, the claims were not deemed inadmissible on the “basis of a self-
standing ‘clean hands’ doctrine”.?”” The tribunal’s determination was only “rendered
possible, or rather necessary” through the specific treaty provision.’”* Since the BIT in
the present case contains no similar provision, reliance on Al Warragq v. Indonesia is

inapposite.?”

Further, it is to the Claimants’ submission that the other cases which the Respondent

invokes refer to “unclean hands” when making the investment. They do not address

unclean hands “during the life of the investment”.2°° Moreover, those tribunals’

reasoning centres on express or implied treaty requirements that investments be made in
compliance with applicable laws.”*! These cases, so the Claimants, are in contrast to the

present one where the investment was made in compliance with Bahraini law.?°?

More generally, the Claimants argue that “investment treaties [...] provide for specific,

 

self-contained, and negotiated frameworks of treatment, which were expressly consented
to by the contracting States, and relied upon by investors” and are lex specialis to general
international law. Therefore, an investment made in accordance with the terms of a BIT
should be governed by that BIT and “any allegations of illegality with respect to an
investment, absent any express term to the contrary, ought to be decided only in the

context of the substantive, procedural and other safeguards provided therein”.?**

For the Claimants, this position has been adopted by a number of investment tribunals.
For example, Oxus Gold v. Uzbekistan dismissed the admissibility objection grounded
on the investor’s illegal activity during the life of the investment, considering it as a
“question which relates to the merits of the case and not to the issues of jurisdiction or
admissibility.”?*+ The Claimants also draw the Tribunal’s attention to Khan Resources v.
Mongolia, which held that “there is no compelling reason to altogether deny the right to
invoke the [Energy Charter Treaty] to any investor who has breached the law of the host
state in the course of its investment”, and that “[i]t would undermine the purpose and
object of the Treaty to deny the investor the right to make its case before an arbitral
tribunal based on the same alleged violations the existence of which the investor seeks to

dispute on the merits”.?°°

According to the Claimants, even if an unclean hands doctrine existed under international
law and were to be applied to the present case, the Respondent would still have failed to

prove any illegality during the life of the Claimants’ investment.?*°

The Claimants further submit that the Respondent’ s objection to admissibility on grounds
of international public policy should be dismissed because it finds no support in
investment jurisprudence. No arbitral decision has held a claim inadmissible due to
violations of international public policy during the life of the investment. The only case
relied upon by the Respondent in this regard is World Duty Free v. Kenya, which

concerned an investment that had “originally been procured by corruption”.?°7

Moreover, as confirmed by several investment treaty decisions, any alleged violations of
international public policy are a matter of substance and therefore, while potentially

relevant for the merits, not a “procedural test for admissibility”.?5*

Finally, the Claimants contend these allegations of illegality were advanced many years
after the CBB Decision and must thus be viewed with caution. The Claimants refer to
Union Fenosa Gas, S.A. v. Arab Republic of Egypt in which the tribunal found that “while
the lapse in time provides, by itself, no complete answer to the Respondent’s allegations
under international law, it raises doubts as to why such allegations were not raised and

investigated by the Respondent’s criminal authorities long before”.”*

3. Analysis

The Parties disagree on whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction and whether the claims are
admissible. The Respondent argues that the Claimants’ violations of Bahraini law and
international sanctions against Iran result in the lack of jurisdiction of the Tribunal and/or
render the claims inadmissible on grounds of the clean hands doctrine and of international

public policy. Specifically, the Respondent submits that Future Bank engaged in

systematic illegal activities, including sanctions violations, non-compliance with rules
against money laundering and financing of terrorism, and other breaches of Bahraini

laws.

The Tribunal will thus first examine whether the alleged illegal activities of Future Bank

constitute a bar to its jurisdiction or to the admissibility of the claims.

(a) Can the Alleged Illegalities Constitute a Jurisdictional Bar?

The Parties put forward conflicting views on whether the Respondent’s objection
concerning the illegal activities of Future Bank relates to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.
While the Respondent primarily argues that the defence is one of admissibility, it has
signaled that it may also be characterized as jurisdictional.” For the Claimants, by
contrast, Future Bank’s alleged illegal activities can only relate to the merits of the

claims.”*!

The Claimants invoke the arbitration clause contained in Article 11 of the BIT as the
basis of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. The clause provides for broad jurisdiction to resolve
“any dispute aris[ing] between the host Contracting Party and investor(s) of the other
Contracting Party with respect to an investment”.*? In turn, Article 1(1) of the BIT
defines the term “investment” as “every kind of asset, invested by the investors of one
Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party in accordance with the

laws and regulations of the other Contracting Party [...].”2%*

Therefore, for the present dispute to come within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, it must have
arisen out of assets “invested [...] in accordance with the laws and regulations” of
Bahrain. The ordinary meaning of this formulation leaves no doubt that it requires that
investments be “invested”, or in other words made in accordance with local law. It does
not address the consequences of any illegal activities in which the investor may engage

after making the investment.

This is not to suggest that the BIT constitutes an insurance policy for an investor who
engages in unlawful activities. However, unlike the illegality that affects the making of
the investment, which places the investment — and thus any related disputes — outside the
scope of the treaty and the treaty tribunal’s jurisdiction, subsequent illegal activities and
their consequences are for the treaty tribunal to rule upon. In other words, once the
investment is lawfully made (and subject to other jurisdictional requirements not at issue
here), the Contracting States have consented to give the treaty tribunal the competence
to adjudicate the disputes arising out of such investment, including disputes about alleged

subsequent illegal activities and their consequences.

This explains why investment tribunals have consistently interpreted provisions similar
to Article 1(1) of the BIT to be temporally limited to the making of the investment.?* To
quote one of many examples, the tribunal in Kim v. Uzbekistan reasoned that the clause

requiring investments to be “made” lawfully was limited in time:

The Tribunal finds that the legality requirement has a temporal dimension.
The word ‘made’, both in terms of its ordinary meaning and its use in the past
tense, indicates that the test applies at the time the investment is established.
It is not a requirement subsequent to the making of the investment. Indeed, if
this were not so, the second use of the word ‘made’ in Article 12 of the BIT
would make no sense [...].7°°

The temporal limitation of the legality clause is not an arbitrary requirement, but one
based on the text of the treaty. Nor is it a declaration that subsequent illegal activities are
acceptable. Rather, the limitation circumscribes the scope of the tribunal’s jurisdiction,

by defining which illegal conduct is within the tribunal’s competence and which is not.

In the present case, the Respondent’s allegations of illegal conduct do not pertain to the
Claimants’ making of their investment in Bahrain. As further detailed in the following

subsection, while there is evidence of certain wrongdoings by Future Bank, the record

contains insufficient evidence to demonstrate that the Claimants have initially made their
investment unlawfully or for the overarching purpose of engaging in illegal activities,
such as money laundering or evasion of sanctions. This distinguishes the present dispute
from Belokon v. Kyrgyz Republic on which the Respondent relies. In that case, the Paris
Court of Appeal annulled the arbitral award because the investment was made through
an illegal collusion with representatives of local authorities and with the goal of engaging
in recurrent money laundering. More precisely, the court found:

serious, precise, and concurring evidence that Insan Bank was taken over by

Mr. Belokon in order to develop, in a State [the Kyrgyz Republic] in which

his privileged relations with the holder of economic power would guarantee

him a lack of any actual oversight over his activities, money laundering

schemes that had not been able to flourish in Latvia’s less favorable
environment.””°

In the present case, the evidence of the alleged unlawful conduct proffered by the
Respondent pertains to activities post-dating the establishment of Future Bank by the
Claimants. The record does not show that the Claimants set up the bank as part of an

illicit scheme or with the primary purpose of engaging in unlawful activities.

Therefore, Future Bank’s alleged illegal activities do not call into question the legality of
the Claimants’ actions when establishing the investment pursuant to Article 1(1) of the
BIT. As a result, this objection does not pertain to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. Put
differently, it is within the Tribunal’s competence to resolve the present dispute,

including the issues of Future Bank’s alleged illegal activities and their consequences.

(b) Can the Alleged Illegalities Constitute an Admissibility Bar?

The Parties dispute whether the alleged unlawful conduct of Future Bank may constitute
a bar to the admissibility of the claims raised in this arbitration under doctrines or

principles, such as international public policy and unclean hands.

The Claimants argue that an investor’s claims are not inadmissible “by reason of the fact
that the investor’s conduct during the life of the investment had breached any so-called

international public policy.”*°’ According to them, if the unlawful conduct does not relate

to the acquisition or procurement of the investment, it does not constitute an admissibility
obstacle to the investor’s claims. In contrast, the Respondent calls this temporal limitation
artificial and arbitrary and argues that the general principles of good faith and unclean
hands as well as the doctrine of international public policy compel an international
tribunal not to entertain claims tainted by serious wrongdoing of the investor, irrespective

of the timing of such wrongdoing.”*

As explained in the previous subsection, unlike the illegality that taints the establishment
or acquisition of the investment, which places the investment and any resulting disputes
outside the scope of the treaty and the treaty tribunal’s jurisdiction, subsequent illegal

activities do not affect the Parties’ consent to arbitration.

That being so, the rationale for the temporal restriction of the jurisdictional legality
defence, which is not to grant treaty protection to an investment made illegally, does not
apply to an admissibility defence under the doctrines of international public policy and
unclean hands. The reason why serious violations such as a breach of international public
policy may bar the admissibility of claims is that international adjudicatory bodies have
a duty not to entertain claims tainted by violations of certain universally accepted norms

pursuant to general principles of good faith and nemo auditur propiam turpitudinem

2
allegans.?°

For instance, faced with evidence of bribery, the tribunal in World Duty Free v. Kenya
declared the claims inadmissible on the ground that the claimant was “not legally entitled

non oritur action.”* It is true that this case related to an investment that had been
acquired using corrupt practices. However, its reasoning as to why violations of
fundamental norms render the investor’s claims inadmissible is relevant to post-

acquisition violations as well.

While in investment arbitration, international public policy has primarily been invoked
in the context of illegalities affecting the making of the investment,**! the underlying
rationale also applies to subsequent illegalities, if they are severe and taint the claims in
arbitration. According to Douglas, an investor whose claims are tainted by a breach of

international public policy must not be “assisted in any way by the arbitral process”:

The justification for treating a violation of international public policy as a

ground of inadmissibility is as follows. The concept of international public

policy vests a tribunal with a particular responsibility to condemn any

violation regardless of the law applicable to the particular issues in dispute

and regardless of whether it is specifically raised by one of the parties. That

condemnation must entail that a party that has engaged in a violation of

international public policy is not assisted in any way by the arbitral process

in the vindication of any rights that are asserted by that party under any law.*”
While this quotation is excerpted from a section discussing illegalities at the inception of
an investment, the rationale that Douglas sets out applies with equal force to illegalities
in the course of the life of the investment. Indeed, if the rationale for the inadmissibility
of claims tainted by serious illegalities is the international tribunal’s “responsibility to
condemn any violation regardless of the law applicable to the particular issues in
dispute”, and the idea that the party having engaged in such illegalities must “not be
assisted in any way by the arbitral process”, there is no reason why the inadmissibility

should be limited to illegalities at the time of the making of the investment.

In one form or another, scholars and adjudicators have recognized that adjudicatory

bodies must not aid a party that engages in unlawful conduct, if the claims are affected

by severe wrongdoings.*” Based on the analysis of the decisions of international courts
and tribunals, Kreindler concludes that the rules that “[n]o one should be allowed to reap
advantages from his own wrong” and that “an unlawful act cannot serve as the basis of

an action in law” are manifestations of the general principle of good faith.*”

There is no justification for the proposition that the unlawful conduct must necessarily
relate to the acquisition of the investment for purposes of the admissibility of claims as
opposed to the jurisdictional requirement of legality of the investment. It is true that, for
the purposes of the jurisdictional legality requirement, the violation must taint the making
of the investment and that, when it comes to admissibility, what matters is whether the
unlawful conduct taints the claims. While the two instances often overlap in practice,

they are conceptually distinct.

Pursuant to the rule of systemic integration embodied in Article 31(3)(c) of the Vienna
Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT), the Tribunal must interpret the BIT taking

into account “[a]ny relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between

the parties”,*°> which includes general principles of law, >” such as the principle of good

faith and those principles underlying international public policy.

In this respect, the Tribunal cannot accept the Claimants’ argument that investment
treaties provide for a “self-contained” regime and that “any allegations of illegality with
respect to an investment ought to be decided only in the context of the substantive,
procedural, and other safeguards provided therein.”*°’ The authorities that the Claimants
cite in this respect confirm the uncontroversial proposition that investment tribunals have
resolved jurisdictional legality objections based on the legality provisions of the
applicable treaties.*°* They do not state or imply that general principles of law are

irrelevant to the admissibility of claims in investment treaty arbitrations.

Thus, the Tribunal’s mandate under the Bahrain-Iran BIT does not exist in isolation, but
in the framework of general international law. The rule of systemic interpretation dictates
that the Tribunal take into account general principles that govern the exercise of its
jurisdiction under that treaty, one of such principles being that claims tainted by serious

wrongdoings are not admissible.

It was on the basis of such principle that the tribunal in Al Warrag v. Indonesia held that
the claimant’s unlawful conduct rendered the claims inadmissible.*°? Although the
applicable treaty contained a specific provision requiring investors to “refrain from all
acts that may disturb public order or morals or that may be prejudicial to the public
interest”, the reasoning of the tribunal indicates that, in addition to this provision, it
distinctly relied on the clean hands doctrine as a general principle of law. In particular,
the tribunal cited the expert opinion of Professor Crawford who observed that “‘the ‘clean
hands’ principle has been invoked in the context of the admissibility of claims before
international courts and tribunals.”>!° The tribunal added that “the Claimant’s conduct
falls within the scope of application of the ‘clean hands’ doctrine, and therefore cannot

benefit from the protection afforded by the OIC Agreement.”?!!

doctrine is an established general principle of law. As described above, international
tribunals have commonly recognized that claims tainted by serious wrongful conduct are
inadmissible, be it under the doctrine of clean hands, international public policy, or other
general principles such as good faith, ex turpi causa non oritur action, or nemo auditur
propiam turpitudinem allegans. For present purposes, it is sufficient to observe that the
common rationale behind these principles applies not only to violations that concern the
making of the investment, but also to post-establishment breaches that may taint the

claims put forward before an international tribunal.

That being so, not every unlawful activity will render an investor’s claims inadmissible
in international adjudications. To have this effect, the illegal conduct must be (i) serious
and widespread and (ii) bear a close relationship to the claims.*!? On the one hand,
sporadic and trivial violations of the law will not trigger the inadmissibility of the claims.
On the other hand, the fact that an investor has committed serious violations of the law
does not mean that such investor must be denied access to international treaty arbitration
as a blanket measure even in a situation where the particular claims do not arise out of
these illegal activities. To warrant a sanction as stringent as the inadmissibility of the
claims, the two requirements of seriousness and connexity must be cumulatively
satisfied. The Tribunal now proceeds to assessing whether these requirements are met on

the basis of the record.

(c) Did Future Bank Engage in Serious Illegal Activities?

To result in the inadmissibility of the claims, the investor’s unlawful conduct must be

severe. *!> The Respondent appears to acknowledge this condition when it insists that it

was the Claimants’ “serious and repeated wrongdoing” that constituted a violation of

international public policy.*!*

In a business as complex and heavily regulated as banking, certain violations are bound
to occur. Even serious violations, such as the facilitation of money laundering or sanction
violations, would not necessarily result in the inadmissibility of the investor’s
international claims as a blanket measure, if they were infrequent and the bank remedied
their consequences and took action to avoid repetitions.*!> By contrast, the position
would be different in circumstances involving pervasive violations forming part of a
business strategy, furthered through non-disclosure or concealment and
misrepresentation of relevant information to the regulator instead of implementing proper

checks and balances. *!

In reliance on the reports of the CBB, the Respondent submits that, between Future
Bank’s inception in July 2004 and the start of its administration in April 2015, the bank
committed innumerable illegal acts. In particular, the Respondent alleges that Future
Bank systematically violated international sanctions against Iranian entities (i); failed to
monitor and disclose suspicious transactions (ii); engaged in recurrent wire stripping (iii);
used the unauthorized Alternative Messaging System (AMS) (iv); and misrepresented its

exposure to Iranian entities. The Tribunal will address each of these allegations in turn.

from 2006 until the bank was put in administration in 2015. Several threshold questions

arise in this respect, which the Tribunal must answer before it enters the analysis of the

specific allegations.

First, as explained above, to justify the inadmissibility of claims, the investor’s wrongful
conduct must relate to a fundamental rule of law. Not all international sanctions constitute
fundamental rules of international law, as some may seek to advance non-universal
political or economic interests of specific States. The Tribunal must therefore determine
whether the sanctions at issue were based on fundamental norms of international law, the
violation of which could render the claims inadmissible. The international legal norms
that underlie the sanctions regime that the UN Security Council has introduced against
Tran starting from its Resolution 1696 (2006) concern the prevention of the proliferation
of nuclear weapons pursuant to the 1968 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons and the preservation of international peace and security under Chapter VII of
the UN Charter.*!’ These are some of the most fundamental norms of international law

and as such form part of international public policy.

The sensitivity and universality of the international concern over Iran’s nuclear
programme is confirmed by the very fact that the UN Security Council managed to reach
ahardly attainable consensus and adopted several Chapter VII resolutions to address this
issue. Importantly, pursuant to Article 103 of the UN Charter, Chapter VII resolutions
take precedence over all other international agreements.*!* In the context of international
dispute resolution, Béckstiegel for instance writes that UN sanctions are “part of
mandatory public international law” and they “will have to be applied by the arbitral
tribunal”.*!° Thus, the sanctions introduced by the UN Security Council qualify as norms

of what is generally called transnational or truly international public policy.*?°

National (US/OFAC) and regional (EU) sanctions are different in the sense that they lack
the degree of universality that characterizes UN sanctions. While the U.S. and EU
sanctions shared in the global effort against Iran’s nuclear program,*?! they did not
themselves constitute fundamental rules of law forming part of international public
policy, insofar as they diverged from the scope of the UN sanctions. More specifically,
not all the persons that the U.S. and EU included in their respective lists of sanctioned
entities featured in the UN sanctions. The record is scarce on the reasons leading the U.S.
or the EU to sanction specific entities that the UN had not designated. Therefore, the
Tribunal will take the UN sanctions as the basis of its analysis of the alleged violation of

international public policy.

Second, the Parties diverge on whether the sanctions imposed on Iran and Iranian entities
by the UN, U.S. and EU were opposable to Future Bank. To state the obvious, the UN
Security Council Resolutions apply to States, which are required to implement the
resolutions pursuant to the UN Charter,*?? and Bahrain is a member of the UN. The U.S.
and EU sanctions in turn apply to persons that are within the prescriptive or enforcement
jurisdiction of the U.S. or the EU.*** Therefore, none of these sanctions apply directly to

Bahraini entities, such as Future Bank.

That being said, Bahrain gave effect to the international sanctions against Iran in various

forms starting in 2007.**4 In February 2007, the CBB issued a circular, implementing

UNSC Resolution 1737 (2006), directing its licensees not to deal with UN sanctioned

entities:

Licensees are directed to prohibit dealing with the designated individuals and
entities, and immediately report to the CBB details of: A. Funds or other
financial assets or economic resources or insurance policies held with them.
B. All claims whether actual or contingent, which they have with any of these
individuals or entities.*”

In March 2008, the CBB further implemented UNSC Resolution 1803 (2008), directing
its licensees “to exercise vigilance and enhanced due diligence over [...] activities with
all banks domiciled in Iran, in particular with Bank Melli and Bank Saderat, and their

branches and subsidiaries abroad.”*7°

A more comprehensive implementation of the international sanctions came with the CBB
Directive of 8 September 2010, which required the licensed financial institutions to

comply with the UN and U.S. sanctions as follows:

With immediate effect, all licensees in the Kingdom of Bahrain must ensure
that they are fully compliant with all United Nations Security Council
Resolutions imposing sanctions on the Islamic Republic of Iran, most recently
UNSC Resolution 1929 of 2010.

Additionally, with immediate effect, all licensees in the Kingdom of Bahrain
must familiarize themselves with the US Comprehensive Iran Sanctions
Accountability and Divesture Act of 2010 and ensure that they do not fall foul
of its provisions.*””

The difference in the language between the two paragraphs just quoted suggests that
Bahrain implemented the UN and U.S. sanctions with different levels of binding force.
The first paragraph requires the licensees to comply with the UN sanctions in
unequivocal terms. By contrast, it is not clear whether the second paragraph formally
transposes the U.S. sanctions or merely warns the licensees not to violate such sanctions

whenever they may apply pursuant to their own terms.

The Claimants presented a record of their contemporaneous understanding of the 2010

Directive being “‘a notice of caution to all other banks which deal with U.S.A. in one

form of another, so that these banks don’t engage themselves with certain entities (listed
in the Act) resulting in attracting penalty from the USA”.*?* This understanding was
communicated to the CBB, which raised no objection at that juncture.*”As for the
Respondent, it has offered no evidence of its contemporaneous interpretation of the 2010
Directive. Nor has it pointed to any examples where the directive would have been read
to expand the scope of application of the U.S. sanctions to the territory of Bahrain.
Indeed, had the 2010 Directive been interpreted as an expansion of the territorial scope
of the U.S. sanctions, that understanding would have prevented Future Bank from

continuing its activities, as Future Bank was itself a U.S. sanctioned entity.

Thus, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the 2010 Directive expanded the scope of
application of the U.S. sanctions. Instead, it must rather be regarded as merely warning
Bahraini financial institutions to comply with such sanctions whenever they applied
under their own terms, e.g., if a particular institution operated on the U.S. territory. It
follows that Iran-related sanctions other than those of the UN Security Council, were not
opposable to Future Bank either under Bahraini law or as a matter of international public

policy.

Third, a recurring question in respect of alleged sanctions violation is whether it was
illegal to receive repayments on a loan or to restructure a loan granted to a borrower
which was initially not a sanctioned entity but was so designated before the

reimbursement or restructuring.

The Claimants’ expert Mr. Brain opines that receiving a loan reimbursement from a
sanctioned entity was lawful or else the borrower would receive “free money”.**°
According to him, while the applicable sanctions prohibit affording economic benefit to
the sanctioned entities, obtaining the repayment of previously granted financing does not

requisite approval from Bahraini and UN authorities” before accepting repayments from

the sanctioned entities,**! which it failed to do.

Paragraph 12 of the UN Security Council Resolution 1737 (2006), which the CBB
implemented in February 2007,*** provides that all funds of the sanctioned entities shall
be frozen. It makes an exception for payments under existing contracts, provided that the

relevant State has determined that the contract is not related to prohibited items:

The measures in paragraph 12 above shall not prevent a designated person or
entity from making payment due under a contract entered into prior to the
listing of such a person or entity, provided that the relevant States have
determined that:

(a) the contract is not related to any of the prohibited items, materials,
equipment, goods, technologies, assistance, training, financial assistance,
investment, brokering or services referred to in paragraphs 3, 4 and 6 above;

(b) the payment is not directly or indirectly received by a person or entity
designated pursuant to paragraph 12 above;

and after notification by the relevant States to the Committee of the intention
to make or receive such payments or to authorize, where appropriate, the

unfreezing of funds, other financial assets or economic resources for this

purpose, ten working days prior to such authorization;**

Accordingly, the collection of payments from a sanctioned entity under a pre-sanction
loan should have been authorized by the relevant State, which would then notify the
Committee of the Security Council. However, for these requirements to apply to private
persons, such as Future Bank, Bahrain should have implemented them at least by
designating an organ that would entertain repayment requests and providing a form and
time limits for such requests. The Respondent has not pointed to any such
implementation. Instead, the CBB’s internal memorandum of November 2013
concerning Future Bank simply took note of “loans sanctioned to Iranian companies prior
to international sanctions being repaid upon maturity”,**+ without qualifying such

repayment as a violation or raising any issue with Future Bank.

Be that as it may, even if Future Bank’s acceptance of the repayment of pre-sanction
loans were considered unlawful, by its nature this illegality would constitute a less severe
violation than providing fresh financing to sanctioned entities. Hence, the Tribunal is not
convinced that, without more, such failures, would suffice to declare the claims

inadmissible.

The position is different when it comes to the restructuring of pre-sanction loans. By such
restructuring, the lender affords an economic benefit to the borrower by improving the
latter’s creditworthiness. If the borrower were a sanctioned entity, such restructuring
would breach the sanctions, which require that “funds, financial assets or economic

resources are prevented from being made available to” sanctioned entities.**°

With these threshold observations in mind, the Tribunal will now review the

Respondent’s specific allegations of sanctions violations.

The CBB Reports allege that Future Bank committed multiple violations of Bahraini and
international sanctions.**° In particular, according to the CBB, Future Bank gave 26 loans
totaling BHD 116 million (USD 300 million) to entities,**” many of which were allegedly
owned, controlled, or associated with the IRGC or other entities under UN, U.S. and EU
sanctions.*** The Respondents’ allegations, which the Tribunal will review in the

following subsections, are summarized as follows:

On July 12, 2012, OFAC designated NITC as a sanctioned entity. On October 15, 2012,
the EU froze NITC’s funds.

In September 2014, Future Bank approved a restructuring of the loan, the repayment of
the principal being postponed until February 22, 2016 and the full repayment due by
February 22, 2018.3*

Pursuant to the CBB 2018 Report, Future Bank’s dealings with NITC constituted a
violation of U.S. and EU sanctions, and thus Bahraini laws and regulations, including the

CBB’s Directive of September 8, 2010 for the following reasons:

(1) Future Bank disbursed a EUR 12.5 million loan to NITC in May 2013,
whereas OFAC had added NITC to the list of sanctioned entities on 12
July 2012, and the EU had begun applying restrictive measures against
NITC on 15 October 2012;

(2) | The stated purpose of the loan to NITC, namely to finance “the first
pre-delivery instalments” of twelve vessels, was fictitious as these
vessels had been delivered to NITC by January 2011, almost two years
before the loan disbursement;

(3) In February 2014, NITC repaid Future Bank EUR 2.5 million towards
the principal, which Future Bank then re-lent to NITC in August 2014,
thereby providing new financing to a sanctioned entity; and

(4) | Future Bank restructured the loan to NITC in March 2014, and then
again in September 2014, again providing new financing to a
sanctioned entity, it did so despite an unacceptable credit rating of the
loan by its internal rating system and despite problems with securing
insurance for the vessels pledged as security.**°
None of these allegations relates to a possible violation of the UN sanctions. As the
Tribunal determined above, Bahrain had not expanded their scope of application of the
U.S. and EU sanctions to Bahraini territory, with the result that the U.S. and EU sanctions
as such were not opposable to Future Bank. In addition, to the extent that they deviate
from the UN sanctions, the U.S. and EU sanctions do not constitute fundamental norms
forming part of international public policy. Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that the

Respondent’s allegations related to the NITC transactions lack merit.

b. Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL)

404. On May 2, 2009, Future Bank approved a loan to IRISL in the amount of
EUR 17 million.* On February 17, 2010, the loan was disbursed.**!

405. In November 2012, the repayment period was extended by one year. Full repayment was

due by August 17, 2016.°°

406. The CBB 2018 Report states that Future Bank’s dealings with IRISL constituted a
violation of UN and U.S. sanctions, and thus Bahraini laws and regulations, including

the CBB’s Directive of September 8, 2010, for the following reasons:

(1) Future Bank booked interest income under a loan granted to IRISL on
17 May 2011, 17 August 2011, and 17 November 2011, without
approval of the CBB or the UN, despite the fact that IRISL and 123 of
its vessels had been designated as sanctioned by the US on 10
September 2008, by the UN on 9 June 2010, and by the EU on 26 July
2010;

(2) | The stated purpose of the loan in the corresponding credit application,
which was “to meet final delivery payment on newly built vessels,
which were delivered six months before,” was inconsistent with other
sections of the Credit Application, where the loan was described as
intended “to meet working capital requirements;” and

(3) Between May 2011 and October 2012, after four of the seven vessels

pledged by IRISL as security came under threat of seizure in the Isle of

Man due to UN designation on 9 June 2010, Future Bank conspired

with IRISL to transfer the ownership of those four vessels from Hong

Kong companies to Malta based companies, and to “de-flag” all seven

vessels initially offered as security in Malta and “re-flag” them in Iran

in breach of UN sanctions. 6

407. In respect of the facts underlying allegation (1), the contemporaneous record of Future
Bank’s relationship with IRISL confirms that the loan was disbursed on February 17,
2010.° This predates IRISL’s designation as a sanctioned entity by the UN (UNSCR
1929 (2010), on June 9, 2010 and by the EU on July 26, 2010. It is true that, by the time
of the disbursement of the loan, the U.S. had designated IRISL as a sanctioned entity on

September 10, 2008. However, as was established earlier, Bahrain had not made the U.S.

sanctions applicable on its territory. In any event, a possible implementation of the U.S.

sanctions would have been effected with the CBB Directive of September 8, 2010, i.e.,

after the decision to grant the loan in May 2009 and the disbursement in February 2010.

As for the repayment of a loan and the payment of interest, which is the subject matter
of allegation (1), the UN sanctions required the States to verify the origins of the funds
and notify the relevant UN entities. However, as discussed above, Bahrain has not
pointed to any implementing legislation specifying verification and notification
procedures for private financial institutions. In any event, here again, a failure of this type

would not constitute a severe violation.

Regarding allegation (2), the Tribunal understands that there was a discrepancy about the
purpose of the loan between two sections in the credit application.*° For the Tribunal,
this discrepancy is insufficient to prove an intent to conceal the true purpose of the
transaction. First, it may be due to various causes, including a clerical error. Second, had
Future Bank meant to hide the actual purpose of the loan, it seems unlikely that it would

have indicated contradictory purposes several pages apart in the same document.

In relation to allegation (3), while the record does not contain sufficient evidence to prove
that Future Bank conspired with IRISL, it does show that it cooperated with IRISL
towards reflagging the vessels, over which Future Bank held security interests. The
contemporaneous exchange between Future Bank’s Tehran representative officer,
Kambakhsh Katami, and its head of Corporate Banking, Suresh Kumar (with the bank
CEO in copy) demonstrates that Future Bank facilitated IRISL’s efforts to evade the
effects of the applicable UN sanctions.*© An internal memorandum shows that the bank
understood the reasons for the relocation and re-flagging of the vessels and turned a blind

eye to the evasion of the sanctions.*°”

Cc. Petrochemical Industries Investments Co, Iran (PIIC)

On August 30, 2007, Future Bank’s Board approved joining a syndicate led by Bank
Saderat to lend EUR 10 million to PIIC.** The loan was paid out and the account was

closed on September 5, 201 1,36

On February 10, 2009, Bank Saderat (London) paid Future Bank its share of the loan
interest into a bank account with Bank Markazi, at a time when all three banks had come

under U.S. sanctions.37°

On July 26, 2010, Future Bank came under EU sanctions, resulting in the freezing of its
EUR account with Bank Saderat (London). Hence, Bank Saderat, which had to credit this
account with Future Bank’s share of payments received from PIIC under the syndicated
loan, was not able to do so without an authorization of the UK authorities. Thus, on
November 18, 2010, Future Bank’s CEO requested PIIC to pay the bank’s share of
interest and principal reimbursement to an account that was not frozen, specifically to

Future Bank’s EUR account with Parsian Bank in Tehran.>7!

Under the heading “Violations of US and EU sanctions”, the 2018 CBB Report states
that Future Bank should have applied to the British authorities to allow Bank Saderat to
credit the payments to Future Bank’s frozen account because they related to a pre-
sanction transaction. Further applications should then have been made to withdraw those

funds on the same basis.*””

The CBB further alleges that PIIC acted as a “front” for sanctioned entities. Yet, it does

so without further substantiation.>”°

The Tribunal notes that the alleged violations do not relate to the provision of financing
to sanctioned entities. Instead, the Respondent alleges that Future Bank received its share

of repayment on a pre-sanction loan without requesting an authorization from the UK

authorities. The Respondent has not pointed to any provision in the EU sanctions that
would require a financial institution to continue receiving payments on a pre-sanction
transaction on a frozen account or to refrain from redirecting such payments to its other
accounts. In any event, as the Tribunal explained above, Bahrain has not transposed the

EU sanctions in its legislation, and thus, they were not opposable to Future Bank.

As for the U.S. sanctions, the Respondent bases its allegation on the fact that Future Bank
received its share of payment on a pre-sanction loan from Bank Saderat (London) at its
bank account with Bank Markazi, at a time when all three banks had come under the U.S.
sanctions. However, the Respondent does not explain how the U.S. sanctions applied on
transaction taking place outside the territory of the U.S. In addition, as the Tribunal
explained above, Bahrain has not implemented the U.S. sanctions in a manner that would

extend their territorial scope of application.

For these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent’s allegations with respect

to PIIC lack merit.

d. — Bahman Group Company Tehran (BGCT)

On August 9, 2006, Future Bank joined a syndicate led by Bank Melli to grant BGCT a
loan of USD 50 million. Future Bank’s share amounted to USD 6,250 million. The term

was four years, with a one year grace period, ending on August 9, 2011.54

BGCT’s shareholder Bonyad Taavon Sepah was added to the OFAC list on December
21, 2010,77> and came under EU sanctions on May 23, 201 1.376

The CBB 2015 Report contains the following allegations:

(1) — Future Bank’s participation in the loan to BGCT constituted a violation
of UN sanctions due to ties between one of BGCT’s main shareholders,
Bonyad Taavon Sepah, and the IRGC; and

(2) On25 September 2014, Future Bank informed Bank Melli that it would
only accept repayment under the loan if it was made in USD or any

other currency convertible to USD in Iran, which constituted a U-turn
transaction in breach of OFAC requirements.*””

In connection with allegation (1), neither Bonyad Taavon Sepah nor BGCT were
sanctioned entities at the time when the loan was granted. Therefore, “participation” in
the sense of granting the loan could not have violated the sanctions. Repayment is

addressed in the context of allegation (2) below.

As regards allegation (2), at the time of the repayment of the loan by BGCT, Future Bank
was under the U.S. sanctions.*”* Among other things, Future Bank was thus prohibited
from using the U.S. financial system for so-called U-turn transactions (including using
U.S. banks for USD transactions). This is stated in a press release of the U.S. Treasury
as follows:

Prior to today's action, U.S. financial institutions were authorized to process

certain funds transfers for the direct or indirect benefit of Iranian banks, other

persons in Iran or the Government of Iran, provided such payments were

initiated offshore by a non-Iranian, non-U.S. financial institution and only

passed through the U.S. financial system en route to another off shore, non-

Iranian, non-U.S. financial institution. As a result of today's action, U.S.

financial institutions are no longer allowed to process these U-turn
transfers.°”°

Compliance with Future Bank’s request for Bank Melli to re-payment in USD or USD
convertible currency in Iran would probably result in a violation of this restriction.
Mr. Sharma indeed explained that “US dollar payments are typically (but not necessarily
always) routed via a US bank even if neither the sending bank nor end-recipient bank is
in the US.”3®° That being so, the record contains insufficient evidence to establish Bank
Melli’s compliance with Future Bank’s request and the existence of a U-turn transaction

through a US bank.

which was a UN sanctioned entity, and that Future Bank breached its duty of vigilance

in dealing with BGCT, it is not substantiated. In particular, the CBB 2015 Report does
not cite any documentary or other evidence for this allegation.**! Tellingly, the allegation

is not repeated in the CBB 2018 Report.

For these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the record does not sufficiently
demonstrate that Future Bank’s demand to Bank Melli that it would only accept
repayment in USD or any other currency convertible to USD in Iran constituted a U-turn

transaction in breach of the US sanctions.

e. Adel International Equipment Company FZCE (AIECO)

In January 2012, Future Bank approved an AED 50 million loan to AIECO,?*? which,
according to the CBB 2018 Report, was one of the eight Iranian entities that received

services from Future Bank while being “sanctioned by the UN/US/EU”.***

There is no evidence in the record to support that the UN, the U.S. or the EU sanctioned
AIECO. In addition, the Respondent did not assert specific sanctions violations. The
CBB 2015 Report merely noted in general terms that AEICO’s ownership structure was
in possible contravention of international economic sanctions. Accordingly, the Tribunal

has no evidentiary basis to find a sanction violation.

The CBB observes that Future Bank “ought not to have done business with entities
controlled by individuals sanctioned by the UNSC.”** It further notes that “it seems
rather possible that ISOC is ultimately positioned as a front-line company to support

SOC’s line of business” and thereby evade the sanctions.*”°

With respect to SOC, evidence shows that Future Bank issued a loan before SOC came
under the U.S. sanctions. The granting of the loan itself could thus not constitute a breach
of such sanctions. The CBB reports do not mention whether and when SOC repaid the
loan, but the Claimants acknowledge that “the SOC loan was reimbursed by September
2013”.°°! Accordingly, Future Bank accepted reimbursement of the loan from an OFAC
sanctioned entity. However, as the Tribunal reviewed above, the U.S. sanctions were not

directly opposable to Future Bank.

In respect of ISOC, the record shows that Future Bank opened an account and granted a
loan to that company and that it did so at a time when the managing director of the sole
shareholder (OIPF) of its sole shareholder (SOC) was designated by the UNSC for his

participation in Iran’s ballistic missile programme.*”

The Respondent has not pointed to
any specific provision of the applicable UN sanctions that prohibits opening an account
and providing a loan in a situation involving this type of indirect connection. That said,
when dealing with entities indirectly controlled by a UNSC-designated PEP, namely Mr.
Maleki, and ultimately owned by the Iranian government, Future Bank ought to have
exercised enhanced diligence.*”? This is particularly so as the Respondent’s allegation
that Future Bank produced no due diligence report identifying the customer’s controllers
and beneficial owners stands unrebutted. The lack of diligence is all the more striking as
the credit application which Future Bank approved indicated SOC as the guarantor of the
loan and the purpose of the loan was vaguely identified as “ISOC’s Long Term Working

capital needs”.**

As a result, the Tribunal finds that Future Bank failed to comply with its due diligence

and reporting obligations with respect of the ISOC loan.

g. Pars Oil & Gas Company (POGC)

On March 10, and May 3, 2010, Future Bank purchased Eurobonds issued by Pars Oil &
Gas Company (POGC) for EUR 17.5 million and EUR 2.5 million respectively.*?* OFAC
sanctioned POGC on December 21, 2010. The bonds matured in March and May 2013,

market.*° At that time, POGC was under U.S. sanctions.

The Respondent argues that Future Bank’s receipt of repayment and interest from POGC

and purchase of bonds violated the CBB Directive on U.S. sanctions.*””

With respect to Future Bank’s acceptance of the repayment and interest from POGC on
the bonds purchased prior to the latter’s sanctioning, as the Tribunal determined earlier,
OFAC sanctions were not directly opposable to Future Bank. That said, the Tribunal
notes an email exchange between the CBB and Future Bank, which ensued after the
CBB’s 2013 review of the bank, which shows that Future Bank initially misrepresented
its reinvestment of the proceeds in POGC Eurobonds as “rollovers and not new
investments.”?°? The CBB challenged this assertion stating that the evidence did “not
indicate rollover for the specific investments by the Bank”, after which Future Bank
conceded that “[t]he maturity proceeds of such bonds were first parked as interbank
placements before the bank again reinvested in Euro bonds when the bonds became
available.”°°? While these acts did not breach the sanctions, the Tribunal takes note of
the misrepresentation with a view to its overall assessment of Future Bank’s allegedly

unlawful activities.

In September 2012 and between January and March 2014, respectively, Future Bank
granted loans to BTC (EUR 15 million), MAPNA (AED 50 million) and FGPP (EUR 25

million). These loans were partially secured by POGC Eurobonds.

The CBB reports that Future Bank granted the loans as a mean to earn income from

POGC bonds without owning them, thereby violating OFAC sanctions.

The record evidences that Future Bank accepted Eurobonds issued by POGC as collateral
for loans granted to the three entities at issue at a time when POGC was under U.S.
sanctions. The record also shows that in relation to BTC Future Bank expected that the
“source of repayment for the disbursed credit facility will be through the interest payout
from the proposed pledging of [POGC] bonds covering 100% of the facility amount.”
The bank identified the interest payments as primary source or repayment, while adding

that “there is also additional comfort that the financials of the borrower is good.”4"!.

As the Tribunal explained above, Bahrain did not take over the U.S. sanctions in its
legislation in a manner that would expand the scope of application of such sanctions.
Therefore, the OFAC sanctions were not directly opposable to Future Bank, with the

result that the Respondent’s allegations with respect to the POGC bonds lack merit.

i. Other transactions

The CBB 2018 Report lists a number of other loans granted by Future Bank to various
entities between August 2007 and January 2012 under the heading “Violations of

sanctions on the IRGC and the government of Iran”.4°

The CBB labels these transactions as (i) “suspicious loans to Iranian corporate customers
that appear to be fronts for sanctioned entities” and (ii) “loans to Iranian companies

apparently linked to sanctioned entities”, indicating that certain of these loans constitute

government of Iran’ without further support for these allegations.

The CBB itself recognizes that “[t]hese files need to be investigated further”.*°

Consequently, these sanction violations cannot be regarded as established.

Overall, the record contains only sporadic evidence of violations of the applicable
sanctions by Future Bank. To assess whether sanction violations may have been more
widespread than documented in the record, the Tribunal will now review circumstantial
evidence, in particular evidence of Future Bank’s alleged practices adopted to conceal

transaction information.

ii. Me ‘ing and Disclosure of Suspicious Tr

In Bahrain, like in other jurisdictions, banks are under a duty to file suspicious transaction
reports (STRs) and to comply with the regulator’s instructions on developing and
applying internal anti-money laundering (AML) and counter financing of terrorism
(CFT) policies.*°° Banks in Bahrain also have a duty to undertake due diligence and to
maintain ongoing monitoring regarding their customers and transactions.‘ In addition,
as of October 2007, for transactions relating to Iran, Bahraini banks were under an
obligation to apply “enhanced due diligence” measures when opening an account and for

the duration of the banking relationship.4””

The CBB claims that Future Bank breached these duties as it “failed to adequately report

[STRs] for irregular transactions [...] [and] exercised willful blindness on many of the

facilitate[d] transactions without the proper implementation of the relevant customer due
diligence measures [...]. For certain corporate and individual accounts, Future Bank
failed to provide valid documentary evidence to identify the customer’s source of

Having reviewed the record, the Tribunal finds that Future Bank failed to monitor and
disclose suspicious transactions on several cash transactions. In particular, Future Bank’s
processed large Euro-denominated cash transactions for the Iranian embassy without
obtaining the customer due diligence documentation in violation of the disclosure
provisions of AML Decree Law 54 of 2006, Ministerial Order No. 6 of 2008, and FC

The Tribunal notes that the Claimants have not specifically addressed the allegations of
the lack of due diligence in respect of the deposits of these entities. Thus, the Tribunal is
satisfied that the record bears out Future Bank’s failure to adhere to the applicable due

diligence regulations.

. The record does not, however, contain sufficient evidence to demonstrate other

monitoring and reporting failures by Future Bank. The Tribunal is not persuaded that the
specific instances of failure of oversight by the bank raise to the level required to
demonstrate a systematic and severe breach of the applicable laws. In addition, while a
part of the bank’s failure related to sanctioned entities for which the bank opened
accounts without applying the required due diligence or filing STRs, this does not suffice
to show that Future Bank’s failure to monitor and report transactions was primarily

related to evasion of the sanctions.

Therefore, the evidence of Future Bank’s transaction monitoring and reporting failures

does not suffice to substantiate the Respondent’s preliminary objections.

iii. Wire Stripping
Wire stripping is the deliberate act of changing or removing material information from
wire payments or instructions, making it difficult or impossible to identify payor or payee
and thus payments to and from sanctioned individuals or entities. This practice includes

the use of SWIFT.

It is common ground that Future Bank engaged in wire stripping, but the Parties disagree

until when it did so and whether wire stripping was illegal at the relevant time.

According to the CBB, the wire stripping practice “ran from at least January 2004
(possibly before) until at least October 2009.”*"? At other places in the 2018 CBB Report,
the wire stripping is alleged to have lasted “from 2004 to 2012, and maybe longer.”*!*
The wire stripping inventory by Deloitte included 9,352 messages covering the period
from August 2004 to December 2010.*!* The inventory shows two transactions in 2010,
one on 31 January 2010 for GBP 57,253 and one on October 18, 2010 for GBP 18,739,
which was the last one.*!> In addition, it shows 11 wire stripped transactions after April
2009. The 2018 CBB Report notes that “much of the evidence discovered so far regards

transactions that took place before March 2008.”*!¢

For the Claimants, this last statement in the 2018 CBB Report is largely in line with their
own position that there is no evidence of wire stripping after April 2009. The Claimants
argue that, as soon as the CBB raised concerns regarding Future Bank’s handling of

certain SWIFT messages in April 2009,*!” Future Bank implemented measures to address

2018 CBB Report (R-172), { 27, referring to the total value of wire stripping transactions (CBB.R-307)
and the underlying messages related to these transactions (CBB.R-308). Neither seems to support the
conclusion that wire stripping took place until October 2009. The documents containing the messages are
over 1,000 pages long and not pdf-searchable.

such concerns, which is confirmed by the AML compliance reports for 2010 and 2011.4!8
In any event, according to the Claimant, no wire stripping could have taken place after
March 17, 2012 because Future Bank was then cut off from the SWIFT banking

transactions system.

In other words, it emerges from the evidence that the Claimants gradually phased out the
wire stripping practice after the CBB’s notice of April 2009, with only 11 instances of

wire stripping between April and December 2009 and two in 2010. 4!

In addition, the Respondent has identified no rule of Bahraini law prohibiting wire
stripping in the relevant period. While Bahrain’s AML Law of 2001 required the banks

420

to “keep a transaction record” in general terms,*~” the implementing modules did not

particularize the required information until 2014.

As a consequence, the Respondent has not established that Future Bank’s wire stripping
practices violated applicable rules and regulations. Nor has the Respondent shown that

the wire stripping practices were linked to the alleged sanction violations.

iv. Alternative Messaging System

On March 17, 2012, Future Bank was disconnected from the SWIFT network“?! and used
an alternative messaging system (AMS) or test key system to process inter-bank
payments.*” It is common ground that using AMS is not in itself illegal as long as the
bank keeps records that allow the retrieval and verification of transaction information.*?*
At the same time, it is also undisputed that AMS is by its nature not subject to the same

transaction monitoring, filtering, and screening as the SWIFT system.

It is also common ground that Iranian banks used AMS because of the threat posed by
the international sanctions.‘ It is also established that Future Bank used AMS since
2008.*?5 In addition, at the hearing, the Claimants’ witness Mr. Souri conceded that
Future Bank had not filed STRs for transactions conducted through AMS,*?6 which

appears unusual and indicative of an improper due diligence.

The Parties dispute whether Future Bank misrepresented to the CBB that it had only
started using AMS after it was cut off from the SWIFT network in 2012 (a).*?’ They also
disagree on whether the use of AMS allowed Future Bank to avoid keeping mandatory
records of transactions, monitoring them for suspicious activity, and reporting to the CBB
(b).*?8 It is also disputed whether the use of AMS was related to the alleged violations of

the applicable sanctions (c). These facts must be considered in turn.

a. Did Future Bank Fail to Disclose to the CBB its Use of

AMS Prior to 2012?
The CBB contends that Future Bank had started using AMS even before it was
disconnected from the SWIFT network in March 2012.*° The Claimants do not
expressly state that Future Bank used AMS prior to March 2012. However, they
impliedly do so, admitting that Iranian banks used AMS “for decades” because of the
“looming threat” of sanctions,**° and that the CBB was, or must have been, aware of

Future Bank’s use of AMS.“!

The record shows that, on November 29, 2012, Future Bank represented to the CBB that
“until 17" March 2012, the payments were effected through SWIFT. Later on, when we

were disconnected from the Swift network, Future Bank has made payment arrangements

through test key mechanism separately entered into with correspondent banks.”**? This
representation omits to mention that Future Bank had already used AMS prior to its
disconnection from SWIFT. At the hearing, the Claimants’ witness Mr. Souri, who
served as Future Bank’s CEO at the time, admitted that Future Bank did not disclose its

use of AMS to the CBB prior to the cut off from SWIFT.“

The Deloitte inventory of AMS messages of Future Bank, shows that the bank sent and
received a total of 9,193 messages using AMS, out of which 1211 were sent between
February 5, 2008 and March 17, 2012, while Future Bank still had full access to the
SWIFT network. +4 The underlying documentation, including the AMS message Future
Bank’s messages prior to being disconnected from SWIFT, is on the record.*** The

Claimants did not rebut this evidence.

On this basis, the Tribunal is convinced that, in its letter of November 29, 2012, Future

Bank misrepresented its use of AMS prior to 2012 to the CBB.

The Respondent argues that the failure by Future Bank to disclose this information to the
CBB was a violation of Article 163 of the CBB Law, which provides that “any officer or
employee of a Licensee or a listed company shall be punished [...] if he (1) concealed
any records, information or documents relevant to the activities of the Licensee”

requested by the CBB or an external auditor.*°°

Article 163 of the CBB Law addresses the individual criminal liability of a bank’s officer
or employee. The provision does not purport to regulate the conduct of banks. That said,
the failure of the officers of Future Bank to disclose the bank’s use of AMS appears to
have been contrary to the requirements of the CBB Law. Although not dispositive, this
is a fact that the Tribunal must take into account when assessing the propriety of the

Claimants’ conduct.

b. Was the Failure by Future Bank to Keep Proper

Transaction Records while Using the AMS System Illegal?

According to the CBB, Future Bank was required “to maintain a reliable and complete

record of pay orders” and “to maintain adequate books and records capable of clearly

demonstrating that the pay orders (and Future Bank’s operating of business) complied
with the legal requirements for transparency in cross-border payments.”477

The CBB Rulebook requires that banks keep “adequate records [...] enabling a

reconstitution of the transaction concerned”:

Conventional bank licensees must comply with the record keeping
requirements contained in the AML Law. Conventional bank licensees must
therefore retain adequate records (including accounting and identification
records), for the following minimum periods:

(a) For customers, in relation to evidence of identity and business relationship
records (such as application forms, account files and business correspondence
[...]), for at least five years after the customer relationship has ceased; and

(b) For transactions, in relation to documents [...] enabling a reconstitution
of the transaction concerned, for at least five years after the transaction was
completed.**

The CBB points out that “while Future Bank maintained fax confirmations, there is no
electronic ledger for recording [AMS] transactions” nor a “manual entry ledger’.
Moreover, the AMS “was never part of the Treasury Department’s Manual or the
Operations Department’s SOPs.”**? For the CBB, this state of affairs conflicted with
Future Bank’s obligation to “keep [...] a record of any money transfers through the
[AMS].” “° The CBB also infers from the “absence of proper records” that the AMS
“was deliberately designed to be less transparent and less well documented than the
SWIFT system, ultimately to conceal from scrutiny the true nature of the transactions to

which the pay orders relate.”*#!

The Respondent argues that the failure to record a transaction is a criminal offence under
the AML Law pursuant to Article 5 of Ministerial Order 7/2001.*#? Future Bank failed
to make records of at least 955 messages sent by way of AMS. Unlike SWIFT messages,
AMS transactions can only be reviewed and monitored if they are manually recorded.
Because of Future Bank’s failure to record these 955 messages, the CBB had no effective
way of verifying these transactions. The Respondent also argues that there is no evidence
that Future Bank applied any transaction monitoring or reporting systems to AMS, which
implicates a violation of Rules FC 2.2.1 and 2.2.3 of the Financial Crime Module of the
CBB Rulebook. Further, according to the Respondent, the failure to report a single AMS

transaction as suspicious was in breach of Rule FC 3.1.4(b) of the same module.

The Claimants do not comment on these allegations in any detail. They contend that
“even assuming for the sake of argument that Future Bank’s use of the Test Key
mechanism would have been prohibited under Bahraini laws and regulations at the time
[...] this had not been complained of nor notified by the CBB to Future Bank prior to the
Respondent’s Statement of Defense”.**+

The record sufficiently shows that the absence of records in respect of 955 messages for
which AMS was used violated the requirements of Article 5 of the AML Law and
Ministerial Order 7/2001, which requires the banks to “maintain a register containing all

details of transactions”, and in particular:

a) to enable the Anti Money Laundering Unit to follow up every transaction
and the institution’s compliance with the duties provided for in this Order,

c) the possibility of restructuring the transaction;

d) the possibility of answering, within a reasonable period of time, any
inquiries requested by the Anti Money Laundering Unit with the
implementation of any orders issued with respect to disclosure of transactions
including the identity of the owner of funds or beneficiary thereof and the
monetary transactions conducted by the institutions requiring proof of
identity;

Similarly, Future Bank has also breached the provisions of the CBB Rulebook, which
require that banks keep “adequate records [...] enabling a reconstitution of the transaction

concerned.”44°

However, a violation of Bahrain’s regulations does not necessarily entail that Future
Bank breached applicable sanctions. The Tribunal must therefore review whether Future

Bank’s use of AMS and the lack of adequate record keeping were related to the sanctions.

Violations?

Deloitte’s AMS inventory make the following findings:
(a) Future Bank sent and received 9,193 messages using AMS, relating to at least
USD 2.1 billion in outbound fund transfers;

(b) 89% of these messages were sent to or from, or related to, entities while they were
the subject of sanctions, including 182 messages from 2011 relating to IRISL
(subject to UN sanctions since 9 June 2010), and 61 messages from 2012 relating to
POGC (subject to US sanctions since 21 December 2010);

(c) 1,211 AMS messages were sent between 5 February 2008 and 17 March 2012, while
Future Bank still had full access to SWIFT;

(d) 7,982 messages were sent using AMS after 17 March 2012; and

(e) | Future Bank failed to make any record of 955 of these messages.
Regarding the 89% of AMS messages sent to or received from sanctioned entities
referred to in (b) above, the Deloitte inventory shows that the large majority of these
messages were exchanged with various Iranian banks subsequent to those banks’
designation as sanctioned entities by OFAC and, in part, by the EU.*#” Similarly, Future
Bank used AMS messages in relation to dealings with POGC after it had been sanctioned
by OFAC. That said, as the Tribunal concluded above, the U.S. and EU sanctions were
not opposable to Future Bank. Thus, the use of AMS in respect of entities coming under

those sanctions do not support the Respondent’s preliminary objections.

In contrast, Future Bank exchanged 182 messages with IRISL subsequent to the latter’s

designation as sanctioned entity by the UN on June 9, 2010.*#* This further substantiates

the conclusion that the Tribunal reached above according to which Future Bank’s

dealings with IRISL breached UN sanctions.

482. The Deloitte inventory further demonstrates that Future Bank’s use of AMS sharply
increased after Bahrain implemented the UN sanctions in September 2010 and remained
high in 2011 and early 2012 although at that time Future Bank still had access to SWIFT,
which only ended on March 17, 2012:44°

Volume of messages

483. As this figure depicts, there is an evident correlation between the endorsement of the UN
sanctions by Bahrain and the use of AMS. As AMS keeps a lower level of transaction
information as opposed to SWIFT, it is not far-fetched to infer that the former was
preferred over the latter to conceal transactions contrary to the sanctions. The same
reason also explains why the bank chose not to disclose to the CBB that it had been using

AMS before being cut off from SWIFT in 2012.

484. On this basis, the Tribunal concludes that it is possible that Future Bank’s violations of
the UN sanctions may have been more numerous than what emerged from the individual

violations established in sub-section i) above.

v. Iranian Exposure

The Parties diverge on whether Future Bank exceeded the limits allegedly imposed by
the CBB on Iranian exposure. The Respondent argues that the failure by Future Bank to
reduce its country and shareholder exposure contradicted the CBB’s repeated direct
instructions. The Claimants’ position is that the requirements imposed on Future Bank in
terms of the limitation of the Iranian exposure were unclear, but that, in any event, Future
Bank made good faith efforts to reduce its Iranian exposure to the extent possible and in

part succeeded.*°°

The debate about the alleged excess exposure pertains to two different aspects, first to
country exposure, i.e., exposure to Iranian interests in general ((a) below) and, second,

to exposure to the bank’s Iranian shareholders, i.e., to the Claimants ((b) below).

d. Country Exposure

An initial question with respect to Future Bank’s alleged violation of the country
exposure limit is whether the CBB had indeed imposed such a limit on the bank. Future
Bank’s letter to the CBB summarizing the meeting of August 9, 2007 between the CBB
and Future Bank shows that the CBB had “recommended” that Future Bank not “assume
new risks on Iran.”**! In the same letter, Future Bank represented that it would “attempt
to source its assets and liabilities to the extent possible from Bahrain and other GCC
countries”; “reduce the share of activities involving Iranian trade”; and “avoid enlarging
our current exposure to Iran”, which amounted to USD 1,019 million at that time

(equivalent to BHD 384 million).

The letter is not clear on whether the CBB had issued a mandatory instruction capping
the bank’s Iranian exposure. However, in the 2008 CBB Report, the CBB referred to the
USD 1,019 million limit as a “precautionary cap placed by the CBB” on Future Bank’s
Tranian exposure and required the Bank to establish robust controls to ensure compliance
with the cap.**? In response, Future Bank represented to the CBB that it would comply

with such instructions and would “reduce its Iran exposure gradually in a phased manner”

and “recalibrate its business model towards non-Iranian entities”.**? It emerges from this
correspondence that, in August 2007, the CBB had instructed Future Bank to reduce its
Iranian exposure and imposed a cap on such exposure at USD 1,019 million or BHD 384

million.

Following the imposition of the cap, Future Bank exceeded the cap on five days in 2008,

as shown in the following chart:*+*+

To avoid such incidents in the future, the CBB required Future Bank “to establish a robust
monitoring controls over the exposures to Iran”.*° In spite of this requirement, Future
Bank exceeded the cap on country exposure in 2009 on 13 occasions listed in the chart

below:4°6

The CBB reiterated its direction to the Board of Future Bank to put in place controls “to

avoid the recurrence of similar breaches in future.”457

The CBB Inspection Reports for 2010 and 2011 do not report any violation of the country
exposure limits. However, in a letter of December 29, 2011, the CBB requested Future
Bank to further “continue reducing exposures to Iran.’ It reiterated this instruction in

a letter of September 9, 2012."459

The record shows that, in 2011-2012, Future Bank complied with these instructions,
reducing its Iranian exposure to BHD 347.741 million in November 2012.4 However,
that figure then rose again the following month to BHD 370 million.**! While this level
was below the cap of BHD 384 million, it contradicted the CBB’s instructions of

December 29, 2011 and September 9, 2012 to continue reducing the exposure.

494. On January 31, 2013, the CBB again instructed Future Bank to reduce its exposure to
Iranian entities/customers and not to undertake any new exposure. *° At that time, Future
Bank’s Iranian exposure amounted to BHD 375 million.** Thus, by this letter the CBB
effectively imposed a new cap at BHD 375 million while at the same time repeating its
instruction to reduce the exposure. As can be seen from the table below, Future Bank
largely complied with these instructions, with the exception of the level shown at the end
of March 31, 2013 (BHD 371,851), which remained below the cap of BHD 375 million,
but was higher than the one at the end of February 2013 (BHD 367,797), in violation of

the instruction to continue reducing the country exposure.

Overall, it is true that the record shows that, in the years 2007-2015, Future Bank failed
to comply with the CBB’s instructions with respect to country exposure on several
occasions. However, the violations were sporadic and the bank managed to gradually
reduce the exposure over time. The Tribunal in particular notes that, in the years leading
to Future Bank’s administration, the bank’s country exposure decreased steadily. As was
seen above, between April 2013 and March 2015, the country exposure progressively

decreased and was never above the cap imposed by the CBB.

Furthermore, the record contains no instruction about the pace of the required reduction.
Therefore, the Tribunal is unconvinced by the Respondent’s argument that an annual

average reduction of 1.53% from 2007 to 2015 was in breach of any applicable rule.**

e. Shareholder Exposure

In respect of Future Bank’s exposure to its shareholders, on July 21, 2009, the CBB
directed Future Bank to reduce its exposure to Bank Melli Iran and Bank Saderat Iran to
40% of its capital base by September 2009.“® The previously approved limit was set at
60% of the capital base.*°

In the following year, during a meeting with Future Bank on September 20, 2010, the
CBB orally advised Future Bank to (i) stop transacting with Bank Melli and Bank

Saderat, (ii) stop transacting with all OFAC listed entities/individuals, (iii) put a hold on

all other non-OFAC related transactions in respect of Iranian entities/individuals.
Referring to the CBB’s statements at the meeting, the minutes first use the word “advise”
and later mention “oral instructions, which we need to follow”. The record contains

no indication of a follow up in the form of written instructions or otherwise.

On April 1, 2014, the CBB directed Future Bank to “immediately reduce its exposure
limits to its shareholders, BSI and BMI and bring such limits down to the outstanding
balances as of end of December 2013, while not undertaking any new exposure to these
shareholders.” It added that the bank “should initiate measures to bring down such
exposures to nil”. As the Claimants observe, the CBB gave Future Bank no time limit

for such reduction.

The following table depicts the chronology of the CBB’s instructions and the evolution

of Future Bank’s shareholder exposure:

501. The record thus reveals that Future Bank complied with the CBB instruction of July 21,

2009 to reduce its shareholder exposure to 40% of its capital base. The Respondent does

not suggest otherwise. Yet Future Bank failed to comply with the CBB’s later

instructions, given on April 1, 2014, to maintain its shareholder exposure at the level

existing at the end of December 2013 and to start to reduce it to zero. It exceeded the

December 2013 limit at the end of the second and third quarters of 2014 and complied

with it at the end of the fourth quarter.

vi. Preliminary Conclusions

It emergences from the foregoing review that only an insignificant number of sanction
violations are established. This being so, it is true that the evidence of specific instances
of violations must be viewed in the context of the circumstantial evidence discussed
above and on the backdrop of Future Bank’s deficient AML and CFT reporting system,
its practice of wire stripping and use of AMS. The increase in the use of AMS following
Bahrain’s implementation of the UN sanctions and Future Bank’s misrepresentations and
failure to keep records on many AMS transactions suggest a potential larger scale of

violations than the available evidence actually proves.

Yet, even considering these factors, the record contains insufficient indications to
establish systematic and/or severe violations of fundamental rules of law that would call
for a declaration of inadmissibility as a blanket measure. While the Tribunal must take
into account Future Bank’s violations of the applicable laws and regulations when
assessing the merits and the quantum, these breaches do not rise to the level that has led

international tribunals to reject claims as inadmissible.

(d) Do Future Bank’s Illegal Activities Taint the Claims in This
Arbitration?

As discussed above, an additional requirement of inadmissibility is that the unlawful
conduct be related to the claims that the investor submits to arbitration.* The
Respondent acknowledges this requirement, when it argues that “[s]erious or repeated
wrongdoing connected to the subject-matter of an investor’s claim disqualifies that claim
from being heard”.*”° Indeed, the rationale underlying the rules on admissibility would
not justify denying the investor access to international arbitration as a blanket measure if

the illegalities in question do not taint the claims.*7!

This does not of course prevent the host State from responding to such trivial violations by appropriate
measures, provided that it does so in accordance with its obligations under the applicable treaty (e.g., FET
and prohibition of uncompensated expropriation).

508.

PCA Case No. 2017-25
Award
Page 140 of 235

The claims in this arbitration relate to the measures taken by the Bahraini regulatory
authorities against Future Bank. They do not arise out of a transaction tainted by Future
Bank’s unlawful conduct. This distinguishes the present dispute from the cases outlined
above, where the investor’s claims arose out of transactions tainted by illegal activities,
such as corruption,’ fraud*” or forgery.‘ In such instances, the declaration of
inadmissibility seeks to avoid that, by entertaining such claims, the international tribunal
allows the claimant to benefit from its own wrong. In the present case, however, the
Claimants would not benefit from their own wrongful conduct if the Tribunal were to
entertain their claims, which claims put into questions the lawfulness of the Respondent’s

regulatory conduct.

This does not mean that the Tribunal must ignore the evidence of Future Bank’s unlawful
activities. Rather, it must assess the consequences of these illegalities as an issue of the
merits. In particular, the Tribunal must determine whether Bahrain’s regulatory measures
were a bona fide and proportionate response to Future Bank’s unlawful conduct, and/or
whether the evidence of Future Bank’s unlawful activities affects the quantification of

any compensation due to the Claimants.

For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal concludes that Future Bank’s unlawful conduct
is not sufficient to constitute a bar to its jurisdiction or to the admissibility of the claims.
The Tribunal will assess consequences of such conduct as part of its analysis on the

merits.

B. EXHAUSTION OF LOCAL REMEDIES

As a further preliminary objection, the Respondent submits that the Claimants failed to
exhaust local remedies. The Respondent raises this objection as part of its submissions
on the merits and has not formulated it as an issue of jurisdiction or
admissibility. However, given the threshold nature of the objection, the Tribunal will

dispose of it as part of its analysis of the preliminary objections.

1. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent argues that the Claimants cannot successfully advance due process
violations in the issue of the CBB’s decision to place Future Bank under administration
when they failed to seek redress through available remedies before Bahraini courts.
According to the Respondent, when an investor fails to make reasonable efforts to obtain
correction of alleged violations of due process in the issue of administrative decisions

before local courts, it cannot prevail in establishing an international delict. +”°

In support of this objection, the Respondent relies on Thunderbird v. Mexico, Helnan v.
Egypt, Apotex v. United States of America, as well as on Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine.
In the Respondent’s submission, these awards confirm that a violation of due process
treaty standards can only occur once some redress has been sought and denied in

domestic courts.47°

The Respondent further asserts that the standards of due process applicable in
administrative proceedings are lower than in judicial proceedings.*”” According to the
Respondent, had the Claimants appealed the CBB’s decision, they would have been
afforded many of the due process protections they now claim to have been denied.*”*
Finally, the Respondent notes that the Claimants’ futility argument is not supported by

any reliable evidence.*””

2. The Claimants’ Position

According to the Claimants, "there is no general requirement to exhaust local remedies

for a treaty claim to exist, unless a treaty requires the exhaustion of local remedies as a

condition for the commencement of an [...] arbitration”.**° They further point to the

absence of any requirement of exhaustion of local remedies in the BIT.**!

For the Claimants, the “BIT just provides for state responsibility for the acts and
omissions of its organs, and it does not distinguish between judiciary, executive, and the
legislative”. In this context, accepting the Respondent’s argument would, so the
Claimants say, defeat the substantive protection and the arbitration clause.*** For the
Claimants, the awards upon which the Respondent relies are fact-specific and do not

apply in the present circumstances.**?

At the Hearing, the Claimants drew the Tribunal’s attention to the fork-in-the road
provision contained in Article 11(3) of the BIT, arguing that this provision would be

inoperable if the investors were required to exhaust local remedies.***

The Claimants further argue that an appeal of the CBB’s decision would, in any event,
have been futile since Future Bank had already been informed that the taking was a

“sovereign decision” and Bahrain’s judiciary is highly dependent on the executive.**°

3. Analysis

Article 44 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility provides that:

The responsibility of a State may not be invoked if:
LJ
(b) the claim is one to which the rule of exhaustion of local remedies applies
and any available and effective local remedy has not been exhausted.

Contracting Parties have agreed otherwise.**° As noted by the Ros/nvest tribunal, “the

consent to investor-state arbitration [...] amounts to a waiver of the principle of

exhaustion of local remedies. By choosing international arbitration to settle third party

investment arbitration disputes the principle of exhaustion of national legal remedies is
excluded”.*8”

In the present case, neither the dispute settlement clause in Article 11 nor any other

provision of the BIT require the exhaustion of local remedies. The exhaustion of local

remedies is not therefore a condition to arbitrate a dispute under the BIT.***

That said, the Respondent maintains that its defence is not based on the need for
exhaustion of local remedies but rather on the requirement to make reasonable efforts to
obtain the correction of alleged due process violations in local courts. The issue is thus
whether, and to what extent, an investor may be required to pursue local remedies in

order to sustain a valid claim for breach of treaty.

The Tribunal finds that the Respondent’s attempt to nuance its position does not assist its
position. Indeed, for a number of reasons, it considers that there is no substantive or
procedural requirement to pursue local remedies before initiating a treaty claim unless

such a claim is for denial of justice.

First, contrary to the Respondent’s submission, the Tribunal is of the view that the
rationale behind the requirement of exhaustion of local remedies for a denial of justice
claim cannot be transposed to the present situation. As emphasized in Oostergetel, “[a]

denial of justice implies the failure of a national system as a whole to satisfy minimum

As explained in the ILC’s Commentary, Article 44 is “not concerned with questions of the jurisdiction of
international courts and tribunals, or in general with the condition for the admissibility of cases brought
before such courts or tribunals. Rather, [it] define[s] the conditions for establishing the international
responsibility of a State and for the invocation of that responsibility by another State or States”: See Articles

standards”.**° Thus, as long as the system as a whole is not given a reasonable

opportunity to correct aberrant judicial conduct, a denial of justice cannot arise.*””

Invoking due process violations in the administrative decision-making, in order to
establish a breach of BIT standards does not rest upon the predicate of a “systemic failure
of the State’s justice system” or on the failure of the national system “as a whole”. It
rather seeks to rely on the breach of a specific international obligation undertaken by the

State, be the protection against expropriation or fair and equitable treatment.

Second, as the Helnan v. Egypt ad hoc Committee held, a State is undoubtedly
responsible at an international level for a decision taken by its administrative authorities,

when that decision conflicts with one of its international obligations.*”!

Third, the lawfulness of the CBB’s decision to place Future Bank under administration
as it may be determined by a Bahraini court under Bahraini law is not dispositive of the
characterization of such decision under international law, which is determinative for
purposes of the BIT. Hence, the Tribunal is not persuaded that it has to await the outcome

of the local proceedings.

Fourth, arbitral practice shows that “(i)n numerous ICSID cases, tribunals have rendered
awards in favour of the claimants as a result of administrative decisions, in which no such
application to the local courts had been made”.*”” In that sense, the Quiborax v. Bolivia
tribunal found that “the availability of domestic actions to challenge the Revocation

Decree does not change the Tribunal’s conclusion that the revocation did not comply

with due process [...]”.4°? The same is true in non-ICSID investment arbitrations**4 and

the Tribunal sees no reason to depart from this approach.

Consequently, the Tribunal finds no basis in the BIT or in international law to impose a
general requirement to pursue local remedies for an investor to bring a treaty claim (with

the exception of a denial of justice claims, which is not at issue here).

This conclusion is reinforced by the presence of a fork-in-the-road clause in Article 11(3)

of the BIT, which reads as follows:

A dispute primarily referred to the competent courts of the host Contracting

Party, as long as it is pending, cannot be referred to arbitration save with the

parties’ agreement; and in the event that a final judgment is rendered, it cannot

be referred to arbitration.
Thus, by virtue of Article 11(3), the Contracting Parties have chosen to bar recourse to
arbitration when the investor has “primarily referred” the dispute to the courts of the host
State and local proceedings are pending or a final judgment has been rendered. Thus, had
the Claimants sought redress of the violations impugned here before Bahraini courts, the

Tribunal would have been barred from ruling on such claims.

It follows that accepting the Respondent’s position and requiring an investor to seek
redress before local courts would amount to precluding that investor from accessing an
international forum available under the BIT. This would render Article 11(2) of the BIT,
which allows investors to submit investment disputes to international arbitration,
inoperative and devoid of any utility. Therefore, considering the context of Article 11(3)
of the BIT, the imposition of a prior requirement to act in local courts would be contrary
to the well-established rule of effective interpretation of treaties, according to which
treaty provisions must be interpreted in a manner that gives them a purposeful meaning

rather than making them meaningless or redundant.*°>

The same view was expressed by the tribunal in the Mytilineos v. The State Union of

Serbia & Montenegro and the Republic of Serbia case in a similar context:

To assume that the BIT had not tacitly dispensed with the requirement to
exhaust local remedies would imply that an investor, before making his or her
choice between domestic courts and international arbitration, would have to
exhaust domestic remedies. This would in effect render the ‘domestic courts’
alternative of the fork-in-the-road clause meaningless and thus such an
assumption cannot be made. On the contrary, a fork-in-the-road clause
obliges an investor to choose whether to pursue remedies before domestic or
international fora. Once the choice is made in favor of domestic remedies,
international arbitration is no longer available. Thus, one cannot require the
exhaustion of local remedies as a precondition for access to international

arbitration. Instead, the initiation of local proceedings forfeits access to
international arbitration.“°°

For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimants were not required
to first proceed before Bahraini courts, with the result that this objection must also be

dismissed.
LIABILITY

Since the Respondent did not prevail with its preliminary objections, the Tribunal now
proceeds to examine the merits of the dispute. The Claimants allege that the Respondent’s
actions amount to violations of the expropriation, fair and equitable treatment (“FET”),
and full protection and security (“FPS”) standards. The Respondent opposes the claims

in their entirety.

A. EXPROPRIATION
The Parties dispute whether the Respondent’s measures against Future Bank constituted
an expropriation contrary to the requirements of Article 6(1) of the BIT.
1. The Claimants’ Position
The Claimants argue that the Respondent expropriated their investment, either directly

or indirectly, in breach of Article 6 of the BIT.

According to the Claimants, direct expropriation is characterized by the deprivation of

the investor’s property and a corresponding appropriation by the state, or state-mandated

beneficiary, of specific property rights.**” In contrast, indirect expropriation is defined as
“a form of [...] expropriation with a distinctive temporal quality in the sense that it
encapsulates the situation whereby a series of acts attributable to the State over a period

of time culminate in the expropriatory taking of such property”.*°*

In the Claimants’ submission, the CBB’s pronouncement on April 30, 2015 that Future
Bank “cease trading immediately” and provide the CBB with “full access to [its]
premises” satisfies the definition of direct expropriation.*” In any event, the Claimants
argue that the Respondent’s actions amount at a minimum to an indirect expropriation as
they deprived the Claimants of the use or enjoyment of their investment. In addition to
Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine quoted above, the Claimants rely on PSEG v. Turkey,
according to which indirect expropriation entails “some form of deprivation of the
investor in the control of the investment, the management of day-to-day operations of the
company”.°"’ The Claimants submit that, contrary to the Respondent’s argument,
economic depreciation is not a necessary component of indirect expropriation. They point
to Deutsche Bank v. Sri Lanka, which found that “a substantial interference with rights
may well occur without actually causing any economic damage [...] the effect of conduct
must be considered in deciding whether an indirect expropriation has occurred, does not

necessarily import an economic test”.*°!

In any event, the Claimants dispute the assertion that no economic depreciation occurred

or that, as the Respondent suggests, Future Bank’s share value had increased under

administration, as the “CBB’s priority was to maximize Future Bank’s assets rather than

run a commercial venture”.*°? The Claimants distinguish the apparent increase in share

value from the fair market value of the shares, which in fact decreased.>

Finally, the Claimants challenge the Respondent’s position that the administration
decision could not amount to an expropriation because a banking licence is a privilege.
They also dispute that placing Future Bank in administration was a “mere legitimate
exercise of regulatory authority”, referring to a writing of Prof. Paulsson according to
whom “it is not normal to regulate in contradiction of justifiably perceived commitments.
Nor it is normal to regulate while ignoring due process. Nor obviously is it normal to use
regulatory enactments or conduct as a pretence of form serving as a cloak for the pursuit
of hidden objectives”.*°> The Claimants do not deny that the Tribunal must afford the
Respondent a measure of deference when it comes to the exercise of regulatory authority.
However, quoting Marfin v. Cyprus, they specify that “such deference must not impede

its [the Tribunal’s] task to verify whether international law was complied with”.°°°

In addition, the Claimants observe that an expropriation is only lawful if it meets the
conditions under international law. They emphasize that a single violation of one of these
conditions must result in a finding of liability.*°’ In the present case, the Respondent
breached every one of the conditions set in Article 6 for a lawful expropriation, i.e.,
(a) a public purpose, (b) non-discrimination, (c) due process, (d) proportionality, and (e)

prompt, adequate and effective compensation.

(a) Public Purpose

According to the Claimants, for an expropriation to be lawful, it must be effected for a
legitimate public purpose. The decision to place Future Bank under administration was
not made in pursuit of such a purpose; it was politically motivated and thus, in

contravention of Article 6 of the BIT.

The Claimants base this argumentation first, on the timing of the action, which was too
short for a reasoned decision-making process on the basis of a legitimate public purpose;
second, on the fact that the alleged public purpose was divorced from reality; and third,

on the context at the time of the action, which suggests a political motivation.

In the Claimants’ submission, the fact that the Respondent gave no justification at the
time of the administration decision demonstrates that it was not taken in pursuit of a
public purpose. The Claimants point to Vestey Group v. Venezuela in which the tribunal
held that a failure to “advance a declared public purpose at the time of the expropriation
inter alia demonstrated” that the measures complained of were not taken in the public
interest.°° The Claimants add that where tribunals found that a stated public purpose was

“pretextual”, they considered the respondent State in violation of the applicable treaty.*°°

In this context, the Claimants argue that because the Respondent provided a justification
only after the decision was taken and the Respondent had assumed control over Future
Bank, the “taking was not undertaken pursuant to a genuine public purpose”.*!° The
Claimant adds that the first justification for the CBB Decision came on May 7, 2015
when it was stated that should Future Bank “continue to offer services [it] will cause
harm to the industry of financial services in the Kingdom of Bahrain”.*!! In the
Claimants’ submission, this was a mere restatement of Article 136(a)(3) of the CBB Law
and substantiation was not offered at the time.*!? In the same vein, the Claimants contend
that the minutes of the Crisis Management Committee at the CBB on the day of the taking
do not assist the Respondent either as they do not make mention of any breaches by

Future Bank.>!

According to the Claimants, these purported justifications do not even satisfy the
requirements under the CBB Law, which provides that the decision to place a bank under

administration can only be made “pursuant to a justified resolution”.>!+

The Claimants add that the Respondent’s failure to produce evidence of the decision-
making process that culminated in the CBB Decision is demonstrative of a lack of a
coherent public purpose.*!> In this regard, the Claimants point to the Dayyani v. Korea
cases, where the tribunal reasoned that had the respondent State’s justifications for its
measure “been the significant issue that the Seller had made it out to be, it would have
been discussed and analyzed at length by the various supervisory authorities”.*!° In the
absence of documents, adverse inferences must be made. They further submit that the
Respondent’s failure to prove that the Respondent itself or the CBB addressed the
“detailed”>!’ appeals set out in Future Bank’s letters of May 7 and 26, are illustrative of

the lack of public purpose.>!®

For the Claimants, there could have been no legitimate concerns about Future Bank’s
activities, since it was under intense scrutiny since 2007. It is thus “implausible that if
Future Bank had breached applicable laws and regulations in any material manner [...]

the same would not have been immediately notified to Future Bank”.>!?

The reasons proffered after the event are equally unavailing, say the Claimants. The
reason given on May 18, 2015 that the administration decision was based on the
“violations of [Law no. 4 of 2001 on the Prohibition of Money Laundering] and the CBB
Law” and on local and international sanctions were not substantiated either and therefore

cannot be regarded as “factual or legal justification”>”° for the CBB Decision.*?!

The Claimants conclude that the Respondent’s decision to place Future Bank under
administration was “pretextual” and not “undertaken pursuant to any genuine public

purpose established at the time”.*7?

Contrary to the Respondent’s assertion, the Claimants deny that the State is to be
accorded unfettered deference in characterizing a public purpose or the parameters of its
regulatory powers.°”? Relying on Vestey Group v. Venezuela, they identify the relevant
test as whether the stated “public policy objectives” were “genuine [and] proven”, or
whether they were “divorced from reality”.*~ In support of this text, the Claimants
further cite UP and CD Holding v. Hungary, in which it was held that “[i]nternational
law does not recognize a blanket exception related to ‘general regulatory powers’”.°?°
Even Kardassoupoulos v. Georgia, which the Respondent invokes, in reality serves the

Claimants’ case, as it held that the State is only entitled to a measure of deference.>”°

an alleged lack of risk-based methodology for enhanced customer due diligence, (iii) an
alleged lack of proper record keeping and KYC records, and (iv) alleged violations of
domestic and international sanctions. According to the Claimants, the Respondent’s last
reports of non-compliance prior to the CBB Decision were issued in 2012, and all such

reports from 2008-2012 had been addressed and resolved promptly by Future Bank.*8

system before 2012,°”° and again in 2013, but that it ultimately came to the conclusion
that such a system was “not required for the time being due to low volume of business”.**°
Instead, Future Bank installed a “compliance monitoring tool” called Bench Matrix at
the end of January 2014.**! There being no further indication of the CBB’s dissatisfaction
with Future Bank’s monitoring systems or of any further requests that Future Bank install
an automated monitoring system, the Claimants submit that the CBB approved Future

Bank’s response.>°?

The alleged lack of risk-based methodology for enhanced customer due diligence is
similarly unavailing say the Claimants. Future Bank had in fact “promptly addressed”
the CBB’s recommendation in 2012>? to adopt a “risk based approach for categorizing

the customers and to send STRs where required”**+

and confirmed its intention to comply
with the CBB’s recommendations to install an automated AML system to further enhance
due diligence. It had done so by installing Bench Matrix in 2014. The Claimants stress
that the CBB never objected to this solution, “[a]ccordingly, Future Bank had strictly no
reason to believe that such a response had been deemed in any way unsatisfactory”.**°
The Claimants highlight several other systems which Future Bank implemented in order
to comply with the CBB directions, including awareness training for Bank staff.**° In
further support, the Claimants note the report of their external auditors, Ernst & Young,

who confirmed Future Bank’s compliance with the CBB rules.**’

CBB Report.*** They underline the CBB’s failure to voice any objections to these
responses, which could only be taken as an indication that the CBB was satisfied. Despite
the absence of objections, the Claimants had taken a “proactive approach and undertook

additional substantial efforts to improve KYC record keeping compliance”.>*?

It is the Claimants’ future submission that Future Bank had also addressed and resolved
the CBB’s concerns regarding its Iranian exposure, and that the CBB had even expressed
its satisfaction with Future Bank’s reduced exposure two months before the

administration.*"°

In the same vein, the Claimants dispute all findings of violations in the 2018 CBB Report
and argue that (i) Iranian exposure had been “put to rest following Future Bank’s letter
of December 1, 2014”, (ii) the test key mechanism had “at all material times been
disclosed to the CBB”, and (iii) Future Bank’s dealings with sanctioned entities were
disclosed and not objected to.*#!

The Claimants also take issue with the 2015 CBB Report, not least because its findings
“actually relate to information Future Bank had at all times transparently disclosed”*#?
and do not “reveal any violations by Future Bank [that were not] already known to the
CBB at the time”.*“? The 2015 CBB Report was not issued on May 24, 2015, but later to

“rubberstamp” the administration decision after the fact,””” which the testimonies of the

Respondent’s fact witnesses confirm.**

For the Claimants, the actual reason for the CBB Decision is to be found in the political
context prevailing at the time. In the light of the leaked diplomatic cables, it is clear that

Saudi Arabia exerted significant influence over Bahrain, which given the strained

relations between that country and Iran, led to the CBB Decision.*4° The Claimants also
point to Bahrain’s dependence on Saudi Arabia™’ to submit that it was not a coincidence
that Bahrain placed Future Bank under administration so soon after the JCPOA was
announced.*“8 In this context, the Claimants invite the Tribunal to draw adverse
inferences from the Respondent's failure to produce all “correspondence and minutes of
meeting, between Saudi authorities and Bahraini authorities, for the period 2010 to 2015,
in relation to Iranian interests in Bahrain and Future Bank in particular’, contrary to the

Tribunal’s order.*?

To support this interpretation of the events, the Claimants refer to the meeting held by
the Crisis Management Committee of the CBB in April 2015, in which the Committee
recommended that Future Bank and the Bahraini branch of the Iran Insurance Company
be placed under administration. The Claimants treat this recommendation as “generic and
political”, considering the “very distinct activities and business models” of the two

companies.*°

To reinforce their argument on the political nature of the CBB Decision, the Claimants
argue that the alleged public purpose of protecting the financial services industry was
untenable, considering the JCPOA and the imminent end of sanctions.°>! The Claimants
also observe that the letter informing Future Bank of the Decision had been signed by

meeting held between the CBB and Future Bank on May 3, 2015, the CBB “confirmed”

that the taking was “political and the result of a ‘sovereign decision’”.*>+

(b) Non-Discrimination

The Claimants submit that the alleged taking was discriminatory, as Bahrain was
targeting all Iranian investments. Under customary international law as reflected in the
leading commentary, “the presence of discrimination should be determined by evaluating
the individual factual circumstances of each particular case”, highlighting that “[t]takings
that invidiously single out property of persons of a particular nationality would be

unreasonable”.*°°

The Claimants submit that the meeting allegedly held by the Crisis Management
Committee within the CBB on April 30, 2015 shows the discriminatory nature of the
Respondent’s actions. To the Claimants, “it is undeniable that Bahrain’s abrupt taking of
distinct and unrelated Iranian investments, on the very same day, by way of the same

unsubstantiated letter [...] prima facie show discrimination based on nationality”.*°°

According to the Claimants, their burden of proof is limited to a prima facie case of
discrimination and they have discharged it.*°’ They refer to Feldman v. Mexico in which
the tribunal was satisfied with prima facie proof, as “requiring a foreign investor to prove
that discrimination is based on his nationality could be an insurmountable burden to the

Claimant, as that information may only be available to the government”.>°*

The Claimants further emphasize the different treatment accorded to other Bahraini

banks similarly placed under administration, namely, Awal Bank and the International

Banking Corporation. These two banks had only been placed under administration on

their own “declaration that they were unable to meet their financial obligations”*? and
after the CBB commissioned an “investigators’ report” confirming that the bank had “a

substantial short-fall of assets compared to [...] liabilities”.°®

The Claimants challenge the Respondent’s submission that the proper test for
discrimination is a comparison between the treatment accorded to the Jranian and the
Bahraini shareholders of Future Bank, which finds no support in prior case law or
customary international law. The Claimants add that, as the Tribunal found in ADC v.

Hungary, the relevant comparator is “investors as a whole”.*°!

The Claimants further assert that, in this case, the treatment of Bahraini shareholder AUB

is irrelevant as it had relinquished all its shareholding in 2007.°°

Similarly like the
Claimants, AUB was found to engage in analogous “wire stripping” practices as those
which are purportedly the basis of the administration of Future Bank, without facing

identical or comparable consequences.>*°

(c) Due Process

The Claimants argue that the taking contravened the obligation to afford them due
process, since the Respondent failed to provide Future Bank with (i) an opportunity to
cure violations prior to the CBB Decision, (b) notice of the CBB Decision, (c) reasons
for such decision, and (d) a meaningful opportunity to challenge the CBB Decision. In

addition, the CBB had not complied with domestic procedures.

have “allowed the Claimants to participate in the audit prior to the revocation of the

[disputed measure]”.°® The Claimants also cite Rumeli v. Kazakhstan, which found that
“the process that led to the decision of the Working Group lacked transparency and due
process, and was unfair, in contradiction with the requirements of the fair and equitable

treatment principle”.*

With respect to notice, the Claimants assert that “if a state fails to provide an investor
notice of an expropriation, the state’s conduct would breach due process”.**” They invoke
several decisions in support of this proposition.*® In addition to the notice requirement
under international law, the Claimants note that the CBB Rulebook imposes an
“obligation” on the CBB to provide advance notice of a decision for administration,

whenever “feasible”, which was not done here.>

For the Claimants, the 2012 CBB Report cannot be characterized as a notice of
impending administration, not only because such notice relates to breaches in 2012, but

also because Future Bank had remedied all of these alleged violations well before the

The Claimants reject the Respondent’s attempt at justifying its failure to give notice on
grounds that “States may decline to provide investors with prior notice [...] when doing

so could lead to greater non-compliance”:*7!

a. The Respondent would need to demonstrate that it placed Future Bank under
administration without notice, on the “basis of legitimate concerns that prior

notice would lead to ‘greater non-compliance’” which it failed to do;

b. | The Respondent has equally failed to prove that providing notice would not

have been “feasible” pursuant to the CBB Rulebook;>”” and

c. The Respondent has also failed to substantiate that the CBB harbored serious
concerns that “there was a real risk of document destruction and concealment

of information had [Future] Bank been given advance notice”.°”*

The Claimants distinguish the decisions which the Respondent invokes and in particular
Apotex v. United States of America. That case did not concern direct or indirect
“deprivation of ownership rights” and is thus not relevant, and the investor had received
several warnings, including one two months before the “contested measure was
imposed”. According to the Claimants, this “contrasts greatly with the circumstances of
the present case, where the most recent inspections date back to 2012, namely over two
years prior to the April 30, 2015 taking”.°” In any case, Apotex v. United States of
America sets an “extremely high threshold” for a State to justify a failure to provide prior

notice.>”>

The Claimants similarly distinguish Genin v. Estonia, arguing that, while no express prior
notice was provided, the investor had been subjected to several consistent warnings,

including an audit and a series of meetings immediately preceding the disputed

measure.>”° Furthermore, the tribunal stated that the lack of prior notice was “contrary to

generally accepted banking and regulatory practice”.°””

By contrast, in the present situation, no exceptional circumstances warranted the lack of
notice. The Claimants recall that the most recent concerns set out in the 2012 CBB Report
were promptly addressed by Future Bank, that the Iranian exposure matter was
definitively dealt with by the end of 2014 with the CBB reporting that “no action was

required” in this regard in March 2015, and Future Bank was not in financial difficulty.*”*

In addition to a failure to provide an opportunity to cure and advance notice, the
Respondent provided no reasons until its SoD. Consequently, the Claimants argue, they
were denied a meaningful opportunity to challenge the CBB Decision at the time and
after it was taken, which breaches due process. They invoke ADC v. Hungary>” and
Kardassoupoulos v. Georgia,**° where the tribunals held that the State must allow an
investor a “reasonable chance within a reasonable time” to make its claim and have it
heard, as dictated by due process. For the Claimants, the failure to provide reasons

constitutes an independent breach of the BIT and warrants a finding of liability.>*!

The Claimants reiterate that there was a paucity of information justifying the CBB
Decision at the time of the taking; the vague and unsubstantiated justifications denied the
Claimants “any meaningful opportunity to defend themselves against such

grounds pursuant to which an expropriatory measure can be adopted under municipal law

would be sufficient to meet the BIT’s justification requirement”.***

Moreover, the Claimants assert that Bahrain did not engage with them once the Decision
was taken, thus denying them a meaningful opportunity to challenge the CBB Decision
and defend themselves against any allegations upon which the Decision was purportedly
based. Additionally, the Claimants contend, an opportunity to challenge must include
adequate time to do so. In the light of the Respondent’s late submission of the 2018 CBB

Report, the Claimants were denied such an opportunity.>**

The Claimants reject the Respondent’s proposition that they should have resorted to the
local courts to submit their grievances and that, had they done so, they would have
benefitted from safeguards that satisfy due process under customary international law.**°
They did not resort to the local courts to challenge the CBB Decision as they were
actively discouraged from doing so, having been “informed that the [CBB Decision] was
a final sovereign decision”.**° Any attempt to appeal the CBB Decision would have been
587

futile, also because the Bahraini judiciary is “widely recognized” as lacking

independence.***

The Claimants distinguish the cases on which the Respondent relies in this respect. In
particular, they argue that, in contrast to Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine, where the
tribunal found that “in the absence of a reasonable — not necessarily exhaustive — effort

by the investor to obtain correction”, it was insufficient for that investor to “seize upon

589

an act of maladministration” to justify a finding of expropriation,”®” the taking here is not

a “mere act of maladministration” as the CBB Decision was taken at the “ministerial

level”.**° They had indeed expended reasonable effort to obtain correction, “only to see

the same summarily dismissed”**! in the CBB’s letter of May 18, 2015. By assuming
control over Future Bank and restricting the Claimants’ access to relevant
documentation, the Respondent further undermined the Claimants’ ability to properly

respond to the alleged breaches of Bahraini law and international sanctions.*”

Finally, the Claimants contend that its due process rights under Article 6 of the BIT were
breached as the Respondent failed to abide by its own domestic law. They repeat that
Bahrain gave no “justified resolution” in accordance with the CBB Law Article 136, and
failed to observe the statutorily mandated time limits in relation to administration, by
assuming control and appointing an administrator before a notice of administration was

published in the Official Gazette.°**

In addition, the Respondent did not adhere to the procedures under the CBB Rulebook
for placing a bank under administration, thereby breaching the obligation to accord the
Claimants due process. Under Rule 8.3.1, the CBB must first introduce a proposal for
administration, then “subject” that proposal to “a thorough review by the CBB of all
relevant facts, assessed against the criteria outlined in Section EN 8. 1”.5%4 In the absence
of evidence demonstrating such review, the Claimants argue that the Respondent has
breached the CBB Rulebook. Further, as stated above, the CBB Rulebook contains an
obligation to provide advance notice of an administration decision where “feasible” in
order “reduce the potential damage of an administration order being applied and then
withdrawn on appeal”.>°> The Respondent did not show that such notice was not feasible
in the circumstances and thus breached its obligations under the procedural safeguards

of Article 6.°°°

(d) Proportionality
The Claimants consider proportionality a necessary component of a lawful expropriation

under the BIT and international law*”’ and submit that the taking was disproportionate

to the stated justification.

For the Claimants, the taking of Future Bank was “not proportional to any purported
wrongdoing on the part of Claimants”.°** It was Future Bank’s purported violation of
sanctions that formed the primary basis of the CBB Decision. Given the political context
at the time of the CBB Decision, with the JCPOA in sight, the decision to place Future
Bank under administration “on the ground [...] that Future Bank was in breach of
sanctions can only be viewed — at best — as premature, and in any event as entirely

disproportionate”.

Further, so argue the Claimants, there were other “more moderate regulatory tools”?

available to address the purported public aim of protecting the Bahraini financial services
sector but the CBB did not attempt to use these tools, which shows the disproportionality

of the measure.

The Claimants say that even where foreign investors have been guilty of violations and
contributed to the injury they sustained at the hands of the State, the taking could amount
to an expropriation if it was disproportionate to the violations to which it responded.
Therefore, even if arguendo Future Bank had committed the violations on which the
Respondent relies in justifying the taking, by enacting measures that are disproportionate
to the public aim pursued, the Respondent committed an unlawful expropriation, as was

found in Tecmed v. United Mexican States.”

(e) Compensation

Finally, the Claimants submit that the expropriation was illegal because it was not
accompanied by a prompt, adequate and effective compensation, a requirement under

Article 6 of the BIT, and customary international law.

The Claimants refer to various investment tribunals that upheld claims for unlawful
expropriation where the State failed to provide compensation for an otherwise lawful

expropriation, such as the tribunal in Guaracachi v. Bolivia.”

The Claimants assert that they are entitled to rely on the most-favoured nation (MFN)
clause (Article 4 of the BIT) to access more specific, or additional, obligations in matters
of compensation.®° They refer to CME v. Czech Republic in this regard, where the
tribunal held that, while the applicable treaty referred only to “just compensation” in the
event of an expropriation, the investor was able to invoke the MFN clause to access the
more favourable treatment afforded to investors of a third state, including that
compensation should be “equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated
investment immediately before the expropriatory action was taken”.

Accordingly, the Claimants are due “the fair market value of the investment immediately
before the expropriation occurred”®* as specified under Article 6(2)(a) of the BIT
between Bahrain and the United Mexican States. They are owed such value within six
months of the taking, as provided, for instance, in Article 5(4) of the BIT between Italy

and Bahrain.

The Claimants observe that no payment has yet been paid. They also observe that the
Respondent’s argument that the fair market value of the investment would be paid at the
conclusion of the liquidation proceedings does not satisfy the treaty compensation

requirement.°”

Finally, the Respondent’s argument that the Claimants “cannot benefit from their own
obduracy” because they failed to participate in the liquidation proceedings or to challenge
the CBB Decision, is not in good faith, in the Claimants’ submission.°! The Claimants
recall the futility of any formal process of challenge or appeal before the Bahraini courts
and reaffirm that the liquidation proceedings stem from the Respondent’s breaches of

international law.°!!

2. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent submits that the Claimants have failed to establish that it expropriated
the investment. Even if the Claimants were able to establish expropriation, which the
Respondent contends they cannot, the latter maintains that its actions were taken in
pursuit of a bona fide public purpose, were proportional to the purpose, were non-

discriminatory and in accordance with due process.

First, the Respondent submits that where a State acts within its legitimate police powers,
no compensable taking takes place. The Respondent’s position is that the CBB Decision
is a valid exercise of regulatory authority that does not carry a compensation obligation.
Not only is Future Bank’s licence a privilege that may be revoked by the CBB, but under
customary international law, in the words of Marfin v. Cyprus, “a distinction exists
between the reasonable bona fide exercise of police powers, which does not amount to a
compensable taking, and indirect expropriation”.°'? To the Respondent, the burden falls

on the Claimants to prove that the CBB’s “exercise of [its] supervision authority” was

arbitrary.°!> The Respondent cites Marfin v. Cyprus, which considered that allegations
of a political taking were “insufficient to second-guess the acts of the Cypriot banking
regulator”.°'+ The same is true here, the Claimants’ case being based on unproven
“conspiracy theories” that depend on adverse inferences. The Respondent emphasizes

that a “party cannot possibly win its case on the basis of adverse inference alone”.°'>

According to the Respondent, the Claimants mischaracterize the CBB Decision as a
“permanent taking”, thereby conflating two distinct regulatory actions taken by the CBB;
the CBB Decision on the one hand, and the decision to liquidate Future Bank, based on

the CBB’s investigations following administration, on the other.°'®

The Respondent similarly rejects the argument that there has been a creeping or indirect
expropriation as Future Bank’s value has increased since administration and the
Claimants have retained ownership of their shares. It calls attention to Spyridon Roussalis
v. Romania, in which expropriatory claim was dismissed, as the companies “still
function[ed] and Claimant continu[ed] to profit from their operations” and “the value of
the investment’s asset base [...] ha[d] exponentially increased” since the disputed

measures.

In addition, the Respondent observes that the CBB merely exercised its authority to
police Future Bank, not “to take it over”.°!” The Claimants retain full ownership of their
shares in Future Bank and will receive their share of liquidation proceeds. These shares
have also increased in value, and as no economic depreciation has taken place, it follows

that no expropriation is established.

The Respondent submits that, contrary to the Claimants’ contentions, the administration
and subsequent liquidation were undertaken (a) for a public purpose, (b) in a non-

discriminatory way, (c) in accordance with due process, and (d) that they were

proportionate, thus making them a non-compensable exercise of regulatory authority.
Nonetheless, the Respondent confirms that effective and appropriate compensation is

envisaged in line with Article 6 of the BIT.°!®

(a) Public Purpose

The Respondent contests the Claimants’ assertion that it bears the burden of proving the
existence of a public purpose. In any case, as a bona fide regulatory act within the State’s
police powers taken to protect the Bahraini financial sector, the CBB Decision was taken
for a public purpose. It is a State’s sovereign right to regulate sectors that have a
significant impact on public interest, including the banking sector.°!? The burden of

620

proving otherwise falls on the Claimants,°~” and they have failed to “articulate a coherent

theory of pretext” or “ulterior motive”.©!

For the Respondent, a certain degree of deference must be accorded to the State to
undertake the requisite measures to promote social or general welfare purposes, the State
being free “to judge for itself what it considers useful or necessary for the public
good”.

Future Bank’s persistent failures to establish adequate AML/CFT systems, to comply
with Bahraini law and regulations, to deal transparently with the CBB posed significant
risks to the financial sector in Bahrain,®?* which was explicitly stated in the CBB’s notice

of administration.

On the Respondent’s case, the administration ended the Claimants’ control over Future
Bank and thus achieved the public purpose of putting an end to the Claimants’ use of

Future Bank as a vehicle to commit financial crimes and other wrongdoings.°* The CBB

Decision also served a public purpose as it allowed the CBB to access Future Bank’s
accounts and records and to uncover Future Bank’s illicit activities and “prevent future
noncompliance”.°” The Respondent claims it would not have been able to do so prior to
administration as the Claimants concealed its violations from the CBB, which could only
be “uncovered through the unfettered investigation that the administration would

allow”,©26

The Respondent blames the Claimants’ conflation of the decision to place Future Bank
in administration and the decision to liquidate it, as the cause of the Claimants’ flawed
argument that Bahrain could produce no contemporaneous evidence of a legal or factual
basis for the alleged taking. It was on the basis of the 2015 CBB Inspection Report that
the Respondent took the decision to place Future Bank under liquidation, a report that,
the Respondent claims, documents Future Bank’s persistent violations.©°? This was
distinct from the rationale for placing Future Bank under administration, which
placement was based on the CBB’s “grave doubts [...] about the bona fides of the Future
Bank’s [sic] activities after years of documented regulatory violations”.°*

Therefore, the Respondent says that the CBB Decision was the “culmination

of.

 

uspicions and concerns” that, unlike Quiborax v. Bolivia, related to violations that
were not “minor infractions”, but were actions that posed a significant threat to the
financial sector of Bahrain.©?? The Respondent emphasizes that no permanent action was
taken until the CBB “investigated and verified these suspicions”.©° Additionally, in
contrast to Dayyani v. Korea, these suspicions were communicated to the Claimants on

multiple occasions prior to the Decision.?!

603. The Respondent claims that these violations were as follows, all of which were “well-

documented”:

a. The lack of a functioning AML/CFT system,**? which the Respondent
describes as requiring three distinct procedures; first, customer due diligence
(KYC) in order to anticipate behaviour to create a baseline against which
deviations can be measured; second, transaction monitoring, in order to
identify and block suspicious transactions; and finally reporting suspicious
transactions to the relevant authorities. According to the Respondent, Future
Bank failed on all three counts, citing the incident with the “bladerunner”

ship as an example;

b. Wire stripping, which is also a violation of Bahraini domestic law, as it
“involves omitting or in some cases even falsifying information that all banks

are required to keep and share with one another”;°**

c. The use of AMS before the SWIFT cut-off; and

d. Violations of sanctions and a failure to reduce its exposure to Iran despite the

CBB’s directives to do so.

motivated.°*> Contemporaneous political and diplomatic developments were unrelated
and coincidental only in timing.®*® In the Respondent’s submission, the Claimants have

entities in Bahrain due to the timing of the administration of Iranian Insurance Company

is “unsubstantiated” and “equally unavailing” to establish a political motivation.**

In the Respondent’s submission, the characterization of the CBB Decision as a
“sovereign” decision is both unsupported and inconsequential. Indeed, every act of State
could be attributed to a “sovereign decision”, which characterization cannot be
dispositive of the nature and purpose of that decision.*” In any event, the CBB enjoys

“regulatory independence from the Bahraini government”.™?

The Respondent similarly denies any “targeting” of Iranian interests or companies by
Bahrain, the decision to place Future Bank and Iran Insurance Company in administration
being solely made on the basis of their documented and persistent violations of Bahraini

law and regulations.°*!

(b) Non-discrimination

The relevant test, says the Respondent, for a finding of discrimination, is that an “investor

must prove that it was subjected to different treatment in similar circumstances without

7642 and, crucially, whether the State acted in good faith.“? The

reasonable justification
appropriate comparison in this case is between the CBB’s treatment of the Bahraini
investors in Future Bank and its treatment of the Claimants. All the shareholders in Future
Bank, including the Claimants and AUB, the Bahraini investor, received “equal

o> 644

treatment”,°* meaning that all of them face the same consequences from the CBB

Decision and the subsequent liquidation.

The Respondent contends that, even if one accepts the standard for discrimination put
forward by the Claimants, the claim would still fail as the CBB acted on the reasonable

basis that Future Bank’s activities constituted a threat to the stability and reputation of

the Bahraini financial sector”.*> The Claimants offer no substantiation for the claim that
other banks conducting business with sanctioned entities did not meet the same
regulatory response as Future Bank. In this context, the Respondent stresses the low
number of STRs submitted by Future Bank and emphasizes that, unlike Future Bank,
those banks that dealt with Iranian sanctioned entities had much lower Iranian exposure
and yet still filed more STRs than Future Bank, thus demonstrating that the motivation
was not discriminatory but based Future Bank’s repeated violations of the CBB’s

instructions.™°

Further, the Respondent points to two Bahraini banks that violated the CBB Law and
faced regulatory action by the CBB,™’ being placed in administration for “fraudulent
operations”.©#* Thus, the Respondent submits, while it does not subscribe to the view that
Future Bank is an “Iranian bank” as it is incorporated in Bahrain, it is clear that the

Respondent takes regulatory action in response to violations, not based on nationality.“

(c) Due Process

The Respondent challenges the Claimants’ contention that this requirement was not met.

First, the Respondent submits that the Claimants were provided with ample opportunity
to rectify the breaches that the CBB had identified and which constituted the basis for the
CBB Decision. According to the Respondent, “the CBB repeatedly notified Future Bank
about its ‘major’ and ‘significant’ violations”, through examination reports such as the

2012 CBB Report.

Second, the Respondent argues that it is within a State’s right not to provide prior notice
of non-compliance, where such notice would lead to further non-compliance.®! This

applies here, with reference to Mr. Sharma’s report, the Respondent submits that there

was a “real risk of document destruction and concealment of information had the [Future]

Bank been given advance notice” of the administration.°?

The Respondent invokes Apotex v. United States to support that a failure to provide
advance notice of a measure adversely affecting an investment does not breach due
process if the notice may lead to greater noncompliance.*™ In Apotex v. United States of
America, it was considered that several communications concerning the suspected
wrongdoing over two years preceding the disputed measure were adequate prior

warning.°*

Third, the Respondent asserts that the Claimants had been “afforded several ‘meaningful
opportunities’ to challenge the administration as it unfolded”, and offer no valid reason
for their failure to raise “any legitimate process objections to the CBB’s reasoned

rejection before a Bahraini court”.©°° Further, and in contrast to all the authorities cited

657

by the Claimants,’ the placing in administration should not have come as a surprise

given the CBB’s repeated notices of non-compliance during almost nine years.* In
further contrast to those other authorities, Future Bank had years to remedy its non-

compliance.°?

The Respondent disputes the Claimants’ reasons for failing to challenge the CBB
Decision in court and denies any pressure on Future Bank to this effect.%° Future Bank
had the right to challenge the CBB Decision or the CBB’s rejection of its appeal in its

court®! pursuant to Article 139(c) of the CBB Law.*? That it did not make use of this

right cannot be attributed to the Respondent.

Fourth, the Respondent avers that the CBB did in fact provide reasons at the time of
administration, challenging the Claimants’ assertion that no reasons were provided in
contravention of due process. In accordance with Article 136 of the CBB Law, the CBB
stated that Future Bank’s continued operation “will cause harm to the industry of
financial services in the Kingdom of Bahrain’”.®? The CBB then gave further reasons on

May 18, 2015, noting Future Bank’s violations of the AML and the CBB Laws.

Finally, the Respondent dismisses as “trivial” and “incorrect”®® the Claimants’
contention that the procedure for appointing the administrator was contrary to Article
138 of the CBB Law and further violated the Claimants’ right to due process. On the
Respondent’s reading, the CBB Law contemplates the administration of a licensee before
the publication of a notice in the Official Gazette, Article 138(a) providing “the
Administrator shall, promptly after assuming the administration [...] publish a notice to

this effect in the Official Gazette”.

Moreover, even assuming that these procedural irregularities did in fact occur, they
would not amount to a violation of the treaty. In Genin v. Estonia, where a bank licence
was revoked without an opportunity to challenge the underlying findings, the tribunal
held, that although such practice may “invite criticism”, it did “not rise to the level of a

violation of any provision of the BIT”.

(d) Proportionality

The Respondent contends that the CBB’s actions were proportionate, i.e., that there was
a “reasonable relationship of proportionality between the charge or weight imposed to
the foreign investor and the aim sought to be realized”.

For the Respondent, the Claimants conflate the administration and the liquidation
decisions. In the Respondent’s submission, the Claimants fail to see that the
administration itself was a temporary measure, a “moderate step”, allowing the CBB to

investigate Future Bank and decide whether to start liquidation proceedings.%

The Respondent asserts that the CBB Decision and the subsequent liquidation were
necessary because, as Mr. Sharma reports, Future Bank’s violations were systemic and
“so pervaded its business model that there was no way to salvage it”.°” It relies on Mr.
Sharma’s opinion that out of the eight measures open to the CBB in the face of Future
Bank’s persistent non-compliance, the placement in administration was “the only viable
justified action that could have achieved [ending the non-compliance without destroying
Future Bank’s value] with an appropriate level of severity”.°’! As such, the Respondent
argues that the severity of the Future Bank’s violations and wrongdoings necessitated a

“proportionately serious measure”.°”

As to the claim that the CBB Decision was not proportionate because it was primarily
based on the sanctions violations, which sanctions were to be lifted following the JCPOA,

the Respondent contends that the CBB based its decision on a range of regulatory

3

breaches, including but not limited to sanctions,°” and that the possibility of an

international agreement overturning sanctions could not render violations retroactively

lawful and measures taken in response to these violations retroactively

disproportionate.°”*

(e) Compensation

The Respondent rejects the contention that it owes any compensation to the Claimants as
the CBB Decision to place Future Bank in administration was a valid regulatory act and
appropriate compensation will in any event be paid, at the conclusion of the liquidation

proceedings.

For the Respondent, there is a “clear line of case law [that] has recognized that regulatory
decisions by financial authorities are not compensable absent ‘clear and compelling
evidence’ of an abuse of that regulatory power”.°”> The Claimants are unable to satisfy
this “appropriately rigorous standard”, given that they proffer unsubstantiated
“conspiracy theories” to seek to establish breaches by the Respondent.°”° By contrast, the
latter submits that it has shown that the CBB had more than adequate justification to

place Future Bank in administration.°”

Second, the Respondent argues that the payment of adequate compensation is being
envisaged. Following administration, the CBB maintained Future Bank’s liquidity in
order to pay its depositors. In fact, under the CBB’s control, Future Bank’s value
increased and the bank was even able to settle transactions with Bank Melli following

removal from the OFAC list in January 2016.6”

In any event, says the Respondent, the Claimants will receive a payment roughly
equivalent to the “fair market value of the expropriated investment immediately before
the expropriation occurred”, in accordance with Article 6 of the BIT, through the

liquidation proceedings currently underway.°””

3. Analysis

Article 6(1) of the BIT prohibits unlawful expropriation of investments in the following

terms:

Investments of investors of either Contracting Party shall not be nationalized,

confiscated, expropriated, or subjected to similar measures by the other

Contracting Party except such measures are taken for public purposes, in

accordance with due process of law, in a non-discriminatory manner and

effective and appropriate compensation is envisaged. The amount of

compensation shall be paid without delay.
The primary question that the Tribunal must answer in relation to the expropriation claim
is whether the Respondent’s measures constituted an expropriation. It is undisputed that
the CBB Decision suspended the exercise of the Claimants’ shareholding rights in Future

Bank in the following terms:

You must give the CBB's representative, Mr. Ahmed Buhiji, Director of
Banking Services Directorate who is delivering this letter to you, full access
to your premises and business, its records and its systems. Your staff must
comply with our instructions going forward. The legal rights of all directors,
management and shareholders in relation to the company, are now suspended.
The CBB has assumed full managerial control over your business."

While this decision was by its nature temporary, the CBB eventually determined that
Future Bank was operating in violation of applicable Bahraini laws and consequently
issued the notice of liquidation on December 22, 2016.°* Since then, the Claimants have
neither been re-established in their rights as shareholders of Future Bank, nor have they
received the bank’s liquidation proceeds. The Respondent has provided no detailed
information about the liquidation process and its timeline. In these circumstances, the
Tribunal finds that the deprivation of the Claimants’ shareholding interest in Future Bank
has become permanent. The Respondent does not appear to dispute the premises of this
conclusion, as it maintains that the CBB’s “decision to make the administration
permanent was informed by the findings of the intensive examination undertaken during

the May 2015 Investigation”.**

Award

Page 176 of 235

The Tribunal notes that the CBB’s decisions concerning the administration and
liquidation of Future Bank directly affected the Claimants’ rights as shareholders in
Future Bank. Therefore, the Tribunal is not persuaded by the Respondent’s argument that
its measures did not constitute an expropriation, given that Future Bank’s banking licence
was a mere privilege rather than a property interest. Even assuming the correctness of the
premise of the Respondent’s argument, according to which the expropriation provision
only protects property interests, the Tribunal notes that the disputed measures interfered
with the exercise of the Claimants’ shareholding rights in Future Bank, which are
undoubtedly property interests. As the Tribunal explained above, such intervention
became permanent as the Claimants have no realistic prospect of being re-established in
their rights as shareholders; nor is it clear, more than six years from the Future Bank’s
placement in administration, whether and to what extent the Claimants will receive

proceeds from the bank’s liquidation.

In addition, to determine whether the Respondent’s measures were expropriatory, the
Tribunal must assess whether Bahrain took the measures within the recognized limits of
the State’s regulatory and police powers. Indeed, if the administration and liquidation of
Future Bank were a bona fide, non-discriminatory and proportionate answer to Future
Bank’s unlawful activities, such measures would not qualify as an expropriation and
would therefore not give rise to the State’s duty to provide compensation. To hold
otherwise would entail that States could be held liable to pay compensation for enforcing

their existing laws and regulations against the investor’s wrongdoings.

The jurisprudence of investment treaty tribunals is consistent in that a State’s bona fide
enforcement of its regulations against the investor’s illicit activities does not constitute
an expropriation and is thus not compensable.** Regulatory and police powers are of
particular relevance when an investment treaty tribunal scrutinizes the State’s conduct in
fields such as banking, where the investors are required to comply with a myriad of
regulations designed to protect the stability of the financial sector and, more generally,

the public welfare.

A number of investment tribunals have highlighted the role of the police and regulatory
powers in the field of banking and finance. For instance, in Saluka v. Czech Republic, the
tribunal reasoned that the treaty’s expropriation provision left a regulatory space for the

State’s bona fide non-compensable regulations:

Article 5 imports into the Treaty the customary international law notion that
a deprivation can be justified if it results from the exercise of regulatory
actions aimed at the maintenance of public order [...] States are not liable to
pay compensation to a foreign investor when, in the normal exercise of their
regulatory powers, they adopt in a non-discriminatory manner bona fide
regulations that are aimed at the general welfare.

Similarly, in Levi v. Peru, the tribunal found that the central bank’s intervention in the
claimant’s bank was justified since the latter’s violations of banking regulations led to
the bank’s loss of liquidity.°*° The tribunal accepted that “in evaluating a claim of
expropriation it is important to recognize a State’s legitimate right to regulate and to
exercise its police power in the interests of public welfare and not to confuse measures

of that nature with expropriation”.°*”

In Genin v. Estonia, the tribunal held that the central bank’s revocation of the claimants’
banking licence due to the latter’s recurring self-dealing activities and repeated failure to
comply with the regulator’s demands for information on the ultimate owners of the bank,
constituted a non-compensable measure. In reaching this conclusion, the tribunal
analyzed whether the respondent’s conduct was motivated by genuine regulatory
concerns:

[T]he reluctance of Mr. Genin to divulge the beneficial ownership of

Eurocapital, which would have enabled the Bank of Estonia’s Banking

Supervision department to understand the relationship of the various entities

associated with him, was the cause of legitimate concern and cannot be
considered to have been a mere excuse, or pretext, to revoke EIB’s license.**

As the Tribunal determined above, the record contains evidence of certain unlawful

activities by Future Bank. The Tribunal must determine whether such evidence provided

Page 178 of 235

a genuine cause for Bahrain’s measures against Future Bank. In this respect, the Tribunal
agrees with the Respondent that it owes a certain degree of deference to the State’s
specialized regulatory organ, the CBB.°*? Indeed, the Tribunal cannot sit in judgment of
every procedural or substantive error of the regulator, or else it would encroach on the
function of an administrative review body or an appellate court. Genuine errors or
inefficiencies of a regulator would not transform the State’s bona fide enforcement of its

regulations into a compensable expropriation.

That said, the gravity and multiplicity of the regulator’s errors may well call into question
the true intent behind the impugned measures. When scrutinizing the purported
regulatory conduct, the Tribunal must focus its analysis on the evidence (or the lack
thereof) of the connection between the impugned measures and the investor’s unlawful
activities. It should also analyze whether the measures were arbitrary, discriminatory,
disproportionate and contrary to the requirements of due process. This inquiry overlaps

with but is not identical to the question of lawfulness of expropriation.

With these initial observations in mind, the Tribunal proceeds with analyzing the record.
It will first set out a summary of the applicable legal framework (a), and will then embark
on the analysis of whether the Respondent’s measures constituted a bona fide regulatory

response to the Claimants’ unlawful activities (b).

(a) Regulatory Framework

To determine whether the Respondent’s measures constituted a bona fide exercise of
regulatory powers, the Tribunal should first analyze the legal framework under which the
Respondent took such measures. Thus, the Tribunal sets out the regulatory framework
that applied to the placement of Future Bank in administration and its eventual

liquidation.

i, The CBB Law

Article 136 of the CBB Law provides as follows:

(a) The Central Bank may, pursuant to a justified resolution, assume the
administration of a Licensee or may appoint another person (the “External

Administrator’’) to conduct the administration of a Licensee on behalf of the
Central Bank under any of the following circumstances:

1) If the Licensee becomes insolvent or appears most likely to be insolvent.

2) If the License is amended or cancelled pursuant to the provisions of items
(1) and (3) of paragraph (c) of Article (48) of this law

3) If the Licensee continued to provide regulated services which resulted in
inflicting damages to financial services industry in the Kingdom.

(b) In this part the term administrator denotes the Central Bank if it assumes
the administration of the Licensee or any external administrator to be
appointed for this purpose.

Pursuant to Article 138(a), the Administrator “shall, promptly after assuming the
administration of a Licensee, publish a notice to this effect in the Official Gazette and in
one Arabic and one English language newspaper published in the Kingdom, and show
such notice in every place of business of the Licensee in the Kingdom all through the
period in which he assumes the administration”. By virtue of Article 138(b), “[t]he
appointment of the Administrator shall only have effect on the day following the

publication of such notice [...]”.

In accordance with Article 139(a), a licensee may, within the ten days following the date
of publication of the decision on placing it in administration, appeal to the Central Bank
against such decision. The appeal must be submitted in the form prepared by the Central
Bank for this purpose and accompanied by such supporting documents and information
as the Central Bank may specify. Article 139(b) provides that a decision must be reached
with regard to the appeal, and the appellant must be notified with the decision in writing
within 15 days of the date of submitting the appeal, and reasons must be given in case of
rejecting the appeal. Article 139(c) adds that the licensee may challenge the decision of
administration or rejection of the appeal, before the competent court, within 30 days from

the date of receipt of such decisions.

Pursuant to Article 143, the Administrator must submit, with the prior approval of the
Central Bank in case of an External Administrator, within a period of two years from the
commencement of the administration, a petition for compulsory liquidation of the
licensee or otherwise terminate the administration and restore the management to the

licensee.

645.

646.

691

PCA Case No. 2017-25
Award
Page 180 of 235

Article 145 provides for the grounds for compulsory liquidation which are (i) the
insolvency of the licensee, or (ii) a situation where compulsory liquidation is decisively

proved to be a just and equitable action.

ii. The CBB Rulebook

The CBB Rulebook™! is introduced by a statement (User Guide UG-A.1.1) that the CBB:

in its capacity as the regulatory and supervisory authority for all financial
institutions in Bahrain, issues regulatory instruments that licensees and other
specified persons are legally obliged to comply with. These regulatory
instruments are contained in the CBB Rulebook.

The CBB Rulebook contains the following guidance on administration:

EN 8.1.1

Article 136 of the CBB Law empowers (but does not oblige) the CBB to
assume the administration of a licensee in certain circumstances.
These circumstances are outlined in the above Article and may include
the following:

(a) The licensee has become insolvent;
(b) Its solvency is in jeopardy;

(c) Its continued activity is detrimental to the financial services industry in
the Kingdom; or

(d) Its license has been cancelled.
EN 8.2.1

The CBB views the administration of a licensee as a very powerful sanction,
and will generally only pursue this option if less severe measures are unlikely
to achieve its supervisory objectives.

EN 8.2.2

Although Article 136 of the CBB Law specifies the circumstances in which
the CBB may pursue an administration, it does not oblige the CBB to
administer a licensee. Faced with the circumstances described, the CBB may
pursue other courses of action such as suspension of a license (under Article
131 of the CBB Law), if it considers that these are more likely to achieve the
supervisory outcomes sought. Because an administration is likely to send a
negative signal to the markets about the status of a licensee, other supervisory
actions may in fact be preferable in terms of protecting the interests of those
with a claim on the licensee.

EN 8.2.3

 

The criteria used by the CBB in deciding whether to seek an administration
of a licensee include the following:

CBB Rulebook (PS-30).

PCA Case No. 2017-25
Award
Page 181 of 235

(a) the extent to which the interests of the market, its users and those who
have a claim on the licensee would be best served by the administration of the
license, for instance because of the potential impact on asset values arising
from an administration;

(b) the extent to which other regulatory actions could reasonably be expected
to achieve the CBB's desired supervisory objectives (such as restrictions on
the licensee's operations, including limitations on new business and asset
disposals);

(c) the extent to which the liquidity or solvency of the licensee is in jeopardy;
and

(d) the extent to which the licensee has contravened the conditions of the CBB
Law, including the extent to which the contraventions reflect more
widespread or systemic weaknesses in controls and/or management.

EN 8.3 Procedure for Implementing an Administration

EN 8.3.1

All proposals for assuming the administration of a licensee are subject to a
thorough review by the CBB of all relevant facts, assessed against the criteria
outlined in Section EN 8.1.

EN 8.3.2

A formal notice of administration is issued to the licensee concerned and
copies posted in every place of business of the licensee. As soon as practicable
thereafter, the notice is also published in the Official Gazette and in one
Arabic and one English newspapers in the Kingdom. The term “in
administration” should be clearly marked in all the bank’s correspondence
and on its website, next to the bank’s name.

EN 8.3.3

Article 136 of the CBB Law allows a licensee 10 days following the
administration taking effect in which to appeal to the CBB. If the CBB refuses
the appeal, the licensee has a further 30 calendar days from the date of the
refusal in which to lodge an appeal at the courts. So as to reduce the potential
damage of an administration order being applied and then withdrawn on
appeal, where feasible the CBB will give advance notice to a licensee's Board
of its intention to seek an administration, and allow the Board the right of
appeal prior to an administration notice being formally served.

647. In so far as relevant for present purposes, the overall effect of these provisions of the

CBB Law and the CBB Rulebook can be summarized as follows:

(1) The CBB may, pursuant to a justified resolution, appoint a person to be the
administrator of a licensed bank if the bank “continued to provide regulated
services which resulted in inflicting damages to financial services industry”
in Bahrain (CBB Law, Article 136(a)(3) or “its continued activity is
detrimental to the financial services industry” in Bahrain (CBB Rulebook,

EN 8.1.1(c)).

The CBB Rulebook, EN 8.2, emphasises that

the CBB is not obliged to pursue administration which is a very
powerful sanction only to be pursued if less severe measures are
unlikely to achieve the CBB’s supervisory objectives;

the CBB may pursue other courses of action such as suspension of a
license if it considers that these are more likely to achieve the
supervisory outcomes sought; and

other supervisory actions may be preferable to protect the interests of
those with a claim on the bank.

The CBB Rulebook, EN 8.2.3, sets out the criteria which will be applied by
the CBB in deciding whether to seek an administration, including
the extent to which other regulatory actions can reasonably be expected

to achieve the CBB’s desired supervisory objectives (such as
restrictions on the bank’s operations); and

the extent to which the bank has contravened the conditions of the CBB
Law, including the extent to which the contraventions reflect more
widespread or systemic weaknesses in controls and/or management.

All proposals for assuming the administration of a bank are subject to a
thorough review by the CBB of all relevant facts, assessed against the criteria
outlined in EN 8.1, which include that the bank’s continued activity is

detrimental to the financial services industry in Bahrain.

To reduce the potential damage of an administration order being applied and
then withdrawn on appeal, where feasible the CBB will give advance notice
to a bank’s board of its intention to seek an administration, and allow the
board the right of appeal prior to an administration notice being formally

served.

Pursuant to the FC Module of the CBB Rulebook, a bank must review the
effectiveness of its AML/CFT procedures, systems and controls at least once
each calendar year, and the review must include (inter alia) a report as to the
quality of the bank’s anti-money laundering procedures, systems and
controls, and compliance with the AML Law and the CBB Rulebook Module,
which the bank must instruct external auditors to produce by April 30 of the

following year (FC 4.3.1(d), FC 4.3.5).

Consequently, administration is a last resort if less severe sanctions will not achieve the
regulatory objective. Any proposal for administration is subject to a thorough review of
all relevant facts, including the detrimental effect on the financial services industry.

Where feasible, an advance notice will be given to the bank’s board.

In the following section, the Tribunal will examine whether Bahrain’s measures
constituted a bona fide enforcement of this regulatory framework against Future Bank’s

unlawful activities.

(b) Did the CBB’s Measures Constitute a Bona Fide Enforcement of

the Applicable Regulations?
In this section, the Tribunal analyzes whether the CBB’s measures were a genuine
response to Future Bank’s unlawful activities. To make this assessment, the Tribunal
must review, inter alia, the evidence of illegalities available to the CBB at the time of its
decisions of administration and liquidation and the evidence of the reasons considered

by the CBB when taking its decisions.

Having carefully considered the record and the Parties’ arguments, the Tribunal is
persuaded that Bahrain’s measures against Future Bank were not genuine regulatory
measures aiming at addressing Future Bank’s unlawful conduct. The reasons are as

follows.

i NoCe Trace of Consideration of R.

 

The record lacks contemporaneous trace of the CBB’s consideration of reasons for the
measures it took against Future Bank. As described above, the Respondent alleges that
the CBB resolved to put Future Bank into administration at the Crisis Committee
Management meeting of April 30, 2015. In the course of the document production
process, the Respondent produced a set of minutes of that meeting, which reads as

follows:

Time: 3pm

Place: Fifth floor

1. Sheikh Salman Ben Issa Al Khalifa, executive director of banking
operations — head of the committee

2. Mr. Khaled Hamad Abdel Rahman, executive director of the
banking supervision body

3. Mr. Abdel Rahman Mohamad Baker, executive director of the
financial institution supervision body

4. Mr. Manar Mostafa Al Sayed, assistant to the general advisor
The following topic was discussed:

1. Putting Future Bank under administration

2. Putting the Iranian Insurance Company under administration

Based on article 136 of the Law regarding the Bahrain Central Bank, and
given the fact that Future Bank and the Iranian Insurance Company are still
offering services under supervision will cause harm to the production of
financial services and the general interest in the Kingdom, the committee
recommends the following:

“Putting Future Bank and the Iranian Insurance Company under the
administration of the Bahrain Central Bank”.

The minutes record that the meeting was attended by the Executive Directors of the CBB,
none of whom made a witness statements. Only Mr. Hamad, the CBB Executive Director,

attended to give evidence at the hearing following a direction by the Tribunal.

Be that as it may, the minutes contain no record of a discussion of the reasons for the
decisions, but simply reflect the recommendation to put Future Bank and Iran Insurance
Company under the CBB’s administration because they “are still offering services under
supervision [and] will cause harm to the production of financial services and the general

interest in the Kingdom”.

The CBB Governor Al Maraj, who actually took the decision on administration, could
not recall any discussion of the reasons for the decision, but assumed that discussion must
have taken place in previous meetings over many months. In his first witness
statement, he said that in 2015 the Executive Directors of the CBB’s Retail Banking
Supervision, Banking Operations, and Financial Institutions Directorates raised the issue

of the future of Future Bank with him, because Future Bank’s aberrant behaviour had

reached a stage where its continuation was affecting the wider financial sector in

Bahrain.+ However, there is no paper trail of such internal discussion.

The minutes are the only contemporaneous evidence documenting the process of the
CBB’s decision-making with respect to Future Bank’s administration, and even this
single document is a result of a production order. Indeed, the Tribunal ordered the

Respondent to produce:

All correspondence exchanged, or minutes of meetings held internally or

collectively, by organs of Respondent, including the office of the H-E. The

King, Ministers, Ministries, the CBB or other governmental entities and their

employees or officers, as well as all internal Documents to the CBB, the

Ministry of Finance, or the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, that relate to who and

which organ originally triggered the process that led to the decision to place

Future Bank under administration as communicated on April 30, 2015 [...] at

what exact time this process was triggered, for what reasons, the nature and

extent of the due diligence undertaken prior to the April 30, 2015 taking, and

in relation thereto, and at what time the process culminated in, and the

decision taken and by which organ with respect to, the decision to place

Future Bank under administration as communicated on April 30, 2015.°
The only document relevant to this order that the Respondent produced was precisely the
minutes of the Crisis Management Committee. The Tribunal can thus conclude that there
is no contemporaneous evidence of any discussion of the reasons for putting Future Bank

under the CBB’s administration.

The Governor of the CBB wrote in his witness statement that the purpose of his
consulting the Crisis Management Committee prior to making the decision on
administration was to ensure that his decision would be informed by the most up-to-date
information, as considered by the three individuals directly responsible for monitoring
and supervising the Bank. Yet, neither the meeting minutes, nor any other
documentary evidence, demonstrate consideration of any up-to-date information

concerning Future Bank’s compliance with the applicable regulations.

As the record stands, not only did the CBB not discuss evidence of Future Bank’s alleged

illegal activities when placing it under administration, but no such contemporaneous

evidence existed. As set out in the section on preliminary objections above, the record
contains limited evidence of Future Bank’s unlawful activities. Even that limited
evidence is, however, a result of the CBB’s examination of Future Bank’s records after

the Respondent’s decisions of administration and liquidation.

By way of example, with respect to the alleged violations of the applicable sanctions, the
Tribunal found that the existing evidence only partly substantiates the allegations with
respect of Future Bank’s dealings with IRISL, SOC and ISOC. The evidence of such
illegalities were contained in the 2018 CBB Report. There is no indication that the CBB
was aware of these violations at the time of its decision to place the bank into

administration in April 2015.

Governor Al Maraj conceded at the hearing that, when taking the decision to place Future
Bank under administration, he did not have benefit of any compliance reports for the year
2014 or January-April 2015.°7 While on April 29, 2015, KPMG had issued an
assessment report for the year 2014, Governor Al Maraj confirmed that he did not see
that report.® The Respondent has provided no evidence that the CBB gave any
consideration to the KPMG report when making its decision. In any event, the
Respondent’s banking compliance expert Mr. Sharma opined that the KPMG report may
not on its own have been a reason to put Future Bank into administration and conceded
that it was not proved that it was taken into account at all.°? The Respondent’s fact
witness Mr. Hamad also confirmed that there was no documentary assessment of the
situation, and that there were no compliance or inspection reports for 2014 (adverse or

otherwise), prior to the April 30, 2015 decision.”

This stands in sharp contrast with the requirements of the regulatory framework
summarized above.”! In particular, pursuant to the CBB Rulebook, the procedure for

placing a bank under administration should have been initiated by way of a proposal to

this effect, which would then be subject to a “thorough review” by the CBB of all relevant
facts, assessed against specific criteria.”? The Respondent’s witness Mr. Hamad
confirmed this at the hearing, stating that there was a need for a thorough review before
putting a bank in administration under the CBB Rulebook, EN 8.3.1.7"? Had the CBB
followed this rule, there would have been an extensive documentary record readily

available at the CBB, which the Respondent would have been able to produce.

As the Claimants’ banking compliance expert Mr. Brain confirms, a decision such as the
placement of a bank under administration would normally be preceded by substantial
recent investigations and exchanges with the Bank’s representatives, documenting the
grounds for such action, and the insufficient or unsatisfactory nature of the responses

provided or remedial measures implemented by the Bank.”*

In turn, the Respondent’s banking compliance expert Mr. Sharma was asked in cross-
examination whether he knew “what the CBB relied on to justify, to take the decision to
place the bank in administration”. His answer was “[...] no, I can’t say [...] that they
used all the information in their possession, readily available to them, easily accessible
to them. I cannot say [...] They used all of that”.”°° Furthermore, on the question: “Do
you know what they used?”, his answer was in the negative. He also stated that, when he
sought the information from the Respondent, what he received was Governor Al Maraj’s
witness statement, which he thought “actually does go some way to answer as to what
information they used”. He eventually accepted that four years after the administration
“we still do not know what information the regulators relied on when taking the
decision”.”°° Mr. Sharma further conceded that there had been no prior case in which a

Bahraini bank had been put into administration without an investigation report.’”

The Tribunal is persuaded that, if there had been a genuine decision to place Future Bank

into administration on one of the grounds in section 136(a) of the CBB Law there would

have been a full documentary record of internal correspondence, reports, and minutes of
meetings discussing the reasons justifying such an extreme measure. What is striking is
that there is not a single document other than the Crisis Management Committee minutes,
which were only produced at the document production stage, that sheds any light on the

reasons for the Respondent’s decision to put Future Bank into administration.

For these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the CBB placed Future Bank under
administration without any substantial deliberation or consideration of reasons for its
decision. The manifest lack of reasoning for a decision of such severity does not comply
with the applicable regulatory framework and suggests that the Respondent’s impugned

conduct was not a legitimate law enforcement measure.

ii. Evidence of Political Targeting

The Tribunal cannot ignore the wider political context that prevailed at the time when
Bahrain took the impugned measures. In particular, on April 2, 2015, a few weeks before
Bahrain placed Future Bank under administration, it was announced that Iran had agreed
with the United States, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia, and China to
accept constraints on its nuclear programme in exchange for partial relief from sanctions.
The JCPOA was then signed on July 14, 2015. Press reports indicated that Saudi Arabia
was strongly opposed to the JCPOA and had been pressuring neighboring (and other)
States to sever ties with Iran. As for Bahrain, it is reported to have strong ties with Saudi

Arabia and to be economically dependent on Saudi Arabia.’

In this respect, the Tribunal considers it significant that Iran Insurance Company was put
into administration on the same day as Future Bank. In his first witness statement
Governor Al Maraj’s testified that Future Bank was the only item on the agenda of the
meeting of the Crisis Management Committee. That witness statement was filed before
the production of the minutes of the Crisis Management Committee meeting, which
revealed that the committee also recommended that Iran Insurance Company be put into

administration.” In the absence of any contemporaneous documents about the reasons

for recommending administration, it remains unclear what led the CBB to target these

two Iranian entities on the same day.

In the SoC, the Claimants alleged that the administration of Future Bank was part of a
wider campaign against Iranian interests, which included the measure against Iran
Insurance Company, and the freezing of assets of the Central Bank of Iran in a large
number of banks in Bahrain.’!° The Respondent did not rebut these allegations in the

SoD.

The Reply reiterated the allegations, adding that the fact that the decision covered both
Future Bank and Iran Insurance Company, although each of them had distinct activities
and business models, confirmed that these were not case-specific, but rather generic and
political measures.’!! The Rejoinder did not engage with this argument but merely stated
that Iran Insurance Company’s claims are not before this Tribunal, and that such entity

is not actively pursuing its claims.

In oral evidence before the Tribunal, Governor Al Maraj testified that he had not asked
the Crisis Management Committee to discuss Iran Insurance Company at the same time
as Future Bank, but that the committee elected to consider both because they were in the
same situation.’!? The record contains no information as to any assessment of the
similarity of the situations of these two entities. The only similarity that is apparent is

that both of them were Iranian-owned businesses.

While the Tribunal does not consider the evidence before it sufficient to demonstrate a
nationality-based discrimination, the political context and the absence of any thorough
review of the reasons for putting these Iranian entities into administration on the same
date constitute a strong circumstantial evidence of a motivation of political retribution

behind the CBB’s impugned measures.

What is more, the statement made by the CBB official Mr. Hamad after the CBB placed

Future Bank under administration further reveals the political dimension of the decision.

The Claimants’ record of the meeting of May 3, 2015 between the CBB and Future Bank

records Mr. Hamad saying:

1. It is a Sovereign Decision to put the Bank into Administration.
2. It is decided to liquidate the Bank.
3. M Ahmed Buhejil [sic] will be the Administrator of the Bank.

5. If you want you can go for voluntary liquidation, else we will initiate the
process for liquidation.”

674. The meaning of Mr. Hamad’s statement that “[i]t is a Sovereign Decision to put the Bank

675.

into Administration” is controversial. The Claimants rely on the phrase as evidence that
the decision was not taken as a matter of banking regulation but was a purely political
decision taken at the ministerial level.’'* The Respondent contends that the term
“sovereign decision” does not assist the Claimants’ position, since the decision was said
to be “sovereign” simply because it came from the CBB.”"° In his closing submissions,
counsel for the Respondent dismissed the reference to “sovereign decision” on the basis
that “every exercise of regulatory power necessarily involves a sovereign decision by the

delegated agency of a sovereign government which makes a decision”.’!°

In the light of the other evidence discussed above, the Tribunal is persuaded that the
reference to a “Sovereign Decision” in the record of the May 3, 2015 meeting provides
an additional indication that the CBB’s conduct against Future Bank was dictated by a
political agenda as opposed to regulatory considerations. Indeed, not only does the
natural meaning of the expression, and the context in which it was used, support this
conclusion, but it would also have been pointless for Mr. Hamad to mention that the
decision was sovereign if all that he had meant to convey was that the decision had been

taken by the CBB, as a State organ, a fact that was clear to everyone.

iii. No Recent Warnings or Expressions of Concerns

The record contains limited evidence of the CBB raising the alleged violations of
applicable regulations either internally or with Future Bank in the time leading to the

impugned decisions.

Mr. Hamad testified that he raised the issue of Future Bank’s irresponsible conduct with
Governor AI Maraj in 2015, but he could not remember in which month he did so or how
many times.”!7 He said that sometime between January and April 2015, he told Governor
Al Maraj about his concern with Future Bank’s sanction breaking”'*® but that he did not
show Governor Al Maraj any documents, because the Governor had access to inspection
reports. 7! Later, Mr. Hamad admitted however that, at the time of the decision on the
placement of Future Bank under administration, there were no compliance or inspection
reports for the year 2014, and no fine or official warning toward Future Bank as from
2012.72° Governor Al Maraj corroborated this account conceding that, since 2012, the

CBB had not warned or fined Future Bank for any unlawful activities. 7?!

Furthermore, Governor Al Maraj was not able to say when between January 2015 and
April 2015 Mr. Hamad raised the issue of Future Bank with him.’””? Nor could he recall

when the other executive directors could have raised the issue.”>

In answer to a question from the President as to why the CBB waited until 2015 to take
action after a period with no fines or specific warnings to Future Bank, the Governor
responded that he was “‘a very patient man”, but he eventually decided that administration

was the right way to deal with the situation.’”*

There is no evidence why it was precisely in April 2015 that the Governor decided that
it was no longer appropriate to exercise his patience, especially given that at that time he
did not have access to any recent compliance reports for the years 2014 or 2015. Under
cross-examination, Mr. Hamad said that he did not know why Governor Al Maraj

convened the Crisis Management Committee meeting of April 30, 2015.”*°

This evidence corroborates that the CBB’s measures against Future Bank were not
motivated by bona fide regulatory objective of protecting the stability of Bahrain’s

financial sector from Future Bank’s unlawful activities.

iv. No Consideration of Less Restrictive Alternatives

As summarized above, the CBB Rulebook provides that the CBB “views the
administration of a licensee as a very powerful sanction, and will generally only pursue
this option if less severe measures are unlikely to achieve its supervisory objectives”.’”°
It further specifies that “the CBB may pursue other courses of action such as suspension
of a license [...] because an administration is likely to send a negative signal to the
markets”.’”” Mr. Hamad accepted at the hearing that administration is a measure reserved

for extreme cases.7”8

The record contains no evidence of the CBB considering less restrictive measures.
Governor Al Maraj’s testified at the hearing that no remedy other than administration
and liquidation was considered.’? This was confirmed by Mr. Hamad, who noted that
all three executive directors came to the Crisis Management Committee meeting of
April 30, 2015 convinced that they should put an end to Future Bank.”° According to
him, he had no need to prepare for the April 30, 2015 meeting because he was pressing

Governor Al Maraj to put an end to Future Bank.”*!

No credible reason has been suggested why suspension of Future Bank’s license, which
is expressly envisaged by the CBB Rulebook, would not have been sufficient to prevent
damage to Bahrain’s financial system. Mr. Sharma sought to justify the absence of other
remedies by an assumption that the CBB had already taken measures such as capping
Iranian exposure.’*? In the view of the Tribunal, that is not an adequate answer. As the
Tribunal found, at the time of placing the bank under administration, the CBB did not
have any compliance reports from the years 2014-2015. Thus, the CBB had no
information on whether Future Bank had ignored its past warnings on issues such as
Tranian exposure. Therefore, such past warnings could not have justified the election of

the most drastic measure, without a consideration of alternatives.

That the CBB had resolved to put Future Bank into administration and eventual
liquidation without considering less restrictive measures is further confirmed by the
record of the May 3, 2015 meeting. As reproduced above, the record shows Mr. Hamad
saying to Future Bank: “If you want you can go for voluntary liquidation, else we will
initiate the process for liquidation”.”*> The written evidence of the Claimants’ witness
Mr. Souri bears out that Mr. Hamad announced that a decision had been made to liquidate
Future Bank already at that time, and that the only decision for the shareholders was
whether it would be a voluntary or a compulsory liquidation.”** The Respondent did not

cross-examine Mr. Souri on his account of the meeting.

In turn, Mr. Hamad gave evidence that he had no minutes of the meeting, but said that he
did not recall telling Mr. Souri that there was a decision to liquidate at that point.”*> He
had reported on the meeting to Governor Al Maraj,”*° which the latter confirmed without
recalling the details.’*”

The Tribunal notes that the Respondent has not produced any written trace of its record

of the May 3, 2015 meeting or the internal report by Mr. Hamad to Governor Al Maraj.

the content of the witness testimony, the Tribunal is satisfied that, as of May 3, 2015, the
CBB had already decided to liquidate Future Bank, be it by voluntary or compulsory

liquidation.

It follows from these conclusions that the Respondent’s ex post facto justifications for
the administration have limited relevance for determining the actual reasons for the
CBB’s measures. The decision to put Future Bank into administration and then

liquidation was a political one and not a result of the bank’s alleged shortcomings.

Overall, the staggering absence of evidence of consideration of reasons for the
administration, the CBB’s choice not to await and review new compliance information,
as well as its failure to consider less restrictive alternative measures, when put in the
political context prevailing at the time of the impugned measures, lead to the conclusion
that the Respondent’s purported justification for its measures was merely pretextual.
Instead, the evidence in the record demonstrates that the Respondent acted with a

contrived agenda of political retribution against the Claimants’ investment.

For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal concludes that Future Bank’s administration and
liquidation were not bona fide regulatory measures. It follows that the deprivation of the
Claimants’ shareholding interests in Future Bank was not a non-compensable measure.
As the Tribunal explained above, while the Claimants remain nominal owners of their
shares in Future Bank, they have not been able to exercise their shareholding rights for
over six years, with the result that the deprivation has become permanent. Therefore, the
administration and liquidation of Future Bank, not being a justified exercise of police and
regulatory power, constituted an indirect expropriation of the Claimants’ shareholding

interests in Future Bank.

(c) Lawfulness of Expropriation

The Tribunal must determine next whether the expropriation was lawful. The first
requirement that Article 6(1) of the BIT sets for the lawfulness of expropriation is that
expropriatory measures must be “taken for public purposes”.”* As explained above, the

question whether the measures were for a public purpose overlaps to a significant extent

BIT (CL-1), Article 6(1).

693.

with the question whether the disputed measures constituted a legitimate non-
compensable regulation, which the Tribunal answered in the negative in the preceding
section. In particular, as the Tribunal determined above, the CBB’s administration and
liquidation decisions were politically motivated, disproportionate measures that

manifestly lacked contemporaneous rational justification.

The Tribunal recognizes that it owes a certain degree of deference to the State’s
determination of the existence of a public purpose. As the Respondent rightly cites,
according to the Marfin v. Cyprus tribunal, “[a] decision to revoke a bank’s license,
which takes place within a detailed national legal framework that includes administrative
and judicial remedies, is not reviewed at the international law level for its correctness,

but rather for whether it offends the more basic requirements of international law”.’*?

Similarly, according to the tribunal in Vestey Group v. Venezuela, “[i]nternational
tribunals should thus accept the policies determined by the state for the common good,
except in situations of blatant misuse of the power to set public policies”.”*° The tribunal
went on to say, however, that the deference owed to a sovereign’s policies does not
exempt the measures from scrutiny as to “whether the impugned expropriatory measure
was for the public purpose as Article 5(1) of the BIT requires [expropriation

provision]”.”4!

As noted earlier, the lack of reasons for the disputed measures and the pretextual nature
of the post hoc justification advanced by the Respondent are manifest. The Tribunal has
not scrutinized the Respondent’s measures for mere mistakes of fact or law. Rather, it
has found that the measures were unreasonable, disproportionate and politically
motivated. For these same reasons, the Tribunal considers that the expropriatory

measures did not meet the requirement of a public purpose under Article 6(1) of the BIT.

In addition, the Tribunal notes that, to this day, the Claimants have received no
compensation for the expropriation of their shareholding interests in Future Bank. While

the Respondent contends that the Claimants are entitled to the proceeds of liquidation of

the bank, Article 6(1) of the BIT requires that “effective and appropriate compensation

[...] be paid without delay”.

The Tribunal held above that the Respondent’s decision to place Future Bank in
administration was not a legitimate exercise of regulatory powers, but constituted an
indirect expropriation. It also considered that the Respondent had resolved to liquidate
Future Bank from the outset of the administration. It follows that the Respondent’s
obligation to pay effective and appropriate compensation arose at the time when the CBB
placed the bank under administration, i.e., on April 30, 2015. The continued lack of
compensation more than six years after the expropriation does not comply with the

requirement of compensation “paid without delay” under Article 6(1) of the BIT.

Having reached these conclusions, the Tribunal can dispense with analyzing whether the
expropriation may also be unlawful on additional grounds, including discrimination and

lack of due process.

B. OTHER ALLEGED TREATY VIOLATIONS

The Claimants allege violations of standards of treatment contained in Articles 4(1) of
the BIT, which require that investments be accorded “full legal protection and fair
treatment not less favourable than that accorded to its own investors or to the investors
of any third state who are in a comparable situation’”.’*? They also invoke Article 5 of the
BIT, which provides for the application of more favourable provisions available to the

investors in the following terms:

If the laws of either Contracting Party, or obligations under international
agreements existing at present or established hereafter between the
Contracting Parties in addition to the present Agreement contain rules,
whether general or specific, entitling investments by investors of the other
Contracting Party to a treatment more favourable than is provided for by the
present Agreement, such rules shall, to the extent that they are more
favourable, prevail over the present Agreement.”

The factual premises on which the Claimants rely in respect of these other standards of

protection are the same as those underlying their unlawful expropriation claim. A finding

of a violation of Article 4 or 5 of the BIT would not therefore alter the Tribunal’s analysis

on reparation, or the quantification of the compensation.

The Claimants do request a declaration of breach of Articles 4, 5 and 6 of the BIT.
However, in the interest of procedural economy, the Tribunal can dispense with entering
into the analysis of alleged violations that would not alter or add to the remedies already

available to the Claimants.

The Tribunal recognizes that, as some investment tribunals have held, declaration of a
breach can itself constitute a form of reparation, specifically the form of satisfaction.”*
That being said, as Article 37(1) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility indicates,
satisfaction can be elected as a remedy “insofar as [the injury] cannot be made good by
restitution or compensation.””4> In the present case, and as further elaborated in the
section on reparation below, the Claimants’ loss can be remedied by compensation.
Therefore, even if the Claimants’ request for a declaration of breach of Articles 4 and 5
of the BIT could be deemed as a request for satisfaction, the Tribunal could dispense with

ruling on that request as the harm can be made good by way of compensation.
REPARATION

The Tribunal will first summarize the Parties’ positions (A and B), and then proceed to

the analysis (C).

A. THE CLAIMANTS’ POSITION

At the Hearing, the Claimants amended their relief requests for and withdrew their claim
for restitution of their investment.”4° Thus, they claim monetary compensation and moral

damages.

1. Monetary Compensation

The Claimants request monetary compensation encompassing (i) payment of fair market
value of the Claimants’ investment, including lost profits, and (ii) pre-award interest, to
compensate for the loss of business opportunities suffered following April 30, 2015, as a

result of the Respondent’s breaches. “7

(a) Payment of the Fair Market Value of the Investment

According to the Claimants, the BIT standard of fair market value of the expropriated
investment applies to lawful expropriation. As the expropriation was unlawful, according
to the Claimants, compensation must be determined in accordance with general principles
of international law, which provide for “full reparation based on the investment’s fair
market value”.748 Citing several awards and the ILC Articles, the Claimants submit that

this standard includes future lost profits.”

The Claimants identify three valuation methods generally accepted in the literature and
arbitral jurisprudence for valuing the fair market value of a banking venture: (i) the
income-based approach; (ii) the market-based approach; and (iii) the asset-based
approach. For present purposes, they favour the ‘income-based approach’. The Claimants.
submit that this method is the most suitable in the light of Future Bank’s proven track
record of profitability, and the “certainty” that it would continue to generate the same or

greater levels of profit, particularly in the light of the JCPOA.7°°

In support of this approach, the Claimants refer to the Quiborax v. Bolivia tribunal, which
found that in circumstances where the expropriated investment has a “proven record of
profitability” it is “widely accepted [that] the appropriate method to assess the [Fair

Market Value]” is through the Discounted Cash Flow method.”*!

Under this methodology, the Claimants consider that they are entitled at least to an
amount between EUR 271.7 million and EUR 300.9 million.”? Their expert from Fair
Links arrives at these figures based on two scenarios involving “the book value of Future
Bank’s equity and the present value of its future economic profits (measured as Future
Bank’s earnings less a charge reflecting Future Bank’s cost of equity)”.”? The first
scenario, which is conservative, values Future Bank on the basis of the return on equity
for the year 2014, reaching EUR 280.3 million, revised in the second Fair Links report
to EUR 300.9 million. For the Claimants, these figures do not account for the growth
Future Bank would have achieved in the wake of the JCPOA.’™* The second scenario,
which is allegedly even more conservative, relies on the average return on equity for the
years 2005-2014, reaching EUR 253.1 million, revised in the second Fair Links report at
EUR 271.7 million.”5

In the alternative, the Claimants request an award of the fair market value of their
investment established based on the “value of comparable assets sold in the open market
[...], which accordingly factored in future profits of Future Bank, but failed to take into
account the particularly favorable circumstances and outlook existing at the time of the
taking”.’°° In valuing Future Bank through this method, Fair Links used the price-to-
earnings ratio (“P/E”), based on the assets’ earnings, and the price-to-book ratio (“P/B”),
which the Claimants submit is “particularly well suited for the valuation of banking
ventures”.”*” Using the P/E ratio, the First Fair Links Report values Future Bank at 234.5
EUR and, under the P/B ratio, at EUR 250 million.”* The second Fair Links Report
revised these values to EUR 259.7 million and EUR 243.5 million, respectively.”

As to the Respondent’s critique of the market-based and income-based evaluations
conducted by Fair Links, the Claimants submit that the Respondent has failed to establish
that Future Bank’s profits arose from violations of Bahraini law and international
sanctions. Even if that were so, as expressed by Fair Links, “it is unlikely that the decision
of a willing buyer to purchase Claimants’ shares in Future Bank would have been
influenced by potential concerns regarding the legitimacy of Future Bank’s profits”.”°
Indeed, Future Bank’s audited financial statements would form the basis of the buyer’s
assessment, and those do not record any violations. For the Claimants, there is thus no
reason why a willing buyer would have paid no more than an asset-based valuation of
Future Bank. In addition, the Claimants point out that the comparables used in the Fair
Links reports are commensurable to Future Bank and were thus a valid basis to establish

the fair market value of the investment.7°!

The Claimants do not find the argument that they hold assets in Future Bank to be
relevant in this regard, and assert that “there may be no set-off between the two amounts
[monies owed by the Claimants to Future Bank and the fair market value of Future Bank],

nor reduction of Bahrain’s obligations under international law”.”°

The Claimants further contend that using the income-based approach as implemented by
Fair Links is the minimum amount to which they are entitled, as both valuations of EUR
300.9 million and EUR 271.7 million, are conservative estimates, as is shown by the
proximity with the figures under the market-based approach at EUR 259.7 million and
EUR 243.5 million.’

As a final alternative, the Claimants submit that they are entitled to an award of EUR 214

million under the asset-based approach. ”*

(b) Pre-Award Interest

The Claimants request pre-award interest to remedy the harm caused by the loss of
business opportunities, “incurred as a result of Respondent’s failure to compensate

Claimants for the taking ‘without delay’ as provided for under the BIT”.”°

The Claimants’ expert uses Future Bank’s average 2015-2016 WACC as a pre-award
interest rate. They dismiss Mr. Davies’ objections in this respect on the grounds that

Mr. Davies misunderstands the purpose of the pre-award interests.’°°

On the assumption that an Award will be rendered in December 2019 and that the
Tribunal will adopt Fair Links’ income-based approach using Future Bank’s 2014
performance levels, the Claimants assert that they are entitled to pre-award interest in the

amount of EUR 133.4 million.”7

As an alternative, the Claimants submit that they are at least entitled to compensation for
the loss of business opportunities computed at a risk-free rate, which would result in an

interest award of EUR 34.1 million.”

(c) Post-Award Interest

The Claimant contends that, under international law, the principle of full reparation
implies that interest be paid on any amount awarded until settlement.” Hence, they claim
post-award interest at a rate of Libor +2%, compounded semi-annually, from the date
when an amount is due until payment.’ The Claimants seek post-award interest on all

amounts awarded, including arbitration costs.

2. Moral Damages

In addition to the fair market value of the investment, the Claimants request the payment

of moral and/or reputational damages.

According to the Claimants, it is generally accepted under international law and most
legal systems that legal persons may be granted moral damages in addition to economic
compensation if they have suffered harm to their “reputation, credit, or prestige”.””! In
support, the Claimants refer to several investment awards that have granted moral

damages.”

In the Claimants’ understanding, the Respondent has not disputed that their professional
reputation has indeed been seriously affected.””* The Claimants argue that such harm has
been exacerbated by the publication of information on the arbitration in the Washington
Post, especially “in the context of the [then] current administration in the US”.’* The
Claimants also aver that as a result of the “opportunities opened by the signature of the
JCPOA in July 2015”, the “devastating consequences for the Claimants’ reputation” were
made even worse.’”° In this regard, the Claimants highlight that Mr. Sharma, the expert
instructed by the Respondent, acknowledged that the JCPOA is a “material

development”.’”°

The Claimants request compensation for moral damages in the amount of EUR 10

million.”””

value of Future Bank has increased under administration and the Claimants already hold

the assets of Future Bank, thus the “hypothetical damage is zero” (1).’”8 It also rejects

the Claimants’ request for moral damages (2).

1. Monetary Compensation

The Respondent relies on the expert report of Mr. Davies of Alvarez & Marsal which
explains that the Claimants have incurred no damages. It stresses that the current value
of the Claimants’ shares in Future Bank is significantly higher than on the date of
administration. Therefore, the Claimants cannot succeed with the argument that they
have suffered harm as a result of the administration,’”? and hence no compensation is

owing.

The Respondent argues that the Fair Links Report inflates the value of Future Bank, but
that such inflation should be rejected because “no willing buyer would have paid more
than the asset-based valuation of Future Bank given that its profits arose from violations
of Bahraini law and international sanctions” and the comparable banks used by Fair Links

are not accurate comparisons for Future Bank.’°°

For the Respondent, any damages awarded to the Claimants must account for the
proceeds the Claimants would receive upon liquidation, which would deduct the
Claimants debt to Future Bank. If the debt is not taken into account, the Claimants would
end up being “unjustly enrich[ed]”.”*!

The Respondent further contends that the Claimants’ debt “currently exceeds any
reasonable valuation of their shares”, meaning that the Respondent is asked “to
compensate [the Claimants] for money they already have”.’** According to the

Respondent, the Claimants owe Future Bank BHD 136.3 million,”®? which exceeds even

the highest income-based valuation quantified by Fair Links at BHD 128.5 million,

without interest.”*4

The Respondent emphasizes that its expert favours an asset-based valuation, being “more
appropriate given the circumstances of this case”.’** It also notes and that the asset-based
value is higher now than on the date of the CBB Decision, with the consequence that the

Claimants have incurred no loss.”°°

The Respondent disputes that Future Bank was a profitable entity that must be valued by
a method other than the asset-based approach. Referring to the Davies Report, the
Respondent argues that Future Bank’s “core business segment leveraged and profited
from the existence of sanctions”.’*” As such, no buyer would purchase a bank that relies
on its business with sanctioned entities. The Respondent further denies that a buyer would
look no further than Future Bank’s financial statements.7**

Furthermore, the contention that Future Bank would have expanded its business
following the JCPOA, thus warranting an alternative method of valuation, is “premised
upon two layers of speculation, first that a hypothetical buyer would have assumed at the
date of the administration that the JCPOA would come into existence, and that Future
Bank’s profits would increase thereafter”.”°°

The Respondent draws attention to the protection of a decrease in Future Bank’s profits
in late 2014. As Mr. Davies notes, that projection shows that Future Bank perceived “the
lifting of sanctions as a threat not an opportunity”.’”° Therefore, the Claimants’ assertion

that a buyer would have been willing to pay more than the asset value is unsustainable.’”!

The Davies Report sets the fair market value of the Claimants’ shares at BD 96.2 million
on the date of administration in the but-for scenario and at BD 109.7 million as at
December 31, 2019, in the actual scenario.’* The latter exceeding the former, the
Respondent submits that the Claimants have suffered no loss, with the consequence that

no compensation is due.

2. Moral Damages

The Respondent asserts that “any damage to the Claimants’ reputation flows only from
their own conduct” and that it “was impossible to blacken the reputation of two banks
that have been specifically identified by the UN Security Council for their role in
financing terrorism and nuclear proliferation”.””? Hence, whatever damage was inflicted

to the Claimants’ reputation cannot be attributed to the Respondent.

The Respondent also notes that Fair Links does not opine on the Claimants’ request for

moral damages.’*

C. ANALYSIS

As a preliminary matter, the Tribunal notes that the Claimants withdrew their request for

restitution at the Hearing in the following terms:

We are in an advanced stage of the liquidation. We have your provisional
measures. There is obviously no intention of Bahrain to see any Iranian
investors, let alone us. So we have to ask now, amend our relief sought, to
only ask for compensation whereas we were asking for restitution and
damages up to restitution. So we’re only asking now for material damages. °°
Hence, the Tribunal will now move on to consider the request for monetary

compensation.

1. Standard of Compensation

The Claimants submit that the BIT sets a standard of compensation for lawful

expropriation, namely the fair market value, but does not specify or limit, the standard of

compensation applicable in case of an unlawful expropriation or of other breaches under
the BIT.” They thus argue that compensation must be determined in accordance with
the general principles of international law, namely full reparation based on the
investment’s fair market value.’ The Respondent does not dispute this standard of

compensation.

The Tribunal recalls that it is a basic principle of international law that States incur
responsibility for their internationally wrongful acts.’°* The corollary to this principle is
that the responsible State must repair the damage caused by its internationally wrongful
act. As stated in Article 31 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, “[t]he responsible
State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by the

internationally wrongful act”.”?

The principle of full reparation was first set forth by the PCIJ in the often-quoted
Chorzéw Factory case, which held that “reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all
the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all
probability, have existed if that act had not been committed”.* “Full” reparation must
therefore eliminate all consequences of the internationally illicit act and restore the

injured party to the situation that would have existed if the act had not been committed.

In this respect, ILC Article 36(1) provides that “[t]he State responsible for an
internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to compensate for the damage caused
thereby, insofar as such damage is not made good by restitution”.®°! Article 31(2)

specifies that a compensable injury includes “any damage, whether material or moral,

“compensation shall cover any financially assessable damage, including loss of profits

insofar as it is established”. °°

While they were drawn up for interstate disputes, these general principles of international
law are routinely applied by analogy in investor-state arbitration such as the present one.
The BIT is silent on the standard of compensation for internationally wrongful acts.
Article 6(2) of the BIT only sets out the standard of compensation for lawful
expropriations (“the value of the investment immediately before the action of
nationalization, confiscation or expropriation was taken”). The standard governing
compensation for unlawful expropriations is thus subject to customary international law,
specifically to the principle of full reparation as articulated by the PCIJ in the Chorzéw

Factory case and later expressed in the ILC Articles.

The Tribunal notes that both Parties’ valuations rely on Future Bank’s fair market value
at the time of the expropriation. In the Tribunal’s view, this approach is consistent with
the full reparation principle, insofar as it eliminates all consequences of the Respondent’s
breaches of the BIT and restores the Claimants to the situation in which they would have

been had the Respondent not breached the BIT.

2. The Existence of a Loss and the Claimant’s Actual Scenario

The Respondent disputes that the Claimants have incurred a loss, noting that the value of
their shares in Future Bank is higher than on the date when the bank was put in
administration.* It further submits that the damage computation must factor in the
Claimants’ liquidation proceeds and their outstanding debts to Future Bank, the result
being that the Claimants have suffered no harm and that an award granting compensation

would result in unjust enrichment.*°5

The Claimants oppose these arguments.*°° For them, the current value of their equity is

irrelevant. In the same vein, the Claimants’ expert expresses the view that “no value may

be ascribed to the Actual Scenario and suggesting otherwise is wrong from an economic
standpoint”. He recognizes, however, that “[s]hould a compensation be received in the
foreseeable future by BMI and BSI, it would of course have to come in deduction of the

amount determined in the But-For Scenario”.°””

The Tribunal has held above that the Claimants’ investment in Future Bank had been
expropriated and the expropriation was unlawful. Specifically, the Respondent’s
measures deprived the Claimants of the use and control of their shares and neutralized

any economic benefit flowing from their property interest in Future Bank.

As was already stated earlier, compensation is intended to wipe out the material
consequences of the unlawful act by restoring the investor to the position in which it
would have been had the expropriation not occurred. The damage inflicted by the
unlawful conduct is thus equal to the difference between (i) the Claimants’ economic
position but-for the wrongful measures (but-for scenario) and (ii) their actual economic

position (actual scenario).

In assessing whether the Claimants have suffered a loss, the Tribunal cannot merely
compare the value of the Claimants’ shares at the time of the expropriation and on the
date of the present award. Such a comparison would ignore the de facto economic
position of the Claimants, who were permanently deprived of the possibility to exercise
essential attributes of their interest in Future Bank. They have been deprived of the
control and benefits deriving from their shares in Future Bank and such deprivation has
become permanent, even though they retain formal ownership of their shares. In other
words, the Respondent’s measures amounted to an indirect expropriation of the shares,

which was unlawful.

Indirect expropriation typically occurs when the expropriated party is deprived of the
control and benefits of its investment but retains a formal title over the assets in question.
Investment tribunals have consistently awarded the fair market value of expropriated
investments in cases of indirect expropriations, without accounting for the actual value

of a nominal title that a claimant investor retains over the expropriated asset.

This being so, the Tribunal takes note of the Respondent’s representation that the
Claimants are entitled to the liquidation proceeds of Future Bank. The question is thus
whether the possibility of the Claimants recovering liquidation proceeds should lead the
Tribunal to alter or condition the amounted awarded through this award in reparation of

the unlawful expropriation.

In circumstances where the Claimants have not received liquidation proceeds for over
six years, the prospect of recovery remains highly uncertain. This uncertainty is
exacerbated by the fact that the Respondent has not provided any detailed information on
the progress of the liquidation proceedings. Nor has it explained whether the liquidation
proceeds would amount to the fair market value of the Claimants’ shares or whether there

would be reductions, e.g., on account of alleged illegalities committed by the Claimants.

Even if there is substantial uncertainty, one cannot rule out that the Respondent may pay
liquidation proceeds to the Claimants. Such a payment may carry with it a risk of (partial)
double recovery if the Claimants collect the liquidation proceeds and recover the amount
awarded in this arbitration. The position in terms of double recovery will vary depending

on the chronology of these collections.

If the Claimants collect under this Award before liquidation proceeds are paid out, the
Tribunal considers that it would be up to the competent Bahraini authorities to consider

the amounts at issue and avoid the materialization of the risk of double recovery.

If, by contrast, the Claimants receive liquidation proceeds before they collect on the
Award, then the Tribunal sees no reason why the liquidation payment could not come in
deduction of the amount of damages owed hereunder. In this context, it recalls the
statement of the Claimants’ damages expert, which it understands to be made on behalf
of the Claimants, that “[a]ssuming Claimants were to receive a compensation from the
winding down of Future Bank, we agree that it should be deducted from the Fair Market

Value of the Expropriated Asset in the assessment of the damage value”.*°*

Accordingly, the Tribunal takes due notice of the Claimants’ undertaking not to seek
double recovery and to deduct any amount of liquidation proceeds received from

damages owing under this Award.

The consistent practice of international tribunals is that they do their best to avoid double
recovery. In doing so, they often rely on undertakings of claimants not to seek double
recovery, and where proceedings are pending in national courts, those courts can be relied

upon to avoid double recovery.*”?

Hence, the Tribunal will calculate the damages due to the Claimants without discounting
the alleged current value of their shares in Future Bank or the uncertain amount that the
Claimants may receive at the end of the liquidation proceedings of Future Bank. This
being so, the Tribunal takes note of the statement made by the Claimants’ expert that the
Claimants will not seek double recovery and will thus deduct proceeds collected from

the liquidation of Future Bank from damages owing to them under this Award.

3. Valuation Methods and Calculation of the Fair Market Value

The Tribunal notes that both Parties agree that an asset-based approach is an acceptable
method to compute the FMV of the Claimants’ shares in Future Bank and arrive at similar
valuations under that approach. The Claimants’ expert estimates the book/asset value of
the Claimants’ shares in Future Bank at USD 243 million as of April 30, 2015,8!° which
is equivalent to BHD 91,368,000.*!! In turn, the Respondent’s expert assesses the asset-
based value of the Claimants’ shares in the bank as of the same date at

BHD 96,195,000.5!

The Claimants’ expert opines, however, that the asset-based approach fails to “capture

the value of the future profits that would have been generated by Future Bank but for its

expropriation”.*!? Instead, the Claimants propose to use the income-based approach.
They submit that this method is the most suitable in the light of Future Bank’s proven
track record of profitability, and the certainty that it would continue to generate the same
or greater levels of profit, particularly in the light of the JCPOA. Pursuant to this
methodology, the Claimants consider that the minimum value to which they are entitled

is “comprised between EUR 300.9 million and EUR 271.7 million”.

In the alternative, the Claimants seek the fair market value of their investment based on
a market approach, i.e., based on the “value of comparable assets sold in the open market
[...], which accordingly factored in future profits of Future Bank, but failed to take into
account the particularly favorable circumstances and outlook existing at the time of the

taking”.

The Respondent’s damages expert accepts that the income-based and the market-based
methods are generally appropriate methods to value banks.*!4 His opinion, however, is
that these approaches are not appropriate in the present circumstances, notably because
“a hypothetical purchaser would not have paid any more than the Asset-Based valuation
for the Claimants’ shares at the Administration Date”. He further opines that “[t]o justify
a premium to this amount, a hypothetical purchaser would have to assume that Future
Bank could continue to generate the same or greater profits under its future stewardship
than it had done previously”.*'> Yet, according to the Respondent’s expert, a hypothetical
purchaser would not make such an assumption due to the dependence of Future Bank’s
business model on its relationship with the Claimants and due to doubts about the
legitimacy of Future Bank’s historical profits.*!° The Respondent’s expert therefore
concludes that the only available valuation method in the case at hand is an asset-based

one.*!7

The Tribunal notes that, generally, the income-based approach is considered to best
reflect the fair market value of a going concern with a proven record of profitability.®!*
In the words of the tribunal in Quiborax v. Bolivia, “the DCF method [i.e., an income
base approach] is widely accepted as the appropriate method to assess the FMV of going

concerns with a proven record of profitability”.*!”

It is undisputed that, at the time of its administration, Future Bank was a going concern
with a proven record of profitability.8°° That said, the income-based valuation
presupposes that Future Bank would have continued to be equally or, according to the
Claimants’ expert, more profitable, had Bahrain not put the bank under administration
and liquidation. On the facts of this dispute, this assumption is speculative for the

following main reasons:

First, as reviewed in the section on the preliminary objections above, Future Bank
engaged in some violations of applicable laws and regulations, including by dealing with
sanctioned entities and by failing to adopt required due diligence practices. While the
evidence of such violations is insufficient to warrant the inadmissibility of the claims,
they must be taken into account when assessing the fair market value of the Claimants’
investment. A hypothetical buyer of the Claimants’ shares in Future Bank would have
discovered the irregularities and would have factored into the price a discount for the risk
of increased regulatory intervention, impacting the prospects of the future profitability of

the bank.

While the income-based valuation of the Claimants’ investment may account for ordinary
equity risk that Future Bank’s business entailed, it does not consider increased regulatory
risk. Selecting the correct level of such increased risk would involve a random or

speculative choice, as it would entail assessing the likelihood of the Respondent’s fair

regulatory conduct and its economic impact on the bank’s business. The Amco I/ tribunal,
stressed the inherently speculative nature of such an exercise:
The Tribunal cannot pronounce upon what a ‘fair [Respondent]’ would have
done. This is both speculative and not the issue before it. Rather, it is required

to characterize the acts that [the Respondent] did engage in and to see if those
acts, if unlawful, caused damage to [the Claimant].*?!

By contrast, not to account for such risks would result in the Claimants receiving
compensation on the assumption that they would be allowed to freely continue unlawful
activities and generate profits without regulatory intervention. That assumption is too
uncertain or not sufficiently plausible to provide a reliable basis for an assessment of

damages.

It is true that, as of Future Bank’s placement into administration, the sanctions against
Iran were expected to be gradually lifted following the conclusion of the JCPOA.*?
However, on the date of valuation, this evolution was only an expectation. More
importantly, even if the expectation was sufficiently plausible, the lifting of the sanctions
would not have entirely removed the regulatory risk, as the illegalities were not
exclusively related to the sanctions. In any event, the bank’s business plan drawn up in
the lifting of the Iran sanctions would in fact “substantially reduce” the return on average
assets (“ROAA”):
ROAA: Relatively higher mainly because of higher level of interest margins

in respect of Placements with Banks. Once sanctions against Iranian Banks
are lifted, these high margins will substantially be reduced.5*

The Claimants’ witness Mr. Hemmati corroborated this projection at the hearing,
explaining his contemporaneous position that the lifting of the sanctions would affect the
viability of the bank’s three-year business plan for 2015-2017 in 2014.84 Thus, the
conclusion of the JCPOA did not dispel the uncertainty associated with the bank’s future

profitability due to its unlawful conduct. Instead, as the bank itself perceived, the lifting

of the sanctions added to such uncertainty, which is an additional factor militating against

an income-based valuation.

Second, it is uncontroversial that Future Bank’s business model was primarily based on
its dealings with Iranian entities. As mentioned above, while the bank’s Iranian exposure
fluctuated over the years, it remained consistently high, and at the time of the impugned
measures amounted to approximately BHD 329 million. A large part of the exposure
arose out of the bank’s dealings with the Claimants, which amounted to approximately
30% of the bank’s total assets.*”° The following table extracted from Mr. Davies’s
Second Expert Report summarizes the role played by Iranian banks, and particularly the
Claimants, in Future Bank’s income in the years prior to the expropriation.*?” Indeed,

Future Bank’s business with Iranian banks generated 50% or more of the bank’s income:

Calculating the value of Future Bank’s shares with the income-based methodology
assumes that the bank would have continued its activities based on the existing business
model, which heavily relied on the bank’s exposure to Iran, and more specifically to its
existing shareholders. Yet, as described above, Future Bank was facing increased
pressure from the CBB to reduce its exposure to its shareholders and more generally to
Tran. On April 1, 2014, the CBB directed Future Bank to “immediately reduce its
exposure limits to its shareholders, BSI and BMI and bring such limits down to the

outstanding balances as of end of December 2013, while not undertaking any new

Balance sheet attached to letter from Future Bank to the CBB regarding Iran Exposure as on March 31,
2015, April 16, 2015 (C-160).

exposure to these shareholders. Further, it should initiate measures to bring down such

exposures to nil”.°?5

It is unlikely that a hypothetical buyer of the shares of Future Bank in April 2015 would
have ignored this context and its potential impact on Future Bank, and thus valued the
bank assuming that it would continue earning profits based on its historical business
model, irrespective of the fact that it conflicted in some cases with the regulator’s explicit
instructions. A buyer would likely consider that the existing record of profitability, which
chiefly derived from Iranian exposure was too speculative to project into the future, and

would instead rely on the book value of the bank’s existing assets.

These considerations also affect the market-based valuation. As the Claimants’ expert
admits, “[a] limitation of the Market-Based Approach is that it does not allow the
incorporation of specific assumptions in the analysis”.*?? Indeed, none of the suggested
market comparators considers the unique situation in which Future Bank found itself
before the expropriation. In particular, the bank’s violations of the applicable regulations,
its heavy exposure to Iranian entities and its shareholders, and the uncertainties created
by the announcement of the JCPOA are not captured by the Claimants’ market based
valuation. This is, in particular, clear from paragraph 92 of the First Report of the
Claimants’ expert, which lists the factors that the expert took into account in selecting
the market comparators.**? None of these factors consider the circumstances just referred

to which were unique to Future Bank.

For its part, the asset-based valuation rules leave out or at least minimizes the risk of
compensating the Claimants for their violations of applicable regulations. In this respect,
the Tribunal notes that the Respondent has not established that any of the specific assets
of Future Bank had been acquired as a result of unlawful activities. Thus, by awarding
compensation based on an asset-based valuation, the Tribunal does not allow the
Claimants to benefit from any wrongful conduct. Nor does the asset-based valuation

assume that Future Bank would continue its operations according to the Iran-exposed

business model with which the regulator had taken issue. For these reasons, the Tribunal

will compute damages based on an asset-based valuation methodology.

The Claimants’ expert calculates the asset-based value of the Claimants’ shares in Future
Bank as of April 30, 2015 at USD 243 million,®*! which converts to BHD 91,368,000.8°2
In turn, the Respondent’s expert assesses the asset-based value of the Claimants’ shares
in the bank as of the same date at BHD 96,195,000.*** Given that the valuation of the
Respondent’s expert is higher than that of the Claimants’, the Tribunal will adopt the
amount put forward by the Claimant’s expert, and therefore sets the fair market value of
the Claimants’ shares in Future Bank as of the date of the expropriation at BHD
91,368,000.

4. The Respondent’s Request for a Set-Off and the Impact of the Amount
Due by the Claimants to Future Bank

The Respondent submits that the Claimants’ current debt to Future Bank amounts to
BHD 136.3 million and therefore exceeds any reasonable valuation of the Claimants’
shares in Future Bank.** In the same vein, the Respondent’s expert on damages
expresses the opinion that “[t]he current value of Future Bank is inextricably linked to
the recovery of the BHD 136.3 million currently owing from the Claimants. Similarly,
the value of Future Bank on the Administration Date was inextricably linked to the large

amounts the Claimants owed at that time”.**°

The Respondent thus requests the Tribunal to “deduct the Claimants’ debt” from the

amount awarded to the Claimants.*° The Respondent relies on the risks of

overcompensation or unjust enrichment**’ and on the principle that “any award by the

Tribunal must reflect the economic realities between the parties as they exist today”.***

The Claimants oppose the Respondent’s request, arguing that “there is no counterclaim
possible under the BIT for there to be a set-off nor is there a set-off possible under this
procedure because they are different operations and different contracts and different
parties. [...] Here we have an investment case against the government of Bahrain based
on the BIT. So at most there is an enforcement issue, but this is not for your Tribunal to
consider because different parties in different relationships, that is irrelevant for the

purposes of BIT”.

The Respondent’s request can be understood in two ways. It may be regarded as a request
that the Tribunal take into account the Claimants’ debt to Future Bank in assessing the
fair market value of their shares in the bank as of the date of the expropriation.
Alternatively, the Respondent may be requesting a set-off of the Claimants’ debt towards
Future Bank against the amount due by the Respondent to the Claimants as a result of its

breach of the BIT.

If the Respondent’s argument is that the Claimants’ debt reduces the value of Future
Bank as of the date of the expropriation, the Tribunal considers that the argument lacks
merit. Future Bank was the creditor of the Claimants’ debt, and thus the debt constituted
an asset for the bank. Indeed, banks’ assets usually consist of loans. While the Tribunal
took into account Future Bank’s shareholder exposure when selecting the valuation
method, it is not obvious why the bank’s book value should be reduced due to the fact

that it had granted a loan to its shareholders.

The Respondent has neither argued nor presented any evidence that would suggest that
Future Bank would not be able to recover the loan from the Claimants, e.g., because of a
risk of insolvency. Instead, as described above, the Respondent’s expert calculated the

book value of the bank at a figure higher than the valuation of the Claimants’ expert.*#°

Award
Page 218 of 235

Therefore, the Tribunal considers that the book value of Future Bank need not be reduced
due to the fact that the loan Future Bank had granted to its shareholders constituted one

of the key assets of the bank.

Alternatively, the Respondent’s request may be to the effect that the amount owed by the
Claimants to Future Bank be set off against the compensation that the Respondent owes
to the Claimants for the breach of the BIT. In this scenario, the Tribunal reaches the

conclusion that it cannot order such set-off for the following main reasons.

First, pursuant to Article 19 of the UNCITRAL Rules of 1976 applicable in the present
case, “the respondent may make a counter-claim arising out of the same contract or rely

on a claim arising out of the same contract for the purpose of a set-off”.

As is clear from this article, an arbitral tribunal established under these rules has no
jurisdiction over a set-off claim (or defence) if it does not arise out of the contract
containing the arbitration agreement, or transposed into an investment treaty context, out
of the BIT. In the case at hand, the Claimants’ current debt towards Future Bank arises
from contractual relationships between the Claimants and Future Bank, nor between the
Claimants and the Respondent. It follows that the Respondent’s claim for a set-off (or
set-off defence) cannot be brought before this Tribunal pursuant to the applicable

arbitration rules.

Second, pursuant to Article 11 of the BIT, the Tribunal has jurisdiction over “dispute[s]
aris[ing] between the host Contracting Party and investor(s) of the other Contracting
Party with respect to an investment”. The recovery of debt contracted by the Claimants
vis-a-vis Future Bank is a matter of contract not involving the Respondent. Hence, it
cannot be seen as a “dispute aris[ing] between the host Contracting Party and an investor
of the other Contracting Party”. Again, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over a claim for

recovery of amounts, which the Claimants owe to Future Bank.

Third, even assuming the Tribunal had jurisdiction over the set-off (quod non) critical
questions remain: What law governs? What are the requirements for set-off? Are these
met here? Yet, neither Party has addressed these questions. The Respondent has made no

submissions on these issues.

Page 219 of 235

Similar considerations led the tribunal in Micula v. Romania to conclude that it was “not

in a position to declare that [the Respondent] ha[d] a right to set-off”:

[W]hether the Respondent has a right to set off the Award against the EFDG’s
tax debts would be (primarily at least) a matter of Romanian law and of
enforcement of this Award. Romanian law establishes the conditions under
which a set-off may be carried out and nothing the Tribunal says will affect
that. In certain jurisdictions, set-off may even operate as a matter of law (ipso
iure) when strict conditions are met. Thus, as a matter of principle, the
Tribunal is not in a position to declare that Romania has a right to set-off the
amounts awarded in this arbitration against the EFDG’s tax debts. Whether
Romania has a right to set-off the amounts awarded against the Claimants or
other companies of the EFDG will depend on whether the conditions set out
in Romania law are fulfilled.

Even if the Tribunal were to state that, in principle, Romania has a right to
set-off, it would not be able to decide whether in this particular case such set-
off is warranted. The Respondent has not explained why the (Romanian law)
conditions for set-off are fulfilled in this case, what are the amounts to be set
off, or which are the specific parties involved. **!

In these circumstances, the Tribunal dismisses the Respondent’s set-off request.

The Tribunal notes that the Respondent further argues in this context that there is a risk
of “overcompensation” or “unjust enrichment”. That argument rests on the assumption
that the amounts due by the Claimants to Future Bank would not be recovered. Yet, as
mentioned already, the Respondent has offered no evidence or other indications
substantiating this assumption. On the contrary, the Claimants’ experts have alleged that
they understand from the Claimants’ counsel that “the recovery of those debts by Future
Bank has not occurred yet and [...] Claimants are not responsible for any delay in the

recovery”.*? This statement was not contradicted by the Respondent.

In these circumstances, the Tribunal finds no basis to assume that the amounts due by the
Claimants to Future Bank would not be recovered. In the hypothetical case where they
would not be, the proper recourse would be for Future Bank to exercise its contract
remedies and bring an action in the competent court. If it prevails, it could then enforce

the judgment against the judgment debtors.

Page 220 of 235

For all the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal dismisses the Respondent’s request for a set-

off.

Conversely, the Tribunal notes that, in a letter of July 28, 2020, the Claimants requested
that “any monetary relief awarded by the Tribunal be accompanied by language expressly
setting out that such monetary relief shall not be capable of set off against any other
amounts allegedly owed by Future Bank, Claimants, or their respective representatives,
in the context of other actions initiated by Bahrain”. The Tribunal considers that this
request lacks substantiation. Without any indication on the “amounts allegedly owed”
referred to and any legal submission, the Tribunal cannot but deny the request to give a

blanket declaration against a possible set off of alleged liabilities.

5. Moral Damages

In addition to material damages, the Claimants request moral or reputational damages. ***
They submit that their professional reputation has been significantly damaged, notably
since the Respondent has “leak[ed] its sensational claims raised for the first time in this
arbitration to medias as widely published as the Washington Post, moreover in the
context of the current administration in the US”.8“4 Hence, the Claimants seek relief for
moral damages suffered as a result of the Respondent’s breaches in an amount of

EUR 10 million.§4

The Respondent argues that the Claimants’ request is “wholly unfounded, as any damage
to the Claimants’ reputation flows only from their own conduct as longstanding and

notorious participants in sanctions evasion and financial crime”.*4° The Respondent

further stresses that the claim “is unsupported by any evidence whatsoever”.*#”

As correctly held by the Pey Casado tribunal, “a claim to damages of a moral character
does not escape the burden of proof resting on a claimant”.*“* The claimant must thus
prove the existence of a reputational damage and the causal link between the

Respondent’s breaches of the BIT and such damage.

The Respondent disputes the existence of a damage to reputation.*” Having reviewed
the record, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants have failed to offer evidence, let alone

establish, the existence of such a damage.

In these circumstances, without having reviewed whether and under which circumstances
moral damages might be justified, the Tribunal dismisses the Claimants’ claim for moral

damages.

6. Pre-Award Interest

It is undisputed that the Claimants are entitled to pre-award interest from the valuation

date, i.e., April 30, 2015, to the issue of the present Award.

Pursuant to Article 38 of the ILC Articles, interest for late payment is part of the “full
reparation” standard.**° As correctly summarized by the tribunal in Vivendi v. Argentina,
“[t]he object of an award of interest is to compensate the damage resulting from the fact

that, during the period of non-payment by the debtor, the creditor is deprived of the use

and disposition of that sum he was supposed to receive”.*°!

The Parties disagree, however, on the appropriate interest rate. The Claimants’ expert
submits that Future Bank’s WACC should be used since it “would reflect the loss of

business opportunities suffered by Claimants when they were not in a position to develop

application of the WACC “would reflect the loss of business opportunities suffered by
the Claimants when they were not in a position to develop Future Bank’s activity,

following the expropriation”.*°?

The Tribunal considers that the Claimants are entitled to interest from the valuation date,

i.e., April 30, 2015, until payment in full. The award of interest must compensate for the

 

time value of money. By contrast, it would be economically unjustified if the interest
would also compensate for business risks associated with the investment for a period
during which the Claimants did not bear these risks anymore because they had lost

control of the investment.

In this respect, the Tribunal agrees with the Burlington tribunal, which noted that the
WACC “contains an element of cost of capital that allows cash flows to reflect the time
value of money, but it also includes a reward for all the risks involved in doing
business”.**4 In fact, the Claimants’ expert concedes that the WACC includes an element
of “business risk that is incurred”.®°> Thus, the Tribunal finds that it would be
inappropriate to apply Future Bank’s WACC as interest rate and that instead a risk-free
interest rate should be applied. The Tribunal thus dismisses the claim for the loss of

business opportunities. Instead, it will award interest on a risk-free basis.

Both Parties’ damages experts have proposed a risk-free rate based on the average return
on U.S. Treasury bonds.*°° They disagree, however, on the relevant duration of the U.S.
Treasury bonds. The Claimants’ damages expert would select the average return on 10-
year bonds (amounting to 2.1% per year),*°’ whereas the Respondent expert favours the

average return on 5-years bonds (amounting to 1.9% per year),®°* since “it is logical to

match (within the constraints of available information) the duration of the bond being

used as a proxy with the duration of the interest period”.**?

The Tribunal agrees with the latter view. Since the time between the valuation date and
the issue of the present Award is closer to 5 than to 10 years, the Tribunal finds it
appropriate to apply a pre-award interest rate calculated on the basis of the average return
on a 5-year risk-free investment. The Tribunal will thus apply, as a pre-award interest

rate, the return on 5-year U.S. Treasury bonds.

The Parties and their experts have not addressed whether interest at the U.S. Treasury
bond rate should be compounded. While the Claimants have asked that interest be
compounded when computed at Libor +2%, they have not done so with respect to the
U.S. Treasury bond rate. Nor have they indicated at what frequency it would be
appropriate to compound interest at such rate, if at all. Therefore, the Tribunal will award

simple interest.

Finally, the Tribunal notes that both experts have discussed the possibility of computing
interest at U.S. Treasury bond rates although the claims were denominated in Euros.
Hence, the Tribunal is satisfied that it is inappropriate in the circumstances to apply a

U.S. Treasury bond rate to an award in a currency other than U.S. dollars.

7. Post-Award Interest

The Claimants also request post-award interest. The Respondent does not specifically
oppose such request. It is thus undisputed that the Claimants have a right to post-award

interest.

The Claimants propose a rate of Libor + 2%, compounded semi-annually, on any amount
awarded to them, including arbitration costs, as of the date “these amounts are determined
to have been due to Claimants”, until the date of payment.*® They further request that

post-award interest be compounded semi-annually.

The Claimants do not explain the applicability of Libor, which is an interbank borrowing

rate in the post-award context. The Tribunal sees no reason to award post-award interest

First ER Davies (RER-2), | 6.2.6.
Reply, 782.

PCA Case No. 2017-25

Award

Page 224 of 235

at a rate different from the pre-award interest. As described above, by putting Future
Bank into administration in April, 2015, the Respondent unlawfully expropriated the
Claimants’ shareholding interest. The Respondent’s obligation to provide reparation
arose at that time of the commission of this wrongful act. Thus, insofar as the Respondent
has not paid the compensation for its wrongful conduct, the Claimants’ economic
position remains unchanged. The Tribunal will therefore award post-award interest at the

same rate as pre-award interest.

1

Respondent should bear all costs in the arbitration,**! including the costs of the

2

Claimants’ legal representation and assistance,*°? namely in the amount of

EUR 4,976,060.79 and GBP 95,000.°°? According to the Claimants, the Respondent’s
Submission on Costs “confirm[s] the reasonableness of Claimants’ Cost Submission”.°

As regards counsel fees, the Claimants explain that they agreed to pay counsel a lump
sum of EUR 1,000,000 plus 1.75% of all amounts awarded. In this context, they refer to
Lahoud v DRC in which the costs award covered all legal fees, including an agreed
percentage on amounts awarded.*® This being so, the Claimants say that they do not seek
payment of the lump sum and success fee, but instead request compensation for the
number of hours spent by their legal team, comprising one partner, six associates, and

one paralegal. The fees for these hours amount to EUR 3,726,000.

In the alternative, the Claimants request that the Respondent pay legal fees in the amount
of EUR 1,200,000, which would reflect the sum effectively paid or to be paid on the date
of the Claimants’ Costs Claims Update.**? The Claimants add that they take this
alternative position “out of abundance of caution, and in fact reluctantly, as it would
enable Respondent to avoid making Claimants whole for the fees they would ultimately
have to pay Counsel, and reward Respondent by way of a cost award that would not even

accurately reflect the Counsel time actually spent on the case”.5%

In support of their costs application, the Claimants submit that, pursuant to Article 42 of
the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal has discretion to make a costs order against the
Respondent for the entirety of the arbitration costs.* They also refer to conduct of the

Respondent that prolonged the duration of the proceedings and increased costs:

a. The time taken up for the appointment of the Tribunal, triggering the

Claimants’ request that the PCA act as appointing authority;

b. The fact that the Respondent did not provide any reasons for the CBB
Decision and the measures taken against Future Bank prior to the SoD, that

is, three years after the measures;
c. The leaking of the proceedings to the Washington Post;
d. The Respondent’s unsuccessful application for security for costs;

e. The conclusion of the confidentiality agreement; and

f. The late production of voluminous documents.”

813. For the Claimants, by contrast to their own costs, the Respondent’s costs claim of
USD 12,915,511.69 is “abnormally high” for an arbitration such as this one.87! In
particular, the Claimants point out that the Respondent’s “costs of investigating and
documenting the Claimants’ [alleged] unlawful conduct throughout their investment in
Future Bank” and “professional legal fees” are not arbitration-related defense costs, but
represent costs for last-minute investigations to build a post hoc case to justify the taking

and for the co-ordination with local or other parallel actions.*””

814. Similarly, so say the Claimants, the fees of the Alvarez & Marsal regulatory and quantum
experts are unreasonable and unrelated to this arbitration as they remunerated services
for the preparation of the 2018 CBB Report and post factum defences, and do not

represent bona fide defence costs.*”?

815. The Claimants further assert that the fees for the Deloitte forensic accountants and the

DLA Piper/Alix Partners data analysts cannot be claimed because these firms did not

and purpose of their work are not known.°”*

Finally, the Claimants reject the Respondent’s extraordinary costs claim related to the
document production exercise. They recall that the Respondent’s production was “wholly
defective”, failing to produce any document in 15 out of 18 document categories.*”> As
to the costs of maintaining and producing Future Bank’s documents, the Claimants
underline that these documents were effectively their own and should not have been

removed from their control in the first place.*”°

B. THE RESPONDENT’S POSITION

The Respondent requests that the Tribunal award it the entirety of the costs it incurred in
this arbitration.*”’ These costs reflect its efforts defending against the Claimants’
meritless claims and are “reasonable and commensurate with the nature of this case”.
With respect to the costs incurred in connection with the Re-hearing, the Respondent
notes that “it required the difficult effort of recapitulating a very extensive record
15 months after the final substantive hearing, which was rendered all the more arduous
given the requirements of (i) extreme compression due to the limited time for oral
presentations by counsel, and (ii) the need for counsel to prepare comprehensively in

order to answer any questions that might come from the Tribunal”.°”?

“costs of arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party” and highlights

the Tribunal’s “broad discretion” in awarding costs.**!

Although it expects to recover its costs as the prevailing Party, the Respondent submits
that the Tribunal may exercise its discretion in allocating costs by taking into
consideration the differences in the Parties’ costs attributable to (i) the work associated
with exposing the Claimants’ wrongdoing; (ii) the number of witnesses; and (iii) “the

(gross) disparity” in the Parties’ production of evidence.**?

Specifically, the Respondent notes that it has incurred the additional costs of
“investigating and documenting the Claimants’ unlawful conduct through their
investment in Future Bank”,’8? which required “monumental effort for Bahrain to
organize, preserve, and analyze Future Bank’s files”.*** The Respondent also highlights
“the evident disparity in the scope, rigors, and seriousness” its expert evidence and the
additional expert fees incurred for hiring forensic accountants and data analysts from

Deloitte, DLA Piper, and Alix Partners to reveal the Claimants’ unlawful conduct.885

proceedings and increased costs on six occasions. **® For the Respondent, these alleged
“agegravations” are largely attributable to the Claimants and thus provide further reasons

that it be awarded costs:

The Claimants increased costs by objecting to the Respondent’s choice of
arbitrator. In particular, the Claimants challenged Lord Collins, arguing that
he was a “hired-gun” because, inter alia, he had recused himself from
unrelated cases involving the Government of Iran. Yet, Lord Collins was
appointed by the PCA Secretary-General two days later after having

confirmed his impartiality in the usual way.

The CBB provided reasons for the measures when it took them. The
Claimants failed to challenge these measures in local courts. Thus, the SoD

was the Respondent’s first opportunity to defend its regulatory measures.

The Tribunal already rejected the Claimants’ complaint about the

Washington Post article;

The Respondent’s applications for security for costs and for an interim award
of costs were justified, whereas the Claimants’ application for interim

measures was a “pure waste”;

The conclusion of the confidentiality agreement was not insisted upon by the

Respondent but ordered by the Tribunal; and

C. ANALYSIS

The relevant provisions of the 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules on costs read as

follows:

Article 38

The arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in its award. The term
"costs" includes only:

(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator
and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 39;

(b) The travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;

(c) The costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral
tribunal;

(d) The travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses are
approved by the arbitral tribunal;

(e) The costs for legal representation and assistance of the successful party if
such costs were claimed during the arbitral proceedings, and only to the extent
that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is
reasonable;

(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the expenses
of the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague.

Article 40

1. Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in principle
be borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may
apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that
apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the
case.

2. With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to
in article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the
circumstances of the case, shall be free to determine which party shall bear
such costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if it determines
that apportionment is reasonable.

It is common ground between the Parties that the Tribunal has broad discretion in
awarding and apportioning costs. The Parties also agree that the outcome is a relevant
factor for determining the allocation. That said, as the difference in language between
paragraphs | and 2 of Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules makes clear, the Tribunal
enjoys a wider discretion with respect to the apportionment of the legal fees of the

successful party than it does for other cost categories.

The Tribunal notes that the Claimants largely prevailed on the preliminary objections, as

well as on liability and quantum. By contrast, they did not succeed with respect to their

826.

827.

828.

829.

830.

PCA Case No. 2017-25

Award

Page 231 of 235

argumentation on valuation methodology, interest rate and moral damages. The Tribunal
also held that the Claimants engaged in some irregularities during the life of their

investment in Bahrain.

In addition, the Tribunal notes that the costs of this arbitration have increased as a result
of the need to reconstitute the Tribunal on two occasions following the passing of two of
its members. These sad and unforeseen events required the re-hearing of the Parties’ oral
submissions and additional time commitment on the part of counsel and of the Tribunal.
While it is speculative to try to assess the extra costs due to the reconstitutions, the

Tribunal considers that no Party should bear these extra costs alone.

In connection with the Parties’ procedural conduct, the Tribunal observes that the Parties
and counsel conducted the proceedings in an efficient and professional manner. While
each Party made several unsuccessful applications, such as the Claimants’ request for
interim measures and the Respondent’s request for security for costs, none of these
requests appeared abusive or aimed at obstructing the proceedings. Therefore, the
Tribunal does not consider that the Parties’ procedural conduct should influence the

allocation of costs.

On the basis of the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal considers it fair and appropriate that
the Respondent reimburse the Claimants for 80% of their share of the fees and expenses
of the Arbitral Tribunal and the PCA in the amount of EUR 1,804,462.66, broken down

as follows:

The Tribunal incurred fees and expenses in the amount of EUR 1,525.018.56 as follows:
(i) Professor Gaillard incurred fees in the amount of EUR 411,075.00 and expenses in
the amount of EUR 575.00; (ii) Professor Hanotiau incurred fees in the amount of
EUR 100,485.00. He did not incur any expenses; (iii) Lord Collins of Mapesbury
incurred fees in the amount of EUR 408,661.16 and expenses in the amount of
EUR 2,253.89; (iv) Professor Dolzer incurred fees in the amount of EUR 193,210.00 and
expenses in the amount of EUR 3,106.00; (v.) Professor Kaufmann-Kohler incurred fees

in the amount of EUR 405,405.00 and expenses in the amount of EUR 247.51.

The PCA’s fees and expenses for the administration of the arbitration amount to

EUR 189,760.50 in fees and EUR 10,402.57 in expenses. Other costs, including costs of

831.

832.

833.

834.

835.

PCA Case No. 2017-25
Award
Page 232 of 235

court reporting, IT/AV support, catering, courier services, hearing venue services, office
supplies and printing, telecommunications, and banking services, amount to
EUR 79,281.03. The PCA will provide the Parties with a statement of account in due

course.

The Parties have made the following advances in respect of arbitration costs:
EUR 960,000 from the Claimants and EUR 960,000 from the Respondent, for a total of
EUR 1,920,000.

As a result, the Respondent shall pay EUR 721,785,06 to the Claimants to account for
the Tribunal’s and PCA costs. The PCA will reimburse the balance of the deposit in the
amount of EUR 115,537.34 to the Parties in equal shares of EUR 57,768.67.

Turning to the Claimants’ own costs, the Tribunal finds the claimed amount reasonable.
This finding applies to expenses and expert fees as well as legal fees. In this latter respect,
the Tribunal deems it appropriate to take into account the actual fees incurred amounting
to EUR 3,726,000 as opposed to the alternative claim of EUR 1,200,000. It can see no
reason to adopt this alternative amount, especially considering that the lump sum and
success fee agreed between the Claimants and their counsel will exceed the fees for time
effectively spent. In this context, it notes that the Claimants have not sought

reimbursement of the agreed lump sum and success fee.

It remains to be determined which percentage of the Claimants’ costs must be borne by
the Respondent. For the reasons set out in paragraphs 825 to 827 above, the Tribunal
finds it fair and appropriate in consideration of all relevant circumstances that the
Respondent bear 60% of the Claimants’ costs, i.e., EUR 2,409,636.47 and GBP 57,000.
This percentage differs from the one adopted for the Tribunal and PCA costs because, in
accordance with Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal attributed more
weight to the outcome of the case than to other factors when apportioning the Tribunal

and PCA costs.

The Tribunal also notes that the Claimants have requested post-award interest on all
amounts awarded, including costs. The Respondent has not specifically opposed this
claim. As the Tribunal reasoned above, it considers that the rate of the 5-year U.S.

Treasury bonds appropriately reflects the time value of the money that the Respondent

PCA Case No. 2017-25

ought to pay to the Claimants under the present award. Therefore, the Tribunal will award

post-award interest on costs at that rate from the date of the Award until payment in full.
