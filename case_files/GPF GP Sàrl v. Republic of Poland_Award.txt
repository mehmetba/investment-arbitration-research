b, OVERVIEW OF THE DISPUTE

8. The present dispute arises out of Poland's alleged breach of its Treaty obligations in
relation to certain indirect investments made by private equity investor Bin view
of developing a real estate project in Warsaw. The facts of the case are summarized
as follows.

4. The Perpetual Usufruct Agreement

a. Conclusion of the Perpetual Usufruct Agreement

9, In 1997, the City of Warsaw (the “City”) decided to create a perpetual usufruct right
(the “Usufruct”) over a property that it owned in a prime location in the center of
Warsaw, situated at 29 Listopada Street No. 5 (the “Property”). The detailed
description of the Property is presented in paragraphs 26-33 of this Award.

10. In 2001, the City concluded a Perpetual Usufruct Agreement (the “PUA”) with respect
to the Property with a company by the name of Artodex.* The PUA was concluded for

2 The Secretary's tasks were outlined in the Tribunal's letter to Parties of 25 March 2015.
* Agreement for the Perpetual Usufruct of the Land and Sale of Buildings dated 6 February 2001 (C-9).

a period of 99 years. The perpetual usufructuary undertook to modernize and adapt
the Property for residential and service functions, as specified in Section 9.2 of the
PUA.

The Parties do not contest that, under Polish law, an usufruct is usually granted for a
duration between 40 and 99 years,® and that the law permits the early termination of
a perpetual usufruct agreement in case of its non-performance or improper
performance, in particular, if the usufructuary did not develop the property within the
prescribed time limit.° The interpretation and application of this provision is one of the
key issues in the present case,

b. Time Limits under the Perpetual Usufruct Agreement

According to the terms of the PUA, the development of the Property was scheduled
to commence by 2002 and cease two years later.’ The construction, however, began
only in 2005.* The Parties hold different views on the reasons for the late
commencement of the works.®

The first request for extension of the deadlines was made in 2002 by Artodex, the
perpetual usufructuary at the time.1°

On 15 October 2002, in response to Artodox’ request, the City of Warsaw decided
that “[i]n the event of failure to keep to the deadlines specified [in the Perpetual
Usufruct Agi it] an iti ine shall be i and an additional

 

annual fee referred to in Article 63 of the Act on Real Estate Development shall be
determined” (the “2002 Resolution”)."’ The Parties disagree as to whether the 2002
Resolution obliges the City to extend the deadlines under any circumstances, upon
the usufructuary’s request.12

On 25 October 2002, Artodox and the City concluded an annex to the PUA (the
“Annex"). They agreed that the construction would commence in February 2004 and
end two years later, in February 2006,'*

In 2004, another company, Polmos, purchased the Usufruct from Artodex and
subsequently transferred it to a company by the name of 29 Listopada," which thus
became the new perpetual usufructuary of the Property.'®

On 6 July 2005, Listopada 29 filed a request for extension of the deadlines set by the
Annex.‘®

On 22 December 2005, the City asked whether 29 Listopada was ready to amend the
PUA and set a separate rate of yearly fees.” As no response followed, the City sent
a reminder to 29 Listopada and inquired about the status of the construction works,
in September 2006."°

29 Listopada responded in April 2007 by requesting to shift the deadline for
completion of the works to May 2009.'*

On 22 August 2007, the City reiterated its inquiry about the status of the works. The
City informed 29 Listopada that it could not extend the deadlines without
understanding the progress with the development of the Property.2°

On 11 September 2007, 29 Listopada informed the City that the works temporarily
"discontinued due to the change in the company's economic situation and the
investment plans”.*? Less than a month later, 29 Listopada asked the City to change
the use of the Property specified by the PUA and shift the deadline for completion of

By letter of 19 February 2008, 29 Listopada cancelled the requests filed in July 2005,
September and October 2007.74

In May 2009, the City asked 29 Listopada whether the latter obtained all necessary
permits to develop the Property and inquired about the renovation of the Barracks.?5

From 2009 until 2010, 29 Listopada and the City exchanged a few more letters
regarding the status of the works on the Property. The last one was sent on 4 January
2010 whereby 29 Li d d to set the ine for letion of the works
on 30 June 2011.76

On 20 December 2011, the City called for termination of the PUA, invoking, inter alia,
the failure of 29 Listopada to respect the time limits for development of the Property.?”

Overview of the Property

The Property, which forms the subject matter of the PUA, consists of two plots,
respectively 946,3 m? and 1,983 m? in size.?°

Plot No.1 accommodated a former military two-storey residential building (the
“Barracks’). Plot No. 2 held several single storey utility buildings.?*

Pursuant to Section 9.2 of the PUA, the Usufructuary was obliged to modernize and
adapt the Barracks for residual and service functions. The Respondent emphasizes
that, at all relevant times, this provision was an essential condition for concluding the

PUA.*° The evidence before the Tribunal does not indicate that the Claimant has
contested this point.2*

a. Introduction

As is well known, Warsaw was severely damaged during World War II. As a result,
nearly 85% of the historical buildings, the significance of which was compared to the
architectural heritage of Prague or Vienna at that time, were destroyed or later
demolished. After the war, the City carried out extensive reconstruction works on the
historical sites which had been damaged during the war.*?

The Barracks, which date back to 1901, were one of the last remnants of a historic
military quarter, most of which survived World War II.°3 Prior to the conclusion of the
PUA, the Barracks were used as social housing, equipped with water, sewage and
electric systems.4

The Respondent has submitted numerous photographs of the Barracks, including this
one:36

The Parties disagree as to the historical value of the Barracks. Se
RED who prepared a report about the Barracks upon the instructions of the
Claimant's predecessors (duly submitted to the Warsaw Conservator together with 29
Listopada’s request for recommendations in 2007), has opined that the Barracks were
of “low cultural value”, and therefore it was permissible to replace them with a modern
building.** On the other hand, the Respondent maintains that the Polish authorities
have consistently underlined the importance of the Barracks in contemporary Polish
history.2”

The Parties also disagree as to the condition of the Barracks. The Claimant maintains
that the Barracks were in poor shape since the conclusion of the PUA.** The
Respondent asserts that, prior to the PUA, the Barracks were appropriate for living.
The Respondent also underlines that since 2001 it was the usufructuary's
responsibility to maintain the Barracks in decent condition.*°

b. Monuments protection and the Barracks

One of the key disagreements between the Parties goes to the legal protection
accorded to the Barracks. In this context, the Parties rely on several legal instruments
governing monuments protection in Poland.

(i) The 1971 Decision by the Warsaw Monuments Conservator

On 30 June 1971, the Warsaw Monuments Conservator (the “Warsaw Conservator’)
added a certain area in the centre of Warsaw to the register of monuments (the
“Register’), which accords the strongest form of protection under Polish law (the “1971
Decision’).*°

The Parties do not contest that the Property lies within the area defined by the 1971
Decision (the “defined perimeter’), but they disagree on the scope of application of

the Decision.

First, the Parties hold divergent views on which buildings are covered by the 1971
Decision, which is somewhat ambiguous in its detail. The 1971 Decision indicates that

it applies to “bronze era, early and area of his
importance”.*" According to the Respondent, the 1971 Decision applies to any
building of historical importance located within the defined perimeter.*? By contrast, in
the Claimant's interpretation, the 1971 Decision grants protection only to “bronze era,
early medieval and medieval settlements” situated in the area defined therein.*s For
the Claimant, the “area of historical importance” mentioned by the Decision specifies
the location of the “bronze era, early medieval and medieval settlements” and cannot

be understood so as applying to any historical building in the defined perimeter.

Second, the Parties disagree on the type of monuments protected by the 1971
Decision. The Claimant asserts that the 1971 Decision applies only to archaeological
monuments,** whereas the Respondent is of the view that it covers any movable and
immovable monuments.*®

Third, the Parties also diverge on the competence of the Warsaw Conservator
accorded by the 1971 Decision, i.e. whether or not it is within the Warsaw
Conservator’s competence to give instructions on the design of the real estate located
within the defined perimeter.*®

(ii) The 1994 Ordinance by the President of Poland

On 8 September 1994, the President adopted an ordinance declaring the area
“Warsaw — historical city complex with Royal Route and Wilanow” (the “1994
Ordinance”) a protected historical monument.” The 1994 Ordinance states that the
protected area “continues along” 29 Listopada Street.*® The below map, submitted by
the Respondent,** shows the position of the Property vis-a-vis the borders determined
by the 1994 Ordinance.

Ibid. The Respondent presented a slightly different version of this paragraph, which looks as follows:

“Justification: bronze era, early medieval and medieval settlements
Area of historical importance”.

The Parties disagree whether the historical complex defined by the 1994 Ordinance
includes the Property or merely adjoins it.5°

(iii) Inventory of monuments

Between 2008 and 2009, the Polish authorities prepared a so-called “white inventory
card” in order to commence proceedings aimed at entering the Barracks individually
into the Register. The inventory card contained the information required for that
purpose, **
The Parties dispute whether this created any legal obligation with respect to the
Property.*2

(iv) The Register

On 4 January 2011, the Provincial Monuments Conservator (the “Provincial
Conservator”) entered the Barracks into the Register,®* which granted them the
strongest form of protection under Polish law.

29 Listopada challenged the Provincial Conservator’s decision. On 19 April 2011, the
Minister of Culture d the decision of the Provincial C b

29 Listopada was denied the right to present fully its case in the proceedings aimed

the Minister of Culture again reversed the Provincial Conservator's decision due to
the same procedural defect.*®

 

The p i were di: i on 24 N 2011, 7 of the

(v) The PUA

In the context of the PUA, two further observations should be made in the context of
the question as to whether the Claimant and its predecessors were obliged to obtain
the Warsaw Conservator's approval for the development of the Property.

First, it should be noted that Section 9.1 of the PUA requires the construction works
to comply with the zoning plan in force on the date of the conclusion of the PUA (the
“Zoning Plan"), which required consultations with the Warsaw Conservator.** The
Parties agree that this Zoning Plan expired in 2003.5?

It should also be noted that Section 9.2 of the PUA requires that “adaptation and
modernisation of the given real estate requires arrangements with the Monument
Conservator". © The Parties®' and their experts®? are in disagreement over the validity
of this requirement. Specifically, the Parties disagree as to whether, under Polish law,
a private contract (such as the PUA) may create an obligation of administrative
character.

(vi) The 2008 Opinion of the National Centre

 

50. On 20 October 2008, the Nati Centre of F and D. tation
(the “National Centre") summarised the legal regime governing the Property as
follows:*>

i. The building at ul. 29 Listopada 5 is not individually entered in the Register;
ii, The building is included in the conservatory records;

iii. The building is situated in the area of archaeological protection (extract from
the Register dated 30.06.71, no. A-8680);

iv. The building is not situated in the area subject to legal protection of the 1994
Ordinance;

v. The land plot on which the building is situated is adjacent to the tazienki
Krélewskie park area entered in the Register (reg. no. A-2/1).

51. The Parties diverge as to whether the 2008 Opinion of the National Centre represents
an authoritative interpretation of Polish law, and it's binding effect, if any, on the Polish
authorities.

(vii) The 2009 Letters of the Provincial Conservator

52. On 3 February 2009, in response to the request filed by Parkview Terrace, the
Provincial Conservator made the following statements concerning the conservatory
protection accorded to the Property: &

i. The Property is located in the area, which, under the 1971 Decision, is
included in the Register “due to traces of settlements discovered dating back
to the Bronze Age, Early Middle Age and the Middle Age”,

ii. The Barracks are not separately recorded in the Register, but located in an
area designated by the 1994 Ordinance;

iii. “Any activities concerning development of the area which affect the nature or
form of the urban space (changes of color, size of the civil structure, building

layout, fagade, form of roof, roof covering, etc.)” need to be agreed with the
Warsaw Conservator.

On 11 March 2009, the Provincial Conservator issued one more letter correcting
certain statements expressed in the letter of 3 February 2009, and stated as follows:®*

i. The Property is located outside of the perimeter drawn by the 1994 Ordinance;

ii, The only form of protection accorded to the Property is that resulting from the
1971 Decision;

iii, The Property is not accorded the kind of conservation protection which it would
have, had it been entered in the Register on an individual basis.

. Permits and Authorisations prior to 2005

It is common ground that, before applying for a building permit, the usufructuary is
obliged to obtain the City’s approval of the manner in which the Property should be
developed (a “WZ decision”). ®

On 25 October 2002, the City issued a WZ decision in response to the request by
Artodex.®”

Similarly, after the extension of the PUA deadlines, on 21 April 2005, the City issued
another WZ decision, this time in response to the request by 29 Listopada (the “2005
WZ Decision").** The City approved the construction of an additional building on Plot
No. 2, but noted that the modernised Barracks and the new building could not be
higher than 11 meters and no more than two storeys above the ground. The total
usable area was estimated to be around 1,790 sq. m.®?

The 2005 WZ Decision as well as all further WZ decisions were preceded by the
decisions of the Warsaw Conservator.’ The Parties disagree as to whether the

Warsaw Conservator was competent to make such decisions in light of the ambiguity
around the scope of monuments protection accorded to the Property.”

On 11 July 2005, the City, relying inter alia on the 2005 WZ Decision, granted
29 Listopada a building permit (the “2005 Building Permit").’2

a. 2006-2007

In 2006, 29 Listopada decided to modify the plan for development of the Property. To
that end, it applied to the Warsaw Conservator on 13 July 2006.73 On 27 December
2006, the Warsaw Conservator refused to approve the modified plan, which aimed to
construct two additional storeys above the Barracks, an additional five-storeys
building on the Property, an underground parking and an additional perpendicular
wing to the Barracks.”*

In 2007, the White Star Property Group, a real estate group operating in Poland,
began to develop an interest in the Project, with a view to maximizing the Property's
commercial potential.“ Thus, as opposed to the 2005 WZ Decision and the 2005
Building Permit, which involved the development of approximately 2000 sq. m., the
White Star Property Group planned to considerably enhance the development of the
Property by building approximately 30 apartments and 60 underground parking
spaces.’®

On 9 January 2007, the White Star Property Group applied to the Warsaw
Conservator for recommendations on the new concept of the Property.

On 12 April 2007, the Warsaw Conservator issued recommendations approving the
construction of one additional storey above the Barracks and the erection of a
separate building with connecting link instead of an additional wing, provided it would

not be higher than the building located on the area of the Lazienki Krélewskie Museum
(the “Museum"),?7

Apparently encouraged by these recommendations, the White Star Property Group
decided to approach the (iB Group with a request to provide financing for the
Project.

Having analysed the Project, on 19 February 2008, the Investment Committee of the

GERD croup agreed to finance the acquisition of the Property by the White Star
Property Group, as well as all the expenditures relating to the execution of the
Project.7®

The various transactions, as a result of which the Claimant became involved in the
Project and acquired the investment, have already been summarized by the Tribunal
in the Award on Jurisdiction.’®

b. 2008-2009

In January 2008, Parkview Terrace, the new owner of 29 Listopada, applied for a new
WZ decision,®° proposing, inter alia, to develop 26 apartments and one commercial
premise on the Property, with a total usable area of 6,618 sq. m.

On 12 March 2008, the Mi ji to the d plan prop: by
Parkview Terrace, citing concerns of monument protection.**

 

On 16 July 2008, the Warsaw Conservator requested an opinion on the development
plan of Parkview Terrace from the National Centre,®* a state agency established by
the Minister of Culture and National Heritage (the “Minister of Culture") responsible
for implementing the State's policy concerning heritage protection.

On 20 October 2008, the National Centre issued its opinion (the “Opinion of the
National Centre”).2° The experts of the National Centre opined that it was essential to
preserve the front and side walls of the Barracks, while only the back (southern) wall

also underlined that any new building must use “architectural forms that do not
complete [recte compete] with historical neighbourhood”.®>

On 5 January and again on 2 March 2009, the Warsaw Conservator issued negative
decisions on the proposed development of the Property. *° This was arguably in
disregard of the Opinion of the National Centre.*”

On 1 June 2009, in reliance on the negative decisions by the Warsaw Conservator,
the City refused to issue a WZ decision.**

Parkview Terrace challenged the 2009 Decisions of the Warsaw Conservator before
the Minister of Culture.®? On 8 December 2010, the Minister dismissed the
challenge. *® Subsequently, on 28 February 2011, the Minister also dismissed
Parkview Terrace’s requests for re-examination of the case and upheld his earlier
decisions refusing to invalidate the Warsaw Conservator's decisions.*'

Parkview Terrace then brought an appeal before the Masovian*? Administrative Court
(the “Administrative Court’). While it initially prevailed on appeal, on 22 March 2013
the Polish Supreme Administrative Court (the “Supreme Administrative Court’)

c. 2011-2014

In April 2011, 29 Listopada again applied for the Warsaw Conservator's

i The i to two additional storeys above
the Barracks and to erect an additional four-storeys building.** On 6 July 2011, the
Warsaw Conservator endorsed the construction of one additional storey above the
Barracks and emphasized that the additional building could not be higher than the
Barracks.**

On 19 August 2011, 29 Listopada applied to the City for a new WZ decision.1®° Upon
the City’s request, on 29 February 2012, 29 Listopada submitted a revised application
reducing the height of the proposed buildings to 11 m. On 1 June 2012, the City issued
a positive WZ decision (the "2012 WZ Decision"),’"' which was, however, appealed
by the Museum.

On 19 June 2013, the Administrative Court upheld the Museum's appeal and reversed

On 28 May 2015, the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the judgment and found
that the 2012 WZ Decision should have been agreed with the Warsaw Conservator.'°*

On 10 July 2013, Park Residence applied for another set of recommendations.’ On
4 September 2013, the Warsaw Conservator recommended erecting one building with
only two floors, with a double-pitched roof, “of a height similar to that of the nearby
buildings,” which belong to the Museum and lazienki Park.'95

On 22 November 2013, Park Residence applied for another WZ decision.1°°

On 16 April 2014, Park Residence filed another application for recommendations.1”
The new concept envisaged the construction of a complex consisting of one main
building and two smaller ones. The plan envisaged the reconstruction of three walls
of the Barracks (the facade and two gable walls) and a further southern wall in the
same style. The main building would have both residential and commercial functions.
All three buildings would have two floors and an attic that could be used as living
space.

On 16 June 2014, the Conservator approved the construction of only one residential

building with ancillary service facilities on Plot no. 2, because, in the Conservator's
view, the plan proposed by Park Residence was not in line with the PUA.1°8

The Polish authorities were able to review 29 Listopada’s application for the
demolition permit only on Monday, 24 October 2011. By that time the Barracks were
completely destroyed.

The Respondent emphasizes that “the demolition works were supervised by a person
without qualifications, the site of the demolition was not fenced off and there was no
information board, although all of this is strictly required by Polish Building Law.”114

The Respondent highlights that the demolition of the Barracks caused massive public
outcry. Media called it “a prime example of barbarous destruction of Warsaw's
heritage”"5 and “the most spectacular demolishment in years”.'"® The demolition was
also condemned by the Warsaw City Council on 17 November 2011.1"7

In response, the Claimant points to the fact that, on 3 November 2010, the Director of
the Museum had admitted the poor condition of the Barracks by saying that “[t]he
building is not secured and could result a construction disaster at any time... At any
moment, the life and health of people walking down the street may be put at risk.""1

The Parties dispute to whether 29 Listopada was permitted to demolish the Barracks
and whether such demolition was justified."1°

On 20 December 2011, shortly after the demolition of the Barracks, the City called for

Warsaw Regional Court.'?"

all the shares in 29 Listopada (which was renamed Park Residence). 17°
Subsequently, on 24 October 2012, PFS also became the sole shareholder of
Parkview Terrace. According to the Claimant, from that date onwards, ibecame
the sole investor remaining in the project.124

On 4 June 2013, the PUA was terminated by the Warsaw Regional Court.125 Park
Residence and PFS (as the mortgagee) appealed that judgment.

On 19 December 2014, the Warsaw Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and upheld
the termination of the PUA (the “2014 WCA Judgment’).'7° The Parties disagree

Involvement of the Museum

The Claimant invokes several facts, which are alleged to show that the City and the
Museum, which was adjacent to the Property, had a hidden agenda, in the sense that
the Museum was interested in taking over the Property.'”° In particular, on 12 March
2008, the Museum objected to 29 Listopada’s application for a WZ decision and, inter
alia, claimed that “the entire area should be bought back by the Warsaw Council Office
or the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage and incorporated into the Royal Baths
complex."12°

On 15 December 2011, five days before the City called for the termination of the PUA,
the Museum publicly supported the termination of the agreement.'9"

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

A. PRIOR TO THE AWARD ON JURISDICTION

3. The procedural history leading up to the Award on Jurisdiction has been summarized

in that decision.'” In brief, prior to the delivery of the Award on Jurisdiction, the Parties
filed several written submissions as well as exhibits, witness statements (“WS”) and
expert reports ("ERs"). On its part, the Tribunal issued several procedural rulings and
tulings and held a hearing for examination of witnesses and experts and oral
arguments. The main ones among these procedural actions are mentioned in some
more detail below.

104. On 4 December 2014, the Claimant submitted a Request for Arbitration against the

Respondent (the “Request for Arbitration”) pursuant to an arbitration agreement
enshrined in Article 9 (the “Arbitration Agreement’) of the Treaty between the
Government of the People’s Republic of Poland and the Government of the Kingdom
of Belgium and the Government of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg on the Promotion
and Reciprocal Protection of Investments dated 19 May 1987 (the "Treaty” or the
“BIT").

105. On 30 December 2014, the Claimant submitted a Request for Interim Relief (the

“Emergency Application”). Following the appointment of an emergency arbitrator in
the person of Mr. Georgios Petrochilos, the Respondent submitted its Response to
the Emergency Application. On 6 January 2015, the Emergency Arbitrator dismissed
the Emergency Application.

106. On 15 January 2015, the Respondent filed its Answer to the Request for Arbitration.

10

x

On 27 January 2015, the Claimant submitted observations on the Answer.

On 10 February 2015, the tribunal comprising Prof. David Williams, QC, Prof. Philippe
Sands, QC and Prof. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler (presiding arbitrator) was duly
constituted (the “Tribunal’).

On 5 May 2015, the Parties and the Tribunal held a first procedural hearing in London
and signed the Terms of Appointment (“ToA”). Shortly thereafter, the Tribunal issued
Procedural Order No. 1 together with the Procedural Calendar.

On 18 September 2015, the Claimant submitted its Statement of Claim. On
17 November 2015, the Respondent submitted its Memorial on Objections to
Jurisdiction.

In December 2015, the Parties filed several requests concerning document
production. On 12 January 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2,
determining the Parties’ disputed document production requests.

. On 4 March 2016, the Claimant submitted its Second Memorial on Jurisdiction,

whereas the Respondent submitted its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction on 4 April 2016.

On 12 April 2016, the Tribunal held a pre-hearing telephone conference and issued
Procedural Order No. 3 shortly thereafter.

The hearing on jurisdiction took place on 5 and 6 May 2016 in London. A few days
later, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 on post-hearing matters.

On 15 June 2016, the Parties filed their Submissions on Burden of Proof.

On 18 July 2016, after having consulted the Parties, the Tribunal confirmed the
appointment of the Tribunal's legal expert. The Tribunal also issued Procedural Order
No. 5 containing the terms of the expert's appointment, which took into account the
Parties’ suggestions.

. On 5 September 2016, the Tribunal’s legai expert rendered its opinion, first in draft

and then in final form, whereby the Parties had an opportunity to comment on both
versions.

On 10 October 2016, the Parties informed the Tribunal of their preference to “wait to
file their cost submissions until after the jurisdictional decision of the Tribunal", which
preference was acknowledged by the Tribunal.

B. FOLLOWING THE AWARD ON JURISDICTION

118.

On 15 February 2017, the Tribunal issued the Award on Jurisdiction. The Tribunal
decided that it had jurisdiction to rule on whether the 2014 WCA Judgment, as
confirmed by the Polish Supreme Court, constituted “expropriation, nationalization or
any other similar measure affectina investments” in violation of the Treaty. The

23

Tribunal denied jurisdiction over the other claims, including those related to the
alleged breach of the fair and equitable treatment (“FET”) and creeping
expropriation, '*

As to the Claimant's FET claim, the Tribunal noted that the Arbitration Agreement
encompasses disputes relating to “any deprivation or restriction of property rights by
state measures that lead to the consequences similar to expropriation”.1*° It further
held that the measures capable of violating the FET standard set out in Article 3.1 of
the Treaty would not lead to consequences similar to expropriation. As a result, such
measures fell outside the scope of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. 14°

As to the Claimant's creeping expropriation claim, the Tribunal essentially took the
view that a creeping expropriation is comprised of a number of elements, none of
which can — separately — constitute the international wrong. The Tribunal found that
the permanent deprivation of property occurred exclusively as a result of the 2014
WCA Judgment, '*’ while measures prior to the 2014 WCA Judgment were not
expropriatory in character and therefore fell outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

Following the issuance of the Award on Jurisdiction, a calendar was set for the second
phase of the arbitration and the Parties filed a number of submissions on quantum.
They also made several document production requests, upon which the Tribunal ruled
in Procedural Order No. 6.

On 17 March 2017, the Claimant advised the Tribunal that it had filed an action to set
aside the Award on Jurisdiction in the High Court of Justice of England and Wales
(the “English High Court”). Pursuant to Section 67(2) of the English Arbitration Act
1996 (the “EAA”), the proceedings in the English Court did not have suspensive effect
on the arbitral proceedings. None of the Parties asked for the stay of arbitration.

On 20 February 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7 on the organization
of the hearing on merits. The hearing was scheduled to take place on 21 and 22 March
2018. However, it was subsequently cancelled due to the partial setting aside of the
Award on Jurisdiction.

C. THE ENGLISH HIGH COURT JUDGMENT

. On 2 March 2018, the English High Court partially set aside the Award on Jurisdiction
(the “English High Court Judgment’) pursuant to Section 67 of the EAA.

. Justice Bryan conducted a de novo review of jurisdiction’? and, inter alia, assessed
arguments concerning the drafting of the Treaty that were not invoked during the
arbitral proceedings.'4*

First, Justice Bryan held that the interpretation of Article 9 of the Treaty, leading to the
determination that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction over the FET claim, was erroneous,
He analyzed the ordinary meaning of the words used in Article 9(1)(b) of the Treaty
and made the following conclusion:

98. Thus, an FET claim based on measures involving a deprivation or

restriction of property rights and which leads to/causes consequences

similar to expropriation does fall within the scope of disputes that can be

submitted to arbitration under Article 9.1(b) on the ordinary meaning of

the words used, and ! so find.“
Second, Justice Bryan disagreed with the Tribunal's approach to creeping
expropriation, which had led the Tribunal to deny jurisdiction over events prior to the
2014 WCA Judgment."45 Specifically, Justice Bryan noted:

L..] The possibility that the decision of Warsaw Court of Appeal might itself

amount to an expropriation, does not preclude a consideration of the prior

measures relied upon by mmm 2s part of its indirect expropriation claim

based on an alleged creeping expropriation [...].'4°
Therefore, after having conducted a prima facie analysis of the Claimant's creeping
expropriation claim, Justice Bryan determined that the Tribunal had jurisdiction over
events which occurred before the 2014 WCA Judgment.'47

In summary, Justice Bryan thus ordered that:

1. Paragraphs 187(ii) and 187(iii) of the Award be set aside.

2. In substitution for the aforesaid Paragraphs 187(ii) and 187(iii) of the
Award, it is declared that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over:

a. All of the factual matters, actions, allegations and/or measures relied
upon in support of the Claimant's claim of direct and/or indirect
expropriation contrary to Article 4.1 of the BIT, which claim is pleaded at
paragraphs 466-479 of the Claimant's Statement of Claim dated 18
September 2015 (“the Statement of Claim”) (which in turn cross-refers to

the entirety of the factual allegations set out earlier in the Statement of
Claim);

b. All of the factual matters, actions, allegations and/or measures relied
upon in support of the Claimant's claim of breach of fair and equitable
treatment contrary to Article 3.1 of the BIT, which claim is pleaded at
paragraphs 480-507 of the Statement of Claim dated 18 September 2015
(which in turn cross-refers to the entirety of the factual allegations set out
earlier in the Statement of Claim).

c. The Tribunal will take the necessary steps for the continuation of the

proceedings towards the liability phase dealing with the measures

identified in paragraphs a. and b, above.**
On 2 March 2018, Justice Bryan refused to grant the Respondent the permission to
appeal his judgment (the “Refusal”). *° He determined that the Respondent's
application did not satisfy the requirements of Part 52.6 of the Civil Procedure Rules,
as it had no prospects of success and there were no compelling reasons to grant the
permission.
In March 2018, the Respondent appealed the Refusal pursuant to Section 54(4) of
the Access to Justice Act of 1999 before the Court of Appeal (England and Wales)
(the “English Court of Appeal”).
On 3 April 2018, the Tribunal stayed the proceedings pending the English Court of
Appeal's decision.

On 23 July 2018, the English Court of Appeal sustained the Refusal.1°°

. On 30 July 2018, the Tribunal resumed the proceedings and invited the Parties to

agree on the next procedural steps of the arbitration.

requested the opportunity to reply to these documents. On 3 April 2019, the
Respondent objected to the Claimant's request.

On 5 April 2019, upon the invitation of the Tribunal, the Claimant briefly commented
on the Respondent's letter of 3 April 2019. It asked the Tribunal either to grant it
permission to file a rebuttal ER on MC or to strike the Respondent's ER (“RER’) on
MC from the record. On 9 April 2019, the Respondent objected to the Claimant's
request.

On 12 April 2019, the Tribunal decided to keep the RER on MC on the record and to
authorize the Claimant to file a rebuttal ER on MC. The Tribunal also invited the
Respondent to file an additional ER on MC, if necessary.

On 15 May 2019, the Claimant filed the Expert Legal Opinion by QD

ERED On 24 June 2019, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it did not
intend to submit an additional ER on MC. Instead, the Respondent filed additional

legal authorities related tc CD =r.

144,

145.

146.

147.

On 16 October 2018, the European Commission (the “EC”) filed an application to
intervene as a non-disputing party. The EC wished to comment on the legal
consequences of the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the
“CJEU") in the Achmea case rendered on 6 March 2018 (the “Achmea Judgment’).
On 9 November 2018, the Claimant objected to the EC's intervention ("CS on EC’s
Intervention”). The Claimant argued that the Respondent did not raise any objections
based on the intra-EU nature of the Treaty and, in any event, the Award on Jurisdiction
was res judicata. The Claimant also objected to the EC’s request to access the record
and attend oral hearings.

On the same day, the Respondent filed its position endorsing the EC's intervention.
On 26 November 2018, the Tribunal asked the Parties to present their submissions
on the principle of res judicata, invoked by the Claimant on 9 November 2018.

On 3 December 2018, the Respondent filed the Submission on the Achmea Judgment
(“RS on Achmea’) together with accompanying legal authorities.

On 3 December 2018, the Claimant filed a supplementary submission on res judicata
(‘CRJ Submission”) together with accompanying legal authorities.

On 8 January 2019, the Tribunal allowed the EC’s intervention, relying on Section 11
of the ToA, Section 34(1) of the EAA 1996 and Article 19 of the SCC Rules. However,
the Tribunal denied the EC’s request to access the record and attend the hearing.

On 8 February 2019, the EC filed its amicus curiae brief (the “Amicus Curiae Brief’)
on the application of the principle of res judicata and the consequences of the Achmea
Judgment, together with accompanying legal authorities.

On 21 March 2019, the Claimant filed its Answer to the submissions of Poland and
the European Commission on the Achmea Judgment (“CS on Achmea’) together with
accompanying exhibits and legal authorities.

whether QED ought to attend the hearing.

On 25 June 2019, the Tribunal provided the Parties with a revised version of the
hearing schedule, to which the Parties raised no objection. The Tribunal also indicated

that the presence as the hearing was not necessary.

On 21 August 2019, the Tribunal held a pre-hearing telephone conference call. On
26 August 2019, the Tribunal adopted Procedural Order No. 8 on the organization of

regard to the discussions during the pre-hearing telephone conference call.

On 2 September 2019, the Parties provided the Tribunal with the hearing bundle and
the list of attendees.

SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS

165. The purpose of the present Section is to provide a brief overview of the Parties’

positions on the open jurisdictional matters and the merits. The Parties’ more specific
arguments on the issues in this case are addressed in more detail in the Analysis part
of the Award at Section IV.

A. THE POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES AND THE EC ON JURISDICTION

166. At the first stage of these proceedings, the Respondent raised several jurisdictional

167.

objections concerning the scope of the Arbitration Agreement, the existence of an
investment, and the Claimant's standing.'' These objections were analysed and
resolved in the Award on Jurisdiction, '*? as modified by the English Court Judgment"
(the “Decision on Jurisdiction”).

Following the CJEU's judgment in Achmea, the Respondent raised a new
jurisdictional objection, which relates to the validity of the Arbitration Agreement
enshrined in Article 9 of the Treaty, which is an intra-EU BIT (the “Achmea Objection").
In response to the Achmea Objection, *™ the Claimant argued that the Tribunal may
not revisit the jurisdiction because the Tribunal is functus officio and the Decision on
Jurisdiction is res judicata. The Respondent disagreed with the Claimant's
contentions. The EC supported the Respondent's position in its Amicus Curiae Brief.

For the sake of consistency and ease of reference, the summary of the Parties’ and
the EC's positions on functus officio and res judicata are presented first (1), followed
by their respective positions on the Achmea Judgment (2).

On functus officio and res judicata

169. The Claimant argues that the Tribunal's jurisdiction has been determined by the

Decision on Jurisdiction, which cannot be revisited under the SCC Rules, English or
international law.'®> Specifically, it posits that the Decision on Jurisdiction (1) is final

and binding on the parties; (2) constitutes res judicata; and thus (3) cannot be revisited
by the Tribunal, which is functus officio on issues of jurisdiction.1°*

In support of its position, the Claimant relies on Article 40 of the SCC Rules,” Section
58(1) of the EAA‘®* and numerous decisions of arbitral tribunals.'*° The Claimant also
argues, with reference to the CJEU judgment in the EcoSwiss case, that the Achmea
Judgment has no impact on the res judicata effect of the Decision on Jurisdiction
under EU law."

It is the Claimant's further position that the Respondent had the opportunity to raise
the objection regarding the validity of an arbitration agreement contained in an intra-
EU investment treaty at the earlier stage of these proceedings, but failed to do so.
The Claimant also emphasizes that the Respondent raised an identical objection in
other arbitral proceedings in 2016, but chose not to do so in the present case.’*'

On the basis of the arguments, the Claimant asks the Tribunal to deny the
Respondent's “new” jurisdictional objection."®*

In response, the Respondent first argues that Article 40 of the SCC Rules"® does not
preclude the Tribunal from hearing the Achmea Objection because “[a]n investment
tribunal draws its jurisdiction from Parties' consent and, hence, it has inherent
jurisdiction enabling it to take such action as may be required to verify, at any stage
of the proceeding, whether it possesses the jurisdiction over the subject-matter’.
According to the Respondent, “[s]uch inherent power can be always exercised even
in the absence of a specific statutory provision”.'™

Ibid., p. 2.

According to Article 40 of the SCC Rules, “[aJn award shall be final and binding on the parties when
rendered. By agreeing to arbitration under these Rules, the parties undertake to carry out any award
without delay.”

Section 58 of the EAA states that “[u]niess otherwise agreed by the parties, an award made by the
tribunal pursuant to an arbitration agreement is final and binding both on the parties and on any persons
claiming through or under them”.

Second, the Respondent contends that because neither the Tribunal nor the English
Court decided the Achmea Objection, the principle of res judicata does not apply."®*
According to the Respondent, that principle requires identity of (i) the parties; (ii) the
object of relief, and (iii) legal grounds. It also requires that (iv) the matter to be re-
litigated has been raised and definitely settled, directly or by necessary implication, in
the prior decision."®* The latter element, so the Respondent observes, follows from
the recent decision of the International Court of Justice in Nicaragua v. Costa Rica,'*"
Thus, the critical issue here is whether the Tribunal or the English High Court decided
the issues arising from the Achmea Judgment. In the Respondent's view, they clearly
did not.

Finally, the Respondent underlines that it could not have raised the Achmea Objection
earlier because the Achmea Judgment was only rendered in March 2018. It also
clarifies that the objection raised in the other investment did not relate to the Achmea
Judgment, which had not been hand down then. 7*

As a result, it is the Respondent's position that it did not waive abstraction the right to
invoke the Achmea Judgment but rather repeatedly manifested its intention to do so,
for instance, during the telephone conference which took place between the Parties
and the Tribunal in February 2018.16?

As a consequence, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal is not precluded from
hearing the Achmea Objection.

The EC supports the Respondent's position in its Amicus Curiae Brief. \t opines that
the Tribunal is not functus officio, as it has an inherent power to determine its
jurisdiction at any stage of the proceedings. Moreover, in the EC’s view, the principle
of res judicata does not apply because the Achmea Objection was never resolved by
the Tribunal or the English High Court.

that the Parties may address this question in their opening staternents during the hearing, which was at
the time scheduled to take place in March 2018, and in their PHBs. On 2 March 2018, the Award on
Jurisdiction was partially set aside by the English High Court and the March 2018 hearing was cancelled.
On 5 August 2018, the Tribunal adopted the Revised Procedural Calendar, in accordance with which the
Respondent filed its submission on the Achmee Judgment on 3 December 2018.

2. On the Achmea Judgment

179.

180.

181.

172

175

The Respondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over all claims before the
Tribunal due to the invalidity of the Arbitration Agreement arising from the Achmea
Judgment.17°

According to the Respondent, the Treaty was terminated pursuant to Article 59(1) of
the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 1969 (the “VCLT")'”’ or, alternatively,
the Arbitration Agreement was terminated by virtue of Article 30(3) of the VCLT.*7? In
its ission, the requi of these provisi are met bé (i) the EU
Treaties are the “later treaties’ under the VCLT, since Poland acceded to the EU

 

Treaties on 1 May 2004, many years after the conclusion of the BIT; (ii) the EU
Treaties and the BIT relate to the same subject-matter; and (iii) the EU Treaties and
the BIT are incompatible because the arbitration clauses in intra-EU BITs contradict
the provisions of EU law safeguarding the integrity of the EU legal order contained in
Article 19 of the Treaty on the European Union (the “TEU")'75 as well as Articles 267174
and 344 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (the “TFEU”)."7°

In sum, the Arbitration Agreement is thus invalid and/or inapplicable by virtue of
Article 30 or Article 59 of the VCLT.17°

RS on Achmea, § 60.

Article 59(1) of the VCLT reads in the relevant part as follows: “1. A treaty shall be considered as
terminated if all the parties to it conclude a later treaty relating to the same subject matter and: (a) it
appears from the later treaty or is otherwise established that the parties intended that the matter should
be governed by that treaty...”.

According to Article 30(3) of the VCLT, “3. When all the parties to the earlier treaty are parties also to the
later treaty but the earlier treaty is not terminated or suspended in operation under article 59, the earlier
treaty applies only to the extent that its provisions are compatible with those of the later treaty’.

Article 19 of the TEU reads in the relevant part as follows: “1. The Court of Justice of the European Union
shall include the Court of Justice, the General Court and specialised courts. It shall ensure that in the
interpretation and application of the Treaties the law is observed [...] 3. The Court of Justice of the
European Union shall, in accordance with the Treaties: (a) rule on actions brought by a Member State,
an institution or a natural or legal person; (b) give preliminary rulings, at the request of courts or tribunals
of the Member States, on the interpretation of Union law or the validity of acts adopted by the institutions;
(c) rule in other cases provided for in the Treaties.”

Article 267 of the TFEU reads in the relevant part as follows, “The Court of ihyetcs of the pee
Union shall have to give pr tulings

the Treaties; (b) the validity and interpretation of acts of the Padutohe bodies, offices a
agencies of the Union; Where such a question is raised before any court or tribunal of a Member
State, that court or tribunal may, if it considers that a decision on the question is necessary to
enable it to give judgment, request the Court to give a ruling thereon..."

Article 344 of the TFEU holds that: “Member States undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the
interpretation or application of the Treaties to any method of settlement other than those provided for
therein.”

°

Finally, the Respondent underlines that an award which disregards the findings of the
Achmea Judgment will in any event be annulled at the seat of the arbitration.'7”

The EC fully supports the Respondent's position. It opines that Article 9 of the Treaty
is inoperable by virtue of international and EU law. Consequently, the present
arbitration lacks the Respondent's consent.

The Claimant opposes these arguments for the following three main raisons. First, it
argues that the Tribunal’s jurisdiction must be established on the date when the
Request for Arbitration was filed. The Achmea Judgment, which was rendered in
2018, is therefore irrelevant for jurisdictional purposes. ‘7°

Second, the Claimant contends that the Treaty remains valid, since the requirements
of Article 30 or Article 59(1) of the VCLT’”® are not met. More specifically, the Claimant
contends that (i) the EU Treaties are not the “later treaties” under the VCLT, because
their provisions repeat the provisions of EU treaties dating back to 1957; (ii) the EU
Treaties and the BIT do not relate to the same subject-matter, as the EU Treaties deal
with market principles, whereas the BIT offers a comprehensive investment protection
scheme; and (iii) the Treaty is compatible with the EU Treaties, as there is no

i the Arbitration Ag i in Article 9 of the Treaty
and Articles 344 and 267 of the TFEU,'®° considering that the former does not relate
to the application of EU law or the power of the CJEU to resolve disputes under EU

 

law,181

Third, even if the requirements of Article 30 or Article 59(1) of the VCLT'®? were
fulfilled, the Respondent's obligation to resolve the present dispute remain in force
pursuant to Article 69(2)(b)'*° and Article 70(1)(b) of the VCLT.1 The Claimant
observes that it commenced this arbitration in good faith and thus these proceedings

Ibid, § 61.
CS on Achmea, §§ 114-118.
Supra, fns. 171, 172.
Supra, fns, 174, 175.
CS on Achmea, §§ 119-156.
Supra, fns. 171, 172.

According to Article 69(2)(b) of the VCLT, “1. A treaty the invalidity of which is established under the
present Convention is void. The provisions of a void treaty have no legal force. 2. If acts have
nevertheless been performed in reliance on such a treaty: [...] (b) acts performed in good faith before
the invalidity was invoked are not rendered unlawful by reason only of the invalidity of the treaty.”
According to Article 70(1)(b) of the VCLT: “1. Unless the treaty otherwise provides or the parties
otherwise agree, the termination of a treaty under its provisions or in accordance with the present
Convention: [...] (b) does not affect any right, obligation or legal situation of the parties created through
the execution of the treaty prior to its termination.”

188.

cannot be rendered unlawful as a result of the alleged invalidity of the Treaty by virtue
of Article 69(2) of the VCLT.'*> Similarly, the Claimant notes that its right to resolve
this dispute in arbitration was “created” through the “execution” of the Treaty, ie. by
filing the Request for Arbitration pursuant to Article 9(1) of the Treaty. This occurred
before the Respondent raised its arguments about the
termination/invalidity. 1° Consequently, under Article 70(1)(b) of the VCLT the
Respondent's obligation under Article 9 of the Treaty to resolve the present dispute
cannot be affected by the alleged termination/invalidity of the Treaty.18”

Finally, the Claimant argues that any considerations related to the enforceability of
the award in the EU cannot constitute grounds for refusing to exercise jurisdiction.1%*
The Claimant also observes that the Declaration of the EU Member States is merely
a political statement without legal force.'%*

B. THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS ON THE MERITS AND REQUEST FOR RELIEF

Claimant

a. Expropriation (Article 4(1) of the Treaty)

. The Claimant alleges that the Respondent directly and indirectly expropriated the
Claimant's investment in breach of Article 4(1) of the Treaty.'° First, the Claimant
invokes numerous measures adopted by the Respondent that allegedly prevented the
construction on the Property from going forward and resulted in the termination of the
PUA. In the Claimant's submission, this amounts to “indirect (including creeping)
expropriation” contrary to Article 4(1) of the Treaty.19"

Supra, fn. 183.

CS on Achmea, §§ 157-160.
Supra, fn. 184.

CS on Achmea, §§ 165-174,
Ibid., §§ 161-164.

According to Article 4(1) of the Treaty, “1. The investments made by investors of one of the Contracting
Parties in the territory of the other Contracting Party shall not be expropriated or subjected to other
measures of direct or indirect dispossession having a similar effect, unless the following conditions have
been met: a) the measures were adopted in the public interest and in accordance with legal process; b)
they are neither discriminatory, nor contrary to any special commitment such as that described in Article
7, section 2; c) they are accompanied by provision for the payment of compensation, the amount of which
must correspond to the real value of the investments concerned on the day before the measures were
adopted or were made public. Compensation shall be paid to the investors in a convertible currency,
transmitted without delay and freely transferable”.

Second, the Claimant alleges that the termination of the PUA by the Warsaw Court of
Appeal, as a result of which the Claimant no longer retains any real property rights,
amounts to direct expropriation in breach of Article 4(1) of the Treaty.'? According to
the Claimant, this expropriation was illegal, because the Respondent discriminated
against the Claimant and breached special commitments vis-a-vis the Claimant, while
paying no adequate and effective compensation.'%°

b. FET (Article 3(1) of the Treaty)

The Claimant also alleges that the Respondent breached Article 3(1) of the Treaty,
which guarantees fair and equitable treatment.

The Claimant submits that the Respondent breached Article 3(1) by (i) frustrating the
Claimant's legitimate expectations; (ii) acting in bad faith; and (iii) adopting
discriminatory and unjustified measures against the Claimant.

First, as to the breach of its legitimate expectations, the Claimant relies on various
administrative documents issued by the Polish authorities, which allegedly made it
clear that all the necessary authorisations to develop the Property would be granted
and the PUA would remain in force. However, the Claimant's expectations were
frustrated when the City refused to issue a WZ decision in 2009 and the PUA was
terminated by the Polish courts in 2014.1

Second, the Claimant alleges that Poland acted in bad faith on numerous occasions
during the development of the Property. According to the Claimant, the Respondent
misapplied Polish law in order to deny the relevant authorisations to the Claimant and
its predecessors.'%°

Third, the Claimant that the R breached the obligation not to
adopt unjustified and discriminatory measures. It argues that the Polish authorities
had a hidden agenda of favouring the Museum to the detriment of the Claimant, which
amounts to unjustified conduct contrary to Article 3(1) of the Treaty. Moreover, the
Claimant submits that Poland treated other investors in like circumstances more

Ibid., §§ 409-426.
Ibid., §§ 428-439,
Ibid., §§ 440-449.

36

favourably than the Claimant, which constitutes discrimination in breach of Article 3.1
of the Treaty. 1°

c. Request for relief

195. For all these reasons, the Claimant requested the following relief in its Amended
Statement of Claim:

On the basis of the foregoing, QI respectfully requests the following
relief:

(i) DISMISS the Republic of Poland's new objections to jurisdiction
formulated following the Award on Jurisdiction and the 2 March 2018
decision of the High Court of Justice in London;

(ii) DECLARE that the Republic of Poland has breached the Treaty and
international law, and in particular, that it has:

(i) expropriated QDs investments without compensation, in breach of
Article 4.1 of the Treaty;

(ii) failed to accord QDs investments fair and equitable treatment and
impaired invesiments through unjustified and discriminatory
measures, in breach of Article 3.1 of the Treaty;

(iii) ORDER the Republic of Poland to compensate lor the Republic
of Poland's breaches of the Treaty and international jaw in an amount no
less than EUR 16,350,384.49, or such other amount that the Tribunal will
deem appropriate, plus pre-award and post-award interest at a rate of 13%
annually between 18 December 2014 and 23 December 2014, 8%
annually between 24 December 2014 and 31 December 2015, and 7%
annually subsequently, compounded quarterly until full payment of the
Award is made (or any such other interest rate and/or compounding period
as the Tribunal will deem appropriate);

(iv) ORDER the Republic of Poland to pay the full costs of this arbitration,
including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, the fees and expenses of
the SCC, the fees and expenses relating tol legal representation,
and the fees and expenses of any experts appointed by the Claimant or
the Tribunal, if any, plus interest at the rate of 7% annually since the date
of the Award; and

(v) AWARD such other relief as the Tribunal considers appropriate. 1°”

496. The Claimant confirmed its Request for Relief in the C-PHB,*°*
2. Respondent

197. As a preliminary observation, the Respondent underlines that the Claimant failed to
comply with Polish laws and regulations and acted in a manner manifestly prejudicial
to the public interest by demolishing the Barracks. For this reason, the Respondent

18 C-PHB, § 112.

37

198.

requests the Tribunal to find that the Claimant deserves no Treaty protection on the
grounds of the clean hands doctrine. 19°

a. Expropriation (Article 4(1) of the Treaty)

In its defense against the expropriation claim, the Ri dent distinguishes b

the 2014 WCA Judgment and the measures adopted before the 2014 WCA Judgment.

The 2014 WCA Judgment

|. The Respondent's primary position is that only the 2014 WCA Judgment could at all

constitute expropriation.2% In its view, an asset cannot be expropriated twice. Thus,
even if the Respondent's measures adopted before the 2014 WCA Judgment “had a
deferred expropriatory potential, such effects never materialized because of the
supervening acts in the form of the judicial termination of the Perpetual Usufruct
Agreement’.2°' Consequently, only the 2014 WCA Judgment could be considered as
an expropriatory act.

That said, the Respondent underlines that the 2014 WCA Judgment does not amount
to expropriation for the following three reasons. First, expropriatory acts of state courts
are unlawful only if they qualify as denial of justice,2°* and the 2014 WCA Judgment
does not qualify as such.?°? In other words, the absence of denial of justice precludes
a finding of expropriation.2°

Second, the Respondent argues that the risk of termination of the PUA was already
present at the time the investment was made, and it is GPF which failed to act
diligently. 29° Thus the termination of the PUA by the Polish courts was not
expropriatory.

Third, the 2014 WCA Judgment was not expropriatory, because it was adopted in the
valid exercise of the Respondent's police powers. The 2014 WCA Judgment pursued

a legitimate public purpose and complied with the requirements of non-discrimination,
proportionality and due process.°°

In any event, even if the Tribunal were to decide that the 2014 WCA Judgment

to expropriation, Poland that it ied with Article 4(1) of the
Treaty, as the 2014 WCA Jud twas iscriminatory, proportional, pted for
a public purpose and in compliance with due process.2°7

 

 

Measures adopted prior to the 2014 WCA Judgment

In the event that the Tribunal were to decide that the measures adopted before the
2014 WCA Judgment can also have expropriatory effect, the Respondent argues that
they do not amount to expropriation within the meaning of Article 4(1) of the Treaty
for the following two reasons. First, the measures did not prevent the development of
the Property, 7° were non-discriminatory, °° and “did not breach any special
commitments” vis-a-vis the Claimant's investment.?"° In addition, they were adopted
in the valid exercise of the Respondent's police powers.?"1

Second and alternatively, the Respondent contends that the actions and omissions of
the City of Warsaw relating to the performance of the PUA, including the negotiations
with respect to extending the development deadlines, are not attributable to the
Respondent.?'2

b. FET (Article 3(1) of the Treaty)

It is the Respondent's position that the Treaty does not guarantee FET beyond the
international minimum standard.?"° Thus, unless the Claimant demonstrates that
Poland's conduct was “wilfully and blatantly wrong, actually malicious, totally arbitrary,
evidently discriminatory, or so far beyond the pale that it cannot be defended among

the reasonable members of international community’, the Respondent cannot be held
in breach of Article 3(1) of the Treaty.2**

The Respondent further argues that it did not frustrate the Claimant's legitimate
expectations.2%* When making the investment, the Claimant was fully aware that the
time limits for developing the Property were exceeded by over two years, and thus it
could not have legitimately expected that the PUA would remain in force.?'° The
Claimant was equally aware of its obligation to modernise and adapt the Barracks,
and thus could not have legitimately expected to continue benefitting from the PUA
after the demolition of the Barracks.?1”

Finally, the Respondent insists that it never acted in bad faith;?"* it had no “hidden
agenda” in respect of the Museum; nor did it adopt any discriminatory or unjustified
measures vis-a-vis the Claimant.?"9 Instead, its only aim was to protect its cultural
property.

c. Request for relief

For all these reasons, the Ri rt ted the ing relief in the A ded
Statement of Defence:

 

In light of the foregoing, the Respondent respectfully requests the Tribunal
to decide that:

|. The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over the Claimant's claims as set
forth in the Amended Statement of Claim.

In particular:

(i) The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over the Claimant's claims
related to the violation of Article 4(1) of the Treaty (Part V of the Amended
Statement of Claim);

(ii) The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over the Claimant's claims
related to the violation of Article 3(1) of the Treaty (Part VI of the Amended
Statement of Claim);

IL Should the Tribunal find that it has jurisdiction over the Claimant's claims
and that these claims are not inadmissible, the Respondent respectfully
requests the Tribunal to dismiss the Claimant's claims in their entirety.

ANALYSIS

After dealing with certain preliminary matters (A), the Tribunal will address
jurisdictional matters (B), followed by liability (C). The Parties’ arguments, insofar as
they are necessary to resolve the relevant issues in dispute, have been reproduced
prior to the Tribunal’s analysis of each issue, although the Tribunal may further
develop the Parties’ position in the analysis itself. Furthermore, while it has considered
all of the Parties’ arguments, for reasons of procedural economy, the Tribunal has
reproduced only what it views as the most important arguments for its decision.

A. PRELIMINARY MATTERS

212. Before addressing the merits of the dispute, the Tribunal will set out preliminary

observations, that concern the subject matter of this Award (1); the relevance of prior
decisions (2); the law governing the proceedings (3); and the law applicable to the
merits of the dispute (4).

1. Subject matter of this Award

213. This Award follows the Decision on Jurisdiction, and deals with the Respondent's

newly raised jurisdictional objection and the merits of the dispute.

2. Relevance of prior decisions on international investment law

214. Both Parties have referred to a number of awards and decisions of international

220

tribunals dealing with international investment law. The Claimant and the EC have
also referred to a number of judgments of English courts dealing with the principles of
res judicata and functus officio. The Tribunal considers that, while it is not bound by
previous decisions of international tribunals, in its judgment, it should pay due

Ibid., § 734.
R-PHB, § 99.

41

consideration to such decisions and, subject to compelling contrary grounds, it should

 

seek to give effect to princi that are i and i ina
series of clear and consistent cases.

3. Law governing the proceedings

215. The Tribunal also recalls that the procedural matters of this arbitration are governed
by the rules set out in paragraph 63 of the ToA, which reads as follows:

This arbitration shall be governed by (in the following order of
precedence):

a) The procedural rules set out in the BIT;

b) The mandatory rules of the law on international arbitration applicable
at the seat of the arbitration;

c) These Terms of Appointment and Procedural Order No. 1 and any
‘subsequent procedural order;

d) The SCC Rules.

216. In this context, the Tribunal also notes that the Respondent challenges the validity of
Article 9 of the Treaty, which reads in the relevant part as follows:

Article 9

1. [a)] Any dispute between one of the Contracting Parties and the investor
of the other Contracting Party shall be the subject of a written notification
which shall be accompanied by a detailed aide-mémoire, addressed by the
investor of a Contracting Party to the other Contracting Party, As far as
possible the dispute shall be amicably settled by the parties.

b) As used in this article, the term ‘disputes’ shall mean disputes relating
to expropriation, nationalization or any other similar measures affecting
investments, and notably the transfer of an investment into public property,
placing it under public supervision as well as any other deprivation or
restriction of property rights by state measures that lead to consequences
similar to expropriation.222

2. In the absence of an amicable settlement within six months from the
date of the written notification mentioned in section 1, the dispute shall be
submitted, at the investor's choice, to one of the following bodies:

a) the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce;

b) the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes
(ICSID), established under the ‘Convention on the Settlement of
Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States’,
signed in Washington on March 18, 1965, when each state Party to the
present agreement has become a party to the said Convention;

c) an ‘ad hoc’ tribunal, organized in accordance with the rules of the United

Nations Commission on International Trade Law or of the United Nations
Economic Commission for Europe, where the competent authority to

cd As noted above, the translation of Article 9(1)(b) has been submitted separately as exhibit CLA-57 and
has been explicitly agreed between the Parties. For the rest of the translation of Article 9, the Tribunal
has referred to CLA-1

42

appoint the arbitrator(s) shall be, depending on the investor's choice, the
UN Secretary General or the President of the International Court of Justice.

l.1
5. The arbitral tribunal shall resolve the dispute based on:

- The internal law of that Contracting Party, party to the dispute, on the
territory the investment of which is located, including conflicts of laws
principles,

- The provisions of this Agreement,

- The terms and conditions of any specific agreement conceming the
investment,

- The rules and principles of international law generally admitted.

4. Law governing the merits

217.

218.

219.

220.

228

The Tribunal applies the Treaty between the Government of the People’s Republic of
Poland and the Government of the Kingdom of Belgium and the Government of the
Grand Duchy of Luxembourg on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of
Investments dated 19 May 1987.228

The Treaty contains no choice of law clause. Being an international treaty, the BIT is
governed by general international law, including the VCLT,2% to which Poland and
Luxembourg are parties.

Articles 3 and 4 of the Treaty are particularly relevant to the merits of the dispute.
Article 3(1) of the Treaty provides as follows: 27°

Each Contracting Party shall accord in its territory to investments made by
investors of the other Contracting Party fair and equitable treatment,
excluding any unjustified or discriminatory measure that could impede the
management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or liquidation thereof,

As for Article 4, the Tribunal recalls that the Parties have submitted two slightly
different translations of that provision. For the sake of completeness, the Tribunal

As noted in its letter to Parties of 1 June 2016, the Tribunal will refer to the Claimant's translation of the
Treaty (CLA-1) as it finds it to be slightly more accurate than the translation submitted by the Respondent
(R-2EN). In the same letter, the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit a joint English translation of Articles
1(1), 3(1) and 4(1). On 15 June 2016, the Parties provided an agreed translation of such articles (CLA-
194). Thus the Tribunal will refer to exhibit CLA-194 for the translation of Articles 1(1), 3(1) and 4(1).

Article 4
[Claimant's version]

41. The investments made by investors of one of the Contracting Parties in
the territory of the other Contracting Party shall not be expropriated or
subjected to other measures of direct or indirect dispossession having a
similar effect, unless the following conditions have been met:

a) the measures were adopted in the public interest and in accordance with
legal process;

b) they are neither discriminatory, nor contrary to any special commitment
such as that described in Article 7, section 2;

c) they are accompanied by provision for the payment of compensation,
the amount of which must correspond to the real value of the investments
concerned on the day before the measures were adopted or were made
public. Compensation shall be paid to the investors in a convertible
currency, transmitted without delay and freely transferable.

222, As discussed in paragraphs 124-134 above, the Award on Jurisdiction was partially
set aside by the English High Court, which extended the scope of the Tribunal’s

jurisdiction to include the Claimant's indirect expropriation claim arising out of Article
4 of the Treaty.

the Achmea Objection, arguing that the Arbitration Agreement was not valid in

application of the CJEU's decision that dispute resolution clauses in intra-EU BITs are
incompatible with EU law.?26

As discussed below, *”° the Claimant challenges the substance of the Respondent's
arguments. In addition, the Claimant raises the following three preliminary objections
regarding the Tribunal’s ability to address the Respondent's newly raised jurisdictional
objections at this stage. First, the Claimant argues that the Tribunal is incompetent to
reconsider (or “revisit”) the Decision on Jurisdiction because the Tribunal is functus
officio (b). Second, it claims that the Achmea Objection must be dismissed because
the Decision on Jurisdiction is res judicata (c). Third, the Claimant contends that the
Respondent lost its right to raise the Achmea Objection under English law, because
the Respondent could and should have raised it earlier (d).7°°

The Tribunal will consider these three preliminary issues first, after determining the
law governing res judicata and functus officio (a) and before discussing the merits of
the Respondent's Achmea Objection (2).

In this context, the Tribunal observes that the EC, which the Tribunal had invited to
file an Amicus Curiae Brief “on the legal consequences of the Achmea Judgment” 2°"
also provided its views on the impact of res judicata and functus officio principles.?°2
Strictly speaking, the EC exceeded the scope of its intervention by providing these
views. The Tribunal is however inclined to take into account the EC's submissions on
functus officio and res judicata, as these are linked to the legal consequences of the
Achmea Judgment and the Claimant did not object to their admissibility, and
commented extensively on them.

a. Which law applies to res judicata and functus officio?

{i) The Positions of the Parties and of the EC

1. Claimant

The Claimant argues that the operation of res judicata and functus officio is governed
solely by English law and the SCC Rules, because the present arbitration is seated
in London and conducted under the SCC Rules.?%*

The Claimant further argues that, contrary to the Respondent's and the EC's
submissions, there is no basis for applying only international law to the disputed
issues. For the Claimant, international law may only supplement the rules chosen by
the Parties. 4 At the same time, the Claimant highlights the absence of any
transnational rules governing res judicata.2*

2. Respondent

The Respondent is of the view that the principles of res judicata and functus officio
are governed by international law and the SCC Rules. However, it denies any

relevance to English law.

3. The EC

The EC notes that there is no clear doctrinal consensus on whether res judicata is a
procedural or a substantive issue; as a result, there is no consensus on the applicable
law. This said, it opines that res judicata is governed by international law, because
“the question of jurisdiction turns on the legality of a Treaty governed by (i)
international law’. Alternatively, the EC considers that the application of English law
leads to the same outcome.?%°

(i) Analysis

The Tribunal notes that there is no consensus on the law governing the operation of
res judicata and functus officio. The Parties have identified three sets of rules arguably
applicable to these matters, namely international law (1), English law (2) and the SCC
Rules (3). These rules are applicable to the present proceedings by virtue of
paragraph 63 of the ToA, which provides that this arbitration shall be governed by (i)
the procedural rules set out in the BIT; (ii) the mandatory rules of the law on
international arbitration applicable at the seat of the arbitration, i.e., London; (iii) the
ToA, PO1 and any subsequent procedural order; and (iv) the SCC Rules.

1. International law

Subject to the Achmea Objection, the Parties do not dispute that the Treaty, including
the Tribunal’s jurisdiction provided in Article 9, is governed by international law. They
are obviously correct.

The Tribunal will therefore review the application of the principles of res judicata and
functus officio from the perspective of international law. In doing so, it will seek
guidance from any relevant decisions of international courts and tribunals. It will,
however, exercise caution when assessing ICSID decisions and awards, because of
the specificity of the ICSID regime reflected in Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention
and ICSID Arbitration Rule 47,7°7 which require final awards to deal with every
question submitted to the tribunal, including jurisdictional objections that had already
been resolved in an interim decision on jurisdiction.

This specificity was emphasized, for example, in Burlington v. Ecuador:?**

The Tribunal agrees with the tribunal in SCB v. Tanesco when it states that
a preaward decision does not carry res judicata effects, for reasons
essentially connected to the structure or architecture of the ICSID
Convention. First, apart from orders on procedural matters under Article 44
and under other rules dealing with the organization of the proceedings and
other than isi on p the ICSID

contemplates that arbitration proceedings give rise only to (i) one decision
on preliminary objections, if such objections are raised and are not joined

Article 44 of the ICSID Convention provides that, generally, any arbitration proceeding under the ICSID
Convention are conducted in accordance with the Arbitration Rules. Rule 41 of the Arbitration Rules
gives ICSID tribunals the power to consider, on their own initiative, “whether the dispute or any ancillary
claim before it is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and within its own competence,” at any stage of the
proceeding. Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention as well as Rule 47 of the Arbitration Rules require that
the final award “shall deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal”, including any jurisdictional
objections raised by the Parties.

to the merits (Arbitration Rule 41(4)), and to (ii) one (final) award (Article

48 ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules 46 ff.). It provides further that

the award must deal with “every question submitted to the Tribunal” (Article

48(3)) and contain the “decision of the Tribunal on every question

submitted to it” (Arbitration Rule 47(1)(i)). To comply with these provisions,

the practice is for tribunals to incorporate earlier decisions into their (final)

award.
The Tribunal will keep this key particularity in mind when assessing the ICSID
decisions and awards as part of the broader legal framework governing res judicata

and functus officio.

2. English law

Itis common ground that the present arbitration is seated in London; that the Decision
on Jurisdiction was rendered in London; and that the scope of the Tribunal's
jurisdiction was determined by the English High Court. It is not disputed either that the
choice of the judicial seat of the arbitration triggers the application of the rules of the
seat that govern i ional arbitrations. T! in ing it's the princip

of res judicata and functus officio, the Tribunal will rely, in addition to international law,

 

on the relevant provisions of the EAA and seek guidance from the decisions of English

courts.

3. SCC Rules

. Institutional arbitration rules apply when the parties have submitted their arbitration to

such rules and to the extent that they are not in conflict with the mandatory arbitration
laws of the seat.

This arbitration is subject to the SCC Rules, which merely provide that awards are
final and binding on the parties.22°

4. Conclusion

To conclude, the Tribunal will apply international law, English law and the SCC Rules
in its assessment of whether it is functus officio and the Decision on Jurisdiction is res
judicata. Doing so, it will seek to reconcile the application of these rules to avoid a
conflict, if any.

Article 40 of the SCC Rules provides as follows: “An award shall be final and binding on the parties when
rendered. By agreeing to arbitration under these Rules, the parties undertake to carry out any award
without delay"

b. Is the Tribunal functus officio?

(i) The Position of the Parties and of the EC

1. Claimant

The Claimant contends that neither the SCC Rules nor English law permit the Tribunal
to “revisit” the Decision on Jurisdiction. In this respect, the Claimant mostly relies on
Article 40 of the SCC Rules*° and Section 58(1) of the EAA,2*' which stipulate that
arbitral awards are final and binding upon the Parties.

The Claimant further argues that if arbitral tribunals were able to examine new
jurisdictional objections after an award on jurisdiction was rendered, the purpose of
Article 40 of the SCC Rules regarding the finality of arbitral awards?4? would be
frustrated.?** In this context, the Claimant relies on Novenergia II v. Spain, where the
tribunal ruled that “upon rendering of the final award the arbitral tribunal becomes
functus officio with no lingering power to determine any issues in dispute between the
parties”.2“* As opposed to the Respondent, the Claimant identifies no resemblance
between Article 40 of the SCC Rules concerning the finality of arbitral awards*** and
Article 41 of the ICSID Convention concerning the principle of competence-
competence.74¢

. Unlike the EC, the Claimant fails to see a similarity between Article 4024” and Article

25 of the SCC Rules.™* [t agrees with the EC that Article 25 of the SCC Rules allows
the Parties to amend their claims, but argues that the Achmea Objection does not

Supra, fn, 157.

According to Article 41 of the ICSID Convention, “Any objection by a party to the dispute that that dispute
is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre, or for other reasons is not within the competence of the
Tribunal, shall be considered by the Tribunal which shall determine whether to deal with it as a preliminary
question or to join it to the merits of the dispute."

Supra, fn. 157.

According to Article 25 of the SCC Rules: "At any time prior to the close of proceedings pursuant
to Article 34, a party may amend or supplement its claim, counterclaim, defence or set-off
provided its case, as amended or supplemented, is still comprised by the arbitration agreement,
unless the Arbitral Tribunal considers it inappropriate to allow such amendment or supplement having
regard to the delay in making it, the prejudice to the other party or any other circumstances.”

246.

qualify as an “amendment” of a claim and, moreover, falls squarely outside the scope
of the Arbitration Agreement.”4°

In addition to the SCC Rules, the Claimant underlines that English law too precludes
the Tribunal from reconsidering the Decision on Jurisdiction. It invokes the principle
of finality of arbitral awards enshrined in Section 58(1) of the EAA, 75° and relies on
the principle of functus officio, extensively discussed by English courts in Emirates
Trading v. Fomento**' and Fidelitas v. Exportchleb.?5? In view of that principle, the
Tribunal's mandate to rule upon its jurisdiction expired when the Decision on
Jurisdiction was issued.26*

For the Claimant, none of the exceptions to the functus officio rule contained in
Section 57(3) of the EAA? are relevant in the present case.2°5 Thus, at this stage,
the Respondent can only challenge jurisdiction in front of the courts of the seat of the
arbitration.25°

2. Respondent

The Respondent argues that neither international law nor the SCC Rules deprive the
Tribunal from its power to ider the Ach Objecti an ir
tribunal has the inherent power to verify its jurisdiction under the applicable treaty at

 

 

 

any stage of the proceedings. According to the Respondent, “[s]uch inherent power
can be always exercised even in the absence of a specific statutory provision”.25”

The Respondent further submits that Article 40 of the SCC Rules?** does not bar the
Tribunal from reconsidering the scope of its jurisdiction. For the Respondent, Article

not dealt with in the award. These powers shall not be exercised without first affording the other parties
a reasonable opportunity to make representations to the tribunal.”

which permits the review of a tribunal's jurisdiction at any time.2"

For completeness, the Tribunal also notes that the Respondent disputes that English
law plays a role in this context, and thus has made no submissions on the principle of
functus officio under such law.

3. The EC

The EC opines that the Tribunal is competent to revisit the Decision on Jurisdiction
under English law and the SCC Rules.

First, in respect of English law, the EC states that Sections 30°? and 317% of the EAA
“confer the power on the Tribunal to rule on its own jurisdiction”. In the EC’s view,
these provisions do not limit the powers of the Tribunal to do so “to one sole occasion”,
as Sections 30 and 31 of the EAA?* expressly contemplate the possibility that
“supervening issues of jurisdiction could arise”*°> and that a tribunal may decide an
objection to its jurisdiction, in the award on the merits.

ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4, Decision on Jurisdiction of 1 December 2000 (RLA-248), § 169.

Section 30 of the EAA holds that: (1)Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the arbitral tribunal may
rule on its own substantive jurisdiction, that is, as to - (a) whether there is a valid arbitration agreement,
(b) whether the tribunal is properly constituted, and (c) what matters have been submitted to arbitration
in accordance with the arbitration agreement. (2)Any such ruling may be challenged by any available
arbitral process of appeal or review or in accordance with the provisions of this Part.”

Section 31 of the EAA reads as follows in the relevant part: “An objection that the arbitral tribunal lacks
‘substantive jurisdiction at the outset of the proceedings must be raised by a party not later than the time
he takes the first step in the proceedings to contest the merits of any matter in relation to which he
challenges the tribunal's jurisdiction... (2) Any objection during the course of the arbitral proceedings that
the arbitral tribunal is exceeding its substantive jurisdiction must be made as soon as possible after the
matter alleged to be beyond its jurisdiction is raised. (3) The arbitral tribunal may admit an objection later
than the time specified in subsection (1) or (2) if it considers the delay justified. (4) Where an objection
is duly taken to the tribunal's substantive jurisdiction and the tribunal has power to rule on its own
jurisdiction, it may — (a) rule on the matter in an award as to jurisdiction, or (b) deal with the objection in
its award on the merits.”

The EC further notes that Section 58 of the EAA”® provides that the finality of arbitral
awards is subject to challenge by any available arbitral process of appeal or review.7°”
It concludes that the Respondent's right to bring a further challenge has not been
exhausted and therefore the Tribunal is not functus officio in this respect. 76°

Second, when it comes to the SCC Rules, the EC submits that Article 25 allows the
Tribunal to revisit its jurisdiction, *°° as it permits the Parties to amend and supplement
their claims.?”°

The EC provides no opinion on the application of functus officio under international
law.

(ii) Analysis

1. International law

Having considered the decisions of international tribunals cited by the Claimant and
the EC, the Tribunal finds little guidance on the application of the principle of functus
officio under international law, especially in circumstances similar to the present ones.
It emerges, however, from the cases to which the Claimant refers that investment
treaty tribunals consider themselves functi officio only after they have rendered a final
award.

The Claimant cites Novenergia II v. Spain, which held that:271

...upon rendering of the final award the arbitral tribunal becomes functus

officio with no lingering power to determine any issues in dispute between

the parties.
The Claimant also refers to Gold Reserve v, Venezuela, which described certain
exceptions to the principle of functus officio. In addition to the correction of the award
provided in Article 56 of the ICSID Convention, the Gold Reserve tribunal mentioned
the interpretation of an award and the issuance of an additional award:

There are two other Articles in this Chapter providing for the Tribunal's
intervention following the rendering of the Award: Article 55, dealing with

276

“Interpretation of the Award”, and Article 57, dealing with “Supplementary

Decisions". The three provisions represent exceptions to the principle,

recognized by most national legal systems, according to which the arbitral

tribunal is “functus officio" once it has rendered the award, meaning that it

has no further power to revisit the award”. 2”
The Tribunal notes that in both cases the principle of functus officio applied because
the tribunals had rendered their final awards, which resolved all claims before them.
In Novenergia II v. Spain the principle of functus officio was discussed in light of the
Claimant's request for rectification, clarification and complement of the final award. 27°
In Gold Reserve v. Venezuela the same principle was analysed in light of the Parties’
joint request for correction of the award.?% It is indeed generally accepted that a
tribunal having rendered its final award still has the power to correct or interpret that
award or to issue an additional award on claims raised in the arbitration but omitted
from the final award.2’5

However, this is not the situation faced here. By the time the Respondent raised the
Achmea Objection, the Tribunal had not yet rendered the final award and its mandate
to resolve the dispute between the Parties remained in force. Hence, the Tribunal was
not functus officio under international law, because it had not resolved all claims
before it, and had not delivered a final award.

2. English law

The Tribunal notes that English law recognises the principle of functus officio. As
clarified by several decisions of the English courts, the principle applies only to
matters that have been considered and resolved by arbitral tribunals.

For instance, in Fidelitas v. Exportchleb, the English Court of Appeal held that:

Once his final award is made, whether or not stated in the form of a special
case, the arbitrator himself becomes functus officio as respects all the
issues between the parties unless his jurisdiction is revived by the court's
exercise of its power to remit the award to him for his reconsideration.?7°

278

279

and concluded that:

... the arbitrator is functus officio as respects the issues to which his interim
award relates.?77

A similar finding was made by the English High Court in Emirates v. Fomento:

The second consequence of an award being binding is that, subject to
limited exceptions, the tribunal no longer has power to review or reconsider
the subject matter of the award. There is a longstanding rule of common
law that when an arbitrator makes a valid award, his authority as an
arbitrator comes to an end and, with it, his powers and duties in the
reference: he is then said to be functus officio.””*

Importantly, the English High Court specified that:

The principles of issue estoppel, and the functus doctrine, meant that it

was not open to the Tribunal to revisit the question of jurisdiction on the

same grounds of objection as previously advanced. 27°
Thus, under English law, an arbitral tribunal which has not issued a final award is not
functus in respect of an issue within its jurisdiction that was not decided or otherwise

ruled upon.

The Claimant contends that Sections 58 and 31 of the EAA prevent the Tribunal from
considering the Achmea Objection. However, Section 58 of the EAA merely provides
that “an award made by the tribunal pursuant to an arbitration agreement is final and
binding [...] on the parties”. This provision thus concerns the operation of res judicata,
rather than functus officio.

Conversely, Section 31 of the EAA is relevant for the present purposes and it provides
as follows:

(1) An objection that the arbitral tribunal lacks substantive jurisdiction at the
outset of the proceedings must be raised by a party not later than the time
he takes the first step in the proceedings to contest the merits of any matter
in relation to which he challenges the tribunal's jurisdiction [...]

(2) Any objection during the course of the arbitral proceedings that the
arbitral tribunal is exceeding its substantive jurisdiction must be made as
soon as possible after the matter alleged to be beyond its jurisdiction is
raised.

(3) The arbitral tribunal may admit an objection later than the time specified
in subsection (1) or (2) if it considers the delay justified.

265,

266.

267.

280

(4) Where an objection is duly taken to the tribunal's substantive jurisdiction
and the tribunal has power to rule on its own jurisdiction, it may —

(a) rule on the matter in an award as to jurisdiction, or
(b) deal with the objection in its award on the merits.

Section 31 thus gives arbitral tribunals the power to consider a “belated” jurisdictional
objection, provided the arbitral tribunal considers the delay to be justified. Moreover,
it allows an arbitral tribunal to join an objection to its substantive jurisdiction to the
merits.

The Parties do not contest the applicability of Section 31 of the EAA, and rightly so as
Section 31 of the EAA is a mandatory provision, which applies to the present case
irrespective of the fact that the Tribunal's jurisdiction was modified by the English
Court. This is in line with Section 71(2) of the EAA, which provides that “[w]here the
award is varied, the variation has effect as part of the tribunal's award”,

The Tribunal first recalls that the Decision on Jurisdiction resolved the Respondent's
objections regarding the existence of an investment and the scope of the Arbitration
Agreement. As varied by the English High Court, it determined that the Tribunal had
jurisdiction over the claims arising out of Articles 3 and 4 of the Treaty.

At that time, neither Party questioned the validity of the Arbitration Agreement before
the Tribunal or the English Court. Consequently, no express determination was made
on the validity of the Arbitration Agreement.

. The Claimant submits that, even though the Parties did not argue the validity of the

Arbitration Agreement, this issue was determined in the operative part of the English
High Court's judgment by necessary implication. The Claimant highlights the following
paragraphs of the English Court Judgment:?#°

ji) The Tribunal has jurisdiction over:

(a) All of the factual matters, actions, allegations and/or measures relied
upon in support of the Claimant's claim of direct and/or indirect
expropriation contrary to Article 4.1 of the BIT, which claim is pleaded at
paragraphs 466-479 of the Statement of Claim dated 18 September 2015
(which in turn cross-refers to the entirety of the factual allegations set out
earlier in the Statement of Claim);

(b) All of the factual matters, actions, allegations and/or measures relied
upon in support of the Claimant's claim of breach of fair and equitable

treatment contrary to Article 3.1 of the BIT, which claim is pleaded at
paragraphs 480-507 of the Statement of Claim (which in turn cross-refers

English High Court Judgment (C-272), § 144.

55

to the entirety of the factual allegations set out in earlier in the Statement
of Case).

269. One might argue that jurisdiction was affirmed and that any such affirmatior

o

necessarily implies a finding that the arbitration agreement is valid, because otherwise
there could be no jurisdiction. This is particularly so when jurisdiction is based on a
treaty and, as a consequence, the Tribunal must assess its jurisdiction ex officio even
where no defence of lack of jurisdiction is raised. Be this as it may, in the present
situation, the English High Court has expressly stated that the Achmea Objection was
not part of its decision:

MR SHACKLETON: My Lord, the suggestion is that you postpone your

judgment until after 6" March. Why it is made this late, as my friend puts

it, is because the European Court diarised the delivery of its judgment in
the Achmea matter that same week.

MR JUSTICE BRYAN: Yes, but, | mean, it's no part of this decision, it's
nothing to do with what has been argued before me.

MR SHACKLETON: | agree, my Lord.

In addition, as will be further discussed, the Tribunal notes Sections 31(3) and (4)
quoted above, which allow it to admit a belated jurisdictional objection and to join it to
the merits.

As a result, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that is not functus officio under
English law.

3. SCC Rules

The Claimant also argues that the Tribunal is functus officio pursuant to Article 40 of
the SCC Rules, The Tribunal notes that this provision merely recognises the final and
binding nature of arbitral awards, which relates to the principle of res judicata rather
than to functus officio. The Tribunal will therefore analyse Article 40 as a part of the
analysis of res judicata.

4. Conclusion

Under the three sets of applicable rules, the Tribunal is not functus officio. It must thus
assess whether the Achmea Objection is res judicata.

c. Is the Achmea Objection precluded by res judicata?

(i) The Position of the Parties and of the EC

1. Claimant

The Claimant argues that the Achmea Objection is barred by res judicata under both
English2** and international law. ?®* Therefore, jurisdiction as determined by the
Tribunal and modified by the English Court cannot be reconsidered.?°3

The Claimant emphasizes that the Decision on Jurisdiction determines that the
Tribunal has jurisdiction over the claims arising out of Articles 3 and 4 of the Treaty.
The necessary implication of that decision is that the Treaty and the Arbitration
Agreement are valid. The Achmea Objection, which pertains to the validity of the
Treaty, was therefore implicitly resolved in the earlier stage of the proceedings,?**

As to English law, the Claimant argues that the principle of res judicata has two
strands — cause of action estoppel and issue estoppel.?°° Cause of action estoppel
applies where the cause of action in the subsequent proceedings between the same
parties is identical to that in the earlier proceedings.”°5 Issue estoppel applies where
the issue in the subsequent proceedings between the same parties is identical to that
in the earlier proceedings, but the causes of action are different.

The Claimant submits that cause of action estoppel is applicable in the present case,
because the Respondent attempts to re-litigate the same claim (i.e., that the Tribunal
lacks jurisdiction) before the same Tribunal.?67

In respect of international law, the Claimant maintains that the Respondent cannot
raise the Achmea Objection, because jurisdiction has been decided, expressly or by

necessary implication, and res judicata attaches to this decision.7** According to the
Claimant, the principle of res judicata does not apply only to matters that were
expressly reserved for Jater decision, 78° which is not the case of the Achmea
Objection.

2. Respondent

In the Respondent's view, the Tribunal is not precluded from hearing the Achmea
Objection by the principle of res judicata.

First, the Respondent argues that jurisdictional issues are not subject to the principle
of res judicata.?®° In support, it cites to several [CSID awards, which held that under
the ICSID Convention jurisdictional decisions become res judicata only after they are
incorporated into final awards. 7°" Similarly, the Award on Jurisdiction lacks the force
of res judicata.

Second, the Respondent contends that under international law the principle of res
judicata applies when (i) the triple identity test (i.e. same parties, same legal ground,
and same relief) is satisfied; and (ii) the matter alleged to be res judicata had been
raised and definitively settled, directly or by necessary implication.2° The Respondent

argues that the Achmea Objection is not precluded by res judicata, because it is “a
new matter”, which was not resolved by either the Tribunal or the English Court, either

pressly or impliedly. 2°? M ; ding to the R dent, the Achi
Objection is based on “a different legal ground”, /.e. the relevant provisions of EU law
as interpreted and applied by the CJEU in the Achmea Judgment. 74

 

 

3. The EC

The EC observes that the principle of res judicata applies to jurisdictional issues “just
as it applies to determinations on merits”.2°° Therefore, the Decision on Jurisdiction
could be res judicata if the prerequisites are satisfied.

Second, the EC agrees with the Respondent that the principle of res judicata applies
if (i) the triple identity test is met; and (ii) the matter alleged to have the force of res
judicata had been raised and definitively resolved in the prior proceedings.?% Since
the Achmea Objection has not been addressed or resolved by the Tribunal or the
English High Court, the principle of res judicata does not preclude the Tribunal from
considering the objection,?°7

(ii) Analysis
1. International law

The meaning of res judicata under international law is reflected in the
recommendation of the International Law Association (ILA), upon which the Claimant
relies. According to the ILA, res judicata is “[t]he general doctrine that an earlier and
final adjudication by a court or arbitration tribunal is conclusive in subsequent
proceedings involving the same subject matter or relief, the same legal grounds and
the same parties (the so-called “triple-identity” criteria)”.°* The ILA further explains
that res judicata has “a positive effect (namely, that a judgment or award is final and
binding between the parties and should be implemented, subject to any available
appeal or challenge); and, a negative effect (namely, that the subject matter of the

judgment or award cannot be re-litigated a second time, also referred to as ne bis in
idem)’ .?89

The Parties disagree whether awards on jurisdiction carry res judicata. The Claimant
argues in favour, while the Respondent cites to several ICSID awards to support the
opposite view. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant and inter alia the Oostergetel
tribunal®°° that jurisdictional awards, similarly to awards on the merits, have res
judicata effects under international law. EU law also recognises that jurisdictional
awards have res judicata effect and may not “be called in question by a subsequent
arbitration award, even if this is necessary in order to examine” the validity of the
parties’ arbitration agreement under EU law.*°' ICSID awards constitute an exception
to this general rule, because, as already discussed above,” the ICSID Convention
contains unique rules on the force of jurisdictional awards, which cannot be
transposed to non-ICSID awards.

Therefore, the Decision on Jurisdiction, which was rendered outside the framework of
the ICSID Convention, has res judicata effect under international law. The next
question is thus whether the Achmea Objection is precluded by the res judicata effect
of the Decision on Jurisdiction.

The Parties agree that the principle of res judicata applies, if the so-called “triple
identity” test is satisfied, which requires the identity of parties (personae), object
(petitum) and cause of action (causa petendi). The Parties also agree that this test
presupposes that the issue alleged to have res judicata effect must have been

 

decided by the earlier adjudi body, be it exp’ ly or by y imp! 1,303
The ICJ in Costa Rica v. Nicaragua has recently addressed this requirement:

However, for res judicata to apply in a given case, the Court “must
determine whether and to what extent the first claim has already been
definitively settled” (ibid., p. 126, paragraph 59), for “[i]f a matter has not in
fact been determined, expressly or by necessary implication, then no force
of res judicata attaches to it" (ibid., paragraph 60, quoting Application of
the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of

There is no dispute, and rightly so, that, the Achmea Objection is raised between the
same parties (i.e. the Claimant and the Respondent) and relates to the same subject
matter (i.e. the Tribunal’s jurisdiction). Therefore, the first two prongs of the triple
identity test are satisfied.

The Parties disagree, however, on the identity of the cause of action or legal basis of
the claim. The Claimant maintains that the Achmea Objection is based on the Treaty,
similarly to other jurisdictional objections raised by the The R

replies that the legal basis of the Achmea Objection is EU law, rather than the Treaty.
The Tribunal finds the Claimant's position more convincing. The legal basis of the
Respondent's objection is the Treaty, rather than EU law, because the Achmea
Objection challenges the validity of Article 9 of the Treaty and the Tribunal's

jurisdiction stemming from this provision.

The Parties also hold different views on whether the Achmea Objection was resolved
in the Decision on Jurisdiction. The Claimant maintains that the Decision on
Jurisdiction determined the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to hear the claims arising out of
Articles 3 and 4 of the Treaty, and that this determination necessarily implies that the
Arbitration Agreement underlying the Tribunal's jurisdiction is valid. The Respondent
argues that the Achmea Objection was not and could not have been resolved in the
Decision on Jurisdiction, since the Achmea Judgment was rendered afterwards.

The Tribunal has already noted that the Decision on Jurisdiction did not deal with the
Achmea Objection or the objection of lack of jurisdiction based on intra-EU investment
treaties more generally, because that objection was not debated or decided, as
Justice Bryan expressly stated, 3°5

2. English law

Similarly to international law, English law recognises the positive and negative effects
of res judicata. The positive effect of res judicata, i.e. the principle of finality of arbitral
awards, is contained in Section 58 of the EAA, which reads as follows:

Maritime Delimitation in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua) and Land
Boundary in the Northern Part of the Isla Portillos (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua) (CLA-333), § 68.

See paragraph 269 of the Award.

a

a

Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, an award made by the tribunal
pursuant to an arbitration agreement is final and binding both on the parties
and on any persons claiming through or under them.
The negative effect of the principle of res judicata has been discussed by the English
courts as part of issue estoppel and cause of action estoppel. For instance, in Virgin
Atlantic Airways v. Zodiac Seats, the court held that:
Where the existence or non-existence of a cause of action has been
decided in earlier proceedings, to allow a direct challenge to the
outcome, even in changed circumstances and with material not
available before, offends the core policy against the re-litigation of
identical claims.°
Similarly to the principle of res judicata under international law, the principle of finality
of arbitral awards and issue estoppel under English law apply to questions that have
been definitively resolved. In this respect, the Tribunal relies on the findings of the
English High Court in Emirates v. Fomento which held that arbitral awards are final
and give rise to issue estoppel only “as to what [they] decid[e]".°°” Consequently, if an
issue has not been determined by an arbitral tribunal, it cannot be subject to the
principle of finality of arbitral awards or issue estoppel.

3. SCC Rules

The Tribunal notes that Article 40 of the SCC Rules contains the principle of finality of
arbitral awards, which reflects the positive effect of res judicata:

An award shall be final and binding on the parties when rendered. By

agreeing to arbitration under these Rules, the parties undertake to

carry out any award without delay.
The SCC Rules contain no provision indicating that the SCC regime would differ from
the principle of finality of arbitral awards under international law or English law. A
possible argument could be made that, under the SCC Rules, a jurisdictional objection
cannot be raised later than the outset of the arbitration and, therefore, a jurisdictional
decision establishes jurisdiction even for matters not addressed therein. Whether that
argument would be correct or not, can be left open for present purposes. Indeed,
Section 31 EEA, which is a mandatory rule of the /ex arbitri, would in any event prevail
over the chosen institutional arbitration rules.

Nn

For the sake of completeness, the Tribunal also notes that it disagrees with the
Respondent's argument that Article 40 of the SCC Rules operates similarly to Article
25 of the SCC Rules and Article 41 of the ICSID Convention.

According to Article 25 of the SCC Rules:

At any time prior to the close of proceedings pursuant to Article 34, a party

may amend or supplement its claim, counterclaim, defence or set-off

provided its case, as amended or supplemented, is still comprised by the

arbitration agreement, unless the Arbitral Tribunal considers it

inappropriate to allow such amendment or supplement having regard to

the delay in making it, the prejudice to the other party or any other

circumstances.
!n the Tribunals view, the content of Article 40 and Article 25 of the SCC Rules is
vastly different: the former contains the principle of finality of arbitral awards, while the
latter refers to the amendment of claims. These two provisions thus operate
differently, and, in any event, Article 25 of the SCC Rules is irrelevant to the Tribunal's
analysis of the Achmea Objecti it permits ing and su

claims, rather than jurisdictional objections.
As to Article 41 of the ICSID Convention, it reads as follows:

Any objection by a party fo the dispute that that dispute is not within the

jurisdiction of the Centre, or for other reasons is not within the competence

of the Tribunal, shall be considered by the Tribunal which shall determine

whether to deal with it as a preliminary question or to join it to the merits of

the dispute.
The content of Article 40 of the SCC Rules and Article 41 of the |CSID Convention is
also different: the former contains the principle of finality of arbitral awards, while the
latter refers to the principle of competence-competence, which allows ICSID tribunals
to decide on their jurisdiction being specified that they can do so as a preliminary
matter or together with the merits. In reality, the counterpart of Article 40 of the SCC
Rules is found in Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention, which provides that awards
“shall be binding on the parties”. As explained earlier,*°* this rule only applies to final
awards, a specificity of the ICSID regime which is of no relevance here.

4. Conclusion

To conclude, in accordance with the applicable law the Tribunal is not preciuded from
analysing the Achmea Objection at this stage of the proceedings.

d. Has the Respondent lost its right to raise the Achmea Objection under English
law?

(i) The Position of the Parties and of the EC

1. Claimant

The Claimant submits that the Respondent has lost its right to challenge the Tribunal's
substantive jurisdiction pursuant to Sections 67(1), °°? 70(3)51° and 73(1)5"' of the
EAA.3" It argues that the Respondent has no excuse for failing to raise the Achmea
Objection before the Tribunal or the English Court at the appropriate time.

304. The Claimant underlines that the intra-EU objection was well known at the time of the

ne

 

of these p! ings on 4 D ber 2014, as it had been raised by
different States in previous arbitral proceedings and had been addressed in a number
of public awards.*"3 In particular, the Claimant observes that Poland itself raised the
Achmea Objection in PL Holdings v. Poland*"* “at the same time as the jurisdictional
phase of the present arbitration”.*1*

Section 67(1) of the EAA stipulates that: “A party to arbitral proceedings may (upon notice to the other
parties and to the tribunal) apply to the court - (a)challenging any award of the arbitral tribunal as to its
substantive jurisdiction; or (b) for an order declaring an award made by the tribunal on the merits to be
of no effect, in whole or in part, because the tribunal did not have substantive jurisdiction. A party may
lose the right to object (see section 73) and the right to apply is subject to the restrictions in section 70(2)
and (3).”

According to Section 70(3) of the EAA: “Any application or appeal must be brought within 28 days of the
date of the award or, if there has been any arbitral process of appeal or review, of the date when the
applicant or appellant was notified of the result of that process.”

Section 73(1) of the EAA reads in the relevant part as follows: “If a party to arbitral proceedings takes
part, or continues to take part, in the proceedings without making, either forthwith or within such time as
is allowed by the arbitration agreement or the tribunal or by any provision of this Part, any objection - (a)
that the tribunal lacks substantive jurisdiction [...] he may not raise that objection later, before the tribunal
or the court, unless he shows that, at the time he took part or continued to take part in the proceedings,
he did not know and could not with reasonable diligence have discovered the grounds for the objection.

og

The Claimant thus concludes that the Respondent lost its right to raise the Achmea
Objection, as it could and should have done so earlier. *1°

2. Respondent

The Respondent replies that it never waived its right to raise the Achmea Objection.
On the contrary, the Respondent explicitly reserved its right to do so during the
teleconference between the Tribunal and the Parties, which took place in February
2018.51”

The Respondent argues that the Achmea Judgment is a “new development of law”,
which is why it could not have presented such objection earlier.*"*

3. The EC

The EC’s view is that the Respondent did not waive the Achmea Objection. First, the
Respondent expressly reserved the right to invoke the objection during the English
Court proceedings.?1*

Second, according to Section 72 of the EAA,*”° a party loses the right to challenge
jurisdiction only if it fails to avail itself of the appropriate avenues. In the EC’s view,
this is not the Respondent's case.°2"

Finally, the EC suggests that denying the Respondent an opportunity to put forward
the Achmea Objection would amount to denial of the citizen's right of access to a court
under Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights*?? and common law
principles.°2°

Section 72 of the EAA provides in the relevant part as follows: *(1) A person alleged to be a party to

declaration or injunction or other appropriate relief.”

(ii) Analysis

The Claimant argues that the Respondent forfeited its right to object to the validity of
the Arbitration Agreement under English law because the Achmea Objection was
untimely. In support, the Claimant refers to Section 67(1)(b) of the EAA, which in
pertinent part reads as follows:

A party may lose the right to object (see section 73) and the right to apply

is subject to the restrictions in section 70(2) and (3).
The Claimant also argues that the Respondent may raise the Achmea Objection only
if it satisfies the test of Section 73 of the EAA,°4 i.e. it proves that it “did not know and
could not with reasonable diligence have discovered the grounds”*”' for the Achmea
Objection. The relevant part of Section 73 of the EAA provides as follows:

(1) Ifa party to arbitral proceedings takes part, or continues to take part, in

the proceedings without making, either forthwith or within such time as is

allowed by the arbitration agreement or the tribunal or by any provision of
this Part, any objection—

(a) that the tribunal lacks substantive jurisdiction,

(1

he may not raise that objection later, before the tribunal or the court, unless
he shows that, at the time he took part or continued to take part in the
proceedings, he did not know and could not with reasonable diligence have
discovered the grounds for the objection.

(2) Where the arbitral tribunal rules that it has substantive jurisdiction and
a party to arbitral proceedings who could have questioned that ruling —

(a) by any available arbitral process of appeal or review, or
(b) by challenging the award,

does not do so, or does not do so within the time allowed by the arbitration
agreement or any provision of this Part, he may not object later to the
tribunal's substantive jurisdiction on any ground which was the subject of
that ruling.

The Claimant submits that the Respondent could have objected to the validity of the
Arbitration Agreement earlier, as it did in other arbitrations.°*° By failing to do so, the
Respondent lost its right to object under Section 73 of the EAA.

a

It is true that the Respondent could have objected to the validity of the Arbitration
Agreement before the CJEU rendered its judgment in the Achmea case. The
Respondent did so in another arbitration.527 In fact, the Respondent could also have
raised the Achmea Objection during the English Court proceedings, but it did not do
so. To be clear, the Respondent did ask Justice Bryan to postpone the delivery of his
judgment until the CJEU makes the decision in the Achmea case; however, it did not
formally raise the Achmea Objection.57°

That said, the Tribunal can understand the Respondent's decision to raise the
Achmea Objection only after the CJEU had delivered its judgment. The compatibility
of intra~-EU BITs with EU law has been extensively debated in EU and investment law
for a long time. In light of this controversy, the Respondent's choice to wait until the
CJEU had finally resolved the issue under EU law was not unreasonable. The
Respondent reserved its rights in connection with the Achmea Objection and raised it
promptly after the CJEU judgment was issued.

On this basis, the Tribunal resorts to its discretionary powers under Section 31 of the
EAA and admits the Achmea Objection.

(iil) Conclusion

To sum up, the Tribunal concludes that it is not functus officio and the Achmea
Objection is not res judicata. The Tribunal also finds that the Respondent did not lose
its right to raise the objection under English law. The Tribunal therefore resorts to its
powers under Section 31 of the EAA and will assess the Achmea Objection in the
present final award on the merits.

2. The Achmea Objection

The Parties agree that Article 9 of the Treaty contains Poland’s consent to arbitrate.
The Parties dispute, however, whether that consent was rendered invalid by Poland's
accession to the EU and its consequent ratification of the TEU and the TFEU (together
the “EU Treaties”).

a. Respondent's Position

As a preliminary remark, the Respondent contends that, when considering the
Achmea Objection, the Tribunal must be guided by the Achmea Judgment,*?° and the
so-called Achmea Declarations signed by 22 Member States on 15 January 2019.9%°
With respect to the Achmea Judgment, the Respondent emphasizes that the CJEU
determined that the dispute ion provisi in the ir treaties

between the EU Member States were contrary to the EU Treaties: °*!

 

Articles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a provision
in an international agreement concluded between Member States, such as
Article 8 of the Agreement on encouragement and reciprocal protection of
investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Czech and
Slovak Federative Republic, under which an investor from one of those
Member States may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in
the other Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State
before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has
undertaken to accept.

. Inthe Respondent's view, the Tribunal should accept the position of the CJEU that

Article 9 of the Treaty is incompatible with EU law and deny jurisdiction.

As to the Achmea Declarations, the Respondent argues that by signing these
declarations Poland and Luxembourg confirmed that Article 9 of the BIT was rendered
inapplicable when the States adhered to the EU Treaties. In the Respondent's view,
the Achmea Declarations constitute an authentic interpretation of Article 9 of the
Treaty within the meaning of Article 31(3)(a) of the VCLT.*? The Respondent argues
that the Achmea Declarations satisfy all requirements of Article 31(3)(a) of the
VCLT,*** because they (i) are written documents; (ii) embody the common intention
of its signatories (including Poland and Luxembourg); and (iii) are signed by duly
authorised representatives. *** Consequently, the Tribunal must accept that Poland

and Luxembourg have expressed that the application of Article 9 of the Treaty is
precluded.

. As regards the substance of the Achmea Objection, the Respondent argues that the

Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the present dispute for four alternative reasons.

First, the Respondent contends that the Treaty was terminated by virtue of Article
59(1) of the VCLT**5 on 1 May 2004, when Poland joined the EU. The Claimant
commenced these proceedings in 2013, many years after the Treaty was
terminated,°** and therefore the Tribunal cannot base its jurisdiction on the arbitration
clause of a treaty that was not in force anymore.

Second, even if the Treaty was not terminated, it is nevertheless inapplicable by virtue
of Article 30(3) of the VCLT**’ as its subject matter overlaps with the subject matter
of the TFEU,*** The Achmea Judgment confirmed that Article 344 of the TFEU, which
obliges EU Member States to submit disputes concerning the interpretation and
application of the EU Treaties exclusively to the CJEU,**? also applies to the disputes
opposing EU Member States to private entities from other EU Member States.
Consequently, there is a direct conflict with Article 9 of the Treaty,**° where EU law

prevails.

Third, the Respondent observes that the Treaty was terminated by Poland on 19 July
2018 through the Note Verbale, 4’ whereby Poland stated its position that the
arbitration agreement enshrined in Article 9 of the Treaty was invalid.*42

Finally, the Respondent puts forward that if the Tribunal does not follow the Achmea
Judgment, it would render an unenforceable award.**? The Respondent refers to the

Achmea,** in order to demonstrate that the Achmea Judgment is a major legal
obstacle to the enforcement proceedings in EU.*47

b. Claimant’s Position

The Claimant maintains that neither the Achmea Judgment nor the Achmea
Declarations are relevant to this Tribunal’s analysis.

In connection with the Achmea Judgment, the Claimant argues that such decision
rendered under EU law has no bearing on whether Article 9 of the Treaty is valid as
a matter of international law.**®

Regarding the Achmea Declarations, the Claimant argues that they bear no relevance
to the merits of the Poland's objections because they cannot be used for the purposes
of interpretation under Articles 31(2)(b)*4° and 31(3)(a) of the VCLT.%°° For the
Claimant, the Achmea Declarations were not made “in connection with the conclusion
of the treaty” nor do they qualify as a “subsequent agreement between the parties”.
In any event, in accordance with Article 31(1) of the VCLT,**' the interpretation of the
Achmea Declarations cannot go against the object and purpose of the Treaty, namely
the protection of investments.3*2
In response to the Respondent's substantive arguments, the Claimant contends that
the Tribunal can ground its jurisdiction on Article 9 of the Treaty for the following three
reasons:
i. Articles 59(1) and Article 30(3) do not apply in the present case and,
alternatively, the Respondent's obligation to resolve the dispute in arbitration
remains in force by virtue of Articles 69(2)(b)5* and 70(1) of the VCLT;

ii. The termination of the Treaty in 2018 is irrelevant for the purposes of the
Tribunal's jurisdiction;

ji. The potential obstacles to the enforcement of the Tribunal’s award are
equally without relevance.

First, the Claimant argues that neither Article 59(1) nor Article 30(3) of the VCLT
render Article 9 of the Treaty inapplicable because “[t]he TFEU, in relation to the BIT,
does not meet the threshold requirements (i) of being the ‘later treaty’, (ii) of relating
to the ‘same subject matter’ under the VCLT, or (iii) of being ‘incompatible’””.*%*

In respect of the “later treaty”, the Claimant argues that, contrary to the Respondent's
contentions, the BIT was adopted after the EU Treaties. In the Claimant's view, the
EU Treaties were de facto adopted on 25 March 1957, in the form of the Treaty

the Europ Economic Com ity, the BIT was signed in
1987. In support of its argument that the EU Treaties were in fact adopted in 1957,
the Claimant refers to the findings of the Vattenfall tribunal and the opinions of
scholars,3** which have stated that Articles 244 and 344 of the TFEU “have existed
[in] substantively similar form [...] and have only been renumbered in the successive

 

versions of the EU Treaties, [...] existing originally [...] in 1957”.95*

Further, the Claimant submits that the TFEU and the Treaty do not deal with the same
subject matter. Relying on the words of the EC, the Claimant argues that “EU law
protects access to the market, operations on the market and retreat from the market’,
while the Treaty offers a comprehensive investment protection scheme, with the
possibility to resort to investor-State arbitration.*5”

Moreover, the Claimant argues that there is no incompatibility between the TFEU and
the BIT, as a matter of international law, because the treaties do not deal with the
same subject matter. In the Claimant's submission, there is no “textual evidence” for
stating that the investor-State arbitration clauses are incompatible with Articles 344
and 267 of the TFEU. ** The alleged incompatibility stems from the CJEU’s
interpretation of the provisions under EU law, which must not be followed by a tribunal
created by virtue of international law.**°

of the VCLT apply in the present case, the Claimant submits that the Respondent's
obligation to arbitrate the present dispute remains in force by virtue of Articles
69(2)(b)*°° and 70(1) of the VCLT.**' This is so because the Claimant triggered the
Respondent's obligation under Article 9 of the Treaty by filing the Request for
Arbitration, which it did in good faith. Thus, its right to arbitrate the present dispute
cannot be affected by the alleged termination of the Treaty.

Second, the Claimant notes that it accepted the Respondent's offer to arbitrate
contained in Article 9 of the BIT by instituting the present proceedings. By virtue of
Article 4 of the SCC Rules,*** this arbitration commenced on 9 December 2014, when
the SCC received the Request for Arbitration. Therefore, the termination of the Treaty
on 19 July 2018 is irrelevant.

Finally, relying on Vattenfall v. Germany,*** Marfin v. Cyprus** and PL Holdings v.
Poland,** the Claimant argues that the difficulties arising at the enforcement stage,
whether perceived or real, cannot constitute grounds for refusing to exercise the
jurisdiction.5®°

c. EC's Position

The EC fully supports the Respondent's position on the application of Article 59 the
VCLT to the present case. It is of the view that the Treaty or at the very least the
Arbitration Agreement was terminated pursuant to that provision*®’ in 2004, when the
Respondent joined the EU. The EC underlines that the types of investments listed in
Article 1 of the Treaty fall within the ambit of fundamental freedoms guaranteed by
EU law. Therefore, since 2004, the investments that were initially regulated by the
Treaty came within the scope of the EU treaties.

In any event, even if the Treaty remains in force, the Arbitration Agreement does not
apply, because it conflicts with EU law (specifically with Article 19 of the TEU%** and
Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU).°®° The incompatibility of the Arbitration Agreement
with EU law was confirmed by the Achmea Declarations. Therefore, the present
arbitration lacks the Respondent's valid consent.

d, = Analysis

. The Parties agree, and rightly so, that the question whether the EU treaties override

Article 9 of the BIT must be assessed under international law. Indeed, the BIT’s offer
to arbitrate is enshrined in an international treaty, and its validity and interpretation is
governed by the VCLT, of which both Luxembourg and Poland are contracting parties.

Before analyzing whether Article 9 of the BIT was rendered inapplicable pursuant to
Articles 30(3) or 59(1) of the VCLT, the Tribunal will first determine the weight to be
given to the Achmea Judgment (i) and the Achmea Declarations (ii).

(i) The relevance of the Achmea Judgment

In the Achmea Judgment of 6 March 2018, the CJEU held that “Articles 267 and 344
[of the TFEU] must be interpreted as precluding a provision in an international
agreement concluded between Member States [...] under which an investor from one
of those Member States may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the
other Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State before an
arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to accept”.57°

. According to the Respondent, the Achmea Judgment is an authentic interpretation of

the EU Treaties. Therefore, it is binding for all EU Member States and investors
established in those states.

Under Section 30 of the EAA, the Tribunal is competent to rule on its own jurisdiction
in with the principle of Kom This provision emp

the Tribunal to independently assess whether the Parties consented to arbitrate the

 

present dispute under Article 9 of the Treaty. Therefore, the Tribunal cannot disregard
this mandate and uncritically follow the CJEU's determination that Article 9 of the
Treaty has been rendered inapplicable under EU law. Rather, it must carry out its own

analysis. In doing so, it will consider the Achmea Judgment and its possible impact
on the Tribunal's jurisdiction without, however, being bound by the CJEU'’s findings.

The Tribunal also observes that the CJEU has no exclusive or ultimate authority to
interpret the Treaty or Articles 59(1) or 30(3) of the VCLT, which are central to the
Respondent's Achmea Objection. The CJEU is competent to interpret and apply the
EU Treaties, as follows from Article 263 of the TFEU *”’ and the CJEU's
jurisprudence.*”2 However, in order to determine whether the Arbitration Agreement
enshrined in Article 9 of the Treaty is inapplicable, the analysis cannot be limited to
the interpretation of the EU Treaties. Interpretation of bofh the EU Treaties and the
Treaty is necessary in order to determine (i) whether the Treaty and the EU Treaties
govern the same subject matter as required by Articles 30(3) and 59(1) of the VCLT
and, if so, (ii) whether there is a normative conflict between these treaties within the
meaning of the VCLT.

The CJEU has no exclusive authority to answer these questions. What is more, it did
not even purport to address them in the Achmea Judgment. The Achmea Judgment
contains no analysis of Articles 30(3) and 59(1) of the VCLT, which have been invoked
by the Parties in the present arbitration. These provisions are indisputably key to the
Tribunal’s analysis of the validity of Article 9 of the BIT as a matter of international
law. The Tribunal finds confirmation of this observation inter alia in the recent case of
United Utilities v. Estonia, according to which the Achmea Judgment “assumef[s] that
the issue must be considered through, and only through, the lens of EU law.”°75

For these reasons, the Tribunal does not consider itself bound by the CJEU’s findings
in the Achmea Judgment, and must perform its own analysis to determine whether
the Respondent's consent to arbitration in Article 9 of the Treaty was valid under
international law at the time the Claimant commenced the present proceedings.

(ii) The relevance of the Achmea Declarations

In January 2019, 23 EU Member States, including Poland and Luxembourg, made
declarations on the legal consequences of the Achmea Judgment, affirming that “all

According to Article 263 of the TFEU, “[the CJEU] shall for this purpose have jurisdiction in actions
brought by a Member State, the European Parliament, the Council or the Commission on grounds of lack
of competence, infringement of an essential procedural requirement, infringement of the Treaties or of
any rule of law relating to their application, or misuse of powers”.

s

investor-State arbitration clauses contained in bilateral investment treaties concluded
between Member States are contrary to Union law and thus inapplicable.”>”* The
Parties dispute the relevance of the Achmea Declarations.

The Respondent argues that the Achmea Declarations must be regarded as a
“subsequent agreement between the parties” under Article 31(3)(a) of the VCLT,
which rendered Article 9 of the Treaty inapplicable between Poland and
Luxembourg. *75 By contrast, the Claimant replies that "subsequent agreements”
within the meaning of Article 31(3)(a) cannot be used in order to defeat the object and
purpose of the Treaty. In its view, interpreting the Achmea Declarations so as to make
Article 9 of the Treaty inapplicable would be contrary to the object and purpose of the
Treaty.376

In the Tribunal’s view, the Achmea Declarations do not qualify as a “subsequent
agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty” in the
meaning of Article 31(3)(a) of the VCLT. The ILC’s 1966 Commentaries on the Draft
VCLT Articles, cited by the Respondent, *”? make it clear that “subsequent
agreements” in the meaning of Article 31(3)(a) of the VCLT relate to understandings
reached by States during negotiations of a relevant treaty.

According to the ILC, "[a] question of fact may sometimes arise as to whether an
understanding reached during the negotiations concerning the meaning of a provision
was or was not intended to constitute an agreed basis for its interpretation." °7° The
Achmea Declarations do not reflect any “understanding” regarding the application of
Article 9 of the BIT reached by Poland and Luxemburg “during the negotiations” of the
BIT. Similarly, they do not indicate any concern regarding the incompatibility between
Article 9 of the Treaty and EU law at the time the Treaty was concluded. Rather, the
Achmea Declarations merely reflect the EU Member States’ political will to terminate
the existing BITs as of 2019.

There is a further reason why the Achmea Declarations do not constitute a joint
interpretation of the Treaty within the meaning of Article 31(3)(a). Their title, i.e. in
relevant part “Declaration [...] on the Legal Consequences of the Judgment of the
Court of Justice in Achmea and on Investment Protection in the European Union,”

suggests that the EU Member States seek to explain the legal consequences of the
Achmea Judgment, rather than interpret the dispute settlement clauses in intra-EU
investment treaties. In reality, the EU Member States, including Poland and
Luxembourg, record their intent to terminate their bilateral investment treaties, thereby
acknowledging that they cannot modify the BITs by a mere declaration:

Member States will make best efforts to deposit their instrument of

ratification, approval or acceptance [...] of any bilateral investment treaty

terminating bilateral investment treaties between Member States no later

than 6 December 2019.
In any event, joint interpretive declarations or agreements are not an exclusive and
dispositive method of treaty interpretation. Pursuant to Article 31(3) of the VCLT, they
are one element that “shall be taken into account, together with the context" of the
relevant treaty terms. What is more, context is itself one of the means of interpretation
under Article 31(1) of the VCLT, together with the ordinary meaning and the object
and purpose of the treaty. Thus, an interpretative declaration, as its name indicates,
can only interpret the treaty terms; it cannot change their meaning.

Here the provision that is purportedly subject to interpretation is Article 9 of the Treaty,
which was already quoted and reads as follows:

Article 9

1. [a)] Any dispute between one of the Contracting Parties and the investor
of the other Contracting Party shall be the subject of a written notification
which shall be accompanied by a detailed aide-mémoire, addressed by the
investor of a Contracting Party to the other Contracting Party. As far as
possible the dispute shall be amicably settled by the parties.

b) As used in this article, the term ‘disputes’ shall mean disputes relating
to expropriation, nationalization or any other similar measures affecting
investments, and notably the transfer of an investment into public property,
placing it under public supervision as well as any other deprivation or
restriction of property rights by state measures that lead to consequences
similar to expropriation.*”9

2. In the absence of an amicable settlement within six months from the
date of the written notification mentioned in section 1, the dispute shall be
submitted, at the investor's choice, to one of the following bodies:

a) the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce;

b) the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes
(ICSID), established under the ‘Convention on the Settlement of
Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States’,
signed in Washington on March 18, 1965, when each state Party to the
present agreement has become a party to the said Convention;

c) an ‘ad hoc’ tribunal, organized in accordance with the rules of the United
Nations Commission on International Trade Law or of the United Nations
Economic Commission for Europe, where the competent authority to

appoint the arbitrator(s) shall be, depending on the investor's choice, the

L.]
5. The arbitral tribunal shall resolve the dispute based on:

- The internal law of that Contracting Party, party to the dispute, on the
territory the investment of which is located, including conflicts of laws
principles,

~ The provisions of this Agreement,

- The terms and conditions of any specific agreement concerning the
investment,

- The rules and principles of international law generally admitted.
The ordinary meaning of the language of this provision leaves no doubt that it contains
Poland's binding consent to arbitrate. If Poland and Luxembourg had intended to
modify the meaning of an international treaty ratified by both of them, issuing an
interpretative declaration of their governments was not a suitable means for achieving
that purpose. If it had been their intent to amend the express language of the BIT, the
States would have chosen a different course.

Had the 2019 Declarations been sufficient to change the BITs, then the envisaged
termination of such treaties would be superfluous. In this respect, the Tribunal agrees
with the tribunal in United Utilities v. Estonia that the language of the 2019
Declarations “necessarily implies [...] that the BIT remains in force and that its Article
9 can therefore constitute a valid offer to arbitrate, which Claimants accepted” .2®°

For all these reasons, the Achmea Declarations are not relevant to the Tribunal’s task

of interpreting Article 9 of the Treaty.

(iii) Was Article 9 of the Treaty rendered inapplicable by Poland’s and
Luxembourg’s accession to the EU Treaties?

The Respondent argues that by virtue of Articles 30(3) and 59(1) of the VCLT, Article
9 of the Treaty was terminated or became inapplicable due to the conflict with Articles
267 and 344 of the TFEU and Article 19(1) of the TEU.*#" In response, the Claimant
submits that the Treaty does not have the same subject matter as the EU Treaties
nor does it contradict the EU Treaties, and therefore the requirements set forth by
Articles 30(3) and 59(1) of the VCLT are not satisfied,5®*

Article 30 of the VCLT provides rules to resolve conflicts between “successive treaties
relating to the same subject matter” and reads as follows:

1. Subject to Article 103 of the Charter of the United Nations, the rights and

obligations of States Parties to successive treaties relating to the same

subject matter shall be determined in accordance with the following
paragraphs.

2. When a treaty specifies that it is subject to, or that it is not to be
considered as incompatible with, an earlier or later treaty, the provisions of
that other treaty prevail.

3. When all the parties to the earlier treaty are parties also to the later treaty
but the earlier treaty is not terminated or suspended in operation under
article 59, the earlier treaty applies only to the extent that its provisions are
compatible with those of the later treaty.

4. When the parties to the later treaty do not include all the parties to the
earlier one:

(a) as between States Parties to both treaties the same rule applies as in

paragraph 3;

(b) as between a State party to both treaties and a State party to only one

of the treaties, the treaty to which both States are parties governs their

mutual rights and obligations. [...]
Article 59(1) of the VCLT applies to the “[tlermination or suspension of the operation
of a treaty implied by conclusion of a later treaty" sharing the “same subject matter’,
and reads as follows:

1. A treaty shall be considered as terminated if all the parties to it
conclude a later treaty relating to the same subject matter and:

(a) it appears from the later treaty or is otherwise established that the
parties intended that the matter should be governed by that treaty; or

(b) the provisions of the later treaty are so far incompatible with those of
the earlier one that the two treaties are not capable of being applied at
the same time.

In application of these provisions, to determine whether the EU Treaties preclude the
application of Article 9 of the Treaty, the Tribunal must examine whether (i) the Treaty
and the EU Treaties have the same subject-matter; and, if so, (ii) whether there exists
a normative conflict between the Arbitration Agreement enshrined in Article 9 of the
Treaty, on the one hand, and Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU and Article 19 of the
TEU, on the other.

1. Same subject-matter
The Parties disagree on the interpretation of the same subject-matter requirement
under Articles 59(3) and 30(3) of the VCLT. The Respondent argues that the Treaty

and the EU Treaties share the same subject, i.e. all of them guarantee certain
standards of protection to investors. The Claimant argues that the standards of

78

protection in the EU Treaties and the BIT are very different, and protection afforded
to investors under the BIT is more favorable.

The requirement of sharing the same subject matter within the meaning of Articles
59(3) and 30(3) of the VCLT should be understood broadly.*® At the same time, it
cannot be reduced to a requirement that the two treaties potentially govern the same
set of factual circumstances, Such a meaning would make the requirement useless.
Indeed, if two treaties do not apply to the same set of circumstances, they cannot
conceivably be in conflict. In other words, even if successive treaties potentially
govern the same facts, they do not necessarily share the same subject matter. This
was, for example, the tribunal's conclusion in EURAM v. Slovak Republic:

Even if two different rules deal with issues arising from the same facts, it

does not necessarily mean that they have the same subject matter. This

can be seen from a simple example: a treaty on environmental protection

and a treaty on trade may both apply to the same factual situation but the

subject matter with which they deal is quite different.2**
Investment treaty tribunals have defined the subject-matter of a treaty by reference to
matters dealt with by the treaty's constituent provisions. For instance, the Oostergete!
tribunal held that:

The requirement [...] that the two treaties relate to the "same subject

matter" has to be construed in line with the dominant view expressed in

scholarly writings to the effect that two treaties can be considered to relate

to the "same subject matter" only if the overall objective of these treaties is

identical and they share a degree of general comparability.2°°
In respect of the EU Treaties, arbitral treaty tribunals have consistently held that
investment treaties do not have the same subject-matter as the EU Treaties.**° By
contrast, the CJEU in Achmea is silent on this issue. Investment tribunals have
repeatedly underscored that, unlike the EU Treaties, investment treaties allow foreign
investors to resort to arbitration. Thus, in the words of the Wirtgen tribunal, “...Article
10 of the Treaty allows an investor to sue a host state. No parallel provision exists in

K. Odendahl, Article 30. Application of successive treaties relating to the same subject matter in Vienna

(CLA-322), 511, § 12.

§ 75.

On this and other issues related to the interaction of the dispute settlement provision in investment
treaties and EU law, the Tribunal is aware of the dissenting opinion of Prof. Marcelo Kohen, in Theodoros
Adamakopoulos and others v. Republic of Cyprus, \CSID Case No. ARB/15/49. While it can state that
‘such dissent did not change its own view, it has not discussed it in this award because it was issued too
late for the Parties to comment on it.

©

the TFEU”.**’ To the same effect, the Eastern Sugar tribunal also held that “the BIT
... provides for a special procedural protection in the form [...] arbitration of a ‘mixed’
or ‘diagonal’ type between the investor and the host state”. The Eastern Sugar tribunal
emphasized that “[flrom the point of view of the promotion and protection of
investments, the arbitration clause is in practice the most essential provision of
Bilateral Investment Treaties,” and added that “EU law does not provide such a

guarantee.”"5®°

In addition, as noted in Magyar v. Hungary, the conditions for the application of
investment treaties and the EU treaties are different:

The application of the BIT is contingent upon an investor of one State
making a cross-border investment in the other State, while the EU Treaties
give guarantees irrespective of the existence of an investment. As a result
of this distinction, “the substantive protections afforded to a foreign investor
under the Treaty are unsurprisingly not comparable to, or of the same
nature as, those offered to the EU nationals under the BIT’?

Finally, the overarching goals of investment treaties and of the EU Treaties are also
different, as noted by the Oostergetel tribunal and further endorsed in Marfin tribunal:

“[T]he Tribunal sees no reason to depart from consistent case law finding
that intra-EU BITs and the EU treaties deal with different subject matters.
... [T]he EU treaties’ objective is to create a common market between the
Member States, whereas the objective of BITs (including the Treaty) is to
provide for specific guarantees in order to encourage the international
flows of investment into particular States...” 9°

As a consequence, the Tribunal sees no reason to depart from the consistent line of
investment treaty awards according to which the EU Treaties and investment treaties
do not share the same subject matter. The consequence is that Articles 30(3) and
59(1) of the VCLT do not apply to decide whether Article 9 of the Treaty is precluded
by the EU Treaties.

The Parties have not pointed to, and the Tribunal is not aware of, provisions in the
VCLT or of norms of customary international law that would govern the resolution of

possible conflicts where successive treaties do not share the same subject matter.
Importantly, pursuant to Article 42(1) of the VCLT, “[t]he validity of a treaty or of the
consent of a State to be bound by a treaty may be impeached only through the
application of the present Convention.” For these reasons, the conclusion that the BIT
and the EU Treaties do not have the same subject matter, and thus that Article 30 of
the VCLT does not apply, leads to the conclusion that the Treaty’s offer to arbitrate
was valid and applicable at the commencement of this arbitration. The Tribunal's
analysis could stop here. However, for the sake of completeness and in view of the
Parties’ extensive submissions on this matter, the Tribunal will also briefly discuss
whether there is a conflict between Article 9 of the BIT and Articles 267 and 344 of
the TFEU and Article 19 of the TEU.

2. Conflict between the BIT and EU law

When States subscribe to successive treaties, without terminating or amending any
of them, the interpreter should seek to give an interpretation of the treaties that avoids
or at least minimizes conflicts of norms.

That position is supported by scholars. So for instance:

There is a general principle under international law whereby the interpreter
tries to smooth out or even to avoid conflict by way of ‘harmonizing
interpretation’ (presumption of non-conflict). This rules is based on the
assumption that when States wanted different rules to be applicable they
could not at the same time have wanted normative contradiction.5%'

Or, as a leading commentary to the VCLT explains:

If apparently conflicting treaty provisions can be interpreted in such a way

that they are compatible with each other, this approach is the first to be

chosen. °°?
This harmonious interpretation should not be understood as a suggestion to ignore
outright conflicts. The Tribunal considers that “an outright conflict arises only where a
Party to the two treaties cannot simultaneously comply with its obligations under both
treaties” °°° or in different words:

Kolb, The Law of Treaties: An introduction (Elgar 2016) 183.

Treaties are incompatible with each other if their obligations cannot be
complied with simultaneously, ie if a State Party to both treaties cannot
comply with one of them without breaching the other.°™*

With this in mind, the Tribunal will analyse whether there is a conflict between Article
9 of the BIT and Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU and Article 19 of the TEU.
Pursuant to Article 344. of the TFEU:
Member States undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the
interpretation or application of the Treaties to any method of settlement

other than those provided for in the Treaties.

This provisi the lution of di b EU Member States in
relation to the interpretation and application of the EU Treaties. It does not limit or

 

prohibit the submission of disputes between a Member State and an investor based
on an investment treaty to adjudicatory bodies other than those provided for in the EU
Treaties.

In line with this distinction, Article 9 of the BIT provides for international arbitration of
“any dispute between one of the Contracting Parties and the investor of the other
Contracting Party”. It does not regulate the settlement of disputes concerning the
interpretation or application of the EU Treaties between EU Member States. It is true
that an arbitral tribunal resolving a dispute in application of an investment treaty may
have to address, as preliminary or incidental issues, matters involving the
interpretation or application of the EU Treaties. Whether such a situation might give
rise to a conflict can be left open, as the claims raised here include no such matters.
In other words, the Tribunal can see no incompatibility between Article 9 of the Treaty
and Article 344 of the TFEU.

The next provision that the Respondent considers to be in conflict with Article 9 of the
BIT is Article 267 of the TFEU, which reads in relevant part as follows:

The Court of Justice of the European Union shall have jurisdiction to give
preliminary rulings concerning:

(a) the interpretation of the Treaties;

(b) the validity and interpretation of acts of the institutions, bodies, offices
or agencies of the Union.

Accordingly, the CJEU has the power to give preliminary rulings concerning the
interpretation of EU law. It is unclear how that conflicts with the Claimant's right to
resort to arbitration under Article 9 of the Treaty. It is true that the CJEU has decided

K. Odendahl, Article 30. Application of successive treaties relating to the same subject matter in Vienna
Convention on the Law of Treaties: A Commentary (O. Dorr and K. Schmalenbach, eds.), Berlin
(CLA-322), 511, § 13,

381,

382.

384.

long ago that arbitral tribunals cannot resort to the CJEU for a preliminary ruling. This
alone does not create a normative conflict between Article 9 of the Treaty and Article
267 of the TFEU. Indeed, the language of Article 267 does not require that EU law
may only be applied by adjudicatory bodies which may themselves, or the higher
instances of which, may seek preliminary rulings from the CJEU. If that were the
meaning of Article 267, the Member States would violate that provision by allowing
commercial arbitration as well as arbitration under extra-EU investment treaties, since
arbitral tribunals constituted under these mechanisms may be called upon to apply
EU law and have no standing to request for preliminary rulings. Similarly, foreign
courts, in the sense of judicial bodies in jurisdictions other than EU Member States,
may also be called to apply and interpret EU law without having access to the CJEU,

In any event, as with Article 344, Article 267 of the TFEU might at most be understood
as a Carve out— as opposed to a complete preclusion — from the subject-matter scope
of Article 9 of the BIT in respect of disputes that relate to the interpretation of the EU
Treaties, or the validity and interpretation of acts of the EU institutions. Here again,
the Tribunal leaves this issue open as the present dispute does not fall in that
category.

Finally, the Respondent argues that Article 9 of the Treaty contradicts “the subsystem
of international law offering a comprehensive, complete and exclusive system of legal
remedies” contained, inter alia, in Article 19 of the TEU.*°* That provision states in the
relevant part as follows:

3. The Court of Justice of the European Union shall, in accordance with
the Treaties: (a) rule on actions brought by a Member State, an institution
or a natural or legal person; (b) give preliminary rulings, at the request of
courts or tribunals of the Member States, on the interpretation of Union law
or the validity of acts adopted by the institutions; (c) rule in other cases
provided for in the Treaties.

. Similarly to Articles 344 and 267 of the TFEU, this provision empowers the CJEU to

resolve disputes in accordance with the EU Treaties. The Claimant's right to arbitrate
disputes arising out of the Treaty does not conflict with the CJEU’s power to resolve
disputes related to the EU Treaties. This is particularly true in this case where no
issues of EU law are before the Tribunal.

(iv) | Conclusion

For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal concludes that, upon the initiation of these
proceedings, the Respondent's offer to arbitrate contained in Article 9 of the Treaty

RS on Achmea, § 34.

83

385

was standing and effective and that a valid arbitration agreement was formed when
the Claimant accepted this offer, by filing the Request for Arbitration in 2015. Neither
the adhesion to the EU Treaties by Poland, nor its unilateral termination of the Treaty
in 2018 after the commencement of the present proceedings render the Parties’
consent invalid. The enforcement concerns voiced by the Respondent similarly do not
render the Parties’ consent invalid.

. The Tribunal thus rejects the Achmea Objection.

3. Clean Hands

386.

387.

388.

389.

. For the sake of completeness, the Tribunal notes that it has considered the
Respondent's argument that the Claimant “failed to uphoid the Polish laws and
regulations” and “acted in a manner manifestly prejudicial to the public interest by
demolishing the historic Barracks”. As a result, the Respondent requests the Tribunal
to find that “the Claimant does not deserve the Treaty protection on the grounds of
the clean hands doctrine.*°*

The Tribunal notes that the Respondent's submissions do not make it clear whether
this objection is one of jurisdiction, admissibility, or merits. In any event, the Tribunal
considers that the demolition of the Barracks pertains to the merits of this dispute.
Therefore, it will analyse these arguments as a part of the claims arising for breach of
Articles 3 and 4.

C. MERITS

. The Claimant alleges that Poland committed several Treaty violations between 2007
and 2014.

According to the Claimant, several Polish authorities, and in particular the Warsaw
Conservator and the City of Warsaw, prevented the development of the Property by
refusing to issue the necessary authorisations.** Its resulting failure to perform the
construction works on the Property, so says the Claimant, was subsequently used by
the Polish courts as a pretext for terminating the PUA in 2014.

390, More specifically, the Claimant makes three more or less independent claims:

397

i, First, the Respondent indirectly expropriated the Claimant's investment by
adopting a number of measures that prevented the development of the

Amended SoD, § 407.
See paragraph 393 of the Award.

Property, which were followed by the 2014 WCA Judgment, culminating in a
breach of Article 4 of the Treaty. In other words, the Claimant's indirect
expropriation claim is based on two cumulative elements: the measures
leading up to the 2014 WCA Judgment and the latter judgment itself;3**

ji. | Second, the Respondent directly expropriated the Claimant's investment by
terminating the PUA by means of the 2014 WCA Judgment in breach of Article
4 of the Treaty. In other words, the Claimant's direct expropriation claim is
based exclusively on the illegality of the 2014 WCA Judgment under
international law;

iii. | Third, the Respondent failed to accord it fair and equitable treatment in breach
of Article 3 of the Treaty, as a result of the Polish authorities’ failure to issue
the relevant authorisations and their overall forestalling of the development of
the Property.

391. For the sake of consistency, the Tribunal will analyse the claims in the sequence
proposed by the Claimant.

1. Indirect Expropriation Claim

a. Claimant’s Position

392. According to the Claimant, the Respondent adopted a “multitude of illegal and
unjustifiable measures” between 2007 and 2014, which, together with the 2014 WCA
Judgment, resulted in an indirect expropriation of the Claimant's investment.2%°

393. More specifically, the Claimant refers to the following measures which, together with
the 2014 WCA Judgment, illegitimately prevented the development of the Property
(the “Prior Measures"):4°°

i. The Respondent did not extend the PUA deadlines, notwithstanding the
obligation to do so under the 2002 Resolution;

ii. The Warsaw Conservator gave recommendations on the development of the
Property between 2006 and 2014, although it had no authority to do so, as its
mandate expired in 2003;

The Warsaw Ci dly cor i its own
and disregarded the Opinion of the National Centre;

The City relied on the Warsaw Conservator's contradictory recommendations
in order to deny WZ decisions in response to 29 Listopada’s requests;

The Museum continuously hindered the development of the Property and
supported the termination of the PUA because of its own selfish interest in
obtaining the Property;

The Warsaw Conservator ordered a halt of the demolition works in 2010
despite the fact that they were being conducted in accordance with the 2005
Building Permit;

The Provincial Conservator unlawfully entered the Barracks into the Register
in 2011, which resulted in lengthy proceedings and several contradictory
decisions by the Polish authorities;

The Warsaw Conservator initiated criminal proceedings with respect to the
demolition of the Barracks, which were subsequently discontinued for lack of
evidence of any criminal offence;

The Warsaw Conservator continuously refused to approve the development
of the Property as proposed by 29 Listopada, as evidenced by its
recommendations issued in 2009, 2011, 2013 and 2014;

The City requested the termination of the PUA, which was unlawfully granted
by the Polish courts of all instances in 2013, 2014 and 2016;

The City favoured the project run by (iiand thus discriminated against
the Claimant.

394. The Claimant argues that the Tribunal should follow the definition of indirect (creeping)

401

expropriation*”" articulated in Crystallex v. Venezuela:*°2

It is generally understood that a ‘direct’ expropriation occurs where the
investor's investment is taken through formal transfer of title or outright
seizure, whereas an ‘indirect expropriation’ occurs where a state's action
or series of actions result in the investor being deprived of the enjoyment
or benefit of its investment, although title to the property or the rights
remains with the original owner. Furthermore, the expression ‘creeping
expropriation’ is used to refer to a specific form of [indirect] expropriation

The Tribunal notes that the Claimant does not appear to draw a distinction between indirect and creeping
expropriation in its submissions. The Claimant thus argues that “Poland committed an indirect (creeping)
expropriation of investment” and applies the same legal test for indirect and creeping
expropriations. See Amended SoC, §§ 390, 391

Amended SoC, § 391, referring to Crystallex International Corporation v. Bolivarian Republic of
Venezuela, |CSID Case No. ARB(AF)/11/2, Award of 4 April 2016 (CLA-283), § 667.

that results from a series of measures taken over time that cumulatively
have an expropriatory effect, rather than from a single measure or group
of measures that occur at one time.

. Applied to the circumstances of the present case, this means, in the Claimant's view,
that, taken together with the 2014 WCA Judgment, the Prior Measures constitute an
indirect expropriation within the meaning of Treaty. The Claimant summarizes its case
as follows:4°

The Tribunal must ... determine whether a creeping and/or direct
expropriation took place in the present case, through the aggregate effect
of the Prior Measures, including but not limited to all recommendations and
decisions of the Warsaw Monuments Conservator until 2014, until “the
straw that broke the camel's back” to use the words of the Siemens
tribunal, i.e. the decision of the Warsaw Court of Appeal of 19 December
2014 in the present case.

. In support of its aggregate effect theory, the Claimant also refers to the finding of
Judge Bryan that “a claim for creeping expropriation is not precluded where there is
a specific event in the chain of events that might ultimately be found to be itself a form
of expropriation”.4°4

 

. In response to the Resp it's that a ping expropriation cannot
coexist with a direct expropriation because “the same asset cannot be expropriated
twice”, the Claimant emphasizes that its case is that “the end point of the creeping
expropriation, following a causal chain of events (the Prior Measures in this case),
can be the same as an event of direct expropriation, i.e the 19 December 2014
decision of the Warsaw Court of Appeal terminating the real property rights resulting
from the Perpetual Usufruct Agreement in this case”.4°

More specifically as to the type of measures, the Claimant alleges that “the Polish
authorities consistently misapplied Polish rules and legislation concerning the
protection of monuments” and were wrong about the competence of the Warsaw
Cor tor to give ions on the di pment of the Property.*%

 

. Finally, the Claimant also contends that the termination of the PUA was prompted by
the hidden agenda of City and the Museum.*°” According to the Claimant, the
Respondent “engaged in an active campaign to delay and prevent any construction”

on the Property, and used the delay created by its own organs to terminate the PUA,
in order to ultimately transfer the Property to the Museum.‘

b. | Respondent’s Position

As a preliminary remark, the Respondent argues that the 2014 WCA Judgment has
no “link" to the Prior Measures, *°° which, arguendo, could have prevented the
development of the Property and resulted in an indirect expropriation. For this reason,
the Respondent rebuts the Claimant's allegations regarding the indirect expropriation
claim only in so far as they are based exclusively on the Prior Measures.

In connection with the Prior Measures, the Respondent advances two reasons as to
why they do not qualify, in their own right, as indirect expropriation under the Treaty.
First, the Respondent emphasizes that, in the Award on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal
determined that an indirect expropriation cannot occur if there is a subsequent
instance of direct expropriation. Acknowledging that the English High Court held a
different view, the Respondent argues that the Court's pronouncements on
expropriation do not bind the Tribunal.*1° Thus, according to the Respondent, if the
termination of the PUA by the 2014 WCA Judgment qualifies as a direct expropriation,
the Prior Measures (alone or together) cannot give rise to an indirect expropriation.

Second, and in any event, the Prior Measures were not expropriatory in nature, since
they did not deprive the Claimant of its investment. For the Respondent, a measure
amounts to an indirect expropriation only if the following three cumulative criteria are

met:4"1
i. |The measure results in a total or near-total destruction of the investment's
economic value, as clarified by PSEG Global v. Turkey and European Media
v. Czech Republic;412

li. The measure deprives a foreign investor of control over the investment, as
confirmed by Venezuela Holdings v. Bolivia and Sempra v. Argentina);4"°

ii. | The effects of the measure are permanent, as noted in Tecmed v, Mexico.***

403. In the Respondent's view, the Prior Measures did not affect the development of the

Property for the following reasons:

|. The Claimant and its predecessors possessed all the relevant authorisations
(namely, the 2005 WZ decision and the 2005 Building Permit), which
enabled them to develop the Property;415

ii. | The City never replied positively to any of the Museum's requests. Therefore,
the allegations of a hidden agenda between the City and the Museum are
entirely unjustified;*"®

iii. | The City repeatedly replied to the Claimant's and its predecessors’ requests
for extension of the PUA deadlines, and “the sole reason for which the
development deadlines were not extended” was “29 Listopada’s
indecision”;4””

iv. The Warsaw Conservator’s recommendations were always consistent and
the Claimant’s distinction between allegedly “positive” and “negative”
recommendations is artificial and misleading.

404. The Respondent also denies that the Polish authorities misapplied Polish law. The

Respondent argues that the competence of the Warsaw Conservator derives from the
1971 Decision and/or the 1994 Ordinance, In any event, “the Claimant itself
unequivocally confirmed the conservation protection of the Real Estate by repeatedly
applying to the Warsaw Conservator for its recommendations throughout the years,
even as late as in 2014”.418

@

scope of its analysis, with respect to the interplay between the Prior Measures and
the 2014 WCA Judgment (1), and, specifically, those Prior Measures which were
adopted before the demolition of the Barracks (2).

1. The Prior Measures and the 2014 WCA Judgment

The Claimant argues that the Prior Measures and the 2014 WCA Judgment resulted
in an indirect expropriation of the Claimant's investment. For the Claimant, the
aggregate expropriatory effect of the Prior Measures culminated in the 2014 WCA
Judgment, which it argues “directly followed from” the Prior Measures. *!? The
Claimant argues that the Tribunal cannot deny the expropriatory effect of the Prior
Measures on the ground that the 2014 WCA Judgment may itself effect a direct
expropriation of the investment. In this regard, the Claimant relies on the statement
made by Justice Bryan that “a claim for creeping expropriation is not precluded where
there is a specific event in the chain of events that might ultimately be found to be
itself a form of expropriation”.42°

In response, the Respondent maintains that the Prior Measures do not amount to an
indirect expropriation. For the Respondent, even if the Prior Measures “had a deferred
expropriatory potential, such effects never materialized because of the supervenient
acts in the form of the judicial termination” of the PUA.‘?' The same asset, so argues
the Respondent, cannot be expropriated twice. 422

In light of the Parties’ disagreement, the Tribunal will first assess whether the Claimant
may argue that its investment was indirectly expropriated through the aggregate effect
of the Prior Measures and the 2014 WCA Judgment. In this context, the Tribunal will
also briefly assess the findings of the English High Court cited by the Claimant and
their potential impact on the Tribunal's analysis.

N

expropriation is not precluded where there is a specific event in the chain of events
that might ultimately be found to be itself a form of expropriation’*?5 was made in the
context of a jurisdictional matter, i.e. Justice Bryan held that it was not appropriate for
the Tribunal to dismiss the claims related to the Prior Measures at the jurisdictional
stage. Specifically, he stated as follows: 4

| consider that it will be generally inappropriate (save possibly in a very
clear case) at an initial hearing in relation to jurisdiction for a tribunal to
make any definitive findings as to whether particular acts amount to indirect

‘propriation (it ing creeping iation) or iatic y,
or make any findings which would preclude consideration of all facts
(including the Prior Measures) being explored at the merits stage in due
course, especially where (as here) more than one category of investment
is alleged to have been expropriated, and prior measures are being relied
upon which may not immediately be obviously expropriatory, and the
aggregate picture is best judged at the final merits hearing. Any other
course is likely to result in injustice if it has the effect that a party cannot
rely upon matters which form part of the overall picture, and may be part
of the expropriatory conduct either in isolation, or in the aggregate.

According to Justice Bryan, the aggregate effect of the Prior Measures and the 2014
WCA Judgment should therefore be assessed by the Tribunal at the merits stage:*7*

... lam satisfied thai {jgEphas pleaded what it needs to plead to establish
@ prima facie case of creeping expropriation for jurisdictional purposes on
a pro tem approach. Whether in fact there was a creeping expropriation,
having regard to the aggregate effect of the prior measures relied upon,
and in what respects, will be a matter for the Tribunal at the merits stage.

. He was also unambiguous that the merits of the dispute shall be determined by the

Tribunal:476

... The ultimate determination of particular factual issues (assuming the
Tribunal has jurisdiction in relation to any particular claim) will be a matter
for the Tribunal at the merits stage of the Arbitration. It is common ground
that the merits of the underlying disputes are not issues to be determined
by this Court...

. Justice Bryan was not in a position to reach any conclusive view as to whether or not

there had been an indirect expropriation, and he did not do so. Thus, without prejudice
to the views on the matter expressed by Justice Bryan at the jurisdictional stage, it is
the Tribunal's task to determine the aggregate effect of the Prior Measures and the
2014 WCA Judgment on the Claimant's investment. In doing so, it must establish

416.

whether these measures can be assessed together for the purposes of the indirect
expropriation claim, In the Tribunal's view, this question must be answered in the
negative, because the 2014 WCA Judgment is not part of the chain of events that
allegedly prevented the development of the Property and could be said to have
indirectly expropriated the Claimant's investment. The Tribunal disagrees with the
Claimant that the 2014 WCA Judgment “directly followed from” the Prior Measures. It
did not. In fact, it was adopted as a result of the Claimant’s demolition of the Barracks,
which were distinct from the Prior Measures. Neither the factual matrix, nor the
Judgment itself, the focus of which — actually the raison d’étre — is the demolition,
contain sufficient indicia of any “links” to the Prior Measures.

Thus, in the context of the indirect expropriation claim, the Tribunal cannot agree with
the Claimant that the 2014 WCA Judgment was “the straw that broke the camel's
back”. It will therefore focus its analysis on the measures adopted prior to the
Judgment. This said, the Tribunal will assess the 2014 WCA Judgment independently
in the context of the Claimant's direct expropriation claim. This approach is in line with
the position adopted by the English High Court, which underlined the importance of
assessing the potential expropriatory effect of all measures invoked by the Claimant.

2. Measures adopted before the demolition of the Barracks

In support of its indirect expropriation claim, the Claimant also invokes numerous acts
of the Respondent's authorities that allegedly prevented the development of the
Property between 2008 and 2016. in the Tribunal's view, the measures adopted by
the Respondent after the demolition of the Barracks in late 2011 cannot have
expropriatory effect because, even though the PUA was still in place, its economic
purpose was frustrated and the development of the Property in accordance with the
terms of the PUA was de facto impossible.

For the purposes of its analysis of the Claimant's indirect expropriation claim, the
Tribunal will therefore only review those Prior Measures which were adopted before
the demolition of the Barracks in 2011, as these are the only measures capable of

 

having an iatory effect. Ci ly, the dopted after the demolition
of the Barracks have no such effect as they could not affect the development of the
Property under the PUA.

(ii) | Assessment of the Prior Measures until the demolition of the Barracks

The Tribunal held above that the effect of the 2014 WCA Judgment cannot form part
of its analysis of the Claimant's indirect expropriation ciaim. it has also held that the

@

measures postdating the demolition of the Barracks can have no expropriatory
effect.*?” Hence, it will now consider the facts underlying the Prior Measures until the
demolition of the Barracks and determine whether these measures have resulted in
an indirect expropriation of the Claimant's investment.

The Claimant argues that the following Prior Measures, which were adopted before
the demolition of the Barracks, were illegitimate:
i. the City failed to extend the PUA deadlines;

ji. the Monument Conservator was not competent to opine on the development
of the Property;

iii. the recommendations of the Monument Conservator were contradictory;
iv. the City conspired with the Museum to the detriment of the Claimant.*28

The Respondent disputes the Claimant's qualification of the Prior Measures and
requests the Tribunal to assess the accuracy of the Claimant's allegations.

1. Was the City under an obligation to extend the PUA deadlines?

The deadlines for the development of the Property were initially fixed by the PUA,
according to which the construction works on the Property had to be completed by
2004. The Annex to the PUA*”® subsequently extended this deadline to February
2005.

. The Claimant's predecessors applied to the City for extensions of this deadline

several times between 2005 and 2010. They had no success and the Claimant
highlights two instances of the City’s alleged misconduct in this respect. First, the City
simply ignored the applications made by its predecessors. Second, the City
disregarded its obligation under the 2002 Resolution to extend the PUA deadlines.

Having carefully reviewed the correspondence between the City and the Claimant's
predecessors between 2005 and 2010, and given due regard to the wording of the
2002 Resolution,**° the Tribunal is not persuaded by the Claimant's contentions.

a

willing to extend the time limits under the PUA, provided that 29 Listopada accepted
its proposal to increase the yearly fee payable by the usufructuary. The Tribunal also
notes that in 2007 the Claimant's predecessors changed the strategy for the
development of the Property,**? but failed to update the City and provide a new time
limit for the amended development. The Tribunal thus concludes that the City cannot
be deemed to have been under an obligation to extend the PUA time limits in the

 

absence of any itive and i feasible proposal from 29 Li:

Second, the Tribunal cannot agree with the Claimant's argument that the City was
obliged to prolong the PUA deadlines pursuant to the 2002 Resolution. In relevant
part, that resolution reads as follows:**>

[iJn the event of failure to keep to the deadlines specified herein an

additional deadline shall be specified, and an additional annual fee referred

to in Art. 63 of the Act on Real Estate Development shall be determined.
The Tribunal is of the view that the 2002 Resolution offers no basis for any supposed
duty to extend the PUA time periods. In fact, paragraph 2 of the Resolution requires
that amendments be recorded by a notary:4**

Extension of the deadlines of development referred to in Clause 1 above

requires that respective amendments should be introduced to the existing

notarial deed.
In spite of this requirement, neither the Claimant nor its predecessors ever sought to
amend the existing notarial deed to effect the change of the PUA time limit.

F lution. The Sup Admini: ive Court it that the 2002 Resolution
is merely an internal document, and therefore cannot be considered as a source of
obligations between the City and the perpetual usufructuary:

... a resolution is only an internal act of the municipal authority (executive
board) and as such cannot be a source of any obligation of that authority
under the contractual perpetual usufruct relationship between the owner
and the perpetual usufructuary. Thus, it cannot be perceived as a source
of the obligation to apply Article 63(1) REM. The relations between the land
owner and perpetual usufructuary are dependent on their agreement and
applicable laws.**>

 

This isation of the 2002 ion by the Sup Admini ive Court, as
an instrument that does not create obligations of the authority vis-a-vis the
usufructuary, serves to reinforce the conclusion just reached: the City had no duty to
extend the time for development of the Property beyond the limits specified in the PUA

and the Annex.

For completeness, the Tribunal observes that it has also noted the Respondent's
alternative argument that the City’s alleged failure to extend the deadlines is not
attributable to the Respondent, because “when concluding and performing” the PUA,
“the City of Warsaw acted in the dominium and not imperium sphere”.*%* Given its
finding that the City did not breach any duty to extend the PUA deadlines, the Tribunal
can dispense with examining this argument.

2. Did the Warsaw Conservator exceed its competence?

The Parties have made numerous submissions on the competence of the Warsaw
Conservator to make recommendations on the development of the Property. This
topic was also extensively discussed during the Hearing and was the focal issue of
the Parties’ PHBs. The Tribunal is mindful that this matter is controversial under Polish
law, as reflected in the helpful expert opinions ae

The Tribunal understands that, in its recommendations, the Warsaw Conservator
telied on two instruments as the alleged basis of its competence to opine on the

439

development of the Property, namely the 1971 Decision and the 1994 Ordinance.
Therefore, the Tribunal will focus its analysis on these two instruments.

With respect to the first instrument, the Parties and their experts agree that the
Property is situated within the perimeter designated by the 1971 Decision. However,
due to the ambiguity of the wording used, they disagree on the scope of application
of the 1971 Decision.

The 1971 Decision states the following with respect to its scope of application, in the
Polish original: 497

 

t ienie: O: i Z okr, brazu, g iowi is

Teren o znaczeniu historycznym
For which the Parties provide slightly different translations:
i. The Claimant's version:4%*

Justification: Bronze era, early medieval and medieval settlements; area of historical
importance.

ji. |The Respondent's version:4*

Justification: Bronze era, early medieval and medieval settlements

Area of historical importance.
The Claimant argues that the 1971 Decision is designed to protect only “bronze era,
early medieval and medieval settlements” situated within its perimeter. It advocates
that “area of historical importance” must be read conjunctively with “bronze era, early

i and dieval ". Cc ly, the Warsaw Conservator's

competence is limited to the conservation of archaeological remnants of the “bronze
era, early medieval and medieval settlements”.4*° This implies that once excavations
works were completed, the Warsaw Conservator no longer had any competence to
give recommendations on the construction works conducted on the Property.

On the other hand, the Respondent submits that the 1971 Decision covers the entire
area of historical importance situated within the designated perimeter, It claims that
the terms “area of historical importance” and “bronze era, early medieval and
medieval settlements” should be read disjunctively because in the original text (as
translated by the Respondent) the phrase “area of historical importance” appears on

a separate line. Consequently, for the Respondent, the Warsaw Conservator’s
competence is not limited to the protection of archaeological remnants. Instead, the
Warsaw Conservator is competent to give recommendations on practically any works
conducted within the protected area.“

The Tribunal finds that the language employed in the 1971 Decision is indeed not
entirely free from doubt. The grammatical interpretation of the 1971 Decision does not
allow the Tribunal to conclusively determine whether the “bronze era, early medieval
and medieval settlements” and “area of historical importance" should be read
conjunctively or disjunctively. As this question is important for determining the scope
of the Warsaw Conservator’s competence, the Tribunal needs to consider how the
1971 Decision has been interpreted by the Polish judiciary and applied by the Polish
authorities.

In a decision issued on 12 September 2017, the Supreme Administrative Court of
Poland addressed the scope of the application of the 1971 Decision and held that it
encompassed archaeological monuments as well as buildings and structures of
historical importance: 442

... In fact the above-mentioned decision is laconic, but it makes it clear that
the area defined therein [...] is subject to protection. It follows from its
justification that the reason for granting protection were both
archaeological monuments and the historical significance of the area
indicated therein. The reason for the refusal to agree on the decision on

f ‘ould be the of
archaeological monuments located in this area and the protection of the
historical significance of this area. The latter aspect of protection, in the
opinion of the Supreme Administrative Court, also covers the protection of
buildings and other structures of historical importance, including their
substance and view...

Thus, in the interpretation of the Supreme Administrative Court of Poland, the 1971
Decision is not limited to the protection: of archaeological remnants. Rather, the

 

decision protects all of his imp! located within the area,
including their “structure and view". As a result, the competence of the Warsaw
Conservator extends to giving recommendations about buildings of historical
significance including their substance and view located within the area.

The Claimant voiced concerns about the relevance of the judgment of the Supreme
Administrative Court to the present case,**? and argued that the judgment does not

relate to the Property or involve the Parties.*#4 For the Tribunal, this, on the contrary,
enhances the credibility of the findings of Supreme Administrative Court, which reflect
an interpretation of the 1971 Decision which is independent of the circumstances of
the present dispute.

While the Claimant further contends that the Respondent has submitted an
incomplete translation of the judgment,** it has failed to point to any substantial
missing part or i i ies in the ion. The Tribunal theref id
that the extract pi by the pi reflects the interp ion of
the 1971 Decision given by the Supreme Administrative Court.

 

Moreover, the Claimant submits that the Supreme Administrative Court’s reasoning
is “light’. “© The Tribunal disagrees. In the Tribunal's view, the Supreme
Administrative Court determined with precision that the term “area of historical
importance” is not connected or attached to the phrase “bronze era, early medieval
and medieval settlements", which is sufficient for present purposes.

. The Tribunal also observes that the interpretation of the 1971 Decision given by the

Supreme Administrative Court corresponds to the manner in which the Warsaw
Conservator interacted with the perpetual usufructuary during the relevant time. At all
relevant times, the Warsaw Conservator and the perpetual usufructuary considered
that the Barracks qualified as a protected monument. This is demonstrated by the
following instances:

i, The perpetual usufructuary applied to the Warsaw Conservator for
recommendations several times between 2006 and 2014, and the Warsaw
Conservator issued several sets of recommendations. If the Barracks were not
considered to be protected, neither the Claimant's predecessors nor the
Warsaw Conservator would have adopted this course of conduct; and

ii. The necessity to consult with the Warsaw Conservator was evident to the
Claimant, as it follows from the Mezzanine Facility Application of 3 December
2007**’ and as it was confirmed by EB during the Hearing;*** and

442.

444,

44g

iii. Neither the Claimant prior to this arbitration, nor its predecessors challenged
the competence of the Warsaw Conservator to give recommendations on the
design and structure of the Barracks.

The Tribunal also wishes to emphasize the importance of the testimony of the Warsaw
Conservator, during the Hearing
gave wholly credible and convincing testimony, in explaining the importance of the
preservation of cultural and historical heritage in Warsaw. The role of such
preservation is particularly significant in a city which lost practically all of its historical

its and buildi through the i and other five acts in World
War Il. Against this background, it makes perfect sense that the 1971 Decision
granted the Warsaw Conservator ample and extensive competence to ensure the
protection of Polish historical and cultural heritage. Moreover, having heard @
fr the Tribunal has no doubt that the Warsaw Conservator performed
her duties competently and in good faith.

. The only document that the Claimant invokes against the competence of the Warsaw

Conservator is the opinion of the Provincial Conservator dated 11 March 2009.**
However, this opinion simply confirms that the Property fall within the scope of the
1971 Decision and does not support the Claimant's case that the Warsaw
Conservator is not competent to opine on the development of the Property. Indeed,
in pertinent part, the opinion reads as follows:

... the only form of the preservation maintenance [of the estate] is its

entering in the register of archaeological monuments of the Mazovian

Province in conformity with the decision of the Warsaw Heritage

Monuments Protection Office (Konserwator Zabytkaw m. st. Warszawy)

dated 30 June 1971 under registry No. A-48, which decision covers the

area comprised among the streets [...] on account of the settlement relics

dating back to the Bronze Age, and the early Medieval and Medieval

periods, which, as you have justly noted, imposes restrictions at the stage

of construction works on the owner or possessor of an estate in

accordance with Articles 31 and 36 of Act dated 23 July 2003 on the

Protection and the Guardianship of Historical Monuments (Oz. U. of 2003,

No. 162, Item 1568, as amended).
To conclude, the Tribunal finds that the Warsaw Conservator was competent to opine
on the development of the Property, including the design, view and structure of the
Barracks, in accordance with the 1971 Decision. The Claimant and its predecessors
were thus under an obligation to seek the recommendations of the Warsaw

Conservator before applying a WZ decision.

3. Did the Warsaw Conservator make contradictory recommendations?

The Claimant alleges that its predecessors could not develop the Property because
the Warsaw Conservator’s recommendations were contradictory. In rebuttal, the
Ri dent has pi a detailed i of all the i of the
Warsaw Conservator seeking to demonstrate that such recommendations were

 

consistent with each other. The Claimant did not challenge the accuracy of this

comparison.

. As already mentioned,‘ for the purposes of the indirect expropriation claim, the

Tribunal will analyse the recommendations made by the Warsaw Conservator before
2011. Indeed, it considers that the recommendations rendered thereafter, namely in
2012 to 2014, are irrelevant, because the Barracks were already demolished and the
purpose of the PUA was frustrated.

. Having carefully considered the recommendations issued by the Warsaw Conservator

between 2006 and 2011, the Tribunal finds no contradictions. The Tribunal also finds
that the Claimant has failed to point to any substantial inconsistency, whereas the
Respondent presented an accurate and helpful comparison of the positions taken by
the Warsaw Conservator during the relevant time period.

The Tribunal has come to this conclusion after analysing the following parameters,
which were all key to the development of the Property, namely: (i) the number of floors
which the perpetual usufructuary was allowed to build above the level of the Barracks;
(ii) the overall height of the modernised building; (iii) the height of the other buildings
on the Property; and (iv) the use of the Museum's land.

. Between 2007 and 2011, the Warsaw Conservator made the following

recommendations:

* First, in 2007, the Warsaw Conservator recommended the construction of one
additional storey, and specified that the new building should not overwhelm the
Museum or encroach upon its land.**

See paragraph 414 of the Award.

« Second, in 2009, the Warsaw Conservator reiterated that the use of the Museum’s

« Third, in 2011, the Warsaw Conservator recommended the construction of just
one additional storey above the Barracks and authorized the use of the area which
belongs to the investor.4°?

29 Listopada to the Warsaw Conservator in 2007, 2009 and 2011:

First, in 2008, the project of the development of the Property envisaged the
construction of two additional storeys above the Barracks and the use of the
Museum's land,*4

Second, in 2009, the project envisaged two additional storeys and the use of the
Museum's land,*85

Third, in 2011, the project envisaged the construction of 2 additional storeys above
the Barracks with a total height of 15.5 m.4*

If one compares the recommendations of the Warsaw Conservator with the
applications of 29 Listopada in each year, it is evident that the applications envisioned
the development of the Property beyond the parameters recommended by the
Warsaw Conservator in all three years.

. More importantly, the review of the content of the Warsaw Conservator’s

 

idations consi: ly ified the same for the it of

the Property (i.e. the number of storeys above the Barracks, the height of the nearby

erections, the prohibition of the use of the Museum’s land, etc.) at all relevant times.

By contrast, the Claimant and its predecessors failed to comply with these
in their ications for the di pment of the Property.

4. Did the City and the Museum have a “hidden agenda”?

Finally, the Tribunal considers the Claimant's allegations that the City had a hidden
agenda with the Museum. The Claimant invokes several letters and statements made
by the Museum, which allegedly reveal the hidden agenda between the Museum and
the City. The Tribunal will analyse them in turn.

Ina letter of 12 March 2008, the Museum expressed its discontent with 29 Listopada’s
application for a WZ decision. The Tribunal can see no trace or confirmation of a
hidden agenda. On the contrary, the Tribunal understands the Museum's opposition
to the project of development of the Property, which encroached upon the Museum's
land.**7 In any event, the Claimant failed to prove that the Claimant's predecessors
would have obtained a WZ decision if it had not been for the Museum's letter of
12 March 2008. The application for the WZ decision made in 2008 was unsuccessful,
because it envisaged the use of the Museum's land, which was incompatible with the
fecommendations of the Warsaw Conservator.**

Further, in December 2011 the Museum made statements calling for the termination
of the PUA. The Tribunal is not convinced that the City terminated the PUA based on
these statements. The City’s call for the termination of the PUA was justified by the
demolition of the Barracks in 2011.

Finally, the Museum requested transfer of the Property to itself following the
demolition of the The Tribunal i that these req! lack
here. After the frustration of the PUA’s object and purpose, the Museum's statements

could not have had any impact on the Claimant's performance of the PUA. Moreover,
the Tribunal notes that the City never satisfied the Museum's requests.

Thus, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant failed to prove the existence of any
hidden agenda between the Museum and the City, be it one which would have
prevented the Claimant or its predecessors from developing the Property, or
otherwise.

(iii) Did the Respondent indirectly expropriate the Claimant's
investment?

The Tribunal has established above that, contrary to the Claimant's allegations, (i) the
City was not obliged to extend the PUA deadlines; (ii) the Warsaw Conservator was
competent to opine on the development of the Property; (iii) the Warsaw
Conservator's recommendations were not contradictory; and (iv) the City had no
“hidden agenda” with the Museum.

The Tribunal will now analyse whether, notwithstanding these conclusions, the
Respondent's other measures may be said to have caused an indirect expropriation
of the Claimant's investment.

The Tribunal first observes that it agrees with the legal test of indirect expropriation
set forth by the Respondent, according to which a State's measures qualify as indirect
expropriation if (i) they result in a total or near-total destruction of the investment's
economic value; (ii) they deprive a foreign investor of the control over the investment;
and (iii) the effect of these measures is permanent. “5°

In support of this three-prong test, the Respondent relied on Venezuela Holdings v.
Venezuela, which held that:

[...] a measure which does not have all the features of a formal
expropriation may be equivalent to an expropriation if it gives rise to an
effective deprivation of the investment as a whole. Such a deprivation
requires either a total loss of the investment's value or a total loss of control
by the investor of its investment, both of a permanent nature [...]*°

The Respondent also invoked Sempra Energy v. Argentine, where an indirect
expropriation was described as follows:

[many of the measures discussed in the instant case have had a very
adverse effect on the conduct of the business concerned. This is, however,
again a question that the Treaty addresses in the context of other
safeguards for protecting the investor, A finding of indirect expropriation
would require more than adverse effects, It would require that the investor

v. Hungary:

Though different tribunals have formulated the test in different ways, they

[...] all agreed that the interference with the investor's rights must be such

as substantially to deprive the lnyestor of the economic value, use or

enjoyment of its investment. [...]**2
The Tribunal finds no reason to depart from the existing line of jurisprudence.
Therefore, the Tribunal will now assess whether (i) remaining the Prior Measures
resulted in a total or near-total destruction of the investment’s value; or (ii) they
deprived the Claimant of control over its investment; and (iii) the effect of the Prior
Measures was permanent. In view of the cumulative nature of this test, failure to prove
any one of the three requirements would lead to the dismissal of the Claimant's
indirect expropriation claim.

First, the Prior Measures did not result in the total or near-total destruction of the
Claimant's investment. Before it demolished the Barracks, the Claimant was perfectly
able to develop the Property in accordance with the 2005 WZ Decision, i.e. the
perpetual usufructuary was authorized to build one or two storeys over ground with a
maximum height of 5 -11m.‘®* The Claimant's investments (the mortgage, the shares,
the loans, the option agreement) therefore was not “valueless”, as the Claimant was
able to develop the Property and eventually derive profit from it.

The Claimant and its predecessors failed to develop the Property in accordance with
the PUA and the 2005 WZ Decision, because of their aspiration to pursue a more
ambitious project.*** Thus, any alleged damage resulting from the Claimant and its
predecessors’ change of development strategy is not caused by the Respondent. The
City legitimately refused to issue a new WZ decision in 2009,*** because the project
contemplated by Parkview Terrace between 2007 and 2009 did not comply with the
PUA and the recommendations of the Warsaw Conservator. Thus, the Prior Measures
did not result in the total deprivation of the investment’s value. In other words, the

Claimant has failed to satisfy the first prong of the test set out in paragraph 460 above.
This is sufficient to dismiss the Claimant's indirect expropriation claim.

For the sake of completeness, the Tribunal notes that the second prong of the test is
not met either, as the Prior Measures did not deprive the Claimant of control over its
investment. Prior to the termination of the PUA, the Claimant and its predecessors
were in full control of the Property and were able to develop of the Property in
accordance with the 2005 WZ Decision.

(iv) Conclusion

To sum up, even though the Prior Measures inhibited the Claimant's ambitions with
respect to the development of the Property, they did not prevent its development in
accordance with the terms agreed between the City and the perpetual usufructuary
by means of the 2005 WZ Decision. Nor did the Prior Measures deprive the Claimant
of control of its investment. As a result, the Prior Measures do not amount to an
indirect expropriation.

2. Direct Expropriation Claim

469.

470.

a. Claimant's Position

The Claimant argues that the Respondent directly expropriated its investment through
the 2014 WCA Judgment, which transferred the Claimant's usufructuary rights over
the Property to the City.‘ Similarly to its argument in the context of indirect
expropriation, the Claimant argues that the 2014 WCA Judgment was the “straw that
broke the camel’s back”,4®’ i.e. the measure that destroyed what was left of the
Claimant's investment after the adoption of the Prior Measures.

b. Respondent's Position

The Respondent first underlines that the 2014 WCA Judgment has no expropriatory
character because judgments of local courts can potentially only breach treaty
provisions granting investors protection against denial of justice, and the Claimant
was never denied justice. On the contrary, the proceedings regarding the termination
of the PUA passed through three court levels,*®* all of which applied Polish law

correctly, as evidenced inter alia by the detailed expert report of QD
Moreover, the proceedings did not involve any breaches of due process.***

In reliance on Liman Caspian Oil v. Kazakhstan, Azinian v. Mexico, Heinan v. Egypt
and MNSS v. Montenegro,*’° the Respondent submits that local courts have a certain
margin of appreciation when it comes to the application of local law and that, as a
general rule, investment tribunals cannot revisit issues determined by the courts.

Alternatively, the Respondent argues that, under international law (as confirmed by
Middle East Cement v. Egypt, Arif v. Moldova, Liman Caspian v. Kazakhstan,
Swisslion v. Macedonia and Garanti Koza v. Turkmenistan),*”' the termination of a
contract by a local court amounts to a valid exercise of police powers, which precludes
the finding of expropriation. According to the Respondent, the 2014 WCA Judgment
was a valid exercise of the Respondent's police powers, because it (i) pursued
legitimate public interest; (ii) was non-discriminatory; (iii) and was adopted under due
process of law.47?

c. Analysis

Both Parties have provided extensive submissions on the compatibility with Polish law
of the 2013 judgment of the Warsaw Regional Court, which terminated the PUA, and
of the 2014 WCA Judgment, following which the termination of the Claimant's rights
became effective. The Tribunal will now analyse these submissions. It will do so with
a degree of restraint for the following reasons.

The Tribunal agrees with a number of investment tribunals, which have underscored
that investment treaty tribunals are not courts of appeal and their role is not to assess

473

the correctness of local judgments, as courts of appeal normally do.*’> For instance,
in Helnan v. Egypt, it was held that:

- An ICSID Tribunal will not act as an instance to review matters of
domestic law in the manner of a court of higher instance. Instead, the
Tribunal will accept the findings of local courts as long as no deficiencies,
in procedure or substance, are shown in regard to the local proceedings
which are of a nature of rendering these deficiencies unacceptable from
the viewpoint of international law, such as in the case of a denial of
justice,474

Bearing its role in mind, the Tribunal will review whether the 2014 WCA Judgment

was expropriatory under international law, and will avoid elaborating on the
compatibility with Polish law of the 2014 WCA Judgment.

As a general rule, judgments of domestic courts are not expropriatory if they enforce
or give effect to a State's legitimate contractual rights. Indeed, such judgments merely
implement the general principle of law pacta sunt servanda. It is indeed a fundamental
tenet of any legal order that, subject to narrow exceptions linked to changed
circumstances, e.g. in situation of force majeure or frustration of contracts, contractual
commitments must be respected.

This was for instance recognized in Swisslion v. Macedonia, the tribunal held that a
State's legitimate exercise of its contractual rights, including the right to terminate a
contract, does not amount to expropriation:475

The contract was terminated and the effect of this order was to transfer
the shares back to the selling party [...].

The Ministry was entitled to form the view that the contract had not been
complied with and to put that view before the courts. The fact that the
courts accepted that view and the judicial decisions have not been
successfully challenged before this Tribunal means that the argument
that the court effected an expropriation must fail [...]

[o]therwise, a State could not exercise the ordinary right of a contractual
party to allege that its counterparty breached the contract without the
State's being found to be in breach of its international obligations. Since
there was no illegality on the part of the courts, the first element of the
Claimant's expropriation claim is not established.

In the same vein, the tribunal in Garanti Koza v. Turkmenistan held as follows:

Actions by state courts to enforce contract rights, including rights to

terminate a contract, have generally not been held by investment

arbitration tribunals to amount to expropriation, regardless of whether the

state or an instrument of the state is the contract party enforcing its

rights.476
The Tribunal sees no reason to depart from this line of jurisprudence which
implements a general and consistent approach. Consequently, it reaches the
conclusion that State measures are not expropriatory if adopted in the legitimate

exercise of the protection of the State's contractual rights.

The question is thus whether the Respondent properly enforced its right to terminate
the PUA. In this regard, the Tribunal will first determine the conditions for the
termination of the PUA under Polish law and then consider whether these conditions
were fulfilled.

The conditions for terminating the PUA are specified in Section 10 of the PUA, Article
240 of the Polish Civil Code, and Article 33 Real Estate Management Act (“REM”).
Section 10 of the PUA provides for the termination of the PUA if the land is used ina
manner obviously contrary to its intended purpose:

This Agreement for the perpetual usufruct of the land can be terminated in
accordance with Art. 240 of the Polish Civil Code before the deadline
specified herein should the perpetual usufructuary use the land in a
manner obviously contrary to its intended purpose or fail to fulfil the
obligations specified herein.

Article 240 of the Polish Civil Code in turn allows the termination of a perpetual
usufructuary agreements, if the perpetual usufruct is used in a manner obviously
contrary to such agreement:

{a] contract of letting the State Treasury's land or the land which is owned
by the entities of local government or their unions as perpetual usufruct
may be terminated before the lapse of a time limit specified in it, if a holder
of perpetual usufruct uses the land in a manner which is obviously contrary
to its purpose specified in the contract, in particular where the holder, in
contradiction with the contract, has not erected specified buildings or
installations.477

Finally, Article 33 of REM contains a similar rule:

The competent authority may demand the termination of a perpetual
usufruct agreement before the expiry of the agreed period, pursuant to
Article 240 of the Civil Code, if the usufructuary uses the property in a

manner i i with the i if the y

did not develop the property within the prescribed time limit: ae
The Claimant's expert (ED notes that in order to determine that the perpetual
usufruct is used in a manner obviously inconsistent with the applicable perpetual
usufruct agreement, (i) the breach of the perpetual agreement must be beyond doubt;
and (ii) there should be no justified excuse for such breach. 47°

. Thus, with due regard iD observations, in order to assess the correctness

of the Polish courts' termination of the PUA, the Tribunal will analyse (i) whether the
Property was used in a manner inconsistent with the PUA; and (ii) if so, whether the
use of the Property in such inconsistent manner was justified.

The Tribunal finds that by destroying the Barracks, which formed the subject matter
of the PUA, the Claimant did use the Property in a manner that was “obviously
contrary” to the PUA’s purpose. In this respect, the Tribunal concurs with the 2014
WCA Judgment, which held that:
“now that the building is demolished, the agreed development is simply not
possible”,*8°
It seems evident to the Tribunal that, after the demolition of the Barracks, the PUA
irreparably lost its “specific economic purpose”, inherent to perpetual usufructuary
agreements under Polish law.*®’ To recall, the purpose of the usufruct was the
and ization of the Cor ly, by lishing the
Barracks, the Claimant used the Property in a manner obviously inconsistent with the
PUA, within the meaning of Section 10 of the PUA, Article 240 of the Polish Civil Code,
and Article 33 of the REM, The Tribunal will now assess whether such breach was

 

 

justified.

The Claimant explains the demolition by the poor condition of the Barracks, which
allegedly represented a threat to public safety. The Tribunal notes that the technical
report of = on which the Claimant relies as a justification for the
destruction of the Barracks, was prepared on 27 May 2010,**? eighteen months before
the demolition took place. Assuming that ED accurately described the
deteriorating conditions of the Barracks at the time, the Tribunal notes that the
Claimant took no action to improve the condition of the Barracks. The Claimant did

not perform any substantial preservation works between 2008 and 2011, even though
it was under an obligation to do so pursuant to the PUA.*®* Neither did it take any
action afte ED eport in the one year and a half between the latter’s report
and the decision to demolish the Barracks.

In the Tribunal’s view, the Claimant should at the very least have explored options to
eliminate any threat to public safety that the Barracks allegedly presented. It should
also have consulted with the City and the Warsaw Conservator before deciding to
demolish the Barracks. Quite to the contrary, the Claimant applied to the City for the
demolition permit*®* on Friday 21 October 2011. Then, without waiting to receive any
response to its application, it immediately proceeded to the demolition. What is more,
the demolition works were conducted in an obviously reckless manner: the site of the
works was not fenced off, and there were no warning or information signs. Given that
the Polish authorities were not informed of the demolition, they understandably could
not supervise the process. From its side, it seems that the Claimant did not ensure
the presence of any qualified person overseeing the safety of the process either. In
any event, the Claimant has presented no convincing evidence that in October 2011
the Barracks indeed represented a real and imminent threat to public safety. Their
demolition, depicted in the below photograph submitted by the Respondent‘, was
therefore unjustified. In the view of the Tribunal, on the basis of the evidence before
it, the demolition of the Barracks was a deliberate act of destruction of cultural and
historical heritage, apparently motivated by the desire to maximize financial gain.

490. In conclusion, by demolishing the Barracks, the perpetual usufructuary used the

Property in a manner obviously inconsistent with the PUA. The demolition of the
Barracks was not justified, and therefore the City was entitled to seek the termination
of the PUA. It follows that the 2014 WCA Judgment properly enforced the
Respondent's rights under the PUA and Polish law. Thus there has been no direct
expropriation in breach of Article 4 of the Treaty.

3. FET Claim

a. Claimant's Position

491. The Claimant argues that under the FET standard “foreign investors are entitled to

487

transparency, consistency and non-arbitrariness in a State's administrative
treatment”. 48° Relying on Saluka v. Czech Republic, EDF v. Romania, CMS v.
Argentina and Occidental v. Ecuador, Tecmed v. Mexico, the Claimant further argues
that legitimate expectations are a dominant element of the FET standard.*®” On this
basis, it submits that:

i. The Respondent frustrated the Claimant's legitimate expectations;
ii. The Respondent acted in bad faith; and

iii. The Respondent discriminated against the Claimant.

492. The Claimant also notes that, contrary to the Respondent's assertions, Article 3(1) of

49:

a

the Treaty is not limited to customary international law. For the Claimant, the clarifying
phrase “excluding any unjustified or discriminatory measure” shows a clear intention
of the Contracting Parties to go beyond the requirements of customary international

law.48

(i) Legitimate expectations

The Claimant submits that it possessed certain legitimate expectations regarding the
development of the Property. In particular, it expected that:

i. the Polish authorities would allow to develop the Property for a sellable
surface area of approximately 4,000 m2, and in any event 2,000 m2 at a
minimum);

i. “the required authorizations would be granted according to the preliminary
assurances that already existed at that point’;

ji. the operation of its investment “would be unhindered by any hidden agenda”;
and

ii. the PUA underpinning the real property rights “would not be terminated for
reasons under the responsibility of the City itself”. 48°

The Claimant asserts that the above legitimate expectations arose from a number of
instruments and statements emanating from the Polish authorities, such as the 2002
Resolution, the 2007 Warsaw Conservator’s recommendations, the 2008 Opinion of
the National Centre, the 2009 Letter of the Provincial Conservator and the PUA itself.

The Tribunal notes, however, that the Claimant does not specify how exactly the
alleged expectations were frustrated. Rather, without entering into any
comprehensive analysis, the Claimant merely makes the broad statement that all Prior
Measures constituted a breach of its legitimate expectations. 4° Therefore, in

summarizing the Claimant's position below, the Tribunal has not only stated the
Claimant's case on the sources of its expectations, but also, to the extent possible,
reflected the Claimant's perception of the alleged breach.

1. The 2002 Resolution

The Claimant argues that it could legitimately expect that the PUA time limits would
be of the F 'S promise in the 2002
Resolution,**' which provides in the relevant part as follows:

[iJn the event of failure to keep to the deadlines specified herein an additional

deadline shall be specified, and an additional annual fee referred to in Art. 63

of the Act on Real Estate Development shall be determined, *92
The Claimant notes that, just like its predecessors, it filed numerous requests for
extension of the time limits to extend the deadlines between 2005 and 2010, to which
the Respondent never gave a positive reply, whereas the 2002 Resolution gave rise
to the Claimant's legitimate expectations that the PUA deadlines would be extended
upon the filing of a relevant request. Therefore, the Claimant appears to argue that,
when the City ignored its requests and terminated the PUA, it frustrated the Claimant's
legitimate expectations arising out of the 2002 Resolution.

2. The 2007 Warsaw Conservator's recommendations

The Claimant alleges that, according to the recommendations given by the Warsaw
Conservator in 2007, the scope of the development of the Property extended to 4,000
sq.m. According to the Claimant, the Warsaw Conservator approved the proposed
development plan, which envisaged the construction of a wing located perpendicularly
to the Barracks, which was to have five ground floors above.*®3

For the Claimant, this was a binding “administrative promise” under Polish law, which
is confirmed ri: the Claimant's expert on administrative law. Thus,
the Claimant could legitimately expect that further recommendations emanating from
the Warsaw Conservator would be no less favourable than the ones given in 2007.
The Tribunal understands that it is the Claimant's case that its legitimate expectations
created by the 2007 Warsaw Conservator’s recommendations were frustrated by all

subsequent Warsaw Conservator’s recommendations, as well as by the City's refusal
to grant the WZ decision in 2009.

The Tribunal also understands the Claimant to allege that the 2009 recommendations
contradicted the conditions of the development of the Property stipulated in the 2005
WZ decision and the Building Permit.4%

3. The 2008 Opinion of the National Centre

The Claimant further alleges that the Opinion of the National Centre was favorable to
the development concept, which envisaged 4000 sq. m. of sellable area, pursued at
the time. The Claimant appears to argue that its expectations were frustrated when
the Warsaw Conservator failed to adequately consider the Opinion of the National
Center in its recommendations of 5 January 2009 and 2 March 2009.

4. The 2009 Letter of the Provincial Conservator

. The Claimant stresses that, on 11 March 2009, the Provincial Conservator stated that

no building on the Property was entered into the Register, when the same
Conservator entered the Barracks into the Register in January 2011. Such entry,
which frustrated its legitimate expectations regarding the status of the Property,
amounted to the violation of Article 3(1) of the Treaty.*9°

5. The PUA

Relying on its previous successful cooperation with the City, the Claimant contends
that it could legitimately expect that cooperation to continue when it came to the
development of the Property.4°° The Claimant argues that it had a legitimate
expectation that the PUA would not be terminated as a result of the City's own failure
to grant the necessary authorisations and to extend the deadlines stipulated by the
Annex to the PUA.*°”

(ii) The principle of good faith

505. In the Claimant's submission, the Respondent acted in bad faith throughout the
operation of the Claimant's investment. First, the Respondent used the 1971 Decision
and the Warsaw Conservator’s recommendations “as a tool to deny the relevant
authorisations to the Claimant”.*** The Claimant also suggests that the Provincial
Conservator entered the Property into the Register in order to give the City a valid
pretext to terminate the PUA. 4%°

506. Second, the Claimant alleges that the City and the Museum located next to the
Property had a hidden agenda, which prompted the City to terminate the PUA to the
benefit of the Museum.*° To prove the existence of the hidden agenda, the Claimant
relies on the following facts:5°

i On 12 March 2008, the Museum objected to the issuance of a WZ decision,
citing concerns of monument protection;

ii. On 15 December 2011, the Museum sent a public statement, which indicated
its support for the termination of the PUA;

iii, On 3 February 2012, approximately one month before the commencement
of those Court proceedings, the Museum formally requested that the City
donate the Property to it;

iv. On 20 June 2013, the request was renewed;

v. On 26 February 2014, the Museum filed a request for suspension of the
proceedings conceming the issuance of a WZ decision to the Claimant,
because the Property was to be transferred to the Museum as soon as the
decision on the termination of the PUA would become final;

the Barracks as the ground to terminate the PUA, since the demolition process was
justified by the threat to human safety that the Barracks posed,.5°?

(iii) The prohibition of discrimination

The Claimant alleges that the Respondent's conduct towards the Claimant was
discriminatory and unjustified.*°° As to the latter, the Claimant invokes the hidden
agenda between the City and the Museum described above. The Claimant relies on
EDF v. Romania to argue that instances of “prejudice or personal preference” violate
the FET standard.®™

As to the discriminatory conduct, Claimant submits that) a company involved
in similar real estate activities, obtained a WZ decision and a building permit for the
development of a property located on GED without difficulties. The
Claimant underlines that a) has started to commercialize a residential
development of the same nature as that contemplated by Parkview Terrace, except
that it is twice as big (over 9,400 sq. m), much higher (23 meters) and ultra-modern in
design”,5°5

. The Claimant also refers to the case i: another real estate company,

as an example of discrimination against the Claimant. ED ‘aitea to meet
the deadlines set by the relevant perpetual usufructuary agreement. In spite of that
failure, the City did not call for the termination of the agreement.5°%

Finally, the Claimant submits that the Warsaw Conservator discriminated against the
Claimant because she adopted two contradictory decisions.°””

Relying on Saluka, the Claimant concludes that the Respondent discriminated against
the Claimant in violation of Article 3(1) of the Treaty.

b, Respondent’s Position

The Respondent argues that the FET standard enshrined in Article 3(1) of the Treaty
does not go beyond the international minimum standard.5°® The Respondent relies
on Neer v. Mexico, Genin v. Estonia, Waste Management v. Mexico, Thunderbird v.
Mexico, Mondev v. US, Lauder v. Czech Republic, CMS v. Argentina, Biwater Gauf
v. Tanzania, Glamis Gold v. US*°* to argue that the applicable FET standard
encompasses only “a gross denial of justice, manifest arbitrariness, complete lack of
due process, evident discrimination, a manifest lack of reason, or the protection of
only basic, legitimate and reasonable expectations”.5"°

In the Respondent's view, the conduct alleged to violate the Treaty falls short of
reaching this threshold.5"

(i) Legitimate expectations
1. The 2002 Resolution

The Respondent alleges that the 2002 Resolution could not create expectations for a
mandatory extension of the PUA deadlines. First, the Respondent clarifies that the
2002 Resolution was an internal act, not addressed to any particular perpetual
usufructuary.*"? Therefore, it could not be a source of expectations.

Second, the Respondent notes that, in order to extend the time for completion, the
parties to the PUA must conclude an annex, similar to the one signed by the City and
Artodex in 2002.5"? For this reason, a single request filed pursuant to the 2002
Resolution is not enough to amend the PUA.

governing perpetual usufruct agreements in Poland, as confirmed by the
Respondent's expert

Fourth, the Respondent submits that, except in these proceedings, the Claimant never
relied on the 2002 Resolution in order to extend the deadlines, neither did its

predecessors,®'5

Finally, the Respondent alleges that the Claimant did not conduct an adequate risk
assessment.5** In 2008, when it invested in the Property, the Claimant knew that the
time limits provided in Annex to the PUA had elapsed. Yet, it nevertheless decided to
invest in the Property.*'? The Respondent relies on Anderson v. Costa Rica and
National Grid v. Argentina to argue that any losses arising out of the Claimant's
decision to invest in the Property must be borne solely by the Claimant.5"®

2. The 2007 Warsaw Conservator's recommendations

. The Respondent contends that the Warsaw Conservator’s recommendations do not

qualify as administrative promise under Polish law, as they are mere guidelines that
investors should follow in order to obtain WZ decisions and building permits.5"* As a
result, they cannot give rise to any expectations, as confirmed by the testimony of

ee

the Respondent's experts on monuments protection in Poland.

Conservator were never contradictory. The Respondent provides a detailed

2011524 and 2013.525

The Respondent specifically notes that the 2007 Recommendations as well as all later
ones only authorized the construction of one additional floor above the Barracks,
whereas the Claimant and its predecessors presented constantly changing
development plans, which assumed the construction of two additional floors.5?6

The Respondent also asserts that the 2007 Recommendations do not contain any
assurances that the Property's sellable area would amount to 4,000 sq. m. In respect
of the Property's sales potential, the Claimant could rely only on the 2005 WZ Decision
and the 2005 Building Permit, which allowed the development of only 1,790 sq. m. of
sellable area.5?7

Overall, the Respondent alleges that the requests for WZ decisions filed by the
Claimant and its predecessors ignored the 2007 Recommendations. For this reason,
the Claimant could not expect the requests to be granted. Nor could it expect a
successful development of the Property of up to 4,000 sq. m., when the 2005 WZ
Decision and the Building Permit authorized only 1,790 sq. m.

3. The 2008 Opinion of the National Centre

The Respondent submits that not only is the Opinion of the National Centre not
binding upon the Warsaw Conservator, but it also postdated the investment.*#8 As a
consequence, the Claimant could not derive any expectations from this opinion.

4. The 2009 Letter of the Provincial Conservator

The Respondent argues that in its 2009 Letter, the Provincial Conservator did not
“promise” that the Barracks would never be entered into the Register.

Property was subject to conservation protection.*° In this context, it refers to the
facility application prepared by GD Advisors and Section 3.2 of the PUA, which
requires the Warsaw Conservator’s approval. The Respondent emphasizes that,
because the Claimant and its predecessors applied for the Warsaw Conservator's
recommendations several times, they must have been aware that the Barracks were
subject to protection and that the Warsaw Conservator’s recommendations were in
fact necessary.

Moreover, the Respondent notes that the 2009 Letter was issued on 11 March 2009,
five months after the Claimant made its investment. Hence that opinion could not
create any legitimate expectations forming the basis for the Claimant's investment.**°

5. The PUA

The Respondent maintains that, at the time the Claimant made its investment, the
PUA deadlines had been exceeded by almost two years. As a result, so points the
Respondent, Article 240 of the Polish Civil Code and Article 33 of the REM, allowed
the City to terminate the PUA. Moreover, the Respondent emphasizes that the
Claimant could in any event not expect the PUA to remain valid after the demolition
of the Barracks, the renovation and adaptation of which was precisely the purpose of
the PUA.5S*

(li) The principle of good faith

According to the Respondent, the Claimant's submissions do not reach the threshold
of bad faith under international law.**? In any event, the Respondent's authorities
always acted in good faith.

First, the Respondent contends that the 1971 Decision was applied within the scope
of the Warsaw Conservators’ discretion and in accordance with Polish law. This was

confirmed by the Polish courts on numerous occasions.***

Second, the Respondent maintains that the City did not terminate the PUA arbitrarily
on its own motion. Rather, the City had to argue the termination of the PUA in front of
three courts, none of which the Claimant ever accused of acting in bad faith. 5°*

Third, the Respondent points to the fact that the PUA was terminated only after the
complete demolition of the Barracks, which was contrary to the PUA and the 2005
Building Permit.535

Finally, the Respondent argues that the City did not have any “hidden agenda” to favor
the Museum to the Claimant's detriment. The Museum’s concerns were justified by
the Claimant's reckless development of the Property,®°

(iii) The prohibition of discrimination

The Respondent makes two submissions in respect of discrimination.**’ First, the
Respondent reiterates that the City never had any hidden agenda with the Museum.5**
Second, the Respondent submits that GD project is significantly different from
that of the Claimant, as the property is located further away from the Lazienki park,
and the project does not involve preservation of a historical building. In the
Respondent's words, GBB cevelops an empty plot of land, without any premises,
not to mention historical objects”.*** Furthermore, the perpetual usufruct agreement
with (oes not impose an obligation to consult the Warsaw Conservator. Thus,
RD» ro ject is ditferent from the Claimant's and no discrimination has occurred.%4

c. Analysis

First, the Tribunal will determine the content of the FET standard contained in Article
3 of the Treaty (i). Second, the Tribunal will analyse whether the Respondent
frustrated the Claimant's legitimate expectations, if any (ii). Third, the Tribunal will
assess whether the Respondent ever acted in bad faith vis-a-vis the Claimant's
investment (iii). Finally, the Tribunal will determine whether the Respondent
discriminated against the Claimant (iv).

(i) FET Standard

Article 3 of the Treaty has the following content:

Each Contracting Party shall accord in its territory to investments made by
investors of the other Contracting Party fair and equitable treatment,
excluding any unjustified or discriminatory measure that could impede the
management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or liquidation thereof.

A threshold question is whether Article 3(2) of the Treaty reflects the so-called
y i i Jaw mini of as the

 

argues, or whether it embodies an autonomous broader standard, as the Claimant
submits. The Tribunal observes that the BIT does not refer to “international minimum
standard” or similar formulations, unlike other treaties.5*1 The Treaty speaks of “fair
and equitable treatment” and adds the phrase “excluding any unjustified or
discriminatory measure that could impede the management, maintenance, use,
enjoyment or liquidation” of the investment. The questions are thus what “fair and
equitable” means,**? and whether that meaning is restricted by the wording “excluding
any unjustified and discriminatory measures”.

In light of the rules of treaty interpretation as codified in Articles 31 and 32 of the
Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) and in particular of the primacy of
the text, the Tribunal first notes, like a number of tribunals, that the plain meaning of
the terms “fair and equitable” does not provide much assistance.*** The tribunal in
S.D. Myers v, Canada stated that unfair and inequitable treatment meant “treatment
in such an unjust or arbitrary manner that the treatment rises to the level that is
unacceptable from the international perspective”.“* As noted in Saluka, “[t]his is

See, e.g. NAFTA, Article 1105, which is entitled “Minimum Standard of Treatment”.

The Tribunal further considers that, even if FET were to be equated to the customary international law
minimum standard, the public international law principles concerning the treatment of aliens have
undergone significant developments since the Neer case, on which the Respondent relies as the
applicable benchmark to define FET. In this sense, see, e.9., ADF v. United States, Award, § 179, in the
context of NAFTA (holding that _ "what customary international law projects is not a static photograph of
the minimum standard of treatment of aliens as it stood in 1927 when the Award in the Neer case was
rendered. For both customary international law and the minimum standard of treatment of aliens it

rates, are constantly in a process of development"); RDC v. Guatemala, ICSID Case No.
ARB/07/23, Award, 29 June 2012, § 218, in the context of the DRCAFTA (concluding that the minimum
standard of treatment is "constantly in a process of development”, including since Neer's formulation)
The Tribunal also agrees with the E/ Paso tribunal that this discussion is “somewhat futile" and "the issue
is not one of comparing two undefined or weakly defined standards; it is to ascertain the content_ and
define the BIT standard of fair and equitable treatment”. See E! Paso Energy International Company v,
The Argentine Republic, \CSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Award, 31 October 2011, § 335.

See, e.g., loan Micula and others v. Romania, \CSID Case No. ARB/05/20, Award of 11 December 2013,

probably as far as one can get by looking at the ‘ordinary meaning’ of the terms of
Article 3.1 of the Treaty”.545

To elucidate the ordinary meaning of similarly worded FET provisions in investment
treaties, arbitral tribunals have identified a number of inherent components of the
standard. For instance, the tribunal in Rumeli v. Kazakhstan held that:

“The parties rightly agree that the fair and equitable treatment standard
encompasses inter alia the following concrete principles: - the State must
act in a transparent manner; - the State is obliged to act in good faith; - the
State’s conduct cannot be arbitrary, grossly, unfair, unjust, idiosyncratic,
discriminatory, or lacking in due process; - the State must respect
procedural propriety and due process. The case law also confirms that to
comply with the standard, the State must respect the investor's reasonable
and legitimate expectations.”*4¢

A number of tribunals have insisted on the notion of legitimate expectations as the
“dominant element” of the FET standard. So for example Saluka:

302. The standard of "fair and equitable treatment” is therefore closely tied
to the notion of legitimate expectations which is the dominant element of
that standard. By virtue of the "fair and equitable treatment" standard
included in Article 3.1 the Czech Republic must therefore be regarded as
having assumed an obligation to treat foreign investors so as to avoid the
frustration of investors’ legitimate and reasonable expectations. As the
tribunal in Tecmed stated, the obligation to provide “fair and equitable
treatment" means: to provide to international investments treatment that
does not affect the basic expectations that were taken into account by the
foreign investor to make the investment.547

In the same vein, the tribunal in EDF v. Romania held that:
216. The Tribunal shares the view expressed by other tribunals that one of

the major components of the FET standard is the parties' legitimate and
reasonable expectations with respect to the investment they have made.**®

. While formulations vary across awards and the Tribunal does not necessarily endorse

every nuance set out in prior decisions, a consensus emerges about the core
components of FET, which include the protection of legitimate expectations, the
protection against conduct that is arbitrary, unreasonable, disproportionate and
lacking in good faith, and the principles of due process and transparency.

581

The next question for the Tribunal to answer is whether the addition in Article 3 of the
Treaty of the words “excluding any unjustified or discriminatory measure that could

 

use, or liquidation” of the

impede the

 

 

investment limits the meaning of FET as described. In this vein, the Respondent
argues that the d
of the VCLT, the Tribunal cannot adopt this understanding of Article 3. First, the
ordinary meaning of the words “fair and equitable” cannot simply be ignored and
replaced by “unjustified” and “discriminatory”. Second, the concept of an “unjustified
measure” is quite broad and appears to confirm rather than do away with the notion
of “fair and equitable” treatment. This conclusion is further corroborated by the awards
in Saluka and EDF which interpreted provisions similar to Article 3 of the Treaty and

is i to gross violations.*4° In lication of Article 31

adopted the same conclusion.

(ii) Legitimate expectations

In line with the standard set out above, a State fails to grant FET if it does not respect
the investor's legitimate expectations. The main components of the doctrine of FET
and legitimate expectations is helpfully summarised by the tribunal in Antaris GmbH
and Géde v. Czech Republic.5*° To qualify as legitimate, the investor's expectations
must be based on assurances (or representations) (i) given by the State in order to
encourage the making of the investment; (ii) addressed specifically to the investor;
(iii) sufficiently specific in content. In addition, an investor must establish that it placed
reliance upon the assurance (or representation). While some arbitral decisions may
have chosen a broader definition of legitimate expectations, the cumulative three-
pronged test just referred to is confirmed by the jurisprudence cited by the Parties®*!
and numerous other investment treaty awards.5*?

The Claimant relies on several documents issued by the Polish authorities as a source
of its alleged legitimate expectations. The Tribunal will review each one individually
and assess whether it gave rise to legitimate expectations with respect to the
development of the Property.

In doing so, the Tribunal will pay particular attention to the chronology. Indeed, the
Claimant argues that it could legitimately expect the development of the Property with
a sellable area of 4,000 sq. m., when it made the investment in 2008. However,
several of the documents invoked as basis for that expectation were issued after
2008.

1. The 2002 Resolution

. As the Tribunal determined earlier,5®* the 2002 Resoiution provides no representation

or other assurance that the PUA time limits would be extended, because these limits
could only be changed by entering into an annex to the PUA.

Moreover, the Tribunal recalls that the 2002 Resolution is an internal document, which
was not addressed to usufructuaries and a fortiori not addressed specifically to the
Claimant. In the judgment of 2 June 2016, quoted above (para. 426 of the Award), the
Supreme Court characterized a resolution as “an internal act of the municipal
authority” which “cannot be a source of any obligation" in connection with the
perpetual usufruct relationship.55*

Furthermore, the Claimant did not take the 2002 Resolution into account when it

decided to invest in the Property, as QED confirmed during the Hearing.**°

Thus, the 2002 Resolution is incapable of being characterized as a representation
that could give rise to any legitimate expectations about the development of the
Property.

2. The 2007 Warsaw Conservator'’s recommendations

The Tribunal will now examine whether the Claimant could have legitimately expected
the Warsaw Conservator not to change her position on the development of the
Property as it was reflected in the 2007 recommendations.

See paragraphs 419-427 of the Award.
Supreme Court Judgment dated 2 June 2016 (RLA-80), pp. 15-16.

557,

587

558

As was already established, the recommendations of the Warsaw Conservator were
consistent with each other at all relevant times.°** This finding makes it unnecessary
for the Tribunal to analyse the Parties’ arguments on whether the Warsaw
Conservator was obligated to maintain her views about the development of the
Property as a matter of Polish law. In any event, the Tribunal finds that she did. That
said, for the purposes of the FET claim, the Tribunal's determination that the Warsaw
Conservator's recommendations were not inconsistent is sufficient to dismiss the
Claimant's allegations about the frustration of its expectations.

Moreover, the Tribunal notes that the Warsaw Conservator recommended the
construction of no more than one to two floor above the Barracks.°°’ Thus, the
Claimant had no basis to expect that the Property would permit the development of
4,000 sq.m of sellable surface. None of the Warsaw Conservator's recommendations
mentions such a figure.

Finally, during the Hearing, QED confirmed that aia not properly review
the 2007 recommendations before the decision to invest in the Property.5®*

In light of these facts, the Claimant cannot be said to have received — or placed
reliance upon - a representation from the 2007 recommendations of the Warsaw
Conservator, from which any legitimate expectation could be derived.

3. The 2008 Opinion of the National Centre

The next document on which the Claimant relies is the Opinion of the National Center
rendered in 2008, which in pertinent part reads as follows:

... it would be better to leave the former barracks building in its historical
height only with the possibility of introduction of a usable attic with roof
windows. If the planned superstructure is added to the building it is also
important that the superstructure does not damage significant architectural
and aesthetic properties of the building presented to the West - as viewed
from the tazienki Krélewskie park and from the east as viewed along ul.
29 Listopada from ul. Szwolezeréow.

The adding of one storey to the building and adaptation of the attic,
conducted in accordance with the recommendations of the Warsaw
Monuments Conservator - using modern forms, according to the Team of
Experts, must be conducted using very modest architectural forms that
visually do not overwhelm the original two-storey block of the building.

According to the Team of Experts the fact that planned investment is
located in immediate vicinity of the historical complex of tazienki
Krélewskie does not prevent construction of new buildings but imposes the

need to use architectural forms that do not complete with the historical
neighbourhood and the use of shapes with neutral, clam tectonics.
The National Centre is a public expert body of consultative character, not forming part
of the conservation authority in Poland.**° As such, its opinion could not give rise to
legitimate expectations. Neither was the Claimant (and its predecessors) entitled to
expect that the Warsaw Conservator or the City would follow that opinion.

Further, the Opinion of the National Centre corresponds to the recommendations of
the Warsaw Conservator made in 2009. The National Centre also underlined that the
perpetual usufructuary was allowed to build only one additional storey and one
additional attic, which could not overwhelm the Museum. The same recommendations
were made by the Warsaw Conservator in 2007 and 2009.

Finally, the Opinion of the National Centre postdates the Claimant's decision to invest.
Therefore, the Claimant could not rely on it at the critical time.

. Here again, the Claimant cannot be said to have received — or placed reliance upon -

a representation from which any legitimate expectation could be derived.

4. The 2009 Letter of the Provincial Conservator

The Claimant further invokes the 2009 letter of the Provincial Conservator, arguing
that it essentially confirmed that the Barracks were not included individually in the
Register and, therefore, lacked protection.

lt is indeed correct that the Provincial Conservator stated that the Barracks were not
individually entered into the Register. At the same time, the Provincial Conservator
noted that the Barracks were located within the area covered by the 1971 Decision.
He expressly drew Parkview Terrace’s attention to existing restrictions:

This decision imposes certain restrictions to be complied with by the owner
or holder of the property at the construction stage.5®°

Thus, even though the Provincial Conservator stated that the Barracks were not
recorded in the Register, that statement did not imply that the Barracks were not
otherwise protected. Neither did it mean that the Barracks would never be entered

into the Register, a the expert engaged by the Claimant, did
confirm.°®*

Finally, here again the chronology of events defeats the Claimant's argument. Indeed,
the Provincial Conservator issued the letter in question five months after the Claimant
made its investment.

As a result, once more, the evidence before the Tribunal indicates that the Claimant
cannot be said to have received — or placed reliance upon - a representation in relation

to the 2009 letter from the Provincial Conservator.

5. The PUA

Finally, the Claimant relies on the PUA and claims that it had a legitimate expectation
that it would not be terminated,

The Tribunal has held that there was a valid ground for termination of the PUA, as the
Barracks had been demolished in 2011 and the purpose of the PUA was merely
frustrated. °°? By demolishing the Barracks, the Claimant used the Property in a
manner obviously inconsistent with the PUA. In the circumstances, there can be

no of ions of non-ter

 

6. Conclusion

On this basis, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant has failed to demonstrate that
it had any legitimate expectations on the basis of the documents and statements by
the Polish authorities in connection with the development of the Property.

(iii) The principle of good faith

The Claimant argues that the Polish authorities acted in bad faith by using the 1971
Decision as a tool to deny the Claimant and its predecessors the necessary
authorizations for the development of the Property. In support of its position, the
Claimant relies on Prof. Schreuer who has written that “[b]ad faith action by the host

State includes the use of legal instruments for purposes other than those for which
they were created”.***

The Tribunal sees no instance of bad faith on the Respondent's side. On the contrary,
as already established,*® the Warsaw Conservator and the City properly applied
Polish law when refusing to issue a new WZ decision in 2009, because the proposed
development encroached upon the Museum's land and did not comply with the
building height restrictions as set forth by the Warsaw Conservator's
recommendations.

It should also be noted that the Claimant's predecessors were in the possession of
the 2005 WZ Decision and Building Permit, which enabled them to develop the
Property, which is another aspect of the Claimant's bad faith submission, had they
chosen to do so.

As to the Museum's involvement, the Tribunal has already established that the City
had no hidden agenda with the Museum.*© The termination of the PUA was prompted
by the demolition of the Barracks,5®” nor by a conspiracy between the City and the
Museum.

(iv) The prohibition of discrimination

The Claimant contends that the projects of DD: ap which are

supposedly similar to the Claimant's, were afforded better treatment.

As a general matter, the Tribunal notes that the Claimant has provided rather limited
information about the alleged similarities between the Property and these two other
projects. However, even such limited information reveals that these projects were
markedly different from the Claimant's.

Itis true that @Ba1s0 failed to comply with the time limits set in its perpetual
usufructuary agreement and that this failure did not cause the termination of such
agreement. However, QED ituation cannot be compared to the Claimant's
circumstances. What triggered the termination of the PUA was not the delay in
completion, but the demolition of the Barracks, a critical fact not found i 7

As a result, the Tribunal is bound to conclude that the Respondent did not discriminate
against the Claimant by favouring other investors in like circumstances, as the
circumstances cannot said to have been ‘like’.

(v) Conclusion

In light of the foregoing discussion and of the conclusions set forth in paragraphs 569,
573 and 578, the Tribunal holds that the Respondent did not breach its obligations to
accord the Claimant and its investment fair and equitable treatment under Article 3 of
the Treaty. The claim based on such provision is therefore dismissed.

D. OVERALL CONCLUSION

580. On the basis of its analysis, the Tribunal reaches the result that it has jurisdiction over

the claims arising out of Articles 3 and 4 of the Treaty. However, on the evidence
before the Tribunal these claims are not well-founded and must necessarily therefore
be dismissed. Consequently, there is no requirement for the Tribunal to address the
Respondent's argument that the Claimant does not deserve Treaty protection on the
ground of the clean hands doctrine.

C. ANALYSIS

1. Legal Framework

589. Both Parties seek an award of the entirety of the costs related to this arbitration,
including the legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with these proceedings,
the Arbitrators’ fees and expenses and the SCC administrative costs. The Tribunal
notes that the SCC Rules applicable by virtue of paragraph 63 of the ToA grant the
Tribunal certain discretion when awarding costs, which the Parties do not dispute.
Neither do the Parties dispute that the allocation of costs is governed by the SCC
Rules, specifically Articles 43 and 44.

590. Article 43 of the SCC Rules defines the costs of the arbitration as the fees of the
Tribunal, the SCC’s administrative fee and the expenses incurred by the Tribunal and

the SCC (the “Arbitration Costs”). Article 44 of the SCC Rules governs the allocation
of “any reasonable costs incurred by another party, including costs for legal
representation” (the “Party Costs’). Articles 43 and 44 of the SCC Rules also provide
the following guidance on cost allocation:

Article 43

... 5. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the Arbitral Tribunal shall, at
the request of a party, apportion the costs of the Arbitration between the
parties, having regard to the outcome of the case and other relevant
circumstances.

Article 44

Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the Arbitral Tribunal may in
the final award upon the request of a party, order one party to pay any
reasonable costs incurred by another party, including costs for legal
representation, having regard to the outcome of the case and other
relevant circumstances.
Thus, the SCC Rules grant the Tribunal a wide discretion in determining the allocation
of costs among the Parties, as long as the Tribunal has “regard to the outcome of the

case and other relevant circumstances”.

During the first stage of these proceedings, the Respondent invoked a number of
jurisdictional objections with respect to the scope of the Arbitration Agreement, the
existence of a protected investment and protected investor. All of these objections
were denied in the Award on Jurisdiction, as varied by the judgment of the English
High Court.

During the second phase, the Respondent raised a new jurisdictional objection on the
basis of the Achmea Judgment. The Claimant objected to the admissibility of this
objection, relying inter alia on the principles of functus officio and res judicata. As a
result, in addition to the merits of the dispute, this Award deals with the Respondent's
Achmea Objection as well as the defences raised by the Claimant. After analysis of a
number of submissions by the Parties and the EC, the Tribunal eventually denied the
jurisdictional objection and pri ded to the of the merits of the case.

However, despite the determination that jurisdiction covered potential violations of
Article 3 and 4 of the Treaty, the Claimant's claims that the Respondent expropriated
its investment and failed to accord it fair and equitable treatment turned out not to be
well-founded in fact and law. More specifically, the Respondent was successful in its
defense and demonstrated that its measures were justified in light of the Claimant's
demolition of the Barracks, which enjoyed a high level of protection under Polish law.
The Tribunal thus dismissed the claims in their entirety.

133

595.

In these circumstances, mindful of its wide discretion afforded in cost allocation and
with due regard to the Parties’ relative success and failure in submitting their claims
and defenses, the Tribunal i that the cost ion that most appropriately

 

reflects the outcome of the proceedings is for the Claimant to bear the entirety of the
Arbitration Costs, its own Party Costs and contribute towards the Respondent's Party
Costs.

582

At the outset, the Tribunal observes that Party Costs include the entirety of the costs
associated with legal representation (i.e., costs of external legal counsel, expert costs,
associated expenses (travel, translation, courier)), etc. The Parties appear to have
the same understanding in this respect.

According to the Respondent, its Party Costs are composed of (i) the work performed
by the General Counsel to the Republic of Poland (the “PGRP”) and (ii) the various
expenses incurred by the Ministry of Development (the “MoD”). The PGRP paid the
legal fees of external counsel and incurred its own costs of legal representation, all in
the amount of PLN 1,875,151.20 and GBP 7,232.00.5® The MoD paid the experts’
fees, the hearing expenses, the translation costs, and other expenses in the amount
of PLN 503,375.65.5*' The total amount of the Respondent's Party Costs incurred by
the MoD and PGPR thus amounts to GBP 7,232.00 and PLN 2,378,526.85 (i.e., PLN
1,875,151.20 (costs incurred by the PGRP) + PLN 503,375.65 (costs incurred by the
MoD)).

The Tribunal also notes that the PGRP has claimed “in-house” costs as a result of the
work performed by its employees at the average hourly rate of PLN @iBapprox.
EUR@® per hour.*®? In principle, the Tribunal finds the Respondent's request for
reimbursement of these costs to be reasonable, and the Claimant too has raised no
objection in this regard.

For completeness, the Tribunal also notes that the Parties have not challenged the
reasonableness of the costs incurred by the other side, nor pointed to any conduct
that would have led to time or cost inefficiencies in this arbitration. Indeed, the Tribunal
considers that both sides conducted this arbitration fairly and professionally, which

permitted the Tribunal to focus its efforts on a fair and efficient adjudication of this
dispute.

In sum, having due regard to the Parties’ relative success and failure over the course
of this arbitration, the Tribunal finds it appropriate and reasonable to order the
Claimant to pay the Respondent a lump sum of PLN 850,000 as a contribution
towards the Respondent's Party Costs.

4. Interest

604.

605.

. The Tribunal further observes that both Parties seek the reimbursement of costs with
interest from the date of the Award.5*° However, the Parties disagree as to the
applicable interest rate. The Claimant puts forward a rate of 7% annually, 5%
compounded quarterly.5*° The Respondent claims a rate based on two-year Polish
government bonds, with annual interest rate of 2.1%, compounded annually.

In light of the interest rates which have prevailed in the financial markets for some
time now, which are very low and sometimes even negative, the Tribunal considers
that the Respondent's claimed interest rate of 2.1% compounded annually is
appropriate. Applying the fixed rate of 7% proposed by the Claimant would result in
significant overcompensation, as rightly pointed out by the Respondent.

D. CONCLUSION

606. In light of the above, the Claimant shall reimburse the Respondent's share of the

Arbitration Costs in the amount of PLN 1,434,300.28 and contribute PLN 850,000
