CHAPTER I. THE PARTIES

A. Claimant

1. Claimant in this arbitration is Gold Reserve Inc. (hereinafter “Gold Reserve” or “Claimant”).
Gold Reserve is a mining company incorporated under the laws of the Yukon Territory in Canada
and is listed on the Toronto Venture Exchange and the NYSE Amex. Claimant’s registered
address is at Suite 200, 926 West Sprague Avenue, Spokane, Washington 99201, United States.
Claimant is represented in this arbitration by Ms Abby Cohen Smutny, Mr Darryl S. Lew, Mr
Hansel Pham, Mr Petr PoléSek and Mr Michael Roche of White and Case LLP (Washington,

United States).

B. Respondent

2. Respondent in this arbitration is the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (hereinafter “Venezuela”
or “Respondent”). It was originally represented in this arbitration by Dr Ronald E.M. Goodman,
Ms Melida Hodgson and Mr Alberto Wray of Foley Hoag LLP (Washington, United States).
Their authority was revoked by letter dated 10 May 2011.' Venezuela was then represented by
the Attorney-General; Venezuelan counsel, Mr Antonio Guerrero and Mr Luis Torres Darias
(appointed on 22 February 2011); and Mr Paolo di Rosa and Ms Gaela Gehring Flores of Arnold
& Porter LLP (as of 12 May 2011). On 27 September 2011, Respondent informed the Tribunal
that Foley Hoag LLP had been reappointed to represent Respondent, and on 28 September 2011,
Respondent revoked the authority of the Venezuelan counsel, Mr Antonio Guerrero and Mr Luis
Torres Darias. Venezuela is also presently represented by Dr Manuel Enrique Galindo
Ballesteros, Procurador General (E) de la Reptiblica of the Procuraduria General de la

Repiiblica.

CHAPTER II. THE PARTIES’ CLAIMS AND PRAYERS FOR RELIEF

3. The dispute has its origins in a number of mining concessions, known as the “Brisas
Concession” and the “Unicornio Concession”, and mining rights held indirectly by Claimant in
Venezuela.

' The termination of their authority was based upon Venezuelan regulations which forbid the renewal of legal

retainers after the retainer has been in force for three years. The competence and integrity of these Counsel is
beyond question.

4. Claimant submits that Respondent has violated Articles II, III and VII of the Treaty between the
Government of Canada and the Government of Venezuela for the Promotion and Protection of

Investments, which entered into force on 28 January 1998 (the “BIT”). Respondent disputes this.

5. Claimant requests that the Tribunal:
1) Hold that Respondent breached its obligations under Article II of the BIT;
2) Hold that Respondent breached its obligations under Article III of the BIT;
3) Hold that Respondent breached its obligations under Article VII of the BIT;

4) Award Claimant compensation in the total amount of US$ 1,735,124,200, plus interest
running from 14 April 2008 up through the date of the award at the US Prime Rate of
interest plus 2 percent, compounded annually;”

5) Award Claimant compensation on such other basis as the Tribunal may deem to be
warranted;

6) Award Claimant the amount of the legal fees and costs incurred in these proceedings; and

7) Award Claimant interest on the full amount of the Award so established, up to the
date of payment, at the interest rate equivalent to the annualized yield on US dollar-

denominated Venezuelan Government bonds, compounded annually.’

6. Respondent requests that the Tribunal:
1) Find that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear Gold Reserve’s claims with respect to
the Brisas and Unicornio Concessions in accordance with Article XII of the BIT;

2

Find that Claimant has failed to state a claim with respect to its Choco 5 claim and that

this claim is therefore not admissible;

3) If it has jurisdiction to hear Claimant’s claims, find that Claimant’s claims should be
dismissed in their entirety; and

4) Award Venezuela compensation for all the expenses and costs associated with defending

against the claims.*

* In its Memorial, Claimant had originally requested a total amount of US$ 1,669,351,700, plus interest running
from 14 April 2008 up through the date of the award at the US Prime Rate of interest plus 2 percent, compounded
annually. Claimant’s Memorial, para. 467.

a list of the questions that it requested the Tribunal to address in its decision. Claimant’s Joint Expert Procedure
Post-Hearing Brief, pp. 58-63.

CHAPTER III. SUMMARY OF THE MAIN FACTS OF THE CASE

A. Introduction

7. The subsequent summary is intended to provide a general overview of the issues in dispute
between the Parties. It is not intended to be an exhaustive description of all facts considered
relevant by the Tribunal. These will be addressed in the context of the Tribunal’s analysis of the
issues in dispute, and will be supplemented by relevant facts, including those provided by
witnesses and experts in their written statements and reports and in the course of oral examination

at the hearings.

8. Mining of minerals in Venezuela generally works in the following way. While the minerals
belong to the State, a private party is permitted to exploit those minerals when the State grants it a
concession, which, through conditions in the concession and mining law and regulations, gives that
party a set of rights and obligations. The Ministry of Mines (initially known as the Ministry of
Energy and Mines, or “MEM”, then later as the Ministry of the People’s Power for Basic
Industries and Mining, or “MIBAM”), oversees the concessionaire’s compliance with a mining
title, law and regulations. Concessionaries must file an annual report with MIBAM, and MIBAM

must verify whether they have complied with their obligations.

9. The Ministry of the Environment (initially known as the Ministry of the Environment and Natural
Resources, or “MARN”, then later as the Ministry of the People’s Power for the Environment, or
“MinAmb”) issues permits and approves environmental impact studies to ensure that the

concessionaire exploits the mine in accordance with Venezuelan environmental standards.

B. Concessions Held by Claimant

The Brisas Concession

10. The Brisas (or Alluvial Gold Exploitation) Concession covers the near-surface gold resources

located within the 500-hectare Brisas property. The Brisas property is in the Kilometre 88 mining

district in South-Eastern Venezuela. The Brisas Concession was for 20 years, and could be
renewed for two additional ten-year terms if so requested six months before expiration (“Brisas

Concession” or “Alluvial Concession”).

-On 18 April 1988, the Brisas Concession was granted to a Venezuelan company, Compajiia

Aurifera Brisas del Cuyuni, C.A. (“Brisas Company”).° In November 1992, Gold Reserve de
Venezuela, the Venezuelan subsidiary of the United States company Gold Reserve Corporation
(hereinafter, Gold Reserve Corp.), acquired the Brisas Company.° On 5 October 1998, Gold
Reserve Inc., the Claimant, was incorporated in Canada as a wholly owned subsidiary of Gold
Reserve Corp.” In early 1999, Gold Reserve Inc. became the parent company of Gold Reserve
Corp. Gold Reserve Inc. thus became indirectly the owner of the Brisas Company, which held the

Brisas Concession.

The Unicornio Concession

. In 1993, the Brisas Company applied for rights to the hard rock mineralisation underlying the

Brisas Concession. MIBAM granted the Brisas Company the Unicornio (or Hard Rock)
Concession on 3 March 1998. This granted the Brisas Company the right to extract gold, copper
and molybdenum from the hard rock underlying the Alluvial Concession. The Unicornio
Concession, like the Alluvial Concession, was for a period of 20 years, and could be extended for
two additional ten-year terms if so requested six months before expiration (“Unicornio

Concession’).

The Brisas Project

. Following the grant of the Unicornio Concession, which underlay the Brisas Concession, for

reasons of better coordination and efficiency Gold Reserve planned to exploit the two Concessions

together as part of a larger Brisas Project (“Brisas Project’).

C. Events Subsequent to the Acquisition of the Brisas and Unicornio Concessions

In August 1993, Gold Reserve submitted to MIBAM a “Geo-exploratory and Techno-economic”
Feasibility Study regarding the Brisas Concession. MIBAM approved this study on 24 February
1994 (“Feasibility Study”).®

. From 1993 to 1998, Claimant? applied for and was granted by MinAmb six Authorisations to

Affect Natural Resources (“AARNs”), each for one-year term, regarding the Brisas Concession,

which allowed Claimant to, for example, build roads or clear land.

. Claimant submitted an Environmental Impact Study (“EIA”) on the project for the exploitation of

alluvial gold in the Brisas Concession to MinAmb on 14 October 1998.'° Claimant informed the
MinAmb of the underlying Unicornio Concession it had obtained earlier that year and stated its
intention to exploit both Concessions in an integrated or comprehensive manner. It also requested
that MinAmb grant it authorisation to affect resources for the purposes of the exploitation of the

Alluvial Concession in accordance with the study.

. MinAmb approved the EIA on 28 October 1999,'! but did not grant Claimant the authorisation to

exploit the Brisas Concession. MinAmb instead stated that it would assess the environmental

impact for the other areas in the expanded project.

. Claimant applied for and was granted a one-year extension to submit its feasibility study for the

Unicornio Concession. On 22 February 2001, it submitted to MIBAM the “Unicornio Concession
Technical Financial and Environmental Feasibility Study”.!? The study in fact referred to both
Concessions or the Brisas Project. It was supplemented on 27 November 2002 and again

throughout the project (“Brisas Project Feasibility Study”). After requesting additional

information, MIBAM approved this study on 6 January 2003 as complying with the Special

Advantage No. 5 of the Unicornio Concession. 8

. Claimant had also examined the possibility of exploiting the Brisas and Unicornio Concessions

together with the neighbouring Las Cristinas properties. In September 2001, Corporacién
Venezolana de Guayana (“CVG”), the State-owned regional development corporation, announced

that it would pursue the combined Las Cristinas-Brisas project. Respondent later elected not do so.

. On 25 June 2004 and 14 December 2005 respectively, MinAmb authorised Claimant to occupy

Zuleima and Barbara, two parcels of land adjoining the Brisas and Unicornio Concessions. 4

. On 29 July 2005, Claimant submitted the Brisas Project Environment and Socio-Cultural Impact

Study to MinAmb, and requested that MinAmb issue the AARN for the phase of construction of
the Infrastructure and Services and for the phase of gold and copper mineral exploitation for the
Brisas Project (hereinafter “V-ESIA of the Brisas Project” or “V-ESIA”).'° On 31 July 2006,
MinAmb informed Gold Reserve that it intended to conduct a “Strategic Environmental
Evaluation” (“EAE”) to complement the studies submitted so far.!© On 19 December 2006,
MinAmb invited Claimant and CVG to conduct a EAE.'7 MinAmb indicated that rather than
issuing a single permit, it would prefer to issue separate permits for each phase of the work. On 30
January 2007, Claimant submitted an updated V-ESIA in respect of which it renewed the request
made on 29 July 2005. 'S On9 February 2007, MinAmb approved Claimant’s V-ESIA for part of

the works of the Brisas Project.'

On 27 March 2007, MinAmb issued the “Authorization to Affect Natural Resources for the
Infrastructure and Services Construction Phase of the Brisas Project for the Exploitation of Gold

and Copper Mineral” (the “Construction Permit”, also referred to as “Phase I Permit”).*° The

effect of the Construction Permit was that, provided Gold Reserve complied with certain
conditions specified in the Construction Permit, and provided the MinAmb signed an Initiation Act

formally recognising that Claimant had so complied, Claimant could begin construction.

On 16 May 2007, Claimant provided MinAmb with evidence of its compliance with the
Construction Permit conditions, and requested that MinAmb sign the Initiation Act.?! MinAmb
did not respond to this request. On 11 July 2007, Claimant sent another written request.”
MinAmb then advised Claimant that it would not sign the Initiation Act until Claimant addressed
its concerns over the location of a proposed alternative access road to the Brisas Project site. On
25 July 2007, Claimant submitted a plan to re-route the road, which was approved by MinAmb on
14 August 2007.7°

On 14 April 2008, MinAmb issued Administrative Ruling No. 088-08 declaring the “absolute

nullity” of the Construction Permit and revoking it for “reasons of public order.”

. The Brisas Concession was set to expire on 18 April 2008, 20 years after it had initially been

granted. On 17 October 2007, more than six months before the date of the expiry, Claimant had
submitted to MIBAM an application to extend the Brisas Concession.”* It attached a certificate of
compliance that MIBAM had issued on 14 September 2007, which stated that Claimant had fully
complied with the provisions of the corresponding 1999 Mining Law and was “solvent”. In
August 2008, MinAmb told Claimant that it had been advised by MIBAM that the Brisas
Concession had expired in April 2008. Upon enquiring with MIBAM, Claimant was told that
there had been an omission as MIBAM had received the request for an extension, but had not

properly filed it.27 On 18 March 2009, MIBAM issued a Suspension Order suspending all mining

activities in the Brisas Concession, stating that there was no evidence in the file of an

administrative act extending the Brisas Concession.”*

On 25 May 2009, MIBAM issued a resolution denying Claimant’s requested extension and
terminating the Brisas Concession, citing Claimant’s lack of solvency and alleged failure to

comply with a number of Special Advantages.”

. In October 2009, the Government seized Claimant’s assets and occupied the site of the Brisas

Project. On 20 October 2009, MIBAM commenced an administrative proceeding to revoke the
Unicornio Concession.*” Claimant filed a challenge to termination proceeding on 18 November

2009,7! then discontinued that challenge on 4 March 2010.

On 17 June 2010, MIBAM terminated the Unicornio Concession on two grounds: first, Claimant
had allegedly failed to commence exploitation within 7 years, in violation of Article 61 of the 1999
Mining Law; second, Claimant had breached Special Advantage No. 10 regarding the hiring of

: 3
interns.”

CHAPTER IV. THE PROCEDURE

General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration and, on the same day, in accordance with
Article 4 of Schedule C of the Additional Facility Rules (hereinafter “the Arbitration (Additional
Facility) Rules”), dispatched to the Parties the Notice of Registration, inviting them to proceed to

the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal.

By letter to the Secretary-General of ICSID dated 8 January 2010, Claimant noted that the Parties
had failed to reach agreement on the number of arbitrators and the method of their appointment
within 60 days of the registration of the Request for Arbitration. Claimant also invoked Article

9(1) of the Additional Facility Rules.

On 11 January 2010, the Secretary-General informed the Parties that the Tribunal would be
constituted in accordance with that Article (i.e., the Tribunal would be comprised of three
arbitrators, with one arbitrator appointed by each party and the third, the President of the Tribunal,
appointed by agreement of the Parties). The Secretary-General also informed Respondent that
pursuant to Article 9(1) of the Additional Facility Rules, Claimant had appointed Professor David
AR. Williams QC, a national of New Zealand, as arbitrator and proposed Professor Hans van
Houtte as President of the Tribunal. The Secretary-General invited Respondent to name an
arbitrator and either to concur in the appointment of Professor van Houtte as President or to

propose another person.

On 7 February 2010, Respondent appointed Professor Pierre-Marie Dupuy as arbitrator.

. Professor Williams accepted his appointment on 14 January 2010 and Professor Dupuy on 9

February 2010.

By letter dated 9 February 2010, Claimant noted that after 90 days from the registration of the
Request for Arbitration the Tribunal had not been constituted and the Parties had not agreed to
extend the time for doing so. Claimant requested that, pursuant to Article 6(4) of the Additional

Facility Rules, the Chairman of the Administration Council appoint the President of the Tribunal.

. By email of 27 February 2010, Claimant informed the Secretariat that the Parties had agreed to

extend the time for the constitution of the Tribunal.

agreement to appoint Professor Piero Bernardini as the presiding arbitrator. The Secretariat

acknowledged receipt of these letters by letter dated 5 March 2010.

. Professor Bernardini accepted his appointment on 9 March 2010.

On 9 March 2010, the Secretary-General of ICSID informed the Parties that, having received from
each arbitrator the acceptance of his appointment, the Arbitral Tribunal (the “Tribunal”) was
deemed to have been constituted, and the proceedings were deemed to have begun on that date.
The Secretary-General designated Mrs. Katia Yannaca-Small to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.
By letter dated 9 September 2010 the Secretariat informed the Parties and the Tribunal that Mrs.
‘Yannaca-Small had been replaced as Secretary by Ms Janet Whittaker. By letter dated 16
November 2012, the Centre informed the Tribunal and the Parties that Ms Ann Catherine
Kettlewell, ICSID Counsel, had been appointed as Secretary of the Tribunal in replacement of Ms

C. Exchange of Written Pleadings

The agenda set out in the Minutes of the First Session directed Claimant to file its Memorial on the
Merits by 24 September 2010, and Respondent to file its Counter-Memorial no later than 7 March
2011.

. In accordance with this agenda, Claimant filed its Memorial dated 24 September 2010, together

with exhibits; international legal authorities; Venezuelan legal authorities; the expert reports of Mr
Brent C. Kaczmarek of Navigant Consulting, Mr Richard J. Lambert, Mr Allan R. Brewer-Carias,
Professor Luis A. Ortiz-Alvarez and Mr Rex E. Pingle; the witness statements of Mr Arturo Rivero
Acosta, Mr Robert A. McGuiness and Mr A. Douglas Belanger; and the joint witness statement of

Ms Jane Spooner and Ms Mani M. Verma.

By letter dated 19 January 2011, Respondent requested an extension of time until 9 May 2011 for
the filing of the Counter-Memorial in light of Claimant’s refusal to date to produce documents
requested by Respondent. Respondent also suggested that the due date for Claimant’s Reply be 15
August 2011 and the due date for Respondent’s Rejoinder be 21 November 2011. By letter dated
20 January 2011 the Tribunal invited Claimant to comment on Respondent’s letter by 24 January
2011. On 24 January 2011, Claimant replied objecting to Respondent’s request for an extension.
Respondent replied by email dated 25 January 2011, and Claimant replied to this response in its

letter of the same date.

. In its Procedural Order No 1, dated 3 February 2011, the Tribunal granted a one-month extension

of the period for filing Respondent’s Counter-Memorial and the subsequent written submissions.
It therefore directed that Respondent file its Counter-Memorial by 14 April 2011; that Claimant
file its Reply by 15 July 2011; and that Respondent file its Rejoinder by 17 October 2011.

.On 14 April 2011, Respondent submitted its Counter-Memorial on the Merits together with

exhibits; legal authorities; and the expert reports of Mr James C Burrows, Professor Isabel De Los

Rios, Professor Henrique Iribarren and Dr Neil Rigby.

By letter to the Tribunal dated 1 July 2011, Claimant requested an extension from 15 July 2011 to
29 July 2011 to file its Reply, and a corresponding extension until 14 November 2011 for

shortening by one week of the initial time period agreed on for submitting the Reply, and the need

to address jurisdictional issues.

On 4 July 2011, the Tribunal invited Respondent to comment on Claimant’s requested extension

by 6 July 2011.

. By letter to the Tribunal dated 6 July 2011, Respondent informed the Tribunal that it agreed with

Claimant’s proposed extension.

By email to the Parties dated 7 July 2011, the Tribunal confirmed that the revised dates were to be
as follows: Claimant would file its Reply by 29 July 2011, and Respondent its Rejoinder by 14
November 2011.

- On 29 July 2011, Claimant filed its Reply, together with the expert reports of AATA, TetraTech

and Mr Mehrdad Nazari; the reply expert reports of Mr Rex E. Pingle, Professor Luis A. Ortiz-
Alvarez, Mr Richard A. Lambert, Mr Brent C. Kaczmarek (of Navigant Consulting), and Mr Allan
R. Brewer-Carias; the witness statements of Mr Coromoto Gallegos; the reply joint witness
statement of Ms Jane Spooner, Ms Mani M. Verma and Mr Christopher R. Lattanzi; and the reply

witness statements of Mr Arturo Rivero Acosta, Mr Douglas Belanger and Mr Brad Yonaka.

By letter dated 11 October 2011, Respondent requested that the deadline for filing its Rejoinder be
extended to 3 February 2011, and accordingly that the hearing, due to begin on 6 February 2012,
be postponed, citing as its reason that Foley Hoag had been reinstated as counsel for Respondent.
On 12 October 2011, the Tribunal invited Claimant to comment on Respondent's letter. By letter
dated 17 October 2011, Claimant objected to Respondent’s requests. Respondent reiterated its

request in its email dated 19 October 2011.

In its letter of 20 October 2011, the Tribunal directed that the deadline for filing Respondent’s

Rejoinder be extended until 5 December 2011. The Tribunal noted that Respondent had been
given almost four months to prepare its Rejoinder, and that Respondent’s reasons for its request
were based on decisions it had made with respect to changing its counsel twice since filing its

Counter-Memorial.

Respondent objected to the Tribunal’s decision by letter dated 26 October 2011. By its letter dated
27 October 2011, the Tribunal explained that in making its decision of 20 October, it had been
guided by the Parties’ agreement regarding the schedule for the proceeding (ICSID Arbitration
Rule 20(2)), and by the rule of equality of treatment (ICSID Convention Article 52(1)(d)).

. Respondent, in its letter dated 31 October 2011, again requested the Tribunal to reconsider its

decision. Claimant responded on 1 November 2011, again reiterating its opposition to

Respondent’s request.

. By letter dated 5 November 2011, the Tribunal, while correcting the reference previously made to

the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules by referring to the corresponding Article
33(2) of the Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules, confirmed Respondent’s time limit for filing

the Rejoinder and the hearing dates.

By letter dated 29 November 2011, Respondent requested that, if the hearing was postponed to 9
February 2012 (see below for details of this request), it be granted a three-day extension (from 5

December to 8 December) for the filing of its Rejoinder.

Claimant, in its letter of 29 November 2011, objected to Respondent’s request.

Respondent, by email dated 30 November 2011, reiterated its request but confirmed that English
translations of expert reports on damages would be submitted on 8 December, witness statements
in English and Spanish as well as exhibits to the Rejoinder by midday on 9 December, and English

translations of legal expert reports on a rolling basis as available.

By email dated 29 November 2011, and on the basis of Respondent’s undertakings as detailed

above, Claimant withdrew its objection to Respondent’s request for an extension.

. By letter to the Parties dated 1 December 2011, the Tribunal agreed to extend the date for

submission of Respondent’s Rejoinder, subject to Respondent’s commitments that a) it would file
its expert reports on damages together with its Rejoinder; b) it would file the exhibits to its
Rejoinder and all witness statements in both English and Spanish by noon on 9 December; and c) it
would provide translations of its legal expert reports on a rolling basis as soon as they become

available.

On 8 December 2011, Respondent filed its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and the Merits, together with
exhibits; the witness statements of Mr Francisco Salas, Mr Sergio Rodriguez, Mr Alejandra
Gonzalez Moreno and Mr Pedro Romero; the second expert reports of Professor Henrique
Tribarren, Professor Isabel De Los Rios, Dr Neil Rigby of SRK Consulting (both an environmental

report and a mining report), and Mr James C. Burrows of CRA.

D. The Organization of the Hearing of February 2012

. The Tribunal and the Parties had confirmed in the First Session that the hearing would commence

on 5 December 2011 and that ten hearing days would be reserved. On 3 November 2010, the
Tribunal informed the Parties that these dates were no longer possible for the Tribunal and sought
the Parties’ agreement on a fresh set of dates. On 12 November 2010, the Tribunal informed the

Parties that the hearing would take place from 6 February to 17 February 2012.

By letter dated 4 February 2011, the Tribunal expressed a preference for Paris as the venue of the

hearing, and invited the Parties to comment on this proposal no later than 18 February 2011.

. On 17 February 2011, Claimant requested that the hearing be held in Washington, DC. By email

dated 18 February 2011, Respondent made the same request.

. By letter dated 23 February 2011, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it agreed to hold the

hearing in Washington, D.C.

In its letter of 21 November 2011, the Tribunal explained that one of its members needed to
undergo a medical procedure shortly before the hearing, and proposed delaying the
commencement of the hearing until 9 February 2012, and sitting on Saturday 11 February 2012, to

make up the lost time.

By letter dated 22 November 2011, Claimant agreed to the Tribunal’s proposition. By letter dated
9 November 2011, Respondent also agreed to the Tribunal’s proposition, subject to the granting of

a three-day extension for the filing of its Rejoinder.

On 30 November 2011, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties confirming that the hearing would
commence on 9 February 2012, and that the Tribunal would also sit on Saturday 11 February

2012.

By email to the Parties dated 16 December 2011, the Tribunal proposed draft procedural rules for
the hearing. It invited the Parties to confer about the rules and submit their joint comments by 9

January 2012.

On 9 January 2012, the Parties submitted their joint comments. In these, they requested that the
hearing day start at 9:00 a.m. rather than 9:30 a.m., and agreed that time should be shared equally

and that they would submit a draft joint detailed hearing schedule.

On 18 January 2012, the Tribunal transmitted to the Parties the final procedural rules of the

hearing.

. By letter dated 26 January 2012, Respondent informed the Tribunal that the Attorney-General for

Venezuela had passed away. The Tribunal acknowledged receipt of this letter by letter of the
following day, expressing its deep regret for this sad event. Respondent then requested, by email

dated 1 February 2012, that the commencement of the hearing be postponed to 13 February.

By letter of 2 February 2012, Claimant indicated that it would object to Respondent’s proposal if
that proposal were to reduce the time available to Claimant to conduct direct examination of its

own witnesses and cross-examination of Respondent’s witnesses.

On 2 February 2012, the Tribunal agreed to Respondent’s request to delay the commencement of
and hence shorten the hearing, due to the passing away of the Venezuelan Attorney-General. The
Tribunal noted the following points by way of guidance to assist the Parties to agree upon a

schedule for the hearing:

1. “The principle of equal sharing of the available hearing time set forth in
Rule 2.1 of the Procedural Rules for the Hearing does not apply in this new
situation, which is attributable to Respondent. Claimant, therefore, is
entitled to more time than one-half of the five hearing days;

7

oo

79.

80.

82.

2. Unless more time is available, Claimant’s opening submissions should last
no longer than 4 hours and 30 minutes. Respondent is entitled to use equal
time to make its opening submissions;

3. Claimant may call its own fact and expert witnesses in accordance with
Rule 3.2 of the Procedural Rules for the Hearing, which limits the scope of
direct examination to new issues rising since the exchange of witness
statements; and

4. In the event that the Parties do not submit a hearing schedule reflecting the
Tribunal’s positions set forth at 1-4 above by Tuesday, 7 February 2012,
the hearing schedule shall be fixed by the Tribunal.”

. In its letter of 6 February 2012, Claimant, in accordance with Item 16 of the Minutes of the First

Session of the Tribunal and Rule 4.2 of the Final Procedural Rules for the Hearing, requested to
introduce into the record a press release announcing that as of | February 2012 Gold Reserve was

listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

By letter dated 7 February 2012, the Tribunal granted Claimant’s request.

By letter dated 7 February 2012, Respondent requested that the principle of equal time for both
sides be respected, that Claimant not be allowed to present its own fact and expert witnesses, and
that, if Claimant was to be permitted to do so, it must explain which new issues have arisen since

the exchange of witness statements and why those new issues must be presented by a witness.

. Claimant responded in its letter of 7 February 2012, and Respondent replied to this response in its

own letter of 8 February 2012. Claimant sent a further letter on 7 February 2012.

By letter dated 8 February 2012, the Tribunal directed as follows:

“That its directions of 2 February 2012 were confirmed;

2. That Claimant should specify no later than 9 February 2012 which “new
issues” raised in Respondent’s Rejoinder and enclosed witness statements
and expert reports would be addressed by each of its witnesses and experts,
and that no witnesses or experts called by Claimant would be heard in the
absence of this indication;

3. That the hearing schedule would be as follows:

Monday, 13 February: Claimant’s statement of its case (Tribunal’s
questions, if any)

Tuesday, 14 February: Respondent’s statement of its case (Tribunal’s
questions, if any)

Wednesday, 15 February: With continuation on

Friday, 17 February: Time for completion of witnesses’ and experts’
examination, then 2 hours per party to make closing arguments and
answer Tribunal’s questions

4. That the Tribunal reserved any decision regarding the filing of post-hearing
briefs following consultation with the Parties at the end of the hearing.”

83.In its letter of 9 February 2012, Claimant specified the new issues raised in Respondent’s

Rejoinder and enclosed witness statements and expert reports.

84. By letter dated 10 February 2012, Respondent replied to Claimant’s letter. Claimant then
responded by its own letter of the same date. Respondent sent a further letter dated 11 February
2012. Claimant again replied by letter of the same date.

E. R dent’s R for Production of D

85.In accordance with the procedure set out in Section 16 of the Minutes of the First Session,

Respondent submitted its requests for production of documents to Claimant on 15 November 2010.

On 17 November 2010, Claimant invited Respondent to explain the relevance of each of its
requests. Respondent replied on 24 November 2010. By letter dated 1 December 2010, Claimant

refused to produce the requested documents.

On 10 December 2010, Claimant filed its requests for production of documents with the Tribunal

and attached the above-mentioned letters as exhibits.

. By letter to the Parties dated 14 December 2010, the Tribunal requested that Claimant state in

more detail the reasons for its objections to each of Respondent’s requests. Claimant responded on
24 December 2010, and Respondent replied to this response on 14 January 2011. By letter dated
19 January 2011, the Tribunal then invited Claimant to reply in brief to Respondent’s letter of 14

January by 26 January 2011. Claimant filed its reply as directed on 26 January 2011.

. In its Procedural Order No 1 dated 3 February 2011, the Tribunal noted which requests had been

withdrawn, granted certain requests, and refused others.

On 7 February 2011, Claimant supplied Respondent with a USB drive containing copies of the
non-proprietary documents that the Tribunal had requested that Claimant produce. This was
supplemented by a USB drive provided by Claimant on 9 February 2011. Claimant also invited
Respondent to contact it to make arrangements in accordance with the Tribunal’s order that
Claimant allow Respondent’s experts to access proprietary documents. By letter dated 11 February
2011, Claimant informed Respondent that it did not have any documents pertaining to requests 32

and 54.

By email dated 11 February 2012, Respondent inquired whether Claimant could provide “view
only” access to the proprietary documents remotely or at Gold Reserve’s offices in Colorado.
Claimant replied on 14 February 2011, rejecting these propositions but confirming that it could
make the documents available in the manner directed by the Tribunal, namely at its Spokane

offices.

. On 16 February 2011, Respondent informed Claimant that some of the non-proprietary documents

provided on a USB drive were illegible and requested clear copies of them.

92. In a further email of the same date, Respondent proposed the week of 28 February 2011 for

inspecting the proprietary documents at Claimant’s Spokane offices. Claimant agreed to the

proposed dates by email the same day.

. By email dated 17 February 2011, Claimant provided clearer copies.

By letter dated 3 November 2011, Respondent explained that Claimant had only granted
Respondent access to the geological block model on Claimant’s premises, and had not allowed
Respondent to make copies. Respondent alleged that a copy of the model appeared in the expert
report of Mr Lambert, an expert of Claimant. Respondent requested that the Tribunal direct
Claimant to provide Respondent’s experts equal access to the block model, including the right to

make copies.

. Claimant responded in its letter of 4 November 2011, claiming that Claimant’s expert was not

provided greater access to the block model than was provided to Respondent’s experts and that it
had permitted Respondent to take print-outs of the model (which Respondent did not do).
Claimant further stated that it was prepared to allow Respondent’s experts to take screen shots of

the block model.
By letter dated 7 November 2011, the Tribunal noted Claimant’s offer, and invited counsel for the

Parties to coordinate to arrange the necessary access. The Tribunal also reserved the right to

intervene further in the matter if necessary.

F. The Issue of Jurisdiction

. By letter dated 22 December 2010, pursuant to Rule 45(2) of the Arbitration (Additional Facility)

Rules, Respondent objected to the competence of the Tribunal to decide the dispute and requested
that the Tribunal suspend the proceedings on the merits, fix a time limit within which the Parties
might file observations on the objections, and deal with the objections as a preliminary question.
Claimant replied on 23 December 2010 proposing to respond to Respondent’s objections by 14
January 2011 and submitting that Rule 45(4) of the Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules does

not automatically suspend proceedings on the merits.

98. By letter dated 29 December 2010, the Tribunal directed Claimant to file observations on
Respondent’s jurisdictional objections by 14 January 2011; Respondent to file a reply by 31
January 2011; and Claimant to file a rejoinder by 14 February 2011. The Tribunal confirmed that
the proceedings had not been suspended and directed Respondent to continue preparing its

Counter-Memorial for submission on 7 March 2011.

99. Claimant submitted its observations on Respondent’s jurisdictional objections on 14 January 2011.

100. By letter dated 19 January 2011, Respondent proposed that, should its request for an extension
for filing its Counter-Memorial be granted, it would abandon its request for a bifurcated
proceeding, file pleadings on jurisdiction prior to or with its Counter-Memorial, and a one-day
hearing on jurisdiction could ensue. By letter dated 24 January 2011, Claimant agreed that if the
Tribunal thought that further pleadings were warranted, Respondent should submit these with its
Counter-Memorial and Claimant should submit its rejoinder to Respondent’s objections with its
Reply. Claimant also submitted that an oral hearing was unnecessary and that, should oral
arguments be necessary, they could be heard during the hearing on the merits rather than in a

separate one-day hearing.

101. As directed, Respondent filed its response to Claimant’s observations of 14 January on 31

January 2011.

102. Claimant submitted its rejoinder by letter dated 14 February 2011.

103. By letter dated 25 February 2011, the Tribunal stated the following:

“The Tribunal refers to Respondent’s request of 22 December 2010, that the
proceedings on the merits be suspended and that its jurisdictional objections be
treated as a preliminary matter separate from the merits.

In accordance with its letter of 29 December 2010, the Tribunal has examined the
observations filed by both Parties with respect to this request. The Tribunal is of
the opinion that the reasons adduced by Respondent do not warrant the suspension
of the proceedings on the merits. Accordingly, Respondent’s jurisdictional
objections are joined to the merits in accordance with Arbitration (Additional
Facilities) Rule 45(5). The procedural calendar fixed by Procedural Order No. 1
of 3 February 2011 (see para. 18) remains unchanged.”

20

G. Claimant’s Request for Production of Documents

104. In accordance with the procedure set out in Section 16 of the Minutes of the First Session, on 6
May 2011, Claimant requested that Respondent produce documents relating to the pre-arbitration
analysis of its experts, Dr Neil Rigby and SRK Consulting. Claimant also requested that to the
extent that the documents were in the custody and control of the two experts, as opposed to
Respondent, that the Tribunal request Respondent and the two experts to make reasonable efforts
to produce the documents, including by seeking the consent of third parties, or producing the

documents with confidential information redacted or subject to a confidentiality undertaking.

105. By 16 May 2011, since Respondent had not replied, Claimant filed its request for production of

documents with the Tribunal, attaching the letter mentioned above.

106. By letter dated 17 May 2011, the Tribunal invited Respondent to respond to Claimant’s request
by 25 May 2011.

107. By letter dated 24 May 2011, Respondent requested an extension of time for submitting its

response until 1 June 2011, and noted that Claimant had agreed with this request.

108. By letter to the Parties dated 25 May 2011, the Tribunal granted Respondent’s request.

109. On 1 June 2011, Respondent filed its response, in which it objected to all of Claimant’s requests.
Respondent alleged that Claimant had failed to establish that the documents were relevant and

material to the outcome of its case, or in Respondent’s possession.

110. Claimant responded in its letter of 2 June 2011, and Respondent replied to this in its letter of 8
June 2011.

111. On 9 June 2011, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties as follows:

“Having considered the content of the request, Respondent’s comments thereon,
and the Parties’ subsequent correspondence about this matter, the Tribunal has
decided to dismiss Claimant’s request.”

March 2012.

114. By letter dated 16 February 2012, the Tribunal invited the Parties to respond to a list of

questions.

23

115. By further letter to the Parties dated 21 February 2012, the Tribunal invited the Parties to make

the following post-hearing submissions:

1. “A joint proposal for corrections to the transcript, to be delivered to the
Secretary of the Tribunal no later than one month from the date of receipt of
the audio of the hearing;

2. Post-hearing briefs, containing a summary of the Parties’ relevant arguments
as well as an answer to the questions posed by the Tribunal in its letter of 16
February 2012. These briefs should not exceed 50 pages (letter size, double
spaced, font Times New Roman 12), and should not include any additional
evidence, only references to existing documents on the file. They should be
exchanged simultaneously and submitted to the Tribunal by 16 March 2012,
at which point the Tribunal would decide whether reply briefs are necessary.”

116. On 16 February 2012, both Respondent and Claimant submitted their post-hearing briefs.

117. By letter dated 20 March 2012, Respondent objected to Claimant’s submission with its post-
hearing brief of new evidence (namely, Appendix B, Memorandum from the Ministers of Mining,
Energy and Petroleum, and Foreign Relations to the President of the Republic dated 23 August
2011).

118. Claimant responded to Respondent’s objection by letter dated 20 March 2012.
119. The Tribunal, in its letter of 22 March 2012, granted Claimant leave to submit its Memorandum
on the grounds that the Memorandum in part met the request the Tribunal made at the hearing for

information regarding the status and plans for further development of the Brisas Project.

120. By letter dated 21 February 2012, Respondent submitted its corrections to the transcript of the

hearing.
121. The Tribunal then wrote to the Parties on 22 March 2012, reiterating the request made in its
letter of 21 February 2012 that the Parties submit a joint proposal on corrections by 29 March

2012. The Tribunal granted until 12 April 2012 for the filing of a joint proposal.

122. On 6 April 2012, Claimant communicated to the Tribunal the Parties’ agreed amendments to the

transcript to the Tribunal.

24

123. On 25 May 2012, in response to the Tribunal’s directions of 30 April 2012, Claimant submitted
additional materials, and Respondent submitted brief comments on Appendix A to Claimant’s
post-hearing brief. Respondent’s submission indicated that “upon review of Claimant’s revised
Annex A, in a format and manner that more easily allows for a comparison, if necessary,
Venezuela will supplement these comments in order to better respond to the Tribunal’s

we 9933
invitation.”*

By letter dated 26 May 2012, Claimant objected to Respondent’s brief comments in
response to the Tribunal’s directions of 30 April. On 2 May 2012, Respondent expanded on its
observations with regards to Appendix A to Claimant’s post-hearing brief and requested leave to

file, by 8 June 2012, brief comments on Claimant’s submission of 25 May.

124. By letter dated 30 May 2012, the Tribunal confirmed receipt of Respondent’s comments.
contained in its letter dated 28 May 2012 and granted both Parties leave to submit comments. On
8 June 2012, Respondent filed a response to Claimant’s submission of 25 May 2012. On 18 June
2012, Claimant filed observations on Respondent’s submissions of 28 May 2012 and 8 June 2012.

125. By letter dated 21 June 2012, Respondent’s requested leave to file further comments on
Claimant’s submission of 18 June 2012. On the same day, Claimant objected to Respondent’s

request.

126. On 25 July 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 concerning additional evidence

from the Parties’ experts. Specifically, Procedural Order No. 2:

“invites the Parties to request their experts to confer and produce jointly a
report estimating:

the loss of reserves as a result of the absence of a layback agreement within
the North Parcel;

the changes required to adjust the “Brisas Project’s” mine plan due to the
absence of a layback agreement within the North Parcel;

the impact on the fair market value of the “Brisas Project” of (a) and (b)
above.”

127. Procedural Order No. 2 requested that the joint report responding to the directions of the
Tribunal be filed by 15 November 2012, and that the Parties’ comments thereto be filed by 14
December 2012.

J. Implementation of Procedural Order No. 2

128. On 4 September 2012, Claimant requested that the deadlines indicated in Procedural Order No. 2
be amended to allow additional time for the Parties’ experts to confer and present the joint report,
and to provide the Parties extra time to comment on the joint report. At the request of the
Tribunal, by letter dated 12 September 2012, Respondent agreed that additional time to comply

with Procedural Order No. 2 was necessary but instead proposed another procedural calendar.

129. In its 12 September 2012 letter, Respondent also raised objections to Procedural Order No. 2, in
part because it considered that “[t]he three questions posed by the Tribunal have been considered
and addressed by Claimant on site prior to this arbitration and by the Parties and their experts in all
the pleadings in this case.” Respondent further considered that Procedural Order No. 2 required
unnecessary additional expense; nonetheless, Respondent indicated its willingness to assist in the
compliance with Procedural Order No. 2 provided certain confidentiality restrictions concerning

the requested access to the drill-hole data base and geological block model be imposed.

130. On 18 September 2012, Claimant commented on Respondent’s objections of 4 September 2012.
In its letter, Claimant stated that the Tribunal “has the authority to request further expert evidence”

3° Claimant also

and that Respondent had “[failed] to raise its objection in a timely manner.
objected to Respondent’s request for certain confidentiality restrictions concerning the requested

access to the drill-hole data base and geological block model.

131. After considering the Parties’ requests to modify Procedural Oder No. 2, on 20 September 2012,

the Tribunal amended the procedural calendar.

132. By letter dated 10 December 2012, Claimant informed the Tribunal that it had not heard from
Respondent concerning the Tribunal’s request in Procedural Order No. 2. Respondent, by letter
dated 14 December 2012, indicated that it would report back within seven business days, and
advanced the possibility of requesting an amendment to the procedural calendar. Respondent also
requested leave to submit a substantive response to Claimant’s letter of 10 December 2012. By

letters dated 14 December 2012 and 18 December 2012, Claimant submitted its objections. On 19

December 2012, the Tribunal granted Respondent’s leave to comment, by 17 January 2013, on

Claimant’s letters of 18 September 2012 and 10 December 2012.

133. On 21 December 2012, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it would advise them concerning

the implementation of Procedural Order No. 2 in the first weeks of January 2013.

134. By email dated 4 January 2013, Respondent proposed a new timetable for the implementation of
Procedural Order No. 2. On 8 January 2013, Claimant commented on Respondent’s email. The

Parties submitted further comments concerning the issue by separate letters dated on the same day.

135. On 14 January 2013, the Tribunal indicated to the Parties that it would advise them concerning
the implementation of Procedural Order No. 2 after receiving Respondent’s comments on

Claimant’s letters of 18 September 2012 and 10 December 2012.

136. As instructed by the Tribunal by letter dated 19 December 2012, Respondent submitted, on 18
January 2013, comments on Claimant’s letters of 18 September 2012 and 10 December 2012. On
21 January 2013, as previously indicated by the Tribunal, the Tribunal issued directives to the
Parties concerning the implementation of Procedural Order No. 2. In its directives, the Tribunal
requested the Parties to agree on a new procedural calendar by 31 January 2013 and that failure to
do so would result in “the schedule [being] set by the Tribunal” or alternatively, “the Tribunal may
appoint an expert to provide advice regarding the issues indicated in Point 2.1 of Procedural Order

France.

149. By letter of 10 April 2013, Claimant indicated that it would be available on 15 and 16 October
2013 for the hearing and requested that the Parties be allowed to file reply expert reports with their

invited Respondent to comment on Claimant’s letter by 15 April 2013.

150. On 12 April 2013, Respondent confirmed its availability to hold the hearing anytime from 14 to
17 October 2013. Also, in the same letter, Respondent expressed disagreement on Claimant’s
proposal to submit reply expert reports but suggested that, in the event the Tribunal required
additional expert reports, the Parties’ comments be submitted subsequent to the second expert
reports. On the same day, Claimant responded to Respondent’s letter providing further arguments

in favour of its proposal to file reply expert reports.

151. On 15 April 2013, the Tribunal acknowledged receipt of the Parties’ exchanges regarding the

hearing dates and amended the procedural calendar as follows:

153. By email of 25 April 2013, Respondent sent a communication to the Tribunal indicating that
they had reached an agreement with Claimant’s counsel regarding the deadlines suggested by

Claimant on its letter for 22 April 2013. Claimant later confirmed this joint agreement by email.

“The Parties requested that the deadlines be as follows:

The Parties’ Experts will file their initial reports on 10 May 2013

The Parties’ Experts will file their reply reports on 28 June 2013

The Parties’ Counsel will file their comments on the experts’ reports on 5 August
2013.”

Parties.

155. By email of 7 May 2013, Respondent, on behalf of the Parties, requested that the deadline to file
the initial expert reports be extended to 24 May 2013. Shortly after, Claimant confirmed its

30

159. On 3 July 2013, the Parties filed their respective reply expert reports pursuant to Procedural

Order No. 2 and further amendments.

160. By letter of 5 July 2013, Claimant raised an objection to Respondent’s reply expert submission
and requested that the expert report by Mr Pekka Toukkola be stricken from the record, on the
grounds that Mr Toukkola was a newly introduced expert and the amendment to Procedural Order
No. 2 indicated that each Party’s expert would submit a report in reply to the individual report of

the other. Claimant also objected to the content of the issues addressed in Mr Toukkola’s report.

161. On 10 July 2013, Claimant submitted the translations of its reply expert reports. On the same

date, Respondent indicated it would be submitting its translations by 11 July 2013.

162. On 11 July 2013, Respondent submitted the translations of its reply expert reports.

163. On 12 July 2013, Respondent submitted comments on Claimant’s request to strike Mr
Toukkola’s report form the records, challenging all grounds presented by Claimant, and requested

that the request be disregarded.

164. On the same date, Claimant submitted further comments and identified the relevant emails to the
issue raised as exhibit C-1485 and C-1486, which had been submitted with RPA’s Supplemental
Report dated 24 May 2013.

165. By letter dated 15 July 2013, Respondent commented on Claimant’s letter of 12 July 2013,
stating that the email exchanges had reached its expert, but that the expert had not seen it until after

the submission of the reply expert reports.

166. On 17 July 2013, the Tribunal issued a communication in reference to Claimant’s request of 5
July 2013 and Respondent’s reply of 12 July 2013, stating that Mr Toukkola’s report would not be
stricken from the record and that the Parties would have an opportunity to comment on it and to
cross-examine Mr Toukkola at the hearing. By letter of the same date, Claimant objected to the
Tribunal’s decision not to strike Mr Toukkola’s expert report, asserting it had been denied equal

opportunity.

167. On 18 July 2013, the Tribunal invited Respondent to submit comments on Claimant’s objection
of 17 July 2013. By letter of the same date, Respondent expressed disagreement with Claimant’s

assertions.

31

168. On 23 July 2013, having considered the correspondence from the Parties in regards to Mr

Toukkola’s expert report, the Tribunal further decided that:

“The Decision is confirmed. Claimant shall have until August 5, 2013 to
file a short expert reply to Mr Tuokkola’s Expert Report. No further
changes shall be made to the Provisional Timetable.”

169. On 31 July 2013, Claimant, on behalf of the Parties, submitted a letter to the Tribunal with
corrections to be made to the reply expert reports. Respondent later confirmed its agreement by
separate communication. On 5 August 2013, the Parties filed their Comments on the Joint
Procedure Reports. In addition, Claimant filed the Third Supplemental Expert Report of Richard

Lambert.

170. By letter of 6 August 2013, Claimant requested that the Tribunal direct Respondent to withdraw
new exhibits introduced with their Comments filed on 5 August 2013, and all corresponding
references to the same, claiming that Procedural Order No. 2 directed the Parties to submit
comments, and that “such comments plainly were not to include new exhibits but rather were

limited to observations and argument based on the reports of the experts.”

171. As instructed by the Tribunal, Respondent submitted its comments on 8 August 2013 on
Claimant’s letter of 6 August 2013, and it requested that the Tribunal deny Claimant’s request that

Respondent be directed to withdraw its exhibits.

172. By email of 8 August 2013, Claimant raised issue with Respondent’s letter of the same date,
expressing it was “an addendum to its brief” and that it went beyond the Tribunal’s invitation for
comment.*° Further, it requested that, should the Tribunal consider Respondent’s arguments,

Claimant be allowed to respond.

173. On 12 August 2013, Claimant submitted the translations of its Comments on the Joint Procedure
Expert Reports and of its Third Supplemental Expert Report. Respondent submitted the

translations of its Comments on the Joint Expert Procedure on 13 August 2013.

August 2013 and Respondent’s reply of 8 August 2013, noting that Procedural Order No. 2 did not
prohibit the Parties from filing additional exhibits with their comments on the expert reports. The
Tribunal denied Claimant’s request but granted leave for it to file any additional exhibits no later

than 26 August 2013.
K. The Organization of the Hearing of October 2013

175. On 22 August 2013, Respondent sent correspondence to the Tribunal stating that the Parties had

Respondent and offered an alternative one, and requested that a pre-hearing conference be

organized, should the Tribunal deem the hearing necessary.

220. On 10 July 2014, Claimant submitted further information in reference to the Tribunal’s request
at the February 2012 hearing for information regarding the status and plans for further
development of the Brisas Project. On 11 July 2014, Respondent requested leave to submit
comments to the information provided by Claimant. On 21 July 2014, pursuant to the Tribunal’s
instructions, Respondent submitted its response to Claimant’s submission of 10 July 2014. On 23
July 2014, the Tribunal decided not to admit into the record the information submitted by Claimant
since it was unauthorized and untimely and also decided not to admit into the record Respondent’s

letter of 21 July 2014 to the extent it develops arguments in reply.

O. Closure of Proceedings

221. On 23 July 2014, the Tribunal declared the proceeding closed in accordance with Article 44 of
the Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules.

CHAPTER V. THE TRIBUNAL’S JURISDICTION

A. The Parties’ Positions

Respondent’s Position

222. According to Article I(g) of the BIT, in the case of Canada an “investor” must be both “any

enterprise incorporated or duly constituted in accordance with applicable laws of Canada” and one

41

“who makes the investment in the territory of Venezuela”. According to Respondent, Claimant

does not satisfy these requirements.

223. Respondent submits that Claimant is not a bona fide Canadian enterprise within the object and
purpose of the BIT. Following its incorporation under the laws of the Yukon Territory in Canada
in October 1998 (shortly after the entry into force of the BIT in January 1998) and the corporate
reorganization in 1999 by which it acquired indirectly the shares of the Venezuelan subsidiary,
Claimant never moved its operations to Canada, where it had only as a registered agent a Canadian
law firm. It continued to operate as the original US company under the same management and
board of directors, making decisions regarding the so-called Brisas Project from its seat in
Spokane, Washington. According to Respondent, this paper company with no genuine connections
to Canada is not the kind of Canadian entity that the Contracting States had in mind to protect

under the BIT.

224. Alternatively Respondent argues that, should it be held that Claimant satisfy the first prong of
the definition of “investor” based on a strict reading of the BIT, based on the same strict reading
Claimant fails to satisfy the second prong since it is not the one “who made the investment in the
territory of Venezuela”. The fact that its investment consists in the indirect ownership of the
shares of the Brisas Company or in the mining rights held by the latter in Venezuela, as it has
alleged in various sections of the Reply, does not make it the one “who made the investment in

Venezuela”.

225. Respondent states that the Brisas Company has in fact acquired the Brisas and Unicornio
Concessions prior to Claimant’s existence. Claimant did not have to expend any capital to
indirectly “acquire” the shares of the Venezuelan subsidiary due to the share-to-share swap by

which the 1999 corporate reorganization of Gold Reserve Corp. was achieved.

226. It was Gold Reserve Corp. that made the economic contribution to the so-called Brisas Project,
Claimant having misrepresented to Venezuela and the Tribunal what constituted its alleged
investment of nearly US$ 300 million to the project by purposefully conflating Gold Reserve Inc.
with Gold Reserve Corp. in order to piggyback on Gold Reserve Corp.’s history of investments in
Brisas and Unicornio Concessions. Claimant’s equivocal statements to the Venezuelan authorities
and to the Tribunal regarding its association with the Brisas Company were made also in the
Request for Arbitration. The Tribunal should deny the BIT protection to Claimant on the grounds

of abuse of rights.

42

227. Respondent contends that Claimant had not effectively rebutted the lack of significant business

connections to Canada. It failed also to present evidence attesting its allegedly active role in

  

tion. Even if Claimant raised the funds as it

 

making the investment even after the 1999 acqui
alleges, at most it acted as fundraiser and not as actual maker of investments for the Brisas Project,

which was Gold Reserve Corp.

228. Claimant’s nexus to Canada contrasted with its significant links to the United States, Claimant
itself stating that it does not carry on any business in Canada, no offices, employees or any
physical assets being in Canada. On 30 November 2011, Claimant received a notice of delisting

from Toronto Stock Exchange for failure to meet certain listing requirements.

229. In Respondent’s submission, “to make the investment in the territory of Venezuela”, as required
by Article I(g) of the BIT, means to effect, originate or cause the investment to be completed. In
terms of economics, investment is “putting money to work, in the hope of making more money”,
which comports with the object and purpose of the BIT, as mentioned in its preamble, i.e. the
“promotion” of investments by the investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other
Contracting Party as “conducive to the stimulation of business initiative and to the development of
economic cooperation between them”. The particular wording for the definition of “investor”
under the BIT must be given full effect. The 1999 corporate reorganization did not constitute
“making the investment” since it was a share-to-share intragroup swap without any capital

expenditure.

230. Respondent further submits that “acquiring an investment” is not equivalent to “making an
investment”, as the term “make” requires some kind of capital flow or movement of funds to
Venezuela, which was absent in the present case. Claimant’s reference to the definition of
“investment” as including assets “owned or controlled” “directly or indirectly” by an investor

overlooks the fact that in any case Claimant must have also “made” the investment.

231. It is a well-established principle that an investment will not be protected if it has been created in
violation of national or international principles of good faith or “if its creation itself constitutes a
misuse of the system of international investment protection under ICSID Convention.”*! The

proper test against abuse of a legal personality is the test of genuine connection — the mere fact of

*! Gustav FW Hamester v. Ghana, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/24, Award, 18 June 2010, para. 123.

43

Claimant being incorporated in Canada does not fulfil the ordinary meaning of the term “investor”

under the BIT.

232. Respondent suggests that Claimant’s attempt to benefit from the BIT constitutes an abuse of
rights. As explained by the International Court of Justice in the Barcelona Traction” case,
international law mandates “lifting the corporate veil” to prevent misuse of the privileges of legal
personality. Claimant took on the Canadian domicile by setting up a mailbox presence there and
now seeks to benefit from the protection of the BIT by evading bona fide compliance with its legal
requirements. Claimant has made equivocal representations to the Venezuelan authorities and the
Tribunal regarding the nature of its association with the Brisas Project, including referring to Gold
Reserve Inc. as the company that made the investment in 1992, i.e. six to seven years prior to its

alleged acquisition of the investment in Venezuela.

233. Arbitral tribunals have routinely found that misrepresentations of a corporate identity are
indicative of abuse. Respondent refers to evidence that Claimant engaged in abusive treaty-
shopping for more than a decade by the shifting of legal domiciles to gain access to various
treaties. These facts give rise to abuses of rights and establish a basis on which the protection of
the BIT should be denied. The Tribunal should look beyond the formal satisfaction of the
nationality requirement and ascertain whether the alleged investor is the entity that made the
investment by considering the underlying economic reality. The facts of this case demonstrate that
corporate nationality has been misused by Claimant and therefore should be disregarded by the

Tribunal.

Claimant’s Position

234. Claimant contends that Respondent’s arguments that Claimant does not qualify as “investor”
under the BIT because (i) it did not “make” an investment in the territory of Venezuela and (ii) it

does not have a sufficient connection with Canada, have no merit and should be dismissed.

235. It is undisputed that Claimant was incorporated in 1998 under the laws of the Yukon Territory
in Canada and that in 1999 it acquired the shares of Gold Reserve Corp., thereby acquiring

indirectly the shares of the Venezuelan subsidiary that held mining rights in that State’s territory.

* Case Concerning the Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company Limited (Belgium v. Spain) (hereinafter
“Barcelona Traction”), IC} Rep. (1970), Judgment, 5 February 1970.

44

236. However, according to Respondent, “making” an investment in the territory of the other
Contracting Party to the BIT does not include “acquiring” such an investment. There was in fact no
investment “made” in Venezuela for such acquisition, but only an investment made in the United

States.

237. This argument should, in Claimant’s view, be rejected as being contrary to the ordinary meaning
of the terms of the BIT in light of its object and purpose. Claimant referred to the dictionary
definition of “to make” which includes “to acquire”, “to gain through behaviour or effort...” This
is confirmed by the Spanish and French texts of the BIT regarding the definition of “investor”. The
Energy Charter Treaty provides that “make an investment” means establishing new investments or

“acquiring all or part of existing investments.”*>

238. Claimant notes that Respondent itself accepts that there is no real distinction between making an
investment and acquiring an investment when arguing that Gold Reserve Inc. “by acquiring shares

in Gold Reserve Corp. made an investment in the United States.”™

239. Claimant rejects Respondent’s interpretation that it is only the entity that acquires assets in
Venezuela directly, not indirectly or through an investor of a third State, that “makes” the
investment. Claimant says that this interpretation cannot be reconciled with the definition of
investment in Article 1(f) of the BIT, which provides that investment means “any kind of asset
owned or controlled by an investor of one Contracting Party either directly or indirectly, including
through an investor of a third State, in the territory of the other Contracting Party...”.
Respondent’s interpretation is not supported by the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of

the BIT in context, including its preamble.

240. Claimant also argues that the acquisition of investments held by third parties is likely to be
followed by further capital investments by the acquiring party and by stimulated economic
activities for the host State. It says that the investment treaty decisions referred to by Respondent
do not support Respondent’s interpretation that an investment would not be covered by the BIT
unless Claimant had purchased interests in a local company directly, rather than purchasing

interests in a third party that owned the local company and then contributing substantial sums to

®5 Energy Charter Treaty, Article 1(8).
* Reply, para. 403; see also Counter-Memorial, para. 404.

45

the local company’s operations. Claimant invested millions of dollars raised in the Canadian

market toward development of the Brisas Project.

241. According to Claimant, the decision in Encana v. Ecuador*> demonstrates that Respondent’s
objection is without merit. In that case, the relevant treaty had the same definition of investor and
investment as the BIT in this case. The issue in dispute was the same as the present case, namely
whether Encana qualified as an investor under the treaty in view of its acquisition of the shares of
two local companies through another Canadian company, Pacalta, which owned directly said
shares. The tribunal in that case concluded that there was no doubt that Encana qualified as an

investor under the treaty.

242. The reference made by Respondent to Article XVI of the BIT is incorrect. This provision is
misread. It protects investments made before and after the entry into force of the BIT, and only
excludes those disputes arising from actions taken by the Contracting States prior to the BIT’s

entry into force.

243. Claimant further contends that no “genuine link” between a State and its national is required
under the BIT for a national of that State to qualify as an investor in addition to nationality. The
customary rules relied upon by Respondent, which relate to the right of diplomatic protection, do
not apply where special agreements are in place between States regarding claims that may be
presented, except where rules of ius cogens apply (such are not the customary international rules of
diplomatic protection). Nothing in Article XII(7) of the BIT, which refers to “applicable rules of
international law”, supports the conclusion that customary rules regarding diplomatic protection

should apply.

244. While States may impose other conditions in their agreements, such as limiting covered
investors to those that have “substantial business activities” within the territory of their State of
incorporation, there is no basis for a tribunal to impose such a requirement where there is none. As
Claimant is incorporated in Canada, it satisfies the requirement of the BIT and as such is eligible to

claim the BIT protection.

UN3481, UNCITRAL, Award, 3 February 2006.

46

245. Although irrelevant, Claimant nonetheless notes its substantial connections to Canada. It
successfully raised significant capital through the Canadian capital markets, nearly all of which
was directed to its activities in Venezuela. Contrary to Respondent’s assertion, the percentage of
Canadian ownership of its shares rose from 52% to 68% during the period 1998-2005. The
Canadian Government intervened on several occasions in support of Claimant in dealing with
Venezuelan officials. The local authorities clearly understood that Claimant was a Canadian

company, its Canadian identity having been a matter of public record for more than a decade.

246. Claimant submits that there is therefore no basis to deny Claimant the BIT protection, since it
qualifies as an investor under the BIT. Exceptional circumstances must exist to justify a denial of
treaty rights by disregarding legal personality through piercing the corporate veil, as it was the case
in the Barcelona Traction case referred to by Respondent. None of the other cases cited by
Respondent in support of its abuse of rights argument provides any basis to deny Claimant the BIT

protection.

247. Claimant argues that it manifestly did not engage in illegitimate “treaty shopping”. Treaty
shopping occurs when an already existing claim against a State belonging to a party with no treaty
protection is transferred to an entity entitled to treaty protection for the sole purpose of obtaining
access to such a remedy. This is not Claimant’s case since it was incorporated in Canada and made

its investment in Venezuela nearly a decade before the events leading to the dispute.

B. The Tribunal’s Analysis

248. According to Article I(g)(ii) of the BIT, “investor” in the case of Canada means, for non-natural
persons, “any enterprise incorporated or duly constituted in accordance with applicable laws of
Canada who makes the investment in the territory of Venezuela and who does not possess the

citizenship of Venezuela.”

249. Apart from the requirement that the investor “make the investment in the territory of Venezuela”

which will be examined below, according to this definition Gold Reserve has to prove that:

(i) it is an enterprise incorporated or duly constituted in accordance with
applicable laws of Canada; and
(ii) it does not possess the citizenship of Venezuela.

47

250. Both conditions are clearly satisfied in the present case; Gold Reserve was incorporated in 1998
under the laws of the Yukon Territory in Canada and does not possess Venezuelan nationality. No

objections have been raised by Venezuela regarding either condition.

251. Respondent argues that despite being a duly incorporated Canadian company, Gold Reserve
should not be entitled to the protections of the BIT because its management is headquartered in the
United States (and it is essentially one and the same with the US based Gold Reserve Corp.); the
Canadian entity is therefore characterized as a “shell company’. Conversely, counsel for Claimant
stated at the hearing that “Gold Reserve’s decision to incorporate in Canada was not motivated

99 56

primarily by investment treaty concerns”,”” citing instead other reasons including attracting

investment and taxation advantages as the primary motivation for establishing a Canadian parent.*”

252. In the Tribunal’s view, Gold Reserve is a Canadian entity within the definition of investor
provided in the BIT. As many previous ICSID tribunals have found, where the test for nationality
is “incorporation” as opposed to control or a “genuine connection”, there is no need for the tribunal
to enquire further unless some form of abuse has occurred. Such abuse might be found where the
company has been incorporated in a given State after the dispute arose so as to take advantage of a
treaty concluded by that State. This is clearly not the case here. None of the cases referred to by
Respondent indicates that the plain meaning of the nationality test should not be applied in
situations where incorporation in Canada occurred before the dispute arose, for legitimate
purposes. It is irrelevant whether the company is headquartered at the location of incorporation or

if it is the result of a corporate restructuring.”

253. Respondent argued that the present case involves an “extreme” set of facts not seen before in
other ICSID cases. Yet, it has not identified any particular facts that make it so “extreme” when
compared to other cases of alleged “shell” companies where jurisdiction has been held to exist.

There is nothing exceptional in the circumstances of the present case to distinguish it from, for

example, the Saluka case, in which respondent alleged that claimant was no more than a shell
company within a corporate chain, established for no other purpose than to take advantage of the

protections offered by the Netherlands-Czech BIT.

254. The tribunal in Saluka found as follows:

“In dealing with the consequences of that way of acting, the Tribunal must always
bear in mind the terms of the Treaty under which it operates. Those terms
expressly give a legal person constituted under the laws of The Netherlands...the
right to invoke the protection of the Treaty. To depart from that conclusion
requires clear language in the Treaty, but there is none...The parties having
agreed that any legal person constituted under their laws is entitled to invoke the
protection of the Treaty, and having so agreed without reference to any question
of their relationship to some other third State corporation, it is beyond the powers
of this Tribunal to import into the definition of “investor” some requirement
relating to such a relationship having the effect of excluding from the Treaty’s
protection a company which the language agreed by the parties included within
it.”

255. The Canada-Venezuela BIT is clear — the criterion an investor must satisfy involves the place of
incorporation: “any enterprise incorporated or duly constituted in accordance with applicable laws
of Canada”. The Parties could have chosen to include a “genuine link” test or a “management”
test, but did not. The Tribunal cannot read these criteria into the BIT and is therefore satisfied that
Claimant falls within the definition of “investor”, so far as it is a company incorporated in Canada.
In any case, the significant funding of the group sourced through the Canadian financial market
from Canadian investors means that Gold Reserve has a clear and genuine connection to Canada.
Furthermore, and for the sake of argument, even if the requirement of a “genuine link” had been
applicable, Gold Reserve’s substantial connections to Canada were evidenced by the growing
percentage of its shares held by Canadian investors (from 52 to 68% between 1998 and 2005) and
by the direct intervention of the Canadian Government on several occasions in support of Claimant
in dealing with Venezuelan authorities for which the nationality of the investor did not seem in any

doubt.

256. However, incorporation alone is not sufficient to qualify an enterprise as an “investor” of
Canada. As noted above, an investor must also make an investment in the territory of Venezuela.
Respondent provided an account of the corporate restructuring that occurred in early 1999 within

the Gold Reserve group, which has not been disputed by Claimant. This restructure was achieved
through a merger of Gold Reserve Corp. with a subsidiary company of Gold Reserve Inc.,
combined with a share-swap through which shareholders acquired shares in Gold Reserve Inc., the
present Claimant, in return for trading-in their shares in Gold Reserve Corp. As a result, Gold
Reserve Inc. became the holding company of the group while the former holding company, Gold
Reserve Corp., became a subsidiary. No money transfer or flow of funds into Venezuela resulted

from the restructure, which took place through a share-to-share swap outside of Venezuela.

257. By virtue of the corporate restructuring, Claimant has become the indirect owner of the share
capital of the Venezuelan company, Brisas Company, which held title to mining rights and
concessions in Venezuela. There is no dispute that indirect ownership or control of mining rights
constitutes an investment under the BIT. Indeed, the definition of investment in Article I(f)
expressly includes “rights, conferred by law or under contract, to undertake any economic and
commercial activity, including any rights to search for, cultivate, extract or exploit natural

resources”.

258. In addition, the definition of “investment” includes “shares, stock, bonds and debentures or any
other of participation in a company, business enterprise or joint venture” (under Article I(f)(ii)).
Therefore, both the indirect share ownership of a Venezuelan subsidiary and the mining rights and

concessions held by such subsidiary constitute protected investments under the BIT.

259. Since an “investment”, as so identified, may be “owned or controlled by an investor of one
Contracting Party either directly or indirectly...in the territory of the other Contracting Party,”*!
Claimant can be said to control indirectly the concession held by the Venezuelan subsidiary. The

fact that an “investment” exists is therefore not in any doubt.

260. However, the Parties have debated at length whether the process leading to the indirect share
ownership by Claimant of a local subsidiary and, through the latter, to the holding of title to
mining rights and concessions™ satisfies the condition of “making” an investment in the territory
of Venezuela. The dispute is whether the Canadian company can be said to have “made” the

investment, given that the mining rights had already been granted to the Venezuelan subsidiary

°' BIT, Article I(f).

1182-1185.

before the restructure through which Gold Reserve Inc., the Canadian company, acquired Gold
Reserve Corp., the US company. Venezuela argued that, as the investment already existed before
the Canadian company was even incorporated, the Canadian company cannot be said to have made

that investment.

261. According to the ordinary meaning of the words, “making an investment in the territory of
Venezuela” does not require that there must be a movement of capital or other values across

Venezuelan borders.

262. If such a condition were inferred it would mean that an existing investment in Venezuela, owned
or controlled by a non-Venezuelan entity, would not be protected by the BIT if it were acquired by
a third party, with cash or other consideration being paid outside Venezuela, even if the acquiring
party then invested funds into Venezuela to finance the activity of the acquired business. Clearly,
this was not the intention of the parties to the BIT and nor does it reflect the ordinary meaning of
the definition. Whether Claimant made an investment when it acquired the shares in Gold Reserve
Corp., is not affected by the fact that the acquisition took place through a share-to-share swap

outside Venezuela.

263. In EnCana v. Ecuador, the Tribunal considered jurisdiction under the Canada-Ecuador BIT
which has a similar definition of investment. In particular, that BIT included the same

“enterprise...who makes the investment” language found in the Canada-Venezuela BIT.

264. In the EnCana v. Ecuador case, the Canadian parent company similarly acquired the shares in
the previous parent company whose subsidiaries had been granted mining concessions in Ecuador.
All but one of these concession contracts had been granted before EnCana acquired the shares.
While jurisdiction was hotly contested in the case, at no stage did either party or the tribunal find
any issue with the fact that the concession contracts had been granted to the subsidiary companies
before EnCana acquired the parent company. The fact that EnCana acquired the parent which
owned the companies who held the concessions was considered by all to be sufficient to constitute

the “making” of an investment.

265. Respondent contended that the EnCana case can be distinguished from the present case because

this case involves a corporate restructure, as opposed to an acquisition by an arm’s length third

® Supra footnote 55.

Sl

party. In particular, the fact that no money was exchanged for the shares in the US corporation
featured strongly in Respondent’s reasoning. The Tribunal is not persuaded by this argument. The
internal workings of the acquisition does not affect whether the parent “makes” an investment.
This is particularly so where the driver behind the restructure was the ability to access further
funds from the Canadian market which were then used to further the investment in the Brisas
Project.

266. Further cases cited by the Parties support this conclusion. For example, in Millicom v. Senegal

the investment was acquired through an internal restructure.

267. Millicom (a Dutch company) acquired indirect ownership of the local subsidiary which held the
relevant concession two years after the concession had been granted to the subsidiary. This
ownership was acquired through an internal transaction (the local subsidiary having always been
part of the Millicom group). The tribunal did not consider the indirect control exercised by
claimant to be problematic, nor was the fact that it had acquired the shares after the issue of the
concession even raised as an issue by respondent. The only distinguishing factor was that a Dutch
company had always been involved in the ownership structure of the local subsidiary, so in that

sense the Netherlands-Senegal BIT had always been relevant.

268. In Aguas del Tunari v. Bolivia, the tribunal made it clear that the insertion of a Netherlands
company into the ownership structure after the concession had been granted (but before the dispute
arose) did not create any jurisdictional problems, as it did not affect any of the undertakings
contained in the underlying concession agreement. The tribunal found it had jurisdiction under the

Netherlands-Bolivia BIT.

269. Similarly, in Mobil v. Venezuela, the tribunal held that restructuring in order access treaty

protections after a dispute had arisen would be an abuse of process, but to do so in order to gain

protection for future disputes was “‘a perfectly legitimate goal.”

270. In summary, there is no support in previous cases for contentions pertaining to a lack of
investment as a result of (1) the parent company entering the structure after the concession had
been granted; (2) the parent company being inserted as a result of an internal corporate restructure;
or (3) the new parent company being incorporated in a jurisdiction with a BIT which has
previously not been relevant. Therefore, provided that the corporate restructure or investment
transfer is not made for improper purposes (for example, to gain treaty protection after the dispute
had arisen), then the fact that it occurred after the concession had been granted does not affect

jurisdiction.

271. Finally, considering specifically the concept of “making” an investment as required under the
BIT, Respondent notes in its Rejoinder that the making of an investment requires a “contribution
in economic terms.” Again, in opening submissions at the hearing, Counsel for Respondent
stated “[t]he ordinary meaning of the phrase ‘who makes the investment in the territory’ would
appear to be one who positively and personally acts and effects the movement of capital or some
other economic contribution — know-how, for example — into the territory of Venezuela.””° Even if
this were so, Respondent had previously acknowledged Claimant’s argument that post-1999 the
majority of funding came from Claimant (albeit complaining the details of this funding were not
provided). Respondent had attempted to belittle this contribution as amounting to no more than a
“fund-raiser”, and yet the provision of funds (or “‘capital”) seems to be the crux of its definition of
making an investment. As noted above, Claimant has stated that one of the reasons for
incorporating the Canadian entity was to raise funds in Canada for its mining activities in
Venezuela and most of the US$ 300 million invested in the so-called Brisas Project came through

Canadian investors.

272. In conclusion, it is the Tribunal’s view that Claimant satisfies the definition of investor both as a
Canadian incorporated company and as a company that made an investment in Venezuela. The

Tribunal therefore has jurisdiction to hear the claim.

CHAPTER VI. NATURE AND EXTENT OF CLAIMANT’S INVESTMENT

273. This Chapter considers the nature and extent of Claimant’s mining rights that existed at the time
of the alleged BIT breaches by Respondent. In particular, this Chapter examines whether the
Brisas and Unicornio Concessions were validly terminated and whether Claimant had any legal

right to use/access the other parcels of land included in the so-called “Brisas Project”.

274. As noted above, Claimant’s mining rights were owned indirectly through the Brisas Company
which held the relevant concessions in Venezuela. Claimant indicates that the reference date for
the determination of the extent of its mining rights should be April 2008, this being the date on
which the Construction Permit was revoked by Respondent”! and Respondent contends the Brisas
Concession expired.” Respondent has not challenged the use of April 2008 as the relevant date for

damage assessment purposes (if required).

275. In addition to the Brisas and Unicornio Concessions, Claimant asserts that in April 2008 it
enjoyed rights regarding parcels adjacent to the Concessions. Given the size of the Brisas Project,
there was the need to site infrastructure on such parcels of land in order to mine rationally and

according to best industry practices so as to ensure optimum recovery of mineral resources.

276. The parcels as to which Claimant asserts it acquired rights in April 2008 to use for infrastructure
and services for the exploitation of the Brisas Project were: Barbara, Zuleima, NLEAVI,
NLSAV1, Esperanza, Yusmari, the North Parcel (NLNA1-NLNV1), El Pauji, Morauana, Venamo,
Cuyuni and Mireya.

A. Brisas Project

Claimant’s Position

277. According to Claimant, its investment in Venezuela consisted in the mining rights indirectly

owned through the ownership and control of the Brisas Company, the entity holding such rights in

T Supra para. 24.

Venezuela.”* It is therefore to be determined which were Claimant’ s mining rights when, in April
2008, measures were taken by Respondent that, in Claimant’s opinion, were in violation of the

standards of treatment guaranteed by the BIT.

278. Claimant observed that it informed the Administration of its intention to develop the expanded
Brisas Project in 1999. It gained a one year extension to submit the Brisas Project Feasibility
Study, submitted in February 2001. The extension was required because it needed more time to
address the “project” as a whole — being the Brisas and Unicornio Concessions along with
surrounding mining properties needed to support project infrastructure. Many other documents
and permits following this time referred to the Brisas Project. In particular, the V-ESIA addressed
the Project as a whole, which included the surrounding properties. Claimant noted that the

Construction Permit issued in 2007 referred to the “Brisas Project”.

279. Claimant contended that internal MinAmb documents evidence that “the Administration

considered the Brisas Project as an integrated project encompassing several parcels,”’” along with

approvals gained feasibility studies, the V-ESIA and the various permits and authorisations issued

 

which all refer to the Brisas Project.

280. According to Claimant, during the entire course of the works to develop the so-called “Brisas
Project”, Respondent had never raised any objections regarding the merit of the Project, its
environmental impact, its planning, its compliance with law or the Mining Titles. This was so even
when, in 2005, President Chavez announced that all contracts with foreign companies had to be
reviewed to ensure that they provided “maximum benefit” to the State. However, Claimant says its
reliance on the government’s continued good faith evaluation and support of the Brisas Project was

misplaced.

™ The nature of Claimant's investment was made clear at the hearing in February 2012 where the question was put
to its Counsel and answer received as follows: President Bernardini: “So, I gather, but correct me if I'm wrong, you
consider “investment” basically the mining rights that are indirectly owned through the chain of share ownership”.
Mrs. Cohen Smutny: “Yes, absolutely”. (Transcript, February 2012, 1184: 19-22; 1185: 1).

Respondent’s Position

Respondent maintains that Claimant was granted the Brisas (alluvial) and Unicornio (hard-rock)
Concessions and entered into work contracts authorizing the exploitation of various parcels of
land, none of which it ever exploited, subject to the conditions set out in the Mining Titles, the
concessions, the work contracts and the additional contractual requirements. It says that Claimant
misrepresents the operation of Venezuelan law with respect to the obligation to exploit and the
granting of extensions of concessions and, in addition, it ignores the importance of the regulatory
environmental regime regarding its Mining Titles. “Brisas Project” was neither a “Project” nor

“poised for success”, as alleged by Claimant.”°

282. Respondent states that the “Brisas Project” described by Claimant consisted of an enormous

mine pit (comprising of two concession areas, an alluvial one overlying an underground hard rock
concession) and 12 surrounding parcels of land to use for waste rock and liquid storage area, a
crushing plant, a processing plant and other infrastructure. Respondent contends that Claimant
incorrectly states that it had acquired rights of use for these parcels and that it was in compliance

with all its obligations under the mining rights.

283. According to Respondent, the massive “Brisas Project” raised critical environmental issues,

since it was to be located in the environmentally fragile Imataca Forest Reserve, which was subject
to a special management plan not to degrade the environment and to preserve the rights of
indigenous peoples. Eventually, MinAmb granted only a limited Phase I Permit allowing Claimant
to build roads and conduct other preliminary activities while completing a more thorough impact
assessment. When MinAmb realized its mistake in granting the permit, it refused to authorise

initiation of the works and subsequently declared the permit null.

The Tribunal’s Analysis

284. Throughout the Parties’ pleadings, written and oral, reference has been made to the “Brisas

Project” as a term meant to cover more than just one Mining Title or mining right. The term was
introduced by Claimant when, having been granted the Unicornio Concession on 3 March 1998, it

felt the need to combine its development with that of the Brisas Concession, the latter lying on top

™ Counter-Memorial, para. 44.

56

of the former. Claimant considered it was reasonable that, for a number of reasons, the two
concessions should be considered “in an integrated manner as one comprehensive mining

project”.”°

285. Starting in late 1998, Claimant focused on the notion of “Brisas Project”, introducing this new
concept in its correspondence with the Venezuelan Administration. The EIA for the Brisas
Concession filed on 14 October 1998, although not yet referring to the Brisas Project, mentions the
underlying concession obtained earlier that year with the prospect of “assessing it
comprehensively.” This was followed by an exchange of communications from MinAmb on 28
January 1999, requesting modifications for the environmental assessment of the new project”® and
from Claimant on 7 May 1999, responding to the MinAmb and referring, for the first time to the
“Brisas Project.” Reference to the Brisas Project continued to be made throughout 1999 by

Claimant, but not yet by Respondent which referred rather to an “expanded project.”*°

286. The process leading to the introduction of the concept of an expanded project comprising more
than just one Mining Title culminated in February 2001 with the filing by Claimant of the Brisas
Project Feasibility Study where, despite the title, the content referred to the Brisas Project as
comprising the Brisas and Unicornio Concessions as well as NLEAV1I-NLSAV1, Barbara,
Zuilema, NLUNAI-NLNV1, ALUPLATA, VELAPLATA, El Pauji Mining Concession, Morauana
and a strip of land for easements.*! This study was updated by Claimant in November 2002
confirming the components of the Brisas Project.*” NLEAV1 and NLSAV1, Barbara and Zuleima

parcels were made part of the Feasibility Study as “comprising the Brisas Project.”**

287. The Brisas Project Feasibility Study, submitted in 27 November 2002, was approved by
MIBAM on 6 January 2003 as being in compliance with Special Advantage No. 5 of the “relevant

mining title,”** where the “relevant Mining Title” for the Ministry was the Unicornio Concession.
The Parties disagree whether or not, despite this qualification, the Ministry’s approval related

comprehensively to all Mining Titles and rights covered by the Brisas Project Feasibility Study.

288. Reference by Claimant to the “Brisas Project” became common in its relations with the
Administration. All studies prepared and filings made by Claimant since that time referred to this
concept, including the V-ESIA.® As updated, the V-ESIA referred to the two Concessions, Brisas
and Unicornio, and the various mining parcels comprising the Brisas Project. The Study was
approved by MinAmb on 9 February 2007, without objections or comments on the use of the

concept of Brisas Project.*°

Brisas Project. The references made in the Phase I Permit’s text regarding MIBAM® suggest that

MIBAM and MinAmb during those years refer to the Brisas Project.”

project made of multiple parcels.”! Claimant, for its part, was aware that under Venezuelan mining
law each mining right is subject to a separate regulation, as evidenced by the fact that in March
2006 it proposed to MIBAM, without success, to amend the Mining Law to regulate the concept of

“Mining Project.”°

291. The Tribunal recognizes that there was for some time a measure of misunderstanding between
the Parties as to existence and material consistency of the “Brisas Project”, a concept the use of
which had initially been a unilateral initiative of Claimant. Nevertheless, as soon as the competent
Venezuelan authorities, including MIBAM and MinAmb, actually agreed to explicitly use the
same formulation for identifying the integrated project, Claimant was entitled to believe that the
two sides had finally reached an agreement on the existence of the “Brisas Project”, if not
necessarily on the exact scope and consistency thereof. This was at least the case in March 2007,

when the Phase I Permit was issued.

292. The Tribunal finds that the Administration’s conduct, as evidenced by the lack of reaction and,
more than that, by its explicit reference to the concept of the “Brisas Project” in a number of
official documents, founded Claimant’s expectation that it could rely on Venezuela’s acceptance of
this concept as a practical way of dealing comprehensively with all Mining Titles and rights it
intended to exploit. This was particularly the case with respect to the environmental consideration
of mining activity, due to the obvious need for an integrated evaluation of its effects on the
environment. In a document issued by MinAmb on 27 May 2004, one reads:

“The Brisas Project, with an investment of 67 million dollars to date, out of a
required 400 million dollars, is a mixed large mining project (alluvial and vein)
and is considered by the Ministry of Energy and Mines as a project of National
Interest in view of its dimensions and its social and economic effects for the
country.”

In another document issued by MIBAM on 26 September 2006 it is stated as
“Recommendations” to Claimant:

“Proceed before MARN for the Environmental permits for this mining right, as

this forms part of the Brisas Project, which will contribute to the economic and

technological development of the Mining Projects, which to this date are quite
diminished.””*

The time for a change of the State policy regarding mining activities and, more specifically, the

Brisas Project had yet to come.

293. Respondent’s position denying any value to the concept of “Brisas Project” is unwarranted. The
Administration’s conduct reinforced Claimant’s reasonable expectation that further steps would be
taken by Respondent to permit the full exploitation of the Brisas and Unicornio Concessions

through the use of adjoining parcels of land included within the concept of the “Brisas Project”.

B. The Brisas Concession

Claimant’s Position

294. The Brisas Concession was acquired by the Brisas Company in April 1988. In November 1992,
Gold Reserve Corp.’s Venezuelan subsidiary acquired the Brisas Company. Following the
reorganization of Gold Reserve group in early 1999, Claimant became the indirect owner of the

Brisas Company and, accordingly, of the Brisas Concession.

295. Claimant refers to its successful efforts, with the support and approval of the Government, to
bring the Brisas Concession into compliance with the Mining Title and mining law. It says that the
mining rights under the concession were therefore unlawfully terminated by Respondent with

effect from the date of expiration of its initial term, i.e. from 18 April 2008.°°

296. Claimant had filed a timely request in October 2007 to extend the Brisas Concession, as
acknowledged by Respondent.”° When six months passed without a decision by MIBAM,
Claimant contends that the extension was granted by operation of Article 25 of the 1999 Mining
Law. It refutes Respondent’s assertion that the 1999 Mining Law is not applicable.” The May
2009 Resolution purporting to terminate the Brisas Concession relied on Article 25 of the 1999

Mining Law” and, in addition, the Supreme Court ruled in November 2011 that Article 25 of the

°S The Resolution of the MIBAM of 25 May 2009 declaring terminated the mining rights under the Brisas
Concession (point two) states initially that the extension requested is not granted (point 1), thus fixing the
termination date on the expiry of the initial 20-year term (C-91).

1999 Mining Law applies to concessions granted prior to such law, including where the concession

has a special advantage regarding its extension (like the Brisas Concession).

297. Claimant sees no merit in Respondent’s argument that in order to benefit from the positive
administrative silence the concessionaire must be “solvent”, since the decision regarding whether
or not the condition is satisfied must be taken within the six-month time provided by the 1999
Mining Law. In addition, MIBAM repeatedly confirmed Claimant’s “solvencia” by issuing

certificates of compliance, the last one in September 2008. 100

298. Claimant said it had no reason to doubt its compliance with its obligations as concessionaire,
given the certifications of compliance repeatedly received from MIBAM. It had a legitimate
expectation as a matter of Venezuelan law that the Brisas Concession would be extended, as

contemplated also by the Feasibility Study that had been approved by MinAmb in 2003.

299. Under Article 25 of the 1999 Mining Law, MIBAM had six months to decide on the
Concessionaire’s request for extension. If no response was received, the extension would be
deemed to have been granted according to the principle of positive administrative silence. MIBAM
improperly failed to recognize the extension and more than one year after the concession was

extended by operation of law revoked it for reasons that were without a basis in law or fact.

300. Claimant also contends that Respondent’s argument that the Administration is free to decide in
its discretion whether a concession should be extended is wrong. As explained by Professors
Brewer-Carias and Ortiz-Alvarez, a decision whether a concession is to be extended is based on
the standard of “pertinence” under the Mining Law, which is an indeterminate legal concept that
does not provide for a discretionary decision. Instead, the decision should be based on whether or

not an extension is necessary to meet the needs of the project. tol

301. Contrary to what is asserted by Respondent, MIBAM had no discretion to decide whether to

grant an extension, Article 25 of the 1999 Mining Law only requiring the Ministry to determine

whether an extension, would be “pertinent”. Such determination is based on constitutional and

other principles to ensure that it is not arbitrary and is based on “criteria of rationality,

proportionality, equity and justice.” 1

302. On 3 October 2008, MIBAM sent Claimant forms for payment of the surface tax due for the
Brisas Concession through 18 April 2008 (as if the concession had expired on that date). Assuming
this to be due to an oversight, Claimant filed a reconsideration appeal with the office issuing the

tax forms.

303. On 28 November 2008, the office rejected the appeal concluding that the Brisas Concession

expired as of 18 April 2008 in the absence of any evidence that the requested extension had been

granted. to4

304. On 18 March 2009, MIBAM ordered the “immediate suspension” of all mining activities on the
Brisas Concession, the preparation of inventories and the safekeeping of the concession’s assets

5

which were to revert to the State! On 25 May 2009 the Brisas Concession was declared

terminated. '°°

305. Claimant notes that MIBAM’s Resolution terminating the Brisas Concession was based on three
internal memoranda prepared by the Ministry’s offices, two dated 29 April 2009'°7 and one dated
12 May 2009, 108 which purported to find Claimant to be non-compliant with obligations related to
the concession. The two April memoranda asserted that Claimant did not comply with Special
Advantages Nos. 5-9 and 11-14 of the Brisas Mining Title. They post-dated Claimant’s 21 April

2009 notice of dispute under the BIT which was also addressed to the Minister of Mines Rodolfo

Sanz.'°

306. Claimant asserts that MIBAM acted unlawfully because the determination of non-compliance
did not support termination of the Brisas Concession. The requested extension had been supported
by MIBAM’s own written certification unequivocally stating that Claimant “has fully complied
with the provisions of the above [Mining] Law, its Regulations and Mining Titles and is, therefore,

declared Solvent as of 14 September 2007.”!'° Another certificate of compliance was issued one

year later, on 2 September 2008, again confirming that Claimant was “solvent.”!!!

307. Claimant replies as follows to the alleged non-compliance with the Special Advantages referred

to in the April 2009 memoranda:

(i) Special Advantage No. 5 related to the payment of the 3% exploitation
tax of gold refined. Such taxes had been paid, as confirmed in the tax
payment forms submitted to MIBAM.

(ii) Special Advantage No. 6 related to the obligation to use for
exploitation the period of 20 years for which the Concession was
granted. Under the Mining Law, “exploitation” means not only the
physical extraction of minerals but also performing activities
“necessary in order to extract minerals, with the unequivocal intention
of economically exploiting the concession”. These preparatory
activities to develop the Brisas Concession had been performed by
Claimant, as shown by the technical, economic and environmental
studies ultimately approved by the Administration. The theory of
Respondent’s legal expert, Professor Iribarren, that “exploitation” is
synonymous with “extraction”!!? finds no support in the text of the
law.

(iii) | Special Advantage No. 7 related to the commencement of exploitation
within three years from the date of publication of the Mining Title in
1988 in the Official Gazette. This term having already expired when
Claimant acquired the concession in 1992, MIBAM allowed it to cure
the deficiencies of the prior owner, including extending the time-limit
to submit a feasibility study. The latter was approved in February
1994."

(iv) | Special Advantage No. 8 related to the manufacturing and refining of
the extracted minerals within Venezuela. The limited quantities of
minerals extracted by Claimant from 1992 to 1997 were manufactured
and refined in Venezuela, as reported to MIBAM in Claimant’s annual

reports. For the future, the feasibility studies contemplated a processing
plant in Venezuela to that purpose.

(v) Special Advantage No. 9 related to the transfer to Venezuela of mining
technology and to the requirement to establish a training program for
personnel. It required that 95% of the non-laborer employees were to
be Venezuelan citizens within ten (10) years from the commencement
of exploitation. According to Claimant, technology transfer and
development of research activities were achieved by delivering
technical reports and information and making donations. A training
program for employees had been implemented and the targeted level of
95% for Venezuelan non-laborer employees had been achieved.

(vi) | Special Advantage No. 11 related to measures to be taken to protect the
environment. Claimant had submitted a highly detailed environmental
impact assessment for the Brisas Concession to MinAmb in late 1994
and to MIBAM in early 1995, which was approved by MinAmb in
October 1999. The V-ESIA containing environmental protection
measures was submitted in July 2005, supplemented in January 2007
and then approved in February 2007 by MinAmb.

(vii) Special Advantage No. 12 contemplated constituting a company to
carry out the industrialization and marketing of minerals, with 20% of
the shares to be transferred to a State institution “when the Ministry so
requests”. The Ministry never requested the transfer of shares of any
company.

(viii) Special Advantage No. 13 related to the costs of two paid internships
each year for mining or geology students, to be paid by Claimant.
Claimant met and even exceeded this requirement.

(ix) | Special Advantage No. 14 required maintaining the performance bond
that had been posted. This was done on an annual basis through
November 2009, as shown by the annual reports to MIBAM.

308. The 12 May 2009 Memorandum, relied upon in the MIBAM Resolution dated May 2009
denying the extension of the Brisas Concession, related to Claimant’s alleged failure to obtain
certain environmental permits. Claimant states that it could not have obtained these permits due to
MinAmb’s improper treatment of Claimant, either by refusing to act on the application to extend

the exploration permit or by revoking the Construction Permit on 14 April 2008.

309. Claimant refers to a number of changes in policy that occurred at the time the Brisas Concession
was terminated. For example, President Chavez announced in his January 2009 “Address to the

Nation”, that the Administration planned to develop the Cristinas and Brisas concession areas

64

jointly with a new joint venture partner, Rusoro.''* On 23 August 2011, President Chavez signed
and approved a “Strategic Action Plan for the Orinoco Oil Belt and Mining Arch” establishing a

plan to develop the State’s mining resources, expressly including those found at Brisas. us

310. Claimant alleges that, as political priorities for the Chavez regime shifted, Respondent acted first
to frustrate and then to expropriate the Brisas Project. This change began when, having granted on
27 March 2007 the Construction Permit to Claimant, MinAmb refused to sign the Initiation Act.
The signature of this Initiation Act was required under Condition No. 9 to the Construction Permit

before any authorized activity could begin.

311. According to Claimant’s expert on Venezuelan law, Professor Brewer-Carias, the Initiation Act
was no more than a “procedural formality” to be signed following Claimant’s satisfaction of other
conditions imposed by the Construction Permit, so as to formally certify such satisfaction.''® As

such, contrary to the contentions of Respondent and its expert Professor de los Rios, !!7

the signing
of the Initiation Act was not discretionary for the Administration once the concessionaire had
complied with the conditions imposed by the Construction Permit. Claimant had satisfied said
conditions and had so notified MinAmb on 16 May 2007 requesting that the Initiation Act be
signed on 24 May 2007,'18 explaining to the Ministry that, in compliance with Condition No. 23,

molybdenum was not part of its exploitation plan for the Brisas Project.'!?

312. Claimant refutes Respondent’s explanation in this arbitration that MinAmb’s refusal to sign the

Initiation Act was motivated by its concern over the environmental impacts the Brisas Project

0

would cause,” saying that this is not supported by contemporaneous evidence as no such

concerns were communicated to Claimant at the time. On the contrary, after the issuance of the
Construction Permit, MinAmb requested in mid-July 2007 that the main access road be moved to
satisfy MIBAM’s requirements. Claimant had agreed to construct this alternative access road,

which was finally approved by MIBAM on 14 August 2007. Claimant states that, if Respondent’s
story were true, then it clearly acted in bad faith misleading Claimant into believing that the

Initiation Act would be signed and the Phase IIT AARN would be issued.

313. Following repeated requests that the Initiation Act be signed and Claimant’s compliance with
MinAmb’s request that a proposed alternative access road be provided, a meeting was held on 1
October 2007 with Minister Ortega and Vice-Minister Garcia. As recounted by Mr Rivero, the
president of Gold Reserve Venezuela, in his witness statement, following Claimant’s presentation
of the Brisas Project and answers to questions from Minister Ortega, the latter told Claimant that
even if Brisas Project were different, “there is nothing I can do because this issue is in the hands of
the President”, Vice-Minister Garcia adding that the future of the Brisas Project “is out of our
control.”!?! This was an alarming development for Claimant since it now appeared that the future

of the Project would be decided as a political matter by President Chavez.

314. Claimant states that it sent a letter to President Chavez on 19 November 2007 requesting a

meeting to discuss the future of the Brisas Project, 122

with no response from the President’s office.
Eventually, a meeting was held on 28 January 2008 with the Vice-Minister of Presidential
Relations, Fidel Gonzalez, who promised to look into the matter. However, nothing was heard
further from him. Claimant’s additional requests to MIBAM and MinAmb concerning the need to

sign the Initiation Act were ignored.

315. On 14 April 2008, the Revocation Order was issued by MinAmb declaring the “absolute nullity”
of the Construction Permit and revoking it “for reason of public order.”!?3 Claimant alleges that
the Revocation Order was a factually baseless, legally flawed and plainly pretextual action to

terminate the Brisas Project and deprive Claimant of its investment.

316. Contrary to what was stated in the Revocation Order, Claimant says there was no “uncontrolled
mining” by a “large number of miners” at the Brisas Project, as attested to by MIBAM’s inspection

one month before the Revocation Order was issued.'** Nor was Claimant going to engage

“irrational mining practices”, the operating and environmental plan having been thoroughly

317. The Revocation Order had no valid legal basis according to Claimant. The Emergency Decree
referred to by the Revocation Order did not prevent MIBAM and MinAmb from granting permits
to explore or exploit minerals, as shown by the fact that each Ministry had issued a variety of
mining permits during the life of this Decree. In any case, the Emergency Decree had expired nine
months prior to the issuance of the Revocation Order, on 26 June 2007. As opined by Professor
Brewer-Carias, no circumstances existed regarding the issuance of the Construction Permit
justifying a declaration of absolute nullity and further, the declaration of absolute nullity was
inconsistent with the “reason of public order” cited as an additional basis for the Revocation

Order. '?°

318. Respondent claims that under Articles 91 and 109 of the Organic Law on the Environment, the
Revocation Order was lawful because it was “founded” upon the Ministry’s authority to revoke
annual permits that are contrary to Venezuela’s environmental laws and its constitutional
obligation to protect the environment, promote a sustainable development and protect the rights of
indigenous people. '7° Claimant says this argument is misplaced. First, the Revocation Order does
not refer to the Organic Law on the Environment or to any violation of environmental laws and
new reasons cannot be added after the Revocation Order had been issued. Second, even if
Respondent had revoked the Construction Permit due to a real concern of grave and irremediable
environmental damage, it would still be required to compensate Claimant for damages, as opined

- fae 12
by Professor Brewer-Carias. '27

319. The Revocation Order was also unlawful because it was issued without allowing Claimant an
opportunity to be heard in advance. Claimant pursued legal avenues in Venezuela to challenge the
Order, but eventually waived those rights when initiating this arbitration. Contrary to Respondent’s
view,'”5 Claimant had no option to appeal against MinAmb’s failure to sign the Initiation Act

since no negative decision had been communicated to Claimant.

320. Claimant contends that the government’s motive for revoking the Brisas concession became
apparent on 23 May 2008 when Mr Rivero received a portion of a “MIBAM Power Point
presentation” from a friend who had contacts at MIBAM. The document records that one of the
“GOALS” of the government’s action was “to reduce the presence of transnational monopoly
capital in gold and diamond exploitation: American companies (Hecla), Canadian companies
(Cristalex and Gold Reserve)’. It also states that “IMMEDIATE ACTIONS” include the
“Suspension of the environmental permits granted to the companies Cristalex and Gold Reserve,

for the exploitation of the Las Cristinas mines.”'”

321. Subsequent thereto, Claimant continued to be presented with irrational propositions regarding
the Brisas Project, such as Vice-Minister Garcia’s unfeasible proposal that minerals be mined
underground rather than through open-pits. The open-pit operating plan and associated
environmental and social impact assessment had been previously approved by MIBAM and

MinAmb in the Brisas Project Feasibility Study and V-ESIA, respectively.

322. Starting in June 2008, statements made by MinAmb,!?° MIBAM"™! and President Chavez no
longer expressed environmental concerns, but rather the political objective to recover gold mines
to the State.'** This series of public announcements culminated with President Chavez “Annual
Message to the Nation” on 13 January 2009, which confirmed the government’s intention “to
exploit and control the gold fields Las Cristinas this year, one of the largest gold fields in the

Americas... estimated to hold approximately 35.2 million gold ounces...” !*

323. The reasons why the government had terminated the Brisas Project by revoking the Construction
Permit had therefore become clear to Claimant in the light of these public announcements and
statements. Claimant contends that subsequent government actions directed at the Brisas Project

were equally arbitrary and unlawful.

324. According to Article 25 of the 1999 Mining Law, which was applicable in this case, the
requested extension of the Brisas Concession was tacitly granted by application of the positive
administrative silence due to MIBAM’s failure to notify the concessionaire that it had been denied

the extension within the following 6 months.'*4

325. Once the concession extension was granted by a “tacit administrative act”, Respondent could not
revoke the grant of the extension since the individual rights created by such act could only be
revoked in circumstances of absolute nullity and in accordance with a proper administrative

sa: : . . . 3:
procedure providing Gold Reserve any due process in connection with such revocation. 185

Respondent’s Position

326. The Brisas Concession had been granted on 18 April 1988 to the Brisas Company for a term of
twenty years, with the option of requesting a ten-year renewal under the 1945 Mining Law.
Claimant’s Venezuelan subsidiary, Gold Reserve de Venezuela, acquired the rights to the Brisas
Concession in November 1992, when it acquired the Brisas Company. Pursuant to the Brisas
Mining Title, Claimant undertook a number of obligations (Special Advantages). Respondent

states Claimant utterly failed to comply with these obligations.

327. Thus, in breach of the Special Advantage No. 7, which required the concessionaire to begin
exploiting within three years of the publication of the Mining Title in the Gaceta Oficial,
Claimant’s exploration program lasted more than five years. During a five-year period through
1998, Claimant was granted yearly AARN’s to complete the exploration program. The latter was

completed in early 1999. '*°

328. According to Respondent, Claimant was in no hurry to start exploiting the Brisas Concession
since it took the company three years from the date of receipt of MinAmb’s observations to
finalize the necessary EIA, which was done in October 1998, ten years after the granting of the

concession.’ MinAmb only partially approved the EIA in October 1999, 138

329. From 1999, Claimant focused on the new so-called “Brisas Project”, invoking the lack of
environmental permits on other parcels adjacent to the Brisas Concession as preventing them from
going forward with the exploitation of the Brisas Concession. Respondent recalls that this situation
was worrisome for MIBAM whose Technical Evaluation Division issued a Memorandum to the
Director de Fiscalizacién y Control Minero on 1 July 2005 suggesting an inspection of the
concession area and mentioning that delays by MinAmb in issuing the necessary permits, as
alleged by Claimant as the reason for their delay, do not interrupt the time period for beginning

exploitation under the mining law.

330. On 29 July 2005, Claimant submitted the V-ESIA,'? requesting the issuance of an AARN “for
the infrastructure construction stage and exploitation of gold and copper for the Brisas Project.” !“°

The study was partially approved by MinAmb on 9 February 2007.'4!

331. On 27 March 2007, MinAmb granted Claimant an AARN authorising the construction of
infrastructure and services for Phase I of its proposed “Brisas Project” (known as Phase I
Permit).'? The permit stated that it did not authorize Claimant to affect natural resources for
exploration or exploitation of minerals. It also specified that Claimant would need an Acta de
Inicio to be signed before it commenced the permitted activities. In exercise of its discretion,
Respondent says the Acta de Inicio was never signed by MinAmb. On 14 April 2008, MinAmb
annulled the Phase I Permit due to serious concerns regarding its potential environmental

impact. M3

332. Contrary to what is stated by Claimant, '* Respondent contends the Phase I Permit was
extremely limited and significant work remained before MinAmb could determine whether to

authorize the Brisas Project development. Such authorization was in no way guaranteed since

 

‘8 MARN Official Letter No. 77-01-45-617/99 of 28 October 1999 (C-621) reserving the issuance of the relevant
AARN to the environmental evaluation of the other areas of the extended project.

MinAmb had identified a number of significant environmental concerns during its review of the
project. Additional environmental permits also depended upon the results of the EAE to be
conducted based on Claimant’s cooperation with the CVG and Crystallex to comply with the

Ministry’s requirements to minimize the cumulative impact of the neighbouring projects.

333. From the very beginning of the process, Respondent states that MinAmb had grave concerns
about the Brisas Project, mainly due to the fact that it was to be located in an ecologically and
culturally sensitive area. The concerns related in particular to water resources management
(including the Acid Rock Drainage and Metal Leading problem), biodiversity protection
(regarding in particular the massive land clearing to construct the mine and associated
infrastructure), the socio-economic impacts (regarding in particular the protection of indigenous

peoples’ rights), the Environmental Management Plan and the mine closure.

334. Regarding any and all such concerns, Respondent found Claimant’s V-ESIA of the Brisas
Project 2005 and other documents to be deficient due to the failure to analyze critical issues, as

noted by Respondent’s technical experts SRK.

335. Due to the tremendous size, scope and predicted adverse impacts of the Brisas Project,
Respondent observes that MinAmb’s approach was deliberately very cautious, as required under
Venezuelan law. In addition, MinAmb had grave concerns about the cumulative effects of the
project when considered in the context of other mining projects in the immediate proximity,
specifically another massive open-pit gold mine proposed by Crystallex’s Las Cristinas project,
immediately to the north of the Brisas Concession. This had led MinAmb to notify Claimant, on 31
July 2006, of the need to conduct EAE, the result of which would be used to determine whether to

grant the requested authorization. '*°

336. Claimant’s response at the time was to minimize the Ministry’s requirements asserting, on 27
October 2006, '*° that it had complied with them despite the fact that on such a date no joint studies

had been completed by the two companies.

337. In a meeting held on 22 December 2006, and in subsequent letters sent to both companies that
same month, MinAmb’s requirements were specified. '4” As of April 2008, Respondent submits

that Claimant had not complied with those requirements.

338. Respondent notes that prior to commencing even the initial construction and site preparation
activities authorized in the Phase I Permit, Claimant had to satisfy a number of permit conditions,
one of which was to obtain MinAmb’s signature of the Initiation Act. Contrary to Claimant’s
contention, Respondent states that the Initiation Act was not a “simple administrative formality”.
Like any other permit condition, the Initiation Act was a valid exercise of ministerial authority so
that MinAmb was not compelled to sign it. No less than twelve letters were sent by Claimant to
MinAmb and to President Chavez as a part of an intense lobbying campaign to obtain the signature
of the Initiation Act. As of April 2008, Respondent asserts that it was Claimant’s own delays that

were responsible for slowing the Brisas Project down.

339. Following the issuance of the Phase I Permit in March 2007, MinAmb continued to consider the
subsequent phases of the Brisas Project, growing increasingly concerned about the environmental
impacts that those phases would generate. As a result of these concerns, consistent with its legal
obligation to protect the environment, MinAmb annulled the permit on 14 April 2008.'48 In
addition to the fundamental environmental concerns, Respondent notes that Claimant had failed to
adequately address impacts to indigenous people and as of April 2008 had not completed an
environmental study that was satisfactory to MinAmb nor complied with the Ministry’s
requirements to study with Crystallex cumulative impacts, to develop joint infrastructure plans or

to contribute to the EAE.

340. Claimant alleges that certain press statements made by MinAmb subsequent to the revocation of
Phase I Permit suggest an improper motivation of such revocation. According to Respondent, these
statements have no weight since they do not represent the official position of the Ministry or the
Venezuelan Government. Gold Reserve’s president himself, Douglas Belanger, cautioned its

investors in that regard not to consider “rumors” reported in the press. 49

341.

According to Respondent, Phase I Permit was revoked pursuant to MinAmb’s statutory authority
to annul permits that are contrary to Venezuelan law and its constitutional obligations to protect
the environment, promote sustainable development and protect the rights of indigenous people.
Based on the significant environmental and socio-cultural risks that were at stake, MinAmb

determined that Claimant was not entitled to any further development authorization.

342. Respondent’s position is that sixteen years after the Brisas Concession was granted, Claimant

was yet to exploit the parcel as required by the Mining Title. MIBAM refused to extend the Brisas
Concession by the MIBAM Resolution dated 25 May 2009. '0 The decision was based on a series
of investigations and analysis reporting on Claimant’s non-compliance with its concessionary
obligations, in particular the obligation to exploit the Brisas Concession. Due to such non-
compliance, although Claimant had submitted a timely request for extension it could not benefit
from the silencio administrativo positivo under Article 25 of the 1999 Mining Law so that the
concession’s term could not be extended. Respondent observes that only concessionaires that are

“solvent” are entitled to request an extension according to MIBAM. ISI

343. Respondent maintains that MIBAM’s refusal to extend the Brisas Concession was in accordance

with Venezuelan law. Contrary to the allegations of Claimant’s expert, Professor Ortiz-Alvarez, a
concessionaire has no automatic right to the extension of its mining interest under the law,
Venezuela having broad discretion to administering mining concession, as explained by

Respondent’s expert, Professor Iribarren.'*

There was no need to provide Claimant with any
notice regarding the expiry of the Brisas Concession when it came to the end of its term on 18

April 2008.

344. Accordingly, on 4 July 2008 the Direccién de Fiscalizacion issued to Claimant tax payment

forms requesting payment of taxes through 18 April 2008. When the extension request was
discovered, it was noted that contrary to Claimant’s normal practice, no copies of such request had
been filed to MinAmb in its monthly, quarterly and annual reports. Following issuance of the tax
forms, Claimant filed a recurso de reconsideracién on 23 October 2008, requesting the office to

correct the tax payment forms to provide for tax payment through 30 June 2008 rather than 18

April 2008, considering that the concession had been extended by operation of silencio
administrativo positivo under Article 25 of the 1999 Mining Law. 'S3 Claimant was informed by the
Direcci6n de Fiscalizacién on 23 December 2008 that no new tax forms would be issued, and that

the decision regarding Claimant’s extension request was MIBAM’s responsibility. 1S4

345. A recurso jerdrquico was filed by Claimant on 9 February 2009 against the decision of the
Direccion de Fiscalizacién. The recurso was denied by MIBAM by resolution of 29 June 2009
arguing that the Direccién de Fiscalizacion had acted appropriately in the absence of any act
granting the extension of the concession.'*> Claimant was advised that it could file an appeal to
nullify the decision with the Sala Politico-Administrativa of the Tribunal Supremo de Justicia.

However, Claimant did not do so. 156

346. The MIBAM Resolution dated 25 May 2009 denied Claimant’s request to extend the term of the
Brisas Concession.'* Respondent notes that the decision was based on a series of investigations
and recommendations by various offices within the Ministry, as recorded by two memoranda of 29
April 2009 emphasizing that Claimant had failed to comply with numerous concessionary

memorandum of 12 May 2009 recommended that the requested extension be denied because,
although the request had been timely, the concessionaire was not “solvent” at the time of such

request. !*?

347. In MIBAM Resolution dated 25 May 2009 which terminated the Brisas Concession, MIBAM
explained that although Gold Reserve had submitted a timely request for an extension, silencio
administrativo positivo could not extend the Brisas Concession’s term because Claimant had not
been in compliance with its obligations under the Concession at the time of its extension. It stated
that only concessionaires that are “solvent” with Venezuela could request an extension of their

concession. Claimant was not solvente with Venezuela since it had failed to comply with many

obligations under the concession and the Mining Title, specifically Special Advantages Nos. 5, 6,

7, 8,9, 11, 12, 13 and 14.

348. Under the Special Advantage No. 6, Claimant was required to use the Brisas Concession for
exploitation in gold within the initial term of the concession. Respondent contests Claimant’s
expert’s view that the term “exploitation” under Venezuelan law means not only the physical
extraction of minerals but also performing all activities “necessary in order to extract minerals,
with the unequivocal intention of economically exploiting the concession and in proportion to the
nature of the substance and the magnitude of the deposit.”'° According to Respondent’s expert,
Professor Iribarren, there is clearly a difference between exploration and exploitation so that the
mine is not in exploitation when only exploratory activities have been done.'°! Respondent notes
that this interpretation was shared by Claimant which in 2003 requested that MIBAM count the
activities related to the extraction of minerals from the moment when the environmental

authorizations are granted. ' This request was denied by MIBAM.

349. Claimant argues that it cannot be blamed for not complying with its obligation to exploit the
Brisas Concession since MinAmb, although approving its environmental study, failed to grant the
necessary authorization to exploit the concession. Respondent asserts that this is disingenuous,
since Claimant planned to affect twelve other parcels in conjunction with its mining of the Brisas
Concession, as shown by the V-ESIA it submitted in July 2005. It was appropriate for MinAmb to
seek to understand Claimant’s plans for each of these concessions in order to evaluate the effects
of these activities on the environment. In any case, Claimant received numerous environmental

permits that it never fully utilized.

350. Respondent contends that, under the Special Advantage No. 7, Claimant was required to begin
exploitation within three years of the publication of the Brisas Mining Title in the Gaceta Oficial,
an obligation that was violated by Claimant. Respondent rejects Claimant’s argument that it did
not violate its obligation because three years had already passed when it obtained the Brisas

Concession. According to Respondent, Claimant knowingly took a risk in purchasing the

75

concession and cannot now say that MIBAM acted unlawfully for holding the concessionaire to its

obligations.

351. MIBAM found Claimant to be in violation also of the Special Advantage No. 8 requiring the
concessionaire to manufacture or refine extracted minerals in Venezuela. Respondent does not
accept Claimant’s allegation that its plan for future production, as laid out in its feasibility study,
evidenced its plans to manufacture or refine gold in Venezuela. As explained by Respondent’s
expert Professor Iribarren, this obligation had in any case to be fulfilled not later than at the end of

the legal term for the commencement of exploitation. tot

352. According to the MIBAM Resolution dated 25 May 2009, Claimant was also in breach of its
obligation under the Special Advantage No. 9 by not transferring technology to the mining sector
and to the country. The funding of conferences and meetings, as alleged by Claimant, is not

sufficient to meet the technology transfer obligation according to Respondent.

353. Under the Special Advantage No. 12, Claimant had the obligation to carry out extraction
activities and to market extracted minerals, as well as to transfer twenty percent of the companies’
shares to a State company. Respondent states that Claimant failed to comply with this obligation

by never establishing a company for the extraction or marketing of minerals.

354. Claimant also failed to pay exploitation taxes as required under the Special Advantage No. 5.
Claimant claims to have fulfilled this obligation by paying these taxes on the limited quantity of
gold extracted. As in the case of the Special Advantage No. 8, Claimant’s failure to comply with
one special advantage did not excuse it from complying with other special advantages linked to

exploitation.

355. In addition, Claimant was found in violation of the Special Advantage No. 11 requiring it to take
measures to protect the environment, the Special Advantage No. 13 requiring it to support
Venezuela interns and the Special Advantage No. 14 requiring that it maintains a performance
bond. Claimant has elaborated on how it fulfilled these obligations, but Respondent says it failed to

challenge the Resolution within the Venezuela administrative proceedings. In any case, according

‘4 Tribarren I, para. 143.

76

to Respondent, the failure to comply with any one of the special advantages could result in the

termination of a concession.

356. Respondent maintains that Claimant’s breaches cannot be cured by the “Certifications of
Compliance” it received from MIBAM’s technical officials. The individuals who issued them, the
Fiscal Inspectors of Las Claritas, being among the lowest ranked officials, lacked the authority to
grant such certifications under the 1999 Mining Law or the General Regulations of the Mining
Law. Article 88 of the Mining Law makes no mention of the duties and authority of fiscal
inspectors, stating simply that the National Executive through MIBAM shall oversee, monitor and
control the activities of any person regarding issues governed by the law and its regulations. As
mentioned by Respondent’s expert Professor Iribarren, these monitoring and supervisory
obligations are exercised through the Ministry’s distinct internal divisions, offices, such as
Inspectorias Tecnicas Regionales or Inspectorias Fiscales having only, respectively, technical or

tax-related competence. 165

357. Respondent asserts that Article 96.1 of the General Regulations of the Mining Law also fails to
support Claimant’s position, since it addresses neither fiscal inspectors nor the authority of any
entity to issue certificates of solvencia with Venezuela. Article 97 of the same General Regulations
of the Mining Law nowhere provides for the authority of fiscal inspectors to issue such certificates
as part of the detailed duties it describes for such inspectors. Without an express delegation of
authority a technical functionary could not pronounce a concessionaire’s solvencia with

Venezuela.

358. According to Respondent, the certificate of solvencia attached to Claimant’s request for
extension of 17 October 2007 reflects the limited capacity of the fiscal inspector signing it since it
declares Claimant “solvent with this office”, not with Venezuela. This was confirmed by the
person who signed it, Mr Carpio, explaining that requesting or receiving certificates of solvencia

“was not a common practice”!

359. Claimant alleges that its due process rights under Venezuelan law were violated. t67 Respondent

replies that, throughout the process that denied the extension request to renew the Brisas

Concession, MIBAM accorded Claimant due process of law. A recurso de reconsideracién was
opened to Claimant following MIBAM’s Resolution dated 25 May 2009, which terminated the

Brisas Concession. However, it chose not to exercise this right. 108

360. Respondent maintains that the Brisas Concession was recovered in a manner consistent with
Venezuelan law, specifically Article 102 of the 1999 Mining Law as well as the Special Advantage
No. 15 under the Brisas Mining Title. Recovering of assets was peacefully executed almost five
months after MIBAM’s Resolution dated 25 May 2009. An Acta de Recepcién was signed, a copy
of which was given to Claimant’s representatives. The recovery of assets was based on an
inventory and only assets belonging to Brisas were recovered. As confirmed by Mr Rivero,
president of Gold Reserve Venezuela, C.A., he was informed that the recovering of the Brisas
Concession assets was not intended to affect Claimant’s right to the Unicornio Concession

assets. '°°

The Tribunal’s Analysis

361. It is agreed by the Parties that the Brisas Concession was granted on 18 April 1988 for an initial
term of twenty years and that it was due to expire on 18 April 2008, but could be extended for two

additional ten-year terms if so requested at least six months before the expiration date.

362. Claimant’s request for extension was filed on 17 October 2007.'7° It was therefore timely. It
was accompanied by the most recent certificate issued by MIBAM stating that the company “has
fully complied with the provisions of the above [Mining] Law, its Regulations and the Mining

Titles and is, therefore, declared Solvent” as of 14 September 2007. Mm

363. MIBAM acknowledged the timely filing of the application for extension in the MIBAM

172

Resolution dated 25 May 2009 terminating the Brisas Concession. ''~ It disputed the validity and

effects of the certificates of compliance and, specifically, Claimant’s compliance with Special

ordered the “immediate suspension” of all mining activities of the Brisas Concession, the
preparation of inventories and the safekeeping of the concession assets, which were to revert to the

State.'7°

Request for Extension — Positive Administrative Silence

364. Prior to examining whether the relevant Special Advantages had been complied with, the
Tribunal will examine the legal effects of the timely filed request for extension, in light of the

absence of objection by MIBAM within six months thereafter.

365. As held by the Venezuelan Supreme Court of Justice in its decision of 2 November 2011,'7°

requests for extension of mining titles, including mining titles issued prior to the 1999 Mining Law
(like the Brisas Concession), are governed by Article 25 of the 1999 Mining Law and not by the

1945 Mining Law, as asserted by Respondent.'”” The Resolution terminating the Brisas

Concession makes explicit reference to Article 25 as applicable to Claimant’s extension request. 178

366. Article 25 of the 1999 Mining Law states the following:

“The concessions granted by the National Executive authorities in accordance
with this law shall only be for exploration and subsequent exploitation. Their
term shall not be longer than twenty (20) years from the date of publication of
the Exploitation Certificate in the Official Gazette. However, such term may
be extended for successive terms of no more than ten (10) years each, if
requested by the concession holder within three (3) years before expiration of
the initial term, and if approved by the Ministry of Energy and Mines,
However, the extensions may never exceed the original term granted in the
concession.

SINGLE PARAGRAPH. The concession holder may only request an

Copy of the Venezuelan Supreme Court decision of 2 November 2011 was filed by Claimant by letter of 1
February 2012, such filing having been accepted by the Tribunal (Transcript, February 2012, Day 1, 222:4-17).

request shall be submitted within the above three-year term. However, the
request shall be submitted six (6) months before expiration of the initial term,
at the latest, and the Ministry shall make a decision within six (6) months. If no
notice is given, this shall mean that the extension has been granted.” 179

367. Under Article 25 of the 1999 Mining Law, therefore, an extension request will be considered
granted where it is applied for in a timely manner by a “solvent” concessionaire and the authority
fails to notify the concessionaire that the request has been denied within six months prior to the
expiration of the original concession term based on the principle of positive administrative silence
(silencio administrativo positivo). Respondent recognizes that the 1999 Mining Law “confers a
positive effect to the Ministry’s administrative silence that was not present in either the 1945

Mining Law or in the relevant Regulations.” !*°

368. In the absence of any notice by MIBAM to the concessionaire within the six-month term that its
request had been denied for lack of “solvency” or for any other reason, the extension must be
deemed as granted by a “tacit administrative act” under Article 25 of the 1999 Mining Law, with
“the same nature and ... governed by the same rules” as any other administrative acts.”'*!

369. MIBAM did not give Claimant any notice in the six months after the extension request was filed.
The Administration was consequently provided with the requisite time to investigate Claimant’s
solvency and it is to be assumed that it did not discover during that time any reason not to extend
the Concession. Consequently, this Tribunal finds that the extension of the Brisas Concession was

granted according to the principle of positive administrative silence.

370. The Tribunal shall now consider whether it is possible for the extension so granted to later be

revoked by the Administration. In the opinion of Respondent’s expert, Professor Iribarren,

" The English translation of Article 25 was provided by Claimant (C-2). The Spanish text of the Article is as
follows:

“Las concesiones que otorgue el Ejecutivo Nacional conforme a esta Ley serén tinicamente de exploracion y
subsiguiente explotacién, su duracién no excederd de veinte (20) aiios, contados a partir de la fecha de publicacién
del Certificado de Explotacién en la Gaceta Oficial de la Reptiblica de Venezuela, pudiendo prorrogarse su
duracion por pertodos sucesivos no mayores de diez (10) aitos, si asi lo solicitase el concesionario dentro de los
tres (3) aitos anteriores al vencimiento del periodo inicial y el Ministerio de Energia y Minas lo considere
pertinente, sin que las prorrogas puedan exceder del periodo original otorgado.

 

Pardgrafo Unico: La solicitud de prérroga solo podra hacerla el concesionario solvente con la Reptiblica dentro
del periodo de tres aftos seftalados en este articulo, la cual, en todo caso, debera formularse antes de los seis (6)
meses anteriores al vencimiento del periodo inicial y el Ministerio deberd decidir dentro del mismo lapso de seis (6)
meses; en caso de no haber notificacién, se entenderd otorgada la prorroga”.

administrative acts, allegedly granted through positive administrative silence, are revocable
according to Venezuelan jurisprudence. '® In the present case, as opined by Professor Iribarren,
even assuming the operation of positive administrative silence, “the action derived from that
silence would have been validly revoked by the express response of the government denying the

renewal contained in MIBAM act of 25 May 2009.”!*?

371. Contrary to Professor Iribarren’s opinion, Professor Brewer-Carias opines that “[i]Jn Venezuelan
administrative law ... no administrative act creating or declaring rights in favour of its addressee
may be considered revocable. On the contrary, every administrative act that creates or declares
rights in favour of a beneficiary, regardless of whether the product of an express administrative act
or of a tacit administrative act is irrevocable.”

372. Regarding an administrative act, Professor Brewer-Carias indicates that it is possible for the
Administration to initiate “an administrative procedure to declare its absolute nullity” and reverse
the extension, “but in such a case it has to respect the concessionaire’s due process rights and
specifically the right to be heard and to defense”. In the absence of this due process, the
revocation would be null and void according to Article 19 of the Organic Law and Administrative
Procedure. '** Initiating this procedure might have been an option for the Administration in order
to review the tacit administrative act “to determine whether the granted extension was legitimate
or not and whether the legal requirements had been satisfied, granting the beneficiary (i.e. the
concessionaire) the right to participate to such administrative procedure.” 8°

373. The Tribunal agrees with Professor Brewer-Carias that any revocation of an extension
previously granted could only be undertaken if the concessionaire’s due process rights were
observed. It is evident that no such rights were observed in the present case. The manner in which
the Revocation Order was dictated has further effects on Venezuela’s international obligations as it

will be examined in Chapter VII.

374. The above analysis does not require the Tribunal to determine whether Claimant was “solvent”
when it applied for the extension. In the Tribunal’s view, the correct interpretation of Article 25 is
that the Administration is provided with a six month period in which to verify solvency and to
deny the extension should it deem the concessionaire to be insolvent. To hold otherwise would
deprive Article 25 of any useful effect and would be contrary to the principle of positive
administrative silence embodied in this provision. It would also mean that an extension granted by
positive administrative silence could be unwound many years later (with many dollars invested
during this period), if it were later discovered that a concessionaire was not solvent at the time of
making the request. This cannot be correct. Nonetheless, because it is relevant to the later
discussion on violations of the BIT, the Tribunal shall now review the concessionaire’s alleged

breaches of the 1999 Mining Law and the corresponding Mining Titles.

375. The value of the certificates of compliance as evidence of Claimant’s solvency is central to this
issue. The certificates of compliance issued by MIBAM during the life of the project, including
one month before the requested extension and confirmed one year later,'®” are evidence that the
authority had verified Claimant’s solvency. Since it has been disputed by Respondent, this point

shall be considered hereafter.

376. Pursuant to Article 88 of the 1999 Mining Law, MIBAM is the authority empowered to
“oversee, monitor and control the activities carried out by any natural person or legal entity...as
regards the issues governed by this law and its regulations”. As a consequence of the permanent
and continuous process of this supervision of mining activities, the concessionaires have the
obligation to file monthly and annual reports before MIBAM about their activities. For its part,
MIBAM must verify in a permanent way the compliance by the concessionaires of their duties and
obligations, as prescribed in the 1999 Mining Law and its Regulations as well as in the provisions

of existing mining titles and mining contracts.

377. In order to demonstrate the compliance with such obligations, the supervising and controlling
officials of MIBAM, upon request of the concessionaires, issue “compliance certificates” by which
the Administration certifies facts that are within its competence. As generally stated in the

certificates, after due verification and control including review of the administrative file and, at

'87 Specifically, in September 2008 (C-79).

times, inspection at the site, °° the Ministry certifies that the concessionaire has given due

° and the

compliance to the different clauses of the Mining Titles, the mining contracts, '*
provisions of the 1999 Mining Law and its Regulations and declares the same “solvent”. These
“compliance certificates” are issued by the mining officers empowered to that effect on behalf of

MIBAM.'”

378. Respondent’s contention that due to the “lower level” of public officers issuing certificates of

compliance the latter may not be given a particular weight'?!

is not acceptable. As correctly noted
by Claimant’s legal expert, the weight of the certificates depends on the power granted to the
certifying officers by the competent authority, not by their position within the Administration. '°?
Under the 2001 Mining Regulations, the power and duty to “ensure that the holders of mining
rights fulfil their obligations under the Mining Law, its regulations and all other applicable
provisions” is entrusted to the Inspectoria Técnica Regional.'> Under the Regulations, the
Inspectoria Técnica Regional shall establish an Inspectoria Fiscal to better perform its

functions. '**

379. As indicated by Claimant’s legal expert, the certificados de solvencia attesting that the
concessionaire has complied with its mining duties, “are administrative acts with their own legal
effects, issued by empowered public officers, as provided by article 96 of the General Regulation
of the Mining Law, enacted pursuant to the general power granted to the Ministry by article 88 of
the Law.”'°° The power of the Inspectorias Técnicas Regionales has been recognized and accepted
by “high” level authorities of MIBAM. The General Director confirmed that the “lower level”
Inspectors of Mines have the authority to certify Gold Reserve’s compliance with its obligations

under the Mining Titles and concessions. In its 12 May 2009 memorandum entitled “Decision on

'88 MEM (now MIBAM) Official Letters: No. EC-160-94 dated 29 June 1994 (C-67); No. EC-699-95 dated 20

under the Mining Titles, including the Special Advantages, was confirmed by MIBAM’s General Director in his
Memorandum dated 12 May 2009 (C-735, C-1321). Reply, para. 251.

the extension request of the Brisas del Cuyuni Concession term”, the General Director of Mining
Concessions explains that “whether or not the request should be granted depends on the
inspections and reviews to be conducted by the competent Ministry officers.”!°° The General
Director then states that the authors of the technical reports of 29 April 2009 are “the officers
empowered to inspect and verify concessionaires’ compliance with their obligations.”!” In other
words, the same office that had until then declared Claimant to be “solvent” determined few
months later its “insolvency” as the basis for the termination of the Brisas Concession. This
contradiction must be reconciled under Venezuelan administrative law since all such officers are
organs of a Ministry and therefore organs of Venezuela, regardless of their level in the public

administration organization.

380. It is therefore surprising that one of Respondent’s witnesses, Mr Angel Carpio, gave evidence
that when issuing mining compliance certificates he “certified” the compliance of the
concessionaire with his office, the Inspectoria las Claritas, not with Venezuela. !** As stated by
Claimant’s legal expert, “his office, being part of MIBAM, is an organ of Venezuela and the

concessionaire owes its duties to Venezuela, not to individual offices of MIBAM.”'”?

381. Since the power to issue the certificates of compliance is granted by MIBAM to officers of that
Administration entrusted to control the activities subjected to the 1999 Mining Law, the
certification relates to the compliance by Claimant with its obligations under the Mining Law and
the Mining Title. This is confirmed by the formulation of the last part of most of the certificates,
stating that the concessionaire “is solvent” or solvente por este concepto or “solvent with the

Ministry of Basic Industries and Mining”?

382. Regarding certificates of compliance, Claimant’s legal expert, Professor Brewer-Carias, opines

that:

Office of the Vice-Minister of Mines-MIBAM (C-1113). As already mentioned (supra para. 378), the Fiscal
Inspectorate is an office of the Inspectoria Técnica Regional which assists the latter in performing the functions of
supervising the concessionaire’s compliance with its obligations.

“in these constant relations between the concessionaires and the
Administration, after verifying the compliance of obligations, the
supervising authorities issue “compliance certificate” that as
aforementioned, are administrative acts of certification. Nonetheless, if
after all the day-to-day supervision and control of mining activities,
after the filing of subsequent (monthly and annual) reports as to the
compliance of obligations, and after issuing successive “compliance
certificates”, all confirming, both implicitly and explicitly, compliance
with the terms of a concession and the applicable legislation, the
Administration realizes, contrary to earlier determinations, that in a
particular situation listed in Article 98 of the Law, the concessionaire
has not fulfilled its obligations and that there is non-compliance, in
order to contradict the previous administrative actions, the
Administration must be extremely cautious in order to terminate the
concession.””"!

 

 

383. Commenting on the opinion of Respondent’s legal expert, Professor Iribarren, Professor Brewer-
Carias adds that “such certificates of compliance, as a written acknowledgment of the verifications
undertaken by the Inspectores regionales in exercise of their duty to verify and control the
concessionaires mining activities are not issued to “invalidate” or supersede any power of any

other offices in the Ministry of Mines,”?”?

adding that “nor are they to determine in a final,
indisputable and irrevocable manner whether or not a concessionaire has met its essential
obligations to exploit, and whether it has done so within the specific time frames.”°> However, he
further adds “nor can these certifications, once issued, be ignored in any subsequent evaluation of
the compliance of the concession in relation to the time periods covered by these certifications.”?™
The other legal expert for Claimant, Professor Ortiz-Alvarez, expresses the opinion that “[t]he
Administration cannot disregard the previous declarations of solvency without further arguments
and new compelling evidence showing a serious or grave situation of breach by the concessionaire
and addressing the legitimate expectations created by MIBAM’s earlier certifications to the

contrary. 205

384. Respondent’s legal expert, Professor Iribarren, opines the following regarding the value of the
certificates of compliance (certificados de solvencia):
“The experts Brewer-Carias and Ortiz-Alvarez, as proof of good

standing, emphasize the issuance of what they call multiple certificates

of good standing issued by officials of the Tax Inspectorate. In this
regard, basing myself on the circumstances in which the certificates
were issued and their content, I reiterate my opinion that these
documents refer to verifications carried out by local officials in relation
to compliance with specific activities whose execution had been
provided for by the concession holder’s own plans, pertaining to the
sphere of competence of those officials, and that they cannot take away
from the authority of the Ministry of Mines to verify if, throughout the
duration of the concession, the concession holder was or was not in
good standing in regards to the Republic.”?”

385. The Tribunal notes that the Parties’ legal experts appear to agree that under Venezuelan law the
certificates of compliance do not deprive MIBAM of the authority to verify and control the
concessionaire’s mining activities and that they do not determine in a final and irrevocable manner
the concessionaire’s compliance with essential obligations. However, they cannot be ignored when
evaluating the timely compliance of said obligations. The Tribunal accepts this position, and
further notes that, with regard to extension requests, the six month period provided to the
Administration is for the purpose of finally determining such compliance. As such, the value of
the certificates of compliance is in creating a prima facie assumption of solvency. If the
Administration wishes to terminate a concession or deny an extension on the grounds of
insolvency, it must provide clear reasons for doing so within the six month period, and must

comply with all due process rights.

Alleged Breaches of Special Advantages

386. Pursuant to the above, MIBAM retained the authority to determine whether Claimant was in
compliance with its essential obligations to Venezuela (solvente con la Reptblica). The Tribunal
shall accordingly now examine Claimant’s breaches that have been alleged by Respondent as a
ground for denying the requested extension and to declare the Brisas Concession terminated on the
expiry of the initial term of 20 years, i.e. on 18 April 2008. MIBAM’s Resolution dated 25 May
2009 indicates that the following Special Advantages had been breached by Claimant, making the
latter insolvent before Venezuela: Nos. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13 and 14.207 They shall be examined

in turn.

387. Special Advantage No. 5. It provides for the payment by the concessionaire, as exploitation tax,
the three percent (3%) of the market value in Caracas of the gold refined. Claimant relies on Mr
Rivero’s statement explaining that, as confirmed by the tax payment forms submitted to MIBAM,
taxes were paid on the limited amount of gold extracted by the prior owner and as by-product of
Claimant’s exploration and development activities.?" Respondent has not disputed Claimant’s
statement in that regard. It may be noted that this ground of alleged non-compliance, even if
proven, would be disproportionate regarding the sanction of denial of the extension of the term of
the Brisas Concession. However, the Tribunal is satisfied that the exploitation tax was regularly

paid and that therefore there is no breach of Special Advantage No. 5.

388. Special Advantages No. 6 and No. 7 refer to the exploitation phase generally; Special Advantage
No. 8 refers to manufacturing or refining mineral; Special Advantage No. 9 refers to the transfer of
mining technology to the mining industry, promotion of connected sectors, personnel training
related to the extracting phase of the concession; Special Advantage No. 11 refers to the protection
of natural resources as a consequence only of the process of extracting mineral; Special
Advantages No. 12 refers to the constitution of a new company for the purpose of mineral
extraction, industrialization and commercialization of extracted minerals contemplated as possible
during the extraction of minerals; Special Advantages No. 13 refers to the incorporation of two
intern students during the exploitation phase; and Special Advantage No. 14 refers to the bond
regarding the above-mentioned Special Advantages. Since all these Special Advantages relate to
the exploitation phase of the Brisas Concession, it is necessary to determine whether the Brisas
Concession was in the exploration or in the exploitation phase at the time the extension of its term

was requested.

389. In the post-hearing phase, the Parties have debated whether the Phase I Permit, which was the
last permit issued to Claimant before the termination of the Brisas Concession, related to
exploitation or to exploration. Respondent has characterized the Phase I Permit as relating to “the

+209

construction of infrastructure and services for the exploration phase of the Brisas Project’ while

87

Claimant has contended that, consistent with its request for an “exploitation” AARN,”"” the permit

was for exploitation.”!!

390. The language used by Claimant in its various requests for an AARN is different from the
operative language of the Phase I Permit. Claimant had requested (Petitorio) an “Administrative
Authorization for the Affectation of Natural Resources for the Phase of Construction of
Infrastructure and Services and for the Phase of Gold and Copper mineral exploitation of the
Brisas Project” (Autorizacién Administativa para la Afectacién de Recursos Naturales para la

Etapa de Construccion de Infrastructuras y Servicios y para la Etapa de Explotacion del mineral

212

de Oro y Cobre del Proyecto Brisas),”~ while the Phase I Permit refers to an “Authorization to

Affect Natural Resources....for the Infrastructure and Services Construction Phase of the Brisas
Project for Exploitation and Processing of Gold and Copper Mineral” (Autorizacion...para llevar a
cabo la Etapa de Construccién de Infraestructura y Servicios del Proyecto Brisas para la
Explotacién y Procesamiento de Mineral de Oro y Cobre),’'> where the word Explotacion is not
mentioned as the object of the Etapa (as in Claimant’s request) but rather as the object of the

Proyecto Brisas."* The same language of the Phase I Permit is used by MinAmb’s decision

revoking the Permit.?'5

391. The different language used by MinAmb when granting the Phase I Permit was likely due to the
agreement reached with Claimant at the meeting of 13 February 2007. As recorded by the minutes
of that meeting, Claimant had accepted the suggestion that the Project be divided into two phases:

217 Witness Statement of Mr Romero dated 27 January 2011 (hereinafter “Romero I’), when dealing with the Phase
I Permit, refers to the decision to divide the exploitation phase of the project into two phases, as had been agreed at
the meeting at MinAmb on 13 February 2007 which he attended. The decision was made because, “the project did
not comply with all the Ministry’s requirements to authorize the mining exploitation activities” (para. 6). He adds

88

had been accepted by Claimant to accommodate MinAmb’s environmental concerns in view of the

issuance of the AARN it had repeatedly requested.

392. However, the decision to divide construction and exploitation into two phases is not
determinative of whether Claimant had commenced the exploitation phase under the 1999 Mining
Law. Nor is the language used in the Phase I Permit determinative of this issue. For this purpose,
the relevant reference point is the definition of “exploitation” provided in the 1999 Mining Law
itself. It is to this definition that the Tribunal now turns for evaluating the fulfilment by the

concessionaire of its obligations under such Law and the Brisas Mining Title.

393. Article 58 of the 1999 Mining Law states:

“Tt is understood that a concession is considered in exploitation when
its substances are being extracted from the mines, or when the
necessary efforts are made for the unequivocal purpose of obtaining
some economic profit from such substances based on their nature and
the dimension of the deposit.”

394. Prof Brewer-Carias explains the effect of Article 58 as follows:

“Exploitation, therefore, is being undertaken not only when the
concessionaire is actually digging out minerals from the selected
parcels, but also according to Article 58 of the 1999 Mines Law — as it
was under the 1945 Mines Law regime (Article 24) — when the
concessionaire is doing what is necessary in order to extract minerals,
with the unequivocal intention of economically exploiting the
concession and in proportion to the nature of the substance and the
magnitude of the deposit. Consequently, a concession can be
considered as being in exploitation without minerals actually being
extracted...”7!

395. Respondent translates the definition of “exploitation” in the 1945 Mining Law (which it says
also reflects the 1999 Mining Law) as “the concession is in exploitation when the substances to
which the present Law refers are being extracted from it, or when doing what is necessary to
achieve its extraction through the construction works that according to the case are appropriate to

this end, and provided that it is worked by at least five labourers per day 27220

 

that the Permit granted to Gold Reserve on 27 March 2007 “only authorized the company to carry out preliminary
activities to prepare for the mining [explotacién, in the Spanish original] itself” (para. 7).

396. The Tribunal notes that in Respondent’s view, even if according to both the 1945 and 1999
Mining Laws the concept of “exploitation” is extended to preparatory activities, such activities

' In order to

should be understood as “material” activities unequivocally aimed at extraction.”
support the “materiality” aspect of the activity, Respondent offers a translation of Article 24 of the
1945 Mining Law (as set out in the previous paragraph) where the reference to “works” that are
necessary to achieve exploitation is qualified by adding the word “construction” before “works” in
order to “more accurately emphasize” the intent of the law.” The Tribunal is not persuaded that
“materiality”, whatever its precise meaning, should be added to qualify the concept of
“exploitation”, considering also that the parallel text of Article 58 of the 1999 Mining Law, as

provided by Respondent at the hearing,”

which applies to this case, contains an even more open
language when defining “exploitation”. However, it appears that all experts accept that
exploitation does not require actual extraction of minerals and that construction of infrastructure
required for extraction minerals would be considered part of the exploitation phase. As such,
given that the Phase I Permit was clearly for preliminary construction, the Tribunal finds that the

Brisas Project was in the exploitation phase from March 2007.

397. The fact that Claimant had completed its exploration phase by March 2007 (i.e., before it filed a
request for the extension of the Brisas Concession) is confirmed by Respondent itself and by
documents in the file. According to Respondent, “[t]he Company finally completed its exploration
program for the Brisas Concession in early 1999."°4 After that, further exploration permits were
issued which appear to relate to the Unicornio Concession. In December 2005, a final one-year

°> This is consistent with the

exploration phase of the Brisas Project (i.e., both the Brisas and Unicornio Concessions) coming to

an end by the beginning of 2007.

398. Accordingly, as stated above, the Tribunal finds that Claimant had completed its exploration
phase and that the Phase I Permit (concerning construction works such as building access road,

clearing sites for infrastructure, installing wells to pump water into sediment points and the like),

falls within the definition of “exploitation” according to Article 58 of the 1999 Mining Law, as
being “activities necessary in order to extract minerals, with the unequivocal intention of

19226

economically exploiting the concession. In this sense, no distinction is necessary between

Phase I and Phase II construction — both form part of the exploitation of the Concessions.

399. Having concluded that Claimant had already commenced exploitation when it requested the
extension of the Brisas Concession, it is to be examined whether Claimant was in compliance with
Special Advantages Nos. 6, 7 and 11 as relating to obligations to be fulfilled in view of
commencing the phase of exploitation activities. Special Advantages Nos. 8, 9, 12, 13 and 14 shall
not be considered as they all relate to the extraction of minerals subsequent to the construction

2
works.”””

400. It may be worth recalling in this context that, in a letter to MIBAM, Claimant had alleged that
the lack of requested environmental AARNs from MinAmb for the alluvial gold exploitation
activities in the Brisas Concession constituted force majeure and that this circumstance justified
the request to MIBAM that the time limits within which mineral extraction activities must begin
under the 1999 Mining Law should run from the date of the granting of the AARN for
exploitation.” Failing any reply, Claimant wrote again to MIBAM on 3 September 2003.” In its
reply of 14 October 2003, MIBAM denied the request by stating the following:

“Please note that after analyzing the requests made in this regard by
your principal, the Office of the General Director of Mines has
determined that the Authorizations to Affect Natural Resources are
subject to the condition that the company must first obtain the
Authorizations for Territorial Occupation of the additional areas
proposed by your principal for the expansion of the Brisas del Cuyuni
Project in accordance with the recommendations issued by the State
Director’s Office, Bolivar Region, by means of Official Letter No. 77-
01-45-045/99 dated January 28, 1999 on the request that the tailing and
slag ponds from the exploitation be located outside the Brisas del

 

6 This is consistent with Brewer-Carfas’ approach that: “Article 58 of the Mining Law plainly contemplates that
once the exploration phase has ended, the subsequent activities required to later start extracting minerals, all of
which are necessary for doing so, are considered as exploitation of the concession, comprising, e.g., the preparation
and drafting of the exploitation project, the completion of the feasibility studies, the construction of the
infrastructure and access to the field, and the buildings needed for the management of the exploitation process and
services, as well as the activities devoted to request all the environmental authorizations required for the extraction
of substance process”: Brewer-Carias II, para. 145.

7 All these Special Advantages are held by MIBAM Resolution dated 25 May 2009 (C-91, 5" whereas) to have
been breached by Claimant: supra para. 386.

Cuyuni concession area. Therefore, and as the initiation of the
exploitation activities in the Brisas del Cuyuni and Unicornio
concessions depend [sic] on the granting of environmental permits by a
different authority, I urge you to continue taking all necessary measures
to obtain the Authorizations for Territorial Occupation for the areas
where the tailing and slag ponds will be placed in order to begin insofar
as possible, the exploitation activities in the abovementioned
concession within the terms prescribed in the Mining Law and its
Regulations.”?”

401. Turning now to Special Advantages Nos. 6 and 7, the Tribunal recalls that Special Advantage
No. 6 of the Mining Title states:

“Use the twenty (20) year period for exploitation of the concession,
beginning on the date of publication of the respective Title in the
Official Gazette of the Republic of Venezuela, with the option of
extending the term of the Title at the concessionaire’s request
submitted within a period of three (3) months prior to the expiration of
the original period and if the Ministry believes it is appropriate, without
exceeding a maximum of forty (40) years in accordance with the
guidelines of Article 188 of the Mining Law for this type of
concession.”

402. Special Advantage No. 7 of the Mining Title states:

“Begin exploitation within a period of three (3) years following the
date of publication of the respective Title in the Official Gazette of the
Republic of Venezuela. For purposes of compliance with this special
advantage, the commencement of exploitation is understood as all of
the activities performed for the purposes of developing the mining
project pursuant to the development chronogram approved by the
Ministry in accordance with the terms set forth in the First Special
Advantage.”

403. Claimant was therefore required under Venezuelan law to commence exploitation within three
years of the publication of the Brisas Mining Title and that; consequently, the purpose of the 20
year term of the Concession was for “exploitation”. While Claimant has explained that it
diligently engaged in a wide range of preparatory activities necessary to develop the Brisas
Concession for the purpose of commercial production, the fact remains that it did not commence
exploitation until 2007 — 19 years after the Concession had commenced. Although this delay may

1

be partly explained by delays in receiving permits from the Administration,”*' it is nonetheless

clear that Claimant was not compliant with Special Advantages Nos. 6 & 7. Moreover,

°° MEM Official letter No. DGM-395 dated 14 October 2003 (C-426).

3! Supra para. 400.

92

administrative delays alone cannot excuse Claimant for the totality of the period to be used for

exploitation nor has Claimant offered convincing evidence to that effect.

404. The substantial nature of the delay in commencing exploitation also means that the fact Claimant
took over the Concession after the initial three year period is irrelevant. The delay accumulated

after Claimant took over the Concession was considerable.

405. Special Advantage No. 11 of the Mining Title states:

“Take the necessary measures to protect the forests, rivers, soil fauna,
and atmosphere and, in general, take appropriate environmental
protection measures. In this regard, the concessionaire agrees to
perform the studies necessary to obtain the permits required by the
corresponding government agencies on a national level. In this regard,
the concessionaire will prepare and submit a comprehensive
environmental and ecological protection study to the Ministry of the
Environment and Natural Resources (MARNR) as well as the Ministry
of Energy and Mines (MEM) prior to proceeding with the exploitation
activities, including the conservation and protection measures required
as well as reforestation plan for the impacted areas.”

406. According to Respondent, in breach of Special Advantage No. 11, Claimant had failed to take
the measures necessary to guarantee environmental protection by not providing MinAmb and
MIBAM, before starting its exploitation activities, with the required environmental and ecological
protection study, together with a reforestation plan for affected areas. According to the witness
statements of Messrs. Belanger and Rivero and the documents cited therein, Claimant had prepared
a highly detailed environmental impact assessment for the alluvial concession which was
submitted to MinAmb in late 1994 and to MIBAM in early 1995 and a subsequent study in
October 1998, with copy to MIBAM, which was approved by MinAmb on 28 October 1999.2

6,233

Claimant also submitted its reforestation plan to MinAmb in May 199 with copy to

MIBAM.?*4 Finally, in connection with the Brisas Project encompassing both the alluvial and hard

rock concessions, Claimant had prepared and submitted the V-ESIA to MinAmb on 29 July

Phase I Permit, Claimant also submitted evaluations of arboretum forest species at the Brisas
Concession in March 1997, December 1999 and December 2000.7? MinAmb’s approval of the V-
ESIA had regard to compliance of all requirements to execute some identified service works in
view of Claimant’s request for the AARN which, according to MinAmb, was for the
“Infrastructure and Services Construction Stage and for the Exploration Stage of Gold and Copper
Mineral of the Brisas Project”.“° Other service works (power line, processing plant, perimeter of
the tailing dam, sedimentation ponds, conveyor belt and crushing plant) had to wait for the results

of the Strategic Environmental Evaluation “for their full definition”.”"!

407. The Tribunal is of the view that these reports and studies satisfy the requirements of Special
Advantage No. 11 and that therefore Claimant was “solvent” in that regard when it requested the
extension of the Brisas Concession. The Tribunal notes that the requirements in question were
preliminary to the exploitation phase, as confirmed by the language of the Special Advantage No.

11 and of MinAmb’s approval of the V-ESIA.

408. In conclusion, although exploitation had been commenced by the time the Phase I Permit was
issued in 2007, under Venezuelan law Claimant was in breach of Special Advantages Nos. 6 and 7
by failing to commence exploitation within the required time limits. Breach of these Special
Advantages were among the stated grounds for the MIBAM Resolution dated 25 May 2009
terminating the Brisas Concession, thereby providing a legal basis under Article 98 of the 1999
Mining Law and Special Advantage No. 15 for the termination of the Brisas Concession.
According to Special Advantage No. 15, the “breach of any of the obligations described above
[i.e., any Special Advantage] will be grounds for extinction of the rights related to the

concession.””” The Tribunal notes that Claimant’s breach had been cured by the time the

also under Venezuelan law of the continued validity of the Brisas Concession Mining Title.

409. The Tribunal further notes that the legal basis that existed under Venezuelan law for the
termination as a result of breach of Special Advantages does not mean that the termination was
itself valid. Although the legal experts agree that it may be possible to nullify the “tacit

245 this

administrative act” by which the Brisas Concession had been extended by operation of law,
possibility does not mean that the purported nullification was valid. Such a termination or
nullification would only have been valid under Venezuelan law if the Administration had followed
the correct administrative procedure to ensure that Claimant’s due process rights were respected.
No such administrative procedure was initiated nor was Claimant’s due process rights respected,
Respondent having chosen to revoke the extension and terminate the Brisas Concession by
Resolution of 25 May 2009. The Tribunal shall revert to Respondent’s conduct in this regard when

examining the alleged BIT violations.

C. The Unicornio Concession

Claimant’s Position

410. The Unicornio Concession was granted to the Brisas Company on 3 March 1998. It was still in
force in April 2008, but was subsequently terminated by MIBAM Resolution dated 17 June
2010.™°

411. On 4 November 2009, MIBAM commenced an administrative proceeding to revoke the
Unicornio Concession for alleged non-compliance with the Mining Law and various special
advantages under the Unicornio Mining Title.” The administrative proceeding relied on three

internal memoranda prepared by different offices of the Ministry, dated respectively 29 and 30

 

or rather applied “indeterminate legal concepts”, as discussed between the Parties’ legal experts (Brewer-Carias II,
paras. 17-24 and 110-115; Iribarren II, paras. 24-26).

April 2009 and 15 May 2009.48 Claimant filed a challenge to each of the grounds for termination
alleged in MIBAM’s resolution, claiming inter alia the violation of its rights to defense and due
process since the said internal memoranda had not been notified to it and it was unaware of their
content."
412. On 17 June 2010, MIBAM issued its resolution terminating the Unicornio Concession.?”
Claimant asserts that, contrary to the administrative proceeding which claimed that Claimant had
failed to comply with Article 61 of the 1999 Mining Law and with seven special advantages, this
resolution terminating the Unicornio Concession only relied on Article 61 of the 1999 Mining Law
and Special Advantage No. 10 under the Unicornio Mining Title. Respondent has not discussed or
undertaken to defend the lawfulness of those grounds, simply noting that Claimant “decided to
discontinue its challenge and waive its right to legal proceedings in Venezuela in order to pursue

its claims under the present arbitration.”?*!

413. Claimant submits that MIBAM’s termination of the Unicornio Concession was equally unlawful.
It was premised on Claimant’s alleged failure to commence exploitation within seven years from
the grant of the concession and to support two interns as required by the Unicornio Mining Title.??

The evidence shows that Claimant did not fail to exploit the Unicornio Concession,”>* and that it

supported interns in compliance with the Unicornio Mining Title and received compliance

certificates. As both Professor Brewer-Carias and Professor Ortiz-Alvarez explain, termination

based on such a ground and without prior notification violated principles of due process and

proportionality of administrative action."

414. Regarding the alleged non-compliance with Article 61 of the 1999 Mining Law providing that
“the parcels subject to mining rights must be put in exploitation within maximum period of seven

(7) years counted from the date of publication of the respective Certificate in the Official Gazette,”

96

Claimant notes the following. The Unicornio Mining Title, like many of the mining titles issued
before the 1999 Mining Law, did not require that a separate exploitation certificate be issued and
specifically addressed the consequences of not commencing exploitation within the period set forth
in the law by prescribing to the concessionaire, under the second special advantage, to pay double
the otherwise applicable surface tax “until exploitation starts.”?55 According to Claimant, MIBAM
never imposed such double taxes, so that, the concession may not be terminated for failure to

commence exploitation.

415. Claimant contends that MIBAM consistently issued written letters of certification confirming
Claimant’s compliance with the 1999 Mining Law (necessarily including Article 61), the
applicable regulations and the requirements of the Unicornio Mining Title.?*° Claimant thus had a
legitimate right to and did rely on these letters of certification. According to Claimant, as a matter
of Venezuelan law, after years of such official determinations of compliance, the Ministry could
not simply ignore these certifications, deem Claimant to be non-compliant with Article 61 and
terminate the Unicornio Concession based on a contrary interpretation of the law, as confirmed by

its legal expert, Professor Brewer-Carias.”*”

416. Claimant further contends that, even assuming that non-compliance with Article 61 in theory
could provide a basis for terminating the Unicornio Concession, the MIBAM’s termination of the
Unicornio Concession for that reason was manifestly inconsistent with the law because Claimant
did commence exploitation within the meaning of the law. Under Article 58 of the 1999 Mining
Law (as under the previously applicable 1945 Mining Law), “exploitation” does not mean only the
actual physical extraction of minerals, but also undertaking the necessary preparatory activities in
view of such extraction “with the unequivocal purpose of obtaining some economic profit from
such substances”. According to Claimant, it diligently took steps to develop the Unicornio
Concession towards its exploitation, as it was required to do in order to prepare and submit the
Brisas Project Feasibility Study in February 2001, approved by MIBAM in January 2003, and the
V-ESIA in July 2005, approved by MinAmb in February 2007. Furthermore, still according to

Claimant, MinAmb’s wrongful refusal to sign the Initiation Act prevented Claimant from

commencing construction and, necessarily, from reaching commercial production.

417. Claimant contends that the government took over the Brisas Project site and assets unlawfully, in
disregard of the still valid Unicornio Concession. Even if the denial of the extension of the Brisas
Concession were lawful, the seizure of the Project site and assets was not since both land and

assets were subject to the still valid Unicornio Concession.

Respondent’s Position

418. Pursuant to the Unicornio Concession, Claimant obtained in 1998 the exclusive right to exploit
copper, molybdenum and gold for a period of twenty years, subject to its compliance with
pertinent legal norms and to the fulfilment of commitments under seventeen special advantages,
including, but not limited to, a requirement to begin exploiting minerals within the period of seven

years specified by the 1999 Mining Law.

419. As required under the Special Advantage No. 5 and within the extended time limit, in February
2001 Claimant submitted the Brisas Project Feasibility Study. As explained by the study, the plan
to develop the Unicornio and Brisas Concessions in the new brand “Brisas Project” depended on
Claimant being able to acquire rights to various parcels of lands in the region, including NLEAV1-
NLSAVI, Barbara, Zuleima, NLNAI-NLNV1, Aluplata, Velaplata, El Pauji and Morauana.?**
The study being incomplete, it had to be supplemented by additional information, which was
provided on 27 November 2002. The Brisas Project Feasibility Study was approved on 6 January
2003.7

420. According to Respondent, it was only in 2005, more than seven years after it had obtained the
concession, that Claimant submitted the environmental and socio-cultural impact study as required

in order to obtain the AARN for exploitation." Respondent observes that, by this time, the seven

258 Brisas Project Feasibility Study of February 2001 (C-170, p. 18-ii).

25° MEM (now MIBAM) Official Letter No. DGM-003 dated 6 January 2003 (C-253). According to Respondent,
MIBAM “did not, however, approve a “Brisas Project” feasibility study” but only a study related to the Unicornio
Concession (Counter-Memorial, para. 150: see also para. 159). Claimant asserts on the contrary that the Feasibility
Study expressly states that “the Brisas Project [was] the subject of this study” (Claimant’s Post—Hearing Brief, para.
42).

260 V_ESIA of the Brisas Project 2005 (C-178).

years granted to begin exploitation on Unicornio had expired. As evidenced by Gold Reserve’s
own annual reports on the Unicornio Concession from 1998 to 2008, Claimant managed only to
conduct exploratory work, optimize its mine design and monitor wells and water courses on the

concession.*!

421. Respondent notes that the administrative proceeding to terminate the Unicornio Concession
commenced on 4 November 2009, based on Claimant’s failure to comply with Article 61 of the
1999 Mining Law and with a number of Special Advantages (3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 14, and 15), Tt notes
further that Article 61 required a concessionaire to begin exploitation within seven years following

the publication of the mining title in the Gaceta Oficial.

422. In the course of the administrative proceeding to terminate the Unicornio Concession, Claimant
filed its challenge to each of the grounds for termination, denying that it had violated any of its
commitments by reason of the delay by MinAmb in granting the requested environmental permits
and authorizations.” On 4 March 2010, Claimant discontinued the challenge in order to pursue its
claim in this arbitration. Accordingly, on 23 June 2010, MIBAM formally notified Claimant of the
Ministry’s decision to terminate the Unicornio Concession due to the failure to comply with
Article 61 of the 1999 Mining Law requirement to begin exploitation within seven years and the

Special Advantage No. 10 requiring it to support practical training for Venezuelan interns.

423. Respondent argues that the Unicornio Concession was justifiably terminated in conformity with
the relevant practice and procedure under Venezuelan law. Following an analysis of Claimant’s
mining activities and compliance with its legal obligations by the competent office, the Director
General of Fiscalizacién y Control Minero commenced on 4 November 2009 an administrative

proceeding in view of terminating the concession.”°>

424. Respondent contends that MinAmb was reasonable and responsive throughout the permitting
process, as recognized by Gold Reserve’s president Douglas Belanger in its remarks to
shareholders in April 2007.766 However, from 1992 to 1999, Claimant did not even seek permits
for the Brisas Project. Only in October 1998, did it submit an EIA to MinAmb which was partially
approved only one year later, in October 1999.77 Following Claimant’s acquisition of the
Unicornio Concession in 1998 and the remodelling of Claimant’s mining plans into the so-called
Brisas Project, the environmental permitting process had to begin again from scratch, the 1999

approval of the EIA being no longer of value for the project.

425. During the period 1999-2004, the environmental permitting was subject to the Supreme Court’s
injunction prohibiting MIBAM from issuing new mining titles and permits within the Imataca
Forest Reserve. While the parcels making up the Brisas Project were ultimately designated for
mining use, Respondent notes that MinAmb was limited in its ability to grant environmental
permits until the process of revising the Reserve’s Management Plan was complete. This had been
recognized by Claimant in a February 2004 letter to MIBAM.”® Claimant’s complaint that it
lacked Authorisation to Occupy Territory (‘AOT”) permits for Barbara, Zuleima and Lucia
parcels that were part of the Brisas Project is false, according to Respondent, because it was
granted the remaining AOT permits in May 2004.°° However, according to Respondent, Claimant
never sought and never obtained rights to certain critical parcels of land that were necessary to

develop the proposed Brisas Project.

426. When Claimant finally submitted its V-ESIA for the Brisas Project on 29 July 2005, Respondent
maintains that MinAmb was efficient and responsive by allowing certain preliminary activities to
proceed while reserving its judgment regarding allowing actual mineral exploitation. Following

the Phase I Permit allowing initial construction and site development but explicitly prohibiting

report to shareholders.”

427. Regarding the other components of the so-called “Brisas Project”, Respondent observes that
Claimant ought to have received, but did not, authorization to develop its separate mining interests
as an integrated project. Claimant knew that it had no right to develop the multiple parcels to be
used for exploitation or infrastructure as a unified project since under Venezuelan law each
concession and mining right or contract was to be administered on individual basis. In any case,
Claimant did not comply with its obligations regarding each of the mining interests that it

unilaterally integrated into the so-called “Brisas Project”.

The Tribunal’s Analysis

428. Two grounds were relied upon by MIBAM to justify termination of the Unicornio Concession
on 17 June 2010: (i) alleged failure to commence exploitation in violation of Article 61 of the 1999
Mining Law; and (ii) alleged breach of Special Advantage No. 10 regarding the hiring of

interns.”

429. In order to revoke the Unicornio Concession, MIBAM had commenced on 4 November 2009 an
administrative proceeding for alleged non-compliance with the 1999 Mining Law and numerous

special advantages established by Unicornio Mining Title, specifically Nos. 3-4, 7-8, 10, 14 and
15275

430. On 18 November 2009, Claimant filed an initial response to the Ministry’s allegations””° but

431. The Tribunal shall examine only the two grounds for termination relied upon by the MIBAM
Resolution dated 17 June 2010. All other grounds mentioned in the Opening Act of 4 November
2009 are no longer included in said resolution and do not therefore constitute grounds for

termination of the Unicornio Concession.

Article 61

432. Article 61 of the 1999 Mining Law provides as follows:

“Exploitation in the parcels subject to mining rights shall begin within
seven (7) years from the date of publication of the exploitation
certificate in the Official Gazette. Exploitation of the concession may
not be suspended without a justified reason, and such suspension may
never last more than one (1) year, except due to acts of God or Force
Majeure. The Ministry of Energy and Mines shall be notified of such
circumstances, and it shall make any necessary decision in this regard.
During such suspension, however, the holder of mining rights shall
continue performing the activities and work that are necessary to
maintain such mining rights.”

433. The Unicornio Concession was issued in March 1998, and therefore exploitation should have
commenced by March 2005 in accordance with Article 61 above. As noted for the Brisas
Concession above, the Tribunal has found that exploitation on the Brisas Project (including the
Unicornio Concession) did not in fact commence until early 2007. This is evidenced by the fact

that Claimant’s exploration AARN was extended for a further year in December 2005.

434. Claimant’s reliance on the wider meaning of “exploitation” under Article 58 of the 1999 Mining
Law has already been taken into account when reaching this conclusion, and does not therefore
alter it. According to Claimant, it had commenced exploitation of the Unicornio Concession well
before March 2005, specifying the steps it had taken towards exploitation.” Claimant has denied
that it could be held liable for having failed to commence exploitation within the prescribed time
limit because it was precluded from extracting copper, molybdenum and vein gold by the lack of

the environmental permits and authorizations requested to that purpose.”””

?”8 Memorial, para. 252. The “steps towards exploitation” mentioned by Claimant are indicated supra para. 416.

Memorial, para. 254.

102

435. As noted above, the Tribunal does not consider that the various steps referred to by Claimant as
taken towards exploitation would fall within the expanded notion of “exploitation” under the 1999
Mining Law. The only evidence offered by Claimant to demonstrate that this ground for the
termination of the Unicornio Concession was “baseless factually and legally” is the expert report

of Professor Brewer-Carfas and the testimony of Mr Rivero.”*°

436. In addition, the Tribunal is not persuaded by Claimant’s argument that, because no double
taxation had been imposed by Special Advantage No. 2, it was not in breach of Article 61.7"! The
Tribunal notes that under the Special Advantage No. 2, the doubling of the surface tax in case of
failure to commence exploitation within the period of time contemplated in Article 24 of the 1945
Mining Law is conditioned upon the concessionaire having timely requested the renewal of the
title in accordance with Article 55.2 of the 1945 Mining Law. There is no evidence in the record of
this proceeding that such renewal had been requested by Claimant. Significantly, this argument is

not mentioned in Claimant’s Response of 18 November 2009 to MIBAM’s Opening Act.

437. As to the number and continuity of certificates of compliance issued by MIBAM regarding the
Unicornio Concession, the value to be attributed to such certifications, has already been indicated

by the Tribunal."

438. The Tribunal further notes that, the lack of permits and authorizations which are duly requested
may result in a force majeure suspending the time limit set by Article 61 of the 1999 Mining Law.
Respondent asserts that Claimant cannot blame MinAmb for having failed to grant the required
permits “when it had not requested a single environmental permit for Unicornio by the time the
deadline for exploiting the concession lapsed” and that no environmental impact assessment had
been presented regarding the Unicornio Concession.” The Tribunal notes in this regard that

MIBAM had to intercede with MinAmb in March 2004 to unblock the permitting process.*** As to

80 Memorial, paras. 251-252. No clear inference may be drawn in this regard from MIBAM’s Analysis of February-
March 2005 for Unicornio’s Concession (C-1331), stating (under FOUR): “Exploitation period IN PROGRESS”,
such statement following repeated references to the fact that “no exploitation activities are being performed at
present at the concession” (under THREE and SIX).

the environmental impact assessment, the V-ESIA, which included the Unicornio Concession,”*°
was submitted on 29 July 2005 for the Brisas Project. When the study was presented, however, the
7-year time limit under Article 61 had already expired. MinAmb’s delay in granting the requested
authorizations may not excuse Claimant’s failure to respect the said time-limit considering, on the

6

one hand, the legal issues affecting the Imataca Forest Reserve,”*° which were recognized by

Claimant, and, on the other hand, that the V-ESIA had to be complemented and supplemented by

Claimant in order to be approved by MinAmb, which approval intervened on 9 February 2007.78"

Special Advantage No. 10

439. Special Advantage No. 10 provides as follows:

“From the commencement of exploitation, the concessionaire will
cover the internship expenses, once a year during two (2) months, for 2
(two) Mining Engineering and/or Geology and/or Geophysics students
from the National Universities or Colleges.”

440. Regarding the alleged failure by Claimant to comply with Special Advantage No. 10 of the
Unicornio Mining Title, the following may be noted. This Special Advantage provides that “from
the commencement of exploitation, the concessionaire will cover the internship expenses, once a
year during two (2) months for two (2) Mining Engineering and/or Geology and/or Geophysics
students to the National Universities or Colleges.” This Special Advantage is substantially similar

to Special Advantage No. 13 in the Brisas Mining Title.

441. Claimant contends that following the acquisition of the Brisas Concession and throughout the
course of project development, it regularly hosted and supported student interns, including thesis
candidates, at the project site, sponsoring 55 student internships from 1993 to 2008 and also
providing other benefits, such as room and board and payment of travel and other related
expenses.”** Claimant understands that the student intern requirement, as set out in the respective
Brisas and Unicornio Mining Titles, was that it would begin sponsoring interns when the project
commenced production. Such production did not occur on Unicornio, so the obligation had not

commenced, whereas it was due to be fulfilled in regard to the Brisas Concession.**? Claimant

reported to MIBAM in its annual reports for each year from 1998 through 2006 that this Special
Advantage would be fulfilled “in due course” and relied on the compliance certificates issued

during such period as a confirmation that it was taking the necessary steps to be in compliance.””

442. Claimant asserts that over the course of the Brisas Project it sponsored 55 interns, 23 more than
the 32 required for the Brisas Concession, which was enough to cover the 22 Unicornio interns
required during the 1998 to 2008 time period. Therefore, even if there was no specific designation
of interns for the Unicornio Concession, the overall contributions was sufficient to satisfy this
obligation under both the Brisas and the Unicornio Concessions. In any case, according to
Claimant even if its compliance with Special Advantage No. 10 remained at issue, using the
alleged non-compliance as a ground for terminating the Unicornio Concession violated principles

of proportionality of administrative action.””!

443. The Tribunal notes Respondent’s contradictory position whereby it founds the MIBAM
Resolution dated 17 June 2010, on the one hand, on Claimant’s alleged failure to commence
exploitation within the legally prescribed time limit, and, on the other hand, on the alleged non-
fulfilment of an obligation which was due only “from the commencement of exploitation”.
Respondent did not challenge Claimant’s indication of the number of sponsored interns during the

relevant period of time.”

444. Claimant’s position regarding the fact that the obligation under Special Advantage No. 10 would
have been due not “upon commencement of exploitation”, but only upon actual production from
the mine seems reasonable considering that only following actual production would Claimant have
started earning profits. The Tribunal notes that Respondent has provided no comments on this

interpretation.

445. The Tribunal finds that the breach of Special Advantage No. 10 is not a valid ground for
terminating the Unicornio Concession since the relevant obligation would have been enforceable
upon commencement of production and production had not yet occurred when the concession was
terminated. In any event, termination by reason of such breach would have been out of proportion

considering the gravity of such sanction.

446. For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal concludes that Respondent could under Article 98 of
the 1999 Mining Law and Special Advantage No. 173 rely upon Claimant’s failure to comply
with the time limit set out in Article 61 of the 1999 Mining Law in order to terminate the
Unicornio Concession. However, as stated in paragraph 409 above for the Brisas Concession,
Respondent was still required to follow the correct procedure when terminating the Unicornio
Concession on this ground, in order for the termination to be valid. Respondent’s conduct
regarding such termination shall be examined when dealing with the alleged BIT violations. The
Tribunal notes that the termination did not occur until June 2010 and that, as at April 2008, all

parties agree that the Concession was still in place.

D. Barbara, Zuleima, Lucia, NUEAV1-NLSAV1

Claimant’s Position

447. Claimant planned to site the mineral processing plant and the tailings dam on the Barbara parcel,
the waste rock and organic soil stockpiles on the Zuleima parcel and proposed to site a fauna and
ecological reserve on the Lucia parcel. The authority to exercise mining rights over Barbara,

Zuleima and Lucia parcels had been delegated in 1990 to the State mining enterprise, CVG. In

295

1992, CVG had concluded mining contracts with the private company Placer Dome~™ that, with

CVG’s approval, assigned those contracts to Claimant, with effect in July 1999 and until the

remainder of their contract terms, i.e. until April 2013.2

293,

Special Advantage No. 17 under the Unicornio Mining Title dated 12 February 1998, provides that “the failure to
comply with any of the foregoing shall be grounds for termination of the rights in said concession” (C-4, under d).

24 Presidential Decree No. 1409 dated 29 December 1990 (R-15, Articles 2 and 5).

°° Contract for the Exploration, Development, and Exploitation of Alluvial and Hard-Rock Gold and Diamond

and Exploitation of Alluvial and Hard-Rock Gold and Diamond Minerals in the Zuleima Parcel between
Corporaci6n Venezolana de Guayana and Placer Dome de Venezuela, C.A., dated 26 April 1993 (hereinafter
“Zuleima Mining Contract”), (C-10); Contract for the Exploration, Development, and Exploitation of Alluvial and
Hard-Rock Gold and Diamond Minerals in the Lucia Parcel between Corporacién Venezolana de Guayana and
Placer Dome de Venezuela, C.A., dated 26 April 1993 (hereinafter “Lucia Mining Contract”), (C-12).

2° Assignment and Delegation Contract for Exploration and Exploitation of Alluvial and Hard-Rock Gold and
Diamonds between Placer Dome de Venezuela, C.A. and Compaiifa Aurifera Brisas del Cuyuni, C.A., dated 16
October 1998 (hereinafter “Barbara, Zuleima and Lucia Assignment Contract”), (C-8); CVG’s Resolution No.
8240 dated 22 July 1999 (C-6, p.1-2).

106

448. By letter dated 27 July 1998, Claimant informed MIBAM about the purpose of the assignment of
CVG-Placer Dome contracts for Barbara and Zuleima since, in addition to possible mineral
findings that could add reserves to the Brisas Project, those parcels “rule out areas without
mineralization that could be used to locate infrastructure of the same project such as tailings basin
and waste dumps.”””” MIBAM had taken note of the assignments, without objection, on 3

September 1998. 298

449. Claimant had concluded a contract with CVG on 3 February 1994 regarding NLEAV1 and
NLSAV1.2” The original term of the contract ran until 26 January 2016, extendable for two
successive periods of ten years. Claimant notes that it planned to explore these parcels and, upon
ruling out mineralization, to use NLEAV1 to accommodate part of the saprolite heap and NLSAV1

to site a section of the conveyor belt running from the pit to the processing plant.*°°

450. Claimant contends that the Administration was fully informed as to Claimant’s activities
regarding the NLEAVI-NLSAVI1 parcels, approved their use and confirmed Claimant’s
compliance with its contractual obligations, as reflected in many of the same documents regarding

Barbara, Zuleima and Lucia parcels.

451. In the Brisas Project Feasibility Study, which was filed in 2001, Claimant described its plan to

use the Barbara parcel for the “dam and containment structures for 280 million tons of tailings’*"!
and the Zuleima parcel as a waste rock disposal site.” The proposed use was confirmed in the
study update dated 27 November 2002.33 Description of the planned use of NUEAV1-NLSAV1 is

also contained in the Brisas Project Feasibility Study.*4

452. The Brisas Project Feasibility Study was approved by MIBAM on 6 January 2003, without
objection to the proposed use of any of the parcels for infrastructure for the Brisas Project.*°5
Subsequently, Claimant proposed to develop a “fauna reserve” and “ecological station” on the

Lucia parcel. *°° By the issuance of Phase I Permit on 27 March 2007, MinAmb authorised works

to support (i) the conveyor belt area on the NUEAV1-NLSAV1 parce! and (ii) the tailing pond

area, processing plant and man-camp areas on the Barbara parcel. *°* The Zuleima parcel was not

considered since it was not needed until after Phase I dewatering*” and the Lucia parcel was not

453. Claimant observes that it kept the Ministry regularly advised on its exploration activities

regarding each of these parcels, demonstrating, by reference to condemnation drilling conducted in

the areas, that there was no economic mineralization on the Barbara parce! the Zuleima

parcel,*!? and the NLEAV1-NLSAV1 parcel*3 and that siting of infrastructure on those areas was

appropriate. MIBAM confirmed Claimant’s compliance with its obligation by providing

certificates of compliance for each of those parcels.*!4

without any objection regarding the proposed use of these parcels.*!* The intended use of Barbara,
Zuleima and all other parcels had already been analysed by MinAmb’s Memorandum dated 15

November 2005, with no legal impediments having been found.*!”

455. Claimant applied to convert the NLEAVI-NLSAVI, Barbara and Zuleima contracts into
concessions on 14 December 1999. The application was not acted upon by MIBAM, although
Claimant states that the conversion was provided as a matter of right by Article 132 of the 1999
Mining Law. However, it notes that such conversion was not necessary for infrastructure use of

those parcels.*”°

Respondent’s Position

456. According to Respondent, the rights Claimant had acquired for each such parcel did not allow it
to use the parcels for the use intended by Claimant. In particular, Claimant was not authorized to
site a mineral processing plant and a tailings dam on Barbara, waste rock and soil stockpiles on
Zuleima, a fauna and ecological reserve on Lucia and a saprolitic heap and conveyor belt on

NLEAVI-NLSAV1.

457. The purpose of Claimant’s mining contracts for Barbara, Zuleima, Lucia and NLEAVI-

NLSAV1 is the exploration, development and exploitation of alluvial and vein gold and diamond

3a Respondent asserts that Claimant unilaterally decided to use these parcels to

minerals.
accommodate infrastructures and oil dumps without any permission to do so. According to
Respondent, none of the indicia alleged by Claimant of Venezuela’s “full agreement” evinces

permission for this unlawful use of the parcels for infrastructure.

109

458. The approval of the Brisas Project Feasibility Study was not, as contended by Claimant, an
approval of the use of the parcels for infrastructure of the Brisas Project. First, it was not an
approval of a feasibility study for the Brisas Project but only for Unicornio Concession, each
parcel requiring a separate feasibility study, as shown by Claimant’s Annual Reports for Zuleima,
Lucia, NLEAVI-NLSAV1.°” In any case, as opined by Professor Iribarren, Venezuela’s legal
expert, by approving a feasibility study the government only expresses the view that the execution

of the future project is technically, financially and environmentally possible.*7>

459. Secondly, Respondent argues that the mining contracts of each parcel provided for their use for
exploration and exploitation of minerals, not for infrastructure. The Fifth Clause of each contract
provides for a procedure to be undertaken by Claimant should it be determined that “there was no
economic mineralization on the properties,” in which case the contract may be considered as
terminated. Claimant’s contemporaneous documents show that it had not determined that the
parcels lacked valuable minerals and that, accordingly, MIBAM had not been so informed, so that

they could not be used for other purposes.

460. The fact that Claimant wrote to MinAmb asking it to process environmental permits for adjacent
parcels or that MIBAM was aware of Claimant’s intention to use adjacent parcels for infrastructure
cannot be taken as approval that Claimant would breach its obligations to use the parcels for

mineral exploration and exploitation.

461. Respondent asserts that none of the provisions of the 1999 Mining Law cited by Claimant
supports the unilateral conversion of its contractual obligations. Article 11 does not do so, as it
provides that the concessionaire may be granted an easement permitting the use of other property
to carry out mining activities, but Claimant did not seek easements to build infrastructure on these
parcels. Article 13 also does not do so, as it provides that the concessionaire may use empty lots,
but none of these parcels was shown to be “empty lots”. Finally, Article 46 does not do so as,
under this provision, concessions that are terminated are free areas which the Administration may

grant to a new party.

462. In addition, Respondent alleges that Claimant failed to comply with many of its obligations
under the Barbara, Zuleima, Lucia, NUEAV1-NLSAVI1 contracts with CVG. First, it did not fulfil
its obligation to use the four parcels for exploitation, as required by the First Clause of the
contracts. It apparently acquired the parcels from Placer Dome believing that there was no prospect
of economic mineralization on them.*™* Second, it did not comply with its obligation to conduct an
exploratory program within two years, as required by the Second Clause. Third, it did not submit
the geographical maps required for Barbara, Zuleima and Lucia under the Third Clause of the
relevant contract. Fourth, it did not submit feasibility studies for each of the four parcels, as

required by the Fourth and Sixth Clauses of the contracts.

463. Claimant denies that it breached its contractual obligations for each such parcels since the
“Ministry never indicated to Gold Reserve that it considered its activities in regard to these parcels
to be inconsistent with its contractual obligation” and it received “certification of compliance on
each of these parcels.” Respondent counters that these are absurd arguments. Letters by low-
level technical functionaries purporting to certify compliance with all legal obligations cannot cure

Claimant’s breaches.

464. Respondent notes that MinAmb never received a feasibility study for Barbara, Zuleima, Lucia
and NLEAV1-NLSAVI. It issued one AOT, two AARNs for exploration for Barbara,*”° one AOT
and four AARNs for Zuleima*’ and two AOTs and four AARNs for exploration for NLEAV1-
NLSAV1.*** It did not issue any authorization for Lucia parcel. Phase I Permit did not authorize

any activity on Zuleima or Lucia.”

465. Claimant requested that the mining contracts with CVG for Barbara, Zuleima Lucia and
NLEAVI1-NLSAVI be converted to a concession in 1999 in accordance with Article 132 of the
1999 Mining Law. Such conversion, which was never granted, was essential for the viability of the

planned “Brisas Project”.

The Tribunal’s Analysis

466. Having examined the Parties’ positions regarding Barbara, Zuleima and NLEAV1-NLSAV1
parcels**° and the evidence filed in that regard, the Tribunal is satisfied that both MIBAM and
MinAmb were aware of Claimant’s intent to use these parcels for infrastructure and services.
Neither Ministry ever expressed any reservations regarding such use when examining (and, where
required, approving) studies, reports and other documentation filed by Claimant indicating the
intended use of each parcel,**! MIBAM’s letter dated 24 March 2004 inviting MinAmb to expedite
the granting of permits to Claimant records that Ministry’s understanding that the areas of Barbara,
Zuleima and Lucia contracts “are expected to be used as dumps for the materials resulting from the
exploitation of the Brisas del Cuyuni and Unicornio Concessions pertaining to the referred project”

(i.e., the Brisas Project).**

467. The last permit issued by MinAmb, the Phase I Permit dated 27 March 2007, authorized works
as planned on Barbara and NLEAV1-NLSAV1 parcels.**3 Phase I Permit describes in the
introduction these parcels as part of the wider Brisas Project, thus confirming that the Ministry was

aware and had approved the use of these parcels for infrastructure and services.

468. Claimant kept MIBAM regularly informed of the activities conducted on each parcel during the
relevant period through monthly and annual reports. One section of each report described the
“geological-exploration activities” that had been carried on, including the number of condemnation

drillings and whether economic mineralization had been found.*** Based on these reports, the

55° | ucfa parcel shall not be examined since it was no longer required by Claimant.

5! This was the case of the Feasibility Study filed with MIBAM and approved by the latter on 6 January 2003 and
the V-ESIA filed with MinAmb and approved by the latter on 9 February 2007.

Ministry issued regularly certificates of compliance for each such parcel.**5 The last certificate,
dated 2 September 2008, attests as did the previous ones, that Claimant “has fully complied with
the provisions of the above [Mining] Law, its Regulations and Mining Titles and is therefore
“solvent.”**° In addition, from 1998 to 2003, CVG issued certificates regarding Claimant’s

compliance with its contractual obligations.**”

MIBAM’s analysis of Claimant’s first quarterly
reports for these parcels in 2005 found Claimant to be in compliance with its obligations and that

non-compliance with other obligations was due to the failure to issue environmental permits.***

469. Based on the above review and analysis, the Tribunal is satisfied that Claimant had valid title to
the mining contracts concluded with Placer Dome for Barbara and Zuleima parcels and with CVG
regarding NLEAVI-NLSAV1 parcel and that such parcels could have been used to site
infrastructure and services for the exploitation of the Brisas Project. The fact that Claimant’s
contractual rights to these parcels of land were not converted into concessionary rights does not
per se prevent their use under the mining contracts for the planned purpose. There is no need to
examine the status of the Lucia parcel since, as mentioned by Claimant, the same was no longer

needed for the Brisas Project.>”

E. Esperanza and Yusmari

Claimant’s Position

470. Mining contracts for Esperanza and Yusmari had been executed by CVG and Minera Las
Cristinas C.A. (MINCA), a joint venture between CVG (30%) and Placer Dome (70%), on 5
January 1993 for a period of 20 years. The planned use of the parcels was for exploration and

exploitation of alluvial and hard-rock gold and diamond.

471. Claimant and MINCA executed easement agreements and additional agreements on 7 May

sedimentation pool and the Yusmari parcel for an organic soil heap.

472. By letter of 1 December 2005, Claimant informed MIBAM about the easement agreements
concluded with MINCA regarding “infrastructure and services works it deems convenient or
necessary in the Regions of the Areas, including, without limitation, dumps or sterile material

deposits.”*"!

473. Claimant also noted that reference to the use of the Esperanza and Yusmari parcels was made by

Claimant’ s May 2006 Update to the Brisas Project Feasibility Study (“May 2006 Update”).*”

474. The V-ESIA included a reference to the Esperanza and Yusmari parcels and the V-ESIA

475. The Phase I Permit authorized works as planned on the Esperanza and Yusmari parcels.*4°

Respondent’s Position

476. In relation to the Esperanza and Yusmari parcels, Respondent states that Claimant never
obtained valid rights to put such parcels to use as infrastructure. The easements obtained from
MINCA, a company that had the right to explore and exploit the parcels through a contract with

CVG, were invalid since MINCA had no right to transfer its contractual rights to another entity

the right to site slag heaps on the parcels. *“°

477. MIBAM never received a feasibility study for Esperanza and Yusmari. MinAmb issued two

AARNs for exploration for each of these parcels, 47

The Tribunal’s Analysis

478. Under the terms of an agreement with MINCA of 7 May 2004, MINCA, as holder of certain
mining contracts with CVG over the area of the two parcels, authorized Claimant to conduct
additional exploration studies and to perform the infrastructure and services works deemed
convenient or necessary in the area. The agreement states that it does not create “an assignment or
delegation of the rights and/or obligations that belong to MINCA under the aforementioned
Mining Contracts.”*“* The content of the agreement was reported to MIBAM on 2 December

2005.”

479. On the same date of 7 May 2004, the parties entered into two additional agreements, one for
each such parcels, providing that in the event that there existed sufficient gold or diamond reserves
in Esperanza/Yusmari to justify proceeding to exploitation, the parties would enter into a new
agreement regulating such exploitations. If there did not exist sufficient mineral reserves to
proceed to exploitation, MINCA would allow Claimant to obtain the exclusive right to use

Esperanza/Yusmari for infrastructure purposes.**°
480. Contrary to Respondent’s contention, there was no assignment by MINCA to Claimant of the
mining rights it held with CVG. MIBAM was informed of the content of the agreements with

MINCA. Neither this Ministry nor MinAmb raised any objections to the use by Claimant of these

parcels to support infrastructure, as shown by the approval, respectively, of the Brisas Project
Feasibility Study and of the V-ESIA. Both studies indicated the proposed use of the two parcels for

infrastructure and services for the Brisas Project.

481. The Phase I Permit further authorized works as planned on the Esperanza and Yusmari parcels in
March 2007, as indicated in the text of the Permit enclosed as Appendix B to Claimant’s Second

Post-hearing Submission.

482. Having examined the Parties’ positions regarding Esperanza and Yusmari parcels and the
evidence filed in that regard, the Tribunal is satisfied that Claimant had valid contracts for the use

of these two parcels.

F. NLNAI-NLNVI (the North Parcel)

Claimant’s Position

483. According to Claimant, as a result of a surveying error the North Parcel was not included in the

Brisas Concession. Although the error was recognised by MIBAM,*!

it was never officially
corrected. As a result, in November 2003, Claimant submitted an alfarjeta concession application

to acquire rights to use the North Parcel.*°? The application was not acted upon by MIBAM.

484. Claimant avers that it had a legitimate expectation that the right to use the North Parcel would be

granted, particularly considering that it could be economically exploited only jointly with the

3

Brisas and Unicornio Concessions.** Significantly, the Brisas Project Feasibility Study

contemplated the incorporation of the North Parcel.*** The study was approved by MIBAM on 6

January 2003.*°5

Respondent’s Position

487. Claimant applied for a concession on NLNAI-—NLNV1 in 1993, but its application was never
granted. Respondent argues that without this concession, Claimant could not construct the mine pit
it had designed in order to develop the Brisas and Unicornio Concessions. Claimant’s attempt to
rely on legitimate expectation that “the MIBAM could confirm its right to use the North Parcel”*?

is, in Respondent’s view, without merit since under the 1999 Mining Law an express resolution

granting the concession was required. Accordingly, the project was impossible.

The Tribunal’s Analysis

488. Claimant never acquired the alfarjeta concession it had requested for this parcel. There is no
evidence in the file that Claimant acquired a right of use of NUNAI-NLAV1 for infrastructure or

services for the Brisas Project under any other legal or contractual ground.

489. The fact that Claimant expected to be able to use this parcel, even if accepted in the light of the
circumstances of the case,*°° would not create a right when the same, although duly requested, had
not been granted. The fact that the Brisas Project Feasibility Study contemplated use of the North
Parcel does not remedy this defect, as the study clearly states that no title to the parcel land yet
been acquired.**! MIBAM’s approval of the Brisas Project Feasibility Study was therefore

contingent upon the concession being granted, which did not occur.

490. The V-ESIA referred to the North Parcel as a component of the Brisas Project, mentioning that

the grant of an alfarjeta concession on the parcel was pending (en curso). The MinAmb’s approval

56! Tn the part of the Brisas Project Feasibility Study dealing with NLNAI-NLAV1 it is stated: ‘There is currently
an application before the MEM to obtain the respective mineral rights to the concession” (C-170, para. 1.3.6).

117

of the V-ESIA cannot therefore be interpreted recognizing Claimant’s right to use the land, as
Claimant knew that the concession had not yet been granted by the competent authority. For the
same reason, the reference made to NUNAI-NLNV1 in the Phase I Permit* does not imply any

recognition of an entitlement to use the parcel in the absence of a legal or contractual right.

491. The absence of rights regarding the North Parcel would have prevented the implementation of
the layback agreement with the company Las Cristinas that had mining rights on the adjoining
Cristina IV parcel. The layback agreement would have in fact required the holding of mining rights
on the North Parcel in order for Claimant to be able to extend its pit into the neighbouring parcel of
the other concessionaire. In any case, even if the two parties had reached agreement on the

substantive aspects of the layback, as asserted by Claimant, the agreement was never signed.*

492. For the above reasons, the Tribunal considers that Claimant had no rights to NUNAI-NLNV1
(North Parcel) and that this parcel should be excluded as a component of the Brisas Project for all

relevant purposes.

G. El Pauji

Claimant’s Position

493. A concession for the exploration and exploitation of alluvial gold and diamonds had been
granted to ARAPCO on 24 February 1983,°% with exploitation certificate published on 20 July
1988 (“El Pauji Concession”).*® In the absence of action by MIBAM on a request to transfer the
concession to Claimant, an easement agreement was concluded by ARAPCO with Claimant on 27
January 2006, for a term equal to that of the concession, * to develop an access road and build
various infrastructures. A copy of the easement agreement was provided by ARAPCO to MIBAM
on 22 May 2006.*”

494. The concession term was for 20 years, i.e. until 20 July 2008, extendable for two successive ten-
year periods. *** According to Claimant, the concession was extended for additional ten years by
operation of law under Article 25 of the 1999 Mining Law and the principle of positive
administrative silence pursuant to a timely request for extension filed on 17 January 2008 and the
lack of any reply by MIBAM during the following six months.*” The easement agreement with

ARAPCO was extended accordingly, as contended by Claimant.

495. As testified by Mr Rivero, one of Claimant’s witnesses, on 19 January 2009 MIBAM, in
disregard of the extension of the Concession, issued tax forms calculating the period of tax until
the expiry of the Concession initial term, to then order, on 18 March 2009, the immediate
suspension of any activities on El Pauji and the reversion of its assets to Respondent.*” By
Resolution dated 22 May 2009, MIBAM denied the requested extension declaring that ARAPCO’s
rights to the concession had been terminated.*”! The reconsideration appeal filed by Claimant on

behalf of ARAPCO on 12 June 2009°”* was denied.*”*

496. The Resolution denying the extension of the concession was based on alleged “non-compliance”
by ARAPCO with its obligation under the Certificate of Exploitation and the 1999 Mining Law, as
documented by three memoranda of the same date and prepared by the same officers as those on
which the termination of the Brisas Concession was based.*”* Such memoranda were never
communicated to either ARAPCO or Gold Reserve.*”> Respondent’s stated grounds for denying

the concession extension were, according to Claimant, pretextual, MIBAM having “repeatedly

analysed and verified that the concession was in compliance. 76

infrastructure for the Brisas Project was recognized by MIBAM’s Technical Report of 26
September 2006. The Ministry’s Report states: “This concession forms an integral part of the
Brisas Project given that it considers the possibility of placing in it infrastructure and installations
of this project”. It recommends at the end that action be taken before the MinAmb for the

necessary environment permits to be issued for this parcel to move the Brisas Project forward.*””

Respondent’s Position

500. Claimant envisioned using the El Pauji parcel for the siting of a slag heap and a tourist port. It

had acquired an easement to use the parcel from ARAPCO, the concessionaire, in 2006.7*4

501. According to the Fourth Clause of the easement agreement, the validity of the easement was
subject to the duration of the concession. Respondent asserts that the concession ended in July

The Tribunal’s Analysis

502. Having examined the Parties’ positions regarding this parcel and the evidence filed in that
regard, the Tribunal notes the following. Based on the power of attorney obtained from ARAPCO,
the holder of the El Pauji Concession, to deal in all matters related to this concession, **” Claimant
timely filed the application for extension on 17 January 2008, as confirmed by MIBAM.***
MIBAM failed to respond within the six-month period provided by Article 25 of the 1999 Mining
Law. MIBAM could not therefore deny, as it did by Resolution dated 22 May 2009,** the

requested extension and declare ARAPCO’s rights to the concession terminated.

503. Apart from noting in the last regard that MIBAM had issued to the El Pauji concessionaire, in a
consistent and continuous way, certificates of compliance in respect of the 1999 Mining Law, its
Regulation and the concession Mining Title,” pursuant to Article 25 of the 1999 Mining Law the
term of the El Pauji Concession had been extended by operation of law by an additional ten year
term from 20 July 2008. Accordingly, the easement agreement with ARAPCO relating to the El
Pauji Concession remained in effect, allowing Claimant to make use of the relevant parcel to site

infrastructure and services for the exploitation of the Brisas Project.

504. MIBAM Resolution denying the extension of El Pauji concession relies on the breach of a
number of Special Advantages (Nos. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 and 14), out of which Special
Advantages No. 7 (utilize the term of twenty (20) years from the publication of the Exploitation
Concession in the Official Gazette for exploitation of the chosen plots within the lots of the
concession) and 8 (commence the exploitation with the term of three (3) years from the same

publication) consist of major obligations. As indicated by the recurso de reconsideracion,

Claimant, acting on behalf of ARAPCO, relied essentially on the certificates of solvency dated 14

September 2007 annexed to the extension request (under “F”) and the automatic extension

pursuant to the “positive administrative silence principle.”**!

505. The situation under Venezuelan law regarding the extension of the El Pauji Concession is the
same as the one previously examined concerning the extension of the Brisas Concession.*” Also
in this case, in fact, Respondent terminated the El Pauji Concession by a resolution denying an

extension that had already intervened**

instead of initiating an administrative proceeding in view
of the revocation of the “tacit administrative act” by which the El Pauji Concession had been

extended, guaranteeing in that context Claimant’s due process rights.

506. As in the case of termination of the Brisas Concession, Respondent’s conduct regarding
termination of the El Pauji Concession shall be examined in the context of the alleged BIT

violations.

H. Carabobo and Virgen de Lourdes Parcels

Claimant’s Position

507. Claimant noted that the Lucia, Carabobo and Virgen de Lourdes parcels, previously indicated as

required, were no longer needed for operational purposes of the Brisas Project as at 2008.

Respondent’s Position

508. Claimant never obtained an easement over the Carabobo parcel and was thus unable to use and
expand the road on this parcel, as planned. Claimant also acquired no easement over the Virgen de
Lourdes parcel to use for installing power lines and conveyor belts for its project.>" Claimant
states that it no longer planned to place any infrastructure on Virgen de Lourdes,*”* but the fact
remains that it never acquired rights to this parcel.*°° In any case, Phase I Permit did not authorize

any activity on the two parcels.

I. Morauana, Cuyuni, Mireya and Venamo

Claimant’s Position

510. A concession over these parcels had been granted to the China Clay Guyana and Refinadora
Ecologica de Caolin by the Bolivar State Government on 8 December 2006 for the exploration and
exploitation of kaolin in the area.*°*” An easement agreement was executed on 8 December 2006 by
China Clay Guyana and Refinadora Ecologica de Caolin with Claimant regarding these parcels.
The easement agreement, which had the same duration of the concession (i.e., 20 years), had been

approved by the Bolivar Government on 29 November 2006.8

511. Claimant states that, as shown by the Brisas Project Feasibility Study, the planned use for these
parcels was for infrastructure, including access roads, conveyor belt and power line.*” The Brisas

of the project when Phase I Permit was granted. Two parcels (Carabobo and Virgen de Lourdes)
were replaced by three others (Cuyuni, Mireya and Venamo) while Lucia was not an operational

part of the Brisas Project.*°° The Administration was kept updated of these changes.*°”

Respondent’s Position

515. Claimant acquired an easement over Morauana through a contract with China Clay Guayana and
Refinidora de Caolfn on 8 December 2006.*°* Respondent notes that Claimant never sought any

environmental permits from MinAmb for this parcel.

516. Claimant acquired the Barbarita Concession on 10 June 2005, valid for 5 years, for the
exploration and exploitation of amphibolite (“Barbarita Concession”).“” It never submitted a
feasibility study on Barbarita to MIBAM. The Ministry of Environment issued one AARN on 23
February 2006.41

The Tribunal’s Analysis

518. The analysis of the evidence in the file and of the Parties’ positions in this proceeding leads the

Tribunal to conclude that these parcels were available to Claimant for use for the exploitation of

the Brisas Project.

519. Respondent has noted the absence of environmental permits for Morauana and of a feasibility

study for Barbarita. However, the V-ESIA, approved by MinAmb on February 2007, included

Morauana,*!”

while a feasibility study for Barbarita had been submitted to the Bolivar State
Government as evidenced by the obtainment of a certificate of exploitation of the Barbarita

Concession on | January 2009."!3 The Brisas Project Feasibility Study included Barbarita.*"

520. The Phase I Permit authorized works on Morauana and Barbarita, as well as on Cuyuni, Mireya

and Venamo parcels.*!°

J. Choco 5

Claimant’s Position

Claimant submits that it was forced to suspend all exploration activities on Choco 5 in March
2009 due to MinAmb’s failure to act on its application to renew the exploration permit. In
addition, MIBAM submitted Claimant’s Choco 5 investment to a comprehensive audit on 28
January 2010, after this arbitration was commenced, requesting information that it already

possessed.*"°

522. After having expended approximately US$ 1.5 million on Choco 5, Claimant states it had no

expectation that it would be permitted reasonably to develop Choco 5 property given the
developments regarding the Brisas Project.

523. In Claimant’s view, Respondent wrongly asserts that Claimant abandoned Choco 5 for
commercial reasons. It contends that having timely applied for renewal of the exploration permit, it
could no longer work after March 2009 because MinAmb did not act on its application consistent
with Venezuela’s new approach to Claimant’s activities. It was literally forced to stop work after
March 2009. Had Claimant remained at Choco 5, it says its investment there would have met a fate

similar to the Unicornio Concession that was terminated on pretextual grounds at that time.

Respondent’s Position

524. Respondent rejects Claimant’s justifications for its failure to exploit the Choco 5 Concession,
saying that it is a reconstructed fiction. Respondent contends that Claimant sat idle for at least 5
years. In September 2009, GR Minerals El Choco C.A.*"7 submitted narratives of the activities
performed under the successive AARNs during the period of those permits.*"% However, as shown
in the narratives, the majority of the exploratory activities that GR Minerals E] Choco C.A. was
authorized to carry out were never initiated, other activities being barely performed or performed

in only a partial manner.

525. In an attempt to show that it was complying with its obligations under the respective mining title
and the sublease agreement, Claimant argues that as a result of CVG’s routine inspections GR
Minerals El Choco C.A. received recurring certifications from CVG regarding its compliance with
all of its obligations under the sublease agreement. Respondent replies that these documents do not
constitute a certification of compliance with obligations, being merely inspection minutes showing
the absence of evidence of exploratory activities. GR Minerals El Choco C.A. delayed almost three
years in seeking the required environmental permits and then had almost five years to execute its

exploration program, but did not.

526. GR Minerals El Choco C.A. abandoned Choco 5 on its own initiative, arguing that it “could not

99419

reasonably or rationally proceed to invest further in the development of [Choco 5] as a result of

MIBAM’s refusal to extend the Brisas Concession and the revocation of Phase I Permit for the

417 \ wholly-owned subsidiary of Gold Reserve, sublessee of Choco 5 Concession from Compaiiia General de
Mineria de Venezuela C.A. that in turn had been leased the Concession by CVG.

 

“8 Under C-368 (2006 Annual Report for the Choco 5 Mining Concession), MinAmb Official Letter No. 01-00-19-
05-633/2007 dated September 2007 (C-60) and MARN Official Letter No. 00170 dated 27 May 2004 (C-61).

Brisas Project. Respondent suggests that this claim has no logic since each mining title has a
separate set of authorizations and Claimant has presented no facts indicating that either MIBAM or
MinAmb treated Choco 5 Concession as part of the Brisas Project or linked its fate to the Brisas
Concession. As a matter of fact, long after the Brisas Concession had expired MIBAM was still

dealing with Choco 5 as a distinct entity.

527. Respondent contends that Claimant’s complaint that it was forced to suspend all exploration
activities in Choco 5 because MinAmb failed to act on the application for renewal of the
exploration permit*”° is ludicrous. Gold Reserve did not wait even a month after its request to file
the Notice of Arbitration on 17 April 2009. The sublease agreement is still in effect, as admitted by
Claimant.””! The audit complained of by Claimant was part of the Ministry’s control of the
obligations assumed by the concessionaire and the so-called audit was no more than a standard

request for information by MIBAM’;s local office.

The Tribunal’s Analysis

528. The Tribunal is not convinced that the failure to obtain the renewal of the exploration permit was

sufficient justification for the abandonment by Claimant of the works on Choco 5 property.

529. It is true that, in March 2009, the process that led to the termination of the Brisas Concession
two months later had been initiated and the change of policy by the Administration regarding
mineral resources exploitation had been announced. However, the mining title to Choco 5 was
held by a different entity, Claimant being a sub-lessee from the holder of title, each mining title
being subject to a separate regulation. In the Tribunal’s view, therefore, the failure by the
Administration to grant the requested extension of the exploration permit amounted to conduct that
might have entitled Claimant to suspend, not to abandon, the works on Choco 5. The so-called
“order of an audit” was just a standard request for information by the local MIBAM office tasked
with monitoring mining activities. Respondent states that it cannot be transformed into a “measure

equivalent to expropriation”.

°° Memorial, para. 267.

530. For these reasons, the Tribunal considers that Claimant’s suspension of works on Choco 5 was
unjustified. It will therefore not include Choco 5 when considering below whether Respondent

violated the BIT.

CHAPTER VII. THE ALLEGED BIT VIOLATIONS

A. The Applicable Legal Framework

531. Before determining whether or not any violation of the international standards of protection of
Claimant’s investments under the BIT has occurred, it is appropriate to identify the legal
framework and the legal rules applicable to the merits of this dispute within which the relevant
facts must be examined. Once ascertained, the facts, as they result from the record, will be

analysed in the light of the applicable rules.

532. Article 54 (Applicable Law) of the Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules provides as follows in
the pertinent part:

“(1) The Tribunal shall apply the rules of law designated by the parties as
applicable to the substance of the dispute. Failing such designation by the
parties, the Tribunal shall apply (a) the law determined by the conflict of law
tules which it considers applicable and (b) such rules of international law as
the Tribunal considers applicable.”

Article XII(7) of the BIT provides as follows:

“7. A tribunal established under this Article shall decide the issues in dispute
in accordance with this Agreement and applicable rules of international law.
An interpretation of this Agreement to which both Contracting Parties have
agreed shall be binding upon the tribunal.”

533. Based on Respondent’s offer of arbitration under the BIT and Claimant’s acceptance of such
offer by the Request for Arbitration, the Parties have agreed that the rules of law “applicable to the
substance of the dispute” are the BIT and applicable rules of international law, as provided by
Article XII(7) of the BIT. In addition, as acknowledged by the Parties’ reference in their written
and oral submissions, Venezuelan law is relevant when determining certain factual matters related

to Claimant’s mining rights and as further mentioned below.

128

534. The issue is to determine the role to be assigned to international law on the one hand and
domestic law on the other. The governing law in this case is the BIT and international law,
supplemented by such rules of public international law that shall be applicable. The Tribunal has
thus been tasked with determining whether Respondent has breached obligations to Claimant
under the BIT. The role of Venezuelan law is nevertheless important in two respects. On the one
hand, it informs the content of Claimant’s rights and obligations within the legal framework
established by the relevant municipal legislation, as in the field of mining, social rights and the
protection of the environment. On the other hand, Venezuelan law also informs the content of

commitments made by Respondent to Claimant that the latter alleges have been violated.

535. Finally, Venezuelan law may be relevant for establishing the rights Venezuela recognises as
belonging to Claimant. A modification or cancellation of such rights, even if legally valid under
Venezuelan law, is relevant to, but not determinative of, a violation of a protection guaranteed by
the BIT. Whether a violation has in fact occurred is a matter to be decided on the basis of the BIT
itself and other applicable rules of international law, taking into account every element pertinent to

the present dispute, including the rules of Venezuelan law applicable to both Parties.

536. According to Claimant, by its conduct and actions to the prejudice of its investment, including
regarding the Brisas Concession and the Unicornio Concession, Respondent breached Articles II,

III and VII of the BIT. These alleged breaches shall be examined in turn below.

B. Fair and Equitable Treatment

537. Article II of the Canada-Venezuela BIT provides in pertinent part:

1. Each Contracting Party shall encourage the creation of favourable
conditions for investors of the other Contracting Party to make investments
in its territory.

2. Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the principles of
international law, accord investments or returns of investors of the other
Contracting Party fair and equitable treatment and full protection and
security.

129

Claimant’s Position

538. In relation to Article II, Claimant devotes an extensive analysis to investment treaty cases having

described the conditions under which a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard may be

deemed to have arisen. The essential aspects of this analysis may be summarized as follows.

539. Whether particular treatment is considered to be fair and equitable is a fact-dependent, case-

specific inquiry that must be assessed in the light of all of the facts and circumstances of the
particular case. Claimant submits that the focus of the inquiry should be the legitimate expectations

of the investors in the full context of the case.”

540. Relying on prior investment treaty cases, Claimant states that fair and equitable treatment means

S41.

a treatment that is “just”, “even-handed” “unbiased”, “legitimate”, “conducive to fostering the
promotion of foreign investment’, avoiding a “prejudicial conduct to the investors”, its breach

implying a “treatment in such an unjust or arbitrary manner that the treatment rises to the level that

99423

is unacceptable from the international perspective. As it has been emphasized, the host State’s

conduct must not “manifestly violate the requirements of consistency, transparency, even-
handedness and non-discrimination” and “the host State must never disregard the principles of
procedural propriety and due process and must grant the investor freedom from coercion or
harassment by its own regulatory authorities.”*** A breach of this standard need not arise out of

individual acts but can result from a series of circumstances and does not presuppose bad faith on

the part of the State.”"5

According to Claimant, numerous tribunals have underscored the central role of the investor’s
legitimate expectations in the analysis of the fair and equitable treatment obligation, such

expectation being created when a State’s conduct is such that an investor may reasonably rely on

(Memorial, para. 299)

131

through a series of arbitrary, capricious, non-transparent, pretextual and abusive measures

undertaken in furtherance of the evolving political agenda of the Chavez. Administration."

543. According to Claimant, the measures in question include:

“ethe Ministry of Environment’s conditioning the effectiveness of the
Construction Permit on its signing of the Initiation Act and, following Gold
Reserve’s compliance with the conditions of the Permit, refusing to do so,
thereby preventing the Brisas Project from proceeding;

¢ President Chavez’s commandeering the decision of whether the Initiation Act

would be signed and whether the Brisas Project was allowed to proceed;

the Ministry of Environment’s peremptory revocation, in a manner that

violated fundamental principles of Venezuelan law, without prior notice to

Gold Reserve or an opportunity to be heard, of the Construction Permit it

had issued one year earlier and on which Gold Reserve relied to invest more

than US$ 115 million more in the Project, which revocation was based on
purported environmental grounds that were without legal basis and that were
not supported by the facts of the Brisas Project, and where the revocation

(and all subsequent government acts directed at the Company) were in reality

motivated by the political agenda of the Chavez Administration, revealed

and confirmed in words and deeds of the government and its officials,
including President Chavez, to remove North American investment in the
gold sector and replace it with more politically desirable alternatives;

¢ the government’s conditioning any opportunity for Gold Reserve to regain
the revoked Construction Permit on Gold Reserve’s agreeing to mine the
Brisas Project underground, which was irrational technically and
economically and which conflicted with the Ministry of Mines and Ministry
of Environment’s prior approvals;

¢ the Ministry of Mines’ negligent treatment of the application to extend the

Brisas alluvial concession, its subsequent refusal to recognize in several

administrative acts the extension granted by operation of law, culminating in

the Ministry’s denial of the extension and termination of the concession,
without prior notice to Gold Reserve or an opportunity to be heard, based on

a determination of alleged non-compliance by the Company with special

advantages in the mining title that contradicted years of written certifications

issued by the same Ministry, on which the Company reasonably relied,
confirming the Company’s compliance with those very same obligations;

the government’s subsequent seizure and occupation of the Brisas Project

site, its seizure of all of the Company’s mining assets despite being on notice

that those assets were all attributable to the then-valid Unicornio Concession,
its transfer of those assets and the site to the state-owned company CVG

Minerven, and its physical eviction of Gold Reserve’s personnel and

contractors from the Brisas Project site; and

* the Ministry of Mines’ revocation of the Unicornio mining title, which, like
the termination of the Brisas mining title, was based on a purported
determination by the Ministry of non-compliance by the Company with
special advantages in the mining title and with the mining law that

*° Memorial, para. 300.

132

contradicted years of written certifications issued by the Ministry confirming
the Company’s compliance with those same obligations.”**°

544. Claimant alleges that many of these measures violated fundamental principles of Venezuelan
law, which is a further demonstration of their arbitrary nature and the fact that they undermined
Claimant’s legitimate expectations to be treated in accordance with the law of the country in which

it agreed to invest.

Respondent’s Position

545. Respondent states that Claimant has not established that Venezuela failed to accord fair and
equitable treatment in accordance with Article II(2) of the BIT. Respondent contests Claimant’s
view that Venezuela’s unstinting support created expectations that were suddenly dashed in 2008
with MIBAM’s refusal to extend the Brisas Concession and MinAmb’s nullification of the Phase I
Permit. Claimant’s goal is to establish that it did not receive fair and equitable treatment because
its legitimate expectations were frustrated by a series of arbitrary, capricious, non-transparent,
pretextual and abusive measures which were unfair and inequitable. However, Respondent says
Claimant has failed to meet its burden of showing conduct by Venezuela that in any way rises to

the level of a violation of the BIT.

546. Under Article II of the BIT, Respondent advocates that the ordinary meaning of the fair and
equitable treatment clause references the minimum standard of treatment of aliens and their
property under customary international law. As held by the Neer decision,*! a high threshold for
finding a breach of the minimum standard of treatment of the rights of aliens is required. Claimant
has suggested that no investment treaty tribunals other than NAFTA tribunals have interpreted the
reference to international law as meaning “the minimum standard of treatment under customary
international law.”*? Respondent says this is mistaken since also non-NAFTA tribunals have so
held.**°

547. Respondent notes that this standard has been adhered to by numerous tribunals that have made

reference to conduct “rising to the level that is internationally unacceptable”*** or “decision clearly

improper and discreditable, “outright and unjustified repudiation of the relevant

437 to measures “srossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, arbitrary beyond a

merely inconsistent or questionable application of administrative or legal policy or procedure.

548. Respondent contends that Claimant’s reference to cases in which tribunals have held that “fair
and equitable treatment” means “treatment in accordance with the principles of international law”
not limited to the minimum standard of treatment, is inapposite. Claimant relegates the reference to
“principles of international law” to function as an interpretative aid rather than as a source of legal

obligation. Respondent’s position is that this reference is to be understood as only reflecting the

439

minimum standard of treatment.””” Moreover, Respondent recalls that Canada has consistently

expressed the position, relied upon by NAFTA tribunals, that standards of treatment afforded
under its post-NAFTA BITs (including the BIT applicable to this proceeding) contain the same
standard of treatment as Article 1105 of the NAFTA, namely customary international law
minimum standard.*° Article 32 of the Vienna Convention allows recourse to supplementary

means of interpretation to confirm the meaning resulting from Article 31 of the Vienna

1

Convention.“' Other treaties on the same subject-matter offer supplementary means of

interpretation. Canada’s new model foreign investment protection agreement confirms Canada’s

pre-existing intention in negotiating Article II(2) of the Bir.”

549. ICSID jurisprudence cited by Claimant requires it to show that specific representations or
promises or commitments were made for there to be legitimate expectations. In other words, such
expectations cannot be solely the subjective expectations or motivations of the investor.“
Respondent states that there had been no assurances by any Venezuelan authorities that Claimant
would receive all the permits necessary for the so-called Brisas Project, such authorities having
timely expressed concerns about the commercial viability of the Brisas Project and the significant

environmental and social implications thereof.

550. In contrast to the facts in previous investment cases referenced, Respondent alleges that
Claimant was not willing to discuss cooperative solutions, as suggested by MinAmb in order to
proceed with the mining project in an environmentally sound manner, nor was it treated in a non-
transparent way as related concerns were communicated to it in a timely manner following the
review of the V-ESIA. The assessment of the reasonableness of expectations must take into
account the investor’s due diligence regarding the host State’s regulatory environment and the
business risk. Venezuela’s correct exercise of its regulatory discretion cannot be deemed a breach

of the BIT’s fair and equitable treatment obligation.

551. Respondent’s position is that Claimant’s expectations regarding the Brisas Project are not
legitimate or reasonable. Venezuela did not make any specific assurances or commitment to induce
Claimant’s expectations. Respondent asserts that granting concessions or approving feasibility
studies is not a promise that all necessary permits will be granted, particularly permits from a
different ministry. MIBAM spent years trying to get Claimant to make sufficient progress to
advance the exploitation phase, to the point of intervening when Claimant complained of
MinAmb’s delay in granting permits to occupy the concession territory.“ The delay was for a
limited period of time and was due to the need to assess the effects of the Supreme Court’s

injunction regarding the Imataca Forest Reserve.

552. Respondent declares that halfway through the twenty year term of the Brisas Concession,
Claimant dramatically changed its mining development plan. This change necessitated different
authorizations and delayed further the framework for exploitation. Venezuela’s previous
behaviour could not therefore have given rise to legitimate and reasonable expectations on behalf

of Claimant that permits would be granted, especially considering the concerns repeatedly

135

expressed by various governmental agencies regarding the mitigation of the environmental

consequences of a massive “project”.

553. Claimant was aware that the viability of the new project depended on its ability to acquire
concessionary interests for at least twelve parcels of land and on the agreement with third parties
regarding the use of neighbouring Cristina 4 as part of the Brisas Project. It was also aware of the
environmental and social challenges of the new project, situated in one of the most important
forest reserves. Respondent maintains that Claimant was not authorized at any time to change the
use of the land and MIBAM never agreed to convert the work contracts into concessions, as
requested by Claimant. The fact that the intended use of the parcels was disclosed to MinAmb does
not imply consent by MIBAM for such parcels to be used for any purpose other than for

exploitation of minerals.

554. Respondent also contends that Claimant’s reliance on the certificates of solvency was
unreasonable. According to Respondent, these certificates were issued by low-level functionaries
lacking authority to certify compliance with all of Claimant’s legal obligations under Venezuelan

law and the corresponding mining title.

555. According to Respondent, the threshold State conduct for finding a breach of the minimum
standard of treatment under customary international law is high.“ Even if Claimant appears to
accept the minimum standard of treatment as the applicable treatment under the BIT, it asserts that
the minimum standard has moved beyond the principle identified in the Neer case to a more
flexible, less stringent standard, claiming that NAFTA tribunals have repeatedly rejected Neer.“
Respondent asserts that, whether or not the Neer standard has survived the test of time, the severity
of State conduct required for a finding of the minimum standard of treatment under customary
international law remains reflected in the substance of the Neer standard.“4” Claimant has failed to

meet the burden of establishing the evolution from the Neer standard.“

556. Finding a breach of the minimum standard must, in Respondent’s view, take into account all

relevant circumstances, including the nature and complexity of the concerned issue and the good

136

faith effort on the part of the State agencies to fulfill the requirements of host State law. Moreover,
a finding of such breach must be made in the light of the high level of deference that international
law generally extends to the host State’s right to regulate matters within its borders, as held by
other tribunals.“ Present circumstances distinguish the case from other cases relied on by

0

Claimant,“ in which governmental agencies were found to have “abused” their authority or

otherwise coerced investors to “give up” concession rights.

557. Respondent states that it would not have been prudent for MinAmb to sign the Acta de Inicio
while the strong environmental concerns of the technical staff were being discussed. Claimant
chose not to challenge MinAmb’s decision not to sign by a recurso por abstenci6n or recurso en
carencia, as so identified by Respondent’s expert Professor Iribarren.**! The annulment of Phase I
Permit was founded upon MinAmb’s statutory and constitutional authority to annul permits that
are contrary to Venezuela’s environmental laws and its constitutional obligations to protect the
environment, promote sustainable development and protect the rights of indigenous peoples.
Claimant having chosen not to pursue its due process rights under Venezuelan law regarding that

decision, it cannot now complain of a denial of such rights.

558. According to Respondent, Claimant had no automatic right to the extension of the Brisas
Concession under Venezuelan law nor a right that the Unicornio Concession would not be
terminated, regardless of Claimant’s compliance with its obligations under the mining titles.” No
abusive or arbitrary conduct may therefore characterize MIBAM’s failure to extend the
concession. MIBAM provided detailed justification for its administrative decision terminating the
Brisas Concession and informed Claimant of the right to appeal any such decision. Claimant,

however, decided to waive its right to proceed further in the process in favour of this arbitration.

559. The principle of silencio administrativo positivo could not operate to renew the concession since
it does not apply to the Brisas Concession, which was granted under the 1945 Mining Law. Even if
applicable, it operates only where the requesting concessionaire is “solvent”, which was not
Claimant’s case. The seizure of assets relating to the concession was also in accordance with due

process under Venezuelan law.

560. Respondent states that the Unicornio Concession was subject to the requirement that Claimant
comply with pertinent legal norms under the concession and Venezuelan law, as well as with any
of the seventeen special advantages in the Unicornio Mining Title and constituting as many

grounds for termination of the concession.

561. When Claimant had not fulfilled its obligations ten years into the concession, MIBAM rightfully
terminated the Unicornio Concession. This was done in accordance with a fully transparent
administrative proceeding initiated on the basis of Claimant’s breaches of Articles 61 and 98 of the
1999 Mining Law, as well as some of the special advantages under the Unicornio Mining Title.
Claimant waived its due process rights in that regard, choosing to pursue its claims under the

present arbitration.

562. Respondent notes that the cases cited by Claimant in support of its proposition that legitimate
expectations may be based on “general” promises do not dispute the fundamental proposition that
such expectations may arise only as a result of specific and unambiguous State representations

directed at the investor.*

563. Venezuela submits that Claimant’s allegation that its investments were denied fair and equitable
treatment under Article II(2) of the BIT is unfounded in law and in fact. Consequently, it must be

dismissed in its entirety.*™*

The Tribunal’s Analysis

564. Having thoroughly considered the Parties’ written and oral submissions and the evidence in the
file of this proceeding, the Tribunal has concluded that by its conduct Respondent has breached the
obligation to accord Claimant’s investment fair and equitable treatment (“FET”) under Article

II(2) of the BIT.
565. In the reasoning that follows, the Tribunal shall begin by analysing the content of the FET

standard in accordance with the principles of international law, such principles being expressly

453 Rejoinder, para. 342.
454 Rejoinder, para. 376.

138

referred to by Article II(2) of the BIT. It shall then describe the measures and conduct undertaken

by Respondent that in its opinion result in the breach of the FET.

566. The Tribunal shares the view expressed by other investment treaty tribunals that in order to
establish whether an investment has been accorded fair and equitable treatment, all of the facts and
circumstances of the particular case must be considered. In particular, the Tribunal agrees that
even if a measure or conduct by the State, taken in isolation, does not rise to the level of a breach
of the FET, such a breach may result from a series of circumstances or a combination of
measures.*> In the Tribunal’s view, this is the more so when the measures are part of a State

policy aimed at gaining control of the object of the investment.

567. Article II(2) of the BIT*® refers to the “principles of international law” in accordance with
which fair and equitable treatment is to be bestowed. To determine these principles the Tribunal
must consider the present status of development of public international law in the field of
investment protection. It is the Tribunal’s view that public international law principles have
evolved since the Neer case and that the standard today is broader than that defined in the Neer
case on which Respondent relies.” As authoritatively held, the Neer award “had nothing to do
with the treatment of foreign investors or investments. It did not address what is fair and
equitable”, noting “that Neer is far from what is fair and equitable”.*** As held by the tribunal in
Mondev when disregarding the Neer standard as controlling today, “both the substantive and

procedural rights of the individual in international law have undergone considerable

developments.”**°

455 The cumulative effects of State’s measures or conduct as integrating a breach of the FET has been considered in

El Paso Energy International Company v. Argentine Republic, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Award, 31 October
2011, holding as follows: “The fact that none of the measures analysed — that were not outside the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction or not excluded from consideration by the Tribunal because they did not result in any significant
damage — were regarded, in isolation, as violations of the FET standard does not prevent the Tribunal from taking
an overall view of the situation and to analyse the consequences of the general behaviour of Argentina” (para. 459).

568. Rather than conducting an extensive review of the many decisions that have addressed the
conditions under which a breach of the FET may be deemed to have arisen, the Tribunal shall
examine a few cases whose factual circumstances appear to be closer to the facts of the present

case to then draw the principles applicable for deciding the dispute pending before it

569. As held by the tribunal in Saluka, a foreign investor protected by the particular treaty providing
for, among others, the FET standard,

“may in any case properly expect that the [State will] implement[] its policies
bona fide by conduct that is, as far as it affects the investors’ investment,
reasonably justifiable by public policies and that such conduct does not
manifestly violate the requirements of consistency, transparency, even-
handedness and non-discrimination”. In particular, any differential treatment
of a foreign investor must not be based on unreasonable distinctions and
demands, and must be justified by showing that it bears a reasonable
relationship to the foreign-owned investment.”**!

The tribunal held that the State had failed to accord the investor fair and equitable treatment

because it failed to consider in an “unbiased, even-handed, transparent and consistent way” the

investor’s good faith proposals to resolve the bank crisis, and by “unreasonably refus[ing] to
communicate with IPB and Saluka/Nomura in an adequate manner.“

570. Other tribunals have underscored the central role of an investor’s legitimate expectations in the
analysis of whether treatment was fair and equitable in the circumstances. Legitimate expectations
are created when a State’s conduct is such that an investor may reasonably rely on that conduct as
being consistent.*® Fair and equitable treatment also requires that any regulation of an investment
be done in a transparent manner, the importance of transparency in this regard, as noted by

Claimant,** being reflected in Article XV of the BiT.“®

failure by the NAFTA Party to honour those expectations could cause the investor (or investment) to suffer
damages”); MTD v. Chile, cit., para.164 (“Chile is not a passive party and the coherent action of the various officials
through which Chile acts is the responsibility of Chile, not of the investor”).

  

“ Memorial, footnote 624.
46> Article XV of the BIT (“Transparency”) provides as follows:

“Each Contracting Party shall, to the extent practicable, ensure that its laws, regulations, procedures and
administrative rulings of general application respecting any matter covered by this Agreement are promptly
published or otherwise made available in such a manner as to enable interested persons and the other Contracting
Party to become acquainted with them”. It is only logical to infer from this provision that “transparency” should

140

571. The investor’s legitimate expectations are based on undertakings and representations made
explicitly or implicitly by the host State. As authoritatively held, “specific representations play a
central role in the creation of legitimate expectations. Undertakings and representations made
explicitly or implicitly by the host State are the stronger basis for legitimate expectations. A

reversal of assurances by the host State that have led to legitimate expectations will violate the

principle of fair and equitable treatment.”*°

572. In Tecmed, the tribunal explained that

“Tt]he foreign investor expects the host State to act in a consistent manner, free
from ambiguity and totally transparently in its relations with the foreign
investor, so that it may know beforehand... the goals of the relevant policies
and administrative practices or directives, to be able to plan its investment and
comply with such regulations... The foreign investor also expects the host
State to act consistently, i.e. without arbitrarily revoking any pre-existing
decisions or permits issued by the State that were relied upon by the investor to
assume its commitments as well as to plan and launch its commercial and
business activities. The investor also expects the State to use the legal
instruments that govern the actions of the investor or the investment in
conformity with the functions usually assigned to such instruments, and not to
deprive the investor of its investment without the required compensation.’”*”

In that case, the relevant State agency’s decision not to renew claimant’s permit breached the
obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment, because the agency failed to provide the
investor with advance notice that its permit might not be renewed and did not provide the
investor an opportunity either to justify its actions or to solve any alleged deficiencies:

“During the term immediately preceding the Resolution [denying renewal of
the Permit], INE did not enter into any form of dialogue through which Cytrar
or Tecmed would become aware of INE’s position with regard to the possible
non-renewal of the Permit and the deficiencies attributed to Cytrar’s behaviour
— including those attributed in the process of relocation of operations — which
would be the grounds for such a drastic measure and, thus, Cytrar or Tecmed
did not have the opportunity, prior to the Resolution, to inform of, in turn, their
position or provide an explanation with respect to such deficiencies, or the way
to solve such deficiencies to avoid the denial of renewal and, ultimately, the
deprivation of Claimant’ s investment.”*®

 

also be ensured regarding the manner by which “laws, regulations, procedures and administrative rulings of general
application” are applied by the Administration.

141

Referring to Tecmed, the tribunal in MTD said that “fair and equitable treatment should be

understood to be treatment in an even-handed and just manner.”*?

573. In Waste Management v. Mexico the tribunal summarized its position on the FET standard in the
following terms:

“the minimum standard of treatment of fair and equitable treatment is
infringed by conduct attributable to the State and harmful to Claimant if the
conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory
and exposes Claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due
process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety — as might be
the case with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a
complete lack of transparency and candour in an administrative process. In
applying this standard it is relevant that the treatment is in breach of
representations made by the host State which were reasonably relied on by
Claimant.”*”°

574. In Metalclad, the Mexican Government “issued federal construction and operating permits” for a
landfill and likewise “issued a State operating permit which implied its political support for the
[claimant’s] landfill project.”*7! Metalclad was then assured that it had applied for and received all
permits necessary to undertake the landfill and continued to do so until the municipal government
issued a “stop work order” on the grounds that Metalclad failed to obtain a necessary municipal
construction permit.‘ The tribunal held that “Metalclad was entitled to rely on the representations
of federal officials and to believe that it was entitled to continue its construction of the landfill”
and that the government had therefore violated the fair and equitable treatment standard by
“fail[ing] to ensure a transparent and predictable framework for Metalclad’s business planning and
investment” or to provide an “orderly process and timely disposition in relation to an investor [...]

acting in the expectation that it would be treated fairly and justly”.47

575. Article 54 of the Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules directs ICSID tribunals to apply “such
rules of international law as may be applicable” unless otherwise agreed by the parties. This
reference may be considered to include the “general principles of law recognized by civilized

nations” referred to in Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice.

576. With particular regard to the legal sources of one of the standards for respect of the fair and
equitable treatment principle, i.e. the protection of “legitimate expectations”, these sources are to
be found in the comparative analysis of many domestic legal systems.*”* This has been succinctly

5

stated recently by other ICSID tribunals, for example in Total v. Argentina” and in Toto

Construzioni Generali SpA v Republic of Lebanon“”®, Based on converging considerations of good
faith and legal security, the concept of legitimate expectations is found in different legal traditions
according to which some expectations may be reasonably or legitimately created for a private
person by the constant behavior and/or promises of its legal partner, in particular when this partner
is the public administration on which this private person is dependent. In particular, in German
law,” protection of legitimate expectations is connected with the principle of Vertraensschutz’”®
(protection of trust) a notion which deeply influenced the development of European Union Law,
pointing to precise and specific assurances given by the administration.*” The same notion finds
equivalents in other European countries such as France in the concept of confiance légitime.**° The
substantive (as opposed to procedural) protection of legitimate expectations is now also to be

481

found in English law,””’ although it was not recognized until the last decade.*** This protection is

also found in Latin American countries, including in Argentina, as stated by the Tribunal in Total v

Applying FET to the present facts

577. The measures that, according to Claimant, violated the FET provision have been set out in the
summary of Claimant’s position.** The Tribunal shall now review such measures to determine
whether they were contrary to the FET, based on the principles outlined above. Before doing so,
however, it shall make reference to the change of the State policy regarding mining since in the

Tribunal’s view such change is of relevance in the present context.

578. For almost twenty years from the granting of the Brisas Concession, the Administration raised
no objections to Claimant’s mining activities regarding what in the last stage of the relations it
alleged to be a failure to respect time-limits fixed by the corresponding Mining Law and the
Mining Title, leading to the termination of the various concessions. By the approval of required
studies, such as the Brisas Project Feasibility Study on 6 January 2003 and the V-ESIA on 9
February 2007 and, subsequently, by the issuance of the Phase I Permit in March 2007,
Respondent had impliedly confirmed the content of the many certificates of compliance
consistently issued by MIBAM. By Phase I Permit an “Authorization to Affect Natural Resources”
was issued to Claimant regarding the Brisas Project, expressly referring to the Brisas Concession
and the other concessions and mining rights comprising the Brisas Project (as mentioned in the
long preamble). Even if Phase I Permit was issued by MinAmb, MIBAM was kept informed of the
process leading to such issuance and had raised no objections and made no comments in that

regard.**°

579. Claimant had therefore good reasons to rely on the continuing validity of its mining titles and
rights and an expectation that it would obtain the required authorization to start the exploitation of

the concessions. Claimant’s reliance and expectations were reinforced by the absence of any

483 Toral v Argentina, cit., para. 128, fn 136.
484 Brewer-Carias I, para. 28.
485 Supra para. 543.

486 That MIBAM had no objections is confirmed by the Report regarding the Brisas Concession of February-March
2005, in which MIBAM certified that all Special Advantages regarding exploitation had been “complied with” (C-
1113, points 4 and 7).

144

warnings or formal notice from Respondent regarding alleged failures to fulfill its mining
obligations, even if of an essential nature. Further, in May 2007, Claimant was assured that
MinAmb was committed to the Brisas Project when it requested data and information for the Phase
II works. This information was provided by Claimant in June 2007.**’ This continued until 1
October 2007, when Claimant learnt from MinAmb that all decisions regarding the Brisas Project

would be made by the President.***

580. In the Tribunal’s view, the reasons for the termination of the Brisas, Unicornio and El Pauji
Concessions are not limited to those officially stated by MIBAM in the Resolutions of 25 May
2009, 17 June 2010 and 22 May 2009, respectively. Rather, they are to be found in the change of
political priorities of the Administration. This is shown by the position taken regarding mining of
mineral reserves starting in late 2007 by the highest levels of authority, including President
Chavez, as evidenced by a stream of statements and public announcements in November 2007,**?
10 May 2008,” 21 June 2008,"°! 19 September 2008,” 6 November 2008,“ 17 December
2008, 13 January 2009“°° and 2 July 2009.4°°

581. These statements and public announcements clearly indicate that all decisions regarding the

issuance of mining permits to Gold Reserve and the future of the Brisas Project would from that

497

time on be taken by the highest authority,’ not by the competent Ministries. The State’s

objective was the “recovery” of mineral resources (including Brisas del Cuyuni mine) to be

exploited in accordance with the “new national mining policy.”"8 On 17 December 2008, MIBAM
announced the government’s decision of “withdrawing the Brisas Concession from Canadian
miner Gold Reserve” as part of the national government’s policy to recover the country’s mining
resources, primarily gold and diamonds.*” In his Address to the Nation of 13 January 2009,
President Chavez announced: “[t]us, with this field, the Venezuelan State will control 30 billion
dollars, which is the current estimate of this field, the current estimate 30 billion, organized in five
concessions: Cristina IV, Cristina V, Cristina VI and Brisas del Cuyuni. All of them under the
control of socialism, for the development of economic growth; for national development.”°°° On
23 August 2011, President Chavez approved a “strategic action plan for the Orinoco Oil Belt and
750!

Mining Arcl establishing a plan to develop the State’s mining resources, including those

found at Brisas.

582. The change of policy by the Venezuelan Administration cannot be disregarded by the Tribunal.
It is reasonable to infer that this change at the Presidential level had a decisive bearing on the
process of progressive cancellation of Claimant’s mining rights. This process originated with the
long silence kept by the Administration from March 2007 until April 2008 regarding the signature
of the Initiation Act despite Claimant’s repeated requests to that effect. It continued with the
revocation of Phase I Permit in April 2008 and culminated with the termination of the Brisas
Concession on 25 May 2009, the El Pauji Concession on 22 May 2009 and the Unicornio
Concession on 17 June 2010. The timing of these various steps in the process and of the change in

the State policy is no mere coincidence.

583. The first two measures described by Claimant as allegedly being in violation of the FET were as
follows:

e “the Ministry of Environment’s conditioning the effectiveness of the
Construction Permit on its signing of the Initiation Act and, following
Gold Reserve’s compliance with the conditions of the Permit, refusing to
do so, thereby preventing the Brisas Project from proceeding;

e President Chavez’s commandeering the decision of whether the Initiation
Act would be signed and whether the Brisas Project allowed to proceed”.

“8 As reported by the Associated Press on 21 June 2008, Venezuela’s Minister of Environment stated that “the
government is going to favour national interests over those of foreign companies in the mining sector”, that

Venezuela is “taking control” to “save and appropriate what is ours” (C-687).

5°! Claimant’ s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 81.

146

Due to the unity of context, these two measures shall be considered together.

584. It is worth recalling that the signature of the Initiation Act was one of the conditions to which the
Authorization under the Phase I Permit was subject. Condition No. 9 provided as follows (English
and Spanish texts):

“Prior to the commencement of the activities, GOLD RESERVE DE
VENEZUELA, C.A., - Compaiiia Aurifera Brisas del Cuyuni, C.A. will have
to notify the Bolivar State Environmental Office, as well as the Environmental
Monitoring and Control Office and this Administrative Permit Office,
regarding the development of said activity and will have to sign an Initiation
Act. In this Act, a detailed schedule of the activities to be developed will be
provided, which will form part of the file and will be used for Environmental
Auditing and Control”.

“Previo al inicio de las actividades, la GOLD RESERVE DE VENEZUELA,
C.A. — Compania Aurifera Brisas del Cuyuni, C.A. deberd notificar a la
Direccién Estadal Ambiental Bolivar, asi como a la Direccion Genral de
Vigilancia y Control Ambiental y esta Oficina Administrativa de Permisiones,
sobre el desarollo de dicha actividad y debera firmarse un Acta de Inicio. En
este acto se consignaré un cronograma detallado de las actividades a
desarrollar, el cual pasaré a formar parte del expediente y sera utilizado
como Auditoria y Control Ambiental’.

585. The content of the Initiation Act, namely the provision of “a detailed schedule of activities to be
developed” to be used for environmental auditing and control, suggests that it had to be prepared
by Claimant. The plain reading of the English text of Condition No. 9 suggests that the Initiation
Act had to be signed by Claimant (“Gold Reserve... will have to sign an Initiation Act”), although
some doubt regarding the signatory party may arise from the wording of the Spanish text (“...
debera firmarse...”). Be that as it may, the fact that the Initiation Act had to be signed by MinAmb

is common ground between the Parties and is therefore accepted by the Tribunal.

586. Given the content of the Initiation Act, the Tribunal does not share the view expressed by
Claimant’s expert, Professor Brewer-Carias, that the signature of the Initiation Act was rather “a
procedural formality”. The signature of this Initiation Act was in fact conditioned upon the
verification by MinAmb that all conditions to be satisfied “prior to beginning any activities” 503

had been fulfilled. Claimant contends that MinAmb was aware that all such conditions had been

502

°° Specifically, Conditions Nos. 3, 4, 5, 7, 10 and 23: see Claimant's letter to MinAmb dated 16 May 2007 (C-480).

147

satisfied, as shown by its letter to MinAmb on 16 May 2007.** Once such conditions had been

satisfied, MinAmb had to sign the Initiation Act, there being no discretion in that regard.

587. MinAmb never suggested to Claimant that the Initiation Act could not be signed because the
various conditions precedent had not been satisfied, nor did it express to Claimant any serious
concern that may have been present within the Ministry regarding the environmental impact that
would be caused by the Brisas Project — a concern that some of Respondent’s witnesses gave
evidence about during this proceeding.* Lack of transparency of Respondent’s conduct in this
regard is manifest considering that in lieu of raising that concern with Claimant, MinAmb
requested that the modification of the main access road that had been requested by MIBAM be
provided. This request had been accepted by Claimant.*® Claimant’s letter to MinAmb dated 14
August 2007 evidences that the Ministry had conditioned the signature of the Initiation Act on
MIBAM’s approval of the alternate main access road. By enclosing with this letter MIBAM’s
official approval of the same date, Claimant again requested the signature of the Initiation Act,”

relying on the fact that no remaining conditions had to be fulfilled.

588. No such signature having been obtained, Claimant requested a meeting with MinAmb. During
the meeting, which was held on 1 October 2007, according to Mr Rivero, who was present at the
meeting, Minister Ortega and Vice-Minister Garcia mentioned that they could do nothing since the
issue was “in the hands of the President” and “out of our control.”** These statements by the
highest level of authority within MinAmb™ have not been disputed by Respondent during this
proceeding. Indeed, they could not have been disputed inasmuch as they reflected the actual

prospects of the Brisas Project at the time, as shown by the evidence in the file.

589. The veracity of Claimant’s narrative of what was said during the 1 October 2007 meeting is
confirmed by the letter addressed by Gold Reserve to President Chavez on 19 November 2007,
requesting a meeting to discuss the future of the Brisas Project. The letter refers to the content of
the 1 October 2007 meeting with Minister Ortega, in particular that “the future of the Brisas
Project was in your hands, Mr President, and that the execution of the Initiation Act would be

590. These developments reveal that the real reason for MinAmb’s failure to sign the Initiation Act
was not (or not only) the serious concern over the environmental impacts the Brisas Project, as
alleged by Respondent during this proceeding. Clearly, the change of policy by Venezuela
regarding mineral exploitation, as evidenced by the numerous announcements and statements
made during this period by the highest level of the Administration, including President Chavez,>!!

motivated Respondent’s conduct.

591. In the Tribunal’s view, Respondent violated the BIT’s fair and equitable treatment provision
through the measures and conduct that have been examined above. Respondent’s failure to sign the

Initiation Act despite Claimant’s repeated requests without explaining the reasons for such

512

inaction, rather reinforcing Claimant’s expectation that such signature would be forthcoming

once the proposed alternative access road had been accepted, amount to conduct evidencing
(through acts and omissions) a lack of transparency, consistency and good faith in dealing with an

investor.

592. The second measure in alleged breach of the FET is described by Claimant as follows:

“The Ministry of Environment’s peremptory revocation, in a manner that
violated fundamental principles of Venezuelan law, without prior notice to
Gold Reserve or an opportunity to be heard, of the Construction Permit it had
issued one year earlier and on which Gold Reserve relied to invest more than
US$ 115 million more [sic] in the Project, which revocation was based on
purported environmental grounds that were without legal basis and that were
not supported by the facts of the Brisas Project, and where the revocation (and
all subsequent government acts directed at the Company) were in reality
motivated by the political agenda of the Chavez Administration, revealed and
confirmed in words and deeds of the government and its officials, including
President Chavez, to remove North American investment in the gold sector
and replace it with more politically desirable alternatives.

The government’s conditioning any opportunity for Gold Reserve to regain the
revoked Construction Permit on Gold Reserve’s agreeing to mine the Brisas
Project underground, which was irrational technically and economically and

Act would not be signed, Romero, one of Respondent's witnesses, replied: “Yes, it is as you say” (Transcript,
February 2012, Day 3, 874:17-20).

which conflicted with the MIBAM and the Ministry of Environment’s prior
approvals.”*! 3

593. As noted above, in the Revocation Order, MinAmb declared the “absolute nullity’ of the
Construction Permit issued on 27 March 2007 and as a result revoked the same “for reasons of
public order.”*'* The Revocation Order refers initially to the “fundamental duty of the Venezuelan
State to guarantee the protection of the environment and populations confronted with situations
that constitute a threat to, make vulnerable, or risk the people’s physical integrity, as well as
involve imminent damage to the environment’. It also refers to the public administration ability

“to review and correct its administrative actions, including the revocation of administrative acts”.

594. The Revocation Order sets out the grounds for the revocation of the Construction Permit,
essentially referring to the state of emergency declared on 26 June 2006 in the area of the Imataca
Forest Reserve “‘as the mining activities in Bolivar State had altered the environment...thus having
affected the nearby populations, indigenous communities, and the rest of the collective’. It then
refers to the “serious environmental deterioration of the rivers, soil, flora, fauna and biodiversity in
general, caused by the uncontrolled mining activities performed by the large number of miners

present in the area”.

595. The Tribunal acknowledges that a State has a responsibility to preserve the environment and
protect local populations living in the area where mining activities are conducted. However, this
responsibility does not exempt a State from complying with its commitments to international

investors by searching ways and means to satisfy in a balanced way both conditions.

596. The Emergency Decree referred to in the Revocation Order was in force when the Construction
Permit was issued on 27 March 2007. It is to be assumed that MinAmb had verified, prior to
issuing the Construction Permit, that the works to be authorized did not conflict with the objective
of the Emergency Decree. That this concern was well considered appears to be confirmed by the
reference in the text of the Construction Permit to a number of conditions imposed on Claimant for
the protection of the “environment, including, but not limited to, posting a performance bond
“guaranteeing the use of the required conservation and recovery measures in the event of

environmental deterioration.”*!> Almost all of the conditions set out at the end of the Construction

Permit relate to the environment. The Emergency Decree had a one-year term, and thus expired on
26 June 2007. There was no warning by MinAmb that the situation regarding the environment had

significantly deteriorated since the date on which the Construction Permit was issued.

597. The reference in the Revocation Order to “uncontrolled mining activities” being conducted in
the area by a large number of miners is contradicted by the Inspection Report issued by MIBAM
one month before the date of the Revocation Order. This Report states (at the end) that “no
evidence of (exploration or exploitation) mining activities was found during the walk around.”*'° It
is only logical that had “uncontrolled mining” been conducted in the area, particularly if by a

“Jarge number of miners,” MIBAM’s Inspection Report would have so indicated.

598. Respondent contends that following the issuance of the Phase I Permit, MinAmb’s concerns
regarding the impacts of the Brisas Project on the environment increased and that, as of April
2008, Claimant had not completed a satisfactory EAE or the requested joint study with Crystallex
regarding the development of joint infrastructure plans. The Tribunal does not underestimate
MinAmb’s concerns regarding environmental protection. It notes that none of the above grounds
of concern was mentioned in the Revocation Order and, in any case, that the better course of action
for addressing any growing concerns would have been to examine with Claimant how best to

proceed to alleviate the same.

599. Ata meeting held on 18 June 2008 jointly with Crystallex, MinAmb’s Vice-Minister Garcia said
that President Chavez had decided to provide an opportunity for the permitting of both projects to
be reconsidered. The proposal was to mine the projects underground rather than through open pits,
so as to enhance environmental and social aspects of the projects. However, according to Claimant,
the only feasible way to mine was through open pit mining given the nature of the mineral deposit.
The open pit mining had already been approved by both MIBAM and MinAmb in the Brisas
Project Feasibility Study and V-ESIA, respectively. Claimant therefore stated that underground
mining was not a feasible option. Three days later, on 21 June 2008, MinAmb’s Vice- Minister
Garcia was quoted in the press saying that the government would favour national interest over
foreign companies in the mining sector and that the State was “taking control” to “save and

appropriate what is ours.”°!7

2008 (C- 687).

151

600. The Tribunal finds that Respondent’s conduct did not accord with the obligations required by the
FET standard in the BIT. Respondent issued the Revocation Order without allowing Claimant an
opportunity to be heard. It is only reasonable to infer that MinAmb’s conduct was determined by

the change of State’s policy inaugurated by President Chavez.

601. The above considerations lead the Tribunal to conclude that Respondent breached the FET
provisions regarding the measure under consideration. The absence of any recourse by Claimant
against the Revocation Order that may have been available under Venezuelan law, as alleged by
Respondent, does not change this conclusion. The fact that Claimant chose to pursue the present
arbitration, rather than any alternative domestic remedies does not exculpate Respondent’s
conduct. Raising pretextual questions such as the access road issue, or untenable propositions,
such as underground mining, and deliberately avoiding any dialogue with Claimant aimed at

solving outstanding problems made things irreversible.

602. The third measure taken by Respondent allegedly in violation of the FET is described by
Claimant as follows:

e “the Ministry of Mines’ negligent treatment of the application to extend
the Brisas alluvial concession, its subsequent refusal to recognize in
several administrative acts the extension granted by operation of law,
culminating in the Ministry’s denial of the extension and termination of
the concession, without prior notice to Gold Reserve or an opportunity to
be heard, based on a determination of alleged non-compliance by the
Company with special advantages in the mining title that contradicted
years of written certifications issued by the same Ministry, on which the
Company reasonably relied, confirming the Company’s compliance with
those very same obligations;

e the government’s subsequent seizure and occupation of the Brisas Project
site, its seizure of all of the Company’s mining assets despite being on
notice that those assets were all attributable to the then-valid Unicornio
Concession, its transfer of those assets and the site to the state-owned
company CVG Minerven, and its physical eviction of Gold Reserve’s
personnel and contractors from the Brisas Project site.”>'8

603. The events surrounding the requested extension of the Brisas Concession and its subsequent
termination by MIBAM’s Resolution of 25 May 2009 have already been described and shall not be
repeated here. Such events involve issues of Venezuelan law on which the Parties and their legal

experts thoroughly disagree. The Tribunal has already determined those issues and shall not revisit

$'8 Memorial, para. 300.

152

them, except to the extent that they reveal conduct by Respondent that is in breach of the FET

obligation under the BIT.

604. Among such issues, the most relevant one is the value and effect of the “certifications of
compliance”, as to which the Tribunal has already reached a conclusion to the extent necessary for

its determination regarding BIT violations.*"”

605. The Tribunal shall add at this juncture that Respondent must have been aware that MIBAM’s
repeated and consistent certifications of Claimant’s compliance with its obligations under the
concessions, the mining rights and the mining contracts, as the case may be, generated an
expectation that delays or other failures to fully abide by the applicable rules had been and would
continue to be accepted by the Administration. Because of Respondent’s consistent attitude,
Claimant expected to be permitted to continue working on the project by investing substantial

amounts to provide the necessary financing.

606. In the present case, Respondent’s breach of legitimate expectations as a FET component is of
particular significance in view of the value attributed to legitimate expectations by Venezuelan
law. As opined by Claimant’s legal experts, Professor Brewer-Carias, administrative acts
terminating the concessions had to respect a number of principles governing such acts as they
affect individual rights: they have to be “reasonable, rational, logical, proportional, equalitarian
and non-discriminative; and, in this case, issued according to the principles of bona fide and
respecting legitimate expectation (confianza legitima) created on the matter by the same
Administration.”*° The same expert adds that “these administrative acts of certification create
legitimate confidence in the concessionaires regarding the verification by the public administration
of the accomplishment of their mining duties and obligations according to the concessions and
contracts.”>7! Respondent’s legal expert, Professor Iribarren, confirms the application of the
principle of “legitimate confidence” developed in his opinion mainly by Venezuelan case law?
He points out that for its application under administrative law in the case of public entities,
especially Governments, “the conduct must be constant and reiterated to the point of constituting a

stable situation and presupposing its “indefinite” repetition over time whenever the same

5! Supra para. 385.

*1 Thid. para. 189.

* Tribarren II, para. 4

153

. + op 79523
circumstances exist.”*”

The Tribunal notes that these conditions are fully met by the compliance
certificates consistently issued by the Administration to Claimant throughout the life of the latter’s

mining and contractual rights.

607. The practice that had been so consistently followed regarding the handling of relations with
Claimant as holder of mining rights in Venezuela changed when the State’s policy concerning
mining activities changed. This fact does not excuse Respondent’s conduct, rather it confirms that
such conduct was in breach of the FET standard as it was driven by political reasons. This also
explains Respondent’s failure to accept that the Brisas Concession term had been extended by

operation of law, just as it had for the El Pauji Concession at about the same time.

608. Further evidence of conduct contrary to the BIT standard is the delay by which MinAmb failed
to grant the required environmental permits. This delay made it difficult for Claimant to comply
with the time periods prescribed by the corresponding Mining Law and the Mining Title. That such
delays occurred and that they were MinAmb’s responsibility is shown by the fact that MIBAM had
to intervene to ask MinAmb to expedite the granting of such permits, stressing that Claimant’s
project was in the “national interest”.°™* Nothing would have prevented MIBAM from considering
such delays as a force majeure event under Article 61 of the 1999 Mining Law or under other rules
of Venezuelan law, with the effect of suspending the period for Claimant’s fulfilment of

obligations. However, this was not done.

609. The reasons given by the tribunal in the Metalclad v. Mexico case for concluding that a breach of
the FET provision had occurred can also be applied to the present case: “failing to ensure a
transparent and predictable framework for Metaclad’s business planning and investment” or to
provide an “orderly process and timely disposition in relation to an investor acting in the
expectation that it would be treated fairly and justly...”°76 The conclusion here is the same as in
the Metalclad case: Respondent failed to accord Claimant FET regarding the whole process
leading to the termination of the Brisas Concession by failing inter alia to respect Claimant’s due

process rights.*?7

610. The process by which, following termination of the Brisas Concession, the government
recovered the mining assets of the concession, conformed to its entitlement according to the
Special Advantage No. 15 under the Brisas Concession. A copy of the Acta de Recepcidén
recording the recovery of assets listed as belonging to the Brisas Concession was given to
Claimant’s representative. However, Respondent’s failure to respect due process rights of
Claimant regarding the manner by which the Brisas Concession was terminated equally applies to

the Government’s recovery of the mining assets of that Concession.

611. The last measure complained of by Claimant is so described:

“The Ministry of Mines’ revocation of the Unicornio mining title, which, like
the termination of the Brisas mining title, was based on a_ purported
determination by the Ministry of non-compliance by the Company with special
advantages in the mining title and with the mining law that contradicted years
of written certifications issued by the Ministry confirming the Company’s
compliance with those same obligations.”°"*

612. As in the case of the Brisas Concession, the events surrounding the termination of the Unicornio

Concession have already been described and shall not be repeated here.

613. When considering the manner in which relations with Claimant had been handled by Respondent
regarding the Brisas Concession, one cannot fail to note the changed attitude adopted with regard
to the last period of the Unicornio Concession term. Respondent’s cooperative attitude regarding
Claimant’s conduct of the mining activities lasted for the entire initial term (twenty years) of the
Brisas Concession. This attitude changed drastically with regard to the Unicornio Concession long
before the end of its initial term (still of twenty years). The Unicornio Concession’s termination
was based substantially on the same grounds as the Brisas Concession’s termination. However,
with regard to the Brisas Concession these grounds were not raised by Respondent for a
considerably longer period of time than regarding the Unicornio Concession. In both cases,
Claimant had relied on Respondent’s acceptance of the manner in which the mining activities were
being conducted due to the combined effect of the certifications of compliance and the absence of
specific complaints by the Administration. As a result, despite the fact that the two concessions
had been issued at different times (in 1988 as to the Brisas Concession and in 1998 as to the
Unicornio Concession), their termination dates were rather close: 25 May 2009 for the Brisas

Concession and 17 June 2010 for the Unicornio Concession. As in the case of the Brisas

*°8 Memorial, para. 300.

155

Concession, failure to ensure a transparent and predictable framework for the Unicornio

Concession was in breach of the FET.

614. In addition to the measures examined above, the following may be noted regarding Respondent’s
conduct in light of its obligation to accord Claimant FET under the BIT. Respondent’s actions
were part of a well-coordinated program aimed at cancelling the Brisas Project, as confirmed by
the circumstances leading to the termination of El Pauji Concession when compared to those
leading to the termination of the Brisas Concession. The date the two concessions were to expire
was more than three months apart — i.e. 18 April, 2008 and 20 July 2008, respectively. However,
less than a year later MIBAM ordered the suspension of the works for both concessions on the
same day, 18 March 2009. As noted by Claimant, like the “denial” of the extension of the Brisas
Concession, the El Pauji extension “denial” was based on internal memoranda analysing the state
of the concessionaire’s compliance, prepared by the same officials on exactly the same dates as the
memoranda written for the Brisas Concession. “The orders denying the extension were issued only
two days apart — on May 25, 2009 for Brisas and on May 22, 2009 for El Pauji”.-”? The need to
terminate the two Concessions expeditiously as a part of the same process led Respondent to deny
Claimant’s due process rights by failing to initiate a specific administrative procedure to revoke

the extension of the two Concessions,>”

thus violating the FET standard also in that regard.

615. As shown by the above analysis, Respondent violated the FET standard regarding the Brisas,
Unicornio and El Pauji Concessions in many different respects, including by failing to initiate a
separate administrative procedure to revoke the extension of the Brisas and El Pauji Concessions.
The number, variety and seriousness of the breaches make the FET violation by Respondent
particularly egregious. The compensation due to Claimant for such breaches should reflect the

seriousness of the violation.

C. Full Protection and Security

Claimant’s Position

616. Claimant further alleges that Respondent’s conduct violated also the duty to accord full
protection and security to Claimant’s investment. Various tribunals have held that this standard of

treatment is not limited to physical security.>"!

617. Respondent failed to accord full protection and security to Claimant’s substantial investment in
the Brisas Project by (i) refusing to deal with Claimant in a transparent manner regarding its
intentions for the project; and (ii) refusing even to meet Claimant’s representatives to explain how

Claimant should proceed following the shift in State policy towards the investment.

Respondent’s Position

618. Respondent argues that Venezuela did not breach its obligation to accord full protection and
security under Article II(2) of the BIT. As established by the jurisprudence of international courts
and tribunals and as made evident by the reference of the BIT provision to the “principles of
international law”, the full protection and security standard in the BITs codifies the general duty to
provide for protection and security of aliens under the customary international law minimum

standard of treatment.

619. Respondent submits that the standard of protection and security under customary international
law requires a host State to exercise due diligence to protect foreigners and their property from

“physical” harm, not to provide legal or economic security. This interpretation has been endorsed

532 99533

by arbitral tribunals.-°~ Only exceptionally this standard will “be related to a broader ambit.

The cases cited by Claimant do not withstand close scrutiny, considering also that the wording of

the relevant treaty provisions differs from that of Article II(2) of the BIT.

620. According to Respondent, Claimant has failed to establish that Venezuela has breached its
obligations under Article II(2) of the BIT. The mere statement that the “Project” was unlawfully
revoked in breach of the full protection and security does not demonstrate the alleged lack of
protection and security. The vague allegations of wrongful conduct by Venezuela do not satisfy the
burden to prove a breach of the treaty standard which is high and has to be supported by

conclusive evidence.°™

621. Respondent submits Claimant’s allegation of breach of the full protection and security standard
under Article II(2) of the BIT is unfounded in law and in fact and must be dismissed in its

entirety.°*

The Tribunal’s Analysis

622. The Tribunal finds that Claimant’s claim under Article II(2) of the BIT, to the extent that it
provides for the duty to accord full protection and security to Claimant’s investments, is to be
dismissed. While some investment treaty tribunals have extended the concept of full protection
and security to an obligation to provide regulatory and legal protections, the more traditional, and
commonly accepted view, as confirmed in the numerous cases cited by Respondent is that this
standard of treatment refers to protection against physical harm to persons and property. As noted
in Saluka v Czech Republic, “[t}he practice of arbitral tribunals seems to indicate, however, that the
“full security and protection” clause is not meant to cover just any kind of impairment of an
investor’s investment, but to protect more specifically the physical integrity of an investment
against interference by use of force.”**° This position was confirmed more recently in AWG v
Argentina where, following an analysis of previous decisions on the subject, the tribunal concluded
that the obligation of full protection and security required “due diligence to protect investors and

investments primarily from physical injury.”°*”

623. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the obligation to accord full protection and security under
the BIT refers to the protection from physical harm. There has been no suggestion in the present

5 Ibid, para. 614, referring to Pantechniki S.A. Contractors & Engineers v. Republic of Albania, ICSID Case No.

case that Respondent failed to protect Claimant’s investment from physical harm, and therefore no

breach of the full protection and security standard occurred.

D. Most Favoured Nation

624. Article III of the Canada-Venezuela BIT provides:

1. Each Contracting Party shall grant to investment, or returns of investors of
the other Contracting Party, treatment no less favourable than that which,
in like circumstances, it grants to investments or returns of investors of any
third State.

2. Each Contracting Party shall grant investors of the other Contracting Party,
as regards their expansion, management, conduct, operation, use
enjoyment, sale, or disposal of their investments or returns, treatment no
less favourable than that which, in like circumstances, it grants to investors
of any third State.

Claimant’s Position

625. Claimant relies on Dolzer’s and Schreuer’s confirmation that “[t]he weight of authority clearly
supports the view that an MEN rule grants a claimant the right to benefit from substantive

guarantee contained in third treaties.”°**

626. Claimant refers to the Agreement between the Government of Venezuela and the Government of
Barbados for the Promotion and Protection of Investments entered into force on 31 October 1995
which provides in Article 2(2) that Venezuela undertakes not to impair investments by arbitrary or
discriminatory measures and to observe any obligation it may have entered into regarding the

treatment of investments of nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party.

627. Similarly, under the Agreement with Paraguay for the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of
Investments, entered into force on 14 November 1997, Venezuela undertook specifically (in
Article 3) not to arbitrarily deny or unduly delay the granting of permits regarding investments

from Paraguay.

8 Dolzer and Schreuer, Principles of International Investment Law, cit., pp.190-191. See also Rumeli v.
Kazakhstan, cit., paras. 575, 581, 591; MTD, cit., paras. 100-06; Bayindir, cit., paras. 148-67.

159

628. On that basis, Claimant states that Respondent’s treatment of Claimant, which was arbitrary and
discriminatory, including by arbitrarily delaying and denying necessary permits for the Brisas

Project, was in breach of Article III of the BIT.

Respondent’s Position

629. Respondent contends that Claimant has failed to demonstrate that Venezuela breached Article III
of the BIT. Claimant seeks to benefit from allegedly more favourable fair and equitable treatment
obligations found in bilateral investment treaties entered into by Venezuela with Barbados,
Paraguay and Russia. Respondent says that Claimant cannot avail itself of the MFN provision in
the BIT to import an entirely new treatment provision into the BIT from another bilateral
investment treaty. Several preconditions under Article III of the BIT must be satisfied for its

application.

630. In particular, the “treatment”, “in like circumstances”, should be “less favourable” than that
accorded to investors of Barbados, Paraguay or Russia. Respondent notes that Claimant has the
burden of proving that each one of these elements is satisfied, but manifestly it failed to do so.
Firstly, the “treatment” under the other treaties is a completely different treatment from the fair and
equitable treatment under Article II of the BIT. Article III of the BIT does not extend the MFN
obligation to “‘all matters” covered by the BIT distinguishing between “treatment”, on the one side,
and “rights” or “privileges”, on the other, as made clear by Article II(1) of the Annex to the BIT.
Further, Article III requires a comparison of treatment accorded to investors or their investments
that are “in like circumstances”, which comparison is fact specific.>” Respondent contends that no
comparative analysis is provided by Claimant. Likewise Claimant has failed to establish the third

element necessary to establish a violation of Article III of the BIT: the “less favourable treatment”.

631. Accordingly, Respondent says Claimant has failed to prove that Venezuela’s conduct violates
even the third party treaty standard referenced by Claimant, let alone that this standard should be

imported into the Canada-Venezuela Bir.”

The Tribunal’s Analysis

632. The Tribunal considers that there is no need to reach a conclusion as to whether Article III of the
BIT imports more favorable provisions from other bilateral investment treaties with the effect of
extending the breach of FET standard to include “arbitrary or discriminatory” treatment. Given the
Tribunal’s findings on FET, there is nothing to be gained by importing these additional standards

of treatment.

E. Expropriation

633. Article VII(1) of the BIT provides, in relevant part:

Investments or returns of investors of either Contracting Party shall not be
nationalized, expropriated or subjected to measures having an effect equivalent to
nationalization or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as “expropriation”) in the
territory of the other Contracting Party, except for a public purpose, under due
process of law, in a non-discriminatory manner and against prompt, adequate and
effective compensation.

Claimant’s Position

634. Claimant submits that numerous international tribunals have recognized that a taking of property
may occur under international law through interference by a State in the use of that property or
with its enjoyment and benefit, even if legal title to the property is not affected. This was
recognized also by the European Court of Human Rights, ruling that one must look behind the

appearances to ascertain whether the situation amounted to a de facto expropriation.™!

635. Claimant notes that it is not the State’s intention, but the effect of its measures, that determines
whether interference with the use of the property rises to the level of an expropriation by depriving
the owner, in whole or in part, of the use or reasonably-to-be expected economic benefit of

property.*”

636. Rights and interests under licenses or contracts may be expropriated. This occurs whenever the
State uses its authority to deprive a foreign investor of the use, enjoyment or value of such

rights.“ Legislative or regulatory action can also constitute expropriation of concessions and
other contractual rights.“ Claimant states that if expropriation is to occur lawfully it must be
effected under due process of law and in accordance with international law requirements.“ It
must be non-discriminatory™*° and any taking must be accompanied by the payment of prompt,

adequate and effective compensation representing the genuine value of the investment.°*”

637. Claimant submits that Respondent expropriated Claimant’s investment in breach of Article VII
of the BIT by subjecting it to measures tantamount to expropriation which deprived Claimant
entirely of the benefit of the Brisas Project. Such expropriation was not for a legitimate public
purpose, was not effected under due process of law, was discriminatory and was effected without

any compensation.

638. It is Claimant’s position that even if acceptable under the applicable municipal law, authorities
relied on by Respondent recognize that permanently suspending portions of an investment without

giving the investor an opportunity to correct the error may give rise to treaty violations.**

639. It adds that expropriation occurs where State’s allegations of breach are “‘a pretext designed to
conceal a purely expropriatory measure.” It relies on Gemplus v. Mexico where the tribunal
held that a sovereign decision was reached to “pull the plug on the Concession regardless of
whether or not it was legally justified; and the manner and timing of such termination was dictated

by a strategy calculated to minimize the risk of legal proceedings and the payment of

compensation to the Concessionaire (including Claimants).”>*!

640. According to Claimant, as demonstrated by Professors Brewer-Carias and Ortiz-Alvarez,
Respondent’s contentions that its actions regarding Claimant’s investments were taken in full
compliance with Venezuela law are wrong since Respondent’s measures violated fundamental
principles of such law.**? Claimant contends that the reasons cited by Respondent for termination
were “pretextual and baseless”, with the real reason for the alleged expropriation being the policy
change instigated by the President. As a result, Claimant says that the purported terminations were

“not legitimately taken within the legal framework governing the concessions.”°*>

641. Claimant submits it had no effective recourse against the government’s political decision not to
sign the Initiation Act which, as stated by MinAmb, was “in the hands of the President”. The
subsequent revocation of the Construction Permit violated Venezuelan law and was an improper
and arbitrary act. The termination of the Brisas and Unicornio Concessions after years of
certifications of compliance was a serious due process violation, Claimant having not being given

an opportunity to cure the alleged deficiencies.

642. Claimant concludes that the evidence shows that the expropriation was discriminatory in view of
the State’s stated preference for Russian investors and to avoid dealing with US and Canadian

companies, as made evident by the President’s own statements as well as those of his Ministers.

Respondent’s Position

643. Respondent contends that Claimant has failed to offer details as to the precise rights that were
“expropriated” or the specific measures taken by Venezuela that are equivalent to expropriation. It
says Claimant’s allegations are almost entirely contrary to fact and Claimant did not possess a
“bundle of rights and legitimate expectations to develop and benefit from the development of the

Brisas Project.”>™*

644. Respondent states that Claimant decided to change its project radically in 1998, ten years before
the Brisas Concession was scheduled to expire and when it was already in breach of its obligation
to begin exploiting the concession by April 1991. The viability of the new project depended on

Claimant’s ability to acquire concessionary interests for at least eight parcels of land, including
Barbara, El Pauji, Esperanza, Lucia, NUNAI-NLNV1, NLEAV1-NLSVA1, Yusmari and Zuleima.
Claimant decided to attempt to obtain all of these concessions at a time when mining in the
Imataca Forest Reserve was subject to the limitations imposed by the Tribunal Supremo de

Justicia’s injunction in 1997.

645. The new project would have required the use of the neighbouring Cristina 4 parcel, which was
under the control of third parties, so that the pit would extend or “layback” onto that parcel.
Respondent notes that mining parcels in Venezuela are regulated by MIBAM and MinAmb on the
basis of separate and individual mining concessions and contracts rather than as unified mining
projects. The new project was likely to produce diverse, irreversible or unprecedented

environmental impacts.

646. Claimant was unable to acquire the NUNAI-NLNV1 concession, that was vital to its project, as
well as valid rights to Esperanza and Yusmari and to have its limited contractual rights to Barbara,
Lucia, Zuleima and NLEAV1-NLSAVI converted into broader concessionary rights, all these
parcels being essential to locate installations and the storage of dams and waste heaps. It failed to
obtain the use of the Cristina 4 parcel without which, as itself acknowledged, “exploitable minerals
reserves would be drastically reduced, making the project unviable.”°°>

647. Hence, it is Respondent’s position that Claimant could not possibly have a “bundle of rights and
legitimate expectations” to develop the so-called “Brisas Project” and consequently no such
“Project” existed. As held by previous international tribunals, investment treaty arbitrations are not
intended to protect investors from the commercial risk inherent in their business ventures and in
the host country’s political and economic environment.**° Having designed a project that it
ultimately could not implement, Claimant alone must bear the consequences of its inability to
develop the Brisas Project. Venezuela could not have expropriated Claimant’s bundle of rights and
legitimate expectations to develop the Brisas Project because Claimant never acquired such rights

and legitimate expectations.

648. Respondent submits that the measures taken by Venezuela to terminate the individual Brisas and
Unicornio Concessions were not expropriatory, since termination was pursuant to its express rights
under the Concessions and in accordance with Venezuelan law. For a State action to be considered
an expropriation, the State should have acted outside the legal framework of the contract or

concession on the basis of superior sovereign authority (puissance publique).”"

649. Respondent contends that any analysis of whether termination of a concession constitutes an

expropriation “must begin with an understanding of the legal framework of the Concession,”>**
requiring an assessment of the allegedly expropriated contractual rights with regard “to the
domestic law under which the rights were created.”>? Where, as is the case here, the termination
of the concession is in response to a breach of obligations by the concessionaire, Venezuela is
entitled to rescind the concession. Thus, there is no expropriation,*” unless Claimant demonstrates

that the State acted on the basis of superior governmental authority rather than pursuant to its

rights under the concession contract.**!

650. The Brisas Concession conferred to Claimant the exclusive right to extract and use gold for a
period of twenty years, renewable for two additional ten-year periods if the concessionaire
submitted a timely request and if MIBAM deemed it appropriate. In exchange for the right to
exploit the Brisas Concession, Claimant made fifteen commitments to Venezuela, in the form of
“special advantages”, and agreed that upon extinguishment of the concession for any reason all
works, improvements, assets and any other property acquired for the purpose of the concession
will become the full property of the Nation, without indemnification. Breach of any of such
obligations was a ground for extinction of the rights related to the mining title, any disputes arising
under the concession to be decided by the competent Venezuelan courts in accordance with

Venezuelan law.

651. According to Respondent, only a concessionaire that is solvente with Venezuela may obtain an
extension of the concession. The principle of silencio administrativo positivo could not renew the
Brisas Concession since Claimant was not in compliance with its obligations under the
corresponding Mining Law and the Mining Title. Each of the numerous violations of the
concession would have been sufficient to prevent the operation of silencio administrativo positivo

to renew the concession.

652. As noted by Respondent’s legal expert, Professor Iribarren, Article 25 of the 1999 Mining Law
providing for this principle applies only to concessions granted under this law.* The Brisas
Concession was regulated by the 1945 Mining Law which makes no provision for the operation of
silencio administrativo positivo, a “concept that has always been exceptional and of restricted

interpretation” under Venezuelan law and jurisprudence.*°

653. Having breached the majority of its obligations, Claimant’s right to the Brisas Concession
terminated when Venezuela exercised its right not to renew the concession. Respondent states that
MIBAM’s Resolution of 25 May 2009 terminating the Brisas Concession lawfully denied

Claimant’s request to renew the concession upon expiry of its twenty-year term on 18 April 2008.

654. Respondent rejects Claimant’s characterization of this decision as “pretextual” or “false” under
the jurisprudence. It says that Claimant never fulfilled its obligations to exploit gold and never
received environmental permits for the exploitation of Brisas and Unicornio — prerequisites to
Claimant’s ability to comply with its obligation to exploit gold.>™ The recovery of the Brisas
Concession assets did not constitute a de facto expropriation, as alleged by Claimant, since
Venezuela had an express right under Article 102 of the 1999 Mining Law and the Special
Advantage No. 15 under the Brisas Concession to recover all assets acquired in the development of

aconcession upon its termination for any reason.*

655. According to Claimant, the annulment of the Phase I Permit was expropriatory because it was
motivated by “politics not law.°° Respondent counters that Claimant failed to establish that

international law. Claimant’s loss of Phase I Permit was not necessarily permanent since Claimant

could have reapplied for it.”

According to Respondent, the revocation of the Phase I Permit was
an act in the exercise of the State’s policy to promote only environmentally sustainable mining in
the Imataca Forest Reserve, out of bona fide concern of the impact of Claimant’s mining
activities.*°* The PowerPoint presentation allegedly produced by MIBAM discussing the goal to
reduce the presence of Gold Reserve and other North American companies in gold and diamond
exploitation, recommending the suspension of Claimant’s environmental permit, carries no
probative value in Respondent’s submission. Similarly, speeches by President Chavez which were
delivered long after the annulment of the Phase I Permit and termination of the Brisas and

Unicornio Concessions are irrelevant.

656. Correctly, in Respondent’s view, the Direccién de Fiscalizacién issued tax payment forms until
18 April 2008. Contrary to its regular communication practice with various officials of MIBAM,
Respondent alleged that Claimant did not once mention that it had requested the renewal of the
concession during the six-month period prior to its expiry. The fact that Claimant’s extension
request was later found does not alter the fact that the concession had expired. Respondent states
that, after duly considering Claimant’s arguments in the recurso jerdrquico against the Direccién
de Fiscalizaci6n, MIBAM Minister ratified the decision of that office. Claimant was advised of its
right to appeal against the Minister’s decision before the Tribunal Supremo de Justicia within six

months. Claimant never did so.

657. Similarly, the Unicornio Concession Mining Title granted Claimant the exclusive right to exploit
hard-rock gold, copper and molybdenum for twenty years, with possible renewal. The Unicornio
Mining Title listed seventeen special advantages and stated that breach of these provisions would
be grounds for termination of the concession (like any other grounds established in the Mining
Law). Respondent notes that, in the event of termination for any reason, all works and assets
acquired for the purpose of the concession would become property of Venezuela, without any
compensation. Disputes arising under the concession were to be heard by Venezuelan courts in

accordance with Venezuela law.

658. Respondent states that Venezuela terminated the Unicornio Concession on 23 June 2010

pursuant to its rights under the concession and in accordance with Venezuelan law. Claimant never

568 Rejoinder, para. 497.

167

availed itself of the right to file a recurso de reconsideracion against the Minister’s resolution

terminating the concession, that remedy being available under the concession.

659. Respondent also states that there is no requirement for the Administration to notify the
expiration of the concession, this operating independently as stated by Article 97 of the 1999
Mining Law. Contrary to the allegations of Claimant’s expert, Professor Ortiz-Alvarez, the private
party has no right to receive a concession or to have a concession that has expired renewed.°”

Considering the above rules, Respondent terminated the Brisas and Unicornio Concessions within

the legal framework of the concession. Previous tribunals have held that a State’s termination of a

concession in response to a claimant’s breach does not constitute expropriation where the reasons

provided by the State were sufficiently “plausible” and “serious”.5”?

660. According to Respondent, the political reasons alleged by Claimant are flawed in many respects.
In particular, Claimant lost its right to the concession when Respondent exercised its right to

terminate the Brisas and Unicornio Concessions due to Claimant’s breaches.

The Tribunal’s Analysis

661. As set out in paragraphs 361-409 and 432-438 above, Claimant’s failure to commence
exploitation in accordance with the provisions of the corresponding Mining Titles and the Mining

Law was relied on by Respondent to terminate the Brisas and Unicornio Concessions.

662. However, the Tribunal has found that the manner in which the two Concessions as well as the
Pauji Concession were terminated constituted a breach of FET. The sudden termination of the two
Concessions conflicted with the way in which Respondent had controlled Claimant’s activities
over a long period of time without raising objections as to Claimant’s conduct or performance.
Respondent’s conduct generated Claimant’s legitimate expectations, under both international and
Venezuelan law, that it could continue its mining activities and invest additional money, confident
of being rewarded for its investment by the mineral exploitation. The Tribunal has also found that

the decision to terminate the Concessions and, as a result, the Brisas Project, was driven by the

°® Tribarren I, para. 22.

*? Counter-Memorial, paras. 474-481 (quoting Malicorp v. Egypt, cit., paras. 126-143).

168

change of State policy regarding mining development. As previously found,*”! this conduct by
Respondent was in serious violation of the standard of a fair, transparent and consistent behaviour

due by the State under Article II(2) of the BIT.

663. The Tribunal now considers whether the same conduct was also an expropriation and therefore a
breach of Article VII of the BIT. In relation to the terminations of the Concession contracts for
Brisas and Unicornio, to be able to be considered an expropriation there must have been an

exercise of sovereign authority, not just a contractual termination.

664. The Tribunal has debated at some length whether to give prevalence to the State’s interference
leading to the termination of the Brisas Project or to the formal compliance with the 1999 Mining
Law and the Mining Titles as a ground for the terminations. In the former case, expropriation
would have occurred due to Respondent’s acting in the exercise of a sovereign, not merely
regulatory, power (iure imperii). However, if the State was acting as a regulatory power enforcing

contractual rights, no expropriation would have occurred.

665. In their submissions, the Parties provided the Tribunal with a number of investment cases setting
out their position on this matter. In Suez v. Argentina, the tribunal held that “while Argentina
exercised its public authority on various occasions during the crisis, the Tribunal does not consider
that the Province’s termination of the Concession Contract was an exercise of such authority.
Rather, its actions were taken according to the rights it claimed under the Concession Contract and
the legal framework.”>”? Similarly, in Siemens v. Argentina the tribunal stated: “for the State to
incur international responsibility it must act as such, it must use its public authority. The actions of
the State have to be based on its ‘superior governmental power’ .”573 Other cases espousing similar

principles include RFCC v. Morocco and Malicorp v. Egypt.

666. However, as noted by Claimant, the above cases are also clear that an action purportedly taken
under a contractual regime may constitute expropriation where the true nature of the act was one of
exercising sovereign authority. In Bayindir v. Pakistan the tribunal observed that “the fact that a
State exercises a contract right or remedy does not in and of itself exclude the possibility of a

treaty breach.”5"4 In Malicorp v. Egypt the tribunal stated that “an expropriation occurs where a

5! Supra para. 607.

573 Siemens v. Argentina, cit., para. 253.

°4 Bayindir, cit., para. 138.

169

State’s allegations of contractual breach are ‘a pretext designed to conceal a purely expropriatory
measure’.”>”> Thus, the key issue is to determine whether the reasons cited for the terminations of
the Brisas and Unicornio Concessions were sufficiently well-founded and, if so, the terminations

would not be considered expropriations.

667. This is not a straight-forward issue, as the political motivations that undoubtedly existed make it
difficult to distinguish between sovereign and regulatory acts. As noted above, the Tribunal has
considered the issue at length. On balance, the Tribunal concludes that the nature of the breach by
Claimant (failure to exploit within the required timeframe) was such that termination on this
ground could not be said to be merely “pretextual”. This was an important provision in both
Concessions which Claimant had not complied with, and neither Respondent’s prior reassurances
nor its political motivations alter the fact that a contractual right to terminate existed upon
plausible grounds. As such, this Tribunal adopts a similar position to that taken by the Malicorp
tribunal that the reasons given by Respondent for terminating the Concessions were sufficiently
well founded that the terminations cannot be considered as a form of expropriation under

international law.

668. Consequently, the Tribunal finds that Respondent’s acts were an exercise of regulatory powers
under the 1999 Mining Law and the relevant Mining Titles, and therefore not acts of an
expropriatory nature. This does not detract from the fact that the manner by which such regulatory
powers were exercised has led to a finding of a serious breach by the State of the FET standard
under Article II(2) of the BIT. The seriousness of the breach shall be duly taken into account

when determining the amount of the compensation due to Claimant in that regard.

669. Finally, the Tribunal notes that it has focussed in the above paragraphs on the terminations of the
Concessions, although Claimant also referred to the revocation of the Phase I Permit and
Respondent’s failure to sign the Initiation Act as part of its expropriation claim. As previously
stated in this Award,*”® the Tribunal is of the view that the grounds provided for the revocation of
the Phase I Permit cannot be sustained and nor was there any reasonable justification for failing to
sign the Initiation Act. However, these points are moot in light of the legal justification for the
subsequent termination of the Concessions. Even if the prior revocation of the Phase I Permit and

failure to sign the Initiation Act could in themselves constitute an indirect expropriation, the

 

Malicorp, cit., para. 142. Also see Gemplus v. Mexico, cit., para. 4-175.
576 See supra paras. 582-591.

170

subsequent revocation of the Concessions means these prior acts had no material impact on the
Tribunal’s finding of absence of expropriation. However, such conduct is relevant in establishing

Respondent’s breach of other BIT provisions.

CHAPTER VIII. DAMAGES

A. Applicable Legal Framework

670. Before determining the quantum of damages, if any, to be awarded, the Tribunal must first

address the applicable legal principles which provide the basis for its damages assessment. The
principles that apply to determining damages in the case of a violation of FET are examined in this

section.

Claimant’s Position

. Claimant submitted its damages calculations based on a fair market value of the investment. It
contended that the valuation remained valid if the Tribunal finds only an FET breach (i.e., no
expropriation), because the breach deprived Claimant of the entire value of the investment and the
State is under an obligation to make full reparation for injury.” Claimant cited the International
Law Commission’s Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (“ILC
Articles on State Responsibility”) and the principles in the Chorzéw Factory case*”* in support of
its position and rejected Respondent’s argument that Article VII of the BIT created a sui generis
remedy that excluded application of general international law principles, for both expropriation
and other BIT violations resulting in the deprivation of property. It also referred to a number of
ICSID decisions which have applied these principles in the case of an FET breach stating that “in
the context of other treaty violations, tribunals in other investment treaty cases have observed that
there too the remedy may entail compensation for the value of property of which the investor was

deprived, to be assessed on the basis of the fair market value of that property.”*”?

5” Memorial, para. 375. Cases cited include PSEG; CME; Vivendi II and Azurix.

171

672. Claimant further contended that the principles of full reparation and of wiping-out consequences
in international law enable the Tribunal to award damages as at the date of the Award, rather than
the date of breach, if appropriate. This is particularly so where the value of the investment has
increased significantly since the date of breach. Nonetheless, Claimant’s experts calculated
damages by assessing the fair market value of the Brisas Project as at April 2008 (the date of

breach).
Respondent’s Position

673. Respondent countered that the principles set out in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility and
Chorz6w Factory do not apply because this is not a State-to-State arbitration. It contended that
Article VII of the BIT establishes a sui generis principle of compensation for expropriation —
“prompt, adequate and effective compensation” (which it acknowledged was equivalent to fair
market value). Respondent submitted that the Article VII standard should apply to breaches of
Articles II and III of the BIT, as well as Article VII, where total deprivation of the investment
occurred. In essence, Respondent’s position was that the standard of compensation should be fair
market value — being prompt, adequate and fair compensation — as at April 2008,°°° including for
breach of FET. Respondent rejected Claimant’s assertion that a later date, such as the date of the

Award, could be viewed as the date of valuation.

Tribunal’s Analysis

674. The Tribunal begins its analysis of applicable legal framework by noting that, although other
solutions could have been adopted, both Parties contend that, even in the case of no expropriation,
the appropriate measure of damages in the present circumstances is fair market value. Both Parties
have also used April 2008 as the valuation date for assessing the fair market value of the

investment.

675. Article XII(9) of the BIT provides the Tribunal with the power to award monetary damages or
restitution in the case of breach of an obligation contained therein. This provision provides the
tribunal with a wide discretion when assessing damages for breach of FET. Article XII(7) of the
BIT also requires the Tribunal to decide the issues in dispute in accordance with the treaty and the

applicable rules of international law. Therefore, the Tribunal is empowered to award monetary

58 Rejoinder, para. 566.

172

damages or restitution in accordance with principles of international law and the provisions in the
BIT. There is no suggestion in the present case that restitution is an appropriate remedy.
Therefore, the Tribunal now considers the international law principles applicable to the award of

monetary damages for breach of FET, as well as any relevant provisions of the treaty.

676. Both Parties have devoted considerable argument to whether the reference to “prompt, fair and
adequate compensation” in Article VII provides a sui generis remedy for expropriation (and for
breaches of other provisions which result in total deprivation of property), such that principles of
international law would not apply. The Tribunal does not find it necessary to determine whether
prompt, fair and adequate compensation is the appropriate remedy for expropriation, given no
breach of Article VII has been found. Concerning its application to breaches other than
expropriation, the Tribunal is not convinced that even if prompt fair and adequate compensation
could correctly be categorized as a sui generis remedy under Article VII, that it should be
considered a sui generis remedy for other breaches where a total deprivation of the investment has
resulted. Respondent has produced no evidence to support such a claim, nor is it an approach that,
as far as the Tribunal is aware, has been taken in previous investment treaty cases. Finally, there is
nothing in language of the treaty itself that would support such an interpretation. Therefore, the
Tribunal concludes that the appropriate course of action is that it award monetary compensation

under Article XII(9) in accordance with applicable rules of international law.

677. In any case, the discussion regarding whether Article VII provides a sui generis remedy may be
somewhat academic, at least in the present circumstances, as its primary relevance (given that
Respondent acknowledges that prompt, adequate and fair compensation is equivalent to fair market
value) is to arguments advanced by Claimant that, in some circumstances, more than fair market
value could be awarded by a tribunal. The Tribunal acknowledges that, in some circumstances,
changing the date of valuation may be appropriate, but does not consider that those circumstances
exist here. The Tribunal therefore finds that the valuation date to be applied to the assessment of

damages is 14 April 2008.

678. Turning now to the relevant principles of international law applicable to the award of damages
for breach of FET, the Tribunal begins with an analysis of the Chorzéw Factory principles. It is
true that this was a case involving State-to-State liability and, as Respondent correctly noted,
cannot therefore automatically be applied to a State-Investor situation. However, it is well

accepted in international investment law that the principles espoused in the Chorzéw Factory case,

173

even if initially established in a State-to-State context, are the relevant principles of international
law to apply when considering compensation for breach of a BIT. It is these well-established
principles that represent customary international law, including for breaches of international
obligations under BITs, that the Tribunal is bound to apply. Even a cursory analysis of previous

ICSID cases considering this issue confirms as much.™*! As stated in Impregilo v. Argentina:

“As regards compensation, the basic principle to be applied is that derived
from the judgment of the Permanent Court of International Justice in the
Chorzéw Factory case. According to this principle, reparation should as far as
possible eliminate the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the
situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been
committed. In other words, Impregilo should in principle be placed in the same
position as it would have been, had Argentina’s unfair and inequitable
treatment of Impregilo’s investment not occurred.”

679. The above principles complement those found in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility,
particularly in Article 31 to make full reparation for injury caused through violating an
international obligation. This, in turn, reflects customary international law. Respondent rightly
cautioned that the ILC Articles on State Responsibility primarily concern internationally wrongful
acts against States, not individuals or other non-State actors, and some prominent commentators

have warned against an uncritical conflation of the two.

680. This Tribunal has given due consideration to these arguments. Nevertheless, the serious nature
of the breach in the present circumstances and the fact that the breach has resulted in the total
deprivation of mining rights suggests that, under the principles of full reparation and wiping-out
the consequences of the breach, a fair market value methodology is also appropriate in the present

circumstances. As noted above, both Parties have taken this position in the submissions.

681. In summary, this Tribunal is empowered to award monetary compensation in accordance with
the principles of international law. The relevant principles of international law applicable in this

situation are derived from the judgment of the Permanent Court of International Justice in the

Chorzéw Factory case that reparation should wipe-out the consequences of the breach and re-
establish the situation as it is likely to have been absent the breach. As the consequence of the
serious breach in the present situation was to deprive the investor totally of its investment, the
Tribunal considers it appropriate that the remedy that would wipe-out the consequences of the
breach is to assess damages using a fair market value methodology. This conclusion accords with
the submissions of the Parties, both of whom have acknowledged that a fair market value
methodology is an appropriate way of providing effective compensation in the present
circumstances. The Tribunal therefore finds that this methodology should be applied, with a

valuation date as at 14 April 2008.

682. Finally, the fair market value of the investment is influenced by a number of different factors
that each party’s experts have addressed. As noted above, the Tribunal has already found that the
Brisas Project did not include the North Parcel of land to which no legal title existed. The Tribunal
therefore considers that the fair market value should be calculated without reference to that parcel.
While a willing buyer might have thought it could have acquired rights to this land in the future, it
could not be certain of doing so and therefore it would be speculative of the Tribunal to assume a
buyer would have valued the Brisas Project as if the legal right had been acquired. As such, the
Tribunal will value the Project using a “no layback” scenario. As noted above, no compensation is

due in relation to the Choco 5 investment.

Burden and Standard of Proof

683. Claimant acknowledges that it carries the burden of proof for proving its damages. It argues that
while damages cannot be speculative, they also do not need to be certain. The appropriate
standard of proof is the balance of probabilities and the “certainty principle” relates to the fact of

loss rather than the quantum.

684. Respondent similarly contends that Claimant has the burden of proving damages and that such
damages cannot be speculative. However, Respondent submits that damages must be proved with
“a sufficient degree of certainty” rather than being more probable than not. Respondent also
devoted considerable argument seeking to demonstrate that lost profits claimed in situations where
the investment was not yet operational are inherently speculative and do not meet the required

standard of proof.

175

685. The Tribunal agrees with the Parties that Claimant bears the burden of proving its claimed
damages. The Tribunal finds no support for the conclusion that the standard of proof for damages
should be higher than for proving merits, and therefore is satisfied that the appropriate standard of
proof is the balance of probabilities. This, of course, means that damages cannot be speculative or
merely “possible”, as both Parties acknowledge. In the Tribunal’s view, all of the authorities cited
by the Parties — including by Respondent in relation to its claim that a degree of certainty is
required — accord with the principle that the balance of probabilities applies, even if some tribunals
phrase the standard slightly differently.*** In particular, those cases that discuss the requirement
for “certainty” do so in the context of distinguishing “proven” damages from speculative damages,

rather than suggesting that a higher degree of proof is applied to damages than to liability.

686. The Tribunal further notes that, while a claimant must prove its damages to the required
standard, the assessment of damages is often a difficult exercise and it is seldom that damages in
an investment situation will be able to be established with scientific certainty. This is because such
assessments will usually involve some degree of estimation and the weighing of competing (but
equally legitimate) facts, valuation methods and opinions, which does not of itself mean that the
burden of proof has not been satisfied. Because of this element of imprecision, it is accepted that
tribunals retain a certain amount of discretion or a “margin of appreciation” when assessing
damages, which will necessarily involve some approximation.**> The use of this discretion should
not be confused with acting on an ex aequo et bono basis, even if equitable considerations are
taken into account in the exercise of such discretion.>*° Rather, in such circumstances, the tribunal
exercises its judgment in a reasoned manner so as to discern an appropriate damages sum which
results in compensation to Claimant in accordance with the principles of international law that

have been discussed earlier.

B. Approach to Calculating Fair Market Value

687. As explained above, the Parties agreed that if any damages were awarded by the Tribunal, the

calculation of these damages should be done using a fair market value approach. Each party

584 See S. Ripinsky and K. Williams, “Damages in International Investment Law” (2008), 164-165, quoted in
Claimant's Reply, para. 620.

*85 See Himpurna California Energy v. PT (Persero) Perusahaan Listruik Negara, UNCITRAL, Award, 4 May

1999, para. 441.

585 The parties referred to the application of equitable considerations and to principles of ex aequo et bono in
relation to awarding lost profits (see Reply, para. 630 er seqq and Rejoinder, paras. 603-605).

176

presented a number of experts on both mining and valuation issues to assist the Tribunal in
determining the fair market value of the Brisas Project as at April 2008. The following experts

presented written expert reports to the Tribunal:

For Claimant:
RPA: Mr Richard Lambert (mining and metallurgical experts)

Navigant: Mr Brent Kaczmarek (valuation expert)

For Respondent:
SRK: Dr Neal Rigby (mining expert)
CRA: Dr Francis Brown and Mr Leonard Kowal (metallurgical experts)
CRA: Dr James Burrows (valuation expert)

Boliden: Mr Pekka Tuokkola (saleability)

688. At the hearing of 15-16 October 2013, the above experts gave evidence, together with the

following persons who had assisted in preparing the experts reports:

For Claimant:
RPA: Dr Kathleen Altman (metallurgical issues)
Tetra Tech: Mr Mike Henderson and Mr Dave Hallman (mining issues), Mr Erik

Spiller (metallurgical issues)

For Respondent:

SRK: Mr Bret Swanson, Mr John Tinucci (mining issues)

689. It is noted that, in this Chapter, the Tribunal refers to positions taken in the expert’s written
reports by stating the name of the expert followed in brackets by the relevant firm. This is because
in the Parties’ submissions experts were sometimes referred to by name and at other times by firm.
Where the Tribunal references something said during the oral hearing, the Tribunal references the

relevant expert’s name only.

690. Both valuation experts used the Discounted Cash Flow (“DCF”) method as the primary method
for assessing the quantum of damages payable if Claimant succeeded on liability (as explained at

paragraph 822 below, Mr Kaczmarek (Navigant) also used the comparable transactions and market

177

capitalisation methods). Dr Burrows (CRA) did not provide a separate DCF calculation on behalf
of Respondent, but critiqued and made adjustments to the DCF calculation advanced by Mr

Kaczmarek (Navigant) on behalf of Claimant.

691. Clearly, any DCF calculation is dependent upon an assessment of the quantum of the mineral
deposits likely to be extracted over the 20 year period of the extended concession. The DCF
valuation by both Mr Kaczmarek (Navigant) and Dr Burrows (CRA) was initially based on
reserves estimated using a layback on the North Parcel of land. Pursuant to Procedural Order No.
2, the experts adjusted the valuation for a no-layback scenario which excluded the North Parcel.
This revision required a re-estimation of mineral deposits which in turn required examination of
the following issues by the mining and metallurgical experts: (i) pit shape and design; (ii) need for
a buffer zone; (iii) impact of stockpiling; (iv) likely delays for obtaining permits in the no-layback
scenario; (v) metallurgical issues including ramp-up, mill capacity, and metal recovery rates and

concentrate grades; and (vi) their saleability.

692. The Tribunal addresses each of the above issues in the paragraphs that follow. The Tribunal
then considers a number of financial issues which were disputed by the valuation experts, whether
the with-layback or the no-layback scenario applied. These issues include: (i) fair market value
methodology; (ii) metal prices; (iii) inflation rate; (iv) discount rate; (v) delay in receiving

revenues; and (vi) fuel and electricity costs.

693. It is only after considering all of the above issues that the Tribunal has been able to reach a
conclusion as to the damages owed to Claimant as a result of Respondent’s breach of its FET

obligations under the BIT. This conclusion is set out in paragraph 848 and 849 below.

C. Mine Plan Issues

694. The following section considers the issues relating to the mine plan, as follows: Mine Pit Design;
Buffer Zone; Stockpiles; and Delays. It concludes by assessing the impact on the estimate of

mineral deposits available to be mined under the no-layback scenario.
695. The experts that provided evidence at the hearing on these issues were: Mr Lambert (RPA), Mr
Henderson and Mr Hallman (both of Tetra Tech) for Claimant and Dr Rigby, Mr Swanson and Mr

Tinucci (all of SRK) for Respondent.

178

696. While all experts were well qualified on the issues at hand, the Tribunal found the RPA Reports
and the witnesses from RPA and Tetra Tech to be more convincing on the mine plan issues.
Respondent’s experts, as might be expected, challenged certain aspects of the RPA optimal mine
plan but, as noted below, some of these challenges were formulated in a general way without
providing any supporting analysis as to the specific effect of the alleged impact on the overall

calculation.

D. Mine Pit Design - Shape of Pit and Placement of Ramps

Claimant’s Position

697. So as to determine the optimal shape of the mine pit in the various possible no-layback scenarios
(0 meter, 25 meter and 100 meter buffer), Mr Lambert (RPA) used a software program known as

“Whittle” to design the shape of the mine pit in the no-layback scenario. Claimant stated that:

“Due to the parties’ disagreement as to whether a 100-meter buffer was
needed in the north, the parties agreed to generate alternative “Whittle
pits,” with different geographic boundaries to the north, from which
alternative mine plan scenarios could be considered. For all scenarios,
the parties agreed to use the pit slope parameters included in the 2008
Marston mine plan. The parties also agreed that for all scenarios, they
would use the metal prices assumed in the NI 43-101 Technical Report
prepared for the Brisas Project and the mining cost assumptions set
forth in the 2008 Marston mine plan.” 587

698. Mr Lambert (RPA) adopted the shape of the pit produced by the Whittle program with a zero
meter buffer as his “optimal scenario”. He stated that this design maximized access to high quality
ore in the northern section of the pit. In doing so, Mr Lambert (RPA) considered that he was not
bound under Procedural Order No. 2 to retain the original shape of the with-layback pit used in the
2008 Marston mine plan and rejected Dr Rigby’s (SRK) assertions on this point. During the
hearing, Mr Lambert noted that Dr Rigby had not in fact adopted the Marston shape without
modification as SRK had adjusted the pit shape in the south-east side in order to access what was

termed a “bullseye” (an area that had not been included in the Marston plan).***

*8 Transcript, October 2013, Day 1, 31:22-32:10.

179

699. Regarding the ramps, Mr Lambert (RPA) placed them along the eastern wall of the no-layback
mine pit, so as to allow maximum access to the high quality ore on the northern boundary. He used
the ramp locations suggested by Pincock, Allen & Holt in 2004 for their no-layback design which

did not include ramps on the north wall.

700. Mr Lambert (RPA) contended that the ramp design — which mirrored the with-layback Marston
design — used by Dr Rigby (SRK) did not make sense in the case of a no-layback scenario. Using
the same design as the with-layback scenario meant that the ramps were placed over key mineral
deposits. Mr Lambert (RPA) said that given the amount of high grade copper in the area, it would

be irrational to place ramps on the northern wall.

701. Mr Lambert (RPA) rejected Dr Rigby’s (SRK) analysis that the dual ramp system on the north
wall was required due to the unstable nature of the wall. In particular, it rejected the suggestion
that this instability was known, but not specifically included, in the Marston Report. Indeed, Mr
Lambert (RPA) said that his design made the northern wall safer as including ramps on the
northern wall would have placed additional stress on that wall, which would have been undesirable

had it been unstable.

702. During oral evidence, Mr Lambert suggested that the haulage times for his ramp design would
be the same as estimated in the Marston Report as the ramps would have exited the pit at

approximately the same point as the Marston ramps and the length of the ramps were similar.

Respondent’s Position

703. Dr Rigby (SRK) did not agree with Mr Lambert (RPA) that adjusting the mine pit shape to
maximize access to mineral deposits was the preferable option. He considered that the original
Marston pit shape should be retained so as to retain the statistical accuracy of the Marston Report
to a feasibility level (+/- 15%) and to be consistent with Procedural Order No. 2. He suggested
that using the original pit shape would allow statistics in the Marston Report to remain valid for the
no-layback design. He therefore simply moved the position of the pit to adjust for the required

buffer zone and did not change its shape.

°° Transcript, October 2013, Day 1, 26: 14-27:22.

180

704. Dr Rigby (SRK) also retained the ramp positions used in the original Marston mine plan —
placing a dual ramp system on the north wall. He said that Mr Lambert’s (RPA) new design left
the mine vulnerable if a wall collapsed because (i) the dual ramp system in place on the northern
wall in the with-layback design provided alternative access in case of a wall collapse or slip and
(ii) it provided a geotechnical catch bench on the northern wall of around 70 meters to catch

sloughage that may fall from the unstable saprolite rock in the upper section of the north wall.

705. According to Dr Rigby (SRK), the dual ramp system was desirable for safety reasons and
addressed poor geotechnical conditions, as indicated by the Marston Report when it stated: “[t]wo
haul roads were designed into phases 5 and 6 and the ultimate pit to provide greater flexibility in
ore and waste haulage routes and pit access. This also provides alternative access in the event of
slope failures.”°”°

706. In its Joint Expert Procedure Post-Hearing Brief, Respondent also said that moving the ramps
had an effect on haulage times for transporting ore out of the pit, even if the ramp length and exit
points were similar, because the entry points were different. It criticised Mr Lambert (RPA) for
estimating costs based on haulage times that had been calculated using the dual ramp system, and
therefore did not take into account any increase in costs. Respondent also emphasized that the
mine design would affect the stripping ratio which would in turn affect the costs of producing
saleable metal. It said that even if the amount of metal itself increased, the economics of carting

all the extra waste, would not make it worthwhile.

Tribunal’s Analysis

707. The initial issue that the Tribunal must consider is whether the experts were confined to using
the Marston 2008 mine design when considering the impact of a no-layback scenario or whether
the experts were able to redesign the pit to optimize value in a no-layback scenario. Claimant’s
expert took the latter position, using the Whittle tool to create an optimal design. The Tribunal
concludes that nothing in Procedural Order No. 2 required the experts to retain the with-layback pit
design to value the concession absent the North Parcel. Indeed, just the opposite - Procedural
Order No. 2 specifically asked the experts to estimate “the changes required to adjust the Brisas

Project’s mine plan due to the absence of a layback agreement within the North Parcel”. While the

5 Joint Expert Procedure Rebuttal Report of Dr Rigby, Mr Swanson and Dr Tinucci dated 3 July 2013 (hereinafter
“Rigby II (Joint Expert Procedure)”), para. 36 (emphasis in the original).

181

Tribunal agrees with the Parties that it is desirable to maintain the Marston parameters so far as
possible, there is no reason to do so where the particular no-layback circumstances suggest

otherwise, including adjusting the pit shape to maximize access to mineral deposits.

708. Indeed, all experts agreed that the Marston pit was not optimal for a no-layback scenario and
both experts made adjustments for this. Given that Dr Rigby (SRK) accepted a so-called “bulls-
eye” in the south-eastern corner of the original pit, there is no clear rationale not to accept a re-
shaping along the northern boundary so as to access to high quality mineral deposits in this area.
Similarly, Procedural Order No. 2 did not prevent the experts from re-locating ramps if there is
sound rationale for doing so. The Tribunal regrets that the experts did not request clarification
from the Tribunal on this point, as provided by the Order, at the time of producing the joint expert

report, as it may have facilitated additional agreement.

709. Based on the foregoing analysis, the Tribunal considers that the Whittle program produces the
optimum mine pit shape in a no-layback scenario. Moreover, a reasonable investor would seek to
adjust the pit to ensure access to key mineral deposits and therefore changes to the both the
Southern and Northern corners of the pit were rational in accordance with sound mining practice.

The Tribunal therefore adopts the pit shape proposed by Claimant’s expert.

710. In relation to ramp location, the Tribunal accepts Mr Lambert’s evidence that it would not make
“logical sense”! for an investor to place the ramps on the north wall and therefore lose access to

valuable ore, unless there was a specific reason (for example, a safety reason) for doing so.

711. The Tribunal discusses safety concerns regarding the north wall in more detail at paragraphs
726-734 below. It is sufficient to note here that the Tribunal finds no evidence of safety concerns
regarding the north wall. Moreover, the Tribunal finds it unlikely that the Marston Report would
have failed to refer to safety concerns regarding the stability of the north wall, had Marston been
aware of any such concerns at the time. This is especially so if Marston had deliberately designed
the dual ramp system to address such safety concerns. The Tribunal therefore finds, in the absence
of any evidence to the contrary, that no such concerns existed at the time of the Marston Report.
The Tribunal also notes Dr Rigby’s comments that a mine designer would not place a main

haulage road directly underneath an unstable slope.” This also supports the conclusion that

*! Transcript, October 2013, Day 1, 25:7 -9.
* Transcript, October 2013, Day 1, 72:16-22.

182

Marston had no significant concerns about the safety of the northern wall. Aside from the
erroneous factor of safety calculations discussed above, Dr Rigby adduced no evidence to suggest
that safety concerns were discovered by Marston or otherwise after the Marston Report was issued.
Consequently, the Tribunal finds that Claimant’s ramp locations are to be preferred and

accordingly they are adopted for the purpose of calculating damages.

712. On this topic, there are three matters which, for completeness, should be mentioned at this point.
First, as to haulage times, Mr Lambert said that there would be no increase in haulage times using
his ramp design from those used in the Marston Report because the ramps would be about same
length and would exit the pit at same location. In its Joint Expert Procedure Post-Hearing Brief,
Respondent stated that even if this were so, the entry point for the ramp would differ which would
“necessarily result in different haul times, thus requiring adjustments to project plans and
potentially increasing production costs.” However, this assertion was not accompanied by any
attempt at calculating the additional haulage time specific to reaching the entry point of the ramp
(Respondent refers to a difficulty in calculating haulage times to stockpiles given uncertainty of
their location,*™ but this is a separate issue). The Tribunal accepts Mr Lambert’s evidence that the
length and exit points for his proposed ramp were the same as the previous ramps, and notes that
Respondent did not contest this. The Tribunal is not in a position to speculate on whether any
additional haulage time would have been incurred due to a varying entry point and if so what the
cost impact may have been. If Respondent wished to pursue this point it should have offered a
costing calculation and, as it did not, the Tribunal finds that no adjustment is required to the DCF

calculation on account of haulage times relating to ramp location.

713. Secondly, in its Joint Expert Procedure Post-Hearing Brief, Respondent suggested that the
stripping ratio for mining the additional sectors of the pit that would be mined pursuant to
Claimant’s optimal no-layback pit design would be very high at 16:1 (compared to an average
project ratio of 3:1), which would increase costs. This assertion is problematic for two reasons.
First, although this was an issue raised with Mr Lambert during the hearing in relation to the shape

of the mine pit,°° it was referred to be Dr Rigby and Mr Swanson in relation to accessing

183

“additional resources” rather than reserves.’ The Tribunal addresses additional resources
separately below and does not consider that a high stripping ratio generated by accessing resources
(rather than reserves) is of relevance to the more general issues of pit shape. In addition, aside from
asserting that a high stripping ratio would be uneconomic (which was refuted by Mr Lambert’),
once again no calculations have been provided to the Tribunal regarding the effect on the DCF
calculation, assuming a Whittle pit shape. Without costing calculations, the Tribunal is unable to
speculate as to the cost impact of any increased stripping ratio on the DCF calculation, if indeed an

increase would result in relation to reserves (rather than resources).

714. Finally, Dr Rigby suggested at the hearing that retaining the original pit shape was required so
that the Marston figures, which were accurate to a feasibility level (within 15%) could be retained.
He considered that changing the pit shape resulted in a loss of accuracy, such that the figures might
be accurate within 40%, which was not at feasibility study level.” Mr Lambert refuted this,
maintaining that the figures proposed in his expert report were accurate to a feasibility level.
The Tribunal has carefully considered Dr Rigby’s concerns, but is not convinced that this provides
sufficient reason not to adjust the mine plan where it is reasonable to do so. A loss of accuracy
was always inevitable when the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 and requested the experts
to estimate the impact of a no-layback scenario, which clearly entailed deviating from the Marston
figures where required. Claimant has an obligation to meet its burden of proof. As noted earlier,
the Tribunal found Mr Lambert to be more persuasive and there is no basis on which to assert that
a reasoned and well-founded adjustment to the shape of the mine pit would suddenly render

Claimant’s damages calculations speculative.

E. 100 Meter Buffer Zone

Claimant’s Position

715. Mr Lambert’s (RPA) optimal no-layback pit design did not include a buffer zone between the

northern wall of the pit and the northern boundary of the concession.

184

716. The original with-layback pit design had contained a 100 meter buffer zone. Mr Lambert (RPA)
noted that this buffer had been inserted to ensure that there would be no water seepage issues
resulting from the planned water diversion channel in the Las Cristinas concession (as required by
Venezuelan law). However, in April 2008, the planned location for the channel had been moved

north so it necessarily followed that the reason for the buffer was removed.

717. Mr Lambert (RPA) rejected Dr Rigby’s (SRK) assertion that a 100 meter buffer remained
necessary for safety reasons. He submitted that the contemporaneous pit design took account of
the unstable top layer of rock with flatter slopes at the top than at the bottom. Using these
gradients, all of the independent experts who contemporaneously analyzed the design for Claimant
prior to 2008 (Vector, Marston and Micon) had confirmed that the northern wall was sufficiently
stable. Mr Lambert (RPA) used these gradients from the original design in his no-layback

scenario.

718. Regarding safety, all experts agreed that calculating a factor of safety of 1.3 or above would
indicate a stable wall. To do this calculation, Mr Lambert (RPA) requested the assistance of Tetra
Tech (previously Vector Colorado a firm specializing in geochemical and geotechnical analysis
and engineering) to conduct a new safety analysis of the no-layback scenario. Vector Colorado had
conducted the original safety analysis for Claimant. Using Vector’s contemporaneous data taken
from six hard rock boreholes and four saprolite boreholes, as well as geotechnical data gathered
from other drilling holes in the area, Tetra Tech calculated the safety factor of various parts of the
north wall in Mr Lambert’s (RPA) no-layback pit design. The lowest factor of safety recorded was
1.3.

719. Mr Lambert (RPA) rejected Dr Rigby’s (SRK) calculation of much lower factors of safety and
during the hearing Claimant questioned Dr Tinucci, Dr Rigby’s colleague, about apparent errors in
SRK’s factor of safety calculations. Claimant suggested that incorrect data had been entered into
the relevant software program which resulted in a significantly lower safety of factor being
generated. Claimant also suggested that Dr Rigby had over-estimated the depth of the saprolite
and “weak rock” layers at the northern boundary, thereby inferring a less stable wall than would

have existed had the pit been mined.

185

Respondent’s Position

720. Dr Rigby (SRK) asserted that a 100 meter buffer zone between the edge of the northern
boundary and the start of the pit wall was required to ensure safety and guard against slope failure.
This was because the upper portion of the rock face at the northern wall was inherently unstable.
The inclusion of a buffer zone would prevent the pit from encroaching into neighbouring property
in the event of a slope failure. Alternatively, Dr Rigby (SRK) stated that the slope gradient could

be flatter so as to prevent slope failure (both Parties had adopted the Marston slope gradients).

721. Dr Rigby (SRK) performed a factor of safety calculation based on the contemporaneous data
provided by Vector for Claimant’s. He calculated a range of local and global safety factors, the

lowest being a local safety factor of 0.87, well below the required 1.3.

722. Dr Rigby (SRK) stated that the instability at the northern wall was caused by the “saprolite” rock
layer which extended for approximately 225 meter below the surface. It was this upper portion of
the wall for which the “local” factor of safety of 0.87 was calculated. Dr Rigby (SRK) stated that
he had checked his results using the “more robust finite element method” which calculated a safety

factor for the upper portion of the wall of 1.12, still below 1.3.

723. Dr Rigby (SRK) criticised the amount of data available for the northern section of the wall,
stating that fewer boreholes were drilled than would be expected, and data from other drill holes
could not be relied upon. Dr Rigby (SRK) also rejected Tetra Tech’s analysis, suggesting that
Tetra Tech was not independent as it was formally Vector — the company that performed the

original analysis.

724. Due to the alleged paucity of data, Dr Rigby (SRK) made a comparison between the north wall
and the M1 sector of the pit for which more contemporaneous data was available. Dr Rigby (SRK)
considered that the M1 sector most closely resembled the geotechnical nature of the northern wall.
However, Dr Rigby (SRK) acknowledged that this sector had a safety factor of 1.32, which

Claimant noted was still above the required “safe” level (1.3).

725. Dr Rigby (SRK) also made a number of comparisons with other pits, such as the Cleo pit in

Australia where one of the walls collapsed following significant rainfall.

186

Tribunal’s Analysis

726. The original mine plan used by Marston for the with-layback scenario included a 100 meter
buffer zone between the northern wall of the mine pit and the proposed diverted water channel in
the Crystallex project. As the position of the channel had been moved to a more northern location,
both Parties agreed that there was no water seepage issue on April 2008 and, consequently, the

original reason for the buffer zone had disappeared.

727. The experts also agreed that a stability buffer zone is not required by industry standards
generally and therefore it is only needed if there is a specific reason for it in a given scenario, such
as slope stability." Consequently, the central issue to be addressed here is whether or not there
was a specific safety risk in the no-layback scenario which would suggest that a buffer zone was

required.

728. Again, the Tribunal starts from the position that the rational investor would wish to adopt the
mine plan which maximises access to mineral deposits, unless there is a technical, legal or safety
reason which would prevent this. Dr Rigby’s (SRK) inclusion of a buffer zone was based on his
safety analysis which he said demonstrated that the northern wall was unstable and therefore a risk
of slope failure existed. Indeed, with regard to the buffer, the difference in the factor of safety

calculated by the experts appears to be the key issue. The Tribunal therefore addresses that now.

729. The experts agreed that a factor of safety of 1.3 or above is considered stable. In Mr Lambert’s
(RPA) calculation, the lowest factor for any portion of the north wall was 1.3, whereas Dr Rigby
(SRK) calculated a lowest factor of 0.87 (which related specifically to the upper portion of the wall
and was a so-called “local” safety factor). Both Parties relied upon the contemporaneous rock

strength information provided by Vector to Claimant.

730. During the hearing it became evident that some errors had occurred in Respondent’s safety
calculations. In particular, it appears that certain data inputs were entered erroneously resulting
in a significantly lower factor of safety being generated. Dr Tinucci (a colleague of Dr Rigby)

could not explain why the Young’s Modulus figures that had been entered into SRK’s model were

187

incorrect and that, as a result, the “value is probably low”.

Moreover, the Tribunal was not
convinced by Dr Tinucci’s explanation that a typographical error had been made in the heading of
the certain columns, but that the figures were still correct. Due to the fact that the headings
generated by the computer program could not have been changed manually (as Dr Tinucci

acknowled ged

) and the fact that the data inputted corresponded to other data available, the
Tribunal finds that a number of unintentional data entry errors occurred, resulting in an incorrect
calculation. As such, the Tribunal cannot rely on the data presented by Respondent. It therefore

accepts the calculations provided by Claimant which it finds to be robust.

731. The use of Claimant’s data is further compelled by Mr Hallman’s (of Tetra Tech) explanation
that Claimant ran approximately 5,000 tests (including both local and global factors of safety) and

reported the lowest factor of 1.3 in its submissions.°°

732. The only remaining issue is whether the Vector data is sufficient to be able to be relied upon.
The Tribunal considers it is in no position to question this data when it was relied upon in the
original Marston Report which did not question its reliability, nor did the various independent
experts who reviewed that Report at the time. Moreover, the Tribunal accepts Claimant’s
explanation that 10 boreholes (six in hard rock and four in saprolite) together with geotechnical
data gather the from over 800 other drill holes provided sufficient data. Claimant also explained
that Vector had conducted an analysis of Sector I stability but, in line with industry practice, only
included four sectors in its report (which did not include Sector I). As such, the Tribunal finds no

basis on which it should reject calculations that rely on the contemporaneous Vector data.

733. The above findings lead the Tribunal to conclude that the lowest factor of safety applicable at the
North wall was 1.3 and that therefore there is no safety reason for including a buffer zone at the
Northern boundary. The Tribunal will accordingly calculate fair market value using the zero buffer

scenario.

734. Before leaving this topic, the Tribunal recalls the question put by Professor Dupuy to the experts
during the confrontation at the hearing in relation to the effect of climate and specifically of heavy

rainfall on the safety of the northern wall.°° It is evident that heavy rainfall may have had a

considerable effect on the stability of the saprolite material in the upper portion of the northern
wall. However, the Tribunal is satisfied that RPA has taken adequate account of this in its pit
design and that the contemporaneous testing provided was satisfactory. In particular, the Tribunal
considers that it is unable to ignore the site-specific testing done for the Brisas Project on the basis
of the experience at the Cleo pit in Australia cited by Respondent. The Tribunal does not have
sufficient information to satisfy itself that the conditions and the design at the Cleo pit were so
similar that it could reasonably equate the two mines, nor of the specific climatic circumstances
that occurred to cause to slope failure and whether they could reasonably be expected to be
replicated. There are simply too many uncertainties involved in such a comparison. The Tribunal
finds it appropriate to rely on the test results at the Brisas mine, especially given that no clear

evidence has been provided that such tests were deficient or failed to reach industry standards.

F. Stockpiles

735. In the no-layback scenario, the Parties agreed that hard rock stockpiles not included in the
original mine plan would be needed which would then be blended to ensure a more consistent
copper head grade was fed into the processing plant. The experts disagreed on a number of issues
regarding these stockpiles including size, location, management, costs, environmental impacts and

the effect of oxidation.
Claimant’s Position

736. Mr Lambert (RPA) proposed the use of large blending stockpiles (one for low grade and one for
high grade ore) in order to smooth out fluctuations in the head grade ore being fed into the
processing plant. Large variability in the copper grade of ore would affect mill performance and
the quality of the product and blending would help to counter this. As such, blending would assist
in maintaining the average copper head grade in a no-layback scenario (with no buffer zone) of
0.10%. This would be lower than the average copper head grade predicted in the with-layback

scenario but, Mr Lambert (RPA) explained, it would be within acceptable limits.
737. Mr Lambert (RPA) proposed the use of two stockpiles which would have a combined capacity

of up to 68 million tonnes and would reach a maximum height of 96 meters each. Mr Lambert

(RPA) claimed that this size was not unusual and that the use of temporary stockpiles such as these

189

were standard industry practice. One stockpile would be for low grade ore (0.02-0.03%) and the

other for higher grade ore.

738. Mr Lambert (RPA) contended that the preferable location for the stockpiles would be on the
NLSAV1 parcel where saprolite stockpiles were already planned. Mr Lambert (RPA) suggested
replacing the saprolite stockpiles (which would be depleted in the early years of the Project) with
hard rock stockpiles which would only be needed several years into the project. This location
option was based on an estimated maximum height for the stockpiles of 96 meters, which Mr
Lambert (RPA) said was lower than the waste rock stockpiles already included in the Marston
mine plan. Alternatively, if more space were required as per Respondent’s argument below, space

would be available north of the waste rock dump (Esperanza parcel).

739. Claimant said that the additional costs involved in establishing and managing these stockpiles
would be minimal, noting that the main cost would be in supplying some additional haulage trucks
and loaders. On this basis, Claimant’s financial experts, Mr Kaczmarek (Navigant), included an
additional $53 million in capital for the stockpile expenditure - $20 million for new equipment and

$33 million for replacement capital expenditure over the life of the mine.

740. Regarding mining costs, Mr Lambert (RPA) estimated that the use of the stockpiles would result
in a 1% increase in mining costs, but that the increased mining rate would yield a 2% decrease in
costs. Because these figures essentially cancelled each other out, Mr Lambert (RPA) made no
adjustments to Marston figures. In response to criticism that the mining rate departed too far from
the original Marston figures, Mr Lambert (RPA) noted that Respondent’s mining rate (as predicted
by the production schedules) was even higher. Mr Lambert (RPA) also emphasized that only 17%
of the hard rock would be stockpiled and therefore averred that the change to the mine plan was

not as significant as Respondent was suggesting.

741. Regarding environmental impacts, Mr Lambert (RPA) contended that testing done for the V-
ESIA showed that there was little potential for generating acid rock drainage or for deteriorating
copper concentrate. In particular, the high carbonate component in the rock would neutralize acid
and effectively create a buffer against leakage. He also said that waste rock and saprolite
stockpiles were included in the original mine plan, so environmental concerns had already been
addressed. In particular, Mr Lambert (RPA) noted that water treatment equipment had already

been factored into the original mine plan at the site where stockpiles were planned. He also

190

highlighted that contemporaneous assessments concluded that no geomembrane liner was required
for the other stockpiles, as the compacting of the saprolite rock by trucks/diggers preparing the site

would create an effective liner that would prevent any acid leaching.

742. Mr Lambert (RPA) also dismissed oxidation concerns. He cited tests which showed that over
the course of two years there was very little oxidation of the copper content in stockpiled ore. He
also emphasized that (i) the stockpile would be composed primarily of large pieces of rock
minimizing surface exposure of the ore; (ii) the high stockpiles in its optimal design would also
minimize such exposure; and (iii) the hard rock has low permeability. Therefore, oxidation (if
any) would be negligible. Finally, Mr Lambert (RPA) noted that evidence of potential oxidation
referred to by Respondent’s experts was based on crushed ore stockpiles which would inevitably
be more susceptible to oxidation. It also pertained to a different type of rock and was based on
much wetter conditions than would be the case with the proposed stockpiles. At the hearing, Mr
Lambert gave evidence regarding the location and management of the stockpiles and Mr

Henderson (from Tetra Tech) gave evidence regarding environmental issues.

Respondent’s Position

743. Dr Rigby (SRK) submitted that the inclusion of new large hard rock stockpiles introduced
speculation into the valuation and were a significant change. He criticized Mr Lambert (RPA) for
failing to provide sufficient detail as to the management and operation of these stockpiles. In
particular, Dr Rigby (SRK) considered that Mr Lambert (RPA) had insufficiently addressed the
costs and management issues surrounding the stockpiles, and had simply assumed that everything

in the stockpile could be accessed and used.

744. Dr Brown and Mr Kowal (CRA) acknowledged that stockpiles were possible, but that “it
requires very close control and coordination of both mining and stockpile construction and
management operations to be efficient and effective.”©”’ Dr Rigby (SRK) stated that to ensure an
average head grade of 0.10%, rock within each stockpile would need to be classified into high/low
grades. Respondent’s experts proposed a design for the stockpile that they contended would
ensure this access and would segregate incoming ore into recordable areas so that operators could

select the exact grade of ore required for blending.

7 Joint Expert Procedure Rebuttal Report of Dr Brown & Dr Kowal dated 3 July 2013 (hereinafter “Brown &
Kowal II (Joint Expert Procedure)”, para. 76.

191

745. Respondent’s experts contended that lower stockpiles were necessary because (i) the
practicalities of managing the blending process meant that the ore needs to be accessible at all
times; and (ii) it had load-bearing concerns regarding the saprolite rock. Lower stockpiles with a
maximum height of 10 meter were advocated by Respondent, although this would require

significantly more area. Dr Rigby (SRK) estimated approximately 300 hectares would be required.

746. Regarding Mr Lambert’s (RPA) suggestion that the hard rock stockpiles could replace the
saprolite stockpiles (already included in the original mine plan) over time, Dr Brown and Mr
Kowal (CRA) said that this was not possible. They concluded that the hard rock stockpiles could
not effectively be sequenced to utilize space vacated by saprolite stockpiles, as they would need to
be built up faster than the saprolite stockpiles would be depleted. Respondent’s experts said that
Mr Lambert (RPA) was wrong to suggest that hard rock stockpiling would begin several years into
production; rather Claimant would need to blend north and south rock from early years of the

Project to ensure a copper head-grade of 0.10%.

747. Dr Rigby (SRK) noted that the alternative locations suggested by Mr Lambert (RPA) would
significantly increase the haulage times for mined rock, which would have implications for
operational costs. Mr Lambert (RPA) used the cycle times in the original Marston Report, but Dr
Rigby (SRK) said that these would be inapplicable for many of the suggested stockpile locations.
Dr Burrows (CRA) instead estimated costs based on an 18 minute cycle time, rather than the 7

minute cycle time used by Mr Kaczmarek (Navigant).

748. In relation to environmental impacts, Dr Rigby (SRK) contended that the testwork undertaken by
Claimant was insufficient and inadequate to support its conclusion that acid rock drainage/metal
leaching would not occur. It remained an environmental risk to the project and therefore a
geomembrane liner should be inserted, as well as a collection system for any water seepage
through the stockpiles into the underlying rock and a treatment plant for such water if it were

acidic.

749. Dr Brown and Mr Kowal (CRA) also contended that oxidation may be an issue in the stockpiles,
which would deplete the copper content that is recoverable from the ore. They estimated that the
ore would be in stockpiles for up to 6.75 years (depending on procedure adopted for managing the

stockpile), and therefore Mr Lambert (RPA) could not rely on two year tests undertaken

192

contemporaneously. Respondent did not state definitively that oxidation would in fact occur,
rather that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that it would not occur — and that no proper

verification was done.°*

750. Regarding the costs involved in introducing such stockpiles, Dr Burrows (CRA) said that many

751.

of the management costs were not “hard coded” as Claimant had assumed, but would increase with
the volume of rock mined, transported and stockpiled. This meant that, in most years, costs would
increase from the original layback design. Dr Burrows (CRA) also noted that Claimant had kept
most costs the same for the no-layback scenario as for the with-layback scenario which he
concluded “makes no sense. The two mine plans are very different”.? He calculated that
stockpile costs (including the geomembrane liner and additional haulage time) would reduce Mr
Lambert’s (RPA) DCF valuation by $107 million.°'? Dr Burrows (CRA) noted that the

611

geomembrane liner would be a “big item’ within this cost, however no precise break-down was

provided. The Tribunal also understands this figure to include contingency and indirect costs.°!?

Tribunal’s Analysis

It is evident that the use of hard rock stockpiles for blending purposes is not uncommon and that
both Parties agree that they could, and should, be used as part of a no-layback mine plan to smooth

out fluctuating copper grades.

752. The Tribunal found the oral evidence provided at the hearing and the Parties’ post-hearing briefs

useful in distilling the key areas of difference between experts. It appears to the Tribunal that there
are two key issues that need to be addressed initially, with a number of more minor issues to
consider thereafter. The first of these key issues concerns the purpose of the blending process
itself. This in turn will determine the size and management of the stockpiles. The second issue

concerns the environmental effects on the ore as a result of exposure to air and rain.

6! Joint Expert Procedure Second Supplemental Report of Mr Kaczmarek dated 3 July 2013 (hereinafter

“Kaczmarek II (Joint Expert Procedure)”), para. 81.

193

753. Turning to the first issue, Claimant contended that only blending would be required to smooth
out, but not eliminate, the fluctuations in head grade. Respondent considers that to consistently
produce a head grade of 0.10 copper more precise blending is required. For the rough blending
advocated by Claimant, two large stockpiles — one containing low grade ore and one containing
high grade ore — would be sufficient. Whereas, for more precise blending, it is evident that greater
access to ore would be required, hence Respondent’s preferred plan of 10 meter high stockpiles

where ore could be separated according to the specific grade of copper contained therein.

754. The first point that the Tribunal notes is that Mr Lambert stated at the hearing that the low-grade
stockpile would have very little variation and would contain 0.02-0.03% copper. Respondent did
not challenge this at the hearing or in its Joint Expert Procedure Post-Hearing Brief. Indeed, it
seemed to recognize this when it stated “Mr Lambert acknowledges that there will be variations in
grade, especially in the higher grade pile.. 7613

755. As a result, subject to safety concerns addressed below, the Tribunal considers that whether or
not rough blending or more precise blending is required, it is clear that the low-grade stockpile
could be of a larger size and would not need to be spread into 10 meter high piles for the purpose

of accessing ore.

756. Regarding the high-grade stockpiles, the Tribunal accepts Claimant’s explanation that, unlike
gold blending, where precision is important, there would be no need for such precision for copper
blending. As such, the aim of the blending is to avoid extreme fluctuations, rather than to
eliminate fluctuations altogether to ensure that a constant head grade is consistently fed into the
mill. Respondent has not provided any evidence or explanation as to why precise blending would

be necessary for copper, as the examples it used as comparables related to gold blending only.

757. Nonetheless, even Claimant seems to have acknowledged it would be preferable to have slightly
more precise blending than can be delivered by two large stockpiles in which ore is simply placed
anywhere. At the very least, as Mr Lambert said, regarding “the higher grade stockpile, you may
put in three or four areas that have a slight variation in grade.”°'* This suggests that two large

stockpiles in which ore is placed indiscriminately within each pile would not work in the case of

°'3 Respondent’s Joint Expert Procedure Post-Hearing Brief, para. 25.

°' Transcript, October 2013, Day 1, 170:21-24.

194

the high grade ore. This would lead credence to the argument that slightly flatter, or a few more,

stockpiles are required.

758. Overall, the Tribunal finds that Claimant’s mine plan that includes larger stockpiles is credible
and should be preferred. However, as noted above, the high grade pile may need to be spread over
a slightly larger area than initially anticipated so to allow for the separation of ore into three or four
areas. The impacts of this in terms of costs and location of the stockpiles are discussed further

below.

759. For completion, the Tribunal notes that it is satisfied that there would be no stability issues with
locating the stockpiles of the saprolite surface, as similar height stockpiles for waste rock were

already included in the original mine plan.

760. The only remaining issue with regard to the height of the stockpiles is whether safety concerns
dictate that smaller piles are required. Respondent contended that 96 meter high stockpiles would
pose a risk to those working at their base. However, this concern appeared more relevant where
precise blending was required, as attempting to select ore buried deep within such a high pile
would no doubt create issues. Claimant provided a number of examples of other stockpiles which
had a similar height to those proposed here, including stockpiles that would be depleted over the
life of the mine. Given that it does not seem unusual to build stockpiles of this height, and in a
scenario where the selection of precise ore grades from within the piles is not necessary, the

Tribunal finds no evidence that safety would require stockpiles to be limited to 10 meter in height.

761. Regarding management costs, the Tribunal is sympathetic to Respondent’s concerns that
Claimant’s experts have not fully considered the detail of the management or operation of the
stockpiles. Mr Lambert himself said during the hearing that the Tribunal only asked the experts to

1.°'° While it is true that the Tribunal asked

“estimate” and therefore he had not gone into the detail
the experts to “estimate” design changes in a no-layback scenario, Claimant still has a burden of
proof to satisfy. Because of the limited analysis of the detail of the stockpiles undertaken by
Claimant’s experts, the Tribunal considers that the costs of operating such stockpiles could indeed

be higher than Claimant suggests.

762. The Tribunal has studied the Parties and expert submissions in detail with regard to the costs of

managing stockpiles. It considers that the suggested deduction by Dr Burrows of $107 million is
°'5 Transcript, October 2013, Day 1, 196:4-8.

195

too high, especially as it includes environmental issues.°'® It also included contingency costs.
However, as noted above, the Tribunal considers that Mr Lambert’s estimate of an additional $52
million in capital costs may not be sufficient to cover all costs associated with the stockpiles. On
balance, looking at the issue overall, the Tribunal finds that a deduction of US$ 80 million from
Claimant’s DCF calculation would be fair and reasonable, taking into account any need to store
higher grade ore in three of four different areas and general costs that will likely arise in

establishing and managing such stockpiles.

763. This deduction would also take account of any increase in haulage time required if Claimant’s
preferred stockpile location is not possible. As with the consideration of management costs, the
Tribunal finds that Claimant’s experts have not sufficiently analyzed whether the saprolite
stockpiles could actually be depleted at a rate that would allow the hard rock stockpiles to replace
them. The Tribunal has built in the additional costs in paragraph 848 below to allow for extra

haulage time if another location is required.
Environmental concerns

764. The Tribunal now considers the second key issue regarding stockpiles: the potential for Acid
Rock Drainage (“ARD”) and oxidation of the ore. Claimant asserts that ore will be in the
stockpiles for approximately three years, while Respondent considered that it could there for up to

six years.

765. Based on contemporaneous testing, RPA asserted that neither ARD nor oxidation is of
significant concern. In particular, Mr Henderson noted that the carbonate levels in the rock would
ensure that any acidity is countered so to keep the pH neutral, and Dr Rigby acknowledged this

buffering potential.°"”

It also seems to be accepted that much of the rock in the temporary
stockpiles would be in the form of large boulders, rather than crushed ore making it less
susceptible to ARD or oxidation. The minimal risk indicated by the contemporaneous testing,
even if over a shorter period than the ore would be stored for on either Claimant’s or Respondent’s
estimates, is persuasive. The Tribunal finds that it has no evidence before it to suggest that ARD

or oxidation would be in issue and, indeed, all evidence points to the contrary.

°l6 Transcript, October 2013, Day 2, 217:5 (see also Transcript, October 2013, Day 1, 163:13-15 where Mr
Henderson said “I think the additional costs, as I recall, were mostly related to the aerial extent and the desire for
geomembrane liners.”)

°!7 Transcript, October 2013, Day 1, 172:16-173:12 and 178:2-8 (Henderson) and 186:15-17 (Rigby).

196

766. This conclusion is not at odds with Respondent’s position: Dr Rigby was careful to clarify at the
hearing that his position was not that the ore would oxidise, rather that it “might” and that he did
not consider he had enough evidence to state that it would not.°!8 Respondent’s concern was that
the contemporaneous testing did not mirror the exact time period or conditions that would exist in
the stockpiles and therefore one could not be sure that such environmental hazards would not
occur. This may be true, but given that all the evidence suggests that the risk of ARD or oxidation
is very low, the Tribunal is satisfied that no additional cost needs to be built into the valuation to
allow for the building to geomembrane liners etc. or that the recoverability of metal would be
significantly lowered by oxidation. The Tribunal notes that any evidence that did suggest that
environmental concerns may exist was based on crushed ore studies and is therefore not
sufficiently analogous to the present situation in which larger portions of rock would

predominantly be stored.

G. Delay

Parties’ Positions

767. Respondent incorporated into its DCF calculation a two year delay to allow for obtaining new
permits and undertake any further feasibility studies associated with a no-layback scenario, and in

particular with the hard rock stockpiles.

768. Claimant disagreed with incorporating time to get additional permits. Its position was that the
Parties should assess the no-layback scenario as if it had always been the preferred option — i.e., an
alternative, hypothetical world.*? It also stated that, even if some delay may have occurred,

Respondent had not provided any rationale to explain why a two year period is appropriate.

769. Claimant’s valuation expert, Mr Kaczmarek (Navigant), stated that the two year delay has a
significant financial impact, being worth $221 million. Mr Burrows (CRA) calculated that this

would be $217 million, if additional resources were excluded.

°'8 Transcript, October 2013, Day 1, 185:24-186:2.

© Claimant’s Comments on Reports of the Experts Submitted in Response to Procedural Order No. 2, dated August
5, 2013, para. 149.

197

Tribunal’s Analysis

770. The issue of delay is important due to its financial impact. Claimant noted that “[d]ue to the
significant impact on a DCF measure of value of reducing early revenues, this ... assumption
represents the largest difference between the experts’ valuations specific to the no-layback

scenario”.©°

771. Given the delays that had occurred in the Project prior to 2008 in relation to the granting of
permits and the approval of feasibility and environmental studies, it is reasonable to factor in some
time allowance for relevant approvals. The Tribunal does not agree with Claimant that the
valuation should be assessed as an “alternative world” scenario, as if the no-layback plan had
always been in place. The task of the experts was to value the Brisas Project as it was at April
2008. As no lay-back agreement was in place and Claimant had no legal right to use the North
Parcel, this must be factored into the valuation. It would therefore be reasonable to assume that

some additional approvals would have been required to implement the no-layback design.

772. The Tribunal is not, however, convinced that a two year delay is necessary. In the Tribunal’s
view, the changes to the mine plan, while important, are not so significant that they would have
required extensive additional work in order to be approved. The Tribunal therefore finds that a one
year delay is reasonable and will take this into account in its calculations. Consequently, the
Tribunal shall deduct US$ 108,500,000 from the DCF calculation (being half of Dr Burrows’
estimated cost of a two year delay). The Tribunal notes that the experts agreed that, although it is
only an approximation of the financial impact, this figure would be roughly correct for a one year

delay.!

H. Impact on Resources

773. The Parties and their experts agreed that “mineral reserve” is a defined term that identifies
proven and probable resources that are demonstrated to be economic to extract. “Mineral
resources” are made up of the “measured and indicated” and “inferred” resources that may become
profitable to mine in the future if metals prices were to increase. Mineral reserves are said to be

more geologically certain, with “inferred resources” being the least geologically certain.

©! Transcript, October 2013, Day 2, 225:13-17.

198

Parties’ Positions

774. Mr Lambert (RPA) calculated that the optimal no-layback design would result in mineral
reserves would be 9.087 million ounces of gold and 985 million pounds of copper. This
represented a reduction of reserves by approximately 11% in the case of gold and 29% in the case

of copper, as compared to a with-layback scenario.

775. In its Joint Expert Procedure Post-Hearing Brief, Respondent stated that:

“There is no disagreement as to this process, and both experts
discussed at the hearing how mineral resources undergo a technical
process, through which they are converted to become reserves with
demonstrated economic value. And although there is disagreement as
to the amount of gold and copper ore reserves that will be lost under
the no-layback scenario, there is general agreement that this is due to
the different mine design plans.”°”?

776. Mr Lambert (RPA) also estimated “additional resources” using prices of US$ 800/oz gold and
US$ 3.25/lb copper to be 3,384,356 ounces of gold and 473,184,949 pounds of copper. Dr Rigby
(SRK) disputes the inclusion of additional resources in any valuation, stating that by definition
such resources would have been uneconomic to mine as at April 2008 unless metals prices
significantly changed. Respondent argues that these resources are speculative and would not be

included in securities filings such as the NI 43-101.

Tribunal’s Analysis

771. As indicated by Respondent’s Joint Expert Procedure Post-Hearing Brief quoted above, and by

the discussion between the experts at the hearing,

the experts agreed upon the definition and
process for measuring reserves and resources. The fundamental differences came down to pit
shape/location (which has already been addressed by the Tribunal) and whether additional
resources were to be included. Dr Rigby stated at the hearing that he accepted the estimate
provided by Mr Lambert for Claimant’s “optimal” zero buffer scenario.°* Because the Tribunal
has determined that no buffer is required and has therefore adopted Claimant’s preferred mine

199

design, the mineral reserves estimate provided by Mr Lambert (RPA) should be used when
calculating fair market value. That is, mineral reserves are estimated to be 9.087 million ounces of

gold and 985 million pounds of copper.”

778. In relation to additional resources, the Tribunal understands that additional resources can and
often are reported for different purposes and, in some scenarios, might be ascribed value.
However, for other purposes and reports, such as the NI 43-101 Technical Report filed by

Claimant with the Toronto Stock Exchange, no value is ascribed to additional resources.

779. Mr Lambert (RPA) concluded that certain additional resources may become economic to mine
at a metals price of US$ 800/oz gold and US$ 3.25/lb copper — it is at this point that they may have

value. The Tribunal understands that it is industry practice to estimate resources at a higher price.

780. However, the Tribunal must consider what the value that a willing buyer would have been likely
to ascribe to such resources as at April 2008. Given that, as described by Respondent, these

6 and that the Canadian Institute of

resources have the “lowest level of geological confidence’
Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum on Valuation of Mineral Properties (“CIMVal”) Guidelines, to
which Claimant refers, acknowledges the “higher risk or uncertainty” associated with these
resources and cautions that they should only be used with great care, the Tribunal finds the
additional resources to be too speculative to include in the present valuation. The Tribunal
concludes in this case that for the purposes of a fair market valuation, it will not ascribe any value

to the additional resources in its calculations.

781. The Tribunal also finds that the valuation should not include silver resources. As noted by Mr
Kaczmarek (Navigant), “Gold Reserve applied for concession rights to exploit silver, but the

Ministry of Mines never acted on this application”®”

and Gold Reserve itself acknowledged silver
was not covered by the corresponding mining titles. No evidence has been presented of any
inferred right to mine silver and therefore any value ascribed to this metal would be on the

speculative basis that such a right be granted in the future. The Tribunal does not find this

convincing and considers that no value should be ascribed to any silver reserves in the DCF

valuation.

782. Consequently, the Tribunal shall reduce Claimant’s DCF valuation by US$ 31 million®* to
account for silver included in Claimant’s valuation and by a further US$ 162 million”? to amount

for additional resources included in Claimant’s valuation.°°

I. Metallurgical Issues

783. A number of metallurgical issues were raised by the Parties as impacting on the valuation. The
most important of these issues involved the processing plant performance and the resulting metal
recovery rates and concentrate grades. Before addressing this significant issue, the Tribunal

considers two more minor issues — ramp up rates and mill capacity.

784. The Tribunal heard evidence at the October 2013 hearing on metallurgical issues from Dr
Altman (RPA) and Mr Spiller (Tetra Tech) on behalf of Claimant and from Dr Brown (CRA) on
behalf of Respondent. The Tribunal found Dr Brown’s evidence to be particularly convincing and

helpful in the determination of these very technical issues.

J. Ramp-up Rates

785. Ramp-up refers to the time it takes for the processing plant to “ramp-up” to its full capacity. This
is not an issue specific to a no-layback scenario, but was addressed by the experts in the Joint

Expert Procedure reports and therefore the issue is addressed here by the Tribunal.

Claimant’s Position

786. Mr Lambert (RPA) stated that he used the ramp-up figures from the Marston Report of 2008 in
both the with-layback and no-layback scenarios. This Report determined that the plant would

operate at 87.5% of capacity in the first year, made up of 60% capacity in first quarter, rising to

8 Burrows II (Joint Expert Procedure), para. 48 and Table 1, p. 19.

© Figures taken from Kaczmarek II (Joint Expert Procedure), para. 58.

201

90% in second and full capacity after that. Micon had independently verified the Marston figures

at the relevant time.

787. Mr Lambert (RPA) criticized Dr Rigby’s (SRK) use of comparisons with other mining projects,

stating that they used “selective and skewed sampling” 631

which were not truly comparable with
the Brisas Project. Mr Lambert (RPA) also countered that many of those mines actually performed
better than anticipated, and ended up with ramp-up rates higher than 87.5%. Mr Lambert (RPA)
also submitted that the calculations used by Dr Rigby (SRK) to estimate ramp-up were

: 2
incorrect.°
Respondent’s Position

788. Dr Rigby (SRK) submitted that the ramp-up figures in the Marston Report, and used by Mr
Lambert (RPA), were too high. It used other “comparable” processing plants to demonstrate that
the figures should be lower and stated that the resultant lower predicted income in the early years
would impact the DCF valuation. However, Dr Burrows (CRA) said that modeling the impact of
slower ramp-up times is very complex, so to be conservative, he did not include any adjustment to

the DCF to account for slower ramp-up times.°
Tribunal’s Analysis

789. As Respondent did not include any financial impact for slower ramp-up rates in its DCF
adjustments, the Tribunal understands that this is not an issue that will affect any damages to be
awarded hereunder. It is also not an issue on which the Parties concentrated at the hearing or in

their Post-Hearing Briefs. As such, the Tribunal will only address this issue briefly.

790. The Tribunal is persuaded by Claimant’s evidence that the comparable processing plants referred
to by Dr Rigby (SRK) are not sufficiently reliable to conclude that a move away from the Marston
figures is warranted. The Tribunal is also persuaded that Mr Lambert’s use of the Marston ramp-
up rates is the correct approach in the present case. Moreover, the Tribunal accepts Mr Lambert’s
submission that Dr Rigby (SRK) made crucial errors in his ramp-up calculations which prevents

the Tribunal from placing any weight on the conclusions which might otherwise be drawn from

Expert Procedure)”), paras. 136 and 153.

those calculations. The Tribunal notes that, as this is not an issue that is affected by the no-layback
scenario, strong evidence would be required for the Tribunal to depart from the figures adopted in
the Marston Report, as approved and reviewed by Micon and Pincock, Allen & Holt, and on which
the Parties have frequently placed reliance in other areas. Given no such evidence exists, the
Tribunal finds that the ramp-up rates in the Marston Report should be applied in a fair market

valuation.

K. Mill Capacity

Parties’ Positions

791. Respondent’s experts submitted that the processing mill had a processing capacity of 25.2
million tonnes of ore per year. Claimant’s expert said that this estimated capacity was for the
“SNC Lavalin” mill design in 2006, but the mill was subsequently redesigned so that its processing
capacity increased to 27 metric tons of ore in early years and up to 29.2 metric tons later for the
Brisas Project. In particular, Mr Lambert (RPA) said that he used Marston’s contemporaneous
mill capacity data, which was independently verified at the time by Pincock Allan & Holt and

Micon.

Tribunal’s Analysis

792. The Tribunal notes once again that this is not an issue specific to the no-layback scenario.
Therefore, as with the ramp-up issue above, the Tribunal finds that the figures used in the Marston
Report should apply, unless convincing evidence to the contrary is provided. No such evidence
exists in the present case and therefore the Marston figures should apply as per Claimant’s
analysis. The Tribunal accepts that the processing capacity changed and therefore using the

original figures from the SNC Lavalin mill would not be appropriate.

L. Metal Recovery Rates and Concentrate Grades

793. This is the central issue regarding the metallurgical analysis. The grade of the gold-copper
concentrate coming out of the processing plant is dependent upon (i) the plant’s average metal
recovery rate; and (ii) the “mass” recovery, referring to the density of the recovered concentrate.

Density depends on how successful the plant is at separating waste rock from valuable metal.

203

794. Contemporaneous testing in 2008 for the with-layback scenario predicted that, with an assumed
0.10% copper head-grade:

(a) the average copper concentrate grade would be 24%;
(b) the average metal recovery rate would be 87.4% for copper and 83.2% for gold; and
(c) the average mass recovery would be 0.36%.

795. These results were based on a number of tests carried out by Gold Reserve before the dispute
arose. The most reliable of these tests for the purposes of recovery rates were the Locked-Cycle
Tests (“LCTs’), of which eight were performed (although only seven were relevant to the issues
discussed here). Both experts accepted the accuracy of the LCTs, although Respondent disputed

whether a sufficient number of LCTs had been carried out so as to produce reliable data.

796. The experts agreed that the head grade of the ore fed into the plant in a no-layback scenario is
likely on average to be lower than in the with-layback scenario. The experts agreed that the mill
itself would be able to handle lower head grade ore. The fundamental disagreement appears to be

how this would then affect mill performance.

Claimant’s Position

797. Mr Lambert (RPA) contended that the contemporaneous test results could still be applied to the
no-layback scenario to predict metal recovery rates because, although in some years the average
copper head-grade would be below 0.1%, there was nothing to indicate that the metal recovery rate
would materially reduce with the slightly expanded range of copper head-grade expected in a no-
layback scenario. Moreover, Mr Lambert (RPA) suggested that the mineralogy of the deposit was
more important than the head grade when considering mill performance. This would not change in

the no-layback scenario and the type of ore is easy to process.

798. According to Claimant, LCT No. 8 most closely reflected the process to be adopted for the
processing plant. Although the LCTs were used as the primary basis to design the processing plant
and determining average metal recovery rate, Claimant suggested that a certain amount of
professional judgment was also used in the design which should in turn be used when assessing the

impact of the no-layback scenario.

204

799. The contemporaneous data was based on an assumed head grade feed range of 0.083% - 0.176%
(with average grade of 0.131%). RPA contended that in its optimal no buffer scenario the head
grade feed range would be between 0.075% - 0.182%, with an overall average of 0.1%. It was
therefore not substantially different from the head grade range predicted in a with-layback scenario
and therefore the contemporaneous testing could be relied upon to predict metal recovery rates.
Accordingly, Mr Lambert (RPA) predicted that the average copper recovery rate in the no-layback
scenario (assuming 0 meter buffer) would be the same as for the with-layback scenario tested
contemporaneously — 87.4% for copper and 83.2% of gold. He said that only in the 100 meter

buffer zone scenario would the contemporaneous testing become unreliable.

800. Mr Lambert (RPA) also stressed that the processing plant had sufficient flexibility to cope with
slightly lower head grades and only significantly lower head grades would likely reduce recovery
rates. This was also consistent with the fact that the LCTs did not show a significant correlation
between head grade and metal recovery, with some lower head grades producing high metal

recoveries.

801. While contemporaneous data could be used to estimate metal recovery rate, this is not so for the
average concentrate grade of the copper that would result from different head grades below 0.1%.
For the years in which the head grade is 0.1% or above, Mr Lambert (RPA) said that the average of
24% copper concentrate used in the contemporaneous testing was appropriate. In years when the
average head grade falls below 0.1%, the anticipated concentrate was based on the “definitional
relationship between concentrate grade, metal recovery, head grade and mass recovery and the

processing plant design criteria.”°*

More specifically, Mr Lambert (RPA) used an equation
whereby the concentrate grade is equal to the (head grade x metal recovery rate) / mass recovery.
Claimant contended that this equation is more accurate than relying on the “assumed” concentrate
grade used in the testing. Using the equation, Mr Lambert (RPA) predicted concentrates of

between 18-22% for 10 years of the project’s life and above 22% for 7 years.

802. In relation to Dr Brown and Mr Kowal’s (CRA) analysis, Mr Lambert (RPA) contended that
they had used test data inappropriately and consequently that their analysis generated flawed and
unrealizable results. This was because the model chosen required more data points than were

available from the LCTs. In particular, Respondent’s model used tests that were conducted for

4 Claimant’ s Joint Expert Procedure Post-Hearing Brief, para. 83.

205

other purposes and under different conditions than would exist in the processing plant as designed.
Therefore, the tests also involved samples that were unrepresentative of the general ore content put
through the processing plant. Mr Lambert (RPA) said that the LCTs are the best indicator and that

one should use only these tests when analyzing metal recovery rates.

803. Mr Lambert (RPA) and Mr Kaczmarek (Navigant) stated that this issue was worth US$ 175

million.

Respondent’s Position

804. Dr Brown and Mr Kowal (CRA) used a “non-linear exponential” model to predict metal
recovery rates and concentrate grades. They too relied on contemporaneous data in their model,
but from a wider range of tests than just the LCTs. They opined that this wider range of data
points demonstrated that metal recovery rates fell as the head grade fell and that this reflected
standard expectation in the industry. Using this model, Dr Brown and Mr Kowal (CRA) predicted
copper concentrate grades of between approximately 15-23% in the no buffer scenario (i.e.,

Claimant’s optimal scenario).

805. Dr Brown and Mr Kowal (CRA) noted that for recovery of gold, test data at pilot plant for the
Brisas Project Feasibility Study showed differing gold recovery results from that used by Mr
Lambert (RPA). Hence, they said that Mr Lambert (RPA) had overestimated gold recovery,

making the concentrate appear more valuable than it would have been in reality.

806. Dr Brown and Mr Kowal (CRA) criticised Mr Lambert’s (RPA) analysis as overly-simplistic
and based on too many assumptions to be reliable. They said that the assumption that the
concentrate grade would be 24% at head grades above 0.1% is not consistent with other available
information which would suggest the head grade would need to be at least 0.15% to produce a
24% concentrate. Micon reported that material from the North (high copper) and the South (low
copper) should be blended to produce concentrate 24% from ore containing 0.13-0.15% copper.
Dr Brown and Mr Kowal (CRA) pointed out that other documents say marketable concentrates
could not be produced from head grade under 0.1% - this would be lower limit and that the LCT
tests at head grades of 0.12-0.13% show percentage recovery at 16-21%. They said that the LCTs
were all based on higher copper grades and it is speculative to apply them to mill performance for

lower copper grades.

206

Tribunal’s Analysis

807. This area is both technical and complex and has been the subject of significant disagreement
between the experts. The Tribunal understands the Parties to agree that the processing plant
performance depends on the range of copper grades fed into the mill and that this range will be
lower in the no-layback scenario than it would have been with a layback. The dispute between the
experts concerns first the percentage that the head grade would drop and secondly the impact that

this drop would have on metal recovery rates.°°

808. The experts appeared to agree that the mill as designed would be capable of processing the ore at
lower head grades. It is the performance of the mill in terms of metal recoveries and concentrates
that is at issue. Claimant’s basic position was that the both the average head grade of the ore and
the range of head grade to be fed into the mill — while lower than the with-layback scenario — is not
so significantly lower to affect mill performance. Therefore the data obtained in the LCTs can be
reasonably relied upon to predict performance. Respondent’s position is that the head grade of the
ore would be “significantly lower” and therefore a mathematical model should be used to
extrapolate from the available test data what mill performance would be at these lower head

grades.

809. The Tribunal notes that both Parties accepted the accuracy of the tests performed by SGS
Lakefield, as reported in the Marston Report and reviewed by Micon, Pincock Allan & Holt and
SNC Lavalin. However, Respondent’s experts considered that insufficient LCT data was available
for lower head grades to confidently predict mill performance. This is especially so, claimed
Respondent, because the head grade of ore fed into the mill would be below an average of 0.10%

in the first 13 years of the life of the mine.

810. The importance of using the contemporaneous data wherever possible is undisputed, as is the
fact that the LCTs provided the most reliable indication of mill performance. However, given that
the LCTs did not provide sufficient data to run a statistical model for estimating performance in
the no-layback scenario, the Tribunal considers it both practical and preferable to use the next best

data available — that generated by other tests including batch flotation tests and pilot plant data.

5 Claimant's Joint Expert Procedure Post-Hearing Brief, para. 80; Respondent’s Joint Expert Procedure Post-
Hearing Brief, para. 38.

207

The Tribunal prefers such a statistical analysis over the use of “professional judgment’”®**

which is
subjective and, as has been demonstrated by the substantial disagreement between the highly-
qualified experts involved in the present case, can legitimately produce widely variable results.
The Tribunal notes that both Parties relied on data gathered from these other tests for various parts

7

of their analysis®* and the key, as Mr Spiller noted during the hearing, was to use that data

“carefully”.

811. Moreover, the Tribunal is not convinced that metal recovery rates predicted by the LCTs would
remain the same at lower head grades. The Tribunal is not persuaded by Claimant’s experts’
assertions that mineralogy rather than head grade is more important in determining metal recovery
or that there would be no correlation between head grade and metal recovery evident from the
testing. The Tribunal notes Dr Brown’s observation that industry standard practice would expect
metal recovery to reduce with lower head grades, and considers that Claimant has not provided any
convincing rationale for why the Brisas mine would behave differently. The Tribunal
consequently prefers the statistical model advocated by Respondent for predicting metal recovery

rates and lower grades, rather than simply assuming that metal recovery would stay the same.

812. In relation to concentrate grades, the Tribunal also finds Respondent’s statistical approach to be
more convincing and reliable than the pull model adopted by Claimant which incorporated a
number of assumptions. The Tribunal accepts the criticisms made by Respondent’s experts as to
incorrect nature of the assumptions made by Claimant’s experts on which the pull model relied for

its accuracy. In particular, the Tribunal notes Respondent’s criticism that:

“[The pull model] can only be used as a predictive model if one knows the
dependence of recovery on head grade, as well as the dependence of pull on head
grade. Since evaluations of the data regarding recovery and pull were not made,
the pull “model” is wholly dependent on the assumptions that Claimant’s experts
make in this regard.”°°

813. Moreover, at the hearing, Dr Altman was unable to answer Dr Brown’s criticisms of her

+9640

assumptions simply stating “we know that plant will operate that way. In the absence of

evidence that would support Claimant’s assumptions, the Tribunal does not consider the pull

model appropriate in the present circumstances.

814. Consequently, the Tribunal finds that Claimant’s DCF valuation should be adjusted to reflect
that Respondent’s mill performance analysis. This requires a reduction of US$ 101 million as

reflected in paragraph 848 below.

M. Saleability of Concentrates

Parties’ Positions

815. The experts agreed that the concentrate produced under a no-layback scenario would be saleable.
The issue therefore was whether the copper content would fall below agreed levels such that the
draft commercial terms that had been agreed with three smelters in 2005 would need to be
renegotiated. The three smelters were Aurubis (Germany), Sumitomo (Japan), and Boliden

(Sweden).

816. Respondent contended that smelters would seek to maintain their margin by negotiating higher
treatment and refining charges in the case of lower copper concentrates (which cost the smelters
more to treat). It estimated the cost to be approximately $50 million. Respondent introduced
evidence from Mr Tuokkola who was the Vice-President of Operations at the Boliden smelter at

the time the draft terms were negotiated with Claimant.

817. Claimant submitted that, even if concentrate grades fell below agreed levels, it was unlikely that
the smelters would seek to renegotiate terms because the market had shifted significantly between
2005-2008 against the smelters. In particular, treatments and refining charges had halved by 2008
as regards those agreed in the 2005 terms and smelters were no longer able to charge price
participation. Claimant contended that the smelters would not risk losing these benefits by re-
opening the terms to negotiation. However, if a renegotiation did occur, it would result in a DCF

deduction of no more than US$ 5 million.

209

Tribunal’s Analysis

818. The experts agreed that market conditions had changed since the negotiation of the smelter
agreement in favour of the mines, particularly in relation to treatment/refining charges and the
inclusion of price participation provisions. The Tribunal is not persuaded that, given the
significant drop in average treatment and refining charges which had effectively halved between
2005 and 2008, that the smelters would risk renegotiation. Even if renegotiation were sought, the
Tribunal is not convinced that it would have any material impact on the DCF calculation as, in the
market that existed in 2008, Gold Reserve would be as likely to benefit from the renegotiation as it
would to be disadvantaged by it — indeed, more likely to benefit than not. As such, the Tribunal
considers that there is no need to make any further adjustment to the DCF valuation to account for

any potential renegotiation.

N. Valuation / Financial Issues

Claimant’s Position

819. Claimant’s primary position was that the absence of a formal legal right to the North Parcel of
land as at April 2008 would not have had any material effect on damages. This is because,
according to Claimant and its valuation expert, Mr Kaczmarek (Navigant), a “reasonably informed
buyer” would have assumed the good faith application of Venezuelan law which, in turn, would
mean that the buyer would have been able to obtain the right to use the North Parcel as a layback.
Thus, the Brisas Project would be purchased on this assumption. Therefore, the fact that the legal
right had not been acquired as at April 2008 did not affect the value, as the right would be acquired

in the future.

820. To support this conclusion, Claimant cited the following reasons for assuming a layback would
be granted in the future: it was required to maximize the concession; laybacks are common in the
industry; laybacks and easements were being approved at the time; Crystallex’s filings indicated it
expected the layback agreement to be implemented; third party valuations at the time assumed a
layback; those minerals were included in Claimant’s reserves in the 2008 NI 43-101 Technical
Report filed with the Toronto Stock Exchange (in which a qualified person independently reported
reserves to the public). Finally, Claimant contended that the owner of the Brisas Project had a
right to obtain use of the North Parcel and a layback agreement onto the Cristinas 4 parcel by

Court order if necessary.

210

821. However, Claimant also provided (as requested under Procedural Order No. 2) an alternative
valuation based on the assumption that no layback existed (i.e., the no-layback scenario). Mr
Kaczmarek (Navigant) determined the value of the Brisas Project on this alternative basis to be

US$ 1,374,492,000 (which was 21% drop in value from the with-layback scenario).

822. To calculate this value, Mr Kaczmarek (Navigant) used same methodology as it did in the
original reports, adjusted for the new mine plan with no layback. This methodology comprised the
weighted average of (i) DCF method; (ii) comparable publically traded company method; and (iii)
comparable transaction method. The weightings attached to each methodology were 50%, 35%
and 15% respectively. Mr Kaczmarek (Navigant) contended that using a weighted average of
these three methods meant that the valuation was not over-sensitive to changes in inputs and that
including a comparable transaction method ensures the valuation is not too far removed from the

market.

823. Mr Kaczmarek (Navigant) criticized Dr Burrows’ (CRA) zero dollar valuation, stating that there
was clearly economic value in the significant gold and copper mineral deposits at Brisas (as shown
by the mineral reserves which are by definition economic to mine). It also cited a number of errors
in Dr Burrows’ (CRA) methodology including use of an incorrect base value and discount rate.
Most of these criticisms are not specific to the no-layback scenario and were also made during the
initial quantum phase. Differences that were specific to the no-layback scenario stem primarily

from the differences between the mining experts already addressed above.
Respondent’s Position

824. Respondent’s position, based on the analysis by Dr Burrows (CRA), is that the Brisas Project

had a zero dollar fair market value (with or without layback) as at April 2008.

825. Respondent rejected Claimant’s assertion that a willing buyer would assume a future layback,
even if no legal right had been granted at that time, and therefore would value the concession on
this basis. Respondent stated that the absence of a layback had a significant effect on value, noting
that, in March 2008, Pincock Allen & Holt wrote “in the event an agreement [on the layback] is

not reached, the reserve estimate will have to be reduced significantly.”

©! Respondent’s Comments on the Joint Expert Procedure Reports, para. 4.

211

826. Dr Burrows (CRA) assessed the value of the Brisas Project based on the DCF method only,
stating that a comparables-based methodology is inappropriate because nature of the geology and

mineralization varies so much from site to site that no valid comparables exist.

827. For the no-layback scenario (as for the with-layback scenario), Dr Burrows did not produce his
own DCF calculation, but began with Mr Kaczmarek’s (Navigant) DCF valuation for its optimum
no-layback scenario (i.e., 0 meter buffer and large stockpiles). He then made a number of
“fundamental corrections” to allow for lower metals recovery, higher smelter charges, revisions to
reflect better the revised mine plan (ramps etc.), and a two year delay to obtain additional permits
etc. (i.e., all the corrections that Respondent’s mining experts suggested). He also corrected the
assumed speed at which Claimant would receive revenue which reduced the value by a further $43

million. In total, these corrections significantly decreased the DCF value to $614 million.

828. Dr Burrows (CRA) then went on to make a number of further corrections to the value regarding
gold/copper prices, inflation, cost of capital etc. These corrections reflected criticisms previously
made of Mr Kaczmarek’s (Navigant) model and were not specific to the no-layback scenario. The
key points in Mr Kaczmarek’s (Navigant) methodology with which Dr Burrows (CRA) took issue

were summarized at paragraphs 24 and 26.0"

The result of making all of these adjustments is a
zero dollar value attributed to the Brisas Project. In effect, his view was that the concession would

have been uneconomical to mine.

Tribunal’s Analysis

Claimant’s Primary Case

829. The Tribunal does not accept Claimant’s primary position that the absence of a legal right to use
the North Parcel of land would have no effect on the value of the Project. There is no doubt that
any reasonable purchaser would take into account the possibility that it would not acquire the right
to use the North Parcel, especially given that Claimant had failed to secure the right or reach an
agreement on a layback by April 2008. Moreover, the Tribunal simply cannot compensate

Claimant for the deprivation of a right that it never possessed.

® Burrows II (Joint Expert Procedure), paras. 24-26.

212

830. Claimant’s experts have modelled an alternative value based on a weighted average of a DCF
valuation, comparable publically traded company and comparables transactions. Although the
Brisas Project was never a functioning mine and therefore did not have a history of cashflow
which would lend itself to the DCF model, the Tribunal accepts the explanation of both Dr
Burrows (CRA) and Mr Kaczmarek (Navigant) that a DCF method can be reliably used in the
instant case because of the commodity nature of the product and detailed mining cashflow analysis
previously performed.“ The Tribunal also notes that the experts agreed on the DCF model used,
and it is only the inputs that are contested. Many of these have already been discussed above, with

the remaining variables discussed below.

Comparables

831. With regard to the use of comparables, Respondent contended that there were simply no
comparable companies or transactions close enough to be used as a measure of value.“ The
Tribunal notes that the DCF method is a preferred method of valuation where sufficient data is
available. This conclusion is supported by the CIMVal Guidelines (referred to at paragraph 780
above) to which both experts referred. In the present cases, many of the arguments in favour of a
DCF approach (a commodity product for which data such as reserves and price are easily
calculated) mitigates against introducing other methods such as comparable transactions or market
capitalization, unless close comparables can be found. On several occasions in this Award, the
Tribunal has rejected a comparable with other mines on the basis that many variables are specific
to each mine (such as climatic and geological conditions) all of which have an impact on value.
Dr Burrows observed in relation to the comparables used by Mr Kaczmarek (Navigant) that “[t]he
characteristics of these deposits vary widely. They were in very different locations with different
geopolitical risks, different types of deposits, different kinds of mining technologies, different
process technologies, different stages of production and different stages of development.”™° He
also noted that no adjustments were made to take account of differences. Although the Tribunal
appreciates Claimant’s concern that the DCF model can be over-sensitive to changes in inputs, the

Tribunal is not convinced that the comparables offered are sufficiently similar to enable then to be

213

used in a weighted valuation calculation. Because of this uncertainty, the Tribunal prefers to use

the DCF model only.

832. This does not mean, however, that the comparables analysis conducted should be ignored
completely. However, rather than ascribed a weighted value to each methodology, the Tribunal
prefers to use the DCF value to assess compensation and refer to comparable companies and
transactions as a cross-reference as to the reasonableness of the DCF valuation. It is noted that, at
least for the original DCF valuation advanced by Claimant, the comparables were in a close range,
suggesting the DCF value was reasonably accurate. Similarly, contemporaneous valuation reports
prepared by independent analysts from JP Morgan, RBC Capital, and Trevor Ellis are useful
references to ensure that the compensation awarded is reasonable. Once again, these analyses
produced values reasonably similar to that derived from Mr Kaczmarek’s (Navigant) DCF

valuation.

Dr Burrows’ Negative Valuation

833. Turning now to the specific DCF values advanced by the Parties, the Tribunal did not find Dr
Burrows’ (CRA) negative valuation, resulting in no compensation, convincing. This would
essentially mean that the mine was completely uneconomic to operate — a highly unlikely
proposition given the effort and expense to which Gold Reserve had committed to get the mine
operational. The detailed feasibility study and various impact studies all demonstrated that the
level of analysis that had gone into the mine was significant. Moreover, Claimant demonstrated
that its valuation was consistent with other independent valuations in 2006 and 2007 by Trevor
Ellis, JP Morgan and RBC Capital.” To suggest that all of these independent valuations are
worthless is simply not credible. If mining the concessions had been uneconomic, Claimant would
have been aware of this and no doubt would not have been proceeding with the venture. In
addition, Mr Pingle (who provided expert evidence on behalf of Claimant for the first hearing)
confirmed the financing that had been arranged for the project, indicating that a convincing
business case had been made to obtain the debt. The absence of a layback on the North Parcel is
hardly likely to be such a significant change as to turn a highly profitable investment into an

unprofitable one.

7 Kaczmarek II, para. 39.

214

834. The Tribunal’s rejection of Dr Burrows’ negative valuation, together with the endorsement of
Mr Kaczmarek’s (Navigant) valuation by its reasonable proximity to the comparables
methodologies and to independent valuations conducted during the relevant period, strongly
suggests that Claimant’s DCF analysis is to be preferred to that of Dr Burrows. However, as
indicated in the previous sections of this damages chapter, the Tribunal finds it appropriate to
make certain adjustments to the DCF valuation to account for some of the no-layback specific
valuation issues. These adjustments are set out in paragraph 848 below. However, in relation to
other disputes between the experts on issues not specific to the no-layback scenario, the Tribunal
generally prefers the methodology and evidence advanced by Mr Kaczmarek (Navigant). For the

sake of completeness, the Tribunal briefly addresses each of these additional issues below.

Metal Prices

835. The first issue is the appropriate metal prices to be used. In relation to gold, both experts used
the futures prices available through to the end of 2012 for calculating prices up until this date.
Thereafter, Mr Kaczmarek (Navigant) continued to apply the last known futures price (as at
December 2012) through to the end of the project. Dr Burrows (CRA) instead used long-term
price forecasts from analysts to calculate the price of metals after December 2012. The dispute

therefore regards the price to be applied from the beginning of 2013.

836. In relation to copper, Mr Kaczmarek (Navigant) used the futures price through June 2010 and
assumed that the price would stay constant (at $3.55 per pound) thereafter. Dr Burrows (CRA)
used Mr Kaczmarek’s (Navigant) projection of the copper price through 2014 and the analysts’

expectations thereafter.

837. The Tribunal accepts Claimant’s explanation that the approach adopted by Mr Kaczmarek
(Navigant) is conservative and holding the last futures contract price constant in a forecast is a
common forecasting methodology in commodity sectors. Dr Burrows’ (CRA) approach results in a
sudden and significant price drop as at the beginning of 2013 and in turn creates an “unrealistic
pricing pattern.” As noted by Mr Kaczmarek (Navigant), Dr Burrows’ (CRA) analysis is the
result of mixing two quite different types of forecasts which in turn have predicted vastly different
prices. In the Tribunal’s view, this mixing of methodologies which creates a pricing prediction
that is clearly at odds with normal price patterns is inappropriate. Given that holding the final

futures prices is a both a common and conservative methodology in the instant case, and appears

8 Claimant’ s Joint Expert Procedure Post-Hearing Brief, para. 122.

215

more consistent with a realistic (albeit conservative) pricing pattern, the Tribunal does not consider
that any adjustment needs to be made to Claimant’s DCF valuation regarding the prices of copper
or gold. Although not relevant to the analysis, the Tribunal notes that actual pricing patterns since
2008 confirm that conservative nature of the metal prices used by Claimant, reinforcing the

Tribunal’s decision not to adjust the valuation further.
Inflation Rate

838. Regarding the inflation rate to be applied, Mr Kaczmarek (Navigant) calculated a 2.39%
inflation rate based on the difference between the yield on 20-year treasury inflation protected
securities (“TIPs”) and the yield on standard treasury bonds of a similar maturity. Dr Burrows
(CRA) used 20-year US dollar inflation swap rates to project inflation of 2.89%. Mr Kaczmarek
(Navigant) stated that its methodology provided a market estimate for the expected rate of

inflation™?

and, while acknowledging that debate exists on the topic, said that “many well-
regarded valuation texts relied on by valuation practitioners advocate the use of TPs." It is
evident that the use of inflation swaps to predict inflation is also a valid method of predicting
inflation. Faced therefore with two valid methodologies for estimating inflation over the relevant
20 year period, the Tribunal is persuaded by the five alternative predictions of long-term US dollar
inflation presented by Claimant at paragraph 178 of Mr Kaczmarek’s Second Expert Report of
July 2011 (which provided a range between 2% and 2.5%) that Claimant’s inflation rate should be

adopted in the present case.
Discount Rate

839. The experts calculated the discount rate to be applied in the present case using the weighted
average cost of capital (or “WACC”). Mr Kaczmarek’s (Navigant) calculation yielded a WACC
of 8.22% made up of the cost of equity; equity/total capital; cost of debt; and debt/total capital. Dr
Burrows (CRA) agreed with the formula to calculate the WACC, put not with the specific inputs
used by Mr Kaczmarek (Navigant) in the calculation. Dr Burrows (CRA), using different inputs,
calculated a WACC discount rate of between 16.5% and 23.8%.

840. Of the different inputs used by Dr Burrows (CRA), the largest discrepancy concerned the

country risk premium applied as part of the cost of equity. Mr Kaczmarek’s (Navigant) uses a

216

country risk premium of 1.5% which he says was confirmed by assessments by independent
analysts in 2008.°! Dr Burrows’ (CRA) country risk premium, unlike Mr Kaczmarek’s
(Navigant), was based on both full and “generic” country risk for an investment in Venezuela in
April 2008. He used a figure of between 6.7% and 16.4%. Thus, it took account of Venezuela’s
policies at the time, including the President’s policy of ousting North American companies from

the mining sector, thus increasing the risk significantly.

841. The Tribunal agrees with Mr Kaczmarek’s (Navigant) contention that it is not appropriate to
increase the country risk premium to reflect the market’s perception that a State might have a
propensity to expropriate investments in breach of BIT obligations. As such, the Tribunal finds the
range of country risk premiums offered by Dr Burrows (CRA) to be too high, as all of these
include some element reflective of the State policy to nationalise investments which has been
discussed in earlier sections of this Award. However, the Tribunal also considers that the country
risk premium adopted by Mr Kaczmarek (Navigant) is too low, as it takes into account only labor
risks and not other genuine risks that should be accounted for - including political risk, other than
expropriation. The Tribunal considers that Mr Kaczmarek (Navigant) has not taken adequate
account of these other risks when estimating his country risk premium. The Tribunal is also
mindful of the fact that it has found that no expropriation occurred in the present case and that
Claimant’s failure to exploit the Concessions within the required timeframes provided the legal
basis on which Respondent terminated the Concessions (albeit inconsistently with its FET
obligations). This fact further detracts from Mr Kaczmarek’s position that expropriation concerns
were the cause of the higher risk premiums estimated by other analysts in 2008. The Tribunal
therefore finds that the country risk premium should be increased to properly reflect the risks

involved.

842. Having considered the various premiums used by analysts in 2008, the Tribunal decides to adopt
a country risk premium of 4% as used in the RBC Capital Markets Report, which was one of the

reports referenced by Mr Kaczmarek®?

(i.e., a 2.5% increase). The Tribunal accepts Dr Burrows’
(CRA) explanation that this premium appropriately considers political risks, together with other
risks, but has not been over-inflated on account of expropriation risks.°? The Tribunal calculates

that using a 4% country risk premium results in a cost of equity of 11.92%, with a resulting

WACC rate of 10.09% (rather than 8.22% as used by Claimant). This results in an increase to the
WACC rate of 1.87%. The Tribunal recalls that it asked Dr Burrows and Mr Kaczmarek at the
October 2013 Hearing whether it could calculate approximate adjustments to the DCF based on the
information provided by the experts to date. In relation to the discount rate, Dr Burrows noted that
although a little complicated, “you could make a back-of-the-envelope calculation and probably

come up with a reasonable adjustment factor without having to actually rewind the model.”

While acknowledging that its estimate might be “rough”®?

the Tribunal finds it appropriate to
deduct US$ 130 million from Claimant’s DCF total to reflect the fact that Mr Kaczmarek’s country

risk premium was too low.

843. With regard to the other inputs used to calculate the cost of equity, the Tribunal prefers those
used by Mr Kaczmarek (Navigant). The Tribunal is convinced that the use of a geometric mean to
calculate the equity market risk premium is appropriate in the present case and also agrees that a
proxy beta rate was required given that Gold Reserve’s beta rate had been affected by
Respondent’s policies. These inputs, as well as the country risk premium are reaffirmed by the
fact that Mr Kaczmarek’s (Navigant) calculation resulted in a WACC that is consistent with those
applied by independent experts both to Gold Reserve and other similar companies at the time. As
such, no change is made to the discount rate and no reduction to the overall valuation on account

of this issue is required.

844. The Tribunal accepts the cost of debt calculated by Mr Kaczmarek (Navigant) and finds that his
methodology was sound. Mr Kaczmarek (Navigant) applied the interest rate that had been
negotiated by Gold Reserve with the Mandatory Lead Arrangers for $425 million debt, being
6.24% (or LIBOR plus 3.55%). He demonstrated that this rate was unlikely to change thus
suggesting it is an appropriate indicator of cost of debt. He also convincingly rebutted the
concerns raised by Dr Burrows (CRA) and demonstrated why each of these concerns did not
invalidate the rate applied, nor did they support the much higher rate that Dr Burrows (CRA) had
proposed instead. The exception was Dr Burrows’ (CRA) suggestion that the interest rate include

an additional 0.72 percent premium to convert the floating LIBOR rate into a fixed rate. Mr

218

Kaczmarek (Navigant) agreed and adjusted its cost of debt to 6.96% to include this premium.*”
The Tribunal therefore finds that no further adjustment is required to Navigant’s WACC rate on
account of cost of debt. Consequently, subject to the country risk premium adjustment set out in
paragraph 843 above, the Tribunal determines that the discount rate calculated and applied by Mr

Kaczmarek (Navigant) was appropriate and no further adjustments are required.

Capital and Operating Costs

845. In its quantum submissions prior to the Joint Expert Procedure, Respondent advocated a number
of capital adjustments that were based primarily on assessments by Dr Rigby (SRK) which in turn
were based on a number of errors in Dr Rigby’s original report summarised in Claimant’s
(Original) Post-Hearing Brief at paragraph 106. Given the seminal nature of these errors, the
Tribunal considers that it cannot rely on Dr Rigby’s evidence in this regard. Conversely, the
Tribunal considers the evidence provided by Claimant’s experts supports the conclusion that
capital costs adopted by Mr Kaczmarek (Navigant) were reasonable and appropriately supported.
The Tribunal therefore finds that no adjustments should be made to Claimant’s DCF valuation on

account of capital or operating costs.

Delay in Receiving Revenues

846. Dr Burrows (CRA) suggested that the 2008 NI 43-101 Report failed to account for a delay in
receiving revenues and although he admitted the delay and its financial impact were uncertain, he
advocated that some account should be taken of this in the DCF valuation. He estimated a delay of
delayed 75 days for concentrate and 30 days for dore would be appropriate. Dr Burrows (CRA)
acknowledged that some delay would be offset by a delay in payables.°* Given that the 2008 NI
43-101 Report does not include such a delay and that the smelting agreements for concentrate
included a highly favourable terms which would have allowed Gold Reserve to receive 90% of the
sales proceeds when the ship was loaded, the Tribunal does not consider that it would be justified
to reduce the DCF in this regard. As such, the Tribunal accepts Mr Kaczmarek’s conclusion his
calculation is conservative on this point and that the favourable terms in the relevant smelting

agreements “would allow Gold Reserve to collect revenues faster than it would need to pay many

of its operating costs and to reduce its overall cost of debt by using some of the cash advances to

pay down debt principle.”°?

Fuel and Electricity Costs

847. Finally, the Tribunal also accepts Mr Kaczmarek’s (Navigant) calculations regarding fuel and
electricity costs, which is consistent with the 2008 NI 43-101 Report. Moreover, given
“Venezuela’s long-standing policy of subsidizing low electricity and fuel prices”? the Tribunal
does not consider it reasonable to double such prices over the forecast period as Dr Burrows
(CRA) did in his analysis. The prices adopted by Mr Kaczmarek (Navigant) are inflation adjusted
and consistent, or even conservative, in the light of historical trends demonstrating prices had
previously tracked downwards. Therefore, the Tribunal finds that no adjustment to Claimant’s

DCF calculation is required regarding fuel and electricity costs.
O. Damages Calculation

848. Taking all of the foregoing considerations into account and doing its conscientious best on the
evidence presented to it, the Tribunal finds it appropriate to award Claimant damages in the sum of

US$ 713,032,000 calculated as follows:

849. The Tribunal has attempted to keep the sequence of the deductions the same as the order used by
the experts so as to minimise any impact from making adjustments for some issues, but not
others.! It has based its figures and the sequence on Dr Burrows’ analysis at Table 1 and Table 3
of his Rebuttal Joint Expert Procedure Report dated 3 July 2013. The Tribunal recognizes that
these figures are estimates of financial impact, but as the experts acknowledged at the hearing,
these “rough” calculations can be used to “come up with a reasonable adjustment factor without
having to actually rerun the model.” This is what the Tribunal has done and it considers that the
overall damages figure resulting from the calculation reflects a fair and reasonable level of

compensation to Claimant and has the effect of wiping out the consequences of the breach of FET.

P. Interest

Parties’ Positions

850. Claimant requested interest be paid on any damages awarded and advocated three potential rates
that the Tribunal might apply: Prime+2%, LIBOR+4%, or the US dollar denominated Venezuela
sovereign bond yields. More specifically, in its Memorial, Claimant requested that pre-Award
interest be awarded at a rate of US Prime plus 2% compounded annually, as this would
appropriately compensate Claimant for loss of the use of funds and represented a normal,
commercial bank lending rate (as did the alternative rate of LIBOR plus 4%). Claimant requested
post-Award interest at a rate equivalent to a willing creditor of the Venezuelan Government (being
the yield on Venezuelan Government Bonds), compounded annually. It argued that, until any
damages awarded in this arbitration were paid, Claimant would effectively become an unwilling
lender to the Venezuelan Government and should therefore be compensated for any delay in
receiving its compensation at an interest rate no less than a willing lender to Venezuela would

accept.

851. During the Joint Expert Procedure, Respondent contended that it is well established the
appropriate interest rate for pre-Award interest is a risk-free interest rate. It therefore submitted
that the Tribunal should order interest, if any, at the US Treasury Bill Rate. Respondent also
rejected Claimant’s request for compound interest, citing case references in support of its

proposition that simple interest should be awarded unless the specific circumstances of the case

°! Transcript, October 2013, Day 2, 226:10-227:3.
° Transcript, October 2013, Day 2, 226:8-9.

221

require compound interest. It said that no such circumstances existed in the present case and
therefore simple interest would be appropriate. Finally, Respondent disputed Claimant’s request

for post-Award interest stating that interest should only be calculated to the date of the Award.

Tribunal’s Analysis

852. The Tribunal is empowered to award interest under Article XII(9) of the BIT which provides
that the Tribunal may award “monetary damages and any applicable interest”. Claimant has
requested both pre- and post-Award interest, and the Tribunal will address each of these

separately, beginning with pre-Award interest.

853. The Tribunal considers that the appropriate purpose of pre-Award interest is to ensure Claimant
is properly compensated for the FET breach that has occurred, although it need not compensate
Claimant as a “borrower”. The Tribunal finds that the US Government Treasury Bill rate

represents a reasonable and fair rate of interest that would fulfil this purpose.

854. However, the Tribunal does not accept Respondent’s contention that pre-Award should be
awarded on a “simple” basis. While awarding simple interest was once the norm in investment
arbitration as demonstrated by the cases referred to by Respondent in its Counter-Memorial, the
Tribunal agrees with Claimant that there has been an evident shift in investment treaty cases in
recent years towards awarding compound interest.%™ Compound interest better reflects current
business and economic realities and therefore the actual damage suffered by a party. It is also
commensurate with the serious nature of the breach involved in the present case, as there is an
observable trend in recent years to award compound interest in cases involving the total

deprivation of property.

855. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that Claimant is entitled to pre-Award interest from 14 April

2008 to the date of this Award at the US Government Treasury Bill Rate compounded annually.

856. With regard to post-Award interest, the Tribunal finds that it is empowered to award such

interest and indeed that it is common practice to do so. As requested by Claimant, the Tribunal

222

may also determine a different interest rate to apply to post-Award interest than that applied to pre-
Award interest. This is because the purpose of post-Award interest is arguably different - damages
become due as at the date of the Award, and from this time, Respondent is essentially in default of
payment. As such, the Tribunal considers that continuing to apply a risk-free interest rate would
be inappropriate. The Tribunal considers that a rate of LIBOR plus 2% reflects an appropriate,
commercial post-Award interest rate. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that Claimant is entitled to
post-Award interest from the date of this Award until payment in full at a rate of LIBOR plus 2%

compounded annually.

CHAPTER IX. COSTS

Parties’ Positions

857. In its Memorial, Claimant claimed that the Tribunal should order Respondent to bear all the legal
expenses incurred by Gold Reserve related to this proceeding, including its attorneys’ fees, the fees
of expert witnesses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal, and the charges for the
use of the facilities of the Centre, in their entirety.°° In support of its claim for costs, Claimant
cited a number of investment cases where the “loser pays” principle has been applied and stated
that the “Respondent’s challenge of every conceivable point of both fact and law and without an
evidentiary or legal basis for doing so has increased the expense of this arbitration considerably

and needlessly.”°°

858. Respondent did not make any detailed submissions on costs but requested that it “be awarded

compensation for the expenses and costs associated with defending against these claims.”°°*

Tribunal’s Analysis

859. The Tribunal has the power to order costs under Article XII(9) of the BIT which provides that
the tribunal “may also award costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules.” Article

52(1)(j) of the Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules provides that the award shall contain “any

°° Memorial, para. 464.
°°7 Reply, para. 685.

8 Counter-Memorial, para. 773.

223

decision of the Tribunal regarding the cost of the proceeding” and Article 58(1) provides that “the
Tribunal shall decide how and by whom the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal, the
expenses and charges of the Secretariat and the expenses incurred by the Parties in connection with
the proceeding shall be borne,” such decision to “form part of the award” in accordance with

Article 58(2).

860. As noted by Claimant, while the traditional position in investment arbitration has been that the
Parties bear their own legal costs and share equally the costs of the arbitration, there have been a
number of cases which have departed from this principle and have awarded costs on a “loser pays”
basis. The Tribunal finds that, in the circumstances of this particular arbitration, the application of
the “loser pays” principle is appropriate. Compensating Claimant for the cost of bringing this
proceeding is required to wipe out the consequences of Respondent’s breach of the BIT and is

particularly appropriate in the current case given the serious and egregious nature of the breach.

861. Following the Tribunal’s requests on April 28 and May 20, 2014, both Parties have filed cost

submissions as follows:

- Claimant on May 23, 2014 for a total amount of US$ 20,462,628, not considering
ICSID fees and costs;

- Respondent on May 26, 2014, for a total amount of US$ 12,788,517.23 plus Euro
20,851.46, excluding ICSID fees and costs.

By exchange of communications dated June 3, 2014 the Parties have agreed that it was not
necessary to submit observations on the respective cost submissions. On the same date the

Tribunal accepted the Parties’ agreed course of action.

862. In view of the outcome of the case, substantially in Claimant’s favour, the difficulty of issues
pertaining to damages evaluation and the material disproportion between the Parties’ respective
costs, the Tribunal considers appropriate that Respondent reimburse Claimant for part of the
latter’s fees and costs in the amount of US$ 5 million, all other fees and costs incurred by each
Party to be borne by such Party, except that the Parties shall bear equally all costs incurred for the

Tribunal’s and ICSID’s fees and costs.

224

CHAPTER X. AWARD

863. For all of the foregoing reasons, and rejecting all submissions and contentions to the
contrary, the Tribunal DECLARES, AWARDS and ORDERS as follows in respect of the issues

arising for determination in these proceedings:

(i) Venezuela breached Article II(2) of the BIT by failing to accord fair and equitable

treatment to Gold Reserve’s investment.

(ii) Venezuela shall pay Gold Reserve compensation for the breach of the BIT in the sum of
US$ 713,032,000, increased by interest from 14 April 2008 to the date of this Award at the

United States Government Treasury Bill Rate, compounded annually.

(iii) Post-award interest shall run on the total amount awarded under (ii) above at a rate of

LIBOR plus 2%, compounded annually, from the date of the Award until payment in full.
(iv) The Parties shall bear all their own legal costs and expenses, except that Venezuela shall

reimburse Gold Reserve the sum of US$ 5 million as part of the latter’s legal costs and

expenses. The Parties shall bear equally all costs incurred for the Tribunal’s and ICSID’s

fees and costs.

All other claims and requests for relief by either Party are dismissed.
