I. INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

A. Introduction

1. This case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for the Settlement
of Investment Disputes (“ICSID”) on the basis of the Treaty between the Federal Republic of
Germany and the Republic of Ghana for the encouragement and reciprocal protection of
investments of February 24, 1995 (the “BIT” or “Treaty”), which entered into force on 23
November 1998, and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between
States and Nationals of Other States (the “ICSID Convention”). The dispute relates to a
cocoa beans processing and trade joint-venture between a German investor and a statutory
company established under the laws of Ghana. The joint-venture partners created a company
registered in Ghana which took over the assets of an existing factory for the processing of
cocoa beans, sheanuts and other related products. The Ghanaian partner supplied cocoa
beans to the joint-venture company and the German partner contributed to the modernisation

of the factory and purchased the refined products.

2. The dispute arises out of the contractual relationship between the joint-venture
partners and concerns claims for breaches of the joint-venture agreement as well as breaches

of the BIT.

B. Parties

3. The Claimant is Gustav F W Hamester GmbH & Co KG, a limited partnership
company organised under the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany, based at Hosta Werk
fiir Schokoladenspezialitaten GmbH & Co, An der B290, 74597 Stimpfach-Randenweiler,
Germany (the “Claimant” or “Hamester”). Hamester is the successor to Walter Schréder
GmbH & Co. KG Kakao- und Schokoladen-Werk (“Schréder’”), a German limited
partnership company, which merged with Gustav F W Hamester GmbH, a German limited
liability company, in 1995. As many of the facts relating to this case occurred prior to the
merger agreement, Schréder will also be referred to as the Claimant for the purposes of this

Award.

4. The Claimant is involved in the international trade of cocoa and cocoa products, as
well as cocoa processing. It has been represented in this proceeding by Mr. Akbar Ali, AFA
Law, and by Mr. Andrew Goddard Q.C. and Mr. Riaz Hussain, both of Atkin Chambers.

5. The Respondent is the Republic of Ghana (the “Respondent”, “ROG” or “Ghana”),
In its Counter-Memorial, it was described in the following manner:
“The Republic of Ghana is a democratic nation state in West Africa with a population of
approximately 23 million people. It was the first state in sub-Saharan Africa to gain its
independence, becoming independent from the British Empire in 1957. It inherited a legal

system based on the English common law. Ghana is well known internationally for its world-
leading cocoa industry and its political stability and successful transition to democracy.

Ghana is one of the world’s poorest countries ...”

The ROG is represented in this case by Mr. Arthur Marriott Q.C., Mr. Thomas Geuther, Mr.

Paul Cohen and Ms. Christina Loucas, all of the law firm of Dewey & LeBoeuf.

6. The Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Ghana have been Parties to the
ICSID Convention since 1969 and 1966, respectively.

IL. PROCEDURAL HISTORY

7. The Claimant’s Request for Arbitration submitted against Ghana was registered by the
Secretary-General of ICSID on September 24, 2007 pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID
Convention. The notice of registration invited the parties to communicate to ICSID any
provisions agreed by them regarding the number of arbitrators and the method of their
appointment. The parties having failed to agree on the number of arbitrators and the method
of their appointment, on December 17, 2007, in accordance with Rule 2(3) of the ICSID
Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the “Arbitration Rules”), the Claimant
invoked Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention for the constitution of the Tribunal.
Accordingly, the Tribunal was to consist of three arbitrators, one appointed by each party and

the presiding arbitrator to be appointed by agreement of the parties.

8. On December 17, 2007, the Claimant appointed Dr. Bernardo M. Cremades, a
Spanish national, as an arbitrator and, soon thereafter, the Respondent appointed Mr. Toby

Landau Q.C., a British national. The parties subsequently agreed on the appointment of

Professor Brigitte Stern, a French national, as the President of the Tribunal. The Tribunal
was thus constituted on February 4, 2008. Ms. Martina Polasek, Senior Counsel, ICSID, was

designated as the Tribunal’s Secretary.

9. Pursuant to Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held its first session with the parties
in London on April 2, 2008. Among other things, it was agreed that the Arbitration Rules in
force since April 10, 2006 would apply; that the place of proceedings would be London; and
that the procedural language would be English. In addition, the parties agreed on a timetable
for the filing of written pleadings on the merits. In the event there were to be raised
objections to jurisdiction and the proceeding was bifurcated, the parties agreed that there
would be an alternative timetable. The Respondent stated that such objections would be
notified promptly to the Tribunal. The period of June 29 through July 7, 2009 was reserved

for a Hearing on the merits.

10. The Claimant having requested an extension for the submission of the Memorial on
the merits, on August 5, 2008 the Tribunal issued directions amending the timetable for the
written phase of the proceeding. The Claimant filed its Memorial on September 16, 2008,
with one day of delay. On November 4, 2008, the Respondent notified the Tribunal that it
intended to raise jurisdictional objections and asked that the objections be joined to the merits
of the dispute. By letter of November 11, 2008, the Respondent identified its central
jurisdictional objections. The Tribunal invited the Respondent to submit the objections with
the ROG’s Counter-Memorial on the merits due on January 14, 2009, and reserved its

decision on the bifurcation of the proceedings.

11. On January 5, 2009, the ROG applied for an extension of the time limit to submit its
Counter-Memorial due to the change of Government in Ghana. The Tribunal granted the
extension until February 9, 2009 and amended the procedural timetable accordingly. The
Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial, including objections to jurisdiction, on February 2,

2009.

12. By letter of February 20, 2009, the Tribunal informed the parties that the
Respondent’s objections to jurisdiction would be joined to the merits of the dispute and
should be addressed in the Reply and Rejoinder, unless a party requested that the objections
be dealt with as a preliminary question. The Tribunal further invited the Claimant to indicate

whether it wished to file a further submission (Rejoinder on jurisdiction) before the oral

Hearing. Neither party applied for the bifurcation of the proceeding by February 27, 2009,
the time limit fixed by the Tribunal. The Claimant stated that it reserved its position

generally until it had made a full and detailed assessment of the Respondent’s arguments.

13. On March 9, 2009, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal deal with the
Respondent’s objections to jurisdiction as a preliminary question in a bifurcated proceeding.
The Respondent opposed the application. Having considered the parties’ positions, on March
16, 2009, the Tribunal decided that the objections to jurisdiction should be joined to the
merits. The Tribunal again invited the Claimant to notify whether it wished to file a

Rejoinder on jurisdiction. The Claimant made no such notification.

14. Following another request for an extension, the Tribunal moved the date for the filing
of the Claimant’s Reply to April 9, 2009. However, on April 3, 2009, Claimant’s counsel
informed the Tribunal that it had been instructed to put the preparation and completion of the
Reply on hold. Thereafter, the same counsel explained by letter of April 16, 2009 that “the
Claimant company no longer trades and is effectively reliant on others to fund the current
dispute proceeding before ICSID.” The same letter stated that the funding issues had been
resolved and that the Claimant had made arrangements to transfer the advance payment that
the Centre had requested on March 2, 2009. The Claimant requested a further extension for

the filing of the Reply until May 11, 2009.

15. The Claimant’s letters prompted the Respondent’s request for provisional measures,
filed on April 17, 2009, concerning security for costs under ICSID Arbitration Rule 39(1) and
Article 47 of the ICSID Convention. In the Respondent’s view, the letters indicated that the
Claimant would be unable to satisfy a potential award of costs and requested the Tribunal to
recommend that the Claimant post, within fourteen days, a letter of credit for US$ 2 million
as security. The Tribunal invited the Claimant’s observations on the request and,
subsequently, the Respondent’s reply and the Claimant’s rejoinder. The parties filed the

pleadings as scheduled.

16. On June 11, 2009, the Tribunal held a pre-hearing conference call with the parties.
The Tribunal subsequently issued Procedural Order No. | concerning the organisation of the
Hearing and Procedural Order No. 2, concerning the admissibility of an Expert Report on
Ghanaian law from Dr. SKB Asante submitted by the Respondent with its Rejoinder, and the

production of documents requested by the Claimant.

17. The Tribunal ruled on the Respondent’s request for provisional measures in
Procedural Order No. 3 issued on June 24, 2009, upon ICSID’s receipt of the Claimant’s
advance payment shortly before the Hearing. It ruled that there was a serious risk that an
order for security for costs would stifle the Claimant’s claims and that, in any event, it had
not been shown that the measures requested were necessary and urgent. An order for security
for costs would not serve its purpose without cancelling or postponing the Hearing, which

was neither requested nor practicable at that stage of the proceeding.

18. After several requests for extensions partially granted by the Tribunal, the Claimant
submitted its Reply on April 30, 2009, excluding certain witness statements and exhibits.
The submission was completed on May 7 and 13, 2009. An extension was equally granted to

the Respondent for the filing of its Rejoinder, which was submitted on June 9, 2009.

19. The oral Hearing on jurisdiction and the merits was held at the International Dispute
Resolution Centre in London from June 29 through July 3. In addition to the Tribunal and

the Secretary, the following persons were present:

Il. Facts
A. The Joint-Venture Agreement and the incorporation of Wamco I

22. On August 26, 1992, Hamester, through its predecessor Schréder', concluded a Joint-
Venture Agreement (the “JVA”) with the Ghana Cocoa Board (“Cocobod,” “Cocoa Board”
or “GCB”). Cocobod was established by the Ghana Cocoa Board Law of May 3, 1984,
amended in 1991 (the “GCB Law”), as a successor to the Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board.
The primary function of Cocobod under the GCB Law is to purchase cocoa beans from
Ghanaian cocoa farmers and to market and export them. Other functions include the
encouraging of cocoa production; the undertaking of cocoa cultivation; the regulation of the
marketing and export of cocoa; the establishment of industrial processing factories for the
processing of cocoa; and the assistance in the development of the cocoa industry.” Cocobod

sells the beans through its subsidiary, Cocoa Marketing Company Limited (“CMC”).

' The JVA was signed on August 26, 1992 by Schréder, but after its merger with Hamester, the latter, by letter
dated June 2, 1997, wrote to Wamco stating: “We refer to the JV Agreement. We also refer to the Regulations of
WAMCO ... For the record we wish to advise hereby that Messrs Gustav F W Hamester GmbH & Co. of.
Postfach 26 14 64, 20504 Hamburg are the legal successors/legal representatives of Walter Schroeder GmbH &
Co.,” Claimant’s Memorial, para. 31.

? Part II(2) of the GCB Law of 1984, Exh. 6 to the Claimant’s Request for Arbitration.

23. The purpose of the JVA was to rehabilitate an old cocoa processing factory located at
Takoradi in Ghana, CPC West African Mills (“CPC/WAM7”), owned by Cocobod, so that it
could process by the most advanced technology all grades and qualities of cocoa beans
produced in Ghana, in order to maximise Ghana’s cocoa beans processing capacity.? To this
effect, the JVA parties incorporated a company organised under the laws of Ghana, West
African Mills Company Limited (“Wamco I”), which would take over the assets and titles of
the old factory. Hamester was to provide technology, know-how and funding to modernise
Wamco I, while Cocobod contributed the assets of the old factory and was to supply beans

for processing at the plant.

24. Wamco I was incorporated on December 1, 1992 with 50,000 ordinary shares. Under
the JVA, it was agreed that the shareholding structure would be divided so that Cocobod held
40 percent and Hamester held 60 percent.* Accordingly, upon the incorporation of Wamco I,
20,000 shares were issued to Cocobod and 30,000 shares were issued to Hamester. The share
capital corresponded to DM 13,563,000. The payment for the shares was, in the case of
Cocobod, made by its contribution of the fixed assets from CPC/WAM and, in the case of
Hamester, by the funding of the rehabilitation of the factory. The total investment in the
joint-venture project was estimated at DM 16,050,021.5 The Claimant asserts that its
investment in the rehabilitation works amounted to approximately EUR 19,030,720, while the

Respondent states that the true modernisation cost was much lower.°

25. Wanmco I had seven directors, of which four were to be appointed by Hamester.” Out
of its appointees, Hamester was also to designate the Managing Director. The first Managing
Director appointed by Hamester was Mr. Reinhold Miiller, who was involved in the

negotiations that preceded the conclusion of the JVA.

26. The supply and price of the beans sold by Cocobod to Wamco I was addressed in
Article 7 of the JVA as follows:

“Cocobod shall sell to the factory for processing the desired grades and quantities of cocoa
beans (including cocoa waste, substandard cocoa, grades II and III cocoa, and mid crop
cocoa). Should such grades of cocoa not be available, Cocobod shall then sell main crop grade
I cocoa. The Factory shall at all times be supplied with all its requirements of cocoa beans to

enable it to operate at its full capacity. The conditions on which cocoa beans shall be sold,
and the methods by which their prices shall be determined are to be agreed upon by the
Company [Wamco I] and Cocobod. These conditions and prices shall be based on the
takeover prices approved by the Cocoa Producer Price Review Committee.”

As will be seen below, it is this provision of the JVA that is at the heart of the dispute.

27. The JVA was governed by the laws of Ghana. The dispute-settlement clause
provided, in the first instance, for the amicable resolution of disputes and controversies
(Article 12(a)) and, in the second instance:
“Where any disputes arise between the parties hereto which cannot be amicably settled, then
the dispute shall be referred to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment
Disputes.” (Article 12(b))
Prior to this arbitration, the Claimant had sought, initially, to commence ICSID arbitral
proceedings pursuant to the above-quoted provision of the JVA. Thereafter, however, the
Claimant invoked the arbitration provisions of the BIT instead. The reason for not relying on
the JVA dispute resolution clause was confirmed in the Claimant’s Post-Hearing Brief, where

it is stated that:

“Arbitrator Cremades asked why Hamester had not brought an ICSID claim under the JVA.
The answer is that Hamester did try to submit such a claim but the Centre declined
jurisdiction on the grounds that Cocobod is not a designated constituent subdivision or agency
of Ghana under Article 25(1) of the Convention.”*

28. In 1988, prior to the conclusion of the JVA, Hamester and Cocobod had already
started a project to modernise the CPC/WAM (Wamco I) factory. To that effect, they
concluded a loan agreement which provided that Hamester would lend Cocobod DM 24.9
million, subject to an interest rate of approximately 8 percent per annum.’ Hamester was also
to provide certain initial engineering consulting work, but it was not to be involved in the
operation of CPC/WAM. At that time, Hamester was managed by Mr. Hermann Opferkuch’s
father, who passed away in 1990. Mr. Opferkuch Junior has since been the controlling
shareholder of Hamester. By the entry into force of the JVA, the previous loan agreement

between the same parties ceased to have effect.'°

B. The initial years of the Joint-Venture and Wamco II and II

29. Wanmco I is an expeller plant that is designed to produce expeller cocoa butter and
expeller cocoa cake, principally using the smaller light crop cocoa beans, but also lower
quality substandard beans. The rehabilitation works involved the installation of expellers and
other machinery. The plant commenced operations in late 1993 and was fully operational in

early 1994.

30. On December 15, 1993, Wamco I (with the approval of the Claimant) purchased from
Cocobod assets in another cocoa processing factory at Takoradi that required modernisation,
CPC Taksi, which became known as Wamco 0! According to the Claimant, the investment
was financed directly from profits generated by Wamco 1? According to the Respondent,
the financing constituted part of a fraudulent scheme: on paper, Hamester was falsely
portrayed as having contributed more than its share for Wamco I, and on this basis it claimed
that it was entitled to loan repayments of DM 7,692,205 from Wamco; this (alleged
fraudulently inflated) loan was then deployed in order to acquire 120,000 shares in Wamco
1.3 For the Respondent, this was one element of a fraud that permeated the acquisition of

the investment:

“This is how Mr Opferkuch eventually decided to use Hamester’s fraudulently inflated DM

7,692,205 loan — it was cancelled to pay for Hamester’s new 120,000 shares.”!*
31. The second plant was designed to produce high quality pure prime press butter and
high quality cocoa cake using Grade I and II main crop cocoa beans. The beans were to be
changed into a cocoa mass or liquor during a grinding process and then pot pressed and split
into butter and cake. Wamco II became operational in 1994 as a result of a modernisation
funded by Hamester, which was completed in 1997. Hamester claims that it invested
approximately EUR 35,259,161 in the rehabilitation, while the Respondent states that the
amount is unsupported and grossly inflated. According to the Respondent, the terms of the
JVA did not extend to cover Wamco II, while the Claimant argues that the purchase of

‘Wamco II was expressly subject to the terms and conditions of the Jva.'°

32. A third plant, Wamco III, which was similar to Wamco II, was constructed in 1998.
Hamester claims that it invested EUR 11,871,093 in this respect. All three plants are
collectively referred to as “Wamco” for the purposes of this Award. Their maximum
capacity in terms of the quantity of cocoa beans that could be processed annually is disputed

between the parties.

33. As soon as the Wamco I plant became operational in 1993/1994, the entire output of
the plant was sold exclusively to Hamester at prices communicated by Hamester. There was
no written contract between Hamester and Wamco I governing the supply and purchase price
of Wamco I’s products, which was not regulated by the JVA. In 1997, Mr. Miiller was
dismissed as the Managing Director of Wamco I and replaced by Mr. Jelle Kuiper. By that
time, Wamco was in financial difficulties and indebted to Cocobod. This indebtness,
according to the Respondent, was due to Hamester’s failure to pay Wamco for products
supplied. The Respondent asserts that Wamco’s annual accounts for the year 1997 show a
debt of DM 50.656 million by Wamco to Cocobod, and a debt of DM 44.195 million by the
Claimant to Wamco.'7 In 1998, Wamco’s debt to Cocobod was alleged to be approximately
USD 30 million.'® The Claimant denies that any debt was owed by Hamester to Wamco, but
does not deny that Wamco was indebted to Cocobod in 1998." According to correspondence
from Wamco to Cocobod, Wamco’s non-payment of invoices for products received from
Cocobod was due to the fact that Wamco and Cocobod had not reached a firm agreement on
pricing.” Subsequently, on July 22, 1998, Cocobod and Wamco concluded a ‘Without
Prejudice’ Agreement on the pricing of beans, which amended and renewed a pricing
agreement dated July 11, 1997 regulating the price of beans supplied from January 1, 1996 to
June 30, 1998.7!

34. While Wamco and Cocobod concluded several agreements concerning the methods by
which prices for cocoa sold to Wamco were to be determined during a certain time period,”
it appears that they had difficulty in reaching agreements on the actual prices.”? On October
14, 1999, the Chief Executive of Cocobod, Mr. Newman, stated in a letter to Wamco that a

new policy under the Ghana Cocoa Sector Development Strategy prescribed that, with effect

from July 1, 1999, local processing factories would be required to purchase cocoa beans at
FOB (Free On Board) prices from CMC.™ Hamester argued that the new policy was not
applicable to Wamco in view of Article 7 of the JVA, but indicated that it was prepared to

consider amendments to the JVA.?°

C. The 2001 Price Agreement

35. In late 2000, a new Government took office in Ghana, which led to a change in
Cocobod’s management. In 2001, Mr. Newman was replaced by Mr. Kwame Sarpong as the
Chief Executive of Cocobod. During the same year, Mr. Kuiper was replaced by Mr.

Michael Holzapfel as Wamco’s Managing Director.

36. During 2000 and 2001, Hamester and Cocobod attempted to reach agreement on an
amendment to the JVA, however the attempts failed due to the parties’ divergent views on the
pricing of the beans. Regardless of the new Government’s policy launched in 1999, a price
agreement between Cocobod and Wamco was concluded on October 27, 2000, covering the
supply of beans in the period January to September of that year.”° Negotiations continued for
the year 2001. By letter of March 9, 2001, Hamester proposed that the pricing formula be
based on a farmgate price, suggesting that the supply to Wamco “shall neither generate a

profit nor a loss to Cocobod.”?”
37. Cocobod replied by letter of March 30, 2001 that:

“although the pricing formula in the proposal is at variance with current government policy
[...], it could form the basis for negotiating an interim price agreement pending the formal
review of the JVA to incorporate the new government policy.”**

38. In further correspondence concerning deliveries made to Wamco in January 2001,
Hamester calculated the price of the delivery based on a farmgate price + 10 percent and sent
a cheque with the amount in Ghanaian Cedis to Cocobod.”” Cocobod returned the cheque, as

it was in Cedis when previously such payments had always been in foreign currency, as

required by the Ghanaian legislation. By the same letter, Cocobod suggested further

discussions on the pricing of the beans.”

39. On August 10, 2001, Cocobod informed Wamco that it had run out of funds needed to
meet operational requirements, and therefore requested a payment of DM 20 million to cover

costs of the beans supplied in 2001, pending a resolution of the pricing problem.”!

Wamco
first offered to pay the equivalent of DM 10 million in Cedis, but subsequently made a down
payment of DM 20 million in November 2001. The CMC had in the meantime calculated
that Wamco owed Cocobod DM 44.321 million.*? Cocobod thus claimed the difference (DM
24 million), to be paid by November 30, 2001, and stated that it would cease supplies to
‘Wamco in case of non-payment of this debt. Wamco took the position that it only owed an
additional DM 17.230 million and paid that sum on December 5, 2001, at which point
Cocobod stopped its deliveries of beans.** Wamco wrote to Cocobod on December 7, 2001,
stating that the stoppage of supply was a breach of Article 7 of the JVA, and that it would be
forced to close down the factory and lay off workers by the end of December if deliveries
were not resumed. Wamco’s letter was copied to the President, the Vice President, as well as
the Minister of Finance of the ROG.*> Hamester had previously (on November 19, 2001) set
out its position in a letter to the Minister of Finance, proposing that Article 7 of the JVA be

amended to provide for FOB pricing applicable from January 1, 2003.*°

40. This situation led to the conclusion of a Price Agreement between Cocobod and
Wamco on December 14, 2001 (the “2001 Price Agreement”).*” This Agreement, which

provided for fixed prices up until December 31, 2002, stated the following:

“NOW THEREFORE IT IS AGREED AS FOLLOWS:

i. All types of Cocoa beans sold by COCOBOD to WAMCO for the period 1“ January 2001
to 30" September 2001 shall be at a price of DM 1,150 per tonne. Provided that the
outstanding bill of DM 3,545,70 in respect of the 35,475.5 tonnes Cocoa beans delivered to
WAMCO between January and September 2001 shall be settled by WAMCO on or by 31*
January 2002.

ii. All types of Cocoa Beans sold by COCOBOD to WAMCO for the period 1*' October 2001
to 31 December 2001 shall be at a price of DM 1,250 per tonne.

iii, All types of Cocoa beans sold by COCOBOD to WAMCO for the period 1“ January 2002
to 31" December 2002 shall be at a price of DM 1,450 per tonne.

All types of Cocoa beans sold by COCOBOD to WAMCO from 1“ January 2003
shall be at FOB price.”
Al. The Claimant contends that the 2001 Price Agreement is invalid because it was

concluded under duress, namely the threat of cessation of supply to Wamco.**

D. The shortage of supply in 2002

42. Following the conclusion of the 2001 Price Agreement, Cocobod resumed its supply
of beans to Wamco. By letter of January 2, 2002, Wamco stated that it intended to process a
total of 70,000 tonnes of cocoa beans and suggested that they be delivered in equal monthly
deliveries.*? On March 7, 2002, Cocobod held a meeting with cocoa processing factories in
Ghana to inform them of a shortage facing the industry and to request that they take
precautionary actions.” The shortage, according to the Respondent, was due to smuggling of

cocoa to the Ivory Coast and an outbreak of black pod disease.*!

43. By letter of April 23, 2002, Wamco, through its lawyers, wrote to Cocobod stating
that the intermittent supplies below the quantities requested were in breach of the JVA and
were causing Wamco to incur losses.*” Wamco asked Cocobod to take steps to insure that
the factories were supplied with a sufficient quantity of beans. It subsequently quantified its
claimed losses due to insufficient supply, stating that it would deduct those losses from
CMC’s invoices, and that it was not prepared to make any payment unless Cocobod restored
the supplies.*? By letter of July 3, 2002, Cocobod requested that Wamco settle its
outstanding invoices in the amount of EUR 8,462,329.68 by July 31 or Cocobod would stop

supplies altogether and initiate legal action.

44, By the end of July 2002, Wamco estimated its losses at EUR 4,771,971 and offered to
pay the balance of CMC’s invoices and its loss after the supply resumed. Cocobod resumed
its supply but did not meet the quantity of 70,000 tonnes desired by Wamco for the year
2002. At the same time, Wamco’s debt to Cocobod grew. On December 16, 2002, Wamco
claimed a shortage of delivery of 34,500 tonnes and requested that this quantity be supplied at
2002 prices before the FOB price according to the 2001 Price Agreement came into effect.°
According to the Respondent, in January 2003, Wamco’s debt to Cocobod for cocoa beans
supplied during 2002 and January 2003 was EUR 24.3 million, and Hamester’s debt to

‘Wamco for cocoa products supplied was EUR 31.6 million.*® It is the Respondent’s position

that:
“Wamco was rendered insolvent in late 2002, because for the entirety of 2002 Hamester
forced Wamco to deliver all of its products to Hamester or Hamester’s customers without
Wamnco receiving any payment whatsoever.”

45. The reason for Wamco’s insolvency by the end of 2002 does not seem to be contested

by the Claimant, as appears from Mr. Holziipfel’s Second Witness Statement:**

“... also Hamester was not paying Wamco because of the non-delivery losses.

101. Ihad chased Hamester for the sums owed. Hamester told us that payment was not being
made due to contra-charges arising from the non delivery of orders by Wamco and losses
suffered by Hamester on forward contracts as a result of this non delivery.”

46. This issue was discussed during the Hearing, when the President asked Mr. Holzipfel

on what legal basis these penalties were charged:

“THE CHAIRMAN: ... on what basis were you, as a company, charging penalties?

A. The charging of penalties was not based on any, let us say, contract saying, “If you do not
make this I will have a chance or a right to do that” ae

47. The Respondent addressed this exchange in its Post-Hearing Brief, submitting that:

“Hamester refused to pay the € 31.6 million because of “penalties” which it unilaterally
imposed on Wamco without having any contractual basis for doing so. It is an odd
coincidence — not the only one in this case — that these supposed penalties came to exactly
€31.6 million, and thus cancelled out Hamester’s entire debt to Wamco.””

E. The end of the Joint-Venture

48. By letter of January 14, 2003, Hamester set out its position concerning the outstanding
issues between the Wamco joint-venture partners.*! It claimed that the amount due by
‘Wamco to Cocobod as of December 12, 2002 was EUR 9,725,770, because of losses incurred
by Wamco during 2002 due to the non-supply of beans. It also stated that the 30,000 tonnes
of cocoa that Wamco had requested in 2002 but which had not been delivered should be
supplied during 2003 at 2002 prices. It further expressed a concern that the FOB price set out
in the 2001 Price Agreement was not viable. These issues, Hamester wrote, needed to be

resolved before Hamester would make any payment for deliveries in 2002.

49, If there was no resolution of the issues, Hamester stated that it wanted to abandon the
joint-venture:

“... we want to express our strong will to abandon this Joint-Venture by 31.01.2003, if there
is no holistic solution to our above mentioned areas of concern.”

A second notice of the intention to pull out was sent to the Minister of Finance of Ghana on
February 10, 2003:

“... the present 60% shareholder of West African Mills Company Ltd, herewith states that we
intend to pull out of the Joint Venture by 31 March 2003.”

50. | Hamester’s concerns were discussed during a Wamco Board meeting held on January
16, 2003, chaired by Dr. Sammy Ohene, Wamco’s Chairman of the Board of Directors since
June 2002. It was noted that Wamco had not made any payment since August 2002, but it
was also decided that the company “should be kept afloat,” and that Cocobod would supply
beans for a limited period of time. At the meeting, Cocobod representatives on the Board
objected to the rescheduling of a loan facility extended to Wamco, which had been arranged
by the Managing Director of Wamco, Mr. Holzapfel. As a result, on the same date, Dr.
Ohene wrote to the relevant bank on behalf of Wamco requesting the suspension of any loan
facility without formal Board approval.° Concurrently, Dr. Ohene and Mr. Sarpong, Chief
Executive of Cocobod and its appointees to the Wamco Board of Directors, wrote a letter on
Wamco’s letterhead to Mr. Holzapfel, objecting to certain investments made and loan

facilities contracted by Wamco’s Hamester representatives which had not received Board

*! Exh. RC237.
* Bxh. RC238.
* Exh. RC239.

16

approval.* The letter was copied to the Office of the President, Ministry of Finance, the
Ministry of Trade & Industries and the German Embassy. Hamester responded that any
decision by the Managing Director could be corrected by a majority decision of the Wamco
Board of Directors. Since Hamester had appointed four of the seven Wamco Board
directors, it was of the view that an approval was superfluous as the majority of the Board

would have in any event approved the contested actions.

51. By letter of January 29, 2003, Hamester wrote to the Minister of Finance of Ghana to
request discussions:
“to find ways and means how Hamester can pull out of the Joint-Venture, so that all persons
involved, especially the customers and the employees of WAMCO see a clear way for the
future.”°°
52. The same day, Wamco’s Managing Director again requested Cocobod to supply to
‘Wamco the 30,000 tonnes of cocoa requested in 2002 at the 2002 price. Cocobod denied that

it owed any cocoa beans to Wamco for the year 2002.°7

53. On January 30, 2003, Dr. Ohene wrote to Wamco’s Director of Operations that a
resolution of the issues raised in Hamester’s letter of January 14, 2003 seemed unlikely
before the date by which Hamester had indicated that it would wish to abandon the joint-
venture.** Dr. Ohene therefore decided to suspend any exports with effect from January 31,
2003 and to award no new contracts for procurement. Subsequently, by letter of February 6,
2003, Dr. Ohene requested Hamester to immediately send its notice of withdrawal from the
JVA. Mr. Holzapfel objected to Dr. Ohene’s directions by letter of February 7, 2003, noting
that

“Tt]he fact that Hamester wants to pull out, does not mean, that it already had pulled out, as
Hamester is still holding 60% of the shares until they have sold them.”

He further questioned Dr. Ohene’s power to issue directions under the JVA.

54. On February 10, 2003, Hamester informed the Minister of Finance of Ghana of its

intention to pull out of the joint-venture by March 31, 2003. Should the parties fail to agree

on the terms of the transfer of Hamester’s shares in Wamco before March 15, 2003, Hamester
stated that the “field is open for legal steps.”°’ Wamco and Cocobod met on February 14,
2003 to discuss the terms of temporary measures pending negotiations concerning
Hamester’s pull out. A document was drafted but signed only by Cocobod.*' On the same
date, in view of Hamester’s notice of its intention to withdraw from the JVA and Dr. Ohene’s
request to the Ministry of Finance to suspend Wamco’s exports, the Ministry wrote to

‘Wamco stating that:

“you are not to allow any shipment of cocoa in the name of WAMCO out of the country
except otherwise directed.”
55. Differences between the two joint-venture partners concerning the management of
‘Wamco continued with conflicting instructions to the Operating Manager. Mr. Holzapfel
sought to shut down the factories while Dr. Ohene ordered the continuation of production.
On March 8, 2003, Mr. Holzapfel, the Managing Director of Wamco, departed from Ghana.

According to the Respondent:

“(o)n 8 March 2003, Mr Holzapfel left Ghana without notice to the GCB or Wamco’s Board
and without the GCB or Wamco’s Board ever having been given an explanation for his
sudden departure.”°*

56. According to the Claimant, Mr. Holzipfel had to leave Ghana along with his family

because he:

“was made to fear for his own and his family’s safety and well being in Ghana as a result of
Cocobod’s actions and also by the Respondent apparently pursuing baseless allegations of
wrongdoing against Mr. Holzapfel with the intent of forcing the Claimant to abandon its
control over WAMCO and its rights under the JV Agreement.” o4

57. The alleged threatening actions consisted of an enquiry into an alleged fraud

committed in relation to a transaction concerning a German football club.

58. In Cocobod’s view, Mr. Holzapfel had thus abandoned his position as the Managing
Director of Wamco. Through lawyers in Germany, he continued to dispute decisions made

by Dr. Ohene. Ina letter of April 9, 2003, Hamester’s German counsel notified Cocobod that

18

it had breached Articles 4 and 7 of the JVA.® The letter attached a document entitled
“interim agreement” the terms of which had allegedly been agreed between Hamester and the
Ministry of Finance of Ghana. Hamester requested Cocobod to sign the document by April
11, 2003 or Hamester would commence legal action against it pursuant to the dispute-
settlement provisions of the JVA. On April 22, Cocobod stated that it would not sign the
agreement.” According to the Claimant, the Minister of Finance was at that time directly

instructing Wamco as to the operations of the company.”

59. On August 1, 2003, Mr. Holzapfel resigned from his function as Managing Director of
Wamco with immediate effect. By letter of October 8, 2003, Dr. Ohene authorised the
Operating Manager, Mr. Clement, to take on additional duties. While continuing to dispute
the authority of Cocobod representatives on the Wamco Board of Directors to interfere with
Wamco’s management, Hamester did not participate in Wamco’s affairs. The parties

disagree on whether or not Hamester repudiated the JVA in 2003 or abandoned Wamco.
F. Developments after 2003

60. According to the Respondent, Hamester was chronically indebted towards Wamco,
and the Claimant utilised manifold devices in order not to pay what it owed. In particular, the

Respondent states that:

“Moreover, Hamester’s indebtedness to Wamco for cocoa products supplied to Hamester had
reached €31,614,501.68 by early 2003. Hamester failed to make any payment to Wamco for
these products. Late in 2004, Hamester seized upon its traditional expedient of fabricating
debts owed by Wamco to Hamester to cancel out Hamester’s debts for the products taken
from Wamco. Without any explanation of the forward contracts as a result of which these
liabilities allegedly arose, Hamester suddenly sent Wamco two one-page invoices in German
for €18.7 million and €12,612,644.13, with a cover letter stating that they were “penalties for
the non-supply of products.” A third invoice for €300,526.47112 was also sent to Wamco. It
is undoubtedly no coincidence that Hamester’s penalty invoices come to €31,613,170.60 and
thus almost exactly cancel out Hamester’s debts to Wamco of €31.614 million.”

6l. The Claimant, for its part, contends that it was entitled to deduct amounts that it
considered as losses due to contractual failures of its joint-venture partner, from the sums
owed to it. As explained in the Claimant’s Post-Hearing Brief:

“Hamester was entitled to set-off its alleged losses against Wamco; and Wamco would be
entitled to pass these up to Cocobod by way of set-off, such to include loss of profits and

°° Exh. RC271.
® Exh. RC275.
°" Claimant’s Memorial, para. 145. Exh. C53.

19

penalties incurred by reason of being unable to fulfil its forward contracts. Of course, the
purported set-offs would not be conclusive as to liability or quantum. Such could be decided
only by a court enjoying appropriate jurisdiction. However, there being no prohibition on set-
off in the JVA, Wamco was entitled to withhold payment to Cocobod on the basis of such set-
offs. Accordingly, Wamco’s alleged failure to pay for supplies affords no lawful excuse for
Cocobod/Ghana to detain its goods.”®*
62. On May 14, 2004, Hamester submitted a Request for Arbitration against the Republic
of Ghana, represented by Cocobod, to ICSID on the basis of the dispute-settlement provision
of the JVA. The registration of the request was refused as the Centre found that there was
manifestly no consent given by the ROG to ICSID arbitration under the JVA, nor any
designation of Cocobod as a subdivision or an agency by the ROG for the purposes of Article
25(1) of the ICSID Convention, or any approval of Cocobod’s consent by the ROG for the

purposes of Article 25(3) of the ICSID Convention.

63. At a Wamco emergency Board meeting in London on March 2, 2005, it was suggested
that the dispute between Hamester, Wamco and Cocobod be resolved by arbitration, and that
Cocobod seek the approval of the ROG for commencing the arbitration.” Hamester also
informed the Board that there was potentially an interested buyer of its shares in Wamco.
Mr. Opferkuch later informed Cocobod that Hamester might itself be sold as a company,
instead of a transfer of its shares in Wamco, which would not have been possible under the

JVA without the approval of Cocobod.”°

64. On September 26, 2006, by a “final demand notice,” Wamco, through legal counsel,
demanded Hamester to pay EUR 31,614,501.68 for cocoa products supplied between
February 27, 2002 and January 24, 2003.7! In January 2007, Wamco submitted a statement
of claim before the Superior Court of Judicature in the High Court of Justice in Ghana
seeking to recover the amount.” Hamester and Mr. Opferkuch, the defendants in the
proceedings, contested the jurisdiction of the Superior Court and submitted a counter-claim
for their damages and loss of profit resulting from the alleged failure by Wamco to honour its

supply obligations.”* It is unclear whether the proceedings are still pending.

65. In November 2007, Cocobod and CMC jointly sought to recover USD 32,649,058.29

from Wamco. That law suit was settled and the settlement was incorporated in a judgment

providing that Wamco pay the entire amount of USD 32,649,058.29 and interest at 5% on
that sum from January 2003 to the date of final payment.”* Cocobod is entitled to enforce the

judgment against Wamco at any time.”°

66. In the meantime, in May 2007, the Claimant submitted its second Request for

Arbitration against the Republic of Ghana before ICSID, this time on the basis of the BIT.

67. On July 1, 2008, the Claimant transferred its 60% ownership in Wamco to Hosta

International AG, Muenchenstein, Switzerland.”©

Iv. SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES’ CLAIMS AND THE RELIEF SOUGHT
A. The Claimant’s position

68. The Claimant’s case is that it is entitled to damages as a result of alleged breaches by

the ROG of the BIT and of the JVA (through the application of the BIT).

69. In its Memorial, the Claimant claims, as a general statement, that the ROG has

breached the BIT, and in particular:

“(i) Article 9, which provides that the Government will observe obligations with regard to
investments (and which includes the obligations of Ghana Cocoa Board under the Joint
Venture Agreement).

(ii) Article 2(1), which guarantees fair and equitable treatment of investments.

(iii) Article 2(2), which prohibits impairing by arbitrary or discriminatory measures the
management, maintenance, use or enjoyment of investments.

(iv) Article 3(1), which prohibits less favourable treatment.

(v) Article 4(1), which guarantees full protection and security.

(vi) Article 4(2), which prohibits expropriation or measures equivalent to expropriation.”””

70. In terms of the specific acts of which the Claimant complains, the Memorial sets out a

detailed elaboration of conduct that is said to be a “Breach of the JV Agreement,” developed

™ Exh. RC333.
Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, para. 285.1.

Tribunal on April 27, 2010.

21

from paragraphs 82 to 151. The Memorial then goes on to describe alleged “Breaches of the

Treaty by the Respondent,” which are developed more briefly from paragraphs 152 to 169.

Among the alleged breaches of the Treaty, the first ones are particularised as “Breaches of

Article 9(2) — Breaches of the JV Agreement” (dealt with in paragraphs 152 to 154) — or, in

other words, the same allegations of breach of contract, elevated, according to the Claimant,

into treaty breaches by the “umbrella” clause. The contract claims which are said to have

been transformed into treaty claims are summarised by the Claimant as follows:

71.

“In breach of the JV Agreement the Respondent acting directly and/or via the state entity
Cocobod:

(i) Failed in violation of Article 7 of the JV Agreement to agree a price properly or at all
which would guarantee profitability of the Joint Venture for the Claimant

(ii) Failed in violation of Article 7 of the JV Agreement to provide properly or at all the
supplies of cocoa required and requested by WAMCO.

(iii) Failed to observe the agreed means of management of WAMCO and to allow the
Claimant to enjoy proper management of WAMCO without due interference.”

The very same three categories of acts are thereafter analysed “further and/or in the

alternative” as:

72.

(i) a violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard (FET) provided for in

Article 2(1) of the BIT (dealt with in paragraphs 155 to 161);

(ii) a violation of Article 2(2) of the BIT concerning arbitrary measures (dealt with in

paragraphs 162 and 163);

(iii) a violation of Article 3 of the BIT concerning national treatment (dealt with in

paragraph 164);

(iv) a violation of the full protection and security standard (FPS) provided for in

Article 4(1) (dealt with in paragraph 165); and finally

(v) a violation of Article 4 (2) and (3) dealing with expropriation and measures

having an effect equivalent to expropriation (dealt with in paragraphs 166 to 169).

In its Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimant sets out, again separately, alleged violations of

the JVA (Section 1), and of the Treaty (Section 2).

78 Claimant’s Memorial, para. 154.

22

723. According to Hamester, the principal breaches of the JVA, as analysed in Section | of

its Post-Hearing Brief, concern:””
(i) the suspension of bean deliveries from December 1, 2000;
(ii) the purported imposition of the 2001 Price Agreement;

(iii) __ the failure to deliver the required tonnage in 2002 and Cocobod’s general

refusal to honour its supply obligations under Article 7 of the JVA; and

(iv) _ the interference with Hamester’s management rights over Wamco via its

majority shareholding.

74. According to Section 2 of Hamester’s Post-Hearing Brief, the following acts and

omissions are said also to constitute breaches of the BIT:
(i) the purported imposition of the 2001 Price Agreement;
(ii) the failure to deliver the required tonnage in 2002;
(iii) the imposition of the export ban on Wamco’s products in January 2003;
(iv) _ the usurpation of Wamco’s management functions from January 2003 to date;
(v) the harassment of Mr. Holzapfel in 2002/2003.
75. The breaches of the JVA are, on the Claimant’s case, elevated to breaches of the BIT

through the “umbrella clause” in Article 9(2), which explains that the violations of the JVA

are also listed as so-called Treaty claims (i), (ii) and (iv).

76. Overall, only two complaints are not characterised as a violation of the JVA — the

export ban and Mr. Holzipfel’s alleged harassment.

77. All the acts complained of are, according to the Claimant, acts of the ROG. Some
have been performed by its Ministers or its police. As far as the acts of Cocobod are
concerned, the Claimant considers that they are attributable to the Respondent under
international law. Its position is that Cocobod is a State organ under Ghanaian law and
international law and that, therefore, its conduct is to be considered an act of the ROG.
Alternatively, Cocobod was exercising governmental authority or acted on the instructions of,

or under the control of, the ROG.

78. As a result of the breaches of the BIT, the Claimant asserts that it “has suffered

substantial losses in excess of € 100 million’*°

and claims:*! (i) compensation for losses due
to the non-supply of cocoa beans in 2002 in the total sum of EUR 33,045,031.29; (ii) loss of
profits from 2003 to 2008 in the sum of EUR 27,984,000.00; (iii) loss of share of Wamco’s
profits from 2002 to 2008 in the sum of EUR 13,396,555.00; and (iv) loss of future profits in
the range of EUR 37,768,000.00 to 67,042,000.00. In the alternative to (ii) and (iii),
Hamester claims the value of its shareholding in Wamco in 2001 prior to the alleged breaches

of the BIT, in the amount of EUR 18.3 million.
79. Accordingly, in its Memorial, the Claimant requests that the Tribunal:

“(i) Declare that the Respondent is in breach of the aforesaid Bilateral Investment Treaty
in the manner set out above.

(ii) Award the Claimant damages and interest thereon in the sums set out above.

(iii) Order that the Claimant’s costs and expenses of the reference herein and the costs and

9982

expenses of the Tribunal be paid by the Respondent.

B. The Respondent’s position

80. Ghana objects to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, and also rejects Hamester’s claims

on their merits.

81. | The Respondent’s main jurisdictional objection is that there was no “investment” in

accordance with Ghanaian law under Article 10 of the BIT. It alleges that the JVA was

® Claimant’s Memorial, para. 14.
*! Claimant’s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 110.
®? Claimant’s Memorial, para. 195.

24

procured by fraud and that the Claimant and Mr. Opferkuch continued to defraud Wamco and

Cocobod throughout the joint-venture.

82. The Respondent also objects to jurisdiction on the ground that certain alleged
breaches of the BIT, including the expropriation claim; the non-delivery claim; and the
alleged imposition of the 2001 Price Agreement, are not attributable to the ROG under
international law. Cocobod is not an organ of the State, but a public corporation set up as a
commercial venture under Ghanaian law. Cocobod exercised no governmental authority, and

there is no evidence that the ROG exercised any control over the specific conduct in question.

83. In addition, the Respondent disputes the Claimant’s interpretation of the “umbrella
clause” in Article 9(2) of the BIT. In the Respondent’s view, the provision does not cover

any contractual obligations under the JVA.

84. Even if there were jurisdiction and the acts complained of were attributable to the
ROG, the Respondent claims that Hamester’s case must fail on its merits, in light of the
factual evidence and the applicable law. In the Respondent’s submission, the facts show that
(i) Hamester was perfectly content with its commercial bargain (the 2001 Price Agreement)
until it no longer suited Mr. Opferkuch; (ii) there was a continuous failure by Hamester to

pay for goods supplied; and (iii) Hamester abandoned the joint-venture.

85. Consequently, by way of relief, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal:*

“373.1 DECLARE that Hamester’s claims are not within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal;

373.2 DECLARE, alternatively, that the Goverment has not breached any of its obligations
under this Treaty and dismiss all of MHamester’s claims in their entirety;

373.3. DECLARE, alternatively, that even if the Government has breached any of its
obligations under this Treaty that Hamester’s damages should be assessed at zero;

373.4. DECLARE, alternatively, that Hamester and/or Mr Opferkuch breached their
fiduciary duties to the GCB and/or Wamco and that Hamester breached the JVA;

373.5 DECLARE, alternatively, that Hamester repudiated the JVA in 2003 that the GCB has
no further contractual obligations under it and/or is entitled to terminate the JVA immediately

upon receipt of the Tribunal’s award;

373.6 ORDER Hamester to pay to the Government damages, moral or otherwise, for losses
it and/or the GCB have sustained as a result of Hamester’s conduct in such sum as the

85 Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, para. 373.

25

Tribunal during the course of this arbitral proceeding may determine as a result of its inquiry
into damages, plus interest per annum;

373.7 ORDER Hamester to pay in full the fees and expenses of the Arbitrators and all costs
in connection with this arbitration by the Government (including, without limitation, the fees
and expenses of all experts whether appointed by counsel or by the Tribunal, and all counsel’s
fees and expenses), as well as the costs charged by ICSID on a full indemnity basis plus
interest per annum accruing from the date on which the Government incurred the costs in
question until paid; and

373.8 AWARD the Government such further relief as the Tribunal may consider appropriate
in the circumstances of this case.”

V. THE LEGAL GROUNDS FOR JURISDICTION

86.

As is appropriate when jurisdictional objections are raised by a party, the Tribunal

will first analyse whether it has jurisdiction over the dispute under Article 25(1) of the ICSID

Convention and Article 12 of the BIT.

87.

The relevant jurisdictional requirements of the ICSID Convention are contained in its

Article 25, which reads, in pertinent part, as follows:

88.

“The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an
investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a
Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting
State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.”

The jurisdictional requirements of the BIT are contained in its Article 12, read

together with Articles 1 and 10. Article 12 provides in pertinent part, as follows:

89.

“(1) Disputes between a national or company of one Contracting Party and the other
Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the latter under this Treaty in relation to an
investment of the former shall as far as possible be settled amicably between the parties to the
dispute.

“(2) If the dispute cannot be settled within six months of the date of written notification by
one of the parties to the dispute, it shall be submitted for arbitration if either party to the
dispute so requests.

“(3) Unless the parties agree otherwise, the aggrieved party shall have the right to refer the
dispute to: (a) [ICSID] arbitration under the provisions of the [ICSID Convention].”

In addition, Article 1 and Article 10 of the BIT in turn define the “investments” that

are covered by the BIT.

26

Article 1 is the general definition clause:

“(1) _ the term “investments” comprises every kind of asset, in particular:
(a) movable and immovable property, as well as any other rights in rem such as
mortgages, liens and pledges;
(b) shares of companies and other kinds of interest in companies;

(c) claims to money which has been used to create an economic value or claims
to any performance having an economic value;

(d

copyrights, industrial property rights, technical processes, trade-marks, trade
names, know-how and good will;

(e) business concessions under public law, including concessions to search for,
extract and exploit natural resources ...

(2) the term “returns” means the amounts yielded by an investment for a definite period
such as profit, dividends, interest, royalties or fees.”

Article 10 adds that the Treaty applies to investments existing prior to the date of the Treaty:

“This Treaty shall also apply to investments made prior to its entry into force by nationals or
companies of either Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party consistent
with the latter’s legislation.”

90. The Tribunal notes that the Claimant had previously submitted to ICSID a request for
arbitration against the Respondent, based on the dispute-settlement clause in the JVA, the
registration of which was refused by the ICSID Secretariat.“* Therefore, the Claimant seeks
to found its case on the basis of the BIT, claiming both “pure” Treaty breaches (Articles 2, 3
and 4 of the BIT) and breaches of the JVA (through Article 9(2) of the BIT). These breaches,
the Claimant asserts, are attributable to the ROG through the conduct of its State organ,
Cocobod. Hamester alternatively claims that the acts complained of are sovereign acts of

Ghana.*°

91. The Respondent presents two principal jurisdictional objections. The first principal
objection is based on the principles of attribution under customary international law. The

Respondent considers that:

* See above, paras. 27 and 62.
§5 Claimant’s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 97.

27

“()he Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to consider Hamester’s claims because the conduct
complained of was that of the GCB, not of the Ghanaian state,”*°

This may be characterised as an objection based on the lack of jurisdiction ratione personae.

92. The second principal jurisdictional objection rests upon serious allegations that from
the very outset the investment was planned through fraud and breaches of fiduciary duty.*”
This may be characterised as an objection based on the lack of jurisdiction ratione materiae,
or, in other words, on the absence of a protected investment. Although presented in this order
in the general section of the Counter-Memorial, these submissions were then developed in
reverse order: 1. No investment in accordance with Ghanaian law (which will be addressed in
Section VI below); 2. No jurisdiction according to the principles of attribution (which will be

addressed in Section VII below).

93. Before considering the two principal jurisdictional objections, the Tribunal wishes to
address the Claimant’s sale in 2008 of its entire interest in Wamco to Hosta International AG.
On April 27, 2010, the Respondent submitted an undated letter from Hamester to Cocobod,
received by Cocobod on March 1, 2010, stating that:
“we want to inform you herewith that [Hamester] has transferred the owned 60% share capital
of West African Mills Ltd. (FZE), Takoradi to Hosta International AG, Muenchenstein,

Switzerland by the 1“ of July 2008. Since that date Hosta International is the shareholder and
owner of 60% of the share capital of West African Mills Ltd. Takoradi.”

The Respondent stated that the transfer was in contravention of the JVA and indicated that
the Tribunal should consider the implications it may have “on the arbitration and the
relationship between the parties.” The Claimant did not comment on the transfer, but did not

dispute that it was made.

94. Although the parties have made no submissions on the possible legal implications of
the transfer (other than an alleged breach of the JVA), the Tribunal is of the view that it
should, in accordance with Article 41(1) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule
41(2), examine whether the fact that the Claimant no longer owns the investment could result

in a lack of jurisdiction rationae personae.

95. Under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, jurisdiction is extended to a national of

a Contracting State. Juridical persons which are nationals of a Contracting State other than

*° Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, para. 10.
§7 Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, para. 12.

28

the respondent State must be so on the date on which the parties consented to submit such
dispute to arbitration (Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention). It is not contested that the
Claimant was a German national on the date of consent to arbitration. Nor can the
Claimant’s jus standi be affected by the fact that it no longer owns the shares. As noted in El
Paso v. Argentina, “no continuous ownership is required, as the ICSID Convention was
meant, among other things, to protect against nationalisations and expropriations, i.e. in cases
where the national no longer owns the investment but seeks compensation for having been
deprived of it by the host State.”** Consequently, although the Tribunal recognizes that there
may be legal implications concerning issues of quantum in a case in which the claimant no
longer owns the investment, it concludes that its jurisdiction is unaffected in this case.
Having reached this conclusion, the Tribunal nevertheless considers that Hamester should
have brought the fact to the Tribunal’s attention as soon as the transfer of the shares was

made.

VI. THE FIRST JURISDICTIONAL OBJECTION: FRAUD

96. As just stated, the Respondent objects to this Tribunal’s jurisdiction on the basis that
there was no “investment” in this case in accordance with Ghanaian law, for the purposes of
Article 10 of the BIT, because the investment was tainted with substantial fraud, both in its

initiation and in its performance throughout the years.

A. The Respondent’s position on the first jurisdictional objection: fraud

97. The allegations of fraud have been presented with varying emphasis, but great

insistence, as acknowledged by the Claimant, when noting that:

“the word ‘fraud’ or a derivative or synonym for it is used over 100 times in the pleading [the
Counter-Memorial].”*°

98. The Respondent’s Counter-Memorial focuses on what is said to have been “ruthless

and fraudulent oppression,””° by the Claimant, as the majority shareholder, of Cocobod, the

88 EI Paso Energy International Company v. Argentine Republic, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Decision on
Jurisdiction, April 27, 2006, para. 126.

minority shareholder, during the performance of the JVA. The Respondent viewed the

venture in a different light from the Claimant. It stated, for example, that:

frauds:

0)

(ii)

(iii)

100.

“(t)he very purpose underlying the JVA was clearly that Hamester and the GCB would each
receive a share of the overall profits generated by Wamco’s operations corresponding to each
party’s interest in Wamco (40% in the case of the GCB), not that Hamester would appropriate
up to 95.7% of the venture’s profits exclusively for itself”?!

According to the Respondent, the Claimant’s oppression is illustrated by multiple

Firstly, “Hamester was abusing its control over Wamco to take Wamco’s entire
output at artificially low prices and then — without taking delivery of Wamco’s
products or adding any value to them through further processing — selling them to its
own customers at a substantially higher price.””?;

Secondly, “(a)lthough Hamester purchased Wamco’s entire annual output and
retained the resale profits for itself, Hamester also charged Wamco sales fees and
commissions for selling all of Wamco’s products to itself. These fees at times

exceeded Wamco’s entire annual net profits. This was simply fraud.””*;

Thirdly, the Claimant “found a myriad of other unlawful means of extracting profits

from Wamco and running the company solely in [its] own interests,” and in particular:

“Mr Opferkuch caused Wamco to reduce Hamester’s debts to it in exchange for shares [the
Neuhaus shares] in a Belgian company which Wamco has never received. He caused Wamco
to transfer Wamco’s funds into his personal Swiss bank account by forcing Wamco to
purchase two buildings, for which Wamco has never received the title deeds. And when a
German football club which he sponsors had to pay a player transfer fee, Mr Opferkuch
caused the fee to be paid from Wamco’s funds ...

As if this were not enough, Hamester also persistently delayed payments to Wamco to the
point of jeopardising the company’s financial position and leaving it unable to pay for the
cocoa beans received from the GCB. As a result, the GCB at times found itself unable to pay
farmers for their cocoa deliveries. To date, Hamester still owes Wamco over € 31 million for
cocoa products which it took from Wamco in 2002-2003."°*

The Counter-Memorial provides more detail concerning the key transactions in

question.

101. Sale of Properties: | According to the Respondent, in June 2000, Mr. Opferkuch sold
two properties that he owned in Accra to Wamco, without Board approval and by simply
ordering Wamco’s staff to transfer USD 700,000 to his Swiss bank account.’* The
Respondent states that:

“(t)hese transactions represent a further gross breach of fiduciary duty by Mr Opferkuch, who
was at the relevant time a director of Wamco — or simply theft of Wamco’s funds.”°°

102. Neuhaus Shares: In late 2001, Hamester had accumulated a significant debt of DM
14.081 million towards Wamco for cocoa products delivered to it but not paid for. In order to
set off that debt, Hamester transferred 120,000 shares in Neuhaus, a Belgian chocolate
company, to Wamco. According to the Respondent, the purchase price, which equalled
Hamester’s debt of DM 14.081 million, exceeded the market value of the Neuhaus shares and
was not approved by Wamco’s Board of Directors.” In other words, while Cocobod badly

needed money for its activities,

“the debt of Hamester to Wamco was extinguished in late 2001 by the sale to Wamco of the
Neuhaus shares for the price of DM 14.081 million.”
Wamco has allegedly never received a share certificate showing the transfer nor any
distribution of dividends. On June 1, 2003, Mr. Holzipfel informed Wamco that the Neuhaus
shares had been sold back for EUR 2.52 million, which was a loss of approximately EUR 4.6
million.” The sale of the shares was allegedly not approved by Wamco’s Board. This whole

transaction was again the subject of stringent criticism in the Post-Hearing Brief:

“This astonishing circular sale and repurchase transaction simply transferred € 7.2 million
from Wamco to Hamester, without the Cocoa Board and its directors on Wamco’s board ever
being asked for their approval or having the details of the transaction explained to them. The
supposed € 2.52 million repurchase price has never in fact been paid to Wamco. The Neuhaus
transaction involved a flagrant, shameless and fraudulent breach of fiduciary duty.”!°°

103. Transfer of Football Player: In October 2000, Mr. Opferkuch mediated an
agreement for the transfer of a player (Mr. Justice Ampah) from a leading Ghanaian football
club to a German football club which was sponsored by the Claimant. According to the

Respondent, the transfer fee was paid by Wamco. Wamco’s employees appointed by

Hamester allegedly gave instructions that the company pay DM 30,000 each to the Ghanaian
football club and the Ghana Football Association, stating that the payment was being made
for “public relations” purposes.'! Furthermore, the Ghanaian football club issued an invoice
of DM 90,000 for “consulting services,” which was paid by Wamco. According to the
Respondent, Wamco, overall, paid a total of DM 150,000 as the transfer fee for Mr. Ampah —
a sum which should properly have been paid by the German football club. The incident was
reported as fraud and led to the arrest of Mr. Holzipfel. According to the Respondent,

despite promises by Mr. Opferkuch, the funds have not been repaid.'?

104. Subsequently, in June 2001, Mr. Ampah was appointed Deputy Production Manager
in Wamco’s “Confectionary Department,” for future confectionary imports and production in
Ghana.'> Mr. Ampah, who was then stationed in Germany, was allegedly added to Wamco’s
payroll as a new employee, with an annual salary of 83 million Ghanaian Cedis. The
Respondent claims that this is further evidence of fraud, as Wamco never had a

“Confectionary Department.”

105. False Invoice: Also, in one paragraph of the Counter-Memorial, a reference is made

to the falsification of an invoice, albeit without much elaboration on this issue:

“But as long ago as 1990, Hamester had drawn up a secret agreement for signature with the
machinery supplier de Smet Rosedowns Limited (“Rosedowns”), which expressly provided
that the discount of DM 497,625 which Hamester was to receive from Rosedowns on the
purchase price of DM 2,484,625 was not to appear on invoices and was not to be disclosed to
the GcB.”!™*

106. This issue was then heavily emphasised in the Rejoinder, with nineteen paragraphs

being devoted to it.

107. The Respondent presented two documents from 1990!

concerning an order for
“Expeller-Pressen,” from Hamester to De Smet Rosedowns. The first document is a
Purchase Order dated January 4, 1990 for the acquisition of the machinery for DM 1,987,000.
The second is a “Confidential Side Letter for the Purchase Order” dated January 12, 1990, in

which it is stated:

‘°! Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, para. 89. Exh. RC137.

“The Contractor will grant Schréder a confidential discount of DM 497, 625 on the
machinery/asset value of DM 2,484,625.00.

The discount shall not appear or be reflected in the invoices.

In addition to an invoice for 100%, Schréder shall receive a credit note for the difference from
the amounts that are actually paid.

The side letter shall be treated as strictly confidential and shall not be disclosed to any third

party (including Cocobod).”
108. The Respondent also emphasises that, during the Hearing, Mr. Opferkuch tried to shift
all responsibility for this transaction onto his father, and explained that the 20% discount
represented a “normal” remuneration for the German company’s extension of a loan, but had
no economic justification in the context of the JVA. After admitting that his father had
considered a 20% discount on the Loan Agreement, he stated that, when the JVA was
negotiated, there was no such discount:

“Tam 100% sure that at that time there was no 20% in sight, at that time not, because what

would be the sense to cheat us, ourself? I mean, that does not make any sense. Why we should

inflate the invoices for ourself by 20%? That is completely crazy. That does not make any
sense.”

109. In addition, a letter dated December 10, 1990, signed by Mr. Opferkuch and addressed
to the company De Smet Rosedowns, requested that the bills should not reflect the price
actually paid by Schréder:'°°

“DE SMET will invoice 100% while issuing a credit for 20% at the same time. No third party
— including also the Ghana Cocoa Board (WAM) — may learn of these 20%.”

110. The Respondent also pointed to a confidential letter dated February 12, 1991 sent by
the company De Smet Rosedowns to Hosta, explaining how to handle the 20% discount on
contracts for the rehabilitation of Wamco, to be given to Schréder but concealed from
Cocobod:'°”

“The way the 20% is organised to-day (see your letter ... dated 10. 12 1990) is not safe for
both of us.

1) Our fiscal authorities consider that automatic credit notes on invoices are secret
commissions and they tax us 200%. So unacceptable for us.

2) What they accept: discounts, BUT these discounts are to figure ON the invoice.
This is of course unacceptable for you as COCOBOD will see the net price.

' Exh. RC381.
7 Exh. RC382.

33

3) What we propose is to sign an agency contract with HOSTA for the Schréder
contract.
This agency contract will specify that HOSTA is entitled to get 20% commission on
each amount paid by Schréder. On a legal point of view it is 100% safe for you and
for us.”
111. Other Allegations: |The Respondent also relied upon allegations as to fraudulent
resale benefits (noted earlier), as well as the other violations of fiduciary duty set out in the

Counter-Memorial.

112. JVA Itself Procured by Fraud: — Finally in its Post-Hearing Brief, the Respondent
again emphasises its allegation that “(t)he JVA was procured by fraud”. According to the
Respondent:

“it is clear that Hamester induced the Cocoa Board to enter into the JVA through a fraudulent
misrepresentation.”

B. The Claimant’s position on the first jurisdictional objection: fraud

113. The Claimant asserts that it has made an “investment” and that

“(a)side from the issue of legality, there is no dispute by Ghana that Hamester’s investments
otherwise qualify as investments defined under the BIT and under the Convention.”!
In particular, it is stated in the Request for Arbitration that Hamester’s investment fulfils the
different factors that may be taken into account towards the characterisation of an investment:
contribution by the investing party; duration; risk; and contribution to the economic

development of the host State.!!°

114. As far as the conformity of its investment with Ghanaian legislation is concerned,

Hamester accepts in principle that:

“qualifying investments must have been made in substantial compliance with the substantive
provisions of Ghanaian law.”!

115. Applying this to the facts of the case, the Claimant argues that its investment was in
full compliance with Ghanaian law. The Claimant refutes any allegation of fraud committed

by Hamester in effectuating its investment in 1992. Moreover, it does not consider that the

' Request for Arbitration, para. 40.

'! Claimant’s Reply, para. 79.

34

profits made under the forward contracts during the operation of the investment can be

analysed as a violation of the fiduciary duties owed to a partner in a joint-venture, as:

“(t)here was no profit sharing agreement between Cocobod and Hamester under the JVA nor
was Hamester obliged to account for its resale profits to Cocobod under the IVA”!
116. The Claimant does not deny having made enormous profits by the resale, but does not

see anything wrong in this situation. According to Hamester:

“Ghana’s Counter-Memorial does not point to any article in the JVA whereby Hamester was
to share with Cocobod its profits from marketing and re-sale of the processed cocoa or its end
products outside Ghana.”""3

In fact, the Claimant asserts that:

“(t)he primary economic value of Hamester’s investment was in the supply of Wamco
products to Hamester for forward sales.”!'4

Mr. Opferkuch even declared somewhat bluntly in his Second Witness Statement that:

“IT would never have committed Schroeder/Hamester to an agreement whereby Hamester
would ... somehow agree that the money it made from selling on the processed beans realized
from its ongoing investment would be shared with Ghana. This is complete nonsense.”!!°

117. In its Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimant also explains that “Hamester does not assert an

entitlement to be supplied with Wamco’s products,”!'®

but that such practice developed with
the full knowledge of Cocobod. It appears indeed that most of the profits made by Hamester
were due to its resale of Wamco’s products, according to its own statements. In its
Memorial, it is stated that “(d)uring the four years prior to 2002, Hamester made on average
annual profits in the sum of EUR 4,664,000.00 from the re-sale of WAMCO products,” while
the profits from its shareholding in Wamco were less, i.e. “Hamester’s average annual 60%

share computes to EUR 1,792,748.00.”! 0

118. Overall, none of the complaints raised by the Respondent concerning the Claimant’s
intention to use the JVA for its sole benefit seem to impress the Claimant, which, to the
contrary, asserts more than once in its submissions that it was indeed the purpose of the joint-

venture to work to its exclusive benefit, and not to the shared benefit of both partners. Hence

it is stated in the Claimant’s Memorial that the “fundamental purpose of the JV Agreement
was to supply cocoa at a price ensuring a profit to the Claimant.”!'® This has been stated
repeatedly by the Claimant, for example, when complaining about the request of Cocobod to
use FOB prices, which according to it was “in breach of the express requirements of Article 7
of the JV Agreement and also in breach of the stated purpose of the JV Agreement to

guarantee a properly profitable venture for the Claimant.”!””

Quite noticeable also, in order
to understand the state of mind of the Claimant’s management, is a letter dated March 9, 2001
from Hamester to Cocobod'”° which included the Claimant’s proposal for amendment of the
JVA concerning supply and pricing of cocoa beans. In this letter, Hamester proposes that
“Cocobod shall deliver cost-neutral (farmgate + costs). In other words the delivery to

‘Wamco shall neither generate a profit nor a loss to Cocobod.”

119. The Claimant’s Post-Hearing Brief argues that the Respondent’s allegations of fraud
are not a valid defence to claims under the BIT. According to the Claimant, the claims of
fraud, if established, are matters of company law which must be contested in Ghanaian

courts.'?! The Claimant, however, denies that any fraud was perpetrated.

120. Sale of Properties: As to the two properties sold by Mr. Opferkuch to Wamco in
2000, the Claimant states that the transfer made sense because one of them was used as a
guesthouse, and the price reflected a reasonable market value. In addition, the Claimant
asserts that one of the acquisitions was mentioned at a Wamco Board meeting before the

transaction was made.

121. Transfer of Football Player: The Claimant further rebuts the Respondent’s
allegations in respect of the transfer fee for the Ghanaian football player, which was allegedly
paid by Wamco. According to the Claimant, a payment of DM 30,000 by Wamco to a
Ghanaian football club and to the Ghana Football Association was made for public purposes,
because the Chair of the Club was an important political actor who might assist Wamco in its
negotiations with the Government. A further payment to the football club of DM 90,000 was
also justified for the same reasons.'”? According to the Claimant, the football player’s

subsequent appointment as an employee of Wamco did not lead to any expense for the

company, but was made for the purpose of assisting the player to obtain a visa at the German
Consulate. Hamester claims that the true relevance of the football club payments in this case

is its use as an excuse for the Respondent’s harassment of Mr. Holzapfel and the Claimant.

122. Neuhaus Shares: As to the sale by Hamester to Wamco of shares in a Belgian
chocolate factory, Neuhaus, the Claimant does not deny the substance of the transaction. In

its Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimant states that it is:

“accepted that Wamco did not pay for the shares but instead set off the purchase value

against sums owed by Hamester to Wamco,”!?3
Moreover, the Claimant asserts that Wamco and Cocobod were informed of the transaction,
which is supported by Wamco’s 2001 accounts. Mr. Holzipfel testified that he had approval
by a majority of the Wamco Board at the time the shares were acquired, and that the purchase
was seen as a beneficial step for Wamco. The subsequent sale of the shares was allegedly
also approved by the Board of Wamco and entered into its accounts. On Hamester’s case, the
shares were neither overvalued at the time of purchase nor undervalued at the time of sale.
Therefore, even if the Respondent’s claim was relevant, it has failed to establish any fraud or

breach of fiduciary duty.

C. The Tribunal’s position on the first jurisdictional objection: fraud

123. The Tribunal considers, as was stated for example in Phoenix v. Czech Republic, that:

“States cannot be deemed to offer access to the ICSID dispute settlement mechanism to
investments not made in good faith”!
An investment will not be protected if it has been created in violation of national or
international principles of good faith; by way of corruption, fraud, or deceitful conduct; or if
its creation itself constitutes a misuse of the system of international investment protection
under the ICSID Convention. It will also not be protected if it is made in violation of the host

State’s law (as elaborated, e.g. by the tribunal in Phoenix).

124. These are general principles that exist independently of specific language to this effect

in the Treaty.

'3 Claimant’s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 204.
4 Phoenix Action, Ltd. v. Czech Republic, ICSID Case No. ARB/Q6/5 (Israel/Czech Republic BIT), Award,
April 15, 2009, para. 106.

37

125. In addition, however, it is clear that States may specifically and expressly condition
access of investors to a chosen dispute settlement mechanism, or the availability of
substantive protection. One such common condition is an express requirement that the
investment comply with the internal legislation of the host State. This condition will
typically appear in the BIT where this is the instrument that contains the State’s consent to
ICSID arbitration. The precise effect of any such express condition will obviously depend

upon the wording used.

126. In this case, Article 10 of the BIT contains an express requirement for compliance
with the host State’s legislation. It states that:

“[t]his Treaty shall also apply to investments made prior to [the Treaty’s] entry into force by

nationals or companies of either Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting

Party consistent with the latter’s legislation.” (Emphasis added).
127. The Tribunal considers that a distinction has to be drawn between (1) legality as at the
initiation of the investment (“made”) and (2) legality during the performance of the
investment. Article 10 legislates for the scope of application of the BIT, but conditions this
only by reference to legality at the initiation of the investment. Hence, only this issue bears
upon this Tribunal’s jurisdiction. Legality in the subsequent life or performance of the
investment is not addressed in Article 10. It follows that this does not bear upon the scope of
application of the BIT (and hence this Tribunal’s jurisdiction) — albeit that it may well be
relevant in the context of the substantive merits of a claim brought under the BIT. Thus, on
the wording of this BIT, the legality of the creation of the investment is a jurisdictional issue;
the legality of the investor’s conduct during the life of the investment is a merits issue. In the
Tribunal’s view, the broader principle of international law identified in paragraphs 123-124
above does not change this analysis of Article 10, and in particular its distinction between

legality at different stages of the investment.

128. It may be noted that the award in Fraport v. Philippines was particularly clear on this
distinction. Although the question was not raised by the facts of that case, the respondent
State had contended that in principle “an investment, in order to maintain jurisdictional
standing under the BIT, must not only be ‘in accordance’ with relevant domestic law at the
time of commencement of the investment but must continuously remain in compliance with

domestic law, such that a departure from some laws or regulations in the course of the

38

operation of the BIT would deprive a tribunal under the BIT of jurisdiction.”'?° The tribunal
considered it appropriate to clarify this point of law, and presented the following analysis,

with which this Tribunal is in full agreement:

“Although this contention is not relevant to the analysis of the problem which the Tribunal
has before it, namely the entry of the investment and not the way it was subsequently
conducted, the Tribunal would note that this part of the Respondent's interpretation appears to
be a forced construction of the pertinent provisions in the context of the entire Treaty ... the
effective operation of the BIT regime would appear to require that jurisdictional compliance
be limited to the initiation of the investment. If, at the time of the initiation of the investment,
there has been compliance with the law of the host state, allegations by the host state of
violations of its law in the course of the investment, as a justification for state action with
respect to the investment, might be a defense to claimed substantive violations of the BIT, but
could not deprive a tribunal acting under the authority of the BIT of its jurisdiction.”!7°
(Emphasis in the original)'?’

129. Therefore, in this first step of the analysis of the case relating to jurisdiction, the
Tribunal is only concerned with allegations of fraud in the initiation of the investment, and
not with the multiple allegations of fraudulent conduct during the life of the investment:
violations of the fiduciary duties owed to its partner in a joint-venture; violations of the
Ghanaian criminal law and so on, allegedly committed by the Claimant in the performance of
the JVA, during the years of its existence. In order to ascertain jurisdiction, the only question
here is whether Hamester perpetrated a fraud, and thereby procured the signing of the JVA

128

(as was the case, for example, in Jnceysa v. El Salvador, ~* where the contract was procured

through fraudulent misrepresentation). If the JVA was obtained on the basis of fraud, it is an
illegal investment that does not benefit from the protection of the ICSID/BIT mechanism.
However, the question whether fraudulent behaviour has been committed during the
performance of the joint-venture is a different issue that has to be taken into account when

judging the merits of the dispute.

130. The main contention of the Respondent concerning the illegality of the initial

investment is that:

27 This distinction was also endorsed by Mr. Bernardo Cremades in his dissenting opinion in Fraport, where he
stated: “As a matter of principle, therefore, the legality of the investor's conduct is a merits issue. The inquiry at
the jurisdictional phase required by the phrase «in accordance with the laws and regulations of the Host State»
is limited to determining whether the type of asset is legal in domestic law,” para. 38.

"8 Inceysa Vallisoletana S.L v. Republic of El Salvador, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/26, Award, August 2, 2006.

39

“(he documents in this arbitration confirm that Hamester presented false invoices to the
GCB and to Wamco and that Hamester did indeed obtain loan repayments from Wamco to
which it was not entitled. Messrs Opferkuch and Erhardt and Hamester thereby committed
the felony of obtaining property by false pretences, in contravention of section 131 of Ghana’s
Criminal Code of 1960. They also breached Ghana’s common law rules against fraud and the
statutory fiduciary duties under the Companies Code 1963.79

As a result of this alleged scheme by Hamester to defraud its partner, the Respondent argues

that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over Hamester’s claims:
“The very core of Hamester’s so-called investment activities in Ghana — the modernisation of
Wamco I, largely through the installation of new machinery — was thus from the outset
planned and executed fraudulently. That is fatal to Hamester’s case in this arbitration, since
investments not made in accordance with Ghanaian law fall outside the GGBIT by virtue of
Article 10. Fraudulent investments are in any event repugnant to the fundamental principle of
good faith under international law.”!

131. The Tribunal must thus examine whether the investment was illegal from its very

inception, because of the foreign investor’s alleged fraudulent behaviour in manipulating the

invoices for the machinery to be transferred to Wamco under the JVA.

132. Having carefully considered all the evidence, the Tribunal considers that the
Respondent has not fully discharged its burden of proof in this regard. It certainly appears
from the documents in the record that Hamester over-stated an invoice sent to Cocobod for
some of the machinery it had to provide for the rehabilitation of Wamco I. Based on the
documents in the record, this inflation (or failure to record a discount) goes back to one
operation initiated in January 1990, when Mr. Opferkuch Senior was still alive, and when the
scheme for the rehabilitation was based on a Loan Agreement and did not envisage a joint-
venture.'*! Mr. Opferkuch stated during the Hearing that the discount in question (which was
not reflected in the invoice) stopped after the death of his father in February 1990. However,
the evidence shows differently as at least this particular operation was finalised at the time of

the JVA.

133. The discounts seem indeed to have been put in place without Cocobod’s knowledge,
as is evidenced by three documents. The first is the invoice No. 9184 dated April 30, 1991
for an amount of DM 2,535,499.00, issued by De Smet Rosedowns to Schréder for

machinery to be forwarded to West African Mills Lat. '32 The second is a document dated

May 8, 1991'*3 which refers to a “(r)eduction in our invoice N° 9184” for a total of DM
548,499.00. The third document dated April 30, 1991 indicates what was conveyed to Ghana
at the time of the import into the country. In the “Combined Certificate of Value and Invoice
in respect of goods for importation in Ghana,” De Smet Rosedowns indicates that the invoice
amounting to DM 2,535,499.00 “is in all respect correct and contains a true and full statement
of the price actually paid or to be paid for the said goods.” And, presumably for the

avoidance of any doubt, this is then expanded in the following terms:

“De Smet ... certifies as follows

That no different invoice of the goods mentioned in the said invoice has been or will be
furnished to anyone; and that no arrangement or understanding affecting the purchase price of
the said goods has been or will be made or entered into between exporter and purchaser or by
anyone on behalf of either of them either by way of discount, rebate, compensation or in any
manner whatsoever other than as fully shown in this invoice.”
134. This may imply that all invoices were dealt with in the same manner, but the Tribunal
has not been provided with any other evidence concerning the fraud in the initial investment
in the JVA. In addition, the total amount of Hamester’s investment in Wamco — even if one
considers the Respondent’s position that the amounts were lower than the ones asserted by
the Claimant — was significantly higher than the relevant invoice. The Tribunal can only

decide on substantiated facts, and cannot base itself on inferences.

135. Moreover, there is no conclusive evidence proving that Cocobod would not have
entered into the joint-venture had it known that some of the figures were overstated. In other
words, there is no proof that the alleged fraud was decisive in securing the JVA. For
example, Ghana complains that the initial investment only had a value of DM 13,567,600.00
while Cocobod was told that the value of the machinery was DM 15,830,005.00, which is
close to the total estimated amount of the investment in the project, as set forth in Article 3.2
of the JVA. However, this article refers to an Appendix I which was to detail the investment.
The Tribunal has not been provided with Appendix I and the Respondent stated in its Post-
Hearing Brief that “(t)he Government has been unable to locate any such document.”'*
There is no indication of the valuation of the factory provided by Cocobod to Wamco, nor
has the Tribunal been provided with the financing plan, which according to Article 3.3 of the

JVA was to be set out in Appendix II but was not submitted with the JVA.

3 Exh. RC385.
'4 Respondent’s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 22.

41

136. Absent further information as to the Claimant’s alleged behaviour and on the different
parameters of the initial balance between the assets transferred by Hamester and those
transferred by Cocobod, there is insufficient basis for the Tribunal to conclude that there was

an overall scheme of deceit orchestrated by the Claimant in the initiation of its investment.

137. In any event, and more importantly, even if the alleged scheme to inflate invoices was
fully proven — with details in respect of invoices for all deliveries of machinery or services —
the Tribunal would still not be prepared to analyse these practices as amounting to a fraud
such as to deprive the Tribunal of its jurisdiction in the present case. According to the
Respondent, this would make “the present case indistinguishable from Inceysa v. El

Salvador,”! 6

where the Tribunal declined jurisdiction because the contractor had caused the
Government of El Salvador to award it a contract by misrepresenting its finances and
qualifications. The Tribunal does not agree. As noted above, it was not established by the
Respondent that Cocobod would not have entered into the JVA if it had known that Hamester
was making a pre-profit on its contribution. The Tribunal accepts the Claimant’s statement

that:

“(t)here is not a single witness from Ghana attesting to the alleged fraudulent action having

induced the JVA as was the case with the misrepresentations in the Inceysa and Klockner

cases.”
138. Hamester’s practices might not be in line with what could be called “/’éthique des
affaires,” but, in the Tribunal’s view, they did not amount, in the circumstances of the case,
to a fraud that would affect the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. The Tribunal sees the over-statement
of invoices as an issue bearing upon the balance of equities between the two parties, rather
than the existence itself of the contract or the investment. Such elements would have been
taken into consideration by the Tribunal when discussing the merits, if it had found that any

compensation was due to Hamester.

139. In conclusion, the Tribunal does not consider that the dispute concerning Hamester’s
investment in Ghana is outside its jurisdiction because the initial investment was fraudulent,

as argued by the Respondent.

VII. THE SECOND “JURISDICTIONAL OBJECTION”: NON-ATTRIBUTION - A GENERAL

APPROACH

140. The second jurisdictional objection advanced by the Respondent is based on an
analysis of the different acts complained of, which the Respondent does not consider to be
attributable to the ROG. The question whether the issue of attribution is, in a given case, one

of jurisdiction or of merits is not, in the Tribunal’s view, susceptible of a clear-cut answer.

141. Fora jurisdictional objection to prosper, it has to be such a definitive impediment that
the Tribunal has no right to entertain, or enquire into, the dispute. If, for example, one takes
the jurisdictional requirements ratione personae as set out in Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention, i.e. that the dispute is a legal dispute between a Contracting State of the ICSID
Convention and investors of another Contracting State, the determinative criteria are clear
and easily answered: the two Parties must respectively be a foreign investor from a
Contracting State, and a Contracting State, for jurisdiction to exist. Here, as jurisdiction
depends on the German/Ghana BIT, the Tribunal can deal with a dispute between the German
company Hamester and the Republic of Ghana. In other words, if Hamester was not a
German company, or if the case had been brought against a State other than Ghana, there

would evidently have existed a clear jurisdictional objection.

142. Not all issues, however, are so discrete or easily answered. Many ~ as is the case with
attribution — entail more complex considerations, which could be characterised both as
jurisdictional and relevant to the merits (and so to be considered only if the Tribunal has

jurisdiction).

143. In order to clarify the distinction between a jurisdictional question and a merits’
question, it is useful to consider the different burden of proof required for each. If
jurisdiction rests on the existence of certain facts, they have to be proven at the jurisdictional
stage. However, if facts are alleged in order to establish a violation of the relevant BIT, they
have to be accepted as such at the jurisdictional stage, until their existence is ascertained (or
not) at the merits stage. The question of “attribution” does not, itself, dictate whether there
has been a violation of international law. Rather, it is only a means to ascertain whether the
State is involved. As such, the question of attribution looks more like a jurisdictional

question. But in many instances, questions of attribution and questions of legality are closely

4B

intermingled, and it is then difficult to deal with the question of attribution without a full

enquiry into the merits.

144. In any event, whatever the qualification of the question of attribution, the Tribunal
notes that, as a practical matter, this question is usually best dealt with at the merits stage, in
order to allow for an in-depth analysis of all the parameters of the complex relationship
between certain acts and the State. This is the same approach as that adopted in Jan de Nul v.
Egypt, where the tribunal held that, according to the usual prima facie test at the jurisdictional
level:

“it is not for the Tribunal at the jurisdictional stage to examine whether the case is in effect

brought against the State and involves the latter’s responsibility. An exception is made in the

event that it is manifest that the entity involved has no link whatsoever with the State.”!°7
145. This approach — to deal with the question of attribution as a merits question — is
particularly appropriate, in the Tribunal’s view, in this case. The Tribunal is not faced here
with a situation where it is readily evident that the State is not involved at all, or where the
issue is capable of an answer based upon a limited enquiry (akin to other jurisdictional
issues). On the contrary, the evidential record in this case is more complex. In fact, the
Respondent itself recognises that some acts are attributable to the Ghanaian Government,

8

while denying that they amount to international illegal behaviour'*®, In other words, while

the extent of the State’s involvement is unclear, it is not contested that some acts are
attributable to Ghana. In such a situation, the Tribunal considers that it has jurisdiction over
the case brought against Ghana and jurisdiction to decide which acts are attributable and

which are not.

146. As the Tribunal has not accepted bifurcation and has joined the jurisdictional
objections to the merits, it now has the benefit of the parties’ full pleadings in order to deal

with the question of attribution in any event.

87 Jan de Nul N.V. and Dredging International N.V. v. Arab Republic of Egypt, \CSID Case No. ARB/04/13,
Decision on Jurisdiction, June 28, 2006, para. 85. Another exception, where tribunals have dealt with the
question of attribution at the jurisdictional level, is when the Parties have fully pleaded it at that stage. A good
example is the Decision on jurisdiction in Salini Costruttori S.p.A. and Italstrade S.p.A. v. Kingdom of Morocco,
ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4, July 23, 2001, para. 30.

'38 Tn the Respondent’s Reply, while not denying that some acts are indeed attributable, the Respondent states:
“There are no acts of the Government itself which could possibly provide a factual basis for Hamester’s
Expropriation Claim, because all of the acts listed in paragraph 174 above are entirely justified or simply
inconsequential,” para. 175.

44

147. In order to constitute a violation of the BIT, an act has to be both attributable to the
State and a violation of an international obligation provided for in the BIT. Sometimes, the
two questions of attribution and illegality are not clearly distinguished, but the Tribunal
considers that they should be. Therefore, the first question to be addressed is the question of
attribution of certain acts to the State. As States are juridical persons, the question
necessarily arises whether acts committed by natural persons or separate entities, which are
allegedly in violation of international law, are attributable to the State. Only after such
analysis has answered this question in the affirmative, may the Tribunal address the second
question, which is the qualification of the act attributed to the State as an illegal act. The
question of attribution/non-attribution will be dealt with in Sections VIII and IX, and the

question of legality/illegality in Sections X and XI.

A. The Claimant’s position on the question of attribution

148. To summarise the Claimant’s position is simple: it considers that Cocobod must be
completely assimilated to the Government of Ghana. The analysis leading to this conclusion

has, however, been somewhat imprecise and has evolved in the course of the case.

149. In the Request for Arbitration, the analysis of Cocobod’s nature is brief. According to
the Claimant, because Cocobod is controlled by the State and is empowered by internal law
to carry out rights and obligations in relation to the cocoa industry in Ghana which would

otherwise be undertaken by the State, it follows that:

“(from a structural point of view, Cocobod is accordingly a State entity. In discharging
essentially governmental functions delegated to it by the State, Cocobod also satisfied the
functional requirement of a State entity. Under applicable principles of international law, the
satisfaction of the structural and functional tests demonstrate conclusively that Cocobod is a
State entity. Accordingly for the purpose of the BIT, Cocobod is the Government of the
Republic of Ghana ...”

150. In its Memorial, the Claimant starts by presenting Cocobod as “a monopolistic
statutory public body with administrative responsibility for controlling and regulating the

140

cocoa industry in Ghana, and, after analyzing the Ghana Cocoa Board Law of 1984

creating Cocobod, concludes that:

'89 Request for Arbitration, paras 15-16.
‘9 Claimant’s Memorial, para. 35.

45

“Cocobod meets both the structural test of State creation, ownership and control and the
functional test of performing activities of a governmental nature. Cocobod is a state entity
acting at all material times on behalf of the Respondent.

The actions and omissions of Cocobod complained of in this Memorial are actions and
omissions by Cocobod as a state entity carrying out governmental functions.

Further the obligations undertaken by Cocobod under the JV Agreement are obligations
undertaken by the Respondent towards the Claimant under Article 9(2) of the Treaty.”
(Emphasis added)'*!

It therefore seems that the Claimant considers that the acts of Cocobod, a State entity, are
attributable to the Government as sovereign acts. Furthermore, it considers that, as contractual
acts, they are capable of violating the obligation in Article 9(2) of the BIT to respect contractual
obligations undertaken by the Government. A few paragraphs later, without any legal analysis,

the Claimant also states that Cocobod “at all times acted as an organ of the Respondent.”!”

151. In its Reply, the Claimant’s analysis is expanded, but the main contention seems to be

that Cocobod is a State organ, either de jure or de facto.

152. A reference is made, in order to prove that it is a de jure organ to, among others,
Article 195 of the Ghana Constitution which empowers the President to appoint persons to
act in public service office and to Section 32 of the 1984 Law creating Cocobod, which

states:

“The Minister [responsible for Trade] may, after consultation with the directors or the
management give to the Board in writing directions of a general character which are not
inconsistent with this Act or with the contractual or any other legal obligations of the Board
relating to the performance of its functions and the Board shall give effect to those
directions.”

153. The Claimant also relies on Eureko v. Poland’ as well as Jan de Nul NV v. Egypt.'“

The latter case was the subject of extensive discussion, on the basis of which the Claimant
has endeavoured to distinguish the different aspects of the Suez Canal Authority’s (SCA)

situation from that of Cocobod.

143

46

154. Relying on the ICJ decisions in Bosnia v. Serbia'* and Nicaragua v. United States of

America," the Claimant also seems to suggest that Cocobod was an organ de facto of the

Government, being in complete dependence on, or at least unable to function independently

from, the Government:

“... Cocobod, as a creature of statute, has its Board appointed by Government, received its
starting funds and capital from Government, requires Government approval to set up a
budget, establish (sic) credits and loans, has to follow Government pricing and so on. It
cannot properly be argued that Cocobod can function independently of Government.”!*7

155. After analysing the status of Cocobod in light of Article 4 of the ILC Article, the

Claimant asserts that:

“(further and/or in the alternative to the position under Article 4 ILC, above, Cocobod was in
all material instances exercising governmental authority such that the acts complained of by
Hamester are attributable to Ghana under Article 5 ILC.”!*

156. According to the Claimant, not only was Cocobod entrusted with governmental
functions, but its acts in relation to Hamester were all acts performed in the exercise of
governmental functions. The Claimant sees the hand of the Government in all of Cocobod’s

dealings with Hamester, and considers that:

“(t)he expropriation of and interference with Hamester’s corporate governance rights were
part of a plan by the Government acting through Cocobod to remove or diminish a foreign
company’s [Hamester’s] control and holding in Wamco under the JVA.”

157. To support this analysis, the Claimant again seeks to distinguish Jan de Nul, and relies
upon Nykomb v. The Republic of Latvia.'*° In this latter case, the acts of the State enterprise
Latvenergo were considered attributable to the State, because, among others, “Latvenergo
had no commercial freedom. It had no freedom to negotiate electricity prices Pl The

Claimant also invokes Noble Ventures v. Romania,” in which the tribunal assimilated a

governmental agency with the government, on the basis that they both exercised

governmental functions.
158. Further still, the Claimant submits that:

“(i)f contrary to Hamester’s case above, the acts and omissions complained of are not
attributable to Ghana under Article 4 and/or Article 5 ILC, these acts and omissions are
attributable to Ghana under Article 8 ILC”!

159. The Claimant argues that “the fact of State instruction and direction or ‘effective

control’ ... is objectively established,”!™* without elaborating on the basis for this conclusion.

160. As noted by the Respondent in its Rejoinder, the Claimant’s analysis, overall, is

somewhat unclear, as “Hamester appears to be confusing ILC Article 5 with Articles 4 and

7155

161. In fact, the Claimant’s analysis extends even further, since it also relies upon Article 2
of the ILC Articles. This article provides that an internationally wrongful act of a State can
consist of an action or omission. The Claimant argues that, because of this article, the other
articles on attribution are not even necessary, as there was, corresponding to each act of
Cocobod, an omission of the Ghanaian Government to prevent it from so acting:

“Tt should be uncontroversial that internationally wrongful acts may comprise both acts and
omissions: see ILC Article 2 ILC.

At the very least Ghana omitted to direct Cocobod against the actions complained of by
Hamester. Such direction would have been binding upon Cocobod under the 1984 Law.

Each of these omissions constitutes an internationally wrongful act under Article 2 in breach
of Ghana’s obligations under the BIT.

If Hamester’s case in this regard is correct, no question of attribution under Article 4 arises, as
the omissions are by Ghana itself.”

162. In summary, the Claimant presents four alternative analyses of the status of Cocobod,

based respectively on Articles 4, 5, 8 and 2 of the ILC Articles.

Law Commission’s Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts.”!%7

164. The Respondent denies that Cocobod can be qualified as an organ of the State — either
de jure or de facto — and that the acts of Cocobod complained of can be attributed to Ghana,
stating that “it is obvious that the GCB is not a state organ,”'** under Article 4 of the ILC
Articles. Further, the Respondent argues that Cocobod’s acts are not attributable to the ROG

under Article 5 of the ILC Articles.
165. According to the Respondent:

“GCB is a commercial trading corporation, although it has certain monopoly rights and
regulatory powers. Its primary function is to purchase cocoa beans from Ghanaian cocoa
farmers and, through its subsidiary, the Cocoa Marketing Company Limited ("CMC"), to sell
them on the world market for a profit. The GCB is run as a commercial enterprise 2?
166. As to Article 4 of the ILC Articles, the Respondent contends that Cocobod is not a
State organ, either de jure, as it has a separate legal personality, or de facto. The Respondent
refers to the analysis of the status of the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) in the award on the
merits in Jan de Nul NV v. Egypt,'° which concluded that structurally the SCA was not a
State organ, arguing that “(t)he position of the GCB under Ghanaian law is essentially

identical to that of the SCA under Egyptian law.”'®!

167. Although, according to the Respondent, Cocobod can be considered a public entity
under Article 5 of the ILC Articles, because it has some governmental powers under the GCB
Law, such as the power under section 34(2)(a) to “make regulations ... prescrib[ing] the form
of all licences or permits to be issued under this Law,” the acts complained of by the
Claimant have not been performed in the exercise of such governmental authority. The
Respondent insists that the performance of an act in the exercise of governmental authority is

a necessary condition for it to be attributable to the State. It relies on the award in Maffezini

v. Spain for this proposition, | which has been, in its view, misinterpreted by the Claimant.

In the Respondent’s view, with respect to all Cocobod’s acts complained of:

“it is immediately obvious that these were all purely private and commercial acts which were
not done under the exercise or purported exercise of any specific governmental power
conferred by law. They were purely commercial acts which could have been performed by
any purely private company in relation to a joint venture which it has entered into with
another private party.”!°

168. Finally, the Respondent also refutes the attribution of Cocobod’s acts to Ghana under
Article 8, arguing that the effective test of control under this article is very demanding. It

states that:

“... conduct will be attributable to the State only if it directed or controlled the specific
operation and the conduct complained of was an integral part of that operation”!

and that:

“Hamester has presented no evidence whatsoever that could possibly satisfy the test under
5 96:
ILC Article 8.

  

169. In its Rejoinder, the Respondent follows the same line of analysis. As for the

Claimant’s reliance upon Article 2 of the ILC Articles as an autonomous basis of attribution

of an act to the State, the Respondent submits as follows:

“Tf the suggestion is that ILC Article 2 is somehow an alternative to ILC Articles 4, 5 and 8
for attributing the GCB’s conduct to Ghana, then it is incoherent.

It would amount to the suggestion that every State has a positive duty constantly to monitor
and remedy every single potentially harmful act done on its territory in any way in relation to
a foreign investment by any private person not in any way falling within Articles 4, 5 and
8.7166 (Emphasis in the original)

170. In summary, it is the Respondent’s case that Cocobod is a separate public entity

empowered with governmental powers, as described in Article 5 of the ILC Articles.

C. The Tribunal’s general approach to the question of attribution

171. The Tribunal must decide the issue of attribution under international law, and is
guided by the Articles on State Responsibility adopted on second reading in 2001 by the
International Law Commission and commended to the attention of Governments by the UN
General Assembly in Resolution 56/83 of 12 December 2001 (the “ILC Articles”) as a

codification of customary international law.

172. In order for an act to be attributed to a State, it must have a close link to the State.
This close link can result from the fact that the person performing the act is part of the State’s
organic structure (Article 4); or is utilising the State’s specific governmental powers to
perform such act, even if it is a separate entity (Article 5); or is acting under the effective
control (on the instructions, or under the direction or control) of the State, even if it is a

private or public party (Article 8).

173. The Tribunal will first deal with the Claimant’s suggestion that, because a State can
be responsible for an omission to act, it is responsible every time it omits to prevent any act
that interferes with certain investor rights, regardless of who committed such act. It is worth
recalling the whole text of Article 2 of the ILC Articles:
“Article 2.
Elements of an internationally wrongful act of a State
There is an internationally wrongful act of a State when conduct consisting of an action or
omission:
(a) is attributable to the State under international law; and
(b) constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State.”
It is clear that Article 2 is not an autonomous basis for attribution. Rather, its purpose is to
give a general definition of what constitutes an internationally wrongful act of a State.
Article 2 does not create a general obligation on the part of States to prevent any act
interfering with an investor’s rights. The article only articulates the elements of the definition
of an internationally wrongful act of a State, which can be an action or an omission. Either
has to fulfil two cumulative conditions: it must be attributable to the State and it must violate

an international obligation of the State.

174. The first relevant rule in the ILC Articles is the attribution to a State of all the acts of

all the State’s organs, according to Article 4:

“Article 4

175.

Sl

Conduct of organs of a State

1. The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international
law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions,
whatever position it holds in the organization of the State, and whatever its character as an
organ of the central government or of a territorial unit of the State.

2. An organ includes any person or entity which has that status in accordance with the internal
law of the State.”

According to Article 5, some acts of persons or entities exercising elements of

governmental authority can also be attributed to the State:

176.

“Article 5

Conduct of persons or entities exercising elements of governmental authority

The conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State under article 4 but which
is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the governmental authority shall
be considered an act of the State under international law, provided the person or entity is
acting in that capacity in the particular instance.”

It is clear that two cumulative conditions have to be present for an attribution under

Article 5:

177.

178.

- an entity empowered with governmental authority; and
- an act performed through the exercise of governmental authority.
The Commentary to Article 5 elaborates upon this, making it clear that:

“(a) [Entities falling under ILC Article 5] may include public corporations, semi-public
entities, public agencies of various kinds and even, in special cases, private companies,
provided that in each case the entity is empowered by the law of the State to exercise
functions of a public character normally exercised by State organs, and the conduct of the
entity relates to the exercise of the governmental authority concerned. For example, in some
countries private security firms may be contracted to act as prison guards and in that capacity
may exercise public powers such as powers of detention and discipline pursuant to a judicial
sentence or to prison regulations. Private or State-owned airlines may have delegated to them
certain powers in relation to immigration control or quarantine.

(c) (5) ... [Flor example, the conduct of a railway company to which certain police powers
have been granted will be regarded as an act of the State under international law if it concerns
the exercise of those powers, but not if it concerns other activities (e.g. the sale of tickets or
the purchase of rolling stock).” (Emphasis added) ‘67

Moreover, the State can also be responsible under certain circumstances for the act of

a private or public person — if the State has a significant involvement, before the commission

of the act in question, such that the act can be considered as controlled by, and thus

performed by the State. According to Article 8:

'T RA, Volume 1, Tab 4, See ILC Article 5, page 43.

52

“Article 8

Conduct directed or controlled by a State

The conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under
international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or
under the direction or control of that State in carrying out the conduct.”

179. The jurisprudence of the ICJ sets a very demanding threshold in attributing the act of
a private entity to a State, as it requires both general control of the State over the entity, and
specific control of the State over the particular act in question. This is known as the
“effective control” test.'°* International criminal jurisprudence, in contrast, has asserted that,
at least for military or para-military groups, general control is sufficient, as to control the
head of a group is to control the whole group, and there is no need for specific control over

the acts committed by members of such groups.

180. It is useful to summarise the rules on attribution, as presented in the preceding
paragraphs, before applying the general principles to the facts of this case. The following

acts are attributable to the State, under the rules of international law:

- all acts — including acts de jure gestionis — of State organs;

- acts of public or private entities or persons exercising governmental
authority, if executed in the exercise of such authority — which by
definition cannot include acts de jure gestionis;\©

'8 Case concerning military and paramilitary activities in and against Nicaragua, (Nicaragua v. United States
of America), Merits, Judgment of June 27, 1986, JCJ Reports 1984, paras 113 and 115:

“108. ... the Court holds it established that the United States authorities largely financed, trained, equipped,
armed and organized” the contras ...

113. The question of the degree of control of the contras by the United States Government is relevant to the
claim of Nicaragua attributing responsibility to the United States for activities of the contras whereby the United
States has, it is alleged, violated an obligation of international law
115. The Court has taken the view ... that United States participation, even if preponderant or decisive, in the
financing, organizing, training, supplying and equipping of the contras, the selection of its military or
paramilitary targets, and the planning of the whole of its operation, is still insufficient in itself, on the basis of
the evidence in the possession of the Court, for the purpose of attributing to the United States the acts committed
by the contras in the course of their military or paramilitary operations in Nicaragua. All the forms of United
States participation mentioned above, and even the general control by the respondent State over a force with a
high degree of dependency on it, would not in themselves mean, without further evidence, that the United States
directed or enforced the perpetration of the acts contrary to human rights and humanitarian law alleged by the
applicant State. Such acts could well be committed by members of the contras without the control of the United
States. For this conduct to give rise to legal responsibility of the United States, it would in principle have to be
proved that that State had effective control of the military or paramilitary operations in the course of which the
alleged violations were committed.” Emphasis added.

‘9 For an isolated contrary position, see Noble Ventures v. Romania, Award, October 12, 2005, para. 82: “... in
the context of responsibility, it is difficult to see why commercial acts, so called acta iure gestionis, should by
definition not be attributable while governmental acts, so called acta iure imperii, should be attributable.”

 

53

- acts of public or private entities or persons done on the instructions of, or
under the direction or control of that State — which can encompass acts de
jure gestionis as well as acts de jure imperii.

VIII. THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS ON ATTRIBUTION: THE STATUS OF COCOBOD

181. As already noted, the Claimant asserts that Cocobod is either an organ de jure or de
facto under Article 4 of the ILC Articles or an entity qualifying under Article 5 of the ILC
Articles, or that the acts of Cocobod are attributable to the ROG because they were performed
on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of that State, under Article 8 of the
ILC Articles. The Respondent denies that Cocobod can be considered a State organ, either de
jure or de facto, and does not consider either that its acts can be attributed to Ghana on the
basis of Article 8, as there is no evidence of any effective control of the Government over the
acts performed by Cocobod in its dealings with Hamester. According to the Respondent, it
cannot be doubted that Cocobod is a State entity under Article 5 of the ILC Articles, but the
acts complained of cannot be attributed to Ghana on the basis of Article 5 in this case. Faced

with these conflicting views, the Tribunal has therefore to ascertain the status of Cocobod.

A. Is Cocobod a State organ under Article 4 of the ILC Articles?

182. An organ is part of the structure of the State itself, whether its central organisation
(i.e. its legislative, executive or judicial structures), or decentralised organisation. (e.g.
territorial entities such as federated States; provinces; municipalities; etc.). In the present
case, it is clear that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the acts of the Ministers and over the
acts of the police, which are part of the executive power of the Ghanaian State. The question

is whether Cocobod is a State organ, as the Claimant contends.

183. In order to ascertain whether Cocobod is an organ of the Ghanaian State, the Tribunal
must first look at Ghanaian law, as Article 4 of the ILC Articles provides that “(a)n organ
includes any person or entity which has that status in accordance with the internal law of the

State.”

184. Cocobod was created by the GCB Law (see paragraph 22 above). It appears that the
Ghana Cocoa Board is not classified as a State organ under Ghanaian law, but was created as

a “corporate body,” which can be “sued in its corporate name” (Section 1(2)). Cocobod is a

54

commercial corporation whose principal purpose is to trade in cocoa beans and generate a

profit for the Government, as provided for in Section 6(1):

“Tt shall be the duty of the Board to conduct its affairs on sound commercial lines and in such
a manner as to ensure a reasonable return on its capital.”
185. Moreover, Cocobod, as a public entity, can hold assets and open bank accounts.
Section 11 provides that “the Board of Directors shall be charged with the management of the
property, business and finances [of Cocobod] ...” Section 24(1), provides for Cocobod to
open its own bank accounts, stating “[Cocobod] may have bank accounts in such banks as the
Board of Directors may determine.” Section 37(2) vests the Ghana Cocoa Marketing Board’s

assets — which was the body existing before the creation of Cocobod — in Cocobod.

186. Most likely in recognition of Law 1984, the Claimant’s main focus is on Cocobod’s
status as State organ de facto. The Claimant relies in this regard on the case of Eureko v.
Poland.‘ The Tribunal does not consider this decision pertinent here. The contract in that
case was signed by “the State Treasury of the Republic of Poland represented by the Minister

of the State Treasury,” which is quite different from the situation of the JVA which was

signed by the Claimant and Cocobod, and did not involve any Minister of Ghana. The award
in Eureko discussed the status of the State Treasury because under Polish Law the State
Treasury had a separate personality. In fact, however, the tribunal did not expressly decide
on the status of the State Treasury, but rather canvassed a range of possible analyses. It
suggested that the State Treasury could be classified as a State organ (citing Professor
Crawford, that the State is responsible for acts of “all the organs, instrumentalities and

officials which form part of its organisation and act in that capacity, whether or not they have

171

separate legal personality under its internal law.”)'"’ However, the tribunal also suggested

that acts of the State Treasury could be attributed to the State under Article 5 or 8:

“Professor Crawford further observed that the principles of attribution are cumulative so as to
embrace not only the conduct of any State organ but the conduct of a person or entity which is
not an organ of a State but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements
of governmental authority. It embraces as well the conduct of a person or group of persons if
he or it is in fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that
State.”

 Eureko B.V. v. Republic of Poland (Netherlands/Poland BIT), Partial Award and Dissenting Opinion, August
19, 2005.

'7" Report of the ILC on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, page 83, para. 7.

' Eureko, Partial Award, para. 132

55

In other words, the decision in Eureko does not, in itself, support the Claimant’s contention
that Cocobod is a State organ: first, because the situation of the State Treasury was very
different from the situation of Cocobod; and second, because even if it were the same, the
tribunal did not actually decide that the State Treasury was a State organ. The tribunal indeed

concluded:

“In brief, whatever may be the status of the State Treasury in Polish law, in the perspective of
international law, which this Tribunal is bound to apply, the Republic of Poland is responsible
for the actions of the State Treasury.”!7° (Emphasis added).
187. Another argument advanced by the Claimant to the effect that Cocobod is an organ of
the State de facto, is Article 32 of Law 1984. This provides as follows:
“The P.N.D.C. [Provisional National Defence Council] Co-ordinating Secretary may, after
consultation with the Board of Directors or the Management, give the Board in writing
directions of a general character not being inconsistent with the provisions of this Law or with
the contractual or other legal obligations of the Board relating to the exercise of the Board of
its functions under this Law and the Board shall give effect to such directions.”
The Tribunal does not accept the conclusion drawn by the Claimant from this provision.
First, Article 32 provides that the Government can only give “directions of a general
character” and not specific instructions to Cocobod. Second, these general policy directions
can only be made “after consultation with the Board of Directors or the Management” of
Cocobod. Third, these directions of a general character cannot be “inconsistent with the
contractual and other obligations” of Cocobod, which means that the commitments of
Cocobod, accepted in contracts and dealings with other economic actors, prevail over the

Government’s directions.

188. Having analysed all the circumstances put forward by both parties, the Tribunal
concludes that Cocobod can by no means be considered an organ of the Ghanaian State,

either de jure or de facto.

B. Is Cocobod a State entity under Article 5 of the ILC Articles?

189. It is obvious, in the Tribunal’s view, that Cocobod has a whole range of objects and
functions, as detailed in Section 2 of the Law 1984. This provides as follows (the Tribunal
having underlined those objects and functions which are essentially commercial, the

remaining objects and functions being essentially governmental in nature):

 

Eureko, Partial Award, para. 134.

56

“2. Objects and Functions of the Board.

(a) to encourage the production of cocoa, coffee and sheanuts;

(b) to undertake the cultivation of cocoa, coffee and sheanuts;

(c) to initiate programmes aimed at controlling pests and diseases of cocoa, coffee and
sheanuts;

(d) to purchase, import, undertake and encourage the manufacture in Ghana of, and distribute
and market inputs used in the production of cocoa, coffee and sheanuts;

(e) to undertake, promote and encourage scientific research aimed at improving the quality
and yield of cocoa, coffee, sheanuts and other tropical crops;

(f) to regulate the marketing and export of cocoa, coffee and sheanuts;

(g) to secure the most favourable arr for the I inspection, grading, sealing
and certification, export and sale of cocoa, coffee, and sheanuts;

(h) to purchase, market and export cocoa produced in Ghana which is graded under the Cocoa
Industry (Regulation) (Consolidation) Decree, 1968 (NLCD 278) or any other enactment as
suitable for export;

(i) to_establish or encourage the establishment of industrial processing factories for the
processing of cocoa and cocoa waste into marketable cocoa products;

(j) to purchase, market _and export cocoa, cocoa products, coffee, sheanuts and shea-butter
produced in Ghana;

(k) to assist in the development of the cocoa, coffee and sheanuts industries of Ghana; and

(1) to promote the general welfare of cocoa, coffee and sheanuts farmers in Ghana.”
(Emphasis added)

190. From this section, it appears to the Tribunal that Cocobod is indeed entrusted with
governmental functions. Among others, it has the mission to regulate the marketing and
export of cocoa, coffee and sheanuts; to encourage the development of all aspects of cocoa
production and transformation; and to fight diseases of cocoa beans. In order to fulfil these
functions, Cocobod was granted governmental powers. Section 34(1) is quite clear when it
states that “(t)he Board of Directors may, by legislative instrument, make such regulations as
it may see fit for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of this Law” (Emphasis
added). The purpose of these regulations can be to “prescribe the form of all licences or
permits to be issued under this Law,” and to “regulate the control of the issue of such licences
or permits and determine the conditions under which they may be used, produced, revoked or
returned” (Section 34(2)). Moreover, if the regulations enacted by Cocobod are violated, it
can impose penalties. All these entitlements make it clear that, besides its economic and

commercial objects, Cocobod was endowed with elements of “puissance publique.”

191. The Tribunal, however, agrees with the Respondent’s statement, referring to UPS v.

Canada Post:

"4 United Parcel Services of America Inc v. Government of Canada, Award on the merits, May 24, 2007, paras
63-78.

S7

“Like Canada Post and the Suez Canal Authority, the GCB is a public corporation, dominates
a particular economic activity, and has some governmental powers (such as the power to
make regulations). But that does not, and cannot, lead to the conclusion that all of its
conduct, including purely commercial business decisions in relation to a joint venture for
processing agricultural commodities, are governmental in nature.”

192. The Tribunal concludes from the preceding analysis that Cocobod is an entity

exercising elements of governmental authority, as described in Article 5 of the ILC Articles.

193. Having found that Cocobod is a public entity empowered with some “prérogatives de

puissance publique,” this in itself clearly does not resolve the issue of attribution. The
distinction between a State organ and a separate public entity is fundamental in this context.
As “organs” participate in the structural setting of the State, all their acts are attributed to the
State, whether commercial or not. In contrast, it is well established that for an act of a
separate entity exercising elements of governmental authority to be attributed to the State, it
must be shown that the precise act in question was an exercise of such governmental
authority and not merely an act that could be performed by a commercial entity. This

approach has been followed in national as well as international case law.

194. National precedents include the famous case of Rolimpex, which concerned the status
of a Polish state trading organisation (called Rolimpex). Although Rolimpex was under the
strict control of the State in a centralised economy — much more dependent on the State than

Cocobod — Lord Denning did not consider that all its acts could be attributed to the State:

“T do not think that Rolimpex can be considered to be a department of the Government of
Poland ... Rolimpex is a State trading agency.”!

195. Another case to the same effect is Trendtex v. Central Bank of Nigeria, where a
distinction was made between the activities performed by the Bank as a central monetary

authority, and the act of buying cement for the construction of offices, which could not be

attributed to the State.!””

196. This approach has also been adopted by numerous ICSID tribunals. A good example

178

of the rationale to be applied can be found in the Maffezini v. Spain case,” where the

5 Respondent’s Rejoinder, para. 123.

"6 ©. Czarnikow Ltd v. Centrala Handlu Zagranicnego ‘Rolimpex’, May 26, 1977, ILR, 1983, vol. 64, p. 195;

58

different acts performed by a separate State entity (SODIGA), having been entrusted with
some governmental powers, were analysed:
“In dealing with these questions, the Tribunal must again rely on the functional test, that is, it
must establish whether specific acts or omissions are essentially commercial rather than
governmental in nature or, conversely, whether their nature is essentially governmental rather

than commercial. Commercial acts cannot be attributed to the Spanish State, while
governmental acts should be so attributed.”

“At the time EAMSA was established, SODIGA was in the process of transforming itself
from a State-oriented to a market-oriented entity. While originally a number of SODIGA’s
functions were closer to being governmental in nature, they must today be considered
commercial in nature. But at the time of transition, there was in fact a combination of both,
some to be regarded as functions essentially governmental in nature and others essentially
commercial in character. As mentioned above, this is the dividing line between those acts or
omissions that can be attributed to the Spanish State and those that cannot. The Tribunal
must accordingly categorize the various acts or omissions giving rise to the instant
dispute.”'”°(Emphasis added)
197. The conclusion that flows from these decisions is that only the acts of Cocobod
utilising State prerogatives are attributable to the State for the purpose of international
responsibility, and that the Tribunal therefore only has jurisdiction over acts of Cocobod that
would have been performed in the exercise of elements of governmental authority. This, in
turn, requires an inquiry into the nature of each and every act of which the Claimant

complains.

198. At the same time, for all the acts complained of, in case they are not attributable to the
State under Article 5, the Tribunal must also determine whether they are attributable under
Article 8, the attribution or non-attribution under Article 8 being independent of the status of
Cocobod, and dependent only on whether the acts were performed “on the instructions of, or
under the direction or control” of that State. Such acts could therefore be attributable not
because they are the result of the use of governmental power, but because they are under the

direct command or effective control of the State.

199. As a general remark, the Tribunal notes that it has not seen in the evidence any
compelling sign of such a strong control by the State, as would be required by Article 8. It is
not denied that the Government was informed, mainly at the initiative of the Claimant, of the
developments taking place in the last phase of the dispute, before the departure of Mr.
Holzapfel from Ghana. However, being informed and discussing the case with the parties —

both the Claimant and Cocobod — does not mean that the latter was under the effective

™ Tdem, paras 52 and 57.

59

control of the Government, and that the acts of Cocobod could be attributed to the State of

Ghana, on the basis of Article 8 of the ILC Articles.

200. The Tribunal therefore concludes, as a starting point, that the acts of Cocobod do not
appear to have been exercised under the direct command of the ROG, and do not appear to be
attributable to the Government under Article 8 of the ILC Articles. This general conclusion,
however, requires to be verified in relation to each of the acts complained of, where the

Claimant has denounced an intervention of the Government.

201. Therefore, as will be examined in the next Section, and by way of summary:

(i) Under Article 5 of the ILC Articles, if the acts of Cocobod which are the
subject of complaint were performed in the exercise of governmental power,
they will be attributed to the State. If they were performed in the fulfilment of

commercial relations, they will not be attributable on that basis to the State.

(ii) In so far as acts are not attributable under Article 5, they could also be
attributed to the State under Article 8 of the ILC Articles, if they can be
shown as having been performed “on the instructions of, or under the

direction or control” of the State.

IX. THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS ON ATTRIBUTION: ARE THE ACTS OF COCOBOD

ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE STATE UNDER ILC ARTICLES 5 OR 8?

202. In considering the application of Article 5 of the ILC Articles, the Tribunal has
carefully assessed whether, in its dealings with Hamester in relation to the JVA, Cocobod
acted like any contractor/shareholder, or rather as a State entity enforcing regulatory powers.
It must be observed that this analysis has necessarily concentrated on the utilisation of
governmental power. It is not enough for an act of a public entity to have been performed in
the general fulfilment of some general interest, mission or purpose to qualify as an
attributable act. In this regard, the Tribunal shares the view expressed by the tribunal in Jan

de Nul, when it stated that:

60

“(w)hat matters is not the “service public” element, but the use of “prérogatives de puissance
publique” or governmental authority.”'*°

203. In so far as any act of Cocobod has been found not attributable to the State because it
is an act de jure gestionis, the Tribunal has then considered whether it has been performed
under the direct command of the State, such as to be attributable by application of Article 8 of

the ILC Articles.

204. The first task in this enquiry is to identify the Claimant’s exact claims, and the
individual acts which are said to be the basis for each claim. This task is not easy as the
claims have been presented by the Claimant in different and overlapping ways. The Tribunal

has attempted to organise the claims by classifying them in the following general categories:
(i) the 2001 Price Agreement claim;

A. The 2001 Price Agreement claim

I. The Claimant’s position

205. The Claimant puts great emphasis on the change of Government in Ghana, which
according to it brought about a change of policy, especially with respect to the pricing of
cocoa beans, and the subsequent and consequential imposition of a new price on Wamco in

violation of Article 7 of the JVA.
206. According to the Claimant, the 2001 Price Agreement was:

“concluded under duress and otherwise without proper process. Specifically, it was
concluded under Cocobod’s threat of a continuing cessation of supply to WAMCO ...”""~

189 Jan de Nul N.V. and Dredging International N.V. v. Arab Republic of Egypt, 1CSID Case No. ARB/04/13,
Award, November 6, 2008, para. 170. Emphasis in the original.

‘8! The Tribunal has to explain that the “Expropriation claim” does not simply comprise a claim that some acts
have violated Article 4(2) of the BIT on expropriation. Rather, it is a claim that the Claimant has been deprived
of its rights of management of Wamco, which - as with the two other categories of claim - is said to be a
violation of several articles of the BIT, i.e. Articles 9, 2(1), 2(2), 3(1), 4(1) and 4(2).

'® Claimant’s Memorial, para. 112.

207. The duress resulted from the threat to suspend delivery of cocoa beans and the
implementation of this threat at the beginning of December 2001. The Claimant’s Post-

Hearing Brief identifies two violations of the JVA in this regard, that were linked, namely:

“(i) the suspension of bean deliveries from December 1, 2000;
(ii) the purported imposition of the 2001 Price Agreement.”

2. The Respondent’s position

208. The Respondent considers that “Hamester’s arguments that the agreement amounted

to a violation of the GGBIT are hopeless.” To justify this position, it has made three points:
“First, the GCB’s conduct in relation to the 2001 Price Agreement is not attributable to the
Government. Secondly, even if the behaviour is attributable to the Government, Hamester’s
complaints are entirely contractual in nature and cannot amount to breaches of the GGBIT.
Thirdly, the 2001 Price Agreement did not breach the JVA.”!*>

209. According to the Respondent, the request to use FOB prices went back to 1994 and

had nothing to do with a supposed new policy implemented after the departure of President

Jerry Rawlings, and imposed by the ROG on Wamco through Cocobod:

“The GCB had repeatedly stated from 1994 onwards that Wamco had to pay the normal FOB
world market price.”
210. The ROG also considers that the 2001 Price Agreement was adopted after lengthy
negotiations and was quite favourable to Wamco. This, it is suggested, is proven by the fact

that:

“(for at least eighteen months after it was signed, Hamester did not complain about the 2001
Price Agreement, and in fact relied on the agreement and the prices set there under. It was not
until eighteen months after the 2001 Price Agreement was signed that Hamester objected to
it!

211. Moreover, the Respondent argues that both decisions — the decision to stop the supply
of beans in December 2001 and the decision to enter into the 2001 Price Agreement — were
purely commercial decisions and did not result from the exercise of governmental functions.

As for the decision to stop the supply of beans:

'83 Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, para. 332.
'§ Witness Statement of Reinhold Miiller, para. 11.
'85 Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, para. 340.

62

“The GCB’s decision to stop the supply of cocoa beans to Wamco was an entirely
commercial decision taken by Mr Sarpong when faced with the classic commercial
predicament of a buyer that was continuing to receive goods and refusing to pay for them. It
involved no exercise of governmental authority.”'*

The same is true for the adoption of the Price Agreement:

“Hamester’s complaint about the 2001 Price Agreement, like the Non-Delivery Claim, is a
purely commercial claim based solely on an allegation of breach of the JVA. It is based solely
on the allegation that the GCB breached Article 7 of the JVA by entering into an agreement
with Wamco to sell cocoa beans to it at FOB prices.”!*”

3. The Tribunal’s analysis

212. The two parties to the JVA, Hamester and Cocobod, could not agree on a precise
methodology to fix the price of cocoa beans, and included therefore in Article 7 of the JVA a
provision for fixing of the price by agreement between Wamco, the joint-venture company,

and Cocobod:

“The conditions on which cocoa beans shall be sold, and the methods by which their prices
shall be determined are to be agreed upon by the Company [Wamco I] and Cocobod. These
conditions and prices shall be based on the takeover prices approved by the Cocoa Producer
Price Review Committee [PPRC].”

213. As stated in the Request for Arbitration, “(t)he price for the cocoa beans was to be
based on the takeover prices approved by the Cocoa Producer Review Committee controlled

7188 This indicates that the Claimant was aware of the

by the Government of Ghana.
important role played by Ghana in the fixing of the reference price, although the actual
commercial price had to be decided by agreement between Wamco I and Cocobod. It can be
underscored that the Claimant had no direct role in the fixing of the commercial price, in
which it could only intervene through its control of Wamco, and had no control at all of the

PPRC.

214. The JVA states in its Article 7 that the purchase price for beans will “be based on” the
takeover price set by the Producer Price Review Committee. The parties disagree on the
implication of the formula “be based on.” Mr. Opferkuch took the position during the
Hearing that this language entitled Wamco to purchase beans using the very specific formula

of PPRC price plus evacuation and transport costs. During the negotiation of the 2001

'85 Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, para. 334.
‘87 Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, para. 328.
'8§ Request for Arbitration, para. 4.

63

pricing agreement, Mr. Holziipfel suggested that the incidental costs on top of the PPRC price
amounted to a premium of 10%. In other words, the position of the Claimant is that the
PPRC price should be the reference price with some adjustment of 10% or so. The
Respondent has an altogether different analysis and considers that “(t)he phrase ‘based on the
takeover prices’ is flexible enough to contemplate a wide range of prices — up to and
including a price equivalent to FOB.” Mr. Sarpong developed this view in his oral

testimony.'*?

215. The Tribunal notes that this article was the source of endless difficulties, and it
appears that the fixing of a price at which cocoa beans were to be sold by Cocobod to Wamco

was a matter of confrontation throughout the parties’ relationship.

216. The relation between the FOB price and the PPRC price is described in the following
manner by the Respondent:
“Each year, the Producer Price Review Committee (“PPRC”), in conjunction with the CMC,
makes a projection as to what the average FOB price of exportable Grade I and II cocoa beans
will be over the next year. On the basis of this projection, the PPRC determines the “PPRC

Price”, which is the price that will be paid by licensed buying companies (“LBCs”) when
purchasing cocoa beans from Ghana’s cocoa farmers ...” 190

Tf it is true that the PPRC price was itself based on the FOB price, the proposals of Cocobod
to use the FOB price as a reference cannot be considered fundamentally at variance with

Article 7 of the JVA.

217. Whatever the exact meaning of these contractual words, it is the view of the Tribunal
that Article 7 of the JVA does not provide a definitive answer on the issue of price. Rather,
the basic mechanism in the JVA was that the price was to be agreed between Wamco and
Cocobod, and that the PPRC price was to be taken into account as one of the parameters of
the discussion. In other words, Article 7 provided for a specific mechanism — i.e. agreement
after negotiations considering the PPRC price — but did not impose an obligation of result —
e.g. to arrive more or less at the PPRC price with some minor adjustments. Also, it must be
noted that the PPRC price was entirely in the hands of the Ghanaian authorities and as
underscored by the Respondent, “(n)othing in the JVA or Article 7 or in any document in this

arbitration suggests that the Cocoa Board was not entitled to increase the PPRC price paid to

189 Day 3, pp. 121-22, Lines 17-25, 1.
'° Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, para. 23.

64

farmers to 70% of the projected FOB price.”'"! As a result, the Claimant was not entitled to

have the price it proposed to Wamco imposed upon Cocobod.

218. Underlying the Claimant’s specific complaint relating to the Price Agreement are, as

understood by the Tribunal, two ideas:

- The Price Agreement was the result of a new Government policy imposed
through Cocobod, i.e. the imposition of the Price Agreement can be attributed

to Ghana;

- The Price Agreement was imposed on Wamco through duress and therefore

violated Article 7 of the JVA.

The first question is a pure matter of attribution; the second a mixed question of attribution

and legality.

1. Has the 2001 Price Agreement been imposed on Wamco by Government policy?

219. The Tribunal first wishes to deal with the alleged intervention of a new policy, heavily

relied upon by the Claimant. Among other things, Hamester suggests that:

“Holzipfel’s description of a feeling in Ghana that the new administration considered
Hamester as too close to the Rawlings regime, and that ‘all friends of the old system are
enemies of the new system’ is convincing [Transcript, 3/79/8 — 3/79/11] and offers further
explanation as to why Sarpong ef al were so hostile to Hamester.”

220. In the Tribunal’s view, the chronology of events does not support these allegations.
Indeed, it was in late 2000 that a new Government under President Kufuor replaced Flight
Lieutenant Jerry Rawling’s administration, but the change of policy in the pricing of cocoa
beans had already been discussed much earlier. The Minutes of a meeting held on April 21,
1999 stated that, in the discussions concerning the price, first “COCOBOD’s proposal that
pricing should be based on CIF London Terminal market was accepted” and second that
Cocobod “pointed out that Government policy on pricing of beans for processing allowed NO

DISCOUNTS.”!”? That policy was again insisted upon in a letter of October 14, 199913 —

'! Respondent’s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 58. This is indeed what has happened since 2004-2005, according to
the Respondent: “In accordance with the Government’s and GCB’s policy, the PPRC Price has since the 2004-
2005 season been set at over 70% of the projected FOB world market price.” Respondent’s Counter-Memorial,
para. 24.

Exh. RC88.

'3 Claimant’s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 16.

65

and before that, in a London meeting referred to in this letter, but without indication of a date

—and was supposed to take effect on July 1, 1999.

221. The next question that remains is whether, if there was no new policy resulting from a
change of Government, there was still a Government policy imposed by the use of
governmental authority on Wamco. In order to answer this question, the Tribunal has
examined the evidence to see how the different agreements were reached under the JVA, and

whether the 2001 Price Agreement was adopted in any different way.

222. The Tribunal first observes that, when informed by Cocobod that it was insisting on
the implementation of the Government’s policy concerning the FOB prices — and this
insistence might be seen as the result of a policy of the new Government, wishing to secure a
long overdue implementation of a former policy — Hamester understood that Cocobod was
going to negotiate the fixing of the price in light of the Government policy on the pricing of
beans to local processors. This policy was that the price be based on the FOB price which
was supposed to take effect from July 1, 1999. This has been acknowledged in a letter dated
March 9, 2001, from Hamester to Cocobod:

“Tt has been observed that since 1996 the relation between the two [JV] partners has not been
all that smooth.

One of the reasons is undoubtedly the absence of a pricing agreement ...

Both partners did make several attempts to come to a pricing formula, but it never came to a
mutual price agreement. As a result there has been unstructured, yearly and/or half-yearly
pricing arrangements, much to the disappointment of both partners.

Now with a new government and a new Cocobod management in place, we have to find a
definite price formula to satisfy both partners ...” (Emphasis added)

223. The Tribunal next notes that, when one tries to understand how prices were fixed
during the years the JVA functioned before the 2001 Price Agreement, this appears almost
impossible. Despite several agreements to this effect, it seems to the Tribunal that Article 7

was always applied with a great deal of flexibility and unpredictability.

224. The following is the Tribunal’s understanding of the “methods” used to fix the prices,
which — it must be underscored — were almost always fixed after the sales had actually

occurred:

66

- The period 1993 — 1995: Memorandum of Understanding dated January 23, 1997'*

225. It is not contested that during the entire 1993-1997 period, Cocobod and Wamco had

been unable to reach agreement on the price for cocoa beans under Article 7.

226. The first proposal for a pricing policy was contained in a letter of Cocobod, dated
March 19, 1993. Another proposal was put forward by Wamco in a letter of April 28, 1994,
without any agreement being reached by the parties. In a letter sent by Mr. Miiller, Managing
Director of Wamco, to Cocobod, on February 16, 1996, the ongoing disagreement between
‘Wamco and Cocobod on the price was acknowledged: Cocobod from the start insisted on a
price based on FOB prices while Wamco proposed a “cost-based pricing,” or alternatively a
formula based on the producer price + 60%. Without any price fixed for the whole period,
Cocobod and Wamco finally arrived at a Memorandum of Understanding on January 23,
1997, deciding on a lump-sum amount due by Wamco for the years 1993 (crop 92/93), 1994

(crop 93/94) and 1995 (crop 94/95), but, it is insisted upon, without a reference to any price.

= The period January 1, 1996 — June 30, 1998: Agreement dated July 11, 1997'°° and
Agreement dated July 22, 1998'°

227. Inthe Agreement of July 11, 1997, there was both a method for setting the price and

effective prices given for the different periods. The method was described in the following

manner:

“WAMCO and COCOBOD have negotiated and agreed on the methods by which prices for
cocoa sold to WAMCO shall be determined.”

NOW THEREFORE IT IS AGREED AS FOLLOWS:

“All cocoa sold by COCOBOD to WAMCO shall be at a price which is the equivalent of a
discount of eleven per centum (11%) on Government’s projected FOB price in US dollars for
cocoa which forms the basis for the determination of Cocoa Producer Prices by Government

for the relevant Cocoa Crop sold to WAMCO.”

The prices were the following:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Period PROJECTED FOB $ WAMCO PRICE $

1290 |

The Tribunal notes that the price was fixed by reference to the FOB price without any

complaint from the Claimant.

228. This Agreement was complemented and retroactively modified a year later, in an
Agreement adopted “Without prejudice” on July 22, 1998. This agreement provides that,
considering that “1996 and 1997 products were well sold by WAMCO (i.e. forward sales)
prior to the Agreement of the 11" of July, 1997 the balance due to Cocobod from WAMCO
on 1997 cocoa deliveries shall be four million US dollars (US$ 4) instead of ten million,
seven hundred and ninety-three thousand, five hundred and thirty-two US dollars (US$
10,793,532,00).” Moreover, the agreement states that “(h)aving regard to the fact that several
changes have occurred in the cocoa trade both locally and international [sic] there is a need to
review the Joint Venture Agreement ... and subsequent agreements thereon to enable the

partners have a clearer view of the future of WAMCO.”
- The period July 1, 1998 — June 30, 1999: Agreement dated September 13, 1999'°”

229. Two different periods were considered, but again no method was devised for setting
the price, the total invoice being based on the quantity of already processed beans: for July 1,
1998 — December 31, 1998, no price was set, just the quantity of processed cocoa beans and
the “corresponding US $ amount” were indicated; for January 1 — June 30, 1999, the same
approach prevailed; no price was set, just the quantity of processed cocoa beans and the

“corresponding US $ amount” were indicated.
- The period July 1 ~ December 30, 1999: Agreement dated October 27, 2000'°*

230. It must be noted that the policy on FOB prices was supposed to be implemented by
July 1, 1999. However, no specific reference is made to such price. Again, no specific price
was set through an explained methodology; the agreement only comprised an indication of
quantities (including outstanding quantities not paid for the preceding period) plus an amount

in DM.

"7 Exh. RC96.
8 Exh. RCLIL.

68
- The period January 1 — September 30, 2000: Agreement dated October 27. 2000!

231. This Agreement was arrived at after lengthy discussions. Many discussions were
focused upon modifying the JVA in order to take into account the Government’s change of
policy. The mere fact that such lengthy negotiations did occur shows that the Government
did not impose any coercive change on Wamco through Cocobod, via its powers of puissance
publique, but rather that Wamco and Cocobod, as economic actors, engaged in discussions to
adapt to the new legal framework. Some of the steps of these negotiations can be recalled

here.
232. By facsimile sent March 14, 2000 Cocobod wrote to Wamco, stating:

“You may recall that during our meeting in London, the COCOBOD delegation indicated to
your delegation that there was a new Government policy on the pricing of beans to local
processors based on the FOB price which was to take effect from 1" July 1999 ...

In the light of the above and the bleak market situation with possible dire consequences for all

players, we have to state that future delivery of cocoa beans to WAMCO can only be done on

the basis of a contract (with Quantity, Price and Delivery Period) between our two parties.”
233. Hamester responded to Cocobod’s facsimile of March 14, 2000 on the same date,

stating:

“... this new policy of pricing for local processing does not affect WAMCO because there is
an existing legal Joint Venture Agreement which has different regulations concerning supply
and pricing of cocoa beans for local processing than your new government policy.
We told you that we are open to discuss any changes of the Joint Venture Agreement in
detail, but we are not willing to accept any new government strategies of pricing of cocoa
beans for local processing and without our acceptance.”
234. By a facsimile sent July 10, 2000, Cocobod again proposed changes to the JVA to
shift to FOB pricing:
“S. Article 7
Ref: Supply of Beans
In view of change in cocoa policy, COCOBOD’s original proposal is revised as follows:
i. Beans are to be supplied against contract on basis FOB.

ii. Obligation to supply at all times all WAMCO’s requirements of cocoa beans should
be deleted.

Exh. RC122.

69

iii. Option for WAMCO to import cocoa beans from outside Ghana in view of their free
zone status must be enshrined in the article.

iv. All cocoa bought by the marketing chain in Ghana are exported. Hence the concept of
non-exportable cocoa should be obviated.

Article 7 (Amended) In view of the above (5, 6, and 7), article 7 is being amended to read as
follows:

COCOBOD shall through its wholly owned subsidiary company Cocoa Marketing
Company (Gh) Ltd sell cocoa beans to the factory for local processing. Such sale shall be
against contract on F.O.B basis.

The factory may procure its cocoa beans requirements from any other Licensed

Exporter of Cocoa Beans or may import same.”
235. Hamester rejected these proposals, but finally the two parties signed the Agreement
dated October 27, 2000. No methodology explained the price arrived at, which was
established at DM 1.05/kg for the whole period and for all types of cocoa beans, and no
specific reference was made to the FOB price, although during that period, the Government

policy on FOB prices was at the centre of the discussions.

- The period September 30, 2000 — December 14, 2001: The situation deteriorates

 

236. No agreement was reached before the start of 2001. During the entirety of 2001,
Hamester and Cocobod were engaged in tough commercial negotiations, and they debated the
terms of a new price agreement, with the Claimant proposing a price based on farmgate or
takeover prices as per the JVA, and Cocobod insisting on a price based on FOB pricing, as
stated in its letter to Wamco dated February 14, 2001:

‘The supply of cocoa to you in the early part of this week was predicated on you ensuring also
that the issue of pricing of beans would be resolved shortly.

Incidentally I informed you verbally that the pricing of the 2000/1 Main Crop cocoa delivered
to you will be based on FOB prices, as per the policy directives that had been communicated
to you per our letters dated 14'" October 1999 and 14" March 2000 .”

237. By letter dated March 9, 2001, Hamester wrote to Cocobod, copying the Minister of

Finance, proposing a price based on farmgate prices marked up by ten per cent:

“... we propose the following price formula:

- Base: Farmgate price, to be determined by Cocobod

- Mark-up: Direct cost as percentage of the farmgate price

- The farmgate price plus the mark-up will then be the take-over price to be paid by
WAMCO.”

70

238. Cocobod responded by letter dated March 30, 2001:

“We have studied the proposal, and are of the view that although the pricing formula in the
proposal is at variance with current government policy (i.e. selling beans to local processors
on FOB basis), it could form the basis for negotiating an interim price agreement pending the
formal review of the JVA to incorporate the new government policy ...” (Emphasis added)
This shows, again, that the FOB price was not imposed by the Government through Cocobod.
This was a general policy, which economic actors had to try to implement through
agreements reached in different contexts. It can be recalled that the policy was announced by
the Government to be implemented in July 1999 and that the discussions were still ongoing in

the last trimester of 2001.

239. Due to the absence of an agreement on a price, Wamco did not pay for any of the
beans delivered during the year 2001, and did not even make a partial payment based on the
minimum price which Wamco accepted it would have to pay, until the middle of the year. In
fact, on June 28, 2001, it sent a partial payment, not only based on the farmgate price plus
10%, but also in Cedis, when the usual practice between Cocobod and Wamco had been to
make payments in foreign currency. On July 10, Cocobod returned the cheque in Cedis and
insisted on being paid in foreign currency, and on August 10, 2001, Cocobod wrote again to
‘Wamco requesting an interim payment:

“COCOBOD has continued to supply beans since January to date, and we have run out of

funds needed to meet operational requirements especially payments to farmers and LBCs for
bringing in the cocoa from farm gate to the take over centres.

We would therefore be grateful if WAMCO could pay about DM 20 million on account to
cover beans supplied from January to May 2001 pending the final solution of the pricing
problem for the year 2001.”

240. The negotiations continued. In a letter sent by Mr. Opferkuch to the Ministry of
Finance on November 19, 2001,7° certain offers were made concerning the prices for 2001
and 2002, in order for Wamco to accept FOB prices for 2003. The proposal of Hamester was
to pay DM 1,050.00/ton for the year 2001 and DM 1,250.00 for the year 2002; and it added
that “(b)ased on the above we are prepared and willing to change Article 7 of the existing

JVA from 1“ January 2003.” In other words, Hamester accepted to pay:

- DM 1.050,00/ton for the year 2001;

°™ Exh. RC166.

71

- DM 1.250,00 for the year 2002; and
- FOB prices for the year 2003 and following years.

241. This letter makes it clear that the Claimant was willing to agree to FOB pricing from
2003 onwards, provided that Wamco received certain discounts on cocoa beans supplied
before 2003. That is exactly what the 2001 Price Agreement achieved, with some slightly

enhanced prices, as will be examined below.
- The December 14, 2001 Price Agreement

242. The Tribunal was made aware that, before the adoption of the 2001 Price Agreement,
there was another draft Agreement, dated November 9, 2001. This document must be
considered as a “work in progress” and has no binding effect as it was not signed by Wamco
but only by Cocobod. Moreover, it includes in part an agreement and in part an “agreement

to disagree.” The proposed agreement was:

- that all types of cocoa beans for the year 2001 would be sold at DM 1,250/tonne
(according to Hamester this is a 20% increase on 2000 prices)

- that all types of cocoa beans for the year 2002 would be sold at DM 1,450/tonne
(according to Hamester this is a 40% increase on 2000 prices)
The agreement to disagree was expressed in Article 3, which stated that for 2003, Wamco
was offering a price equivalent to the farmgate price plus 10%, while Cocobod was insisting

on the FOB price, failing which agreement there would be no supply of beans.

243. Based on this draft agreement, Cocobod sent an invoice to Wamco requesting
payment for bean deliveries from January 1 to September 30, 2001,7°' which had still not
been paid for, based on the price of DM 1,250/tonne, i.e. the sum of DM 44,321,875.00. In
the accompanying letter, a reference is made to discussions on November 6, 2001, where an
agreement was reached on prices that was formalised in the November 9, 2001 draft
agreement, followed by a statement that “(t)o our total surprise ... you refused on Friday 9"
November 2001 to execute the formal Agreement drawn up to incorporate the above agreed
prices.” The letter added that the price for 2001 on which the invoice was based was “a price

that was in fact proposed by you and accepted by Cocobod.”

°°! Exh. RC164.

72

244. At that point in time, the dispute was limited to a difference in the price offered by
‘Wamco — DM 1.050,00/ton for the year 2001 — and the price requested by Cocobod — DM
1.250,00/ton for the year 2001, which Wamco had only accepted for 2002. Cocobod
requested the payment based on “its price,” while Wamco refused to pay more than the

amount based on “‘its price.”

245. Meanwhile, a payment for the beans delivered in 2001 was made by Wamco on
November 27, 2001, but Cocobod considered this only as a partial payment and requested the
remaining sum owed to it, based on the FOB prices, which amounted to DM 24,321,875.00.
Wamco, basing itself on its own pricing proposal, considered that it owed only DM
17,230,375.00, and, accordingly, transferred that sum to Cocobod’s account on December 5,

2001.

246. On December 14, 2001, the 2001 Price Agreement was signed, which was a
compromise between the proposals of Cocobod, as expressed in the November 7, 2001
document (DM 1,250/tonne for the year 2001 and DM 1,450/tonne for the year 2002) and the
proposals of Wamco on November 19, 2010 (DM 1,050/ton for the year 2001 and DM 1,250
for the year 2002), as it provided only the “Cocobod price” starting from the last trimester of
2001, and accepted a compromise between Wamco’s and Cocobod’s proposals for the major

part of 2001.
247. Inthe 2001 Price Agreement, it was agreed that:

- From 1“ January 2001 to 30" September 2001, the price will be DM 1,150 per tonne.
- From 1 October 2001 to 31“ December 2001, the price will be DM 1,250 per tonne.
- From 1“ January 2002 to 31“ December 2002, the price will be DM 1,450 per tonne.

248. This account of the negotiations shows beyond doubt that the Government was not
using its “puissance publique” to modify the JVA and disregard alleged rights of the investor,
but rather that two commercial actors were engaged in “arms-length” negotiations in order to
take into account a general policy of Ghana. One party retained the payment of the already
delivered beans; the other party retained the delivery of beans to be processed. No act of the
Government can be found that would have imposed the FOB price on Wamco, through the

actions of Cocobod.

73

249. The Claimant has referred to several communications with the Minister of Finance
during the month of November/December 2001, while the 2001 Price Agreement was being
negotiated, in order to support the idea that Cocobod was under the Government’s control.
However, it is the view of the Tribunal that it was mainly Hamester that tried to involve the
Government. In the event, the Government did not interfere with the negotiations, requesting
instead to be informed of its outcome. For example, in a letter dated November 28, 2001
from the Ministry of Finance to Mr. Holziipfel, it is stated without ambiguity that the Minister

did not want to intervene in the relations between Wamco and Cocobod:

“T wish to inform you that, henceforth, you are to deal directly with the Chief Executive of
Ghana Cocoa Board on all issues concerning the supply and payment of cocoa delivered to
WAMCO by Cocobod and keep me informed.”?°?
250. In other words, all the acts of Cocobod in the negotiation and finalising of the 2001
Price Agreement are properly characterised as acts de jure gestionis, and as such are not

attributable to the Government of Ghana.

2. Was the 2001 Price Agreement signed under Duress?

251. The Tribunal must then address Hamester’s claim that the 2001 Price Agreement was
signed under duress, implying that it was imposed on Hamester by a sovereign act of the
Ghanaian authorities, in disregard of the JVA. To assess this claim, it is important to
examine all the surrounding circumstances. While the Tribunal has already analysed what
happened before the signing of the 2001 Price Agreement and at the moment of signing, the

analysis below focuses more closely on what happened after its adoption.

252. It is relevant to note that, contrary to what had happened with another price
agreement, there was no reservation on the part of Wamco when signing the 2001 Price
Agreement. There was no wording such as “reservation of rights” or “without prejudice.” It
is also worth noting that, judged objectively, the 2001 Price Agreement can be considered a
good bargain for Wamco, since it successfully negotiated the non-application of FOB pricing
for three and a half years — from July 1, 1999 to January 1, 2003. Neither was there any
protest from Wamco after that agreement was signed. On the contrary, it appears that, on
more than one occasion, Wamco relied on that agreement in its dealings with Cocobod. For

2,208

example, in a letter dated December 16, 200: Wamco specifically relied on the 2001 Price

202

74

Agreement (“We signed a price agreement for the year 2002 on 14.12.01.”) in order to obtain
the 34,500 tons of beans that in its view should have been received in 2002 at the price of
1,450 (i.e. as agreed upon for that year in the 2001 agreement). Also, by letter dated January

29, 2003, Wamco wrote to Cocobod, copying the Minister of Finance:

“Based on the Joint-Venture Agreement between Gustav Hamester and Cocobod and the

price agreement (Article 2 iii) between WAMCO and Cocobod, dated 14" December 2001,
we ask you to supply WAMCO with the still outstanding quantities of 30.000 tons at the

agreed price of 741,37 € / ton by 3“ February 2003.” (Emphasis added)
253. The Tribunal thus concludes that the evidence does not support Hamester’s allegation
of duress. There is no evidence showing that Hamester was harassed or coerced by the
conduct of Cocobod, and even less so by conduct of the Ghanaian Government. Clearly,
there were negotiations between two partners, each of them deploying its bargaining power
with the aim of having its views prevail. Hamester put pressure on Wamco by abstaining
from paying for the beans which had been delivered for almost a year, and Cocobod
threatened to stop delivery of beans, and even stopped delivery for a short period of time. As
stated by the Respondent:

“the impetus to suspend supply of beans, as Mr Sarpong so eloquently put it in the testimony

quoted at the beginning of this brief and above, was Wamco’s consistent refusal to pay for the

beans it had already.”
These are strategies regularly employed by economic actors exercising their bargaining
power. And it is far from evident that Cocobod had the strongest bargaining power in view
of Hamester’s majority shareholding in Wamco, as was indeed recognised by Mr. Opferkuch

himself during the Hearing, when he stated:

7 ; 2
“T do not know who puts more pressure on which side, Cocobod on us or we on Cocobod. 96

254. The core controversy here concerns the amount of payments to be made under a
contract. The Tribunal notes that, with regard to an analogous situation of payments under a

contract, an ECT tribunal in Amto v. Ukraine found that:

“(t)he payment or non-payment by a state entity of contractual debts owed to a service

provider involves no exercise of sovereign authority or puissance publique, and cannot be
a ay 272

attributed to the Ukraine.”

°° Respondent’s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 64.
2° Hearing Transcripts, Day 2, pp. 130-31, lines 18-25, 1.

75

255. In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that, in relation to the adoption of the 2001 Price
Agreement, Cocobod did not perform any act in the exercise of governmental functions,

which could be attributed to Ghana under Article 5 of the ILC Articles.

256. Moreover, although there was a general policy in favour of FOB prices, the Tribunal
was provided with no evidence of any directive or instruction of the Government, by which
Cocobod was obliged unilaterally to impose a price upon Wamco, using, among other means,
the pressure of the cessation of bean delivery. The long negotiations that took place over
several years demonstrates the contrary. Likewise, no direct Governmental control has been
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Tribunal, whether in respect of the different proposals
presented in the course of the negotiations, or the decision to stop the delivery of beans in
December 2001. It follows that the different acts complained of in relation to the 2001 Price

Agreement cannot be attributed to Ghana under Article 8 of the ILC Articles.

B. The 2002 non-delivery of beans claim

I. The Claimant’s position

257. According to the Claimant, Article 7 of the JVA expressly entitled Wamco “at all
times [to] be supplied with all its requirements of cocoa beans to enable it to operate at its full
capacity.” The Claimant considers that this contractual right has been violated and has

advanced a claim alleging a shortfall of 29,531 tonnes in cocoa bean deliveries in 2002.

258. On the Claimant’s case, this shortfall did not result from a shortage of beans in Ghana,
but from a new policy of the State to treat all local processors equally. Mr. Sarpong made it
very clear during the Hearing that it was Ghana’s policy to treat all local processors,

2

including Wamco, “equally and equitably. 8 However, the Claimant considers that:

“(t)reating Wamco the same as other domestic processors necessarily meant acting as if
Article 7 JVA did not exist, this is precisely what Cocobod arbitrarily did.”

Hamester added:

107.

2 Claimant’s Post Hearing Brief, para. 16.

76

“that Sarpong may have considered that it was more equitable to put all domestic processors
on the same footing as regards cocoa supply and pricing, is immaterial to the questions
whether, in, driving that policy through, the JVA was breached and Hamester’s Treaty rights
infringed.”

2. The Respondent’s position

259. As far as the non-delivery claim is concerned, the Respondent’s defence first
addressed merits, before dealing with the question of jurisdiction. On the merits, it is the
Respondent’s case that no obligation of delivery that was capable of being violated actually
existed. According to its analysis, the obligation to deliver cocoa beans only related to
‘Wamco I. As a consequence, the Respondent had no obligation to deliver the 70,000 tonnes,
which had been requested by Wamco for the three factories. Moreover, in the Respondent’s
view, even if all three factories were taken into consideration, “the total volume of beans

211

processed annually on average by all three factories is only 51,607 tonnes” and the request

was thus greatly exaggerated.

260. Even if a contractual obligation to deliver beans in the amount requested existed,
according to the ROG, there were objective factors that meant that this obligation could not

be fulfilled:

“The GCB informed the cocoa processing factories in Ghana of an impending shortage facing
the industry at a meeting on 7 March 2002, so that appropriate precautionary steps could be
taken by them. The GCB’s advice was that they should reduce their throughput or import
beans from outside Ghana. At a Wamco management meeting in June 2002, Mr Holzipfel
acknowledged the shortage and the advice Wamco had been given in this regard, commenting
that it would have to take those problems into consideration and plan ahead.”?!

261. In other words, there is sufficient evidence that “(t)he failure to supply in 2002 was

213

caused by a country-wide shortage of cocoa beans. In its Post-hearing Brief, the

Respondent further qualified the situation as resulting from “an Act of God — Black Pod

disease ...”
262. As to the jurisdictional question, the Government states:

“that even if the failure to supply 29,531 tonnes of cocoa beans was a breach of the JVA, it
falls outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. First, the GCB’s failure to supply cocoa beans is
clearly not attributable to the Government. Alternatively, purely contractual claims of this

210 Claimant’s Post Hearing Brief, para. 17.

*!2 Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, para. 100.
*13 Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, para. 305.

77

nature simply do not amount to breaches of any of the provisions of the GGBIT which
Hamester has invoked.””!

3. The Tribunal’s analysis

263. The Tribunal notes that whether or not Wamco had a right to receive all the beans that
it required is disputed. Article 7 of the JVA provides in relation to this issue:
“The Factory shall at all times be supplied with all its requirements of cocoa beans to enable it
to operate at its full capacity.”
264. Prima facie, it appears that Hamester had a right to receive the beans that it requested.
This assumption finds some support in a proposal made by Cocobod, in a facsimile sent on

July 10, 2000 (mentioned earlier), suggesting certain changes to the JVA:

“5S. Article 7

In view of change in cocoa policy, COCOBOD’s original proposal is revised as follows:

ii. Obligation to supply at all times all WAMCO’s requirements of cocoa beans should
be deleted.”

265. The Tribunal considers that certain comments are appropriate here. First, on a
reasonable interpretation, the parties to the JVA cannot have contemplated that Wamco
would be free to request any quantity of beans. On a reasonable construction of the terms
used, any request had to be related, objectively, to the factory’s production capacity. The
actual producing capacities were in issue in this dispute, as was the scope of Article 7. As to
the latter issue, the Respondent contended that Article 7 only refers to Wamco I, relying on
the reference to the “Factory” which could only have been Wamco I at the moment of the
signing of the JVA. The Claimant, on the other hand, contended that Article 7 refers to all
three factories, Wamco I, Wamco II, and Wamco III, basing itself on Article 1.2 of the JVA,
which provides that “(t)he objects of the Company [Wamco] may be extended and expanded

into other operational activities by decision of the Company’s Board of Directors.”

266. However, the Tribunal does not consider that it needs to resolve these controversies.
This is so because, in the Tribunal’s view, even if the shortage of beans could have amounted
to a violation of Article 7 of the JVA, this would be a violation of a purely contractual right.

The Tribunal considers that the supply of cocoa beans is not an act in the exercise of

*!4 Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, para. 300.

78

governmental authority, and therefore, such act of Cocobod cannot be attributed to the State.
In other words, all the acts of Cocobod, a public entity as described in Article 5 of the ILC
Articles, dealing with the shortage of beans during the year 2002 are acts de jure gestionis

and as such not attributable to the Government of Ghana.

267. Moreover, although there was a general policy of equitable distribution of the cocoa
beans, the Tribunal has found no evidence in the record showing any instruction or direction
from the Government or control over the representatives of Cocobod, directing Cocobod to
deprive Wamco of the beans it had required at the beginning of the year 2002. It follows that
there is no basis to attribute to the ROG the non-delivery of the cocoa beans required by

Wamco under Article 8 of the ILC Articles.

268. The Tribunal’s conclusions on this issue, albeit based upon the specific facts of this
case and the specific terms of the BIT, accords with the general observation of the

Respondent that:

“(d)isputes about non-delivery of agricultural commodities, like other simple sale of goods
claims, are quintessentially disputes which should be resolved in municipal courts or by
commodity arbitration bodies. They are not the sort of dispute with which an Arbitral
Tribunal constituted under the ICSID Convention or a bilateral investment treaty should be
burdened.”?!°

C. The 2003 expropriation claim

I. The Claimant’s position

269. It is the the Claimant’s case that it has been deprived of its rights of management of
Wamco by the different actions of the minority shareholder’s representative, Dr. Ohene.
After describing the events that took place at the beginning of 2003, the Claimant states in its

Memorial that:

“(t)he state of affairs set out above has continued to the present day. The Claimant’s
control over its investment in WAMCO, its rights of management through nominated
Directors of WAMCO as per the JV Agreement and all other rights under the JV
Agreement have effectively and/or actually been denied and lost as a result of the
Respondent’s actions and omissions.”

“15 Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, para. 301.
216 Claimant’s Memorial, para. 149.

79

270. The main expropriation claim is related to the events that took place at the beginning
of 2003, and concerns what the Claimant describes in its Post-Hearing Brief as “(t)he
impairment and expropriation of Hamester’s management rights over Wamco under the

JVA.” This is more precisely described in the following manner:

“The JVA expressly gave Hamester a majority shareholding in Wamco and thereby
management control. The management control was two fold. Firstly, under Article 4.3 (b) of
the JVA Hamester’s appointed Managing Director shall have ‘responsibility for the day to
day management of the Company to enable it to perform as a viable commercial enterprise.’
Secondly, under Article 4.11 of the JVA, decisions by the Board of Directors required a
simple, majority; Hamester’s appointed directors formed a majority under Article 4.1 of the

271. The Claimant’s thesis is that it was deprived of its management rights in early 2003,

and it submits that:

“Cocobod’s strategy was now to make Wamco its effective puppet and to emasculate
Hamester.”

2. The Respondent’s position

272. In its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent objects to the allegation of expropriation
with respect to the rights to manage Wamco. On the Respondent’s case, the expropriation
claim is without merit,”!” as the Claimant in fact abandoned the joint-venture, before any of

the acts complained of. It insists on the following events:

“Hamester’s voluntary and wrongful repudiation of the JVA and its abandonment of its
management responsibilities in relation to Wamco in early 2003 because Mr Opferkuch found
that he could no longer plunder Wamco and hoped to make higher profits in the European
chocolate market.”

273. The Claimant does not deny that (as asserted by the Respondent):

“(o)n 8 March 2003, Mr Holzapfel left Ghana without notice to the GCB or Wamco’s Board
and without the GCB or Wamco’s Board ever having been given an explanation for his
sudden departure. Despite Dr. Ohene’s express request that Mr. Holzipfel return to his post
immediately, Mr. Holzapfel never returned to Ghana.”

*!° Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, para. 164.
°° Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, para. 1.
*! Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, para. 123.

80

274. This issue goes to the question of the legality of Cocobod’s and the Government’s
actions in 2003. But even if a deprivation had occurred, which the Respondent denies, its
main contention is that most of the acts that allegedly resulted in Hamester’s losses are not
attributable to the ROG, and that concerning the “limited allegations that the Government

itself was involved in the expropriation ... these are trivial.”?””

These arguments, in the
Respondent’s view, go to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. Having concluded that the acts are not
attributable, the Respondent, however, returns to the question of the legality of the acts

complained of, stating that:

“the Government clearly has not directly expropriated Hamester’s investment. Hamester
retains ownership of its shares in Wamco.”

275. Finally, in assessing potential damages for the expropriation claim, the Respondent
addresses what it characterises as unlawful and bad faith acts committed by Hamester, which

in its view have to be taken into account to annul any possible compensation:

“Even if Hamester’s investment in Wamco and the JVA has been expropriated and even if the
expropriatory acts are attributable to the Ghanaian Government under the ILC Articles,
Hamester’s Expropriation Claim should still be dismissed in its entirety because the value of
Hamester’s investment from Hamester’s perspective is negative. This conclusion results from
several factors, which are explained in turn below.””

276. The different factors mentioned are essentially that Hamester’s resale profits were
unlawful; that the sale of the Neuhaus shares was unacceptable; and that Hamester was
unduly charging sales and marketing fees to Wamco without rendering any commercial

service in exchange.
3. The Tribunal’s analysis

277. The Tribunal deals here only with the question of attribution, leaving the question of

the legality of the acts complained of for the next Section.

278. It is to be noted, at the outset, that, in its initial presentation of its case under the title
“2003 — Interference with and Expropriation of Claimant’s Management of WAMCO,”

which set out its overall thesis on this issue, the Claimant made no reference whatsoever to

>? Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, para. 174.
3 Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, para. 221.
°>4 Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, para. 227.

81

any action of the Government. Instead, it only advanced a complaint about the behaviour of

Cocobod and its representative, which was said to be a violation of the contract:
“From the beginning of 2003, following Cocobod’s failures to make supplies as per the JV
Agreement, Cocobod acting in concert with its representative on the WAMCO board of
directors Dr Sammy Ohene, in breach of the WAMCO Regulations and in breach of the JV
Agreement progressively impaired and ultimately expropriated the Claimant’s management of
WAMCO and its proper use, management and investment (sic) of its investment therein.”
(Emphasis added)

279. Of the different actions which the Claimant submits resulted in its expropriation, two

categories may be distinguished:

- the first category comprises different actions by the Chairman of Wamco’s Board of
Director, Dr. Ohene;

- the second category comprises acts performed by different Ghanaian authorities.

280. As previously mentioned, the following analysis is limited to the question of

attribution of these different acts to the ROG.

1. Acts of Wamco’s Chairman

281. The issue here is whether these different acts can be attributed to Ghana, as acts
committed in the exercise of governmental authority, or whether they are properly
characterised as acts of a commercial nature (and so not attributable). As per the analysis of
other elements of the Claimant’s claim, in so far as acts are not considered attributable under
Article 5 of the ILC Articles, the position under Article 8 of the ILC Articles must then be

assessed.

282. The Claimant complains of a series of acts, which allegedly deprived it of its
investment in early 2003. It is to be recalled that Dr. Ohene was one of Cocobod’s
representatives on Wamco’s Board of Directors, and the Chairman of Wamco’s Board of

Directors since June 2002. Among the acts complained of are:

- A letter dated 16 January 2003, written by Dr. Ohene to Hamester complaining about the

latter’s violations of the JVA;

5 Claimant’s Memorial, para. 126.

82

- A letter dated January 30, 2003 from Dr. Ohene to Mr. Clement, Wamco’s General
Manager of Operations, to instruct him to suspend the exports by Wamco effective January

31, 2003;

- A letter dated February 9, 2003 in which Dr. Ohene requested Hamester to give formal
notice of withdrawal, and thereby render official Hamester’s desire to withdraw as previously

expressed in a letter of January 14, 2003;

- A letter dated March 9, 2009 from Dr. Ohene to Mr. Clement, asking him to continue
production, despite the order Mr. Holzapfel had given the day before he left Ghana for

Germany to stop all production until further notice;

- A letter dated March 11, 2009 from Dr. Ohene to Mr. Clement, asking him to continue
production, despite a new order issued by Mr. Holziipfel (by letter from Germany the day

before) to cease all activities;

- A letter dated April 22, 2003, in which Cocobod refused an interim agreement proposed by

Hamester on April 9 for the interim management of Wamco;

- A letter dated October 8, 2009 from Dr. Ohene appointing Mr. Clement as Managing

Director of Wamco.

283. To the Tribunal, these letters are clearly part of a general corporate battle, between the
shareholders of Wamco. On one side was the majority shareholder, Hamester, which
expressed a desire to withdraw from the company and whose representative (the Managing
Director of Wamco) had, at a certain point in time, physically abandoned his post, and had
given orders to shut down Wamco. On the other side was the minority shareholder, Cocobod,
which was trying to keep the business going. Not one of these letters contains an act of
puissance publique which could be attributed to the State. All of these letters could have
been written by a frustrated private minority shareholder who was compelled to run the
company, faced with the withdrawal of the majority shareholder. Corporate life is replete
with such examples of shareholder disputes. The position is akin to that in Jan de Nul, where
it was held that certain acts of SCA complained of by the investor could not be attributed to

Egypt on the basis that:

83

“(a)ny private contract partner could have acted in the same way.”””°

284. The Tribunal concludes that the letters written by representatives of Cocobod, a public
entity as described in Article 5 of the ILC Articles, constitute purely commercial acts, which

cannot therefore be attributed to the ROG.

285. Further, the Tribunal has found no evidence in the record of any instruction or
direction from the Government to write the letters in question, or any control over their
content or even their existence. The acts, therefore, cannot be attributed to Ghana under

Article 8 of the ILC Articles.

2. Acts of Ghanaian authorities

286. The Tribunal has had some difficulty following the claims brought by Hamester
against the Government itself, as distinct from those brought against Cocobod. In its Post-

Hearing Brief, the Claimant points to three actions of organs of the Government:

“Hamester’s further alternative case is that the acts complained of are clearly such sovereign
acts made by Ghana and for the perceived interests of Ghana rather than ‘purely’ commercial
decisions made by Cocobod/Ghana acting as a commercial actor:
(i) A principled decision to issue a directive that Cocobod could no longer offer any
domestic processors discounts from world market prices and to not allow any negotiation
in this regard;
(ii) A principled decision to issue a directive that domestic processors could share bean
supply in proportion to their market share and to therefore ignore the supply guarantee to
Wamco under Article 7 JVA;
(iii) A decision by the Government not only to get involved in the dispute between
Hamester and Cocobod regarding Wamco but to actively side with Cocobod and
arbitrarily ban export of Wamco’s products and to keep this ban in place until Cocobod’s
representatives asked for it to be lifted.”??7

287. As the Tribunal understands it, the Claimant’s complaint centres on the Government’s
general pricing policy (FOB prices with no discount); the Government’s policy of bean
distribution, which was to ensure that Wamco’s share of the total cocoa processing capacity
in Ghana was proportional to other local processing plants; and, finally, the Government’s

involvement at the beginning of 2003 and its decision to ban exports of Wamco’s products.

288. It is to be noted that the general policy on pricing and the general policy on

distribution are not said by the Claimant to have been imposed through acts of the Ghanaian

6 Jan de Nul N.V. and Dredging International N.V. v. Arab Republic of Egypt, 1CSID Case No. ARB/04/13,
Award, November 6, 2008, para. 170.
7 Claimant’s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 97. References to documents omitted.

84

authorities directly upon Wamco. Rather, they are the subject of complaint as being the
genesis of “directives” addressed to Cocobod. However, the Tribunal has already come to
the conclusion that no general pricing policy was imposed by the Government on Wamco
through Cocobod, and that no general policy of the Government imposed upon Cocobod the
policy of non-delivery of beans for the year 2002. It therefore only remains for the Tribunal
to examine whether the Government’s involvement at the beginning of the year 2003 brought

about the expropriation of Hamester’s rights under the JVA.

289. Before entering into this examination, it is to be recalled that certain other acts were
also articulated by the Claimant during the course of the proceedings as being part of an
expropriatory scheme. In particular, in its Memorial, it was suggested by the Claimant that
the Respondent had used its police to threaten Mr. Holzapfel, inducing him to leave the

8

country.” In the same submission, Hamester also stated that the Respondent had been

instructing directly officers of Wamco.

290. It is not entirely clear whether all these allegations are still pursued, but in any event

each has been carefully considered by the Tribunal.

291. The only acts that the Tribunal has found to be attributable to the Republic of Ghana
are first, the police investigation and the alleged harassment of Mr. Holzipfel; second, the
alleged acts of a Ghanaian Minister during an April 14, 2003 meeting; and third, the export

ban imposed by the Government.

- The police investigation

292. The Claimant complains that the ROG launched a police investigation against Mr.
Holzapfel, as part of a general scheme whose purpose was to expropriate the Claimant’s
investment. The police force is clearly a State organ and the acts performed during a police
investigation are therefore attributable to the State. The question of the legality of such

investigation is analysed in the next Section.

- The meeting with the Ministry of Finance of April 14, 2003

293. As with the police, State Ministers are clearly organs of the State and, therefore, all

their acts are attributable to the State. The question of whether an illegal act has been

8 Claimant’s Memorial, para. 140.

85

committed by a Minister in instructing a representative of Cocobod to violate the BIT is

analysed in the next Section.

- The export ban of February 14, 2003

294. Ghana does not deny that, upon Dr. Ohene’s request, it sent a letter on February 14,
2003 to the Ghanaian Customs Service (CEPS) ordering them to prevent all of Wamco’s

products to be shipped by Hamester until further notice:

“We refer to a letter dated 10" February from the Chairman of the Board of Directors of West
African Mills Company Limited (WAMCO) asking for the suspension of any planned
shipments by the company.

Hamester, the joint partners in the company, has notified COCOBOD of their intention to
withdraw from the Joint Venture Agreement (JVA). In view of Hamester’s outstanding
obligations to COCOBOD and to WAMCO, the Chairman of the company wrote to the
Management of WAMCO to suspend all shipments after 31“ January, 2003 pending the
resolution of these matters. In the interim, a temporary agent was to be appointed to market
and to ship the products on behalf of the company.

On the basis of the foregoing, I am directed by the Hon Minister of Finance to inform you that

you are not to allow any shipment of cocoa in the name of WAMCO out of the country except
otherwise directed.

Please treat as urgent.”

295. This letter sent by a Minister of the Ghanaian Government to the Custom Services is
clearly an act attributable to the Ghanaian State. The question whether this ban was an

expropriatory act as claimed by Hamester is dealt with in the next Section.

X. THE INTERNATIONAL LEGALITY OF THE ACTS ATTRIBUTED TO THE STATE

296. The question addressed here is whether any of the acts which have been found

attributable to Ghana constitute a violation of the BIT.

A. The police investigation and the alleged harassment of Mr. Holzapfel

297. There is no evidence that this investigation was contrary to any international duty of
Ghana. A State may obviously exercise its sovereign powers to investigate and prosecute
criminal actions. According to the Respondent, this investigation was based on objective

facts:

86

“Messrs Holzipfel and Opferkuch have given incoherent and patently dishonest explanations
as to why they caused false receipts for ‘consultancy services’ and “public relations” to be
issued to Wamco. The criminal proceeding was entirely justified.”?”
298. Considering certain documents submitted to the Tribunal which were at best
ambiguous, the criminal proceedings do not appear, prima facie, to have lacked a foundation.
Moreover, the question of the legality of the criminal proceedings is in any event irrelevant

because Mr. Holzapfel stated himself that “the matter was not pursued by the police.”**

299. Further, the Tribunal finds that the allegations concerning physical threats to his life
and his family from the then Chief Executive of Cocobod and the employees of Wamco were
completely unsubstantiated. Moreover, the Tribunal does not see how acts of disgruntled
employees who had not been paid, if indeed such acts occurred, could be attributed to the

Government of Ghana.

300. The Tribunal concludes that, although police investigations are undoubtedly
attributable to the Government, the investigation of Mr. Holzapfel’s conduct cannot, in the
circumstances of this case, be analysed as contributing to an alleged expropriation of

Hamester, in violation of the BIT.

B. The meeting with the Ministry of Finance of April 14, 2003

301. In its Memorial, the Claimant refers to a meeting with the Ministry of Finance that is
said to have entailed the giving of direct instructions by the Minister to an officer of Wamco
(“the Minister”):
“The minutes of a meeting between the General Manager Operations at WAMCO and the
Finance Minister on 14 April 2003 makes clear that the Respondent was now directly
instructing the Operations Minister (sic) of WAMCO, without proper approval from the
Board of Directors.””*!
302. It is not clear whether the Claimant is implying that this instruction is in itself an act
of the Government that could be contrary to its international obligations under the BIT, or
that the existence of the instruction renders the acts done in performance of such instruction

attributable under Article 8 of the ILC Articles. Be that as it may, the explanation given by

>? Respondent’s Rejoinder, para. 90.2.
8 Holziipfel First Witness Statement, para. 44.
°31 Claimant’s Memorial, para. 145.

  

87

the Respondent in the Counter-Memorial contradicts the Claimant’s characterisation of this
meeting:
“As Mr Clement explains in his witness statement, the meeting minutes cited by Hamester
relate to a meeting with the Minister requested, and attended, by various Ghanaian cocoa
processing companies (including Barry Callebaut and CPC Tema) for the purpose of
requesting discounts on cocoa beans supplied to them. The Minister declined to grant
discounts. The minutes then record what was said at an internal Wamco meeting as to how
Wamco could improve its financial performance. In no way did the Minister of Finance
personally take control of Wamco. Nor did he give instructions to Mr Clement at any time.””**
303. The Tribunal has carefully examined the “Minutes of the meeting held on 14" April
2003 at the Office of the GM (OPS) on the viability of cocoa processing in Ghana and

"53 and has come to the conclusion that the

WAMCO’s position on maximising of production’
inferences drawn by the Claimant from this meeting are totally unwarranted. The meeting
with the Minister was a general meeting with three cocoa processing companies, with the aim
of reviewing the pricing policies of cocoa beans sales. The companies were asking for a
premium on beans to be waived for local producers, and the Government said that it would
give the necessary consideration to this proposal. The companies also asked for discounts, a

proposal that the Finance Minister rejected, as prices were dictated by market forces. The
Minutes of the meeting state that:
“(t)he Minister then advised the processing factories on the need to (i) process more of low-
grade cocoa beans and (ii) increase the grinding capacities of their factories.” (Emphasis
added).
304. It is difficult to read into such language the imposition of instructions on Cocobod, or
a direct instruction by the Minister that resulted in the expropriation of Hamester’s

management rights.

305. The Tribunal concludes that the Minutes of the meeting of April 14, 2003 do not
reveal any act that could have resulted in the expropriation of Hamester’s management rights

or control of Wamco, in violation of the BIT.

E. The export ban of February 14, 2003

306. Among the acts complained of, most emphasis has been put on the export ban enacted

by the Minister of Finance. The Claimant requests the Tribunal:

>” Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, para. 174.3.
° Exh. C53.

88

“to find, that the export ban had both an expropriatory effect and an expropriatory
- jo 234
intention.

307. The export ban is clearly an act of the State that interferes with the parties’
commercial relationship. The proper mechanism to avoid abuse by the investor would
probably have been to have recourse to Ghanaian courts and not direct action by the
Government, intervening in a commercial dispute. The question raised by this intervention is
in fact two-fold: whether this action could be a proof of such a strong governmental
involvement that it results in an attribution of the acts of Cocobod to the Government; and
whether this interference by the export ban with the rights of the foreign investor is of such a
magnitude that it qualifies as a breach of any of the substantive protection clauses of the BIT,
and more precisely of the prohibition on indirect expropriation. The Tribunal considers the

answers to these two questions to be in the negative, as will be explained.

308. The Tribunal is not convinced that the existence of the export ban, being an isolated
action of the Governement, can be an indicia of an overall control of the Government over
Cocobod, and sees therefore no reason to modify the general conclusion reached so far to the
effect that there is no convincing evidence of an overwhelming control of the Government

over Cocobod.

309. In order to answer the question whether the export ban has resulted in an
expropriation of the Claimant, the Tribunal will look more closely at the scope and extent of

such measure. Without entering into sophisticated discussions on the contours of indirect

 

expropriation, it is sufficient for the Tribunal to state its conclusion that the export ban was an
act of protection of the joint-venture, in view of the fact that Hamester had already made
known its desire to withdraw, and considering that there was a legitimate fear that before
withdrawal, as much value as possible would be taken out of the country by the foreign
partner. More importantly, the ban was a temporary decision, which was only in force for six
weeks. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that “(i)t is impossible for Hamester to base
its Expropriation Claim on these temporary export restrictions.”**° Moreover, it was only a
partial ban, as a temporary agent, CMC, Cocobod’s trading company, was allowed to market

and export Wamco’s products. As stated by the Respondent:

24 Claimant’s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 68.
255 Respondent’s Rejoinder, para. 90.1.

89

“(t)he only effect of the export restrictions was to prevent Hamester from wrongfully
appropriating Wamco’s products without payment — as Hamester had done since February

002.3
310. It is the Tribunal’s view that Hamester had no right itself under the JVA to market the
products, and that it was not denied its right to 60% of the benefits made by Wamco during

the period of the so-called “ban.”

311. May it be added that this measure intervened at a time when the Claimant had already
clearly manifested its intention to abandon the joint-venture, and had already taken steps to
implement this intention. It was precisely in order to avoid negative effects on Wamco that

the ban was introduced.

312. The Tribunal concludes that, although the decision to impose a temporary and partial
ban on the exports of Wamco is attributable to the Government, in the circumstances of this
case, it cannot be characterised as an act of expropriation in violation of Article 4(2) of the

BIT, which prohibits expropriation or measures equivalent to expropriation.

XI. FURTHER ANALYSIS: THE INTERNATIONAL LEGALITY OF THE ACTS NON-
ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE STATE

A. The Tribunal’s approach

313. Naturally, if an act is considered attributable to the State, the Tribunal must then
determine whether such an act is illegal and entails the international responsibility of the
State (as this has just been done in the preceding Section). If the Tribunal finds that an act is
not attributable to the State, this should be the end of the matter. However, considering the
parties’ detailed submissions on the existence of different violations of the JVA and/or the
BIT, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to expand its analysis, in order to address the
position on the assumption (contrary to its conclusions) that all the acts complained of could

be considered attributable to the Respondent.

314. This is the same approach as that taken in Plama, where the Tribunal helpfully

explained why it had decided to proceed in this way:

256 Respondent’s Rejoinder, para. 90.1.

90

“The Parties have extensively documented their allegations; numerous exhibits, witness
statements and expert reports have been submitted by both Parties. The factual and legal
arguments have been discussed in detail during the Final Hearing, in which a number of
witnesses and experts were also examined by the Parties and the arbitrators. The Tribunal has
therefore decided that, in acknowledgement of the Parties efforts, it will consider their further
allegations on the merits. This consideration will lead to the conclusion that, even if the
Claimant would have had the benefit of the substantive protection of the ECT, Claimant’s
claims on the merits would have failed.”~
315. As set out below, the Tribunal concludes that even if the acts which were not found
attributable to the Respondent could somehow be considered so attributable — for example if
they are assumed to have been effected under an instruction or under the control of the State
— no international responsibility of the ROG could have arisen in any event from these acts,

because of their very nature.

316. In continuing its analysis in this way, however, the Tribunal has not followed Ghana’s
suggestion in its Post-Hearing Brief that it deal with every aspect of the Claimant’s conduct

in this case:

“The Government feels strongly that the clearest possible message must be sent to Mr
Opferkuch and Hamester that their conduct cannot be tolerated and will not be endorsed by
the international investment community. That is why the Government was willing to pay
Hamester’s share of the advance on costs for this arbitration when ICSID invited it to do so.

The Government thus contends that, even though Hamester’s claims fail at every
jurisdictional and substantive hurdle, this Tribunal should undertake a full accounting of Mr
Opferkuch’s misdeeds.”?**
317. Rather, the Tribunal will examine whether, on the facts of the case, there could have been
international responsibility on the part of the ROG towards Hamester for the different claims
raised as to the JVA’s performance. It is only if any of the acts complained of raises or could
have raised an international responsibility of the ROG, that it then becomes relevant to analyse in
detail the investor’s behaviour and the accusations of fraud, in order to determine whether the

investor has claimed with clean hands, and whether this could have consequences on any relief.
318. The Tribunal recalls that the Claimant asserts three main claims (as set out earlier):
- the 2001 Price Agreement claim;
- the 2002 Shortage in delivery of beans claim;

237 Plama Consortium Limited v. Bulgaria, 1CSID Case No. ARB/03/24 (ECT), Award, August 27, 2008, para.
147. The issue of jurisdiction was dealt with from page 21 to 43, the discussion of the merits from page 43 to
page 92.

?58 Respondent’s Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 5-6.

 

91

- the 2003 Expropriation claim.

319. Each of these three categories of claim comprises allegations of breach of the JVA.
However, the Claimant has presented no contract claims as such. Instead, it pursues claims

based on the contract in two ways.

320. First, the Claimant asserts that these apparent contract claims have been transformed,
in its view, into treaty claims by virtue of the “umbrella clause” contained in Article 9(2) of

the BIT.

321. Secondly (and in the alternative), the exact same claims are also analysed as different

so-called “free-standing breaches of Hamester’s Treaty rights.””*? In particular:
(i) The claims are presented as a breach of the FET standard:

“Further and/or in the alternative, the matters alleged above constitute a failure by the
Respondent in breach of Article 2(1) of the Treaty to accord fair and equitable treatment to
the Claimant’s investment.”

(ii) The same claims are also asserted as a violation of Article 2(2) of the BIT,
prohibiting arbitrary or discriminatory treatment; Article 3(1) prohibiting less
favourable treatment; and Article 4(1) guaranteeing full protection and security

(FPS).

(iii) | The same claims are also been presented as violations of Articles 4(2) and 4(3) of the

BIT, on expropriation.

322. At the outset, the Tribunal makes clear that it only has jurisdiction over treaty claims.
This remark is important, given the focus of the parties — and thus of the Tribunal — upon
contract issues. In other words, given the nature of the parties’ submissions, the Tribunal has
to examine alleged violations of the JVA, in order to assess whether there could have been
violations of the BIT. In doing so, however, it adopts a similar approach to the one followed
in Bayindir v. Pakistan, where the tribunal recalled that:

“its jurisdiction covers treaty and not contract claims. This does not mean that it cannot

consider contract matters. It can and must do so to the extent necessary to rule on the treaty
claims. It takes contract matters, including the contract’s governing municipal law, into

2° Claimant’s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 93.
*49 Claimant’s Memorial, para. 155.

92

account as facts as far as they are relevant to the outcome of the treaty claims. Doing so, it
exercises treaty not contract jurisdiction.””*!

323. The Tribunal will first deal briefly with the allegations mentioned in paragraph 318(ii)
above. Considering that, as far as alleged arbitrary or discriminatory treatment is concerned,
the Claimant has not substantiated in which way it was arbitrarily or discriminatorily treated;
that as far as less favourable treatment is concerned, the Claimant has not explained how the
ROG has treated its own nationals, or nationals of any other State more favourably than the
Claimant; and as far as the FPS violation is concerned, the Claimant’s allegations remain
completely unparticularised, the Tribunal, accordingly, considers that the Claimant has failed
to establish its case under this head, and that these claims would therefore have been

dismissed in any event, even if the acts complained of had been found attributable to Ghana.

324. It remains, then, for the Tribunal to determine whether the acts complained of — if
attributed to the Respondent — could have violated the other standards of protection of the
BIT, i.e. the prohibition on expropriation without compensation; the FET standard; and the

so-called “umbrella clause” invoked by the Claimant.

B. Contract claims and treaty claims

325. The remaining issues raise the question as to the manner in which commercial acts, if
attributed to the State, and if proven, should be dealt with. Here more precision is needed as

to the kinds of acts that constitute the “commercial acts” of a State organ or a public entity.

326. The conduct of Cocobod that is the subject of complaint by Hamester comprises
alleged acts and omissions as a contracting party, in the performance of the JVA, and acts and
omissions as shareholder in the functioning of a company. All such acts and omissions boil
down to alleged violations of the JVA. Given that the Claimant has advanced all of these
claims as “treaty claims,” as opposed to “contract claims,” the question then is the following:
can the contractual behaviour of Cocobod, assuming it could have been attributed to the

State, engage the State’s international responsibility under the investment treaty?

327. ICSID tribunals have given different answers to the question whether contractual

behaviour attributed to the State according to international rules of attribution can be, either

| Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29
(Turkey/Pakistan BIT), Award, August 27, 2009, para. 135.

93

ipso facto or under certain circumstances, not only a contract claim but also a violation of the

BIT, and hence a “treaty claim.” This Tribunal will now analyse this question.

1. As a general rule, a violation of a is nota of international law

328. The starting premise is that only the State as a sovereign can be in violation of its
international obligations. This principle has been re-stated by many ICSID tribunals. A few

pertinent citations are given by way of select examples, in chronological order:

Waste Management v. Mexico:

“In the Tribunal’s view, an enterprise is not expropriated just because its debts are not paid or
other contractual obligations towards it are breached. There was no outright repudiation of the
transaction in the present case, and if the City entered into the Concession Agreement on the
basis of an over-optimistic assessment of the possibilities, so did Acaverde. It is not the
function of Article 1110 to compensate for failed business ventures, absent arbitrary
intervention by the State amounting to a virtual taking or sterilising of the enterprise.”""~

 

Joy Machinery Limited v. Egypt:

“A basic general distinction can be made between commercial aspects of a dispute and other
aspects involving the existence of some forms of State interference with the operation of the
contract involved.”

Impregilo v. Pakistan:

“Only the State in the exercise of its sovereign authority (“puissance publique”), and not as a
contracting party, may breach the obligations assumed under the BIT. In other words, the
investment protection treaty only provides a remedy to the investor where the investor proves
that the alleged damages were a consequence of the behaviour of the Host State acting in
breach of the obligations it had assumed under the treaty.”°"4

Noble Venture v. Romania:

Award, April 30, 2004, para. 160.

4 Impregilo S.p.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1CSID Case No. ARB/03/3 (Italy/Pakistan BIT), Decision
on Jurisdiction, April 22, 2005, para. 260, citing, inter alia, the review of jurisprudence in Stephen M. Schwebel
“Justice in International Law” (Grotius / CUP), Chapter 26 : “On Whether the Breach by a State of a Contract
with an Alien is a Breach of International Law”: “... there is more than doctrinal authority in support of the
conclusion that, while mere breach by a State of a contract with an alien (whose proper law is not international
law) is not a violation of international law, a ‘non-commercial’ act of a State contrary to such a contract may be.
That is to say, the breach of such a contract by a State in ordinary commercial intercourse is not, in the
predominant view, a violation of international law, but the use of the sovereign authority of a State, contrary to
the expectations of the parties, to abrogate or violate a contract with an alien, is a violation of international law.
. when the State employs its legislative or administrative or executive authority as only a State can employ
governmental authority to undo the fundamental expectation on the basis of which parties characteristically
contract — performance, not non-performance — then it engages its international responsibility.”.

 

94

“The Tribunal recalls the well established rule of general international law that in normal
circumstances per se a breach of a contract by the State does not give rise to direct
international responsibility on the part of the State. This derives from the clear distinction
between municipal law on the one hand and international law on the other, two separate legal
systems.”

 

Azurix v. Argentina:

“The Tribunal agrees that contractual breaches by a State party or one of its instrumentalities
would not normally constitute expropriation. Whether one or series of such breaches can be
considered to be measures tantamount to expropriation will depend on whether the State or its
instrumentality has breached the contract in the exercise of its sovereign authority, or as a
party toa contract,”*4°
329. As noted earlier in this Award, almost all of the allegations which make up
Hamester’s claim of breach of the BIT, whether relating to allegations of arbitrary or
discriminatory treatment; unfair and inequitable treatment; or expropriation, concern the
conduct of Cocobod, in relation to Article 7 of the JVA. This conduct was contractual and
not sovereign in nature. It is the Tribunal’s view that Hamester’s so-called “treaty claims,”
however skilfully repackaged, are inextricably linked to the JVA and are in reality contract
claims. To use the language of the award in the Vivendi Annulment case, “the essential

basis” of Hamester’s claims is purely contractual.”“”

330. In order for a violation of the contract to constitute a violation of the BIT, there must
be an act taken by the State or a separate entity entailing the use of governmental powers. To

this end, the Tribunal agrees entirely with the statement in Bayindir that:

“because a treaty breach is different from a contract violation, the Tribunal considers that the

Claimant must establish a breach different in nature from a simple contract violation, in other
. oe . . . 2

words one which the State commits in the exercise of its sovereign power.”48

331. It may be that there were violations of the JVA committed by the Claimant, and it
may be that Cocobod violated the JVA in failing or refusing to deliver the requested amount
of cocoa beans, but these are contractual matters and not treaty matters. As a result, the
commercial acts of Cocobod, even if they had been attributable to the Respondent, could still

not have constituted a breach of the BIT engaging the international responsibility of the

95

ROG. This constitutes a complete answer to the Claimants allegations with regard to Articles

2(1), 4(2) and 4(3) of the BIT (FET and expropriation).

2. The existence of a contract does not per se create legitimate expectations protected by the
BIT
332. The Claimant’s allegations under Article 2(1) of the BIT (FET), however, warrant a

further comment.

333. One of the ways in which the Claimant has presented its three claims based on the
breach of the JVA is as a violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard in the BIT, on
the basis that the mere existence of a contract creates legitimate expectations protected at the
international level. According to Hamester:
“These expectations were based upon the Respondent and/or Cocobod’s undertakings in the
JV Agreement and the Respondent and/or Cocobod’s representations to the Claimant at the

time of the Joint Venture Agreement upon which the Claimant reasonably relied in making its
investment.

These expectations are relevant to deciding the standards of fair and equitable treatment
required under the Treaty. Actions and omissions inconsistent with these legitimate
expectations amount to a failure to provide fair and equitable treatment of the Claimant’s
investment.”
334. The Tribunal wishes to make clear that it considers this analysis as no more than one
of several attempts to present what are in truth “contract claims” as “treaty claims.” It agrees

with the Respondent that:

“Hamester’s approach to an FET clause is striking, for it appears to equate every FET clause

into an umbrella clause interpreted in the most extreme “transformative” manner.”
335. It is important to emphasise that the existence of legitimate expectations and the
existence of contractual rights are two separate issues. This has been highlighted by the
Parkerings v. Lithuania tribunal, which made a clear distinction between contractual
obligations under national law and legitimate expectations under international law:

“Tt is evident that not every hope amounts to an expectation under international law. The

expectation a party to an agreement may have of the regular fulfilment of the obligation by
the other party is not necessarily an expectation protected by international law. In other

> Claimant’s Memorial, paras. 158-159.
250 Respondent’s Counter Memorial, para. 315.

96

words, contracts involve intrinsic expectations from each party that do not amount to
expectations as understood in international law.””
336. Christoph Schreuer also explains that contractual rights are not to be equated with
legitimate expectations:
“Taken to its logical conclusion this argument would put all agreements between the investor
and the host State under the protection of the FET standard. If this position were to be

accepted, the FET standard would be nothing less than a broadly interpreted umbrella
clause.”

337. The Tribunal fully endorses this comment, and concludes that it is not sufficient for a
claimant to invoke contractual rights that have allegedly been infringed to sustain a claim for
a violation of the FET standard. Thus, even if attributed to Ghana, and even if the impugned
acts were “sovereign” in nature, the alleged contract violations could not have amounted to a

violation of the FET standard based on a theory of “legitimate expectations.”

338. The question that has to be asked next is whether this general approach has

exceptions, when specific language is used in a BIT, such as a so-called “umbrella clause.”

3. Is there an exception to the general rule for all contractual claims when there is a so-
called “umbrella clause”?

1. The Claimant's position

339. The Claimant has relied on Article 9(2), a so-called “umbrella clause”, in order to
argue that even if all its claims were contract claims, they have been elevated into treaty

claims by this article.

2. The Respondent’s position

340. According to the Respondent, even if the umbrella clause:

“applied to purely contractual obligations assumed by a State under its domestic law, it could
apply only to contracts entered into by the Republic of Ghana under Ghanaian law.”

Management, Vol. 4, Issue 5 at 18 (September 2007).

97

341. As the JVA was signed by Cocobod, which is a separate public entity, Article 9(2)
cannot transform the contractual obligations in question into obligations whose violation

constitutes a treaty breach.

3. The Tribunal’s analysis

342. Article 9(2), commonly referred to as an “umbrella clause”, states that:

“Each Contracting Party shall observe any other obligation it has assumed with regard to its
investments in its territory by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party.”
343. It is well known that there are divergent views, and divergent decisions, on the
interpretation of the so-called “umbrella clauses”, including the approach to the international
law rules of attribution in this context. The Tribunal is resolutely in favour of a reasonable
interpretation of such clauses, and concurs with the position taken, for example, in Jmpregilo
v. Pakistan, in which it was held that contracts concluded between an investor and a legal
entity separate from the Islamic Republic of Pakistan did not fall within the scope of an
umbrella clause:
“In the Tribunal’s view, given that the Contracts were concluded by Impregilo with WAPDA,
and not with Pakistan, Impregilo’s reliance upon Article 3 of the BIT takes the matter no
further.”?**
344. This approach is not isolated, as can be seen for example in the decision of Amto v.
Ukraine, rendered under the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce, where the tribunal

considered that:

“the contractual obligations have been undertaken by a separate legal entity, and so the
umbrella clause has no direct application.”

345. It is also an approach adopted in William Nagel v. Czech Republic”

, in which the
Tribunal noted (albeit in an observation unnecessary for its final decision, since it declined
jurisdiction on unrelated grounds), that a contract was not attributable to the State, for the
purposes of an “umbrella clause”, since the contracting enterprise had a separate personality

from the State, and the latter was not involved in the contract’s conclusion.

346. The Tribunal further notes the position taken by the ad hoc Committee in the CMS v.
Argentina case,” which also made it clear that, in its understanding, a contractual obligation
between a public entity distinct from the State and a foreign investor cannot be transformed
by the magic of the so-called “umbrella clause” into a treaty obligation of the State towards a
protected investor:
“The effect of the umbrella clause is not to transform the obligation which is relied on into
something else; the content of the obligation is unaffected, as is its proper law. If this is so, it
would appear that the parties to the obligation (i.e. the persons bound by it and entitled to rely
on it) are likewise not changed because of the umbrella clause.”?**
347. The JVA was signed by Hamester and Cocobod, with no implication of the ROG.
The ROG was not named as a party, and did not sign the contract. There has been no
suggestion that the ROG was intended to be a party thereto (and indeed there may well have
been reasons why it was not a party thereto). Having considered carefully all relevant

circumstances, the Tribunal concludes as follows:

(i) Applying the actual words of Article 9(2) of the BIT, the contractual obligations
which the Claimant seeks to impose upon the ROG were not “assumed by if”. Given
that the umbrella clause in this BIT is specifically delimited by reference to
obligations that have been “assumed by the State,” the Tribunal sees no basis to
ignore these words, and to extend the ambit of the provision to contractual obligations

assumed by other separate entities.

(ii) If the municipal law obligations which were negotiated between the parties to the
JVA, and assumed by Cocobod in this case, are to be taken as obligations
assumed by the State to Hamester, this would — in effect — completely transform their
nature, extent, and governing law. The Tribunal considers that nothing in Article 9(2)
of the BIT here would justify this. Put the other way, given the wording of Article
9(2) of this BIT, the Tribunal concludes that the Contracting States did not intend to

so transform domestic law contractual obligations concluded by separate entities.

(iii) |The Tribunal is aware that some tribunals in this area have extended the ambit of

“umbrella clauses” to contracts concluded by separate entities, by reference to the

°57 Annulment Decision in the case CMS Gas Transmission Company v. The Argentine Republic, (hereafter
CMS Annulment), ICSID Case No. ARB/O1/8, September 25, 2007.

international law principles of attribution.’ The Tribunal notes that this approach
was not followed in the decisions cited above, and has been the subject of detailed
debate in recent years. Without rehearsing all the arguments at play on this issue, it
suffices for the Tribunal to state that even if the international law principles of
attribution are applicable in construing the ambit of Article 9(2) of the BIT here, it is
clear that Cocobod’s act of concluding the JVA was not attributable to the ROG,
whether under Article 5 or Article 8 of the ILC Articles. With regard to Article 5,
there is nothing to suggest that the JVA was concluded by Cocobod in the exercise of
governmental authority. With regard to Article 8, there is no evidence that the JVA
was concluded by Cocobod on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of

that State.

348. In these circumstances, the contractual commitments of Cocobod, being a separate
entity from the State, cannot be considered as elevated — and transformed in nature — by
Article 9(2) of the BIT, into treaty commitments of the State itself. It follows that a violation
by Cocobod — if such a violation had been found — could not have constituted a violation of

the BIT.

349. As a concluding remark, the Tribunal wishes to point out that the consequence of an
automatic and wholesale elevation of any and all contract claims into treaty claims risks
undermining the distinction between national legal orders and international law.2 In the
Tribunal’s view, this is not a result that is in line with the general purpose of the ICSID/BIT

mechanism for the international protection of foreign investments.

350. Given the analysis above and the conclusion that no responsibility can be incurred by
Ghana under the BIT, there is therefore no need to address the Respondent’s defences based
upon the alleged fraudulent acts and violations of fiduciary duties by the Claimant during the

life of the investment.

usually seen as transforming ipal law obligations into obli directly izable in international
law.”

XII. THE RESPONDENT’S COUNTERCLAIM

351. In the relief section of its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent presents a counterclaim,
requesting the Tribunal to:
“ORDER Hamester to pay to the Government damages, moral or otherwise, for losses it
and/or the GCB have sustained as a result of Hamester’s conduct in such sum as the Tribunal
during the course of this arbitral proceeding may determine as a result of its inquiry into
damages, plus interest per annum.”
352. The Respondent did not develop its arguments in support of this relief. It neither
specified the basis for the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over the counterclaim nor the losses

allegedly suffered by the ROG and/or Cocobod.

353. Under Article 46 of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal shall determine any
counterclaims arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute provided that they are
within the scope of the consent of the parties and are otherwise within the jurisdiction of the
Centre. It has in theory been accepted that a respondent State could have a right of action to
file a counterclaim against an investor under a bilateral investment treaty.7°! In this case, the
scope of consent in Article 12(1) of the BIT is limited to disputes:
“concerning an obligation of [one Contracting Party] under this Treaty in relation to an
investment of [a national or company of the other Contracting Party].”
354. Despite the restricted scope of covered disputes, the BIT recognises that the State
party may be “aggrieved” and “shall have the right to refer the dispute to” arbitration (Article
12(3) and (4) of the BIT).

355. However, in the absence of any submissions on the nature of the Respondent’s
counterclaim under the BIT, the Tribunal is unable to analyse whether it is capable, in

accordance with Article 46 of the Convention, of falling within the parties’ scope of consent.

356. In any event, it would appear that the counterclaim is based on Hamester’s alleged
fraudulent conduct and breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the initiation of and
performance under the JVA. The ROG is not a party to the JVA and the Tribunal has
°° Saluka Investments B.V. v. Czech Republic (Dutch-Czech BIT), Decision on Jurisdiction over the Czech
Republic’s Counterclaim, May 7, 2004. The dispute settlement provision in the BIT in that case referred to

consent to “all disputes between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party
concerning an investment of the latter.”

concluded that Cocobod is not an organ of the Ghanaian State. The acts of which the
Respondent principally complains concern alleged losses suffered by Cocobod — not the
ROG. Since, as noted, Cocobod is neither a Party to the arbitration nor an organ of the State,
the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over claims in respect of its alleged losses arising out

of the JVA.

357. Further, the ROG has failed to particularise and substantiate the basis for, and

quantum of, any losses that are said to have been suffered by the ROG itself.

358. The Respondent’s counterclaim is therefore rejected.

XIII. Costs

359. Hamester claims costs in the total amount of GBP 697,801.45 while the ROG claims a
total of GBP 2,326,712.84.7 Both Parties’ claims include their respective arbitration costs

(advances paid to ICSID) of USD 305,000 each.

360. In the exercise of its discretion in the allocation of costs pursuant to Article 61(2) of
the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal has considered all the circumstances of this case,
including the request for provisional measures by Ghana; the rejection of the Respondent’s

jurisdictional objections; and the outcome on the merits in favour of Ghana.

361. Taking all these elements into consideration, the Tribunal concludes that it is fair
overall that the Parties bear the costs of the arbitration in equal shares, and that each Party

bears its own legal and other costs expended in connection with this arbitration.

XIV. AWARD

362. For the reasons stated above, the Tribunal unanimously decides that:

The Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the Respondent’s counterclaim;

The acts of Cocobod relating to the 2001 Price Agreement claim; the

claim are not attributable to the Republic of Ghana;

The acts of the Republic of Ghana relating to the police investigation;
the meeting with the Minister of Finance of April 14, 2003; and the
export ban of February 14, 2003, which are attributable to the Republic

of Ghana, do not amount to a violation of the BIT;
The Parties shall bear the costs of the arbitration in equal shares;
Each Party shall bear its own legal fees and expenses;

All other claims are dismissed.
