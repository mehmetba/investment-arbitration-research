Order on Motion for Briefing Schedule Order on Motion for Hearing Order on Motion for Leave to File Set/Reset Deadlines |
Tue 01/18 4:22 PM
MINUTE ORDER granting in part and denying in part46 Joint Motion: The Court has reviewed the Parties' Joint
Motion for Leave to Supplement the Record, for a Briefing Schedule, and for the Scheduling of Oral Argument.
The Court ORDERS that the November 8, 2021 decision of the Tax Chamber of the Ecuadorian National Court
of Justice attached to the Parties' Motion as Joint Exhibit 1 will form part of the record for Perenco's1 Petition
to Enforce Arbitral Award and Ecuador's20 Cross Motion for Setoff. The Court further ORDERS that the
Parties' request for a briefing schedule is granted, and that Perenco shall file its opening brief by January 25,
2022; that Ecuador shall file a responsive brief by February 15, 2022; and that Perenco shall file any reply brief
by February 22, 2022. The Parties' briefs shall address only the November 8 decision and its significance for
the pending Petition and Cross Motion; shall each be limited to ten pages; and may each attach a declaration
and/or report by a witness and/or expert on Ecuadorian law. Finally, the Court DENIES the Partiesâ€™ request to
schedule oral argument as premature. If, after reviewing the briefing in this case, the Court determines that oral
argument would aid it in the expeditious disposition of this case, the Court will schedule oral argument at that
time. Signed by Judge Jia M. Cobb on January 18, 2022. (Icjmc2)
