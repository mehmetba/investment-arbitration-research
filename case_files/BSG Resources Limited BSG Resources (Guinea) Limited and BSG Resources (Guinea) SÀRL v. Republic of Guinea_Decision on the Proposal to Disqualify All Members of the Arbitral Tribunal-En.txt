PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On 1 August 2014, BSG Resources Limited submitted a Request for Arbitration to the
International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”) against

the Republic of Guinea (“Guinea” or “Respondent”).

On 8 September 2014, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration
pursuant to Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between
States and Nationals of Other States (“ICSID Convention”), under ICSID Case
No. ARB/14/22.

On 5 February 2015, the Secretary-General notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had
accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been
constituted on that date, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for
Arbitration Proceedings (“ICSID Arbitration Rules”). Mr. Benjamin Garel, ICSID Legal

Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.

The Tribunal is composed of Ms. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, a national of Switzerland,
President, appointed by her co-arbitrators in accordance with the Parties’ agreement regarding
the method of constitution of the Tribunal under Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention;
Mr. Albert Jan van den Berg, a national of the Netherlands, appointed by the Claimants; and

Mr. Pierre Mayer, a national of France, appointed by the Respondent.

On 23 April 2015, the Tribunal held its first session with the Parties. During the first session,
the Parties confirmed that the Tribunal was properly constituted and that they had no objection

to the appointment of any member of the Tribunal.

On 13 October 2015, BSG Resources (Guinea) Limited and BSG Resources (Guinea) SARL
submitted another Request for Arbitration to ICSID against Guinea. On 25 November 2015,
the Secretary-General registered this Request for Arbitration pursuant to Article 36(3) of the
ICSID Convention, under ICSID Case No. ARB/15/46.

On 7 December 2015, the Tribunal in ICSID Case No. ARB/15/46 was constituted pursuant
to Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention. It was composed of the same members as the

Tribunal in ICSID Case No. ARB/14/22.

Page |2

On 14 February 2016, the Tribunals issued Procedural Order No. 1 in ICSID Case
No. ARB/15/46 and Procedural Order No. 5 in ICSID Case No. ARB/14/22 implementing, at
the Parties’ request, the consolidation of the two cases into ICSID Case No. ARB/14/22. On
the same day, the Tribunal in ICSID Case No. ARB/15/46 issued Procedural Order No. 2
taking note of the discontinuance of ARB/15/46 in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule

43(1).

On 9 August 2016, the Parties submitted their requests for document production to the

Tribunal, in the form of Redfern Schedules.

. On 5 September 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7 (“PO7”) containing its

decisions on the Parties’ requests for document production.

. On 3 October 2016, the Parties produced documents pursuant to PO7.

. By letter dated 15 October 2016, BSG Resources Limited, BSG Resources (Guinea) Limited

and BSG Resources (Guinea) SARL (“Claimants”) alleged that the Respondent was
withholding certain relevant and material documents that the Tribunal had ordered it to
produce in PO7. The Claimants asked the Tribunal to order the Respondent to produce these
documents and to indicate the steps it had taken to identify and collect the documents ordered

to be produced by PO7.

. By letter dated 22 October 2016, the Respondent denied having withheld responsive

documents and explained the steps taken to comply with the Tribunal’s decision in PO7.

. By emails dated 22 and 24 October 2016, the Claimants sought leave to respond to the

Respondent’s letter dated 22 October 2016. By email dated 24 October 2016, the Tribunal
informed the Parties that it did not wish to receive further communications from the Parties

in relation to document production, and that it would revert shortly with further directions.

. By letter dated 27 October 2016, the Tribunal conveyed the following message to the Parties:

Having reviewed the positions of the Parties, including the Respondent’s
responses to Annex I, the Tribunal is of the view that pursuing these issues
of document production at this stage of the proceedings will make no
meaningful contribution to the resolution of this dispute. This said, it notes
that, to the extent the Claimants wish to claim that non-compliance with

Procedural Order No. 7 entails legal consequences, such as for instance
adverse inferences, they may do so in the further course of the arbitration,
specifically in their further scheduled written submissions and at the
hearing. In addition, the Tribunal reminds the Parties that they are under a
continuing duty to produce responsive documents as and when they become
available. All other requests are denied.

. On 4 November 2016, the Claimants proposed the disqualification of all three members of the

Tribunal in accordance with Article 57 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration
Rule 9 (“Proposal”). On that date, the Centre informed the Parties that the proceeding had
been suspended until the Proposal was decided, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6). The

Centre also established a procedural calendar for the Parties’ submissions on the Proposal.

. On 11 November 2016, the Respondent submitted its response to the Proposal.

. By letter dated 15 November 2016, the three members of the Tribunal jointly furnished

explanations as envisaged by ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(3).

. By email dated 22 November 2016 and by letter dated 23 November 2016, the Respondent

and the Claimants, respectively, submitted further observations.

PARTIES’ ARGUMENTS
A. The Claimants’ Proposal

The Claimants’ arguments in support of their proposal to disqualify the members of the
Tribunal were set forth in their submissions of 4 November 2016 and 23 November 2016.

These arguments are summarized below.
1) The Basis for Disqualification of the Tribunal Members
a. The Tribunal’s Alleged Prejudgment of a Central Issue in the Arbitration

The Claimants contend that the Tribunal prejudged a central issue in the arbitration, “which
raises reasonable doubts as to the impartiality of the members of the Tribunal and reveals an

v1

underlying bias against Claimants.

' Proposal, { 38.

Page |4

 

22. The Claimants’ contention relates to the Tribunal’s decision on 27 October 2016 regarding
the Claimants’ requests for document production (the “Decision”). During the document
production phase, the Claimants had sought from the Respondent “the production of Emails
and Deliberations in relation to the process and the reasoning for the award of the Mining

Rights to Claimants.”?

According to the Claimants, these key documents related to the core
issues in this case as they would assist in establishing whether the mining rights were procured

by the Claimants in accordance with due process and based on arms-length negotiations.*

23. The Claimants argue that in PO7 the Tribunal acknowledged that the Emails and Deliberations
were relevant and material to the outcome of the case, yet it came to the opposite conclusion
on 27 October 2016 when it found “that pursuing these issues of document production at this
stage of the proceedings will make no meaningful contribution to the resolution of this

dispute” and rejected the Claimants’ request.*
24. The Claimants consider that:

By concluding that the production of the Emails and Deliberations (that until
a few weeks ago were considered relevant and material) will no longer
meaningfully contribute to the resolution of the dispute, the Tribunal has
undoubtedly prejudged the fiercely contested issues in this arbitration.

25. The Claimants maintain that the Tribunal’s Decision on document production is flawed
because it is based on Guinea’s belated and incorrect argument that it lacked control over the
requested documents and was unable to search for them.° The Claimants further submit that
there is reasonable doubt as to the Tribunal’s impartiality because the Tribunal ignored
Guinea’s withholding of relevant and material documents without proper justification and

because the Tribunal failed to review such documents.” According to the Claimants, these

concerms are amplified by the Tribunal’s refusal to allow them to respond to Guinea’s letter

of 22 October 2016.°
On the basis of the foregoing, the Claimants conclude that:

A third person undertaking a reasonable evaluation of the Tribunal's
extraordinary decision to allow Guinea to withhold possibly hundreds of
Emails that are potentially relevant and material to the outcome of the case
and the Tribunal's refusal to Claimants' request to reply to Guinea's defence,
would conclude that the members of the Tribunal manifestly lack the
impartiality required under the ICSID Convention.?

b. The Tribunal’s Alleged Denial of Due Process and Violation of the Claimants’
Rights
In the Claimants’ view, the production of documents is an essential part of international
arbitration, and it plays a key role in ascertaining the truth.'!° The Claimants argue that the
documents requested will be crucial to meet their burden of proof and to demonstrate that the

mining rights at issue were obtained in a lawful manner. '!

According to the Claimants, the
Tribunal’s refusal to order the production of such documents is a denial of due process, which
violates the Claimants’ rights to present their case and be treated fairly.'? The Claimants add
that “[t]his denial of due process and violation of Claimants’ most fundamental rights raises
reasonable doubts as to the impartiality of the arbitrators and their underlying bias against

Claimants.”

The Claimants submit that the Tribunal’s decision was not warranted by the procedural

timetable of the case.'4

29. The Claimants also argue that, contrary to the Tribunal’s suggestion, the potential to request
inferences adverse to the Respondent would not alleviate their concerns.!> The Claimants
note that arbitral tribunals rarely draw adverse inferences and that adverse inferences are not

an adequate substitute for the undisclosed evidence. !°
30. For the Claimants,

a third person undertaking a reasonable evaluation of the Tribunal's
extraordinary decisions to deprive Claimants of hundreds [sic] Emails,
Deliberations and other documents that will assist them to establish their
innocence, undermine Guinea's case and evidence and impeach Guinea's
witnesses in cross-examination, would conclude that the members of the
Tribunal manifestly lack the impartiality required under the ICSID
Convention.'7

ec. The Claimants’ Further Observations on the Proposal

31. The Claimants contend that factual developments occurring subsequent to the Tribunal’s

Decision reinforced the relevance of the documents not produced by the Respondent. !*

32. The Claimants also allege that the Tribunal had shown prior preferential treatment of Guinea

in its decisions on prior applications made to the Tribunal in August and September 2016.!°

33. The Claimants finally submit that their Proposal is made in good faith and was not intended

to delay the proceedings.”°

d. The Claimants’ Observations on the Respondent’s Response

34. First, the Claimants reject the Respondent’s argument that the Tribunal has simply exercised

its discretion to order additional document production. The Claimants state that they had not

sought new or additional documents, but they had merely requested clarification of the

Respondent’s document production obligations.”!

Second, the Claimants maintain that the Tribunal’s reminder of the Parties’ continuing
production obligation, on which the Respondent relies, is meaningless because it is unclear

how these contested documents will become available to the Respondent at a later stage.

Third, the Claimants reject the Respondent’s argument that the Tribunal has not prejudged
the merits of the dispute by denying production of the contested documents because the scope

of the Tribunal’s ruling is limited in time by the words “at this stage.”*> For the Claimants,

[i]t is at this stage of the proceedings, during which Claimants could in
normal circumstances incorporate the evidence obtained in the document
production in its Reply Memorial and in its additional witness statement, that
the requested documents could have contributed to the resolution of the
dispute, not at a later stage when the Claimants have already filed their last
memorial on the merits and last round of witness evidence.**

Fourth, the Claimants consider that, contrary to the Respondent’s assertions, the Tribunal’s
document production decisions dated 5 September 2016 and 27 October 2016 are

1.25

inconsistent For the Claimants, the decision in PO7 imposed an obligation on the

Respondent to produce the requested documents, and the Decision of 27 October 2016

effectively revoked that obligation by refusing to reconfirm the order made in PO7.°

Lastly, the Claimants reject the Respondent’s submission “that a tribunal’s refusal to order
production cannot constitute a violation of a party's right to due process and to the right to

set out its case because otherwise a party would have an absolute right to document

production.” For the Claimants, a party is treated unfairly and there is no due process if that

party is denied the production of important documents or other evidence.?*

2) The Applicable Legal Standard

The Claimants submit that: (a) the requirement in Article 14 of the ICSID Convention that an
arbitrator must be “a person who may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment”
requires arbitrators to be both impartial and independent; (b) impartiality refers to the absence
of bias or predisposition toward a party, and independence is marked by the absence of
external control; (c) actual proof of bias or dependence is not required, and appearance is
sufficient;*” (d) the applicable legal standard is an objective standard based on a reasonable
evaluation of the evidence by a third party;*! and (e) the term “manifest” in Article 57 of the
ICSID Convention means “obvious” or “evident” and relates to the ease with which the lack

of the required quality can be perceived.**

The Claimants further submit that “the legal standard that applies to the disqualification of
arbitrators in ICSID proceedings [...] is whether a reasonable third party, with knowledge of
all the facts, would consider that there were reasonable grounds for doubting that the

arbitrator possessed the required qualities of impartiality and or independence.”**

The Claimants conclude that a third party observer would find that the Tribunal treated them

unfairly and that:

[...] due process was violated, that Claimants have been deprived of the right
to fully set out their case and defend Guinea's case and that they have been
treated unfairly by the Tribunal. He would conclude that the facts manifestly
evidence an appearance of a lack of impartiality and prejudgment with

respect to Claimants. The disqualification proposal must therefore be
upheld.**

B. The Respondent’s Reply

42. The Respondent’s arguments opposing the Claimants’ Proposal to disqualify the members of
the Tribunal were set forth in its submission of 11 November 2016.*° These arguments are

summarized below.

1) The Lack of Merits of the Proposal to Disqualify
43. First, the Respondent contends that the Tribunal respected the rules applicable to document
production and fulfilled its duties in that respect.*° The Respondent adds that arbitral tribunals
have discretion to order document production, which includes the power to draw adverse
inferences.*” The Respondent also emphasizes that the Tribunal has reminded the parties of

their continuing duty to produce responsive documents as and when they become available.**

44. Second, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal has not prejudged the merits of the
dispute.*? According to the Respondent, the Tribunal did not conclude that the production of
the requested documents would not contribute to the resolution of the dispute.*” Rather, the

Tribunal found supplementary production was unnecessary at this stage of the proceedings.*!

* Cl. Fur. Obs., {fff 104-105.

s mentioned in {{ 18 above, the Respondent submitted further observations by email dated 22 November 2016, which read
ated from the French):

 

(trans

“The Republic of Guinea took note of the letter dated 15 November 2016 from Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, Professor
Albert Jan van den Berg and Professor Pierre Mayer, who confirm having acted in accordance with the fundamental principles of
procedure, impartially and independently.

The statement from the Tribunal members confirms that the decision challenged by the BSGR companies occurred in the course of
the normal conduct of an arbitration proceeding. This decision is therefore not susceptible of justifying their disqualification.

Subject to this further observation, the Republic of Guinea continues to rely on its submission dated 11 November 2016.”

The Respondent also argues that the documents requested by the Claimants would not support

the Claimants’ case, hence the Tribunal’s decision could not prejudice the Claimants.*”

Third, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal’s decisions of 5 September 2016 and
27 October 2016 are not inconsistent, since the first decision concerned the production of
documents and the second decision related to additional measures sought by the Claimants in

relation to document production.**

Fourth, the Respondent argues that the Proposal is based on a misleading description of the
Tribunal’s decision of 27 October 2016. For the Respondent, the Tribunal did not decide, as
the Claimants contend, that the requested documents “will no longer meaningfully contribute
to the resolution of the dispute.”** Rather, the Respondent submits, the Tribunal ruled that
“pursuing these issues of document production at this stage of the proceedings will make no

meaningful contribution to the resolution of this dispute.”

The Respondent therefore
contends that the Tribunal reserved the possibility of amending its decision later in the

proceeding if the requested measures become relevant. *°

Fifth, the Respondent considers that the Tribunal respected the Claimants’ due process
rights.47 According to the Respondent, the Tribunal has discretion to decide on document
production requests and therefore has not impaired the Claimants’ ability to present their case
by exercising such power.** To the contrary, the Respondent submits that the potential to
request the Tribunal to draw adverse inferences based on an allegedly defective document

production protects the Claimants’ due process rights.*?

Sixth, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal has not breached the Claimants’ right to

equitable treatment by rejecting their requests for document production.*°

2) The Applicable Legal Standard

The Respondent submits that Article 57 of the ICSID Convention requires the challenging
party to bear the burden of proving that the lack of impartiality is “manifest.”>! For the
Respondent, this burden of proof is high as it is insufficient to establish an apparent lack of
impartiality; the lack of impartiality must be established by objective evidence which would
convince a reasonable observer and would not require an extensive analysis of the facts. The
Respondent further submits that the decisions relied on by the Claimants affirm the high

burden of proof on a disqualification.”

The Respondent contends that the facts relied on by the Claimants do not raise any objective
doubts as to the impartiality of the arbitrators, and only reflect a party’s disagreement with a

procedural decision.*?

C. Arbitrators’ Explanations

By letter dated 15 November 2016, arbitrators Kaufmann-Kohler, van den Berg and Mayer

provided a joint statement, which reads:
Dear Secretary of the Tribunal,

We refer to the Claimants’ proposal of 4 November 2016 for the
disqualification of all members of this Arbitral Tribunal and to the
Respondent’s response of 11 November 2016.

We will not comment on the Parties’ submissions. We confirm that we
consider that we have conducted, and we further intend to conduct, these
proceedings in compliance with fundamental principles of procedure, in
particular with the principles of due process and impartiality and
independence.

Ill. DECISION BY THE CHAIRMAN
A. The Applicable Legal Standard

52. Article 57 of the ICSID Convention allows a party to propose the disqualification of any

member of a tribunal. It reads as follows:

A party may propose to a Commission or Tribunal the disqualification of any
of its members on account of any fact indicating a manifest lack of the
qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14. A party to arbitration
proceedings may, in addition, propose the disqualification of an arbitrator
on the ground that he was ineligible for appointment to the Tribunal under
Section 2 of Chapter IV.

53. The disqualification proposed in this case alleges that all members of the Tribunal manifestly
lack the qualities required by Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention. Accordingly, it is
unnecessary to address disqualification “on the ground that [an arbitrator] was ineligible for

appointment to the Tribunal under Section 2 of Chapter IV.”

54. A number of decisions have concluded that the word “manifest” in Article 57 of the ICSID

55

Convention means “evident” or “obvious, and that it relates to the ease with which the

Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention provides:

Persons designated to serve on the Panels shall be persons of high moral
character and recognized competence in the fields of law, commerce,
industry or finance, who may be relied upon to exercise independent
judgment. Competence in the field of law shall be of particular importance
in the case of persons on the Panel of Arbitrators.

an

While the English version of Article 14 of the ICSID Convention refers to “independent
judgment,” and the French version to “toute garantie d’indépendance dans l’exercice de leurs
fonctions,” the Spanish version requires “imparcialidad de juicio” (impartiality of judgment).
Given that all three versions are equally authentic, it is accepted that arbitrators must be both

impartial and independent.*’

n

Impartiality refers to the absence of bias or predisposition towards a party. Independence is

1,58

characterized by the absence of external contro! Independence and impartiality both

“protect parties against arbitrators being influenced by factors other than those related to the
merits of the case.”*? Articles 57 and 14(1) of the ICSID Convention do not require proof of
actual dependence or bias; rather it is sufficient to establish the appearance of dependence or

bias.

The legal standard applied to a proposal to disqualify an arbitrator is an “objective standard
based on a reasonable evaluation of the evidence by a third party.”°! As a consequence, the
subjective belief of the party requesting the disqualification is not enough to satisfy the

requirements of the Convention.

B. Timeliness

Arbitration Rule 9(1) reads as follows:

A party proposing the disqualification of an arbitrator pursuant to Article 57

of the Convention shall promptly, and in any event before the proceeding is

declared closed, file its proposal with the Secretary-General, stating its

reasons therefor.
The ICSID Convention and Rules do not specify a number of days within which a proposal
for disqualification must be filed. Accordingly, the timeliness of a proposal must be
determined on a case by case basis. Previous tribunals have found that a proposal was timely
when filed within 10 days of learning the underlying facts,“ but untimely when filed after 53

days.®
The Respondent has not contended that the Proposal was untimely.

The Proposal in this case was filed 7 days after the Tribunal’s ruling which gave rise to the
Proposal. Accordingly, the Proposal was filed promptly for the purposes of Arbitration Rule
9(1).

C. Merits

As recalled above, each Party had an opportunity to submit comments on the relevant

document production issues, first in their Redfern Schedules submitted on 9 August 2016 and

subsequently in their additional observations, i.e. the Claimants’ letter of 15 October 2016

and the Respondent’s response thereto of 22 October 2016. ©

The Tribunal then ruled on the Claimants’ 15 October 2016 request, indicating that “pursuing
these issues of document production at this stage of the proceedings [would] make no

meaningful contribution to the resolution of the dispute.”

The Tribunal also expressly indicated that the Claimants were free to discuss the Respondent’ s
alleged non-compliance with PO7 and its legal consequences, such as adverse inferences, “in

their further scheduled written submissions and at the hearing,”® thus offering further

opportunities to the Claimants to address these evidentiary matters.

The Tribunal finally reminded the Parties of their “continuing duty to produce responsive

documents as and when they become available.”

Therefore, and upon careful review of the Parties’ submissions, the Chairman sees no
evidence of either prejudgment of the disputed issues or any violation of due process in the

Tribunal’s Decision.

While the Claimants may not be satisfied with the Tribunal’s Decision, the mere existence of
an adverse ruling is insufficient to prove a manifest lack of impartiality, as required by Articles
14 and 57 of the ICSID Convention. If it were otherwise, proceedings could continuously be
interrupted by a dissatisfied party, which would unduly disrupt and prolong the arbitral

process.

In the Chairman’s view, a third party undertaking a reasonable evaluation of the Tribunal’s
Decision and surrounding facts relied upon in the Claimants’ Proposal, would not find a
manifest lack of the qualities required under Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention.

Accordingly, the disqualification proposal must be rejected.

IV. DECISION

70. Having considered all the facts alleged and the arguments submitted by the Parties, and for
the reasons stated above, the Chairman rejects the Claimants’ Proposal to disqualify all

members of the Tribunal.
