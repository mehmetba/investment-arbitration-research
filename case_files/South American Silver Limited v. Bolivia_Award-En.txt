01 to FTI-55) and Roscoe Postle and Associates, Inc. (“RPA”, its report “First RPA Report”,

with its reference annexes), annexes C-1 to C-94 and the legal authorities CLA-1 to CLA-94.

By Procedural Order No. 2, dated December 1, 2014, the Tribunal accepted the Claimant’s
application to classify certain information used by RPA as “highly confidential” and classified the
information at issue, described in Exhibit A to Annex A of that Procedural Order. Additionally,
the Tribunal issued a Protective Order, included as Annex A of Procedural Order No. 2, regulating
the access of the Respondent’s external counsel and independent experts to the information

classified as “highly confidential”.

On December 9, 2014, the Respondent informed that it had hired Dechert (Paris) LLP as its

external counsel.

On January 14, 2015, the Tribunal issued, by a majority vote, Procedural Order No. 3, that
modified in its entirety the Protective Order attached to Procedural Order No. 2, replacing it with

the Protective Order enclosed in Annex A of Procedural Order No. 3 (the “Protective Order’).

On January 26, 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 ordering the Claimant to submit
to the Respondent some of the documents that the latter had requested. These documents were

On April 14, 2015, the Tribunal informed the Parties of the new dates on the procedural calendar

resulting from the change in the date of the Counter-Memorial’s submission.

On April 21, 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6, deciding that there were no
circumstances at that time that could justify a further change in the procedural calendar, without
prejudice to the Tribunal’s ability to amend it later in the proceedings if the circumstances so

required.

On June 19, 2015, the Tribunal confirmed the changes in the Procedural Calendar agreed by the

Parties.

On July 7, 2015, the Parties submitted their respective document production requests to the
Tribunal for a decision. On July 21, 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7, on
Document Production, where it decided the pending requests in the Redfern Schedules of the
Claimant (the “RDT”) and the Respondent (the “RDD”). The Tribunal requested the Claimant to
clarify certain details in relation to category 18 of the RDD and postponed the decision on the
documents in this category until it had received such clarifications and the Respondent’s

comments on these.

By Procedural Order No. 8, dated August 26, 2015, the Tribunal: (i) classified as “highly
confidential” one of the documents in category 18 of the RDD; (ii) confirmed that one of category
18’s documents already belonged to Protected Information; (iii) rejected the request to classify as
“highly confidential” the rest of the documents in category 18; and, (iv) ordered the Claimant to
produce the information in category 18 that had not yet been produced. In regard to Bolivia’s
request concerning access to Protected Information, the Tribunal: (i) confirmed that the
Respondent's experts could take notes of the Protected Information as they considered necessary
in order to produce their expert reports: (ii) rejected the rest of the Respondent’s requests;
(iii) reiterated that, in case there were problems with access or differences arising between the
Parties when receiving the Protected Information, these should be brought to the Tribunal curing
the course of such review and not afterwards; and (iv) invited the Parties to decide on the venue

for the Data Room.

On October 2 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 9 confirming all the points of

Procedural Order No. 8. The Tribunal confirmed that certain documents requested were already

3 During the Hearing, the Respondent reiterated its rights reserved in regards to the access it had had to the documents classified

PCA Case No. 2013-15
Award

By Procedural Order No. 12, dated March 8, 2016, the Tribunal, inter alia, partially rejected the
Respondent's request for the Claimant to produce certain documents and confirm one category of

information, as it considered the request untimely under Procedural Order No. 1.

On March 16, 2016, the Respondent submitted to the Tribunal a Protection Request, requesting
safety measures for a witness that had asked for protection for fear of retaliation as a result of his
or her witness statement (“Witness X”), which was opposed by the Claimant by letter dated
March 17, 2016. By Procedural Order No. 13, dated March 21, 2016, the Tribunal requested the
Respondent to submit by the date for the submission of its Rejoinder, a complete unredacted
version of Witness X’s witness statement solely to the Tribunal, and postponed its decision
regarding the safety measure for Witness X, clarifying at the same that that this should not to be

understood as an admission or acceptance of Witness X’s witness statement or of its contents.

On March 21, 2016, the Respondent submitted its Rejoinder on the Merits and Reply to the
Objections to Jurisdiction and Admissibility (“Respondent’s Rejoinder”), along with the witness
statements of Félix César Navarro Miranda (“Minister Navarro’s Witness Statement”), Andrés
Chajmi (“Chajmi’s Witness Statement”), RWS-5, RWS-6 and Witness X (“Witness X’s
Witness Statement”) and the additional witness statement of witness Félix Gonzales Bernal
(“Gob. Gonzales’ Second Witness Statement”), the additional expert reports of Kadri Dagdelen
(“Second Dagdelen Report”, with its annexes DAG-19 to DAG-23) and Brattle (“Second
Brattle Report”, with its annexes BR-74 to BR-122), and the expert report of Patrick R. Taylor
(“Taylor Report’, with its annexes TAY-0 to TAY-10), annexes R-155 to R-295 and legal
authorities RLA-185 to RLA-280. In accordance with the Tribunal’s instructions, Bolivia

submitted unredacted versions of Witness X’s witness statement only to the PCA and the Tribunal.

By letter dated March 23, 2016, the Claimant objected the admissibility of four witness statements
submitted by the Respondent with its Rejoinder and requested a 45-day extension to submit its

Rejoinder to the Respondent’s Objections to Jurisdiction and Admissibility.

By Procedural Order No. 14, dated April 1, 2016, the Tribunal approved the protection of Witness
X’s identity and ordered the execution of a Protective Order (included as Annex A to the
Procedural Order) before the Claimant, its agents, witnesses and experts could be provided with

Witness X’s identity and witness statement.

By Procedural Order No. 15, dated April 9, 2016, the Tribunal admitted into the record two of the
four witness statements objected to by the Claimant (Minister Navarro’s Witness Statement and
Chajmi’s Witness Statement) and excluded the other two (RWS-5 y RWS-6), and granted the

Claimant an extension until May 2, 2016 to submit its Rejoinder to Respondent’s Objections.

PCA Case No. 2013-15
Award

On April 22, 2016, by Procedural Order No. 16, the Tribunal rejected the Respondent’s request

to reconsider the decision in Procedural Order No. 15 and confirmed said decision in its entirety.

On April 29, 2016, by Procedural Order No. 17, the Tribunal rejected the Claimant’s request to
adopt a specific procedure for the examination of two witnesses whose witness statements the

Claimant intended to submit with its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction.

On May 2, 2016, the Claimant submitted its Rejoinder Memorial to Respondent’s Objections to
Jurisdiction and Admissibility (“Claimant’s Rejoinder Memorial on Jurisdiction”), along the
redacted versions of the two aforementioned witness statements (CWS-14 y CWS-15), the further
witness statement of Ralph Fitch (“Fitch’s Second Witness Statement”), the third witness
statements of W.J. Mallory (“Mallory’s Third Witness Statement”) and Xavier Gonzales
Yutronic (“Gonzales Yutronic’s Third Witness Statement”), annexes C-300 to C-335 and legal
authorities CLA-129 (updated) and CLA-179 to CLA-200.

By Procedural Order No. 18, dated May 6, 2016, the Tribunal rejected the Claimant’s request to
adopt another special procedure to examine the two witnesses mentioned in Procedural Order

No. 17.

By Procedural Order No. 19, dated May 17, 2016, the Tribunal excluded from the record the two
witness statements under consideration (CWS-14 and CWS-15) and authorized the Secretary to

the Tribunal to destroy the unredacted versions which had been submitted.

By letters dated May 26, 2016, the Parties communicated to the PCA and the Tribunal the list of
witnesses and experts of their respective counterparties that each intended to summon to the

Hearing. The PCA conveyed the lists of each Party to the other on May 27, 2016.

On June 1, 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 20, which excluded from the record
the documents the Claimant had submitted in its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and whose exclusion
the Claimant had consented to, rejecting at the same time the Respondent’s request to strike

certain sections of the Rejoinder and other documents submitted with it.

On June 6, 2016, the Parties, the Tribunal and the PCA held a conference call to discuss the
organization of the Hearing, which the Parties had already been able to discuss among themselves
and agree in part. The following individuals participated in the conference call: (i) on behalf of
the Claimant, Henry G. Burnett and Cedric Soule, both from King & Spalding, LLP, and (ii) on
behalf of the Respondent, Carmiiia Llorenti, Pablo Menacho, Marcelo Fernandez and Maria
Virginia Martinez, all from the Attorney General’s Office (Procuraduria General del Estado),

and Eduardo Silva Romero, José Manuel Garcia Represa and Juan Felipe Merizalde, all from

Dechert LLP. By e-mail dated June 7, 2016, the PCA made the audio recording of the conference

call available to the Parties on the PCA’s website.
On June 9, 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 21 concerning the Hearing.

On June 30, 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 22 in which it rejected the Claimant’s
request to strike certain information from the record but admitted the incorporation into the record
of the proposed legal authorities. Additionally, the Tribunal observed that the photographs of the
blank pages were already in the record and declared that, if the objection to the authenticity of
these pages was maintained, the issue of their inspection would be dealt at the close of the
Hearing. The Tribunal partially rejected the admission of certain documents requested by the

Respondent, admitting certain new documents into the record.

On June 28, 2016, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it had received certain documents
from the Canadian Government which might be relevant for the present arbitration proceedings.
Bolivia had advised at the time of the submission of its Rejoinder that it had requested such
documents and it had reserved its right to submit these documents once it received them. By letter
dated June 28, 2016, Bolivia reiterated that it reserved its right to request the admission of such

documents into the record.

By e-mail dated July 5, 2016, the Claimant requested the Tribunal to order the Respondent to
submit some of the documents that had been admitted by the Tribunal in its Procedural Order
No. 22 with “R-” exhibit numbering, or, alternatively, to allow the Claimant to submit them,

labelled with “C-” exhibit numbering.

By letter dated July 6, 2016, the Tribunal, inter alia, invited the Claimant to submit the
aforementioned documents that the Claimant had referred to in its prior e-mail, as exhibits with

“C-” exhibit numbers. These documents were labelled as C-335 and C-336.

By letter dated July 8, 2016, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to order the Claimant to
produce, under category 11 of the RRDD, the unredacted versions of five of the documents that
the Canadian government had produced to the Respondent in redacted form, whose versions had

been annexed to said letter.*

77. On May 24, 1988, Bolivia and the United Kingdom signed the Treaty, which entered into force
on February 16, 1990.’ In September 1990, Bolivia passed the Investment Law Act No. 1182 (Ley

de Inversiones N° 1182).8 On December 9, 1992, the Treaty’s effects were extended to Bermuda.”

78. In 1997, Bolivia carried out a reform of the legal framework of the mining sector through Law
Act No. 1777 (Ley N’ 1777), which — according to the Claimant — implemented several reforms

to encourage investment in the mining sector.'°

The Claimant’s Corporate Structure

79. SAS was established in October 7, 1994, in Hamilton, Bermuda under the name General Minerals
Corporation Limited (“General Minerals”).'' According to the Claimant, the purpose of the
company — created by a group of geologists, including Mr. Ralph Fitch, witness in this arbitration
— was to identify, explore and develop mineral properties around the world, especially in South

America. '*

80. On November 7, 2003, Mr. Felipe Malbran, Mr. Fernando Rojas and Mr. Carlos Ferreira
incorporated in La Paz, Bolivia, the company Compajfifa Minera Malku Khota (“CMMK*” or the

“Company’”) “for the purpose of exploring, developing, managing and exploiting the Malku

213

Khota Mining Project

81. The shares of CMMK were subsequently transferred on December 12, 2003, to Malku Khota Ltd.,
on October 15, 2007, to Productora Ltd., and on October 16, 2007, to G.M. Campana Ltd."

87. On July 30, 2003, General Minerals Bolivia — one of the Company’s Bolivian subsidiaries —
entered into a Unilateral Promise of Sale for the Daniel and Cobra mining concessions belonging
to Patricia Urquiza de Kempff and Francisco Rolando Kempff Mercado, respectively.” Later,
General Minerals Bolivia yielded the Unilateral Promise of Sale to CMMK, who acquired the

concessions on March 30, 2007.*!

88. On May 4, 2005, CMMK acquired the Alkasi, Takhuani, Takhaua and Jalsuri mining concessions
from Mr. Malbran.* Later, on September 22, 2006, CMMK acquired the Antacuna and Silluta
mining concessions from Silex Bolivia S.A.** Almost two years later, on April 22, 2008, CMMK
acquired the Norma mining concession from Mr. Hugo Murillo Velazco.** Finally, on April 5,
2007, the Regional Superintendent of Mines Potosi-Chuquisaca (Superintendencia Regional de

Minerta de Potosi-Chuquisaca) granted the Viento mining concession to CMMK.*°

89. These ten mining concessions (the “Mining Concessions”) constituted 219 mining blocks located
in over 5.475 hectares and formed almost the whole area of the Malku Khota mining project (the

“Project”).*°

90. Between 2004 and 2005, CMMK conducted its first ground exploration campaign collecting and
analyzing data.*’ Later, in 2005, CMMK partnered with Silex Bolivia, S.A., a mining services
company, to complete a substantial program of ground and underground sampling. ** These

activities resulted in the identification of three aim areas: Limosna, Wara Wara and Sucre.*?

91. On October 5, 2006, the former Governor of Potosi, Mario Virreira Iporre, granted CMMK the
Dispensation Certificate for Mining Exploration Activities (Certificado de Dispensaci6n para las

Actividades de Exploracién Minera).*° Since 2005, CMMK has hired the Fundacién Medmin

(“Medmin’”), a Bolivian environmental consultancy firm, to assist in the development of an

environmental program and to secure an environmental license.*! Between 2006 and 2012,

1 Ti he

Medmin carried out “over eight and ic ic studies, i if

reports filed with the environmental department of the Government of Potosi’.

92. From May 2007 until December 2010, CMMK has conducted an underground exploration
program.“ On the basis of resource estimates as of November 2008, external mining consultants
Pincock Allen & Holt completed a Preliminary Economic Assessment for the Malku Khota Project

in March 2009 (the “PEA 2009”).“*

93. On March 31, 2011, CMMK published the update results of the PEA by GeoVector and on May
10, 2011, it issued the corresponding completed technical report (the “PEA 2011”).*° The PEA
2011 explained the additional recollected data and the company’s progress in the creation of a
hydrometallurgical process to recover the different precious and other metals contained in the

Malku Khota sandstone.*°

94. In order to extract these diverse metals from the sandstone mined in Malku Khota, the Claimant

On May 28, 2012, a meeting took place between the Government's officials and the communities,
in which the Company was not present, but which Mr. Angulo nevertheless attended as
community member. * The meeting minutes record that CMMK would continue with its
exploration activities and would resume the social programs in the communities.*? However,
according to Mr. Angulo, the Minister of Mining told the attending community members that the
Vice-President of Bolivia had suggested to stop supporting the Project and request the

Government’s support in that respect.

On June 12, 2012, the authorities that created the Coordinadora Territorial Originaria Auténoma
de los Seis Ayllus (“COTOA-6A”) met with Mr. Satil Reque, Mr. Guillermo Funes and Mr. Xavier
Gonzales to convey the demands of collaboration and assistance to the organization and of aid at

ensuring the security of the area.°!

On June 19, 2012, Xavier Gonzales met with the Vice-Minister of Mining (Viceministro de
Mineria), the Legal Director at the Ministry of Mining (Director Legal Del Ministerio de Mineria)
and the General Director of Environment at the Ministry of Mining (Director General de
Medioambiente del Ministerio de Mineria). According to Mr. Gonzales, at the meeting, they
offered two options to overcome the opposition: either form a partnership with the Government

or conduct a prior inquiry to the different parties interested (“[ellos] ofrecieron dos opciones para

 

sobreponerse a [la] oposicién: ya sea entrar en una asociacion (Contrato de Asociacién) con el

Gobierno, o realizar una consulta previa a las diferentes partes interesadas”).

The Social Dimension of the Project

The area where the Mining Concessions are located is principally inhabited by indigenous people,
Aymara and Quechua, which are organized in communities, which in turn are grouped in ayllus.°
This organization has an established form of leadership and decision-making policy, which is

mainly through consensus.“

B. THE RESPONDENT ‘S RELIEF
185. In its Rejoinder, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal grants the following relief:?°°

“9.1 On jurisdiction and admissibility

715. Declares:

a. That it lacks jurisdiction over all Claimant’s claims, as SAS has no investment
protected by the Treaty as it has not proven to be the actual proprietor of the
Mining Concessions;

b. alternatively, that these claims are inadmissible as SAS does not have “clean
hands” and does not comply with the requirement of legality of the investment;
and,

716. Orders:

a. SAS to reimburse Bolivia entirely for the costs incurred in the defense of its

interests in the current arbitration, along with the interests at the reasonable
commercial rate in the Arbitral Tribunal’s opinion from the moment the State
incurred in such costs until the date of its effective payment; and

 

b. Any other satisfactory measure to the State as the Arbitral Tribunal deems
appropriate.

9.2 On the Merits

717. If, par impossible, the Arbitral Tribunal decides that it has jurisdiction and the
claims are admissible, declares:

a. that Bolivia has acted in accordance with the Treaty and the international law
when declaring the Reversion;

b. that Bolivia has acted in accordance with its obligation of providing the investment
a fair and equal treatment;

c that Bolivia has acted in accordance with its obligation of not adopting arbitrary
and discriminatory measures that impairs the use and benefit of the investment;

d. that Bolivia has acted in accordance with its obligation of not granting a less
favorable treatment to the investments of SAS in regards to its own investors; and

e. that, in any case, SAS has contributed to the production of the damage that it
claims and sets such contribution in, at least 75%, reducing in this sense the
compensation that Arbitral Tribunal may provide; and

718. Orders:
a. SAS to entirely reimburse Bolivia for the costs incurred in the defense of its
interests in the current arbitration, along with the interests at the reasonable

commercial rate in the Arbitral Tribunal’s opinion from the moment the State
incurred in such costs until the date of its effective payment; and

b. Any other satisfactory measure to the State as the Arbitral Tribunal may deem
appropriate.”

PCA Case No. 2013-15

APPLICABLE LAW
1. The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant submits that its claims are based on Treaty provisions, as supplemented by
international law.’ SAS claims that the applicable law in an investment dispute is the Treaty

itself, as primary source of law?

and lex specialis, as supplemented by general principles of
international law, as needed.” The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the “Vienna
Convention”) provides that international law governs international treaties and prevails over

domestic law in the area of international responsibility?!

The Claimant opposes the Respondent’s argument that the Parties have not agreed on the law
governing the dispute, as the Treaty, supplemented where appropriate by relevant principles of
international law, was the law selected.?!' SAS argues that by consenting to arbitrate disputes
relating to the Treaty, the Parties have effectively designated the Treaty as applicable law, which
constitutes lex specialis governing the relationship between SAS and Bolivia.”'? Therefore, the

Tribunal is not vested with broad discretion to determine the applicable law.?'?

Second, the Claimant believes that the scope of indigenous community rights in international law
is unclear and cannot take precedence over the protections granted by the Treaty. SAS contends
that Article 31 of the Vienna Convention contains a general rule of interpretation of treaties that
reflects customary international law, and implies a holistic approach to elucidate the real meaning
of the terms of the Treaty, considering together its text, its context and, the object and purpose of
the Treaty.?!4 The rule provided in Article 31(1) sets out the primary rule for the interpretation of
treaties and, in that sense, Article 31(3)(c) is part of a larger interpretation process, resulting from
considering first the plain meaning of the words in their context, and in the light of the object and

purpose of the treaty.?!>

In any case, SAS agrees with the notion that treaties should be construed in harmony with

international law, but submits that Bolivia failed to demonstrate how the application of the

systemic integration principle would effectively result in a reduction of the protections granted to
SAS under the Treaty.”!° Moreover, Bolivia fails to explain how the specific instruments it would
have the Tribunal take into consideration fall within the purview of a truly systemic integration
of the Treaty with customary international law.?!’ The Claimant asserts that there are three
conditions that must be met for the application of other provisions under Article 31(3)(c) of the
Vienna Convention: (i) that the human rights instrument constitutes a binding source of
international law identified under Article 38 of the ICJ Statute (sine qua non condition); (ii) that

this rule is relevant, and (iii) that it is also applicable in the relations between the Parties.*!*

The Claimant contends that three of the instruments relied upon by the Respondent are non-
binding, de lege ferenda, and lack the State practice and opinio juris elements that would

transform them into embodiments of customary international law. 7!”

Regarding the three
conventions mentioned by the Respondent — the 1969 American Convention on Human Rights,
the 1994 Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence
against Women, and the International Labor Organization Convention No. 169 — the Claimant
argues that they can only be binding if the Parties were contracting parties to the treaties relied

20

upon,” and the Claimant points to the fact that the United Kingdom is not a party to any of these
three treaties.”! The Claimant argues that as the abovementioned documents do not constitute
customary international law or general principles of law, the Tribunal could not rely on them as

222

proper “rules” of international law pursuant to Article 31(3)(c) of the Vienna Convention.

The Claimant asserts that international arbitration tribunals have had an opportunity to make
issues of indigenous peoples’ rights outcome-determinative, and have declined to do so.?% In
particular, SAS relies on Grand River v. United States, Glamis Gold v. United States, and von

Pezold yv. Zimbabwe.***

The Claimant concludes that the Respondent failed to meet its burden of proof that indigenous

rights prevail over the protections granted to the Claimant under the Treaty in case of conflict.

PCA Case No. 2013-15
Award

According to the Claimant, the case law of the Inter-American Court on Human Rights relied
upon by Bolivia is inapplicable here because the United Kingdom is not party to the 1969

26

American Convention on Human Rights,*”° and because the Respondent has not adduced any

evidence establishing that erga omnes State obligations include the protection of indigenous

227

rights.

193. Finally, the Claimant argues that Bolivian law is of limited relevance for the dispute.??* The
Claimant does not dispute that Bolivian law may be relevant to certain limited areas of the dispute
(such as the “legality doctrine”); but this does not meant that Bolivian law forms part of the law
applicable to the merits of the arbitration proceeding.” The Tribunal should treat Bolivian law
as a factual circumstance to be taken into consideration when assessing whether Bolivia breached

its obligations under the Treaty, as has been done in other investment arbitration decisions.”

2. The Respondent’s Position

194. The Respondent argues that given that the Treaty does not contain an “applicable law” clause,
and there is no agreement between the Parties on this matter, the Tribunal is vested with broad
discretion to determine the applicable law given the circumstances of the case. This power is
envisaged in Article 35(1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, and Article 1054 of the
Netherlands Arbitration Act, the law of the seat of this arbitration.*! While exercising this broad
discretion, the Tribunal must conclude that it will be appropriate and necessary to interpret the
Treaty in light of the sources of international and domestic law that guarantee protection of the

rights of the Indigenous Communities that inhabit the area of the Project.

195. First, the Respondent suggests a “systemic interpretation” of the Treaty based on Article 31(3)(c)
of the Vienna Convention, interpreted broadly and not limited to rules that are binding for both
Parties. 7*? Systemic interpretation allows for the supplementation of the Treaty with other

234

international law norms” and the application of a conflicts rule according to which the Treaty

cannot breach the Parties’ international obligations; therefore, the Treaty must be interpreted

consistently with those obligations.?** Consequently, according to the Respondent, the Tribunal
should resort to the sources of law that protect the right of Indigenous Communities to provide
content to certain concepts that are constantly evolving such as fair and equitable treatment, full
protection and security, arbitrariness, and the legality or illegality of an expropriation.”*° Bolivia
notes that SAS adopts an excessively formalistic view of Article 31(3)(c) of the Vienna

Convention and that Article 31 does not establish a hierarchy for its subsections.?*”

In this connection, the Respondent, relying upon a case before the Inter-American Court of
Human Rights and findings of the International Law Commission (“ILC”)”**, asserts that in cases
of conflict, when systemic interpretation cannot ensure harmony among norms, the Arbitral
Tribunal must take into account that under public international law, obligations concerning the
fundamental rights of the indigenous communities prevail over obligations concerning foreign
investment protection.”” This primacy is supported by two factors identified by the ILC: Article
103 of the United Nations Charter and the erga omnes characteristics of the principles and the
norms concerning fundamental human rights.™“° In turn, respect for human rights implies respect

for the fundamental rights of the indigenous peoples.™!

The Respondent argues that, in addition to international law, the Tribunal must apply and consider
Bolivian law in interpreting the scope of the rights and obligations provided for in the Treaty,”
and asserts that this is particularly relevant in the absence of any inconsistency between
international law and domestic law.” Bolivia refers to some decisions of international tribunals

that have applied the domestic law of the host State of the investment for certain issues.**

According to the Respondent, Bolivia’s law is relevant to determine at least three fundamental

issues of this case: (i) whether the obligation of providing fair and equitable treatment was

245

  

complied witl (ii) whether there exists a public purpose in case of expropriation,° and (iii)

whether the investment was performed in accordance with the relevant rules under domestic law

to establish the admissibility of SAS’ claims.™7

199. In order to guarantee the protection of the Indigenous Communities, the Tribunal must construe
the Treaty in accordance with five Bolivian laws and international law instruments: (i) the 1969
American Convention on Human Rights;** (ii) the 1994 Inter-American Convention on the
Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence against Women; (iii) ILO Convention No.
169;?%° (iv) the 2007 United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples,”*! and (v)

the Political Constitution of the Plurinational State of Bolivia.

200. Finally, the Respondent argues that, in the course of interpretation, the Tribunal should also take
into consideration: (i) general principles of law, whose application is particularly important as the
Treaty remains silent on the applicable law, including the principles of clean hands, good faith,
and nemo auditur propriam turpitudinem and nullus commodum capere de sua injuria propria;
(ii) customary international law, which requires protection of the fundamental rights of the
Indigenous Communities; ?* and (iii) within applicable customary business practices and as

the factual circumstances underlying this dispute. Bolivian law, which must be applied to
supplement the provisions under the Treaty, comprises, even under its highest-ranking

of human and indigenous rights which are binding on the State and on individuals; the State being

legally responsible for reasonably preventing the violation of such rights.?°> These international
instruments have constitutional status under domestic law.**° Since 1967, the Bolivian legal and
regulatory framework recognizes the autonomy and the right to self-government of indigenous
peoples, and incorporates international treaties.?*”

The Respondent alleges that these provisions of Bolivian and international law must be applied
as supplementary rules, rather than elements of fact.?** In the cases cited by the Claimant, the
tribunals did not have to analyze the applicability of these rules since the dispute was decided
based on other legal arguments.”*? Moreover, some of the cases cited by SAS confirm that
domestic legislation and international law are applicable to matters not governed by the Treaty,

provided that they do not entail independent claims.”

At any rate, given the “unique and serious facts of this case,”**!

the rules on the protection of
human and indigenous rights are essential for the resolution of the dispute because: (i) the cases
cited by SAS confirm that domestic legislation and international law are applicable to matters not
governed by the Treaty, provided that they do not involve independent claims;”” (ii) it is beyond
question that CMMK was obligated to comply with the law applicable to an extractive project in
Bolivia, which includes rules on the protection of the communities;” (iii) the Tribunal must
consider Bolivia’s obligations under the rules cited in order to decide that, inter alia, the
Reversion was a legitimate exercise of public power, involving a valid public purpose, and

consistent with the legitimate expectations protected under the Treaty,” and (iv) the Tribunal

 

must endeavor to provide a harmonious interpretation of Bolivia’s international obligations.?® In
this regard, Bolivia notes that the Tribunal must endeavor to provide a harmonious interpretation
of Bolivia’s international obligations, and, if it is impossible to do so, it must prioritize the

obligations related to the protection of human rights. Bolivia notes that the Treaty itself makes

other sources of international law relevant in order to determine whether Bolivia effectively

fulfilled its obligations, for example, when referring to the exercise of police powers.”

3. The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Parties’ arguments on the applicable law touch upon three issues which the Tribunal must
address at the outset of its analysis, namely: (i) whether the Parties have selected the applicable
law to the dispute; (ii) what is the scope of the treaty interpretation rules that the Tribunal must
apply when construing the Treaty; (iii) what is the relevance and scope of Bolivian law and of the
instruments for the protection of human and indigenous rights which are applicable to the present

dispute. The Tribunal will examine each one of these issues in the order in which they were raised.

In the first place, the Parties disagree on whether they can determine the law applicable to the
dispute. The Claimant contends that its claim are based on the Treaty, supplemented by the
applicable law, and disagrees with Bolivia’s position that there exists no agreement between the
Parties on the law applicable to the dispute.”°’ The Respondent, for its part, points out that in
absence of an applicable law clause in the Treaty or an agreement of the Parties thereon, the
Tribunal possesses broad discretion to decide on the applicable law, taking into account the special

circumstances of this case, which militate in favor of interpreting the Treaty in light of the sources

  

of international and domestic law that guarantee the protection of the Indigenous Communities

rights.

Indeed, the Tribunal observes that the Treaty does not contain an express provision by which the
Contracting Parties have decided on an applicable law to the disputes that may arise between them
and nationals or companies of the other State. However, the Tribunal notes that, as the Claimant
noted, the Parties agree that the starting point for the Tribunal is the Treaty.” The Parties gave
their consent to submit to arbitration their differences “concerning an obligation of the latter
[Contracting Party] under this Agreement”.’” For the Tribunal, the absence of an express choice
of applicable law in the Treaty does not imply that the Contracting Parties have left it to the
adjudicator to determine such law to the extent that it may cease to apply the Treaty or to give it

priority as a primary source in order to apply other sources of law.

Award

Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the Treaty is the principal instrument by which it must resolve
the dispute between the Parties and on the basis of which it must decide (i) whether SAS is an
investor protected under the Treaty; (ii) whether it has made an investment in Bolivia protected
by the Treaty: (iii) whether SAS’ claims are admissible; (iv) whether Bolivia has violated the

Treaty, and (v) whether, as a result of the above, Bolivia has to pay compensation to SAS.

The claims of the Parties and the following issues show that the core of the dispute between the
Parties on the applicable law does not focus on the application of the Treaty for the settlement of
this dispute, but rather on the applicable rules of interpretation and the scope and relevance of

Bolivian law and instruments of human and indigenous rights in these proceedings.

Indeed, the Parties agree that Article 31 of the Vienna Convention sets forth the rules of
interpretation for the Treaty. The Respondent considers that these rules point towards a systemic
interpretation which allows the integration and harmonization of other international and domestic
obligations with the text of the Treaty, and in case of conflict, grants priority to the rules for the
protection of human and indigenous rights.?”! The Claimant, for its part, argues that Article 31 of
the Vienna Convention provides for an interpretative process in which the meaning of the
language, understood in good faith and in the context of the treaty and in accordance with its

2m

object and purpose, must prevail.*”* The Claimant does not deny that a systemic interpretation

shall be sought, but it contends that Bolivia did not manage to demonstrate that the rules of

protection of human and indigenous rights actually had the alleged priority.”

Article 31 of the Vienna Convention contains the rule of interpretation of international treaties,
which forms part of the rules of customary international law.’ According to this provision,
international treaties must be interpreted in good faith, according to the ordinary meaning of the
language, in its context and in accordance with the object and purpose of the treaty.?”> Article
31(2) indicates what is to be understood as the context of an international treaty and Article 31(3)
describes other elements to be taken into account together with the context, including”(c) [a]ny
relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties”. Article 31(4)

refers to the special meaning to be given to the terms defined by the Parties.

Award

212. The Tribunal finds that the different elements that Article 31 refers to are part of the same
hermeneutic operation, which is in no way limited to defining in a literal manner the meaning of
each of the words used in the treaty. As pointed out in the heading of Article 31 of the Vienna
Convention, it is a single rule of treaty interpretation. In this sense, the Tribunal shares the Parties’
understanding that systemic interpretation exists as a tool for treaty interpretation. This tool,

however, is not limitless and must be applied with caution.

213. The Parties submitted articles by well-known authors that extolled the virtues of the systemic
interpretation in order to harmonize rules of international law, but they at the same time remarked
on some of the challenges and difficulties a tribunal may face when applying Article 31(3)(c) of

the Vienna Convention.

214. In particular, the Parties referred to an article by a prominent author regarding the principle of
systemic interpretation and Article 31(3)(c) of the Vienna Convention. In that article, the author
points out a specific difference between the task of interpretation and the existence of rules for
the settlement of disputes: in his opinion, the task of interpretation precedes the application of
rules for the settlement of the dispute. *” Thus, the interpretation approach adopted by

Article 31(3)(c) of the Vienna Convention is not designed to settle autonomously conflicts

between norms in international law,?”’ notwithstanding that it may contribute to avoid conflicts

and harmonize the rules of international law by way of interpretation.?”* This understanding
seems to be shared by another author mentioned by the Parties, Judge Bruno Simma, who warned

that systemic interpretation allows for harmonization through interpretation but it cannot be used

to modify a treaty.?””

215. Additionally, Bolivia referred expressively to the Oil Platforms Case (Iran v. United States), in

which the International Court of Justice used Article 31(3)(c) of the Vienna Convention to

276 RLA-8, C. McLachlan, The Principle of Systemic Integration and Article 31(3)(c) of the Vienna Convention, 54 International
and Comparative Law Quarterly, 2005, p. 286. (“Interpretation, on the other hand, precedes all of these techinques, since it is
only by means of a process of interpretation that it is possible to determine whether there is in fact a true conflict of norms at
all. By the same token, the application of a technique of interpretation that permits reference to other rules of international law
offers the enticing prospect of averting conflict of norms, by enabling the harmonization of rules rather than the application of
one norm to the exclusion of another. It is therefore to the process of interpretation that we must now turn.”).

interpret Treaty of Amity and bring in the provisions on the use of force in international law.*?
Some of the authors relied on by the Parties consider that this decision must be treated with
caution”*! and, referring to some of the declarations, indicate some of the difficulties that may
arise from applying Article 31(3)(c) of the Vienna Convention in matters of jurisdiction and
normsative conflict. Indeed, the ICJ’s jurisdiction cannot be extended to cover other treaties via
Article 31(3)(c) of the Vienna Convention if the States have not consented to such jurisdiction,
nor can they be brought in to the dispute “through the back door”. It is equally forbidden to

alter the applicable law through rules of treaty interpretation.***

216. Based on the above, the Tribunal finds that the principle of systemic interpretation is part of the
rules of interpretation of international treaties foreseen in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention.
However, this principle must be applied in harmony with the rest of the provisions of the same
article and cautiously, in order to prevent the tribunal from exceeding its jurisdiction and applying

rules to the dispute which the Parties have not agreed to.

217. It is not disputed that Article 31(3)(c) of the Vienna Convention is a rule applicable to the
interpretation of the Treaty. Based on this provision, Bolivia argues that the Tribunal must apply
certain international rules on human rights protection. However, it has not justified why the
Tribunal must apply in this particular case various rules that do not constitute customary law, nor
has it shown that either of Bolivia or the United Kingdom are parties to the human rights treaties
invoked. The Respondent also fails to explain how these rules conflict with the Treaty or why

they should prevail over its provisions.

218. The final issue that the Tribunal must assess in regard to the applicable law is the scope to be
given to Bolivian law. The Parties agree that Bolivian law may be relevant for certain issues in

this arbitration (e.g., the decision on the legality of the investment). There is no doubt for the

independently of the relevant rules of international law on the use of force, so as to be capable of being successfully invoked,
even in the limited context of a claim for breach of the Treaty, in relation to an unlawful use of force. The application of the
relevant rules of international law relating to this question thus forms an integral part of the task of interpretation entrusted to
the Court by Article XXI, paragraph 2, of the 1955 Treaty.”)

VI OBJECTIONS TO JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY

219. The Respondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because the Claimant is not the owner
of a protected investment under the Treaty (A). Likewise, the Respondent alleges that, even if the
Tribunal decided that it has jurisdiction, the Claimant’s lack of clean hands and the violation of

the principle of legality would render the Claimant’s claims inadmissible (B).

A. THE TRIBUNAL LACKS JURISDICTION TO DECIDE ANY OF THE CLAIMS AS SAS DOES NOT
HAVE A PROTECTED INVESTMENT UNDER THE TREATY SINCE IT HAS FAILED TO PROVE THAT
IT IS THE TRUE OWNER OF THE MINING CONCESSIONS

 

220. The Parties do not dispute that the Claimant is a company according to the terms of Article 1(d)
of the Treaty’** and that the shares in CMMK and the Mining Concessions fit the definition of
“investment” under the Treaty.”*° However, the Respondent argues that the Treaty does not protect
SAS, and that SASC is the real entity that owns the investment, which is not protected by the
Treaty since it is a Canadian entity. The Respondent argues that the Claimant is a mere shell
company which is not protected under the Treaty. The Respondent bases its objection in particular

on the text of Article 8(1) of the Treaty.

1. The Respondent’s Position
(a) Scope of Article 8(1) of the Treaty

221. The Respondent alleges that ownership is a sine qua non requirement for the jurisdiction of the

1287 £288

Tribunal’*’ and that the Claimant is not the real owner of the investmen

222. Article 8(1) of the Treaty provides for international arbitration for the settlement of “disputes
between a national or company of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party
concerning an obligation of the latter under this Agreement in relation to an investment of the

former’.?® The Respondent argues that requirement of ownership is shown by the use of the

286 Statement of Claim and Memorial, paras. 109-110; Counter-Memorial, para. 224; C-1, Treaty, Article I(a): “(a)

includes: (...] (ii) shares in and stock and debentures of a company and any other form of participation in a company; {...] (v)

to search for, cultivate, extract or exploit natural resources.”

preposition “de”, denoting ownership, in the Spanish phrase “en relacién con una inversion de la
primera” (“concerning an investment of the former”). The preposition “of”, in the English version
of the Treaty also denotes ownership.’ The Respondent claims that the prepositions “de” and

“of” necessarily imply a direct connection between the investor and the investment.”*!

223. The Respondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction as CMMK’s shareholders are Malku
Khota Ltd., G.M. Campana Ltd. and Productora Ltd., all of which are companies incorporated in
the Bahamas, and CMMK, holder of the Mining Concessions, is a company incorporated in
Bolivia. None of these companies has protection under the Treaty since they are not incorporated
in the United Kingdom. There is no direct link between the Claimant and the investment,” and
it is not disputed that the direct owners of the investment in this case are companies that are not

protected under the Treaty.””

224. The Respondent contends that a reading of Article 8(1) in accordance with the ordinary meaning
to be given to the terms of the Treaty, under Article 31 of the Vienna Convention,” leads to the
finding that a fundamental requirement for jurisdiction is the Claimant’s ownership of the
investment” and that such ownership be direct. Respondent contends that “the text [of Article
31 of the Vienna Convention], coupled with Article 8(1) [...] confirms that the intention of the

Contracting Parties to the Treaty was to protect direct investments. In claris non fit

interpretatio.”*"”

225. The Respondent understands that for the term “ownership” to include relatively modern concepts
such as ownership through intermediary companies, using sophisticated corporate structures, the

Treaty would need to make express reference to ‘indirect’ ownership.”* Otherwise, it would

company which is incorporated or constituted under the law in force in any part of its own territory, and in which nationals or
companies of the other Contracting Parties own shares, it shall ensure that the provisions of paragraph (1) of this Article are
applied to the extent necessary to guarantee Prompt adequate and effec tive compensation in respect of their investment to such
nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party whi those shares” (emphasis added by Respondent).

imply rewriting the Treaty, as if it read “concerning a [direct or indirect] investment of the former”.
The parties have included the terms they wanted to include and have agreed, and omitted the terms

they did not wish to include and on which no agreement was reached.”””

The Treaty does not mention indirect investments when establishing the Parties’ consent to
arbitration; had Parties to the Treaty intended to grant such jurisdiction to a Tribunal, they would
have done so expressly.*° The Respondent argues that, contrary to the Claimant’s contention,
“the ICJ in ELSI made it clear that all of a Party’s claim must meet the requirements to be eligible

for jurisdiction and be admissible, unless there is a manifest waiver”!

The Respondent alleges that, as a principle of customary international law, tribunals only have
jurisdiction over disputes for which there is express consent” and, thus, following the reasoning
of the ICJ in ELSI, the Tribunal could depart from applying this principle if there were “words

making clear and intention to do so”, which is not the case.*°

The Respondent suggests that even if the interpretation pursuant to the rules of the Vienna
Convention did not clarify the meaning of the preposition “of”, by applying Article 32 of the
Vienna Convention the same conclusion would be reached taking into consideration the
circumstances under which the Treaty was concluded.* According to the Respondent, when

Bolivia accepts to protect indirect ownership, it does so expressly as evidenced through the

comparison of various contemporaneous treaties.*”° Such choice by the parties must have legal

effects.*°°

229. The Respondent notes that, contrary to the Claimant’s argument, the above-mentioned Article 32
of the Vienna Convention does not limit the sources to the travaux préparatoires, rather states
that “the circumstances of its conclusion” be taken into consideration and, given the ambiguity

of the Treaty text, as stated by the Claimant,*”

other contemporaneous treaties concluded by

Bolivia would be relevant under the same rule of interpretation of the above-mentioned Article

32 of the Vienna Convention.**

protection treaties with Germany and Switzerland that Bolivia concluded in 1987, a year before the execution of the Treaty,
whereby the former does not include the “direct or indirect” reference whereas the latter does. In the Treaty with Switzerland,
Article 1(b)(aa) provides that “[tJhe term “company” means: (aa) in connection with the Swiss Confederation, legal entities
or partnerships without legal personality, but capable to hold assets with a direct or indirect preponderant Swiss interest”,

concluded with Sweden (1990) and Italy (1990). See RLA-210, Treaty between the Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union

investment affected by the Reversion is a Canadian company.*!? The Respondent claims that
SASC uses SAS — a company incorporated under the laws of Bermuda — to access Treaty
protection and that this is a “treaty shopping” maneuver that ignores the text of the Treaty and

should be rejected by the Tribunal.*!

232. According to the Respondent, the ultimate owner is the one that can benefit from the treaties that
protect indirect ownership.*'* The Respondent alleges that only then it would be justified that it
is not relevant “if the investor of one country owns [...] an investment [...] through one or more
intermediary corporate entities”, as stated by the Claimant. This mediate ownership relation
presupposes the existence of intermediary entities being merely instrumental and with no free will
of their own, and for that reason their existence does not affect the asset’s disposition by the

indirect owner.*5
233. The Respondent bases its argument on the following three premises:

(a) _ First, the Respondent notes that the Tribunal is compelled to interpret the Treaty “in good
faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the Treaty in their
context and in the light of its object and purpose” (emphasis added by the Respondent)*'°,
and that the object and purpose of the Treaty is to promote the flow of capital from the

United Kingdom, and not from another country, to Bolivia.*!”

(b) Second, the Respondent claims that when protecting indirect ownership, such ownership

cannot be merely formal, as investment protection treaties seek to transfer value from a

State party to the Treaty to another, as acknowledged by the tribunal in the Standard

Chartered Bank v. Tanzania case.*"*

(c) Finally, the Respondent argues that the cases SAS relies on*!’ demonstrate that when a
Treaty protects indirect ownership, it solely protects the beneficiary or ultimate owner of
the investment.*”° The Siemens tribunal conferred protection to the ultimate owner of the
investment since the Treaty “[did] not require that there [were] not interposed companies
between the investment and the ultimate owner of the company” (emphasis added by
Respondent).*! Relying on Siemens, the Rurelec and Kardassopoulos tribunals granted
protection to the claimants in those cases as the ultimate owners of the investment. *”?
Additionally, in the BG Group v. Argentina case, the tribunal granted protection to the
claimant despite the fact that it was not directly linked to the investment as it was its

ultimate owner.*

234. Thus, the indirect owner of the investment is not the Claimant but SASC, a Canadian company
and, therefore, the Tribunal must decline its jurisdiction and dismiss the claim.* The Claimant
must establish the convergence of the elements on which the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is
based,*?> such as ownership.*”°

235. The Respondent insists that Article 8(1) of the Treaty confers jurisdiction only to investments “of

a company of one Contracting Party’ (emphasis added by Respondent)*”’ and for an asset to

constitute an investment of a company, that company must have an objective link with that asset:
it must have been actively involved in the realization of the investment in the host State (emphasis

added by Respondent).*?8

236. Invoking the “Salini test”, the Respondent explains that the act of investing implies the
verification of four elements: (i) the acquisition of the investment with a corresponding
contribution of resources; (ii) the assumption of risks in order to obtain returns; (iii) a minimum
time duration; and (iv) the contribution to the economic development of the host State.*”? The
Respondent further contends that, in addition to these factors, the form an investment can take is
established by the treaty itself, which is added as another requirement next to the ones listed in
Salini.*°

237. The Respondent relies on the decision in the Quiborax case to state that the mere holding of shares
is insufficient to prove an investment in currency or in kind.**! Moreover, it cites the Caratube
and Standard Chartered Bank cases to underscore that the object and purpose of the investment
treaties require that jurisdiction of the tribunals be limited to those assets that have contributed to
the stimulation of capital flows between certain States, the signatories of the BIT in question.**”
Otherwise, one would be interpreting the Treaty against the principle of the relative effect of

treaties.

238. The Respondent argues that the only indirect owner of the investment is SASC, while the

Claimant “i:

 

simply one of the numerous instruments in the chain that leads to the actual indirect

(b) FTI admits in its report that any amount invested in Bolivia has been contributed by
Canadian SASC and not by the Claimant. “? The President and CEO of SASC
acknowledges that the share issuances of SASC allowed them to finance exploration
activities in Malku Khota.*! Moreover, SAS only communicated the interim consolidated

(f) | The Respondent also contends that press releases show SASC as the ultimate owner of the

investment*” and that SASC is funding the costs of this arbitration.**!

(g) | The Respondent concludes that any contribution to the economic development of Bolivia
would have been made by SASC,*” although it questions whether the Project should be
considered as economic development given the negative impact it had on public order and

the Indigenous Communities.***

Consequently, if the Tribunal would interpret the Treaty to confer protection to indirect ownership,
SAS’ claim must be dismissed due to lack of standing as SAS did not make the investment whose
protection is claimed: neither does it hold the legal title, nor is it the beneficiary of the
investment.*™ Otherwise, the Tribunal would be creating an investment protection treaty between

Canada and Bolivia, which is “illegal, absurd and unfair.”*>

(c) On whether SAS is an interested party in this dispute

The Respondent argues that the object of jurisdiction in investment arbitration cannot be the
protection of a shell company.**° According to the Respondent, the Claimant does not deny being

a shell company, nor has it refuted the evidence presented by the Respondent in this regard.**”

First, the Respondent alleges that the dispute submitted by a shell company cannot be settled

under the Treaty if there is no jurisdiction over the parent company.***

(a) _ First, the Treaty grants jurisdiction only with respect to those companies whose interests
are in dispute.**° The Respondent argues that as shell companies do not exist as an
independent economic reality, they have no interest in a dispute.** The Respondent asserts

that this does not imply adding a jurisdictional requirement to the Treaty as stated by the

Claimant, **!

since the Treaty provides verbatim that the dispute must be between a
company of a Contracting Party and the other Contracting State. Therefore, concluding that
there is no jurisdiction is applying the text of the Treaty, since the dispute in this case is

with a Canadian company, and not with one of the United Kingdom.*

(b) Second, the Respondent argues that the object and purpose of the Treaty confirm this
requirement as the promotion and protection of investments applies solely to investors from
the United Kingdom and Bolivia. Based on Article 31 of the Vienna Convention, the object
and purpose of a treaty are as relevant as its provisions for the interpretation of its

meaning.*

The Respondent argues that the object and purpose of the Treaty, as stated in
the preamble, are not to provide investment protection and arbitral jurisdiction to any
foreign company, and notes that Bolivia has not concluded an investment treaty with
Canada to protect Canadian companies, such as SASC.* Thus, the Respondent concludes
that to allow the use of a shell company to establish jurisdiction would violate the consent

granted by Bolivia.**°

(c) Third, the Respondent notes that arbitral case law (the Loewen, Venoklim Holding and TSA
Spectrum cases) has also confirmed that the content, object, and purpose of the Treaty
preclude jurisdiction over a dispute raised by a shell company.*** The Respondent refers to
the Loewen case, wherein the claimant changed nationality while the arbitration was
ongoing and the tribunal found that the party concerned was no longer protected by the
treaty,°°7 and the Venoklim Holding case, in which the tribunal pierced the corporate veil in
order to ascertain the real party to the dispute, leading the tribunal to conclude that it lacked
jurisdiction.** The Respondent further argues that, notwithstanding the fact that these are
ICSID cases, it is relevant that these tribunals ordered the piercing of the corporate veil as
the ICSID Convention contains a provision analogous to the one found in the Treaty.*

The Respondent holds that SAS invokes decisions of tribunals that declared themselves

competent; however, the cases cited do not support its position as they do not deal with the

same legal issue to be resolved by the Tribunal in this case.*”°

Second, the Respondent alleges that the facts of this case demonstrate that the dispute is not with
the Claimant (SAS), but with SASC, which has an economic interest ab initio in this arbitration
and has sought and guaranteed funding agreements.*”' The Respondent further argues that SASC
issued a special class of shares with returns dependent on the outcome of this arbitration.*”? The
Respondent notes that based on the agreement with the third-party funder of the arbitration, this

party could also have a direct interest in the decision of the Tribunal.*”*

The Respondent concludes that SASC is the only company that performed an alleged investment
and the only one that has an interest in this arbitration. However, given that SASC is a Canadian
company, it is not protected under the Treaty because it does not meet the nationality requirement

provided for under the Treaty.*”4

2. The Claimant’s Position
(a) Scope of Article 8(1) of the Treaty

The Claimant argues that the Treaty broadly defines an ‘investment’ and that international
arbitration tribunals and legal authorities acknowledge that the notion of ‘investments’ in bilateral

investment treaties extends to both direct and indirect investments.*”>

In the case of indirect investments through intermediary corporate entities incorporated under the
legislation of the host State, the protected investment will consist of the investor’s shares in the

local company as well as the assets of that local company.*”

The Claimant submits that Article 8(1) of the Treaty “clearly applies to both the direct and indirect
owners of a qualifying investment”.>" The Claimant argues that the Respondent inaccurately
applies the interpretative principles of the Vienna Convention “relying exclusively upon

dictionaries to inform its reading” and looks into the text of Article 8(1) of the Treaty alone to

address the question of “which entities are entitled to treaty protection for covered
‘investments’”.*"* Citing the decision in Aguas del Tunari v. Bolivia, the Claimant submits that
the proper interpretation of Article 8(1), taking full account of the different elements set forth in
Article 31 of the Vienna Convention -text, context, and object and purpose- is that direct as well

as indirect owners of qualifying investment are covered by the Treaty.*””

247. The Claimant submits that direct ownership is not the only ordinary meaning of the phrase

+» 380

“investment of the former, and the phrase may equally be indicative of a contributory

relationship between the claimant and the investment.**!

The Claimant argues that “[w]ithout
further qualifying language, the phrase ‘investment of the former’ in Article 8(1) can be read as
a purely textual matter requiring that the ownership link be either direct or indirect, as Bolivia

itself acknowledges” .***

248.

oo

Citing CEMEX y. Venezuela, the Claimant argues that the language of the bilateral investment
treaty applicable to this case was very similar to Article 8(1) of the Treaty and that the tribunal in

that case noted:

The Tribunal further notes that, when the BIT mentions investments ‘of’ nationals of
the other Contracting Party, it means that those investments must belong to such
nationals in order to be covered by the Treaty. But this does not imply that they must
be directly owned by those nationals.** (emphasis added by Claimant).

249.

S

Similarly, citing Rurelec, the Claimant alleges that the tribunal, which applied the same treaty as
the one applicable in this arbitration, affirmed the interpretation of the CEMEX v. Venezuela

tribunal, finding that it had jurisdiction in respect of Rurelec’s indirect investments.***

250. The Claimant concludes that the ordinary meaning of the phrase “investment of the former” in
Article 8(1) of the Treaty is that the investment in question may be owned whether directly or
indirectly by the investor, and there is no textual reason for the restrictive interpretation suggested

by the Respondent.***

251. The Claimant notes that the context, the object and purpose of the Treaty support the view that
Article 8(1) applies equally to direct and indirect owners. Regarding the context, the Claimant
argues that, following Article 31(2) of the Vienna Convention, the text of the entire Treaty, not
only Article 8(1), is highly relevant, as it forms part of the context informing the proper

interpretation of the phrase “investment of the former”.**°

252. The Claimant submits that a first contextual element is Article 1(a) of the Treaty, and that is
particularly instructive, as pursuant to it, ‘investments’ are interpreted very broadly, including
necessarily, by virtue of the phrases “every kind of asset” and “any form of participation in a

company”, indirect investments of the kind the Claimant made.**”

253. The Claimant submits that a second contextual element that is relevant is the fact that there is no
express exclusion of indirect investments in the Treaty. *** According to the Claimant, the
Respondent is wrong when concluding that the inclusion of a reference to indirect ownership
would have been necessary if the intent was to include indirect investments.**? The Claimant
relies on the ICJ decision in the ELSI case*”°, the reasoning of the tribunal in Tza Yap Shum v.
Peru,**' and the Rurelec decision, which held as to the application of the Treaty that “the BIT
would require clear language in order to exclude coverage of indirect investments —language that
the BIT does not include”.*** The Claimant argues that investment treaty tribunals have refused
to exclude indirect investments from treaty provisions when there is no express language to that

effect.*9

254. The Claimant submits that in the absence of clear and specific exclusionary language, and in light

of the broad definition of investments in Article 1(a) encompassing indirect investments, the more

jurisprudentially-consistent interpretation of Article 8(1) is that it applies equally to direct and

indirect owners of qualifying investments.*”*

255. The Claimant submits that, contrary to the Respondent’s proposition,*”*

it is not suggesting to
ignore the principle that tribunals have jurisdiction over disputes for which there is express
consent.*”° Rather, the Claimant submits that the parties to the Treaty “have expressly consented
to arbitration in relation to indirect investments because Article 8(1) refers to such investments”

(emphasis added by the Claimant).*””

256. Next, the Claimant criticizes the relevance of those legal authorities relied upon by the
Respondent to support its position.** As to Judge Read’s dissent in Anglo-Jranian Oil, the
Claimant argues that setting aside the fact that his individual opinion did not reflect the majority
view of the ICJ, his discussion of the effect of omitting the terms “directly or indirectly” is
speculative obiter dicta included in his dissent, which Claimant asserts “is hardly persuasive

evidence and should be disregarded’ .*°

257. In connection with the Brown v. Scott case, the Claimant submits that the Respondent
conveniently cited the reasoning in that case, omitting that, according to the Claimant, it noted
that the general assumption on which the Respondent relies “does not mean that nothing can be
implied into the [European Convention on Human Rights]. The language of the Convention is for
the most part so general that some implication of terms is necessary, and the case law of the
European court shows that the court has been willing to imply terms into the Convention when it
was judged necessary or plainly right to do so.”“ The Claimant argues that, “this concern of
overbroadness simply does not exist in the case of bilateral investment treaties whose overt
purpose is to protect foreign investment, and where an interpretation that the phrase ‘investment
of the former’ as covering investments that are owned directly or indirectly by the investor is

entirely consistent with the context of the Treaty” .*°!

jurisdiction was restricted to situations or facts which related directly to treaties or conventions accepted by Persia.”

258. Finally, the Claimant addresses Professor Douglas’ opinion that there must be a limitation on the
tribunal’s ratione personae jurisdiction if the terms “direct or indirect” are not expressly included
ina treaty.” According to the Claimant, the Respondent fails to square this view with Rule 33 of
Douglas’ own treaty, which according to the Claimant's assertion contains a more direct statement
that “[i]f an investment treaty stipulates that the investment can be held directly or indirectly by
the claimant, then it is immaterial that the investment is held through an intermediate legal entity
with the nationality of a third state”.“* The Claimant contends that it is telling that Professor
Douglas does not include the converse as a rule, and further asserts that he refers to two cases
where the tribunals held that they had jurisdiction over the claimants that indirectly owned
qualifying investments, despite the fact that the underlying treaties did not contain the terms
“direct or indirect”.** The Claimant asserts that there are many more cases in this respect, which

are referred to above, than the opposite.“

259. The Claimant submits that the object and purpose of the Treaty also support the view that Article

8(1) applies equally to direct and indirect owners.“ The Claimant refers to the title of the

407 408

Treaty,” its preamble,** and Article 2(1)*” to note that these provisions suggest that the parties

to the Treaty wished to maximize the flow of investments which, according to the Claimant, would

include indirect investments in the absence of language to the contrary.*!°

260. The Claimant concludes that its position regarding Article 8(1) “remains largely unchallenged”
and that this should lead the Tribunal to conclude that it properly has jurisdiction over the claims

in this arbitration.*!!

261. The Claimant believes that the recourse to supplementary means to interpret the Treaty is

412

unnecessary*' in this case. Article 32 of the Vienna Convention does not refer to alternative or

autonomous means of interpretation, but only an aid to the general interpretative rule."

262. In this case, “the general rule of interpretation (Article 31, Vienna Convention) yields a reading
of Article 8(1) of the Treaty that applies to direct as well as indirect owners of qualifying
investments, and there is simply no scope to argue that this reading is in any way ‘ambiguous or
obscure’ or leads to ‘manifestly absurd or unreasonable’ results.”*'* Thus, according to the

Claimant, there is no reason to resort to supplementary means of interpretation.

263. But even if the Tribunal decided to rely upon supplementary means of interpretation, which would
include “the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion” based on
Article 32 of the Vienna Convention,‘ the treaties invoked by the Respondent are not part of
such circumstances. *!® The circumstances referred to under the provision mentioned are
contemporaneous circumstances “and the historical context in which the treaty was concluded”*""

and, thus, it cannot cover treaties concluded after the date the Treaty was signed.*'*

264. Regarding treaties signed before the conclusion of the Treaty, the Respondent has not established
that they are part of these circumstances 4" since it has not demonstrated that the parties to the
Treaty discussed the Bolivia-Switzerland and Bolivia-Germany bilateral investment treaties in
their negotiations, or that the United Kingdom was aware (or should have been aware) of these
two treaties. The Claimant considers telling that the Respondent has failed to submit the travaux
préparatoires, despite the fact that the Claimant had already noted their absence in its Reply

Memorial.”

12 Claimant's Reply Memorial, para. 177. Claimant refers to and describes the argument posed by Respondent that the parties
to the Treaty “deliberatly omitted protection of ‘indirect’ property” because, in 1987, Bolivia entered into treaties with Germany
and Switzerland, and the treaty with Germany did not include a reference to “direct or indirect”, whereas the treaty with
Switzerland did include such a reference (see supra para. 228).

265. The Claimant further contends that the case law in investment arbitration has regularly refused to
rely on other treaties when interpreting the provisions of a specific treaty*?! and concludes by
noting that, consequently, Article 32 of the Vienna Convention is of no assistance to the

422

Respondent's flawed interpretation of Article 8(1) of the Treaty.

(b) On the protection of indirect investors under the Treaty

266. The Claimant submits that for the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to be established, it is sufficient for
the Claimant to show that it satisfies the Treaty definition of ‘national’ or ‘company’ (Articles 1.c
o 1.d), that its investment meets the requirements set forth at Article 1(a), and that it owns, directly
or indirectly, the investment. *?? There are no other requirements under the Treaty and the
Respondent has admitted that SAS is a protected company under the Treaty and that owns
qualifying investments in Bolivia. ‘4 The Claimant further states that: “investment treaty
tribunals have consistently held that it is not open to them to impose additional jurisdictional
requirements on claimants which the parties to the underlying treaty could have added but did

not”.

interpreted the definition of “investment”, all are ICSID cases that are wholly irrelevant to this

430

UNCITRAL Rules arbitration proceeding pursuant to the UK-Bolivia Treaty.

In brief, the Treaty protects indirect owners even when they are not the ultimate owners of the

qualifying investments, because there is no requirement in the Treaty stating otherwise.**!

Second, the Claimant contends that none of the awards the Respondent relies on, provide, as
Bolivia alleges, that an investment treaty that protects indirect ownership only protects ultimate
owners.*” The Claimant submits that the tribunals in Siemens v. Argentina, Kardassopoulos v.
Georgia, or BG Group v. Argentina, and even more so in Rurelec, did not state that ultimate
ownership was a mandatory condition that needed to be satisfied in order to benefit from a treaty
that protects indirect ownership. On the contrary, several tribunals have held that they had
jurisdiction over claimants that were the indirect owners of qualifying investments without at the

same time being the ultimate owners of those investments.*°

Further, as the party asserting this jurisdictional objection, the Respondent has the burden to
demonstrate that only ultimate indirect owners have protection, and the Respondent has yet to
articulate a cogent argument for why the Treaty, when protecting indirect ownership, would limit

itself to the protection of ultimate owners.**

The Claimant notes that the Respondent, in its Rejoinder, appears to have abandoned its claim on
the absence of protection for the ultimate owner under the Treaty. Instead, it raised a new
allegation that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because SAS has not “made” any investment in
Bolivia. The Claimant criticizes the Respondent's interpretation that the terms “investment of
the former” in Article 8(1) of the Treaty require the Claimant to have been actively involved in
the realization of the investment.*** Article 8(1) requires that the investment belongs to a claimant

directly or indirectly, but not an active participation in the realization of the investment.*”

Nor does the Treaty contain such a requirement, and the Caratube and Standard Chartered Bank

cases do not support the position of the Respondent because the underlying treaties in such cases

are not sufficiently similar to the BIT in this arbitration and the facts were also different.*** Indeed,
in this arbitration the issue of foreign control is not addressed as it was in the Caratube case,*”
nor does the Treaty contain language which provides that an investment has to be “made” in the
territory of the Contracting Party, such as in the Standard Chartered Bank case.“ The Claimant
further states that “[h]ere, there can be no dispute that South American Silver Ltd. ‘did something

or

as part of the investing process’, unlike Standard Chartered Bank, where the connection

between the claimant and the investment was highly attenuated.“

274. Finally, the Claimant rejects the existence of the so-called objective definition of ‘investment’?
and states that the Salini test is not recognized or accepted in the terms indicated by the
Respondent.“ The test was developed within the framework of ICSID arbitrations“ and it is not

even always adopted even in said arbitrations.*#°

Furthermore, out of the two cases that the
Respondent cites —as non-ICSID arbitration cases having relied upon the Salini test- one in fact
never even mentioned the test, whereas the second was criticized for doing so (Romak).” The
Claimant further states that the Romak case involved factual circumstances and policy

considerations that are not present here.““*

275. Insum, there is no reason for the Tribunal to apply the Salini test in this case. The Tribunal need
only ensure, in order to ascertain its jurisdiction, that SAS’ investments satisfy the definition of
‘investment’ at Article 1(a) of the Treaty.“ And even if the requirements of the Salini test were
applicable (which the Claimant repeats is not the case), then it is not possible to dispute that the

shares in CMMK and the Concessions, i.e. the investment at issue in this case, satisfy the test

criteria of resource contribution, risk, duration, and contribution to the economic development of

the host State (Bolivia, in this case).*°

(c) On whether SAS is an interested party in this dispute

The Claimant contends that accepting the Respondent’s argument to pierce the corporate veil
would add a further requirement for the jurisdiction of the Tribunal that is not provided for under
the Treaty.**' The Claimant argues that neither Article 8(1) nor the preamble of the Treaty requires

the Tribunal to consider the nationality of SAS’ ultimate owner to decide on its jurisdiction.4-?

The Claimant submits that tribunals have unanimously held that, when considering the nationality
of the claimant for purposes of jurisdiction, the corporate veil should not be pierced except in
exceptional circumstances such as fraud.** The Claimant notes that no such circumstances exist
or have been alleged in this case.*** Moreover, as to the awards relied upon by the Respondent,
the Claimant holds that they are irrelevant as they are based on a set of legal elements that are

absent in this arbitration.“

In connection with TSA Spectrum v. Argentina, the Claimant notes that the tribunal’s decision to
pierce the corporate veil was warranted by the express terms of the ICSID Convention, which is

irrelevant in this arbitration.*°

The Claimant posits that the Venoklim Holding v. Venezuela case —an arbitration initiated pursuant
to the Venezuelan Law on the Promotion and Protection of Investments- is also irrelevant**’. The
Claimant notes that the tribunal’s decision to pierce the corporate veil was based on the definition
of ‘investor’ under Venezuelan law, requiring effective control over the investment, which is not

at issue here.*°*

The Claimant submits that, in the Loewen case, the piercing of the veil was decided on the basis

of the continuous nationality rule because one of the claimants had changed nationality during the

arbitration.“ The Claimant argues that this case is not relevant for the purposes of the present
case because such rule has not been invoked and it is not applicable.“ The Claimant further

contends that the decision was criticized by leading commentators.**!

In conclusion, the Claimant submits that neither the Treaty nor investment treaty jurisprudence

justifies the piercing of the corporate veil in this case.*

3. The Tribunal’s Analysis
(a) The scope of Article 8(1) of the Treaty regarding indirect ownership

The Parties do not dispute that the interpretation of the Treaty in general, and of Article 8(1) of

the Treaty in particular, must be done by reference to Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention.

“63 one of the

It is also not in dispute that (a) the Claimant is a company incorporated in Bermuda,
territories to which the Treaty is extended in accordance with Article 11 thereof;4% (b) the
Claimant is the sole shareholder of Malku Khota Ltd., G.M. Campana Ltd. and Productora Ltd.,
companies incorporated in Bahamas; “* (c) Malku Khota Ltd., G.M. Campana Ltd. and
Productora Ltd., are CMMK’s sole shareholders;“® and (d) CMMK is a company incorporated in
Bolivia,“ and the owner of the Mining Concessions.“ It is thus a situation in which clearly the
Claimant holds all the shares of those entities, who are at the same time shareholders of the

company owning the Mining Concessions (CMMK).

The dispute, with regard to the jurisdictional objection being examined, focuses specifically on

determining whether the fact that the Claimant holds all the shares of CMMK’s sole shareholders

and yet it is not the direct shareholder of CMMK results, in light of Article 8(1) of the Treaty, in

the Tribunal lacking jurisdiction due to the Claimant not being the direct owner of the shares.
Article 8(1) of the Treaty, whose interpretation is contested by the Parties, provides:

(1) Disputes between a national or company of one Contracting Party and the other
Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the latter under this Agreement in
relation to an investment of the former which have not been legally and amicably
settled shall after a period of six months from written notification of a claim be
submitted to international arbitration if either party to the dispute so wishes.
(emphasis added)
According to the Respondent, for the reasons stated in the summary of its position, the consent to
arbitration in Article 8(1) of the Treaty was given for disputes between Bolivia and a UK investor
regarding Bolivia’s obligations towards a UK company regarding an investment “of” that
company. The expression “of”, according to the Respondent, implies that the investor must be
owner or direct holder of the investment. Since the Claimant does not have direct ownership of
CMMK’s shares, nor of the Mining Concessions, the Respondent argues that the Tribunal would

not have jurisdiction because the dispute does not relate to an investment “of” the Claimant.

The Tribunal’s task in this case is not to establish a general doctrine on the protection of so-called
“indirect investments”, nor to take a stand in general terms on the eventual rights of a company’s
shareholders for the acts of a State that may affect a company of which they are shareholders. The
jurisdictional exception raised by the Respondent refers specifically to the Treaty and the scope
of the Respondent’s consent in the Treaty. In this vein, the Tribunal will analyse the jurisdictional
exception as it was raised, in connection with the Treaty, and will interpret the Treaty in light of

Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention.
The above-mentioned rules of interpretation of the Vienna Convention provide:

Article 31. General Rule of Interpretation

1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning
to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and
purpose.

2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in
addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:

(a) Any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in
connection with the conclusion of the treaty;

(b) Any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the

conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related
to the treaty.

14

289.

290.

291.

PCA Case No. 2013-15
Award

3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:

(a) Any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the
treaty or the application of its provisions;

(b) Any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the
agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;

(c) Any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the
parties.

4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so
intended.

Article 32. Supplementary Means of Interpretation

Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the
preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to
confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the
meaning when the interpretation according to article 31 :

(a) Leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or

(b) Leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.
Two conclusions result from the rules of the Vienna Convention. First, the rule of interpretation
found in Article 31 is one integral rule that must be applied in its entirety and not by applying the
text, context, object and purpose as isolated or separate elements. Article 31 enshrines a “General
Rule of Interpretation” — not independent interpretation rules - by which the Treaty must be
interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of it in
their context and in the light of its object and purpose. Additionally, the Treaty’s context is also
composed of its preamble, its annexes, every agreement or practice between the Contracting
Parties regarding the Treaty or its interpretation, or application. The Tribunal shall also apply the

systemic interpretation principle, as per it was stated in paragraphs 212 et seq. of the award.

Second, the rule in Article 32 is supplementary and it only applies when it is needed to confirm
the meaning resulting from the application of Article 31 or to establish the meaning of a term that,
when applying the rule in Article 31, produces results that are ambiguous, obscure or lead to a

manifestly absurd or unreasonable result.

In other words, the Tribunal must make an effort to interpret the Treaty granting primacy to the
ordinary meaning of the text, taking into account its context, and its object and purpose. In order
to confirm the meaning resulting from this interpretative exercise, or insofar as that interpretation
leaves a degree of ambiguity or obscurity with regard to the meaning of any term, or leads to a

manifestly absurd or unreasonable result, the Tribunal may resort to the means of supplementary

75

interpretation provided in Article 32 of the Vienna Convention, i.e., the travaux préparatoires of

the Treaty or the circumstances of its conclusion.

It is true, as the Respondent points out, that in English and in Spanish, the preposition “of” denotes
ownership. The Dictionary of the Real Academia Espajiola and the Oxford Dictionaries cited by
the Respondent say so. In principle, this would be the ordinary meaning of the expression. But
even if the Tribunal would stop at the ordinary meaning of the word, on the basis of the
dictionaries cited by the Respondent, the term “ownership” does not only mean “property” and

much less, “direct property”.“?

The interpretation rule of Article 31 of the Vienna Convention does not allow one, as the Tribunal
indicated, to stop only at the ordinary meaning of the text. Rather it has to be analyzed by taking

into account the context, with all its elements, and the object and purpose of the Treaty.

Regarding the context, the Tribunal finds relevant the definition of investment provided in Article

1 of the Treaty, which states:

For the purposes of this Agreement;

(a) “investment” means every kind of asset which is capable of producing returns
and in particular, though not exclusively, includes:

(i) movable and immovable property and any other property rights such as
mortgages, liens or pledges;

(ii) shares in and stock and debentures of a company and any other form of
participation in a company;

(iii) claims to money or to any performance under contract having a financial value;

(iv) intellectual property rights and goodwill;

 

(v) any business concessions granted by the Contracting Parties in accordance with
their respective laws, including concessions to search for, cultivate, extract or exploit
natural resources.

A change in the form in which assets are invested does not affect their characters as
investments. Investments made before the date of entry into force as well as those
made after entry into force shall benefit from the provisions of this Agreement;

(b) “returns” means the amounts yielded by an investment and in particular, though
not exclusively, includes profit, interest, capital gains, dividends, royalties and fees;

“© Although the Dictionary of the Real Academia Espaftola includes “a thing that is property of someone particular” as the
meaning of the word ownership, it also includes, for example, “relation between a thing and who has a right to it”. On behalf
of Oxford Dictionaries, equally cited by Respondent, it does not limit the preposition ‘of” to a meaning of property.

295. It is not in dispute that company shares, on the one hand, and concessions for the exploration of
mineral resources, on the other, constitute investments under the Treaty.*”° The abovementioned
article contains a broad definition that starts with equating investments with an “asset which is
capable of producing returns” and a series of assets and rights are listed that constitute an
investment. The same provision points out that it is not a restrictive list. Although the examples
listed there serve as reference for what the States wanted to protect as an investment under the
Treaty, nothing in the text of the definition of investment made under the Treaty, nor in the
investments listed as examples, suggests that the “ownership” to which the preposition “of” in
Article 8(1) refers to, is limited to direct ownership. In the present case, the Parties do not contest
that both CMMK’s shares and the Mining Concessions are included under the definition of

investment provided under Article | of the Treaty.*”!

296. Further looking at context, from the revision of its provisions it is clear for the majority of the
Tribunal that there is no article in the Treaty that, in isolation or in the context of the others,
corroborates or suggests as plausible, an interpretation such as the one proposed by the
Respondent for Article 8(1) or that would lead to conclude that indirect property must be

excluded.

297. Regarding the object and purpose of the Treaty, its preamble, which is also part of the context in
accordance with Article 31(2) of the Vienna Convention, provides that the Contracting Parties are
animated by the “desir[e] to create favourable conditions for greater investment by nationals and
companies of one State in the territory of the other State” and “recognis|e] that the encouragement
and reciprocal protection under international agreement of such investments will be conducive to

the stimulation of individual business initiative and will increase prosperity in both States”.

298. For its part, Article 2(1) of the Treaty establishes that every Contracting Party of the Treaty “shall
encourage and create favourable conditions for nationals or companies of the other Contracting
Party to invest capital in its territory, and, subject to its right to exercise powers conferred by its
laws, shall admit such capital’. The majority of the Tribunal observes that the preamble uses

broad language in which the Contracting Parties undertake to create favourable conditions for the

 

70 Indeed, Respondent expressly recognized it, when asserting: “In this case, even though SAS fits the definition of investor
and both the shares in CMMK and the Mining Concessions fit the definition of investment, SAS is not the real owner of the
investment”. (Counter-Memorial, para. 224). See also Counter-Memorial, para. 240 (“When an objection refers to the definition
of “investment”, it criticizes the form of assets reputed as investment (v.g7, is the asset in question really a concession, action
or title?), which is not the case under our examination.”). (emphasis added)

investment, without appearing to restrict the manner in which an investment can be made when it

comes to companies.

In short, the majority of the Tribunal does not find that the interpretation of the Treaty under
Article 31 of the Vienna Convention can lead to a conclusion such as that proposed by Bolivia

regarding the scope of Article 8(1) of the Treaty.

As regards Article 32 of the Vienna Convention, the conclusion to which the majority of the
Tribunal has reached regarding Article 8(1) does not lead to a manifestly absurd or unreasonable
result, nor does it leave the text of the Treaty ambiguous or obscure. But even if it was necessary
to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of Article 31 of the Vienna Convention, or
if such were ambiguous or obscure, or manifestly absurd or unreasonable, iy
ee
=

Specifically regarding corporate structures, nothing in the text, context, object and purpose of the
Treaty, nor in any evidence from the time of the negotiation or conclusion of the Treaty suggests,

as the Respondent does, that the corporate structure by which a company acquires full control of

 

another company through one or more companies is a novel concept in corporate law that was not
taken into account at the time of the conclusion of the Treaty. But additionally, the Tribunal
observes that the structure under consideration is not particularly sophisticated or alien to the
corporate world as to be unforeseeable for the Contracting Parties of the Treaty at the time of its

conclusion, if they had wanted to restrict or prohibit it.

The Respondent asserts that contemporaneous treaties signed by Bolivia at the time when the
Treaty was concluded must be taken into account among the circumstances of the conclusion of
the Treaty that Article 32 of the Vienna Convention refers to. These treaties, according to the
Respondent, cover indirect property, demonstrating that when the Respondent wished to cover

indirect property, it did so expressly.

The majority of the Tribunal disagrees. First, because the circumstances that Article 32 of the
Vienna Convention refers to are the circumstances of the conclusion of the Treaty (“the
circumstances of its conclusion’) and the historical context in which the Treaty was concluded,
not other treaties which have not been proven to have been part of the circumstances of the
conclusion of the Treaty. Second, because the Respondent has not proven that the treaties signed
prior to or contemporaneously with the Treaty, or the provisions on property contained in said
treaties, were part of the circumstances of the conclusion of the Treaty, the discussions held by

Bolivia and the UK regarding the content of the Treaty, or part of what was considered or taken

78

PCA Case No. 2013-15
Award

into account by both Contracting Parties - not just by one of them — when negotiating and
concluding the Treaty. Third, because even if it were necessary to apply Article 32 of the Vienna
Convention in this case, in the absence of evidence that the treaties invoked by Bolivia form part
of the circumstances of the conclusion of the Treaty, the Tribunal could not restrict or extend the
text and context of the Treaty through the simple exercise of textual comparison of the Treaty
with other treaties concluded between third States and the Respondent. Finally, the Tribunal does
not find that it has been pleaded nor demonstrated by the Respondent why a contemporaneous
analysis of the circumstances of the conclusion of the Treaty can be done without taking into
account facts or documents that reflect which was the position of the other Contracting Party on

the treaty under analysis.

304. As regards the awards invoked by the Parties, the majority of the Tribunal finds two of them to
be particularly relevant. The first one, the jurisdictional decision in Cemex v. Venezuela, featured
atext almost identical to the one in the Treaty. In respect of the phrase “investment of”, the tribunal

concluded that:

157. The Tribunal further notes that, when the BIT mentions investments “of”
nationals of the other Contracting Party, it means that those investments must belong
to such nationals in order to be covered by the Treaty. But this does not imply that
they must be “directly” owned by those nationals. Similarly, when the BIT mentions
investments made “in” the territory of a Contracting Party, all it requires is that the
investment itself be situated in that territory. It does not imply that those investments
must be “directly” made in such territory.

158. Thus, as recognized by several arbitral tribunals in comparable cases, the
Claimants have jus standi in the present case. The Respondent’s objection to the
Tribunal jurisdiction under the BIT cannot be upheld.”

305. The second award, the Rurelec v. Bolivia award, is relevant because the tribunal, when interpreting

Article 8(1) of the Treaty, noted:

As regards the Respondent’s argument that indirect investments are not protected
under the UK-Bolivia BIT, the Tribunal notes that Article 1 contains—as the majority
of BITs do-a very broad definition of “investment”. Article I defines “investment”
as “every kind of asset which is capable of producing returns,” which would
naturally include “indirect investments” through the acquisition of shares in a
company. In addition, the non-exhaustive list of protected investments described in
the BIT explicitly includes the example of “shares in and stock and debentures of a
company and any other form of participation in a company”. Finally, in its broadest
example, Article 1(a)(iii) of the BIT provides that any “claims to money or to any
performance under contract having a financial value” are considered to be protected
investments under the BIT.

Decision on Jurisdiction, Dec. 30, 2010, paras. 157-158.

79

PCA Case No. 2013-15
Award

353. In the Tribunal’s opinion, all of the above mentioned examples contribute to the
conclusion that indirect investments were intended to be protected by the UK-Bolivia
BIT. Moreover, given that the purpose of the BIT is to promote and protect foreign
investment, the Tribunal considers that the BIT would require clear language in
order to exclude coverage of indirect investments-language that the BIT does not
contain.

354.According to the Tribunal, the fact, invoked by the Respondent, that other BITs
concluded by Bolivia explicitly include indirect investments, is insufficient to support
an a contrario sensu interpretation that only those BITs containing such an explicit
reference cover indirect investments, since it is well accepted that this kind of
argument is not on its own strong enough to justify a particular interpretation of a
rule of law. The mere absence of an explicit mention of the different categories of
investment (direct and indirect) cannot be interpreted as narrowing the definition of
investment under the BIT to only direct investment.

355. The Tribunal therefore agrees with the Claimants and concludes that terms
employed i in the UK-Bolivia BIT are broad enough on their own to include indirect

even without employing further i that would only reinforce
what is already clear from the text of the BIT.”

 

 

306. The majority of the Tribunal concurs with the reasons set forth in these passages, and, as pointed
out above, does not find that the term “of” in Article 8(1) of the Treaty implies direct property or

excludes indirect investments.

307. At this stage a distinction should be made between the SAS’ indirect shareholding in CMMK’s
share capital and its rights over the Mining Concessions. It has been proven in the record that
SAS is the 100% owner of the shares of each one of the three companies incorporated in Bahamas
which, at the same time, are owners of all CMMK’s shares, a company incorporated in Bolivia,
holder of the Mining Concessions, in accordance with Bolivian law.** As noted by the Tribunal,

both Parties agree that CMMK’:

 

shares and the Mining Concessions fall within the definition of

“investment” under the Treaty.*”>

308. Although its indirect shareholding does not give it a direct right over the Company’s assets
pursuant to Bolivian law, nothing in the Treaty prevents the Claimant from submitting claims
based on measures adopted against CMMK’s assets which affect the value of the shares indirectly
owned by the Claimant. Indeed, Article 5(2) of the Treaty considers this situation, when providing

that:

Where a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company which is
incorporated or constituted under the law in force in any part of its own territory,

and in which nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party own shares , it
shall ensure that the provisions of paragraph ( 1) of this Article are applied to the
extent necessary to guarantee prompt, adequate and effective compensation in
respect of their investment to such nationals or companies of the other Contracting
Party who are owners of those shares..
In the present case, SAS’ indirect shareholding of CMMK’s share capital — which is in turn the
owner of the Mining Concessions- is an investment protected under the Treaty. In that sense, SAS
can submit claims based on conducts or measures attributable to the State that affect CMMK’s
assets as it undermines the value of its shares in the Company. The Tribunal understands that the
Claimant’s claim falls under this hypothesis, as is apparent from the First FTI Report, SAS’
expert:
[...] the Claimant indirectly held 100.0% of the shares of CMMK. CMMK’s sole
corporate purpose was the development of the Project and thus the value of CMMK
depended entirely on the concessions it held for the Project. Thus, when CMMK’s
concessions were revoked, the value of the Claimant’s investments in Bolivia (its
shares in CMMK) were rendered worthless.*”°
For the above reasons, the majority of the Tribunal does not find any reason to accept the
jurisdictional objection put forward by the Respondent based on Article 8(1) of the Treaty and,

so, rejects the jurisdictional objection put forward by the Respondent based on said Article.

(b) On the protection of indirect investors by the Treaty

The majority of the Tribunal already determined the scope of Article 8(1) of the Treaty and
established that its text —particularly, the expression “investment of the former’— does not imply
that the investor must be the direct owner of the investment. Similarly, it noted that the question
is not whether indirect property or ownership is generally protected in international investment

law, but the specific scope of Article 8(1) in the Treaty for the purposes of this dispute.*””

The Tribunal must then decide whether, as claimed by the Respondent, notwithstanding that the
Treaty covers the investment of a company having indirect control over CMMK it is still
necessary to (i) determine who controls the company —SAS- that indirectly controls CMMK;
(ii) establish whether the resources for the Project come from the ultimate parent company—
SASC- or from the Claimant; and (iii) decide if the Salini test should be applied to determine

who made the investment.

PCA Case No. 2013-15
Award

The Respondent argues, in short, that if indirect investments are protected, then the Tribunal must
consider SASC as the investor — the Claimant’s parent company — and not the Claimant. Since
SASC is a Canadian company, it would not be protected under the Treaty and, consequently, the

Tribunal would lack jurisdiction.

The Respondent further asserts that it is SASC who has the direct, objective link with the
investment, as it was the one who provided the funds, who has the title over the Metallurgical
Process, who made the strategic decisions and who concluded the consulting contracts. It adds
that, if the Treaty and the Salini test are applied to SAS, the conclusion reached is that SAS does

not have an investment in Bolivia and, consequently, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction.

In order to decide these issues, the Tribunal must look at the Treaty, as the primary source of law,
which contains the consent of the Respondent to arbitration and establishes the protection that the

Claimant alleges it has a right to.

The Tribunal already determined at paragraphs 287 to 291 above, what are —according to the
Vienna Convention- the rules of interpretation that it must apply in order to unravel the proper

construction of the Treaty, in light of the different interpretations raised by the Parties.

 

There are two provisions of the Treaty which the Respondent invokes as the basis for its
jurisdictional objection. First, the repeatedly mentioned Article 8(1), according to the Respondent,
requires title or a direct link between the investor and the investment and, further that the claimant
have been actively involved in the realization of the investment in the host State.*”* Second, the
Treaty’s preamble, according to the Respondent, refers to the promotion of capital flows between
investors of the Contracting Parties to the Treaty, which would exclude the possibility of capital

flows coming from a company of a third State.

It is not disputed that the Treaty protects nationals or companies of the States parties. In respect
of the United Kingdom, the Treaty provides that “companies” means “corporations, firms and
associations incorporated or constituted under the law in force in any part of the United Kingdom
or in any territory to which this Agreement is extended in accordance with the provisions of Article
11.”*” The Parties do not dispute that the Claimant is a corporation in accordance with the above-
mentioned definition or that the Claimant is indirectly the sole shareholder of CMMK. The dispute
hinges on whether, for the purposes of the jurisdiction, given the existence of a parent company

controlling the Claimant, the Tribunal should take such company as an investor, and in particular,

Award

whether the origin of the totality of the funds or resources used in the investment must necessarily
and solely come from the investor — the Claimant in this case — such that if the controlling parent
company of the Claimant provides the funding or resources, it should be considered as the

investor.

In terms of Article 8(1), the majority of the Tribunal does not find in its text and context a
requirement of direct ownership or other direct relationship between the investment and the
investor. As the Tribunal has already noted, nothing in Article 8(1) prevents the investment from
belonging to an investor (being “of” an investor) despite the lack of direct control over the

investment by the investor except through intermediary companies also controlled by the investor.

The text and context of the Treaty, taking account its object and purpose, do not include any
provisions which state or imply that the Tribunal must determine who is the Claimant’s ultimate
parent company, or that the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is predicated on the determination of the
ultimate parent company of the party presenting the claim and that such ultimate parent company

be a corporation of one of the States parties to the Treaty.

The preamble to the Treaty, which helps to determine its object and purpose, notes that the States

parties have entered into the Treaty:

bh iti

Desiring to create for greater i by nationals and
companies of one State in the territory of the other State;

Recognising that the encouragement and reciprocal protection under international

agreement of such investments will be conducive to the stimulation of individual

business initiative and will increase prosperity in both States.
It is true, as the Respondent asserts, that the above-mentioned preamble notes that the States party
to the Treaty wish to create favorable conditions for “greater investment” by companies of the
other State. However, it cannot be concluded that whoever qualifies as an investor, because it is a
company of a State party to the Treaty, may not obtain resources from third parties or companies
of the group to which it belongs in order to make the investment. In fact, nothing in the Treaty
states that the Tribunal must examine the origin of the capital invested by an investor in order to

decide on its jurisdiction.”

States are free to negotiate treaties and include broad or restrictive language as deemed
appropriate; and it is not for the Tribunal to create requirements in addition to those which the

States, in exercise of their sovereign power, have included in the relevant Treaty. In the present

489 Along these lines, see CLA-115, Tokios Tokelés v. Ukraine, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Decision on Jurisdiction, April 29,

case, the States parties to the Treaty - Bolivia and the United Kingdom — freely decided to
establish the requirement that “companies” in order to be considered an “investor” of the United
Kingdom, must be incorporated or constituted “under the law in force in any part of the United
Kingdom or in any territory to which this Agreement is extended in accordance with the provisions
of Article 11.”**' The Treaty establishes only one requirement of a link between the investor — the
legal person — and the State party to the Treaty: that of incorporation or constitution under the law

in force in such State.

States, in the exercise of their sovereignty, may include in treaties additional requirements for the
investor or the investment, as is the case with clauses requiring that, in addition to incorporation
or constitution in the State party under the corresponding Treaty, the company have its principal
place of business in that State or that substantial business activities in that State, or that the capital
or the resources used in the investment have their origin in the State where the investor was
constituted or incorporated, or even denial of benefits clauses under certain circumstances. None
of these requirements or restrictions have been included in the Treaty by Bolivia or the United
Kingdom and, as already mentioned, the Tribunal may not create additional requirements for the

investor or the investment beyond the ones agreed by the two sovereign States.

It is true, as the Respondent suggests, that some tribunals have decided to determine the ultimate
controlling entity of the investment and some — the Tribunal notes — some of them have even
declined jurisdiction upon determining that the ultimate investor was not a national of one of the
States party to the respective treaty. However, those were cases in which the facts and treaties
were substantially different from the ones under consideration before this Tribunal — as stated in
paragraphs 326 et seq below — or where the tribunals declined jurisdiction due to abuse of process
or some sort of fraud in the structure used to access the treaty. Yet, none of the decisions cited by
the Respondent to support their argument are conclusive that under a treaty such as this one, the
Tribunal must always find that a party who is not the ultimate controlling entity in the chain is not
an investor, or that there is an implicit origin-of-capital requirement that calls for the non-
recognition of an investor who has not contributed all of the funds, equipment, or elements used
to make the investment. Furthermore, the Tribunal finds that no abuse of process has been
demonstrated nor that SAS has been used fraudulently to access the Treaty or, in sum, that the

Treaty has been used contrary to its text, context, object, or purpose.

In particular, el Tribunal does not find that the awards the Respondent cited in support of its thesis

make the protection of so-called indirect investments conditional on the claimant being the

Award

ultimate holder or controller of the investment. As the Tribunal has already noted, it is not
incumbent upon it to establish a general thesis on so-called indirect ownership, but rather to

interpret the Treaty in the present case for the corporate structure on the record.

In the Siemens v. Argentina case, despite the argument by the respondent State that the treaty
required a direct relationship between the investor and the investment and that the claimant was
not the direct owner of the investment, in the first place, it was a defense founded on a treaty with
a content different from the one under the consideration of this Tribunal. In second place, even
though the Siemens v. Argentina tribunal held that the treaty included indirect investments, it did

not suggest that it meant that only the ultimate owner of the company was protected.**?

The Kardassopoulos v. Georgia decision was based on the reasoning of the Siemens tribunal
regarding the claimant’s indirect share ownership, but there is no finding there either that the

claimant’s ius standi was based on being the ultimate owner of the investment.**?

Similarly, the tribunal in BG Group v. The Republic of Argentina based its analysis on a different
treaty to conclude that the claimant was an investor that had made investments that qualified as
such, but it never stated that the claimant was the ultimate owner of the investment, nor did it base

its decision on that circumstance.***

With respect to the decision in the Rurelec v. Bolivia arbitration interpreting the Treaty, the
paragraph cited by the Respondent, whereby the tribunal concludes that “the best interpretation
of Article 2(2) of the BIT, when it refers to ‘investments of nationals’, is the one that considers
that the investments may belong to nationals of one Contracting Party, both directly or indirectly
through equity ownership of the companies that own the ultimate investment in Bolivia, in this
case EGSA,”**> does not state or require that the investor be the ultimate owner of the investment.
The reference to “companies that own the ultimate investments in Bolivia” means the controlled

company that holds the investment - EGSA — rather than the ultimate holding company.

Finally, in connection with the award in the Standard Chartered Bank v. Tanzania case, the
majority of the Tribunal finds that despite the Tribunal’s finding that the preposition “of” in the

phrase “investment [of the claimant]” required “some activity of investing”, the tribunal in that

case based its analysis on the bilateral investment treaty between the United Kingdom and
Tanzania, whose definition of “investment” is different from the definition in the Treaty. **°
Furthermore, in the above-mentioned decision, it was particularly relevant that the company that
commenced the arbitration did not control the subsidiary that had made the investment**” — a loan
to a Tanzanian company — a fundamentally different situation from the one discussed in this
arbitration where the investment comprises shares in a Bolivian company - CMMK - and the
Claimant holds 100% of the shares in the intermediary companies which, in turn, hold 100% of

CMMK’s shares.

332. In conclusion, the investor for all purposes is SAS, who fulfills the incorporation requirement
under the Treaty, and it is with respect to SAS that the existence or not of the investment should
be predicated for the purposes of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. SAS owns the shares of CMMK —
holder of the Mining Concessions — through three companies in which SAS holds the totality of
the shares. As stated at paragraph 309 of this award, the Claimant’s indirect participation in

CMMK’s equity constitutes an investment protected under the Treaty.

333. The Respondent does not question SAS’ ownership of the shares in the companies that are
CMMK’s shareholders or the origin of the funds for the acquisition of such shares that — it is
reiterated — constitute an investment protected under the Treaty. Its objection focuses on the origin
of certain resources and technologies CMMK uses for the Mining Concessions. The Tribunal does
not consider the origin of such resources and technologies to be relevant for its jurisdiction. On
the one hand, as it has previously been said, the Treaty does not include an origin requirement for
the resources used in the investment. On the other hand, to accept the Respondent’s argument
would lead one to conclude that the resources used by the company constituted in the territory of
acontracting party for the development of its activities should be derived directly and exclusively

from its shareholders for them to be protected under the relevant treaty.

 

“86 Article 1(a) of the Bilateral Investment Treaty between the United Kingdom and Tanzania states: ‘investment’ means every
kind of asset admitted in accordance with the legislation and in force in the territory of the Contracting Party in
which the investment is made and, in particular, though not exclusively, includes: (i) moveable and immovable property and
any other property rights such as mortgages, liens or pledges; (ii) shares in and stock and debentures of a company and any
other form of participation in a company; (iii) claims to money or any performance under contract having a financial value.”
(Emphasis added), To support the assertion that the treaty in the case required certain investment activity, the Standard
Chartered v. Tanzania tribunal made special emphasis on the term “made” included in the “investment” definition transcribed
above, as well as on other provisions of the corresponding treaty. (See RLA-60, Standard Chartered Bank v. United Republic
of Tanzania, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/12, Award, November 2, 2012, paras. 222, 225, 257)

2012, paras. 230-232, 261-265, 270. For example, at paragraph 232, the Standard Chartered v. Tanzania tribunal noted: “Rather,
for an investment to be ‘of an investor in the present context, some activity of investing is needed, which implicates the
claimant’s control over the investment or an action of transferring something of value (money, know-how, contacts, or
expertise) from one treaty-country to the other.” (Emphasis added).

Based on the same argument, an investment tribunal would have to decline its jurisdiction if it
finds that, notwithstanding being the direct or indirect holding of all of the shares recognized as
investments under the corresponding treaty, the shareholder or the domestic company used
technologies from other related companies or obtained their assistance for the execution of
contracts or received contributions from third parties interested in participating without becoming
company shareholders. Bolivia is asking the Tribunal to disregard the protected investment
—SAS’ indirect ownership of CMMK’s shares and CMMK’s ownership of the Mining
Concessions — by analyzing who contributed the resources to the Project, an economic test that is

not provided for anywhere in the Treaty.

As such, based on the Treaty and the application of the so-called subjective test, SAS has an
investment in Bolivia. SAS owns all of the shares in CMMK - the owner of the Mining
Concessions — and thus has an investment if the definition of “investments” contained in the

Treaty is applied taking account of its context, object and purpose.

In its Rejoinder, the Respondent invoked the so-called objective test based on the Salini test to
support its position that “for an asset to constitute an investment of a company, that company must
have an objective link to that asset: it must have been actively involved in the realization of the

investment in the host State.”***

The invocation of the Salini test in the Respondent’s Rejoinder does not seem intended to
disregard the existence of an investment — since the Respondent accepts that both the shares in
CMMkK as well as the Mining Concessions fit the definition of “investment” under the Treaty“? —

but to apply such a test to determine the ownership of the investment.

In fact, CMMK’s shares and the Mining Concessions constitute an investment under the Treaty

and the Parties do not seem to deny that, by applying the Salini test, there exists an investment

 

with the requi ioned by the Respondent in its Rejoinder. However, the Respondent
would like to go beyond this and, in a brief aside in its Rejoinder, seeks to have the Tribunal
determine the ownership of the investment based on the Salini test, by establishing that even when
an investment fulfills all of the Salini test requirements, only the entity making the contribution
directly and undertaking the risk directly and exclusively can be considered an investor under the

Treaty.

PCA Case No. 2013-15
Award

The Parties are in dispute - and the Tribunal is cognizant of the controversy in international
investment law — over the application of the so-called objective test to determine the existence of
an investment. Such a controversy exists not only in connection with the applicability of the test
in general, but even if one were to accept its application as a general rule, there is a disagreement
on whether it applies to non-ICSID arbitrations which are not governed by the Washington
Convention of 1965. However, the disputed issue concerns the existence or not of an investment,
which is not challenged in this case. In the present case, the Tribunal is asked to create a Salini
test to determine an investor’s qualification as such, even if the investment qualifies as such and

the Claimant meets the definition of investor under the Treaty.

The Tribunal has already indicated that the Treaty determines an investor’s status and that the
Claimant is an investor under the Treaty. Similarly, it has found — and the Parties do not dispute —
that the shares in CMMK and the Mining Concessions are investments under the Treaty. The
Tribunal is not convinced that it should develop an additional test to add requirements for the

determination as investors that are not provided for in the Treaty.

In conclusion, and based on the reasons given, the Tribunal, by a majority vote, will dismiss this

jurisdictional objection.

(c) On whether SAS is an interested party in this dispute

The Tribunal reiterates that the Treaty only contains a requirement related to the laws on a
company’s constitution to consider such a company as an investor. Nothing in the Treaty requires
that a company incorporated under the laws of the United Kingdom, or of any other territory to
which this Treaty is extended pursuant to article 11, must operate in the place it was incorporated
or have substantial businesses in the United Kingdom or in such territory in order to qualify as an
investor. The Treaty does not even require the investor to have its seat or principal place of

business in the United Kingdom.

It is true, as the Respondent notes, that Bolivia extended its consent to disputes between a
company of a Contracting State and the other Contracting State. But it is no less true that the
Treaty itself established that, for a company to belong to a Contracting State, it suffices that it was
constituted or incorporated under the laws of the corresponding contracting State. SAS fulfills

this requirement.

The Tribunal has already established that SAS is an investor under the Treaty, such that it cannot

be said that protection is being given to an unprotected company.

PCA Case No. 2013-15
Award

As to the cases the Respondent cites in support of its allegation, the Tribunal agrees with the
Claimant that the treaties, the facts, and the issues in dispute in the TSA Spectrum v. Argentina
and Loewen v. USA cases make those cases inapposite to the situation under consideration in the
present arbitration. As to the Venoklim v. Venezuela case, it was an arbitration commenced under
the Venezuelan Law on the Promotion and Protection of Investments where the dispute was over
the definition of “investor” and, in particular, the requirement of effective control over the

investment, which is not provided for under the Treaty.

Therefore, the Tribunal, by a majority vote, rejects the jurisdictional objection presented by the

Respondent.

THE CLAIMS AS A WHOLE ARE INADMISSIBLE SINCE SAS DID NOT HAVE CLEAN HANDS AND
DID NOT SATISFY THE LEGALITY OF THE INVESTMENT REQUIREMENT

 

The Parties dispute the relevance of the alleged actions by the Claimant to the enjoyment of
protection under the Treaty. The Parties present conflicting positions on the existence and
application of the clean hands doctrine (a), on the legality requirement (b), and on the alleged

lack of clean hands by the Claimant (c).

1. The Respondent’s Po:

 

(a) On the existence and application of the clean hands doctrine

The Respondent argues that the clean hands doctrine is part of the applicable law and requires
that the party seeking protection of its rights has not acted illegally or illegitimately.”° The
Respondent contends that this doctrine derives from the fundamental principles of equity and

justice, and is a corollary to the maxim “nemo auditor propiam turpitudinem allegans”.**'

Relying upon the Al-Warrag v. Indonesia, Fraport v. Philippines II, and Hamester v. Ghana
tribunals, the Respondent contends that having clean hands as a condition to access justice is a
general principle of international law. *°? Moreover, the Respondent posits that investment
tribunals have been consistent in rejecting claims brought by parties that have acted unfairly and
493

illegally’ and states that acts of bad faith, corruption, fraud, or deceitfulness lead to the

499 Counter-Memorial, section 5.2.1.1.

inadmissibility of the claims brought by an investor. *°* The Respondent argues that these

decisions should be considered as an application of the clean hands doctrine.“

350. Furthermore, to support the assertion that the clean hands doctrine constitutes a general principle
of international law that must be applied by the Tribunal,*®* the Respondent invokes individual
and dissenting opinions of judges of the Permanent Court of International Justice (the “PCIJ”)
and the ICJ,*” as well as other tribunals and international courts, including the Iran-United States

Claims Tribunal, and the PCA.*** Finally, the Respondent alleges that renowned scholars have

confirmed the requirement to appear before a tribunal with clean hands.*”

351. In its Rejoinder, the Respondent reiterates that the clean hands doctrine is recognized under
international law and is part of international public order. Further, it states that the clean hands
doctrine is an expression of the good faith principle, is included in various legal maxims (“he who
comes to equity for relief must come with clean hands”) and principles (ex juria jus non oritur,

nemo auditur propriam turpitudinem allegans, ex turpi causa non oritur actio, ex dolo malo non

oritur actio), and operates as an impediment to the admissibility of claims in cases where the

claimant has acted inappropriately in relation to the subject matter of its claim.*°°

352. Similarly, the Respondent alleges that the doctrine has been recognized as such, or in some of the
principles mentioned above, as an accepted principle of international law.*°! Contrary to the
Claimant’s suggestion, Bolivia explains that the analysis and application of the clean hands

doctrine was relevant in the decision of the Al-Warrag v. Indonesia and Fraport v. Philippines II

principle in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France.* The Respondent

doctrine.*!° Moreover, Bolivia notes that at least one of the cases cited by Claimant — Niko
Resource v. Bangladesh — admits that the clean hands doctrine is a general principle recognized

by civilized nations.*!!

As regards the characterization the Claimant makes of Professors Dugard and Crawford’s position
as Special Rapporteurs to the ILC on diplomatic protection and State responsibility, respectively,
the Respondent explains that Prof. Dugard’s report does not analyze the existence of the clean
hands doctrine, but rather whether it is appropriate to codify the principle as part of the law of
diplomatic protection, *!? whereas Prof. Crawford refers to the principle in a chapter “not

concerned with such procedural questions as locus standi, or with the admissibility of claims” 5"

The Respondent also criticizes the characterization that the Claimant makes of the Yukos case,
asserting among other things that the tribunal’s conclusion on the status of the clean hands
doctrine under international law is irrelevant because the tribunal did not take into consideration

the practice of the States and only considered the practices of international courts and tribunals.*"*

Regarding the criteria for the application of the clean hands doctrine, the Respondent contends
that the only relevant criteria — which is satisfied in the present case — is the causal link between
SAS’ abuses and the inadmissibility of its claims.*!* In any event, the Respondent argues that the
alleged reciprocity criterion invoked by the Claimant is also fulfilled. This criterion would require
the existence of a reciprocal relationship between the underlying facts of the claim and the facts
invoked by the Respondent as “unclean hands”.*'° The Respondent states that the reciprocity of
the obligations between the Parties is enshrined in the Treaty and it is implicit in investment treaty
law.*"” Thus, while Bolivia was obliged to protect the investment made in its territory by a national
of the United Kingdom, the Claimant, as alleged investor, was obliged to invest in accordance

with Bolivia’s laws.*!’ The Respondent argues that the Claimant, through CMMK, failed to

fact its conduct that led to the Reversion.*!”

Finally, the Respondent argues that the other criteria identified by the Claimant, allegedly
resulting from the Guyana and Niko Resources cases, do not correspond to the criteria underlying

the clean hands doctrine and would be incoherent and inconsistent.°”°

(b) On the legality requirement

The Respondent argues that, in addition to the clean hands doctrine, in order to be protected under
international law, the investment needs to be established in accordance with domestic and
international law.*2! The Respondent alleges that, under this principle, if the investment was not
made pursuant to the law, the tribunal must decline jurisdiction to hear any claim or, at least, deem

it inadmissible.** The Respondent notes that the tribunals’ jurisdiction is restricted to the consent
of the State, and they do not agree to the arbitration of claims resulting from investments made in

a manner contrary to the law, so that no tribunal has jurisdiction to decide over these cases.°”?

The Respondent holds that, even if this legality requirement was not expressly provided for under
a treaty, the obligation to comply with the law of the host State and international law is implicit
and its violation shall be punished.*** The Respondent submits three reasons: (i) this is the only

interpretation consistent with the fundamental purpose of respect for the rule of law;*°

(ii) it is
incoherent to assume that a State would accept protection of an investment made in violation of
the law;°”° (iii) “the purpose of the investment arbitration system is to protect solely legal and
bona fide investments” 577

The Respondent argues that the Claimant does not deny the existence of this legality requirement
or its applicability to this case, and acknowledges that it “is implicit in the system of investment

treaty arbitration.”°**

364. The Respondent argues that the Claimant’s defense in this issue is unfounded for two reasons.
First, the Respondent argues that, contrary to SAS’ defense, the legality requirement is not limited
to the laws governing the admission or the establishment of an investment in Bolivia.*”? The
Respondent notes that the decision in Saba Fakes cannot support the Claimant’s positions as that
tribunal’s assertion on what laws constitute the legality requirement was mere obiter dictum and
the decision about lack of jurisdiction was limited to verifying that the claimant had no

investment, making it unnecessary to analyze its legality or illegality.*”

365. The Respondent further states that to accept, as the Claimant proposes, to exclude consideration
of all laws that do not concern the admission of foreign investment would be contrary to the spirit
of international investment law.**! The Respondent invokes several investment arbitration cases
to support its argument that the main purpose of the investment treaty system is limited to the
protection of legal investments. ** The Respondent submits that the exclusion of illegal
investments can only be effective if the legal and regulatory framework of the host State is
considered as a whole in order to determine the legality of such investments.*? The Respondent
argues that SAS violated, through CMMK, fundamental principles of Bolivian law, as well as
international law, which according to the Respondent “has the direct consequence of having

claims fall outside the jurisdiction of the Tribunal under the Treaty” >*4

366. Second, the Respondent alleges that the assessment of the legality of an investment must be made
in respect of the entire duration of the investment and the consequence in this case is that SAS’
claims are left outside the Tribunal’s scope of jurisdiction.** At any rate, the Respondent submits
that CMMK’s conduct occurred during the making of the alleged investment, as CMMK was still

in the process of making the investment at the time of the enactment of the Reversion Decree.***

367. The Respondent notes that the Claimant’s argument that it could act illegally after having made
the investment cannot be accepted given that the purpose of the investment treaty system is not
the promotion of illegal investments.**” The Respondent submits that the decisions cited by the

Claimant are irrelevant and do not support the position that if the unlawful conduct occurs after

538

the investment is made, it has no impact on jurisdiction;** they are merely obiter dictum>® or

they refer to cases with legality clauses expressly limiting their analysis to the time the investment

was made.*“°

368. In light of the above, the Respondent reaffirms the duty of the Tribunal to decline jurisdiction to
hear the Claimant’s claims as they are tainted with unlawful acts pursuant to Bolivian and

international law or, alternatively, declare them inadmissible.**!

369. The Respondent contends that the Claimant caused a situation that led to the reversion of

concessions.*” According to the Respondent, the Claimant undermined the human, social, and

collective rights of a community that requires special protection under international law.*? The
Respondent asserts that the Tribunal must construe the Treaty pursuant to the Vienna Convention
which, in the opinion of the Respondent, requires the application of all sources of law
guaranteeing the protection of the Indigenous Communities.** The Respondent argues that, by

doing so, the Tribunal will find that the Claimant does not have clean hands and, consequently,

its claims are inadmissible.*“*

from the Indigenous Communities. The Respondent submits that “CMMK employees disrespected
women from the Indigenous Communities, violating their right to personal, physical,
psychological, and moral integrity and acting against the prohibition of any form of ‘physical,
sexual, psychological violence [against women] [...] that includes rape, abuse and sexual
violence’ .”*“° These actions would have consisted of constant verbal harassment, discrimination
based on their indigenous identity, and abuse (including against minors), with some of these

abuses resulting in pregnancies.*“”

Second, the Respondent attributes to the Claimant the infringement of the right to self-
determination and, in particular, self-government, of the Indigenous Communities in order to
impose its vision of development. ** The Respondent notes that this fundamental right is
internationally recognized, in the national laws of Bolivia, its Constitution, and it is applicable to

the mining activity by express provisions in the Mining Law.*”

The Respondent asserts that the Indigenous Communities have established legitimate authorities
and specific mechanisms for decision-making and that, in this specific case, the decision to
perform large scale open-pit mining had to be reached unanimously by an assembly.*° The
Respondent argues that given the impossibility to reach the necessary consensus, the Claimant
attempted to fabricate it “by using several stratagems which included the use of force,
intimidation, unauthorized entry into the territory of the Indigenous Communities, failure to
recognize the legitimate authorities and, in full disregard for the right to self-government, the

creation of illegitimate authorities” >>!

The Respondent argues that the Claimant implemented a strategy to gain followers in the most
remote communities, which were the least affected by the Project, and to silence the opposition
in the Malku Khota and Kalachaca communities.**? Similarly, the Respondent asserts that the
Claimant imposed its own decision-making process based on majorities, and legitimized a “new
authority”, COTOA-6A, which, as confirmed during the examination of Mr. Mallory, was created

with the sole purpose of allowing CMMK to develop its Project and had no other will than the

Company’s own will, and that also supported it actively.*?

The Respondent asserts that “this
system caused a profound division within the Indigenous Communities, which rely on their unity

to survive, and the overruled minority had to resort to extreme means to have its voice heard.”***

The Respondent contends that, in order to silence the leaders who defended the interest of
minorities, CMMK carried out an intimidation strategy, including baseless criminal claims against

community leaders, °°

and violence, withholding, and threats against community member
Benedicto Gabriel Veizaga, and his family members, who was also forced to sign an agreement
approving of the activities performed by the Company and warned not to attend another

community or cooperative meeting in Malku Khota.**°

The Respondent further argues that, in an attempt to influence and undermine decisions made by
the Indigenous Communities, CMMK employees, dressed with the communities’ typical clothing,
infiltrated an important ceremony of the Indigenous Communities, the Tantachawi (Council or
Assembly), where the assistance of outsiders is specifically forbidden.**” According to the
Respondent, “with such act the ayllu’s fundamental value not to lie (ama \lulla) was violated
because the infiltrator lied to an entire collectivity, in this case, the ayllus and communities from
Mallku Khota”.*** Yn addition to the above-mentioned, CMMK began to take de facto control of
houses and the territory of the community members, also preventing them from moving freely for

cattle-grazing purposes.*°

Finally, the Respondent alleges that the Project threatened the fundamental right of the Indigenous

Communities to preserve and protect the environment in their territories

and to “strengthen
their own relationship with their land [...] and other resources which they have traditionally
possessed and occupied {...)”.*°' The Respondent contends that the Project implied a serious
environmental risk, which could even lead to the destruction of the sacred mountain and

involving “an inexorable forced displacement of the community outside their ancestral

territories” °°

The Respondent argues that the risk to the environment and the risk of dispossession of their lands
was a matter of special concern for the Indigenous Communities, which led to significant social
tension.* According to the Respondent, the Indigenous Communities have the right to decide
their means of development insofar as said development affects their territories and, in this case,
the Indigenous Communities decided that the Project development ran counter to their own

development. This decision was reflected in the reversion of the Mining Concessions.**

In its Rejoinder Memorial on Jurisdiction, the Respondent rejects the Claimant’s position
regarding the fulfillment of the burden of proof. First, the Respondent argues that under Article
27(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the burden of proof was met in its Counter-Memorial by stating
the facts supporting its objections based on the clean hands doctrine and the illegality of the
investment. Therefore, the Claimant would have had to submit evidence in its Reply Memorial

on the admissibility of its claims and the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over them.*°

The Respondent further argues that the applicable standard of proof is the preponderance of
evidence or the balance of probabilities*”’ and that the Claimant’s arguments to contend that the
applicable standard is “clear and convincing evidence” on this point are wrong and unsupported

by the doctrine. **

Regarding the three decisions the Claimant cites to support its position, the
Respondent submits that in Rompetrol and Libananco no clear and convincing evidence was
required. Instead, the standard of balance of probabilities was applied and, in Siag v. Egypt, the

standard of proof was not a controversial issue.*°?

Second, the Respondent asserts that, notwithstanding the burden of proof and its assessment, there
is sufficient evidence to dismiss SAS’ claims since they are not within the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction.*” In this connection, the Respondent contends to have proven that CMMK engaged
in some conduct, including the creation of illegitimate organizations, physical abuse against the

Malku Khota community members, the presentation of baseless criminal claims against the

Indigenous Authorities and the payment of bribes to police officers and journalists, which are
contrary to Bolivian and international law and led to division and violence within the Indigenous

Communities.*”'

In its Post-Hearing Brief, Bolivia argued that “CMMK committed several abuses that led to an
unsustainable escalation of violence that endangered the life and rights of the Local Communities
and the public officials and forced the State, after having supported the continuity of the Project,

2 572

to decree Reversion as an ultima ratio The Respondent notes that these abuses warrant the

rejection of SAS’ claims.*”

First, the Respondent argues that CMMK’s negligence in the management of community relations
resulted in the opposition of the communities to the Project, as reflected in the authoritative votes
of December 2010 and January 2011.5" Contrary to the Claimant’s argument, Bolivia notes that
there is no evidence that the voting took place amidst intimidation or coercion. Further, Mr.
Gonzales Yutronic did not report to the authorities the violent acts he supposedly witnessed nor

did Mr. Angulo mention this in any of his reports on these meetings.*”°

The Respondent contends that the Hearing confirmed, at least, four forms of negligence by
CMMK in the management of the community relations: (i) its person in charge of community
relations, Mr. Angulo, was not aware of BSR’s recommendations (the only report on community
relations commissioned by SAS, SASC, or CMMK) and, therefore, acted contrary to the
recommendations made by BSR;>” (ii) the hiring of Ms. Carmen Huanca into the community
relations team caused major problems that led to her dismissal;*” (iii) the failure to communicate
the true Project implications, and information on the impact of exploration activities, despite the
recommendations made by BSR and its identification of these shortcomings in the Company
program;>’* and (iv) SAS dismissal of women’s rape accusations while CMMK management was

involved in covering up these events.*”?

other option than to decree the Reversion.**”

The Respondent emphasizes that “the illegalities committed by CMMK were implemented by
recommendation of Witness X under the supervision and approval of Messrs. Mallory and
Gonzales Yutronic”;**' and they were concealed in CMMK’s accounting books. * Bolivia
underscores that, during the Hearing, the Claimant did not cross-examine Witness X on facts such
as the strategy to criminalize the leaders of the Indigenous Communities that opposed to the
Project, the induced kidnapping of Saul Reque, undue payments to police officers, the arrest of
Cancio Rojas, and the alleged “historic town hall (cabildo histérico)”.** As to the credibility of
Witness X, the Respondent draws attention to the fact that Witness X was not CMMK’s
1,584

counsel,*** nor was there a contractual relationship with the State.**°

Bolivia reiterated that the alleged “historic town hall” had been orchestrated by CMMK and
Witness X to approve the popular consultation required under the law,** a fact that is “particularly
serious” for the following reasons: (i) despite the fact that Mr. Gonzales Yutronic admitted that
“it is not correct for one to prepare beforehand” the minutes of a meeting, this did not prevent
Satil Reque from drafting a text for this town hall as ordered by Witness X;°*’ (ii) although Mr.
Mallory acknowledged that if no consensus is reached for a meeting, it should not take place, the
town hall took place even though Malku Khota and Kalachaca were not in attendance (they were
marching to La Paz); (iii) Mr. Mallory admitted that CMMK intended to replace the early

consultation process with the authoritative vote at the town hall.**

Finally, the Respondent claims that the participation of two CMMK employees in a town hall
meeting in the area of Malku Khota, on May 28, 2012, triggered grave acts of violence in the area

that killed community member José Mamani.**°

The Respondent argues that, despite its support for the Project, the violent situation created by
CMMK left the State with no other alternative than to decree reversion.” In this context, the
Respondent argues that SAS’ witnesses confirmed that Bolivia expressed its support for the

Project, even in 2012,*°' and that it supported CMMK by sending police officers to the area to

On the other hand, the Respondent submits that during the Hearing the following claims against
SAS were refuted: (i) that the Government of Potosf had demanded the creation of a mixed
company, given that as Mr. Mallory confirmed at the Hearing, it was only suggested by the
Governor;*” (ii) that illegal mining was as important as SAS alleges, since it really involved
“some community members ‘grinding rocks’ ;”*** and (iii) that Bolivia would have an economic
interest in the Project which led it to enact the Reversion Decree.*” In connection with this last
point, the Respondent emphasizes that the Immobilization Zone was an area assigned to the
COMIBOL since 2007, over which CMMK had no rights, that there was no cooperation
agreement with Chinese investors in order for them to take control of the Project (which is
evidenced by the fact that four years after the Reversion there is no economic exploitation of the

investment law and thus lead to different solutions”. In this connection, the Respondent finds

that the abuses carried out by SAS and CMMK should lead the Tribunal to conclude that:

1. The alleged investment by SAS is illegal and, accordingly, the Tribunal has
no jurisdiction to resolve this dispute;

2. SAS’ claims are, in any case, inadmissible, because of the lack of ‘clean
hands’ ;

3. If, par impossible, the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction and SAS’ claims
are admissible, there is no causality between the actions of the State
(according to domestic and international law) and the alleged damages to
SAS (for being exclusively a consequence of its own acts); or

4. At most, the Tribunal shall reduce any sanction in this case by, at least, 75%
to reflect SAS’ contribution to its own damages.°”

the ICJ cases cited by SAS to support this conclusion and adds that Bolivia’s discussion is

inherently contradictory.”

Regarding the Guyana v. Suriname award, Claimant submits that the Respondent misinterprets
this decision that, according to SAS, “actually expressed doubt as to whether the doctrine actually

exists” 6%

The Claimant argues that the Respondents attempt to invoke the clean hands doctrine and related

 

principles as found in early claims commission cases fails to consider the proper context of those
cases. Claimant submits that those claims concerned violations of laws on slavery and neutrality
within the context of diplomatic protection.” Claimant cites Professor Crawford, who explains
that these cases are all characterized by the fact that the breach of international law by the victim
was the sole cause of the damage claimed, and that, on the contrary, when the State has violated
international law in taking repressive action against the applicant, arbitrators have never declared

the claim inadmissible.°!°

The Claimant further states that, in his report as Special Rapporteur on State Responsibility to the
ILC, Professor Crawford concluded that it was not possible to consider the clean hands theory as
an tenet of general customary law. Similarly, Claimant underscores that Professor Dugard, Special
Rapporteur on Diplomatic Protection, saw no reason to include a provision in the draft articles
dealing with the clean hands doctrine, based on the consideration that the evidence favoring the

doctrine was inconclusive.°!!

Regarding the Respondent’s dismissal of these reports, the Claimant notes that Professor
Dugard’s report examined the roots and application of the clean hands doctrine in international
law to analyze whether there was international consensus as to its applicability within diplomatic

protection.°? In regard to with the Respondent’s criticism of Professor Crawford’s report, the

Claimant submits that his conclusions are no less true or relevant simply because the particular

chapter under which the analysis is included does not deal with “procedural questions”.°!

The Claimant criticizes Bolivia for failing to take into account the final awards in the Yukos case
that, as the Claimant holds, are the most considered expression of the status of the clean hands
doctrine. Indeed, the Claimant continues, the Yukos tribunal analyzed many of the cases invoked
by the Respondent and concluded that unclean hands does not exist as a general principle of

international law which would bar a claim by an investor.°"*

The Claimant submits that the only truly new legal authority is the Al-Warragq v. Indonesia case,
which alone cannot “create from whole cloth an opposable clean hands doctrine in international
law”.°'5 The Claimant asserts that, as distinct from the present case, in Al-Warragq the basis for
the invocation of the doctrine was related to fraud and corruption in relation to the claims
themselves, which were proven and led to convictions in domestic courts;*!® further, the claimant
in that case did not contest the existence of the doctrine, stating only that it was irrelevant.°'7 At
any rate, the Respondent submits that the statement about this doctrine is very cursory and does
not identify it as a principle of international law.°!* Further, the Respondent submits that the
application of the clean hands doctrine in Al-Warrag was not unanimous and that the caveat is
important because there, like here, Bolivia’s claims of illegality do not relate to the acquisition of
the investment.” Finally, the Claimant warns that there is no evidence that Professor Crawford
did submit any expert report in support of the clean hands doctrine in that award, and any
suggestion that Professor Crawford as Special Rapporteur on State Responsibility supported the

existence of such doctrine is “highly misleading” .°°

In its Rejoinder Memorial on Jurisdiction, the Claimant further argues that Bolivia’s assertion that
the doctrine of clean hands is a general principle of law that should be applied in all cases rests

on scholarly commentary advocating for it to be so, i.e., lege ferenda. *' Indeed, the very articles

The Claimant further criticizes Bolivia’s attempt to equate clean hands with the general principle
of good faith or other Latin maxims, by means of “broad and unspecified” reference” .© The
Claimant asserts that should Bolivia insist that this Tribunal utilize good faith for regulating its
jurisdiction, it would have to identify the source in international law for doing so, the rules and
the conditions for the implementation of this principle, as well as its limits.°* The Claimant
contends that the Tribunal will not find support in international law for this task, including by

625

reference to a non-opposable unclean hands doctrine.

Similarly, the Clamant reproaches the Respondent’s attempt at establishing that recognition and
consensus exist between States as to the clean hands doctrine’s existence by referring in a
piecemeal and contextualized fashion to German, French, British, and U.S. law.” The Claimant
does not dispute that iterations of the clean hands doctrine exist in certain national jurisdictions,
but submits that these rules, grounded as they are in equity, are not automatic, binary rules
requiring courts to declare inadmissibility without ascertaining relative fault and

proportionality.”

Contrary to the Respondent’s arguments in its Rejoinder, the Claimant contends that the clean
hands doctrine is not part of international public policy, and neither Fraport nor World Duty Free
support such an assertion.**§ Further, the Claimant states that the Respondent does not and cannot
point to a “universal” or “standard” definition of the clean hands doctrine; nor to international
agreements or conventions between States agreeing to the clean hands doctrine; nor to any United

Nations declaration on the scope, content or implementation of the clean hands doctrine.°””

allegations, but at any rate underscores that the Respondent did not investigate SAS’ alleged

actions.*!

For all these reasons, the Claimant submits that the jurisdictional objection against clean hands
should be dismissed, since there is clearly no opposable doctrine of clean hands in international
law, whether as customary law (Article 38(1)(b) of the ICJ Statute) or as a general principle of
law (Article 38(1)(c)).° Similarly, the Claimant contends that the dismissal of all its claims on
the grounds of alleged unclean hands would have an unfair and inequitable outcome as it would

prevent Bolivia’s wrongs from being examined and remedied.“

At any rate, the Claimant argues that even if the Tribunal were to find that the clean hands doctrine
were to exist as a principle of international law, the Respondent cannot meet the strict criteria for

its application.°™

The Claimant asserts that in Niko Resources v. Bangladesh, the tribunal set a legal test for the
application of the clean hands doctrine composed of three elements derived from the Guyana v.
Suriname arbitration, namely: (i) claimant’s conduct said to give rise to “unclean hands” must
amount to a continuing violation; (ii) the remedy sought by the respondent in the proceedings
must be “protection against continuance of that violation in the future”, not damages for past
violations, and (iii) there must be a relationship of reciprocity between the obligations
considered. Pursuant to this last criterion, the clean hands doctrine would not be triggered when

the investor’s misconduct is unrelated to the claims set forth before the tribunal.°*°

SAS argues that the Respondent has not explained how the three groups of acts it alleges to be
violating the clean hands doctrine comply with each of these criteria,” nor does it identify any
alternative set of criteria for the application of the clean hands doctrine.** In particular, the
Claimant contends that the reciprocity criterion is not fulfilled in this case, since the Respondent’ s

allegations have nothing to do whatsoever with the causes of action on which the Claimant has

made its claims, namely Bolivia’s alleged violation of the investor protection guarantees

embodied in the Treaty.°?

The Claimant cites the reasoning of the Yukos tribunal according to which if an investor acts
illegally, the host State can request it to correct its behavior and impose upon it sanctions available
under domestic law; however, if an investor believes these sanctions to be unjustified, it must
have the possibility of challenging their validity in accordance with the applicable investment
treaty.“ The Claimant submits that the same reasoning applies in this case: if SAS’ allegedly
illegal acts form the very basis of Bolivia’s acts of expropriation, the Claimant must have the

possibility of challenging their validity in accordance with the Treaty.

The Claimant concludes that none of the criteria necessary for the application of the clean hands
doctrine is present in this case, and notes that in the event of national iterations of the clean hands
doctrine, plaintiffs are not required to have led blameless lives in order to access justice.”
Moreover, the Claimant reiterates that is a protected company under the Treaty that owns
qualifying investments in Bolivia, and the faults raised by Bolivia, none of which concerns the
making of an investment, should not distract this Tribunal from a fair hearing of the Claimant’s

claims under the Treaty on the merits.

(b) On the legality requirement

The Claimant does not contest that the requirement that investors comply with the law of the host

State when making an investment is implicit in the system of investment treaty arbitration.“

 

However, the Claimant posits that Bolivia’s invocation has two serious deficiencies: (i) that none
of the purported illegal conduct complained of relates to violations of laws concerning the
admission of the Claimant’s investment; and (ii) that none of the instances of alleged illegal
conduct occurred at the time it made its investment.“* The Claimant argues that these
requirements must be met in order to be able to invoke this doctrine and the absence of either one

is fatal to the Respondent's asserted defense.°

413. In relation to the first requirement, the Claimant, citing the Saba Fakes v. Turkey award, contends
that violations of the laws of the host State not directly concerned with “the admission of

investments” or “investment regulation” should not serve as a bar to jurisdiction.”

414. In this connection, the Claimant submits that none of the alleged illegal conduct argued by Bolivia
specifically concern legislation meant to regulate the inflow of foreign investment, nor do they

concern the very nature of investment regulation.“*

415. In relation to the second requirement, the Claimant argues that none of the illegalities alleged
concern conduct that occurred when its investment was made, which would render the legality
doctrine irrelevant.” The Claimant bases its assertion on the decisions of various investment
tribunals that have reached the conclusion that subsequent wrongdoing after the initiation of an
investment does not have jurisdictional consequences,®” for the legality requirement operates as

a limit on the host State’s consent to participate in investment arbitration.**!

416. For that matter, the Claimant explains that if the investor makes, effects or acquires the initial

investment illegally, then it takes itself out of the ambit of the protections of the investment

652

treaty.°* However, the Claimant further submits that, if the State complains of breaches of the

host State’s laws in the course of the investment and then imposes sanctions on the investor that
violate the investment treaty, the investor must have the possibility of challenging their validity

in accordance with the applicable investment treaty.°

In this context, the Claimant cites the Yukos
tribunal that noted that “it would undermine the purpose and object of the BIT to deny the investor
the right to make its case before an arbitral tribunal based on the same alleged violations the

existence of which the investor seeks to dispute on the merits” 6+

PCA Case No. 2013-15
Award

The Claimant draws attention to the fact that the Copper Mesa award also rejected the
applicability of the legality doctrine based on conduct that occurred after the initial investment,

and explained that to impose it subsequently would require clear wording in the Treaty.°>

Thus, the Claimant argues that it is necessary to ascertain that its conduct violated Bolivian law
at the time it made the investment, and further argues that the key question involves ascertaining
when SAS made its investment.° The Claimant contends that an ‘investment’ is deemed to have
been made when a contract is concluded with the host State or one of its authorized entities, or in
the absence of a contract with the State, when “definite commitments” are first made.°*” With that
guidance, the Claimant’s investment was made “years” before the illegalities alleged by the
Respondent, namely the key period for making the investment was between 2003 and 2008, when
the Claimant obtained the ten Mining Concessions covering the entire Project area, and
incorporated a wholly-owned Bolivian subsidiary, CMMK, for the purpose of exploring,

developing, managing, and exploiting the Project.®*

The Claimant notes that the period of the alleged illegalities was significantly later and that the
argument submitted by the Respondent that the investment was still being made when the
Reversion Decree was issued would require extending the stage of making of the initial
investment indefinitely.°°

The Claimant notes that the Respondent has been unable to provide this Tribunal with a

compelling reason as to why should it depart from established arbitral practice. Further, the

 

Claimant argues that Boliv:

 

is asking the Tribunal to read a legality requirement into the Treaty
where there is none, and to use that very absence of a legality requirement as permission to
“extend” the legality doctrine to the entire life of an investment, which would imply rewriting the
language of virtually all investment treaties that contain the “in accordance with law” language

upon which the legality doctrine is based.°!

421. The Claimant further states that the possibility to incorporate additional language into the Treaty
to expand the legality requirement was expressly rejected by the Metal Tech and Saba Fakes
tribunals. In this case, the Claimant notes that there is no express legality clause in the Treaty
requiring SAS to maintain, operate or expand its investment in accordance with national law or
good faith. Accordingly, the Tribunal “cannot incorporate such a requirement to the performance
or expansion of the investment ‘without doing violence’ to the language as well as spirit of the

BIT? 8

422. The Claimant notes that it is not asking the Tribunal to ignore Bolivia’s allegations; its argument
is that these are allegations to be weighed along with the merits, and not as an obstacle to prevent
the Tribunal from hearing the Claimant’s claim. For that matter, the Claimant asserts that the
relevant question for the Tribunal is whether an arbitration provides the proper timing, context,
and forum to resolve allegations of wrongful conduct.* The Claimant further contends if the
allegations were true, Bolivia’s proper recourse would be to investigate and prosecute the
perpetrators of these crimes following appropriate procedures and due process, instead of using

these allegations as a means to avoid its legitimate obligations under the Treaty.°

(c) On the Claimant’s alleged lack of clean hands

423. The Claimant argues that the Respondent has not even begun to fulfill the burden of proof
regarding Claimant’s alleged illegal conduct,” despite the fact that the Respondent bears the
burden of proving its jurisdictional objections under Article 27(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules and

the onus probandi incumbit actori maxim.%*

424. The Claimant contends that Bolivia should bear its burden through clear and convincing evidence,
not merely a preponderance, since the applicable standard of proof is heightened given grave

allegations, such as the ones expressed in the Counter-Memorial.% At any rate, the Claimant

alleges that the Tribunal must, at a minimum, demand “more confidence [from] the evidence relied

on.

The Claimant asserts that the Respondent offers only “pure probabilities or circumstantial
inferences,” none of which are sufficient to prove the acts it accuses the Claimant of.°"! Similarly,
Claimant argues that although it does not have the burden of proof, SAS has provided evidence
demonstrating that the Respondent’s factual assertions are either incorrect, taken out of context,

or simply insufficient to trigger the application of the legality or clean hands doctrines.°”

The Claimant denies Bolivia’s accusations regarding the alleged wrongful acts by the Claimant.°
The Claimant submits that Bolivia mostly relies on resolutions that CONAMAQ and FAOI-NP
imposed on the communities between December 2010 and February 2011, and, according to the
Claimant, Government officials had analyzed these in February 2011 and confirmed that they had

674

no grounds °* and that CMMK complied with “all” legal and administrative regulations

applicable to the mining industry.°”°

Similarly, the Claimant alleges that Bolivia ignored the resolutions when they were brought to its
attention®” and that the Minister of Mining and Metallurgy, Mario Virreira, on different occasions
confirmed that the allegations that the Respondent now submits to be true were made by “some

illegal miners” and that these are tactics used by community members from mining areas with the

 

purpose of illegally exploiting mining deposits.” The Claimant contends that illegal miners,
together with CONAMAQ and FAOI-NP leaders promoted divisions amongst the communities,
and the government, in particular the Government of Potosi, joined these efforts after the PEA

2011 was published in March 2011 showing the true magnitude of the “megayacimiento” 6”

Thus, in response to the Respondent’s accusations regarding CMMK causing division within the
Indigenous Communities, the Claimant argues that it was supported by the majority of the ayllus

and communities surrounding the Project, and that the efforts to divide the community came from

FAOI-NP and CONAMAQ, illegal miners, and the government itself.°”” The Claimant explains
that its decision to expand the Project Area of Influence was pursued precisely to avoid dividing
ayllus, and taking into account the location of the exploration works, geographical limitations,

and potential employment needs.”

Similarly, the Claimant asserts that contemporaneous evidence shows that COTOA-6A was an
initiative taken by the leaders of the six ayl/us surrounding the Project, who were concerned that
“their interests were not being properly represented by CONAMQ [sic] or FAOI-NP”.®! The
Claimant maintains that Bolivia’s allegations that COTOA-6A was under CMMK’s control are

groundless.

Regarding the alleged physical abuses by CMMK employees against community members of the
Malku Khota area, the Claimant asserts that the Respondent relies, in part, on a 2016 resolution

“made specifically in response to this arbitration,’**

and that the only evidence of these alleged
physical abuses against women from the community were “resolutions ‘adopted’ by opponents to
the Project back in 201] [which] do not even name the basic element —”who” or “when”— of the
alleged wrongful conduct.”*** The Claimant further states that the failure to investigate these facts

by Bolivian authorities shows that these allegations are groundless.“

The Claimant also rejects the Respondent’s accusations that CMMK promoted violence amongst
the communities. The Claimant notes that CMMK’s policy was to respect traditions, customs,
and the local authorities and instructed its employees to act accordingly.°*° The Claimant argues
that CMMK, starting in 2007 and until the alleged illegal expropriation of the Project, maintained
a close relationship with the communities and respected their rights at all times, and that the
support of the communities was confirmed also at the Gran Cabildo on June 8, 2012, attended by
800 families from 42 communities surrounding the Project.” Regarding the facts of Acasio in

May 2012, the Claimant argues that CMMK did not plan, provoke or approve the violence that

took place, and that the Respondent has submitted no evidence to prove otherwise “other than

Witness X” who is also contradicted by contemporaneous evidence.**

The Claimant submits that the Respondent’s accusations that CMMK paid journalists and police
officers to exaggerate the severity of the situation in Malku Khota and Acasio are untrue and taken
out of context. The Claimant argues that the payments made to journalist Gonzalo Gutiérrez

were related to his services as CMMK’s media coordinator,°

and that the public statements made
by the police officers were made at the officers’ own initiative.°! The Claimant maintains that
the payment made to one of the police officers for rendering a public and court-related declaration
was not contingent on the content of the declarations which remained consistent before and after

692

the payment In connection with the allegations of Witness X regarding the detention of Cancio

Rojas, the Claimant contends that it never authorized Witness X’s payment to policemen in

relation to said detention and neither was aware of it.

The Claimant underscores that Bolivia’s accusations on the alleged promotion of violence in the
communities near the Project, the alleged bribes to journalists and police officers, and the
existence of an alleged ‘Plan B’, are entirely dependent on Witness X’s testimony. The Claimant
contends that, Witness X’s testimony is unreliable given (i) the contradictions between its

testimony at the Hearing and the written testimony, in addition to corrections to the latter, (ii) the

 

documents contemporaneous with the events, including the ones produced by Witness X; and (i

its involvement in the bidding process that the Government of Bolivia had in 2016.°*

Finally, the Claimant contends that the Malku Khota Project presented no risk to the environment
since CMMK secured the corresponding environmental license and submitted to the relevant

authorities over eight environmental and socioeconomic studies, including compliance reports.©°

The Claimant concludes that the Respondent’s allegations are without merit and have nothing to

do with the making of the Claimant’s investment or with the Claimant’s cause of action: Bolivia’s

violation of the Treaty. Thus, the Claimant submits that the Respondent’s allegations of wrongful

conduct cannot affect the Tribunal’s jurisdiction or the admissibility of SAS claims.°°

3. The Tribunal’s Analysis

436. In addition to its jurisdictional objection related to the alleged absence of a protected investor or
investment under the Treaty, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to declare the inadmissibility
of the Claimant’s claims “as SAS does not have ‘clean hands’ and does not comply with the

requirement of legality of the investment.”°°"

437. Despite relying on the same factual grounds, the Respondent addressed the clean hands objection
and the objection on the alleged breach of the legality requirement under different subheadings
and attributed different effects to each. Regarding the clean hands objection, the Responded noted
consistently that it was an objection to the admissibility of SAS’ claims. On the other hand, the
Respondent invoked the alleged breach of the legality requirement as an objection to the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction and, alternatively, to the admissibility of the claims presented by the
Claimant.’ However, in its prayer, it only requested the Tribunal to declare SAS’ claims

inadmissible due to their failure to comply with the above-mentioned requirement. °°

438. For clarity, the Tribunal will first refer to the clean hands objection with the understanding that it
is an objection to the admissibility of the Claimant’s claims. Subsequently, it will address the
Respondent's allegations that the Tribunal “must decline its jurisdiction to decide on SAS’ claims
as they are contaminated with illegal acts under Bolivian law and international law, or

alternatively, declare them inadmissible.”™

added). The Tribunal notes that in the prayer included in the Counter-Memorial, Bolivia did not expressly refer to the alleged
breach of the legality requirement. Similarly, it notes that, in its Post-Hearing brief, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to
accept the relief sought by Bolivia in its Rejoinder. (See Bolivia's Post-Hearing brief, para. 164).

PCA Case No. 2013-15
Award

(a) On the existence and application of the clean hands doctrine

439. In respect of the clean hands objection raised by Bolivia, the Parties first dispute whether clean
hands is a principle applicable to the present case that, if satisfied, would prevent the Claimant

from availing itself of Treaty protection.

440. The Respondent alleges that the clean hands doctrine is a general principle of international law,
which is also part of international public policy, and “operates as a bar to the admissibility of the
claims in cases where the claimant has acted improperly in relation to the subject matter of its
claims.”' Conversely, the Claimant argues that the clean hands doctrine does not exist under
international law, and that, even if it did, the requirements for its application are not met in this

case. 72

441. First, the Tribunal notes that the text of the Treaty does not include any reference to the clean
hands doctrine. Nor does the Respondent propose an interpretation of the Treaty, under Article 31
of the Vienna Convention, that would result in the claims of an investor who “has acted

improperly in relation to the subject matter of its claim’ being inadmissible.

442. Bolivia’s main argument is that the clean hands requirement is a principle of international law
and, as such, it should be applied by the Tribunal.”* The Claimant accepts that the Treaty should
be supplemented, where appropriate, by the relevant principles of international law.” However,

it rejects the notion that the clean hands doctrine forms part of such relevant principles.”°>

443. Without prejudice to the conclusions reached by the Tribunal regarding the law applicable to this
dispute as outlined in section V.3 of this award, for the Tribunal to examine the merits of Bolivia’s
admissibility defense, it would have to be convinced that the clean hands doctrine is a general
principle of international law or that it forms part of international public policy. However, based
on the arguments and the evidence on the record, the Tribunal is not convinced that this is the

case.

444. The rubric “general principles of international law’ may have different meanings. 7° The

Respondent noted that the clean hands doctrine has been applied by international investment

tribunals,” defended by judges to the PCIJ and the ICJ,”* and recognized by international

tribunals and courts,”

and by the international doctrine.”"° Similarly, it asserted that the clean
hands doctrine is reflected in several legal maxims and principles,”"' that it is a reflection of the
principle of good faith, and that “it is also one of the ‘general principles of law recognized by

civilized nations’ pursuant to article 38(1)(c) of the Statute of the ICJ.”"*

445. Regardless of the source advocated by the Respondent, it is undisputed that general principles of

law require certain degree of recognition and consensus.7"*

According to the Respondent, the
analysis of these principles should principally consider “the practice of the States.”’* However,
Bolivia did not submit sufficient evidence to establish that the clean hands doctrine enjoys the
required recognition and consensus among the States to reach the status that Bolivia attributes to

it.

446. Bolivia asserted that the clean hands doctrine is widely recognized in civil law and common law
systems, and cites some decisions of the British House of Lords and the French Court of

the alleged status of the clean hands doctrine as a general principle of international law under the

terms of article 38(1)(c) of the ICJ Statute.

447. The Respondent also invoked various international court and tribunal decisions that would
confirm that the clean hands doctrine is a principle of international law.”!* In particular, Bolivia

cited various opinions by members of the PCIJ and the ICJ that, in its view, defend the “clean

of law as in Article 38(1)(c), or to certain logical propositions underlying judicial reasoning on the basis of existing international
law.”)

hands” doctrine.”!7 However, these are individual or dissenting opinions that do not seem even to
reflect the majority position of the respective courts in connection with the application of the clean
hands doctrine. In fact, this doctrine was not applied in any of the decisions the Respondent cited

as grounds to decline jurisdiction or to declare the inadmissibility of the claims.

448. Bolivia also referred to various investment arbitration tribunal decisions that, in its view, rejected
an investor’s claims based on the clean hands doctrine.”'* The Tribunal has reviewed these
decisions and finds that they do not support the premise that the clean hands doctrine is a general
principle of international law. In fact, the Respondent invoked tribunals that reached their
respective conclusions based on the appropriate treaty provisions or the applicable national law
without basing their decisions on the clean hands doctrine or advancing it as a general principle

of international law.

449. The only exception would seem to be the Al-Warrag case where the tribunal majority considered
that the clean hands doctrine made the claimant’s claims inadmissible.’!? However, in the
dispositif of its decision, the tribunal referred expressly to Article 9 of the OC Agreement as the
basis to conclude that the claimant was not entitled to any damages in respect of the breaches of
the fair and equitable treatment standard, and not that its claims were inadmissible due to the clean
hands doctrine.”° Therefore, the Al-Warrag tribunal’s decision also fails to prove the acceptance

and application of the above-mentioned principle under international investments law.

450. The Respondent also referred to certain authors who have stated that the clean hands doctrine
constitutes a principle of international law. However, as the Claimant notes, those same authors

recognize that the existence and application of this doctrine, as a matter of international law, are

still controversial.”!

hands doctrine is part of international public policy. Pursuant to the definition proposed by the

World Duty Free v. Republic of Kenya tribunal, and adopted by the Respondent itself, the term
“international public policy” refers to an international consensus on universal standards and

722

norms of conduct that must be applied in all fora.

The Respondent invoked the decisions of two investment arbitration tribunals that have dismissed
claims presented by claimants, among other reasons, due to the fact that such claims were based
on conduct contrary to international public policy.”* Beyond the factual differences between the
facts in the present case and those invoked by Bolivia, the Tribunal does not find that the decisions
cited support the general assertion that the clean hands doctrine is part of international public

policy. The Respondent did not invoke other materials in support of this allegation.

Based on the foregoing reasoning, the Tribunal finds that Bolivia has not shown that the clean
hands doctrine is part of international public policy or constitutes a principle of international law
applicable to the present case that defeats the jurisdiction of the Tribunal or affects the
admissibility of the claims filed by the Claimant. Given the above, the Tribunal does not consider
it necessary to examine compliance in this case with the requirements for the application of the

clean hands doctrine.

(b) On the legality requirement

The Respondent alleges that the Tribunal “must decline its jurisdiction to decide on SAS’ claims
as they are contaminated with illegal acts under Bolivian law and international law, or
alternatively, declare them inadmissible.””* Similarly, it argues that the unlawful conduct after
making the investment also impacts on the jurisdiction, but it states that, in any event, SAS’

unlawful conduct occurred during the making of its investment.’°

The Claimant, for its part, notes that Bolivia’s invocation of the “legality doctrine” is pointless
since none of the purported illegal conduct complained of relate to the admission or making of

SAS’ investment. ”° In accordance with the Claimant, any illegality that occurs in the

performance or implementation of an investment is an issue of the merits, and not of jurisdiction

or admissibility.””

The Tribunal notes that the Treaty does not contain an express requirement of the legality of the
investment or, in other words, the “in-accordance-with-law clause”. However, the Parties seem to
agree that the requirement of legality of the investment is implicit in the international investment

arbitration system and therefore operates even when a treaty provision is absent.”*

The Respondent has invoked several investor-State tribunal decisions finding that an investment
made in violation of the laws of the host State or international law (a) does not qualify as an
investment under the respective treaty and, therefore, deprives the tribunal of jurisdiction (ratione
materiae);’” (b) falls beyond the consent granted by the State to submit the dispute to arbitration

(jurisdiction ratione voluntatis);"*°

 

or (c) entails the denial of the substantive protections of the
treaty.”*! The Tribunal observes that in (a) and (b) the corresponding treaties contained an express

“in-accordance-with-law clause”.

In any event, in order to resolve the objection raised the Tribunal must refer to the Treaty. It is
uncontested that the Tribunal’s jurisdiction results from the agreement between the Parties.
Similarly, it is uncontested that, when entering into the Treaty, Bolivia offered to submit
investment disputes to arbitration under the terms of article 8(1) of the Treaty, and the investor

accepted this offer with the presentation of its Notice of Arbitration.
Article 8(1) of the Treaty provides:

Disputes between a national or company of one Contracting Party and the other
Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the latter under this Agreement in
relation to an investment of the former [...] shall [...] be submitted to international
arbitration if either party to the dispute so wishes. [Emphasis added].
Since the Parties’ consent was granted for disputes concerning investments, what is relevant to
determine whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction is that an investment exists under the terms of the

Treaty.

PCA Case No. 2013-15
Award

Article I(a) of the Treaty defines “investment” as “every kind of asset which is capable of
producing returns and in particular, though not exclusively, includes [...] shares in and stock and
debentures of a company and any other form of participation in a company, [...] any business
concessions granted by the Contracting Parties in accordance with their respective laws,

including concessions to search for, cultivate, extract or exploit natural resources.”

It is not disputed that the shares in CMMK fall within the definition of “investment” under the
Treaty.”* There is also no assertion that the investment is not recognized under the laws of
Bolivia, or as the investor’s assets.”*? Therefore, the fundamental question is whether under the
laws of Bolivia or international law, the conduct alleged to be a breach has the effect of depriving
the Claimant of its rights as a shareholder or, in general, its rights over its investment in Bolivia,

or that the investment per se ceases to exist due to the illegality.

The Respondent alleges that SAS, acting through CMMK, took a series of actions that violate the
right to self-determination of the Indigenous Communities, violate the personal integrity of their
women, and endanger their right to a healthy environment in their territories.”** Cognizant of the
severity of these allegations, the Tribunal notes that none of the alleged violations have the legal
consequence, under the laws of Bolivia or international law, of depriving SAS of the ownership

of, or its rights over, the corresponding assets, or of eliminating the existence of the investment.

Having established the existence of an investment under the terms of the Treaty, it remains to be
examined if what Bolivia alleges as SAS’ violations constitute conduct that taints the investment
with an illegality that precludes access to the Treaty’s protections — an admissibility issue — or
that there is a protected investment, but the unlawful investor’s conduct must be taken into

account as a defense of the Respondent on the merits of the case.

Based on the evidence on the record and Bolivia’s allegations in connection with this objection,
the Tribunal cannot conclude that SAS’ alleged unlawful conduct has resulted in the investment
— recognized as such under Bolivian law — no longer being recognized as a legal investment under
international law. Indeed, there is no evidence of a causal link between the alleged illegalities and
the investment itself for the purposes of jurisdiction or admissibility, and Bolivia does not seem

to allege the existence of such a relationship. This is, in the view of the Tribunal, a fundamental

732 See Statement of Claim and Memorial, paras. 112-113; Counter-Memorial, para. 224.

733 The Tribunal observes that when referring to its jurisdictional objection on indirect ownsership, Bolivia expressly noted that

“[w]hen an objection refers to the definition of ‘investment’, it criticizes the form of assets reputed as investment (v.

rn, is the

 

asset in question really a concession, action or title ?), which is not the case under our examination.” (Counter-Memorial, para.

240).

PCA Case No. 2013-15
Award

difference with other cases invoked by the Respondent itself wherein the tribunal held that it
lacked jurisdiction or that the claims were inadmissible as a result of the unlawful conduct of the

investor.

466. For example, in Jnceysa v. El Salvador, the tribunal found a series of actions to be in violation of
the principle of good faith, in connection with the bidding process that allowed the investor to
obtain the investment (a concession contract for the inspection of vehicles).”** In this context, the
Inceysa v. El Salvador tribunal noted:

This Tribunal considers that these transgressions of this principle committed by

Inceysa represent violations of the fundamental rules of the bid that made it possible

for Inceysa to make the investment that generated the present dispute. It is clear to
this Tribunal that, had it known the aforementioned violations of Inceysa, the host
State, in this case El Salvador, would not have allowed it to make its investment.”*°

467. Aside from the considerations of the tribunal in that case regarding the “in-accordance-with-law
clause” expressly established in that treaty, and the other considerations outlined by the tribunal
to conclude that it lacked jurisdiction over the dispute, the Tribunal notes that the reasoning
underlying its decision is the evident relationship between the investors’ illegal acts and the asset

constituting the investment.

468. Additionally, the Plama v. Bulgaria tribunal concluded that it had jurisdiction, but it could not
grant the investor the substantive protections under the Energy Charter Treaty, since the
investment had been obtained through fraudulent means, in violation of Bulgarian law and
contrary to the principle of good faith under domestic and international law. The decisive factor
for the tribunal’s holding was the relationship between the investment (the shares in Nova Plama)
and the investor’s illegal conduct (the deliberate concealment of information amounting to fraud)

that allowed it to acquire the investment.”*”

469. Thus, referring to the decisions of other tribunals, the Fraport v. Philippines II tribunal observed
that “there is an increasingly well-established international principle which makes international
legal remedies unavailable with respect to illegal investments, at least when such illegality goes
to the essence of the investment.””**

470. In the present case, the Respondent has not shown that the alleged violations go to the essence of
the investment such that it must be considered illegal. It is a different matter to say that CMMK’s
conduct gave rise to a de facto situation that motivated the reversion of the Mining Concessions,
as the Respondent seems to allege.” This does not mean that the investment ceased to exist under
the terms of the Treaty or became unlawful. Consequently, the Tribunal will take account of these
allegations as it examines the merits of the claims submitted by the Claimant and the defenses

raised by the Respondent.

471. Based on the above reasoning, the Tribunal concludes that the objection filed by the Respondent
on the basis of the alleged breach by SAS of the legality requirement applicable to the investment
cannot succeed. Consequently, the Tribunal has jurisdiction and the claims presented by the

Claimant are admissible.

739 See Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 326. (“[...] SAS, as alleged investor, was required to invest in accordance with the laws
of Bolivia. However, as explained above, SAS (through CMMK) failed with its obligations, as it systematically ignored the
human and indigenous peoples’ rights of the Indigenous Communities, in violation of Bolivian law. It was precisely the conduct
adopted by SAS that caused the Reversion.”)

MERITS
PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS OF THE TRIBUNAL ON THE FACTS

The Parties dispute several facts relevant to the dispute that resulted from the reversion of the
Mining Concessions. The Claimant accuses Bolivia of breaching its obligations under articles 2,
3, and 5 of the Treaty. The Respondent, in turn, rejects any breach of the Treaty and justifies the
decision contained in the Reversion Decree on the need to pacify the conflicts in the area of Malku
Khota and the duty to ensure respect for the rights of the Indigenous Communities. According to
Bolivia, the conflicts originated with CMMK’s negligent management of its relationship with the
local communities.” Reportedly, these conflicts escalated until they became uncontrollable for

reasons attributable to the Claimant.”"!

The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s accusations and alleges that Bolivia’s concern for human
and indigenous rights are ex post facto justifications manufactured by the Respondent to defend

itself in this arbitration.”

Contrary to Bolivia’s allegations, the Claimant argues that (i) the
indigenous communities surrounding the Project supported both SAS and CMMK; (ii) CMMK
was working towards consensus with the Malku Khota and Kalachaca communities through a
formal community relations program; and (iii) the violence was not caused by CMMK or SAS,
but by illegal miners whose interests lied in forming a cooperative to exploit the Malku Khota

deposit.”

Considering that the facts the Parties dispute in connection with the origin and development of
the community conflicts in the Malku Khota area span all the claims and defenses in this
arbitration, the Tribunal will address these facts before delving into the review and legal analysis
of the claims of the Claimant, without prejudice to the Tribunal subsequently expanding upon its

considerations and conclusions regarding the facts in discussion.

As a starting point, the Tribunal observes that some facts have been proven in this arbitration and

are not contested by the Parties.

It is undisputed that Bolivia is a country with a large indigenous population, possibly the country

with the highest percentage of indigenous population in Latin America; that it is organized as

a Plurinational State; that the Project is located in an extremely poor area, which is inhabited
by various indigenous communities, which belong to the Aymara or Quechua ethnic groups;"°
and that these communities follow a particular political organization, whose decision-making

system is governed by consensus or unanimity.”

Similarly, it is uncontested that the mining activities would have an impact on the communities
living in the area of influence of the Project. Therefore, the Claimant needed to implement a
community program that would enable it to develop positive relations with the local communities

from the onset.”"*

The Claimant alleges that it developed a community relations program that contributed to the
needs of the communities affected by the Project. Likewise, it acknowledged that some
investments were necessary to improve the standard of living in the community.” Although
apparently the inexistence of a regulatory framework in Bolivia governing the community
relations programs was uncontested, the Claimant itself has recognized the need to advance a

-750

program;’” it hired advisors on the subject and put together a community relations team.

The evidence on record in this arbitration indicates that CMMK focused its community relations
strategy on convincing a part of the community to support the Project against its objectors, that
is, it sought to obtain the approval of a majority of individuals to advance the Project, which gave
rise to problems with the Indigenous Communities given their organization and consensus-based

decision-making process.

Despite SAS’ assertion that it had established a community relations program since 2007,”! the
assessment of its own advisors on the subject shows that its community relations strategy had
serious shortcomings which remained uncorrected. Thus, for example, the Company held
individual meetings with some community members, disregarding their preference to have
collective meetings, and, similarly, made donations to individuals, rather than to the

community.’ The same report issued in 2009 by BSR, advisor to the Claimant, warned about the

72 At the hearing, Mr. Angulo accepted that he sometimes held meetings with some members of the community and not with
others. (Hearing Transcript, Day 2, 436:5-8 (English). Likewise, the evidence showed that the Company provided financial

124

PCA Case No. 2013-15
Award

problems with holding individual meetings and recommended providing economic support to the
community in general.”* However, the BSR report was not duly conveyed to the ones in charge
of CMMK’s community relations, as Mr. Santiago Angulo acknowledged during his cross-

examination at the Hearing.” As a result, the recommendations were not implemented.

481. The evidence on the record also shows that CMMK did not adequately communicate the
implications of the Project, nor did it address the concerns expressed very early on by the members
of the affected communities, for example, in connection with environmental pollution.”° The
workshops held by the Company covered basic topics on mining and the environment, and did
not even seem to correspond to the characteristics of the Project.”*° The Company’s contributions
to the community did not seem to be tailored to the Project, rather they addressed specific requests
made by certain community members. ”*’ The Claimant’s alleged actions and investments
benefiting the community were nothing but basic instruction on what a mining project consists
of, some minor investments in repairs and basic courses and, above all, an action directed to obtain
the support of the majority - emphasized by the Claimant throughout its briefs — without clear
evidence that an attempt was made to approach or reach consensus among the indigenous

communities, respecting their indigenous decision-making processes.

482. The body of evidence on the record indicates that the Company and its management knew that,
from the outset of the works, problems communicating with the communities emerged;”** that the
communities had expressed their disagreement with the treatment granted by some members of

the Company’s community relations team,’ and that the community members perceived that

760

CMMK did not comply with its promises, thus generating mistrus' Even Fernando Caceres

754 When asked about the BSR report conclusions, Mr. Angulo replied: “Well, in connection with this report, I didn’t see that
at that point in time or at that moment. The head of project gave me that, and since it was in English, I wasn’t able to read that
report.” And later on added: “As I said, the report was given to me by my head of project, but I cannot read English, so I wasn’t
able to interpret it. Ididn't know what the Report contained.” (See Hearing Transcript, Day 2, 436:14-17, 25-437:1-2 (English))

expressed his concern since December 2010 regarding the state of the Company’s relationship

with the communities.”

The disagreement in the community became obvious, at least since late 2010. Indeed, on
December 11, 2010, the ayllus of Sullka Jilatikani, Takahuani, Urinsaya, and Samka passed a

resolution warning as follows:

[CMMK] nust suspend the works for the following reasons: Abuses, contamination,
lack of respect for the indigenous authorities and bases in general, deceitful
proposals, projects; threats, reduction of stream water and destruction of our crop
areas, rape of our women in the [Community].7

On December 19 of the same year, the ayllus of Sullka Jilatikani, Takahuani, Urinsaya and Samka
approved a town hall resolution, whereby CMMK was accused of violating the collective rights
of the communities based on assertions similar to the ones contained in the above-mentioned
resolution.”* In early 2011, the FAOI-NP and the ayllu of Sullka Jilakitani issued resolutions

reiterating that CMMK had incurred in conduct that undermined their rights.”

The Claimant suggests that the assertions included in these resolutions should not be considered
truthful because (i) the Government confirmed that they were unfounded;’® (ii) they were
adopted through intimidation or use of force;7° and (iii) they do not represent the opinion of the
majority of the communities, but the opinion of illegal miners whose interests are aligned with

those of some leaders of the CONAMAQ and FAOI-NP.”7

The Tribunal does not consider that such allegations by the Claimant were proven in the course
of the arbitration. First, the ication of the Vice-Ministry of C ication, Social
Movement and Civil Society referred to by SAS to support its assertion that the Government

mentioned Vice-Ministry.”

487. Second, Mr. Gonzales Yutronic’s statements in support of the allegation that the resolutions were
issued through intimidation or by the use of force were disproved at the Hearing. During his cross-
examination, the witness recognized that he did not have direct knowledge that the community
members had been forced to sign the resolutions of CONAMAQ and FAOL-NP.”” As Mr.
Gonzales Yutronic explained, Mr. Angulo “told me that he had talked to leaders and community
members at that location, and that in many cases they were forced to take the vote or put the seal

on them, which is their custom.”

488. Despite the seriousness of the facts alleged, the Tribunal did not find evidence that the information
on said facts had been conveyed to the company management nor to the competent authorities.
Indeed, Mr. Gonzales Yutronic conceded that he had not presented the communications in which
he supposedly reported to his superiors at SAS and SASC that the 2010 resolutions had been

adopted through threats.”

Likewise, he acknowledged not informing the Government about
those events or the alleged violent actions against one of the community members who supported

the Company, which he claims to have witnessed.”

489. Finally, the Tribunal is not convinced that the opposition to the Project came exclusively from a
group of illegal miners that intended to exploit minerals in the place of the Mining Concessions.
In fact, the mining activity identified by Witness X in a report on the visit to the Malku Khota
community in January 2012 corresponds, in its own words, to mining activities developed by
some community members in a makeshift fashion in front of their own homes.’” In other words,
it was artisanal mining and not large-scale mining. In the view of the Tribunal, it is impossible to
reconcile the explanations provided by the Claimant regarding the complexity of the processes to
be undertaken for the extraction the minerals in the area, with its allegations regarding the

significance that the activity of “illegal miners” would have had in blocking the Project.

PCA Case No. 2013-15
Award

Based on the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that, despite having implemented a community
relations program, the Company had serious shortcomings in its relationship with the community
from the outset which were not corrected, despite the recommendations of the consultants hired
to assess such programs. The evidence on the record shows that the community expressed early
on their concerns regarding the Company’s activities’ and that, at least since late 2010, there
was opposition to the Project, which was expressed through the resolutions of the Indigenous

Communities’ government bodies.

That said, the Parties do not dispute the existence of a social conflict, and that marches,
demonstrations, and violent acts, including physical violence and deaths, emerged. Evidence on
the existence of the social conflict is abundant in the record. The substantive difference between
the Parties is that each of them holds the other one responsible for causing the conflict. In the

view of the Tribunal, it is clear, as mentioned in the paragraphs above, that the conflict with the

 

indigenous communities had its genesis in the Project. It is possible that poverty in the area and
even a history of actions or omissions by the government of Bolivia towards the communities had
contributed to the conflict, but even if it were assumed that the Claimant was not involved in

instigating the conflict, the actions it took upon seeing the first seeds of the conflict contributed

 

to the divisiveness and more profound clashes among the Indigenous Communities.

The Claimant explains that in early 2011 - i.e., when the signs of opposition to the Project were
clear — it decided to formalize its community program and brought additional community relations
staff, including Witness X.7”° However, the evidence on the record shows that the community
relations strategies implemented by CMMK as of that year sought to garner the support of the
majority and weaken the opposition, instead of finding consensus or agreements with the

community as their own advisors recommended.

First, the documentation provided by Witness X indicates that its recommendations were mainly
aimed to implement strategies to weaken the opposition, instead of promoting consensus. Thus,
for example, in a report dated January 2012 addressed to Jim Mallory, Witness X recommends,

among other things, the following:

Legal actions have to be brought against the individuals who were responsible for
the crimes, since this is the only way to set a precedent before the other community
members, because they do not want to speak and, as time goes by, they will take more
control of the current exploitation they have underway.

Corporation's Malku Khota Project in Potost, May 2009, pp. 4, 9.

I suggest broadening the action based on anti-economic conduct and economic
damage to the State based on their illegal exploitation within the Malku Khota
concession.

Internally within the ayllu a suggestion could be made to the authorities of the ayllu
itself to bring community justice with the eradication of the misconduct, thefts, and
threats.

If, in parallel, work is done in the legal, labor and social areas, these people will be
weakened.”

In fact, it has been shown that the Company filed criminal complaints against several community

leaders, which were later dismissed by the competent authorities.”

The Tribunal does not deny the Company’s right to take legal action to protect its interests.
However, that right cannot be exercised as a means to scare the members of the community and
appease the opposition, much less when there seems to be no basis for the exercise of the action,

as suggested by the fact that the Company’s accusations did not prevail.

Second, the evidence on the record suggests that CMMK focused its efforts on attempting to
communicate and impose support for the Project through COTOA-6A, instead of truly seeking

an actual approach with the communities that opposed the Project.

The Parties dispute whether COTOA-6A was an illegal organization created with the purpose to
serve as a platform for CMMK to displace the communities that opposed the Project, misinform
the central authorities and delegitimize the intervention of indigenous associations and genuine

authorities, as stated by Bolivia,” or whether, on the contrary, it was an autonomous regional

 

ion usly blished by the ities that felt unrepresented by the

 

authorities opposing the Project, as SAS alleged.”*°

Based on the available evidence, the Tribunal cannot be certain that COTOA-6A was created by
CMMK, as Bolivia alleges, nor does it have to determine for the purposes of this arbitration
whether it was an illegal organization or not under the laws of Bolivia. But even assuming that it
was an organization created spontaneously by certain community members, as the Claimant
alleges, what has in fact been demonstrated is that the Company focused its efforts on supporting,

coordinating and even attempting to monitor and control the actions advanced by COTOA-6A to

claim the continuity of the Project.’! It is unclear to the Tribunal how this strategy is to be

reconciled with the alleged intention to “build{] consensus with Mallku Khota and Calacacha.”"*?

Throughout the present arbitration, the Claimant has repeatedly noted that evidence shows
support for the Project by most of the population in the Project Area of Influence. The Tribunal
considers that, on the one hand, the Claimant did not establish the existence of the alleged majority
support and, on the other hand, the insistence on seeking majority support within a group against
the Project objectors not only threatened a decision-making structure that the Claimant was aware
of or should have been aware of, but it also undermined the recommendations of their own

advisors and decisively contributed to aggravating the conflict.

In connection with the first assertion, it was established that the community members who
opposed the Project neither participated in the meeting held on May 28, 2012, convened by the
Office of the Governor and the Ministry of Mines and Metallurgy, nor in the “gran cabildo” on
June 8, 2012 — two events that the Claimant cites as evidence of the so-called substantial support
of the communities for the Project — included the participation of the community members who
opposed the Project since they were marching to La Paz precisely to protest against it.”*
Circumstantial evidence on the record also shows the Company’s involvement in the organization
of this “gran cabildo” and, therefore, that it was not an impromptu meeting in support of the

Project, as the Claimant alleges.”**

In connection with the second assertion, the Tribunal has already established that the Indigenous
Communities made decisions unanimously or by consensus, such that insisting on mechanisms
to garner the support of the majority was not only insufficient to adequately develop the Project
but also contributed to increasing the unease and confrontation among the community members.
The Tribunal also notes, and the Claimant accepts, that the communities that opposed the project
—Malku Khota and Kalacacha — were the closest to the mine.”** Therefore, it was not about “two
tiny communities,” as SAS suggests,”*° but rather the communities most directly impacted by

CMMK’s mining activities.

502. The evidence on the record shows that the expressions of opposition to the Project, in particular
by the ayllu of Sullka Jilakitani, increased during 2011.7’ Similarly, the violent clashes between
the community members that opposed the continuation of the Project and those that supported it

increased until reaching a critical point between April and July 2012.

503. The uncontroverted facts at the time include the hostage taking of an objector to the Project and
a Company employee by the community members;”** clashes between the community members
and the police in the Project area, during which two police officers were taken hostage;”” violent
clashes between members of COTOA-6A and objectors to the Project in Acasio;” the taking of
Kuraka Cancio Rojas as a hostage by members of COTOA-6A;”! and new violent clashes
between the police and the community members, in which one of the demonstrators died in July

2012.77

504. Even though the Parties dispute their respective roles in connection with these facts, and hold
each other responsible, neither Party fails to acknowledge their gravity. In any event, it is clear to
the Tribunal that, by the time the Reversion Decree was issued, there was an acute social conflict
in the Project area, resulting from the increasingly radical clash between the community members
in support of the Company — mainly COTOA-6A - and those who objected to their continuation

in the area.

hostilities or that, as Bolivia claims, was the sole cause of the social conflict and the severe clashes

community relations activities which led to unrest in the communities directly affected by the
Project and which were questioned by its own advisors, and that, as the conflict ensued, the
Company adopted a strategy that contributed to increase the divisions among the Indigenous
Communities, the radicalization of the opposition groups and the practical impossibility of
seeking the consensus that its advisors warned would be necessary in order to operate in the
region. The documents provided by Witness X render an account of an aggressive strategy that
helped worsen the conflict and that is very far from the search for consensus or agreement, and

which intended to show majority support and to weaken the Project’s objectors.

It is uncontested that, until the date the Reversion Decree was issued, CMMK owned the rights
over the Mining Concessions and complied with the strict legal requirements to develop the
Project in the exploration stage. However, CMMK was to operate in an area characterized by a
delicate social and cultural balance, which followed a political organization and particular
decision-making process based on consensus. Neither the community relations programs that the
Company implemented, nor the Company’s attitude took into account these characteristics.
Rather, they attempted to establish an alleged majority supportive of its cause and have it prevail,
thus furthering the conflict within the Indigenous Communities, which eventually resulted in

severe violent clashes in the Project area.

In brief, based on the evidence on the record, the Tribunal concludes that: (i) despite having
implemented an allegedly appropriate and adequate community relations program, CMMK had
serious failures in its community relations from the outset which remained uncorrected in spite of
BSR’s warnings; (ii) there was opposition to the Project and to CMMK’s presence since at least
December 2010, expressed through the resolutions of Indigenous Communities government
bodies; (iii) starting in 2011, CMMK implemented a strategy for the management of the
communities focused mainly on weakening the opposition and consolidating a majority opinion,
supposedly represented by COTOA-6A, which contributed to the aggravation of the conflict; and
(iv) at the time the Reversion of the Mining Concessions was decreed, there was a social conflict
in the Project area that had been escalating for some time and that resulted in violent clashes
between community members in relation to it. In the corresponding sections, the Tribunal will

analyze the implications of this situation.

B. THE CLAIM FOR EXPROPRIATION
1. The Claimant’s Position

508. The Claimant asserts that, notwithstanding the terms used in a governmental measure — whether
nationalization, reversion or expropriation” — and the title of the investor impacted by such
measure — whether it is ownership of a physical asset or “rights that are economically significant

to the investor” ,”*

such as the rights arising from a concession agreement” —, the “outright
seizure or formal or obligatory transfer of title in favour of the host State” undoubtedly constitutes
expropriation under international law.”° The Claimant considers obvious that the Reversion,

which ordered “unambiguously [...] the taking of CMMK’s rights over the Mining Concessions

by the Government’,”" constitutes direct expropriation of the Claimant’s investment in the

Project.7°8

509. The Claimant alleges that upon expropriation of the Mining Concessions of CMMK, a Bolivian
corporation wholly owned by SAS, Bolivia should have paid the Claimant “prompt, adequate and
effective compensation” pursuant to the terms of Article 5(2) of the Treaty.”” In particular, the
Claimant asserts that Article 5 of the Treaty, which reflects “the customary international law

standard of compensation” lays down the following requirements for the compensation:

a) Fair and adequate compensation, i.e. based on the fair market value of the taken
investment.**! The Claimant submits that compensation should “amount to the market
value of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation or before the
impending expropriation became public knowledge”, as provided for expressly under

Article 5(1) of the Treaty.8°?

b) | Prompt compensation, namely done without delay.*°’ The Claimant, relying on legal

authorities and the conclusions of other arbitral tribunals, argues that the payment of
compensation should be contemporaneous with the expropriation and be made as quickly
as possible, or at least within a reasonable period of time.*' The Claimant contends that

the State breaches the promptness requirement cited when the investor has not received any

compensation “several months” after the date of the effective taking.*”

510. The Claimant argues that Bolivia has yet to pay a compensation to SAS that amounts to the market
value of the investment, following a reasonable length of time after the expropriation of the
Mining Concessions.*” The Claimant submits that it cannot be considered that Bolivia has made
“any meaningful offer of payment” during this period,*”’ as the valuation process under the

Reversion Decree (i) was never negotiated with the Claimant, despite the fact that the Claimant

79808

“did seek to engage with Bolivia and sought to meet to discuss valuation,”*** and (ii) it would

only be based on costs incurred by CMMK, and, therefore, any compensation based on the

Reversion Decree would also completely ignore the fair market value of the Project.*”

511. The Claimant argues that failure to pay compensation is a fact “sufficient in itself to establish the
expropriation’s unlawful nature in light of both the Treaty and international law.” ’! The
Claimant submits that valuation and the corresponding payment of compensation are a “pre-
existing obligation” to arbitration, which establishes the legality of expropriation and cannot be a
consequence of the arbitral process because if that was the case “the States would no longer have

an incentive to provide prompt, adequate, and effective compensation to the expropriated

investor.”*"'

512. The Claimant challenges the relevance of the case law invoked by Bolivia as it not only refers to

alleged scenarios of indirect expropriation, as opposed to direct expropriations, such as the

Reversion, *!?

but it establishes that expropriation without compensation is not per se illegal
provided the State has made an offer of payment, something that Bolivia has not done in this

case.83

513. The Claimant further argues that the Reversion did not comply with the other cumulative legal

criteria provided for under Article 5(1) of the Treaty, since:

(a) The Reversion violated due process. The State must offer the investor the opportunity to
“assert its rights”, i.e. to challenge the legality of the expropriation and to participate in the
determination of adequate compensation. However, Bolivia formalized its decision to
expropriate in the course of a series of meetings where the Claimant was never present; and
the valuation process it imposed in the Reversion Decree would have been carried out
unilaterally by COMIBOL, without the Claimant being able to participate in the

quantification of compensation.*"*

(b) The Reversion did not have a public purpose. Expropriation must (i) be based on a
“genuine” public purpose,*!® and (ii) constitute a proportionate and necessary measure in

relation to the aim sought.*!®

i. As to the genuine public purpose, the Claimant contends that the true motivation
behind the Reversion was for Bolivia to seize control of the multi-million dollar
deposit SAS discovered,*!” and that the alleged concerns for human rights or for the
specific rights of the Indigenous Communities are “ex post facto justifications
manufactured by Bolivia” to defend itself in this arbitration.*'* The Claimant submits
that the Reversion Decree refers solely to the “social conflict” in Malku Khota,*'®
which is a false pretext, rather than a cause with a genuine public purpose given that
“to placate a violent minority” is a temporary security concern that the investor could

have resolved.*” For the Claimant, it is proven that the Reversion was adopted solely

as the social conflict started in May
2012,’ while Bolivia had intended to expropriate since the establishment of the

Immobilization Zone in 2011, just as SAS released the results of the PEA 2011.°

ii. The Claimant further argues that the Reversion is wholly disproportionate with the
stated objective of pacifying the social conflict.'* Illegal gold mining was the root
cause of the conflict in Malku Khota,** and instead of punishing the illegal gold

miners, Bolivia by its own actions and inactions preferred to stoke conflict and the

“anti-CMMK” sentiment in the region, as an excuse to expropriate SAS’ lawful

as an alternative to expropriation to avoid the conflict, including the militarization

of the area surrounding Malku Khota,*”” and concludes that expropriation “did

nothing meaningful to stop the violence in the area,” as violent protests continued at

least until July 2015.%°8

(c) | The Reversion did not serve a social benefit related to the domestic needs of Bolivia. While
the Malku Khota Project could have brought “millions of dollars of investments to one of
the poorest areas of Bolivia,” neither the Government nor the local communities have
obtained any benefit from the Reversion, and community representatives request that SAS

comes back to the area to continue with the Project.*”

wrongful act because there was a state of necessity, the Claimant submits that by invoking this

defense Bolivia acknowledges that the expropriation was illegal, as the state of necessity is a

circumstance that would exclude the wrongfulness of the actions that would, otherwise, be

unlawful.$*°

515. The Claimant further argues that the defense related to the state of necessity cannot prevail as (a)
Article 25 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility**! provides that this defense can only be

832

invoked in a situation between two States, which is not the case;*** (b) the rigorous requirements

established in Article 25 for this defense to prevail are not met,*** since the Reversion Decree was
not intended to safeguard an essential interest of the Respondent. Neither was it faced with a grave
and imminent peril, or even if faced with such a peril, the Reversion Decree would not have been
the only option for Bolivia, nor was there a violation of an obligation owed to another State, but

to a foreign investor.

516. The Claimant states that the Treaty implicitly “excludes necessity” because it constitutes a special
set of rules of international law that displaces the customary international law minimum standard
of treatment as well as any defenses that would be available under customary international law.**
Finally, the Claimant submits that the Respondent failed to show that it did not “contribute to the

alleged situation of necessity.”**

517. The Claimant contends that the wording of Article 25 is formulated in the negative in order to
show that this defense constitutes an exception,** and that investment tribunals have addressed
this exceptional nature. Similarly, the Claimant submits that the requirements need to be complied

with cumulatively.”

518. Finally, the Claimant further argues that, even if the Tribunal accepted that Bolivia faced a state
of necessity when it took the measures, it would still have to compensate the Claimant as that is

a separate and distinct obligation.*** The Claimant notes that Article 27 provides that invocation

of a circumstance precluding wrongfulness is without prejudice to the question of

compensation.*”

519. In regards to the argument that the Reversion was an exercise of the State’s police powers, the
Claimant asserts that the Respondent is not entitled to invoke this doctrine as a defense to liability

or the obligation to compensate™”

since the Reversion was not the enactment of a regulation but
a specific action to deprive the Claimant of its investment, which constitutes an unlawful
expropriation pursuant to the Treaty which, as /ex specialis, displaces any possible exception to

the obligation to compensate under customary international law.**!

520. Further, it is an ex post facto justification because, had Bolivia considered that it was exercising
its police powers at the moment it took the measures, it would have not included a compensation

provision in the Reversion Decree.*”

521. Ifthe Tribunal nevertheless decides to consider this defense, the Reversion Decree did not comply
with the applicable standard* because (i) it did not serve a public purpose;*“ (ii) it was not
enacted bona fide; (iii) it was discriminatory as it was intended exclusively for the Claimant;
(iv) it did not comply with due process;** (v) it was not proportional;**° and (vi) Bolivia had
already breached its international obligations before enacting the Reversion Decree (inter alia,
that of providing full protection and security for the concessions™” and granting fair and equitable

treatment*“*).

522. Thus, the Claimant submits that the Reversion was an expropriation measure adopted in breach

of the Treaty, which constitutes a wrongful act under international law.”

2. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent argues that SAS has not demonstrated that the Reversion constitutes an
expropriation under Article 5 of the Treaty.** Bolivia argues that the first requirement for a State
measure to be considered expropriation is that the measure in question constitutes “a real
expropriation and not a legitimate exercise of police powers” by the State.**! The Respondent
contends that measures adopted under the sovereign prerogative of the State to exercise its police
powers for a public purpose **? enjoy a presumption of legality *? and are excluded from
expropriation provisions in treaties,*™ as well as an arbitral tribunal’s review of legitimacy.*°°
These measures include those (i) adopted to safeguard a public interest, and (ii) proportional to

the public purpose at stake.*°°

The Respondent alleges that the Reversion is a “legitimate exercise of [Bolivia’s] police powers
in response to the crisis created and aggravated by CMMK,” and, therefore, cannot be called an

expropriation. **”

The Respondent submits that the Reversion was adopted to protect human rights and the
indigenous rights of the Indigenous Communities, which constitute the “overriding public

858

interest” warranting the exercise of police powers.** Protection of such rights is more than

justified under both international law and arbitral jurisprudence.*°

The Respondent argues that the Reversion was a proportional measure to guarantee the human
rights of the Indigenous Communities given “the repeated and continuous violations that were
being committed by CMMK”.® The Reversion was enacted after Bolivia attempted to exhaust
other options, whose failure is only attributable to SAS.**' Moreover, the Reversion did not have

a “substantial economic impact” on the rights arising from the Mining Concessions, as these were

in the exploration stage and the Reversion Decree “offered equivalent compensation to the amount

invested in the exploration activities” 8°

The Respondent argues that “Bolivia fully satisfied the compensatory provision of the [Treaty] —

even though it had no obligation to do so” 8

Fulfillment of the compensation standard under
Article 5 of the Treaty does not require payment of a compensation, or for the amount of the
compensation to be estimated definitely; rather it is “sufficient that the State adopted measures to

determine compensation at the date of expropriation” 5

According to the Respondent contends that adequate and prompt compensation establishes
consecutive conditions that require the State (a) to proceed with the estimation of the market value
of the investment, i.e. “to estimate just compensation’’;** the Respondent contends that the Treaty
establishes arbitration as one of the ways to determine compensation when there is a dispute over
the existence of an expropriation and the amount owed;*® and (b) once just compensation has
been estimated, to pay “without delay” .**’ Contrary to the Claimant's allegations, within “several
months,” the State must indicate “whether compensation is going to be paid, but they do not
[require] that compensation be actually paid within that period’.*** Neither the Treaty nor
international law set a specific deadline for estimating fair compensation and the corresponding
payment.°°

The Reversion Decree provides for payment of compensation upon completion of an independent
valuation process to estimate the amount, and Bolivia began the process provided for in Article 5

in compliance with the compensation provision.*”

The Respondent asserts that “the mere fact that compensation has not been paid before the
arbitration cannot constitute a violation of the [Treaty]”.8"' Bolivia submits that a payment offer
was made directly to SAS as provided for in the Reversion Decree and that it “tried, in good faith,
to involve [SAS] in the process of determining the compensation”, but it was the Claimant who

declined to participate in any way in the valuation process and opted for arbitration to determine

the compensation amount.*””

Therefore, fair compensation shall be determined in this arbitration
and payment shall be made promptly “provided it is made promptly upon a final decision by this

Tribunal ordering payment (quod non) has been issued and remedies have been exhausted.”

Similarly, the Respondent alleges that SAS has not shown that the Reversion was adopted in
violation of the legality conditions under Article 5 of the Treaty.’ Bolivia considers that legality
refers to “whether the State is authorized to expropriate or not,” and that payment of the
compensation “is a separate obligation, a consequence of expropriation”.*” Thus, citing
decisions of various international tribunals,*” the Respondent contends that “the expropriations
that meet all other conditions except for the payment of compensation are lawful”.*” The
Respondent contends that no arbitral tribunal, including those that have decided on direct
expropriations, has concluded that an expropriation is unlawful based solely on lack of

compensation.*”
The Respondent submits that, had there been an expropriation, it would have been lawful,*”

since:

(a) Bolivia complied with due process. Relying upon the Treaty and the doctrine, arbitral

 

tribunals have confirmed that respect for due process consists merely in making available
to the investor remedies for challenging an expropriation measure, once adopted. **?
CMMK could have challenged the Reversion Decree and its valuation process before the
Bolivian authorities, but never did.**' Contrary to the Claimant’s assertion, neither the
Treaty nor international law provide for the obligation to include the investor in the

882

decision-making or the valuation process.*** At any rate, on the one hand, Bolivia invited

CMMK to attend several meetings where the Reversion was discussed as an alternative,

but limited its participation due to security concerns** and, on the other hand, it is perfectly

legitimate for the valuation process to be exclusively determined by the State.***

The Reversion served a public purpose. The concept of public purpose needs to be analyzed
pursuant to Bolivian law,*** and under such law, the Reversion has a public purpose as it
was necessary to preserve public order, and guarantee the human and collective rights of
the Indigenous Communities.**° The State has broad discretion to determine the measures
that meet this requirement, including “taking of measures that are deemed necessary to
protect human and indigenous rights” .**’ Contrary to the Claimant’s allegations, Bolivia
considers it patent, under the provisions of the Reversion Decree, that the only motivation
for this measure was the protection of the human rights and indigenous rights of the
Indigenous Communities.*** Bolivia rejects the idea that there is a hidden economic interest
since (i) areas, such as the Immobilization Zone, were established at the same time for other
mining projects; (ii) no mining project has been developed in Malku Khota following the
Reversion; and (iii) Bolivia has respected the rights of other investors who had a proper

public relations program with the indigenous communities.**°

The Claimant’s formulation of proportionality does not apply and only a “rational link” is
required between the measure and the public purpose.**° The Respondent contends that the
grave emergency situation created and promoted by CMMK and its inability to resolve the
conflict justify Bolivia’s adoption of the Reversion Decree to reestablish public order and
protect the rights of the Indigenous Communities.**! The Respondent considers that the
Reversion was the most appropriate measure to pacify the area given the seriousness of the

situation and that other measures (such as the militarization SAS proposed) would not be

effective to resolve conflicts with the Indigenous Communities*” and have in fact had

terrible consequences in the past;**? moreover, at present, there is no conflict in the area.**

(d) The Reversion served a social benefit. According to the Respondent, the Reversion
contributed to the social benefit of the Indigenous Communities, “by pacifying the conflicts

in the Mallku Khota area and avoiding new violations of [their] rights”.*°°

533. In short, the Respondent contends that the Reversion “cannot be considered as an expropriatory

measure, much less an unlawful one”.°°

534. The Respondent moreover invokes the state of necessity as the reason to preclude the alleged

wrongdoing under the Reversion.*””

535. Based on the ILC Articles on State Responsibility,*** the Respondent asserts that the Reversion
was “the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against grave and imminent
peril.” The Respondent details that (i) the human and indigenous rights of the Indigenous
Communities “constitute, at the very least, a fundamental interest’ for Bolivia;*” (ii) CMMK
represented a grave and imminent peril due to the fact that its actions “promoted and exacerbated
social conflict, generating a constant violation” of Bolivia’s fundamental interest;°” and (iii)
there is no doubt that the only way to protect this fundamental interest was by expelling CMMK
from Malku Khota, since the Indigenous Communities agreed with this measure. The Government
suggested other viable alternatives that were rejected by CMMK or failed because of CMMK,
and the Government’s experience shows that “retaking the State control is the most effective
measure to end a conflict between Indigenous Communities resulting from the operation of a

mining project”. °°!

Award

The Respondent further submits that the Reversion “does not affect gravely the fundamental
interests of a State or States against which there is an obligation, or the international community

as a whole”,°” and, at any rate, the protection of the human rights of the Indigenous Communities

prevail over any economic interest of the United Kingdom; °*

and Bolivia respected any
hypothetical interest of the United Kingdom or the international community when offering

compensation to the investor.°™*

The Respondent alleges that, in this case, there are no impediments to Bolivia invoking the state
of necessity as, on the one hand, the Treaty does not include any provision barring such an
invocation and, on the other hand, CMMK is the only party responsible for the violations of the

human rights of the Indigenous Communities.”

Therefore, the Respondent considers that “Bolivia’s actions, including the Reversion Decree,

could not have been illegal, even if those actions were contrary to the Treaty” °°

3. The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Claimant’s principal claim is that the Tribunal declares that the Respondent, through the

Reversion, illegally expropriated its investment in breach of Article 5 of the Treaty.

The Respondent counters the Claimant’s claim with three defenses on the merits: (i) the Reversion
was lawful, and it was issued in observance of international law, (ii) the state of necessity, (iii) the

Reversion involved the legitimate exercise of police powers and not an expropriation.

The Tribunal observes that the arguments concerning the legitimate exercise of police powers and
the state of necessity were only raised by the Respondent in this arbitration with the filing of its
Rejoinder. The Tribunal does not find that the Respondent has provided convincing support for
how Bolivia’s conduct and the evidence it introduced in support of its argument that Reversion
was a lawful expropriation under the Treaty — the defense on the merits put forward by the
Respondent at the outset of the arbitration—also supports the alleged exercise of police powers or

the state of necessity.

The Tribunal will analyze the substantial defenses asserted by Bolivia in the order they were
presented in the arbitration. First, the Tribunal will examine if the Reversion constitutes an
expropriation which fulfills the requirements of Article 5 of the Treaty, then, it will address the

state of necessity defense and, finally, the police powers.

(a) On the alleged unlawfulness of the Reversion

The Tribunal will proceed to consider if the Reversion Decree constitutes an unlawful
expropriation, as the Claimant alleges, or whether it is an expropriation meeting the requirements

of Article 5 of the Treaty, as the Respondent alleges.

Article I(a) of the Treaty defines “investment” as “every kind of asset which is capable of

producing returns,” and includes as examples the same concessions awarded by the Contracting
Parties in accordance with their respective laws, including concessions to explore, develop,
extract, or exploit natural resources. The Tribunal has already found that the shares that SAS holds
indirectly in CMMK are an investment for the purposes of the Treaty. It is undisputed that CMMK
is the holder of the Mining Concessions and that their expropriation affects the value of SAS’

shares.
In turn, Article 5 of the Treaty provides the following:

(1) Investments of nationals or companies of either Contracting Party shall not be

nationalised, expropriated or subjected to measures having effect equivalent to
nationalisation or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as “expropriation” in the
territory of the other Contracting Party except for a public purpose and for a social
benefit related to the internal needs of that Party and against just and effective
compensation. Such compensation shall amount to the market value of the
investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation or before the
impending expropriation became public knowledge, whichever is the earlier, shall
include interest at a normal commercial or legal rate, whichever is applicable in the
territory of the expropriating Contracting Party, until the date of payment, shall be
made without delay, be effectively realizable and be freely transferable. The national
or company affected shall have the right to establish promptly by due process of law
in the territory of the Contracting party making the expropriation, the legality of the
expropriation, the legality of the expropriation and the amount of the compensation
in accordance with the principle set out in this paragraph.

(2) Where a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company which is
incorporated or constituted under the law in force in any party of its own territory,
and in which nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party own shares, it
shall ensure that the provisions of paragraphs (1) of this Article are applied to the
extent necessary to guarantee prompt, adequate and effective compensation in
respect of their investment to such nationals or companies of the other Contracting
Party who are owners of those shares.

The Parties do not contest that the Contracting Parties under the Treaty may expropriate
investments of investors of the other Contracting Party, provided it is done in accordance with the
requirements of Article 5 of the Treaty. It is equally understood between the Parties that only
expropriations carried out (a) for a public purpose and a social benefit related to the internal needs
of that Contracting Party; (b) in accordance with due process, and (c) against just and effective
compensation, will be lawful under Article 5 of the Treaty. These are cumulative conditions that

need to be observed by the State.

The difference between the Parties is that, while the Claimant considers that Bolivia did not
comply with any of the conditions mentioned above such that the expropriation is unlawful, the
Respondent considers that the expropriation is lawful as it complied with each and every

requirement mentioned above.”

As a starting point, the Tribunal observes that neither the Memorandum of Understanding of July
7, 2012 — an act that initiated the expropriation process, according to the Claimant -, nor the
Reversion Decree — the act to be understood as the beginning of the expropriatory process,
according to the Respondent — use the term “expropriation” but rather refer to the “annulment”
and the “reversion” of the Concessions. The Tribunal considers that this is not on its own a reason

to conclude that there was no expropriation.

On the one hand, Article 5 of the Treaty reads: “shall not be nationalised, expropriated or
subjected to measures having effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation (hereinafter
referred to as ‘expropriation’ in the territory of the other Contracting Party.” Based on the above,

a measure does not have to be called “expropriation” to be considered as such.

On the other hand, the contemporaneous evidence shows that the Bolivian authorities themselves

+9908

in their public statements referred to the measures as a “nationalization,”””* a term expressly

included in the Treaty.

For the Tribunal, consequently, there is no doubt that the Respondent expropriated the Mining
Concessions through the issuance of the Reversion Decree. Therefore, it must examine whether
Bolivia acted in accordance with the requirements of Article 5 of the Treaty, that is: (a) whether

there was a public purpose and a social benefit related to the internal needs of the State of Bolivia;

(b) whether due process was observed, and (c) whether the obligation of providing just and

effective compensation was observed.

i Was there a public purpose and social benefit cause related to the internal
needs of the State of Bolivia?

552. Article 5 of the Treaty, which has been cited so many times, provides:

“Investments of nationals or companies of either Contracting Party shall not be
nationalised, expropriated or subjected to measures having effect equivalent to
nationalisation or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as “expropriation”) in the

territory of the other Contracting Party except for a public purpose and for a social

benefit related to the internal needs of that Party.” [Emphasis added]

553. In its eleventh and twelfth preambular paragraphs, the Reversion Decree provides as follows:

 

“WHEREAS, the prospecting and exploration activities carried out by Compania
Minera Mallku Khota S.A. in the Mallku Khota sector and the process for the
socialization of the mining project with the various communities and ayllus has
created problems which, in the past few months, have caused the social conflicts to
escalate, thus jeopardizing the life of the local population and the company’s staff.

WHEREAS, the claim held by Compajiia Minera Mallku Khota S.A. over the 219
mining blocks was vested in it under the pre-2009 legislation; accordingly, in the
face of the extreme social situation in the Mallku Khota sector, and with a view to
preserving social peace and guaranteeing the area’s return to a normal state of
affairs, intervention by the Government has become necessary in accordance with
the provisions of the New Political Constitution of the State.”

554. The Claimant considers that the expropriation was not carried out for a public purpose and for a

social benefit related to the internal needs of the Respondent.*”

555. The Claimant does not seem to dispute the Respondent’s position regarding the State’s discretion
to establish public purposes.°'° However, it notes that this discretion cannot be mistaken with the

possibility to be unreasonable or arbitrary decisions in the exercise of that discretion.”!!

556. The Claimant believes that the expropriation is not in accordance with the Treaty provisions as to

the public purpose and social benefit for the reasons summarized below:

(a) | The Reversion Decree only made vague reference to problems which resulted “in the past

few months have caused the social conflicts to escalate,” but never once mentions human

rights or the protection of the indigenous communities, which are ex post facto justifications

brought by Bolivia to defend itself in this arbitration.°!”

(b) The only public purpose declared by Bolivia was the need to end the social conflict in the
Malku Khota region and restore peace. According to the Claimant, this is truly a pretext
since these were temporary security problems that could have been remedied by the

investor and the ulterior motives for the expropriation were different.°!

(c) The Claimant asserts that Bolivia had announced, at least a year before the escalation of
the conflict mentioned in the Reversion Decree, that it intended to expropriate the Mining
Concessions.’!* Additionally, the conflict referred to in the Reversion Decree started in
2012 when Bolivia already intended to expropriate and the true purpose of the
expropriation was that Bolivia intended to gain control of a mining project worth US$13
billion. °'* The motive behind Bolivia’s announcement, prior to the issuance of the
Reversion Decree, that it intended to expropriate was the public release of the PEA 2011

reflecting the deposit’s size.°'®

(d) The social conflict mentioned in the Reversion Decree is not attributable to the Claimant,
but was initiated by illegal miners and by individuals interested in creating a cooperative
to exploit the deposit, and it is the Respondent’s actions and inactions that led to the extreme

social situation mentioned in the Reversion Decree.°!”

(e) The expropriation was neither a necessary nor proportionate measure to restore public
order. Bolivia had other alternatives, which included the appointment of a special
commission, insulated from political pressure, to gather information and communicate with
the communities; to implement an emergency plan to improve infrastructure and services
in the area; or to militarize the area.°!* The fact is that social discontent continued after the
expropriation and press reports document that the violent protests continued. Therefore, the

expropriation was not the solution to the social problem, as Bolivia alleges.”

(f) Finally, the Claimant states that the Reversion was not carried out with a social benefit
related to the internal needs of Bolivia because the Project would have brought millions of
dollars of investments to one of the poorest areas of Bolivia, and neither the Government
nor the local communities have derived any benefit after the Reversion, and the Indigenous
Community representatives have requested that SAS come back to the area to continue

with the Project.°”°

The Reversion Decree does not include, as the Claimant alleges, just vague references to a social
conflict. The preambular paragraphs of the Reversion Decree, in particular the eleventh and

twelfth paragraphs already cited at paragraph 553 above declares, on the one hand, that

“the pre ing and exploration activities of the Compafia Minera Mallku Khota
S.A. in the area of Mallku Khota and the communication process for the mining
project with the communities and ayllus have faced difficulties leading over recent
months to an lation of social conflicts, risking the lives of the lation in the
area and the company staff [....] as a result of the extreme social situation in the
Mallku_Khota_ area, and with the purpose of preserving the social peace and
guaranteeing the return to normalcy in the area, it becomes necessary for the
Government to intervene within the framework of the provisions under the New
Political Constitution of the State.” [Emphasis added]

 

The Claimant notes the absence of an express reference in the Reversion Decree to human rights
or to the protection of the indigenous communities seeing as that is the rational that the
Respondent invoked in this arbitration. The Tribunal disagrees that the lack of an express
reference results in the Reversion Decree not observing the requirement under the Treaty here

analyzed.

First, as the Tribunal has already indicated in the analysis of the facts of the case, there is no doubt
that there was a conflict that aggravated and led to serious acts of violence, whose occurrence is
accepted by both Parties. Second, the indigenous communities’ opposition to the Project is
established as well as significant shortcomings in the management of the community relations
programs that were identified by the Claimant’s own advisors.*! Third, it has been equally
established that the conflict existed with the communities and the ayllus, and that it caused acts

of violence, including death of people.*””

These are precisely the reasons invoked in the Reversion Decree. The difficulties generated with

the communities and the ayllus in the prospecting and exploration activities, and in the conduction

of the process of the communication of the Project; the escalation of social conflicts; the risk to

the life and the population in the area; and the need to preserve the peace and return to normalcy.

If the protection of life — the quintessential human right — and the need to return to normalcy in a
region with an indigenous population that is affected and altered by the Project emerge clearly as
motivations in the Reversion Decree, the Tribunal cannot understand that the mere absence of a
sacramental formula to expressly refer to human rights or to the protection of the communities
may lead to the conclusion that the Reversion was not conducted in a social benefit related to the
internal needs of Bolivia. In other words, the premises mentioned in the Reversion Decree as
causes for Reversion have been proven and such premises include the protection of human rights
— the right to life and the right to peace, both expressly mentioned in the Reversion Decree — and

the protection of the communities and the ayllus against the difficulties resulting from the Project.

The Tribunal is not convinced that, as the Claimant notes, it was a temporary security concern
that could have been remedied by the investor. On the one hand, it was not merely a security
concern. The facts which transpired and have been proven convince the Tribunal of the existence
of a serious social conflict that grew until it resulted in grave acts of violence, divisiveness at the
community level, marches, and attacks against life and personal integrity. On the other hand, these
were not sporadic clashes, rather a conflict that had been developing since at least late 2010 and
that, as already mentioned, escalated until it reached a breaking point toward mid-2012. In the
view of the Tribunal, the fact that the violence had continued in the weeks following the Reversion
does not show that this measure had been ineffective at pacifying the area, but, on the contrary, it
denotes that the situation affecting public order was the result of a serious and ongoing social

conflict.

In any event, the investor has not demonstrated that it could, as it now alleges, remedy the clashes,
or that the measures it claims to have adopted would have been sufficient to solve the problem.
On the contrary, the strategy CMMK adopted as of 2011, as already mentioned by the Tribunal,

appears to have contributed to the escalation of the conflict and ultimate acts of violence.

The Claimant complains that Bolivia had already declared its intention to expropriate, at least a
year before the conflict escalated,°” and that the real motive behind the expropriation was for
Bolivia to gain control of the Project upon realizing the size of the deposit once the PEA 2011

was made public.°*4

The Tribunal finds that the Claimant’s assertion is unsupported by the record. It is true that the
President of Bolivia referred to expropriation.’?> However, nothing establishes, nor even suggests,
that such a political statement was related to the public release of the PEA 2011, or that the
Respondent has used the social conflict or contributed to it as a pretext or a strategy to gain control
of the deposit. On the contrary, as the Tribunal has already mentioned, the existence of a conflict
as well as the shortcomings in CMMK’s management of the community relations, coupled with
the already-mentioned strategy adopted by CMMK as of 2011, were already evident from the

outset of the Project.

The social conflict and the situation of violence are undeniable given the evidence furnished, and
the Reversion Decree was issued for said reasons. Even if the conduct of some Bolivian officials
can be called into question, in particular the timing of their interventions to remedy the conflict
and the absence of higher-ranking officials at certain fundamental meetings, this does not mean
that the Reversion Decree was issued as a mere pretext nor that Bolivia has exercised its
discretionary power in an arbitrary or abusive manner. It is incumbent upon the investor to
demonstrate that the motivations invoked by the State in the Reversion Decree were not in
accordance with the facts on the ground or that they were arbitrary or abusive. In this case, not
only are said allegations unsupported, but the evidence on the record confirms the reasons invoked

by Bolivia behind its decision to reverse the Concessions.

The Claimant argues that the social conflict referred to in the Reversion Decree was initiated by
illegal miners and individuals interested in creating a cooperative to exploit the deposit, and that
it was Bolivia’s own actions and inactions that led to the situation mentioned in the Reversion
Decree.°”* In the analysis of the facts, the Tribunal has already referred to the allegation related

to illegal mining,”

and it refers to its findings in that regard. Likewise, in section VII.C.1 of this
award, the Tribunal refers to Bolivia’s conduct and its alleged actions and omissions, and the
Tribunal once again recalls its findings in that regard.°** Based on those findings, the Tribunal
concludes that the reasons offered by the Claimant explain neither the causes of the conflict nor

its escalation.

Next, the Tribunal will address the Claimant’s allegation according to which the expropriation

was neither a necessary nor proportionate measure to restore public order. The Claimant argues

that Bolivia had other options, including, for example, the appointment of a special commission,
the implementation of an emergency plan to improve the infrastructure and the services in the
area, or the militarization of the area.” It adds that press reports document that violent protests
were still occurring, and thus that the expropriation was not the solution to the social problem, as

Bolivia alleges.°”

The Claimant contends that the decision included in the Reversion Decree is disproportionate
considering, on the one hand, the true scope of the public order problem, which the Claimant does
not consider to be as serious as Bolivia does and, on the other hand, the immense value of the
deposit. Similarly, it notes that the measure adopted in the Reversion Decree was not the only one
available to Bolivia to resolve the situation, and it is incumbent upon Bolivia to establish that the

measure adopted was the only one possible.°*!

The Tribunal notes that Article 5 of the Treaty does not expressly refer to a proportionality
requirement as an element to establish the lawfulness of the expropriation. The Parties also do not
address whether the standard for the lawfulness of an expropriation requires the expropriatory
measure to be proportionate and, therefore, the Tribunal will not address this issue. In connection
with the Claimant’s allegation that the Reversion is disproportionate, the Tribunal finds that the
relevant elements with which to assess the proportionality of the measure are those found in the
record. First, as already mentioned by the Tribunal in several parts of the present award, the public
order issue was not a temporary concern, or an issue created by a few illegal miners, or a situation
created by a few objectors to the Project, or Bolivia’s strategy to gain control of the deposit, as
the Claimant alleges. The evidence of the situation in the area is conclusive that is was far from
being a minor or temporary concern.” Second, as discussed in chapter VII of the present award,
the Project was in a nascent stage and the PEA 2011 results, on which the Claimants bases the
size of the Project and the alleged damage, do not establish an impairment of the Claimant’s

investment beyond the amounts invested in the Project.

The Claimant suggests other measures that could have remedied the conflict in the area,” but it
does not explain how those measures, within the context of the facts, could have solved the
problem, and much less indicates or proves that such measures have been recommended or

discussed at the time of the conflict.

For example, would the creation of a special commission “insulated from political pressure” to
discuss with the communities and CMMK imply that neither CMMK nor the State of Bolivia
would be involved? Would it be a mixed commission comprising both Parties? The Claimant does
not elaborate on this alternative. As regards the proposed emergency measures to commit to
developing better infrastructure and services, this solution is based on the unsupported assumption
that the conflicts in the area stemmed from Bolivia’s failures in the provision of infrastructure and
services, and not from the Project. Regardless of who is held responsible for the events that led
to the conflict, it has not been shown, as the Claimant alleges, that the shortage of infrastructure
or services resulted in the conflict and the violent acts. As for the militarization of the area, the
Tribunal does not see how a solution of that sort is useful to placate a social conflict derived from
the alteration in the management of the structure and decision-making process of the communities
of the area and from the implementation of actions that sought to exert pressure on those who did
not support the Project and to provide support only to those within the communities that agreed

with CMMK.

The Claimant asserts that Bolivia solely organized meetings with CMMK and the communities
to seek a solution,*™ but that even at those meetings Bolivia had no intention of seeking a viable
solution and instead used the meetings to stoke anti-CMMK sentiment in the area and to seek the
expropriation, and that those meetings, in any event, were insufficient to address the concerns of

the communities and CMMK.°**

The evidence on record and, in particular but not exclusively, the witness statement of Governor
Gonzalez °* and the documents attached to the witness statement of Witness X, do not support
the Claimant’s allegations. Even if some officials may have missed some meetings or
coordination may have been lacking at some of the meetings, neither of those events is signficant
enough to sustain that Bolivia did not intend to seek a solution or that it used those meetings to

stoke anti-CMMK sentiment.

For one thing, it is clear that the Respondent, in particular through Governor Gonzalez, supported
the meetings and attempts to mediate, which culminated, inter alia, in the Agreement with the
Office of the Governor.**” Bolivia offered a suspension of the activities to placate the conflict,
which CMMK rejected, and Bolivia’s officials met on several occasions with the community

members and with CMMK to seek solutions to the conflict. It is not the task of the Tribunal to

speculate ex post facto and with a retroactive bias whether other measures could have been
implemented or whether the military intervention requested by the Claimant would have been

effective.

The divide created among the community members, aggravated by the strategy that CMMK
adopted in an attempt to strengthen those who the company believed to support the Project and to
weaken the objectors by various actions; the violence unleashed at the Acasio meeting on May
18, 2012 among the community members; the violence resulting from the detention of Kuraka
Cancio Rojas, in which CMMK’s strategy came into play;°* the organization of meetings without
the attendance of the objecting community members” contrary to the recommendations of the
advisors retained by CMMK; the march of the communities towards La Paz; the facts of July 5
and 6, 2012 whereby CMMK employees were held hostage and a community member lost his
life are not insignificant or isolated facts, as presented by the Claimant, but rather facts that reflect
a severe social conflict that did not seem to be temporary but, on the contrary, was escalating into

increasingly difficult situations.

Bolivia sought a dialogue,™°

proposed solutions, attempted to reach an agreement with the
community members,*! and finally issued the Reversion Decree in response to the general
violence, the social conflict - which based on the evidence was neither simply temporary nor
minor — making it clear that the risk existed that the conflict would continue for as long as CMMK
remained in the region. Having established the existence of the conflict, as well as its severity and
consequences, the Tribunal is unable to conclude that the measure adopted by Bolivia was
unnecessary or disproportionate and, much less, to speculate without any evidence on other

measures that could have been implemented to resolve the conflict.

Finally, the Tribunal does not share the Claimant’s view that the Reversion did not serve a social

benefit related to the internal needs of Bolivia because the Project would have brought millions

  

of dollars of investments to one of the poorest areas of Bolivia, and that neither the Government

nor the local communities have derived any benefit ever since the Reversion, and that the

benefit and expect the Tribunal to analyze compliance with this requirement from the point of
view of the returns that the Project would have generated for the community, ignoring the social,

cultural and political situation and the seriousness of the existing social conflict in the area.

ii. Was due process observed?

The Claimant asserts that through the decision contained in the Reversion Decree, the Respondent
breached the requirement of due process under the Treaty as one of the conditions for
expropriation. According to the Claimant, the obligation of Bolivia to grant an opportunity to the
investor to “assert its rights” includes granting an opportunity to participate in the expropriatory
decision and in the determination of the adequate level of compensation. °* However, the
Claimant alleges that Bolivia made the decision to expropriate at a series of meetings without the
Claimant being present and that the valuation process resulting from the Reversion Decree was
carried out unilaterally by COMIBOL, without the Claimant’s participation in the quantification

of compensation.**

The Respondent, in turn, states that the Treaty does not require the Contracting Party to consult
with the investor on the decision on expropriation, or to allow participation in the reversion
decision or in the establishment of compensation, but only provides that the Contracting Parties
— Bolivia and the United Kingdom — must make legal recourse available for the investor to
challenge the legality of the measure and the amount of the compensation established.” In other
words, the due process under the Treaty is guaranteed by allowing the investor to legally challenge
the decision to expropriate and the amount of compensation after the decision to expropriate is

taken by the State and not prior to the decision being taken.

Article 5 of the Treaty provides that “[t]he national or company affected shall have the right to
establish promptly by due process of law in the territory of the Contracting Party making the

expropriation, the legality of the expropriation and the amount of the compensation in accordance

with the principle set out in this paragraph.” [Emphasis added]

The text of the Treaty does not support the Claimant’s position. The verbs governing the conduct
of expropriation suggest that it is the “affected” investor of a Contracting Party that “makes” the
expropriation who must challenge the “legality” of the expropriation, i.e. the question concerns a

challenge to a decision that has already been taken and not participation in the decision-making

process. In the context of an expropriation, and what due process under the Treaty requires is that
the foreign investors have timely access to a legal proceeding in the territory of the host State of
the investment which allows them to question the legality of the expropriation and the amount of

the compensation, but not to participate in the making of the sovereign decision to expropriate.

Neither the context of the Treaty nor its object and purpose support the Claimant’s position that,
in any event, only rises to the level of arguing that it should have been invited to the meetings
where the expropriation was decided and to participate in the process advanced by COMIBOL to
establish compensation. The Treaty does not forbid the Contracting Parties from expropriating.
Rather, it imposes certain conditions on an expropriation, which if disregarded will result in the
international responsibility of the State. That is, the Treaty preserves the State’s sovereign right
to expropriate subject to certain specific conditions. The Treaty does not make that State
prerogative conditional on the investor’s participation in the issuance of the act that formalizes
the expropriation, nor does the Claimant explain — aside from a reading of Article 5 that the
Tribunal does not share, as already noted in paragraph 582 above — why the investor’s right to
specifically establish “by due process of law” the legality of the investment and the amount of

compensation involves a participation in the sovereign exercise of a State prerogative.

Such a result does not arise from the object and purpose of the Treaty, and the Claimant does not
allege or substantiate that the effective protection of the investment under the Treaty requires
participation to the investor in the sovereign decision to expropriate. Nothing in the Treaty
mandates a Contracting Party, as the Claimant argues, to establish “legal recourse” to call into

question the “legality” of a decision that has not yet been made.

Finally, the Tribunal notes that the Claimant did not resort to any legal proceeding to challenge
the legality of the Reversion under the laws of the Respondent, but instead chose to submit an
international arbitral claim that resulted in this arbitration. If the Claimant considered that the
corresponding legal proceeding was not a viable option, or that it was not going to be afforded
impartial treatment or, in the end, that it was a futile exercise, it cannot allege lack of due process
based solely on its decision not to pursue the legal remedies available under the laws of Bolivia
without proving the circumstance that would make the legal proceeding futile or impossible. The
exercise of legal actions in Bolivia to challenge the lawfulness of the Reversion Decree is not a
precondition to pursue arbitration. However, the Claimant cannot claim a violation of due process
when it decided not to exercise the remedies available under the national law of Bolivia. In fact,
the Claimant never alleged that such remedies were unavailable or that they did not comply with

the due process guarantee.

586. Consequently, the Tribunal considers that the expropriation complied with the Treaty requirement

of due process.

tii. Was the obligation to compensate observed?

587. In relation to compensation, Article 5 of the Treaty establishes as one of the conditions that

expropriation should be

against just and effective compensation. Such compensation shall amount to the
market value of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation or
before the impending expropriation became public knowledge, whichever is the
earlier, shall include interest at a normal commercial or legal rate, whichever is
applicable in the territory of the expropriating Contracting Party, until the date of
payment, shall be made without delay, be effectively realizable and be freely
transferable.

589. The evidence presented in this arbitration by the Parties establishes the following:

(a) Under the Reversion Decree, COMIBOL “shall hire the services of an independent firm to
carry out a valuation of the investments made by Compajiia Minera Mallku Khota S.A. and
Exploraciones Mineras Santa Cruz Ltda. EMICRUZ LTDA, within a period not to exceed
one hundred and twenty (120) business days.”°*’ The Reversion Decree further states that
based on the findings of such valuation, “COMIBOL shall define the amount and conditions
under which the Government of Bolivia shall recognize the investments made by Compania
Minera Mallku Khota S.A. and Exploraciones Mineras Santa Cruz Ltda. EMICRUZ
LTDA”™".

(b) By letter of August 24, 2012, COMIBOL invited the Claimant to a meeting “in order to
hand over all of the relevant documents related to the development of the activities” at the
Malku Khota mining deposit. Based on the invitation, the meeting would take place on

August 28, 2012.

(c) On September 4, 2012, the Claimant responded to COMIBOL stating that the invitation to
attend the meeting had been delivered to the offices of CMMK in La Paz on August 27,

pleased to discuss the COMIBOL proposal and respectfully request that a meeting be

arranged on a date in the near future that is mutually acceptable to both parties.” ij

On October 24, 2012, SAS served notice of the dispute on the Respondent.**!

the valuation of the investments made by Compajfifa Minera Mallku Khota S.A. and

By letter dated December 12, 2012, SAS expressed its willingness to hold meetings with
representatives of the Government of Bolivia “with the purpose of achieving a legal and
amicable settlement to this dispute within the six-month period provided in Article 8(1) of
the UK Treaty.”°** The Claimant sent Bolivia two similar communications on January 16

and February 15, 2013.°°5

On February 21, 2013, the Office of the Attorney General of the State invited SAS to a
“meeting in order to reach amicable alternatives under the provisions of Supreme Decree

No. 1308 [...].”°*° The meeting would take place on April 17, 2013.

On April 17, 2013, two members of SAS’ legal team in Bolivia met in La Paz with several

Metallurgy and the President of COMIBOL, with the purpose of discussing a potential

PCA Case No. 2013-15
Award

At the meeting SAS’ legal counsel in Bolivia was informed that the failure to hire a
valuation company was supposedly due to the fact that CMMK had not provided all of the
technical information that COMIBOL had requested on the Project. In this regard, in a
letter dated April 24, 2013 in connection with the aforementioned meeting, SAS reiterated
that much of the information on the Project was highly confidential and proprietary, and
that there was publicly available information that Bolivia could use for valuation
purposes. °*? Consequently, SAS requested that Bolivia “comply with its obligation to
engage a valuation expert and provide us with a compensation offer.”° Likewise, it stated
that “[w]hile South American Silver intends to pursue its claims in arbitration, we also
want to make clear that we intend to continue discussions with the State with the hope of

reaching an amicable resolution.”*°'

COMIBOL reviewed the terms of reference and published a new request, which was

annulled on March 31, 2014 due to technical errors.”

COMIBOL then issued new terms of reference that were sent directly to two companies

that submitted proposals on April 7, 2014.°°

COMIBOL granted the valuation contract to the company Quality Audit Consultores y
Contadores Ptiblicos S.R.L., on April 23, 2014; the corresponding contract was entered on

May 8, 2014, and, on June 27, 2014, the valuation report was submitted.°*

The Tribunal has already concluded that the Respondent has complied with the requirements

under Article 5 of the Treaty relating to public purpose and social benefit causes as well as due

process. The question now is whether failure to pay compensation before the initiation of the

arbitration and failure to make any payment to date constitute a violation of the Treaty.

The Claimant complains, on the one hand, that Bolivia has neither paid nor offered any

compensation to date and, on the other hand, even if Bolivia had effectively quantified and paid

the sums invested in connection with the Project, such a payment would still be insufficient to

satisfy the obligation to compensate pursuant to Article 5 of the Treaty, which requires that

compensation shall amount to the market value of the investment expropriated immediately
before the expropriation or before the impending expropriation became public knowledge,

whichever is earlier.°®

According to the Claimant, the valuation and the corresponding payment of compensation are an
obligation that predates the arbitration, which determines the legality of the expropriation. The
compensation cannot be a consequence of the arbitral proceeding — the Claimant asserts — because
if it was, “States would no longer have any incentive to provide prompt, adequate, and effective

compensation to the expropriated investor at all.”°%

Pursuant to the Claimant, lack of compensation is in itself sufficient “to establish the
expropriation’s unlawful nature in light of both the Treaty and international law.”°* In turn, the
Respondent argues that “the lack of compensation does not make the expropriation per se illegal
dispossession, regardless of the time elapsed from the expropriation,” and that the unlawfulness
of an expropriation where there has been no compensation shall be determined upon consideration

of the facts.*

The dispute between the Parties in this case reflects the different approaches that the arbitral
tribunals and scholars have had in connection with the failure to pay compensation for

expropriation. There is no clear or uniform answer.

Some decisions and commentaries suggest that the non-payment of compensation, regardless of
the circumstances, makes a taking ipso facto unlawful, whereas other decisions and commentaries
point out that non-payment of compensation does not entail an ipso facto violation of international

law.97

The Tribunal finds, and the Parties do not seem to dispute, that a direct expropriation entails,
under the Treaty, the obligation of the State to provide compensation to the expropriated investor,
generally-speaking the owner of the expropriated asset or the holder of the expropriated right.

However, the Tribunal does not find support for the Claimant’s assertion that the payment of

compensation is a kind of condition precedent to arbitration.°”! It is not a question of simply
verifying whether payment was made or not. Rather, it is necessary, on the one hand, to take into
account the substance of the international obligation of the State to compensate under the
corresponding international instrument — the Treaty in this case — and, on the other hand, the

circumstances that led to the non-payment.*””

As the Tribunal has already noted, the Claimant alleges, first, that Bolivia breached the Treaty
because it has yet to pay or even offer any compensation. According to the Claimant,

compensation should be provided without delay, °”

i.e. compensation should be provided
contemporaneously with the expropriation and as quickly as possible, or at least within a
reasonable period of time.°’* Consequently, the State would breach the above-mentioned
promptness requirement when the investor has not received any compensation “several months”

after the effective taking.°”

The Respondent, in turn, considers that the appropriate steps were promptly taken for payment,
and the corresponding hiring was ordered and done,°” such that once the Claimant opted to
pursue arbitration and the Respondent accepted that it would be the tribunal the one establishing

compensation, Bolivia cannot be alleged to have breached its Treaty obligations.°””

The Treaty does not establish a deadline for the payment of compensation. It establishes that it
has to be provided promptly, without delay. In connection with the meaning of “prompt”
compensation “without delay,” both Parties invoke, to different ends, the text of L.B. Sohn & R.R.
Baxter to the effect that, while no hard and fast rule may be laid down for promptness, the passage
of several months after the taking without the furnishing by the State of any real indication that
compensation would be forthcoming would raise serious doubts that the State intended to make

prompt compensation.” Bolivia emphasizes the existence of an “indication” that compensation

600. The Respondent argues that to establish the lawfulness of the Reversion, the Tribunal should
consider “(i) the provision of compensation under the Reversion Decree, (ii) the negotiations
between Bolivia and SAS to reach an agreement, both before and after the Reversion, and (iii) the

award to an independent company of CMMK’s investment valuation.”**!

   

601. Itis true that the Reversion Decree provided for compensation to CMMK in the amount and under
the payment conditions to be established based on the outcome of the valuation of CMMK’s
investments.” It is also true that Bolivia awarded the valuation contract to an independent third
party.°** However, the Tribunal considers that it is insufficient to a that a provision exists
which states that payment shall be provided based on an investment valuation by a third party.

with an obligation that only arose afterwards.

In its Rejoinder, the Respondent alleged — for the first time in the arbitration — that insofar as SAS
had opted to pursue international arbitration and have the Tribunal establish whether there was an
expropriation and to determine the amount of compensation, Bolivia complied with its obligation

to compensate without delay by participating in the arbitral proceeding.**°

This argument by the Respondent is not only late but also contradicts prior actions by the State.
In fact, Bolivia (i) recognized that it had to provide compensation under the Reversion Decree;
(ii) continued with the hiring process of the valuation company, even after the Claimant had
initiated this proceeding through the Notice of Arbitration; (iii) defended Reversion as a legal

expropriation; and (iv) at least until the presentation of its Counter-Memorial, maintained that it

foregoing, the Tribunal cannot accept the Respondent’s position that its participation in this

arbitration fulfills the compensation requirement established under the Treaty.

Based on the above reasons, the Tribunal concludes that, although the Reversion fulfills the
requirements under Article 5 of the Treaty relating to public purpose and social benefit, as well as

due process, it does not fulfill the compensation requirement established under the same article.

(b) On the alleged state of necessity

Regarding the state of necessity, the Parties do not seem to dispute that its substance is reflected

in Article 25 of the Articles on State Responsibility, which reads:

1. Necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding the

a) is the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and

b) does not seriously impair an essential interest of the State or States towards which
the obligation exists, or of the international community as a whole.

2. In any case, necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding
wrongfulness if:

a) the international obligation in question excludes the possibility of invoking

614. Finally, commentary number 14 notes that State practice and judicial decisions support the view
that necessity may constitute a circumstance precluding wrongfulness under certain very limited
conditions. The cases show that necessity has been invoked to preclude the wrongfulness of acts

contrary to a broad range of obligations, whether customary or conventional in origin.°*

615. In legal authority CLA-202, submitted to the record by the Claimant, Professor August Reinisch

explains that the state of necessity excuses a wrongful act of a State, where that State has breached

995

an obligation.” The tribunals and other legal authorities cited by the Parties evince a similar

opinion.”°

616. Based on the foregoing, an essential prerequisite for the application of the state of necessity is the
existence of an act by the State that constitutes an international wrong, and that such act is the
only means that the State has to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril.
This is so established by Article 25 when providing that the State may invoke the necessity as
“the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril

is... not to comply with another international obligation.” (Emphasis added)

617. In the case before this Tribunal, this means that the Respondent could invoke a state of necessity

to excuse the breach of the Treaty.

618. The Respondent invoked the state of necessity in its Rejoinder Memorial to justify the Reversion
of the Mining Concessions if the Tribunal were to find that the Reversion breached the Treaty.

According to Bolivia, this “was a necessary measure to protect a fundamental interest, such as

9° RLA-159, United Nations International Law Commission, Draft articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally
Wrongful Acts, with commentaries 2001. (“(14) On balance, State practice and judicial decisions support the view that necessity
may constitute a circumstance precluding wrongfulness under certain very limited conditions, and this view is embodied in
article 25. The cases show that necessity has been invoked to preclude the wrongfulness of acts contrary to a broad range of
obligations, whether customary or conventional in origin. It has been invoked to protect a wide variety of interests, including
safeguarding the environment, preserving the very existence of the State and its people in time of public emergency, or ensuring
the safety of a civilian population. But stringent conditions are imposed before any such plea is allowed. This is reflected in
article 25. In particular, to emphasize the exceptional nature of necessity and concerns about its possible abuse, article 25 is
cast in negative language (‘Necessity may not be invoked ... unless’). In this respect it mirrors the language of article 62 of the
1969 Vienna Convention dealing with fundamental change of circum: It also mirrors that language in establishing, in
paragraph 1, two conditions without which necessity may not be invoked and excluding, in paragraph 2, two situations entirely
from the scope of the excuse of necessity.” [footnotes omitted])

human and indigenous rights, of the grave and imminent peril posed by the continuity of CMMK,

without any other equivalent interest being affected.”°”"

The Tribunal has already concluded that the Reve:

 

sion (i) constitutes a direct expropriation under
the Treaty, and (ii) complies with the requirements thereby established regarding the public
purpose and social benefit cause related to the internal needs of the State of Bolivia, as well as
due process. The Tribunal has also concluded, on the basis of the materials put forward in this
arbitration, that the Reversion was a proportionate measure. The only obligation under Article 5
of the Treaty which the Tribunal has found to have been breached was the obligation to provide

compensation.

It is clear that Bolivia’s state-of-necessity defense was not designed to excuse the non-payment
of compensation for the expropriation, nor could it, since the invocation of this defense does not
preclude the payment of compensation by the State for the damages effectively resulting from

acts attributable to it.°*

Based on the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal dismisses the state of necessity defense invoked by

Bolivia in its Rejoinder Memorial.

(c) On the alleged police powers

Regarding Bolivia’s allegation - ee
Ee — that the Reversion constituted the legitimate exercise of police
powers and not an expropriation, the Tribunal finds that not only is there no evidence to support
this defense, but that Bolivia’s conduct prior to and throughout this arbitration leads to the

opposite conclusion.

It is true, as Bolivia asserts, that several arbitral tribunals have accepted that compensation
provisions under the treaties are inapplicable to measures adopted in the State’s sovereign exercise

of its police powers.” Similarly, several of the tribunals cited by Bolivia in its Rejoinder have

 

analyzed situations in which the States have issued regulations in exercise of their police powers

and have concluded that, in such circumstances, compensation for the investor does not apply.

This is the reasoning behind Bolivia’s argument that compensation would not apply.

624. Bolivia’s acts prior to the issuance of the Decree, the text of the Decree, Bolivia’s position on its
Counter-Memorial, and the evidence submitted therewith, lead the Tribunal to conclude that the
Respondent understood at all times that it was a direct expropriation and that compensation was
owed, and it was only with the presentation of its Rejoinder that Bolivia decided to assert a defense

on the basis of the exercise of police powers.

625. The evidence on record establishes that, given the considerations of public order and social unrest,
Bolivia initially considered the possibility of creating a company with both public and private
shareholding.' Later on, several authorities of Bolivia, including the President himself, referred
to the need to expropriate the Mining Concessions.'”! There is no evidence on record, nor does
Bolivia cite it in its Rejoinder, that the Respondent’s authorities understood that they were
exercising police powers, rather than taking measures to expropriate the Concessions. Article 4(1)
of the Reversion Decree undeniably refers to the way in which Bolivia will estimate and provide
compensation for the reversion, providing that COMIBOL shall “hire the services of an
independent firm to carry out a valuation of the investments” and on the basis of such valuation
“COMIBOL shall define the amount and conditions under which the Government of Bolivia shall
recognize the investments made.” Additionally, the Decree orders COMIBOL to add the amount

to its budget in order to proceed with the corresponding payment.

626. As Bolivia itself asserts, after the issuance of the Decree, measures were adopted to hire the
services of an independent company to value the investments;'”” terms of reference were issued
for the valuation; the company Quality Audit Consultores y Contadores Ptiblicos S.R.L. was

hired to perform the valuation and the valuation report was received from the company;!° and

1005

negotiations were held with the Claimant before and after the Reversion, '°” which Bolivia has

characterized as reflecting a clear willingness to “comply with its obligation to compensate.” °°

627. In its Counter-Memorial, Bolivia performed, based on Article 5 of the Treaty, an analysis of each

of the requirements included therein to establish that the expropriation was not illegal as it

complied with all of the requirements under the article.” While Bolivia refers to the Reversion
as having a public purpose and social benefit, it does so with a view to establishing compliance
with the Treaty requirements for an expropriation, as mentioned above. Bolivia did not refer in
any part of its Counter-Memorial to exercising police powers and, much less, to compensation

being inapplicable due to the Reversion arising from the exercise of such powers.

On the contrary, Bolivia devotes a significant part of its Counter-Memorial to asserting that it
fulfilled its obligation to compensate under the Treaty and to alleging that it was always willing

to compensate the Claimant in compliance with the above-mentioned Article 5.

Although in its Rejoinder Bolivia simply states that it offered to provide compensation without

being compelled to do so,!0°*

it does not explain why, absent such obligation, it not only included
the compensation in the Reversion Decree but also proceeded with the measures to hire a valuator.
The Respondent itself states that the Reversion Decree has a presumption of legality. The selfsame
State may not, by means of a belated allegation, disavow its own act by arguing that payment of

compensation, as established under the Reversion Decree, is not required.

Based on the above reasoning, the Tribunal rejects the defense presented by Bolivia in its

Rejoinder in connection with the alleged exercise of its police powers.

THE OTHER CLAIMS OF THE CLAIMANT

In addition to its expropriation claim, the Claimant raised four other claims under the Treaty which
are substantially based on the same facts as its expropriation claim. In fact, the Claimant alleges
that Bolivia: (i) failed to treat its investments fairly and equitably; (ii) failed to afford full
protection and security to its investments; (iii) impaired its investments through unreasonable and
discriminatory measures; and (iv) treated its investments less favorably than investments of its

own investors.!” Below the Tribunal will analyze each of these allegations.

PCA Case No. 2013-15
Award

1. The claim for fair and equitable treatment
(a) The Claimant’s Position

632. The Claimant contends that Bolivia, through its actions and omissions, violated the standard of
fair and equitable treatment, as it (i) frustrated its legitimate expectations, and (ii) did not act in

good faith or in a transparent and consistent manner.

(i) Bolivia frustrated the Claimant’s legitimate expectations

633. Referring to several arbitral awards, the Claimant asserts that safeguarding the investor’s
legitimate expectations is a component of fair and equitable treatment. '°! Safeguarding
legitimate expectations requires the State to guarantee the stability of the legal and business
framework and to act “consistently, i.e. without arbitrarily revoking any preexisting decisions or
permits issued [...] that were relied upon by the investor to assume its commitments as well as to
plan and launch its commercial and business activities” .'°'' The Claimant submits that this is the
correct interpretation of Article 2(2) of the Treaty, which refers to fair and equitable treatment,
rather than “the mini i ional standard of under yi l

law” 1012

634. The Claimant invested in the Project based on the reiterated “expressions of support’ by the
Government of Bolivia, and the legal framework of Bolivia, which afforded protection to foreign
investments, the investor’s property, and the rights associated with the Mining Concessions.
Relying on this, the Claimant “formed legitimate expectations regarding the key protections to

their investment’ .'°%

However, Bolivia deliberately undermined the rights over the Mining
Concessions as it allowed the conflict and opposition to CMMK to escalate, and decided to
expropriate these concessions without paying any form of compensation, violating the stability of
the legal framework, and frustrating the Claimant’s legitimate expectations.'°'t The Claimant
explains that “it is Bolivia’s utter failure to protect the Mining Concessions [...], that violated
>> 101s

Claimant’s legitimate expectations”, and that, even if Reversion resulted out of concern for

the protection of human rights and the rights of the indigenous communities, there is no reason

why Bolivia’s obligation “to protect indigenous communities necessarily relieved it of its

obligations vis-a-vis [SAS] pursuant to the [Treaty]”. '°'°

(ii) Bolivia failed to act in good faith or in a transparent and consistent manner

635. The Claimant asserts that the fair and equitable treatment standard requires States to act in good
faith and to afford investments transparent and consist treatment. '°!’ However, in light of the facts
detailed below, the Claimant submits that Bolivia failed to act in accordance with these

obligations:
(a) Bolivia was planning the Reversion since 2011;'°!*

(b) Bolivia implemented the Immobilization Zone to preclude the expansion of CMMK’s
1019

mining coverage;
(c) The root of the problem was illegal gold mining. However, Bolivia staked the social conflict
in Malku Khota, fostering and protecting opposition to CMMK, as a pretext to expropriate

the Claimant’s investment and take control of the deposit; !°

1021

(d) Bolivia excluded the Claimant from the process of approving the Reversion; '°*! and

(e) In May 2012, Bolivia declared that the Project was lawful, and, in August 2012, Bolivia

adopted the Reversion and failed to pay any compensation. '°*

636. The Claimant contends that these facts are sufficient to conclude bad faith and the lack of

transparency and consistency in Bolivia’s conduct.!°>

(b) The Respondent’s Position

637. The Respondent denies that it has violated the standard of fair and equitable treatment articulated

by the Claimant, as Bolivia (i) respected at all times SAS’ legitimate expectations; and (ii) acted

in conformity with the principle of good faith, in a manner that is transparent and consistent with

its international obligations.

(i) Bolivia respected the Claimant’s legitimate expectations

The Respondent argues that the standard of fair and equitable treatment provided for in
Article 2(2) of the Treaty “grants the investor the protections of international law —and nothing
else”.'4 The Respondent agrees that the investor’s legitimate expectations form part of fair and
equitable treatment, but rejects that these expectations may per se constitute the only basis for a

claim related to the breach of fair and equitable treatment. '°75

The Respondent contends that the investor’s legitimate expectations do not imply the
“immutability of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the investment, nor do they
prevent the State from legislating and guaranteeing the application and observance of its laws in
its territory”.'°* In the absence of a specific commitment by the State not to modify its legal
framework, '”’ the fair and equitable treatment standard only protects the investor’s legitimate
expectations against (i) arbitrary changes of the legal framework applicable to the investment, '°*
and (ii) the egregious or manifestly abusive conduct of the State.!°” The Respondent asserts that
the foregoing applies to the fair and equitable standard as well as to the minimum level of

treatment under international customary law.!°°

In the present case, the Respondent considers evident that there was no violation of fair and
equitable treatment as Bolivia did not modify, but rather limited itself to applying, the legal
framework applicable to the Mining Concessions. '°! This legal framework included the
principles that govern mining activities of the natural resources of Bolivia, as well as domestic
and international provisions that mandate Bolivia to protect human rights and the rights of

indigenous communities. '°?

Given that knowledge of the legal and regulatory framework
applicable to the investor’s investment is a sine qua non condition for the protection of its

legitimate expectations, the Claimant had to be aware of the existence of such provisions and

“was fully aware that if it failed to respect the Indigenous Communities, the Government of Bolivia

would act accordingly”.'°* Thus, the “legitimate expectations [of the Claimant] necessarily

included Bolivia’s obligation to protect human rights and the rights of indigenous peoples,” which

is precisely what Bolivia did through the Reversion.

1034

(ii) Bolivia acted in good faith, transparently and consistently

The Respondent contends that SAS’ allegations are plagued with “multiple inaccuracies” and

they are insufficient to establish the violation of the principle of good faith under international

law.'°*5 In particular, the Respondent notes that:

(e)

In 2011, Bolivia was already receiving requests from the Indigenous Communities to expel

CMMK, but Bolivia “always maintained its support for [CMMK]”.!°%°

The Immobilization Zone is a “simple demarcation of an area whose exploitation
corresponds to COMIBOL for business purposes, as established by law,” in compliance
with Bolivia’s policy in force since 2006. Moreover, immobilization zones were established
in 18 different areas, making it impossible to determine whether this policy was

implemented against CMMK.'°"

The only motivation behind the Reversion, and the sole cause of the social conflict was the
violence and violations of human rights and the rights of indigenous peoples by CMMK. 08

The Respondent notes that the Project was never affected by illegal gold mining.'°”

Bolivia asked CMMK to attend several meetings to “reach agreements that would allow

CMMK to continue the Project development” 1°"

Bolivia’s legal framework allowed for the Reversion before August 2012, and Bolivia

 

initiated the valuation process in accordance with the Reversion Decree, thus beginning the

  

compensatory process. '°4!

(c) The Tribunal’s Analysis

642. The Claimant argues that Bolivia violated the fair and equitable treatment standard under Article

2(2) of the Treaty, since (i) it failed to protect SAS’ legitimate expectations and to guarantee the
existence of a stable legal and business framework in connection with its investment!” and,

additionally, (ii) it failed to act in good faith and in a transparent and predictable manner. '**

643. The Respondent rejects SAS’ accusations and, in its defense, argues that (i) the Claimant should

have legitimately expected that Bolivia would protect its natural resources and the Indigenous

1044 and (ii) Bolivia

Communities in accordance with its national and international obligations,
acted in good faith and treated the Claimant’s investment in a transparent and consistent

manner. '“>

644. Article 2(2) of the Treaty provides that “investments of nationals or companies of each

Contracting Party shall at all times be afforded fair and equitable treatment [...] in the territory
of the other Contracting Party.” As is frequently done in investment treaties, the Treaty establishes
the obligation of the host State to afford fair and equitable treatment to the protected investments,

without establishing the elements comprising the standard.

645. However, in this case, the Parties do not dispute that, for the purposes of the analysis and the

decision of this Tribunal, the obligation of the State to afford fair and equitable treatment to
foreign investments implies acting in a transparent and consistent manner. Neither do they dispute
that the investor’s legitimate expectations are part of the fair and equitable treatment standard.
Nor do they dispute the relationship between legitimate expectations and the legal framework in

the host State of the investment.'™® All told, the Parties differ as to the expectations to be protected

under the Treaty '°” and as to how the standard should be applied to the facts of the case.'™*

646. Based on the above, the Tribunal will start by examining to the standard of protection of legitimate

expectations and subsequently examine the factual allegations underlying the present claim,
including the actions that the Claimant considers contrary to good faith, transparency, and

predictability.

647. Despite differences in approach, international investment tribunals have outlined the requirements
underlying which investor expectations are to be afforded protection under investment treaties.
The Tribunal considers relevant to highlight the two requirements that are relevant for the

resolution of the dispute before it.

648. First, several international investment tribunals have established that the investor is entitled to
protection of its legitimate expectations provided (i) that it exercised due diligence, and (ii) that
its legitimate expectations were reasonable in light of the circumstances.'“? The circumstances
to be taken into consideration by the investor are not merely legal in nature, but they should also
include the social, cultural, and economic environment of the host State of the investment,
amongst other factors. According to the Duke Energy v. Ecuador tribunal, “[t]he assessment of
the reasonableness or legitimacy [of the investor’s expectations] must take into account all

circumstances, including not only the facts surrounding the investment, but also the political,

socioeconomic, cultural and historical conditions prevailing in the host State.”\°°°

649. Second, international investment tribunals have also recognized that the commitment of the State
to afford fair and equitable treatment to foreign investments does not entail relinquishing their
regulatory powers in the public interest or the need to adapt their legislation to changes and
emerging needs. '°*' As stated by the Copper Mesa v. Ecuador tribunal, under the fair and
equitable treatment standard, there is a weighing of the legitimate interests of the foreign investor
with the legitimate interests of the host State and others, including (in particular) its own citizens

and residents. !°?

650. While tribunals have referred to the conditions under which the legal and economic framework

1053

may be altered without violating the fair and equitable treatment standar in this particular

Award

case the issue is not a change to the general legal and economic framework, or a change to the
legal framework for a specific economic sector, but rather the specific actions of the Claimant and

its controlled company, CMMK, vis-a-vis the Respondent.

Next, the Tribunal will evaluate the claim put forward by the Claimant based on the criteria

established above.

The Claimant claims to have formed legitimate expectations regarding the key protections
afforded to their investments in Malku Khota and the stability of Bolivia’s legal and business
framework based on the laws of Bolivia in force at the time of its investment, and the “repeated
and specific expressions of support” it received from the Government since the investment was
made until mid-2011.'° Likewise, it asserts that Bolivia ceased to protect its legitimate
expectations and to guarantee the existence of a stable legal and business framework in connection
with its investments “[b]y deliberately undermining the exercise by [SAS] of CMMK’s rights over
the Mining Ce ions and by ulti ly nationalizing these c i without offering or

 

paying any form of compensation.” °°

Except for the issuance of the Reversion Decree, the Claimant has not alleged that Bolivia had
introduced any general regulatory change or any change in the mining sector that impaired the
rights on the Mining Concessions after SAS’ investment. It has not explained exactly which
legitimate expectations were frustrated due to conduct attributable to the State, or which of
Bolivia's specific acts violated those legitimate expectations. In general terms, its allegation of
the violation of legitimate expectations seems to be exclusively based on the fact that the State
decided to revert the Mining Concessions. That is, it would be the issuance of the Reversion
Decree that violated the Claimant’s legitimate expectations. Based on the reasons that follow, the
Tribunal considers that the Reversion did not violate the fair and equitable treatment standard and,
in particular, did not violate the expectations that, given the circumstances of the case, could be

considered legitimate.

As the Tribunal previously noted, it is undisputed that the State may legally expropriate the
investments made by an investor of the other Contracting Party under the Treaty, provided that
the requirements under Article 5 are met.'°° Certainly, Bolivia did not relinquish this power, nor
did it commit to unconditionally maintaining untouched SAS’ or CMMK’s rights over the Mining

Concessions.

PCA Case No. 2013-15
Award

As previously noted, the Tribunal should assess the legitimacy and reasonableness of the
investor’s expectations, taking account of all the circumstances of the case and the investor’s
conduct. In this case, the Claimant knew, or should have known, that CMMK operated in an area
inhabited by indigenous communities, under specific political, social, cultural, and economic
conditions. '°°7 CMMK’s own advisors, as the Tribunal has already mentioned, warned of this
situation and recommended that certain measures be taken for the development of the Project. On
the one hand, this implies that SAS, through CMMK, should develop the Project based on the
special characteristics of the place where it operated. On the other hand, this supposes that Bolivia
had a heightened duty of protection and oversight regarding the communities that inhabit the

Project area.

The Tribunal has found that CMMK’s conduct contributed to the social conflict and that, even if
its conduct had not had such an impact on the origin of the conflict, its actions during the conflict
contributed to aggravating it by generating divisiveness and escalating the clashes within the
indigenous communities.'°** Likewise, the Tribunal also found that the Reversion was enacted for
the purpose established in the Reversion Decree — to end the social conflict in the Project area —
rather than other economic interests of the State, as the Claimant has alleged. !°° The grave social
conflict in the Project area is a supervening situation, generated in part by the Company’s conduct,
against which the State had to take action to restore public order and thus protect the life and

integrity of the population in the area and CMMK’s employees.

Upon analyzing the expropriation claim, the Tribunal has concluded that, except for the
requirement to provide compensation, the Reversion complied with the Treaty. As a matter of fact,
and contrary to the Claimant’s allegations, the Tribunal found that the reversion had a public

purpose and was for a social benefit,!° and it complied with due process. !°!

The Claimant has not invoked additional reasons for this Tribunal to conclude that an
expropriatory measure in accordance with the public purpose and due process requirements is, in
this particular case, contrary to the obligation to afford fair and equitable treatment under Article
2(2) of the Treaty. Therefore, the Tribunal refers back to its findings in section VII.B of this award

which are applicable to the factual allegations also presented by the Claimant as the basis for its

1058 See supra pi

505, 507.

Award

claim for the alleged violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard, and concludes that the

Reversion was not contrary to that standard.

659. However, the Claimant alleges that Bolivia’s actions preceding Reversion also violated the fair

and equitable treatment standard. In general, the Claimant argues that Bolivia publicly and
deliberately undermined its ownership rights over the Mining Concessions, stoked opposition to
the Project and the Company, and allowed the conflict in Malku Khota to escalate. '°? The

Tribunal will now examine these allegations.

660. The Claimant alleges that Bolivia breached the fair and equitable treatment standard by ordering

the immobilization of the area surrounding the Project in accordance with Resolution DGAJ-
0073/2011 issued by COMIBOL on April 26, 2011. This designation would have had the effect
of precluding SAS from freely expanding the Project or expanding the footprint of the planned

mine and, additionally, it was supposedly an early indication of Bolivia’s expropriatory intent. !°

661. The Tribunal does not consider that the implementation of the Immobilization Zone constitutes a

violation of the duty incumbent on the State to afford fair and equitable treatment to SAS’

investments.

662. It is uncontested that the Immobilization Zone corresponds to an area different from the Mining

Concessions, over which neither SAS nor CMMK had acquired rights.'° It is also uncontested
that the exploitation and management of this area was assigned to COMIBOL since 2007.!%
Therefore, the issuance of Resolution DGAJ-0073/2011 of April 2011 and its reference to the
discovery of a silver deposit in Northern Potosi by CMMK does not imply the infringement of
SAS’ or CMMK’s rights on the Mining Concessions, nor does it reveal an “expropriatory

intention” of the State, which acted in the legitimate exercise of its powers.

663. As previously noted, neither the Claimant nor CMMK had acquired rights over this area, and even

assuming that they had an interest or plans to expand the Project area or the mine footprint — as

SAS now suggests !°°

— there is no contemporaneous evidence on the record that they had
communicated their intentions to the Government and that the Government had made a

commitment in this regard. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude that this action frustrated a

legitimate expectation of the Claimant or represented an inconsistent or arbitrary exercise of the

powers of the State.

As previously noted, even if the Tribunal considers that there were circumstances in which some
officials of Bolivia might have had a greater degree of presence and control in some instances,
the Tribunal does not find that Bolivia stoked the opposition to the Project to gain control of the
Mining Concessions or that the escalation of the conflict in the area was attributable to the conduct

of the State.

The Claimant does not deny that Bolivia initiated actions to resolve the conflict generated within
the community members in the Project area. However, the Claimant suggests that such actions
were really designed to undermine SAS’ rights over the Mining Concessions. According to the
Claimant, officials of Bolivia excluded the Company from the meetings with the community;
communicated to the indigenous communities that they disagreed with the Project; demanded a
stake in the Project; urged the Company to cease operations; and did not deploy the armed forces

to the area in an effort to control the violence. '°°7

The Tribunal finds that SAS’ assertions regarding the State’s conduct in connection with the
Malku Khota conflict have not been proven and that the actions of some Bolivian officials, as the
Claimant described them, despite being questionable, are insufficient to conclude, as asserted by
the Claimant, that they were part of a plan by the State to gain control of the Project or to have
the indigenous communities oppose CMMK. The evidence on the record shows that the State
attempted to mediate in the conflict between supporters and objectors to the Project. The record
shows that in early 2011, officials with the Governor’s Office visited the Project area and met
with the community members and organizations that opposed the Project. !° Similarly, the record
shows that the Governor’s Office held at least two meetings with CMMK and the Indigenous
Communities and representatives of the Governor’s Office, in which options to remedy the

conflict were discussed.'°° In 2011 and 2012, both the Office of the Potosi Governor and the

667. Contrary to SAS’ assertions, there is no evidence that at the meetings with the communities the
Governor’s Office expressed its opposition to the Project. In fact, the Claimant's assertions in this

regard are not supported in the contemporaneous documents,
the view that SAS’ officials and directors expressed with regard to Bolivia’s support between

January 2011 and mid-2012.'°7

668. There is no evidence either that, as SAS suggests, the Government of Potosi had demanded a
stake in the Project as a condition for its viability. At the Hearing, Mr. Mallory, the Claimant’s
witness, stated that, in a conversation with the Governor in July 2011, he had suggested that “if
we ever went to the market and tried to create or raise shares, that they come to the Governor
first.”'°™ Mr. Mallory reiterated that the proposal was surprising, but emphasized that it was a
“suggestion,” !"”° and not a “demand,” as he and Mr. Gonzalez Yutronic implied in their written

witness statement.'°7°

1072 Mr. Angulo said to have participated at the meetings of March 28 and May 28, 2012 as a community member and not as a
CMMK employee (See CWS-S, Angulo’s First Witness Statement, paras. 10-17; CWS-7, Angulo’s Second Witness Statement,
para. 53). In his report on the trip to Potosi between March 28 and 30, 2012 (C-272), Mr. Angulo does not te that his
perception would have been that the Governor’ s Office opposed the Project. Based on this report, Governor Gonzales personally
expressed that he did not agree with the private company, but there were alternatives for the development of the Project, and
that this was a reason for hope for Malku Khota. In turn, Mes Mallory and Gonzales Yutronic assert that at a meeting held
on September 25, 2011, Mr. Yerco Cervantes, Director of Mining and Development with the Government of Potosi, had
announced that the Government would support the actions of the community for the creation of a cooperative (CWS-4,
Gonzales Yutronic’s First Witness Statement, para. 13; CWS-3, Mallory’s First Witness Statement, para. 22). However, the
witnesses do not cite any contemporaneous document supportive of his assertions.

    

   

   

1073 In January 2011, Mr. Fitch reported that the SASC’s Board of Directors continued supporting the effort to solve the
community problems (R-170, Minutes of the SASC’s Board of Directors, January 12, 2011, page. 1). Also, SASC’s report of
July 8, 2012 expressly shows that the government authorities continued their efforts to reestablish peace and order in Malku
Khota (C-305, South American Silver Corp., News Rele: “South American Silver Provides Further Update on Bolivia,” July
8, 2012, p. 1). At the hearing, Mr. Fitch confirmed the contents of the report and accepted that “the Government of Bolivia
showed some level of support” (Hearing Transcript, Day 2, 394:7-13 (Spanish). Similarly, Mr. Mallory ratified that by

669. The Tribunal understands that the proposal to constitute a mixed company with Bolivia’s
participation was presented in the context of the conflict with the community members, as an
option to ensure the continuation of the Project led by CMMK.!°”’ Based on the evidence on the

108 the Tribunal cannot conclude that this

record and the social context in the Project area,
proposal — not demand — had an ulterior motive or undermined SAS’ rights over the Mining
Concessions. On the contrary, it was a proposal to ensure continuity for the Project, which is

precisely what SAS requested.

670. Similar considerations apply to the suggestion made by government officials in May 2012 for the
Company to temporarily suspend its operations.'°” This proposal, not a demand either, was made

in the context of escalating violence in the Project area!°*?

and there is no evidence that its purpose
was other than an attempt to have the objecting communities reach consensus in this period of
time. '°8! The Tribunal does not find that this proposal impaired in any way SAS’ rights over the
Mining Concessions, more so when the proposal was not accepted by the Claimant and, therefore,

did not even materialize.

671. Finally, SAS complains that Bolivia had not deployed the armed forces to protect CMMK’s

employees and assets from the alleged threats and actions by the community members who

1082

opposed the project However, the evidence in the record shows that Bolivia did take measures

to address the situation in Malku Khota and the Company’s requests, '°* including the deployment
of a police contingent to the areas surrounding Malku Khota to contain the violent actions of the
clashing community members,!° and the investigation, and, in some cases, the arrest of the

individuals subject of a criminal complaint filed by CMMK.'°%

alternative.

1078 See supra section VILA.

‘079 The Tribunal notes that this suggestion was made by officials with the Ministry of Mining at a meeting held on May 5,
2012 with CMMK’s officials, including Xavier Gonzales Yutronic and Witness X (see R-265). Subsequently, at a meeting with
representatives of the Government and the communities held on May 9, 2012, the Potosi Governor suggested that CMMK
temporarily suspended the activities (see C-51). The Claimant alleges that CMMK did not attend this meeting.

PCA Case No. 2013-15
Award

In any event, there is no evidence that the militarization of the area would have been an
appropriate measure conducive to remedying the social conflict and allowing the Project to

continue.

It is true, as the Claimant asserts, that in some situations and during the conflict, some of the
Respondent's officials could have had a more efficient and prompt action. It is also true that the
area is characterized by poverty and insufficient infrastructure that could have contributed to the
unrest generated by the Project and CMMK’s presence. However, on the one hand, the lack of
opportunity or efficiency in some actions is not, in this case, sufficient to qualify as a violation of
the fair and equitable treatment standard and, much less, to conclude that Bolivia acted with
premeditation and under a plan to gain control of the Project. Such an allegation requires a high
standard of proof as it entails establishing an act of the State in bad faith or intolerable negligence,

and such evidence is inexistent in this case.

Based on the reasons expressed in this section, the Tribunal concludes that it has not been proven

that Bolivia violated the fair and equitable treatment standard under Article 2(2) of the Treaty.

2. The claims for full protection and security
(a) The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant contends that under the full protection and security standard the State is obliged to
act diligently to ensure the “legal and physical” security of the investments in its territory, '°*°
adopting every necessary and reasonable measure to that end, “without any need to establish

malice or negligence” to establish violation of such an obligation. !°*7

In light of the facts, the Claimant asserts that “Bolivia’s actions fell well below” this standard. !°

On the one hand, the Claimant alleges that Bolivia failed to act with due diligence to afford full
protection and security to SAS’ investment. The Claimant asserts that the Government never
provided assistance to CMMK to solve the conflict, despite CMMK’s request for its intervention
in December 2010, and did not militarize the area surrounding Malku Khota when the conflict
became unsustainable. The Claimant submits “[a]nd in fact —and this is very telling and

important: Once [Bolivia] did control the Concessions, it is only then that it sent the police and

the military to secure the area.”'*® Thus, Bolivia did not take the necessary measures to prevent
an escalation of the social conflict.'!°° The Claimant submits that Bolivia encouraged opposition

1091

to the Project led by the illegal gold miners,'! and granted immunity to opposition leaders

through the Memorandum of Agreement, thus undermining “the [full protection and security] that

[SAS] was entitled to for its investments in Bolivia.”'°?

678. On the other hand, the Claimant submits that Bolivia deliberately withdrew the full protection and
security that it had granted to the Project. The Claimant contends that through the Reversion and
the purported withdrawal of the environmental permits, Bolivia “undermined and effectively

negated [the full security and protection] afforded to [SAS’] investment.” 1°

(b) The Respondent’s Position

679. The Respondent argues that the obligation to afford full protection and security “is not absolute
and does not impose strict liability upon the State that grants it.”'* It is an obligation of means
that requires the State to adopt the necessary measures to protect an investment, only when it is

1095

threatened by the illicit interference of non-State agents.'””’ Thus, the full protection and security

standard does not require “to obtain accurate results and, even less, to protect SAS from CMMK’s

actions.” °°

680. According to the Respondent, despite not having any international obligation to protect CMMK
as the opposition of the Indigenous Communities was legitimate,'°”’ The Respondent argues that
Bolivia complied with the obligation to grant full protection and security as “Bolivia protected
SAS’ investment until the Reversion date, insofar as possible.” '°°* The Respondent attempted to
maintain peace in the area by means of direct dialogue with the Government of Potosi, and
mediation meetings; and when the conflict escalated, Bolivia sent police officers and high-ranking

officials to help resolve it.'° Contrary to the Claimant’s allegations, military repression is not a

reasonable solution, as (i) it is incompatible with a free and democratic society, (ii) it is banned
under international law, and (iii) Bolivia’s experience shows that military intervention worsens

social conflicts."

681. The Respondent denies that Bolivia encouraged opposition to CMMK. Instead, Bolivia asserts

that it defended CMMK and attempted to reach an agreement to satisfy the interests of both parties

to the conflict, and, to that end, Bolivi:

 

ss government representatives put their safety at stake. The
Respondent submits that the violation of human rights and the rights of indigenous peoples by

CMMK was the only cause fueling the Indigenous Communities’ opposition.!!"'

682. Similarly, the Respondent denies granting immunity to opposition leaders through the

Memorandum of Agreement; the criminal liability of the leaders was simply determined to be
subject to the indigenous justice system. The Respondent states that the Government does not
even have the power to grant such immunity, in accordance with the principle of the separation
of powers. At any rate, the Respondent contends that there is no justification to consider that the
prosecution of the opposition leaders is a reasonable measure to protect the Mining Concessions,
and, thus, there could be no violation of the full protection and security standard if immunity was

granted. 110

683. Consequently, Bolivia asserts that it took the measures available to avoid the social conflict and

that the Reversion only came into play once Bolivia had exhausted all other alternatives “to
address a social conflict created and exacerbated by CMMK.” Moreover, Bolivia offered CAMK
the necessary means to resort to the courts in Bolivia, fulfilling its obligation to grant full

protection and security.'!°°

684. Finally, the Respondent denies that Bolivia attempted to revoke CMMK’s environmental permits,

alleging that the Claimant’s argument in this connection is “frivolous and demonstrates SAS’ lack

of solid arguments” .''

(c) The Tribunal’s Analysis

Article 2(2) of the Treaty provides that “investments of nationals or companies of each
Contracting Party [...| shall enjoy full protection and security in the territory of the other

Contracting Party.”

The Parties agree that the full protection and security standard requires the host State of the
investment to exercise due diligence and take reasonable measures to protect the investments. '!°
Likewise, Bolivia notes, and the Claimant does not contest, that the obligation to afford full

protection and security for the investments is an obligation of means and not of result.'!°°

The Tribunal agrees that the full protection and security standard under the Treaty imposes on
Bolivia the duty to act with due diligence, i.e. to adopt measures that are reasonable to protect the

investment, taking account of the circumstances of the case.!!°”

The Claimant accuses the Respondent of (i) refusing or simply failing to intervene when requested
to do so by SAS; (ii) encouraging opposition to the Project led by cooperatives and illegal miners
in the area; and (iii) granting immunity to opposition leaders and authors of the violence. !!°* The
Tribunal does not find these accusations to be supported or that, given the circumstances of the

case, Bolivia’s conduct has not met the full protection and security standard under the Treaty.

First, it has not been shown that Bolivia refused or failed to intervene when requested to do by
SAS. On the contrary, the evidence on record shows that since early 2011 and until mid-2012,
officials of the Potosi Government and of the National Government participated in meetings with
community members, objectors, and supporters of the Project, and also with the Company, several
of which were convened by the Governor’s Office, for the purpose of resolving the social conflict
that had erupted in the area due to the Project.''” Again, the delays or inefficiencies regarding
some specific actions are insufficient to qualify as actions in breach of the full protection and

security standard.

The Claimant has complained in particular that Bolivia did not militarize the areas surrounding

Malku Khota and presented this fact as proof that the Respondent did not act with due

diligence.''!° The Tribunal cannot accept this view. On the one hand, the militarization of the area
has not been shown to be an adequate measure conducive to resolving the social conflict and
allowing for the continuation of the Project. On the contrary, the experience of the State in this
regard shows that the measure is not only ineffective, but that it may also have fatal
consequences.''!! Indeed, the events that occurred in Malku Khota as a result of the police
intervention in May and July 2012 suggest that the intervention of the armed forces in this type

of conflict was not an appropriate solution for the conflict, as the Claimant suggests.

691. On the other hand, the fact that Bolivia did not order the militarization of the area is not evidence

that it had stopped implementing measures to seek the continuation of the Project. As noted
already, the officials of the Governor’s Office and of the National Government convened and
participated in outreach meetings for Project as well as dialogue with the objecting community
members, responded to concerns of the Company, as well as those of the supporters and objectors

to the Project, and proposed alternatives to resolve the conflict.'!?

692. Second, as the Tribunal noted at paragraphs 666 to 674 of this award, there is no evidence that

Bolivia in any way furthered or promoted opposition to the Project.!!"

693. Third, the Tribunal is not convinced that the alleged abandonment of the criminal proceedings

and investigations against the leaders of indigenous organizations recorded in the Memorandum
of Agreement of July 7, 2012 is, in this case, a violation of the full protection and security

standard.

694. On the one hand, the commitment to suspend the criminal proceeding against the leaders of the

indigenous organizations came about as a concession within the framework of an agreement to
end the social conflict in the Malku Khota area. It did not constitute general inaction by the State
against the alleged threats and aggressions directed at the Company. On the contrary, the fact that
there were investigations and criminal proceedings against the objectors to the Project shows that

the State did respond to the charges brought forward by CMMK.

695. On the other hand, and even if it was true that the alleged individuals responsible for some act

against the company went unpunished after the meeting on July 7, 2012, the Claimant has not

established that this negatively impacted its investment. The State’s commitment to abandon the

PCA Case No. 2013-15
Award

criminal proceedings and investigations against the leaders of the indigenous organizations that

opposed the Project did not mean a deterioration of the security situation for CMMK or SAS.

Finally, SAS alleged in its Statement of Claim and Memorial that the purported withdrawal of the
environmental permits had undermined the legal security and protection it was entitled to under
the Treaty.'!'* Even accepting that the full protection and security standard encompasses legal
security — something that the Parties have not discussed and need not be addressed by the
Tribunal — the Claimant has not established that the purported permit withdrawal had a negative
effect on the investments. In fact, there is no evidence that the permit had been effectively revoked
or that the internal draft on which it founded its allegation included the official and final position
of the corresponding entity or that it became public and somehow impacted the investment.

Therefore, the Tribunal also rejects this allegation.

In connection with the Reversion of the Mining Concessions, the Tribunal refers to the

11s

considerations presented supra!!! and concludes on that basis that Reversion is not a violation of

the full protection and security standard under the Treaty.

Based on the reasoning set forth in this section, the Tribunal finds that it has not been shown that

Bolivia violated the full protection and security standard provided under Article 2(2) of the Treaty.

3. The claims for unreasonable or discriminatory measures
(a) The Claimant’s Position

Relying on the definition developed in the Toto v. Lebanon case, the Claimant submits the
following definition for an unreasonable or discriminatory measure:
(i) a measure that inflicts damages on the investor without serving any apparent
legitimate purpose, (ii) a measure that is not based on legal standards but on
discretion, prejudice or personal preference, (iii) a measure taken for reasons that

are different from those put forward by the decision maker, or (iv) a measure taken
in willful disregard of due process and proper procedure. !""°

The Claimant submits that the measures Bolivia adopted in the present case, including the
Immobilization Zone, the decree freezing the area, the withdrawal of the support for the Project,

fueling the opposition to CMMK, and the Reversion, meet all of these requirements and,

therefore, are irrational.'''’ In particular, (i) the measures caused damages to “the management,

develoy use, enj , and ion” of SAS’ investments, without serving
any legitimate purpose, and actually deprived the country of various opportunities; (ii) the
Reversion was based on “mere executive fiat’; (iii) the Reversion was adopted in order for Bolivia
to appropriate the deposit, instead of for the purpose of pacifying the social conflict; and (iv)

Bolivia deprived SAS of due process. !!!8

701. Moreover, the Claimant argues that the measures adopted were also discriminatory. The Claimant

defines a discriminatory measure as one granting “a differential treatment of people or companies
in like circumstances, without a rational justification for that different treatment”.'"'° According
to the Claimant argues that the measures adopted by Bolivia fit this definition as (i) prior to
expropriation, several Bolivian government officials openly antagonized SAS for being a
“transnational” company; (ii) the Mining Concessions were expropriated “at least in part” based
on the fact that CMMK was owned by SAS;"!”° and (iii) there is no rational justification for the
expropriation. ''?! Contrary to the Respondent’s allegations, the actions discussed above establish
the existence of discriminatory measures because, as found by the Lemire v. Ukraine tribunal, “a
discriminatory measure [is] a measure that targets the claimant’s investments, specifically as

foreign investments” "122

(b) The Respondent’s Position

702. The Respondent contends that SAS’ arguments are insufficient to establish the irrationality of

Bolivia’s measures.'!?> The Respondent submits that the Immobilization Zone did not have the
slightest effect on the Mining Concessions because it was applied in areas outside the area of
concession, and the other measures, excluding the alleged encouragement of opposition, which

the Respondent denies occurred, were reasonable, !!**

legitimate purpose of pacifying the Malku Khota area, which was achieved through the

CMMK could have sought recourse against;'!”° (iii) there is no economic interest behind the

Reversion;!!”” and (iv) Bolivia did not deprive CMMK of due process.'!”8

Similarly, the Respondent contends that SAS has not demonstrated that the measures adopted by
Bolivia are discriminatory.'!”? The Respondent contends that arbitral decisions, including the
Lemire v. Ukraine case, require that the investor demonstrate that “(i) there is an investor from
Bolivia or another State, (ii) in circumstances similar to CMMK’s (iii) to whom Bolivia afforded
more favorable treatment”.''° However, SAS has not demonstrated any of these requirements. !'*!
The Respondent argues that SAS cannot satisfy its burden of proof as (i) the other company that
participated in the conflict was also expelled, ''* (ii) “other companies operate in the area without

91133

difficulty due to their good management of community relations, and (iii) any differentiated

treatment afforded to CMMK is justified by it being a “key element in the dispute amongst the

communities” 14

(c) The Tribunal’s Analysis

Article 2(2) of the Treaty also provides that “[n]either Contracting Party shall, in any way, impair
by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or

disposal of investments in its territory of nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party.”

The Claimant asserts that a measure need only be unreasonable or discriminatory to violate this
provision but, in any event, the measures imposed by Bolivia were both arbitrary and
discriminatory.''** The Respondent does not dispute this interpretation that is, in any event,

derived from the use of the disjunctive term “or” in the text of the provision transcribed above.

First, the Claimant alleges that the Reversion and the preceding measures are unreasonable and
impaired the investment. Based on the definition proposed by SAS and not contested by Bolivia,

a measure is unreasonable if it: (i) inflicts damages on the investor without serving any apparent

legitimate purpose; (ii) is not based on legal standards but on discretion, prejudice or personal
preference; (iii) is taken for reasons that are different from those put forward by the decision

maker; or (iv) is taken in willful disregard of due process and proper procedure. !'*

707. The only disagreement between the Parties regarding the applicable standard is whether there is
a difference between “unreasonable” and “arbitrary” measures. According to the Claimant,
“arbitrariness” involves a higher threshold than “unreasonableness”, which is referred to in Article
2(2) of the Treaty.''*’ On the contrary, the Respondent argues that the meaning of both terms is

substantially the same in the sense of something done capriciously, without reason. ''**

708. In the view of the Tribunal, this debate is irrelevant for the resolution of the instant case. Based
on the factual and legal reasons already noted, the Tribunal does not find that the measures in
question were unreasonable or arbitrary. In fact, the Tribunal has already concluded that the
Reversion served a legitimate public purpose; it had the effective purpose of pacifying the area,

in accordance with due process.'!°

709. Similarly, the Tribunal concluded that Resolution DGAJ-0073/2011 did not disregard or impair
the rights CMMK or SAS held over the Mining Concessions;'!° that there is no evidence that
Bolivia stated opposition to the Project;''*! that the proposal to create a mixed company did not

result from illegitimate motives or negatively affect CMMK’s or SAS’ rights;!!4?

and, finally, that
the Reversion was warranted and, except for the requirement of compensation, was carried out in
conformity with the Treaty.''? Based on the foregoing, the Tribunal rejects the Claimant’s
allegations regarding the purported imposition of unreasonable measures that impacted “the
management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal in its territory” of SAS’ investment in

Bolivia.

710. Second, the Claimant alleges that Bolivia’s measures were discriminatory and impacted the
investment. Again, the Tribunal notes that the Parties agree on the standard for discriminatory

measures.!! Consistent with the definition endorsed by both Parties, discrimination involves “a

differential treatment of people or companies in like circumstances, without a rational
justification for that differential treatment.” ''* The Tribunal accepts the definition of the standard
proposed by the Parties and, based on that and the facts established in the present case, it
concludes that Bolivia did not impair by discriminatory measures “the management, maintenance,

use, enjoyment or disposal” of SAS’ investments in its territory.

711. In fact, the Claimant did not establish the presence, much less the cumulation, of any of the
elements derived from the standard mentioned above, that is: (i) the existence of another person
or company in like circumstances, (ii) differential treatment, and (iii) the absence of rational

justification for such treatment.

712. In any event, the Tribunal finds unproven the Claimant’s allegation that the Reversion of the
Mining Concessions resulted, at least in part, from the fact that they were owned by a transnational
company. ''° Similarly, there is insufficient evidence to establish that government officials

attacked or antagonized SAS for being a “transnational” company. ''*”

713. Based on the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that there is no support for the allegation that
Bolivia violated Article 2(2) of the Treaty regarding the provision that the host State of the
investment shall not impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management,

maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of the investment in its territory.

4. The claims for less favourable treatment than Bolivian investors
(a) The Claimant’s Position

714. Based on the same arguments described in paragraph 701 supra, the Claimant asserts that the

discriminatory treatment to which SAS was subjected is a violation of Article 3 of the Treaty.'!4*

(b) The Respondent’s Position

715. The Respondent contends that SAS has not demonstrated that Bolivian investors received more

favorable treatment than CMMK in similar circumstances, and SAS’ foreign nationality was not

"7 The Tribunal notes that the Claimant bases its assertion that government officials “openly antagonized SAS for being a
‘transnational’ and not a Bolivian company” mainly on the testimony of witnesses Santiago Angulo and Xavier Gonzales
Yutronic (Statement of Claim and Memorial, para. 160, referencing CWS-5, paras. 11 and 18, and CWS-4, para. 25). However,

one of the reasons behind the Reversion. Therefore, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal

should reject the claim for violation of Article 3 of the Treaty.!'”

(c) The Tribunal’s Analysis

Article 3(1) of the Treaty provides that “[n]either Contracting Party shall in its territory subject

investments or returns of nationals of companies of the other Contracting Party to treatment less

favourable than that which it accords to investments or returns of its own nationals or companies

or to investments or returns of nationals or companies of any third State.”

The Respondent argues that to substantiate allegations that Bolivia afforded SAS’ investment
treatment less favorable than that which it accords to investments of its own nationals, the
Claimant must establish (i) the existence of a comparable national company which (ii) has been
accorded better treatment.'!*° Similarly, it alleges that, pursuant to “international jurisprudence,”
the party that alleges discrimination based on nationality must demonstrate that the measure in

question was motivated by the foreign nationality of the investor.'!*!

The Claimant has not questioned the standards proposed by Bolivia, nor has it invoked different
standards. On the contrary, its allegation that the Reversion was motivated, at least in part, by its

foreign nationality would seem to confirm the standard proposed by the Respondent.

Based on the text of Article 3(1) of the Treaty, in order to establish a violation of a national
treatment standard, it must be demonstrated, at a minimum, that a national of the host State of the
investment received more favorable treatment than the investor of the other Contracting Party. In
this case, the Tribunal does not need to go any further to conclude that Bolivia did not breach its

obligations under this provision.

In fact, the Claimant has not identified a Bolivian company - and much less one in like
circumstances — whose investments received more favorable treatment than that afforded to SAS.
On the contrary, it has been established that, by means of the Reversion Decree, Bolivia also
reverted the EMICRUZ concessions, a Bolivian company located in the Malku Khota conflict

area.'!*?

721. In any case, and as noted above, it has not been established that the Reversion was due, even in
part, to the fact that it concerned the property of a foreign or transnational company, or that

officials of Bolivia had antagonized the Company for this reason.'!*7

Consequently, the Tribunal
also dismisses SAS’ claim for the purported violation of the national treatment standard under

Article 3(1) of the Treaty.

722. Based on the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that it cannot be established that Bolivia violated

the national treatment standard under Article 3(1) of the Treaty.

VI DAMAG!

 

A. THE CLAIMANT’S POSITION
1. Right to compensation

723. The Claimant submits that it is entitled to receive compensation for the total loss of the Project
value due to Treaty violations by Bolivia.'™*

724. According to the Claimant, based on the report by RPA, as of March 30, 2011, the Project
contained an estimated ore deposit of 434.9 million tons total (including 31 million tons of
measured resources, 224 million tons of indicated resources, 179.9 million tons of inferred
resources), under a cut-off grade of 10 gram/ton of silver equivalent (10 g/t AgEq), based on a
US$16/ounce silver price, and US$550 kg/indium; therefore, it “was in the top 10 silver projects

in the world in 2012, and is the largest located in Bolivia” .'!**

725. Contrary to the Respondent's allegations, the Claimant contends that the Project has a value that

is certain and its loss needs to be compensated by Bolivia.'' The Claimant argues that Bolivia

confirms and understands that Malku Khota is a significant and strategic ore deposit.''*”

726. The Claimant considers that the Respondent’s position on the certainty of the damages is

unfounded and presents three arguments.

727. First, the Claimant underscores that the Mineral Resource estimate for the Project has been
analyzed by three independent experts (GeoVector within the PEA 2011 framework, and within
the framework of this arbitration, by RPA and Dr. Dagdelen, the Respondent’s economic expert),

and all agree that there is a significant mineral resource deposit in the Project area.'!* The

1159

Claimant explains that RPA estimates a deposit of 435 million tons! and Dr. Dagdelen estimates

it at 416 million tons.''® According to the Claimant, the main difference relies on the amounts

that would remain in the various categories of mineral resources (measured, indicated, or

inferred), which the experts admit is a matter of professional judgment.!!*!

728. Similarly, the Claimant reiterates that the 10g/t AgEq cut-off grade used in GeoVector’s
estimate!!®?, which RPA confirmed, '!® is the correct one. The Claimant maintains that the cut-off
grade of 20.4 g/t AgEq used by Dr. Dagdelen,'! is incorrect since it uses only silver, ignoring
the remaining recoverable metals.''® The Claimant further explains that Dr. Dagdelen used the
US$18.00/oz. base case silver price to estimate the cut-off grade, and he confirmed at the Hearing

that using a higher metal price as the silver price at the date of valuation proposed by the Claimant

would result in a lower cut-off grade.'!

729. The Claimant concludes by asserting that RPA’s conclusion that GeoVector’s resource estimate

in the PEA 2011 is reasonable (as adjusted downward for the “low grade halo”

1167

reclassification),''®’ should be given more weight than Dr. Dagdelen’s.!'® The Claimant asserts

that Dr. Dagdelen admitted the following at the Hearing:

(a) That SAS did not violate Canadian securities laws (NI 43-101) and that he ignored
provision 5.3(i)(c), that clarifies that Mr. Pennstrom did not need to be an independent

(b) Regarding the gold credits, that (i) no gold credit was used in the mineral resource estimate
in the PEA 2011,'!7 (ii) RPA did not use the gold credit in either resource estimate or
valuation,!!7! and (iii) Pincock Allen & Holt used a gold credit in the PEA 2009.!'”

730. Second, the Claimant asserts that inferred resources are sufficient in themselves for transactions

of mineral properties in the market and, therefore, all the categories of mineral resources

(indicated, measured and inferred) are treated similarly for the valuation of a mining project.!!77

The Claimant alleges that, at any rate, whether or not value is ascribed to the inferred resources
is irrelevant for valuation purposes: (i) if RPA’s estimates are accepted because these quantities,
or very similar quantities, were already taken into account in the various valuations considered
by FTI when estimating the Project’s fair market value; the same applies to Brattle’s valuation
based on the price share value;'!” (ii) because the impact of the adjustments advocated by the
Respondent’s experts would be insignificant, as the inferred resources would be removed from
all of the comparable transactions selected by RPA, but the transaction price would remain the

same, which would result in the value ascribed to the measured and indicated resources being

175

increasing accordingly. The Claimant also asserts that, contrary to Dr. Dagdelen’s

1176

suggestion, '!”° all Mineral Resources do not need to be constrained within a pit.'!”’ The Claimant

argues that there is no such requirement within any of the reporting codes, the test is “reasonable

prospects for economic extraction”,'' and a putative buyer would take into account all

identifiable Mineral Resources.'!”

Process”) has been demonstrated on a laboratory scale, and its effectiveness has been

demonstrated, on a commercial scale, in other successful projects that use the various steps of the

process on a commercial scale.''’ The Claimant contends that, contrary to Dr. Dagdelen’s

suggestion,''*! there are many examples of acid chloride leaching of various metals. !'*?

732. The Claimant submits that, the Respondent’s expert on metallurgy, Dr. Taylor, admitted at the
Hearing that his characterization of the amount of metallurgical test-work done was inaccurate
and that this test-work was consistent with the prefeasibility and feasibility phases. ''** The
Claimant rebuts Dr. Taylor’s criticism that testing was done on synthetic ore samples, referring to
Dr. Dreisinger’s explanation on how they are meant to replicate the leach-solution composition
that one would come to expect from an ore leach.'! As to the criticism that a pilot plant had not
been built for additional testing, the Claimant argues that Dr. Dreisinger confirmed, and Dr. Taylor
admitted, that at the time of the expropriation there were plans in place to build an on-site pilot
plant for further testing, but the expropriation prohibited SAS from advancing.'!** The Claimant
also contends that Dr. Taylor admitted that he cherry-picked data from the voluminous amount of
SGS testing data, making it appear as if the extraction rates were lower than they were.'!¢

733. The Claimant further states that, in May 2012, Asian investors invested US$16 million, and in
making that investment they clearly conducted due diligence on the metallurgical process.'!*7

734. As to the cause of the damages, the Claimant contends its injuries are solely attributable to
Bolivia’s actions. ''** The Claimant argues that if the Mining Concessions had not been
nationalized by Bolivia, SAS would continue to own the Project.''*? The Claimant asserts that the
measures adopted by Bolivia, in particular the Reversion but also its refusal to intervene to avoid

the conflict and the subsequent clashes, were the cause of the total loss of the investment.

Therefore, the injury suffered by SAS “is solely and directly attributable to Bolivia’s actions” .!!°°

The Claimant contends that Bolivia’s allegations in this connection are unsubstantiated, as (i) the
reasoning followed in the cases invoked by Bolivia is not applicable, as they deny compensation
to the investor due to its state of insolvency, while in the present case, there is a sound financial
footing;'!' and (ii) the Reversion Decree expressly provides for Bolivia’s obligation to pay
compensation to SAS, and thus, the Respondent itself “acknowledged the direct causation
between Supreme Decree No. 1308 [the Reversion] and the takeover of South American Silver’s

investments in the Malku Khota Project.”''

2. Standard of compensation for an expropriation

735. The Claimant argues that in the absence of an applicable /ex specialis, since article 5 of the Treaty

refers exclusively to compensation for lawful expropriations, customary international law
provides the governing rules for an unlawful expropriation of SAS’ investment by Bolivia. !'°

736. The Claimant argues that, under the standard of compensation of customary international law set
forth in the Chorzow case, a claimant who has suffered an unlawful expropriation by a State has
a right to full reparation that would “wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-
establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been

committed”, in the form of restitution in kind or its monetary equivalent, plus compensation for

any additional loss not covered by restitution in kind or its monetary equivalent. !!°*

737. During the Hearing,'!* the Claimant abandoned its claim for restitution. Therefore, its arguments

on this topic are omitted.

739. The Claimant contends that in the event the Tribunal finds that Bolivia’s expropriation was lawful

and, accordingly, that the standard of compensation under Article 5 of the Treaty was applicable,
or that such standard applies to both lawful and unlawful expropriations, the Claimant would be
entitled, at least, to receive “prompt, adequate and effective compensation,” pursuant to the

provisions of Article 5 of the Treaty.!!°

3. Standard of valuation for compensation

740. The Claimant argues that valuation of any compensation granted should be performed based on

the fair market value of the Project.!?°°

741. The Claimant asserts that arbitral tribunals have unanimously asserted that the “‘full’

compensation” to which an investor is entitled in case of expropriation, either pursuant to
customary international law or specific treaty provisions, is determined based on the fair market
value of the investment taken.!”"' Article 5(1) of the Treaty confirms this expressly by establishing
that compensation for expropriation “shall amount to the market value of the investment’ .'?°?
Therefore, the Claimant concludes that “while customary international law and the Treaty offer
two different paths to determine the compensation owed to Claimant, that compensation would
essentially be the same under both approaches since it would amount in both cases to the [fair

market value] of the Project” .'"

742. Similarly, based on the reports submitted by FTI and RPA, the Claimant argues that compensation

based on fair market value is the only one available in the present case, since given the stage of
Project development, discounted cash flow valuation would not be reliable, and given the

Project’s prospective cash flow”. According to the Claimant a cost-based valuation would also

is inconsistent with the internationally accepted standards for the valuation of mineral properties
at the stage of development of the Project;'?° (iii) the reimbursement of the investment costs does
not amount to full compensation, as it would not compensate for the lost return due to

value of the Project taken into consideration; '*** and (iv) a cost-based valuation would reward

Bolivia “for expropriating investments at an earlier point in time, no matter how egregious the

conduct”.

743. Thus, the Claimant contends that from a legal and an economic perspective, valuation based on

fair market value is the only one applicable to the Project.!?!°

744. However, if the Tribunal adopts an investment-cost valuation, the Claimant asserts that the
Respondent’s expert, Brattle, did not take into consideration general and administrative costs

estimated at US$ 12.9 million, for a total amount invested of US$ 31.6 million.'2""

4. Valuation Date

745. The Claimant argues that the business day immediately preceding the date the expropriation
became public was July 6, 2012 (“Claimant’s Valuation Date”) and that this is the date to
consider for the determination of compensation pursuant to Article 5(1) of the Treaty.'?!? The
Claimant alleges that the Memorandum of Agreement “formally marks the beginning of the
expropriation process”.'?"3

the Memorandum of Agreement signed on Sunday July 8, 2012, which was made public on that

same day. !7!5
746. In connection with the date of valuation proposed by the Respondent, the Claimant further states:

Indeed, despite uncritically accepting its client’s instruction to use a Valuation Date
of July 9th, Brattle’s own expert acknowledges that the market was aware and
reacted negatively to the expropriation announcement during the July 6th and 9th
time period, and this is in Paragraph 19 of RER 5. Consequently, the only proper
Valuation Date is June 6th, 2012.'?!°

[T]here was a significant drop in the share Price from a dollar on June 6, a Friday,
to 71 cents on June 9."

747. Inconnection with the Respondent’s argument that the Claimant communicated to the market that

there were no changes in the Project’s status, the Claimant states the following:

[T]he Project had not been nationalized on that date, but the fact is the market was
reacting very strongly to the public announcements by Bolivia on July 8, and we
can’t avoid the fact that, on July 9, the stock price had been contaminated by
Bolivia's own actions.'?'*

748. The Claimant concludes that “[f]o use July 9, 2012 as the valuation date would allow Bolivia to
benefit from its wrongful actions, which contradicts principles of international law. Accordingly,

the appropriate valuation date is July 6, 2012.”'?!°

5. Valuation method

749. The Claimant asserts that the valuation method in the report by FTI, that seeks to determine what
the actual market participants would do, rather than performing an academic exercise, is the

appropriate method in this case,'?”° based on two points:

1. The three valuations used by FTI are reliable. The Claimant asserts that FTI, upon

analyzing various approaches and methodologies, identified “three sources of information

that are sufficiently reliable for the purpose of determining the FMV of the Project.
The Claimant’ s expert assessed the information available for the market participants at the
Claimant’s Valuation Date. '*? The three market-based value indicators are mentioned

below:

. First, the Claimant argues that RPA’s comparable transaction valuation (“RPA’s
Valuation”), which yielded an estimated US$270 million (i) is a widely accepted valuation
approach and recognized as such internationally, !”* (ii) the properties selected “are
sufficiently similar to support a comparable transactions analysis,”'?** and (iii) the Metal
Transaction Ratio (the “MTR”) developed by RPA is appropriate to determine the
applicable value range applicable to mining properties containing several metals, such as

the Project.!25

Regarding the Respondent’s criticism, the Claimant contends that this approach accounts
for the various risks projects have in selecting the ones it considers “comparable” and
alleges “that social and technological risk could be further addressed through a downward

adjustment of (Dr. Roscoe’s] preferred multiple of 2 percent, and [Dr. Roscoe] suggested

99122

you could move the multiple closer toward the midpoint of 1.75 percent.””6 During the

Hearing, the Claimant, in answering Brattle’ s criticism that the preferred MTR-based value

of (US$ 270 million) would not exceed CIM Val’s reasonableness check, asserted:

that $270 million number is much less than the analyst average, and it’s less than
three of the four individual analysts’ valuations. It’s less than FTI’s comparable
companies ratios, which you recall FTI said we’re not using as an indicator value,
but it’s a reasonableness check, and it’s less than the high end of the share price that
South American Silver attained a little over a year before the expropriation.'”?”

. Second, the Claimant asserts that the Project valuations by industry analysts, resulting in a
US$ 572.1 million valuation, (i) “would have been considered by notional buyers and
sellers” of the Project as they were public at the Claimant’s Valuation Date, (ii) they were
performed by experts bound by their applicable professional codes of conduct, and (iii)
they all agree on the high value of the Project.'?* The Claimant submits that the existence
of valuations prepared by third parties outside a litigation context is an indicator of the
value of the asset the Tribunal cannot ignore.!”° The Claimant asserts that the fact that they
use DCF does not detract from their value as the contemporaneous indicators of the value

of the asset.'?°°

. Third, the Claimant contends that the value implied by private placement transactions for
SASC’s shares is a reliable indicator of fair market value since they “were necessary for
[CMMK] to continue to make progress in the Project and occurred two months before the
[expropriation].”!?3' The Claimant states that FTI explains that “they’re more useful market
indicators or indicators of Fair Market Value than the daily trading price because the latter
usually are smaller retail transactions that do not often capture the intrinsic value of a

91232

traded share’s underlying assets.

Given Bolivia’s criticism that these private placements occurred months before the date of
valuation, and, thus fail to capture the 60% drop in share price that preceded the
expropriation, the Claimant alleges that this drop in share price is attributable to Bolivia’s
wrongful conduct and, therefore, should be ignored for valuation purposes. '*7 The
Claimant further submits that, for this reason, they are a better indicator than the share price

at the time of expropriation. '?*

Further, the Claimant explains that “even if it had used the daily trading price on the date

prior to the expropriation in place of the private placement transactions, the impact on the

overall result would be immaterial and damages would decrease from 307 million to just

under 300 million” 12°

2. FTI’s weighing is appropriate. The Claimant contends that FTI performed a critical review
and considered the strengths and shortcomings of each of the three valuations, weighting
at 50% RPA’s valuation, at 25% the valuations for the Project produced by market analysts,

and at 25% the valuations implied by the private placement transactions. '?*

 

750. To defend the methodology used by FTI in this case:

(a) The Claimant argues that, contrary to Bolivia’s assertion,'?*’ the methodology applied by
FTI in the Copper Mesa case was not diametrically opposed to the methodology it used in
this case.'?** The Claimant contends that FTI used a “market approach” and presented a
cost-based valuation as an “alternative approach”.'?*° The Claimant underscores that FTI
made the professional decision based on the facts in the Copper Mesa case, where the
project assessed did not even have a PEA and where the claimant had been unable to

conduct its own testing and drilling.'“°

(b) The Claimant denies that Brattle did in this case what FTI did in the Bear Creek v. Peru
case. The Claimant argues that FTI explained during the Hearing that the property in Bear
Creek was at a different stage for mineral properties, which made FTI’s approach in that
case appropriate. !*4! The Claimant explains that it does not criticize Brattle for finally

deciding to use a share-price approach instead of a comparable analysis, but rather for not

describing in its report their alleged attempt to find comparables.'*? The Claimant refers

to Mr. Davis’s (Brattle) testimony and contends that, apparently, Brattle discarded the
comparable approach because “the share analysis was there and [Brattle] felt it what was

[sic] reliable, [which] caused [Brattle] to not do more than that amount of contemplation

about comparison sales”!

PCA Case No. 2013-15
Award

The Claimant addresses the Respondent’s criticism on the apparent discrepancy between the
US$ 307.2 million (without interest) figure of FTI for fair market value and the US$ 75 million
for the Project share value (a figure which is more or less acceptable for Brattle and FTI at the
Claimant’s date of valuation: July 6, 2012). The Claimant draws attention to the explanation
provided by Mr. Cooper who explained the difference when examining the “acquisition premia”
of junior mining companies (whose application would result in a range of US$ 126 to 376

million) !*

and the analysts’ valuations (“Consensus of Analyst Valuations of US$ 572.1
million”).'45 The Claimant submits that the Respondent and its expert ignore the undeniable
disconnection between the share price of a single-asset junior mining company and the underlying
value of its mineral assets.'*“° Mr. Cooper explained that junior mining companies commanded
acquisition bonuses over their share price of 54% to 67% during the period preceding the
expropriation. '“7 He also provided a graph showing that, at the date of expropriation, the
underlying net asset value of non-producing junior mining companies was on average 2.44 times
higher than their share price, within a range that was 1.25 to 5 times the share price.'™* The
Claimant submits that this is consistent with the contemporaneous analysts’ valuation of the
Project, all of which had valuations significantly higher than the share price on the respective

report date. !*4°

As to the cost-based valuation method presented by Bolivia, the Claimant holds that, in addition
to being legally excluded as it does not relate to the fair market value required under the Treaty,
the approach used in Brattle’s report “is erroneous and nakedly geared towards driving
Claimant's damages to the lowest possible number.” '° The Claimant elaborates on various

reasons below:

(a) Excluding the general and administrative expenses from the valuation is inconsistent with
the cost-based approach followed in Brattle’s report. According to the Claimant, Brattle’s
report does not respect its own standard of valuation, since the general and administrative

expenses are investment costs, as (i) the Project is the cause for incurring in such expenses;

and (ii) a return on all the expenses incurred is expected, not just the drilling and exploration

expenses. !?5!

(b) Deduction of the hypothetical value of Protected Information from the compensation
amount cannot be justified. The Claimant contends that the value of technical information
bears no relationship to the Project market value and, at any rate, the information would
only be valuable for Bolivia, as it is the one that currently has control over the Mining

Concessions. '?°?

During the Hearing, in connection with the Respondent’s valuation, the Claimant asserted that
Brattle was instructed to estimate only the Project investment cost, and that only in the Second
Brattle Report was a fair market value used.'*** The Claimant underscored that Brattle used only
a “share approach,” which according to CIM Val is a secondary approach, the “market approach”
being the primary approach.”!?** The Claimant also submitted that Brattle had acknowledged

during the Hearing that it had not analyzed the comparable method in depth. °°

The Claimant further argues that the methodology used by Brattle “does not reward Claimant at

all for the risk it took in converting Malku Khota from an exploration property to a mineral

resource property and on to the cusp of being a development property.”'?**

Similarly, the Claimant refers to the alternative damage valuation presented by the Parties and

states the following:

Brattle also, in its Rejoinder, for the first time, finds that the share price on July 9th
implied a Fair Market Value for the Project of between 35 and 48 million, depending
on the value attributed to the non-expropriation Escalones Project in Chile.

FTI noted that, as already discussed, Brattle used the wrong Valuation Date and also
overvalued Escalones. When these adjustments are made, Brattle’s alternative
implies a valuation of between 69 million and 83 million. Regardless, Brattle’s
unadjusted alternative valuation is some four to six times higher than the valuation
it provided in its initial report.'?"

Finally, the Claimant deems unsubstantiated the argument Bolivia presents on the reduction of

1258

compensation on account of contributory negligence,'** adding that Bolivia has been unable to

prove any of its allegations of wrongdoing, such that there is no justification for such a

reduction. '?*?

According to the Claimant, (i) the decision in the Abengoa v. Mexi

 

co case, by analogy, confirms
that the Respondent cannot invoke contributory negligence, as “there is no regulatory framework
in Bolivia defining the obligations of CMMK to implement a community relations program” and
Bolivia presented no specific requests to CMMK in this regard; '?°° and (ii) at any rate, the
invocation of contributory negligence requires a willful or negligent action by the investor, but
“SAS always acted lawfully and is not responsible for the politically-motivated opposition”, as

confirmed by Bolivia’s representatives themselves. '”°!

The Claimant submits that the underlying facts and evidence in the Copper Mesa case, invoked
by the Respondent, are very different from this case.'?° In that case, the tribunal concluded that

“by the acts of its agents in Ecuador, the Claimant [resorted] to recruiting and using armed men,

firing guns and spraying mace at civilians, not as an accidental or isolated incident but as part

of premeditated, disguised and well-funded plans to take the law into its own hands.”'?* The
Claimant contends that Bolivia has the burden of proof regarding these purported violations that
the Claimant would have committed, and it has not proven that the Claimant provided weapons
to the community members or otherwise fostered violence in the area.'** The Claimant further
contends that, contrary to the Copper Mesa case, SAS never paid those communities or
community members for their formation of COTOA-6A, rather they did it voluntarily and these
were also communities who lived within the Project area.'2°° The Claimant contends that the 75%

reduction requested by Bolivia is unwarranted. !7°°

6. Compensation for other Treaty violations

759. The Claimant argues that, in the event that the Tribunal should determine that Bolivia did not
violate the expropriation provision under Article 5 of the Treaty, it would be entitled to receive

compensation for Bolivia’s violation of the other standards of protection in the Treaty. '?°7

760. The Claimant submits that, despite the fact that the Treaty does not assign a particular standard of
compensation for the other violations aside from expropriation, compensation for such injury
must “be sufficient to compensate the affected party fully and to eliminate the consequences of
the State’s action.” '*°* To restore the situation that would have existed but for Bolivia’s acts and
omissions, the Claimant submits that compensation needs to be equivalent to the Project value,
“but for Boli
wholly-owned subsidiary, CMMK.”'?°

 

ia’s unlawful acts, [SAS] would still own the [Mining] Concessions through its

761. In respect of the standard of valuation, the Claimant states that there is a “clear emerging trend”
toward adopting the fair market value standard. '?” The Claimant submits that “numerous arbitral
tribunals have held that [fair market value] constructed an appropriate measure of damages for
non-expropriation claims when the measures at issue have resulted in the loss of the protected
investment’.'*”! Thus, the Claimant submits that the standard of fair market value is appropriate
in this case, since the actions adopted by Bolivia violating the Treaty resulted in “the total loss of

[SAS’] investment” .!?”

the Claimant requests compensation equivalent to the Project’s fair market value.'?”

7. Interests

763. The Claimant submits that Bolivia’s annual statutory rate of 6% (i) is the only applicable interest
rate that has been suggested before the Tribunal, as none of Bolivia’s proposals represents “a
normal rate,” and (ii) is the “minimum applicable interest rate” pursuant to Article 5(1) of the
Treaty, as the commercial interest rate per the Central Bank of Bolivia ranges between 6.5% and

7.0%.'?74

764. Regarding the interest rate, the Claimant submits that “international law now recognizes the
awarding of compound interest as the generally accepted standard of compensation in

international investment arbitrations.” 7° Moreover, the Claimant asserts that compound interest

is part of the full reparation to which SAS is entitled to.'°

765. Contrary to Bolivia’s allegations, the Claimant asserts that (i) the prohibition in the Bolivian Civil

Code does not apply in this case; and (ii) Bolivia’s argument in this connection “was soundly

rejected” in the Rurelec case.'?”

B. THE RESPONDENT’S POSITION
1. Right to compensation

766. The Respondent submits that for damages to be recoverable under international law, the alleged

1278

victim of a wrongful act must prove, on the one hand, the certainty of damages, and, on the

other hand, that there is sufficient causality between the damages claimed and the unlawful act.!2”

existence of these indispensable circumstances in the present case.'**° The Respondent submits

that SAS’ claims are unfounded and the fact that the Claimant abandoned its claim for restitution

1281 1282

during the Hearing'**' confirms its frivolous nature.

767. The Respondent submits that the damages SAS alleges “are merely hypothetical,”'?* for the

reasons detailed below:

(a) The progress of the Malku Khota Project to the exploitation stage is merely speculative,

given its embryonic stage. The Respondent submits that “it can take 15 to 20 years from

the discovery of a mining site to a mine’s production stage,” if attained. !*** Bolivia

contends that the development of a mining project up to the exploitation stage requires
several environmental studies, including an environmental impact study and a series of
geological studies starting with the PEA, and followed by a pre-feasibility study,
concluding, in this case, with a feasibility study. Once these studies have been performed
and a favorable outcome is obtained, there follows the procurement of all necessary licenses
and permits, securing external financing, complying with the early consultation stage with
local communities and the beginning of a series of complex and costly construction
activities. '?*° Therefore, “only a minimum percentage of the mining projects are able to be
developed,” as acknowledged in the RPA’s report presented by the Claimant.!?** In this
case, the Malku Khota Project was at the PEA stage, i.e. the earliest stage of development
of a mining project.'?*’ For all these reasons, the Respondent submits that SAS is requesting

this Tribunal to compensate for a hypothetical damage and to ignore all the risks that a

1288

mining operation such as the Project entaile whose technical and/or economic

feasibility was uncertain. !?*°

(b) The economic potential of the Malku Khota Project development is mere speculation as it
only had one PEA” and the technical and economic feasibility of a mining project can
only be determined from a pre-feasibility study.'?"' The Respondent argues that the PEA
simply collects results from limited drilling to determine the feasibility of continuing with
the exploration stage, and only through pre-feasibility and feasibility studies, which
identify the economic potential of mineral reserves, is it possible to determine the economic
feasibility of exploitation of the Project.'?°? The Respondent underscores that the existence
of mineral resources, which is what the Project has, does not imply that it is technically

and/or economically feasible. '?°

Thus, the Respondent submits that, given its speculative
character, as recognized by SASC, the Claimant’s experts and the Project’s PEA itself, and
given the very low level of reliability, the PEA is considered only as a mere “conceptual

study,” and not as a “solid economic study”.'?°*

Therefore, the estimation of mineral
resources and predictable revenue and extraction costs included in the PEA, which was
never confirmed in the pre-feasibility and feasibility studies, is eminently speculative. !?°>
The Respondent reiterates that the Project remained at an embryonic stage and contends
that, as recognized by SASC in 2012, it was two or three years away from completing

financing and guaranteeing the development of the procedure. '?°°

(c) The estimation of the mineral resources in the PEA 2011 is exaggerated. The Respondent
argues that the PEA 2011 attributes US$ 0.72 to each ton of estimated mineral resource due
to the existence of gold credits, which is equivalent to a total of US$ 144 million, and
overestimates indicated resources by 70,806 million tons and underestimates inferred

resources by 49,855 million tons. The PEA artificially increases the size of the estimated

mineral deposit as the alleged gold credits are inexistent and it is highly probable that

inferred resources, which have a lower geological reliability, do not exist either.'?°”

(d) The valuation of mineral resources in RPA’s report, based on the PEA 2011, is inaccurate.
First, the Respondent argues that RPA does not differentiate inferred resources from
measured resources for valuation purposes in spite of the fact that in the mining industry
inferred mineral resources “have no value”.'°*

Second, the Respondent argues that RPA uses an unjustifiably low 10 g/t AgEq cut-off

grade, reducing the minimum metal concentration required in a ton of material for it to be

included in the mineral resources. !”°? The Respondent argues that, taking into account
capital and operating costs, the cut-off grade applicable to the Malku Khota Project is, at
least, 20.4 g/t AgEq, with the capability of reaching 30 g/t AgEq. The Respondent submits
that the PEA 2011 was significantly higher (20.9%). The above shows that RPA

overstates indicated mineral resources by 110.6%, measured mineral resources by 84%,

and inferred mineral resources by 127%.'*"!

Third, the Respondent alleges that RPA’s valuation solely reflects estimated mineral

resources and not economically mineable resources as RPA never performed an analysis of

the pit limit,!*” rather assessed the Project “assuming that a hundred percent of what is
characterized as ‘resource’ is to be mined”'**. At any rate, the Respondent clarifies that:

(i) upon analyzing the pit limit under a 20 g/t AgEq cut-off grade, the Project’s

economically mineable resources (113.1 million tons) represent less than half of the

estimated mineral resources (231.6 million tons); '° and (ii) the effective economic
feasibility of the extraction would still depend on the expected revenue to be sufficient to

cover the Project exploitation costs.'*°5

(e) The damage valuation by FTI and RPA does not take into consideration the uncertainty of
the Metallurgical Process. The Respondent submits that “[t]he Tribunal cannot, without
violating due process, supersede SAS in proving its damages.” '**° The Respondent
contends that estimates by the Claimant’s economic experts are based on the assumption
that the Metallurgical Process works and that it is feasible at a commercial scale. '*°”

However, the Respondent argues that the Metallurgical Process: (i) has not been used

before in mining; '* (ii) has never been tested in a pilot plant, or in actual mineral samples

 

of the Project;!*” and (iii) it is a new and unique process, which increases the profitability

and feasibility risks of the Project.'*!° Therefore, the Respondent argues that there is no

certainty that the Metallurgical Process can be used in the Project.'*!!

The Respondent underscores that Dr. Dreisinger acknowledged during the Hearing that his

testimony regarding the Metallurgical Process’ feasibility is based on Flowsheet B only 3",

and argues that the report on which the Claimant bases its metallurgical arguments, and in
which, for the first time, Flowsheet B is mentioned, is the SGS report from August 2013,
one year after the date of valuation, and there is no evidence that Flowsheet B existed at
the date of valuation'*!* (emphasis added by Respondent). The Respondent argues that, at
the date of valuation, the Metallurgical Process was incomplete'*'* and Flowsheet B did
not exist,!3!5 which is why it was uncertain that the Metallurgical Process would be capable
of economically extracting the Project metals'*!° (emphasis added by Respondent). The

estimates, the estimated value of the Project is reduced by 50% under the “classic”

cyanide-leaching method.'*!”

At any rate, even assuming the feasibility of the Metallurgical Process, there would be still
uncertainties as to its profitability, because the Respondent contends that: (i) there are
serious doubts as to the impact of this process on the recovery values for precious metals;
(ii) the use of new technology implies cost overruns and delays; and (iii) the use of the
Metallurgical Process in the Project would imply very high additional costs derived from
the refining of indium.'*'* Despite all these reasons, “RPA and FTI make no adjustment in
their valuations to reflect the uncertainty of the Metallurgical Process and the possible cost

overruns that it can generate”.'3!°

The Respondent further questions the credibility of the Claimant’s expert, Dr. Dreisinger,
based on the fact that he, as owner of Class B shares of SASC, “has a direct economic

991320

interest in the outcome of this arbitration, which he did not disclose in his witness

statement or over the course of direct examination.

(f) The Project would have never received external financing. Relying on the Equator
Principles, the regulations of major international financial institutions, and the corporate
social responsibility policies and programs adopted by the main mining companies, the
Respondent concludes that “every mining project must respect [the rights of indigenous
communities, their resources, and the environment] to be financed.” '3? However, due to
CMMKk’s violation of human and indigenous rights, and the risk that the Project entailed
for the resources and the environment of the area, the Respondent considers that there is
abundant evidence that the Project would have never been funded.'*?3 Thus, even if Bolivia

had not adopted the Reversion, the Project could not have been developed since it is “not

disputed that, without external funding, SAS could not build, much less operate a mine in

Malku Khota”.°*

(g) The Project could not have been developed due to significant social opposition. The
Respondent submits that the Project would have never overcome the early consultation
stage with the local communities, a sine qua non requirement for the exploitation of a
mining project in Bolivia and, therefore, even if Bolivia had not adopted the Reversion,

325

SAS would have never been able to develop the Project.'

768. Based on the foregoing, the Respondent concludes that SAS is not entitled to compensation as it

has not met the burden of proving the certainty of its damages.'*”°

769. At any rate, even if the Tribunal finds that damages suffered by SAS are certain, the Respondent
submits that the proximate cause of these damages is attributable exclusively to SAS and,
therefore, Bolivia has no obligation to compensate it as the required causal link between the

Reversion and the damages claimed by SAS does not exist. !*?7

710. The Respondent contends that decisions by other international tribunals confirm that an investor
should not be compensated when its own conduct is the proximate cause of the damages, even if
this conduct is not the exclusive cause.'*?* The Respondent accepts that these decisions entailed
companies with financial difficulties; however, contrary to SAS’ allegations, the Claimant
contends that the determining factor in these decisions “are not such difficulties in themselves,
but that they were caused by the affected companies themselves”. '*? Consequently, the
Respondent submits that this reasoning is applicable to the present case since, in light of the facts,
“although Reversion was a formal act that put an end to SAS’ exploration activities, SAS was the

real causing agent of its damages” .'**°

2. Standard of compensation for an expropriation

771. The Respondent submits that monetary compensation is the most common form of reparation
used by arbitral tribunals to repair the damages caused by the actions of a sovereign State, and, in
particular, is the form of reparation provided for in Article 5 of the Treaty for cases of
expropriation. Thus, if the Tribunal considers that there is damage to be compensated, the
Respondent submits that reparation in this case should be limited to monetary compensation for

the damages suffered as a result of the Reversion, be it lawful or unlawful.!*3!

772. In this regard, the Respondent deems SAS’ compensation claim to be arbitrary, as there is no
reason to justify a monetary compensation at the date of the award and, it should therefore be
rejected by the Tribunal. '** In particular, the Respondent argues that: (i) the standard of

3. Standard of valuation for expropriation

773. The Respondent submits that “if the Tribunal concluded that Bolivia should compensate SAS

(quod non), such compensation should be limited to the reimbursement of the costs incurred by

SAS in relation to the Project.”*"

774. Relying on the decisions of other arbitral tribunals, the Respondent contends that the market value
of the expropriated asset, absent a solid base to establish that such asset would generate future

revenue, is based on costs.'*** Then, given the Project’s speculative nature, the Respondent

considers that the only way to determine market value for SAS’ investment is based on investment
costs.'39

775. Moreover, the Respondent submits that other tribunals confirm that cost-based valuation is the
method used when a discounted cash flow method is not applicable, or when the compensation

requested is disproportionate to the investment costs.'*° Both circumstances arise in the present
case, in the Respondent’s view.'*"!

776. Contrary to SAS’ arguments, the Claimant argues that: (i) the method for calculating the fair
market value of the expropriated investment by reference to costs has “proved quite popular in
arbitral practice”; '*” (ii) SAS’ economic experts accept that the cost-based assessment is

consistent with the international standards applicable;'* (iii) any prospect of future development

1344

of the Project is merely speculative;'** and (iv) a cost-based valuation would not create an

incentive for Bolivia to expropriate assets in its earliest stage as, in the present case, Bolivia “was

forced to reverse the Mining Concessions,” and at any rate, “the earlier in time an asset is taken,

the bigger the risk that the asset has no value”.

4, Valuation Date for the expropriation

777. The Respondent submits that the valuation should be performed as at July 9, 2012
(“Respondent’s Valuation Date”), and the date of valuation in FTI’s report is contrary to the
Treaty. The Claimant asserts that there is no justification to consider July 6, 2012 as the day
immediately preceding the announcement of the expropriation, since on July 9, 2012, SAS
communicated to the market that the Memorandum of Agreement had no impact on the

Project.'*4° The Respondent argues that expropriation came into force on August 1, 2012 through

that same day- Bolivia had announced its intention to nationalize the Mining Concessions.”
In view of the above, under Article 5(1) of the Treaty, the date of valuation should be July 9, 2012,

the day immediately preceding the date expropriation was publicly announced. '*“*

5. Valuation method for compensation

778. The Respondent submits that the cost approach is used by international arbitration tribunals to
evaluate incipient mining projects.'*° The Respondent quotes the decision of the tribunal in the
Copper Mesa case which, with respect to the cost approach, concluded that it was “the most
reliable, objective and fair method in this case for valuing the Claimant’s investments,” and
asserted that the other methodologies were “uncertain, subjective, and dependent upon
contingencies.” The Respondent submits that this is exactly the case in this Project: the Project

is at an early stage without any mining activity, and the valuations proposed by SAS are uncertain,

subjective, and dependent upon contingencies. °°!

779. The Respondent argues that the cost approach presented by Brattle has two advantages: on the
one hand, only true damages are compensated, and, on the other hand, the risk of

overcompensation is avoided. '*** Contrary to SAS’ allegations, the Claimant argues that:

(a) _ It has not been established that the investment costs of the Project included general and

administrative expenses, and therefore “to consider this concept in the calculation would

991353

be arbitrary and speculative; and

(b) The deduction of the value of Protected Information is imperative, otherwise, SAS would
be allowed to continue to benefit economically from the Project through the sale of

technical information and, thus, “SAS would be overcompensated.”***

780. Similarly, the Respondent submits that even if the Tribunal were to find a valuation based on fair
market value to be applicable, the valuation method in FTI’s report should be rejected

completely, '** for the following reasons:

(a) The three valuations on which the FTI’s report is based are not reliable; they are
fundamentally wrong and do not reflect fair market value '° (emphasis added by

Respondent).

i. The Respondent argues that RPA’s valuation should be rejected. The Respondent
maintains that the comparables method used by RPA is inherently speculative, as has
been acknowledged by the mining industry, the legal authorities, the case law and

FT] itself.!°°7

The Respondent argues that FTI’s sources recognize that the Project does not have

any comparable in the market!***

and, at any rate, the mining assets selected by RPA
are different from the Project “in all the relevant criteria” (for example, geographical
location, stage of development, mineralogy, and density of resources). '? The
Respondent underscores that RPA’s comparability analysis ignores the fundamental

1360 such as the metallurgical risk°*!

risks of the Project that directly impact its value,
(the alleged “comparables” use conventional metallurgical processes), social risk
and environmental risk. '°? Consequently, the Respondent submits that RPA
overvalues the Project and compares it with properties that are not really comparable,
which invalidates its valuation. °°

d'%65 and (ii) its application in practice is void. '*° The

scientifically validate
Respondent submits that when determining and applying an MTR to the Project,
RPA incorporated a degree of arbitrariness that invalidates its valuation:
(1) arbitrariness in determining the MTR of the supposedly comparable
properties, '*°7 (2) arbitrariness in determining the MTR applicable to the Project, '**

and (3) arbitrariness in applying the MTR to the Project resources. °°

Regarding the first arbitrariness, the Respondent compares this case, where RPA has
estimated an MTR considering five option agreements, to the Bear Creek case, where
FTI excluded the option agreements because they make the value of the underlying
silver asset difficult to establish.'*”’ Moreover, the Respondent alleges that price
determination for the option agreements by RPA is “totally subjective,” since it has
no scientific support. '*7! The Respondent further contends that RPA took into
consideration transactions that were performed more than five years before the date

1372

of valuation, '** while in Bear Creek, FTI only used transactions that were performed

573 and mentions that, under RPA’s own

two years before the date of valuation
premises, only transactions performed 18 months before the date of valuation should
be considered and the older the transaction, the less reliable the information would
be.!9 The Respondent underscores that “RPA resorted to historic resource estimates
of 4 properties in spite of the fact that the Qualified Persons (QPs) who performed
such estimations said that they ‘should not be relied upon or cannot be relied upon”
to determine an MTR of comparable properties!?’> and that “the reasonable and

As to the arbitrariness in determining the MTR applicable to the Project, the
Respondent alleges that the 2% MTR was determined through a subjective

1377

process,'*”’ which cannot be validated as it cannot be replicated by other experts

given that RPA does not detail the formulas used for its comparability index'*”* and
merely indicated at the Hearing that it is “in line with [their] experience doing other
studies, other Comparable Transactions Analysis where there is invariably a fairly
range of MTR values”.'*”? The Respondent alleges that CIMVal was trying to get
away from this type of valuations that are impenetrable to other experts!**° and the
Copper Mesa award confirms that the valuation of the Project cannot be based upon

the subjective and unverifiable judgment of one person.!**!

In connection with the arbitrariness in applying the MTR to the Project resources,
the Respondent argues that the application of the MTR developed by RPA attributes
the same value to indicated and measured resources as to inferred resources'**? and
overestimates the Project resources by using a 10 g/t AgEq cut-off grade that

artificially overstates the value of the Project.'***

The Respondent argues that the Hearing demonstrated that RPA did not perform
capping when calculating the Project’s resources, despite having recognized that it

should be done,'*** because it would have reduced the Project’s valuation. !*8°

 

577 RPA explained such a process during the hearing to determine the 2% MTR starting with a 0.10% to 9.6% range; after
excluding the outliers created a comparability index, by applying the “6 middle transactions” that ranged between 1.03% and
2.38%. See Hearing Transcript, Day 6, 1055:6 ~ 1057:4, 949:11-25 (English).

The Respondent asserts that, at any rate, the resulting value range is not reliable as
its application on the mining assets used by RPA “overestimates or underestimates

the alleged ‘comparables’.”'*°

The Respondent concludes that the valuation is subjective (since the selection of
comparables is an inherently subjective exercise), uncertain (given the use of a wide
range of values —- US$ 13.8 million to US$ 1,300 million) and dependent upon

contingencies (for example, that the Metallurgical Process works).'**7

ii. Likewise, the Respondent considers that the Project’s valuation by industry analysts
should be ruled out. The Respondent argues that (i) there were commercial ties
amongst three out of the four analysts and SASC at the time of valuation; '*** (ii) the

1389 £1390

valuations are based on the DCF metho which, as recognized by FTI itsel:
is not applicable to the Project; '**'; (iii) the drop in SASC’s stock value proves that
the valuations are not relevant to determine the fair market value as “the market itself
did not consider them reliable”; '*°? and (iv) the analysts did not consider important
risks related to the Project, and made fundamental errors which FTI did not
correct. !*°? The Respondent considers absurd the justification offered by FTI during
the Hearing that its report is not based on the analysists’ DCF estimates but on their
conclusions, as the conclusions are based on the DCF model.'*** The Respondent

contingencies (for example, the DCF model premises that analysts use).'*°°

iii. | Regarding the valuation based on private placements, the Respondent admits that it
does not share the deficiencies of being subjective, uncertain, and dependent on
contingencies as with the previous models. However, it argues that “various market
indicators had a negative evolution between the date of such placements and the
valuation date in July 2012”, and therefore, the values in April and May 2012 should
be excluded when assessing the fair market value of the Project, as they do not reflect
the fall of various market indicators between April-May and July. °°’? The
Respondent argues that the available evidence confirms that the fall of these
indicators affected the value of SASC’s shares and, accordingly, the Project.
Therefore, FTI’s valuation based on private placements should be discarded as it

does not reflect this evolution. '*°*

(b) The weighting given by FTI is arbitrary.'*” The Respondent contends that the weighting
given by FTI does not provide an objective method as it is impossible to prove that a
hypothetical buyer of the Project would weigh the valuations used by FTI in the same

way, 1400

(c) The Respondent further argues that the Copper Mesa award reveals that FTI’s position in
this arbitration contradicts the one it adopted in the Copper Mesa case, where advised by
FTI, the claimant proposed to value the mining concessions based on the cost approach to
estimate fair market value.'“°' Moreover, the Respondent argues that, in the Bear Creek
case, FTI recognized the relevance of the geographical differences in the value of mining
properties and did not consider properties located in different countries to be

1402

comparable.'*”* In clear contradiction, in the present case, FTI gave a 50% weigh to the

valuation (RPA) based upon 12 properties, 11 of which are located outside Bolivia.“ The

Respondent argues that “[i]/f RPA had considered the only ‘comparable’ property located
in Bolivia (Pulacayo), the value of the Project —under the same economic premises of the

PEA- would be US $ 32,5 [sic].”""*

The Respondent argues that the arbitrariness of the fair market valuation for the Project performed
by FTI is demonstrated in light of SASC’s share value since “according to FTI’s valuation, the
Project would be worth 530% more than SASC itself’.'*°° The Respondent argues that, at the
Respondent’s date of valuation, (i) SASC’s value in the stock exchange was US$ 48.7 million
and (ii) the Project value would range between US$ 35.2 and US$ 48.7 million (depending on the
value assigned to the Escalones project, another asset owned by SASC).'*°° The Respondent
argues that SAS did not question this calculation during the Hearing, nor that such valuation,
being based on the publicly traded value, is objective, verifiable and gives a narrow range of

values.!47

The Respondent argues that the CIMVal Rules consider the share value method (market
capitalization) as a secondary method because most companies have more than one major project,
which makes it difficult to assess what value to assign to each of the major projects. '* The

Respondent submits that this is not the case with SASC.'4”

The Respondent explains that since the enterprise value of SASC (determined by deducting debts
and available cash from capital value) as of August 1, 2012 amounted to US$ 13.5-14 million, the
value of the Escalones project would range between US$ 0, as a minimum, and US$ 13.5 million,
as a maximum. '*!° Based on the value FTI attributes to Escalones (US$ 7.3), the Project would

be worth, at a maximum, US$ 41.4 million.

The Respondent argues that, in this case, only the share value properly reflects the risks of the

Project,'*!! and there is no reason to think that the stock value of SASC does not adequately reflect

its enterprise value and thus the value of its assets.'*!? The Respondent contends that this value

reflects all publicly available information and the relevant risks of its assets.'4!*

785. The Respondent further states that FTI, in weighting the private placements of SASC’s shares in
April and May 2012 at 25%, recognizes that SAS’ share value is indicative of the Project fair
market value.'*'* The Respondent further argues that: (i) at the time of the private placements,
SASC had the cash balance necessary to move forward with the operations, therefore it had no
urgency to get financing;'*! (ii) the lack of urgency in connection with financing is demonstrated
by the long time the company took to advertise and place the shares; (iii) to accept that these were
“compelled transactions” would lead to the absurd conclusion of accepting that SASC was willing
to take a loss higher than the amount obtained.'*!° The Respondent concludes that, if the shares
traded at prices very similar to the stock market value, it is because the latter does reflect its fair

market value.'"!7

786. Further, the Respondent argues that the deduction of the Protected Information value is imperative

 

even if the share value is used as valuation method because “if someone has taken the total fair

market value of the asset, it should have been taken with information’,'"* and regarding the

patent,

one thing is what happens with the ownership of the patent. But another thing is the
license to use that patent. Why am I saying this? Its fair market value is based as a
premise on the operation of the metallurgical process. No fair market value
compensation can be expected as if the process worked and later say that whoever
comes afterwards to develop this has no access to the same patent necessary to
estimate the fair market value.'*!°

 

787. The Respondent submits that FTI recognized at the Hearing that if Bolivia were ordered to
compensate SAS due to the Reversion (quod non), the value of the Protected Information should

be di d from such ion.'“”° The R di ds that neither SAS nor its

experts questioned (i) the calculation of the value of the Protected Information made by Brattle
nor (ii) that there are third parties interested in acquiring such Information.'4?! The Respondent
argues that SAS did not cross-examine Bolivia’s witnesses on this regard either, and therefore if
it is ordered to compensate SAS (quod non), such compensation should be reduced by US$ 6.2

million. !4?

788. At any rate, relying upon the decisions of other arbitral tribunals, the Respondent contends that
SAS’ conduct should be taken into consideration when establishing the compensation amount, to
reflect its contributory negligence in the production of damages. '4?? Contrary to what the
jurisprudence invoked by SAS may suggest, the Respondent clarifies that contributory negligence
in this case is not focused on “the obligations of investors regarding social communication” ,\**
but the violations of human and indigenous rights, the social conflict and the infringement of other
laws of Bolivia attributable to SAS.'?° Thus, the Respondent requests the amount of such
compensation granted to the Claimant “be reduced by, at least, 75%, considering that the actions
and omissions of Claimant itself were the ones that contributed to the damage that it claims to

have suffered.”'°

6. Compensation for other violations of the Treaty

789. The Respondent argues that “SAS has not demonstrated why, in cases other than expropriation,

compensation should be calculated based on the standard of [fair market value].”'*”"

790. First, the Respondent argues that SAS’ position is contrary to the Treaty, since Article 5(1)
provides for the exclusive application of fair market value in cases of expropriation. Thus, the

Respondent contends that, “[a]pplying this standard to cases other than expropriation would

imply ignoring the will of the parties” .'"*8

791. Second, the Respondent argues that other arbitral tribunals have repeatedly confirmed that the fair
market value standard is not applicable other than to expropriation. '“” In this sense, the
Respondent considers that the decisions invoked by SAS do not support its position, as (i) in the
Gold Reserve v. Venezuela case, the application of the fair market value standard was justified by
the existence of an agreement between the parties, but not “for the loss of investment,” ° and (ii)
other cases establish that arbitral tribunals decline the application of the fair market value

standard, even when the non-expropriation measures caused the investment to be “economically

unsustainable.”'*!

792. At any rate, based on the decisions of other arbitral tribunals, the Respondent argues that

compensation for other Treaty violations requires proof of the specific damage caused by each

1432

alleged violation, as well as the causal link between the damage and the violation. '*** However,

the Respondent contends that SAS has not identified or provided an itemized valuation of the
damages arising from the non-expropriation measures. '**? Consequently, the Respondent alleges

that, “if the Tribunal concluded that Bolivia did not breach Article [5] of the Treaty, regarding

expropriation, it must deny any compensation due to failure to produce evidence” .'**

7. Interests

793. The Respondent argues that a commercial interest rate is preferable in this case, because (i)

pursuant to article 411 of the Bolivian Civil Code, “applying the statutory interest rate would

overcompensate SAS in this case”,'** and (ii) at any rate, SAS has not provided any argument to

explain “why the statutory interest rate is preferred over the commercial rate.” °°

794. The Respondent contends that the interest rate to apply should be the risk-free U.S. Treasury rate
(0.21%). In the alternative, the Respondent argues that the commercial rate should be estimated
based on Bolivia’s issuance of 10-year sovereign bonds in October 2012, a date very close to the
Respondent's Date of Valuation, and later add the results to the risk-free interest rate (resulting in
an annual rate of 2.9%),'4*7 for the following reasons: (i) the risk premium is a natural baseline to
estimate the interests to be applied to the amounts owed by Bolivia; '4** (ii) it is a method regularly
used by arbitral tribunals;'** and (iii) “the [commercial] rate obtained is even higher than the

ones usually applied by arbitral tribunals (based on LIBOR),”'“*°

795. The Respondent rejects compound interest as: (i) there is an express prohibition under Bolivian
law regarding the capitalization of interest, and several arbitral tribunals have applied a simple

rate whenever a national prohibition of this sort applies; “4!

and (ii) there is no constant
jurisprudence establishing the principle of granting compound interests and, as a matter of fact,

recent awards have favored simple interest.'““?

Cc. THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

 

796. The Tribunal has found that the reversion of the Mining Concessions constitutes a direct
expropriation pursuant to Article 5 of the Treaty. Likewise, it has found that Bolivia breached the

obligation to provide compensation as required by said provision.

797. Regarding the expropriation, the original claim filed by the Claimant sought restitution and only
in the event that this was not feasible, it requested the Tribunal to award compensation for the

damages caused due to conduct of Bolivia which it considered to be contrary to international law.

However, the Claimant expressly abandoned its claim for restitution, and therefore the

Tribunal will not address it.
Regarding compensation for expropriation, Article 5(1) of the Treaty provides that it shall be:

just and effective compensation. Such compensation shall amount to the market

value of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation or before

the impending expropriation became public knowledge, whichever is the earlier,

shall include interest at a normal commercial or legal rate, whichever is applicable

in the territory of the expropriating Contracting Party, until the date of payment,

shall be made without delay, be effectively realizable and be freely transferable.
The Treaty provides that compensation shall amount to the market value of the investment
expropriated, but does not prescribe a valuation method to estimate that value. Therefore, it is for
the Tribunal to determine the appropriate valuation method to obtain the market value mentioned,

taking account of the terms of the Treaty and the characteristics of the investment in question.

The Claimant considers that its investment consists of “the investor’s shares in the local company
as well as the assets of that local company,” '*** i.e., CMMK’s shares and assets. On this point,
the Tribunal notes that, even if it controls 100% of CMMK, the Claimant has not established that
said control affords it a direct right over the assets of the Company under the applicable laws, in
particular the law of Bolivia. CMMK is the owner of the Mining Concessions and the assets, and
SAS’ investment consists of the totality of CMMK’s shares. Consequently, for purposes of
compensation, the valuation is based on the effect of the expropriation on the value of the shares
that SAS indirectly owns in CMMK, taking into account that the Mining Concessions and the
investment made in the Project by the Company are the only assets of CMMK that are established

in the record.

The Claimant considers that the above-mentioned Article 5 of the Treaty applies only to lawful
expropriation and, in the event of an unlawful expropriation, customary international law
applies.'“5 However, the Claimant itself argues that “while customary international law and the
Treaty offer two different paths to determine the compensation owed to Claimant, that
compensation would essentially be the same under both approaches since it would amount in both

cases to the [fair market value] of the Project.”'“4° The Respondent, in turn, argues that the

standard of compensation under the Treaty applies regardless of the lawfulness or unlawfulness

of the expropriation. '“7

802. Additionally, the Parties differ in two substantial respects. On the one hand, they differ regarding

the date of valuation for compensation. While the Claimant considers that the relevant date is July
6, 2012, the day immediately preceding the signature of the Memorandum of Agreement of July
7, 2012,'* the Respondent considers that, at the earliest, it should be July 9, 2012, as the

expropriation was made public on July 10, 2012.'°

803. On the other hand, they differ as to the correct method to determine compensation. FTI, the

Claimant’s expert, calculates the compensation owed to SAS due to the expropriation as the fair
market value of its 100% ownership interest in the Project as of the Claimant’s Valuation Date. '4*°
To calculate such compensation, FTI uses three sources of market-based information: (i)
comparable transactions identified by RPA; (ii) analysts’ reports, and (iii) private placement

transactions involving SASC’s shares in the period preceding the Claimant’s Valuation Date.'4*!

804. In turn, Bolivia considers that if compensation is to be provided, it should be limited to the costs

incurred by the Claimant in connection with the Project.'** If the Tribunal does not accept the
cost-based assessment, and as a subsidiary valuation, the Respondent argues that the Project can
only be reliably valued based on SASC’s share value.'**? Along these lines, in its first report,
Brattle, the Respondent’s expert, quantified the costs of investment in the Project'*™ and, in its
second report, presented an alternative valuation for the Project based on the market value of

SASC’s shares at the Respondent’s Valuation Date (July 9, 2012).'4°5

805. The Parties do not dispute that the appropriate valuation approach depends on the state of

exploration or development of the relevant mineral property.'** Similarly, the Parties do not

dispute that, based on the categories proposed by CIMVal, the Project would qualify as a “mineral

which have not been demonstrated to be economically viable in a feasibility study or a
prefeasibility study. '°8

806. According to CIMVal, “mineral resource properties” can be valued using a market approach and,
in some cases, an income or cost-based approach.'**° The experts for both Parties agree that an
income approach — in particular, the discounted cash flow approach — is not appropriate.'“°°. The
Claimant’s experts advocate for a market approach and argue that a cost-based approach is not
appropriate.'“*! In turn, Bolivia’s experts argue that the methods that FTI uses to arrive at its

estimate of the Project’s fair market value are unreliable and, based on the instructions received,

they present the calculation of the costs invested in the Project.!4

807. The Tribunal shall first analyze the stage of development of the Project as of July 2012 and,
subsequently proceed to examine the valuation methods presented by the damages experts for
both Parties, and to establish the criteria based on which compensation is to be paid to the

Claimant.

1. The Project development stage at the date of expropriation

808. It is not contested that a mining project has to complete several stages before reaching the
production phase. The experts for both Parties agree that a mineral property may be categorized

as one of four types, according to its level of progress: (i) exploration; (ii) mineral resources; (iii)

development; and (iv) production.“

809. To advance to the next production stage, several studies have to be conducted to determine

whether the continuation of the Project is warranted. In order of increasing certainty and accuracy

4457 According to CIMVal, Mineral Properties can be categorized as the following types, based on their level of development:
(i) exploration properties; (ii) mineral resource properties; (iii) development properties, and (iv) production properties. (FT-27,
p. 21).

1458 CER-1, First FTI Report, para, 8.30; RER-3, First Brattle Report, para. 31. The Tribunal notes that, in their respective
expert reports, the experts ‘or both Parties have referred to the “Standards and Gui“lines for Valuation of Mineral Properties”
of the Special Committee of the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum on Valuation of Mineral Properties
(“CIMVal”), introduced in the arbitration as Exhibit FTI-27, in connection with the standards applicable to the valuation of
mineral properties. Regarding this topic, the Tribunal will refer to the standards but they will not be considered binding.

regarding the feasibility of the project, these studies are categorized as: (i) conceptual study or
Preliminary Economic Assessment; (ii) prefeasibility; and (iii) feasibility.'** Only after each of
these studies is completed, a decision on production can be made and financing sought. '*°
Additionally, in parallel and as a requirement to obtain financing, substantial work has to be
conducted regarding environmental and social issues, and a series of permits and licenses have to

be obtained.

In the present case, the experts from FTI, RPA and Brattle agree that the Project could be
categorized as a “mineral resource property” since a PEA had been completed and the existence

of mineral resources had been established.'4°7

The Claimant and its experts noted in their written submission that, in addition to completing a
PEA, SAS had started to work on a prefeasibility study. '*°* However, the Tribunal finds no
support in the record that such studies were underway at the time the Reversion occurred and,
much less, that they had been completed. In fact, RPA confirmed during the Hearing that the
Project did not have a feasibility or a prefeasibility study necessary to demonstrate economic
feasibility. “©? Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that, at the time of the Reversion, the Project did

not have any completed studies aside from the PEA 2011.

It is uncontested that the PEA is the first stage of economic evaluation for a mining project. '4””
As Dr. Dagdelen explains, the PEA “is a first level study and the preliminary evaluation of the

mining Project. The principal parameters for a conceptual study are mostly assumed and/or

factored. Accordingly, the level of accuracy is low.”'""! The purpose of a PEA is to determine if a

mining project demonstrates potential to continue investing in it and advancing to a feasibility

study.

Dr. Dagdelen also notes that, as no engineering work is performed at this stage, the PEA is a

highly speculative study that cannot be used to determine the viability of a mining project or its

value. '47

Although RPA asserts that projects at this stage are the subject of transactions and have
a value, it agrees that at the PEA level it is not possible to demonstrate the economic viability of
a mining project.'*” In particular, the expert for the Claimant confirmed that, at this stage, the
economic viability of the Project had not been demonstrated and that there were no guarantees

that it would be economically viable at any point.'*”5

814. In sum, whether the PEA is qualified or not as speculative, the experts agree, and the Tribunal
finds proven, that the Project had barely progressed to the completion of a PEA which, as noted,
is a preliminary study —a first level study for the economic evaluation of a mining project — based
mainly on assumptions, which simply indicates whether further exploration should be pursued,

without offering any certainty whatsoever as to the economic viability of the project.

815. Géiven this state of affairs, even accepting that the PEA 2011 showed great potential for the Project
—as argued by SAS in the present arbitration — the fact is that given the stage of progress in which
the Project was in at the time of the Reversion, there was no certainty that such potential would
be realized. In fact, SASC acknowledged as much in a May 2012 communication, wherein it also
mentioned that it expected to undertake between 120,000 and 150,000 additional meters of
drilling — i.e. approximately three times more drilling than that undertaken by that point — and
that substantial further investments in technical, environmental, social and feasibility studies
would be required over the next two to three years before project financing could be completed

and development assured. !47

816. On the other hand, it is undisputed that, at the time of the Reversion, the Project had mineral
resources but no reserves.'*”’ The Tribunal understands that only the portion of the resources

categorized as reserves can be economically extracted.'*”* On the contrary, and as stated in the

viability.
817. Similarly, it is undisputed that most of the resources identified in the PEA 2011 were categorized
as inferred resources. '“* Based on geological certainty and estimation accuracy, the mineral
resources are classified in decreasing order as either measured, indicated, or inferred.'**! Inferred
resources have a lower level of geological confidence and, therefore, are not relevant for the

determination of the existence of mineral reserves. '**?

818. However, the Parties and their experts dispute if the inferred resources may or may not be taken
in consideration to value the Project. According to Dr. Dagdelen, since inferred resources cannot
be used in determining the size of the mineable deposit, they do not and cannot contribute to the
valuation of a mining property. '*? RPA asserts that the premise that the inferred resources cannot
be used for the valuation of the mineral properties is false and that transactions of mineral
properties in the early stages take place in exchange for the value agreed between the Parties for

the inferred mineral resources. “**

819. The Tribunal does not ignore that early stage mineral properties may be the object of market
transactions and that the Parties to a market transaction may agree a value for the inferred
resources. However, it is not established that the valuation criteria employed by the Claimant have
been employed to value market transactions of a mineral property with the characteristics of the
Project and with such a high percentage of inferred resources and may be valued for market effects

as the Claimant proposes.

820. Finally, the Tribunal finds that, at the date of the Reversion, there was no certainty that the
Metallurgical Process could be used to economically extract Project metals. Even though it is true
that SASC had performed some testing of the Metallurgical Process and that its individual

components had been tested, the Claimant’s own experts recognize that at the time of Reversion

logistics, metals prices, and mining costs.”). See also R-125, p. 5 (“A Mineral Reserve is the economically mineable part of a

‘480 The Tribunal observes that, in accordance with the PEA 2011, inferred resources ranged between 55% and 64% of the total
resources (CER-2, First RPA Report, p. 9-4). Likewise, it notes that RPA reclassified some inferred resoure
potential” (CER-2, First RPA Report, p. 1-2). In turn, Dr. Dagdelen indicated that the PEA 2011 overestimated indicated
resources and underestimated inferred resources (RER-2, First Dagdelen Report, para. 80). Pursuant to the observations by
RPA and Dr. Dagdelen, the Tribunal understands that the percentage of resources that need to be classified as inferred may be
even higher than the one mentioned in the PEA 2011.

(i) the components of the Metallurgical Process had not been combined sequentially in a

commercial application; '**° (ii) the Metallurgical Process had not been tested at a pilot plant; '4*°

and (iii) it had not been tested completely on the Project minerals, but on synthetic samples. '**”

Considering the novelty and uncertainty of the Metallurgical Process, on the one hand, and the

  

characteristics of the metal mixture in the Project, on the other hand, the Tribunal concludes that,
at the time of Reversion, there was no certainty that the Metallurgical Process could work, and, if

it worked, what the recovery level of metals or the cost of the process would be.

Neither the Claimant nor its experts dispute that the impossibility to use the Metallurgical Process
to economically extract the Project’s metals — in particular, indium and gallium — would gravelly
affect the technical and economic viability of the Project and, therefore, its value. The lack of
certainty regarding the Metallurgical Process impacts on the reliability of the analysis conducted
by RPA which, as indicated below, assumes that the Metallurgical Process would work with

certainty. '“88

In sum, the Tribunal finds that, at the time of Reversion, (i) the Project was not at an advanced
stage since it only had the PEA 2011 and had not conducted a prefeasibility or feasibility study;
(ii) it did not have mineral reserves, but merely resources, most of them inferred; and (iii) there
was no certainty that the metals could be economically extracted through the Metallurgical
Process. The Tribunal considers that the Project’s state of progress cast serious doubt as to its
economic viability and, based on the reasons elaborated below, they preclude acceptance of the

valuation presented by the Claimant.

2. The valuation methods presented by the Parties

As a starting point to decide on the determination of compensation, the Tribunal notes that an
accepted principle for assigning the burden of proof is that the party which alleges damage should
establish its quantum. The Respondent is correct that the damage needs to be certain although the
Tribunal notes that mathematical or absolute certainty is not required. In particular, when it comes
to estimating future damages, it is impossible to achieve total certainty and what the Tribunal
requires is evidence that establishes with a particular degree of certainty that, on the one hand, the

variables on which a calculation is based have a solid foundation and a reasonable probability of

occurrence, and, on the other hand, that the combination of such variables yields a high level of

probability that the result would actually correspond to the damage suffered by the investor.

The foregoing rules out calculations based on premises or variables that do not produce a reliable
degree of certainty, and, obviously, variables that are merely speculative, that yield unpredictable
results, or that ultimately do not convince the adjudicator that, absent the State’s conduct in
question, it is highly probable that the investor would have received the amount it alleges to have

suffered in damages.

The case before this Tribunal is about a Project that is not in the production stage and for which
it is not possible, as accepted by both Parties, to estimate future cash flows. Bolivia considers that
the investment is worth at most what the Claimant invested in the Project and the Claimant
considers that its value is substantially higher. It is for the Claimant to establish this higher value
with a degree of certainty that allows the Tribunal to conclude that, absent the State’s conduct at

issue, it is highly probable that the investor would have received the amount it claims.

The Tribunal has already noted that Bolivia breached the Treaty given its failure to provide the
Claimant the compensation it owed for the expropriation. Since the Respondent has not paid any
compensation to the Claimant, it is for the Tribunal to establish the amount of the compensation

for the expropriation, which is the subject of fundamental disagreements between the Parties.

Bolivia considered, in the Reversion Decree, that the value of compensation amounted to the
value of the investments made in the Project. This same position was adopted by the Respondent
in its Counter-Memorial.'**° However, in its Rejoinder, Bolivia puts forward two new theories
that would lead to no compensation — based on the exercise of police powers or a state of necessity
— theories which the Tribunal already rejected. It also put forward a new theory for calculating
compensation on the basis of the value of SASC’s shares at the Respondent’s Date of Valuation

(July 9, 2012).

The Claimant, in turn, presented a valuation based on the variables analyzed below starting at
paragraph 832. Additionally, the Claimant complains in its Rejoinder that the Respondent
criticizes the opinions presented by FTI’s and RPA’s experts, but it does not offer any alternative

valuation of the Project or calculation of the damages suffered by SAS.'4°!

Award

830. Regarding the absence of an alternative valuation, the Tribunal observes that since the issuance

of the Reversion Decree, Bolivia has argued that the only appropriate compensation would be the

one based on the Project’s costs. Regarding the valuation based on the value of SASC’s shares,

 

as already noted, said valuation was only presented by Bolivia in its Rejoinder and was
extensively discussed during the Hearing, but Bolivia clearly stated that this valuation approach
was put forward to show that the compensation calculated by the Claimant is “clearly exaggerated
and must be discarded,” adding in its Post-Hearing Brief that this method of compensation
would only apply if the Tribunal were to consider that compensation based on the Project’s costs

1493

would not apply.

831. The Tribunal will first analyze the compensation presented by the Claimant, followed by the

compensation based on the costs incurred in the Project and, if this were inapplicable, the

valuation based on SASC’s share value as presented by Bolivia.

832. In its valuation of the compensation, FTI, expert for the Claimant, noted that to determine the fair

market value of the Project it applied a market based approach and, to that end, used information
from three sources: (i) information from transactions involving comparable mineral properties as
set out in the RPA Report; (ii) reports by industry analyst, and (iii) information on private
placement transactions for SASC’s shares in the months leading up to the Claimant’s Date of

Valuation. '4°*

833. FTI assigns a percentage to each of the three sources of market information as part of the

weighting based on their strengths and shortcomings it attributes to each source. Thus, FTI assigns
50% weight to transactions that involved comparable mineral properties, 25% to market analysts;
and 25% to the data from private placement transactions for SASC’s shares.'** Based on this
percentage allocation, FTI establishes an average of the three sources to determine the fair market

value of the shares that SAS holds indirectly in CMMK.

834. The Tribunal considers that the valuation method that FTI uses is not a convincing estimation of

fair market value for the reasons presented in the following paragraphs.

835. In fact, there is no clear and convincing explanation as to the reasons that lead FTI to assign the

specific weighting percentages to each of the sources used to estimate the average of the three

variables. On the contrary, the evidence suggests that the assignment of a 50% weighting to

PCA Case No. 2013-15
Award

comparable operations and 25% to the analyst reports and private placements accounts more for
a discretionary assignment of percentages than a scientifically or financially based determination.
At the Hearing, the experts for both Parties agreed that the allocation of percentages was

subjective. '4°

In addition, it involves an exercise of weighting sources that is highly sensitive to changes to any
of the percentages assigned and thus requires, on the one hand, a detailed analysis of the reasons
underlying the respective percentage attributed to each source and, on the other hand, an analysis
of the sensitivities in the potential adjustments made to each percentage. As the Tribunal has
already noted, the experts agree that the assignment of percentages is subjective, and it is
dependent on the party performing the valuation. In the opinion of the Tribunal, that would require
a detailed and convincing explanation of the reasons underlying the assignment of percentages,
and the elements that would introduce an increase or decrease for each percentage, as well as the
impact that the variations would have on the fair market value estimated by the Claimant’s
experts. The report presented by FTI does not fully or convincingly explain the reasons behind a

50% assignment to one of the sources and a 25% to each of the other two.

In the opinion of the Tribunal, the foregoing is sufficient to discard the valuation presented by the
Claimant. However, given that the Parties have discussed each of the sources taken into account

by FTI to calculate the fair market value, the Tribunal will refer next to each of these sources.

Regarding the first source mentioned by the Claimant, i.e. the information on transactions
involving comparable mining properties, the Tribunal observes that the calculations performed
by FTI are based on the comparability analysis performed by RPA, also the Claimant’s expert.
However, such comparability analysis by RPA does not support a clear conclusion that the mining

properties that RPA took into account for its analysis are comparable to the Project.

The Parties’ experts agree that the Project is unique with respect to the mineral composition of
the deposit and that it is difficult to find transactions on comparable projects. '“°’. RPA, the

Claimant’s expert, is clear when asserting that:

there are no truly comparable properties, however, if a number of transacted
properties with similar attributes can be found, they can be analyzed to develop a
range of values. RPA agrees with the Brattle Report in that there are differences
between the comparable transactions used and the MK property, but considers that

the properties selected are sufficiently similar to support a comparable transactions

840. Witness Cooper"? and the analysts! also share the opinion that Malku Khota is a unique

project. Moreover, the same analysts — whose reports FTI uses as a source — considered the

possibility of conducting an analysis based on comparable transactions, and discarded it,!*!
opting instead for a discounted cash flow analysis. !*

841. The comparative analysis RPA performed, which is summarized at Table 6-1 of its Second Report,

includes the following comparability factors: (a) location; (b) metal content; (c) access; (d) stage

of development; (e) geological setting; (f) deposit type; (g) country ranking."

842. Inits Second Report, RPA notes that, instead of adjusting the value of each comparable transaction
to simulate the Project value, it has researched “a number of market transactions which are
generally comparable to the MK Project in terms of the comparability factors listed in

Table 6-1”! and mentioned at paragraph 841 above.

843. The Tribunal finds that, given the unique characteristics of the deposit, which is not contested by

the Parties, a comparability analysis cannot be performed on the basis of a number of “generally

291505

comparable properties, and excluding factors that even one of the Claimant’s own experts

considers relevant to such analysis. '*°° However, even if the comparison factors proposed by RPA
constituted all of the relevant factors to consider, the Tribunal finds that some of the factors
proposed have only been partially analyzed and others yield ranges so broad or lead to results that

are so uncertain that they cast serious doubt on the result and validity of the comparison.

844. Regarding the location of the projects, RPA proposes as comparable transactions projects located
from Mexico to Chile, and for comparison purposes, it notes that these are projects located in the

Cordillera Central and that they result in a significant level of geological and metallurgical

are potential liabilities. (See Roscoe, W.E., 2012, Metal Transaction Ratio Analysis — A Market Approach for Valuation of Non-

comparability.'*’ The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant’s expert that the similarities within the
geological and metallurgical aspects of a project can make it comparable to projects with similar
geological and metallurgical characteristics. However, it also agrees with the comment made by
Brattle, Bolivia’s expert, to the effect that the different location of a project affects not only the
geological and metallurgical aspects but also other aspects that impact the valuation, including
climate conditions, infrastructure availability, workforce, tax treatment, investment conditions,
tax burden, and social and political risks. '*°* None of these factors are discussed by the Claimant’s
expert to explain the comparability of the Project to projects located in Mexico, Guatemala, Peru,

Argentina, and Chile.

845. However, even assuming that a comparison of the geological and metallurgical aspects would
suffice, the Tribunal finds enough differences in the stage of development of what RPA considers
comparable projects to cast doubt on their comparability. In fact, (a) eleven of the projects that
RPA deems comparable are in the advanced exploration stage, without any evidence of a PEA
comparable to the Project; (b) two have feasibility studies; and (c) one is in the exploitation
stage.'*? Only Malku Khota appears with a PEA. It has been established, and the Parties do not
seem to dispute that the exploration stage precedes the stage where a PEA has been produced and
this, in turn, precedes and is subject to a higher degree of uncertainty than a project with a
feasibility study.'5!° The Parties dispute whether or not a project with a PEA is in an advanced
stage of exploration that would reduce the uncertainty on the deposit content and the viability of
its exploitation. '*!' RPA, the Claimant’s expert, does not convincingly explain the level of
development for the eleven projects that it categorizes as projects in the advanced stage of
exploration, nor does it establish that they have a PEA comparable to the Project’s, or explain
how that level of development compares to a project that already had two PEAs, such as the

Malku Khota Project.

846. Similarly, the metal combination that the Claimant alleges is contained in the Project and the
metal combination in the comparable projects cast serious doubts as to the comparability of the
projects. Even if all of the projects presented as comparable contain silver, as Malku Khota does,
the Tribunal finds two substantial differences that, again, add uncertainty to the comparison. On

the one hand, Malku Khota, contrary to the other projects listed by RPA, seems to have indium

and gallium which contribute to the fair market value estimated by FTI.'*!? However, the
extraction of indium and gallium depends on novel technology, which has not been tested and, if
it were to fail, it could result in higher operational costs as compared to the costs of the projects
considered comparable but for indium and gallium. The PEA 2011 itself, prepared at CMMK’s
request, includes an alternative plan in case the Metallurgical Process option — the untested

technology — is not viable,'*!?

an alternative plan that is not taken into account for the purposes
of the comparison and that would affect RPA’s comparison. On the other hand, half of the projects
analyzed as comparable have gold, a metal that is not present in Malku Khota and that, according
to the Parties’ experts themselves, changes the cost composition of the projects, although the

experts disagree on the effect on such composition.'°!4

RPA, the Claimant’s expert, was extensively examined at the Hearing on the comparables method
used and the answers cast similar doubts as to the comparability of the Project with the other

projects selected.

In fact, RPA admitted to not calculating in particular the “metallurgical risk” or the value
differential if the Project did not have indium and gallium, which are not present in the projects

selected for the comparison. '°!5

Similarly, it accepted that its model did not consider the
economics of using “cyanide leaching” (the conventional process) to extract the metals,'*!° and
that it did not review the economics of the PEA 2011 if cyanide leaching were applied. '*!”
Additionally, although RPA asserted that the “country risk” which it estimated included “social
risk”, this does not appear in their report,'>!* which is why the Tribunal concludes that RPA did
not take specific account of social risk. In addition, RPA’s model assumes that 100% of what is

1519

characterized as resource is mineable,'*'” which seems to run counter to what the Parties’ experts

themselves have accepted regarding the uncertainty of a project without a prefeasibility study.

On the other hand, FTI, the Claimant’s expert, notes that the analysts considered and discarded
the comparables approach — the method adopted by RPA — and opted for a discounted cash flow

valuation, a method that FTI discarded.'*”° That is, the analysts who prepared one of the variables

used by FTI applied a valuation method that FTI discarded as not viable and, in spite of that, FTI

assigned a 25% specific weighting to that valuation.

Finally, it is undisputed that, for a mining project to be economically viable, the metals at issue
not only need to exist, but must also be economically mineable. A very elementary financial
exercise shows that if the metal exists in the deposit, but the extraction cost exceeds the potential
sale price on the market, the project would not be economically viable. This means that a
comparables exercise should take into consideration, as accurately as possible, the factors that
affect the costs, including, inter alia, the location and depth of the deposit, the minerals
surrounding the deposit, the geological specifications of the location, the conditions of the
country, and a full analysis of access. The comparison suggested by RPA does not analyze these
aspects at a sufficiently detailed level to be convincing that the operation costs of the projects

cc and their ic viability, are ble to those of Malku Khota.

 

FTI assigns the valuation performed by the analysists, one of the sources that FTI identifies, a
weight of 25% in the valuation for compensation. As the Tribunal has already noted at paragraph
835, there is no convincing explanation for how and why these percentages were assigned.
However, in addition, in the case of the analysts there are further issues that seriously call into

question the consistency and objectivity of the methodology used.

In fact, on the one hand, the analysts valued the Project with the discounted cash flow method, a
method that FTI as the Claimant’s expert considers inappropriate for the valuation of Malku
Khota.'*?! FTI explains that the analysists’ role is different from the role of damage experts in an
arbitration,“ but, it fails to satisfactorily explain the reasons for giving a specific 25% weighting

in a calculation performed through a method that, according to FTI itself, is not appropriate.

Nonetheless, the Tribunal also notes the lack of a validation or verification of the estimates
provided by the analysts, who differ substantially in their valuations for Malku Khota, ranging
between US$ 195.9 million (Byron) and US$ 922.2 million (Edison). This difference,

additionally, is due to the analysts’ personal views, as recognized by the expert Cooper. '***4

PCA Case No. 2013-15
Award

The analysts’ models, based on a discounted cash flow model, were also not the object of due
diligence by the expert Cooper!** and were accepted in spite of the fact that none of the experts

consider that a discounted cash flow valuation is appropriate for the current stage of the Project.

The circumstances mentioned result in an extremely high uncertainty regarding the analysts’
estimate, which prevents a valuer from having any degree of certainty over the value of Malku

Khota.

Regarding private placements, to which FTI assigns a 25% specific weighting in the valuation,
these are placements from April/May 2012 and the Parties’ experts agreed that between the dates
of the placements and the date the expropriation was made public — July 2012 — circumstances
that affected the value of the Company’s shares, including a 13% reduction in the silver spot price
that is, according to both Parties, the most prevalent metal in Malku Khota.'°*° The Tribunal finds
that a significant variation in the prices of the most prevalent metal affects the asset’s value and,
therefore, the value of the company who owns it, which is why the value at the date of the private
placements was higher than the value at the date of expropriation. For this reason, it was necessary

to make adjustments to determine the value of a placement at the time of expropriation. !*?”

In summary, the valuation method put forward by FTI is subject to uncertainties that do not permit
even a reasonable level of conviction regarding which could be the Project’s value. This was a
valuation subject to a high degree of contingencies, to the development of hypotheses, and to
subjective appreciation criteria in light of the absence of objective grounds. In the view of the
Tribunal, this results from the clear difficulty of valuing with any degree of precision and
objectivity a project that, as indicated at paragraphs 808 to 823 above, is at an incipient stage,
without mining activity, with a significant amount of exploration still to be done, without a
prefeasibility study and subject to serious uncertainties covering not only the technical aspects,
including the uncertainty of using the untested Metallurgical Process, but also the real scope of
the resources and their marketability given the lack of a degree of certainty with respect to the
costs to attain commercially viable exploitation. It is, in the end, a project at an almost embryonic

stage that precludes a valuation with the required certainty as to its actual value.

'526 On the price drop for silver see FTI examination (Hearing Transcript, Day 8, 1450:21-1451:14 (English). In addition, there
was a decline in the values at the Toronto Stock Exchange and the values of other mining companies that FTI considered
comparable to the Project for its valuation (RER-5, Second Brattle Report, § IV-C).

858. Based on the reasons above, the Tribunal finds that the valuation proposed by the Claimant cannot
be accepted and, thus, in accordance with the text of paragraph 831 above, the Tribunal will first
determine the applicability of the cost-based valuation method of the Project and then the

components of such approach in the present case before the Tribunal.

859. Cost-based valuation is not foreign to international investment arbitration. In various
circumstances, tribunals have discarded other methods in favor of the valuation by reference to

actual investments or cost of investment!’ for reasons such as that the project is not in the

1529

production stage,'°*’ or that, given the stage of the project, the estimation of future cash flows

1530

would be wholly speculative,’°’ or that there is an insufficiently solid basis on which to calculate

profits or growth,'™*! or that it is not a going concern and there are uncertainties regarding future

1532

income and costs,'’* or that there is a particularly large difference between the investments made

and the compensation claimed.'°*°

860. Although the Respondent’s expert notes that his cost estimate was not performed with a view to

establishing fair market value, he does not take a defined legal position on the issue — and

1534

expressly disavows doing so'***— and thus does not discard the possibility that a cost-based

valuation might correspond to fair market value. In turn, the Claimant’s expert has recognized

that a cost-based valuation may be used to determine fair market value. !**°

861. Therefore, the Tribunal must decide whether or not, considering the facts established in this
arbitration, from the point of view of the law and the Treaty, a cost-based valuation can be used

to determine the value of the investment.
862. The Claimant does not agree with a cost-based valuation for several fundamental reasons:

(a) It would be inconsistent with the terms of the Treaty which specifically refers to the “market

value of the investment” which is the fair market value, a key principle of which is that

value is a function of the future cash flows that the Project would generate over its

lifetime. !°7°

(b) It would be inconsistent with internationally accepted standards for the valuation of mineral
properties at the stage of development of Malku Khota, as set out in guidelines in Canada,

South Africa and Australia.'°*7

(c) It would not wipe out the consequences of the alleged breaches of the Treaty incurred in by

the Respondent.!**

(d) It would not provide compensation for the lost return on the risks incurred upto the date of
violation of the Treaty or for the lost opportunity to earn additional returns by continuing

to advance the Project’s development towards the production stage. '**?

(e) The Claimant also argues that, if a State could take a mining project once the investor has
made a significant discovery and only pay the direct costs expended, no rational investor
would invest in such exploration activities as they would face all of the downside risk and

the State would reap all of the upside potential. '*“°

The Claimant assumes, in several of the arguments noted above, that the Reversion did not fulfill
the public purpose and social benefit requirements, or due process. The Tribunal noted that the

Reversion fulfilled these requirements, and will not revisit this point.

As to the Claimant’s assertions on valuation, the Tribunal agrees that the evidence provided
demonstrates that it is a mining project in a development stage that allows for the estimation with
some degree of certainty of the Project’s value as an asset of CMMK. However, as the Tribunal
has already discussed at length at paragraphs 808 to 857 of the award, there is no basis to attach
any certainty to such a value, first, because it is a project at an incipient stage that is not in the
development stage as the Claimant argues and, second, because even if it was theoretically at such
stage of development, the valuation method proposed by the Claimant has a high level of
uncertainty, which prevents the Tribunal from reaching any reasonable degree of certainty as to

the existence and amount of the alleged damages.

PCA Case No. 2013-15
Award

It is true that the Treaty requires compensation for the “market value of the investment” and that
this should be fair value, as stated in Article 5 of the Treaty. However, in the case before the
Tribunal, this does not mean that compensation must be tied to the productivity of the Project
which would in turn impact the value of the shares held indirectly by SAS in CMMK. It is
undisputed that this is a Project that is not in the production stage. If it is not possible to estimate
the value of the Project by applying the discounted cash flow method since it is not a project in
the production stage, as the experts for both Parties accept; if it is not possible to value the Project
on the basis of comparable projects, which do not appear to exist in this case; if, as the Tribunal
has noted, there is no evidence of the economic viability of the Project with which to estimate its
value with some degree of certainty; and if there is no reliable evidence that confers any degree
of certainty as to the value at which SAS’ shares are traded in the market, then the market value
of such shares would have to be determined by reference to CMMK’s value, which for the
purposes of compensation and on the basis of the evidence in the record, corresponds to the value

of what CMMK invested in the Project.

The Tribunal proceeds then to determine the value of compensation based on costs, i.e. the value

of the investment made by CMMK in the Project.

The Parties’ experts agree that exploration costs account for US$18.7 million.'**' However, the
Parties disagree on two points of the cost-based valuation: (i) the Claimant considers that US$12.5
million accounting for general and administrative expenses should be added,'* which is opposed
by the Respondent, and (ii) Bolivia considers that the value of the confidential information held

by the Claimant must be subtracted,'** which SAS rejects.

Regarding the first of the issues mentioned, the Tribunal does not find evidence that the amount
of US$12.5 million claimed by the Claimant corresponds to SAS’ general and administrative

expenses attributable to the Project.

First, the record does not contain financial statements of SAS, but those of its parent, SASC, and
this company has expenses that are not associated only with CMMK’s operation but also with
different projects. The Tribunal is not convinced that the administrative costs recorded on SASC’s
financial statements can be apportioned simply by applying a percentage based only on the
relative value of each of SASC’s projects without even attempting to establish a proportional

relationship between administrative costs and project value. Second, there is no evidence that the

'S RER-3, First Brattle Report, para. 165; CER-4, Second FTI Report, para. 9.4.

Award

administrative and general costs included by FTI in Appendix 6 to their Report bear a causal
relationship with the Project. Third, in CMMK’s financial statements it is not possible to identify,
from an accounting perspective, the administrative and general expenses supposedly incurred by
the direct and indirect shareholders on their own or during the development of the Project. Such
financial statements only reflect accounts payable to SASC for approximately US$6 million

included in the US$18.7 million charged to the Project’s costs by the experts.

In sum, it has not been established that the US$12.5 million that the Claimant claims corresponds
to administrative and general costs of SAS which are exclusively attributable to CMMK’s
operations. Therefore, the addition of US$12.5 million requested by the Claimant cannot be

accepted.

Regarding Bolivia’s request to deduct the value of the Protected Information, the Tribunal finds
such claim contradictory in two respects. First, as the Tribunal has noted, the Respondent has held
since the issuance of the Reversion Decree that compensation would depend on the value of the
investments, without referencing potential deductions on account of the Protected Information.
Second, since the Respondent alleged that there are serious doubts as to the effectiveness and use
of a significant portion of the Protected Information for this Project given its stage of development
and the fact that it had not been used in the field, it would not be appropriate, on the one hand, to
ignore the Protected Information for the purposes of determining the future viability of the Project
and, on the other hand, to assign it a value such as the one alleged by the Respondent based on

the possibility of selling it to a third party.

The Tribunal has already found that it has not been shown that the extraction process included in
the Protected Information can be successfully used in the Project and that, along with the other
factors previously assessed, impedes having any degree of certainty as to the Project’s viability.
In any event, the level of development and market value of this information are completely
uncertain, making any valuation arbitrary. The Tribunal cannot speculate on the value of the
Protected Information for a purported future developer of the Project and assign it a value that
has not been proven in the proceedings. Consequently, the Tribunal will not deduct from the
compensation to be provided by Bolivia any amount on account of the Protected Information. As
a result, the amount of compensation corresponds to the costs incurred in the Project, i.e. the

amount of US$18.7 million, without any deductions for the value of the Protected Information.

Considering the Tribunal’s decision regarding the valuation method, the Date of Valuation, which
was an important difference in a valuation scenario based on the valuation method proposed by

the Claimant and the alternative system proposed in the Respondent’s Rejoinder, is immaterial to

247

874.

876.

877.

878.

PCA Case No. 2013-15
Award

a cost-based valuation since the market changes between the dates disputed by the Parties do not

affect the determination of the Project’s costs.

Having established the method to determine compensation, the Tribunal will now examine
whether a reduction should be applied based on the Claimant’s conduct, as alleged by Bolivia.
Indeed, in the Counter-Memorial and in the subseq briefs, the Respond quested, in the
event that the Tribunal were to order that compensation be paid to the Claimant, that the amount
of such compensation be reduced by at least 75% on the basis that “the actions and omissions of
the Claimant itself were the ones that contributed to the damage that it alleges to have

suffered.”

In the present case, the Tribunal has found that the State’s sovereign decision to expropriate the
Mining Concessions was the result of a severe and prolonged social conflict that originated with
the Project. In other words, the Tribunal found that the expropriation complied with the
requirements of public purpose and social benefit established in Article 5 of the Treaty. In this
case, the violation of the Treaty arose from Bolivia’s failure to compensate or offer to provide
compensation, a violation that, as established by the Tribunal, is not attributable to the investor
nor is based on the conduct that the Respondent attributes to the investor. The Tribunal may not
reduce the amount of compensation owed to the investor for a Treaty violation unrelated to its

conduct.

Additionally, even if the investor or CMMK contributed to the social conflict that led to the
Reversion, the sovereign decision to expropriate the Mining Concessions deprived them from the

possibility of continuing with the development of the Project and of receiving any benefit

Given the above, the Tribunal will examine the question of interest on the amount of

compensation.

Based on Article 5(1) of the Treaty, compensation shall “include interest at a normal commercial
or legal rate, whichever is applicable in the territory of the expropriating Contracting Part, until

the date of payment.”

For the Claimant’s experts, the applicable rate should be the statutory interest rate fixed at 6%
and, alternatively, a commercial interest rate based on a | year risk-free rate on US Treasury bills
plus a premium, and they add that the LIBOR rate could be used as benchmark, even if that is the
rate at which banks lend to one another.'** In its Second Report, FTI presented an alternative rate
based on the award in the Rurelec v. Bolivia case that reflects the interest rate set by the Central

Bank of Bolivia.'*“°

The Respondent’s experts, for their part, calculate the interest rate based on the commercial

interest rate derived from Bolivia’s 10-year sovereign bond issuance in October 2012.'”

The Parties do not dispute that interest should compensate for the remuneration the Claimant
would have received on the amount of compensation paid by Bolivia, had such compensation
been paid at the date of expropriation. They do not dispute either that the applicable rate shall be
a rate “applicable in the territory of the expropriating Contracting Party,” based on Article 5 of

the Treaty.

This means that the applicable rate shall be, in accordance with the Treaty, one applicable in the

territory of Bolivia and that it can be a commercial or legal interest rate.

Regarding the statutory rate of 6% applied by the Claimant’s expert, the Tribunal does not find
that this expert has presented financial support for the application of such interest rate, other than
that he was instructed to use it.'** The Claimant also does not put forward any legal reason why
the statutory interest rate would be applicable in this case. Bolivia, in turn, considers that the
statutory interest rate is a maximum rate which cannot be exceeded under the law of Bolivia and,

therefore, it cannot be the rate applicable in this case.'*”

On the contrary, before referencing the instructions received, the Claimant’s expert agrees with
the Respondent’s expert that the interest should be the commercial interest rate taken as a

benchmark with the addition of a premium.'**°

Similarly, the experts agree on the risk-free rate of the US Treasury bills plus a premium, but they

differ in (a) the term of the US Treasury bills, which should be one year, according to the Claimant,

or one month, according to the Respondent;'**! and (b) how to determine the margin or premium

on the base rate.

886. The Treaty, as previously reiterated, establishes that compensation “shall include interest at a

normal commercial or legal rate, whichever is applicable in the territory of the expropriating
Contracting Party.” It is, first, a normal commercial or legal interest rate and, second, an interest

rate applicable in the territory of Bolivia.

887. The Tribunal considers as a starting point that the terms of Article 5 of the Treaty are binding on

this Tribunal. Additionally, the interest rate to be applied shall be a “normal” rate and shall take
into account the rate to be applied in the territory of Bolivia, which implies a limitation of the
potential interest rates to be considered by the Tribunal. Only the “normal” rates applicable in the

territory of Bolivia shall be considered.

888. Neither the Treaty nor the law of Bolivia as explained by the Parties establish what a “normal”

commercial interest rate is. As to the statutory rate, the Respondent neither provides an
explanation for the application of an interest rate from the Bolivian Civil Code which seems to be
established for civil obligations rather than commercial operations or bank loans, nor provides a
persuasive argument when it argues that, under the Law of Bolivia, the Civil Code, and not the
commercial or bank regulations, establishes the rules and limits to the interest rates for
commercial operations. Bolivia itself argues that the statutory interest rate has a marginal
commercial application in Civil Law countries!** leaving the Tribunal with no reason to apply

such interest rate or its limits to purely civil matters.

889. The Tribunal agrees with Bolivia that to establish an interest rate based on the risks SAS would

1551

have faced if it invested the money or SAS’ risk as a lender would be inappropriate — and,
moreover, speculative given the circumstances of the case in light of the uncertainty of how each
investor may invest the funds — but it does not agree that the “normal” interest rate should reflect
only the US Treasury bill rate without any premium. Even under Bolivia’s theory, the debtor of
the compensation is the Respondent and the Respondent’s obligations, as reflected in the very
same rate for the Bolivian bills put forward by Bolivia, are subject to an additional premium

attributable to the risk over and above the risk-free rate.

The Claimant’s expert proposes the interest rate certified by the Central Bank of Bolivia for

1593

dollar-denominated commercial loans;'*** the Respondent’s expert argues that such a rate is not

applicable since the interest rates established by the central banks are not necessarily commercial

rates determined by the market and can reflect monetary policies that are unrelated to this case. !***

The Tribunal agrees with the rate proposed by the Claimant. First, because the rate of the Central
Bank of Bolivia referred to by the Claimant is not a rate established by the aforementioned bank,
but a rate that the bank certifies or publishes taking into account various interest rates used by
various financial players. Consequently, the Tribunal does not find support for the assertion that
these are rates that are not determined by the market or that they are fixed for economic policy
reasons. Second, given that these are the rates for commercial and financial operations in Bolivia,

they are a normal commercial rate in the territory of the Respondent.

Therefore, the Tribunal will fix the interest rate published by the Central Bank of Bolivia as the

applicable interest rate.

Finally, the Parties dispute whether the interest rate should be simple or compound. The Claimant
considers that compound interest is the generally-accepted standard in international investment
arbitration. '**° The Respondent, in turn, invokes Article 412 of the Civil Code of Bolivia, which,

according to Bolivia, precludes the capitalization of interest.

The Tribunal considers that the limiting factor invoked by Bolivia would not apply to commercial
interest rates. Bolivia itself argues that the statutory interest rate is only rarely applied in
commercial matters. The same reasoning would have to apply for the limitations set out in the
Civil Code regarding interest-bearing civil operations. Bolivia does not explain why the limits on
the civil interest rate established in the Civil Code would apply to the commercial operations or
if the limits in the Civil Code- including the alleged maximum rate of 6% — apply to commercial
operations, how it is that the interest rates certified by the Central Bank of Bolivia exceed that

purported legal limit.

Additionally, a compound interest rate is a “normal” interest rate in commercial operations and a
rate that has been accepted by several tribunals as an appropriate rate to compensate for the time

value of money.

896. In conclusion, the Respondent shall pay compound interest on the amount of compensation at the

rate previously established.

897. As to the starting date for the accrual of interest, the Tribunal finds that the date shall be the date
the expropriation became effective and Bolivia established the applicability of compensation, i.e.
the date of the Reversion Decree. It is from that date onward that the expropriation became
effective based on the law of Bolivia and the Treaty obligation to provide compensation applied

to Bolivia.

898. Finally, the Parties dispute whether the fair market value standard is applicable to the calculation
of compensation owed for the other Treaty violations alleged by the Claimant. As the Tribunal
did not find any violations of the Treaty other than the breach of the requirement to provide

compensation under Article 5 of the Treaty, the Tribunal need not decide this point.

899. In any event, the Tribunal observes that the Claimant (i) indicated that the Tribunal must award

compensation to the Claimant for the other violations alleged in the event the Tribunal finds that

there was no expropriation, '**° and (ii) claimed the same compensation in each instance — “full

compensation” — regardless of the violation to be found by the Tribunal.'**’ In other words, the
Claimant did not allege or establish that compensation for the alleged violations other than the
expropriation would be based on facts or calculations different from the ones presented for the
expropriation, and the compensation requested by the Claimant for the other violations was also
presented as equivalent and alternative, not additional, to the compensation claimed for

expropriation.

1556 See Statement of Claim and Memorial, para. 194 (“In the unlikely event the Tribunal should determine that Bolivia did not
expropriate South American Silver's investments, either lawfully or unlawfully, the Tribunal must still award compensation to
Claimant if it determines that Bolivia violated one or more of the other substantive standards of protection in the BIT.”)

A. THE CLAIMANT’S POSITION

900. The Claimant requests reimbursement of all recoverable fees and expenses in connection with its
representation in this arbitration pursuant to Articles 40 to 42 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration
Rules.'*°8 Similarly, the Claimant requests that the Tribunal deny the Respondent recovery of its
costs for “failure to make a detailed request” in its statement of costs dated November 28, 2016,
in which, according to the Claimant, “it is not even clear that Bolivia is requesting an award on
costs”, and for all other reasons set forth in this section.'*? The Claimant argues that the
Respondent’s submission ought to be disregarded by the Tribunal, as should any arguments

submitted by the Respondent for the first time with its Comments on Claimant’s Statement of

 

Costs dated December 12, 2016 (“Respondent’s Reply on Costs”), to which the Claimant has

not had an opportunity to respond.'*°°

901. Thus, the Claimant requests this Tribunal to award it all its costs in connection with this

arbitration, plus the corresponding success fees the Claimant is obliged to pay counsel'**! and

 

compound interest at a reasonable rate until the date of Bolivia’s full payment. !°° The Claimant

bases its request on (i) the fact that its costs and expenses are reasonable and appropriate in this

1563

arbitration given the reasons mentioned in the oral and written submissions, '°® and (ii) Bolivia’s

persistent misconduct throughout this proceeding. !**

902. The Claimant’s counsel certifies that the fees and expenses covering the Claimant’s costs were
necessary for the proper conduct of this case, and are reasonable and appropriate in light of the

complexity of this case, its duration, and the amount of damage that Bolivia’s violations of the

 

Treaty have caused to the Claimant’s investment.

903. The Claimant’s costs, fees and total expenses in this arbitral proceeding at the time of drafting the

states: “Counsel for Claimant certifies that Claimant have to date incurred US $6,645,445.59 in total [...]” (added emphasis).
However, in the previous paragraph of the same Costs Submision, it asserts: “Claimant seeks recovery of its costs beginning

the “[w]itnesses’ fees and expenses” (under Article 40(d) of the UNCITRAL Rules), “[flees and

Article 40(e) of the UNCITRAL Rules) and Claimant’s share of Tribunal’s and PCA’s fees and

[t]ranslation services” and “[d]iscovery data processing and storage” (under

expenses. '*°” However, taking into account that the Tribunal may issue further invoices requiring

the Claimant to make additional payments and/or apply prior amounts advanced by the Claimant,

the Claimant submits that it may be necessary to adjust costs. !5*

904. The Claimant states that the line item corresponding to fees owed to King & Spalding will
increase by between US$ 400,000 and US$2 million, '°® depending on the amount of any
award.157

905. The Claimant argues that it is uncontroversial that in cases under the UNCITRAL Rules, the
conduct of the parties may be taken into account by a tribunal in apportioning costs.'°7! In
particular, tribunals have looked to whether parties filed large numbers of procedural requests,
advanced manifestly frivolous claims, engaged in time-wasting tactics and failed to meet

1572

deadlines.'°’* The Claimant argues that the Tribunal should take into account Bolivia’s procedural

misconduct when determining the appropriateness of a decision on costs against the Respondent,

including the reasonableness of the Claimant’s fees and expenses. '*”*

906. The Claimant argues that Bolivia repeatedly obstructed the course of these proceedings through
procedural misconduct and it should be ordered to pay costs.!°"* The Claimant alleges that Bolivia

on several occasions obstructed and delayed the proceedings. Accordingly, the Claimant mentions

Bolivia’ s attempt to challenge arbitrator Prof. Orrego Vicuiia, to submit witness statements at the

record for an arbitral proceeding against Respondent, through October 31, 2016. Counsel for Claimant will submit any relevant
‘fees and expenses incurred by Claimant during November and December 2016 by January 31, 2017.” (added emphasis) Since
the Claimant's Costs Submission is dated November 28, 2016, it is not clear whether the amount claimed includes to the
date of the Statement or only to October 31, 2016. At any rate, and based on the reasons established in the considerations of
the Tribunal, this difference is irrelevant for purposes of the Tribunal’s decision.

frivolous and as an attempt at harassment and intimidation.'°”° The Claimant further argues that
Bolivia submitted two completely new legal arguments in its Rejoinder, violating the Claimant’s
entitlement to due process and causing the Claimant to incur into additional expenses by having

Respondent adopted a posture that was obstructionist!°’8

harassment of the Claimant. '*” Additionally, the Claimant submits that the form of the
Respondent's requests for documents constituted an abuse of the arbitral process as it did not limit
its requests to the designated columns of the Redfern Schedule provided by the Tribunal (pursuant

and tables, beyond the arguments included in the Parties’ Redfern Schedule.'**° Moreover, the
Claimant notes that Bolivia made a frivolous request for documents two and a half months after
the Claimant presented its Reply and seven months after the conclusion of the document

production phase. !5*!

created additional and unnecessary work for the Claimant and the Tribunal, and that the
Respondent’s harassment also took on a personal tone against the Claimant’s witnesses and

the Malku Khota Project, or documents on meetings in Bolivia with potential Chinese partners, and underscores that Minister

Respondent submits that if, par impossible, the Tribunal considers that Bolivia is found liable, the
Tribunal must consider that the “costs follow the event” rule has been qualified to take into account

witnesses with the criminal proceedings.

(c) Inconnection with the Respondent’ s attempt to introduce witness statements in an untimely
manner during the proceedings, the Respondent denies such an accusation and maintains
that, if any Party abused its right to submit evidence, it was SAS.'©° The Respondent refers
to: (i) SAS’ attempt to introduce statements CWS-14 and CWS-15, and the circumstances
surrounding their potential admission into the record, which resulted in four procedural

orders and numerous communications,'°°7

as well as the conditions it attempted to impose
on the management of said statements; '®* (ii) its untimely attempt to introduce
documentary evidence during the proceedings and sections in its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction

that did not refer to jurisdictional issues.'°°

(d) Regarding the Claimant’s criticism of Bolivia’s conduct in connection with document
production, '*!° the Respondent asserts that its request before the beginning of such a
procedural stage was due to SAS’ failure to communicate together with its Statement of
Claim the documents cited by its experts, and notes that its request was accepted by the
Tribunal. '°!' Moreover, the Respondent asserts that the documents pertaining to
COMIBOL’s President’s trip to China mentioned by the Claimant do not exist because

Miranda is lying is unfounded and should be taken into consideration by the Tribunal in

apportioning costs.'°'5

Tribunal must apply the provisions of Guideline No. 14 of the IBA Guidelines on Party

Representation in International Arbitration,'®” which recommend that the Tribunal “consider

misconduct in apportioning the costs of the arbitration.” '6'°

Additionally, the Respondent submits there has not been a delay in the proceedings in light of the
time elapsed between Procedural Order No. | and the Hearing (two years and two months), in
particular taking into account the complexity of the case and that all the issues related to
admissibility, jurisdiction, merits, and quantum have been addressed jointly. '°'’ The Respondent
asserts that the extensions granted by the Tribunal were warranted,'®!* and underscores that the
Claimant also requested extensions, which were partially rejected.'°'? The Respondent further
argues that the extensions that were not granted to Bolivia did not impact on the timeline and

1620

costs, '®”? and that the ones that were granted did not increase SAS’ costs (who does not work on

the case while Bolivia prepares a brief) and some were due to SAS’ own conduct. !!

Finally, the Respondent asserts that the expenses presented by SAS are unjustified and that it has
serious doubts as to their reasonableness. !©” First, the Respondent submits that it considers the
costs claimed by the Claimant to be unreasonable as they are 40% higher than Bolivia’s (before
including in this calculation the success fee that SAS alleges to have offered to its counsel). The
Respondent submits that there are no objective reasons to justify this difference, such as a
substantive difference in the number of briefs, witnesses or experts, or a multiplicity of
claimants.'°* Second, the Respondent alleges that SAS’ failure to break down and itemize costs

raises doubts as to their accuracy. !°*

In this connection, the Respondent draws attention to two issues: (i) a difference (albeit
minimal)'®> in the amount corresponding to deposits paid to the PCA, which is not justified since
both Parties made the same advances to the deposit; '*° (ii) under the item corresponding to SAS’

fees and expenses there is no itemization of the amount for these two items.'°”

In connection with the second issue, the Respondent maintains that, first, the Claimant’s costs
show that some of SAS’ witnesses have been paid a salary by SASC for appearing as witnesses
in this arbitration, which raises serious doubts as to their credibility.'°* The Respondent asserts
that assuming that US$4,631 paid to Mr. Dreisinger (the lowest line item within the category)
covers expenses exclusively, and assuming that other witnesses’ expenses were similar, the
remainder (amounts higher than US$20,000) would have been paid as a “fee” for the presentation
of statements. '°? The Respondent submits that these fees do not fall within “reasonable
compensation for the loss of time incurred by a Witness in testifying and preparing to testify”
allowed under Guideline 25 of the IBA Guidelines on Party Representation in International

Arbitration, and confirms the lack of credibility of SAS’ witnesses.'°*°

The Respondent requests that the Tribunal order the Claimant to reimburse the Respondent all of

the costs incurred in this arbitration.'°!

PCA Case No. 2013-15
Award

Based on the above-mentioned provisions, the Tribunal will now (i) fix the costs of arbitration

and (ii) apportion the costs and other reimbursable expenses based on the UNCITRAL Rules.

The Claimant has made advance payments to cover the costs of the arbitration for
US$701,500,'%* and the Respondent for US$700,000'™, for a total of US$1,401,500 as advance

payment.

The remuneration per hour for the members of the Tribunal was established at paragraphs 12.1
and 12.2 of the Terms of Appointment of March 4, 2014. Based on the remuneration established,
the Tribunals’ fees are US$891,700.'°>

Likewise, at paragraph 12.3 of the Terms of Appointment it was established that the members of
the Tribunal shall be reimbursed for all charges reasonably incurred in connection with the
arbitration. The reasonable charges of the Tribunal, incurred in connection with this arbitration

amount to US$25,023.30.

The PCA has charged the amount of US$167,362.49 for the administration of the case and its
registry and appointing authority services. Other costs of the PCA amount to US$17,414.21, for
a grand total of PCA costs equivalent to US$184,776.70.

Consequently, the total cost of the arbitration amounts to US$1,401,500.

Finally, costs of the legal representation and assistance costs for the Claimant (including fees and
expenses of representatives, experts, and witnesses, and other costs and expenses) amount to
US$6.043.453,79.'%* In turn, the costs of legal representation and assistance for the Respondent
(including fees and expenses of representatives, and experts, and administrative expenses) amount

to US$4, 164,784.34. 17

Article 42(1) of the above-mentioned UNCITRAL Rules provides that “[t]he costs of the
arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party.” However, the same article
provides that the Tribunal may deviate from the general rule and “apportion each of such costs
between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the

circumstances of the case.”

PCA Case No. 2013-15
Award

Both Parties appear to accept that the apportionment of costs depends not only on the outcome of
the case but also on the Parties’ conduct in the course of the arbitration. '** Based on the
applicable provisions and taking account of the considerations presented by the Parties, the
Tribunal will proceed to apportion costs and other recoverable arbitration expenses taking into
account the relative success of the claims and defenses presented by the Parties, as well as their

conduct throughout the proceeding and other circumstances of the case.

Regarding the outcome of the case, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent presented two
objections to the Tribunal’ s jurisdiction and to the admissibility of the Claimant’s claims that were
rejected by the Tribunal in whole. Therefore, it could be considered that in relation to jurisdiction

and admissibility, the Respondent was unsuccessful.

Regarding the merits, the Claimant alleged that Bolivia had breached its obligations under Articles
2, 3, and 5 of the Treaty and claimed compensation for an amount exceeding US$300 million plus
interest. The Tribunal found that the Reversion is a direct expropriation under the Treaty that did
not fulfill the requirement to provide compensation. Similarly, the Tribunal dismissed the defenses
presented by the Respondent based on the exercise of the police powers and the state of necessity.
On the other hand, the Tribunal did not find evidence of the other violations of the Treaty alleged

by the Claimant.

In connection with compensation, the Tribunal found that it amounted to the costs invested in the
Project plus compound interest at the interest rate certified by the Central Bank of Bolivia for
dollar-denominated commercial loans. This sum is far from the amount claimed by the Claimant
as compensation, an amount that was not proven in the arbitration. Based on the foregoing, it

cannot be said that the Respondent was unsuccessful in relation to the merits and compensation.

However, both Parties accuse the other of procedural conduct that resulted in delays and higher
costs for the proceedings. The Tribunal does not deem it necessary to review every instance of
alleged misconduct by the Parties; however, it notes that, there were instances in which both the
Claimant and the Respondent behaved in a manner that did not contribute to the efficient course
of the arbitration. In fact, this arbitration has seen an unusually high number of procedural orders
to address issues raised by both Parties, often outside of the scope of the procedural calendar and
without warning the Tribunal, regarding evidence, handling of confidential information and

procedural issues. Since both Parties behaved in this way, the Tribunal will not assign any specific

262

PCA Case No. 2013-15
Award

weighting to this factor for the apportionment of costs, nor shall it impose on either Party the

obligation to reimburse the other its fees in whole or in part.

935. Finally, the Tribunal does not find any reason to order the payment of interest on the costs of

arbitration.
936. Based on the aforementioned considerations, the Tribunal decides that:

(a) The Claimant shall assume 65% of the arbitration costs noted at paragraph 927 of this

award and the Respondent shall assume the remaining 35%, and

(b) Each Party shall assume their own legal costs and expenses in this arbitration, including
the fees and expenses of their representatives, experts, and witnesses, and other costs and

expenses incurred in connection with the arbitration.

937. This decision shall be recorded in the operative part of this award.
