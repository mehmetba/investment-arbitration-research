On 19 October 2016, the ICSID Secretariat requested the Claimants to provide certain

additional information and clarifications concerning the Request for Arbitration.

On 25 October 2016, the Claimants filed a communication in response to the ICSID
Secretariat’s request of 19 October 2016. This submission was accompanied by Exhibits

C-044 to C-050.

On 28 October 2016, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for
Arbitration, as supplemented by letter of 25 October 2016, in accordance with Article 36(3)
of the ICSID Convention, and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of
Registration, the Acting Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an
arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID’s Rules of
Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (the “Institution

Rules”).

In accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention, the Parties agreed to
constitute the Tribunal as follows: three arbitrators, one to be appointed by each Party and

the third, presiding arbitrator, to be appointed by agreement of the two co-arbitrators.

The Tribunal is composed of Lord Nicholas Phillips Baron of Worth Matravers, a British
national, President, appointed by the co-arbitrators; Mr. Horacio A. Grigera Naon, an
Argentine national, appointed by the Claimants; and Mr. J. Christopher Thomas, QC, a

On 27 April 2017, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for
Arbitration Proceedings (the “Arbitration Rules”), the Secretary-General notified the
Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was
therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Luisa Fernanda Torres, ICSID

Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.

The Expedited Objections Phase

1. The First Session, the Parties’ Written Submissions and Procedural
Applications on Expedited Objections

On 30 May 2017, the Respondent filed Expedited Objections pursuant to Article 10.20.5
of the TPA (the “Expedited Objections”). The objections were accompanied by Exhibits
R-001 to R-014; and Legal Authorities RLA-001 to RLA-044. On 5 June 2017, the

Respondent transmitted Annex A to its Expedited Objections and its supporting materials.

In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), on 6 June 2017, the Tribunal held a first

session with the Parties by videoconference.

Following the first session, the Tribunal and the Parties exchanged various
communications concerning the procedural calendar for the expedited phase. The Tribunal
received: communications from each Party, respectively, on 22 June 2017;
communications from each Party, respectively, on 26 June 2017; a communication from
the Claimants on 29 June 2017, and a communication from the Respondent on 30 June
2017. The Tribunal sent to the Parties communications dated 20, 23, 28 June 2017 and2
July 2017. In this last communication of 2 July 2017, the Tribunal notified the Parties of

its decision regarding the procedural calendar.

On 11 July 2017, on behalfofthe Tribunal, the President of the Tribunal issued Procedural
Order No. 1 embodying the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters and the
decision of the Tribunal on the disputed issues. Procedural Order No. | provides, inter
alia, that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 10 April 2006
except to the extent modified by the TPA, that the procedural language would be English,
and that the place of proceeding would be Washington, DC, United States. Procedural
Order No. 1 also included the schedule for the Expedited Objections phase of the

proceedings.

On 24 July 2017, the Claimants filed their Response to the Expedited Objections pursuant
to Article 10.20.5 of the TPA (the “Response on Expedited Objections”), accompanied
by: three witness statements, by Mr. Erick Calderon, Mr. Roger Hidalgo and Mr. Thomas

20.

21.

R. Kingsbury, respectively; Exhibits C-051 to C-118;3 and Legal Authorities CLA-001 to
CLA-037. The Response on Expedited Objections included an application for a stay of the
expedited proceeding until the Respondent paid the first advance of funds requested in this
case; but following a letter dated 25 July 2017 confirming that the Respondent’s payment
had been received by ICSID on 21 July 2017, the Claimants’ application was withdrawn
by letter dated 26 July 2017.

Having previously consulted with the Parties, on 4 August 2017, the Tribunal (i) informed
the TPA “non-disputing Party,” i.e., the United States of America (“United States” or
“U.S.”)4 of the scheduled date for the Hearing on Expedited Objections (the “Hearing on
Expedited Objections”), and (ii) invited the United States to indicate whether it intended
to make any written or oral submission pursuant to Article 10.20.2 of the TPA, setting a

deadline for such submission.

On 7 August 2017, the Respondent filed its Reply on Expedited Objections pursuant to
Article 10.20.5 of the TPA (the “Reply on Expedited Objections”), accompanied by:
Exhibits R-015 to R-018; and Legal Authorities RLA-001 (REV) and RLA-002 (REV),
and RLA-045 to RLA-068.

On 14 August 2017, the Claimants filed their Rejoinder on Expedited Objections pursuant
to Article 10.20.5 of the TPA (the “Rejoinder on Expedited Objections”), accompanied
by: two witness statements, by Ms. Audrey Williams, and Mr. Thomas R. Kingsbury,
respectively; Exhibits C-119 to C-126; and Legal Authority CLA-038.

On 14 August 2017, the Tribunal invited the Parties to make certain submissions in

anticipation of the Pre-Hearing Call.

On 17 August 2017, the Parties made joint and individual submissions in anticipation of

the Pre-Hearing Call.

> As submitted on 24 July 2017, the pleading was accompanied by Exhibits C-051 to C-097. On 28 July 2017, the
Claimants submitted an amended version, observing that a subset of Exhibits, designated C-098 to C-118, had been
inadvertently omitted in their 24 July 2017 filing. Following a query from the Tribunal, on 2 August 2017, the
Respondent confirmed that it had no objections to these amendments.

4 The United States are referred to as the “non-disputing Party” in the sense of Article 10.29 of the TPA.

On 18 August 2017, pursuant to Section 20.1 of Procedural Order No. 1, a pre-Hearing
organizational call between the Parties and the President of the Tribunal was held by
telephone conference (the “Pre-Hearing Call”), in preparation for the Hearing on
Expedited Objections. During the Pre-Hearing Call, a matter was raised by the President
and discussed with the Parties concerning the timing for oral submissions regarding certain
procedural evidentiary issues arising out of the Parties’ written submissions, and for a
determination by the Tribunal regarding the impact of those issues on the conduct of the

Hearing on Expedited Objections.

On 21 August 2017, following the Pre-Hearing Call, the Respondent submitted (i) an
application under Section 5.2 of Procedural Order No. 1, for reconsideration by the full
Tribunal of the Respondent’s procedural request made during the Pre-Hearing Call that the
session between the Parties and the full Tribunal to resolve the procedural evidentiary
issues and their impact on the conduct of the Hearing on Expedited Objections be held
before the first day of the Hearing (the “Request for Reconsideration”); and (ii) a request
fora formal order from the full Tribunal identifying the specific questions that the Tribunal
wanted the Parties to address before opening arguments at the Hearing on Expedited

Objections (the “Request for Questions”).

On 24 August 2017, the full Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, addressing the
Respondent’s Request for Questions. In the same order, the Claimants were invited to file

observations on the Respondent’s Request for Reconsideration.

On 24 August 2017, the United States confirmed their intent to file a written submission,
pursuant to Article 10.20.2 of the TPA; and it informed the Tribunal that it was still
considering whether it would make an oral submission at the Hearing on Expedited

Objections as well.

On 25 August 2017, the Claimants filed observations on the Respondent’s Request for
Reconsideration of 21 August 2017.

On 28 August 2017, in accordance with the deadlineestablished by the Tribunal, the United
States filed a written submission, pursuant to Article 10.20.2 of the TPA (“U.S. First

Written Submission’).

On 29 August 2017, the full Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, concerning the
Respondent’s Request for Reconsideration of 21 August 2017, and the organization of the

Hearing on Expedited Objections.

Also on 29 August 2017, the Claimants asked the Tribunal to order the Respondent to
provide a supplementary translation of Legal Authority RLA-013. The Claimants’
application attached a supplementary translation of RLA-013 already provided by the
Respondent voluntarily, and requested an order for a further translation. The Respondent

filed observations on this application also on 29 August 2017.

On 30 August 2017, the Tribunal ruled on the Claimants’ application of 29 August 2017.
That same day, the Respondent sent a further communication in response to the Tribunal’s

ruling.

On 1 September 2017, each Party filed observations on the tentative Agenda for the
Hearing on Expedited Objections, andon a few logistical and procedural matters pertaining

to the organization of that Hearing.

On 2 September 2017, the Tribunal approved the Parties’ agreements of 1 September 2017,
and indicated that it would resolve the limited areas of disagreement at the start of the

Hearing on Expedited Objections.

086, and Legal Authorities RLA-001, RLA-027, RL-069 to RLA-168. In the Counter-
Memorial, inter alia, the Respondent asked the Tribunal to exercise its discretion under

make any immediate determination, given that the Respondent had not presented an
objection under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1) or Article 10.20.4 of the TPA. The
Claimants further opposed the Respondent’s request that the Tribunal exercise its
discretion under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(2) to consider whether certain claims where

[...] be dealt with at th[e] merits hearing [...].”7

3. The Post-Hearing Procedure

Following authorization of the Tribunal during the Hearing, '® on 21 August 2019, the
Respondent submitted an index of a Chronological Bundle of the Exhibits deriving from
the Panama court proceedings at issue in this case; and on 26 August 2019, it dispatched

copies of this Chronological Bundle.

On 27 August 2019, the Respondent filed an application arguing that after the Hearing the
Claimants’ merits case was unclear; and asking the Tribunal to instruct the Claimants to
clarify their merits theory, and in particular, to provide a brief summary of the elements of
their denial of justice claim. The application was further discussed at the conclusion of the
VC Hearing on 28 August 2019, in the course of which the Claimants provided their
observations to the Respondent’s application.!7_ Thereafter, by letter of 28 August 2019,

the Tribunal communicated to the Parties its decision not to accede to the Respondent’s

application.
On 30 August 2019, the Parties filed agreed corrections to the transcript of the Hearing.

On 9 September 2019, the Parties filed agreed corrections to the transcript of the VC

Hearing.

On 12 September 2019, the Respondent filed an application seeking leave to add two
further legal authorities to the record, arguing that these were responsive to a new theory
raised by the Claimants at the Hearing. On 19 September 2019, the Claimants provided a
response opposing the application. On 23 September 2019, the Tribunal decided (i) to
grant the Respondent’s application; (ii) to afford the Claimants an opportunity to produce
no more than two responsive legal authorities following receipt of the Respondent’s new
authorities; and (iii) to amend the due date of Post-Hearing Briefs to fall after receipt of the

Claimants’ additional authorities.

On 24 September 2019, the Respondent added Legal Authorities RLA-225 and RLA-226
to the record. On 9 October 2019, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that they had

elected not to submit any additional Legal Authorities in response.

On 15 October 2019, following a joint request by the Parties, the Tribunal also extended

the deadline for submission of the Parties’ Statements of Costs.

On 16 October 2019, the Parties filed their respective Post-Hearing Briefs.

On 23 October 2019, following a request from the Tribunal, the Parties filed combined

versions of their agreed corrections to the transcript of the Hearing and the VC Hearing.

On 30 October 2019, following authorization from the Tribunal, the Parties filed corrected
versions of theirrespective Post-Hearing Briefs, which updated the citations to the Hearing

and VC Hearing transcripts to refer to the final versions.

was closed on 4 August 2020.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND OVERVIEW

These proceedings put in issue the competence and the integrity of the Supreme Court of

the Republic of Panama.

Many of the relevant background facts are set out in the Tribunal’s Decision on Expedited
Objections, dated 13 December 2017 (“the Decision on Expedited Objections”). This
Award should be read with the Decision on Expedited Objections and what follows is a
brief summary of those facts. The most relevant facts are set out in much greater detail

later in this Award (see infra, Section VI.B).

The Claimants, BSLS and BSAM, are United States subsidiaries of a Japanese company,
BSJ. As such they are part of the “Bridgestone Group” of companies. The major part of
the business of the Bridgestone Group, which is carried on internationally, is the
manufacture and sale of tires under the trademarks FIRESTONE and BRIDGESTONE.

Those trademarks have been registered in Panama.

BSLS is the owner of those of the FIRESTONE trademarks that are registered outside the
United States; and BSLS has granted to BSAM a license to use these trademarks.!8 Thus,
BSAM has a license to use the FIRESTONE trademark in Panama that is owned by BSLS.

A wholly owned subsidiary of BSAM called Bridgestone/Firestone North American Tire
LCC, subsequently Bridgestone American Tire Operations, LLC (“BATO”), has been

granted by BSJ a license, inter alia, to sell tires bearing the BRIDGESTONE mark in

Panama. !9

In the Decision on Expedited Objections the Tribunal ruled that BSAM’s ownership of a
license to use the FIRESTONE trademark constituted an “investment” in Panama for the
purposes of the TPA and the ICSID Convention.2° There was no dispute during the
Expedited Objections phase that BSLS’s ownership of the FIRESTONE mark in Panama

constituted an “investment” for the purposes of the TPA and the ICSID Convention.?!

In the Decision on Expedited Objections the Tribunal further ruled that BATO’s license to
use the BRIDGESTONE trademark in Panama constituted an investment in Panama

indirectly owned and controlled by BSAM for the purposes of the TPA. 2

In or about 2001 the Luque Group of companies began to market in Panama and elsewhere
tires manufactured in China bearing the mark RIVERSTONE. Panama appears to be the
administrative centre for this Group, as evidenced by the fact that a number of the
administrators of the group are Panamanian citizens living in Panama and sharing the name

Luque.

On 6 May 2002, Muresa Intertrade S.A. (“Muresa”), a member of the Luque Group,
applied to register the RIVERSTONE trademark for tires in Panama.”? This application
was not gazetted until some three years later,24 whereupon BSJ and BSLS, as owners of
the FIRESTONE and BRIDGESTONE trademarks registered in Panama, issued

proceedings (“the Trademark Opposition Proceeding”) opposing the registration of the

RIVERSTONE mark, on the ground thatthe similarity between the rival trademarks would

give rise to grave risk of confusion. ?5

127. The Trademark Opposition Proceeding was unsuccessful.”° BSJ and BSLS filed an appeal

against its rejection but then withdrew this on 5 September 2006.7

128. Justovera year later, on 12 September 2007, Muresa and Tire Group of Factories Ltd. Inc.
(“TGFL”), a distributor of RIVERSTONE tires, filed in Panama against BSJ and BSLS a
civil tort claim for US $5 million, being losses allegedly suffered in consequence of having
to cease selling RIVERSTONE tires as a result of the Trademark Opposition Proceeding
(“the Civil Proceeding”).** This claim was dismissed at first instance,”? and on appeal.*°
The decision in favour of BSJ and BSLS was then reversed by the Supreme Court, in a
majority judgment dated 28 May 2014 (“the Supreme Court Judgment”), which awarded
US $5 million in damages, plus legal costs, against BSJ and BSLS.+!

129. In the Decision on Expedited Objections, the Tribunal summarised the Claimants’ claims
as they then stood.2? The claims are brought in respect of the investments consisting of the
FIRESTONE trademark, and the licences to use the FIRESTONE and BRIDGESTONE
trademarks. The foundation of the claims is the Supreme Court Judgment. Atthe time of

the Decision on Expedited Objections, the Claimants were advancing claims under Articles

10.3, 10.5 and 10.7 of the TPA.33 Thereafter, with the Memorial, the Claimants advanced
claims under Articles 10.3, 10.4 and 10.5 of the TPA.** In their Reply, the Claimants
withdrew their claims under Articles 10.3 and 10.4, leaving as their sole claim to relief that

advanced under Article 10.5 of the TPA.*5
130. The relevant parts of Article 10.5 provide:

“Article 10.5: Minimum Standard of Treatment.

1. Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment in
accordance with customary international law, including fair and
equitable treatment and full protection and security.

2. For greater certainty, paragraph 1 prescribes the customary
international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the
minimum standard of treatment to be afforded to covered
investments. The concepts of ‘fair and equitable treatment’ and ‘full
protection and security’ do not require treatment in addition to or
beyond that which is required by that standard, and do not create
additional substantive rights. The obligation in paragraph 1 to
provide:

(a) ‘fair and equitable treatment’ includes the obligation not to
deny justice in criminal, civil or administrative adjudicatory
proceedings in accordance with the principle of due process
embodied in the principal legal systems of the world; [...].”3¢

131. The allegation advanced by the Claimants is that their investments were not accorded “fair
and equitable treatment’ in that the Supreme Court Judgment constituteda denial of justice
in civil proceedings.*’ This was the way in which they summarised their case in their Post-

Hearing Brief:3%

“[...] [T]he Supreme Court Judgment [...] made findings that no
honest and competent court could have made. Those
incomprehensible findings permeate every element of the Supreme
Court’s determination, namely the Cassation Recourse, liability

under Article 217 of the Judicial Code, causation and loss. Such
findings, individually and/or collectively, amount to a denial of

132. In short, it is the Claimants’ case that the Supreme Court Judgment treated their
investments in a manner that was not fair or equitable in that (i) the Judgment penalized
BSLS for legitimate steps taken to protect its investment; (ii) the effect of the Judgment
was to devalue the FIRESTONE and BRIDGESTONE trademarks; and (iii) the Judgment
constituted a denial of justice in as much as the defects in the Supreme Court Judgment
were so egregious that they lead inexorably to the conclusion that the Supreme Court was
either incompetent or corrupt. As to the latter possibility, the Claimants have sought to
rely upon a number of peripheral matters as rendering it plausible to conclude that the
Supreme Court Judgment was procured by corruption. A more detailed summary of the

Claimants’ submissions is included below (see infra, Section VLC. l.a).
133. The losses claimed by way of damages are:

(i) _ the award of US$ 5,431,000 made by the Supreme Court, which is claimed by BSLS
alone;??

(ii) damage to the Claimants’ respective “trademark rights” alleged to have been caused
by the Supreme Court Judgment, in excess of the US$ 5,431,000 above. 4?

134. In short, Panama denies that it is under any liability to the Claimants. BSAM’s standing
to pursue a claim for denial of justice is challenged on the grounds that such a claim can
only be brought by a party to the proceedings in which the alleged denial of justice
occurred, and BSAM was not party to the proceedings before the Supreme Court. Quite
apart from this, Panama contends that the claims advanced by the Claimants are totally
without merit. Panama submits that no breach of duty to either Claimant has been
established, nor has either Claimant established that it has sustained any loss. A more
detailed summary of the Respondent’s submissions is included below (see infra, Section

VLC.1.b).

SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES’ CLAIMS AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF

As noted above, the Claimants ultimately only contend that the Respondent’s actions
constitute violations of Article 10.5 of the TPA.*! In their Reply, the Claimants make the

following request:

“For the reasons set out above and in their Memorial, BSLS and
BSAM respectfully reaffirm their request that the Tribunal render
an award:

(a) Declaring that Panama has violated its obligations under the
TPA;

(b) Ordering Panama to pay damages of between USD 5,988,604
and USD 19,954,541;

(c) Ordering Panama to pay interest on any amount awarded to
BSLS and BSAM;

(d) Ordering Panama to pay attorney’s fees and expenses arising
from these proceedings; and

(e) Granting any further or other relief to BSLS and BSAM that the

Arbitral Tribunal shall deem just and proper.”
As the Tribunal has previously observed, although the Request for Arbitration initially
argued that Panama had committed violations of Article 10.3 (National Treatment), Article
10.5 (Minimum Standard of Treatment) and Article 10.7 (Expropriation) of the TPA;*?
later in the Memorial, the Claimants only argued that the Respondent’s actions constituted
a breach of Article 10.3 (National Treatment), Article 10.4 (Most-Favoured-Nation
Treatment) and Article 10.5 (Minimum Standard of Treatment) of the TPA.#* In the end,
however, the claim for violation of Articles 10.3 and 10.4 of the TPA was withdrawn in

137. In turn, in their Rejoinder, the Respondent makes the following request:

“289. For all of the foregoing reasons, the Republic of Panama
respectfully requests that the Tribunal:

a. Dismiss [BSAM’s] claim under Article 10.5 ofthe TPA for
lack of standing, or in the alternative, reject such claim for
lack of merit;

b. Reject [BSLS’s] claim under Article 10.5 of the TPA for
lack of merit;

c. In any event, reject (1) [BSLS’s] claim to recover the USD
5.431 million in damages awarded to Muresa and [TGFL];
and (2) Claimants’ claim for compensation in excess of USD
5.431 million; and

290. Award to Panama, with interest, all costs of the arbitration,
including all attorneys’ fees, and costs and expenses of Panama.” 46

138. In the Statement of Costs, the Respondent presented the following amended request for

relief:

“For the reasons set forth in Panama’s written and oral submissions,
Panama respectfully requests that the Tribunal grant the following
relief:

a. dismiss, for lack of standing or merit, [BSAM’s] claim under
Article 10.5 of the TPA;

b. dismiss, for lack of merit, [BSLS’s] claim under Article10.5 of
the TPA;

c, in any event, reject both Claimants’ damages claims (1) for being
untethered from any genuine injury caused by the Supreme Court
Judgment to Claimants’ respective investments, and (2) for
exceeding the TPA’s territorial limits on damages;

d. order Claimants, jointly and severally, to pay USD 600,000 to
cover Panama’s costs advances to ICSID, and USD 8,006,906.00 to
cover the legal fees and expenses incurred by Panama during this
proceeding, plus interest on these amounts at the Wall Street Journal

Prime Rate plus 2% per annum from the date of the Award to the
date of full payment; and

e. order Claimants to pay any additional costs, including legal fees
and expenses, incurred by Panama after 31 October 2019, but before
the Tribunal renders its Award, plus interest at the rate specified in
sub-paragraph (d) above.”47
139. The Parties’ respective positions are summarized in the sections that follow. The Tribunal
emphasizes that it has considered the Parties’ arguments in their written and oral

submissions in their entirety, irrespective of whether an argument is referred to expressly

in the summary of the Parties’ positions in this Award.

Vv. JURISDICTION

140. The Claimants contend that under the TPA, the Tribunal has jurisdiction over measures
adopted or maintained by a TPA Party relating to investors of the other TPA Party and their
covered investments;*8 and note that pursuant to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, the
Centre’s jurisdiction extends to “any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment.”*9

According to the Claimants, these requirements are met by each BSLS and BSAM.*°

141. The Claimants submit that BSLS (i) holds intellectual property rights in Panama (the
FIRESTONE trademark registered in Panama) that qualify as an “investment” under the
TPA;°! (ii) qualifies as an “investor” of another TPA Party, namely the United States;*?
and (iii) has a dispute arising directly out of its investment as the Tribunal has already
determined.*3 In turn, BSAM (i) holds intellectual property rights in Panama (the licenses
to use the BRIDGESTONE and FIRESTONE trademarks in Panama) that qualify as an

“investment” under the TPA, as the Tribunal has already determined; * (ii) qualifies as an
“investor” of another TPA Party, namely the United States;55 and (iii) has a dispute arising

directly out of its investment. °°

142. In turn, the Respondent argues that the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is derived from the terms of
the Parties’ consent to arbitration, which in this case is found in Article 10.17 of the TPA
read together with Article 10.16 of the TPA.*’ Panama points out that under Article 10.17
of the TPA, consent refers to the “submission of a claim to arbitration,” and Article 10.16
identifies the rules that govern the submission ofa claim, three of which reveal “threshold

defects” in the Claimants’ case:°8

e First, Panama submits that under Article 10.16 of the TPA only a “claimant” is
permitted to advance a claim, and a “claimant” refers to “an investor of a Party” as
the term is defined in Article 10.29 of the TPA.*? It follows, the Respondent argues,
that BSJ cannot advance any claims as it does not have the required nationality.

. Second, the Respondent argues that “a claimant may not asserta claim on behalf of
another entity, or on the basis of another entity’s investment.”®' Accordingly, the
Respondent says, claims made on behalf of the “Bridgestone group” are
impermissible and the Tribunal must examine BSLS and BSAM’s claim separately,
as different entities with different investments that have different values.

. Third, Panama contends that “a claimant may not assert a claim in respect of an
alleged investment outside of Panama.” This is, the Respondent argues, because
under the TPA, only a “c/aiman?” might bring a claim, it can only do it on its own
behalf, and the definition of “claimant” operates around the existence of an
investment in Panama, as does the scope and coverage of Chapter 10 of the TPA.

143. The application of these rules, Panama says, leads to the conclusion that neither of the
Claimants has “advanced a cognizable claim.” More particularly, the Respondent
submits that: (i) BSAM has failed to establish a prima facie case for a single breach of the
TPA, in particular, because it cannot formulate a claim under Article 10.5 of the TPA for
denial of justice on the basis of a proceeding to which it was not a party; (ii) BSAM has
“failed to satisfy the jurisdictional requirement of establishing loss;” and (iii) BSLS “has
failed to establish that it has ‘incurred’ loss” which is a “threshold jurisdictional

requirement.”

A. BSAM’s Standing to Advance a Claim Founded on an Allegation of Denial of Justice
1. The Parties’ Positions

a. The Respondent’s Position

144. According to Panama, BSAM’s claim under Article 10.5 fails “at the threshold level,’"
because BSAM cannot assert a claim for denial of justice when it made no effort to
participate in the proceeding that led to the Supreme Court Judgment.® On this basis, the
Respondent asks the Tribunal to exercise its discretion under Rule 41(2) of the ICSID

Arbitration Rules and dismiss BSAM’s claim.

145. The Respondent submits that according to Article 10.16 of the TPA each Claimant must
prove that it “has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of’ a breach by the

Respondent of an obligation in Section A of Chapter 10 of the TPA.”° More specifically,

° Resp.C-Mem.,§ 11.

° Resp. C-Mem., 944-45. The Respondent also argued that BSAM and BSLS had failed to establish a prima facie
case for violation of Articles 10.3 and 10.4 of the TPA, but those claims havebeen withdrawn. Cl. Reply, 75.

“7 Resp.C-Mem.,§ 20. Panama made similar arguments with respectto the initial claims under Article 10.3 and 104
of the TPA, which were ultimately withdrawn. See Resp. C-Mem., {§ 17-19; Cl. Reply,4/75.

at any stage of the proceeding, whether the dispute or any ancillary claim before it is within the jurisdiction of the
Centre andwithinits own competence.”) In the Counter-Memorial, Panama observed that, while it believed that this
issue warranted a preliminary objection under Article 10.20.4 of the TPA, it would forego making that objection in
the interest ofjudicialeconomy. This said, Panama asked for ana ward on costs in fa vour of Panama if the Claimants
insisted in their “frivolous claims.” Resp.C-Mem.,n.70. See also, Resp. C-Mem., f§ 295,299.

the Respondent submits that “the TPA requires that each claimant must separately prove
that (1) specific ‘measure[s] adopted or maintained by [Panama] relating to’ the claimant's
investment in Panama (2) breached an obligation set forth in Section A of TPA Chapter

Ten, and (3) that each claimant has already incurred loss, (4) as a result of that breach.”

According to Panama, BSAM has failed to establish that the Supreme Court Judgment
(issued against two other entities) subjected BSAM to the breach of any standard of
protection arising out of BSAM’s investment in Panama.72 Panama submits that the
Claimants have entirely failed to distinguish their denial of justice claims for BSLS and
BSAM.” For the Respondent, while the Claimants purport to present a section on
BSAM’s claim for denial of justice in their Reply, the argument shows that the denial of

justice claim actually pertains to BSLS and BSJ.”*

And even if BSAM had presented a claim for denial of justice, the Respondent argues,
BSAM does not have standing to bring it.7> Relying on Prof. Paulsson’s expert report, the
Respondent argues that, a party that has not participated or attempted to participate in the
process, or presented any argument in the local proceeding cannot assert a denial of justice
claim.76 Panama further recalls that it is blackletter law that “a person may not allege a
denial of justice unless he has exhausted all available domestic avenues,” and submits that
this rule is fatal for BSAM who neglected to even attempt to participate in the local

proceedings. 7”

While the Respondent accepts that there are circumstances that might allow certain non-
parties to claim a denial of justice (e.g. a parent that owns and controls a subsidiary that is

a party to the local proceeding), it argues that those circumstances are not present here.78

Referring to the situation of a licensor and a licensee of a trademark at the Hearing, the
Respondent argued that no exception could be made to allow the licensee who did not
participate in the proceeding to bring a claim for denial of justice because (i) denial of
justice is inherently procedural; and (ii) while in Panama it is the licensor who polices the
mark and participates in the proceeding, the licensee can participate as well, and if it

decides not to participate, it has waived its right to claim a procedural violation.”?

The Respondent also accepts that the Arif tribunal determined that a denial of justice claim
under an autonomous fair and equitable treatment (“FET”) standard could be brought by a
non-party to the local proceedings at issue, but it adds that the Aviftribunal also found that
this was not the case if the claim for denial of justice was made under customary
international law.*° The Respondent observes that the Claimants have conceded that if
BSAM were bringing a claim under customary international law, it would have no
standing; although the Claimants then argue that BSAM’s claim is under the FET standard
in the TPA.8! Panama contends that the distinction does not assist BSAM because under
the TPA a denial of justice claim for breach of the FET is a claim under customary
international law, as shown by the language in Article 10.5.1. and Article 10.5.2. of the
TPA. ®

Panama also submits that there are no grounds in this case to make an exception from the
customary international law rule on standing, not only because Article 10.5 of the TPA
prescribes the customary international law standard of treatment, but also because
“customary international law” is the product of States’ “general and consistent practice
[...] that they follow from a sense of legal obligation.”*3 As such, only States have the

power to develop exceptions whether through developing new customary international law

or by amending the TPA; and it would constitute an “excess of powers” for a tribunal to

invent an exception. *+

The Respondent also takes issue with the Claimants’ allegation at the Hearing that there is
no need for BSAM to have been personally denied justice, so long as the denial of justice
has deprived BSAM of rights; and submits that this is an untenable theory.*5 Panama
explains that the Claimants’ allegation amounts to the contention that BSAM could
prosecute a treaty breach suffered by somebody else, which is contrary to Article 10.16.1
of the TPA, which provides that BSAM may only assert a claim “on its own behalf’ or “on
behalf of an enterprise [of Panama] that is a juridical person that [BSAM] owns or

controls;” but not on behalf ofa parent or sister. 8°

b. The Claimants’ Position

According to the Claimants, the only remaining jurisdictional question is whether BSAM

has standing to bring a claim for denial of justice.8”

The Claimants submit that BSAM is entitled to bring a claim for denial of justice under the
FET standard in Article 10.5 of the TPA, even though it was not a party to the impugned
local court proceeding. This is, the Claimants argue, because when the denial of justice
claim is brought under a treaty’s FET standard (as distinguished from a claim under
customary international law), there is no need for the claimant to have been a party to the

impugned local proceeding. **

Relying on 4rif, the Claimants submit that a claim under a treaty’s FET standard is capable
of being pursued by those who have a covered investment under the treaty which has been

the subject of a denial of justice; and the protections in Article 10.5 of the TPA apply to

covered investments (not to investors).°° Because BSAM’s investment has a right to the
protections under Article 10.5 ofthe TPA, the Claimants argue, if that standard is breached,
BSAM has a right to be compensated for it, and “[t]here is no need for BSAM to have been
personally denied justice” as “[i]t’s sufficient for denial ofjustice to have taken place which

has deprive BSAM of its rights.”9!

155. The Claimants’ position is that during the Expedited Objections Phase the Tribunal already
concluded that BSAM is able to submit a claim on the basis of the court proceedings that
led to the Supreme Court Judgment.% This is, the Claimants argue, because the Tribunal
found that BSAM has an investment in Panama which was the subject of the Supreme
Court Judgment; and being “an investor in the asset the subject of the Supreme Court
Judgment, BSAM is entitled to the protections of Article 10.5 of the TPA, despite not being

a party to the underlying court proceedings.”

156. The Claimants take issue with the Respondent’s contention that a denial of justice claim
under Article 10.5 of the TPA is a claim under customary international law given the

language of Article 10.5.2 of the TPA.

157. First, according to the Claimants, on the language of Article 10.5. of the TPA, “it appears
that the standard of treatment in the TPA is not just the customary-international-law
standard,” because the provision includes a modifier to the customary international law
standard, namely “the obligation [...] not to deny justice in accordance with the principle
of due process embodied in the principal legal systems of the world.”°> This said,
elsewhere, the Claimants submitted that the “minimum standard under the TPA will be no

greater than the minimum treatment under customary international law.”

Second, in any event, the Claimants submit that the reference in Article 10.5.2 of the TPA
to customary international law refers to the standard of treatment to be applied to covered
investments, and it does not deal with whether an investor has standing to bring a claim

(which is addressed in Articles 10.1, 10.29 and 10.16 of the TPA).%”

Third, the Claimants submit that there are exceptions that allow a non-party to the litigation
to bring a customary international law claim for denial of justice (for example, a parent
company might bring a claim on behalf of the subsidiary where the parent was a non-party
to the litigation), and suggest that such exception should be recognized in a situation
involving the licensor and the licensee of a trademark.** This is, the Claimants argue,
because “a denial of justice affecting BSLS’s trademark rights and BSJ’s trademark rights
directly affect BSAM because it’s the licensee of those rights,” and as such, ““BSAM stands
in the shoes of BSLS and BSJ as the party that enjoys the fruits of the exploitation of the
trademarks owned by BSLS and BSJ{...].”

Therefore, the Claimants argue, even if BSAM’s denial of justice claim were a customary
international law claim, BSAM would have standing to bring such claim, “where its
trademark rights had been the subject of legal proceedings in Panama, and where it had
been denied justice because of the way [...] BSJ [...] and BSLS had been treated by

Panama.” 1

2. The U.S. Submission

In its Third Written Submission the United States advanced the following proposition:!"!

“As a threshold matter, Article 10.5.1 requires a Party to accord
‘treatment’ to a covered investment. Article 10.5.1 differs from
other substantive obligations (e.g., 10.3, 10.4 and 10.6) in that it
obligates a Party to accord treatmentonly toa ‘covered investment.’
The minimum standard of treatment under Article 10.5.1 includes
the obligation to provide ‘fair and equitable treatment,’ which, as

explained in 10.5.2(a), includes the customary international law
obligation not to deny justice in criminal, civil or administrative
adjudicatory proceedings. Therefore, to establish a breach of Article
10.5.1 on the basis of denial of justice, a claimant mustestablish that
the treatment accorded to its covered investment rose to the level of
a denial of justice under customary international law.”

162. Inheroral submission on behalf of the United States, Ms. Thornton emphasized that Article
10.5.1 of the TPA requires a TPA Party to accord treatmentonly to a “covered investment,”
rather than to investors.!°2 Thus, the obligations in Article 10.5 of the TPA, including the
obligation not to deny justice only apply to treatment accorded to covered investments;!03
and a denial of justice claim cannot be arbitrated under Chapter 10 of the TPA if the claim

is for treatment accorded to an investor rather than a covered investment. !4

3. The Tribunal’s Analysis

163. It is Panama’s case that BSAM cannot assert a claim that Panama has not accorded
BSAM’s investments fair and equitable treatment by reason of a denial of justice unless
BSAM was itself party to the proceedings in which the denial of justice occurred. In
support of this case Panama relies upon the Expert Report of Professor Jan Paulsson to this

effect. 1°
164. Professor Paulsson states:

“Because it is intrinsically tied to the treatment afforded to aliens
under municipal law, a claim for denial of justice is limited to the
treatment that a party experiences over the course of a local (often
judicial) proceeding. If a party does not participate in the process, I
fail to see how it could assert a denial of justice claim. This is a
corollary to at least two well-accepted rules. The first is that the
exhaustion of local remedies is a prerequisite to a denial of justice
claim; to exhaust a particular remedy, one necessarily must first
pursue it. The second is the concept of waiver: If a party declines
suo moto to pursue a remedy or argument, it could not properly

claim to have been denied access to the courts or an opportunity to

be heard. There is also a logical fallacy in the notion that a party

could claim that a court violated its right to be heard when that party

did not attemptto participate in the judicial proceedings atissue.”!°°
This passage accurately states the position under international law in respect of a party who
asserts that it has suffered a denial of justice. The Tribunal does not, however, consider
that it can automatically be applied to a complaint under the present Treaty that a “covered
investment” has not been accorded fair and equitable treatment by reason of a denial of
justice. As the United States have pointed out, Article 10.5.1 of the TPA is dealing with
the treatment that must be accorded to the covered investment notto the investor.'°’ Where
a covered investment is unfairly treated by reason of a denial of justice, it is likely that the
investor will be party to the proceedings in which the denial of justice occurs, but this is

not necessarily the case.

For instance, it will not be the case where the investor owns the shares of the company that
owns the investment. Where that company suffers a denial of justice to the detriment of
the investment, the investor can invoke Article 10.5.1. of the TPA even though he was not
party to the proceedings in which the denial of justice occurred. That was the position in

Arif.

In the present case, the relevant issue is not whether BSAM has suffered a denial of justice
but whether the trademark licenses that constitute its investments in Panama have been

denied fair and equitable treatment by reason of a denial of justice.

That is precisely the same question that arises in the case of BSLS in relation to the
FIRESTONE trademark that it owns and has licensed to BSAM. It seems plain to the

Tribunal that the answer to each question must be the same.

On the facts of this case it makes no sense to suggest that BSAM has failed to pursue, or
has waived, an available remedy. The unfair treatment that it alleges has been accorded to

its investment results from an alleged denial of justice in proceedings brought against the

owners of the trademarks whichare the source of BSAM’s investment. BSAMhad nothing

to contribute to these proceedings nor any reason to seek to intervene in them.

In Arif, Mr. Arif claimed as sole shareholder in a Moldovan company that had invested in
Moldova. He claimed for various breaches of the obligations owed to that company under
the relevant BIT. As the tribunal in Arif found,! he alleged denial of justice as botha
breach of the fair and equitable treatment owed in respect of his investment and as a
separate breach of customary international law, and both bases were treated separately by

the parties in that case.
The Arif tribunal held:'

“Conversely to a free-standing claim for denial of justice which can

only be brought by a person that has participated in the national

court proceedings, the standard of fair and equitable treatment also

protects the foreign shareholder in a local company. If the standard

is breached by a denial of justice, the State will be held responsible

towards the indirect investor for a breach of fair and equitable

treatment.”
This Tribunal concurs in that conclusion. In an investment treaty arbitration where a chain
of companies is involved, indirect interests in an investment are recognized,
notwithstanding that this may involve lifting the veil of incorporation. Ifa direct investor
is involved in litigation for the benefit of an investment in which an indirect investor has
an interest, and a denial of justice results in damage to that investment, there seems to be
no reason in principle why it should notbe open to the indirect investor to invoke the denial

of justice as a breach of the obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment to the covered

investment.

of justice, but opines that this consideration is inapposite because BSAM did not own or

control either of the Bridgestone entities that participated in the local proceedings.

In the Tribunal’s view, the solution is found in the TPA’s provisions governing the standing
to bringa claim under the Treaty, notin the rules of customary international law. Whatever
the customary international law rules on espousal might be, in the present case, the TPA
prescribes the rules governing the bringing of claims and thus varies the otherwise
applicable rules of customary international law. Under this Treaty, just as a parent
company holding the requisite nationality can bring a claim for an alleged denial of justice
experienced by its subsidiary (the covered “investment” as defined by Article 10.29
(Definitions)), so too cana licensee holding the requisite nationality bringa claim in respect
of an alleged denial of justice experienced by its covered investment (in this case the
trademark in respect of which the licensee holds rights — again as defined by the TPA). In
both cases an investor/claimant seeks to rely upon duties owed to, and rights held by, its

covered investment.

Moreover, neither Party was able to point to any jurisprudence applicable in the present
context that addressed the relationship of the owner and the licensee ofa trademark. In the
Decision on Expedited Objections, this Tribunal said this of the respective positions of

BSAM and BSLS:!!!

“Tt seems to the Tribunal that the two claims must stand or fall
together. Each claims in respect of its interest in the FIRESTONE
trademark, BSLS as the owner and BSAM as the licensee. Each was
benefitting from the exploitation of the tademark. BSLS’ interest
in the trademark was restricted to the royalties that it was to receive
from BSAM for the use of the trademark. BSAM’s interest was in
the fruits of the exploitation of the trademark. BSAM had relied
upon BSLS to protect the trademark and thus to protect BSAM’s
interest in the trademark. As Ms. Williams explained, BSAM as
licensee could have joined with BSLS in opposing the registration
of the RIVERSTONE trademark. Had it done so, it would no doubt
also have been joined as a defendant in the proceedings that resulted
in the Supreme Court’s judgment.”

'! Decision on Expedited Objections, § 242, cited by the Claimants at Cl. Reply, 413.

42

176.

177.

178.

In these circumstances, given the way in which the TPA has prescribed the rules of standing
and defined “investment,” the answer is clear; there are no cogent reasons of principle to
interpret the TPA as precluding BSAM from alleging a denial of justice on the part of the
Supreme Court as constituting a failure to accord to its covered investment fair and
equitable treatment, in the same way that it is open to BSLS to advance this case. The
merits of so doing are at least as strong as exist in the case of a parent company and its
subsidiary. The objection that BSAM was not a party to the relevant litigation is a
technicality that has no bearing on the substance of the treaty complaint advanced by

BSAM.

In its Rejoinder,!!? Panama sought to distinguish Arif It argued that in that case the
Tribunal had applied an “autonomous” fair and equitable treatment treaty provision that
entitled it to disregard the customary international law standard when considering whether
a denial of justice had infringed that provision. Panama argued that such an approach was
not open to the Claimants in the present case because Article 10.5.1 of the TPA expressly
emphasized that the treatment to be applied to covered investments should be “in
accordance with customary international law.” Furthermore Article 10.5.2 of the TPA

provides that:

“For greater certainty, paragraph I prescribes the customary
international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the
minimum standard of treatment to be afforded to covered
investments. The concepts of ‘fair and equitable treatment’ and ‘full
protection and security’ do not require treatment in addition to or
beyond that which is required by that standard, and do not create
additional substantive rights. The obligation in paragraph 1 to
provide: (a) ‘fairand equitable treatment’ includes the obligation not
to deny justice [...] in accordance with the principle of due process
embodied in the principal legal systems of the world [...].”!3

The Tribunal does notbelieve thatthis passage is in point. The issue is one of locus standi,
not of the standard of treatment to be applied. There is no doubt that, when considering

whether there has been a denial of justice under the TPA, the standard of customary

181.

international law has to be applied. The issue is whether, having regard to the relationship
between BSAM and BSLS, it is open to BSAM to invoke the delict of denial of justice in
relation to litigation in which BSLS but not BSAM was a party. The TPA answers this
question in the affirmative and the Tribunal must give effect to it: BSAM, an “investor,”
has standing to claim in respect of an alleged breach of the TPA that has caused loss or

damage to its “covered investment.”

For the reasons given, Panama’s contention that BSAM has no standing to contend that the
alleged denial of justice constituted a failure to accord to its investment fair and equitable

treatment is dismissed.

BSAM’s Claims for Loss
1. The Parties’ Positions

a. The Respondent’s Position

Panama submits that BSAM has failed “to identify or quantify any loss associated with its
flawed and haphazard claims.”''4 Therefore, Panama says, BSAM has “failed to satisfy

the jurisdictional requirement of establishing loss.”''5

The Respondent explains that BSAM’s alleged loss is premised on the supposed
diminution of value of the BRIDGESTONE and FIRESTONE trademarks both in Panama
and in the BSCR Region, and it argues that such contention is problematic for various

reasons discussed in the sections that follow.!!©

(i) | BSAM’s Claim for Loss Outside of Panama Exceeds the Scope of this
Proceeding
Panama submits that BSAM’s request for compensation for alleged loss outside of Panama
“plainly exceeds the scope of this proceeding.” ''7 Thatis, the Respondentargues, because
(i) under Article 10.16.1(a) of the TPA, the only type of claim that can be submitted to
arbitration is a claim that “the claimant has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or
arising out of’ a breach of an obligation under Section A of Chapter 10;!!8 and (ii) under
Article 10.29 of the TPA, an entity is a “claimant?” if and to the extent that it “attempts to

make, is making, or has made an investment in the territory of [Panama].”'!9

More particularly, the Respondent argues that BSAM’s claim for alleged loss for
diminished value of the BRIDGESTONE and FIRESTONE trademarks both in Panama
and the BSCR Region (Panama, Costa Rica, Puerto Rico, Guatemala and the Dominican
Republic) ignores that trademarks are territorial, and so the Costa Rican, Puerto Rican,
Guatemalan and Dominican Republic trademarks are not part of BSAM’s investment in
Panama. !20 Similar conclusion applies, the Respondent says, to BSAM’s licenses to use

trademarks registered outside of Panama.!2!

The Respondent also submits that this claim was captured by the Tribunal’s Decision on
Expedited Objections; and that the Claimants are transparently attempting to circumvent
the clear instructions in that decision.!22_ Panama observes that the Tribunal already
determined that “there is no ‘immediate cause-and-effect relationship’ between the
Supreme Court judgment and the alleged effects outside Panama” as “the relationship is
speculative and remote;” and that “a dispute as to whether States other than Panama are

likely to copy Panama’s alleged abuse of the Claimants’ intellectual property rights to the

detriment of the Claimants is both speculative and remote from each of the Claimants’

investments.” !3

Panama goes on to submit, however, that even if this were a new damages claim not
captured by the Decision on Expedited Objections, this extra-territorial claim is still
premised on the hypothetical actions of courts in other States, and thus the same reasoning
of the Decision on Expedited Objections would apply to dismiss the “revamped” extra-

territorial damages claim. !24

(ii) BSAM Has Not Identified Its Loss

Panama also submits that the claim foralleged diminution of value of the BRIDGESTONE
and FIRESTONE trademarks refers to the decrease in royalties that a trademark owner
receives from licensees, and argues that such decrease could never be a loss to BSAM who
is the trademark licensee that pays (not receives) those royalties.!25 Furthermore, for
Panama, BSAM is also unable to establish loss because “the value of the license to the
licensee will reflect the fruits of the exploitation of the trademark,” that is, the tire sales
revenues, and the Claimants have admitted that the Supreme Court Judgment has not had
an impacton revenues fromsales. !7° Moreover, the Respondentargues, BSAM’s financial
records confirm the absence ofany injury, as they show that between 2014 and 2017 BSAM
has consistently stated that there have been no impairments for any of its intangible

assets. !27

The Respondent also submits that, contrary to the Claimants’ assertion, the licensor and
the licensee of a trademark do not have an undivided interest in the mark’s goodwill.

Rather, the licensor owns the goodwill and the licensee only has a contractual right to use

the trademark; !?8 and the value of that right is assessed based on the income generated by

it, 129

The Respondent goes on to explain that the Tribunal does not need to determine whether
BSAM “could” establish a loss, given that the reality is that it “has not established such
loss.” 3° For Panama, given that in addition to establishing a breach “the TPA requires
such a showing of loss, the claims by [BSAM] must be rejected at the outset, without further
analysis.”'3! Puta little differently, the Respondent argues that BSAM has not (and is
unable to) show that it has suffered any injury “in connection with its investment (i.e., the
trademark licenses)” as required by Article 10.16.1(a) of the TPA, and therefore, the

Tribunal “need not evaluate [BSAM’s] damages claim on its merits.” '32

b. The Claimants’ Position
(i) BSAM’s Claim for Loss Outside of Panama

The Claimants argue thatthe Tribunal has already made a final determination that BSAM’s
dispute arises directly out of its investment insofar as the claim relates to damages suffered

in Panama. !

As to the claim for damages outside of Panama, the Claimants acknowledge that during
the Expedited Objections phase the Tribunal concluded that BSAM’s dispute did not arise
directly out of its investment with respect to loss suffered outside of Panama, but they
contend that such finding was made with respect to the claims formulated in the Request
for Arbitration on the basis that third States were likely to copy the actions of the Panama

Supreme Court.!34 According to the Claimants, BSAM’s current claim for damages

suffered outside of Panama is premised ona different basis, 35 namely, “on the diminution
of value to BSAM’s trademark rights (wherever that loss occurs) caused directly by the
Panamanian Supreme Court Judgment,” which they submit is a dispute that arises directly

out of BSAM’s investment. !3¢

The Claimants argue that “the impairment to the global marks that resulted in Panama
from the Supreme Court Judgment necessarily creates impairment, and the resulting
economic consequences, in other relevant jurisdictions;” and for this reason their damages
claim also includes impairment of rights in Panama and also “impairment of rights in the
BSCR Region” (namely, Panama, Costa Rica, Puerto Rico, Guatemala, and the Dominican
Republic), which is a region that BSAM treats as a “consolidated marke?” for advertising,

promotion and manufacturing purposes. !37

(ii) BSAM Has Identified Its Loss

The Claimants also oppose the Respondent’s allegation that BSAM’s claim fails to identify

or quantify any loss.

According to the Claimants, where the TPA breach affects intellectual property rights, the
assessment of loss and damages must be undertaken by reference to the specific features
of intellectual property. They explain that BSAM’s investment, namely, the trademark
licenses, is “impacted by Panama’s breach more in terms of a reduction in the value of the
brand than in immediate loss of sales and revenue.”'*® This is, the Claimants argue,
because if the trademark is worth less to BSLS as a licensor because the mark’s
enforceability is legally impaired, it is also worth less to BSAM as licensee, since “BSAM

will not be able to sell tires bearing the brand for as high a price.” 3° According to the

aftermath of the Supreme Court Judgment it is unlikely that BSAM will see a dip in sales, overtime, BSAM may see
such a drop in sales because the Supreme Court Judgment has madeit ea sier for competitors with confusingly similar
marks to enter the market. Cl. Reply, 94.

Claimants, these “economic impacts cannot be discounted simply because they have not

yet been felt.” \0

The Claimants submit that the Parties agree (in part) that BSAM’s interest is in the profits
from sales of products bearing the FIRESTONE and BRIDGESTONE trademarks.!4!
However, they explain that both the trademark owner and the licensee “share in the
intangible benefits” namely, the goodwill and market exclusivity, such that both the owner
and the licensee suffer if those rights are impaired.'42 According to the Claimants, the
trademark owner and licensees eachhavean “undivided interest in the mark’s goodwill.”'43
It does not matter, the Claimants argue, whether the trademark owner or the licensee has
the legal title (“owns”) to the goodwill, because the key point is that BSAM enjoys the
benefits of that goodwill for the FIRESTONE and BRIDGESTONE trademarks, and also

bears any negative repercussion of damages to those brands. !44

Lastly, the Claimants deny that their claims have not articulated the loss of BSAM

separately from that of BSLS, and they submit that their expert report has done so. !45

2. The U.S. Submission

At the Hearing, the United States argued that under the TPA “an investor may only recover
for loss or damage that the Investor incurred in its capacity as an investor ofa party;’ and
therefore “the Investor may only recover for damages it incurred in its capacity as an
investor-seeking to make, making or having made an ‘investment’ in the territory of the

other Party.” \6

3. The Tribunal’s Analysis

For reasons that will become apparent later in this Award, the Tribunal proposes to deal
with the other submissions in relation to jurisdiction relatively briefly. Because the
objections relate to jurisdiction, the Tribunal is only concerned with the allegations that the

Claimants have made, not with whether they have made good those allegations.

a. BSAM’s Claim for Loss Suffered Outside Panama

In its Decision on Expedited Objections, the Tribunal ruled that BSAM’s claims in relation
to loss allegedly suffered outside Panama fell outside the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. This
was on the basis that the alleged loss was founded on the allegation that courts or other
organs of States outside Panama would follow the example of the Panama Supreme Court,
or at least that there would bea perceived risk of their doing so, thereby adversely affecting
the value of trademark rights outside Panama. This part of the dispute could not possibly
be said to arise “directly out of’ either Claimants’ investments.!47 The Tribunal went on

to comment:

“BSLS will no doubt consider carefully whether to pursue a claim
in relation to events outside Panama in circumstances where the
Tribunal has ruled that it has no jurisdiction to entertain an identical
claim by BSAM.” 48

BSAM now purports to pursue a claim for loss suffered outside Panama “made on a
different basis,” as formulated in paragraphs 229 to 237 of their Memorial. '4? The Tribunal
has considered those paragraphs. They aver a drop in the value of the trademark rights

owned by the Claimants because of uncertainty created by the Supreme Court Judgment.

“This creates uncertainty for a potential purchaser of BSLS or
BSAM’s trademark rights: how would future courts deal with
trademark registrations by competitors? Would competitors file
similar damages claims? Would future courts grant those claims, on
the basis of the precedent set in the Supreme Court Judgment?”!5°

200. This is nota claim made “on a different basis.” Itis made on the same basis as the claim
that the Tribunal held to be outside its jurisdiction in its Decision on Expedited Objections.
Panama is right to submit that this claim was captured by the Decision on Expedited
Objections. !5!_ It is not open to BSAM to pursue a claim for loss experienced outside

Panama.

b. BSAM’s Claim for Loss Inside Panama

201. The Tribunal emphasizes again that a challenge to jurisdiction looks at the claims that the
Claimants have made, not the claims that they have made good.'*2 Their claims are not
made foralleged reductionsin royalties or in earnings from the use of the trademarks. They
are made for reductions in the values of their interests in the trademarks. The Claimants
advanced a substantial body of evidence at the Hearing that they alleged made good their
respective claims for losses. The losses alleged were not related to royalties. Panama’s
contention that BSAM’s claim should be rejected in limine on the ground that its pleadings

do not identify or quantify any loss does not succeed.

’s Claims for Loss
1. The Parties’ Positions

a. The Respondent’s Position

202. The Respondent contends that BSLS has failed to demonstrate any loss in connection with
its investment, as required by Article 10.16.1(a) ofthe TPA, and asa result its claims fail. !53
According to Panama, BSLS “has failed to establish that ithas ‘incurred’ loss” whichis a

“threshold jurisdictional requirement’ under the TPA. !54

'S! Resp.C-Mem.,]177.

'S Tn paragraph 44 of the Counter-Memorial Panama appears to contend that establishing a loss is a jurisdictional
requirement under the TPA. Resp. C-Mem., {]44. This is fallacious. It is a jurisdictional requirement that the
Claimants claim to have suffered a loss. Whether the claim is made good depends upon the Tribunal’s evaluation of
the merits. See, R-0001, TPA, Art. 10.16(a)and Art. 10.17.

(i) | The Claim for the Damages Award Ordered by the Supreme Court

With respect to the claim for US$5,43 1,000 that BSJ and BSLS were ordered to pay by the
Supreme Court Judgment, Panama contends that BSLS has not established that this loss
has been incurred, as required by Article 10.16.1(a)(ii) of the TPA.'55 The Respondent
argues that BSLS has not shown that “it actually suffered any economic loss associated
with the payment of’ the Supreme Court Judgment, and as a result, the “inquiry can and

should stop here.” '°6

The Respondent submits that BSLS was merely a “pass-through” agent for the payment of
the funds to Muresa and TGFL, as demonstrated by (i) their own admission in the Request
for Arbitration; (ii) Mr. Kingsbury’s admission thatthe funds used to pay came froma loan
from BSAM; and (iii) the factthat BSLS has not demonstrated that this loan was or is being
repaid.'57 According to Panama, the fact that BSLS paid using a cash inflow from BSAM
is the bestillustration that BSLS “did notincur a financial loss.” !58 The Respondent further
submits that the evidence does not support the assertion that interest is paid on the loan,
and submits that the evidence suggests instead that the loan simply rolls over every year,

and that the obligation to repay it is contingent on the outcome of this arbitration. !°°

Put another way, the Respondentargues that BSLS’s claim for the payment of the judgment
“must be dismissed” because “the financial loss” of the Supreme Court Judgment “was
suffered by another Bridgestone entity; and the TPA “does notallowa Claimantto submit
a claim for injuries suffered entirely by another entity,” but instead requires that “[e]ach

Claimant must establish injury ‘on its own behalf.”'!©

(ii) The Claim for the Alleged Uncertainty Created by the Supreme Court
Judgment
First, Panama submits that BSLS has asserted that it may suffer injury from the
“uncertainty” that might affect hypothetical buyers seeking to acquire trademark rights for
the whole Central American region; and its expert’s calculations include the decrease in
value of the FIRESTONE trademark in other countries.'°! But, Panama says, BSLS’s
claim for damages in connection with investments outside Panama “properly falls outside
of the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.” ' This is because the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is limited
by the terms of the TPA to claims concerning and loss suffered in connection with the

Claimants’ investments in Panama. !6

The Respondent appears to submit that this claim is also captured by the Tribunal’s
Decision on Expedited Objections, and accuses the Claimants of transparently attempting
to circumvent the Tribunal’s instructions there.!°¢ Panama observes, among others, that
“the Tribunal cautioned [BSLS] to ‘consider carefully whether to pursue a claim in
relation to events outside Panama in circumstances where the Tribunal has ruled that it
has no jurisdiction to entertain an identical claim by BSAM.’”'® As in the case of BSAM,
the Respondent also submits with respect to BSLS that, even if this extra-territorial
damages claim were a new one (not covered by the Tribunal’s prior decision), it should be

dismissed as speculative and remote. !66

Second, as to the claim for damages inside Panama, Respondent submits that BSLS has not
even argued that it has “incurred loss or damage” as required by the TPA, and its alleged

injury is entirely hypothetical.! For the Respondent, BSLS’s claim for “hypothetical

injury in Panama, [...] falls outside of the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.” 68 According to
Panama, the TPA specifically requires that the damage “has already been incurred,” it
requires “existing, rather than future loss;” and, therefore, “speculative injury does not fall

within the jurisdictional requirements set forth in the TPA.”

According to Panama, BSLS’s claim relies on the alleged uncertainty to a “potential”
purchaser of the FIRESTONE trademark in Panama.'” But, Panama says, in order to
demonstrate that the alleged uncertainty has affected the value of its investments, BSLS
would need to demonstrate a decrease in the royalties it receives for the use of the
FIRESTONE trademark, yet the royalties have remained the same in the relevant period,
and there has been no decrease in sale of FIRESTONE branded-tires either.!7!_ Moreover,
Respondent argues, BSLS’s own financial records confirm the absence of any injury, as

BSLS Financial Statements show no impairment to the trademarks or the good will. !72

Third, that BSLS’s claims related both to its investments inside and outside of Panama
encompass alleged injury for trademark rights not owned by BSLS (e.g. the
BRIDGESTONE trademark), which is also impermissible under Article 10.16.1 of the
TPA.!73

b. The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants also oppose the Respondent’s allegation that BSLS has not established that

it incurred in the loss it claims.

The Claimants explain that BSLS claims for two categories of loss: (i) the amount of
damages ordered by the Panama Supreme Court; and (ii) damage to the value of the

FIRESTONE trademark. !74

(i) | The Claim for the Damages Award Ordered by the Supreme Court

With regard to this first category, the Claimants submit that the payment to Muresa under
the Supreme Court Judgment was made by BSLS, and it is openly admitted that BSLS
obtained a loan from BSAM for that purpose. That inter-company loan, the Claimants
argue, is not suspicious, nor does it detract from the conclusion that BSLS made the
paymentitself because: intercompany loans are notunusual, BSAM made the loan because
itis the entity responsible for the use of the BRIDGESTONE and FIRESTONE trademarks
in the Americas, and BSLS pays interest to BSAM on that loan.'75_ Further, the Claimants

add, the loan will be repayable to BSAM regardless of the result of this arbitration.!7°

(ii) The Claim for the Damage to the Value of the FIRESTONE Trademark

The Claimants accept that their damages case includes not only impairment of rights in
Panama, but also impairment of rights in the BSCR Region,'”’ but they argue that the

“Claimants’ damages claim relative to the BSCR Region is appropriate and fair.”"78

The Claimants submit that BRIDGESTONE and FIRESTONE are “well-known” global
brands entitled to heighted protection under the Paris Convention and special protections
in international enforcement proceedings, and “the acquisition or loss of well-known status
in one jurisdiction can be used in actions in other jurisdictions against the trademark
owner or its licensee.” 1 It follows, the Claimants argue that, “damage to the well-known
BRIDGESTONE and FIRESTONE marks in Panama (impairment enforceability and
exclusivity) has consequences, realized or as yet unrealized, outside of Panama.” '®° More
particularly, the Claimants say that, “a purchaser or investor in the BRIDGESTONE and
FIRESTONE marks in Panama would likely find not only the trademark rights in Panama

to be impaired by the Supreme Court Judgment, but also the trademark rights in the

operationally-integrated BSCR Region,” because that region is treated as a consolidated

market for advertising, promotion, accounting and manufacturing. '8!

The Claimants also deny that BSLS’s claim for loss in excess of US$ 5.4 million is
hypothetical. They argue that BSLS’s damages case is “real” because the Supreme Court
Judgment “has impaired the value of the FIRESTONE and BRIDGESTONE trademarks
themselves and the licenses to use the trademarks, because of the cloud of uncertainty now
cast over them by this judgment,” even though its immediate impact is not necessarily seen
on sales. !82 They say that because the right of a trademark is a negative right, if the ability
to exclude others is diminished, the value of the trademark is diminished.'*} In the end,
the Claimants say, the effect of the Supreme Court Judgment is that “the Claimants’
trademark rights are impaired and itis as if they have become non-exclusive rights holders,
froma market exclusivity perspective” and “[a] non-exclusive trademark right is obviously

worth less than an exclusive right [...].” !84

2. The Tribunal’s Analysis

a. The Damages Awarded by the Supreme Court

BSLS claims the sum of US$ 5,431,000 that it paid to discharge the Supreme Court
Judgment holding BSJ and BSLS jointly liable for that sum. This Tribunal clearly has
jurisdiction to determine whether this claim is made out. Panama contends that this claim
has not been made out because the evidence shows that the payment has been funded by
other members of the Bridgestone Group. This is nota submission that BSLS has made a

claim that is not within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. Rather it is a claim that BSLS has

not made out that claim on the evidence. This is nota valid challenge to the jurisdiction of

the Tribunal to consider the merits of the claim. It fails for that reason.

b. The Wider Claim for Damage to BSLS’s Investment
(i) Claim for Loss Sustained Outside Panama

The losses that BSLS seeks to allege that it has sustained outside Panama are the same as
those that the Tribunal has ruled to be outside its jurisdiction in the case of BSAM. The
Tribunal upholds Panama’s jurisdictional challenge to this part of BSLS’s claim. It falls
outside the jurisdiction of the Tribunal for the same reasons that apply in the case of

BSAM. !85

(ii) Claim for Loss Sustained Within Panama

Panama’s jurisdictional challenge to this part of BSLS’s claim fails for the same reasons

that the Tribunal has given in respect of BSAM’s parallel claim. '8°

LIABILITY

We now reach the heart of the dispute between the Parties. Did BSJ and BSLS suffer a
denial of justice at the hands of the Supreme Court of Panama, applying the standard ofa

denial of justice under customary international law?

Applicable Law

Whether there has been a denial of justice falls to be determined by applying the principles
and standards of customary international law.!8’ The Claimants found their allegation of
denial of justice on the single decision of the Supreme Court in favour of Muresa and

TGFL. Only in rare circumstances willa single judgmentsatisfy the test of denial of justice

under international law. The Parties are agreed as to what those circumstances are, and

the United States concur.

We turn to the Expert Report of Professor Paulsson, an acknowledged expert in the field

who has been cited by the Claimants in their pleadings and whose evidence on the test of

denial of justice they have notsoughtto test by cross-examination nor, indeed, to challenge

by way of submission. '*8 From this Report the following propositions can be derived:

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

iv)

(v)

An erroneous decision by a national court does not constitute a denial of justice under
international law. A denial of justice under international law will only occur where
there is a systemic failure in the administration of justice by a State. !89

International law does not vest international adjudicators with authority to act as
courts of appeal from national courts. !°°

A bona fide error by a court, even if it results in serious injustice in the individual
case, does not amount to a denial of justice under international law. !9!

An erroneous decision ofa national courtcan demonstrate that there has been a denial
of justice under international law if, but only if, it demonstrates that the court was
guilty of bias, fraud, dishonesty, lack of impartiality or gross incompetence. !9

An exacting standard must be applied to the question of whether a particular judicial
decision demonstrates a systemic failure that amounts to a denial of justice under
international law. That standard normally requires that the decision demonstrates “a
wilful disregard of due process atlaw[...] which shocks, or atleastsurprises, a sense
of judicial propriety.”'?

These propositions are well supported by authority cited by Professor Paulsson, and we

endorse them. Indeed, they have not been challenged by the Claimants. They also accord

with the submissions of the United States. !°* Both the Claimants!% and the Respondent!%

cite the following proposition set out by Professor Paulsson in his work on Denial of

Justice: 197

“[T]he proof of the failed process is that the substance of a decision
is so egregiously wrong that no honest or competent court could
possibly have given it.”

The Claimants submit that this properly describes the decision of the Panama Supreme
Court. They submit that the result achieved by the Supreme Court was simply
incomprehensible. But, at the same time, the Claimants rely on a number of what are
alleged to be departures from due process which, if not individually, together are alleged

to add up to a denial of justice under principles of international law.

To address this case the Tribunal proposes first to set out the relevant events, which consist
largely of legal proceedings, with special concentrationon those aspects of the proceedings

that the Claimants rely upon as constituting, or adding up to, a denial of justice.

The Facts

1. The U.S. Trademark Proceedings

The Luque Group began marketing tyres bearing the RIVERSTONE mark in 1999.198

Muresa was the exclusive owner of that trademark.!°°

On 27 December 2001, Muresa entered into a representation and distribution agreement
with L.V. International, Inc. (“L.V. International’) “for the registry and
commercialization” of products bearing the RIVERSTONE mark in countries that included

the United States.?°

On 13 August 2002, L.V. International filed an application with the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office to register the RIVERSTONE trademark in the United States. 2°!

On 3 December 2003, BFS Brands, LLC and Bridgestone/Firestone North American Tire,
LLC, being members of the Bridgestone Group, filed a Notice of Opposition to this
application on the ground that the RIVERSTONE mark was confusingly similar to the
FIRESTONE mark.” L.V. International originally filed pleadings challenging the Notice
of Opposition, but on 13 August 2004, L.V. International gave notice of withdrawal of
its application to register the RIVERSTONE trademark, which was filed on 20 August
2004. 205

Because the withdrawal was filed unilaterally, rather than by consent, judgment was

entered against L.V. International on 13 October 2004.7

No reason was given for the withdrawal and none has been put in evidence in this

arbitration.

On 3 November 2004, Mr. Mack of the Washington office of Foley & Lardner LLP, an
international law firm, wrote to Mr. Sanchelima of Sanchelima & Associates, P.A., who
had acted for L.V. International in the U.S. proceedings, a letter (“the Foley Letter’) in

the following terms:

2. The Panamanian Trademark Opposition Proceeding

On 6 May 2002, Muresa filed an application to the Panamanian intellectual property office
for registration of the RIVERSTONE trademark for tires.2°8 This was then reviewed and
it was not until 4 February 2005 that the application, together with a number of others of
similar vintage, was published in the Official Gazette.2°? Meanwhile, L.V. International
had applied for registration of the RIVERSTONE trademark in Bolivia, Costa Rica, the

Dominican Republic, Nicaragua and Peru.?!°

On 5 April 2005, BSJ and BSLS took the appropriate steps to oppose the Panamanian
application. These consisted of bringing suit against Muresa in the Eighth Circuit of the
First Judicial District of Panama, which has jurisdiction in trademark disputes.?!! This
opposition petition requested the denial of the application for registration of the

RIVERSTONE trademark. BSJ and BSLS claimed as owners, respectively, of the

BRIDGESTONE and FIRESTONE trademarks registered in Panama. The pleadingrecited
that:

“The plaintiff companies are members of a single corporate group
and representa single group of economic interests, which group has
made itself known for a great many years through the use of the
identifiers BRIDGESTONE and FIRESTONE to identify a broad
range of products in their countries of origin, in Panama, and in
international trade.”?!?

The ground of the application was that the similarity of the trademark RIVERSTONE to
those of BRIDGESTONE and FIRESTONE was so close as to give rise to a grave risk of

confusion between them.

On 20 June 2005, Muresa filed an Answer to BSJ’s and BSLS’s opposition petition,
describing this as “the reckless lawsuit.”?'3 This challenged, at some length, the allegation
that the RIVERSTONE trademark could be confused with the BRIDGESTONE or
FIRESTONE trademarks. It alleged that the RIVERSTONE products were broadly
accepted in the local market whereas this was not true of the BRIDGESTONE and
FIRESTONE products.?!+

On 25 August 2005, L.V. International applied for leave to intervene as a “coadyuvante”
to support Muresa,”!5 on the ground, inter alia, that it had a substantial relationship with

Muresa,?!¢ particulars of which were then provided.

On 26 August 2005, TGFL made a similar application.?!7 These applications were

successful, despite an appeal by the Bridgestone parties. At the evidentiary phase of the

subsequent hearing the Bridgestone parties put in evidence particulars of the U.S.

proceedings,?!8 submitting that these showed:

“[T]hat the prior-use rights held by Plaintiffs are not unknown to
L.V. INTERNATIONAL, INC. and, based on what L.V.
INTERNATIONAL, INC. alleged, they should also be known by
Defendant MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A. by virtue of their
presumed relationship. This leads to the conclusion that the
companies in question are fully aware of Plaintiffs’ superior rights
over the BRIDGESTONE and FIRESTONE brands, and of the ham
caused to Plaintiffs by using and registering a brand similar to
theirs.”2!9

239. On 21 July 2006, the Eighth Circuit Court gave judgment rejecting BSJ’s and BSLS’s
opposition to the registration of the RIVERSTONE trademark.2° The Court accepted that
there were similarities between the respective trademarks, but concluded that these did not
give rise to the risk of confusion. This conclusion was supported by the fact that the
respective brands had co-existed in Panama for some while with no evidence that their co-
existence had caused error, confusion, mistake, misleading or deception in the public or

any detriment to the Bridgestone companies:

“The manner in which opposing trademarks’ presence in the market
has materialized (both the opposing and the disputed trademarks, all
company trademarks) is one of the determinant factors to eliminate
any likelihood of confusion between signs.”!

240. Accordingly, the Court acceded to Muresa’s application to register the RIVERSTONE
trademark. The Court released BSJ and BSLS from the obligation to pay attorney’s fees:

“{G]iven that this administration of justice offices deems that it has
acted with evident good faith, maintained and held its position in the
process, submitted suitable evidence material to prove its standing
in cause, all without abusing the right to litigate.”222

3. The Civil Proceedings

a. The Proceedings at First Instance Before the Eleventh Civil Circuit Court of
the First Judicial Circuit of Panama (“the First Instance Court”)

(i) The Pleadings

242. On 12 September 2007, Muresa and TGFL*> filed in the Eleventh Circuit a civil torts
claim under, inter alia, Article 1644 of the Civil Code,?*° for US$ 5 million and costs
against BSJ and BSLS, due to their opposition to the registration of the RIVERSTONE
trademark.”?’ It was alleged that as a result of this damages and losses were caused to

Muresa and TGFL:

“{G]iven that the product of the brand RIVERSTONE [...] stopped
being commercialized (sold) as a consequence of the suit filed.”228

243. On 13 October 2008, BSLS filed its Answer to the claim.?29 This denied any wrongdoing
and challenged the damages sought. Itcontendedthatif BSLS was to be liable for damages

necessary to demonstrate that BSLS had acted recklessly or in bad faith. It had done

neither, nor had it acted negligently. The Answer commented:

“Tt is worth noting that in a process opposing the registration of the

RIVERSTONE Y DISENO brand filed by BFS BRANDS LLC and

BRIDGESTONE/FIRESTONE NORTH AMERICA TIRE LLC

against L.V. INTERNACIONAL, INC., in the United States of

America, the latter accepted the former’s claims.” 23!
On 19 August 2009, BSJ filed its Answer to the claim.?32. This took the same points that
had been pleaded by BSLS. It denied wrongdoing or causing damage. It alleged that, by
virtue of Article 217 of the Judicial Code, liability could only be established if there had
been “reckless or frivolous procedural conduct and the existence of damage derived from
the said conduct,” and BSJ had been guilty of neither. Indeed, BSJ and BSLS had acted
“in clear good faith,” as the Eighth Circuit Court had expressly found in absolving the

companies from liability in costs.233

On the same day, BSJ and BSLS brought before the Eleventh Circuit Court a Petition for
Nullification on the ground of want of competence.?34 This argued that the facts alleged
gave rise to a claim under Article 217 of the Judicial Code and not to a tort claim under
Article 1644 of the Civil Code. It further alleged that the proceedings concerned a
trademark and therefore fell within the exclusive competence of the Eighth Circuit Court

and should have been brought in the course of the Trademark Opposition Proceeding.

On 14 September 2009, Muresa and TGFL replied, arguing that no issues of intellectual
property were involved and the claim was properly brought as a civil claim for non-

contractual damages pursuant to Article 1228 of the Civil Code.?35 They alleged that the

Trademark Opposition Proceeding had caused them damage because companies with
which they had marketing and distribution contracts refused to market tires bearing the

RIVERSTONE mark through fear of legal action.

The Eleventh Circuit Court did not rule on this issue until the 25 November 2010, and its
ruling was notified on 6 December 2010.73 It then held that the claim was properly

brought in the Eleventh Circuit.

Meanwhile the substantive action was proceeding. There were procedural steps prior to
the taking of evidence (“the Notice of Evidence Phase”), described in paragraphs 88 to 93
of Panama’s Counter-Memorial. These involved giving notice of the evidence that each
party intended to adduce, and objections to the admissibility of some of this. The Foley

Letter was not included by Muresa and TGFL in their notices of evidence.

(ii) The Evidence of Fact

Evidence was taken over a period of weeks, starting on 21 April 2010. Witnesses of fact
were heard between 21 April and 14 May 2010. The transcripts of the evidence given on
behalf of Muresa and TGFL is summarised at some length in the Claimants’ Memorial,?>”
and this summary has not been challenged by Panama. Panama produced its own short
summary of some of this evidence in its Rejoinder,?38 which equally has not been

challenged by the Claimants:

“[...] [C]ommercial customers who previously had purchased
RIVERSTONE tires refused to place new orders, concerned that
they might get caught in the crossfire. To mitigate, Muresa, Tire
Group, and L.V. International sold lower-quality replacement tires,
which (1) ‘were not well received, because [their] customers were
already familiar with the quality of RIVERSTONE,’ and (2) could
only be sold ‘at cost or at 50% of cost.”

253.

The major source of this evidence was Mr. Fernan Jesus Luque Gonzalez and, on analysis,
the most significant part of the evidence given by Muresa’s witnesses consisted of hearsay
evidence emanating from this witness. Accordingly, the Tribunal proposes to set out a

short summary of the evidence that he gave.?39

Mr. Luque Gonzalez was Manager of Muresa and President of TGFL. The latter is
dedicated exclusively to the promotion, exhibition, distribution, productionand exportation
of RIVERSTONE tires. These tires are all produced at factories in China.
BRIDGESTONE and FIRESTONE had challenged RIVERSTONE in the United States,
Argentina, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Colombia, Venezuela, South Africa, South

Korea and China.

Muresa and TGFL’s clients did not want RIVERSTONE products to be shipped because
they feared a seizure or reprisals against them, because they were aware that
RIVERSTONE was being challenged in Panama by BRIDGESTONE.

“Fears of a seizure were based on the information we were given by

customs agents and by some related persons that in the case of a

brand registration challenge we could face seizures, and

consequently, we decided to halt production, we senta letter to our

agent in China instructing him to communicate this to the factory

and that we had also been notified in the Dominican Republic of the

seizure of the inventory that our distributors had in that country.”24°
Mr. Luque Gonzalez said that inferior alternatives were sold in place of RIVERSTONE
products at 50% of cost, but these were not well received. From 2001, when
RIVERSTONE was launched, sales were projected to grow at an annual rate of 30%. After
the dispute in 2007 RIVERSTONE was re-activated but without the expected success
because of the long interruption in supplyingthe brand. Furthermore, the factories in China

initially refused to deal with them.

“Once [sic] of the main reasons for which we stopped selling the
brand is that all of the factories in China and all of our customers

were aware of the dispute and therefore the latter refused to buy and

the former to produce.”4!
Mr. Luque Gonzalez was asked by counsel for the defendants a question put to most of
Muresa’s witnesses of fact.242 Did Muresa atany time receive from BJS orBSLS any letter
or communication requesting Muresa or TGFL to suspend or cease selling products
carrying the RIVERSTONE brand and design in Panama? His answer was that they had
received information from some customs agents and other connected businessmen that

products bearing the RIVERSTONE brand were going to be seized.

Faced with a leading question by the plaintiffs’ representative, Mr. Jorge Albert Luque

Gonzalez, the Manager of L.V. International, was more forthcoming:23

“[...] I informed Ms. LUCINDA DE LUQUE in addition to MR.
EGGIS LUQUE and MR. FERNAN LUQUE of the objection that
existed to the brand in the United States and of the danger that if
they continued to import the tire [sic] they could be seized, this
according to the letter that was sent to us by our attorney JESUS
SANCHEZLIMA. In relation to the letter that he received from the
attorneys for BRIDGESTONE Mr. PETER MACK of the FOLEY
legal firm, where he stated that we could not register and sell the
RIVERSTONE brand in any part of the world and that they could
seize any tire not only in the United States but in any part of the
world where the RIVERSTONE brand was sold or marketed.”

(iii) The Expert Witnesses

The parties had retained accounting experts — Mr. Aguilar and Ms. de Leon for Muresa and
TGFL and Mr. Ochoa forthe Bridgestone companies. Ms. de Gutierrez had been appointed
as accounting expert to the court. They filed their Reports on 24 May 2010.

Affidavits were put in evidence from Muresa’s accountant, Ms. Moreira.2* In these she

stated that sales had fallen by more than 5 million balboas”* in the period 2005 to 2008

“as a result of the presentation of the demand of registry opposition of the brand
RIVERSTONE and design, by societies BRIGSTONE [sic] CORPORATION AND
BRIGSTONE [sic] LICENSING Services Inc.”*46

258. This evidence was supported by the plaintiffs’ expert witnesses when they came to give
oral evidence.47 They stated that for the years 2006-2008 there had been a reduction in
Muresa’s sales of RIVERSTONE tires of B/. 3,351,731.15. In the case of TGFL the
reduction was B/. 2,424,062.69. The former figure had regard to the failure to achieve a

projected increase of sales; the latter was simply based on prior sales.

259. The experts stated that they had asked Muresa why these reductions had occurred. The
company referred to the Foley Letter as an explanation for this. The experts expressed the
view that this, coupled with the Trademark Opposition Proceeding, was responsible for the
shortfall in RIVERSTONE sales, albeit that Muresa continued to sell RIVERSTONE tires
that it had in its warehouses. The experts had annexed the Foley Letter to their Report,

with the following explanation:

“Also, prior to the complaint, on November 3, 2004, Foley &
Lardner LLP Attorneys sent a letter that is attached with the
documents submitted with the expert’s report, which specifies that
the position of Bridgestone/Firestone was to formally request that
L.V. International Inc. abstain from using the brand RIVERSTONE,
not just in the United States but also in all parts of the world.”248
260. The Court expert also annexed the Foley Letter to her Report, remarking that it was the
only thing that Ms. Moreira and Mr. Medina had been able to produce when asked to
produce documentation supporting their evidence that Muresa had been afraid of having
problems if they continued to market tires bearing the RIVERSTONE mark. The judge
subsequently upheld an objection to a question on the ground that this letter had not been

admitted in evidence.?49

While Muresa’s experts supported Muresa’s case on the reduction to sales of

RIVERSTONE tires caused by the opposition to the registration of the RIVERSTONE

mark in Panama, invoking the Foley Letter in support, the Bridgestone companies’ expert

and the Court expert did not do so.

Mr. Ochoa’s Report2™ stated, inter alia:

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

It was not possible to obtain information supporting the veracity of Muresa’s sales
projections.

It was not possible to submit a professional opinion as to why the sales projections
were not met, because it was not possible to obtain supporting documentation.

No documents were seen evidencing concern on the part of customers about
purchasing RIVERSTONE tires.

Ms. de Gutierrez’s Report?5! stated, inter alia:

(i)
(ii)

(iii)

iv)

She did not see documents supporting Muresa’s sales projections.

She did not see any documents that explained any limitation on achieving Muresa’s
sales objectives.

She saw no documentation evidencing concern on behalf of buyers in respect of the
purchase of RIVERSTONE tires.

In relation to the allegation that damages were caused to Muresa because of an
inability to sell RIVERSTONE tires:

“We do not have documents that indicate that they have had to
suspend sales and the projections were not based on any study, also
the question asks what were the damages, by not being able to sell
their products, and the company did not stop selling the
RIVERSTONE tires, therefore we cannot say if there were damages
caused to [...] Muresa [...] if they existed and neither can we say
what the possible causes were of those damages given that there is
no information in the file that would allow us to attribute the
existence of such damages.” 252

(iv) L.V. International’s Intervention

Meanwhile, on 11 May 2010, L.V. International submitted a Petition to intervene? as a
third party coadyuvante. This placed before the court the Foley Letter, and alleged that
this was obviously a threat against the whole group of related companies, including Muresa

and TGFL.

Mr. Jorge Alberto Luque Gonzalez, the President of L.V. International, gave evidence on
14 May 2010.54 He was asked by counsel for the plaintiffs whether he informed Ms.
Lucinda de Luque, legal representative of Muresa, of the objection that had been made to
the RIVERSTONE brand in the United States. Counsel for the defendants unsuccessfully
objected to this question. In reply Mr. Luque Gonzalez stated that he had shown the Foley
Letter not only to Mr. Lucinda de Luque, but to Mr. Eggis Luque and Mr. Fernan Luque.

L.V. International’s Petition was defective, and a corrected version was submitted on 3
June 2010.55 This appears to have been overlooked so that the Court did notrule on this
until 5 May 2011, when the Court’s substantive decision was under appeal. The Court
rejected the Petition on the ground that it had been filed too late in the proceedings, but this

decision was reversed by the Appeal Court. °°

(v) The Closing Submissions

The Foley Letter featured in the parties’ written closing submissions to the First Instance
Court. Muresa alleged that this was the culmination of a series of threats expressing

opposition to the registration, use and sale of RIVERSTONE tires anywhere in the

253 R-0126, Corrected L.V. International Inc. Third-Party Coadyuvante Petition (3 June 2010). The original petition
had been filed on 11 May 2010. See, C-0018, L.V. Intemational Inc. Power of Attorney, Eleventh Circuit Civil Court

world,?57 which confirmed the “malicious acts of intimidation and threats” against the

Muresa Group.

Some six pages of the submissions of BSJ and BSLS were devoted to the Foley Letter.?58
Most of these were directed to attacking the admissibility of the letter. It was conceded
that Article 973 of the Judicial Code permitted experts to receive documents and
information that were relevant to their duties, but it was alleged that the Foley Letter did
not fall into that category. The experts’ duties were to quantify the damage suffered by
Muresa and TGFL as a matter of accountancy. The Foley Letter had no bearing on those
duties. Its introduction violated Articles 871, 877 and 878 of the Judicial Code. The letter

had not been filed at the proper stage of the evidentiary process. It was irrelevant.

The last point raised a question of substance as well as form. It was submitted that the
letter was not capable of constituting intimidation and furthermore that it was never even
seen by Muresa’s personnel. It had been no part of the case advanced by Muresa’s
witnesses that they had been influenced by the letter. It was their evidence that they had
been influenced by the fear of seizure of RIVERSTONE tires as a result of the BSJ’s and

BSLS’s opposition to the registration of the mark.

More broadly, BSJ and BSLS invoked Article 217 of the Judicial Code, contending that
this and not Article 1644 of the Civil Code was the basis of the plaintiffs’ claim to damages.
BSJ and BSLS had not been reckless. The Eighth Court had held that they had “acted with
clear good faith” and this constituted res judicata. Nor had the plaintiffs established their
claim to damages. It had been their case that, as a consequence of BSJ’s and BSLS’s
Trademark Opposition Proceeding, they had ceased selling RIVERSTONE tires, but the
evidence had not supported this case. Insofar as they had stopped selling RIVERSTONE

tires this was in no way attributable to the Trademark Opposition Proceeding.

(vi) The Judgment

On 25 November 2010, the First Instance Court rejected BSJ’s and BSLS’s Petition for
Nullification.259 Itheld thatthe plaintiffs’ claim was for extra-contractual liability pursuant
to Article 1644 of the Civil Code and did not fall within the exclusive competence of the
Eighth Circuit Court.2

On 17 December 2010, the First Instance Court delivered judgment.26! The Court rejected
the defendants’ plea of res judicata on the ground that the necessary identity of parties,
property and claim had not been made out. The Court then accepted a submission made
by the defendants that TGFL, which had merely appeared as intervener in the Trademark

Opposition Proceeding, had no legal standing in the instant suit.

The First Instance Court then turned to the merits of Muresa’s claim in a passage that
occupied approximately four pages of the judgment. The Court observed that the US$ 5
million in damages alleged resulted from the plaintiffs having to stop selling the
RIVERSTONE brand and to sell instead inferior tires, which caused customer complaints
and liability under products warranties. Turning to the evidence the Court found, inter

alia:

(i) The inferior tires had been sold by the plaintiffs before the Trademark Opposition
Proceeding, and continued to be sold thereafter.

(ii) RIVERSTONE tires continued to be sold by Muresa after the commencement of the
Trademark Opposition Proceeding.

(iii) The plaintiff’s evidence was that it was fear of seizure that caused the cease of
production and sales of RIVERSTONE tires, not any judicial order in the Trademark
Opposition Proceeding; nor could such an order have been made in those
proceedings.

(iv) The accountancy evidence, as analysed by the experts, did not reflect the losses
alleged by the plaintiff. Insofar as the claim was based on projected sales for 2005

and 2006 there was no accounting basis for these projections, which were in conflict
with historic sales accounts.
Thus, the emphasis of the judgment was on Muresa’s failure to prove loss. No mention
was made of the Foley Letter, and no ruling on the objection to its admissibility. The
judgment ended with a citation of “Legal Grounds.” These included Article 1644 of the
Civil Code but not Article 217 of the Judicial Code.

Muresa’s claim was accordingly dismissed with costs.

b. The Appeal to the First Superior Court of the First Judicial District of
Panama (“the Appeal Court”) and the Coadyuvante Petition

(i) The Pleadings

On 5 January 2011, Muresa and TGFL filed an Appeal against the decision of the First

262

Instance Court.?°? They contended that the First Instance Court had been wrong to rule

that TGFL lacked legal standing.

The Appellants advanced a claim for US$ 5,775,793.84,2© founded on Article 1644 of the
Civil Code. This dealt at some length with both liability and damages. So far as liability
was concerned, the Foley Letter now featured prominently. The Appellants contended that
the First Instance Court failed to have regard to the fact that BSJ and BSLS “triggered a
campaign of prosecution across all countries where it was attempted to register the
[RIVERSTONE] brand” and made veiled threats in the Foley Letter,?6 which was referred

to repeatedly.

In support of the damages claimed, the Appellants quoted over twenty pages from the
evidence given by their witnesses of fact and their expert witnesses in the First Instance

trial.

On 14 January 2011, BSJ and BSLS filed a lengthy Opposition to the Appeal.2> This took
the point that the claim should properly be based on Article 217 of the Judicial Code, not
Article 1644 of the Civil Code, so that Muresa had to establish recklessness or bad faith.?°
Far from being able to do so, it was Muresa that had been guilty of recklessness and bad
faith in adducing evidence that falsely contended that the Trademark Opposition
Proceeding had prevented Muresa from selling RIVERSTONE tires, when the sale of
RIVERSTONE tires had never ceased. The plaintiffs’ accountancy experts had not spoken

of suspension of sales, but given evidence of an alleged reduction in sales.

The Opposition to the Appeal then attacked the integrity of the plaintiffs’ experts, alleging
that they had improperly introduced into their evidence the Foley Letter, which was
extemporaneous and not an accounting document, thereby depriving the defendants of the
opportunity to deal with it. The Opposition to the Appeal then alleged that the introduction
of the Foley Letter offended against a number of procedural rules, namely Articles 856,
857, 871, 877 and 878 of the Civil Code.2®’ For all these reasons the letter should be

rejected.

The Opposition to the Appeal then proceeded to deal at some length with the plaintiffs’
case on both causation and damages, setting out once more the respects in which

introduction of the Foley Letter would violate rules of procedure.

(ii) The Coadyuvante Petition

By way of entr’acte, the Appeal Court directed that the First Instance Court should rule on
L.V. International’s application to intervene asa third-party Coadyuvante. On 5 May 2011,
the First Instance Court made an Order rejecting that application, on the ground that it had

been made too late.26° On 26 May 2011, L.V. International applied to the Appeal Court

to revoke that Order,?® and declare it a Coadyuvante. The defendants opposed this
application, objecting to:

“[T]he form and substance of each piece of evidence submitted with

the third-party coadyuvante application because they are irrelevant

to the proceeding and because they are foreign documents that were

not properly authenticated [...].”27°
The Appeal Court nonetheless allowed the Appeal,?”! so L. V. International was re-inserted

into the proceedings.

(iii) The Decision?”
In the first 13 pages of its judgment, the Appeal Court sets out an accurate summary of the
contentions of the respective parties, including (i) the Appellants’ reliance on the Foley
Letter and the defendants’ challenge to its admissibility; and (ii) the defendants’ contention

that Article 217 of the Judicial Code, not Article 1644 of the Civil Code, governed liability.

The Appeal Court then emphasises the need for a plaintiff to establish damage in order to
make good a claim under Article 1644 of the Civil Code, citing jurisprudence in support

of this seminal requirement. It draws the following conclusion:273

“The Appellant’s disagreement inevitably leads us to exhaustively
examine the body of evidence that is the basis of the claim, in
accordance, of course, with the requirements to establish non-
contractual liability.

In that sense one must seek to DETERMINE THE DAMAGES. As
a first precondition of civil liability, we must examine the body of
evidence in the file, and the Plaintiff’s legal standing to claim the
aforementioned damages.”

There follows a passage in which the Appeal Court reverses the decision of the First

Instance Court by holding that TGFL has legal standing to be party to the claim.

The Appeal Court then refers to the defendants’ contention that recklessness or bad faith

was the touchstone of liability, and concludes:274

“Consequently, one needs to verify whether the Respondents acted
recklessly and [in] bad faith when they opposed the trademark
registration requested by the Plaintiffs.”

The Appeal Court then recites that, from an examination of the record, the plaintiffs have
failed to prove that the defendants were guilty of recklessness, wilful misconduct or gross
negligence in opposing the plaintiffs’ registration of the RIVERSTONE mark. It

comments:275

“Thus, it has been understood that ‘to become a source of liability,
recklessness — represented by an abuse of the litigation right —
should be characterized by excessive conduct, where recklessness
goes beyond a mere exercise of procedural rights authorized by the
law in defense of an interest.’ In other words, one infers that
recklessness that gives rise to compensation, as stated in Article 217
of the Judicial Code, is comparable to ‘gross negligence or willful
conduct’ [...].

[.]

Thus, if the aforementioned recklessness or willful conduct by the
Respondents has not been proven, we can hardly examine whether
the alleged damages — allegedly caused by a conduct consisting in
exercising a right — have been proven, let alone determine their
quantum.”

The Appeal Court accordingly confirmed the substantive decision of the First Instance

Court.

c. The Cassation Proceedings

290. Cassation is a procedure for reviewing and vacating second-instance decisions. If the
Supreme Court vacates a decision on substantive grounds, it proceeds to decide the case

itself.2”° Article 1169 of the Judicial Code provides:

“The Cassation Recourse on the merits takes place with regards to
the resolutions referred to in [A]rticle 1164, when there are grounds
to determine the infringement of substantive rules of law, by any of
the following concepts: direct violation, misapplication or
misinterpretation of the rule of law, error of fact about the existence
of the evidence and the rule of law in terms of the appreciation of
the said evidence.”?77

The error must substantially have affected the result.

(i) The Application

291. On 1 July 2013, Muresaand TGLF applied for Cassation of the Appeal Court’s decision.?”8

The First Cause was stated to be:

“Breach of substantive rules of law, by error of fact as to the
existence of the evidence, which has substantially influenced the
operative provisions of the appealed resolution (Cause contained in
Article 1169 of the Judicial Code).”?”

292. The six reasons advanced in support of this cause,?8° alleged that the Appeal Court
“completely ignored,” “ignored by not taking into consideration,’ “did not value, but

rather completely ignored,” “ignored,” “did not take into account” the following:?8!

(i) The Foley Letter.

(ii) The evidence of Ms. Moreira, Muresa’s accountant, that Muresa and TGFL had
ceased to sell RIVERSTONE tires due to the Trademark Opposition Proceeding.

(iii) The record showing that BSJ and BSLS withdrew their appeal in the Trademark
Opposition Proceeding.

(iv) The evidence given to the First Instance Court by Muresa’s witnesses that Muresa
and TGFL could not sell RIVERSTONE tires due to the Trademark Opposition
Proceeding.

(v) The evidence given to the First Instance Court by Muresa’s witnesses that they were
aware of the Foley Letter.

(vi) The evidence of the Muresa accountancy experts that there was a decrease in sales in
the sum of US$ 5,168,270.56 due to the Trademark Opposition Proceeding.

The Second Cause advanced for cassation was violation of rules of law. The particulars

pleaded in support of this cause essentially duplicated those relied upon in support of the

First Cause. It should be noted, however, that the plaintiffs alleged that BSJ and BSLS had

directly violated Article 217 of the Judicial Code and that, as a consequence of this, Article

1644 of the Civil Code was “also directly infringed.”?82

On 16 September 2013, BSJ and BSLS filed an Opposition to the Admission of the
Cassation Appeal.?83 This joined issue with the contention that the Appeal Court had
ignored the various items of evidence, arguing that a mere omission to mention evidence
did not prove that it had been ignored. The pleading went on to submit that none of the
items allegedly ignored could have affected the result of the case, as there was no evidence
as to how Bridgestone was alleged to have caused the losses. As to the Second Cause, the
matters relied upon simply duplicated the First Cause. The pleading observed, without
demur, that Muresa relied on Article 217 of the Judicial Code and Article 1644 of the Civil
Code.

(ii) The Decision on Admissibility

On 4 December 2013, the Civil Division of the Supreme Court, consisting of Judge Oydén
Ortega Duran, Judge Hernan A. de Leon Batista and Judge Harley J. Mitchell, ruled that

the First Cause was admissible but that the Second Cause was not.?*4

(iii) The Pleadings
On 3 January 2014, Muresa and TGFL submitted their written submissions in support of
Cassation to the Supreme Court.285 These repeated allegations that the Appeal Court
ignored relevant evidence, including the Foley Letter. They alleged that the threats issued
by the defendants’ lawyers constituted reckless behaviour that caused the plaintiffs to take
precautionary measures. They furtheralleged that there had been “seizure and challenges”
against the RIVERSTONE brand in the Dominican Republic, China and other countries.

Allegations of recklessness and bad faith were made repeatedly.

BSJ and BSLS replied on 14 January 2014.78° They expressly relied upon the passage in
which the Appeal Court had defined the “recklessness that gives rise to the compensation
referred to in [A]rticle 217.”?87 Three pages of the pleading are then devoted to an attack
on the admissibility of the Foley Letter. The pleading goes on to draw attention to the
conflict between Muresa’s case that it was forced to stop selling the RIVERSTONE brand
with the evidence that showed that they continued to sell RIVERSTONE tires. The
pleading then challenges the relevance of BSJ’s and BSLS’s withdrawal of their appeal in
the Trademark Opposition Proceeding, arguing that this could not possibly constitute
recklessness or bad faith. Finally, the pleading deals with the evidence, asserting that it

establishes neither damage norreckless behaviour on the part of BSJ and BSLS. Thus, that

part of the pleading that addresses liability does so on the premise that the test of liability

is recklessness or bad faith.

d. The Supreme Court Judgment

The Supreme Court delivered its judgment on 28 May 2014.?88 The Reporting Judge was
Judge Oydén Ortega Duran, and he delivered a Majority Judgment on behalf of himself
and Judge Hernan A. de Leon Batista. Judge Harley J. Mitchell D. delivered a Dissenting
Opinion. As the Supreme Court Judgment is central to these proceedings, we annex it to
this Award in its entirety.?8? In order to facilitate the analysis that is to follow we propose

to break down the Majority Judgment into its various elements.

(i) The Majority Judgment
(a) The Ground for Cassation

At the beginning of their opinion, the Majority stated the ground upon which cassation was
sought: “infringement of substantive rules of law due to factual error regarding the

existence of evidence.” 2°° They went on to explain what this ground of cassation involves:

“[...] [W]hen evidence in the proceeding was ignored by the Upper
Court when issuing a decision; and when such evidence would have
had an influence on the dispositive part of the decision.”29!

(b) The Finding that the Ground for Cassation was Made Out

Before setting out their opinion, the Majority had set out the six different respects in which
the plaintiffs asserted that there had been “error regarding the existence of evidence which
substantially influenced the dispositive part of the Decision.” Each one of these expressly
alleged that the Appeal Court had “ignored” evidence. The six items of evidence alleged

to have been ignored are set out at paragraph 292 supra.

9! C.0027/ R-0034, Supreme Court Judgment, p. 7 (as translated in R-0034).

81

301. Ina short paragraph the Majority held that, subject to the question of their impact on the

dispositive decision, these grounds for cassation were made out:?92

“[...] [A] thorough review of the challenged Decision shows that the
evidence referred to in the Six Reasons was ignored. The Upper
Court only pointed out that a review of the body of evidence did not
support the Plaintiffs’ claim. The Upper Court did not conduct a
thorough analysis of the evidence, and did not identify any
evidentiary elements referring to it in a general and global way.

[...] It has been shown that the aforementioned evidence was not
assessed by the Upper Court in the challenged decision. [...].”
302. The Majority then remarked that it remained for the Chamber to determine whether the

evidence in question supported the plaintiffs’ claims.?%

(c) The Legal Test of Liability Applied by the Supreme Court

303. The Majority recited that the plaintiffs claimed that there had been “a violation of the
provisions of Article 1644, Civil Code, in accordance with Article 217, Judicial Code” and
set out the provisions of each.2** The Majority accordingly applied the test of recklessness

and bad faith as being determinative of liability.

(d) The Admission of the Foley Letter and Assessment of the Evidence
Alleged to Have Been Ignored
304. The Majority referred to the fact that a Spanish translation of the Foley Letter had been
introduced into the documentary evidence on two occasions,?°> these being their
incorporation in expert reports. After referring to other evidence in the list of six items
relied upon by the plaintiff as having been ignored by the Appeal Court, the Majority

commented :96

“The Chamber notes that the aforementioned evidence, on whose
grounds the merits are based, was duly and timely submitted to the
Court, and does not appear to have been challenged as to its

authenticity and truthfulness. Thus, such evidence may be assessed
jointly.”

(e) The Majority Findings on Damages

305. Before considering the allegations of negligent and reckless action taken by the
Bridgestone defendants in bad faith, the Majority considered the evidence of damage
allegedly sustained by the plaintiffs. In doing so, they had regard to the evidence that the
plaintiffs had alleged had been ignored by the Appeal Court. They stated:?°7

“This Chamber fully verified the body of evidence, on which the
notion of factual error is based about the existence of the evidence.”

306. The Majority accepted this evidence, the truthfulness of which they had described as
unchallenged, as establishing that the Muresa plaintiffs had sustained the losses that they

alleged:

“Such statements clearly and coincidentally show a sales crisis,
reflected in the Plaintiffs’ earnings which, despite the
implementation of contingency plans, could not prevent the loss of
sales or market position of the RIVERSTONE brand.”

307. There is no indication that the Majority gave any consideration to the other evidence

adduced before the First Instance Court, or even to the judgment of that Court.

(f) The Majority’s Finding on Liability
308. The Majority endorsed the finding of the Appeal Court that a finding of negligence was
necessary if liability was to be established pursuant to Article 1644 of the Civil Code, but
stated that they did not agree that negligence was not established.””? They wenton to make

findings of negligence and bad faith against BSJ and BSLS on the following basis:

(i) The Foley Letter was “obviously intimidating and reckless conduct.”>

(iii)

BSJ and BSLS “went to extremes to oppose the registration of a product brand that
was conveniently commercially competitive. Then, after spending a significant
amount of time in litigation, they withdrew the appeal [that] they had filed against an
adverse Decision.” >!

There was strong evidence that Muresa had a legal right to market their product and
BSJ and BSLS, without strong legal grounds, set out to cause damage to their
commercial rivals, wishing to jeopardize Muresa’s dominant market presence. This
was not behaviour taken in good faith. It was negligent and caused irreversible
damage to the plaintiffs’ business activities.3°

(ii) The Dissent of Judge Harley J. Mitchell, D.

Judge Mitchell recorded that he had submitted remarks to his colleagues which were

partially accepted, butthathe did notagree with their decision. The reasons thathe gave

for his dissent included the following:

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

(v)

Submitting the Foley Letter and filing the Trademark Opposition Petition were not
“reckless” per se.°%4

The Majority Judgment did not verify the Foley Letter’s origin, how it reached the
proceedings, or when it was drafted or sent.*05

The copies of the Foley Letter did not meet the necessary procedural requirements to
be admitted as evidence.3%

The plaintiffs advanced their claim on the basis that owing to the Trademark
Opposition Proceeding they stopped selling RIVERSTONE products, but the
Majority Judgment states that the damages were caused by a decrease in sales." In
fact, RIVERSTONE tires were never withdrawn from the market.3%8

The Majority did not have regard to the plaintiffs’ own evidence, which showed that
lower quality tires were already being marketed by Muresa before the Trademark
Opposition Proceeding. >

recklessness, and application of Article 217 of the Judicial Code.”3"3

The Claim for Denial of Justice under Article 10.5 of the TPA
1. The Parties’ Positions

a. The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants contend that Article 10.5 of the TPA requires Panama to provide to covered
investments (including investments in intellectual property rights) fair and equitable
treatment in accordance with customary international law, and it explicitly requires the
Respondent not to deny justice to investors.*7? The Claimants note that the TPA
“specifically refers to the customary international law standard for denial of justice,” but
remark that the TPA also adds that the obligation is “not to deny justice in criminal, civil,
or administrative adjudicatory proceedings in accordance with the principle of due
process embodied in the principal legal systems of the world.”33 In consequence, the
Claimants argue, Panama’s promise to an American investor is that its system of justice
would not fail to meet the standards of due process well-established in the United States,

one of the principal systems of the world. 324

The Claimants submitted in their Memorial that the Respondent’s duty not to deny justice
also arises from customary international law,*?5 but they have since emphasized that
BSLS’s and BSAM’s claim in this case is “explicitly brought under the fair and equitable

treatment standard at Article 10.5 of the TPA.”>6

According to the Claimants, the Respondent has breached Article 10.5 of the TPA by
issuing the Supreme Court Judgment of 28 May 2014, after a “deeply problematic”
process.*?7 For the Claimants, this judgment can only be described as a “shocking,

arbitrary and profoundly unjust’ ruling that “[n]o honest or competent court could possibly

have given [...].”328 The Claimants argue that the Supreme Court Judgment “is a decision
that no court in Panama, no court in the Latin American Region, in fact, no court in any
country around the world has ever taken, ever;” which “undercuts one of the fundamental
rights of trademarks,” namely, “the right to oppose the registration of potentially

confusingly similar marks.”329

(i) The Standard for Denial of Justice

315. The Claimants contend that, as established by arbitral decisions, a denial of justice may
occur when there is “clear and malicious misapplication of the law;” “lack of due process”
to a point which “offends a sense of judicial propriety; a decision thatis “clearly improper
and discreditable” in light of all the facts; or “when it is clear that the court has [...]
‘administer[ed] justice in a seriously inadequate way.”’3° This said, the Claimants also
submit that there is no definitive test for denial of justice under international law, given the
wide range of possibilities and factual circumstances that could amount to denial of

justice.33!

316. For the Claimants, while the duty not to deny justice is procedural, a breach can also occur
“when the decision is so patently arbitrary, unjust or idiosyncratic that it demonstrates bad
faith.”332, Sometimes, the Claimants argue, “the proof of the failed process is that the
substance of a decision is so egregiously wrong that no honest or competent court could
possibly have given it,’ as is the case here.*33 According to the Claimants, after the
Hearing, it is common ground thatthe applicable standard is that “[i]/the existence of grave

judicial decision-maker was dishonest [...] or he or she was grossly incompetent.”334 The
Claimants thus argue that “the best way for the Tribunal to frame the test for denial of

justice” is “a judgment so egregious that no honest or competent court could have given
it2?335

The Claimants accept that the standard for a finding of denial of justice is high, but they
contend that such high standard is met here because the Supreme Court Judgment was

“manifestly ‘arbitrary, irrational, and unjust. 36

The Claimants submit that it is also common ground between the Parties that a denial of
justice is not merely a mistake by a court, noris a claim for denial of justice merely another

appeal; but they argue that there is no appeal in the present case. 337

The Claimants submit, however, that while their claim does not ask the Tribunal to
adjudicate on issues of Panamanian law, it is necessary for them to highlight the ways in
which the Supreme Court ignored Panamanian law in order to demonstrate “the extent to
which ‘the courts failed to meet international law’s requirements for the conduct of a civil
proceeding. ”*°8 Accordingto the Claimants, the only way to analyse whether the Supreme
Court Judgment was “egregious” is to “consider in detail where the Supreme Court went
wrong, and why their decision grossly misapplied Panamanian law and breached
Panamanian standards of due process,” and it is then for the Tribunal to determine
“whether these serious errors and breaches” amount to a decision that was “egregiously

wrong.”339

Finally, observing that the exhaustion of domestic remedies is a precondition to a denial of

justice claim, unless any remaining remedies provide no “reasonable possibility of effective

redress;”**° the Claimants contend that BSLS and BSJ have met that condition by
exhausting all domestic remedies available to them.*4!_ In response to allegations by the
Respondent, the Claimants further submit that the filing of a complaintagainst the Supreme
Court Justices with the National Assembly was not a remedy to be exhausted prior to
submission of this claim because (i) the National Assembly track record for investigations
of Supreme Court Justices in Panama is very poor; and (ii) even if a complaint had led to
an investigation and finding of misconduct, the remedy would have been removing the

judges from office (not to quash the Supreme Court Judgment).342

(ii) The Respondent’s Denial of Justice

The Claimants submit that in this case the Respondent has breached its obligation not to
deny justice because the Panamanian Supreme Court (i) incurred fundamental breaches of
due process; (ii) produced an arbitrary decision; (iii) produced a grossly incompetent

decision; and (iv) there was corruption in the process. *#3

This said, the Claimants also explain that their “complaint is not that Panamanian law does
notcontain adequate procedures to ensure dueprocess,” butrather, that “Panama's justice
system failed the Claimants because Panama’s own principles and laws were abandoned
by the Supreme Court in this case, and because Panama has failed to end the systemic
corruption within the judiciary that it admits exists and which gave rise to the impugned

judgment.” +

The Claimants have also argued, however, that the Tribunal does not need to make a
positive finding of corruption to conclude that a denial of justice has occurred here.*45
According to the Claimants, the denial of justice claim can be sustained if the Tribunal

finds that “the Supreme Court's decision was so clearly improper and discreditable, and

that its failure to adhere to Panamanian rules of procedure and standards of due process
was so flagrant that it lead to an outcome that was manifestly unjust and shocks a sense of
judicial propriety.”*© In the Claimants’ submission, it is sufficient to find that “no honest

or competent court could possibly have given” the judgment at issue. 347

(a) Due Process

The Claimants allege that due process is a fundamental guarantee enshrined in the Panama
Constitution, *48 and it is also an international standard that the Respondent is bound to
protect.*49 According to the Claimants, the international law standard for due process was

breached in this case for a number of reasons that are summarized below.35°

First, the Claimants submit that the Supreme Court Judgment was based on a provision
different from that relied upon in Muresa’s claim, in violation of Article 991 of the Panama
Judicial Code and the international right to due process.35!_ More particularly, the
Claimants argue, the Supreme Court based its decision on Articles 217 (concerning loss
arising outof procedural actions pursued recklessly and in bad faith) and 780 of the Judicial
Code, while Muresa’s claim was filed only on the basis of Article 1644 of the Civil Code
(the tort provision concerning loss arising out of fault or negligence) and Article 1706.°%2
According to the Claimants, the elements of both of these causes of action are different,
and one cause of actioncannotbe considered as “inherent” in the other, as the Respondent’s

expert has argued.**3

For the Claimants, this “was an egregious breach of Panamanian law that rises to the level

of serious incompetency or bad faith, since Panamanian law requires thata judgment is

based solely on the legal grounds in a complaint.”35+ They further submit that this way of
proceeding by the Supreme Court was “seriously unjust;” it constituted “a grave violation
of the international law right of due process because the decision was based on a legal
point that BSLS and BSJ had no opportunity to address;” 355 and it was a “serious violation

of the right to a fair hearing” under international law.35°

The Claimants admit that in the local litigation BSLS and BSJ asked that Muresa’s claim
be dismissed on the ground that Article 217 of the Judicial Code was the appropriate
provision forthe claim, instead of Article 1644 of the Civil Code. Butthey submit that this
is notrelevanthere because that request did not succeed, Muresa maintained the claim only
on the basis of Article 1644 of the Civil Code, and therefore it was not necessary or
appropriate for BSLS and BSJ to respond to a claim under Article 217 of the Judicial Code
which was never brought.357 Contrary to the Respondent’s contentions, the Claimants deny
that BSLS and BSJ “invoke[d]” Article 217 of the Judicial Code or “request[ed]” that it be
applied to the dispute, and argue that all they did was attempt to strike out the claim by

arguing that it was submitted on the wrong basis. #58

The Claimants emphasize also that the problem here is not only that the Supreme Court
relied on a provision not cited by Muresa, but also that the Supreme Court determined that
BSLS and BSJ had been reckless and acted in bad faith, when neither of those allegations

had been made in Muresa’s complaint.459

All this said, at the Hearing, the Claimants observed that while they still maintained their
Article 217 consistency argument and were not abandoning it, it was not their primary

case. 300

Second, the Claimants argue that the Supreme Court Judgment was based on the letter of
3 November 2004 sent by Foley and Lardner on behalf of BFS Brands, LLC and
Bridgestone/Firestone North American Tire, LLC to L.V. International, Inc (“the Foley
Letter”), in violation of Articles 792, 856, 857, 871, 877 and 878 of the Panama Judicial
Code, the principle of listening to the other side, and the international right to due
process.*6! More particularly, the Claimants complain that the Supreme Court gave
“decisive weigh?” to this letter in finding “negligence” on the part of BSLS and BSJ,
although the letter was not sent by BSLS or BSJ or on their behalf, was not addressed to
Muresa or TGFL, related to separate proceedings in the United States, was not
authenticated, was never presented in original, was not verified by its author, was written
in a foreign language (English) and not accompanied by a Court-ordered translation, and it

was not admitted into evidence.3

According to the Claimants, these are not mere technicalities, but rather, they constitute a
“shocking defect of mandatory due process” because under Panamanian law there is no
judicial discretion with respect to compliance with evidentiary rules.*6? The Claimants
also argue that the Foley Letter was only introduced with Muresa’s quantum expert report
months after the Eleventh Circuit Court had issued its order admitting evidence, as a result
of which BSLS and BSJ did not have an opportunity to deal with it or put it in responsive
evidence. For the Claimants, given the reliance placed by the Supreme Court Judgment on
this document, “this was a very serious breach of international law rights of due
process.”> The Claimants further explain that, while the Foley Letter was appended to
L.V. International coadyuvante petition, “it did not become evidence because of that;’ and

in any event, the coadyuvante petition was long after the evidence-taking stage.>°>

The Claimants have also submitted that the Supreme Court findings about the contents of the Foley Letter were
impossible to understand, “wrong and entirely divorced from what the letter actually said,” making theruling one that
no honest or competent court could have made. Cl. PHB, § 37(f)-(g).

Third, the Claimants contend that the Supreme Court Judgment was based on a document
not relevant to the proceeding (the “Foley Letter”), in violation of Article 783 of the
Panama Judicial Code and the international right to a non-arbitrary process.*® The letter
should not have received any evidentiary weight, the Claimants argue, as it was sent by
and addressed to third parties not involved in the Panama Civil Proceeding, and related to

a proceeding in the United States.*°7

Fourth, the Claimants submit that the Supreme Court Judgment was based on grounds not
raised by Muresa in its complaint and to which BSLS and BSJ could not respond, in
violation of the principle of consistency and the international right to due process.°°° More
particularly, the Claimants complain that the Supreme Court relied on allegations about
proceedings brought in other countries to which BSLS and BSJ had no opportunity to
respond, and found BSLS and BSJ liable simply for having exercised their rights to

trademark protection.3

Relatedly, the Claimants also complain that the Supreme Court Judgment was based on the
factual finding that the Foley Letter constituted intimidating and reckless behaviour by
BSLS and BSJ, an allegation that was not made in Muresa’s claim, and to which BSLS and
BSJ did not have an opportunity to respond.*” This was, the Claimants argue, a violation
of mandatory requirements in Article 991 of the Panama Judicial Code, and a “shocking”

and “grave” violation of their international right to due process.37!

Fifth, according to the Claimants, the Supreme Court did not conduct a reasoned
examination of the evidence because it ignored BSLS’s and BSAM’s evidence and the
Court’s own-expert’s evidence, and it relied on unsupported witness evidence contradicted

by documents, in violation of Article 781 of the Judicial Code and of the international law

“right to a court process free from arbitrariness." For the Claimants, this amounts to

“an absence of due process.”373

Sixth, the Claimants argue that the Supreme Court Judgment provided no basis for its
finding that BSLS’s and BSJ’s actions caused loss to Muresa of US$ 5,431,000 million, in
violation of (i) Articles 990 and 199 of the Judicial Code which require that the reasoning
and legal bases for decisions be “explicit;’ and (ii) also in “grave violation{] of the
international law right to due process” and BSLS’s and BSJ’s right to a fair hearing?
For the Claimants, both the Supreme Court’s findings on causation and on loss are

unexplained, incoherent and impossible to understand.375

Seventh, the Claimants also point out that while the Eight Circuit Court that heard the
Trademark Opposition Proceeding had found that BSLS and BSJ had acted in good faith
— a finding that was not appealed, was final and binding and constituted res judicata —
the Supreme Court Judgment ruled that BSLS and BSJ had not acted in good faith and
were reckless.3”° This said, at the Hearing, the Claimants also stated that res judicata was
nota “first-level argument before this Tribunal;’>” and that the Claimants were not going
to press it, and that it was “no longer pursued” by them.378 Instead, in the end, the
Claimants argument was that it was “/egally incoherent’ for the Supreme Court to have
found liability for procedural recklessness under Article 217 of the Judicial Code, when
the court in the underlying litigation had found the BSJ and BSLS had acted with evident
good faith.>”

(b) Arbitrariness

First, the Claimants contend that the Supreme Court Judgment was arbitrary because it
failed to conduct a reasoned examination of the evidence.3®° In particular, the Claimants
complain that the Supreme Court: (i) ignored documentary evidence showing large
amounts of sales of RIVERSTONE tires in the relevant period;+*! (ii) ignored the expert
reports of the Court-appointed expertand BSLS’s and BSJ’s expert; (iii) only considered
the opinion of Muresa’s expert and its witnesses, which were contradicted by the
documentary evidence, the Court-appointed expert and BSLS’s and BSJ’s expert;3*° and
(iv) failed to conductany examination of the evidence or provide any reasoning for the loss
of over US$ 5 million it awarded,** and made no attempt to apportion the loss suffered by

Muresa and the loss suffered by TGFL.#85

Second, the Claimants allege that a “grave violation of the international law right to a non-
arbitrary process” took place when the Supreme Court found that the Foley Letter was a
threatening and reckless action by BSLS and BSJ against Muresa. For the Claimants, this
is “wholly illogical and impossible to understand,’ as the letter was not sent by BSLS or
BSJ, it was not addressed to Muresa or TGFL and it did not refer to intellectual property

rights in Panama. 386

Third, the Claimants submit that another “grave violation of the international law right to
anon-arbitrary process” occurred when the Supreme Court found that BSLS’s and BSJ’s
Trademark Opposition Proceeding against Muresa was initiated with the intention to harm.
This, the Claimants submit, is “impossible to understand” and “entirely unsupported by

any evidence,” given that BSLS and BSJ were simply invoking the mechanism for

trademark opposition mandated under Panamanian law on “entirely reasonable

grounds,”387

(c) Incompetence

The Claimants also submit that the Panamanian Supreme Court produced an “incompetent
decision.” 388 The Claimants further explain that this ground refers to “judicial bad faith”

as distinguished from “mere error.”389

According to the Claimants, the violations of due process and grounds for arbitrariness
they have raised also serve to support the conclusion that “no judge, attempting to apply
the law in good faith, could have made the findings in the Supreme Court Judgment.”
That said, the Claimants argue, whether the lack of bad faith was the result of corruption,

malice or gross incompetence is not something that the Tribunal needs to decide.39!

The Claimants also submit that the Supreme Court Judgment exhibits “clear ignorance”
by the Court, as “[t]he notion that simply bringing a trademark opposition action is itself
abusive or reckless, just because that brand is already in the market, entirely undermines
the intellectual property rights that BSLS and BSJ have” and is “simply wrong in

Panamanian law.”

(d) Corruption
The Claimants submit that the Supreme Court Judgment is “so egregiously wrong that no
honest or competent court could possibly have given it;” and therefore the Tribunal does
not need to go further to find a denial of justice.3° This said, the Claimants have made

various arguments with regard to corruption in this case.

The Claimants contend that (i) “serious errors in the substance” of a local court judgment
are evidence of “malice;” 3% (ii) there isan “endemic corruption” in the Panamanian justice
system, and there have been numerous allegations of corruption against the Justice that
drafted the Supreme Court Judgmentatissue and other justices;3% and (iii) the Panamanian
Ambassador to the United States in office in March 2015 admitted on behalf of Panama

that the Supreme Court Judgment was the result of corruption. *%°

While accepting that “specific acts of corruption in a case like this would be very hard to
prove;” the Claimants submit that in light of “Panama’s admission of corruption,” the
Tribunal should conclude that “the Supreme Court Judgment is so clearly and manifestly

wrong, that it could only have been procured through corruption.”397

The Claimants further submit that given the obvious difficulty of obtaining direct evidence
of corruption, circumstantial evidence can be enough.398 And even if the circumstantial
evidence is insufficient to positively establish corruption, it should be “taken into account

in considering the factual matrix of an impugned judgment.”

In this case, the Claimants say, the following circumstantial evidence points to corruption:
(i) the admission by the Panama Ambassador to the United States that the Supreme Court
Judgment was procured through corruption; (ii) the Respondent’s delay in searching
documents requested in document production until Justice Ortega (drafter of the Supreme
Court Judgment) had left the Court;4°! (iii) the large quantity of circumstantial evidence on

corruption relating to Justice Ortega and the judiciary in general;*0? and (iv) the fact that it

would be “surprising” that two Supreme Court Judges “could be so incompetent” as to

produce a judgment as bad as the one at issue.4°

349. The Claimants add that to the extent evidence of corruption exists, it is within the
Respondent’s possession, custody or control; and itis telling that the Respondenthas failed
to comply with the Tribunal’s orders to produce non-privileged documents responsive to
the Claimants’ requests on this subject.4* The Claimants argue that “[t]he strong inference
is that there are documents that the Respondent would prefer not to reveal.”*5 More
expressly, the Claimants submit that during the document production phase “the
Respondent refused to actually carry out any searches of any hard copy or electronic
documents, or to ask two out of three of the Justices that issued the Supreme Court
Judgment to conduct any searches” and, in light of that, the Tribunal “should adversely
infer that there were communications betweenone or more of the Justices anda third party,
and that such communications would support a finding of corruption in relation to the

Supreme Court Judgment.”4%

350. Finally, according to the Claimants, the Respondent’s Counter-Memorial and responses on
document production did not even attempt to deny the existence of corruption generally in
the judiciary or specifically in relation to the justices in question, and the Tribunal should

also draw adverse inferences from that silence.4°7

(ec) No Competent or Honest Court Could Have Given the Supreme
Court Judgment

351. Throughout their arguments, the Claimants have also highlighted other alleged defects or

flaws of the Supreme Court Judgment.

that it decided that the First Superior Court had made an “error of fact about the existence

of the evidence” (fourth cassation ground under Article 1169 of the Judicial Code) when it
was apparent that such error was not made because the First Superior Court Judgment had
specifically referred to the evidence at issue, or that evidence had not been submitted or
raised with the First Superior Court. For the Claimants, this is a finding that “no honest or

competent court could have made.”*°8 More particularly, the Claimants argue that:

. There was no basis for the Supreme Court to conclude that the First Superior Court
had totally ignored the Foley Letter, because the First Superior Court repeatedly
mentioned that letter; and therefore, the Supreme Court’s conclusion is “impossible
to understand.”*

. It is “not possible to understand” the Supreme Court’s finding that the First Superior
Court made a mistake or ignored certain certificates by Muresa’s accountants
regarding amounts of sales, because, although the First Superior Court did not
mention those certificates, it did refer to Muresa’s expert reports on quantum which
are expressly based on them.*!0

. It was “absurd” for Muresa to complain that the First Superior Court ignored the BSJ
and BSLS’s withdrawal of the appeal in the Trademark Opposition Proceeding,
because that fact was never raised by Muresa with the First Superior Court.4!!

. It is “not possible to understand” how the Supreme Court could have made the
finding that the First Superior Court ignored or made a mistake about the existence
of witness evidence about the volume of tire sales, because that evidence is expressly
cited in the First Superior Court Judgment.4!?

. It is “not possible to understand’ how the Supreme Court believed that the First
Superior Court ignored a witness statement about alleged threats concerning seizure
and confiscation, when the First Superior Court expressly referred to that.413

. It is not possible to understand how the Supreme Court concluded that the First
Superior Court thought that certain accounting expert evidence did not exist or was
ignored, when the First Superior Court Judgment contains numerous references to
that evidence.*!4

The Claimants distinguish between the fourth and fifth ground for cassation under Article
1169 of the Judicial Code, namely, “error of fact about the existence of the evidence”
(fourth ground) and “error of the rule of law in terms of the appreciation of the said
evidence” (fifth ground).*!5 Relying on Mr. Arjona’s opinion, they submit that “ifa court
makes any mistake about the existence of evidence (whether it be that evidence does not
exist when in fact it does, or vice versa), then that falls within ground four, and ifa court
recognizes that particular evidence exists but makes any mistake of appreciation (ranging
fromapplying no weight to applyingtoo much weight) then that falls within ground five.”*'6
The Claimants observe that the fifth cassation ground was not relied upon in Muresa’s
cassation recourse, and criticize the Supreme Court Judgment for finding that “Muresa’s

argument ofa failure of appreciation of evidence fell within ground four.”*"7

Second, the Claimants submit that the findings of the Supreme Court Judgment on liability

have “no basis,” and that “no competent or honest court could have reached” them.*'8

. The Claimants argue that the first basis for liability was the Supreme Court’s finding
that the Trademark Opposition Proceeding was reckless because (i) Muresa had a
legal right to market the product; (ii) Muresa’s product was a competitor; (iii) BSLS
had intent to cause damage; and (iv) the opposition had no legal basis.*!9 And for the
Claimants, finding (i) “misunderstand{] the purpose of intellectual property,” and
“cannot be understood,” because the opposition to the registration did not affect
Muresa’s ability to continue selling;*2° finding (ii) is “absurd” because the purpose
of the trademark opposition regime is to protect against similar marks for the same
or similar products;4?! finding (iii) is unexplained, and cannot be reconciled with the
finding of good faith in the Trademark Opposition Proceeding;4”? and finding (iv) is
unsupported and based on the fundamental misunderstanding that is wrong to oppose
the registration of a mark for a competing product, and it is “impossible to
understand” in light of other successful oppositions by the Bridgestone Group of
“STONE” suffix trademarks in Panama and the finding of good faith in the

Trademark Opposition Proceeding.*?3 Moreover, the Claimants argue, there is a
“fundamental problem” with the Supreme Court Judgment finding liability under
Article 217 of the Judicial Code, which presupposes underlying litigation in which
the liable party exhibited bad faith, when the court in the underlying litigation had
itself found that the party acted in good faith. 47+

The Claimants submit that the second basis of liability was the Supreme Court’s
finding that the Foley Letter was “obviously intimidating and reckless,” which
appeared to be the primary basis for liability.425 And for the Claimants, this finding
entails a denial of justice because (i) it was “irrational and unreasonable” in light of
the content, the sender and the recipient of the letter; and (ii) it was in violation of
due process to rely on a document not properly admitted into evidence, and to which
BSJ and BSLS did not have an opportunity to respond.*26 The Claimants also fault
the Supreme Court for not explaining how the Panamanian court ‘even had
jurisdiction” or why Panamanian law should apply to the sending of this letter sent
in the United States between U.S. attorneys.*2” This finding, the Claimants say, was
“so fundamentally flawed” that “no competent court could have reached that
outcome.” 8

The Claimants contend that the third basis for liability was the Supreme Court’s
finding that the withdrawal of the appeal in the Trademark Opposition Proceeding
was reckless.429 And for the Claimants, this finding is “incomprehensible,” because
the short deadline to file an appeal makes it inevitable for parties to file precautionary
appeals, and the appeal was withdrawn in a timely manner and Muresa did not even
have to respond to it, nor did it incur in any cost.#8° Moreover, Claimants argue, the
finding constitutes a “serious error” because the withdrawal of the appeal was not
raised in Muresa’s complaint.*3! Lastly, the withdrawal of the appeal does not
constitute evidence that that the Trademark Opposition Proceeding was without
merit. 432

Third, according to the Claimants, with regard to causation the Supreme Court found that

BSJ and BSLS’s legal action had caused damages to Muresa in the form of “/oss of sales

or market position of the RIVERSTONE brand.”*3 The Claimants contend that such

finding was “incoherent and incomprehensible,” and could only be the result of

“incompetence or bad faith.”**4 This is so, the Claimants argue, because:

. The Supreme Court accepted Muresa’s employees and Muresa’s accounting expert’s
assertions that the Trademark Opposition Proceeding had caused RIVERSTONE
sales to “cease,” without providing any explanation for why that was the case; and
failing to recognize that a trademark opposition does not prevent the applicant from
continuing to make sales unless there is an injunction, which BSLS never sought.*35

. The alleged loss for Muresa concerned sales in Central and South America, the
Caribbean and elsewhere, when the opposition action was only in Panama.*3¢

. The Supreme Court ignored contrary documentary evidence, and evidence from
BSLS’s expert and the Court’s own expert.437 There was a “serious procedural
defect,” and a “fundamental breach of due process,” as the Supreme Court made a
conscious decision to ignore evidence contrary to its findings, as shown by the fact
that such evidence was cited by the dissenting judge. 438

. The Supreme Court’s finding (that the sales had decreased) was contrary to the
allegations in Muresa’s own pleadings (that the sales had ceased).439

356. Finally, the Claimants’ submit that the Supreme Court finding on loss, by which BSJ and
BSLS were ordered to pay Muresa and TGFL US$ 5 million has no explanation, either
explicit or implicit, and in any event, the damages analysis must be explicit.440
Accordingly, the Claimants’ argue, the Supreme Court Judgment in this respect is

“impossible to understand.”“!

(iii) | The Supreme Court Judgment’s Serious Errors of Panamanian Law
Constitute Violations of International Law and This Case Is Not an
Appeal
The Claimants submit that, contrary to the Respondent’s contention, the serious errors of
Panamanian law thatled to the Supreme Court Judgmentare violations of international law
standards; but explain that it is necessary for the Tribunal to understand the Panamanian
law standards to determine whether the Supreme Court adhered to them.” The Claimants
go on to argue that “[s]erious errors in the application of Panamanian law and violations
of Panamanian standards of due process may be internationally unlawful if they represent

‘[lJack of due process, a tainted background, or even bad faith.””**

Contrary to the Respondent’s contentions, the Claimants deny that their denial of justice
claim amounts to an appeal of the Supreme Court Judgment.“* They explain that their
submissions about inconsistency of the Supreme Court Judgment with Panamanian law are
intended to demonstrate that the judgment “was arbitrary, unjust, and irrational” and in
breach of the TPA fair and equitable treatment standard.*45 According to the Claimants,
each of the grave breaches of Panamanian due process identified also constitute violations

of international law standards of due process.4*6

While the Claimants do not deny that they have made similar arguments to those made by
BSLS and BSJ in the local courts, they contend that this is unsurprising, and it does not
make the present case an appeal. That is, the Claimants say, “because the question before
the Tribunal is not merely whether the Supreme Court erred, but whether it transgressed

the applicable standards under international law.”*47

Relying on the expert reports of Mr. Arjona and Mr. Molino, the Claimants further argue
that the Respondent’s attempt to portray the Supreme Court Judgment as a correct and

logical application of Panamanian law is “simply not right.”*48

b. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent submits that the claim for denial of justice here boils down to one single
argument: “the Supreme Court Judgment was wrong as a matter of Panamanian law.’9
But that claim fails, Panama argues, because denial of justice entails a high standard
requiring more than misapplication of domestic law.*5° For the Respondent, “the
Claimants have utterly failed to make the requisite showing” fora denial of justice, and

“(alll they are doing is appealing” the Supreme Court’s judgment. 45!

(i) | The Standard for Denial of Justice

The Respondent’s position is that the threshold for a finding of denial of justice under
international law is “extremely high,” and it entails “the failure of the entire domestic legal
system.” 4 Tt requires “the failure of a national legal system to provide due process;” it
necessarily entails a systemic failure;4** and the factual circumstances must be

“egregious.” 454

This said, the Respondent agrees with the Claimants that there is no definitive test for
establishing denial of justice. It argues, however, that there are mandatory elements and
procedural prerequisites, anda variety of definitive tests to prove that no denial of justice

has occurred.

364. Among the tests that confirm that a denial of justice must fail, Panama stresses that (i)
claims consisting of violations of domestic law/amounting to an appeal must fail; (ii) an
international tribunal does not have authority to overturn a local court’s appreciation of the
evidence or the evidentiary rules; and (iii) in evaluating a denial of justice claim an
international tribunal is not permitted to “sit in appeal” of a domestic court’s judgment.456
Therefore, Panama argues, it is not the role of an international tribunal to determine
whether in its view the domestic court misapplied domestic law;*57 nor can the tribunal
correct errors of domestic procedural or substantive law or revisit evidentiary rulings.*8
Relying on Professor Paulsson’s treatise, the Respondent submits that the mere violation
of domestic law may “never” justify an international claim for denial of justice.459 What
is required, the Respondent argues, is a finding of a “violation of international law, such
as ‘a willful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a

sense of judicial propriety.””4

365. The Respondent opposes the contention that serious errors in the substance of a court
judgment may amount to denial of justice; and it submits instead that “the substance ofa
judicial decision may be relevant to the extent that it demonstrates a due process violation

or malice.”*6! The Respondent thus relies on Professor Paulsson’s statement that:

“Denial of justice is always procedural. There may be extreme cases
where the proof of the failed process is that the substance of a
decision is so egregiously wrong that no honest or competent court
could possibly have given it. [...] Extreme cases should [] be dealt
with on the footing that they are so unjustifiable that they could have

been only the product of bias or some other violation of the right of
due process,””46

366. The Respondent submits that the above standard has also been confirmed by case law
stating that the standard for denial of justice is procedural, and that the substance of a
decision is only relevant if demonstrates bad faith, which will “only” be the case if the

domestic judgment is one that “no reasonably competent judge could render.”*

367. With regard to the standard for the various “categories” of argument in which the claim

has been structured in this case, * the Respondent submits as follows:

e — Arbitrariness. The bar forsuccess is high, and in the words of the International Court
of Justice (““ICJ”), it is “not so much something opposed to a rule of law, as
something opposed to the rule of law.” It is not satisfied by a judgment which is
merely incorrect as a matter of law, or a decision on which reasonable people may
differ. Itmustbe shown that “no reasonable decision-maker could havereached that
decision.”*°° Because the standard is procedural and not substantive, when
evaluating a claim of arbitrariness, the tribunal should not and need not consider the
merits of the decision.*°7

e Due Process. Itrequires evidence of “fundamental” breaches of due process, that is,
“serious” breaches.4°8 For example, “lack of access to any court, absence of an
impartial decision maker; absence of any opportunity to be heard; and absence ofa
reasoned decision (i.e., no reasons given).”4°

. Corruption. It entails an extremely high standard of proof, and the claiming party
bears the burden of presenting “clear and convincing” evidence.*”

(ii) The Denial of Justice Claim Fails

Panama asks the Tribunal to reject the denial of justice claim in this case.47! The
Respondent submits that “Cl/aimants’ merits theory is meritless” because “[BSAM] lacks
standing to assert a denial of justice claim, and the claim by [BSLS] fails for legal and

factual reasons.”’*7?

The Respondent’s allegations concerning BSAM’s lack of standing are addressed supra at
Section V.A.1.a. But the Respondent adds that, even if BSAM had standing (which is
denied), its claim would still fail as it would be identical to BSLS’s baseless denial of

justice claim.473

As an initial matter, Panama submits that this claim is based almost entirely on alleged
errors in the application of Panamanian law, and that all four categories of the Claimants’
denial of justice argument are no more than appeals of an unfavourable decision on the
basis of Panamanian law.** The Respondent adds that that there is no question that the
Claimants’ arguments here are nothing but an appeal, as demonstrated by the fact that their
theories consist of positions taken from BSJ and BSLS’s pleadings in the Civil Proceeding,

or of assertions that any contrary position is “impossible to understand.”475

Responding to the allegations as made in the Memorial, Panama argued that: (i) all of the
purported “due process” arguments are about the misapplication of Panamanian law,
alleged violations of the Panamanian Judicial Code and do not apply international
standards of due process; (ii) the alleged “arbitrariness” arguments are based on the
application of Article 781 of the Judicial Code, rather than the international law standard

for arbitrariness; and (iii) the arguments regarding “incompetence” of the Supreme Court

are duplicative.47 It follows, Panama says, that these three categories are nothing but

“impermissible appeals of the Supreme Court Judgment.”477

372. In the Rejoinder, Panama argues that while the complaints about the Supreme Court
Judgment have shifted over time, the Claimants appear to have settled on five: (i) lack of
reasoned examination of evidence and reliance on unsupported witness evidence
contradicted by documents; (ii) finding on the basis ofa provision of law not contained in
the claim; (iii) reliance on evidence not properly admitted (i.e. the Foley Letter); (iv)
finding on the basis of grounds not raised by Muresa’s complaint; and (v) a damages
determination not based on any evidence or assessment.*7® And for Panama, although the
Claimants have labelled the first complaint as one of arbitrariness and the others as due
process violations, the labels do not change the fact that all but point (ii) were made in the
Civil Proceeding, and point (ii) is exactly the opposite to what was argued there.479

According to the Respondent, these arguments fail for these “threshold reasons” alone.48°

373. At the Hearing, Panama argued that, while the Claimants’ case had again shifted over the

course of the Hearing, **! their theories still failed.

e First, the Respondent submitted that the Claimants’ theory that a denial of justice
occurred because no other court in history had ever held that “an existing trademark
owner should be penalized for merely filing an opposition application” failed,

476 Resp. C-Mem., 454.

477 Resp.C-Mem.,4]54. The Respondent’s Rejoinder suggests that the Claimants’ Reply appears to have abandoned
one of the categories (“incompetence”), but submits that, in any event, those arguments were duplicative of the other
categories. Resp. Rej.,n. 522.

48 Resp. Rej.,4 160 (referring to Cl. Reply, | 39).

arguments that it says were improperly unveiled during the Hearing (and are time-barred pursuant to Article 10.18.1
of the TPA). Thus, the Respondent submits that while the Claimants appeared to contend at the Hearing that the
Supreme Court should not have applied Panamanian law, during the Civil Proceeding BSJ and BSLS argued
otherwise. Similarly, while at the Hearing the Claimants suggested that the court had misinterpreted the ground for
cassation for “error of fact as to the existence of evidence,” according to Panama, during the Civil Proceeding they
accepted in principle that ignoring evidence amounts to such an error, which is also an interpretation accepted in
Panamanian law. Resp. PHB, §f 8-9 (table, 4" argument).

because that is not what the Supreme Court Judgment held; and even if it was
unprecedent, that alone cannot amount to denial of justice.*8?

Second, the Respondent opposed the Claimants’ allegation that a denial of justice
occurred here because either the Supreme Court judges were incompetent or
dishonest; arguing that there was no evidence to support such serious and pejorative
accusation. 48>

Third, Panama argued that Claimants’ third theory that a denial of justice occurred
because BSLS did not have an opportunity to respond to the Foley Letter, was a
“false” assertion. 48+

Fourth, the Respondent argued that the Claimants’ fourth theory that the Supreme
Court Judgment was “impossible to understand’ fails because all the arguments on
which it is based were made in the context of the Civil Proceeding, and the theory
just amounts to an appeal.485 Panama submits that the Supreme Court Judgment is
indeed possible to understand.48°

This said, the Respondent has addressed more particularly the various complaints against

the Supreme Court Judgment, as summarized below.

(a) Due Process

The Respondent submits that all of the strands of the due process argument lack merit.487

First, with regard to the application of Article 217 of the Judicial Code, the Respondent
submits that, the reality is that BSLS had “every opportunity” to address the issue.488
Panama argues that BSLS and BSJ were the first to raise Article 217, arguing before the
First Instance Court that it should apply; repeated this argument throughout the Civil
Proceeding; and defended the decision of the appellate court that had applied Article

217.489 The Respondent adds that BSLS and BSJ presented merits defences on this topic

and had an opportunity to confront the plaintiffs’ evidence.4%
377. Second, with regard to the admission of the Foley Letter, the Respondent contends that:

. The criticism of the Supreme Court is misdirected, as it was the First Instance Court
which admitted the Foley Letter into the record, a decision never challengedby BSLS
and BSJ.49!

. The Foley Letter was properly admitted into evidence under Panamanian law; and
while the Claimants complain arguing that the letter was produced only with
Muresa’s expertreport, in factit was admitted as evidence by the First Instance Court
on two other occasions (with L.V. International’s Coadyuvante Petition and with the
court-appointed expert’s report), in respect of which the Claimants have notadvanced
an argument of impropriety. 492

. The Respondent further observes that the First Instance Court did not rule on the
objections to the admission of the Foley Letter as an attachment to Muresa’s expert
report, and therefore, the evidence is considered admitted by operation of law.43

. BSLS had multiple opportunities to address the admission and significance of the
Foley Letter, including before the First Instance Court; and in fact, BSLS and BSJ
made arguments on those subjects on several occasions, although neither the First
Instance Court, northe Appellate Court or the Supreme Courtupheld their arguments
about admission of the Foley Letter.4°4

378. Panama further submits that (i) the authenticity of the Foley Letter has never been
questioned;495 (ii) because the letter refers to trademarks around the world, other
Bridgestone entities must have been involved (because BFS did not have rights to
FIRESTONE and BRIDGESTONE everywhere in the world); (iii) it is not sufficient to

state that the letter only involved BFS Brands and L.V. International, because, the letter

itself refers to Bridgestone/Firestone which is a trade name that many of the Bridgestone
companies were using;*” and (iv) the purpose of the letter was to intimidate, as the text of

the letter demonstrates.4°*

Panama adds thatthe Claimants’ argumentat the Hearing questioning the Supreme Court’s
application of Panamanian law and arguing that the court should have conducted a conflict
of law analysis in connection with the Foley Letter, was a brand-new argument, as in the
Civil Proceeding BSJ and BSLS’s position was that the court should apply Article 217 of
the Judicial Code.4?

Third, as to the complaint that the Supreme Court decided that BSLS and BSJ were reckless
and intimidating in filing opposition actions against RIVERSTONE in other countries
although Muresa’s complaint had only referred to the Panama Trademark Opposition

Proceeding, the Respondent argues that:

. The Supreme Court Judgment did not violate the principle of consistency in Article
991 of the Judicial Code, because that Article provides that the judgments must “be
in accordance with the petitions made in the claim, or subsequently alleged in cases
specifically foreseen [...] if so required by Law; and one such case is a coadyuvante
petition. Under Article 603 of the Judicial Code, a court is required to review,

International had raised the opposition actions worldwide, and the Foley Letter.5°°

. BSLS had a number of opportunities to be heard on the issue of the Bridgestone
Group’s conduct outside of Panama during the Civil Proceeding. 5°!

Fourth, Panama also opposes the allegation that the Supreme Court did not support its

ruling on damages on evidence or assessment. It contends that the Supreme Court based

its conclusion that RIVERSTONE sales had decreased during the relevant period on expert

opinions (Muresa’s expert report and the court-appointed expert’s findings), and on the

consistent testimony of seven witnesses.°°2 According to Panama, by the time the case
reached the Supreme Courtthere “was substantial evidence in the record that could support
aconclusion that [...] Muresa and [TGFL] had suffered a sizable amount of damages.”>
Further, Panama explains that the damages award was capped at US$5,000,000.00 because
under Article 991 of the Judicial Code, a defendant cannot be ordered to pay more than it
was requested in the complaint.°™ Finally, Panama suggests that the length and detail of
the Supreme Court is not unusual, given the amount of decisions rendered by the court
every year, which are not treated as precedents (as they are in a common law

jurisdiction). 5°5

In conclusion, Panama argues that a chronological review of the facts of this case confirms

that BSJ and BSLS were afforded due process throughout the Civil Proceeding. 5°

(b) Arbitrariness

Panama contends that the only argument on arbitrariness is that “[t]he Supreme Court did
notconduct a reasoned examination of the evidence [...] and relied on unsupported witness
evidence that was contradicted by documentary evidence.”**’ And, according to Panama,
that argument fails for the following reasons: first, it is within the discretion and mandate
ofa domestic court to weigh the evidence to reach a decision in favour of one party; second,
an international tribunal does not have competence to retrace the evidence; and third, the
Supreme Court did conduct a reasoned examination of the evidence.*°8 Panama submits
that the Supreme Court relied on the evidence that it considered dispositive, namely, the
Foley Letter, BSLS’s withdrawal of its appeal of the ruling of the circuit court in the

Panama Trademark Opposition Proceeding, the consistent testimony of seven witnesses on

(c) Corruption
384. The Respondent argues that the Claimants’ accusation of corruption fails for various

reasons articulated both in the Counter-Memorial and in the Rejoinder.5!°

385. First, according to the Respondent the Claimants have not satisfied the high standard of
proof for corruption in international arbitration, which requires that the party alleging
corruption provides “clear and convincing evidence.”>''! Moreover, the Respondent
argues, the Claimants must substantiate any corruption claim with evidence that
demonstrates that there was corruption in the specific case giving rise to the denial of

justice allegation.5!2

386. However, Respondent argues, the Claimants have acknowledged that they do not have any
evidence of corruption in the context of the Civil Proceedings.*!3 Panama submits that the
Claimants’ only “evidence” is comprised of allegations in the witness statements of a
Bridgestone employee (Mr. Akey, Vice-President of BSAM) and a hired-consultant (Mr.
Lightfoot, a consultant hired by the Claimants’ counsel), regarding statements at a meeting
with the Panamanian Ambassador on 13 March 2015, which are inconsistent with what the

Request for Arbitration initially alleged, and which are “flatly denied” by the Panamanian

Ambassador who has submitted a witness statement in this proceeding too.5'4 The
Respondent observes that the Claimants have not presented any contemporaneous records
of the alleged statement by the Ambassador;>!5 and the Ambassador’s recollection is
consistent with an “ayuda memoria” prepared immediately after the meeting by the

Embassy’s commercial attaché.5!6

The Respondent observes that while the Claimants have relied on arbitral decisions which
state that a tribunal may consider “circumstantial evidence,” neither of those awards have
absolved the party alleging corruption from the burden of providing evidence
(circumstantial or otherwise) “in the case or situation at hand.”*'7 Panama goes on to
submit that the purported circumstantial “evidence” of corruption relied upon by the
Claimants (i.e., (i) general NGO reports giving Panama a low score on “perceived” levels
of corruption; and (ii) complaints filed against Supreme Court Justices in cases other than
the Civil Proceeding) does not meet the standard.5!8§ The Respondent observes that the
NGO reports are based on perceived levels of corruption, and Panama scores similarly to
every other State in Central and South America;5!? and the complaints against Supreme
Court justices concern cases “unrelated” to the Civil Proceeding at issue, with no nexus to
this specific case, and therefore they cannot provide evidence that the Supreme Court

Judgment was procured through corruption and should be disregarded .52°

Finally on this point, the Respondent submits that there is no basis in this case to shift the
burden of proof to Panama to establish that the Supreme Court Judgment was not the

product of corruption, as the Claimants are attempting to do by asking the Tribunal to draw

adverse inferences.*2! In any event, Panama “emphatically denies that the Supreme Court

Judgment was procured through corruption.”>22

Second, relatedly, according to Panama, the claim for corruption is not supported by any
specific factual allegations, let alone evidence.5*3 The Claimants have not identified any
factual allegation about what the alleged corruption supposedly entailed.524 According to
the Respondent, the Claimants are asking the Tribunal to either make a general finding of
corruption without finding any specific facts, orto fashiona factual narrative of corruption,

neither of which is a viable option.525

In this sense, Panama cautions that under Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention the
Tribunal is required to render an award that “states the reasons upon which it is based,”
which requires making findings of fact, law and stating the Tribunal’s conclusions.
Inventing a narrative of corruption when the Claimants have presented none, the

Respondent argues, would amount to an annullable error.526

Third, Panama submits that the claim for corruption is duplicative, and it fails for the same
reason as the other alleged categories of denial of justice, given that the Claimants are
asking the Tribunal to “infer” corruption in the Supreme Court Judgment because the
Judgment was “so clearly and manifestly wrong” (i.e. for the same arguments about
arbitrariness and incompetence).52”7_ The Respondent submits that (i) it is “wholly
inappropriate for a tribunal to infer the existence of corruption in the absence of ‘clear

and convincing evidence,” (ii) the alleged violations of Panamanian law do not constitute
valid international claims, and (iii) in any event, the alleged errors would never justify a

finding of corruption.*28

Fourth, in the Respondent’s submission, the alleged statement by the Ambassador does not
bind the State, because: (i) the context of the meeting (informal and private) dilutes the
potential effect of the alleged statement; (ii) the Ambassador has testified that at the time
of the meeting he did not know the specific parties to the litigation or the names of the
Supreme Court Judges, and therefore he was unable to admit that they were corrupt in this
case; and (iii) in case of doubt about the effect of declarations by a State official under

international law, the Tribunal must interpret them restrictively.529

Fifth, the Claimants first purported to complain of corruption after this arbitration began,
anda lapse of time from the alleged acts of corruption and the first claim of corruption,
raises doubt as to why the allegation was not raised before.530 Indeed, the Respondent
argues, the theory of corruption was not even put forward with the Notice of Arbitration or
the Request for Arbitration, and it first featured in the Memorial.*3! The Respondent goes
on to submit that if the alleged admission of corruption in the March 2015 meeting with
the Ambassador had actually occurred, presumably it would have featured in the pleadings

long before the Memorial.5*?

(d) The Panamanian Checks and Balances System

The Respondentargues that, to the extentthe Claimants’ criticisms to the Panama’s system
for investigating and impeaching Supreme Court justices (the National Assembly
Complaint Mechanism) was intended to constitute a denial of justice claim, that claim

would fail for various reasons, and should be dismissed by the Tribunal.533

First, it is outside the scope of the TPA, which does not authorize the Tribunal to judge
Panama’s system of government in the abstract.534 Panama explains that this follows from

Article 10.1.1 of the TPA, which provides that Chapter 10 applies to “measures” adopted

by a TPA Party “relating to” investors of the other TPA Party and covered investments.
Therefore, absent such a measure there can be no breach and no viable claim.535_ For
Panama, as BSLS did not exercise its right to invoke the mechanism for investigating
Supreme Court justices, it is unable to demonstrate that the mechanism somehow failed it
and, therefore, there are no legal or factual bases for finding that Panama breached an

international obligation. **°

Second, local remedies have not been exhausted in connection with this claim. This is a

requirement for asserting a denial of justice.537

Third, in any event, the allegations based on the National Assembly Complaint Mechanism
are without merit, because (i) they rely on abstract and structural complaints about the
system; and (ii) they are based on misrepresentations of the three complaints chosen by the
Claimants, none of which relates to the Civil Proceeding at issue in this case.538 Panama
submits that the reality of the system is that justices are actually investigated and held
accountable for wrongdoing as shown by two recent examples discussed in the

Rejoinder. 5°?

(iii) The Criticisms of the Supreme Court Judgment Are Based on
Mischaracterizations and Are Unfounded

According to Panama, the complete story of the Civil Proceeding in Panama is not one that
proves a denial of justice, but rather one ofa routine domestic litigation, which shows that
(i) BSLS and BSJ had ample opportunity to present their arguments; (ii) in its context, the
outcome was understandable; (iii) the present case is nothing but an unfounded and
improper appeal; and (iv) the underlying events had nothing to do with BSAM.*4° The

Supreme Court Judgment accords with Panamanian law, the record, and common sense;54!

and a review of the documents confirms that the logic of the judgment can be followed.*42
According to Panama, and contrary to the Claimants’ submissions, there is nothing

“shocking” about the Supreme Court Judgment.5#3

Among others, the Respondent denies the Claimants’ repeated contention that the Supreme
Court found that it was reckless to oppose a trademark if the applicant was already
marketing the product. Panama submits that the Supreme Court explicitly limited the scope
of its ruling to the facts at hand by saying: “It is not this Chamber'’s intention to say that
initiating a legal action to claim a right may be interpreted as a synonym for the damages

that may be caused to a plaintiff.” >4+

The Respondent further takes issue with the allegation in the Memorial that the Supreme
Court Judgment misapplied various provisions of Panamanian law. Panama’s primary
view is thatthe Tribunal does notneed to consider those issues because even if the Supreme
Court had misapplied certain aspects of Panamanian law (which it did not), that would not
amount to a denial of justice.545 That is because “a denial of justice requires a violation of

international Jaw.” *4¢

That said, Panama finds it important to “set the record straight?’ on the subject of its law
and the application of itby the Supreme Court. 54” Itsubmits that the Claimants “fantastical
picture” of alleged flaws and due process violations in the Supreme Court Judgment does
not reflect the reality of the proceeding or the Judgment.*48 The Respondent argues that a
“complete and accurate description of the local proceedings demonstrates that the
Supreme Court did not misapply Panamanian law” which in any event is “an issue which

is notrelevantto the claim under Article 10.5.”54° Panama submits that the following chart

2. The U.S. Submission

The United States observe that Article 10.5.1 of the TPA includes the obligation to provide
FET, which is an obligation circumscribed by the customary international law minimum
standard of treatment,*>! as shown by Article 10.5.2 of the TPA and Annex 10-A of the
TPA.552 Put another way, “the fair and equitable treatment obligation in the TPA is the
customary international law obligation.”>>3 And given that under Article 10.5.2(a) of the
TPA the obligation not to deny justice is included “as part of the concept of fair and
equitable treatment,” itis also acustomary international law obligation.**4 In other words,

Article 10.5.2(a) of the TPA “includes the ‘y international law obligation not to

 

deny justice in criminal, civil or administrative adjudicatory proceedings.

It follows, the United States argue, that in order to establish a breach of Article 10.5.1. for
denial of justice “a claimant must establish that the treatment accorded to its covered

investment rose to the level of a denial of justice under customary international law.”>>°

Answering the question of how a covered investment is accorded treatment in an
adjudicatory proceeding for the purpose of a denial of justice claim, the United States
submit that, fora claim under Article 10.16.1(a) of the TPA, “a Claimant, investor, [...]
must establish that the Claimant was, or sought to be but was prohibited from becoming,
a party to an adjudicatory proceeding in order for that treatment to result in a denial of

justice by virtue of that proceeding.” >"
As to the standard for denial of justice, the United States submit that:

“Denial of justice in its historical and ‘customary sense’ denotes
‘misconduct or inaction of the judicial branch of the government’
and involves ‘some violation of rights in the administration of
justice, or a wrong perpetrated by the abuse of judicial process.’ A

denial of justice may occur in instances such as when the final act
of a State’s judiciary constitutes a ‘notoriously unjust’ or
‘egregious’ administration of justice ‘which offends a sense of
judicial propriety.’ More specifically, a denial of justice exists
where there is, for example, an ‘obstruction of access to courts,’
‘failure to provide those guarantees which are generally considered
indispensable to the proper administration of justice, or a manifestly
unjust judgment.’ A manifestly unjust judgment is one that amounts
to a travesty of justice or is grotesquely unjust. [...] [T]o be
manifestly unjust a court decision must amount ‘to an outrage, to
bad faith, to willful neglect of duty, or to an insufficiency of
governmental action recognizable by every unbiased man[.]’
Instances of denial of justice also have included corruption in
judicial proceedings, discrimination or ill-will against aliens, and
executive or legislative interference with the freedomor impartiality
of the judicial process. At the same time, erroneous domestic court
decisions, or misapplications or misinterpretation of domestic law,
do not in themselves constitute a denial of justice under customary
international law.” 558

The United States also add that it is well-established that international tribunals, such as
tribunals under the TPA, “are not empowered to be supranational courts of appeal on a

court’s application of domestic law.” >?

As to burden of proof, the United States explain that pursuant to Article 10.22 of the TPA,
the Tribunal shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with the TPA and applicable
tules of international law. Accordingly, under general principles of international law, a
claimant must prove its claims by “preponderance of the evidence;” but when there are
allegations of corruption, those general principles of international law require that the party

asserting the corruption provide “clear and convincing” evidence.5

3. The Tribunal’s Analysis

a. Introduction

The Claimants’ case that their investments were harmed by a denial of justice focuses
exclusively on the decisions taken by the Majority of the Supreme Court (for the most part
we shall speak simply of “the Court” when referring to this Majority). The gravamen of
the Claimants’ attack is on the result reached by the Court, which they claim was

shockingly perverse.

This attack is allied to, and overlaps with, allegations of breach of due process. As to these
there has been a vigorous dispute, supported by expert evidence on each side, as to whether
the various allegations of breach of due process are well founded. As to this dispute what
matters is not whether the Supreme Court disregarded procedural requirements but
whether, if they did, this supports the Claimants’ case that there was a denial of justice
under international law. Do they support the case that, taken as a whole, the decision

reached by the Court was one that no honest and competent court could have reached?

It is not possible to give a satisfactory answer to the latter question without considering the
merits of the allegations made by the Claimants of procedural deficiencies. This we shall
do, although we emphasize that, consistent with the view of a tribunal’s function taken in

many other cases, we are not purporting to exercise an appellate function.

Some of the attacks made by the Claimants on the Supreme Court Judgment allege both a
failure to comply with proceduralrules anda failure properly to appraise the evidence. The
Foley Letter is a good example of this. The Claimants make a purely procedural attack on
the admission of the Foley Letter as evidence, and combine this with an attack on the
significance attached by the Supreme Court to the Foley Letter. The Tribunal proposes
first to consider attacks that are purely procedural before proceeding to consider the
allegations made by the Claimants in relation to the appraisal of the evidence. We shall

approach these matters in the following order:

Allegations of Breach of Due Process

123

412.

. Application of the wrong ground for cassation.
. Wrongful application of Article 217 of the Judicial Code.
. Wrongful admission of the Foley Letter.

Allegations of Errors in Appraisal of the Evidence: Liability

. Significance attached to the Foley Letter.

. Significance attached to withdrawal of the appeal in the Trademark Opposition
Proceeding.

. Disregard of finding of good faith in the Trademark Opposition Proceeding.
. Finding of recklessness.
. Finding of causation.

Allegations of Errors in Appraisal of the Evidence: Damages

. Disregard of discrepancy between pleading and evidence of loss.

. Disregard of evidence contradicting Muresa’s case on loss.

b. Allegations of Breach of Due Process
(i) Alleged Application of the Wrong Ground for Cassation*°!

Article 1169 of the Judicial Code sets out the grounds upon which cassation can be
obtained. These include “error of fact about the existence of evidence” and error of “the
rule of law in terms of the appreciation of the said evidence.”**2 Muresa applied for
cassation on the former ground.5® In the course of oral submissions on the first day of the
Hearing, Mr. Williams for the Claimants took a novel point.5°* The Supreme Court had
ordered cassation onthe ground of “error of factabout the existence of evidence” in relation
to six categories of evidence. It was, however, quite clear that the Appeal Court was aware

of the existence of that evidence. The submissions that had led to cassation were not that

the Appeal Court had been unaware of the existence of the evidence in question, but rather
that the Appeal Court had ignored this evidence. That fell properly within the ground of
error of law “in the appreciation of evidence,” but no application had been made on that
ground. Cassation had been ordered on a ground that had not been made out. This
submission was in due course supported by Mr. Arjona, the Claimants’ expert on

Panamanian law.**

Mr. Lee, Panama’s expert on Panamanian law, did not agree. Giving evidence in chief, he
stated that the jurisprudence of the Civil Chamber establishes that there is “an error of fact
about the existence of evidence” when the Appeal Court ignores or takes no account of

evidence, not when it is unaware that the evidence exists.5°

Mr. Lee was cross-examined strenuously and at length about this evidence,°°” but stuck to
his guns. Asked, however, to refer to a specific decision that supported his evidence he
was unable to do so from memory, because unlike in the common law, where cases are

decision and he knew of no lawyer in Panama who has the ability to recall cases by date of

decision. That said, he stated that he could find one if permitted to search his library.56*

By the end of the Hearing no supporting decision had been produced by Mr. Lee. In his
closing submissions, Mr. Williams submitted that, in these circumstances, the Tribunal
should prefer the evidence of Mr. Arjona to that of Mr. Lee on this point, the more so
because this accorded with the natural meaning of Article 1169 of the Judicial Code. The
Supreme Court had allowed the cassation recourse even though it had been brought under

the wrong ground:

“We say that it is clear that no competent and honest court could
have made the findings that the Supreme Court did on the Cassation
Recourse.”

After the Hearing, on 24 September 2019, with the permission of the Tribunal, Panama
submitted the report of a decision and an extract from a textbook that Mr. Lee had
produced. These supported the evidence that he had given. The former, G.A.S., S.A. v.
Cano,5” is an application for cassation. In it the Supreme Court draws a distinction

between the two grounds for cassation:57!

“When a judgment under appeal does not consider a means of

evidence, it is worth noting, an assumption of underlying grounds is

set up other than the grounds invoked, namely, ‘error of fact in the

existence of evidence.’ The fact that certain evidence had no impact

ona decision of a case because it was disregarded by a judge in his

ruling shows error of fact regarding the existence of evidence.

Therefore, to claim an evidentiary defect the concept of ‘error of law

in the assessment of the evidence’ is not suitable, but rather ‘error

of fact in the existence of evidence.””
The textbook on Cassation and Review, states under the heading “Error of Fact Regarding
the Existence of Evidence,” that “[a]n error of fact about the existence of evidence occurs

when evidentiary means or elements are ignored [...].”572

Throughout the Cassation proceedings all concerned, including the dissenting Judge,
proceeded on the basis that “Error of Fact Regarding the Existence of Evidence” was the
appropriate ground of recourse to found an allegation that the Appeal Court had ignored
relevant evidence. The Tribunal is satisfied that this accorded with established practice.
The Claimants’ contention that the Supreme Court applied the wrong ground when

allowing the Cassation Application is without merit.

(ii) Alleged Wrongful Application of Article 217 of the Judicial Code573

The Claimants, relying particularly on the evidence of Mr. Arjona, allege (i) that Muresa’s
claim was founded on an alleged breach by BSJ and BSLS of Article 1644 of the Civil
Code; (ii) that at all stages BSJ and BSLS challenged Muresa’s claim on the ground that it
had been brought under Article 1644 of the Civil Code when it should have been brought
under Article 217 of the Judicial Code; and (iii) that the Supreme Court wrongly found in
favour of Muresa on the basis of breach by BSJ and BSLS of Article 217, notwithstanding

that this was not the claim that Muresa had advanced.*”4

Panama, relying particularly on the evidence of Mr. Lee, responds by alleging (i) that in
the Civil Proceedings the Claimants had invited the several courts to apply Article 217 of
the Judicial Code; (ii) that the Appeal Court had accepted that invitation and dismissed
Muresa’s appeal on the ground that breach of Article 217 was not made out; (iii) that the
Claimants had supported the decision of the Appeal Court; and (iv) that the Supreme Court
had correctly applied Article 217 of the Judicial Code in conjunction with Article 1644 of
the Civil Code.575

In order to resolve this conflict, it is necessary to make a short resume of the relevant parts

of the proceedings that we have set out above.

BSJ’s and BSLS’s Petition for Nullification>”6 alleged that Article 1644 of the Civil Code
did not bear on the facts of the complaint. The law that did bear on them was Article 217
of the Judicial Code. They further alleged that the claim under Article 217 of the Judicial
Code should have been brought in the course of the Trademark Opposition Proceeding *””

When the Court finally dismissed this Petition, it treated the claim as one properly brought

under Article 1644 of the Civil Code and made no mention of Article 217 of the Judicial
Code.

The Concluding Arguments>”8 on behalf of BSJ and BSLS in the First Instance Proceedings
averred that Article 1644 of the Civil Code did not apply to the suit because it was a
“generic norm for compensation of damages and losses in cases of noncontractual civil
liability.’>7? They contended that Article 217 of the Judicial Code applied to the suit.58°
They went on to deal at length with the merits of the claim, treating it as one in which the
good faith of BSJ and BSLS was in issue. They ended by seeking a declaration that the

claim was “unproven, and therefore, denied.” 8!

The First Instance Judgment turned, as we have explained,5*? on Muresa’s failure to prove
that it had suffered the damages claimed. The “Legal Grounds” referred to Article 1644
of the Civil Code. No reference was made to Article 217 of the Judicial Code.

In their Opposition to the Appeal, BSJ and BSLS took the point that Article 217 of the
Judicial Code and not Article 1644 of the Civil Code governed the claim. They then went

on to deal with the merits of the claim, ending with the following submission:

“[...] the simple act of filing a claim does not generate damages in
and of itself, as established by Article 217 of the Judicial Code, and
therefore no unlawful civil act has been committed [...].”583

It is plain from its judgment, and in particular the passage quoted at paragraph 288 supra,
that the Appeal Court accepted BSJ’s and BSLS’s submission that liability was governed
by Article 217 of the Judicial Code.

In its application for Cassation, Muresa for the first time averred that Article 217 of the
Judicial Code was in play.*8+ Their subsequent submissions to the Supreme Court

repeatedly averred “reckless behaviour’ on the part of BSJ and BSLS. 585

BSJ and BSLS for their part, in opposing the application for Cassation5** observed that
Muresa was relying on both Article 217 of the Judicial Code and Article 1644 of the Civil
Code and thatthese had been applied by the Appeal Court when rejecting Muresa’s appeal.
In their subsequent submissions to the Supreme Court,587 BSJ and BSLS set out verbatim
the passage of the Appeal Court’s Judgment in which it had applied Article 217 of the

Judicial Code in dismissing the appeal.

This is the background to the application by the Majority of the Supreme Court of “Article
1644 Civil Code in accordance with Article 217 of the Judicial Code.”5*8 By the time that
the case reached the Supreme Court both parties were ad idem that liability fell to be
determined by the application of Article 217 of the Judicial Code. BSJ’s and BSLS’s
submissions proceeded on this basis. It is not correct to say that they had no opportunity
to address the test of liability under Article 217, for they did so. The Tribunal notes that
the dissenting judge, whose judgment the Claimants have relied upon as a model of that

which the Majority should have produced, applied Article 217 of the Judicial Code.

The Tribunal would add that it sees no conflict between the original claim advanced under
Article 1644 of the Civil Code and a claim under Article 217 of the Judicial Code. BSJ
and BSLS had been right to submit in the First Instance Proceedings that Article 1644 of

the Civil Code was “a generic norm for compensation of damages and losses in cases of
noncontractual civil liability.” 8° Article 1644 of the Civil Code isa broad provision which
imposes liability for causing damage “by action or omission through fault or
negligence.”5% Article 217 of the Judicial Code is a more specific provision. It imposes
liability for causing damage by “reckless or bad faith” conduct of legal proceedings.°%!
There would seem to be no reason why aclaim under Article 1644 of the Civil Code should
not embrace loss or damage through fault consisting of recklessness or bad faith in judicial

proceedings in breach of Article 217 of the Judicial Code.

For all these reasons the Tribunal finds devoid of merit the Claimants’ allegation that the
Supreme Court was wrong to apply Article 217 of the Judicial Code when determining

liability. There was no breach of due process in that respect.

(iii) Alleged Wrongful Admission of the Foley Letter

The focus of attention on the procedural requirements for the admission into evidence of
the Foley Letter has been wholly disproportionate to their significance. The letter is set
out at paragraph 232 supra. It was written by a lawyer acting for two members of the
Bridgestone Group, which had opposed the registration of the RIVERSTONE mark, to

lawyers who had acted for L.V. International in proceedings in the United States.

The Foley Letter formed no part of the case originally advanced by Muresa in support of
its claim. Nor was it introduced into the evidence by Muresa or TGFL. It formed part of
the evidence that L.V. International sought to place before the First Instance Court when it
applied to intervene. It was also annexed both to the Reports of Muresa’s expert witnesses
on damages and to the Report of the Court’s expert.5*2 It had been produced to the expert
witnesses by Muresa personnel as an explanation for the apprehension that they claimed to

have had that RIVERSTONE branded tires would be subject to seizure.

In these circumstances, there was a fundamental disagreement between Mr. Arjona and
Mr. Lee as to whether, under the relevant procedural rules, ithad been open to the Supreme
Court to treat the Foley Letter as evidence. Mr. Arjona’s evidence was that doing so
infringed a number of procedural rules. Mr. Lee expressed the opinion (i) that these rules
simply had no application to evidence that was introduced by experts; and (ii) thatthe Foley
Letter was legitimately introduced into the evidence by L.V. International when that

company joined as Coadyuvante.

The rules that Mr. Arjona alleged were violated were Articles 783, 792, 856, 857 and 871
of the Judicial Code.**? The Tribunal will look briefly at each in turn.
(a) Article 783 of the Judicial Code

This Article provides:5%

“Evidence mustrelate to the subject of the proceedingand those that
do not refer to the facts being discussed are inadmissible, as well as
legally ineffective. [...]”

This is a general principle of evidence that must, we believe, be universal. Whether it is
applicable in the present case is a matter that will become clear when the Tribunal discusses
the significance given to the Foley Letter by the Supreme Court.

“1. Where the party against whom a copy is submitted explicitly or

tacitly acknowledges it to be genuine.”

Mr. Arjona states that these articles were violated because the Foley Letter had not been

(d) Article 871 of the Judicial Code®!

This Article provides that documents of a testimonial character originating from third
parties shall be admitted by the judge only through the formalities established for the
evidence of witnesses. Mr. Arjona states that this article was violated because the Foley
Letter was a private document originating from a third party who never appeared in Court

to ratify its contents. 2

Mr. Lee’s answer to all these points was that the provisions of the Judicial Code relied on
by Mr. Arjona had no application to documents incorporated into the proceedings by expert
witnesses. Article 973 of the Judicial Code made provision for expert witnesses to include
in their reports information received from third parties. The provisions relied upon by
Mr. Arjona applied to evidence tendered by the parties, not evidence included by an expert

in his report:64

“[...] The Letter or Reservation of Rights is not an autonomous
piece of evidence, but an integral part of the corresponding expert
report. The evidence is the expert report, which is a means of
evidence different from documentary evidence. Thus, the exhibits
included by the expert are not considered documentary evidence,
and are not subject to the requirements applicable to documentary
evidence.”605

Mr. Arjona’s answer to this was that if documents introduced by an expert were to be used
as evidence rather than simply as part of his Report, the requirements of the Judicial Code

had to be complied with. Mr Lee’s proposition was “entirely erroneous.”

Mr. Lee had a further point.’ Article 603 of the Judicial Code provided that, when a

Coadyuvante applied to intervene, he had to attach the relevant evidence. L.V.

International had attached the Foley Letter as evidence when applying to intervene. When
the Appeal Court reversed the decision of the First Instance Court and allowed L.V.
International to intervene, the Foley Letter was introduced as part of that company’s

evidence.

L.V. International’s role as Coadyuvante was to assist Muresa and TGFL. It was in a
position to set their claim in the international perspective. The Foley Letter was a relevant
piece of evidence in so doing—as to which see the nextsection of this Award. The unusual
feature is that L.V. International, with its evidence, only joined the proceedings after the
decision of the First Instance Court. It seems to the Tribunal that there is force in the
submission that at this point there was a further introduction of the Foley Letter into the
proceedings. This point appears, however, to have been overlooked in the Supreme Court
where the expert reports were treated as the sole sources from which the Foley Letter

entered the proceedings.

No jurisprudence has been cited to the Tribunal which clearly defines the approach of the
Supreme Court to documentary evidence that has been introduced into proceedings by an
expert witness, nor as to the position in relation to the evidence of a Coadyuvante who has
been refused permission to intervene,and whose appeal against that refusal is only allowed
after the First Instance Court has given judgment. The Tribunal has notbeenable to resolve
the conflict between the evidence of Mr. Arjona and that of Mr. Lee. It has reached the
conclusion, however, that the issue as to the status of the Foley Letter that was so hotly

canvassed in the Civil Proceedings is both artificial and irrelevant.

The Judicial Code has a number of provisions that deal with the authentication of
documents and of the translation of documents that are in a foreign language. These
provisions normally come into play at the Notice of Evidence phase of the proceedings,
where each party adduces the evidence upon which it proposes to rely, and has the
opportunity to challenge the evidence adduced by its opponent. Where no issue arises as
to the authenticity of a document, or the translation of a document, the party adducing it

will not normally be required by the opposing party to go through the processes that the

134

450.

451.

452.

tules would otherwise require in order to authenticate it. This appears to be reflected by

the provisions of Articles 856 and 857 that we have quoted above.

The Foley Letter is a straightforward document. At no stage have BSJ and BSLS
challenged its authenticity, or its translation into Spanish. Because it was not introduced
at the Notice of Evidence phase, when the Tribunal believes that no challenge would have
been made to its authenticity, BSJ and BSLS have been in a position to take the technical
points that they have as to its admissibility. Had there been grounds to challenge its
authenticity or the accuracy of its translation, the Tribunal is confident that a challenge
could and would have been made. Mr. Lee gave evidence to this effect, citing Articles
473 and 793 of the Judicial Code as giving the Judge ample powers to investigate such a

challenge. The Tribunal accepts that evidence.

In their Opposition to the Admission of the Cassation Appeal, BSJ and BSLS made the

following submission:

“[...] The appellant must inform the Court of what the connotations
are that this document has and why, if it had been taken into
consideration, it would have reversed the decision made. It must
additionally be stated that the Court cannot recognize a document
that was not admitted to the process in due form, but beyond the
merely procedural circumstances surrounding this document, the
main point of our disagreement stems from the fact that, even if the
[Appeal Court] had taken this evidence as valid, it would not have
come to different conclusions [...] a document that allegedly
establishes ‘threats and warnings,’ given in another country without
further execution in Panama and which don’t even involve the
parties in this process, cannot be considered as evidence of ‘harmful
conduct.”

In this submission BSJ and BSLS realistically focused not on “merely procedural

circumstances” but on the extent to which the Foley Letter had an impact on the merits. In

454.

455.

their subsequent written submission,°!° however, BSJ and BSLS focused almost

exclusively, and at length, on these procedural circumstances.

The Majority of the Supreme Court dealt with the admissibility of the Foley Letter by
remarking that the evidence relied on by the appellants, which included the Foley Letter,
had been “duly and timely submitted to the Court’ and did not seem to have been
challenged “as to its authenticity and truthfulness.”®'' The dissenting judge dealt first with
the significance of the Foley Letter, concluding that it did not advance Muresa’s claim.®!2
He went on to comment that the copies of the letter did not “meet the necessary

requirements to be considered evidence.”®'3

The Tribunal does not propose to express a definitive view as to whether the Majority of
the Supreme Court was strictly correct to view the introduction of the Foley Letter through
expert reports as having been duly made and timely. It observes that the fact that it was
also introduced by the Coadyuvante appears to have been overlooked by all at this stage.
It believes that the Majority was correct to state that the authenticity of the letter did not
seem to have been challenged. If the Supreme Court was reluctant to shut out on what
were merely procedural grounds, evidence that it considered relevant, this was

understandable.

The Majority of the Supreme Court concluded that the Foley Letter properly formed part
of the evidence in the case. They may well have been correct in so doing, though possibly
for the wrong reason. If this conclusion was erroneous this was not an egregious error of
the kind that could amount to, or contribute to, a denial of justice under the relevant
principles of international law. It lends no support to the Claimants’ case that the decision
of the Majority of the Supreme Court was one that no honest and competent court could

have reached.

ec. Allegations of Errors of Appraisal of the Evidence: Liability
(i) Significance Attached to the Foley Letter
It was and is the Claimants’ case that the Foley Letter had no relevance to the claim brought
by Muresa and TGFL against BSJ and BSLS in Panama. The letter was written in English
in the United States by lawyers acting, not for BSJ or BSLS, but for other companies in the
Bridgestone Group in the context of proceedings between those companies and L.V.

International in the United States.

The Claimants complain that the Supreme Court treated the Foley Letter as if it had been
written on behalf of BSJ and BSLS to Muresa. Questions asked to Mr. Lee when he was
cross-examined by Mr. Williams suggested that the Supreme Court had treated the writing
of the Foley Letter in the United States as a separate cause of action, putting in play
principles of conflict of laws.°!4 Itis necessary at the outset to consider the significance

attached by the Supreme Court to the Foley Letter.

The act on which Muresa and TGFL founded their claims was the commencement of the
Trademark Opposition Proceeding before the Eighth Circuit Court. No independent claim
was made at any stage in relation to the Foley Letter or any other behaviour. By the time
the proceeding reached the Supreme Court it was common ground that the cause of action

arose under Article 217 of the Judicial Code.
This was clearly recognized by the terms of the Supreme Court Judgment:°!5

“The Plaintiff’s claim is aimed at obtaining compensation from the
Respondents for damages caused by a proceeding filed with reckless
intentions [...].”6!®

“[...] Specifically, Plaintiff [Muresa] was subject to a Request to
Oppose the Registration of the RIVERSTONE tire brand. [...]”®!7

“The Appellants point out that violation of the above rules [Article

carried out by the Respondents, in the sense of damages caused to
the Plaintiffs by virtue of an Opposing Proceedings against the
registration of the RIVERSTONE tire brand. [...]”°!8

“[...] The Respondents filed an action lacking in legal grounds

against the current Plaintiffs in the present Ordinary Process by

opposing the registration of the RIVERSTONE tire brand. [...]”!9
460. It is fair to say that the Supreme Court treated the Foley Letter as if it were addressed to
Muresa and TGFL. The relevance that the Foley Letter had in the eyes of the Supreme
Court was the implications that it had in relation to BSJ’s and BSLS’s action in bringing

the Trademark Opposition Proceeding. The applicants’ complaint was that:

“[...] [T]he plaintiffs’ legal representatives stated, in an intimidating
manner, that opposition proceedings were going to be filed in
various countries against the registration of the RIVERSTONE tire
brand. They also added, without any legal basis, at least under
Panamanian law, that the Plaintiffs should abstain from selling the
product. This is obviously intimidating and reckless conduct.”62°

461. This passage raises the following issues:

(i) | Was there justification for treating the Foley Letter as if written to Muresaand TGFL?
(ii) Was there justification in treating the Foley Letter as intimidating?
(a) For Whom was the Foley Letter Intended?

462. The Foley Letter was written in the context of “a world-wide battle between the Luque
Group and the Bridgestone Group.” The second paragraph of the letter could naturally be
read as restricted to the parties to the proceedings that had just taken place in the United
States. The third paragraph of the letter related, however, to the use of the RIVERSTONE
mark throughout the world. L.V. International had been given the role of representing the

products on a world-wide basis. As BSJ and BSLS stated in their opposition petition, the
Bridgestone Companies operated as a single corporate group representing a single group
of economic interests.! The Tribunal considers that the Foley Letter was intended to
come to the attention of all members of the Luque Group of companies. Indeed, a record
of the closing submissions of counsel for BSJ and BSLS explicitly referred to the U.S.
proceedings, and argued that this showed “that the prior-use rights held by plaintiffs are
not unknown to L.V. INTERNATIONAL, INC. and based on what L.V. INTERNATIONAL,
INC. alleged, they should also be known by Defendant MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A. by

virtue of their presumed relationship.”°>*

In short, in the Trademark Opposition Proceeding, BSJ and BSLS themselves submitted
that Muresa should have known of what were alleged to be the former’s “superior rights”

by reason of Muresa’s relationship with L.V. International. 63

For these reasons, the Tribunal considers that the Supreme Court was justified in treating

the Foley Letter as if it had been addressed to Muresa and TGFL.

(b) Did the Supreme Court Attach Too Much Significance to the Foley
Letter?
Evidence was given to the Tribunal by experts in the law and practice of intellectual
property. This evidence extended to letters that are customarily exchanged between
lawyers in circumstances where their clients are, or may be, in dispute as to the registration
or use of rival trademarks. In particular, the experts sought to draw a distinction between
a “Reservation of Rights” letter and a “Cease and Desist” letter. The Claimants’ expert,
Ms. Jacobs-Meadway, described the first as “not an immediate threat but a statement that

any rights that might be asserted on the sender's behalfatsome future time are not waived”

Opposition Proceeding to be persuasive (Tr., Day 5, 1255:21-1258:11 (Mr. Williams)).

in contrast to the latter, which constitutes a threat that may be the basis for legal action.®*+
Ms. Jacobs-Meadway asserted that the Foley Letter was a Reservations of Rightletter. The
Respondent’s expert, Ms. Jacobson, opined that it was a Cease and Desist Letter. She

postulated: 625

“There are both factual and legal elements which mustbe considered
to evaluate whether the Bridgestone Demand Letter [...] was a mere
reservation of rights letter [...] or instead is more properly
characterized as a demand letter [...].”

She then proceeded to embark on that consideration.

This is a good example of a false issue of expert evidence that does nothing to assist the
Tribunal. As Ms. Kepchar for the Claimants remarked at the Hearing, ° it does not matter
what you call the Foley Letter, all that matters is what it actually says and you do not need

trademark experts to understand that.

Looking at the letter itself, it falls into two parts. The first part is consequential upon the
Bridgestone Group’s success in the U.S. Trademark Proceedings. It clearly falls into the
category of a Cease and Desist letter, implicitly threatening action in the event that the
RIVERSTONE brand should be used in the United States. The Tribunal observes that,
whether ornotsucha letter is sent, a party thathas been defeated in registration proceedings
in a particular jurisdiction can reasonably anticipate that any use of that brand in the

jurisdiction in question is likely to provoke further legal proceedings.

The second part of the Foley Letter relates to the use of the RIVERSTONE brand outside
of the United States. It does not merely purport to reserve Bridgestone’s rights in relation
to this territory. It states that Bridgestone is opposed to the use of the RIVERSTONE brand
throughout the world and warns that if L.V. International used that mark it will do so “at

its own peril.” 7 This threat is, however, qualified by the statement that Bridgestone had

not carried out a country-by-country analysis and was not making any specific demand

aimed at the use of the RIVERSTONE mark in any particular foreign country.

The Tribunal refers to its findings at paragraphs 458-459 supra. The Supreme Court did
not find that the act of sending the Foley Letter gave rise, of itself, to any liability. The
relevance of the letter was its bearing on the significance to be attached to the bringing of
the Trademark Opposition Proceeding, which was the act that the Supreme Courtheld gave

rise to liability. There are two aspects of that act to which the Foley Letter has relevance.

The first is the bearing that it has on the attitude of BSJ and BSLS in bringing the
Trademark Opposition Proceeding. Does the Foley Letter lend support to Muresa’s
allegation that bringing the Trademark Opposition Proceeding was reckless? The Tribunal
gives detailed consideration to the issue of recklessness below. We consider that the Foley
Letter is relevant in this respect. The letter implicitly recognizes that the position in a
particular country requires analysis before a specific demand is made not to use the
RIVERSTONE mark. No such analysis was carried out before the Trademark Opposition

Proceeding was brought.

The second aspect on which the Foley Letter is relevant is the bearing that it has on
Muresa’s reaction to the bringing of the Trademark Opposition Proceeding. That reaction
receives further consideration below under the heading of causation. The bringing of the
Trademark Opposition Proceeding was a first step in the implementation by Bridgestone
of the provisional threat made in the Foley Letter. The relevant issues in the Civil
Proceedings in relation to that first step were (i) whether it caused Muresa and TGFL to

cease selling RIVERSTONE tires; and (ii) whether, if it did, that reaction was reasonable.

It does not seem to the Tribunal that the Foley Letter had much impact on either of these
two aspects of Muresa’s case. The Foley Letter was one incident in the world-wide battle
that was taking place between the Bridgestone and the Luque Groups. The Tribunal does
not consider that the letter itself can properly be described as reckless. Nor does the
evidence suggest thatthe letter had causative effect. Had the letter hada significant impact

on Muresa’s reaction to the bringing of the Trademark Opposition Proceeding one would

141

473.

474.

475.

expect some mention to have been made of this when Muresa made its claim, and that

Muresa would have sought to introduce the letter at the Notice of Evidence Phase.

The Majority of the Supreme Court held that the Foley Letter was relevant on the first
aspect referred to above, namely recklessness. They commented that in the letter
Bridgestone’s legal representatives stated in an intimidating manner that opposition
proceedings were going to be filed in various countries against the registration of the
RIVERSTONE brand, and added “without any legal basis, atleast under Panamanian law,
that the Plaintiffs should abstain from selling the product.” They described this as
“obviously intimidating and reckless conduct” which raised doubts about their good faith

when they commenced the Trademark Opposition Proceeding. 9

The Tribunal would not draw the same conclusions in relation to the Foley Letter. The
implication of the letter was that analysis would take place before proceedings were
commenced in individual countries. The gravamen of the case on recklessness was that no
such analysis was carried and that BSJ and BSLS “/ack[ed] [...] legal grounds” for

bringing the Trademark Opposition Proceeding, as the Majority went on to find. °°

Thus, the Tribunal considers that the Supreme Court gave unjustified weight to the Foley
Letter. This is perhaps not surprising having regard not merely to the prominence given to
the letter by Muresa and TGFL but to the lengths to which BSJ and BSLS went in an
attempt to persuade the Court that the letter had been wrongly admitted in evidence. This
was not the type of error that could possibly constitute, of itse/f, any indication of the lack
of competence or bad faith that would have to be established before a denial of justice
under international law could be made out. Nonetheless, it forms part of the overall picture

that the Tribunal will have to consider in due course.

(ii) Did the Supreme Court Err in Attaching Significance to BSJ’s and
BSLS’s Withdrawal of Their Appeal in the Trademark Opposition
Proceeding?
The third matter that, in the application for Cassation, Muresa alleged had been ignored by
the Appeal Court was the withdrawal by BSJ and BSLS of their appeal in the Trademark
Opposition Proceeding. In setting out the factors that led to the conclusion that BSJ and
BSLS had acted recklessly in bringing the Trademark Opposition Proceeding, the Majority
stated: “Then, after spending a significant amount of time in litigation, they withdrew the

appeal they had filed [...].”3!
The dissenting judge observed: °°?

“To qualify the withdrawal of an appeal as reckless is incorrect. It
is not reckless conduct, rather, there is no abuse of litigation. The
Respondents understood that they could not go further in the
proceeding. [...] Punishing a party for a procedural decision[] such
as this, qualifying it as recklessness and abuse of a right, is
inappropriate.”
The Claimants adopted this argument, arguing that it is the very opposite of reckless to

withdraw an appeal at an early stage. °°3

The Majority did not state why BSJ’s and BSLS’s withdrawal of the appeal supported
Muresa’s case that they had been reckless in bringing the Trademark Opposition
Proceeding. The Tribunal considers that the dissenting judge, together with the Claimants,
was wrong to conclude that the Majority had held that the withdrawal of the appeal was
reckless. The significance of the withdrawal of the appeal was that it was a tacit admission
that the Trademark Opposition Proceeding should never have been brought in the first
place. In the view of the Tribunal this was legitimate reasoning, for reasons that will be
explained when the Tribunal comes to deal with recklessness. At this stage, it suffices to

say that there is no merit in this criticism.

(iii) Disregard of the Finding of Good Faith in the Trademark Opposition
Proceeding
In the Trademark Opposition Proceeding, the Eighth Circuit Court released BSJ and BSLS
from liability to pay attorneys’ fees on the ground that they had “acted with evident good
faith [...] without abusing the right to litigate.” 4 This criterion was applied pursuant to
Article 196 of Law 135 of 10 May 1966, which provides:

“In any judgment or court order, the party against whom it is

pronounced shall be ordered to pay the costs, unless, in the opinion

of the judge, it has acted with evident good faith, which the

resolution shall expressly substantiate.””635
In the Civil Proceedings, BSJ and BSLS argued that this finding constituted res judicata
and thus provided a defence to the claim. The First Instance Court rejected that plea on the
ground that the requirements for res judicata under Panamanian law were not satisfied.°°
Before the Supreme Court, BSJ and BSLS accepted this ruling.37 In these proceedings,
however, the Claimants resurrected the argument that a finding of bad faith on their part
should have been precluded under the principle of res judicata. Mr. Lee refuted this
allegation at length in his First Report,“8 and Mr. Arjona responded in his Second
Report,®9 contending, surprisingly, that the requirements for res judicata had no
application where the principle was relied upon in two different types of process.©4° Mr.
Williams sensibly abandoned reliance on res judicata in his closing submissions at the

Hearing. 4!

This lengthy exchange of views between the experts was all the more surprising as BSJ

and BSLS had accepted the decision on res judicata of the First Instance Court in its

submissions to the Supreme Court.®2 The dissenting judge commented that no reason was
given by the Majority “about what to do with a final decision, by the specialized court,

ruling that the party’s conduct was not reckless.”

Mr. Williams correctly observed“ that the decision of the Supreme Court was in stark
conflict with the finding of the Eighth Circuit Court that BSJ and BSLS had acted in good
faith, and one might have expected the Supreme Court to remark upon that fact. But as the
principle of res judicata did not apply, the Tribunal considers that the Supreme Court had
a duty to reach its own judgment on the material before it. No criticism can be made of it
for failing to apply the finding of the Eighth Circuit Court that BSJ and BSLS had acted in
good faith.

(iv) The Finding of Recklessness

At page 14 of the Supreme Court Judgmentthe Majority states in relation to the Trademark
Opposition Proceeding: “The legal action was reckless and intimidating in order to cause
harm.” 45 While the position is not entirely clear, the Tribunal considers that this statement
formed part of the summary of the Appellants’ submissions, as it formed the end of a short
paragraph that began: “The Appellants point out [...].”. The Court’s own appraisal begins

on the following page.

The Court described the Foley Letter as “obviously intimidating and reckless conduct.”

Of the Trademark Opposition Proceedings themselves the Court said that BSJ and BSLS:

“[W]ent to extremes to oppose the registration of a product brand
that was conveniently commercially competitive. Then, after
spending a significant amount of time in litigation, they withdrew
the appeal they had filed against an adverse Decision.”67

145

490.

The Court went on to hold that BSJ and BSLS had filed an action lacking legal grounds
against Muresa with the motive of causing damage to a commercial rival.%48 It stated that
“The Respondents [sic] behavio[u]r cannot be held as good faith behavio[u]r; indeed, it is

negligent behavio[u]r. The Respondents filed an action lacking in legal grounds [...].’®9

The Majority expressed the followingreasons for concluding that BSJ and BSLS had acted
in bad faith by bringing the Trademark Opposition Proceeding: (i) they sent the Foley
Letter; (ii) they filed an action having no legal grounds; (iii) they withdrew their appeal;
(iv) they brought the proceedings against a commercial rival who was carrying on a

substantial business.

The Tribunal has already dealt with the Foley Letter and differs from the Supreme Court’s
view as to its significance.®° Equally, the Tribunal does not consider that the fact that
Muresa was a commercial rival was a reason to criticize the bringing of the Trademark
Opposition Proceeding. By the nature of things this is always likely to be the case where

the registration of a trademark is opposed.

The Tribunal has, however, concluded that the Supreme Court was justified in criticizing
BSJ and BSLS for bringing proceedings without legal grounds, and without having
conducted a Panamanian law analysis of their prospects for success (i.e. of a country-by-
country analysis which the Foley Letter had stated had not been conducted when it stated
its clients’ opposition to the use of the RIVERSTONE trademark anywhere in the world).
Whether that conduct can be called “reckless” depends upon whether it was likely to have
serious consequences—a matter that the Tribunal will address when dealing with causation.

But the bringing of the Trademark Opposition Proceeding was certainly ill-considered.

A powerful indication that the bringing of the Trademark Opposition Proceeding was ill-
considered lies in the fact that, having been unsuccessful at first instance and appealed,

BSJ and BSLS withdrew their appeal.

In civil law countries where legal procedures include appeals as of right, litigants will
normally contemplate the likelihood of an appeal. A party will be unlikely to commence
legal proceedings unless prepared to pursue the claim to an appeal, whether as appellant or
respondent. This is certainly the case in Panama.®5! The Tribunal asked Mr. Lee how often
a claim that failed at first instance would be taken to appeal. His answer was that he had
only experienced a handful of cases that were not taken to appeal. In 99.9 percent of cases
the losing party proceeds with an appeal so that a court with more experienced judges can

consider the case.

In the light of this, the question arises of why BSJ and BSLS took the decision notto pursue
an appeal when their Trademark Opposition Proceeding failed at first instance. In their
Memorial the Claimants stated that they decided to withdraw their appeal because they
understood that they were “very unlikely to succeed.” 52 There would seem to be only two
possibilities. Either BSJ and BSLS commenced the Trademark Opposition Proceeding
when they knew or ought to have known that they were very unlikely to succeed, or facts
emerged in the course of those proceedings, of which BSJ and BSLS could not reasonably

have been aware, that demonstrated that an appeal would be hopeless.

The Tribunal is satisfied that the former of these two possibilities represents the true

position. The judgment of the Eighth Circuit Court included the following passage:

“In practice, the trademarks in conflict already had occasion to
coexist in the market (between [...] May 6 2002 and [...] February
4 2005); in the trademark scenario, heavy investments in money
have been made, by both sides and there is no evidence that their
coexistence has caused error, confusion, mistake, mislead or
deception in the consumer public, or caused damage to
BRIDGESTONE CORPORATION and BRIDGESTONE
LICENSING SERVICE, INC. or dilute the distinctive force of the
trademarks BRIDGESTONE FIRESTONE.” 3

The fact that the rival brands had been co-existing in the market for several years, without

any evidence of confusion was, so it seems to the Tribunal, a fatal impediment to an

496.

application based on the risk of confusion. This conclusion receives support from the
witness statementof Audrey Williams, a Panamanian practitioner in the field of intellectual
property who gave evidence on behalf of BSJ and BSLS. She gave examples of the
evidence that a licensee of a trademark might be in a position to give when assisting the

trademark owner to resist, inter alia, opposition proceedings: 4

“Such evidence may include proof that the confronted marks can
coexist if goods bearing the marks are found in the market (in which
case the action would be dismissed because there would be no
likelihood of confusion or association) [...].”

When BSJ and BSLS commenced the Trademark Opposition Proceeding they knew, or
ought to have known, of the co-existence of the rival brands in the Panama market. Had
they sought advice as to the prospects of success of the proceedings, there is no reason to
believe thatthe advice would have been any different from that subsequently given to them
in respect of the prospects of a successful appeal. The Trademark Opposition Proceeding

would be “very unlikely to succeed.”

To bring the Trademark Opposition Proceeding in these circumstances was ill-considered,
indeed reckless if the potential consequences were significant. It was conduct that gave
effect to a blanket policy of opposing the registration of any trademark bearing the suffix
“STONE,” regardless of the circumstances of the individual case. In their Memorial,®5
the Claimants acknowledged that it was their policy to monitor trademark applications all
over the world and to oppose any applications that had the “STONE” suffix. Mr.
Kingsbury, BSAM’s Chief Counsel, stated that Bridgestone had opposed the registration
of the RIVERSTONE trademark in almost all jurisdictions in which an application for

registration had been brought, in accordance with this policy.°°

6s4 CWS-Williams, 14.
65 Cl. Mem. 18.
656 CWS-Kingsbury Third, 46.

148

497. For these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the Majority of the Supreme Court was
justified in concluding that BSJ and BSLS had brought the Trademark Opposition

Proceeding against Muresa when these were without legal merit.

(v) The Finding of Causation

498. At the heart of the Claimants’ attack on the Supreme Court’s Judgment is the issue of
causation. On what basis did the Supreme Court find that the lawful practice of opposing
the registration of the RIVERSTONE trademark caused Muresa and TGFL to stop, or
reduce, their sales of RIVERSTONE tires? The Claimants contend that the Supreme

Court’s Judgment was simply incomprehensible.

499. The Supreme Court appears to have accepted that evidence of Muresa’s witnesses that had
been ignored by the Appeal Court established that the act of bringing the Trademark
Opposition Proceeding caused Muresa and TGFL to cease selling RIVERSTONE tires.
The Court quoted from evidence that was part of the fourth reason for Cassation set out at
paragraph 292 supra given by Mr. Medina, Muresa’s Sales Manager. The emphasis is that

of the Supreme Court:

“[...] QUESTION 5. [...] [W]hat happened after the company
became aware of the opposition to the registration of the trademark
in Panama. Please explain.

ANSWER: When we found out about the opposition to the
trademark registration, we had to create contingency plans to try to
maintain the same volume of sales; as a result, we had to choose
to enter the market with other brands to meet the needs of our
customers [...| When entering the market with these brands,
unknown at the time, we had to offer them at lower prices, to the
detriment of the company’s profit margin. In addition, there was a
denial by many customers about a product that they did not know;
they cancelled orders for fear of a product of inferior quality.” °7

500. The Court referred to similar witness statements and commented:

“The Court noticed from all witness statements that, coincidentally,
due to the process opposing the registration of the RIVERSTONE
brand, filed against MURESA INTERTRADE, SA, by

57 €.0027/ R-0034, Supreme Court Judgment, p. 10 (as translated in R-0034) (emphasis in original).

BRIDGESTONE LICENSING SERVICES, INC. and
BRIDGESTONE CORPORATION, the Plaintiff suffered recurrent
damages because they found themselves in a situation of having to
improvise with other brands, even lower quality brands, to meet
sales demand in the market.”°8

The Court subsequently summarised the position as follows:

“The Respondents filed an action lacking in legal grounds against

the current Plaintiffs in the present Ordinary Process by opposing

the registration of the RIVERSTONE tire brand. Such action caused

irreversible damages to the key part of the Plaintiffs’ business

activities.”
None of this provides any explanation as to why the bringing of the Trademark Opposition
Proceeding caused Muresa and TGFL to stop, or reduce, the sale of RIVERSTONE tires.
The dissenting judge was alive to this point. His analysis of the evidence was that Muresa
was afraid that Bridgestone would have the RIVERSTONE tires seized and for that reason
unilaterally decided to reduce sales of that brand. He cited a more pertinent passage from

the evidence of Mr. Medina:

“QUESTION 3. What was the cause of the contingency plan?

ANSWER (Witness): Actually, there was a _ fear that
BRIDGESTONE CORPORATION would order a seizure of
RIVERSTONE tires, or prevent the sale of said tires. It was a very
delicate situation, having inventory in the warehouse, goods in
transit, and goods being manufactured with the RIVERSTONE
brand that we may not be able to sell owing to a Decision against

us.700

The Tribunal considers that the dissenting judge’s criticism of this part of the Majority
judgment was well founded. There was no logical reason for Muresa to fear that the
Trademark Opposition Proceeding would be accompanied by seizure of RIVERSTONE
tires. There was discussion between the experts as to whether seizure of RIVERSTONE

tires might be ordered as a “precautionary measure”! pending determination of the

Trademark Opposition Proceeding, but there was no evidence that such a step had ever

been taken in such circumstances.

It is possible that Muresa and TGFL were concerned about the implications of the
Trademark Opposition Proceeding because they feared that they might lose them.% This
possibility gains support from the fact that, for unexplained reasons, L. V. International had,
on 13 August 2004, withdrawn its application to register the RIVERSTONE mark in the
United States, in the face of a Notice of Opposition from members of the Bridgestone
Group. If BSJ and BSLS succeeded in the Trademark Opposition Proceeding in
Panama, they were plainly likely then to take steps to prevent Muresa and TGFL’s
continued use of the RIVERSTONE mark. But if that apprehension was the reason why
Muresa and TGFL reduced production and/or sale of RIVERSTONE tires it was not one

for which they could reasonably hold Bridgestone responsible.

For these reasons, the Tribunal has concluded that the Majority of the Supreme Court was
in error in attributing to BSJ and BSLS responsibility for any decision on the part of Muresa
and TGFL to cease or reduce the sale of RIVERSTONE tires. This error forms part of the
overall picture that the Tribunal considers below in relation to the allegation of denial of

justice.

d. Allegations of Errors in the Appraisal of the Evidence: Damages
(i) Disregard of Discrepancy Between Pleading and Evidence of Loss
The claim initially filed by Muresa and TGFL alleged that “the product of the brand
RIVERSTONE Y DISENO stopped being commercialized (sold) as a consequence of” the
Trademark Opposition Proceeding.“ The evidence that they subsequently adduced in
support of their claim did not supporta case that sales of tires bearing the RIVERSTONE

brand had been wholly suspended. Rather their evidence was that there had been a

significant reduction in sales of RIVERSTONE tires by comparison with the sales that had

been estimated.

BSJ and BSLS took the point in their submissions to the Supreme Court®® that all the
accounting experts agreed that there had been no total cessation of sales of RIVERSTONE

brand tires.

The Majority of the Supreme Court found that there was evidence that there had been a
loss of sales of RIVERSTONE tires to the value of over US$ 5 million. They made no

mention of the alleged discrepancy between a loss of sales and a reduction of sales.

The Tribunal is not persuaded that this pleading point is one of significance. Muresa did
not adduce evidence of a total stoppage of sales of RIVERSTONE tires, but of a partial
stoppage of sales of RIVERSTONE tires which were replaced by sales of inferior tires,
resulting in a loss of over US$ 5 million. Had there been evidence that Bridgestone had
wrongly caused that loss, the Tribunal would not criticize the Supreme Court for
disregarding the fact that the wording of the initial claim had not clearly spelt out Muresa’s

case.

(ii) Disregard of Evidence Contradicting Muresa’s Case on Loss

The expert accountancy evidence that Muresa and TGFL relied uponas the sixth category
of evidence ignored by the Appeal Court was contradicted by other evidence of fact and
expert evidence, including that of the court-appointed expert. This evidence is referred
to in the dissenting judgment of Judge Mitchell.® It is evidence that the First Instance

Court preferred when rejecting Muresa and TGFL’s claim.

511. The Majority makes no reference to this evidence. Indeed, the Majority appears to have
proceeded on the premise that the six categories of evidence that were ignored by the

Appeal Court constituted all the relevant evidence, remarking: 8

“The Chamber notes that the aforementioned evidence, on whose
grounds the merits are based, was duly and timely submitted to the
Court, and does not appear to have been challenged as to its
authenticity and truthfulness. Thus, such evidence may be assessed
jointly.”

512. The Tribunal finds that the Claimants’ criticism of this aspect of the Supreme Court’s
Judgmentis made out. Itwas a serious oversight to proceed on the premise that the relevant
evidence was restricted to that which was the subject of the Cassation recourse and to

proceed on the premise that there was no challenge to this evidence.

513. Mr. Williams? picked out the following question and answer in Professor Paulsson’s

Report:97

“QUESTION 10. Claimants allege that the Supreme Court did
‘notconducta reasoned examination of the evidence when it ignored
the documentary evidence in the case file that showed huge
quantities of sales of RIVERSTONE tires during the relevant
period.’ Please indicate, in your opinion, whether this failure would
reach the level of a denial of justice under Article 10.5 of the TPA.

[...] Any enquiry into such treatment of evidence is fact-specific,
but an international tribunal would have to be convinced that there
is no explanation for the failure to refer to that piece of evidence
except for bias, fraud, dishonesty, lack of impartiality, or gross
incompetence, and not merely bona fide error. If the tribunal does
form this conviction, then the conscious failure to conduct an
examination of the evidence and a decision to ignore critical
documentary evidence could, in principle, form an element of proof
fora denial of justice.”

Mr. Williams submitted that this passage was applicable to the Supreme Court’s failure to
referto the evidence that conflicted with Muresa’s case on loss. Thatitdeliberately ignored

evidence that conflicted with the conclusion that it was determined to reach.

The Tribunal notes that Professor Paulsson said that the conduct described could form “an
element” of proof ofa denial of justice. It is necessary to consider all the relevant facts in

the round. This the Tribunal now turns to do.

e. The Judgment of the Majority of the Supreme Court Viewed in the Round
(i) Introduction

In these proceedings the Supreme Court Judgment, and the context in which it was given,
have been examined by the lawyers on each side and by the Tribunal in minute detail.
Thousands of hours have been devoted to the task. The Supreme Court had neither the
time nor the resources to approach its task in the same depth. Mr. Arjona, who served on
the Supreme Court, was only able to give the Tribunal a rough estimate of the number of
decisions that the Civil Chamber would hand down ina year. This was between 300 and

600.7! The Appeal Court would have hada similar case load.°””

Most appeals would be dealt with on the papers, without an oral hearing, and the Courts
would plainly have assistance in handling the documents involved -— in the Muresa claim
the record exceeds 3000pages. Plainly, a State cannotrely upon lack of resources to justify
a defective justice system, but the Tribunal does not believe that the caseload of the
Supreme Court of Panama is untypical of other civil Supreme Courts. The handling of
appeals in such systems will necessarily be rapid and robust and judgments necessarily

concise.

(ii) The Application for Cassation

It has not been in the interest of either Party to criticize the judgment of the Appeal Court

Mr. Lee suggested that the concision of that judgment exemplified the requiredexplanatory

"Tr, Day 2,390: 16-391:6 (Mr. Arjona).

standard.°73 This was somewhat ironic as the Supreme Court, the adequacy of whose
judgment Mr. Lee was supporting, had itself criticized the judgment of the Appeal Court

on the ground that:

“The Upper Court only pointed out that a review of the body of

evidence did not support the Plaintiff's claim. The Upper Court did

notconducta thorough analysis of the evidence, and did notidentify

any evidentiary elements, referring to it in a general and global

way,”674
The Tribunal understands the Supreme Court’s dissatisfaction with the judgment of the
Appeal Court. Itis hard to believe that it was all written by the same hand: In the first part
there is citation of jurisprudence in support of the importance of establishing damage,
followed by the statement that it is a precondition to examine the evidence in the file to this
end. There follows a bald statement that the necessary recklessness and bad faith are not
established. This is then followed by a statement that it is impossible to examine the
alleged damage. Why cite jurisprudence about the seminal importance of establishing

damage in circumstances where the court does not proceed to do so?

In these circumstances, the Tribunal can understand why all three members of the Supreme
Court were persuaded that lengthy evidence in relation to the damage suffered by Muresa

and TGFL was properly the subject of an application for Cassation.
(iii) +The Overall Picture
The evidence that fell to be considered in the Cassation proceedings accurately painted the

following picture:

(i) The Bridgestone Group and the Luque Group were commercial rivals in the
manufacture and sale of tires on an international scale.

(ii) The Bridgestone Group was pursuing an aggressive campaign of challenging the use
of the RIVERSTONE trademark in various jurisdictions around the world.

(iii) The lawyers acting for the Bridgestone Group in the U.S. proceedings had sent to
L.V. International a letter, the Foley Letter, intended to come to the notice of the

3 RER-Lee Second, § 92.
4 €.0027/ R-0034, Supreme Court Judgment, p. 7 (as translated in R-0034).

155

525.

Luque Group around the world. The letter aimed at discouraging the use of the
RIVERSTONE trademark around the world inasmuch as it included the threat that
such use would be “at [your] own peril.”

(iv) BSJ and BSLS had brought the Trademark Opposition Proceeding in Panama that
had no reasonable prospect of success. They had recognized this by withdrawing
their appeal after losing at first instance.

There was also evidence that was subject to the Cassation claim to the effect that Muresa
and TGFL had cut back on the sale of tires bearing the RIVERSTONE brand to the value
of US$ 5,168,270.56. It was this evidence that was not accepted by the First Instance

Court, which accepted conflicting expert evidence that the loss of sales was not made out.

The Tribunal is not aware that it has ever been contended that Muresa’s claim was
fraudulent and that Muresa and TGFL did not cut back on production and sales of
RIVERSTONE tires in response to the Trademark Opposition Proceeding. Rather, the
points that were taken by BSJ and BSLS in the Civil Proceedings were that the evidence
was that Muresa and TGFL did this of their own volition out of apprehension that
RIVERSTONE tires would be seized, that the bringing of the Trademark Opposition
Proceeding did not justify this reaction, that the original claim that sales stopped was not

made out, and that the extent of any diminution in sales was not proved.

In these circumstances it is not correct to allege, as the Claimants have, that the Supreme

Court held that:

“[S]imply bringing a trademark opposition action, in circumstances
where the trademark applicant was a competitor, was unlawful
because there was a risk [that] the competitor might thereby suffer
loss.”675

The Supreme Court was at pains to state:

“Tt is not this Chamber’s intention to say that initiating a legal action
to claim a right may be interpreted as a synonym for the damages
that may be caused to a plaintiff — thus creating a coercion element

5 See,e.g.,ClMem.,425(p).

156

526.

527.

528.

529.

for anyone who feels entitled to a claim and to use the means

provided by the law to do so.”°6
The Supreme Court’s Judgment was founded on the premise that BSJ and BSLS had
brought the Trademark Opposition Proceeding without legal grounds, with the intention of
damaging a trade rival. This premise was correct in as much as (i) the Trademark
Opposition Proceeding were doomed to failure; and (ii) the purpose of bringing the
Trademark Opposition Proceeding was to preventa trade rival from marketing tires bearing
the RIVERSTONE brand. Where the Supreme Court misread the situation was by
accepting that the act of bringing the Trademark Opposition Proceeding was, of itself,
calculated to cause loss to the Muresa Group, whereas that loss would only follow, quite

lawfully, if the Trademark Opposition Proceeding were successful.

The Supreme Court proceeded on the false premise that there was a causal nexus between
BSJ and BSLS making an unjustified opposition to the registration of the RIVERSTONE
brand, and the Muresa and TGFL’s actions in cutting back on the production and sales of
RIVERSTONE tires when there was no such nexus. In reaching this conclusion the
Supreme Court attached undue weight to the Foley Letter, which reflected the prominence
given to that letter in the pleadings of the parties. The Supreme Court made the further
error of assuming that the evidence in relation to Muresa and TGFL’s losses was

unchallenged.

The onus lies on the Claimants to demonstrate that these were not mere errors or oversights,
buta demonstrationof either incompetence or corruption on the part of the Majority judges.
The onus is a high one. On the facts of this case, the Tribunal is satisfied that it is not

discharged.

So far as causation is concerned, all the Muresa witnesses of fact and, indeed their
accountancy experts, proceeded on the basis that it was axiomatic that Muresa and TGFL
had to take measures to cut back on production and sale of RIVERSTONE tires as a

consequence of BSJ and BSLS bringing the Trademark Opposition Proceeding in the

6 €-0027/ R-0034, Supreme Court Judgment, pp. 16-17 (as translated in R-0034).

534.

context of the Foley Letter. The Supreme Court proceeded on the premise that this was

correct. That was a mistake, but not one that demonstrates incompetence or corruption.

The Supreme Court also accepted that the evidence that was the focus of the Cassation
proceedings was a reliable, indeed unchallenged, basis for assessing loss. It was wrong to

do so, but once again this error cannot found a finding to incompetence or corruption.

It is necessary, however, to say something further about the allegation that the decision of

the Majority was procured by corruption.

f. The Allegation of Corruption

There are two different bases on which the Claimants invite the Tribunal to find that the
judgment of the Majority of the Supreme Court was procured by corruption. The first is
that the breaches of due process and the delivery of an incomprehensible judgment were
so egregious, that they lead inexorably to the conclusion that the Majority who were
responsible for this were either incompetent or bribed. The Claimants argue that while the
Tribunal does nothave to choose between the two, there are a number of peripheral matters

that lend plausibility to the conclusion that the judgment was procured by corruption.

The second basis on which the Tribunal is invited to make a finding of corruption is
altogether different in kind. The Claimants allege that Mr. Gonzalez-Revilla, at a time
when he held the office of Panamanian Ambassador to the United States, made a formal
admission on behalf of Panama that the Majority judgment had been procured by

corruption.
(i) Alleged Indications of Corruption
In the unchallenged Report of Professor Paulsson he says this about corruption:©””
“The Claimants must substantiate any serious charge of corruption

with evidence that demonstrates there was corruption in the specific
case where denial of justice is alleged [...] A mere suspicion of

67 RER-Paulsson, 4/79.

158

535.

536.

537.

538.

corruption is never enough, let alone a mere suspicion of corruption
in the state in general.”
Professor Paulsson cites in supportof this proposition a passage from the award in Vanessa

Ventures: 678

“Allegations of a lack of independence and impartiality are more

difficult to deal with. They often amount to allegations of violations

of professional rules, or even of criminal laws, and it is not to be

expected that evidence will be readily available. Such allegations

would, if proven, constitute very serious violations of the State’s

treaty obligations. But they must be properly proved; and the proof

must, at least ordinarily, relate to the specific cases in which the

impropriety is alleged to have occurred. Inferences ofa serious and

endemic lack of independence and impartiality in the judiciary

drawn from an examination of other cases or from anecdotal or

circumstantial evidence, will not ordinarily suffice to prove an

allegation of impropriety in a particular case.”
The Claimants have put forward a number of matters that they submit support a finding
that the Majority judgment was procured by corruption. They include the perception of
corruption in the judiciary of Panama in Transparency International’s Global Corruption
Monitor, and complaints of corruption madeagainst the reporting judge in the present case,
Justice Oyden Ortega. These complaints have not been upheld, but the Claimants allege
that this is because the only body empowered to investigate Supreme Court Justices is the
National Assembly, and there is a non-aggression pact between that body and the Supreme

Court Judiciary under which one never investigates the other.

The Claimants do not suggest that these matters, if free standing, would suffice to found a
finding of corruption in this case. They are relied upon to explain, on the basis of
corruption, a judgment that the Claimants submit can only be explained as resulting from

corruption or incompetence.

The Tribunal has rejected the Claimants’ case that the Supreme Court Judgment gives rise
to a presumption that the Majority of the Court was incompetent or corrupt. In these

circumstances, the Tribunal does not consider it desirable to ventilate further matters that

Award, 16 January 2013, 4228.

might lend some peripheral support to a finding of corruption but that do not, of themselves,
suffice to found such a finding, the more so as some of these matters involve Restricted

Information.

(ii) The Alleged Admission of the Ambassador

539. Bridgestone representatives arranged a meeting with Mr. Gonzalez-Revilla, the
Panamanian Ambassador to the United States, in order to discuss the implications of the
Supreme Court Judgment. The meeting took place on 13 March 2015. In their Request

for Arbitration, the Claimants described what transpired at this meeting as follows:

“During this meeting, Bridgestone expressed concern over the
Supreme Court decision and inquired as to domestic remedies
available in addition to the two post-judgment appeals it had filed.
Despite comments from the Ambassador indicating that he did not
believe the decision could be changed, he offered to follow up with
Bridgestone to discuss other potential domestic remedies.
Unfortunately no follow up ever took place.”°”?

540. The Bridgestone representatives at this meeting were Mr. Jeffrey Lightfoot, a lawyer who
had arranged the meeting, Mr. Charles Johnson and Mr. Stephen Kho, two partners of Akin
Gump and Mr. Steven Akey, Vice President for Government Affairs of BSAM. The

Ambassador was accompanied by Mr. Heilbron and Ms. Gonzalez.

541. In his witness statement dated 30 April 2018, Mr. Akey described what occurred as

follows:

“[...] I could see that the Ambassador had been well-briefed and
already knew about the case. He interrupted Steve after only a short
time, since (so it appeared) he did notneed to hear any more because
he knew the facts already. The Ambassador said that the Supreme
Court judgment was the result of corruption. The specific words he
used were ‘You know what this is, right? It’s corruption.’ He did
not say that it sounded like it could be corruption or that there was
any uncertainty — he said it was corruption. I was astonished. The
Ambassador continued by explaining that the previous

Request for Arbitration, {50

544.

545.

546.

administration had been very corrupt, and that this corruption had
extended to the Supreme Court.” °°
This statement was corroborated by the witness statement of Mr. Lightfoot dated 9 May

2018. This included the following passage:

“While Steve was explaining about the Supreme Court judgment

that Bridgestone had received, the Ambassador interrupted, and said

that the judgment was the result of corruption, and promised that

with the new administration (a new President had been elected in

2014), there would be much less corruption.” !
In their Memorial, *? the Claimants allege that under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic
Relations an Ambassador is “the person charged by the sending State with the duty of

acting in that capacity,” and is a diplomat of highest rank with full representative powers,

so that it follows that the Ambassador’s admission of corruption was Panama’s admission.

In a witness statement made on 10 September 2018, the Ambassador flatly denied that he
had said that the Supreme Court Judgment was the result of corruption.®* He said that he
could not have done so because he knew neither the names of the parties to the litigation,

nor the names of the judges who had sat on the case. °*4

On 28 August 2019, Mr. Gonzalez-Revilla, who had retired from his post as Ambassador,
gave evidence by video link. It was put to him by Mr. Williams that at the meeting on 13
March 2015 he said that the judgment had been obtained by corruption. He denied this.°85
It was suggested that corruption might have been a topic of conversation and he said that

he had no recollection of this. °°

The Tribunal would not discount the possibility thatatthe meeting on 13 March 2015 some

casual mention might have been made of corruption, of a kind that would not necessarily

have lingered in the memory. Itis equally confident that if the Ambassador had made a
statement that the Supreme Court Judgment had been obtained by corruption, he would
have remembered this. Furthermore, it would have led Bridgestone’s representatives to
further immediate protest, and it would have been a prominent feature of the Request for
Arbitration. The Tribunal accepts the Ambassador’s evidence that he made no such

statement.

4. Conclusion on Liability

A judgment that had held BSJ and BSLS liable in damages simply for exercising their
procedural right to file an objection to an application to register the RIVERSTONE
trademark would have been startling indeed. This was not sucha case, however. After the
detailed analysis that this Arbitration has involved, the Tribunal understands the reasoning
that led the Majority of the Supreme Court to reach its decision. Ithas identified defects
in that reasoning, but these are no more than errors of judgment. They fall far short of
demonstrating that the judgment was the product of incompetence or corruption. For these

reasons, the claims of BSAM and BSLS must be dismissed.

DAMAGES

In its Counter Memorial, Panama remarked that to award damages the Tribunal had first to
determine that Panama had breached its obligations under the TPA.°®” As we have found
that Panama did not do this, the question of damages does not arise. Nevertheless, because
so much of the Hearing was devoted to quantum, and because the Tribunal has formed a

firm view in relation to this, it proposes briefly to set out its findings.

7 Resp.C-Mem.,4161.

162

549.

552.

The Claim for Damages Awarded by the Supreme Court

1. The Issue

The Supreme Court awarded in favour of Muresa and TGFL damages and advocates fees
in the sum of US$ 5,431,000 against BSJ and BSLS jointly and severally. BSLS
discharged the whole of this judgment debt.

BSLS claims thatthe whole of this sum constitutes “/oss or damage by reason of, or arising

out of ®8 the Supreme Court Judgment that it has incurred.

Panama claims that no part of this sum constitutes loss incurred by BSLS. This is because
the funds used by BSLS to discharge the debt were provided in their entirety by BSAM, in
circumstances where BSLS will not be required to repay this sum unless it succeeds in its

current claim.

Should this argument not succeed, Panama alleges that it has a partial answer to the claim.
Panama contends that as BSJ and BSLS were equally responsible for the payment of the
Supreme Court Judgment, BSLS cannot recover the entire amount paid.°8? Panama
accuses the Claimants of falsely asserting to the Tribunal that there are no documents
demonstrating a formal agreement between BSLS and BSJ as to the appointment of loss,
and argues that internal communications in May 2016 and a 2016 Resolution of BSLS’s
Board of Directors demonstrate the opposite. According to Panama, at the time of the
Supreme Court Judgment, an agreement existed between BSLS and BSJ under which the
cost of discharging the judgment debt fell to be shared equally between them. That
agreement was varied so as to provide that the entire liability would be notionally bome by

BSLS. By agreeing to that variation, BSLS acted in breach of its obligation to mitigate its

loss. In those circumstances, its loss is restricted to 50% of the judgement debt.! Put
another way, Panama argues that BSLS had an opportunity to mitigate its loss and instead
of doingso, ittook action designed to ensure that it sustained the entire loss; in consequence
any award should be reduced so as to restrict BSLS’ recovery to 50% of the loss.°%?
Moreover, Panama “emphatically” opposes the Claimants’ contention that BSLS made the
payment of the Supreme Court Judgment in full because FIRESTONE is the historically
more significant brand, and it argues that the evidence shows that the funds were funnelled
through BSLS for reasons that had to do with this arbitration, namely, that only BSLS (and

not BSJ) could bring a claim against Panama under the TPA.%?

In turn, the Claimants oppose Panama’s contention that BSLS should not recover for the
full amount. The Memorial appears to argue that BSLS is entitled to recover the whole
sum, on the basis of the international law principle of full reparation.©4 The Claimants
have further explained that the full payment ordered by the Supreme Court Judgment was
made by BSLS alone (with no role by BSJ) “because that was what it agreed with BSJ”
given thatin the Americas FIRESTONE has historically been the more significant brand.°>
According to the Claimants, as both BSJ and BSLS had been held jointly and severally
liable by the Supreme Court, they were at liberty to decide which one should pay depending
on their corporate needs.®° The Claimants further submit that it was BSLS (not BSJ) who
was facing the imminent enforcement actions; BSLS took into account tax issues; and
finally, that “BSLS took into account that it had standing to bring the present arbitration

claim to recover the sum paid, whereas BSJ did not.”®®

The Claimants go on to argue that in the absence of guidance in the TPA, the Tribunal may
look to any agreement between the two jointly liable parties to determine how to apportion
loss, but explain that there are no documents demonstrating such formal agreement
between BSJ and BSLS.°% This said, the Claimants submit that the loan agreement
between BSLS and BSAM as well as Mr. Kingsbury’s testimony demonstrate the
Bridgestone’s Group approach, i.e. that BSAM and BSLS are generally responsible for

matters in the Americas (not BSJ). 7

The Claimants further submit that there is no evidence that BSLS has any right to
contribution (either contractual or non-contractual) from BSJ with respect to payment of
the Supreme Court Judgment, and deny that the agreement between BSLS and BSJ of
January 2010 or a 2016 BSLS board resolution indicate otherwise.”' They go on to
contend that, even if there were a right to contribution from BSJ, “it does not make sense

to suggest that BSLS should mitigate its loss by seeking to recover from BSJ.”7"

The Claimants go on to argue that the Tribunal should simply assess whether BSLS has
acted reasonably. They submit that “it was reasonable for BSLS to pay the full USD $5.4
million” and “[i]f BSLS and BSJ agreed that BSLS would pay the full amount and then be
entitled to retain all of the proceeds of the present arbitration, then that was a matter for

them,” and it was not unreasonable in the circumstances. 73

2. The Facts
The full facts have only emerged late in the course of the proceedings as a result of failure

by the Claimants to make timely discovery of some of the relevant documentation.

On 1 January 2010, BSJ and BSLS entered into an agreement (the “2010 Agreement”)

under which they agreed to split 50-50 “the entire disbursement cost ofall the trademark

actions taken against the third party in the name of BSJ and BSLS to protect both
BRIDGESTONE and FIRESTONE trademarks.”

On 20 July 2016, the Board of BSLS passed a Resolution recording and authorizing (i) the
entry into an agreement (the “2016 Agreement”) with BSJ; and (ii) a loan agreement (the
“BSA Loan Agreement’) under which BSLS would borrow from BSAM the funds needed
to give effect to the 2016 Agreement.”

The terms of the 2016 Agreement first recited the terms of the 2010 Agreement and then

went on to provide:

“WHEREAS, in connection with the payment of the Judgment
Amount, the Corporation [BSLS] and the Parent [BSJ] propose to
agree that (i) despite the 2010 Agreement the Corporation [BSLS]
will pay, and bear the entire financial burden of, such payment, and
(ii) the Corporation [BSLS] will be entitled to initiate, and keep the
entire financial benefit of any recovery from, any investor-state
arbitration or any other actions against the Republic of Panama (the

‘2016 Agreement’).”706
Pursuant to these agreements, BSAM advanced to BSLS and BSLS paid in discharge of
the judgment debt the full amount of US$ 5,431,000.

3. The Tribunal’s Analysis

The 2010 Agreement did not, in terms, purport to cover a liability to pay damages under a
claim in tort brought by a third party against whom trademark proceedings had been
brought. The 2016 Agreement was none the less concluded on the assumption that the
2010 Agreement applied to the judgment debt. The Tribunal considers that this was a

reasonable implication, and proceeds on the basis that it was correct. Thus, but for the

2016 Agreement, BSLS and BSJ would have been bound by an agreement to discharge the

Supreme Court Judgment debt in equal shares.

The object of the 2016 Agreement was clearly to enable BSLS to seek to recover the entire

amount of the Supreme Court Judgment debt from Panama in these proceedings.

The Tribunal does not consider the source of the funds used by BSLS to discharge its
liability under the Supreme Court Judgment debt to be material to the question of whether
this constituted a loss suffered by BSLS. Had the Supreme Court Judgment held BSLS
alone liable to pay that sum, and had BSAM put it in funds to enable it to do so, BSLS
would still have been entitled to rely on its paymentas a loss that it had suffered as a result
of the Judgment. Where it had obtained the funds would not have been relevant. To use a
useful Latin phrase, this would have been “res inter alios acta.” The same is true of its

joint and severable liability with BSJ.

What is material, however, is that at the time of the Supreme Court Judgment, BSLS had
a contractual right to call upon BSJ to pay half of their joint liability. BSLS could have
exercised that right in mitigation of its loss. Instead, it deliberately entered into an
agreement that removed any right to make a claim against BSJ for 50% of the Supreme
Court Judgment debt. Thus, it was not open to BSLS to rely upon its deliberate
abandonment of its right to mitigate to seek to recover the additional 50% under the TPA.
That 50% was nota loss it suffered by reason of the Supreme Court Judgment. It was a
loss it suffered by reason of entering into the 2016 Agreement. Had BSLS succeeded on
the issue of liability in this arbitration, its recovery in relation to the debt arising out of the

Supreme Court Judgment would have been limited to 50% of the amount that it paid.

BSAM and BSLS?’ Joint Claim

The major claim in these proceedings has been the joint claim of BSAM and BSLS to
alleged damage to their respective trademark rights. The Tribunal can deal with this claim

very shortly.

The basis of this claim was a submission that the allegedly aberrant Supreme Court

Judgment had an impact on the value of the BRIDGESTONE and FIRESTONE

167

570.

trademarks, and indeed on the value of trademarks in general, in Panama and more widely.
The Claimants have been unable to produce a scintilla of evidence to support this

proposition.

At the Hearing, Ms. Kepchar for the Claimants told the Tribunal that Mr. Daniel would
establish that the Claimants “as rights-holders to the BRIDGESTONE and FIRESTONE
marks” had incurred damage as a result of the Supreme Court Judgment.”°7 As Mr. Daniel
gave evidence it became apparent that Mr. Daniel, the Claimants’ principal expert on this
aspect of the case, had been assuming that some other witness was going to prove that, as.
a result of the Supreme Court Judgment, the BRIDGESTONE and FIRESTONE marks fell
to be valued as no longer exclusive. His task, as he had seen it, was simply to evaluate this

change in money terms.

No evidence was given to justify the assumption upon which Mr. Daniel had proceeded.
No witness gave evidence that the Supreme Court Judgment had affected the value of
trademarks in Panama, or indeed that it had had any general effect at all. Mr. Molino, the
Claimants’ expert on patent law and practice in Panama, and Ms. Lasso de la Vega,
Panama’s expert in this field, were agreed that the Supreme Court Judgment had not been

mentioned in any intellectual property case over the last five years. 78

It would not be strictly accurate to state that the Claimants’ case on damages collapsed at
the Hearing, but rather that it became evident that it had always been built on sand. Had

the Claimants succeeded in establishing liability their victory would have been pyrrhic.

578. Panama explains that its “total costs” figure comprises both costs that the Tribunal has not
yet decided how to apportion; and costs that the Tribunal has in principle already awarded
to the Respondent.72! More particularly, the Respondent notes that the above total figure

includes US$ 146,986.00 pertaining to the Claimants’ Application to Remove Mr. Lee as

7! Resp. Costs, § 3(d)-(e) (emphasis in original and footnotes omitted). The Respondent notes that the U.S. Dollar
LIBOR is scheduled to be phased out. Resp. Costs,n. 14. During the Expedited Objections Phase, the Respondent
had quantified its costs and fees for that phase on US$ 1,691 447.72 (composed of USS 1,541,447.72 on legal fees
and expenses + US$ 150,000.00 on advance payments to ICSID), and it had asked the Tribunal to “order Claimants
(jointly and severally) to bear such costs and fees, with interest thereon at the rate of six-month LIBOR plus 2% per
annum from the date of the Tribunal’s ruling until the date of payment.” See, Resp. Costs Exp. Obj. 49 1,4.

accordingly.” Resp. Costs, n. 5.

should pay Panama “its reasonable costs in relation to the Application [to remove Mr. Lee
as Panama’s expert].”’”3 Accordingly, Panamaargues, irrespective of the allocation of any
other costs incurred during this proceeding, the Respondent should be granted the payment
of the US$ 146,986.00 for the costs derived from such application.7+

In addition, in its Statement of Costs dated 8 November 2019, the Respondent submitted
the following claim for the advances made to ICSID to cover the costs of the

proceedings: 725

 

| Description | Amount Claimed |
| Advance Payments to ICSID [s] 600,000.00 |

 

 

The Respondent submits that the ICSID Convention authorizes a tribunal to award costs
and legal fees against “abusive or unsuccessful claimants;”76 and it asks the Tribunal to

award “full costs and attorney's fees to Panama with applicable compounding interest.”””7

According to Panama, “[i]fever there was a case for the award of full costs, this is it.”728
Panama accuses the Claimants of engaging in “a variety of abusive tactics,””° including,
inter alia, (i) channelling funds through a shell subsidiary for purposes of manufacturing a
TPA claim;7° (ii) “approach{ing] representatives of Panama’s Executive Branch in hopes

of getting the Executive Branch to interfere with the independent judiciary;’7! (iii)

asserting a “speculative and remote” claim related to investments outside of Panama
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction;7** and (v) attempting to transform a courtesy meeting
with the Panamanian Ambassador to the United States into a wild allegation of corruption

and a binding admission by a sovereign State. 34

The Respondent further submits that in this case it “has confronted frivolous treaty
claims.”735 It observes that (i) BSLS and BSAM initially filed expropriation, national
treatment and most-favoured nation claims which were later dropped; 7° (ii) BSAM has
continued to pursue a “hopeless denial of justice claim for which it has no standing
[...];’737 (iii) BSLS “presses its denial of justice claim with total disregard for the well-
established principle that denial of justice claims are not appeals and are not opportunities
to revisit rulings on issues of evidence,” 73 (iv) the Claimants have asserted loss when their
financial statements show none;739 (v) BSJ, BSAM and BSLS “intentionally arranged for
[BSLS] to pay [sic] make the full payment [of the amount of the Supreme Court Judgment],
and then proceeded to hide this fact from the Tribunal in order to seek 100 percent
recovery;”79 and (vi) the Claimants have shown “contempt [...] for Panama, its
institutions, and senior officials throughout the case” in multiple ways throughout this
case, which Panama describes at length in its various submissions.”4! According to
Panama, the latest category includes, inter alia, the Claimants’ unsuccessful attempt to

disqualify former Supreme Court Justice Jorge F. Lee as an expert,” unsupported

accusations against the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Panama,”} gross
mischaracterizations of documents to discredit Supreme Court Justices,”44 and
inappropriate remarks about the credibility and character of a former Panamanian

Ambassador to the United States. 745

583. In its last written submission, the Respondent summarized the Claimants’ conduct

justifying a full award on costs and legal fees as follows:

“{...] Claimants have raised claims only to abandon them;
aggressively sought the production of — and expert access to —
sensitive documents, which they never discussed at the hearing, and
their expert did not even cite; made assertion after assertion without
ascertaining its accuracy; misled the Tribunal about the existence of
their own documents; pursued multiple meritless requests to
disqualify Panama’s experts; and [...] propounded a new and twice-
waived theory on a highly-technical question of Panamanian civil
procedure, demanded that a civil law practitioner disprove their
theory by citing ‘precedent’ from memory, sat silently and then
objected on the two occasions on which Panama offered to provide
the authorities, demanded two weeks to conduct the research that
they should have had on hand before embarking on this folic and
detour and labelinga former Supreme Court Justice ‘unsatisfactory,’
and then stated simply: ‘Claimants have decided not to submit [...]
legal authorities.”” 46

B. The Costs of the Proceeding

584. The costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, ICSID’s

administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in US$):

 

 

 

 

 

 

Arbitrators’ Fees and Expenses
Lord Nicholas Phillips US$ 227,198.26
Mr. Horacio A. Grigera-Na6n US$ 205,875.00
Mr. J. Christopher Thomas, QC| US$ 158,721.56
ICSID’s Administrative Fees US$ 158,000.00

 

78 Resp. Rej.,/287(d).
™4 Resp. Rej.,4.287(f).
5 Resp. Rej.,287(g).
76 Resp. PHB, 434.

174

585.

586.

587.

588.

 

Direct Expenses US$ 132,376.63
Total US$ 882,171.45

 

 

 

 

 

The above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in equal parts.”47
As a result, the expended portion of each Party’s advances to cover the above costs of the
arbitration was: US$ 441,085.72 (for the Claimants) and US$ 441,085.73 (for the
Respondent).

The Tribunal’s Decision
Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:

“Tn the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as

the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the

parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide howand

by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of

the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre

shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.”
There is a degree of hyperbole in Panama’s submissions, but a degree of truth as well. BSJ
and BSLS were unlucky to lose in the Supreme Court for the reasons that we have given,
but they over-reacted. Faced with allegations of judicial corruption and incompetence of
their highest court, Panama was justified in deploying lawyers and experts of high standing

to meet the case made against it. There is, nonetheless a very significant difference

between the costs incurred by the Claimants and those incurred by the Respondent.

The Tribunal has concluded that justice will be served by ordering the Claimants to
reimburse the Respondent the expended portion of the advances paid by the Respondent to
ICSID, and to pay US$ 6.5 million towards Panama’s legal costs and expenses. The
amount of US$ 6.5 million includes the costs associated with the Application to Remove

Mr. Lee (which the Respondent has quantified in US$ 146,986.00).

7 The ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with a Final Financial Statement of the case account. Theremaining
balanceshall be reimbursed to the Parties based on thepayments thatthey advanced to ICSID.

175

589.

590.

Accordingly, the Tribunal declares that the Claimants are jointly and severally liable to pay
the Respondent: (i) US$ 441,085.73 for the expended portion of the Respondent’s advances
to ICSID; and (ii) US$ 6,500,000.00 to cover a reasonable proportion of the Respondent’s
legal fees and expenses, together with interest on each of these sums at the Wall Street

Journal Prime Rate plus 2% from the date of this Award to the date of full payment.

AWARD
For the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides as follows:

(ji The Claimants’ claim is dismissed;
(ii) The Claimants shall pay the Respondent US$ 6,941,085.73 (being the total of (i)

and (ii) in § 589 supra) together with interest at the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate
plus 2% from the date of this Award to the date of full payment.

En el ejercicio de sus derechos procesales, la parte Demandante
oportunamente interpuso Recurso de Apelacion en contra de la
Sentencia de primera instancia, siendo de conocimiento dicho Recurso
por parte del Primer Tribunal Superior del Primer Distrito Judicial de
Panama, quien resolvid la alzada a través de la Resolucién de 23 de
mayo de 2013, exponiéndose en la parte resolutiva de dicho fallo lo

siguiente:

la Republica y por autoridad de la Ley,
MODIFICA la Sentencia No. 70 del 17 de
diciembre de 2010, dictada por el Juzgado
Undécimo de Circuito del Primer Circuito Judicial
de Panama, Ramo Civil; en el sentido de
Declarar NO PROBADA la _ Excepcidn de
Ilegitimidad en la Causa de la sociedad TIRE
GROUP OF FACTORIES LTD, S.A., alegada por
las demandadas.

SE CONFIRMA en todo lo demas.”

Es contra esta decisién de segunda instancia que la Recurrente ha
interpuesto el presente Recurso de Casacién que esta Sala de lo Civil se

avoca a resolver.

RECURSO DE CASACION
El Recurso de Casacién interpuesto es en el fondo y se invoca un
concepto de la Causal de Infraccién de Normas Sustantivas de Derecho,
el que corresponde al de error de hecho en cuanto a la existencia de la
prueba.
Este concepto invocado se fundamenta a través de seis Motivos
que se exponen a continuacion:

“PRIMERO: E| Primer Tribunal Superior del
Primer Distrito Judicial de Panama, al emitir el
fallo ignoré completamente el documento en
idioma inglés y debidamente traducido al
espafiol mediante traductor publico autorizado,
y que se lee de foja 2622 a foja 2628 y de foja
2955 a foja 2958 del expediente, en la cual los
abogados de Transnacional BFS Brands, LLC,
amenazan y le advierten a LV.
INTERNATIONAL, INC, marca de_ fdabrica
Riverstone, representante de MURESA
INTERTRADE, S.A., que se abstenga de
cualquier registro y uso de la marca Riverstone,
tanto dentro de los Estados Unidos de América
como en cualquier otro pais; y de usar la marca,
L.V. INTERNATIONAL INC., lo hacia abajo su
propio riesgo. Al no tomar en cuenta esta
prueba importante del proceso el Primer
Tribunal Superior del Primer Distrito Judicial de
Panama, incurrid en error de hecho sobre la

Page 5 of 31

 

 

 

existencia de la prueba, lo cual influyd
sustancialmente en lo dispositivo de la
resolucién recurrida, toda vez que dicha prueba,
ignorada demuestra el dolo y la temeridad de
las demandantes.

SEGUNDO: Tampoco el! Primer Tribunal
Superior del Primer Distrito Judicial de Panama,
tom6 en cuenta, al ignorar completamente las
certificaciones expedidas y suscritas por la
Contadora Publica Autorizada MIRMA_ R.
MOREIRA, con numero CPA 307-2005,
reconocida su firma ante notario publico,
contadora de la empresa MURESA INTERTRADE,
S.A. y TIRE GOUP OF FACTORIES LTD, INC.
dejaron de vender a nivel internacional la suma
de cinco millones ciento sesenta y ocho mil
doscientos setenta ddlares con cincuenta seis
centavos (USD$5,168,270.56), incurriendo en
error de hecho sobre la existencia de la prueba
lo cual influyé sustancialmente en lo dispositivo
de la resolucién recurrida, toda vez que si no
hubiera ignorado esta prueba importante del
Proceso hubiera reconocido que la_ parte
demandada le causé a nuestras representadas
graves perjuicios econémicos con su conducta.

TERCERO: El Primer Tribunal Superior del
Primer Distrito Judicial de Panama no valoré,
sino que ignord completamente, lo que consta
en la resolucién de 8 de septiembre de 2006 del
Tercer Tribunal Superior del Primer Distrito
Judicial de Panama consultable de fojas 37 a
foja 38 del expediente, en donde consta el
hecho o conducta dolosa y de mala fe de la
parte demandada, quien luego de oponerse al
registro de la marca Riverstone de nuestras
representadas y de anunciar apelacién contra el
fallo que le neg6 la oposicién desistid de dicho
recurso. Al no tomar en cuenta esta prueba
documental que es un documento, al ad-quem
incurrié en error de hecho sobre la existencia de
la prueba, influyendo sustancialmente en lo
dispositivo de la resolucién recurrida, y que de
haberlo tomado en cuenta hubiese dado por
probado el dafio causado por la demanda a
nuestras representadas.

CUARTO: El Primer Tribunal Superior del Primer
Distrito Judicial de Panama ignoré las pruebas
testimoniales de los sefiores JOSE ORESTES
MEDINA SAMANIEGO, consultable de foja 553 a
foja 564; DOMINGO ESTEBAN ROMERO
CEVALLOS, foja 565 a foja 569; GRICELDA

PINEDA CASTILLO, consultable de foja 575 a

consultable de foja 634 a foja 643, LAURA
ESTHER MURGAS DE BRACHO, de foja 647 a
foja 655 del expediente, todos empleados de
nuestras representadas y que conocen del
movimiento de venta de lIlantas, quienes
concuerdan en modo tiempo y lugar, que
nuestras representadas no pudo efectuar sus
ventas de sus llantas Riverstone, por causa de
la oposicién a la solicitud del registro de | misma
marca y las amenazas de la Transnacional
BRIDGESTONE, por lo que incurrid el ad-quem
en error de hecho sobre la existencia de la
prueba, que influyd sustancialmente en lo
dispositivo de la disposicién recurrida, al no dar
por acreditado el dafio causado por las
demandadas

QUINTO: Tampoco el Primer Tribunal Superior
del Primer Distrito Judicial de Panama tomo en
cuenta la declaracién testimonial rendida por
FERNAN JESUS LUQUE GONZALEZ, ver de foja
603 a foja 616 y JORGE ALBERTO LUQUE
GONZALEZ, consultable de foja 657 a 661 del
expediente, quienes en su _ deposicién
manifestaron que les consta que hubo una
amenaza mediante una carta proveniente de
BFS BRANDS , LLC (BRIDGESTONE) en los
Estados Unidos de América, asi como la accion
de secuestro y de impugnacién contra la marca
RIVERSTONE en Republica Dominicana, Chinas
y otros paises, lo que condujo a nuestras
representadas a temer por acciones en su
contra, que impidié la venta de las llantas d ela
marca RIVERSTONE, durante la oposicién al
registro de la misma, con lo cual incurriéd el ad-
quem en error de hecho sobre la existencia de
la prueba que influyo en lo dispositivo de la
resolucién recurrida, debido a que por ignorar
dicha prueba no dio por probado el dolo y la
mala fe de las demandadas, asi como los dafios
y perjuicios causados.

SEXTO: El Primer Tribunal Superior del Primer
Distrito Judicial de Panama tampoco tomé en
cuenta en su fallo el informe pericial contable
rendido por el perito PSIQUIES DE LEON Y JOSE
ANTONIO AGUILAR, consultable de foja 2635 a
foja 2642 del expediente y la deposicién e
interrogatorio a dichos peritos que se lee de foja

Page 7 of 31

 

 

 

3639 a foja 3663, quienes concluyeron que
nuestras representadas tuvieron una notoria
disminucién en las ventas durante el periodo
2005-2008, por dafios causados por
BRIDGESTONE valorado en cinco millones ciento
sesenta y ocho mil doscientos sesenta ddélares
con cincuenta y seis centavos
(USD$5,168,270.56) con motivo de la oposicién
al registro de la marca RIVERSTONE y a las
amenazas de las demandadas, con lo cual
incurriéd el ad-quem en error de hecho sobre la
existencia de la prueba que influyd en lo
dispositivo de la resolucién recurrida, debido a
que por ignorar dicha prueba no dio por probado
el dolo y la mala fe de Is demandadas asi como
los dafios y perjuicios causados.”
Como normas de derecho consideradas infringidas, se citan los
articulos 780 y 217 del Cédigo Judicial, al igual que el articulo 1644 del

Cédigo y el articulo 1 de la Ley No. 57 de 1978.

CRITERIO DE LA SALA

Como bien se ha sefialado anteriormente, el Recurso de Casacién
es en el fondo y se invoca la Causal de Infraccién de normas
sustantivas de derecho, por el concepto de error de hecho en cuanto a
la existencia de la prueba.

El concepto probatorio invocado, se produce cuando una prueba
que obra en el Proceso, no ha sido valorada por el Ad quem dentro de la
Resoluci6n recurrida, para lo cual es obligante que-su valoracion influya
en lo dispositivo del fallo atacado.

Asi las cosas, una minuciosa revisién de la Resolucién recurrida
evidencia que en efecto, las prueba a las que hacen referencia los seis
Motivos en que se fundamenta el concepto probatorio invocado, no
fueron valoradas dentro de dicha Resolucién. Esto es asi, toda vez que
el Ad quem Unicamente se limité a sefialar que de la revisién del caudal

probatorio que obra dentro del Proceso, no se desprende la pretensién

Page 8 of 31

 

de las demandantes, sin realizar un analisis minucioso del mismo, ni
identificar los elementos probatorios de forma especifica; refiriéndose a
las pruebas en forma general y global.

Lo antes expuesto deja en evidencia para esta Sala que si se
configuran los cargos de ilegalidad expuestos en los Motivos, al
demostrarse que las pruebas sefialadas no han sido valoradas por el
Tribunal Superior dentro de la Resolucién recurrida, por lo que ahora le
toca a esta Sala determinar si del andlisis y adecuada valoracién
probatoria de dichas pruebas se demuestra la pretensiédn de las
demandantes, influyéndose con esto lo dispositivo de la Resolucién
recurrida en Casaci6n.

En ese sentido, para esta Sala la pretensién del presente Proceso
Ordinario incoado por las demandantes, es el procurar de las
demandadas una indemnizacién por dafios y perjuicios ocasionados en
virtud de un Proceso que, con intenciones temerarias, las Sociedades
BRIDGESTONE LICENSING SERVICES INC. y BRIDGESTONE
CORPORATION interpusieron en contra de MURESA INTERTRADE,
S.A. y en donde fungieron como terceros coadyuvantes, las Sociedades
TIRE GROUP OF FACTORIES LTD. INC. y L.V. INTERNATIONAL
INC., lo cual les causo un perjuicio en la comercializacion y venta del
producto que consiste en neumaticos marca RIVERSTONE.

Asi las cosas, se desprende del primer Motivo en que se
fundamenta el presente Recurso de Casacién, que las Recurrentes
denuncian las pruebas documentales que obran de fojas 2622 a 2628 y
de fojas 2955 a 2958, siendo que en ambos grupos de fojas_ se
desprende la misma prueba documental que representa una traduccién

al idioma espafiol de una correspondencia emitida por las apoderadas

Page 9 of 31

 

10

judiciales de las demandadas a los abogados de las demandantes.

contenido de dicha nota es del tenor siguiente:

“Estimado Sr. Sanchelima:

Como es de su conocimiento, la Junta de
Litigios y Apelaciones de Marcas de Fabrica ha
emitido juicio en contra de su_ cliente,
sustentando nuestra oposicién y denegando la
solicitud presentada por su cliente respecto al
registro de la marca RIVERSTONE para llantas.

Favor notar que
Bridgestone/Firestone objetan cualquier
registro de la marca RIVERSTONE no solo
para su uso por llantas sino para cualquier
uso que se le de a esta marca de fabrica. Si
bien no estamos al corriente respecto al uso de
la marca RIVERSTONE para Ilantas en Estados
Unidos, Bridgestone/Firestone por este medio
le hace llegar a su cliente nuestra formal
solicitud en el sentido de que se abstenga
de utilizar la marca RIVERSTONE en los
Estados Unidos ya sea a la fecha de la
presente o en cualquier momento futuro.

Respecto al uso de la marca RIVERSTONE
en otros paises, favor también tomar nota de la
posicién de Bridgestone/Firestone en el sentido
de que nuestro formal requerimiento dirigido a
L.V. International Inc. al efecto de que se
abstenga de utilizar la marca RIVERSTONE no
se limita Unicamente a los Estados Unidos.
Antes de llevar a cabo un analisis pais por pais y
sin animos de hacer ninguna demanda en estos
momentos dirigida al uso de la marca
RIVERSTONE en cualquier otro pais en
particular, tanto usted como su cliente deben
estar al tanto de que Bridgestone/Firestone
objetan y de ninguna manera aprueban el uso o
registro de la marca RIVERSTONE para llantas
en ningun lugar del mundo. Por lo tanto, L.V.
International Inc. esta actuando en su propio
riesgo si decide utilizar la marca RIVERSTONE
en otros paises.

Atentamente,

Dentro del Motivo tercero, se denuncia la omisién en la
valoracién de la copia de una Resolucién judicial (fs. 37 a 39) emitida
por el Tercer Tribunal Superior de Justicia del Primer Distrito Judicial de
Panama, en la cual se resuelve admitir el desistimiento presentado por
parte de la firma de abogados BENEDETTI & BENEDETTI, apoderados
judiciales de la parte opositora, dentro del “Proceso de Oposicién a la
solicitud de registro No.120823-01 de la marca RIVERSTONE Y DISENO,
en Clase 12, propuesto por las Sociedades BRIDGESTONE
CORPORATION y BRIDGESTONE LICENSING SERVICE, S.A., en contra
de la empresa MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A., que tiene como terceros
Coadyuvantes a las sociedades L.V. INTERNATIONAL INC. y TIRE
GROUP OF FACTORIES LTD., INC.”

Se desprende de la valoracién de la Resolucién previamente
citada, que tal como asi lo mencionan las Recurrentes en el tercer
Motivo en que se fundamenta el concepto probatorio de error de hecho
en cuanto a la existencia de la prueba, el Proceso de Oposicién al
registro de marca respectivo, se encontraba en el Tercer Tribunal
Superior de Justicia del Primer Distrito Judicial de Panama en virtud de
Recurso de Apelacién interpuesto por la firma BENEDETTI &
BENEDETTI, en su condicién de apoderados judiciales de las Sociedades
BRIDGESTONE CORPORATION y BRIDGESTONE LICENSING
SERVICES, INC., siendo en esta etapa procesal en la que se presentd
desistimiento.

Respecto al cuarto Motivo, lo que se denuncia es la omisién en la
valoracion de ciertas pruebas testimoniales, siendo la primera de estas
denunciada, la que corresponde al testigo JOSE ORESTES MEDINA

SAMANIEGO (fs. 553 a 564), quien se identificd como empleado de la

Page 11 of 31

 

12

demandante MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A. y de cuyo testimonio se

desprende lo expuesto a continuacién:

“PREGUNTA #3: Diga el declarante si ha tenido
conocimiento, si contra el registro de la marca
de llanta RIVERSONTE se presentd algtin tipo de
oposicién a su registro en Panama y en otros
paises.

CONTESTO: En el afio de 2005 recién
ingresado a MURESA INTERTRADE como
Gerente de Venta de la empresa, se me
informa que existia una objecién del
registro de la marca RIVERSTONE
propuesta dicha objecién por BRIGSTONE
CORPORATION, que dicho proceso estaba
siendo ventilado en tribunales de Panama.
En ese momento se convers6 con la firma
de abogados para verificar si existia
oposicion en algun otro pais. Con base a
eso se determinaba que se_ estaban
deteniendo los procesos de registro en
china y Estados Unidos.

PREGUNTA #4: Diga el declarante dado que ha
manifestado que es Gerente de Venta de
MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A. donde se distribuia
oO en que paises se distribuia las llantas de la
marca RIVERSTONE antes de la oposicién a su
registro en la Republica de Panama.

CONTESTO: RIVERSTONE TIRE era una
marca ya posesionada en paises como
Colombia, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Hondura,
Salvador, Guatemala, Republica
Dominicana, Haiti, muy posesionada en
Cuba, Venezuela. Del lado de Asia y Europa
se vendia mucho en Singapur, Correa, Africa,
Portugal e internamente en China.

PREGUNTA #5 Diga el declarante en su calidad
de Gerente de MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A., y
dado que ha manifestado en respuesta anterior,
que la marca de llanta RIVERSTONE estaba muy
bien posesionada a nivel internacional, si lo
sabe , que ocurre después que. tuvieron
conocimiento de la oposicién al registro de la
marca en Panama, explique.

CONTESTO: Cuando nos enteramos de la
oposicién del registro de marca, tuvimos que
crear planes de contingencia dentro de la
empresa para tratar de manejar el mismo
volumen de venta o el volumen de venta de
la compajiia; a raiz de esto, tuvimos que
optar por ingresar con otras marcas para
satisfacer las necesidades de nuestros
clientes; dichas marcas como DOUBLE

Page 12 of 31

 

13

ESTART, JINYU, ingresar como marcas
JAPPINES, ingresamos con marcas como
CHAOYAN. Al ingresar con estas marcas
las cuales en su momento no poseian el
nombre o el conocimiento en el mercado de
ellas, nos lleva a tener que introducirlas
como precios mas bajos en detrimento del
margen de utilidad de la empresa, adicional
la negativa de mucho clientes de ser producto
que ellos no conocian, a lo cual cancelaban los
pedidos por temor a que fueran productos de
inferior calidad. MURESA INTERTRADE toma la
responsabilidad de homologar la garantia que
ofrecia sobre RIVERSTONE y trasladarlas estas
garantia a estas otras marcas, asumiendo el
riesgo que conllevaba vender un producto que
no se conocia su calidad” (lo resaltado es de
la Sala)

De igual manera se denuncia dentro del Motivo cuarto las
declaraciones testimoniales de los sefiores DOMINGO ESTEBAN
ROMERO CEVALLOS (fs. 565 - 569), GRICELDA PINEDA CASTILLO (fs.
575 - 585), AMINTA JULISA VEGA DE BARRERA (fs. 586 - 594), AIXA
YADIRA RAMIREZ GONZALEZ (fs. 622 - 628), MIRNA RAQUEL MOREIRA
MARTINEZ (fs. 634 - 643 9 y LAURA ESTHER MURGAS DE BRACO (fs.
647 - 655), pudiendo verificar esta Sala que de todos los testimonios
denunciados se desprende de forma coincidente el hecho que, por
motivo del Proceso de oposicién al registro de la marca RIVERSTONE
interpuesto en contra la Sociedad MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A., por parte
de BRIDGESTONE LICENSING SERVICES, INC. y BRIDGESTONE
CORPORATION, se generé un perjuicio comercial a la demandante -
recurrente, toda vez que se vio en la situacién de improvisar con otras
marcas, incluso de calidad inferior, a efectos de cumplir con la demanda
de venta que le exigia el mercado.

Se observa de lo denunciado en el Motivo sexto, que la

valoracién del informe pericial que obra de fojas 2635 a 2642 del

Page 13 of 31

 

expediente,

INTERTRAD

14

se desprende respecto a la demandante MURESA

E, S.A., lo siguiente:

“Pregunta 7: Cudles fueron los dafios que se
causaron a la empresa MURESA INTERTRADE,
S.A., por no poder vender sus productos, las
llantas RIVERSTONE y cual fue el resultado.
Respuesta 7; Las ventas de las Ilantas
RIVERSTONE realizadas por la empresa MURESA
INTERTRADE, S.A., durante el afio 2004 se
incrementaron en un 32% con relacién a las
ventas del afio 2003, y en el afio 2005 se
incrementaron en un 18% con relacién al afio
2004, a pesar de que en el afio 2005 fue el afio
en que se interpuso la demanda de Oposicién de
solicitud de registro 120823-01 de la Marca
RIVERSTONE Y DISENO, por BRIDGESTONE
CORP. Y BRIGESTONE LICENSING SERVICES,
INC. presentada el 5 de abril de 2005.

En los afios 2006, 2007 y 2008 las ventas
disminuyeron en relacién al afio 2005 en la
siguiente forma:

VENTAS DIMINUSION

(En Balboas) (En Balboas)
2005 5,364,132.54
2006 3,971,353.40 1,392,779.14
2007 4,717,299.89 646,832.65
2008 4,563,294.20 800,838.34

Disminucién total 3,351,731.15

Pregunta 8: Cudles eran las ventas
Programadas por la _ sociedad MURESA
INTERTRAD, S.A. durante los afios 2007 y 2008.
Respuesta 8: Las ventas programadas por la
sociedad MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A. durante
los afios 2007 y 2008 segtin las actas de junta
directiva acreditadas en el proceso fueron las
siguientes:

2007 B/.23,000,000.00
2008 B/.23,000,000.00

Segtin la documentacién presentada por la
empresa las ventas de las llantas RIVERSTONE
representaban el 35% de _ tlas_ ventas
programadas.

Pregunta 9: Cudles fueron las ventas efectuadas
durante los afios 2007 y 2008 de la empresa
MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A.

Page 14 of 31

 

 

 

15

Respuesta 9: Las ventas efectuadas durante los
afios 2007 y 2008 de la empresa MURESA
INTERTRADE, S.A. fueron las siguientes:

VENTAS TOTALES VENTAS LLANTAS RIVERSTONE %

(En Balboas) (En Balboas)
2007 17,186,091.25 4,717,299.89 32
2008 20,197,735.61 4,563,294.20 23

Pregunta 10: A qué se debid que no se
realizaran las ventas programadas por la
sociedad MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A. en los
afios 2007 y 2008.

Respuesta 10: Las ventas programadas por la
sociedad MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A. no se
realizaron debido a que la Marca de Fabrica
RIVERSTONE, principal producto vendido por la
empresa MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A. fue objeto
de una demanda de Oposicién a la solicitud de
registro 120823-01 de la Marca RIVERSTONE Y
DISENO interpuesta por BRIGESTONE CORP. Y
BRIGESTONE LICENSING SERVICES _ INC.,
presentada el 5 de abril del 2005. Y a pesar de
que la venta de las Ilantas RIVERSTONE, se ha
ido incrementando para los afios 2007 y 2008,
no han podido recuperar los niveles de
incremento que traian antes de la demanda.”

Asi también puede comprobarse de dicho informe pericial
contable, la disminucién en las ventas de la otra parte demandante, la
Sociedad TIRE GROUP OF FACTORIES LTD., INC., indicdndose que
para el afio 2005 las ventas de las llantas RIVERSTONE representaron el
56% de las ventas totales, en el afio 2006 disminuyo a un 33%, en el
afio 2007 a un 35% y en el afio 2008 a un 25%, especificandose que,
como causa de esta disminuciédn se le acreditaba al hecho de la
Demanda de Oposicién al Registro de Marca respectivo.

Advierte esta Sala que de las pruebas antes destalladas y sobre
las cuales se ha fundamentado la Causal de fondo invocada, las mismas
fueron incorporadas debidamente al Proceso dentro del término

oportuno y no consta dentro del Proceso que hayan sido objetados en

Page 15 of 31

 

 

16

cuanto a su autenticidad y veracidad, razén por la cual resulta
procedente la valoracién de su contenido de manera conjunta.

Ahora bien, de los hechos en que se fundamenta la Demanda
Ordinaria interpuesta por las Sociedades MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A.
y TIRE GROUP OF FACTORIES LTD., INC., resulta claro para esta
Sala que la Sociedad MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A. tiene un contrato
de distribucién, representacién y distribucién con la Sociedad TIRE
GROUP OF FACTORIES LTD, INC., desde el afio 2001 y que a su vez,
desde ese mismo afio, ésta Ultima Sociedad celebro contrato de
representacion y distribucién con. la Sociedad LV INTERNACIONAL INC.,
para todo lo relacionado a los neumaticos marca RIVERSTONE, lo cual
fue debidamente acreditado y no objetado a lo largo del Proceso.

Como pretensién fundamental del presente Proceso Ordinario, se
solicita la indemnizacién por parte de las demandadas BRIDGESTONE
LICENSING SERVICES, INC. y BRIGESTONE CORPORATION, y a
favor de las demandantes, a cubrir por los dafios y perjuicios
ocasionados en virtud de la merma en las ventas comerciales que
sufrieron, especificamente ante la situacidn de haber sido sujeta la
demandante MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A., a un Proceso de Oposicién
al Registro de la marca de neumaticos RIVERSTONE, producto que
representaba su mayor objeto de venta comercial y que ademas, al
decir de las Recurrentes, tal Proceso de Oposicién se apoyo en actitudes
temerarias e intimidantes.

Denuncian las Recurrentes que luego de la valoracién probatoria
denunciada en los Motivos en que se fundamenta el concepto invocado
de error de hecho en cuanto a la existencia de la prueba, lo cual ha sido

plenamente comprobado por esta Sala, al indicarse previamente que las

Page 16 of 31

 

 

 

17

pruebas denunciadas no merecieron pronunciamiento de valoracién por
el Ad quem dentro de la Resolucién recurrida, se demuestran los dafios
y perjuicios ocasionados a las demandantes, cometiéndose asi no solo
con la infraccién del articulo 780 del Cédigo Judicial, sino que ademas
se infringe lo preceptuado en el articulo 1644 del Cddigo Civil, en
concordancia con el articulo 217 del Cddigo Judicial.

El contenido de las normas citadas como infringidas es del tenor
siguiente:

“Articulo 1644. (Codigo Civil) El que por accion
u omisién causa dafio a otro, interviniendo culpa
© negligencia, esta obligado a reparar el dafio
causado.

Si la accidn u omisién fuere imputable a dos o
mas personas, cada una de ellas sera
solidariamente responsable por los perjuicios
causados.

Articulo 217. (Cddigo Judicial) Las partes
responderaén por los dafios y perjuicios que
causen a la otra parte o a terceros con sus
actuaciones procesales temerarias o de mala fe.
Cuando en el proceso haya prueba de tal
conducta, el Juez impondra la correspondiente
condena en la sentencia o en el auto que lo
decida, y si no fuere posible fija alli su monto,
se liquidard en la forma prevista en el articulo
996; si el proceso ha concluido, dicho tramite se
adelantara con independencia de aquél.”

De las normas previamente trascritas, sefiala el Recurrente que
su vulneracién se ve acreditada por parte de las Demandadas, en el
sentido del perjuicio que ellas le ocasionaron a las demandantes en
virtud de un Proceso de Oposicién al Registro de la marca de
neumaticos RIVERSTONE, sobre el cual ellas tenian desde el afio 2001,
el derecho de su representacién y distribucién, acciédn judicial que
sefialan se da de forma temeraria e intimidante con el objetivo de

causar perjuicio.

Page 17 of 31

 

 

 

 

18

En cuanto al hecho que la iniciativa juridica ejercida por las
Demandadas BRIDGESTONE LICENSING SERVICES, INC. y
BRIDGESTONE CORPORATION ocasiond un perjuicio a las
demandantes MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A. y THE GROUP OF
FACTORIES LTD., INC., resulta para esta Sala un elemento
plenamente comprobado del caudal probatorio que obra dentro del
Proceso y sobre el cual se fundamenta el concepto probatorio invocado
de error de hecho en cuanto a la existencia de la prueba; elementos de
prueba estos sobre los cuales esta Sala ya especificd a detalle al
verificarse los Motivos respectivos.

Los elementos de prueba como lo han sido los informes contables
periciales, evidencian lo que la marca de neumaticos RIVERSTONE
representaba a las sociedades demandantes, no solo en cuanto a su
representacion y distribucién comercial, sino como objeto de venta, al
ser una marca comercialmente posesionada y de reconocimiento en
cuanto a su durabilidad y comercialidad, situaciones que la habian
convertido este objeto en el elemento que generaba mayores ventas,
por consiguiente, mayores ganancias, siendo entonces consecuerite el
hecho de que, al verse este objeto excluido como producto de venta,
genero un impacto contable representativo en cuanto a los ingresos
contables de tales sociedades.

Esta situacién es igualmente evidenciada de las pruebas
testimoniales practicadas por los empleados de las sociedades
demandantes, quienes de forma contundente y coincidente reflejan la
crisis de venta que acontecid contablemente en los ingresos de
ganancias de las demandantes y que a pesar del uso de planes de

contingencia comerciales, no se pudieron igualar las ventas comerciales

Page 18 of 31

y colocacién en el mercado de los neumaticos marca RIVERSTONE,
producto del hecho que dicha marca comercial era objeto de litigio.

Ahora bien, pese al hecho que el impacto comercial tuvo al sacar
del mercado la venta de los neumaticos RIVERSTONE, lo que generé
dafios y perjuicios en cuanto a las ventas anuales de las sociedades
demandantes, situacién que esta Sala considera perfectamente
acreditada, el Ad quem considerd no acceder a la pretensién del
presente Proceso Ordinario, toda vez que estimd que no se cumplia con
la condicibn de acreditar la responsabilidad extracontractual
contemplada en el articulo 1644 del Cddigo Civil, por cuanto que
consideré no probada la culpa o negligencia de que habla dicha norma
como requisito indispensable para que se configurara la figura juridica
reclamada.

Si bien esta Sala comparte el andlisis doctrinal expuesto dentro de
la Resolucién recurrida por parte del Ad quem, de coémo y cuando es
considerada la responsabilidad civil extracontractual, no comparte esta
Sala la valoracion realizada por dicho Tribunal, al decir que de las
pruebas que obran dentro del Proceso no se configuran los
presupuestos de la negligencia por parte de las demandadas
BRIDGESTONE LICENSING SERVICES, INC. y BRIDGESTONE
CORPORATION, a la que hace alusi6n el articulo 1644 citado.

Esto es asi, toda vez que tal como asi lo han denunciado las
Recurrentes en el presente Recurso de Casacién, al observarse la nota
que obran a fojas 2622 a 2628 y de fojas 2955 a 2958, en la cual los
apoderados judiciales de las demandantes, de forma _ intimidante
indicaron interponer en varios paises, Procesos de oposicién a los

registro de la marca de neumaticos RIVERSTONE y ajfiadiendo sin

Page 19 of 31

 

 

20

fundamento juridico, al menos dentro de la legislacién panamefia, que
las demandantes deberian de abstenerse de la venta comercial de ese
producto, representa una actitud evidentemente intimidante y
temeraria.

En concordancia con la prueba documental indicada en parrafo
precedente, no pasa desapercibido para esta Sala la conducta procesal
de las demandantes en el presente Proceso Marcario, generando
confusién en cuanto a considerar la existencia de una buena fe, cuando
las Sociedades BRIDGESTONE LICENSING SERVICES, INC y
BRIGESTONE CORPORATION llevan hasta las ultimas consecuencias
procesales la iniciativa de oponerse al registro de una marca comercial
sobre un producto que convenientemente les resultaba comercialmente Na
competitivo, para luego de trascurrido un tiempo importante en litigio,
desistir de un medio de impugnacidn como lo es un Recurso de
Apelacién interpuesto sobre una Resolucién adversa a sus intereses.

Considera la Sala propicio citar al jurista panamefio Jorge Faébrega
Ponce, quien en su obra “Diccionario de Derecho Procesal Civil”, se
refiere a las conductas procesales temerarias y que causan perjuicio a
las partes, de la siguiente manera:

“TEMERIDAD Y MALICIA PROCESAL. La
temeridad procesal es la conducta de quien
sabe o debe saber que no tiene motivo
para litigar, no obstante, lo hace, abusando
de la jurisdiccién. Supone una conducta
majfiosa, la maniobra desleal, las
articulaciones de mala fe y sin apoyo
juridico o factico alguno. La malicia procesal
consiste en la utilizacibn de  facultades
procesales con el deliberado propdsito de
obstruir el adecuado desarrollo y decisién del
proceso. La temeridad procesal se
configura con el conocimiento que tuvo o
debi6 haber tenido el litigante de la falta

de motivo legitimo para promover o resistir
la pretensién. La malicia procesal se configura

Page 20 of 31

 

21

en los propésitos obstruccionistas y dilatorios en
las respectivas articulaciones....” (lo resaltado
es de la Sala) (Jorge Fabrega Ponce,
“Diccionario de Derecho Procesal Civil”, primera
edicidn, PLAZA & JANES, Editores Colombia,
S.A., Colombia, 2004, pag. 1242)

Cabe aclarar en este punto, que esta Sala no pretende, bajo
ninguna circunstancia, sefialar que el hecho de ejercer una iniciativa
judicial para la reclamaci6n de algin derecho, pueda interpretarse como
sindnimo de que los perjuicios que pueda ocasionar la misma a los
demandantes, resultando esto un elemento de coercién para quien se
considera con derecho a una reclamacién y en aras de utilizar los
medio que la ley le provea para hacerlo. Sin embargo, en cuanto a la
situacién especifica del presente caso, en el que existian pruebas
contundentes de que las demandantes recurrentes poseian con base
juridica el derecho de comercializar un producto que ademas constituia
un articulo de gran importancia en las ganancias propias de la actividad
comercial a la que se dedican y convenientemente un elemento de
competitividad comercial para las opositoras, pueda representar una
situacién central para quien pretende mermar comercialmente esa
condicién de posesién de mercado, sin respaldo juridico contundente y
con intencién de causar perjuicios por la competitividad comercial que
esto representa.

Y es precisamente esta situacién la que considera esta Sala que
se desprende de la conducta de las demandadas BRIDGESTONE
LICENSING SERVICES INC. y BRIDGESTONE CORPORATION, al no
poder considerarse de buena fe y por ende considerarse un actuar
negligente, el hecho de utilizar la iniciativa juridica de interponer sin

fundamento juridico en contra de las ahora demandantes en el presente

Page 21 of 31

 

22

Proceso Ordinario, cuando contra éstas presentaron una oposicién al
registro de la marca comercial de neumaticos RIVERSTONE, por lo que
tal actuacién causo perjuicios irreversibles en cuanto a lo central de la
actividad comercial a la que se dedicaban esas sociedades.

En consecuencia, esta Sala no solo considera que se han
configurados los cargos de ilegalidad expuestos en los Motivos en que
se fundamenta el presente Recurso de Casacién, al comprobarse que
los elementos probatorios fueron ignorados por el Ad quem dentro de la
Resolucién recurrida, sino que ademas, de la valoracién de los mismos
se demuestran los hechos en que se fundamenta la pretensién del
presente Proceso Ordinario, influyéndose asi lo dispositivo del fallo
impugnado en Casaci6n, razon por la cual procede casar la sentencia.

Como quiera que al haberse encontrado fundado los cargos de
ilegalidad expuestos en la Causal de fondo que corresponde al concepto
de error de hecho en cuanto a la existencia de la prueba, esta Sala
dispondra a casar la resolucion recurrida.

En mérito de lo antes expuesto, LA CORTE SUPREMA, SALA
PRIMERA DE LO CIVIL, administrando justicia en nombre de la
Republica y por autoridad de la Ley, CASA la Resolucién de veintitrés

SALVAMENTO DE VOTO
DEL MAGISTRADO HARLEY J. MITCHELL D|

A pesar de haber presentado mis observaciones y que estas fueron
acogidas parcialmente por mis compafieros, debo manifestar que no comulgo
con la decisién consignada en la resolucién prohijada.

Aunque el Tribunal Superior del Primer Distrito Judicial, no motivd
correctamente las razones por las que a su juicio no hay dafio, ya que no se
observa la contraposicién de las pruebas con los hechos. El acto considerado
dafioso: presentacion de "la carta temeraria" y la interposicién de demanda de
oposicion no son actos temerarios per sé.

Primero, porque la demanda de oposicién no implica la paralizacién del
uso de la marca, ni mucho menos responde a una medida precautoria. Respecto
a la carta, amén de las precisiones valorativas del propio documento, su
contenido no corresponde una amenaza, pues era decisién de la empresa
destinataria de la epistola, si emplear 0 no el uso de la marca, que segun ella
tenia derecho. No fue una imposicion por parte de la sociedad demandada.

En ese sentido, es dable analizar el problema del documento relativo a la
"carta" en el proyecto abalado. La decision no justiprecid su procedencia, como
llegé al proceso o si fue reconocida o no por las partes. Tampoco se dijo sobre el
tiempo en que fue creada y enviada, pues durante su confeccién se estaba
ventilando el proceso de oposicién de marca del cual las demandadas creian

tener derecho.

Page 24 of 31

A foja 2622 esta la primera carta, este documento es copia a color de un
documento con sello de notario que explica que las firmas fueron
cotejadas y que considera auténtica. Este documento emana de tercero y ello
no se dejé sentado en la resolucién. Esta copia no retine los requerimientos
necesarios a fin de que sea evaluada como prueba, el sello del notario no es
suficiente pues la considera auténtica, maxime cuando los documentos de
caracter testimonial que vienen de terceros deben ser reconocidos por sus
suscribientes. Mismo analisis recae para las fojas 2624 a 2628 y de la 2955 ala
2958 del expediente. Estas cartas por si solas no demuestran la temeridad o
mala fe de la otra parte.

La decision, como esta enfocada, crea un mal precedente en materia de
resarcimiento de dafios, toda vez que la posicién de las demandadas fue
presentar una demanda de oposicién creyendo tener un derecho de mejor valia
frente a las demandantes. La presentacién de procesos entre las partes,
obviamente crea molestias entre ellas, sin embargo, esto no es un simil de dafio.
La conducta temeraria debe probarse y los documentos no suplen a cabalidad la
cuota probatoria que las demandantes debieron aportar.

El abuso del derecho que las demandantes pretendian fijar es por la
interposicién de una demanda de oposicién (Hecho sexto de la demanda),
durante el proceso se introdujo la premisa de la presentacién de una carta
amenazante; no obstante, segin Jaime Javier Jované este concepto
corresponde al "irrespeto de los limites impuestos al ejercicio de un derecho".
("Abuso del derecho", fs. 66)

Este irrespeto debe mantener el dolo, la intencién de hacer dafio, ya que
involucra el concepto de mala fe y la temeridad, actos que conllevan una
intencién hacia un tercero. La naturaleza del abuso del derecho se cataloga
como “un acto de comportamiento "excesivo", donde se lesionan intereses de
otros sujetos". (op. Cit., fs. 72) Escenario que no aparece reflejado en el

expediente.

Page 25 of 31

 

En este tipo de temas: abuso de! derecho, temeridad y aplicacién del
articulo 217 del Cédigo Judicial, debemos hacer docencia con los casos, ya que
nuestra legislacién no tiene de forma taxativa qué es abuso de derecho y
temeridad, pero si lineamientos que describen conductas que lo conforman. Es a
través de la jurisprudencia que debemos enumerar las conductas que reflejarian
un abuso en el ejercicio de los derechos y apoyarnos con la doctrina. Esto ultimo
no se observa en la sindéresis que mis compafieros comulgan.

A modo de guisa, de acuerdo con este escritor, la presentacién de un
segundo proceso a pesar de que haya uno en curso generando la litispendencia
© la presentacién de procesos donde funge la cosa juzgada es una conducta
abusiva en el ejercicio del derecho del acceso a la justicia. Matiza este suscrito,
que si bien la conducta podria catalogarse como abusiva, esta debe ser
evaluada después de que las resoluciones que las declaran estan confirmadas.
Agrega este autor, que la recusacién de jueces sin la mayor explicacién de los
motivos, también es un caso de abuso en el ejercicio del derecho de litigio.

Asimismo, el Cédigo Judicial sanciona actos abusivos del ejercicio del
litigio pero no los tipifica como tal por ejemplo: el articulo 706 de nuestro libro de
procedimiento civil, que sanciona con multas a las partes que han perdido varios
incidentes dentro de un mismo proceso. El articulo 1071 que enumera los casos
en los que no haya buena fe, elemento que va de la mano con el abuso del
derecho, pues la mala fe responde a una conducta que revela que la parte se
excedié en el ejercicio de sus derechos, sea en el caso de su defensa o su
restablecimiento. El articulo 1075 que condena a la parte en costas cuando a
pesar de que se le debia, su despliegue fue tan abrumante que el demandado
tuvo que hacer frente a su exceso.

Igualmente, dentro del concepto abuso del derecho esta el fraude a la ley
y el fraude procesal, donde el primero "implica la intencién de burlar la eficacia

de una norma procesal dentro de un litigio" y el segundo, conlleva "vulnerar el

 

Page 26 of 31

 

ordenamiento juridico valiéndose del proceso" (Jaime Jované Burgos, op. Cit.,
fs. 179) En ninguno de los casos antes enunciados se contempla el hecho que
les ocurrid a las demandantes, mucho menos cuando siquiera hubo secuestro
de bienes.

Otro elemento, para no compartir el criterio que mis colegas han avalado
consiste en que en la demanda, las demandantes manifestaron que
producto del proceso oposicién, se dejaron de vender o comercializar el
producto RIVERSTONE Y DISENO, en cambio, la decision sefiala que los
dafios son por la disminuci6én de las ventas; por consiguiente, nunca se
dejé de vender el producto. (Ver hecho sexto de la demanda y foja 15 de la
resolucién)

No se confrontd lo dicho por los testigos que no fueron valorados por el
Ad quem, con la documentacién que obra en el expediente aportada por la
propia actora que revela que las marcas de menor calidad que presuntamente
fueron introducidas por las demandantes para enderezar el negocio, eran ya
comercializadas en conjunto con RIVERSTONE antes de la demanda de
oposicion (Véase factura de fecha 3/12/2003, fs. 456, factura de 20/7/2004, fs.
520 y siguientes hasta la foja 595).

Estas facturas detalladas comprueban que la actora compraba marcas
como JINYU, DOUBLE STAR (Factura a foja 520) que supuestamente eran de
menor calidad que RIVERSTONE, para balancear su negocio, lo cual no es
cierto, dado que siempre se comercializaron y desvirtua en parte, lo dicho por el
testigo ORESTES MEDINA que es citado en el proyecto. En sintesis, no se
compararon las fechas de facturas de fojas 456 hasta la 495 con los

delos de Ilanta pr introducidos como (DOUBLE START,
JINYU, JAPPINES, CHAOYAN).

Igualmente, la merma de las ventas fue por planes de contingencia por

miedos de un secuestro que nunca aconteci6 y no propiamente por la

formulacién de un proceso de oposicién.

Page 27 of 31

 

 

El testigo JOSE ORESTES MEDINA citado en la resolucién
sefiald:

“PREGUNTA 3. Diga el testigo cual (sic) fue la causa para
adoptar un plan de contingencia.

CONTESTO. En realidad lo que ocurria era un temor de que
existiese alguna instruccioén que consiguiera BRIGSTONE
CORPORATION que llevara a un decomiso o impedimento
de la venta de las llantas marca RIVERSTONE y era muy
delicado el hecho de tener inventario en bodega, mercancia
en transito y mercancia en fabrica con la marca
RIVERSTONE que no se pudieran vender por parte de
alguna resolucién en nuestra contra” (fs. 563)

Es decir, que este testigo en conjunto con Esteban Romero y Fernan
Jesus Gonzalez son cénsonos en sefialar que la merma de ventas fue por
decision de la propia empresa frente a una situacién ficta, ya que nunca
hubo interposicién de medidas cautelares, solo la existencia de un proceso.

Cond Pp iariamente a las debido a los miedos
comerciales de la otra es inadecuado.

Lo que se probd fue la disminucién de las ventas de acuerdo con los
peritos, cuyo nexo causal fue por decisiones comerciales de las demandantes,
pero nunca hubo una paralizacién del uso de la marca que alegaron las
demandantes en la demanda. (Tomo |)

Ello fue asi, porque segun los testigos, se tenia miedo de que hubiese un
secuestro por parte de las demandantes, lo que demuestra que la disminucion
de las ventas terminé siendo una decisién unilateral de las propias actoras.
(Declaracién de Domingo Estaban Romero, fs. 565 -569 y Fernan Jess Luque
Gonzalez, 608 a 616)

En consecuencia, el siguiente parrafo fue plasmado sin una debida ilacién
de argumentos que soporten su peso:

“Como pretensién fundamental del presente proceso
ordinario, se solicita la indemnizacién por parte de las
demandadas BRIDGESTONE LICENSING SERVICES, INC. y

BRIGESTONE CORPORATION, y a favor de las
demandantes, a cubrir por los dafios y perjuicios ocasionados

 

Page 28 of 31

 

en virtud de la merma en las ventas comerciales que
sufrieron, especificamente ante la situacion de haber sido
sujeta la demandante... a un proceso de oposicién de registro
de la marca de neumaticos RIVERSTONE, producto que
presentaba su mayor objeto de venta comercial y que
ademas, al decir de las Recurrentes, tal Proceso de Oposicién
al Registro de la marca de neumaticos RIVERSTONE,
producto que representaba su mayor objeto de venta
comercial y que ademas, al decir de las Recurrentes, tal
proceso ... se apoyé en actitudes temerarias e intimidantes.."

Continuando con el estudio de la sindéresis, encontramos la siguiente
contradiccién: “Ahora bien, pese al hecho que el impacto comercial "tuvo al
sacar del mercado la venta de los neumaticos RIVERSTONE, lo que generé
dafios y perjuicios..." (fs. 19 del proyecto). En !a decisién y en el proceso,
quedo demostrado que el producto nunca se dejé de vender y nunca se sacé del
mercado, solo hubo una disminucién de las ventas, por inferencias propias de
las demandantes.

Por otro lado, el proyecto adoptado no analiza qué es una conducta
temeraria. Sefialarle a un comerciante que se interpondra un proceso marcario
ges una conducta temeraria?. La Sala contesta que este es un caso especial,
porque habia pruebas contundentes de que las recurrentes podian comercializar
el producto. Esta respuesta, no es justificante, porque para que se hubiese
podido arribar al tema de la evaluacién de las pruebas, se tuvo que acceder a un
tribunal y a un proceso, donde un juez consideré que a las demandadas, no le
asistié su derecho.

Reitera el suscrito que la carta donde se desprende la presunta temeridad
no paso por fa criba de la Sala en cuanto a su autenticidad. Asi mismo, no se
motivé si quiera qué hacer frente a la decision del tribunal especializado
quien evalué la conducta de las partes como no temeraria en una
sentencia, la cual qued6 en firme. No se evalué la prueba que habia sido
objeto de la causal, solo se resefid su contenido pero no se razondé sobre su

impacto en el proceso y mucho menos en contraposicién con el resto de las

pruebas.

 

Page 29 of 31

 

Para una mejor comprensién transcribo el siguiente extracto:
“BRIDGESTONE CORPORATION Y
BRIDGESTONE LICENSING SERVICE, INC. seran
exoneradas del pago de costas, habida cuenta que
esta sede de administracién de justicia estima que
ha actuado con evidente buena fe; mantuvo y
sostuvo su posicién en proceso, aport6é material
probatorio id6éneo para demostrar su legitimacién en
causo, todo ello sin abusar del ejercicio del
derecho de gestién. Asi, sdlo estaran compelidas
a cubrir los gastos del proceso.” (El resalto es
nuestro)

Calificar como temerario el desistimiento de un recurso de apelacién, es
incorrecto, porque no es simil de una conducta temeraria, al contrario no hay
abuso de litigio. Las demandadas comprendieron que no podian seguir mas en
el proceso. El proceso no arribé hasta las ultimas consecuencias, como
esgrime el proyecto. Sancionar a las partes por decisiones procesales como
esta, es una posicién inadecuada en cuanto a la calificacibn de temeridad y
abuso de! derecho.

Finalmente, no se esta de acuerdo con la forma en que se motivo la
condena pecuniaria en este proceso. No hubo un analisis basado en argumentos
de como era plausible la condena por cinco millones de balboas, los cuales se
otorgan con poca fundamentacién juridica.

Decimos asi, porque citar el peritaje omitido sin que se vislumbre un
esfuerzo interpretativo de parte de la Corte y sin contrastarlo con el resto que
obra en el proceso, no es suplir el deber de motivar las decisiones, maxime
cuando hay una pregunta que habla de los dafios de MURESA (dajios con los
que el suscrito no esta de acuerdo) y en el peritaje omitido se calculé en B/.
3,351,731.15 (fs. 2638), el perito del tribunal justific6 que no se contaban con

documentacién de sustento, estudios especificos, proyecciones financieras

(aspecto imprescindible para poder comparar un dafio en ventas programadas),

Page 30 of 31

 

 

 

 

y que solo contaban con las ventas proyectadas de fotocopias, actas e informes

que se adjuntan. (fs. 1650)

El perito del Tribunal en cuanto a la determinacion de los dafios justificé lo

siguiente:

“No tenemos documentos que indiquen que hayan
tenido que suspender las ventas y las proyecciones
no fueron basadas en estudios y la empresa TIRE
GROUP OF FACTORIES LTD, INC, no dejé de
vender llantas de la marca RIVERSTONE.”.

Estas son en su mayoria todas las apreciaciones que me llevan a

SALVAR EL VOTO frente a mis colegas.

ENTRY N° 313-13
REPORTING JUDGE: OYDEN ORTEGA DURAN

MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A. and TIRE GROUP OF FACTORIES LTD., INC.
LODGE A CASSATION RELATED TO THE ORDINARY CLAIM FILED AGAINST
BRIDGESTONE CORPORATION and BRIDGESTONE LICENSING SERVICES, INC.

SUPREME COURT OF JUSTICE, CIVIL CHAMBER — 28 MAY 2014.
WHEREAS:

By Decision dated 4 December 2013, this Civil Chamber admitted the Cassation
Recourse lodged by the firm of BALLARD & BALLARD, legal representatives of
MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A., against the 23 May 2013 Decision issued by the First
Superior Court, First Judicial District, modifying Judgment No. 70 of 17 December 2010
issued by the Eleventh Civil Court, First Judicial Circuit of Panama, within the Ordinary
Proceedings initiated by MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A. and TIRE GROUP OF
FACTORIES LTD., INC. against BRIDGESTONE CORPORATION = and

BRIDGESTONE LICENSING SERVICES, INC.

After the allegations in the merits phase (pp. 4736-4755 of the file,) the Chamber

proceeded to rule on the Cassation Recourse, after the following considerations.
BACKGROUND

Through their legal counsel, MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A. and TIRE GROUP
OF FACTORIES LTD., INC., filed a greater claim against BRIDGESTONE

CORPORATION and BRIDGESTONE LICENSING SERVICES INC., seeking payment

1 of 26

of FIVE MILLION DOLLARS (US$ 5,000,000.00) for damages. The Ordinary Claim

was based on the following:

1,

2.

That Respondents BRIDGESTONE CORPORATION and
BRIDGESTONE LICENSING SERVICES INC., be ordered to pay our
clients, MURESA INTERTRADE, SA and TIRE GROUP OF
FACTORIES LTD, INC., the sum of Five Million Dollars of the United
States of America (US$ 5,000,000.00) in compensation for non-
contractual liability.

That Respondents BRIDGESTONE CORPORATION and
BRIDGESTONE LICENSING SERVICES INC. be ordered to pay the

costs and expenses resulting from the present proceeding.

The facts on which the claim filed by MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A. and

TIRE GROUP OF FACTORIES LTD, INC. was based are the following:

“ONE: On 5 April 2005 Respondents BRIDGESTONE
CORPORATION and BRIDGESTONE LICENSING SERVICES INC.
filed an application opposing Registration No. 120823-01 of the
RIVERSTONE Y DISENO brand against MURESA INTERTRADE,
S.A.

TWO: On 27 December 2001, the Plaintiff, MURESA INTERTRADE,
S.A., entered into a representation and distribution agreement with
TIRE GROUP OF FACTORIES LTD, INC. for various countries in
Europe, Asia, Africa and any other country in the area, to register
and sell RIVERSTONE Y DISENO brand products (tires.)

THREE: On 27 December 2001 Plaintiff MURESA INTERTRADE,
S.A., entered into a representation and distribution agreement with
LV INTERNACIONAL INC. for different countries in the American
continent, among them the United States of America, the United
Mexican States, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Belize, Costa
Rica, Canada, Nicaragua, Venezuela, Ecuador, Uruguay, Paraguay,
Haiti, Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, Dominican Republic and Colombia to
register and sell RIVERSTONE Y DISENO brand products (tires.)

2 of 26

FOUR: MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A. is the exclusive owner of the
RIVERSTONE Y DISENO brand, as established by Law 35 of 10
May 1996, approved in our country by Law 41 of 13 July 1995, the
Paris Agreement and the agreement on TRIPS, approved by Law 23
of 15 July 1997.

FIVE: MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A. authorized LV
INTERNATIONAL INC. and TIRE GROUP OF FACTORIES LTD,
INC. to register the RIVERSTONE Y DISENO brand internationally;
these products (tires) being sold in America, Europe, Asia and
Africa.

 

SIX: Given the lawsuit filed by the now Respondents
BRIDGESTONE CORPORATION and BRIDGESTON LICENSING
SERVICES INC., damages were caused to our client because they
stopped selling the RIVERSTONE Y DISENO as a result of the
lawsuit.”

The present proceeding was filed with the Eleventh Civil Circuit Court of the First
Judicial Circuit of Panama. Through Official Doc. No. 1293-07 the Court admitted the
lawsuit, and served notice to the Respondents, who in their reply denied the facts and

the amount claimed.

After the relevant procedural stages were completed, the lower court judge ruled
in the present proceeding through Judgment No. 70 of 17 December 2010, whose

dispositive part states the following:

“The undersigned Judge of the ELEVENTH CIVIL CIRCUIT
COURT, FIRST JUDICIAL CIRCUIT OF PANAMA, administering
justice on behalf of the Republic and by authority of the Law, within
the Ordinary process for civil liability initiated by MURESA
INTERTRADE, SA and TIRE GROUP OF FACTORIES LTD., INC.,
against BRIDGESTONE CORPORATION and BRIDGESTONE,
LICENSING SERVICES, INC., RESOLVES the following:

ONE: The Lack of Legal Standing objection regarding TIRE
GROUP OF FACTORIES LTD, S.A, alleged by Respondents
BRIDGESTONE CORPORATION and BRIDGESTONE
LICENSING SERVICES, INC. is admitted

TWO: The Claim by MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A., is denied.

3 of 26

The Court orders the Plaintiff to pay costs, assessed at THREE
HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED
BALBOAS AND 00/100 (B/.371,700.00).”

Exercising its procedural rights, the Plaintiff timely filed an appeal against the

Lower Court Judgment. The appeal was heard by the First Superior Court of the First

Judicial District of Panama, which ruled through the 23 May 2013 Decision.

Operative Part of the ruling stated the following:

"For the above reasons, the FIRST SUPERIOR COURT,
administering justice in the name of the Republic and by authority
of the Law, MODIFIES Judgment No. 70 of 17 December 2010,
issued by the Eleventh Circuit Court of the First Judicial Circuit of
Panama, Civil Branch, and declares that the Lack of Legal Standing
Objection regarding TIRE GROUP OF FACTORIES LTD, S.A.
company, alleged by the Respondent, IS UNPROVEN.

The Court CONFIRMS everything else."

The

It is against this decision by the second level Court that the Appellant filed the

present Cassation Recourse, that this Civil Chamber shall address.

CASSATION RECOURSE

The Cassation Recourse is on the merits. The Infringement of Substantive Legal

Rules is invoked, a factual error with regard to the existence of evidence.
The invoked NOTION is based on Six reasons, below:

“ONE: The First Superior Court of the First Judicial District of
Panama, when issuing the judgment, totally ignored a document
in English, duly translated into Spanish by an authorized public
translator (pp. 2622-2628 and 2955-2958 of the file,) where
counsel for Transnational BFS Brands, LLC, threatened and
warned L.V. INTERNATIONAL, INC., Riverstone brand,
representative of MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A., from refraining
to register and use the Riverstone brand, both within the United
States of America and in any other country; and if L.V.

4 of 26

INTERNATIONAL INC., did use the brand, it would do so at its
own risk. By ignoring such an important piece of evidence, the
First Superior Court, First Judicial District of Panama, committed
a factual error on the existence of evidence. In turn, this
substantially influenced the dispositive part of the Decision since
the ignored evidence proves that there was malicious intent and
recklessness by the Plaintiffs.

TWO: The First Superior Court, by ignoring the certifications
issued by MIRMA R. MOREIRA, Authorized Public Accountant,
CPA No. 307-2005, accountant to MURESA INTERTRADE,
S.A. and TIRE GROUP OF FACTORIES LTD, INC., did not take
into account that said companies ceased to sell internationally
the sum of Five million one hundred and sixty-eight thousand
two hundred and seventy dollars and fifty six cents (US$
5,168,270.56). The Court incurred in a factual error about the
existence of evidence which substantially influenced the
dispositive part of the challenged Decision. If the Court had not
ignored this important evidence, it would have recognized that
the Respondents’ conduct caused our clients serious economic
damages.

THREE: The First Superior Court completely ignored the 8
September 2006 Decision by the Third Superior Court of the
First Judicial District of Panama (pp. 37-38) which denotes
malicious conduct and bad faith by the Respondent. The latter,
after opposing registration by our client of the Riverstone brand,
and announcing they would appeal the ruling that denied the
opposition action, then withdrew their appeal. By ignoring this
documentary evidence, the upper court incurred in factual error
on the existence of evidence, substantially influencing the
dispositive of the challenged Decision. Had the court taken the
documentary evidence into account, the damages caused to our
client would have been proven.

FOUR: The First Superior Court of the First Judicial District of
Panama ignored testimonial evidence in the file by Messrs.
JOSE ORESTES MEDINA SAMANIEGO (pp. 553-564);
DOMINGO ESTEBAN ROMERO CEVALLOS (pp. 565-569);
GRICELDA PINEDA CASTILLO (pp. 575-585); AMINTA
JULISA VEGA DE BARRERA (pp. 586-594); AIXA YADIRA
RAMIREZ GONZALEZ (pp. 622-628); MIRNA RAQUEL
MOREIRA MARTINEZ (pp. 634-643); LAURA ESTHER
MURGAS DE BRACHO (pp. 647-655.) The aforementioned

5 of 26

were all our client's employees, who knew about tire sales
volume. They all agreed, in time and place, that our clients
were not able to sell Riverstone tires because of the opposition
to registration of the brand and the threats by multinational
BRIDGESTONE. Thus, the Upper Court incurred in a factual
error about the existence of evidence. This affected the
dispositive of the challenged provision, by not accepting that
damages were caused by the Respondents.

FIVE: The First Superior Court also ignored a witness
statement by FERNAN JESUS LUQUE GONZALEZ (pp. 603-
616) and JORGE ALBERTO LUQUE GONZALEZ (pp. 657-
661,) who stated in their deposition that they were aware of a
threat made by BFS BRANDS, LLC (BRIDGESTONE) USA, ina
letter, as well as an action of seizure and confiscation against
the RIVERSTONE brand in the Dominican Republic, China and
other countries. This led our clients to fear an action against
them that would prevent them from selling RIVERSTONE tires
during the opposition to registration. The Upper Court incurred
in a factual error about the existence of evidence which, in turn,
influenced the dispositive of the challenged Decision. By
ignoring such evidence the Court did not acknowledge that
there was malice and bad faith by the Respondents, and
damages.

SIX: The First Superior Court ignored an accounting expert
report by experts PSIQUIES DE LEON and JOSE ANTONIO
AGUILAR - (pp. 2635-2642) and the deposition and
interrogation by said experts (pp. 3639-3663,) who concluded
that our client’s sales suffered a considerable decrease during
the 2005-2008 period due to damages caused by
BRIDGESTONE worth Five million one hundred and sixty-eight
thousand two hundred and fifty and fifty six cents (US$
5,168,270.56) by opposing the registration of the RIVERSTONE
brand, and by their threats. The Upper Court incurred in factual
error on the existence of evidence, which influenced the
dispositive part of the challenged decision. By ignoring the
evidence, the Respondents malice and bad faith and the
damages they caused were not acknowledged.”

Articles 780 and 217 of the Judicial Code, as well as Article 1644 of the Code,

and Article 1 of Law No. 57 of 1978, are rules of law that were infringed.

CHAMBER’S OPINION

As previously stated, the Cassation Recourse is about the merits. We invoke an
infringement of substantive rules of law due to factual error regarding the existence of

evidence.

The invoked probatory issue occurs when evidence in the proceeding was
ignored by the Upper Court when issuing a decision; and when such evidence would

have had an influence on the dispositive part of the decision.

Thus, a thorough review of the challenged Decision shows that the evidence
referred to in the Six Reasons was ignored. The Upper Court only pointed out that a
review of the body of evidence did not support the Plaintiffs’ claim. The Upper Court did
not conduct a thorough analysis of the evidence, and did not identify any evidentiary

elements, referring to it in a general and global way.

The foregoing is proof that the Reasons do contain arguments of unlawfulness.
It has been shown that the aforementioned evidence was not assessed by the Upper
Court in the challenged decision. Now it is up to this Chamber to determine if an
appropriate analysis of said evidence supports the Plaintiffs’ claims, thus having an

influence on the dispositive part of the challenged Decision.

The Plaintiff's claim is aimed at obtaining compensation from the Respondents
for damages caused by a proceeding filed with reckless intentions by BRIDGESTONE
LICENSING SERVICES INC. and BRIDGESTONE CORPORATION against MURESA

INTERTRADE, S.A.; and TIRE GROUP OF FACTORIES LTD. INC. and L.V.

7 of 26

INTERNATIONAL INC. as interpleaders - which caused loss of RIVERSTONE tire

sales

It is clear from the Reason One herein that the Appellants gave documentary
evidence (pp. 2622-2628 and pp. 2955-2958.) Both groups of pages contain the same
documentary evidence, a Spanish translation of a letter from the Respondents’ counsel

to the Plaintiffs’ attorneys. Below is the content of said letter:

“Dear Mr. Sanchelima:

As you are aware, the Trademark Appeals and Litigation Board
issued a ruling against your client, supporting our opposition and denying
the request submitted by your client regarding the registration of the
RIVERSTONE tire brand.

Please note that Bridgestone/Firestone objects to any
RIVERSTONE trademark registration, not only to be used for tires but
for any other use given to the trademark. While we are not aware of the
use of the RIVERSTONE brand for tires in the United States,
Bridgestone/Firestone hereby sends its client our formal request to
refrain from using the RIVERSTONE brand in the United States,
whether as of the date hereof, or at any other time in future.

Regarding the use of the RIVERSTONE brand in other countries,
also please note Bridgestone/Firestone’s position, in the sense that our
formal requirement addressed to L.V. International Inc. for the purpose of
refraining from using the RIVERSTONE brand is not limited to the United
States. Before carrying out a country-by-country analysis, and not wishing
to file any claim at this time regarding the use of the RIVERSTONE brand
in any other country, both you and your client should be aware that
Bridgestone/Firestone object to, and in no way approve, the use or
registration of the RIVERSTONE brand for tires anywhere in the world.
Therefore, L.V. International Inc. is acting at its own risk if it decides to use
the RIVERSTONE brand in other countries.

Sincerely,

Peter G. Mack

Reason Three states that a copy of a Judicial Decision (pp.37-39) issued by the
Third Superior Court, First Judicial District of Panama, was omitted. Said Legal
Decision admits a withdrawal request submitted by the law firm of BENEDETTI &
BENEDETTI, legal representatives of the opposing party, within the "Opposing
Proceeding to Registration Application No.120823-01 of the RIVERSTONE Y DISENO
brand, Class 12,” filed by BRIDGESTONE CORPORATION and BRIDGESTONE
LICENSING SERVICE, SA, against MURESA INTERTRADE, SA, and Interpleaders LV
INTERNATIONAL INC. and TIRE GROUP OF FACTORIES LTD., INC."

From the aforementioned Decision, and as stated in Reason Three, it is clear
that the proceeding opposing brand registration was being heard by the Third Superior
Court, First Judicial District of Panama, by virtue of the appeal filed by the firm of
BENEDETTI & BENEDETTI, legal representatives of BRIDGESTONE CORPORATION
and BRIDGESTONE LICENSING SERVICES, INC. The withdrawal was filed at this

stage of the proceedings.

Reason Four addressed the failure to evaluate certain testimonial evidence. The
first testimonial evidence was provided by witness JOSE ORESTES MEDINA
SAMANIEGO (pp. 553-564), who identified himself as an employee of Plaintiff

MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A. Below is an excerpt of his deposition:

“QUESTION # 3: The Declarant please state if he knows,
regarding the registration of the RIVERSONTE tire brand
that there was any opposition in Panama or other countries.

ANSWER: In the year 2005, | had just joined MURESA
INTERTRADE as Sales Manager. | was informed that
there was an objection to the registration of the
RIVERSTONE brand proposed by BRIGSTONE

9 of 26

CORPORATION, that said process was being addressed
in Panama courts . At that time, we spoke with the law
firm to verify if there was any opposition in any other
country. Based on that, we were told that registration
processes in China and the United States were being
stopped.

QUESTION # 4: The Declarant please state, in your capacity
as Sales Manager for MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A., where
the RIVERSTONE brand tires were distributed before the
opposition to their registration in the Republic of Panama.

ANSWER: RIVERSTONE TIRE was a brand already
positioned in countries like Colombia, Costa Rica,
Nicaragua, Honduras, Salvador, Guatemala, Dominican
Republic, Haiti; very well positioned in Cuba,
Venezuela. In Asia and Europe it was sold in Singapore,
Korea, Africa, Portugal and China.

QUESTION # 5 The Declarant please state, in his capacity
as Manager for MURESA INTERTRADE, SA, and given that
in your previous reply you said that the RIVERSTONE tire
brand was very well positioned internationally, if you know,
what happened after the company became aware of the
opposition to the registration of the trademark in Panama.
Please explain.

ANSWER: When we found out about the opposition to the
trademark registration, we had to create contingency
plans to try to maintain the same volume of sales; as a
result, we had to choose to enter the market with other
brands to meet the needs of our customers; such
brands as DOUBLE ESTART, JINYU, JAPPINES, brands
like CHAOYAN. When entering the market with these
brands, unknown at the time, we had to offer them at
lower prices, to the detriment of the company’s profit
margin. In addition, there was denial by many customers
about a product that they did not know; they canceled orders
for fear of a product of inferior quality. MURESA
INTERTRADE took it upon itself to offer the same
RIVERSTONE warranty to the other brands, assuming the
risk involved in selling a product of an unknown quality"
(emphasis by the Chamber.)

Similarly, witness statements by DOMINGO ESTEBAN ROMERO CEVALLOS

(pp. 565-569), GRICELDA PINEDA CASTILLO (pp. 575-585), AMINTA JULISA VEGA

10 of 26

DE BARRERA (pp. 586-594), AIXA YADIRA RAMIREZ GONZALEZ (pp. 622-628),
MIRNA RAQUEL MOREIRA MARTINEZ (pp. 634-643 9 and LAURA ESTHER
MURGAS DE BRACO (pp. 647-655.) The Court noticed from all witness statements
that, coincidentally, due to the process opposing the registration of the RIVERSTONE
brand, filed against MURESA INTERTRADE, SA, by BRIDGESTONE LICENSING
SERVICES, INC. and BRIDGESTONE CORPORATION, the Plaintiff suffered recurrent
damages because they found themselves in a situation of having to improvise with other

brands, even lower quality brands, to meet sales demand in the market.

Reason Six mentions an expert report (pp. 2635-2642), which states the

following about Plaintiff MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A.:

“Question 7: What were the damages caused to MURESA
INTERTRADE, S.A., due to the company’s inability to sell their
products, the RIVERSTONE tires, and what was the result?
Answer 7: Sales of RIVERSTONE tires by MURESA
INTERTRADE, SA, during the year 2004 increased by 32% in
relation to 2003 sales; and in 2005 sales increased by 18% in
relation to 2004, despite the fact that 2005 was the year when the
Opposing Request to Registration 120823-01 of the RIVERSTONE
Y DISENO trademark was filed by BRIDGESTONE CORP. AND
BRIGESTONE LICENSING SERVICES, INC. on 5 April 2005.

In the years 2006, 2007 and 2008 sales decreased in relation to
2005, as follows:

SALES DECREASE

(Balboas) (Balboas)
2005 5,364,132.54
2006 3,971,353.40 1,392,779.14
2007 4,717,299.89 646,832.65
2008 4,563,294.20 800,838.34
Decrease in 3 years 2,840,450.13
Plus 18% increase 511,281.02
Total decrease 3,351,731.15

11 of 26

Question 8: What were the sales forecast by MURESA
INTERTRADE, S.A. for the years 2007 and 2008?

Answer 8: The sales forecast by MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A. for
2007 and 2008, according to the Minutes of the Board of Directors
submitted in the proceeding were:

2007 B/ .23,000,000.00
2008 B/ .23,000,000.00

According to the documentation submitted by the company, sales
of RIVERSTONE tires were 35% of the sales forecast.

Question 9: What were MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A.’s sales in
2007 and 2008?

Answer 9: Sales in 2007 and 2008 by MURESA INTERTRADE,
S.A. were the following:

TOTAL SALES RIVERSTONE SALES %

(Balboas) (Balboas)
2007 17,186,091.25 4,717,299.89 32
2008 20,197,735.61 4,563,294.20 23

Question 10: Why was MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A. unable to
meet its sales forecast in 2007 and 2008?

Answer 10: MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A. was unable to meet the
sales forecast for the RIVERSTONE Brand, its main product,
because of a request opposing Registration 120823-01 of the
RIVERSTONE Y DISENO trademark filed by BRIGESTONE
CORP. And BRIGESTONE LICENSING SERVICES INC., on 5
April 2005. And, despite the fact that the sale of RIVERSTONE
tires increased in 2007 and 2008, sales levels have not recovered
to what they used to be before the lawsuit. “

Such accounting expert report also shows a decrease in the sales of TIRE
GROUP OF FACTORIES LTD., INC., the other Plaintiff. For the year 2005, sales of the
RIVERSTONE brand were 56% of total sales, in 2006 they went down to 33%, in 2007
to 35% and in 2008 to 25%. The report states that decreases were caused by the

Opposition Request against the Trademark Registration.

The Chamber notes that the aforementioned evidence, on whose grounds the

merits are based, was duly and timely submitted to the Court, and does not appear to

12 of 26

have been challenged as to its authenticity and truthfulness. Thus, such evidence may

be assessed jointly.

Now, from the facts of the Ordinary Claim filed by the MURESA INTERTRADE,
S.A. and TIRE GROUP OF FACTORIES LTD., INC., it is clear that MURESA
INTERTRADE, S.A. has had a distribution, representation and distribution agreement
with TIRE GROUP OF FACTORIES LTD, INC., since 2001. In turn, since 2001 the
latter entered into a representation and distribution agreement with LV
INTERNATIONAL COMPANY INC., for everything related to RIVERSTONE tires. The

foregoing was accepted, and not objected to, throughout the proceeding.

A fundamental claim in the present Ordinary Proceeding is compensation
requested from Respondents BRIDGESTONE LICENSING SERVICES, INC. and
BRIGESTONE CORPORATION, by the Plaintiffs, to cover damages and losses caused
by a decrease in sales. Specifically, Plaintiff MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A., was
subject to a Request to Oppose the Registration of the RIVERSTONE tire brand. Said
product was the Plaintiffs best-selling product. In addition, according to the Appellants,

the Opposing Proceeding was reckless and intimidating.

Plaintiffs claim that the damages they suffered were proven when initially they
reported that the evidence they submitted had been ignored by the Upper Court. Thus,
there was a violation of Article 780, Judicial Code, and a violation of the provisions of

Article 1644, Civil Code, in accordance with Article 217, Judicial Code.

The content of the aforementioned violated rules are the following:

13 of 26

"Article 1644. (Civil Code). An individual who by action or
omission causes harm to another individual through fault or
negligence, is obliged to repair the damages caused.

If the action or omission is attributable to two or more
individuals, each of them shall be jointly and severally liable
for the damages caused.

Article 217. (Judicial Code) A party shall be liable for
damages caused to another party, or to a third party, through
a reckless, or bad faith, procedural action. When there is
proof of such conduct, a Judge shall issue a relevant penalty
in a judgment or order. If the amount were not established in
the judgment or order, the penalty shall be paid in the
manner provided by Article 996. If the proceeding has
concluded, this formality shall nevertheless be carried out."

The Appellants point out that violation of the above rules was carried out by the
Respondents, in the sense of damages caused to the Plaintiffs by virtue of an Opposing
Proceedings against the registration of the RIVERSTONE tire brand. Since 2001
Plaintiffs had had the right of representation and distribution of the brand. The legal

action was reckless and intimidating in order to cause harm.

With regard to the fact that legal action by Respondents BRIDGESTONE
LICENSING SERVICES, INC. and BRIDGESTONE CORPORATION caused damages
to Plaintiffs MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A. and THE GROUP OF FACTORIES LTD.,
INC. This Chamber fully verified the body of evidence, on which the notion of factual
error is based about the existence of evidence. These are items that the Chamber

addressed in detail when verifying the respective Reasons.

Evidence such as expert accounting reports show what the RIVERSTONE brand
meant for the Plaintiffs, not only in terms of representation and commercial distribution,

but also in terms of sales because it was a well-positioned brand, well-known for

14 of 26

durability and quality. Thus, the brand generated higher sales and, therefore, greater
profits. Consequently, losing this product had a substantial impact in terms of the

companies’ revenue.

The situation is also verified by witness statements made by Plaintiffs’
employees. Such statements clearly and coincidentally show a sales crisis, reflected in
the Plaintiffs’ earnings which, despite the implementation of contingency plans, could

not prevent the loss of sales or market position of the RIVERSTONE brand.

However, despite the commercial impact of removing the RIVERSTONE brand
from the market, and the damages caused to the Plaintiffs in terms of annual sales, the
Upper Court decided not to grant the claim in the present Ordinary Process, holding that
the requirement to prove non-contractual liability in Article 1644, Civil Code had not

been met - i.e., guilt or negligence as a fundamental requirement had not been proven.

This Chamber shares the doctrinal analysis set forth in the Upper Court’ Decision
t, about how and when there is non-contractual civil liability. However, we do not share
the Upper Court's assessment, that the evidence submitted does not show any
negligence by Respondents BRIDGESTONE LICENSING SERVICES, INC. and

BRIDGESTONE CORPORATION, as provided in Article 1644

The Appellants complained in the present Cassation Recourse, and the contents
of pp. 2622-2628 and pp. 2955-2958 show it, that the plaintiffs’ legal representatives
stated, in an intimidating manner, that opposition proceedings were going to be filed in
various countries against the registration of the RIVERSTONE tire brand. They also
added, without any legal basis, at least under Panamanian law, that the Plaintiffs should

abstain from selling the product. This is obviously intimidating and reckless conduct.

15 of 26

Together with the documentary evidence in the preceding paragraph, the
plaintiffs’ conduct in the Opposition Proceeding did not go unnoticed by this Chamber.
There were doubts about there being any good faith when BRIDGESTONE LICENSING
SERVICES, INC. and BRIGESTONE CORPORATION went to extremes to oppose the
registration of a product brand that was conveniently commercially competitive. Then,
after spending a significant amount of time in litigation, they withdrew the appeal they

had filed against an adverse Decision.

The Chamber considers it appropriate to cite Jorge Fabrega Ponce, a
Panamanian legal expert who, in his "Dictionary of Civil Procedural Law", refers to

reckless procedural conduct causing harm to a party as follows:

"RECKLESSNESS AND PROCEDURAL MALICE.
Procedural recklessness is a behavior adopted by
someone who knows, or should know, that he has no
reason to litigate and yet does it, abusing jurisdiction."
It implies crafty behavior, unfair maneuvering, bad faith
representations, and no legal or factual support.
Procedural malice consists of the use of procedural powers
with the deliberate purpose of obstructing a proceeding’s
proper development and decision of the proceeding.
Procedural recklessness is present when the litigant
knows, or should have known, that there was no legal
reason to file or challenge a claim. There is procedural
malice in the obstructionist and delaying tactics employed ....
"(emphasis added by the Chamber) (Jorge Fabrega Ponce,
"Dictionary of Civil Procedural Law", 4% Ed. PLAZA &
JANES, Editores Colombia, SA, Colombia, 2004, page
1242)

It is not this Chamber’s intention to say that initiating a legal action to claim a

right may be interpreted as a synonym for the damages that may be caused to a plaintiff

- thus creating a coercion element for anyone who feels entitled to a claim and to use

16 of 26

the means provided by the law to do so. However, in the present case, where there is
strong evidence that the Plaintiffs/Appellants had a legal right to market a product, that
such product was also substantially important to generate income and, conveniently, a
commercially competitive item, such a situation may be key for anyone who, with no
strong legal grounds and the will to cause damages to such commercial

competitiveness, wishes to jeopardize that party's dominant market presence.

This Chamber considers that the conduct by Respondents BRIDGESTONE
LICENSING SERVICES INC. and BRIDGESTONE CORPORATION is precisely a
reflection of such a situation. The Respondents behavior cannot be held as good faith
behavior; indeed, it is negligent behavior. The Respondents filed an action lacking in
legal grounds against the current Plaintiffs in the present Ordinary Process by opposing
the registration of the RIVERSTONE tire brand. Such action caused irreversible

damages to the key part of the Plaintiffs’ business activities.

Consequently, this Chamber admits the illegality claim set out in the Reasons of
the present Cause of Action, since it was determined that the evidence in the
challenged Decision was ignored by the Upper Court. In addition, an analysis of the
evidence proves the facts on which the present Ordinary Process is based, thus having
an effect on the dispositive part of the judgment challenged. This is why the judgment

must be overturned.

Given that the illegality claim has been admitted with regard to the notion of
factual error regarding the existence of evidence, this Chamber shall overturn the

challenged Decision.

MURESA INTERTRADE, S. A. and TIRE GROUP OF FACTORIES LTD. INC. LODGE
A CASSATION RECOURSE IN THE LAWSUIT AGAINST BRIDGESTONE
CORPORATION and BRIDGESTONE LICENSING SERVICIES, INC.

DISSENTING OPINION
JUDGE: HARLEY J MITCHELL D

Despite having submitted my remarks, which were partially accepted by my

colleagues, | must state that | do not agree with the decision issued in the Judgment.

Although the Superior Court, First Judicial District, did not correctly state why, in
its opinion, there were no damages - because there is no comparison between evidence
and facts - the alleged harmful act, submitting a “reckless letter’ and filing an opposing

petition, is not a reckless act per se.

First, because the opposing request does not imply that use of the brand should
be stopped, and it is not an injunction. Regarding the letter, apart from specific
clarifications, its content does not constitute a threat since it was the addressee’s
decision whether or not to use the brand - which the addressee thought it was entitled

to.. It was not an imposition on the part of the Respondent.

In that sense, one can examine the issue of the document related to the "letter."
The decision did not verify the letter’s origin, how it reached the proceedings, or whether
it was recognized by the parties. Nothing was said about the date when the letter was
drafted or sent, because when the letter was being drafted, the opposition to the

trademark registration was being heard.

19 of 26

Page 2622 contains the first letter. This document is a color copy of a
document bearing a notary’s seal that explains that the signatures were
compared and are authentic. The document emanates from a third party, and this was
not stated in the Decision. The copy does not meet the necessary requirements to be
considered evidence, a notary’s seal is not sufficient because it considers the copy as
authentic, particularly when a document of a testimonial nature, from a third party, must
be recognized by the individual who signed it. The same analysis applies to pages
2624-2628 and 2955-2958 of the file. These letters alone do not prove the other party's

recklessness or bad faith.

The decision’s approach, in this case, creates a bad precedent in the matter of
compensation for damages given that the Respondents’ position was to file an opposing
claim in the belief that it was their right to do so. Filing a claim between parties
obviously creates inconvenience, but it is not tantamount to causing damages. A
reckless conduct must be proven. The documents in this case do not fully meet the

evidentiary quota that Plaintiffs needed to provide.

The abuse of a right that the Plaintiffs intended to establish was related to the
filing of an opposing claim (Fact number Six,) and during the proceeding, the
introduction of a premise about the submission of a threatening letter. However,
according to Jaime Javier Jované, the notion is "disrespect of the limits imposed on the

exercise of a right.” (“Abuse of rights”, page 66.)

In such disrespect there must be maliciousness and an intention to do harm, and
involve the notion of bad faith and recklessness. These are acts that entail intention

towards a third party. The nature of abuse of a right is classified as “an act of excessive

20 of 26

behavior", where the interests of another individual are harmed.” (op.cit., pp. 72.) Such

a scenario is not reflected in the file.

In this type of issue: abuse of right, recklessness, and application of Article 217
of the Judicial Code, we must educate ourselves because our legislation does not have
a restrictive notion on what is abuse of a right or recklessness. However, we do have
guidelines that describe related forms of behavior. Through jurisprudence, supported
by doctrine, we must list the types of behavior involving abuse in the exercise of a right.

The latter, however, is not present in the judgment that my colleagues share.

By way of illustration, and in my opinion, initiating a second proceeding, despite
the fact that there is one proceeding in progress, or filing a proceeding that is res
judicata, is abusive conduct in the exercise of the right of access to Justice. Further,
although it could be classified as abusive, a behavior must be evaluated after a
Decision confirms it. | should add that challenging a judge without some explained

reasons is also a case of abuse of the exercise of the right to litigation.

Likewise, the Judicial Code sanctions abusive acts in the exercise of litigation,
but does not typify them as such, for example: Article 706, Civil Procedure Code, which
imposes a fine to parties that have lost several incidents within the same process.
Article 1071 lists cases where there is no good faith, which goes hand in hand with
abuse of a right, since bad faith results from a conduct that reveals that the party
abused the exercise of a right, whether in defending or reinstating said right. Article
1075 orders a party to pay costs when, despite being owed the costs, such party’s

expenditure was so overwhelming that the Respondent was forced to cover the excess.

21 of 26

Also, within the concept of abuse of a right, there is legal fraud, and procedural
fraud. The former “implies the intention to circumvent the effectiveness of a procedural
rule in a litigation” and the latter involves “violating the legal system through the
proceeding” (Jaime Jovano Burgos, op.cit., p. 179.) None of the aforementioned cases
relates to what happened to the Plaintiffs, particularly since there was no seizure of

goods.

Another element, so as not to share a criterion that my colleagues have
endorsed, is that in the lawsuit, the Plaintiffs stated that owing to the opposition
proceeding, they stopped selling the RIVERSTONE Y DISENO product. However,
the decision states that the damages were caused by a decrease in sales.
Therefore, the Plaintiffs never stopped selling the product. (See Fact 6, Lawsuit,

and page 15 of the Decision.)

Witness statements, ignored by the Upper Court, were not compared with the
documentation on file provided by the Plaintiff itself, which reveals that the lower
quality marks that were allegedly introduced by the Plaintiffs to improve the business
were already being sold, together with RIVERSTONE, before the opposing lawsuit (see
invoice dated 3/12/2003, page 456, invoice dated 20/7/2004, page 520 et seq. up to

page 595.)

The detailed invoices prove that the Plaintiffs bought brands such as JINYU,
DOUBLE STAR (invoice on p. 520) that supposedly were of lower quality than
RIVERSTONE, to balance their business. This is not true, given that they were always
sold, and partially undermines the statement by witness ORESTES MEDINA,

mentioned in the project. In short, the dates on invoices at pp. 456-495 were not

22 of 26

compared with the models of tires allegedly introduced, (as DOUBLE START,

JINYU, JAPPINES, CHAOYAN).

Likewise, lower sales were due to contingency plans implemented due to fears of

a seizure that never happened, and not the opposition proceeding.
Witness JOSE ORESTES MEDINA, cited in the Decision, noted:

"QUESTION 3. What was the cause of the contingency
plan?

ANSWER (Witness): Actually, there was a fear that
BRIGSTONE CORPORATION would order a seizure of
RIVERSTONE tires, or prevent the sale of said tires. It was
a very delicate situation, having inventory in the warehouse,
goods in transit, and goods being manufactured with the
RIVERSTONE brand that we may not be able to sell owing
to a Decision against us” (fs. 563.)

This witness, together with Esteban Romero and Fernan Jesus Gonzalez, are in
agreement when stating that a sales decrease was due to the company's decision in
the face of a fictional situation. There never was an interim injunction, only a
proceeding. Sentencing the Respondents to pay for damages because of the

other party’s commercial fears is inappropriate.

According to the experts, a decrease in sales was caused by the Plaintiffs
business decisions. Use of the brand never ceased, contrary to the Plaintiffs’ claim.

(Volume I.)

According to the witnesses, the Plaintiffs feared that the goods would be seized.
This means that the decrease in sales was caused by the Plaintiffs unilateral decision.
(Witness Statement by Domingo Esteban Romero, pp. 565-569, and Fernan Jesus

Luque Gonzalez, pp. 608-616.)

23 of 26

Consequently, the following paragraph was drafted without a proper logical flow

of supporting arguments:

“As a fundamental claim in this ordinary proceeding, compensation
is requested from Respondents BRIDGESTONE LICENSING
SERVICES, INC. and BRIGESTONE CORPORATION, in favor of
the Plaintiffs, to cover for damages and losses caused by a
decrease in sales, specifically in view of the fact that the Plaintiff
was subject to a proceeding to oppose the registration of the
RIVERSTONE tire brand, a product that was their sales mainstay.
In addition, and according to the Appellants, such opposition
proceeding was based on reckless, intimidating conduct.”

Continuing with our analysis of logical flow, we find the following contradiction:
“Now, despite the fact that the commercial impact ‘involved removing
RIVERSTONE tires from the market, which caused damages..." (p. 19 of the
project.) The decision and the proceeding showed that sales of the product never
ceased, the product was never withdrawn from the market; there was only a decrease

in sales caused by the Plaintiffs’ own inference.

On the other hand, the adopted project does not analyze the meaning of reckless
behavior. Is reckless behavior informing a businessman that a request opposing a
brand registration will be filed? The Chamber replies that this is a special case,
because there was strong evidence that the Appellants were able to sell the product.
This response is no justification because in order to reach the subject of evidence
evaluation, there had to be a court and a proceeding, where a judge ruled against the

Respondents.

The undersigned reiterates that the authenticity of a letter stating an alleged

recklessness was not screened by the Chamber. Likewise, no reason was given about

24 of 26

what to do with a final decision, by the specialized court, ruling that the party’s
conduct was not reckless. The evidence that gave rise to the event was not
evaluated. The content was revealed, but no reasoning followed about an impact on

the proceeding, much less in contrast with other evidence.
For better understanding, | transcribe the following excerpt:

“BRIDGESTONE CORPORATION and BRIDGESTONE
LICENSING SERVICE, INC. shall be exempted from paying costs,
given that this court considers that they acted in evident good faith,
maintaining their position, and providing appropriate evidence to
prove their legal standing - all without abusing the exercise of
their management right. Thus, they shall only be compelled to
cover the costs of the proceedings.” (Emphasis added.)

To qualify the withdrawal of an appeal as reckless is incorrect. It is not reckless
conduct, rather, there is no abuse of litigation. The Respondents understood that they
could not go further in the proceeding. The proceeding did not reach the end, the
last consequences, as argued by the project. Punishing a party for a procedural

decisions such as this, qualifying it as recklessness and abuse of a right, is
inappropriate.
Finally, | do not agree with the reasons behind the monetary sanction in this

proceeding. No analysis was offered, based on arguments, and scarce legal grounds,

as to how the Five million Balboas figure was reached.

Citing an ignored expert opinion, without even a glimpse of an interpretative effort
by the Court, and without comparing it to the rest of the documents, is failure to comply
with the duty to motivate a decision, especially when there is an issue about MURESA’s

damages (that | do not agree with,) and an ignored expert report, calculated at

25 of 26

B/.3,351,731.15 (p. 2638.) The Court expert argued that there were no supporting
documents, specific studies, or financial projections (essential items to evaluate
damages to sales forecasts), and that there were only projected sales on photocopies,

minutes and reports, (attached) (p. 1650.)
The Court's expert regarding the assessment of damages stated as follows:

“We have no documents showing that they had to stop sales; projections
were not based on any study; and TIRE GROUP OF FACTORIES LTD,
INC, did not stop selling RIVERSTONE brand tires."

The foregoing are, in the main, the reasons that lead me to issue a DISSENTING

OPINION.

following points.

BACKGROUND

Through legal counsel, the Corporations MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A. and TIRE

GROUP OF FACTORIES LTD.,

Page 1 of 31

2
INC., initiated Ordinary Action of Greater Amount against BRIDGESTONE CORPORATION and
BRIDGESTONE LICENSING SERVICES INC., so that the same be condemned jointly and
severally to pay the amount of FIVE MILLION DOLLARS (US$5,000,000.00) on account of

money damages. The ordinary complaint was based on the following claims:

1. That the defendants, BRIDGESTONE CORPORATION and
BRIDGESTONE LICENSING SERVICES INC. be sentenced to pay to
our clients, MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A. and TIRE GROUP OF
FACTORIES LTD., INC. the amount of Five Million Dollars
(US$5,000,000.00), legal currency of the United States of America, on
account of indemnification for extra-contractual liability.

2. That the defendants, BRIDGESTONE CORPORATION and
BRIDGESTONE LICENSING SERVICES INC. be condemned to pay
attorney's fees and expenses originated during this process.

The facts on which the Action filed by MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A. and TIRE GROUP
FACTORIES LTD., INC., were based were the following:

“FIRST: On April 5, 2005, the defendants, BRIDGESTONE
CORPORATION and BRIDGESTONE LICENSING SERVICES INC.,
filed an opposition complaint against the application for registration
No. 120823-01 for the RIVERSTONE and DESIGN trademark filed by
MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A

SECOND: The plaintiff, MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A., entered into a
fepresentation and distribution agreement with TIRE GROUP OF
FACTORIES LTD., INC. on the 27" day of December 2001, for
different countries of Europe, Asia, Africa and any other country of the
area (sic), for the registration and marketing of the Products

Page 2 of 31

3

of the RIVERSTONE AND DESIGN trademark (tires or wheels)

THIRD: The plaintiff, MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A. entered into a representation and
distribution agreement with LV INTERNATIONAL INC. on the 27" day of December 2001, for
different countries of America, among them the United States of America, Mexican United
States, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Belize, Costa Rica, Canada, Nicaragua, Venezuela,
Ecuador, Uruguay, Paraguay, Haiti, Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, Dominican Republic and Colombia
for the registration and marketing of the Products under the trademark RIVERSTONE AND
DESIGN (tires or wheels).

FOURTH: That MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A. is the sole owner of the RIVERSTONE AND
DESIGN trademark, as established by Law 35 of May 10, 1996, approved in our country by Law
41 of July 13, 1995, the Paris Convention and the TRIPS agreement, approved by Law 23 of
July 15, 1997.

FIFTH: That MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A. authorized LV INTERNATIONAL INC. and TIRE
GROUP OF FACTORIES LTD., INC. to register the RIVERSTONE AND DESIGN trademark, on
an international level, being those products (tires) commercialized (sold) in America, Europe,
Asia and Africa.

SIXTH: That the complaint filed by the defendants, BRIDGESTONE CORPORATION and
BRIDGESTON LICENSING SERVICES INC., caused money damages to our clients since the
commercialization (sale) of the product under the RIVERSTONE AND DESIGN trademark
ceased, as a result of the of the complaint.

This Action was filed at the Eleventh Circuit Court of the First Judicial Circuit of Panama, Civil

Branch, which by means of Resolution No. 1293-07 admitted the respective Complaint,

Page 3 of 31

4

notified the defendants, who denied the facts and the amounts claimed. After complying with the
appropriate procedural stages, the first instance court resolved this Action through Judgment

No. 70 of December 17, 2010, which in its decisive part stated the following:

"The undersigned, ELEVENTH CIRCUIT CIVIL JUDGE OF THE FIRST JUDICIAL CIRCUIT OF
PANANA, administering justice on behalf of the Republic and by authority of law, within the
Ordinary Action for Civil liability proposed by MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A. and TIRE GROUP
OF FACTORIES LTD., INC., against BRIDGESTONE CORPORATION and BRIDGESTONE
LICENSING SERVICES, INC., RESOLVES the following:

FIRST: Declares proved the Exception of Illegitimacy in the Case of the Corporation TIRE
GROUP OF FACTORIES LTD. S. A., alleged by the defendants BRIDGESTONE
CORPORATION and BRIDGESTONE LICENSING SERVICES, INC.

SECOND: DENIES THE CLAIM requested by the corporation MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A.

within this Action.

Orders the plaintiff to pay the attorney's fees which are valued in the amount of THREE
HUNDRED SEVENTY ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS WITH 00/100
($371,700.00)."

In the exercise of its procedural rights, the Plaintiff timely brought an Appeal against the
Judgment of first instance, being known such Appeal by the First Superior Court of the First
Judicial District of Panama, who resolved the appeal through Resolution of May 23, 2013, by

stating in the decisive part of such judgment the following:

“For the stated above, the FIRST SUPERIOR COURT, administering justice on behalf of

Page 4 of 31

5
the Republic and by authority of the Law, MODIFIES the Judgment No. 70 of December 17,

2010, delivered by the Eleventh Circuit Court of the First Judicial Circuit of Panama, Civil
Branch, to declare NOT PROVED the Exception of Illegitimacy in the Action of the corporation
TIRE GROUP OF FACTORIES LTD., S. A., alleged by the defendants.

IT IS AFFIRMED for everything else."

The Appellant has brought this Appeal against this resolution of second instance, which this

Civil Chamber proceeds to resolve.

APPEAL
The present Appeal is on the merits and a ground of violation of Substantive Rules of Law is
invoked, which corresponds to an error of fact regarding the existence of evidence.

This invoked ground is based on six MOTIVES which are stated as follows:

"FIRST: The First Superior Court of the First Judicial District of Panama, when delivering the
judgment ignored completely the document in the English language and duly translated into
Spanish through an authorized public translator and which can be read from page 2622 to page
2828 and from page 2955 to page 2958 of the file, in which the attorneys of Transnational BFS
Brands, LLC, threaten and warn L.V. INTERNATIONAL, INC, Riverstone trademark,
representative of MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A., to refrain from any registration and use of the
Riverstone trademark, both within the United States of America and any other country; and if
L.V. INTERNATIONAL, INC. used the mark, it was under its own risk. By not considering this
important evidence of the Action, the First Superior Court of the First Judicial District of

Panama, made an error of fact in connection with the

Page 5 of 31

6

existence of evidence, which substantially influenced the decision contested, since such

evidence shows the bad faith and recklessness of the defendants.

SECOND: The First Superior Court of the First Judicial District of Panama also did not consider,
when ignoring completely the certifications issued and subscribed by the Authorized Public
Accountant MIRMA R. MOREIRA, with CPA number 307-2005, with her signature
acknowledged before a Public Notary, accountant of the company MURESA INTERTRADE,
S.A., and TIRE GROUP OF FACTORIES LTD., INC. stopped selling worldwide the amount of
five millions one hundred sixty eight thousand two hundred seventy dollars with fifty six cents
(USDS$5, 168,270.56), making the error of fact in connection with the existence of evidence
which substantially influenced the contested decision, since if it had not ignored this important
evidence of the Action, it had acknowledged that the defendant caused our clients severe

economic damages with its behavior.

THIRD: The First Superior Court of the First Judicial District of Panama did not evaluate, but
ignored completely, the content of the resolution of September 8, 2006 of the Third Superior
Court of the First Judicial District of Panama available from page 37 to page 38 of the file, in
which it appears the willful and bad faith act or behavior from the defendant, who after opposing
the registration of the Riverstone trademark of our clients and announcing appeal against the
decision that denied the opposition, desisted from such recourse. By not considering this
documentary evidence which is a document, the ad quem (court of appeals) made an error of
fact in connection with the existence of evidence, substantially influencing the contested
decision and if it had considered it, it had proved the damages caused by the defendant to our

clients.

FOURTH: The First Superior Court of the First Judicial District of Panama ignored the

testimonial evidences of JOSE ORESTES MEDINA SAMANIEGO, available from page 553 to
page 564; DOMINGO ESTEBAN ROMERO CEVALLOS, page 565 to page 589; GRICELDA

Page 6 of 31

7
PINEDA CASTILLO, available from page 575 to 585; AMINTA JULISA VEGA BARRERA,
available from page 586 to page 594; AIXA YADIRA RAMIREZ GONZALEZ , from page 622 to
page 628, MIRNA RAQUEL MOREIRA MARTINEZ available from page 634 to page 643,
LAURA ESTHER MURGAS DE BRACHO, from page 647 to page 655 of the file, all employees
of our clients, who know the sales flow of tires and who agree in time and place, that our clients
could not sell their Riverstone tires because of the opposition against the application for
registration of the trademark and the threats of the Transnational BRIDGESTONE, so that the
ad quem made an error of fact in connection with the existence of evidence, which substantially

influenced the decision as it did not deem proven the damages caused by the defendants.

FIFTH: Neither did the First Superior Court of the First Judicial District of Panama consider the
testimonial statement made by FERNAN JESUS LUQUE GONZALEZ, see from page 603 to
page 616 and JORGE ALBERTO LUQUE GONZALEZ, available from page 657 to 661 of the
file, who mentioned in their testimonies that they knew there was a threat made through a letter
from BFS BRANDS, LLC (BRIDGESTONE) in the United States of America and the seizure and
challenge action against the RIVERSTONE trademark in the Dominican Republic, China and
other countries, which led our clients to be afraid of actions against them and which prevented
the sales of the RIVERSTONE brand tires, during the opposition against the registration hereof,
thus the ad quem made an error of fact in connection with the existence of the evidence which
influenced the contested decision, because by ignoring such evidence the court did not deem

proven the willful and bad faith acts of the defendants and the damages.

SIXTH: Neither did the First Superior Court of the First Judicial District of Panama consider in its
judgment the accounting expert report rendered by the experts PSIQUIES DE LEON and JOSE
ANTONIO AQUILAR, available from page 2635 to page 2642 of the file and the testimony of

such experts upon examination, which are read from page

Page 7 of 31

8
3639 to page 3663, who concluded that our clients had a marked reduction of sales during the
period 2005-2008 for damages caused by BRIDGESTONE valued in five millions one hundred
sixty eight thousand two hundred seventy dollars with fifty six cents (USD$5, 168,270.56)
because of the opposition against the registration of the RIVERSTONE trademark and the
defendants’ threats, thereby making the ad quem an error of fact in connection with the
existence of evidence which influenced the contested decision, because by ignoring such
evidence it did not deem proven the willful and bad faith acts of the defendants and the

damages.

As rules of law considered infringed, articles 780 and 217 of the Judicial Code are cited, as well

as article 1644 of the Code and article 1 of the Law No. 57 of 1978.

CHAMBER’S CRITERION

As it was indicated above, the Appeal is on the merits and a ground of violation of substantive

tules of law is invoked by error of fact regarding the existence of evidence.

The invoked evidentiary ground occurs when evidence that has been submitted during the
Action has not been appreciated by the Ad quem within the Resolution, and it is binding that its

appreciation had influenced the challenged decision.

Thus, a thorough review of the contested decision proves that the evidences to which the six
Motives upon which the invoked evidentiary error is based, were not appreciated within such
Resolution. That is so because the Ad quem only indicated that from the review of the evidence

within the Action, the claim

Page 8 of 31

9
of the defendants is not clear, without a thorough analysis thereof and without identifying the

evidentiary elements specifically, referring to the evidence in a general and global manner.

The foregoing shows to this Chamber that the illegality charges stated in the Motives do exist,
by showing that the evidences listed have not been appreciated by the Superior Court within the
challenged Resolution, therefore this Chamber must determine now if from the analysis and
appropriate evidentiary appreciation of such evidences, the defendants’ claim is shown, thereby

influencing the contested decision.

In this regard, for this Chamber the claim of this Ordinary Action commenced by the plaintiffs, is
to obtain from the defendants a compensation for damages caused by virtue of an Action that
with reckless intentions, the Corporations BRIDGESTONE LICENSING SERVICES INC. and
BRIDGESTONE CORPORATION brought against MURESA INTERTRADE, S. A., where the
Corporations TIRE GROUP OF FACTORIES LTD. INC. and L.V. INTERNATIONAL INC.,
served as third party interveners, which caused them damages in connection with the marketing

and sale of the product, which consists of tires identified with the RIVERSTONE trademark.

Thus, it stems from the first Motive in which this Appeal is based that the Appellants pointed out
the documentary evidences from pages 2622 and 2628 and from 2955 to 2958, in both groups
of pages the same documentary evidence is shown, which represents a translation into the

Spanish language from a correspondence issued by the

Page 9 of 31

10
the defendants’ counsel to the plaintiffs’ attorneys. The content of such note reads as follows:
“Dear Mr. Sanchelima:
As you know, the Board of Disputes and Appeals of Trademarks has delivered judgment against
your client, supporting our opposition and denying the application filed by your client regarding
the registration for tires of the RIVERSTONE trademark.
Please note that Bridgestone/Firestone object any registration of the RIVERSTONE
trademark not only for its use for tires but also for any use that may be given to this
trademark. Although we are not aware of the use of the RIVERSTONE trademark tires in the
United States, Bridgestone/Firestone hereby submit to your client our formal demand that
your client refrains from using the RIVERSTONE trademark in the United States either at
the date hereof or at any time thereafter.
Regarding the use of the RIVERSTONE trademark in other countries, please also note the
position of Bridgestone/Firestone in such a way that our formal demand directed to L.V.
International Inc. asking them to refrain from using the RIVERSTONE trademark is not limited
only to the United States. Before performing an analysis country by country and without any
intention to make any demands at this time, concerning the use of the RIVERSTONE trademark
in any other particular country, both you and your client must be aware that
Bridgestone/Firestone object and in no any way approve the use or registration of the
RIVERSTONE trademark for tires anywhere in the world. Therefore, L. V. International Inc. is

acting at its own risk if it decides to use the RIVERSTONE trademark in other countries.

Sincerely
Peter G. Mack

Within the third Motive, the omission in the appreciation of the copy of a legal Resolution (fs. 37
to 39) delivered by the Third Superior Court of Justice of the First Judicial District of Panama, in
which it is resolved to admit the withdrawal filed by the law firm BENEDETTI & BENEDETTI,
counselors for the opposing party, within the "Opposition Action against the application for
registration No. 120823-01 for the RIVERSTONE AND DESIGN trademark, in Class 12, brought
by the Corporations BRIDGESTONE CORPORATION and BRIDGESTONE LICENSING
SERVICE, S. A., against the company MURESA INTERTRADE, S. A., which has as third party
interveners the corporations L. V. INTERNATIONAL INC. and TIRE GROUP OF FACTORIES
LTD., INC. is reported”.

It stems from the appreciation of the aforementioned Resolution, as the Appellants mention in
the third Motive upon which the evidentiary ground of error of fact is based in connection with
the existence of evidence, the Opposition Action against the registration of trademark was in the
Third Superior Court of Justice of the First Judicial District of Panama by virtue of the Appeal
brought by the firm BENEDETT! & BENEDETTI, in its capacity of counselor for the Corporations
BRIDGESTONE CORPORATION and BRIDGESTONE LICENSING SERVICES’, INC., being

in this procedural stage where the withdrawal of the appeal was filed.

Regarding the fourth Motive, what is reported is the omission in the appreciation of certain
testimonial evidences, being the first of these reported the one that corresponds to the witness
JOSE ORESTES MEDINA SAMANIEGO (fs.553 to 564), who identified himself as employee of
the

Page 11 of 31

12
plaintiff MURESA INTERTRADE, S. A. and from whose testimony the following stems from:
"QUESTION #3: May the witness state if he is aware that against the registration of the
RIVERSTONE trademark any type of opposition to its registration was filed in Panama and in
other countries?
ANSWER: In 2005, when I recently joined MURESA INTERTRADE as Sales Manager of the
company, | was notified that there was an objection against the registration of the
RIVERSTONE trademark, such objection proposed by BRIDGESTONE CORPORATION,
that such Action was being tried in Panamanian courts. At that time, there was a
conversation with the law firm to check if there was opposition in any other country.
Based on that, it was determined that the proceedings of registration were being stopped
in China and United States.
"QUESTION #4: May the witness state, since he has declared to be the Sales Manager of
MURESA INTERTRADE, S. A., where were distributed or in which countries were distributed
the tires identified with the RIVERSTONE trademark before the opposition to its registration in
the Republic of Panama?
ANSWER: RIVERSTONE TIRE was already an established trademark in countries such as

Colombia, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, | , Domini P

 

Haiti, and very well established in Cuba, Venezuela. As for Asia and Europe, it was sold a lot
in Singapore, Korea, Africa, Portugal and internally in China.

QUESTION #5 May the witness testify in his capacity of Manager of MURESA INTERTRADE,
S. A., and since he has declared in the preceding answer, that the RIVERSTONE trademark for
tires was very well established worldwide, if he knows, what happens after they knew about the
opposition to the registration of the trademark in Panama? Please explain.

ANSWER: When we learned about the opposition against the registration of the trademark, we
had to make contingency plans within the company to attempt to manage the same sales
volume or the sales volume of the company; because of this, we had to choose entering

with other trademarks to meet the needs of our customers; such trademarks as DOUBLE

Page 12 of 31

13
ESTART, JINYU, enter trademarks as JAPPINES, we entered with trademarks as
CHAOYAN. When entering with these trademarks which at that time did not have the
name or recognition in their market, that lead us to introduce them with lower prices at
the expense of the profit margin of the company, in addition the refusal of many customers
for being a product they did not know, because of which they canceled the orders for being
afraid they were low quality products. MURESA INTERTRADE assumes the responsibility of
granting the guarantee given for RIVERSTONE to these other trademarks, taking the risk of
selling a product the quality of which was unknown." (the underlined part belongs to the

Chamber)

Likewise, it is reported within the Fourth Motive the testimonial statements of DOMINGO
ESTEBAN ROMERO CEVALLOS (fs. 565 -569), GRICELDA PINEDA CASTILLO (fs. 575 -585),
AMINTA JULISA VEGA DE BARRERA (fs. 586 -594), AIXA YADIRA RAMIREZ GONZALEZ (fs.
622 -628), MIRNA RAQUEL MOREIRA MARTINEZ (fs. 634 -643 9 and LAURA ESTHER
MURGAS DE BRACO (fs. 647 -655), this Chamber having been able to verify that from all the
aforesaid testimonies it is coincidentally shown the fact that, because of the opposition Action to
the registration of the RIVERSTONE trademark brought against the Corporation MURESA
INTERTRADE, S. A. by BRIDGESTONE LICENSING SERVICES, INC. and BRIDGESTONE
CORPORATION, a commercial damage was caused to the plaintiffs - appellants, since they
had to improvise with other trademarks, including low quality trademarks, to meet the sales

demand of the market.

It is seen from what is stated in the sixth Motive, that the appreciation of the expert report of

pages 2635 to 2642 of the

Page 13 of 31

14
file, shows regarding the plaintiff MURESA INTERTRADE, S. A., the following:
"Question 7: Which were the damages caused to the company MURESA INTERTRADE, S. A.?
because of the impossibility to sell its products, the RIVERSTONE tires, and what was the
result?
ANSWER 7; The sales of the RIVERSTONE tires made by the company MURESA
INTERTRADE, S. A., during 2004 increased by 32% in relation to the sales of 2003 and in 2005
increased by 18% in relation to 2004, in spite of the fact that 2005 was the year in which it was
the Opposition complaint against application for registration 120823-01 of the RIVERSTONE
AND DESIGN trademark was brought by BRIDGESTONE CORP. AND BRIDGESTONE
LICENSING SERVICES, INC., filed on April 5, 2005.
In 2006, 2007 and 2008 the sales decreased in relation to 2005 in the following way:

SALES DECREASE
(In Dollars) (In Dollars)

2005 5,364, 132.54

2006 3,971,353.40 1,392,779.14
2007 4,717,299.89 646,832.65
2008 4,563,294.20 800,838.34
Decrease 3 years 2,840,450.13
Plus an increase of 18% 511,281.02
Total Decrease 3,351,731.15

Question 8: Which were the sales scheduled by the corporation MURESA INTERTRADE, S. A.,
for 2007 and 2008?

Answer 8: The sales scheduled by the corporation MURESA INTERTRADE, S. A. for 2007 and
2008 under the minutes of the board of directors credited in the Action were the following:

2007 US$23,000,000.00

2008 US$23,000,000.00

According to the documents submitted by the company, the sales of the RIVERSTONE tires

represented 35% of the scheduled sales.

Question 9: Which were the sales made during 2007 and 2008 by the company MURESA
INTERTRADE, S. A.,?

Page 14 of 31

Answer 9: The sales made during 2007 and 2008 by the company MURESA INTERTRADE, S.

A., were the following:

TOTAL SALES SALES OF RIVERSTONE TIRES %
(In Dollars) (In Dollars)

2007 17,186,091.25 4,717,299.89 32
2008 20,197,735.61 4,563,294.20 23

Question 10: What was the reason for not accomplishing the sales scheduled by the company
MURESA INTERTRADE, S. A., for 2007 and 2008?

Answer 10: The sales scheduled by the company MURESA INTERTRADE, S. A. were not
accomplished because the RIVERSTONE trademark, main product sold by the company
MURESA INTERTRADE, S. A., was subject to an Opposition complaint against the application
for registration 120823-01 for the RIVERSTONE AND DESIGN trademark brought by
BRIGESTONE CORP. AND BRIGESTONE LICENSING SERVICES INC.., filed on April 5, 2005.
And even though the sales of RIVERSTONE tires have been increasing during 2007 and 2008,

they have not been able to recover the increase levels they had before the complaint."

It can also be proved from such accounting expert report, the sales decrease of the other
plaintiff, the Corporation TIRE GROUP OF FACTORIES LTD., INC., indicating the report that by
2005 the sales of the RIVERSTONE tires represented 56% of the total sales, it decreased to
33% in 2006, in 2007 to 35% and in 2008 to 25%, specifying that the cause of this decrease

was the Opposition Complaint against the respective registration of trademark.

This Chamber observes in connection with the previous detailed evidences and upon which the
invoked ground has been based, that the same were duly incorporated to the Action within the
appropriate term and it does not appear within the Action that they have been objected

regarding

Page 15 of 31

16

its authenticity and veracity, therefore, the appreciation of its jointly content is appropriate.

Now, from the facts upon which the Ordinary Complaint is based, brought by the Corporations
MURESA INTERTRADE, S. A. and TIRE GROUP OF FACTORIES LTD., INC.., it is evident for
this Court that the Corporation MURESA INTERTRADE, S. A. has a distribution, representation
and distribution agreement with the Corporation TIRE GROUP OF FACTORIES LTD., INC.,
since 2001 and, in turn, since that year, the latter Corporation entered into a representation and
distribution agreement with the Corporation LV INTERNATIONAL INC., for all matters related to
the RIVERSTONE tires, which was duly credited and it was not objected throughout the Action.

As the main claim of this Ordinary Action, a compensation from the defendants BRIDGESTONE
LICENSING SERVICES, INC. and BRIGESTONE CORPORATION, in favor of the plaintiffs is
requested to cover for damages caused by virtue of the decrease in the commercial sales they
experienced, specifically because of the situation of the plaintiff MURESA INTERTRADE, S. A.,
being subjected to an Opposition Action against the Registration of the RIVERSTONE
trademark for tires, product that represented its most important good in terms of commercial
sales and besides, as the Appellants said, such Opposition Action was supported by reckless

and intimidating attitudes.

The Appellants point out that after the evidentiary appreciation reported in the Motives upon

which the invoked ground of error of fact in connection with the existence of evidence is based,

which has been fully verified by this Chamber, by previously indicating that the

Page 16 of 31

17

evidences in question did not deserve a valuation statement from the Ad quem within the
contested decision, the damages caused to the plaintiffs are shown, committing not only the
infringement of Article 780 of the Judicial Code, but also violating the provisions of Article 1644

of the Civil Code, in accordance with Article 217 of the Judicial Code.

The content of the provisions cited as violated is as follows:

Article 1644, (Civil Code) Whoever by act or omission causes damage to another by fault or
negligence is bound to repair the damage.
If the act or omission is attributable to two or more persons, each shall be jointly and severally

liable for the damages caused.

Article 217. (Judicial Code) The parties shall answer for damages caused to the other party or
third parties by their reckless or bad faith procedural actions. When there is evidence of such
behavior in the procedure, the judge shall impose the appropriate award in the judgment or in
the order that decides the procedure and if it is not possible to determine an amount thereof, it
shall be settled in the manner provided in Article 996, if the Action has been completed, such

proceeding shall be advanced independently."

From the previously transcribed rules, the Appellant indicates that its harm caused by the
Defendants is proven in terms of the damages they caused to the plaintiffs as a result of the
Opposition Action against the Registration of the RIVERSTONE trademark for tires, in which
they had since 2001, the right of its representation and distribution, judicial action that the

plaintiffs say occurred in a reckless and intimidating manner with the aim of causing damage.

Page 17 of 31

Regarding the fact the legal initiative exercised by the Defendants BRIDGESTIONE
LICENSING SERVICES, INC. and BRIDGESTONE CORPORATION caused damage to the
plaintiffs MURESA INTERTRADE, S. A. and THE GROUP OF FACTORIES LTD, INC., it is for
this Court a fully proven element from the mass of evidence submitted within the Action and
upon which the invoked evidentiary ground of error of fact in connection with the existence of
evidence is based; evidence materials this Chamber specified in detail when verifying the

respective Motives.

The evidence materials, such as the accounting expert report prove what the RIVERSTONE
trademark for tires represented to the plaintiffs corporations, not only in terms of their
representation and commercial distribution, but also as a sale product by being a trademark
commercially established and recognized by its durability and marketability, situations that had
made this product the one that generated most of the sales, therefore, greater profits, being
consistent with the fact that, when this product was excluded as a sales product, it created a

significant financial impact in respect of the incomes of such corporations.

This situation is also proved by the testimonial evidences given by the employees of the
plaintiffs, who concretely and coincidently reflect the sales crisis that occurred in the accounting
of the incomes of the plaintiffs” profits and despite of the use of contingency commercial plans,

the commercial sales could not be leveled

Page 18 of 31

and the placement in the market of the RIVERSTONE tires, resulting from the fact that such

commercial trademark was subject to a dispute.

However, despite the commercial impact that was caused due to taking out from the market the
sales of the RIVERSTONE tires, which created damages in terms of the annual sales of the
plaintiffs corporations, situation that this Chamber considers perfectly demonstrated, the Ad
quem considered not to grant the claim of this Ordinary Action, since it deemed that the
condition of proving the extra-contractual liability contemplated in Article 1644 of the Civil Code,
because it considered not proven the fault or negligence that such rule refers to as a necessary

requirement for the legal responsibility claimed to be formed.

While this Chamber shares the doctrinal analysis presented in the contested decision by the Ad
quem concerning how and when extra-contractual civil liability occurs, this Chamber does not
share the appreciation made by such Court when saying that from the evidence submitted
within the Action, the negligence elements on the defendants BRIDGESTONE LICENSING
SERVICES, INC. and BRIDGESTONE CORPORATION to which the cited article 1644 refers to

are not proven.

This is so, as the Appellants have stated in this Appeal, when observing the note that appears
on pages 2622 to 2628 and on pages 2955 to 2958, in which the legal counsel of the plaintiffs,
in an intimidating manner indicated to have brought in several countries Opposition Actions

against the registration of the RIVERSTONE trademark for tires and adding without

Page 19 of 31

20
legal basis, at least within Panamanian law, that the plaintiffs should refrain from commercially

selling that product, it represents an obviously intimidating and reckless behavior.

According to the documentary evidence indicated in the preceding paragraph, it does not go
unnoticed for this Chamber the procedural behavior of the plaintiffs in this Trademark Action,
creating confusion in considering the existence of good faith, when the Corporations
BRIDGESTONE LICENSING SERVICES, INC. and BRIDGESTONE CORPORATION take
until the last procedural consequences the initiative to oppose the registration of a trademark of
a product that conveniently was commercially competitive to them and after an important time in
dispute elapsed, withdraw a remedy such as the Appeal brought on a Decision adverse to their

interests.

The Chamber finds appropriate to cite the Panamanian lawyer Jorge Fabrega Ponce, who in his
work "Dictionary of Civil Procedure Law", refers to reckless procedural behaviors and that cause

damage to the parties, as follows:

"RECKLESSNESS AND PROCEDURAL MALICE. The reckless procedural act is the
behavior of one who knows or should know that he does not have grounds to litigate,
notwithstanding, he does, abusing of the jurisdiction. It implies devious behavior, unfair
maneuver, articulating in bad faith and without any factual or legal support. The
procedural malice is the use of procedural powers with the deliberate intent to obstruct the
proper development and decision of the Action. The procedural recklessness takes place
with the knowledge that the litigant had or should have had about the lack of legitimate

grounds to bring or maintain a claim. The procedural malice occurs

Page 20 of 31

21
in the obstructionist and dilatory purposes in the respective articulations .... "(The underlined
part belongs to the Chamber) (Jorge Fabrega Ponce, Dictionary of Civil Procedural Law", first

edition, Plaza & Janes Editores Colombia, S.A., Colombia, 2004, p. 1242)

It should be noted at this point that this Chamber does not intend, under any circumstances, to
indicate that the fact of exercising a judicial initiative for claiming any right could be interpreted
as synonym of the damages that may cause thereof to the plaintiffs, resulting this in an element
of coercion to whom is considered entitled to a claim and to use the resources that the law
provides it to do so. However, as to the specific situation of this case, in which there were strong
evidences that showed that the appellants plaintiffs had with legal basis the right to market a
product that also constituted an item of great importance for their own profits in connection with
the commercial activity they are engaged in and conveniently an element of commercial
competitiveness for the opposing parties, it may represent a key situation for one who intends to
commercially decrease that condition of market possession, without strong legal support and
with the intent to cause damages because of the commercial competitiveness that this

represents.

And it is precisely this situation the one that this Chamber considers that stems from the
defendants’ behavior, BRIDGESTONE LICENSING SERVICES INC. and BRIDGESTONE
CORPORATION, by not considering in good faith and, therefore, considering a negligent action

the fact of using the legal initiative to bring without legal basis against the current plaintiffs in this

Page 21 of 31

22

Ordinary process, when they filed against them an opposition to the registration of the
RIVERSTONE trademark for tires, therefore such action caused irreversible damages regarding

the key the commercial activity those corporations were engaged in.

Consequently, this Chamber not only finds that the charges of illegality presented in the Motives
upon which this appeal is based have been shown, when verifying that the evidentiary elements
were ignored by the Ad quem in the contested decision, but also, from their appreciation, the
facts upon which the claim of this Ordinary Action is based are proven, influencing the
provisions of the contested decision in Appeal, whereby it proceeds to repeal that decision.
Given that the charges of illegality presented in the Ground that corresponds to the concept of
error of fact regarding the existence of evidence have been shown, this Chamber shall order the

revocation of the contested decision.

On merits of the foregoing, THE SUPREME COURT, FIRST CIVIL CHAMBER, administering
justice on behalf of the Republic and by the authority of the Law, REPEALS the Decision of
May twenty three (23) of two thousand thirteen (2013), issued by the First Superior Court of
First Judicial District, and this Chamber converted into Court of Instance, REVOKES the
Judgment No. 70 of December 17, 2010, issued by the Eleventh Circuit Court of the First

DRAFTING JUSTICE: OYDEN ORTEGA DURAN
MURESA INTERTRADE, S.A. AND TIRE GROUP OF FACTORIES LTD., INC. RESORT TO

AN APPEAL WITHIN THE ORDINARY ACTION BEING FOLLOWED AGAINST
BRIDGESTONE CORPORATION AND BRIDGESTONE LICENSING SERVICES, INC.

DISSENTING OPINION FROM JUSTICE HARLEY J. MITCHELL D.

Despite submitting my comments, which were partially accepted by my peers, | must say that |

do not agree with the decision contained in the resolution that has been executed.

Although the Superior Court of the First Judicial District did not properly indicate the Motives
why to its criterion there was no damage, as the evidence was not individually contrasted with
the facts, the act considered to be damaging: the delivery of the "reckless letter" and the filing of

the opposition action are not reckless acts per se.

First, because the opposition action does not entail a suspension of the use of the mark and it
does not have the nature of a preliminary injunction. Regarding the letter, in addition to the
valuation issues of the document itself, its content does not constitute a threat, as it was up to
the company the letter was addressed to whether or not to use the mark, which, according to

that company, it was entitled to. It was not an imposition from the defendant.

In that sense, we should proceed with the analysis of the problem of the document consisting of
the "letter" in the executed ruling. The decision did not fairly review the letter’s origin, how it
was submitted to the case file, and whether it was recognized or not by the parties. Nothing
was said either concerning the time during which the letter was issued and sent, even though
during its issuance the trademark opposition action the defendants believed to be entitled to

bring was being heard.

Page 24 of 31

25
At page 2622 of the case file, appears the first copy of the letter; this document is a color copy
of a document bearing a notary public stamp that says that the signatures were verified and he
considers them to be authentic (the highlighted was made by the Justice). This document
comes from a third party and that fact was not indicated (taken into account) in the ruling. This
copy (document) does not meet the necessary requirements in order to be admitted as
evidence; the notary stamp is not sufficient to deem the document authentic, especially, when
documents of testimonial nature issued by third parties must be recognized by their signers.
The same analysis applies to the pages 2624-2628 and 2955-2958 of the file (where there are
other copies of the letter). This letter alone does not prove recklessness or bad faith on the

defendants’ part.

The ruling, as itis focused, creates a bad precedent for damages claims matters, given that the
defendants’ conduct was the filing of a trademark opposition action under the belief that they
had a better right against the plaintiffs. The filing of legal actions obviously creates discomforts
between the parties; however, that is not a synonym of damages. Reckless behavior must be
proven and the documents do not comply with the burden of proof that the plaintiffs must have

had met.

The abuse of the right to litigate alleged by the plaintiffs consists of the filing of the opposition
action (Factual Ground Sixth of the complaint), during the course of the proceedings the
existence of a threatening letter was introduced; however, according to the author Jaime Javier
Jované, the concept of the abuse of the right to litigate corresponds to "the disregard of the

limits imposed to the exercise of a right." ("Abuse of law", pg. 66).

This disregard must have the connotation of malice, the intent to harm, as it involves the

concept of bad faith and recklessness, acts that entail an intention against a third party. The

nature of the abuse of the rights to litigate is categorized as "an act of excessive behavior"

Page 25 of 31

26
where interests of other persons are harmed". (Op. cit., pg. 72) Scenario not reflected in this

case.

In this type of issues: abuse of the right to litigate, recklessness and the application of Article
217 of the Judicial Code, we must make teaching with these cases, as our law does not have a
specific list of what constitutes abuse of the right to litigate and recklessness, but it does provide
guidelines that describe behaviors of that nature. It is through case law that we should list the
behaviors that would reflect an abuse in the exercise of rights and use legal doctrine as our

support. The latter is not observed in the discernment shown by my fellow Justices.

As an example, according to the cited author, the filing of a second lawsuit in spite of the
existence of one pending, which generates lis pendens, or the filing of lawsuits where res
judicata operates are abusive conducts in the exercise of the right of access to justice. The
undersigned points out that even if a judicial conduct might be categorized as abusive, it must
be evaluated after the rulings that decide the respective case become final. The cited author
adds that petitions for the disqualification of judges without further explanation of the Motives

why is also a situation of abuse in the exercise of the right to litigate.

Likewise, the Judicial Code punishes acts of abusive exercise of the right to litigate, although it
does not entitle them as such. For example, Article 706 of our code of Civil Procedure imposes
fines on parties that have lost several motions within the same case. Article 1071 lists the
cases where there is no good faith, situations that go hand in hand with the abuse of the right to
litigate because the bad faith entails a behavior that reveals that the party was excessive in the
exercise of its rights, either as a plaintiff or defendant. Article 1075 punishes a party to pay
attorney's fees even after having proved its credit when its judicial actions were so

overwhelming that the defendant had to deal with that excess

Page 26 of 31

27
Also, within the concept of abuse of the right to litigate there are substantive frauds and
procedural frauds, where the first "implies an attempt to circumvent the effectiveness of a
procedural rule in litigation" and, the second involves "breaking the law by means of litigation"
(Jaime Jované Burgos, op. Cit., pg. 179). The legal action to which the plaintiffs were subjected
does not fall within any of the aforementioned situations, even more when there was never a

seizure of products.

Another element that leads the undersigned not to share my colleagues’ criterion is that in the
complaint the plaintiffs stated that as a result of the opposition action, the sales or
commercialization of the RIVERSTONE AND DESIGN products ceased; however, the ruling
establishes that the damages consisted of a decline in sales; therefore, the sales of the product
never stopped. (See Factual Ground Sixth of the complaint and page 15 of the ruling) (the

highlighted was made by the Justice).

The witnesses’ testimonies were not confronted with the documentary evidence on the file
submitted by the plaintiffs themselves, which reveals that brands of lower quality that were
allegedly introduced by the plaintiffs to straighten up the business, were already being
commercialized together with the RIVERSTONE tires before the opposition action (See invoice
dated 12/3/2003, pg. 456, invoice dated 7/20/2004, pg. 520 and following invoices up to page

595) (the highlighted was made by the Justice).

The referred to invoices prove that the plaintiffs bought brands like JINYU, DOUBLE STAR
(Invoice seen in page 520) that were supposedly of lesser quality than RIVERSTONE to
balance their business, which is not true, as they were always commercialized and that also
rebuts the testimony of the witness ORESTES MEDINA, which is cited in the ruling. In

summary, the dates of the invoices in pages 456 to 495 were not reviewed to verify the tire

Page 27 of 31

28
models allegedly introduced, such as DOUBLE START, JINYU, HAPPINES, CHAOYAN) (the

highlighted was made by the Justice).

Similarly, the decline in sales was the result of contingency plans made due to fears of a seizure

that never occurred and not because of the filing of an opposition action.

The witness, JOSE ORESTES MEDINA, quoted in the ruling testified:

“QUESTION 3: May the witness state what was the cause for adopting a contingency plan?
ANSWER: Actually, what was happening was a fear that BRIDGESTONE CORPORATION
could obtain an order directing the seizure or an injunction against the sales of RIVERSTONE
brand tires and it was very sensitive to have inventory in the warehouse, in transit goods and
goods in the factory with the RIVERSTONE brand that could not be sold as a result of a ruling

against us " (pg. 563)

In other words, this witness together with the witnesses Esteban Romero and Fernando Jesus
Gonzalez coincided in stating that the decline in sales was caused by a decision of the company
itself in view of a fictitious situation, inasmuch as preliminary injunctions/seizures were never
requested; there was only an opposition action. Ordering the defendants to pay a monetary
compensation due to commercial fears of the other party is inadequate. (the highlighted was

made by the Justice).

What was shown was a decrease in sales according to the experts, the cause of which was the

plaintiffs’ own commercial decisions, but the cessation of the use of the RIVERSTONE mark

alleged by the plaintiffs in the complaint never happened. (Volume |).

That was so because according to the witnesses, there was a fear of a seizure by the plaintiffs,

which shows that the sales decrease ended up being a unilateral decision of the plaintiffs

Page 28 of 31

29
themselves. (Testimony of Domingo Esteban Romero, pgs. 565 -569, and of Fernan Jesus

Luque Gonzalez, 608-616).

Consequently, the following paragraph was included without proper arguments that can support

it:

"As the main claim of this Ordinary Action, a compensation from the defendants
BRIDGESTONE LICENSING SERVICES, INC. and BRIGESTONE CORPORATION, in favor of
the plaintiffs is requested to cover for damages caused by virtue of the decrease in the
commercial sales they experienced, specifically because of the situation of the plaintiff
MURESA INTERTRADE, S. A., being subjected to an Opposition Action against the
Registration of the RIVERSTONE trademark for tires, product that represented its most
important good in terms of commercial sales and besides, as the Appellants said, such

Opposition Action was supported by reckless and intimidating attitudes.”

Continuing with the study of the discernment (of the two other Justices), we found the following
contradiction: " However, despite the commercial impact that was caused due to taking out
from the market the sales of the RIVERSTONE tires, which created damages ... " (pg.19 of the
ruling). In the decision and in the proceedings, it was shown that the product sales never
stopped and that it was never removed from the market, there was only a decrease in sales

because of the plaintiffs’ own inferences. (the highlighted was made by the Justice).

On the other hand, the adopted ruling does not analyze what a reckless conduct is. Telling a
businessman that a trademark opposition action will be initiated is a reckless conduct? The
Chamber replies that this is a special case because there was strong evidence that the
appellants could commercialize the product. This response is not well supported because to
have the opportunity to evaluate evidence, it was necessary to go to a court and bring an action

where a judge ruled that the defendants’ claim (in the opposition action) could not be granted

Page 29 of 31

30
The undersigned reiterates that the letter where the alleged recklessness emerges did not pass
through the Board’s analysis as to its authenticity. Also, what was done with respect to the
ruling of the specialized court that assessed the conduct of the parties as not reckless and
established that in the ruling, which became final, was not grounded. (the highlighted was made
by the Justice). The evidence that was the subject of one of the grounds of this appeal was not
assessed, only its content was reproduced, but its impact in the case was not analyzed, and

much less in contrast with the rest of the evidence.

For a better understanding, | transcribe the following extract:

“BRIDGESTONE CORPORATION and BRIDGESTONE LICENSING SERVICES, INC. shall be
exonerated from payment of attorney's fees, given that the this administration of justice office
deems that it acted in evident good faith; maintained and upheld its position in the proceedings,
submitted adequate evidence to show its standing and legitimacy in the case, all without
abusing of the right to litigate. Thus, they will only be compelled to cover the legal expenses of

the Action. " (The highlighted is ours).”

To categorize as reckless the withdrawal of an appeal is wrong because that is not a synonym
of bad faith conduct; to the contrary, there is no abuse of litigation. The defendants realized that
they could not go on with the action. The case was not challenged up to the last resort, as the
ruling states. Punishing parties for procedural or litigation decisions like this one is an

inappropriate position as to the determination of bad faith and abuse of rights.

Finally, | do not agree with the way the monetary award was motivated in this case. There was

no analysis as to how a judgment for five million dollars was feasible; that amount in damages

was awarded with little legal basis.

Page 30 of 31

31
We say so because citing the experts’ report without an interpretative effort from the Court and
without assessing it together with the rest of the evidence on the file does not comply with the
duty of motivating the court's decisions, especially, when there is a question that deals with
MURESA’s damages (damages with which the undersigned disagrees) and in the plaintiffs’
experts’ report the damages were calculated in $3,351,731.15 (page 2638); the court's
accountant expert testified that there was no supporting documentation, specific studies,
financial projections (an essential aspect to assess damages in connection with projected sales)
and that they only had copies of charts of projected sales, reports and minutes (prepared by the

plaintiffs) (Pg. 1650)

The court’s accountant expert as to the determination of damages stated as follows:

“We have no documents showing they had to suspend sales and the projections were not based
on studies, and TIRE GROUP OF FACTORIES LTD, INC. never stopped selling RIVERSTONE

brand tires.”

These are mostly all the assessments that lead me to express my DISSENTING OPINION.
