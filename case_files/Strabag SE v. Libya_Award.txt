Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 12 of 337

I. INTRODUCTION

lL. This case involves multiple claims under the bilateral investment treaty between the
Republic of Austria and the State of Libya (“Treaty” or “BIT”)! for losses allegedly
suffered by Claimant, Strabag SE (“Strabag”), a major international construction firm.
Claimant alleges multiple violations of the Treaty by Libya, primarily related to
construction work performed under several large road and infrastructure contracts prior to
the revolutionary violence that began in Libya in February 2011. Claimant also asserts
claims under the Treaty for property lost or damaged during the course of the revolutionary

violence in 2011 and subsequently.

2. In a nutshell, Respondent, Libya, denies the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to hear these claims
and denies all liability. Respondent further contends that, should the Tribunal find any
liability, any amounts found due to Claimant under its contract-based claims should be set
off against the unrecovered balances of advance payments made to Claimant at the outset
of contract performance, but that were not subsequently paid back during the course of

contract performance.

3. As will be seen below, the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction over Claimant’s claims
and that Claimant has established breaches of the Treaty with respect to some of its claims.
The Tribunal finds that other claims fail, inter alia, because Claimant has not established
that particular damage for which it sought compensation was caused by conduct for which

Respondent is responsible under the Treaty.

' The BIT was signed on 18 June 2002 and entered into force on | January 2004.

I. THE PARTIES

A. CLAIMANT

4, Claimant Strabag SE is a large international construction firm incorporated in Austria. It
operates utilizing a network of wholly owned entities that specialize in different aspects of
its construction business (such as procuring equipment, engineering, financial
management), as well as special purpose business vehicles created in some of the countries
in which Strabag carries on business. As described infra, following the relaxation of
international sanctions against Libya beginning around 2003, Strabag saw opportunities to

pursue large construction projects there.

5. Claimant’s wholly owned German subsidiary, Strabag International Ltd. (“Strabag
International”), initially secured contracts in its own name for two major road projects in
Libya. The first involved works on the coast road in the vicinity of Benghazi; the second
involved works on the coast road in the central part of the country in the vicinity of

Misurata.

6. In 2006, after Strabag established its presence and began work on the Benghazi and
Misurata road projects, Libya adopted a decision requiring that foreign firms engaged in
construction carry on business in conjunction with a Libyan partner.” Accordingly, Strabag
International entered into a joint venture? with the Libyan Investment and Development
Company (“LIDCO”).* LIDCO was a subsidiary of the “Libyan Social Development
Fund,” described by Claimant as “[t]the largest Libyan fund, under the direct control of the

Cabinet.”*

* LIDCO is owned by the Economic and Social Development Fund, which is in turn owned by the Libyan Investment
Authority, which Claimant describes as “an integral part of the Libyan State.” TR 1:14:12-13 (Mr. Claypool).

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 14 of 337

7. On 12 July 2007, Strabag International and LIDCO created a joint venture company, Al
Hani General Construction Co. (“Al Hani”).° Claimant indirectly owns 60% of Al Hani”
through its 100% ownership of ILBAU (a German company), which owns Strabag
International (also a German company).® The Benghazi and Misurata Contracts were
assigned by Strabag International to Al Hani in 2009, with the approval of the Roads and
Bridges Authority (*‘RBA”). All other contracts were concluded by Al Hani, after being

incorporated in 2007.

B. RESPONDENT

8. Claimant alleges that Libya is responsible under the Treaty for actions by its armed forces
and by several state agencies or instrumentalities. Some of these underwent organizational
and name changes over time. Claimant contends that all of the agencies concerned are

Libyan State organs.° They are:

- The “Housing and Infrastructure Board (“HIB”).'° Following various bureaucratic
realignments, HIB became a subordinate entity of the Ministry of Housing and
Utilities.'' It was the Libyan party in the large Tajura Contract to build infrastructure
for an urban development. HIB was established under Libyan law pursuant to
Resolution No. 60/1374 of the General People’s Committee. Article | of this resolution
provides that HIB “shall have legal personality and independent financial liability and
shall perform its competences set forth” in the Resolution. HIB is in charge of preparing

urban planning schemes and engineering designs for the development of towns and

villages, as well as rural or slum areas, and to set forth the necessary budget for such

projects. '?

- The Roads and Bridges Authority (“RBA”). The RBA was part of the Ministry of
Transport and was Al Hani’s initial Libyan contracting party for the Benghazi and
Misurata Contracts.'? RBA was established under Libyan law pursuant to Resolution
No. 143 of the General People’s Committee, which was later amended by Resolution
No. 273/1378, dated 2010. Under these founding resolutions, RBA has “legal
personality and independent financial liability” and is mandated to “perform its
competences” designated in the resolutions, which include a wide range of
responsibilities relating to land transportation, design and maintenance of roads and

transportation infrastructure, traffic control and monitoring.'*

- The Transportation Projects Board (“TPB”) is also part of the Ministry of Transport.!>
From July 2010 the TPB assumed RBA’s rights and obligations under RBA’s contracts
with Al Hani.'® TPB entered into the other road contracts at issue with Al Hani, the
TIAR, TIAR-NE, and Garaboulli Contracts. TPB was established under Libyan law
pursuant to Resolution No. 199/1378 of the General People’s Committee. Article | of
this resolution provides that TPB “shall be a financially independent legal entity and
shall exercise its competencies set out” in the resolution. TPB implements
transportation infrastructure projects such as roads, bridges and civilian airports,
including the preparation of technical and economic studies, design, engineering

specifications and financial estimates. '7

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On 24 June 2015, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID”
or the “Centre”) received from Strabag an Application for Access to the ICSID Additional

Facility and a Request for Arbitration, including Exhibits | through 21 (“Request”).

On 20 July 2015, the ICSID Secretary-General approved access to the Additional Facility
and registered the Request pursuant to Article 4 of the Additional Facility Rules and
Articles 4 and 5 of the Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules and notified the Parties of
the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to
proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Article 5(e)

of the Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules.

By letter of 18 September 2015, Claimant informed ICSID that it opted for the formula
provided in Article 9(1) of the Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules as the method of
constituting the Tribunal in this proceeding. In accordance with that provision, the Tribunal
shall consist of three arbitrators, one arbitrator appointed by each party, and a presiding
arbitrator appointed by agreement of the parties. In that same letter, Claimant appointed
Professor Antonio Crivellaro, a national of Italy, as arbitrator in this case; Professor

Crivellaro subsequently accepted his appointment.

On 20 October 2015, Claimant requested that the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative
Council appoint the arbitrators not yet appointed pursuant to Article 6(4) of the Arbitration
(Additional Facility) Rules and designate one arbitrator to serve as the President of the

Tribunal.

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 17 of 337

On 23 October 2015, Respondent appointed Professor Nassib G. Ziadé, a national of
Lebanon and Chile, as arbitrator in this case; Professor Ziadé subsequently accepted his

appointment.

By letters of 2 November 2015, the Parties agreed that the President of the Tribunal would

be appointed by the Parties using a list ranking procedure.

Following further correspondence from the Parties regarding the appointment of the
presiding arbitrator, Professor John R. Crook, a national of the United States of America,
was appointed as President of the Tribunal pursuant to the Parties’ agreed procedure for

the constitution of the Tribunal.

On 7 December 2015, the ICSID Secretary-General, in accordance with Article 13(1) of
the Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had
accepted their respective appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have
been constituted on that date. Ms. Frauke Nitschke, ICSID Legal Counsel/Team Leader,

was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.

On 3 February 2016, in accordance with Article 21 of the Arbitration (Additional Facility)

Rules, the Tribunal held a first session with the Parties by video-conference.

Following exchanges between the Parties and the Tribunal, the Tribunal issued Procedural
Order No. | recording the agreements of the Parties on procedural matters on 10 March
2016. Procedural Order No. | provides, inter alia, that the language of the arbitration be
English, and that the place of proceeding would be determined at a later date. Procedural
Order No. | also sets out a schedule in the event that Respondent files a request for

bifurcation of the proceeding.

Following observations from the Parties regarding the place of proceedings, on 8 April
2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, determining that the place of

proceedings is Washington, D.C.

On 22 August 2016, Claimant filed observations on the Respondent’s Request for

Bifurcation, together with Appendices | through 16.

On 8 September 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 rejecting Respondent’s
Request for Bifurcation, and inviting the Parties to consult and submit an agreed proposed
procedural calendar for the remainder of the proceedings, or, in the absence of an

agreement, set out each Party’s view on the procedural schedule for the arbitration.

Following correspondence between the Parties, and absent an agreement by the Parties, the
Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 on 4 October 2016, setting forth the procedural

Report of Mr. lan Michael Osbaldeston of Blackrock dated 8 March 2017, and an Expert
Report of Mr. Richard Lee Edwin of Blackrock dated 8 March 2017.

On 10 March 2017, Claimant wrote to the Tribunal noting the time of submission of
Respondent’s Counter-Memorial and requested that the Tribunal “disregard the Counter-
Memorial pending the Respondent’s explanation of the special circumstances that might
justify its failure to have met the [8 March 2017] deadline fixed by the Tribunal” further to
Article 33 of the Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules. Respondent responded by letter
of that same date, asking the Tribunal to deny Claimant’s request and providing an

explanation of the circumstances leading to its late filing.

By letter of 15 March 2017, the Tribunal informed the Parties of its decision to admit
Respondent’s Counter-Memorial into the record, in view of the circumstances described in

Respondent’s 10 March 2017 letter.

Following exchanges between the Parties, on 17 May 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural

Order No. 5 concerning document production.

On 29 June 2017, Claimant wrote to the Tribunal with reference to “a number of material
omissions in Respondent’s production of documents as ordered by the Tribunal in
Procedural Order No. 5,” requesting that the Tribunal order Respondent to produce certain

responsive documents.

Upon invitation from the Tribunal, on 11 July 2017, Respondent filed a response to
Claimant’s 29 June 2017 letter. In its letter, Respondent stated that it had “made extensive,
diligent and thorough efforts to search for and produce documents responsive to Claimant’s
Requests [for document production]” and had “duly produced documents that it has been

able to locate promptly and in good faith.”

By email of 13 July 2017, Claimant informed the Tribunal that it did not wish to maintain
its 29 June 2017 requests at this time. On 14 July 2017, the Tribunal took note of the

Parties’ correspondence and informed the Parties that it “consider[ed] the matter closed.”

On 13 October 2017, Claimant filed a Request for Provisional Measures, asserting that
representatives of Respondent had attempted to contact family members of a witness of
Claimant and that they had allegedly attempted to “place undue pressure on [the witness]
in respect of the evidence that he has given in this proceeding.” Upon invitation from the
Tribunal, on 16 October 2017, Respondent filed observations on Claimant’s Request for
Provisional Measures, denying Claimant’s allegations. Upon further invitation from the
Tribunal, Claimant filed a response to Respondent’s 16 October observations on 20
October 2017; Respondent then filed further observations on Claimant’s Request for

Provisional Measures on 22 October 2017.

By letter of 31 October 2017, the Tribunal noted that, in taking into account the Parties’
submissions on the Request for Provisional Measures, both Parties “view any effort by
either Party in these proceedings to influence the testimony of any witness offered by the
opposing Party to be wholly improper and unacceptable.” In this regard, the Tribunal
highlighted Respondent’s 22 October 2017 statement that it “denies that it has engaged in
any wrongful conduct and confirms that it has no intention to engage in such conduct to
influence, intimidate or otherwise interfere” with any of Claimant’s witnesses or family
members. The Tribunal concluded that “no further action is required at this time in

connection with the matters addressed in the Parties’ recent correspondence.”

FACTS

STRABAG’S INVOLVEMENT IN LIBYA PRIOR TO THE 2011 CONFLICT

Below, the Tribunal provides a brief summary of the factual background to the dispute as
set out in the Parties’ submissions. This summary is not exhaustive and does not constitute

any finding by the Tribunal on any facts disputed by the Parties.

Beginning in 2004, Strabag managers had conversations with senior Libyan officials
regarding the possibility of doing construction work in Libya. Claimant alleges that Libyan

officials sought them out for this purpose, and the record includes the minutes of a 2004

meeting attended by Mr. Saif El Gaddafi promoting Strabag’s involvement in construction

PATA:
ventures in Libya.”?

After exploratory visits by Strabag personnel, Claimant decided to proceed with work in
Libya, and was authorized to open a branch office by a 2006 decree.”! Strabag International
entered into the two substantial Benghazi and Misurata road contracts in October 2006 and

April 2007, respectively.

Pursuant to a subsequently adopted Libyan decree, Strabag in July 2007 entered into a joint
venture with LIDCO, and the joint venture partners then created Al Hani to carry on the
construction business in Libya. Strabag International’s Benghazi and Misurata Contracts
were then assigned to Al Hani with the written consent of the Libyan authorities,?? and Al
Hani subsequently entered into several additional contracts. Claimant alleges that
substantial amounts are due to it under all of these contracts on account of multiple alleged

failures by Libyan entities to meet their contract obligations.

At the outbreak of the Revolution in Libya in February 2011, Al Hani was party to six

relevant contracts:

- The “Benghazi Contract” dated 18 October 2006 between Strabag International and
RBA was concluded for the maintenance of 230km of dual carriageway coastal road
between Ajdabiyah and Al Marj.” This sector of road runs on either side of Benghazi
in the east of Libya.” Performance of the Benghazi Contract was essentially completed
and the road was opened for use prior to the Revolution, but final acceptance never

occurred.

west of Tripoli.?®

- The “Tajura Contract” dated 18 May 2008. This was a much larger contract between
Al Hani and HIB for design and construction work in connection with a major new
urban development in the city of Tajura, a suburb of Tripoli. The initial estimated
contract value was over 778 million Libyan Dinars (“LYD”). As the Tajura project
evolved, Al Hani was tasked to design and construct various utilities (water,

wastewater, gas, electricity) as well as road and other infrastructure.??

qd) Features of the Contracts

These contracts varied in their particulars, but included common features; the payment and
approval mechanisms in the several road contracts are described in the First Witness
Statement of Mr. Al Kelani Al Shooda, Director of the Accreditation Department of the
TPB.*° They all provided for payment by the employer within a specified number of days
upon presentation of payment certificates prepared by the contractor. These certificates
stated the amount of work performed during the covered period against quantities and work
indicated in the contracts. Prior to submission, they had to be reviewed and approved by

the engineering firm that served as the employer’s on-scene representative.

As described in Mr. Al Kelani’s Witness Statement and infra, the Libyan agencies involved
then had elaborate multi-stage, multi-participant procedures for review and approval of the
payment certificates. Each payment also had to be approved by the Finance Ministry and
by REKABA,?! an entity of the Libyan parliament that had, and sometimes exercised, the
power to disapprove or modify payments. Payments could only be made if the employing
agency was allocated sufficient funds through Libya’s parliamentary budget process.
Delays and deductions associated with the approval processes contributed to some of

Claimant’s claims.

The contracts authorized the employer to withhold from amounts due under approved
payment certificates a 5% retention against final completion and approval of the works, as

well as an additional 2% as a final guarantee of the works following their acceptance.

Claimant seeks a total of €37,116,842 for payment certificates said to have been approved
by the employer’s representative and submitted for payment, but not paid.*? Respondent
counters that Claimant should not ask for compensation for unpaid payment certificates

and additional works when Al Hani retains advance payments, which are monies received

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 28 of 337

for work that it did not perform.*? Respondent also contends that there were many errors

in the accounting of the amounts outstanding under the payment and bitumen certificates.

Under the contracts, the contractor was entitled to receive an advance payment of an agreed
percentage of the contract value from the employer (15% for the road contracts; 20% for
Tajura).*> The advance payments were to be progressively repaid by withholdings from
amounts due to Al Hani for approved payment certificates.*° Advance payments were made
to Al Hani against irrevocable bank guarantees to be released only after completion of all
work under the Contracts and the expiry of the remedial period under the guarantee

period.*”

Article 10 of the Tajura Contract illustrates this mechanism. It describes the advance
payment as a “credit” in the amount of 20% of the value of the contract, with the amount
of the credit to be deducted from payments to Al Hani “up to its total refund.” The terms
of the Contract do not specify or limit the purposes for which this credit may be used. The
credit is secured by an irrevocable and unconditional letter of guarantee provided by Al
Hani, which could be reduced as the credit was paid down.** The Tajura guarantee
arrangement appears to have partially lapsed through an administrative error by a Libyan
bank involved in the process of renewing it. After 2011, HIB insisted that Al Hani restore
the guarantee as a precondition for any agreement on partial payment and resumption of

work at Tajura. The reasons why this did not occur are disputed.

As discussed infra, except for the apparently lapsed portion of the Tajura guarantee, other
contractually required guarantees have remained in force in the years since Claimant’s

departure from Libya; Claimant alleges that they remain a significant potential liability. Its

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 29 of 337

claims for compensation include significant amounts in respect of fees paid to banks to
maintain the guarantees. While the “fronting” guarantee for the Tajura guarantee
apparently was allowed to lapse through a Libyan bank’s administrative error,*? the
evidence indicates that a related counter-guarantee, securing the Libyan bank for the
foreign currency portion of the advance payment, remains in effect between the Libyan

bank and ABC International Bank.*°

Strabag’s joint venture partner, LIDCO, was not required to provide guarantees. At the
Hearing, Respondent’s witness Mr. Al-Naas testified that LIDCO was exempt pursuant to
a resolution of the General People’s Committee. When asked why this resolution was
adopted, he testified that he believed “that that Resolution was because LIDCO is part of
the Libyan Government; and, therefore, the Government of Libya is the one who

guarantees LIDCO, or provides the Guarantee for LIDCO.”*!

Article 31 of the Tajura Contract gives the employer “the right to cancel the Contract and
to confiscate the guarantee” in various situations of non- or poor performance by Al Hani.
In response to the Tribunal’s inquiry at the Hearing, Respondent confirmed that it has not
called the guarantees in any of the contracts to cover its unrecovered advance payments.
However, Mr. Al-Naas indicated at the Hearing that HIB intended to call the guarantees in

its favor.*? The situation of the guarantees is further addressed infra.

At the time Claimant ceased its activities in Libya, the advance payments on the Benghazi
and Misurata road projects had been completely repaid.*? Indeed, more than was required
was withheld; Respondent’s witness Mr. Al Kelani stated in his First Witness Statement

that there was a balance in Al Hani’s favor for overpayments under both contracts.*

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 30 of 337

Mr. Al Kelani’s First Witness Statement includes a table setting out his calculation of the
unrecovered amounts of advance payments on the five road contracts;“* the Tribunal refers
to his evidence in this regard for purpose of illustration and makes no decision regarding
its correctness. The table indicates that approximately LYD349,000 remained on the small
TIAR-NE Contract guarantee, approximately LYD1.534 million on the TIAR Contract,
and a considerably larger amount about LYD25.9 million on the Garaboulli Contract,
where work had just begun when the conflict began in 2011.° This table indicates that of
LYD54,980,401.927 in advance payments on the five road contracts, slightly over half —
LYD27,786,195.53 was not recovered.

The largest advance payment was for the Tajura Contract, Al Hani’s largest project in
Libya. According to Mr. Al-Naas’s First Witness Statement, the total advance payment
under this contract was over LYD155.7 million, divided between over LYD62 million and
almost €90 million.4”7 (The Tribunal again refers to this evidence for purposes of
illustration, and makes no decision regarding its correctness.) As presented in Mr. Al-
Naas’s First Witness Statement, LYD20 million was deducted from the advance payment
to pay contract registration tax and stamp tax, leaving a net advance payment to Al Hani
of approximately LYD56 million and €89 million. According to his First Witness
Statement, “[b]y the time Al-Hani declared force majeure under the Tajura Contract on
March 3, 2011, it had performed less than 5% of the works under the Tajura Contract, and

repaid only approximately LYD2,962,008 of the Advance Payment.”**

At the Hearing, Mr. Al-Naas introduced what was characterized as a “correction” to the
figures given in his First Witness Statement. He revised his table to increase the amount of
the advance payment to Al Hani by approximately LYD20 million, reflecting a payment
by HIB to the Libyan tax authorities in connection with registration of the Tajura

Contract.”

LOSS AND DAMAGE TO AL HANI PROPERTY DURING THE 2011 Conruict®®

Armed conflict between Government forces and rebel forces seeking control of Libya
broke out in February 2011, beginning in the Benghazi area in the east of the country. In
response to these events, a NATO-led coalition began a military intervention in Libya and
enforced a no-fly zone. Al Hani suffered significant losses of equipment and facilities in

the ensuing months of conflict.

As of the end of December 2010, Al Hani’s equipment manager, Mr. Penkhues, calculated
that Al Hani had equipment in Libya valued at more than LYD100 million.*! As the conflict
intensified and spread, Al Hani sought to protect this property, moving vehicles and
equipment used on the Benghazi project to locations further west, and assembling and
attempting to secure vehicles and equipment at its sites, particularly at its large Tweisha

yard in the vicinity of Tripoli.*?

The mounting conflict between rebel forces and troops loyal to the regime and other
supporters was accompanied by a widespread breakdown of law and order. Al Hani’s
vehicles being evacuated from the Benghazi region were stopped on the coastal road and
were taken at a checkpoint. In February 2011, Al Hani’s large construction camp at Tajura

was overrun by a mob, looted, and partially burned. Appeals to police were unavailing.

On 3 March 2011, Al Hani invoked force majeure as of 20 February 2011 in letters to its
employers. Al Hani’s employers demanded that the company continue work, but Al Hani
declined to do so. Along with other international companies and foreign embassies, Al

Hani evacuated and demobilized its expatriate personnel in early March 2011.°?

As discussed infra, beginning in March and April of 2011, and continuing for several
months thereafter, some Al Hani sites were occupied for varying lengths of time by
organized military units loyal to the regime. Al Hani’s major facility at Tweisha was
occupied for substantial periods by soldiers of the 32" Reinforced Brigade, who
requisitioned numerous vehicles and a great deal of equipment, some of it against
receipts.*4 Military forces occupying the camps are said to have stolen other equipment,

and looted and damaged structures and equipment.°°

Misurata, located on the coastal road between Benghazi in the east and Tripoli in the west,
was the scene of intense conflict between regime forces and rebels. Al Hani’s construction
camp in the region suffered heavily in this fighting. The record includes photographs taken
by a surveyor analyzing the damage for insurance purposes in 2012; these include
photographs of buildings at the camp destroyed by fire, damage attributed to splinters from

NATO bombing, and cartridge cases of varying calibers.

As discussed infra, during this period, while Al Hani’s expatriate staff had left the country,
some of Al Hani’s local employees remained on duty and provided intermittent reports on
the state of Al Hani’s facilities and property. This information was used by Al Hani’s

equipment manager, Mr. Penkhues, to prepare reports to management.

In about August 2011, as the regime neared collapse, the elements of the 32™ Brigade that
had occupied the Tweisha camp withdrew. Before doing so, they are said to have

extensively vandalized the premises and remaining equipment.

On 27 August 2011, Al Hani sent its personnel to report on the Tawarga site. By this time,
the majority of the equipment in the Tawarga yard was reported as having “disappeared.”*°

2012, stated that the damage at the Tawarga site was “essentially cause[d] by NATO

bombardment and rebels attacks.”*”

Following the end of active hostilities in the fall of 2011, the evidence indicates that

widespread violence and breakdown of law occurred in the areas of Al Hani’s camps.

EVENTS AFTER THE 2011 CONFLICT

In the months after the 2011 conflict, Strabag explored the possibility of returning to work
in Libya. In September 2011, Claimant’s witness Mr. Napowanez and other senior Strabag
officials visited Libya to determine the state of Al Hani’s facilities and equipment and to
assess if it was possible to restart operations. They determined that it should be possible.°*
Mr. Napowanez and a team returned the following month to begin to assess what
equipment was left and what was needed to restart operations. They saw that much
equipment had been taken or damaged, including an asphalt plant that soldiers had used
for target practice.* In late 2011, representatives of Claimant met with officials from HIB
and TPB to explore the possibility of restarting work and of obtaining compensation for

called the “Twenty Committee” played a role in this process. As discussed infra, the Parties
disagree regarding the nature and authority of this body, and the extent to which it exercised
supervision or control over resumption negotiations. In any case, the evidence shows that
through some mechanism, a uniform practice came to be applied allowing for partial
payment of pre-war claims for firms that resumed work on pre-war contracts and agreed to
a separate procedure for addressing claims for wartime losses.°? On 19 February 2012, Al
Hani wrote to the Secretary of the Implementing Board of the Transportation and Projects
Board stating that it was willing to recommence and resume the execution of all the
remaining works; and that it expected to receive 50% of the outstanding payments while
the remaining 50% shall be paid in instalments within five months after resuming the
works.® On 12 March 2012, NJS and HIB met with Al Hani to discuss the Preliminary

Damages Report regarding losses sustained in the Tajura Project.

The security situation deteriorated during and after the summer of 2012; the U.S.
Ambassador and other U.S. personnel died in an attack in Benghazi in September, and Al
Hani’s equipment was stolen.® The minutes of a 5 September 2012 AI Hani Board meeting
describe a difficult and politically uncertain situation.®* Nevertheless, Al Hani continued

to discuss possible resumption of work with its contract partners.

In February 2013, Al Hani signed agreements with the TPB providing for Al Hani to
resume work on the Misurata, TIAR and Garaboulli road contracts. The TPB agreed to pay
50% of the amounts due for previously executed works, and to pay the balance within 6
months. Al Hani’s claims for wartime damages were to be settled by a committee in which

the Government had ultimate decision authority.°’? The TPB would not agree to any

For reasons that are disputed, Al Hani and HIB did not agree on resumption of work at

At some point subsequent to the initiation of the arbitration in June 2015, a large quantity
of Al Hani’s vehicles and construction equipment were removed from the Tweisha yard.

Claimant’s claim with respect to these missing vehicles and equipment is considered infra.

As discussed infra, the evidence shows that since the revolutionary hostilities began in the
late winter of 2011, conditions in Libya have been marked by recurring armed conflicts
between rival groups, widespread events of violence and breakdown of law, and the
absence of effective State authority in large areas. This has led to the absence of security

and safety at many times and in in many areas of the country.

The absence of law and order and of effective government control has implications for

some of Claimant’s claims. These issues are considered infra.

JURISDICTION

INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW.

Claimant contends that the Tribunal has jurisdiction under the Treaty and the Additional

Facility Rules to entertain its claims. Respondent denies that the Tribunal has jurisdiction.

To establish the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, Claimant relies on Chapter Two of the Treaty, and
in particular Articles 10-12. Article 10 provides that Chapter Two of the Treaty, setting out
the procedures for settling disputes, applies to disputes between a Contracting Party and an
investor of the other Contracting Party “concerning an alleged breach of an obligation of
the former under this Agreement which causes loss or damage to the investor or his
investment.” Article | | of the Treaty then authorizes, among different means of settlement,
compulsory arbitration of alleged breaches of obligations under the Treaty. In Article
12(1), each Contracting Party “gives its unconditional consent to the submission of a

dispute to international arbitration in accordance with this Part.”
Article | of the Treaty defines “investor” and “investment,” stating in relevant part:

(1) “investor of a Contracting Party” means:

25

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 37 of 337

(b) an enterprise constituted or organised under the applicable
law of a Contracting Party; making or having made an
investment in the other Contracting Party’s territory.

(2) “investment by an investor of a Contracting Party” means every
kind of asset in the territory of one Contracting party, owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an investor of the other
Contracting Party, including:

(a) an enterprise constituted or organised under the applicable
law of the first Contracting Party;

(b) shares, stocks and other forms of equity participation in an
enterprise as referred to in subparagraph (a), and rights
derived therefrom;

(c) bonds, debentures, loans and other forms of debt and rights
derived therefrom;

(d) any right whether conferred by law or contract, including
turnkey contracts, concessions, licences, authorisations or

permits to undertake an economic activity;

(e) claims to money and claims to performance pursuant to a
contract having an economic value;

(g) any other tangible or intangible, movable or immovable
property, or any related property rights, such as leases,
mortgages, liens, pledges or usufructs.
100. Claimant denies Respondent’s jurisdictional objection and requests the Tribunal to find

jurisdiction on the following grounds:”*

(ld) The Tribunal’s jurisdiction is founded on the dispute resolution provisions of the

BIT, in particular Article 10.

G)

Accordingly, for the Tribunal to assert jurisdiction, it must be satisfied that: (a)
Claimant is an investor and made an investment in Libya as defined by the BIT; (b)
there is a dispute concerning an alleged breach of Libya’s obligations under the
BIT; and (c) the alleged breach has caused loss or damage to the investor or his

investment.

In Claimant’s submission, each of these requirements arising from Article 10 is

satisfied:”°

- Claimant is an investor in Libya pursuant to Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT and
made, directly or indirectly, an investment in Libya as defined in Article 1(2)

of the BIT.

- Several breaches of the BIT by Libya have undoubtedly been alleged (and also
established) by Claimant.

- Those breaches have caused damage or loss to Claimant.

101. Respondent counters that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because:

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 39 of 337

The Tribunal considers the Parties’ arguments regarding jurisdiction in the order of

Respondent’s objections given above.

‘WAS THERE AN INVESTMENT?

Respondent contends that there was no investment protected by the Treaty, emphasizing
arguments to the effect that Claimant’s case ultimately involves no more than claims for
non-performance of road building and construction contracts. As such, Respondent
contends, there was no investment protected by the Treaty. (Respondent’s related
contention that the Treaty does not create jurisdiction over such claims involving contracts

is addressed infra.)

Respondent argues in this regard that Claimant’s activities in Libya did not have the
essential characteristics of an investment,** characteristics often referred to as the Salini
criteria, derived from Salini v. Morocco.® First, Respondent contends that Strabag
assumed no “investment risk” of the kind it understands to be required by the Sa/ini criteria.
Al Hani had contractual guarantees that it would be paid for its work. These insulated
Strabag from the risk that the venture would turn out not to be profitable, and shielded it
from the sort of risk characteristic of a true investment.®° Second, in Respondent’s view,
Strabag made no significant capital contribution to its activities in Libya. It instead looked
to advance payments from Libyan entities and to periodic payments to Al Hani for
completed work to fund its activities.*” Third, Respondent contends that Claimant’s
activities in Libya involved a series of limited-term construction contracts, and so was of
insufficient duration to constitute an investment.** Finally, Respondent contends that the
purported investment did not make sufficient contribution to Libya’s economic

development, as the road contracts were merely service contracts for road maintenance,

while it completed only a slight percentage of the work required under the Tajura

Contract.*?

105. Claimant counters that it indeed had a protected investment satisfying the Treaty’s
definition of investment,” notably in the form of its 60% interest in Al Hani. Claimant
observes that it also made substantial loans to Al Hani, constituting claims to money under
the Treaty definition;?'! had rights and claims to money under contracts;°? and had

substantial physical assets in Libya.”

106. In Claimant’s view, it made a multiyear commitment to projects in Libya, intending to stay
for the long term. In pursuit of this objective, Al Hani bought real property for its facilities
in Libya and imported heavy equipment that only made sense for a long-term investment.
Claimant contends that through all of these actions, it fully satisfied the Treaty’s definition

of investment.

107. Further, in Claimant’s view, the Sa/ini criteria, whatever their relevance in other settings,
are not relevant here. The Sa/ini criteria had their genesis in the requirements of Article 25
of the ICSID Convention, which limits ICSID Convention jurisdiction to legal disputes
“arising directly out of an investment.” In this context, some may see a need for a definition
of “investment” to determine whether an ICSID Tribunal has jurisdiction. This, however,
is not an ICSID Convention case. Claimant therefore submits that the only relevant

definition of “investment” is that contained in the Treaty.**

qd) Was There an Investment? The Tribunal’s Decision

108. The Tribunal finds that there was a protected investment within the meaning of the Treaty.
The Tribunal recalls in this regard that Article 1(2) of the Treaty defines “investment” as
“every kind of asset ... owned or controlled, directly or indirectly” by an investor.
Claimant’s activities in Libya conformed to the literal definition of investment under the
Treaty. Inter alia, Claimant had indirect ownership of a 60% majority of the shares in Al
Hani, a substantial enterprise carrying on a construction business in Libya, holding and
carrying out significant construction contracts, owning real property, and maintaining a
substantial physical footprint in the territory of Libya over several years. Indeed, as time
went on, LIDCO, Claimant’s co-shareholder in Al Hani, failed to respond to cash calls or
otherwise to contribute to Al Hani, requiring Claimant to provide significant financial

support in the form of loans.

109. Respondent calls for the Tribunal to give weight to the Sa/ini criteria, which in its view
show that there was no investment. Claimant denies their relevance in a case where
jurisdiction does not rest on Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, the context in which the
Salini criteria were first articulated. The Tribunal notes that pursuant to Article 3 of the
Additional Facility Rules, none of the Convention provisions, including its Article 25, are
applicable to Additional Facility arbitrations. However, the Tribunal does not need to
decide whether the Salini criteria have legal relevance here to determine whether an
investment for the purposes of Article 2(a) of the Additional Facility Rules exists, because
the record shows that if they were to be applied in assessing whether there is an investment
for the purposes of the Additional Facility Rules, they are satisfied. The Tribunal notes in
this regard the very substantial similarities between the activities at issue in this case and

those found to constitute investments in Salini v. Morocco and Toto v. Lebanon.*°

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 42 of 337

The evidence shows that Claimant committed substantial amounts of material and human
capital to its investment over a period of several years, acquiring property in Libya,
building large facilities, and importing large quantities of heavy equipment, including
material such as rock crushers that only made economic sense in the context of a long-term
presence in Libya.%° This level of effort is on a par with that identified by the Salini
tribunal.°” Claimant’s venture was hardly free from risk, as the events underlying this
arbitration show, events that involved risks far greater than those found sufficient in
Salini.°* Claimant clearly expected its efforts in Libya to be of a substantial duration,
beginning from its first exploratory visits in 2006 and effectively ending eight years later
with Mr. Napowanez’s departure in 2014. The Sa/ini tribunal found that that claimant’s
three years of road work in that case showed the existence of an investment.” And, in the
case at hand, Claimant’s work provided a social benefit to Respondent in the form of roads
that were significantly improved prior to the Revolution, although other improvements to
infrastructure were not completed due to the Revolution. The Sa/ini tribunal found that the
roads built by those claimants likewise had contributed to economic development; as the
tribunal there observed, “[i]t cannot be seriously contested that the highway in question

shall serve the public interest.” !°°

Accordingly, Respondent’s first jurisdictional objection is dismissed.

(2) Is Claimant an Investor?

Claimant contends that it clearly is an “investor” for purposes of Article 1(1)(b) of the
Treaty. It is an enterprise “constituted or organised under the applicable law” of Austria, a
Contracting Party to the Treaty, and it had made an investment in the territory of Libya,

the other Contracting Party.

113. Respondent, however, denies that Claimant was an investor within the meaning of the
Treaty. In Respondent’s contention, Article 1(1)(b) of the Treaty requires that an investor
be “making or having made” an investment. Respondent observes in this regard that
Strabag’s investment was made indirectly through two layers of wholly owned subsidiary
companies, a German company ILBAU, which in turn owned a second German company,

Strabag International, which owned 60% of Al Hani.!°!

114. Relying heavily on the analysis of Standard Chartered v. Tanzania,'”

Respondent urges
that the Treaty requires that Strabag itself directly provide any funds or other elements of
investment into Libya, without utilizing intermediate vehicles. By using ILBAU and
Strabag International as conduits for these purposes, Claimant Strabag did not itself “make”
an investment as required by Article 1(1)(b)’s definition of investor, because it did not
itself take direct action to bring the investment into being.'” Instead, Strabag International,
a German company “made” the investment, but it is not covered by Austria’s treaty with

Libya. '°

115. In reliance on Standard Chartered, Respondent submits that Article 1(1)(b) of the Treaty
requires that the claimant itself be the active party in the making of an investment. The
Claimant here did not itself directly carry on the activities involved in creating the
investment; it merely “held” an investment made through subsidiary companies, rather than
“making” one. Hence, it was not an “investor” within the Treaty’s definition. In
Respondent’s submission, the fact that the Treaty extends protection to investments owned
or controlled directly or indirectly is irrelevant. The issue is whether Claimant Strabag was

a covered investor because it “made” an investment. It did not.'°

Claimant disputes Respondent’s contention, pointing to significant differences between the
treaties and investments involved in Standard Chartered and its present claims. Claimant
notes that the Standard Chartered tribunal in fact acknowledged that an investment could
be made indirectly utilizing an entity to channel an investor’s contribution to the host
State,'°° and points to the broad definition of investment under the Treaty, emphasizing
that the definition expressly includes “every kind of asset ... owned or controlled, directly
or indirectly” by an investor. In Claimant’s submission, this confirms that the Treaty does
not require that an investor directly “make” an investment. Instead, the Treaty is clear that
it can do so through intermediate vehicles, such that its ownership or control can be
indirect.'°’ Claimant urges in this regard that investment jurisprudence makes clear that
investments include investments made indirectly through subsidiaries, as the Treaty

expressly authorizes. !°°

(3) The Tribunal’s Analysis and Decision

Under Article 14 of the Treaty, the Tribunal is to decide disputes in accordance with both
the Treaty and “applicable rules and principles of international law.” The Tribunal
therefore recalls that under the general rule of treaty interpretation set out in Article 31(1)
of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (“VCLT”), a treaty’s terms are to be
interpreted “in good faith in accordance with the[ir] ordinary meaning ... in their context.”
Under Article 31(2) of the VCLT, context includes the other words of the treaty. In light
of these principles, the Tribunal believes that the Treaty’s definitions of “investor” and
“investment” should be understood in their ordinary meaning and in a manner that renders

them consistent.

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 45 of 337

Thus, the fact that Article 1(2)’s definition of an “investment” includes assets “owned or
controlled ... indirectly”'®? by an investor necessarily informs what it means to “make” an
investment for purposes of Article I(1)(b)’s definition of “investor.” It is difficult to
understand how an investor could “make” an investment that is “owned or controlled ...
indirectly” given the narrow conception of “making” an investment urged by

Respondent.''°

The Tribunal finds that Claimant Strabag qualifies as an investor as defined by Article
1(1)(b) of the Treaty. It was, and remains, an Austrian corporation that satisfies the Treaty’s
definition of an investor. The Tribunal does not accept Respondent’s contention that
Strabag was not an investor because it utilized wholly owned German subsidiary
companies as the vehicles for implementing its investment plans. Claimant indeed “made”
an investment within the ordinary meaning of the term. That it made it through an
intermediate corporate vehicle does not disqualify it as an investor under the Treaty, which
explicitly covers “every kind of asset ... owned or controlled, directly or indirectly” by the

Claimant.

Respondent’s second jurisdictional objection is accordingly dismissed.

CLAIMANT’S STANDING TO BRING SHAREHOLDER CLAIMS
qd) Respondent’s Position

Respondent’s third objection is that Claimant is not entitled to seek compensation for the
value of losses incurred by Al Hani, including claims under Al Hani’s contracts and for
loss or damage to its property. In Respondent’s view, Claimant is asserting claims to the
property of a separate juridical entity, property that belongs to Al Hani and not to Claimant.

As summarized in Respondent’s Counter-Memorial:

109 TR 1:252:16-21 (Presiding Arbitrator Crook, Ms. Harwood); TR 1:253:12-13 (Ms. Harwood).

10 Other articles of the BIT are also part of the context of Article | for purposes of VCLT Article 31 and also caution
against giving excessive weight to “make.” Thus, Articles 2, 3 and 8 speak of “investments by investors” of a Party,
and Article 7 refers to “an investment by an investor.” These provisions do not speak of investments “made by
investors.” The treaty-makers apparently did not see any need to limit these provisions to investments “made” by
investors.

34

122.

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 46 of 337

Thus, Claimant is effectively arguing that by virtue of its indirect
60% interest in Al-Hani, through ILBAU and Strabag International,
all of Al-Hani’s assets (the loan, contractual rights, machinery,
equipment etc.) are transformed into investments made by Claimant
in Libya and protected under the Treaty.

There is no basis for that argument under the Treaty and
international law. While Claimant’s indirect holding of the 60%
equity interest in Al-Hani might qualify as investment under Article
1(2)(a) of the Treaty, that interest would not grant standing to assert
any rights with respect to the assets of Al-Hani (and a fortiori over
the loan extended by Strabag International, a German entity not
covered under the Treaty). In such circumstances, arbitral tribunals
have consistently held that indirect holding of shares in an entity that
may qualify as an investment under a BIT does not grant rights over
the assets of that entity.'''

112

Citing Postova Banka v. Hellenic Republic''~ and cases cited therein, Respondent
concludes that “all the claims relating to rights under the Contracts as well as to the right
to recover damages for alleged loss of machinery and equipment fall outside of the
jurisdiction of this Tribunal, because they relate to rights and property that belonged to Al-

Hani, not to Claimant.”!!3

(2) Claimant’s Position

Claimant counters that Respondent’s objection “ignores the wording of the Treaty, in
particular the express inclusion of indirectly held assets and loans” in Article 1(2)’s
definition of investment. Claimant refers as well to Article 10 of the Treaty, which in its
view provides standing to bring a claim.''* Claimant disputes Respondent’s reliance on
PoStova Banka, which in its view relies on “strained analogies” and cannot assist the
Tribunal because it involves a different investment, in a different country, under a different

treaty. |!

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 47 of 337

Claimant’s response emphasizes the broad definition of investment in Article 1(2) of the
Treaty, including its coverage of assets “owned or controlled, directly or indirectly” by an

investor:

As the Claimant has demonstrated, the chapeau of Article 1(2) is
extensive. It covers all types of assets, including those that are
owned or controlled by the Claimant indirectly. This treaty-based
conception of investment inevitably encompasses assets that belong
to Al Hani. That is entirely consistent with the object and purpose
of the Treaty, and many other arbitral tribunals have assumed
jurisdiction over claims in similar circumstances.!!°

(3) The Tribunal’s Analysis and Decision

As the Parties observe, this is not the first investment case in which a claimant seeks
compensation on the basis of its shareholding interests in a locally incorporated entity. In
Respondent’s view, in such circumstances, the claimant may recover only for the
diminution of the value of its shareholding interest caused by measures by the host State

contrary to a treaty.''7

In this case, however, Strabag does not claim on the basis of the diminution of the value of
its interest in Al Hani. It rather calculates and claims its losses by reference to losses and
damage incurred by Al Hani itself, such as unpaid payment certificates, costs for additional
works, costs for delays caused by Respondent’s authorities and the like, plus losses to
equipment said to be requisitioned, damaged or destroyed by Respondent’s armed
forces.''® In other words, Strabag seeks 60% of the compensation that it contends
Respondent’s authorities should have paid to Al Hani pursuant to the contracts for its

contract claims, or, pursuant to the Treaty for its treaty claims for war damages.!!'?

127. Claimant bases this argument upon the broad definition of investment in Article 1(2) of the
Treaty: “investment by an investor of a Contracting Party means every kind of asset in the
territory of one Contracting party, owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by an
investor of the other Contracting Party ...” (emphasis added.) The definition continues with
an illustrative list of covered assets, many of which Claimant maintains are at issue here.
In Claimant’s submission, Article 1(2) of the Treaty allows it to claim for loss and injury
sustained by Al Hani and its property, which Claimant views as “assets” that it “owns or

controls, directly or indirectly.”

128. The Tribunal finds force in this understanding of Article 1(2) of the Treaty in the unusual
factual context of this case. The evidence shows that, in reality, Al Hani was not in fact an
autonomous entity. It was instead controlled, and its operations directed, in all practical
respects by Strabag. Al Hani depended upon personnel and resources provided by Strabag
or its wholly integrated subsidiaries to carry out its business. Strabag, the Claimant here,

“retained ultimate control of [the] investment.” !?°

129. While Al Hani was formally the offshoot of a joint venture between Strabag and LIDCO,
the uncontested evidence showed that the joint venture was concluded in order to comply
with Libya’s domestic law requirements. Thereafter, LIDCO disregarded calls to inject
funds into Al Hani and seems to have played no significant role in its operations. In

particular, according to Mr. Knaack’s undisputed testimony:

I understood that LIDCO, Strabag’s joint venture partner, was a
governmental organisation which had responsibility for promoting
foreign investment — Al Hani was one of a number of joint ventures
that LIDCO had with foreign partners on infrastructure projects. The
problem we faced with LIDCO, a State-owned infrastructure
company, was that it failed to contribute its share of the funds
required by Al Hani. As a result of this, Strabag had to provide
significant amounts to Al Hani to finance its works with the result
that there was a significant disparity between Strabag and LIDCO’s
contributions. |?!

130. Mr. Knaack pointed to LIDCO’s recurring failures to respond to calls to contribute funds
required for Al Hani’s viability, ignoring a call for LYD24 million in October 2010!” and
another for €14 million in December 2010.'? LIDCO’s failures to provide its share of
necessary funding, combined with delays and difficulties in obtaining payment for Al
Hani’s work, forced Strabag to itself fund Al Hani in order to continue operations: “As a
result, Strabag had provided significant amounts to Al Hani, and in 2010 was paying in
particular the salary costs of Strabag’s management team and technical experts deployed
to Al Hani.” '?4 As Mr. Knaack explained to LIDCO in December 2010, “Al Hani had been
granted credit by Strabag to cover services, supplies, technical assistance and the
deployment of expatriate workers, which by then amounted to approximately

€36 million ...”'75

131. There is also extensive undisputed evidence showing that Strabag or its integrated
subsidiaries were at the heart of Al Hani’s day-to-day operations. Strabag companies
provided key personnel. Al Hani’s equipment manager Mr. Penkhues identified himself as
an employee of BMTI, a Strabag subsidiary that acts as a service department and provides
procurement and logistics services for Strabag projects in many countries. According to
Mr. Penkhues, “[i]n November 2008, I was seconded to work for Al Hani within its central
equipment and machinery division known as BMTI-Libya.”'?° BMTI-Libya operated Al
Hani’s main workshop at its large Tweisha facility.'"” Mr. Penkhues’ requests to procure
new equipment were sent to BMTI “who would liaise with Strabag’s head office in Vienna
and check the availability of the asset within the Strabag group.” If the item was not

available, its procurement had to be approved by Strabag’s head office in Vienna.'?8

Any income received from the Libyan project, and Strabag’s contributions to the project,
were reflected in Strabag’s inter-company account.'?? The record also indicates that
Strabag made substantial capital investments to establish permanent facilities in Libya,
including purchasing land, yards and offices; purchasing a fleet of heavy vehicles and other
heavy equipment and machinery; opening quarries; and establishing large facilities such as

concrete and asphalt plants. |"

Al Hani’s interconnection with Strabag was evidenced by the 2008 minutes of an internal
meeting between Strabag and its subsidiary Dywidag International, a Strabag entity with
expertise in infrastructure development.'*! At that meeting, the two companies addressed

creation of a consortium for the Tajura Contract. Their minutes recorded:

It was acknowledged that the Al Hani General Construction Co. was

a nonprofit entity [...] Al Hani, respectively the Joint Venture

STRABAG LIDCO, and its service departments shall not be

operating as a profit centre. All costs incurred by this organization

as well as all other costs of the service departments like, Accounts,

Camp, Workshop, laboratory, shall be allocated to the actual Project

executed by DIG and SI.'?
The record thus shows that Al Hani did not in fact operate as a separate company, but
instead operated under the clear control of Strabag and relevant subsidiaries. It was in all
but name a Libyan subsidiary of Strabag with full transparency, in which costs and
expenses, on the one hand, and revenues, on the other hand, pertained to Strabag, which
expected the return of its expenses through payments received by Al Hani, not through
dividends. There was no separation between Strabag and Al Hani, but rather economic
identity: the economic harm or shortfall in Al Hani was equivalent to the harm or shortfall

of Strabag pro rata commensurate to its share ownership.

In the Tribunal’s view, these circumstances clearly satisfy the requirements of Article 1(2)
of the Treaty. The investment here included a variety of assets, in addition to Strabag’s
60% interest in Al Hani, that were owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by Claimant.
The Tribunal accordingly denies Respondent’s jurisdictional objection to the effect that
Claimant improperly asserts claims for injuries to Al Hani’s property and interests. The

Tribunal will consider the implications of this decision infra.

Accordingly, Respondent’s third jurisdictional objection is dismissed.

ARTICLE 8(1) — THE UMBRELLA CLAUSE AND CLAIMANT’S CONTRACT-BASED
Cvaims!33

A significant portion of Claimant’s overall claim involves claims arising out of alleged
breaches of obligations under contracts, claims that Claimant contends can be decided by
the Tribunal pursuant to Article 8(1), the Treaty’s “umbrella clause.” Article 8(1) of the
Treaty provides: “Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered

into with regard to specific investments by investors of the other Contracting Party.”

ql) Respondent’s Position

Respondent maintains that the claims related to Al Hani’s contracts do not fall within the
scope of Article 8(1) of the Treaty and are therefore outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

Respondent advances four lines of argument in this regard.

Respondent first maintains that the claims asserted “are contractual claims that are outside
the scope of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction under the Treaty and are instead subject to the
dispute resolution clauses of the Contracts, which provide for submission of disputes to the
Libyan courts.”'*4 Respondent stresses throughout that it sees the core of Claimant’s case
to be contract disputes'*> that have no place in international arbitration and should be
resolved in Libyan courts applying Libyan law pursuant to the terms of the relevant

contract. For Respondent, these contracts are ordinary commercial contracts, and the

claims raised by Claimant result from “run of the mill” disagreements between a contractor
and its employers regarding payment and performance. These are the sorts of disputes that

often occur in commercial life; they do not involve violations of international law and

“have no place in arbitration under the Austria-Libya Treaty.”

Citing the views of Professor Georges Abi-Saab,'37 Respondent urges that under
international law, a tribunal must objectively assess the nature of a claim to determine if it
is a “self-standing treaty claim” as a matter of international law. Respondent reviews

Claimant’s specific allegations related to the contract, finding that they do not constitute

treaty violations'*8 and must be dismissed.'*?

Second, Respondent contends that the Article 8(1) umbrella clause does not transform
contractual breaches into treaty breaches. Respondent contends in this regard that “the
majority of tribunals have held that an umbrella clause such as Article 8(1), does not
transform simple contract claims, such as those in this case, into treaty breaches.” !4° In

support of its arguments, Respondent cites cases such as Joy Mining v. Egypt,'*' Toto v.

Third, Respondent maintains that the umbrella clause does not apply because Libya was
not a party to the contracts; there was no privity between Claimant and Respondent, which
Respondent views as essential to bring an umbrella clause into play. Respondent refers to
the majority opinion in Burlington Resources v. Ecuador'*® and the cases cited therein as

showing the need for privity of contract and as reflecting the dominant strain of case law. '4”

Respondent emphasizes in this regard that the contracts were entered into not with Libya,
but with RBA, TPB or HIB “all of which have their own legal personality, separate from
the State.” In Respondent’s view, [t]hese entities were acting exclusively within Libya’s
internal legal order, carrying out commercial obligations they undertook under the
contracts, which were governed by Libyan law.”'** These activities cannot give rise to

responsibility of the Libyan state under international law.

Respondent emphasizes that each of the contracts was the product of bargains struck
between Al Hani and its counterparty to which the State was not a party. Hence, Al Hani’s
claims lie against its counterparties, citing in this regard the decision in EDF v. Romania.”
Respondent finds misplaced Claimant’s reliance on cases such as Eureko v. Poland'* and
Noble Ventures v. Romania.'>' Respondent maintains in this regard that, unlike the entity
involved in Noble Ventures, HIB and TPB “are independent bodies whose actions are not

directed by the Libyan government.”!*2

Respondent further contends that there is no allegation that Libya “unjustly or improperly
annulled, modified or otherwise interfered with the contracts” so there was no relevant

conduct by the State that might lead to liability under international law.'*? Respondent

reiterates in this regard that the State of Libya was not party to the contracts, there is no

privity of contract, and Libya did not enter into obligations under them.

146. Respondent emphasizes the need to consider the specific wording of the Treaty,
highlighting in this regard the word “it”, which in Respondent’s view demonstrates that the
only relevant obligations are those directly entered into by the State.'** Respondent finds
support for this view in cases such as EDF v. Romania, and again disputes Claimant’s

155

reliance on Eureko v. Poland and Noble Ventures v. Romania,'”’ stressing that HIB and

RBA “are independent bodies whose actions are not directed by the Libyan

government.”!*

147. Respondent adds that, even if RBA, TPB and HIB are State organs which Respondent
denies the international law rules of attribution are irrelevant, pointing to the ILC’s
Commentary on its State Responsibility Articles, which takes the view that international
responsibility cannot arise from a breach of contract, even if the breach is by an entity
whose actions are attributable to the State.'*? Respondent finds support for this view in
Maffezini v. Spain'*® and Jan de Nul v. Egypt.'*? In Respondent’s view, there is no showing
that it exercised sovereign powers (puissance publique) in relation to non-performance of

the contracts. “Merely failing to make payments ... is not a sovereign act.”!°°

148. Fourth and finally, Respondent contends that all of the claims are subject to the contracts”
forum selection clauses or to the relevant provisions of Libya’s Contracting Regulations,

and must therefore be submitted to Libyan courts, not to the Tribunal, referring, inter alia,

to the views of Professor Abi-Saab supporting this understanding. '°' Respondent contends
that “investment tribunals have consistently ruled that an investor may not use an umbrella
clause to circumvent the forum selection clause in the relevant contract, which is an

essential part of the parties’ contractual bargain.”!©?

Respondent adds that international
dispute resolution should not be “misused” by claimants to avoid their contractual
obligations, citing SGS v. Philippines'® and other cases.'°4 Respondent refers as well to
the writings of Professors James Crawford and Zachary Douglas, the latter warning that
forum selection clauses exist to provide legal certainty and failure to observe them

“subverts this contractual certainty to the detriment of one of the parties.”!°

(2) Claimant’s Position

Claimant’s Reply contains a substantial examination of the history of umbrella clauses,
which in Claimant’s submission establishes they exist precisely to create international
jurisdiction over claims such as those involved here.'®° Claimant contends in this regard
that Respondent fails to acknowledge the basis in the Treaty for these claims and indeed
misrepresents Claimant’s case by repeatedly characterizing the claims as “breach-of-

contract claims.”'°7

In Claimant’s view, claims under Article 8(1) of the Treaty are treaty claims, not contract
claims, contending in this regard that Article 8(1) confers rights on a claimant and
obligations on a respondent State, so that its claims here are founded on international law,
not contract or Libyan law. Claimant points in this regard to Article 14(2) of the Treaty,

which provides that “[i]ssues in dispute under Article 8 shall be decided, absent other

agreement, in accordance with the law of the Contracting Party, party to the dispute, the
law governing the authorization or agreement and such rules of international law as may
be applicable.”'®* Claimant further maintains that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the
claims pursuant to Article 11(2) of the Treaty, which establishes international jurisdiction
to address claims under the Treaty. In Claimant’s view, the choice of Libyan courts in the
contracts cannot give those courts jurisdiction over the claims here, which are international

law claims founded on the Treaty. '°

151. Claimant thus insists that the Treaty’s Article 8(1) umbrella clause does bring its contract-
based claims before this Tribunal. Claimant urges in this regard that limitations on umbrella
clauses urged by Respondent, such as the privity requirement invoked by Respondent, are
not imposed by Article 8, and there is no textual basis to add them.'7 In this regard,
Claimant emphasizes the clear and broad wording of the clause, which covers “any

obligation.”

152. Claimant points to multiple cases, including SGS v. Philippines,'"' Eureko v. Poland,'”

174

Micula v. Romania‘? and Enron y. Argentina'™ that give broad effect to similarly worded

umbrella clauses. In Claimant’s view, the phrase “with regard to investments” further
demonstrates that investments owned by foreign investors are covered.'” In any case,

Claimant regards contracts entered into by Respondent’s public authorities as attributable

to Respondent under international law’s attribution rules. '7°

With respect to Respondent’s invocation of puissance publique, Claimant refers to its

7 which in

substantial historical review of the development of umbrella clauses, '7
Claimant’s view shows that there is no requirement that a contract breach involve the
exercise of sovereign powers in order to be covered by such a clause.'” In any case,
Claimant contends that the course of events here was shaped by exercises of puissance
publique, inter alia, in the role of the Twenty Committee, which in Claimant’s view
determined the limited extent to which Respondent would recognize pre-existing claims

and provide compensation for wartime damage. !7°

Claimant disputes the view that international jurisdiction can only be exercised with respect
to a violation of international law, contending instead that the provisions of the Treaty
create an international obligation that must be respected and that violations of Article 8 are
arbitrable violations of the BIT.'8° In Claimant’s view, the weight of international

jurisprudence supports this view.'*!

(3) The Tribunal’s Analysis and Decision

The Tribunal is of course mindful that the interpretation and application of umbrella clauses
is a much discussed and disputed subject, and that tribunals have taken varying positions

regarding these clauses. In the wake of SGS v. Pakistan,'**

sometribunals including many
cited by Respondent have interpreted these provisions narrowly, for example by limiting
their effectiveness to a narrow range of obligations involving sovereign conduct, or by
limiting them to agreements concluded directly between the State and the investor. Such
awards often involve tribunals’ rejection of alternative interpretations, either because they
are thought to have unacceptably broad practical implications, or because they would

expand the scope of international jurisdiction to matters that should be left to national law

and courts.

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 58 of 337

156. SGS v. Pakistan offers a familiar statement of such concerns. In that tribunal’s view:

Considering ... that under general international law, a violation of a
contract entered into by a State with an investor of another State, is
not, by itself, a violation of international law, and considering
further that the legal consequences that the Claimant would have us
attribute to Article 1] of the BIT are so far-reaching in scope, and
so automatic and unqualified and sweeping in their operation, so
burdensome in their potential impact upon a Contracting Party, we
believe that clear and convincing evidence must be adduced by the
Claimant. Clear and convincing evidence ... that such was indeed
the shared intent of the Contracting Parties to the Swiss-Pakistan
Investment Protection Treaty in incorporating Article 11 in the
BIT.
157. As Respondent observes, other tribunals have likewise understood umbrella clauses to have
a narrow scope, inter alia, for the reasons identified by Respondent in its objections

described supra.'**

158. However, there is also a substantial cohort of cases that comes at the matter differently,
and gives broader effect to umbrella clauses. Soon after SGS v. Pakistan, a second
investment tribunal addressed the same issue in SGS v. Philippines. In its Decision on the
Objections to Jurisdiction,'*> the SGS v. Philippines tribunal emphasized the specific
language of the umbrella clause in the Swiss-Philippines BIT. Comparing it with the
analogous provision in the Swiss-Pakistan BIT, the SGS v. Philippines tribunal found the
umbrella clause in the Swiss-Philippines BIT to be much clearer. Article X(2) of the latter
treaty did indeed offer treaty protection to “any obligation [each Contracting Party] has
assumed with regard to specific investments in its territory by investors of the other
Contracting Party.” The tribunal found these terms to be “clear and categorical” and to
require an “effective interpretation” consistent with the object and purpose of the treaty,

which was made for the promotion and reciprocal protection of investments. It also found

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 59 of 337

that the corresponding clause in the Swiss-Pakistan BIT simply provided for a “vaguer”

and less specific guarantee.

In the Tribunal’s view, this issue cannot be resolved by comparing the number of awards
expressing one view or another. As both Parties acknowledged in their arguments, it is the
words of a particular treaty that matter. Hence, the meaning of Article 8(1) of the Treaty is

ultimately a question of treaty interpretation.

As stated above, Article 31 of the VCLT requires that a treaty’s words must be interpreted
“in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the
treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.” The Tribunal therefore
starts from the perspective that treaty language should in principle be taken at face value,
and its ordinary meaning should not be altered or conditioned without clear justification.
Further, the language must be assessed in light of related provisions of the Treaty, and of
its stated purpose in its Preamble of “desiring to create favourable conditions for greater

economic co-operation between the Contracting Parties ...”

The Tribunal begins with Respondent’s first objection, its recurring argument to the effect
that Al Hani’s claims are ordinary commercial contract claims under private — and not
international law that are outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. For its part, Claimant deems
this a mischaracterization of its claims. In Claimant’s view, these are treaty claims,
predicated upon Article 8(1) of the Treaty. They have been properly brought before the
Tribunal and made subject to its jurisdiction under Articles 10 and 11. Under Article 14,
they stand to be decided by the Tribunal under Libyan law “and such rules of international

law as may be applicable.”'**

The Tribunal understands Respondent’s first objection to be closely linked to its second,
that Article 8(1) of the Treaty does not have the transformative effect asserted by Claimant,

so that it does not transform claims rooted in Al Hani’s contract disputes into claims arising

163.

164.

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 60 of 337

under international law. Respondent advances several arguments that in its view mean that

Article 8(1) cannot be given the effect advocated by Claimant.

Thus, at the Hearing, Respondent argued that interpreting Article 8(1) of the Treaty as
urged by Claimant would “open the floodgates to allow every commercial dispute in
contracts with States or State entities to find its way to an international tribunal convened
under a bilateral investment treaty.”'®” (As noted supra this is similar to the view of the
tribunal in SGS v. Pakistan.) However, such policy-based arguments do not fit into the
VCLT’s rubric of treaty interpretation. These are policy issues for treaty-makers to
consider in selecting the words of their treaty; they cannot later be imported to limit the

meaning of the chosen words.

Ina different vein, Respondent argues that Article 8(1) of the Treaty can operate only where
the State acts in a sovereign capacity involving some exercise of sovereign authority —
puissance publique — or that it can only apply to conduct involving breaches of
international law. Hence, Article 8(1) of the Treaty cannot apply to ordinary commercial
acts. The difficulty is that such arguments in effect call for the Tribunal to introduce limits
or conditions to Article 8(1) that do not appear in its language or necessarily follow from
its ordinary meaning. Respondent’s contention that Article 8(1) of the Treaty only covers
contractual disputes involving some exercise of puissance publique, for example, has no
foundation in the text of the article. Similarly, the argument that Article 8 can only apply
where there is a claimed breach of international law — one arising on some basis other than
Article 8(1) — has no basis in the text. Such arguments would limit Article 8(1) in ways that
have no foundation in its text and would, indeed, appear to deprive the provision of

effectiveness in all but rare situations.

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 61 of 337

While the Tribunal has great respect for the proponents of such views, it is not able to agree
that arguments regarding puissance publique or on the perceived inherent limits of
international jurisdiction can amend or condition the plain language of the treaty-makers
in Article 8(1). In any case, although the requirement of puissance publique is absent in
Article 8(1) of the Treaty, as discussed more fully infra, the factual circumstances clearly
show that Al Hani’s contracts were all made for significant public infrastructural projects
in the interest of Libya. Contracting for such public works contracts is in fact a typical State
function, not a commercial activity carried out jure privatorum. Further, their performance

involved actions by a range of State organs exercising their governmental powers.

Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that Respondent’s first and second objections to

jurisdiction under Article 8(1) of the Treaty must be rejected.

Respondent’s third objection revolves around the idea that there is no privity between the
Claimant here — Strabag — and the Respondent, Libya. In considering this objection, the
Tribunal recalls the elements of Article 8(1) of the Treaty (quoted supra, paragraph 137).
The first three elements require that a State party to the Treaty shall observe (1)
“obligation[s],” that are (2) “with regard to specific investments” by (3) “investors” of the
other Party. These three are met here. The contracts at issue contain “obligations” in the
ordinary sense of that term. They exist “with regard to specific investments” as outlined
above. And the Tribunal has found that Claimant is an “investor” for the purposes of this
Treaty. What is left to be determined is whether Libya, acting through RBA, TPB and HIB,
“entered into” these “obligation[s].” The issue, then, concerns the ordinary meaning of the

phrase “it [each contracting Party] may have entered into” of Article 8(1) of the Treaty.

In Respondent’s view, whether Libya “entered into” any obligations is a question to be
determined under Libya’s domestic law. Thus, as neither Claimant nor the State of Libya
are named parties to the contracts at issue, Libya did not enter into any relevant obligations.
The Tribunal, however, believes that the matter requires a more searching analysis and
involves more than asking “who is the formal party to the contract” under Libyan law.

VCLT Article 31 dictates that whether Respondent “entered into” the obligations at issue

50

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 62 of 337

is to be determined as a matter of international law in accordance with the words’ ordinary

meaning, in their context, and in light of the object and purpose of the BIT.

169. The Tribunal believes that an interpretation of the phrase “it [each Contracting Party] may
have entered into” in light of these factors leads to the conclusion that Respondent has

indeed entered into the obligations at issue.

170. The Tribunal first turns its attention to the term “it.” The ordinary meaning of this term
refers to “each Contracting Party.” The “Contracting Party” that is relevant to the
Tribunal’s analysis on this point is Libya. While it may be possible to argue that “Libya”
means exclusively the Government of Libya, such an interpretation would fail to take
account of the fact that, as noted by the commentary on Article 5 of the International Law
Commission’s Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts
(“ILC Articles”), States may operate through “parastatal entities, which exercise elements
of governmental authority in place of State organs [...].”'** The Tribunal therefore believes
that the term “it” does not mean only the Government of Libya, but may also include other

Libyan bodies.

171. The Tribunal now turns to the question of whether, for the purposes of Article 8(1) of the
Treaty, the RBA, TPB and HIB, by entering into contracts with an investor, are to be taken

as if Libya itself “entered into” the contracts.

172. The words of Article 8(1) of the Treaty must be assessed in light of the purpose and
structure of the Treaty and the relevant circumstances, including the nature of the entities

involved, of the contracts, and the manner in which they were concluded and implemented.

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 63 of 337

First, as suggested supra, the nature of the entities involved and of the contracts is relevant
to the assessment. The RBA, TPB and HIB were mandated to carry out functions deeply
bound up with important State interests and that are normally exercised by State organs.
They were vested for that purpose with elements of governmental authority. As confirmed
by Article 5 of the ILC Draft Articles, their conduct has to be considered as an act of the

Libyan State.

RBA is the Libyan administrative authority officially in charge of the Libyan road sector
including the planning, programming, budgeting, and implementation of road investments;
TPB is responsible for the implementation of the State’s general policies in the field of
terrestrial transportation; and HIB funds and executes the country’s infrastructure
investment program, and is the owner of all projects awarded and administered under the
program, which will improve housing, roads, bridges, water and utilities to Libyan

residents.

The contracts were concluded to carry out significant public projects important to
Respondent: rehabilitating major roadways in the TPB contracts, and the design and
construction of a major urban development project under the contract with HIB. These
were significant projects deeply bound up with important State interests. Their public
character is underscored by the fact that they were administrative contracts; under Article

3 of Respondent’s Administrative Contract Regulations'®?

such contracts must “target
realization of the public interest.”'°? These same regulations give the public agency
offering the contract unusual powers to terminate or alter contract provisions. While the
Tribunal is fully aware that the fact that the contracts concluded were administrative
contracts is not of itself dispositive for purposes of Article 8(1) of the Treaty, their legal
character underscores their connection with the State’s interests and is a relevant element

in the web of factors bearing on interpretation of Article 8.

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 64 of 337

Second, the circumstances surrounding the conclusion and implementation of the contracts
are relevant, and reveal that RBA, TPB and HIB acted at the direction of Libyan State
organs. As confirmed by Article 8 of the ILC Draft Articles, their conduct has to be

considered as an act of the Libyan State.

Respondent cites the separate legal personality and supposed budgetary independence of
RBA, TPB and HIB, but the evidence, including the Hearing testimony of several of
Respondent’s witnesses, paints a different picture. It shows that RBA, TPB and HIB could
not in fact act with full independence free of the State’s direction and control in a way that
makes them distinguishable from the State. Each of these entities was a sub-unit of a Libyan
Ministry.'°' RBA forms part of the Ministry of Transport, and prior to the Revolution, was
subordinated to the General People’s Committee for Transportation and Road Transport.
TPB also forms part of the Ministry of Transport. HIB forms part of the Ministry of
Housing and Utilities, and, prior to the Revolution, was subordinated to the General
People’s Committee. Their staff were subject to instructions from elsewhere in the
Government. Mr. Bisher of TPB tellingly testified that “I work within a governmental
body, and I get instructions from either the Chairman of the TPB or from the General
People’s Committee.” In this regard, Mr. Bisher cited a letter from the General People’s

Committee authorizing TPB to make a substantial partial payment on a design contract.!%?

Moreover, while in formal terms these bodies had their own budgets, they were entirely
dependent on funding provided to them by other State organs. This transpired from the
evidence of Respondent’s legal expert on Libyan law, Dr. Abuda.'** This was further

confirmed by Mr. Al Kelani’s evidence:

Q. Once REKABA approved, you could instruct payment, and
my question is: Where would that money come from to pay
the Payment Certificates?

as either Dr. Al-Koni or Dr. Abuda. However, both Parties referred to him as Dr. Abuda in their Post-Hearing Briefs,
and the Tribunal does so in this Award.

Q. So, the Finance Ministry sends funds to TPB to pay these
Payment Certificates; is that correct?

A. We have -- at the end of every year, we request a budget, so
we use those funds.

Q. So, this was money that was allocated from the general State
budget to TPB; is that correct?

A. Yes, that’s correct.!9>

Further, conclusion of these contracts required the approval of senior Government
authorities, and several of them (although not the TIAR-NE Contract) received separate
high-level approval. The General People’s Committee (“GPC”) separately authorized
conclusion of the TIAR Contract in a specified amount by a separate legislative act;'° the
copy of the TIAR Contract in the record includes the GPC’s decision authorizing the
Contract.'*” A variation order for the Benghazi Contract was approved by the “Secretary

of the General People’s Committee for Transport.” '°*

Moreover, both the terms of their contracts and payments thereunder required approval by
REKABA, Respondent’s witness Mr. Al-Naas, describes REKABA as “a control, an
autonomous independent body whose task is to supervise the projects and the funds”!?
that “reports directly to Parliament.”?°° Mr. Al Kelani, who is Respondent’s principal
witness on the road contracts, describes it as being “linked to the legislative.”?°' While the

mere oversight by REKABA does not of itself lead to the conclusion that the State entered

into the contracts, as found by the Tribunal in this case, the evidence shows that REKABA
exercised these powers of supervision vigorously. Mr. Al Kelani describes in detail in his
First Witness Statement how all payments required REKABA’s approval, making clear
that REKABA could and did exercise this authority to block or modify payments to Al

Hani.?

181. The record is replete with instances where contracts were altered, payments were denied
or revised, and other aspects of contract performance altered by REKABA or other entities
in a manner showing RBA’s, TPB’s and HIB’s limited autonomy. As Mr. Al Kelani’s
evidence makes clear, TPB and HIB could pay only amounts approved by REKABA, and
the record shows that REKABA reduced or delayed payment of amounts claimed by Al
Hani. Mr. Turki acknowledged in this regard that the entity he identified as REKABA
criticized Al Hani’s work on the 11" of June Road, triggering reductions in the amount to

be paid.?°? New contracts also required REKABA’s approval,?°*

and the agency also
exercised its powers to revise the terms of contracts and to add conditions or requirements.
The Tajura Contract thus had to be revised and then signed a second time because of
demands by REKABA.?°5 REKABA imposed a limit on the number of variation orders
that contractors could submit, thereby limiting or delaying Claimant’s compensation for

work performed.?°

182. REKABA was not the only constraint on these agencies’ autonomy. The Ministry of
Finance was also deeply involved in their financial operations. Mr. Al-Naas confirmed that

payments under the Tajura Contract also required approval by “the financial auditor, a

representative of the Finance Ministry.”?07 Mr. Al Kelani confirmed that payments required

approval of both REKABA and the Finance Ministry:

Q. And you could only pay (a) if you received those funds from
the Finance Ministry in the budgetary process, and (b) if
REKABA approved the payment by sending a yellow or
green sheet?

A. Yes, that’s true.?°8

Following the Revolution, the Tribunal understands the evidence to show that TPB and
HIB did not have independent authority to resume dealings with Al Hani, but could do so
only under the guidance, and possibly the direction, of a Government body called the
Twenty Committee. This entity established limiting conditions within which work might
be resumed and past work paid for. In its Counter-Memorial, Respondent described the
Twenty Committee as established to “(i) study development contracts entered into by Libya
with foreign companies; (ii) study claims for losses submitted by companies; (iii)
determine losses due to the 2011 Revolution; and (iv) determine whether these contracts

should be terminated, renewed, or modified.”?°

The Parties disagree regarding the significance of the Twenty Committee, and Respondent
provided no documentation concerning its activities in response to Claimant’s requests
during the document production phase. There was evidence that the Twenty Committee
played a substantial role in, for example, decisions regarding possible resumption of the
Tajura Contract. Mr. Turki thus testified at the Hearing that in considering terms for
resuming work at Tajura, “we dealt here with an administration that was in a higher — that
had a higher status, and it gave us instructions, and this was some of the instructions that

were given to us at the time with regards to our dealings with the Contractors.”?!°

185. At the Hearing, Respondent introduced a number of “corrections” to previously filed
witness statements that often appeared intended to lessen the relevance of the Twenty
Committee. As noted infra, Respondent offered the Chair of the Twenty Committee as a
legal expert (without disclosing his earlier role to the Tribunal), but not as a fact witness

able to clarify the disputed matters. Claimant criticizes Respondent’s reluctance or inability

to provide any documents in document phase and calls for adverse inferences.?!!

186. The Tribunal considers it helpful to point to the reasoning of the tribunal in Toto v.

Lebanon, which, in not dissimilar circumstances, held as follows:

51. The Contract was initially made with the CEGP [Conseil
Exécutif des Grands Projets], which was established by
Decree no. 6839 of June 15, 1961. Article | of this Decree
provided that the CEPG is in charge of studying and
implementing the projects entrusted to it by the Council of
Ministers. The CEPG was attached to the Ministry of Public
Works and Transport which monitored the execution of the
projects entrusted to the CEPG. The CEPG had a distinct
legal personality and enjoyed administrative and financial
autonomy. However, it operated under the control of the
aforementioned Ministry and the authority of the Council of
Ministers, and was also subject to the disciplinary authority
of the Central Inspectorate. The CEPG had its own funds,
which originated’ from the amounts allocated in the State
budget to the projects to be performed by the CEPG.

§2. Based on the foregoing, the CEPG, being an établissement
public administratif linked to the Ministry of Public Works
and Transport and operating under the authority of the
Council of Ministers, was a public entity (“personne morale
de droit public’) that was created and mandated by Lebanon
to exercise elements of governmental authority.

53. In brief, the CEPG, with projects funded by the State budget,
and in charge of implementing the decisions of the Council
of Ministers, exercised Lebanese governmental authority
when it entered into the Contract with Toto. As also
confirmed by Article 5 of the ILC Draft Articles, its conduct
has to be considered as an act of the Lebanese state.?'*

Reviewing the overall circumstances cumulatively, including the public importance of the
functions carried out by RBA, TPB and HIP and their vesting with governmental
authorities, their lack of administrative and financial economy, the nature of the contracts
and their being deeply bound with state interest, and the existence of overwhelming
evidence that demonstrates that an array of public authorities had a major hand in the
conclusion and performance of the contracts, the Tribunal is of the view that, in this case,
there is an exceptional combination of circumstances compelling the conclusion that the
Respondent did, indeed, “enter into” the obligations in the disputed contracts within the

meaning of Article 8(1) of the Treaty.

Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the several contracts between Al Hani and RBA, TPB
and HIB fall under Article 8(1) of the Treaty.

RECOURSE TO LIBYAN COURTS.
(ld) Respondent’s Position

Respondent’s fourth objection to jurisdiction is that, should the Tribunal elect to consider
Claimant’s claims predicated upon its contracts, Claimant cannot pick and choose which
contract provisions to apply. The contracts provide that the governing law is Libyan law,
and that disputes are to be resolved in Libyan courts. In Respondent’s view, any disputes

related to the contracts must therefore be addressed by Libyan courts, not by this Tribunal.

The Tribunal received varying translations of the relevant contract clauses; the differences
among them appear to reflect differences of translation and not of substance. All appear
similar in substance to Article 53 of the Tajura Contract, which provides that “the Libyan
Court is the competent court to settle any disputes arising from this Contract.”?!>
Respondent adds that under Libyan law, State entities like RBA, TPB, and HIB cannot
enter into arbitration agreements. Hence, under the terms of the contracts, and as a matter

of Libyan law, Claimant’s claims must be determined by Libyan courts.

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 70 of 337

(2) Claimant’s Position

191 Claimant offers several responses. As discussed supra, it urges that its claims related to the
contracts are treaty claims based on Article 8(1) of the Treaty. They thus exist on the plane

of international law and are not contract claims under private law.?!*

192. Claimant adds that the Treaty gives it an express right to arbitrate its claims based on
Article 8(1) through the dispute settlement mechanism created by the Treaty. Respondent
expressly consented to such arbitration in Article 12(1) of the Treaty, where Libya gave
“unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration ...” In
Claimant’s view, requiring recourse to Libyan courts would deprive it of this right under
the Treaty. Claimant points out in this regard that in Austrian treaty practice, where Austria
intends for umbrella clause claims to be determined through contracts’ dispute settlement

procedures, it does so expressly.?!>

193. Claimant disputes Respondent’s contention that Libyan domestic law supersedes its treaty
right to arbitration. In this regard, its post-Hearing submission of additional materials

includes Libyan legal authorities?'®

said to show that in Libya’s domestic law treaty
obligations have domestic legal effect and have a status superior to statutes. Hence,
Claimant’s treaty right to arbitrate prevails over any Libyan laws or regulations claimed to

limit recourse to international arbitration under the Treaty.

194. Finally, Claimant points to the poor security situation in Libya, contending that it could not
expect secure conditions or a fair hearing should it be required to pursue its claims in
Libyan courts.?!’ Claimant’s Post-Hearing Brief points in this regard to the testimony of
Libya’s witnesses at the Hearing regarding the poor state of Libya’s legal system under

current conditions.?!* And, in response to the Tribunal’s request to both Parties, its post-

Hearing submission of additional evidence includes multiple reports by human rights
groups and other independent observers sharply critical of the current state of Libya’s

courts.?!9

(3) The Tribunal’s Analysis and Decision

The Tribunal is mindful that whether an umbrella clause carries with it the duty to give
effect to contract provisions requiring recourse to local courts is a disputed question on
which tribunals have taken varying views. It is also mindful that both Parties have offered

substantial arguments in support of their positions.

However, the Tribunal believes that in this case, this issue must be considered in light of
the protracted conditions of insecurity in Libya since 2011. A compelling body of evidence,
adduced by both Parties, shows that since the revolutionary hostilities in 2011, conditions
in Libya have been characterized by recurring events of intensive fighting between rival
groups, widespread violence, and the widespread breakdown of State authority. As a
practical matter, there is not today, and has not been for some years, the possibility for
Claimant to pursue its claims in Libyan courts in tranquility and safety. Indeed, during the
July 2018 Hearing, one witness was unable to travel to Tunis by air due to the suspension
of Libyan Airlines Service precisely because of a conflict between rival factions seeking

control of the airline.?”°

As discussed infra, Respondent itself introduced evidence highlighting these conditions,
inter alia, in contesting Claimant’s claims related to its alleged failure to provide full
protection and security, both generally and in the specific context of the removal of a large

quantity of Al Hani’s equipment from the Tweisha yard in 2014.

Claimant similarly cited the “dangerous situation and the undeniable existence of force
majeure conditions” when it gave notice of force majeure to its employers in March 2011,
followed by departure of Al Hani’s expatriate staff from Libya.”?' Claimant’s witness Mr.
Napowanez described a deteriorating security situation in 2013, as Strabag and Al Hani
sought to resume operations, leading him to conclude “[w]ith increased physical danger,

and the lack of protection that we were getting from Libyan police and security forces, we

99222

could not guarantee the safety of the sites or our employees.”**> Mr. Napowanez left Libya

223

in early 2014.

Later in 2014, the September Report of the UN Secretary-General to the UN Security

Council on political and security developments in Libya observed, inter alia:

2. The reporting period witnessed the most serious outbreak of
armed conflict, in Tripoli, Benghazi and elsewhere in the
country, since 2011. The use of heavy weaponry in densely
populated areas by all sides, in particular in the capital,
resulted in an unprecedented movement of population as
civilians tried to escape the fighting. An estimated 100,000
people were displaced in Tripoli, with an additional 20,000
in the east. At least 100,000 are known to have crossed the
borders into neighbouring countries ...

4. Following six weeks of armed hostilities in the capital in July
and August, Libya appeared to be descending into a period
of instability and uncertainty.?4

The UN Secretary-General’s report from February 2015 described a worsening situation:

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 73 of 337

2. ... [D]uring the reporting period, the overall security in the
country continued to deteriorate sharply. Armed hostilities
spread to the country’s north-west, the eastern oil crescent
area and the southern region. In the east, fighting intensified
in Benghazi, causing the breakdown of much of the city’s
public services, resulting in severe shortages in the supply of
food and medicine. The continued indiscriminate shelling
and use of air assets against targets in heavily populated
areas and strategic installations across the country
underscores the growing plight of the civilian population and
the systematic destruction of much of the country’s vital
infrastructure.

3. The closure of much of Libyan airspace to commercial
flights, combined with an escalation in fighting across
different parts of the country and diminished State capacity
to provide basic services, aggravated the humanitarian crisis
triggered over the summer months by the outbreak of
violence in July 2014 and the gradual breakdown of law and
order across the country.??>

201. Other reports by the UN Secretary-General of record in this case are to like effect. His

December 2016 report observes, inter alia:

12. The security situation in Tripoli remained fragile. The
Presidency Council partially moved from the Abu Sittah
naval base to the office of the President of the Council in the
city centre and installed itself in a number of ministries and
other government buildings. The Council faced serious
obstacles in implementing its mandate to govern. With only
limited control on the ground and in the absence of security
forces at its disposal, the Council was compelled to rely on
armed groups committed to the Libyan Political Agreement
for its security. Civil servants were divided between the
Council and its political opponents, further complicating
efforts to improve service delivery. The provision of public
services in the capital, including water and electricity,
deteriorated, giving rise to public protests.

13. Tripoli remained under the control of a patchwork of armed

groups with differing agendas and loyalties, from both
Tripoli and the surrounding areas, including Misratah.

Rivalries over funding and territorial control between the

groups regularly led to clashes. In June and September,

elements of the Salah al-Burki brigade and the Abu Salim

armed group clashed in central Tripoli, leaving at least 10

people dead. Further clashes in October, close to Tripoli’s

Mitiga airport, between the Tripoli Revolutionaries Brigade

and the Yusuf al-Buni brigade, caused a number of

fatalities. °°
At the Hearing, the Tribunal sought the views of the Parties’ legal experts as to whether
Claimant’s claims could have been properly adjudicated in Libyan courts had Al Hani
sought relief in that forum rather than the Treaty forum. Both testified that, due to poor
security conditions, the courts are not regularly operating in Libya since the Revolution of
2011. Their oral evidence was that some judges were killed, others are impeded from going
to office or, in most cases, impeded from exercising their judicial function, inter alia, due

to lack of personnel employed by courts to provide clerk services.7””

At the Tribunal’s request, after the Hearing the Parties, especially Claimant, produced
multiple reports and reliable information from outside sources on the current security
situation and the conditions of the judiciary in Libya. In the Tribunal’s understanding, this
evidence, some of which is cited above, confirms that the state of the Libyan courts remains

very critical.

The Tribunal thus understands, on the basis of the evidence adduced, that the Claimant had
no viable mechanisms for settling disputes with the Libyan State entities involved here

other than resorting to Treaty arbitration.

In international law, the issue of whether a contractual forum selection clause is “capable
of being performed” is not new. By way of illustration, Article 6(1)(d) of the 2005 Hague
228

Convention on Choice of Court Agreements~” provides that an exclusive choice of court

agreement may not be enforceable when “for exceptional reasons beyond the control of the

26 RL-103, UN Secretary-General report on UN Support Mission in Libya, Doc. No $/2016/1011, | December 2016

12-13.

227 See, e.g, TR 8:1844-1845; TR 8:1943 (Drs. Ahnish and Abuda).
228 Although Libya is not party to the Convention, it reflects established international practice.

63

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 75 of 337

parties, the agreement cannot reasonably be performed.” The Explanatory Report on the
Convention comments on this exception in its Article 6(1)(d), explaining that “one
example” of the impossibility to enforce the choice of court clause is the case “where there

3922

is a war in the State concerned and its courts are not functioning.”””° This is exactly the

current situation of the judiciary in Libya, starting from 2011 onwards.
206. On the same matter, Professor Born comments as follows:

Authorities in some jurisdictions have indicated that forum selection
clauses will not be enforced where doing so would be
“unreasonable” or “unjust.” This potentially broad exception has
included claims that the contractual forum would be a substantially
less convenient place for legal proceedings, or that the contractually
chosen courts cannot grant effective relief or are closed to one
party.3?
207. Accordingly, from an international law perspective, the Tribunal concludes that its treaty-
based jurisdiction is not barred by the provisions in the several contracts or Respondent’s
Administrative Contracts Regulations referring disputes arising from or connected with the

contracts to the jurisdiction of the Libyan courts.

208. The Tribunal concludes that, given the conditions in Libya existing at relevant times in this
dispute, Claimant could not pursue its contract-related claims in Libyan courts in safety or
with any reasonable expectation of a considered and expeditious outcome. Claimant is
entitled to a forum in which to pursue its claims, whether in this Tribunal pursuant to the
Treaty (as Claimant would have it) or in Libyan courts (as Respondent contends). The
evidence shows that Libyan courts are not a practicable and safe option. The Tribunal
therefore decides that, in the circumstances presented, Respondent’s further objection to

jurisdiction is denied.

CONCLUSION CONCERNING JURISDICTION

The Tribunal dismisses Respondent’s objections that the Tribunal does not have

jurisdiction under the Treaty.

However, before turning to the merits of the dispute, the Tribunal must also consider
whether the present dispute falls within the scope of the Additional Facility Rules. The
dispute is between Strabag, a juridical person incorporated under the laws of Austria, i.e.,
a national of an ICSID Contracting State, and a State Party which is not an ICSID
Contracting State, Libya. The Tribunal has concluded that Strabag has made an investment
for the purposes of the Treaty and hence for the purposes of Articles 2(a) and 4(2) of the
ICSID Additional Facility Rules. The prerequisites for Libya’s consent to ICSID
Additional Facility arbitration as set out in Articles 10, 1 | and 12 of the Treaty are fulfilled,
i.e., consultations were requested prior to the institution of the arbitration proceedings in
accordance with Article 1] but there was no solution to the dispute within the prescribed
time-period. In accordance with Article 10 of the Treaty, the dispute refers to alleged
breaches by Libya of the Treaty, which is said to have caused loss and damage to
Claimant’s investment. Claimant’s written consent to ICSID Additional Facility arbitration
is found in the Request for Arbitration. The dispute is therefore of a legal nature arising
directly out of an investment in accordance with Article 2(a) of the Additional Facility
Rules. Access to the Additional Facility was granted by the Secretary-General of ICSID on
20 July 2015. The Tribunal, therefore, concludes that it has jurisdiction under the Treaty to

address Claimant’s claims.

CLAIMANT’S TREATY CLAIMS

INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW

Claimant alleges that Respondent’s conduct violated at least six articles of the Treaty, listed

here in the order in which they were introduced in Claimant’s Memorial.

a)

(2)

GB)

4)

6)

(6)

231

Article 5(2) — requisition or damage to property in the course of armed conflict;?>?

233

Article 3(1) — failure to provide full and constant protection and security;

Article 8(1) failure to respect specific obligations entered into by Respondent,

contrary to an “umbrella clause;??34

Article 3(1) — failure to accord Fair and Equitable Treatment;?>

Article 4 — Indirect expropriation, in that Respondent took measures that in the

aggregate were “tantamount to expropriation;”?°° and

Article 3(2) impairment of Claimant’s management, operation, use and

enjoyment of its investment by unreasonable or discriminatory measures.?>”

The Parties disagree regarding the correct interpretation and application of some of these

articles of the Treaty. The Tribunal addresses certain of these disagreements in the

following paragraphs; it will provide more detailed comments on others in the context of

the facts of particular claims.

B. ARTICLE 5(2) — REQUISITION OR DAMAGE TO PROPERTY IN ARMED CONFLICT

213. Article 5 of the Treaty provides:

(1) An investor of a Contracting Party who has suffered a loss
relating to its investment in the territory of the other Contracting
Party due to war or to other armed conflict, state of emergency,
revolution, insurrection, civil disturbance, or any other similar
event, or acts of God or force majeure, in the territory of the
latter Contracting Party, shall be accorded by the latter
Contracting Party, as regards restitution, indemnification,
compensation or any other settlement, treatment no less
favourable than that which it accords to its own investors or to
investors of any third state, whichever is most favourable to the
investor.

(2) An investor of a Contracting Party who in any of the events
referred to in paragraph (1) suffers loss resulting from:

(a) requisitioning of its investment or part thereof by the forces
or authorities of the other Contracting Party, or

(b) destruction of its investment or part thereof by the forces or
authorities of the other Contracting Party, which was not
required by the necessity of the situation, shall in any case
be accorded by the latter Contracting Party restitution or
compensation which in either case shall be prompt, adequate
and effective and, with respect to compensation, shall be in
accordance with Article 4(2) and (3).

214. There appears to be no significant difference between the Parties regarding the
interpretation of Article 5(2)(a) as it relates to requisitioning. Instead, the issues involving
this provision are factual. Claimant alleges that a significant quantity of property was
requisitioned by Libyan Government forces and not subsequently returned. Respondent
counters that Claimant has not met its burden of proof to show that this occurred. The

Tribunal addresses these issues infra in its assessment of Claimant’s requisition claims.

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 79 of 337

ad The Parties’ Positions Regarding the Meaning of “Military Necessity” in
Article 5(2) and the Burden of Proof

The Parties disagree regarding application of the other provisions of Article 5(2) of the
Treaty, dealing with property allegedly destroyed by Libyan State forces “which was not
required by the necessity of the situation.” Their principal disagreement involves which of
them bears the burden of proving that the destruction of particular property was not

required by military necessity.

In Respondent’s view, the plain text of Article 5(2) places the burden on Claimant, as the
Party asserting a claim for destruction of property, to prove a key element of its claim.
Hence, Claimant must show that the destruction of particular property was not required by
military necessity. Respondent refers to the 1990 award in AAPL v. Sri Lanka,?*® as
showing that this burden demonstrating the absence of military necessity falls on

Claimant.

As to the meaning of military necessity, Respondent refers to the 1948 U.S. Military
Tribunal decision in Von Leeb, where the tribunal allowed a defense of military necessity.
In Respondent’s view, Von Leeb shows that a tribunal assessing military necessity must
recognize the uncertainties and pressures involved in armed conflict; as the Military
Tribunal observed, “the factual determination as to what constitutes military necessity is
difficult.”?3? Thus, for Respondent, military necessity “must be determined based on the
totality of the circumstances at the relevant time and place, without the benefit of

hindsight.”4°

Claimant counters that the burden of proving military necessity must fall on Respondent,
whose troops allegedly caused damage and which is best able to explain the surrounding
circumstances.**' Claimant contends that under accepted principles of evidence, if
Respondent claims the military necessity of its troops’ actions, it has the burden of proving
that claim. Claimant maintains in this regard that Respondent offered nothing to rebut what
Claimant sees as a prima facie case of liability.7*? Claimant adds that the result in AAPL

243

has been heavily criticized,“*’ referring as well to an opinion by Professor Schreuer

analyzing the effect of investment treaties in wartime that rejects Respondent’s view.?*4

In Claimant’s view, Respondent advocates an overbroad and outdated conception of
military necessity that does not reflect the evolution of the law of armed conflict since
1948, citing in this regard academic writings and jurisprudence of the International
Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia emphasizing the general prohibition on
targeting civilians and civilian property.*° This jurisprudence, Claimant contends,
establishes that the prohibition against attacking civilians and civilian objects may not be
derogated from, except in narrow cases where civilian property has been transformed into
a military objective that makes an effective contribution to a combatant and where attack

would offer a definite military advantage proportionate to the destruction caused.?°

These issues of the burden of proof and determination of military necessity are bound up
with the facts and the evidence of Claimant’s specific claims for the destruction of property
by Respondent’s forces. As examined infra, a key threshold issue in these claims is to
determine who caused particular damage, before turning to more nuanced and factually

complex questions of military necessity. These matters are assessed infra in connection

(2) Is Article 5 Lex Specialis, Ousting Other Treaty Pro

221. Respondent contends that Article 5 of the Treaty constitutes a /ex specialis and, in

247

accordance with the maxim /ex specialis derogat legi generali,“*’ prevails over and

supplants other Treaty provisions invoked by Claimant in claiming for injury related to
military operations. In Respondent’s view, Article 5 thus renders the Treaty’s provisions
dealing with full and constant protection and security, fair and equitable treatment, and
expropriation inapplicable with respect to injury of the kind identified by Article 5(1) of
the Treaty.”“* Thus, in Respondent’s view, “any alleged losses relating to harm suffered by

Claimant at the hands of Libyan armed forces during the 2011 Revolution should be

examined exclusively under Article 5 of the Treaty.”?4?

222. In support of its position, Respondent refers to Venezuela Holdings and others v.

250

Venezuela~® and ConocoPhillips and others v. Venezuela,?' both of which held that a

treaty article dealing specifically with fiscal measures excluded the operation of a second
provision requiring fair and equitable treatment, as to matters covered by the tax article.?>
Respondent argues further that the maxim /ex specialis derogat legi generali is a
supplementary rule of treaty interpretation that should be applied, citing Aust’s Modern

Treaty Law and Practice.?*>

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 82 of 337

Claimant disputes Respondent’s contention, maintaining that it is incorrect and
oversimplifies the principle reflected in /ex specialis derogat legi generali.?** In Claimant’s
view, Article 5(2) of the Treaty sets the standard of compensation for the damages it covers,
and can operate consistently with other provisions of the Treaty. Citing the work of the
International Law Commission, Claimant maintains that such a clause in a treaty does not
preclude claims for injury involving other treaty provisions.?°> Claimant adds that Article
5(2) of the Treaty covers only a narrow range of circumstances: property destroyed by

Respondent’s armed forces where the destruction was not required by military necessity.

(3) The Tribunal’s Analysis and Decision Regarding Lex Specialis

The Tribunal finds that Article 5 does not have the preclusive effect urged by Respondent.
Article 31(1) of the VCLT directs that “[a] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in
accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context
and in the light of its object and purpose.” Nothing in the language of Article 5(2) or in
other provisions of the Treaty indicates that it operates in the limiting manner urged by

Respondent.

In this regard, the Tribunal does not accept the contention that /ex specialis derogat legi
generali operates as a supplementary rule of interpretation capable of altering the ordinary
meaning of the words of Article 5(2). Article 32 of the VCLT gives a limited and precisely
defined role to supplementary means of interpretation. They can confirm a meaning that is
clear from the text (which presumably is not Respondent’s position here) or they can be
considered if plain meaning leaves a text “ambiguous or obscure” or “[I]eads to a result
which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.” Respondent has not shown how these
conditions exist here, and they do not. Moreover, as Professor Aust observes, such maxims
“need to be used with special care. They are no more than aids to interpretation, and might

well produce the wrong results if followed slavishly.”7*°

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 83 of 337

The Tribunal does not find that the cases cited by Respondent provide persuasive support
for its interpretation. In ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela, the tribunal’s careful parsing of the
relevant treaty language led it to conclude that a provision involving general obligations
and a second provision dealing with taxation could not simultaneously operate without
generating unacceptable results or rendering the tax provision largely devoid of effect.?*”
The tribunal in Venezuela Holdings v. Venezuela similarly found that these two provisions
could not both apply without rendering portions of the tax article meaningless and
duplicating other provisions.?** Thus, the same treaty text was found by both tribunals to
contain persuasive indications that the tax article created a separate regime that conflicted
with, and therefore operated instead of, the more general treaty regime. Respondent has
not shown that Article 5 has corresponding characteristics. In the Tribunal’s view, it does

not.

Finally, in considering the plain meaning of the text, the Tribunal recalls that in
international treaty practice, States that intend certain provisions to have limited effect or
operate to the exclusion of other provisions have the means to make this clear.?°? Had the
treaty Parties intended Article 5 to operate to the exclusion of other provisions, they could

have said so. They did not.

Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that Article 5 of the Treaty does not preclude the possibility
of claims based on other provisions of the treaty with respect to the matters that also fall

under Article 5 of the Treaty.

ARTICLE 3(1) — FAILURE TO PROVIDE FULL AND CONSTANT PROTECTION AND
SECURITY

Article 3(1) of the Treaty requires each Contracting Party to accord to investments by
investors of the other “full and constant protection and security.” Claimant contends that

Respondent failed to meet this obligation in multiple respects.

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 84 of 337

qd) The Parties’ Positions

The Parties disagree regarding the standard of conduct required under this provision. As
expressed in Claimant’s Memorial, “[t]he obligation to provide full and constant protection
and security in accordance with this provision obliges a State to provide physical protection
and security to an investment in its territory which was made by an investor of the other
contracting party.”?6° The State must exercise due diligence to this end.7¢!

Claimant denies that a State’s obligation to accord security depends upon the resources
available to it, instead maintaining that the due diligence standard “is nothing more nor less
than the reasonable measures of prevention which a well-administered government could

Fi vat : 99262
be expected to exercise under similar circumstances.””®

Citing multiple authorities,
Claimant concludes, in the words of Professors Dolzer and Schreuer, that “[I]ack of

resources to take appropriate action will not serve as an excuse for the host state.”

For its part, Respondent contends that international law affords the State “a particularly

264 and that a “State will

wide measure of deference” in relation to the duty of protection,
only breach its obligations if ‘what was done shows such a degree of negligence, defective
administration of justice or bad faith, that the procedure falls below the standards of

international law’.”?°> Respondent makes particular reference to the award in Pantechniki

and security in a situation of social tumult and lawlessness in a remote area.”°” Respondent

observes in this regard:

The situation in Libya, in terms of the gravity and the extent of the
civil war, was equally bad and perhaps far worse than the situation
of the civil unrest in Pantechniki. If the Pantechniki tribunal found
the civil disturbance in that case to be so out of control and so severe
that the State could not be held liable for breach of [full protection
and security], then, a fortiori, given the circumstances in this case,
the Tribunal should dismiss Claimant’s allegations of breach of [full
protection and security].7°

233. Respondent concludes:

Although the [National Transitional Council] proclaimed itself as
the legitimate government of Libya on October 23, 2011, the
situation in Libya remained unstable. Various armed groups
claiming to be the legitimate government exercised control over
different areas of the country since 2011. In such a situation, it was
impossible for the Libyan authorities to guarantee full protection
and security, as they would normally do in peacetime. The
internationally recognized government has not been in continuous
direct control of much of the territory where the property in question
was located, such as the areas of Tweisha and Tajura.76°

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis and Decision

234. In assessing the Parties’ competing views, the Tribunal believes that the duty of due
diligence cannot be viewed in the abstract and in isolation from the conditions prevailing
in Libya during 2011 and for much of the time since. Respondent’s obligation under the
Treaty to accord constant protection exists in a setting of weak and uncertain State
authority, recurring armed conflict, and widespread breakdown of the law in wide areas of

the country. The reality of these circumstances cannot be ignored in assessing

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 86 of 337

Respondent’s obligations. As the Ampal v. Egypt tribunal concluded with respect to a

troubled security situation in an adjoining country:

[T]he duty imposed upon the host State by [the standard of full

protection and security] is not one of strict liability. Rather the State

is obliged to exert due diligence in order to protect a claimant’s

investment a standard that must be assessed according to the

particular circumstances in which the damage occurs.?”°
As Dolzer and Schreuer maintain, the standard of liability under the full protection and
security standard requires a host State “to take such measures to protect the foreign

investment as are reasonable in the circumstances.”?”!

In light of both Parties’ extensive evidence showing circumstances of widespread conflict,
violence and disorder in Libya at relevant times, the Tribunal is compelled to agree with
the thrust of Respondent’s assessment: In the circumstances prevailing in Libya during and
since the Revolution, it was not reasonably possible for the Libyan authorities to take

272

consistent and effective measures to protect Claimant’s investment.”"~ The Tribunal has
accordingly assessed Claimant’s claims of failure to accord full protection and security in
light of what both Parties’ evidence shows regarding the security situation existing at the

relevant place and time.

ARTICLE 8(1) — THE UMBRELLA CLAUSE

Claimant advances substantial claims on the basis of Article 8(1) of the Treaty, the
umbrella clause. Interpretation and application of this provision are discussed supra, in

connection with Respondent’s objections to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

CLAIMANT’S OTHER TREATY CLAIMS

Claimant also asserts that Respondent’s conduct violated Article 3(1) of the Treaty,
requiring fair and equitable treatment; Article 3(2) of the Treaty, precluding impairment of
investors’ “management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, sale and liquidation” of

an investment; and Article 4 of the Treaty, barring indirect expropriation.

These claims drew much less attention by the Parties in their written and oral submissions
and involve the same conduct and facts as the Tribunal considers in connection with
Claimant’s other claims under the Treaty dealing with full protection under Article 3,
compensation for losses under Article 5, and other obligations under Article 8. The
Tribunal finds that they overlap or duplicate claims more fully developed by the Parties
under these other provisions of the Treaty, without adding clarity to the case or providing

bases for additional relief.

As other tribunals have observed, considerations of economy _ both jurisprudential and
financial may lead a tribunal to conclude it need not consider in detail issues that are
duplicative and do not contribute to a full and proper decision, or that would not alter a

Pr 2 a
decision reached on other grounds.?”* This is such a case.

The Tribunal has been guided by these considerations in assessing Claimant’s additional
claims under Articles 3(1), 3(2) and (4) of the Treaty. The Tribunal has taken these claims
into account, but does not assess that they alter the outcome or the quantum of

compensation to be awarded to Claimant.

CURRENCY IN WHICH THIS AWARD IS DENOMINATED - EXCHANGE
RATE

Originally, Al Hani’s claims were submitted to its employers in Libyan Dinars (“LYD”).
However, during the course of the present treaty-based arbitration, in their pleadings and
evidence both Parties and their respective quantification experts have interchangeably
valued the investor’s claims in LYD, Euros, or both currencies. Neither Party has raised
objections to this method, and conversion from LYD to Euros has become a practice widely
utilized by both Parties in their pleadings. This was also a practice shared by experts and

witnesses at the Hearing. The Tribunal finds this justified in the circumstances of the case.

The Tribunal accordingly denominates each of its quantum determinations and the

resulting Award in Euros.

This raises the issue of the exchange rate or rates to be applied in assessing a multitude
of transactions under multiple contracts over multiple years. The Tribunal notes that both
FTI (Claimant’s quantification expert) and Blackrock (Respondent’s quantification expert)
have used very similar, if not the same rates of exchange for purposes of developing the
Euro-denominated figures and “figures-as-figures” comparisons presented to the Tribunal
at the Hearing. The Tribunal accepts this as an appropriate and reasonable approach, and

has been guided by the evidence presented by the Parties’ respective experts in this regard.

CLAIMANT’S SPECIFIC CLAIMS FOR LOSS AND INJURY

Claimant presented a complex multi-part damages claim, with numerous separate sub-
claims for loss of or damage to particular assets, various forms of nonpayment under
various contracts, and for other injuries for which Respondent is said to be liable. For
purposes of its analysis of these claims, Claimant’s quantification experts from FTI
grouped them into twelve categories. Respondent’s experts from Blackrock utilized these
same categories in their responses, an approach that the Tribunal has found to greatly assist
its work. The Tribunal will utilize these categories, which have been accepted by both
Parties’ experts, as the framework for its analysis. The categories, as numbered by both

Parties’ experts, are:

6.4 Financial charges.

The four elements of Claim | (items I.a — |.d) are related to Article 5 of the Treaty,
addressing “Compensation for Losses” in times of armed conflict, emergency and the like.
Claim 2 is primarily related to Respondent’s obligation to provide “full and constant
protection and security” under Article 3(1) of the Treaty. Claims 3, 4 and 5 are based on
the provisions of Al Hani’s contracts, and relate to Article 8’s umbrella clause. Claims 6.1-
6.4 involve losses said to stem from the period of disorder and conflict in 2011. These are
again based on provisions in Al Hani’s contracts dealing with allocation of risk in times of

disturbance.

Contracting Party, as regards restitution, indemnification,
compensation or any other settlement, treatment no less
favourable than that which it accords to its own investors or to
investors of any third state, whichever is most favourable to the
investor.

(2) An investor of a Contracting Party who in any of the events
referred to in paragraph (1) suffers loss resulting from:

(a) requisitioning of its investment or part thereof by the forces
or authorities of the other Contracting Party, or

(b) destruction of its investment or part thereof by the forces or

authorities of the other Contracting Party, which was not

required by the necessity of the situation, shall in any case

be accorded by the latter Contracting Party restitution or

compensation which in either case shall be prompt, adequate

and effective and, with respect to compensation, shall be in

accordance with Article 4(2) and (3).

248. Articles 4(2) and 4(3) of the Treaty then specify the requirements for compensation in cases
of expropriation, requiring that such compensation shall reflect fair market value, be paid

without delay, and include interest at a commercial rate.

qd) Claimant’s Position

249. Claimant points to a substantial body of evidence showing that numerous vehicles,
generators, fuel tanks and other valuable Al Hani equipment was requisitioned by
personnel of Libya’s 32™ Reinforced Brigade, an elite security unit commanded by Col.
Gaddafi’s youngest son, Khamis Gaddafi. At the Hearing, Claimant’s valuation experts
from FTI assessed the value of Al Hani’s property that was requisitioned and not recovered

to be €6,134,891.?%4

While Al Hani’s expatriate personnel left the country in March 2011, locally engaged staff
remained. They frequently recorded serial numbers and other identifying information on
trucks and other major equipment being removed by Libyan Government forces. They also
secured multiple documents signed by officers of the 32" Brigade evidencing requisitions
on particular dates. Claimant also submitted reports of Interior Ministry personnel who
were engaged by Al Hani to provide perimeter security but were not able to prevent officers

and personnel of the 32" Brigade from removing Al Hani’s property.

Claimant introduced 30 documents signed by 32" Brigade officers evidencing the
requisition of numerous vehicles, generators, and other equipment.?” In addition, a
December 2011 letter to Al Hani from Libya’s Ministry of the Interior/Security Board of
Utilities and Facilities (which provided security guards for Al Hani’s Tweisha yard under
contract with Al Hani) describes incidents involving equipment being removed from the
yard by 32" Brigade personnel over the objections of the security guards. The letter
records, inter alia, that “our members tried to prevent the armed forces getting the
equipment out, but under the threat of weapons they have seized some equipment,” that
“the seizure of the equipment, Tires, Tanks and other articles has been repeated,” and that
“a group of soldiers from Brigade no. 32 leaded [sic] by Captain Mohamed Yousif stayed
and accommodated at the Mob. Area and they were seizing equipment and material

daily."27°

Reports from the local branch of the “General People’s Committee for Public Security/
Facility and Establishment Security Authority” responsible for security at the Tweisha site

also describing requisitions of equipment?”

add further detail. An 11 April 2011 telegram
reports on two visits to the Tweisha site by Major Elkhairiat and soldiers from the 32"

Reinforced Brigade during which they “withdrew” numerous Al Hani vehicles. The report

at Tweisha dated 26 July 2011 reports additional equipment removed by soldiers of the
32™ Reinforced Brigade, this time including several generators, fuel tanks, and two

Mitsubishi Fuso Canters.?”?

Al Hani’s Libyan Procurement and Logistics Manager remained at the Tweisha site after
the Strabag expatriates left. His witness statement describes multiple visits by 32 Brigade
soldiers to take vehicles and equipment and the efforts of Al Hani staff to get Brigade
officers to sign and stamp reports identifying equipment being removed: “[B]y the end of
July or the start of August, the 32" Reinforced Brigade had taken everything they wanted

from the site.”?8°

Although communications between Al Hani’s local personnel and expatriate personnel in
Europe were difficult, local personnel were able to pass much information to Strabag
personnel regarding lost and stolen equipment. A report prepared for a July 2011 Strabag
management meeting based on reports from Strabag’s on-site staff refers to multiple
removals of equipment from Al Hani sites by Libyan Army personnel. The document lists
equipment known to be lost or stolen as of that time, including 24 trucks, 31 prime movers,

6 buses, and 31 Toyota pickups.?*!

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 93 of 337

Claimant contends that Respondent’s arguments disputing its evidence of requisitions were

282

either wrong, or involved formalistic nitpicking.” Claimant also noted that Respondent

does not address the additional evidence showing the occurrence and extent of requisitions.

(2) Respondent’s Position

Respondent’s defense to this claim primarily involves attacks on the credibility of the
documents said to have been signed by 32™ Brigade officers and to show requisitions.
Respondent denies the probative value of these documents, disputing the authority or
identity of purported signers, the lack of official seals, and otherwise questioning the

weight to be given to them.”*? Respondent thus argues, for example:

Valid requisitioning reports of Brigade 32 should be on the brigade’s
official form, signed and stamped by an authorized officer, and
contain the identification number of the requisitioning officer.
However, only one of the twenty requisitioning reports introduced
by Claimant is on the official form; even this report does not have
an official stamp or the identification number of the officer who
allegedly signed it.

(3) The Tribunal’s Analysis and Decision

The Tribunal finds that the evidence submitted by Claimant in support of this claim is
credible and sufficient to show that a significant amount of Al Hani’s property was lost to
requisition by regular Libyan armed forced during the events of 2011. The evidence
regarding the value of the requisitioned equipment is also detailed and is largely accepted

by both Parties’ valuation experts.

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 94 of 337

The starting point for assessing the extent of loss is an Excel spreadsheet constructed by
Al Hani’s equipment manager, Mr. Penkhues, prior to the Revolution. This spreadsheet
was prepared in the ordinary course of business for readily apparent business reasons. It
contained a detailed listing of all of Al Hani’s plant, machinery, and equipment in Libya,
including information such as serial numbers, acquisition and transportation costs, and
depreciation.?*> Following the Revolution, Mr. Penkhues returned to Libya to inventory Al
Hani’s assets. He then updated the spreadsheet to reflect equipment remaining on hand or

that was recovered by Al Hani personnel.

Respondent’s Post-Hearing Brief contends that the Penkhues spreadsheet is based on
uncorroborated hearsay evidence and cannot be relied upon.*° The Tribunal is not
persuaded. The spreadsheet was prepared by a knowledgeable and experienced senior staff
member, in the ordinary course of business, for purposes of determining Al Hani’s position
in the aftermath of the Revolution. The Tribunal accepts it as a proper basis for assessing
the value of Al Hani’s property that was requisitioned and not recovered. The Tribunal
notes in this regard that Respondent’s quantification expert, Mr. Osbaldeston, accepted that

he had no reason to question the accuracy of Mr. Penkhues’s inventory.7°”

Proceeding from Mr. Penkhues’s spreadsheet, Claimant’s quantification experts from FTI
assessed the net book value of 119 items of equipment requisitioned and not subsequently
recovered, adjusted for depreciation and inflation, to be €6,134,891 (as updated at the

Hearing).?**

In his Second Report, Mr. Osbaldeston of Blackrock assesses the value of the requisitioned
property to be €5,791,932. Blackrock’s assessment is thus €342,959 below FTI’s final
figure.?®° Thus, the conclusions of the two Parties’ valuation experts are substantially

similar.

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 95 of 337

However, there is also force in Claimant’s argument that Respondent’s lower number is
not justified. The difference between the two largely reflects Blackrock’s assessment of a
lower depreciated net book value. Mr. Osbaldeston’s Second Report was not entirely clear
to the Tribunal in this respect, but Claimant’s Post-Hearing Brief attributes the difference
between the experts to the fact that Mr. Osbaldeston did not account for all “costs directly
attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable
of operating in the manner intended by management as required by International

Accounting Standard 16.”?°°

Considering all above arguments and counterarguments and balancing the available
evidence, the Tribunal awards the value of requisitioned equipment as assessed by
Blackrock, plus approximately half of the difference between Blackrock’s and FTI’s
assessments. The Tribunal accordingly concludes that, under the present head of claim
under Article 5(2)(a) of the Treaty for uncompensated requisitioning, Respondent owes

€5,963,000.

CLAIM 1.B. EQUIPMENT DESTROYED / LosT IN 2011

The previous section addressed Claimant’s claim for property requisitioned by

Respondent’s armed forces. Claimant also seeks significant sums for other assets that it

91

contends were “taken or destroyed for reasons attributable to Libya”??' on the basis of

292

Article 5(2)(b) of the Treaty as quoted in paragraph 247.

This Article of the Treaty provides that an investor who suffers losses due to events such

as those that occurred in Libya in 2011 involving:

(2)(b) destruction of its investment or part thereof by the forces or
authorities of the other Contracting Party, which was not
required by the necessity of the situation, shall in any case be
accorded by the latter Contracting Party restitution or
compensation which in either case shall be prompt, adequate and

effective and, with respect to compensation, shall be in
accordance with Article 4 (2) and (3).

ql) Claimant’s Position

266. Claimant’s Memorial summarizes this claim:

292. Article 5(2)(b) is ... applicable in this case ... during the
disturbances and violence of 2011, not only did the
Respondent’s armed forces requisition property belonging to
Al Hani (some of which is recorded in contemporaneous
records), but Libyan armed forces also damaged and
destroyed property which constituted part of Strabag’s
investment in Libya.

293. Article 5(2)(b), unlike Article 5(2)(a), contains a
qualification that the provision applies to destruction of an
investment “which was not required by the necessity of the
situation.” The Claimant submits that the facts and
circumstances of the destruction and damage to Al Hani’s
property by the Respondent’s armed forces (including acts
of vandalism and intentional damage inflicted by the armed
forces when they abandoned the Al Hani sites) are such that
the Respondent cannot credibly maintain that such
destruction and damage was required by the necessity of the

situation.?°>

267. Claimant seeks €10,560,869, primarily for lost vehicles and other portable property.
Claimant’s quantum experts’ reports do not address whether Respondent’s forces were in
fact responsible for particular damage. FTI’s First Report makes clear that their role was
limited to assessing the fair market value of assets “which, we are instructed were
requisitioned by the Libyan military forces, or otherwise taken or destroyed for reasons

attributable to Libya, in 2011.”?%

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 97 of 337

Mr. Osbaldeston of Blackrock largely accepts Claimant’s assessment of the value of this
lost or damaged property, but again does not address the issue of causation. Blackrock finds
that the value of the lost or destroyed property is €10,291,610, a difference of €262,959
from the total found by FTI. While this is not an inconsequential amount, the difference

between the two sets of experts arises in the context of a claim for more than €10.5 million.

(2) Respondent’s Position

Claimant presents evidence in support of this claim, but — not surprisingly, given the nature
of the events involved this does not include eyewitness evidence of the circumstances
resulting in particular loss or damage. Respondent does not offer evidence addressing
specific locations or events in rebuttal, arguing instead that Claimant failed to meet its
burden of proof. In its Post-Hearing Brief, Respondent expands its argument to contend
that it has shown that Libya’s forces did not cause any of the damage and that it was all

caused by NATO, looters, Al Hani employees, or other actors.2%>

(3) The Tribunal’s Analysis and Decision

A claimant can recover under Article 5(2)(b) of the Treaty only for losses from “destruction
of its investment or part thereof by the forces or authorities of the other Contracting Party,
which was not required by the necessity of the situation.” Thus, two conditions must be
met. First, the claimant must demonstrate that its property was destroyed “by the forces or
authorities” of the respondent State. Second, it must be shown that such destruction “was
not required by the necessity of the situation.” Article 5(2)(b) of the Treaty thus presents
the challenge of establishing responsibility for wartime damage by forces of the State party

to the investor’s property in violent and often chaotic circumstances.

2°5 Resp. PHB 140. The Tribunal does not accept Respondent’s statement. The passages cited in the Post-Hearing
Brief to support it do not establish that Libyan armed forces caused no damage. To the contrary, the evidence shows
that there was damage attributable to Libya’s forces.

86

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 98 of 337

271. It is Claimant’s burden to establish sufficiently the basis of its claim for compensation.
Claimant’s starting point in this regard is again the evidence of Mr. Penkhues and his
spreadsheet. In the spreadsheet, Mr. Penkhues allocated various types of property loss and
damage to various causes. In his First Witness Statement, Mr. Penkhues explains that he

created categories on the final version of his spreadsheet for:

“[Mlilitary force”, where it was apparent that the asset had been
destroyed or damaged by the military during the conflict in 2011;
[and] (c) “other”, where the asset was either stolen, destroyed or
damaged during the course of 2011, including during the period
when the sites were occupied by the military or when the military
abandoned the sites.?%

272. Mr. Penkhues’s First Witness Statement explains how he assigned particular lost or
damaged property to particular classifications. He states that in doing so “I relied on the
updates received from our Libyan colleagues during the revolution and my site

inspections.”?°” The spreadsheet thus does not reflect first-hand knowledge on his part.

273. Mr. Penkhues’s statement then describes relevant categories that he used in a refined

version of the spreadsheet:

c. “Stolen”: Some of our machinery and equipment had gone
missing at the time the military had occupied our sites or
sometime after the soldiers had left. If 1 did not have a requisition
report from Mr. Kadri or one of our other employees, | listed the
item as “stolen”.

d. “Military force”: If it was clear that the item in question had been
damaged during fighting (for example, it had bullet holes in it or
had been damaged by tanks), I included “military force” in this
column.

e. “Vandalism”: Some of equipment and machinery was also
vandalised. Sometimes the graffiti was the name of the unit that
had occupied our sites, so it was obvious that this had been done
by soldiers.

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 99 of 337

While they may have been appropriate for the purposes for which they were created, Mr.
Penkhues’s categories provide limited assistance regarding the threshold question of
Respondent’s responsibility under Article 5(2) of the Treaty. The spreadsheet does not
separately identify damage attributable to Respondent’s “forces or authorities,” as opposed
to e.g. rebels, NATO air strikes, or other causes. Claimant’s valuation experts from FTI
analyze and generally endorse the valuations Mr. Penkhues places on lost or damaged
equipment, but their reports do not address this key question of the likely cause of particular

damage.?%

A second source of evidence regarding the cause of particular damage is a report prepared
for the projects’ insurers by Mr. Adouni, a loss surveyor from the Tunisian branch of
Sadaoui Surveyors Group.?* This report (the “Sadaoui Report”) was issued in June
2012.° In preparing his report, Mr. Adouni, who was accompanied by Mr. Penkhues,
visited Al Hani’s facilities and camps at multiple locations in Libya and physically
inspected and photographed the sites visited. His assessments of the monetary value of lost

and damaged property are in line with Mr. Penkhues’s.

Respondent’s Post-Hearing Brief dismisses the Sadaoui Report as “unreliable.”°°! The
Tribunal does not agree. The Report’s analysis and photographs provide relevant evidence
bearing on Claimant’s losses relevant to this claim. The Report was prepared by a
credentialed and apparently thorough and experienced loss surveyor, working for an

302

established surveyors firm,°*’* and acting on behalf of major insurers with an interest in a

reliable assessment of Al Hani’s damages. It thus offers an objective outsider’s assessment.

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 100 of 337

Mr. Adouni’s descriptions of what he saw and learned indicate the frequent difficulty of
establishing responsibility for particular loss of or damage to Al Hani’s property. In some
instances, damage to property cannot clearly be linked to Government forces. For example,
at the Ras al Afa Quarry site southwest of Tripoli, the Report observes that “the site was
left without security guards, therefore it was exposed to the attacks of the armed robbers

[w]ho thieved the portable tools and equipment and damaged the heavy machineries.” °°

However, at three of Al Hani’s major sites, the Sadaoui Report describes damage to

equipment that Mr. Adouni connected to the presence and actions of government troops.

A, Equipment Damage and Losses at the Tweisha Site

The Tweisha site, in the vicinity of Tripoli’s international airport, was Al Hani’s main
mobilization area, workshop, office, and warehouse. Many vehicles and a large amount of
other equipment was assembled there in February 2011; the Sadaoui Report includes
photographs taken on 21 February 2011 showing numerous buses, heavy trucks, and other

pieces of heavy construction equipment at the site.

The Report cites multiple causes of damage to Respondent’s equipment at the Tweisha site,
including requisitions by military forces and post-Revolutionary looting by unidentified
“armed people.” However, it also cites other damage inflicted by military forces of
Respondent in circumstances not involving combat, and therefore not posing the question

of military necessity. According to the Report:

[W]e can attribute the damages and losses affecting the [Tweisha]
site and its equipment to the following causes:

281.

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 101 of 337

The occupation of the site by the military troop “Reinforced Brigade
32” belonging to Gaddafi regime, starting from the mid of April
2011 till the beginning of September 2011. According to the Annex
VI (last paragraph), the military troop seized and used the equipment
of the site either against or without receipts on daily basis.

The fierce exploitation of the site including equipment, offices and
camps by the military troop during the war period (about 5 months)
which resulted in the damage of the equipment and site furniture.*°*

B. Equipment Damage and Losses at the Tajura Site

The Sadaoui Report again identifies damage from multiple causes at Al Hani’s Tajura site
east of Tripoli, the location of Al Hani’s largest infrastructure project, where there was
significant damage caused by actors other than Government forces. The Report thus
records that on 21-23 February 2011, the Tajura facilities “were looted by rioters and
robbers, benefitting from the disturbance and perturbation which affected the regime at the

beginning of unrests.”°5

These events were described at the Hearing by Mr. Knaack, who
was present at the time of these events and confirmed that the individuals he saw entering

and looting the camp were civilians.*°°

Other damage at the Tajura site was attributed to NATO bombing, presumably directed at
a nearby military camp. The Sadaoui Report identifies “[b]reaking of glasses caused by
NATO bombs splinters” and “[dJamages of asphalt plant caused by bomb splinters.”
Neither the looting and burning of the Tajura camp, or damage due to NATO bombing can

be attributed to Respondent under Article 5(2) of the Treaty.

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 102 of 337

However, the Sadaoui Report also identifies other damage to Al Hani’s equipment from
the presence of military forces supporting the regime. Government forces occupied Al
Hani’s facilities for several months beginning in April 2011.5°7 According to the Report,
this resulted in “[d]amages of equipment caused by the fierce and unskilled exploitation of
military troop; such damages were ascertained on the heavy equipment (bulldozers, trucks,
forklifts ...) and light equipment and furniture like cars, spare parts, generators, tires,

computers and air-conditioners ...”7°*

C. Equipment Damage and Losses at the Tawarga (Misurata) Mobilization
Area
The Misurata area was the scene of intense fighting between Government and rebel forces
and of NATO air attacks on Government forces. These events resulted in damage at Al
Hani’s mobilization site at Tawarga, which supported the Misurata Road project. The
Sadaoui Report states that Government forces occupied Al Hani’s site “because of its
strategic location” and its “logistics facilities supply.” The Sadaoui Report continues that
“during the war, this site was a target to the NATO bombardment and to rebels attacks.”

As to the “[c]auses of damages and losses,” it concludes:

According to our inspection, we evidenced that the damages which

affected the site were essentially caused by NATO bombardment

and rebels attacks. The exploded work shop, containers, camps,

vehicles, asphalt tanks, asphalt plant and the bullets and their holes

all over the site affirming the warriors attacks. *°?
Claimant’s Reply acknowledges that Al Hani’s property at Tajura and the
Tawarga/Misurata sites was damaged by NATO bombardment. Claimant maintains,
however, that “the relevant point is that the Libyan armed forces had first occupied, and
expropriated, this site following which Al Hani’s site would have become a legitimate
military target.”>!° Claimant’s characterization of the site as a legitimate military target

seems appropriate, but it does not assist Claimant’s claim under Article 5(2) of the Treaty.

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 103 of 337

In light of the Sadaoui Report, the Tawarga site’s location in an area of heavy fighting
between rebel and Government forces, and the presence of NATO aerial bombardment, the
Tribunal has no basis to attribute any of the damage there to the actions of Government
forces, as opposed to rebel or NATO forces, or to conclude that any damage was not

occasioned by military necessity.

286. Additional evidence in the record indicates Government forces’ responsibility for some of
the loss of or damage to Al Hani’s property. This evidence appears reliable, as it reflects
information contemporaneously gathered by responsible Al Hani employees in the course

of business and not in anticipation of litigation. For example:
- Mr. Napowanez states that

[a]lthough there were frequent communication difficulties between
March and September 2011, our staff managed to provide us with
updates as to what was happening on the ground in Libya. For
example, they informed us that some of our sites were occupied by
Libyan armed forces and that Libyan soldiers confiscated vehicles
and other property from the sites.>!!

- Mr. Penkhues states that

Mr. Kadri had reported to us that the Tweisha camp and office had
been taken over by the Libyan military and that the military had on
several occasions confiscated several pieces of machinery.>'?

- Mr. Penkhues states further that after leaving Libya in February 2011, he

received updates from time to time on the situation from our
employees on the ground ...When [these employees] first called to
tell us that the military had come to take away our equipment, we
did not know what to do. We realised quickly that we needed some
record of what was being confiscated by the military, so when the
military came again, [our employees] prepared lists of the
equipment that was taken away and, if possible, got a member of the

time, | also received updates by phone from [our employees], who

-  Ane-mail to Mr. Penkhues from an employee in Libya in April 2011 lists tires “taken

As noted supra, the Parties’ experts are substantially in agreement regarding the total value
of Al Hani’s equipment lost during the Revolution. However, as Respondent contends, and
as the Sadaoui Report confirms, responsibility for particular damage is often not clear. In
the chaotic conditions of the Revolution, Al Hani’s vehicles and equipment were taken,
destroyed, or damaged by multiple actors. Losses sometimes involved Government forces
in non-combat situations in circumstances that fell under Article 5(2) of the Treaty, but

there were also losses attributable to looters, rebels, and NATO bombing.

Respondent advances two principal lines of argument in light of this situation. Respondent

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 105 of 337

This argument does not prevail. The Tribunal finds that there is sufficient evidence that
some of Al Hani’s vehicles and equipment were damaged or destroyed by Government
forces in circumstances not involving combat, so that the issue of military necessity does
not arise. The difficulty lies in determining how much of the claimed damage is attributable
to Government forces, as opposed to rebels, looters, NATO bombing, or other possible

causes.

At the Hearing and in its Post-Hearing Brief, Respondent developed a further argument to
the effect that, correctly analyzed, the data assembled by Mr. Penkhues shows that the
amount of loss and damage attributable to Government forces is appreciably less than the
amount claimed, and involves only 113 pieces of equipment with a value of LYD5.223
million.*'® Respondent arrived at this conclusion by applying filters to Mr. Penkhues’s data

that Respondent understands to identify the equipment damaged by Government forces.

In its Post-Hearing Brief, Claimant disputes Respondent’s choices of filters to exclude
large amounts of lost or damaged equipment, objecting, inter alia, that Respondent “cannot
eliminate particular items, for example because items classified as ‘vandalised’ in the
inventory lacked ‘bullet holes,’ or because items classified as damaged by ‘Military Force’

319

did not indicate the party exercising military force.

The Tribunal thus faces a difficulty. Claimant has established to a sufficient degree that a
substantial amount of Al Hani’s equipment was destroyed or damaged by the actions of
Libya’s armed forces. This included, not least, equipment that was damaged or destroyed
by soldiers of the 32" Brigade while its units occupied Al Hani’s facilities under conditions
not involving impending or actual combat and thus not raising the issue of military
necessity. However, the evidence also shows that much of Al Hani’s equipment was lost

to looters, disgruntled employees, rebels, and even NATO air bombardment.

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 106 of 337

Thus, whatever Respondent’s liability may be for property loss attributable to the regime’s
forces or authorities under Article 5(2) of the Treaty, it is necessarily less than the
€10,560,869 sought by Claimant for all of its lost equipment. The Tribunal also considers
the figure of LYD5.223 million introduced by Respondent very late in the proceedings,
based on its selective application of filters on Mr. Penkhues’s spreadsheet data, to be

unrealistically low.

Accordingly, the Tribunal must consider the principles of evidence applicable in this
situation. As a starting point, the Tribunal observes that under Article 41(1) of the ICSID
Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules, it “shall be the judge of the admissibility of any
evidence adduced and of its probative value.” In its 20 July 2018 letter to the Parties
following the Hearing, the Tribunal asked that they further address “[u]nder the applicable
law, what power does the Judge have to determine compensation if the evidence does not

admit of precise assessment?” In its Post-Hearing Brief, Claimant responds:

The Parties agree that the relevant law for the assessment of
compensation in this case is public international law, which clearly
provides the Tribunal with such power. Similarly, as a matter of
Libyan law (whether in the context of assessing compensation for
exceptional circumstances or more generally), the Supreme Court
has confirmed that “proving the occurrence of damage or its
nonexistence and assessing the compensation therefor is a factual
matter, that is at the discretion of the matter judge.”>”

Respondent’s Post-Hearing Brief offers a less detailed conclusion:

Pursuant to the Treaty and the Contracts, Claimant’s contractual
claims are subject to international law and Libyan law. Under both,
Claimant has the burden of proving the legal and factual bases for
its claims and the proper quantum of damages. Claimant has failed
to carry this burden (footnotes omitted).*?!

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 107 of 337

In the Tribunal’s view, in the circumstances in Libya in 2011, international law does not
require an accountant’s precision in determining damages. Instead, as the Crystallex v.

Venezuela tribunal observed:

[A]n impossibility or even a considerable difficulty that would make
it unconscionable to prove the amount (rather than the existence) of
damages with absolute precision does not bar their recovery
altogether. Arbitral tribunals have been prepared to award
compensation on the basis of a reasonable approximation of the loss,
where they felt confident about the fact of the loss itself. ??

In addition, in the Sapphire v. Iran award the tribunal held:

It is not necessary to prove the exact damage suffered in order to
award damages. On the contrary, when such proof [of exact damage]
is impossible, particularly as a result of the behaviour of the author
of the damage it is enough for the judge to be able to admit with
sufficient probability the existence and extent of the damage.*?

D. The Tribunal’s Decision

The Tribunal finds the derivation of Respondent’s figure of LYD5.22 million to be difficult
to understand. The evidence shows that Claimant has certainly incurred significant
damages covered by Article 5 of the Treaty. The Tribunal recalls, however, that at the time
of the 2011 events, the situation in Libya was chaotic, dangerous and unsettled. This is a
situation in which international law does not require precise proof of the quantum of the
loss, provided the occurrence and significance of the loss are established. Furthermore,
when the amount of damages is impossible to prove with precision, as reflected in the cases,
the predominantly accepted rule does not lead to a draconian rejection of the overall claim.
On the contrary, partial recovery can be allowed to the extent that a tribunal deems proper
and fair. The Tribunal observes in this regard that a portion of the loss at issue in this claim
was inflicted by rebel or NATO forces; another portion involved losses due to looting by

civilians and thefts by Al Hani’s own employees; and a third portion resulted from actions

by Libyan military personnel in non-combat situation. The Tribunal accordingly
determines that approximately one-third of the claimed losses are attributable to the actions
by State forces not involving military necessity, actions for which Respondent is liable
pursuant to Article 5(2)(b) of the Treaty. The Tribunal accordingly awards in respect of
this claim approximately one-third of the amount claimed (namely €10,560,869), i.e.

€3,520,000.

CLAIM L.c. EQUIPMENT DAMAGE REPAIR UNDER ARTICLE 5 OF THE TREATY

Claimant also seeks €1,705,750 pursuant to Article 5(2)(b) of the Treaty for the repair of
damage to assets for which Respondent is alleged to be responsible. The claim does not
reflect costs actually incurred. Instead, it reflects Mr. Penkhues’s estimate of what repairs

would cost if they were carried out. As explained in Claimant’s Memorial:

In respect of the assets which Mr. Penkhues recorded in his
inventory as damaged (i.e., which had some residual value), Mr.
Penkhues determined the cost of repair of these assets by reference
to the replacement parts and labour costs required to repair the items
in question. FTI have relied on Mr. Penkhues’s assessment of the
cost of repair of these items to calculate the value of the loss to Al
Hani caused by damage to these assets by the Respondent’s armed
forces or for which the Respondent is otherwise responsible at EUR
1,705,750 as of February 2011.74

Thus, Claimant does not connect these purported losses to actions by Libyan armed forces

or otherwise demonstrate Libya’s liability for them under the Treaty.

In his First Report, Respondent’s quantification expert Mr. Osbaldeston of Blackrock
points to the lack of clear evidence regarding the cause of this damage, and concludes that
he could not assess the quantum of this claim.” In their Second Report, FTI’s experts do

not address the attribution point, but do confirm that the claim is “based on the witness

statement of Mr. Penkhues and is not independently verified by FTI,” and that “the repairs

to the damaged equipment have not been made.”2”°

In his Second Report, Mr. Osbaldeston also notes that the repairs have not actually been
carried out, and raises a variety of other objections. He notes, inter alia, the risk of
duplication between this and other claims, notably Claimant’s large claim for equipment
removed from the Tweisha yard in 2014 (see infra Section VIII. E.); that the claim includes
€248,500 for repairs to an asphalt plant in Misurata that was sold; and the lack of any

substantiation for Mr. Penkhues’s estimates of repair costs.??”

qd) The Tribunal’s Decision

This is a claim exclusively based on Mr. Penkhues’s estimates of the cost of hypothetical
repairs that were never made, for damage that is not shown to be the responsibility of
Libya’s armed forces or for which Respondent would otherwise be responsible under

Article 5(2)(b) the Treaty.

Claim l.c., for equipment damage repair, is dismissed for failure to establish both proof of

loss and Respondent’s responsibility under the Treaty.

CLAIM 1.D. SITE FACILITIES AND MATERIALS DAMAGED

This claim is again based on Article 5(2)(b) of the Treaty and alleges damage to or
destruction of Al Hani’s construction sites, vehicles, equipment and material by Libyan

Government forces.

qd) The Parties’ Positions

As ultimately presented by Claimant’s quantification experts from FTI at the Hearing,
Claimant seeks €2,573,186 for such loss or damage for which Claimant alleges Respondent
bears responsibility. The largest component of the claim is €1,439,660 for lost materials
and spares, roughly 56% of the total. The second largest component is €924,097 for
replacement furniture and equipment (about 36%). Damage to buildings is claimed to be

€200,305 (roughly 8%).°28

Mr. Osbaldeston, Respondent’s quantification expert from Blackrock, assesses that
€1,697,343 of the claimed losses were sufficiently documented. The principal difference
(€875,843) involves Blackrock’s valuation of lost spares at Tweisha and the Ras Al Lafah

Quarry to be zero.*”? As explained by FTI at the Hearing, this difference:

[R]eally has to do with one major issue, and that is there’s some

Tweisha and quarry yards spares, mostly Tweisha; there’s spares

there where Mr. Obaldeston has zeroed that estimate out for those

spares, and the estimate carried by Al Hani at the time of 50 percent

of the estimated value was that difference of about — it's about EUR

826,000 of the total difference.

So, the Tribunal, of course, needs to assess whether the estimate

done by the Al Hani folks is more appropriate than Blackrock’s

assessment of zero.>*?
Putting to the side the experts’ disagreement regarding the value of missing spares, the
Tribunal notes a more fundamental difficulty. The evidence previously reviewed in
connection with Claimant’s Claim |.b for lost equipment shows that Al Hani lost
equipment to a variety of causes, not only Respondent’s armed forces. The same is true of
this claim. The evidence establishes that some of the claimed damage was caused by
Libyan armed forces in non-combat circumstances not posing issues of military necessity,
and so is entitled to compensation under the Treaty. The evidence also shows, however,

that damage was caused by other actors as well.

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 111 of 337

There clearly was relevant loss and damage caused by members of Libya’s armed forces
occupying Al Hani’s sites in non-combat situations. The Sadaoui Report describes such
loss and damage at the Tweisha site by members of Libya’s armed forces, particularly the
324 Reinforced Brigade. The Sadaoui Report observes that the Brigade’s troops occupied
the site “to protect themselves from the bombardment of NATO. The offices, living
containers, equipment and tools including the petrol tanks were used by the army, as well
as the whole site and the equipment were treated like a military base and as own properties
of the military armies.”**! In addition to the requisitions and takings of vehicles and
equipment addressed supra, the Report refers to “[t]he fierce exploitation of the site
including equipment, offices and camps by the military troop during the war period (about
5 months) which resulted in the damage of the equipment and site furniture.” The Report
cites “[d]amages of equipment caused by the fierce and unskilled exploitation of military
troop; such damages were ascertained on the heavy equipment (bulldozers, trucks,
forklifts ...) and light equipment and furniture like cars, spare parts, generators, tires,

computers and air-conditioners ...”?>?

However, the same report also attributes other property losses to other actors. It attributes
losses at the Ras Al Lafah quarry to a lack of security leading to “attacks of the armed
robbers,” not to actions by Respondent’s armed forces.*>? As to the Tweisha yard, the
Sadaoui Report observes that “[t]he absence of total security and the chaotic situation of
the area which reined after the defeat of the military troop (Reinforced Brigade 32) and the
arrival of the rebels groups led to the exposure of the site and its remaining equipment to
waves of vandalism by armed people, who stole all valuable equipment, tools, materials ...

311. The Report also indicates that some of the damage inflicted on Al Hani’s facilities occurred
late in the hostilities, as the 32" Reinforced Brigade abandoned the Tweisha site. It cites

in this regard:

- Intentional deterioration of the site and its equipment by the
military troop during their withdrawal; such deterioration had
been noticed on:

- Living camps, canteens and offices (damaging roofs, doors,
windows, sanitary tools and cold stores...)

- Tearing tires by using bayonets, and breaking doors and
windows of trucks.>35
312. Respondent contends that this last type of damage, and perhaps other types as well, were
justified as measures taken for reasons of military necessity, in order to deny use of Al

Hani’s facilities to rebel forces:

It is clear that during 2011, it was militarily necessary for the Libyan
army to destroy certain property to prevent it from falling into the
hands of its opponents. By the summer of 2011 ... rebel forces had
advanced on Tripoli through Tajura. In such circumstances, it was a
military necessity for the Libyan army to destroy equipment that
could fall into the hands of the rebels.>°°
313. Respondent advances no evidence in support of this claim of military necessity, instead
maintaining that it is Claimant’s burden under the Treaty to prove the negative, i.e., that
Respondent’s forces’ actions damaging Al Hani’s property were not compelled by military
necessity. In Respondent’s view, this is required by the ordinary meaning of the text of

Article 5(2)(b) of the Treaty, which it understands to require Claimant to prove that

destruction was not caused by “the necessity of the situation.”*>? Respondent cites in

support of this interpretation of the treaty the award in AAPL v. Sri Lanka.>*

Claimant responds that military necessity is an affirmative defense that must be proved by

339

the party asserting it, which it maintains Respondent fails to do.

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

In the circumstances of this case, the Tribunal need not decide whether Article 5(2)(b) of
the Treaty has the burden-allocating role that Respondent assigns to it, requiring Claimant
to show that damage to Al Hani’s premises was not due to military necessity. Claimant’s
evidence sufficiently establishes that Libyan armed forces caused some damage to Al
Hani’s property that was not the result of military necessity. Claimant alleges in this regard
that the damage to its premises and other property at the hands of the departing 32™ Brigade
was in the nature of unwarranted spoliation of civilian property vandalism, - and refers
in this regard to UN bodies’ finding of attacks against, and abuses of, civilians by
Respondent’s armed forces.*#* As discussed below, photographic evidence in the Sadaoui
Report submitted by Claimant lends support to Claimant’s contention in this regard.
Respondent advances no evidence in rebuttal. Given Claimant’s allegations and the
available evidence, the Tribunal believes it is not sufficient for Respondent to rest its

defense to this claim on Claimant’s claimed burden of proof.

The evidence regarding the extent of the damage inflicted by 32™ Brigade troops as they
occupied and then abandoned Al Hani’s facilities is limited. Neither Party is in a position
to provide additional evidence concerning these events. Claimant was not present at the
time. Military forces for which the Respondent is responsible under the BIT were present.
However, as Respondent also points out, those forces were loyal to the previous regime

and no longer exist.

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 114 of 337

Given this situation, the Tribunal has weighed the evidence available, in particular the
Sadaoui Report and its accompanying photographs. These include some photographs of
intentional damage to vehicles that might have been intended to deny them to approaching
rebels and thus might reflect military necessity.*“' Other photographs, however, show
damage to A] Hani facilities more indicative of vandalism or destruction driven by spite or
purely for the sake of destruction. Thus, a sequence of photographs of a living unit at
Tweisha shows punched-out panels and screens, wrecked beds and tables, and personal
belongings strewn on the floor of a living unit.*#? A similar sequence shows burned and
vandalized workers’ quarters at Tajura.*? Graffiti on walls records the presence of 32"
Brigade troops. Other photographs provide evidence of extensive looting, but this could

have happened either at the time the troops left or subsequently.*"4

Thus, some of these photographs indicate the possibility of damage inflicted to deny
incoming rebels the use of vehicles. Others show damage to premises and property
apparently inflicted for the purpose of inflicting damage and not to gain any military
advantage. The extent or monetary value of damage for either reason is not clear from the

photographs.

Respondent advances an alternative argument to the effect that if damage was inflicted by
Libya’s military forces, it resulted from unauthorized conduct by forces acting outside of
their orders, for which it was not responsible.*4> This argument fails. Inter alia,
Respondent, which contended that Al Hani’s facilities were deliberately damaged to deny
them to advancing rebels, offered no evidence for its alternative theory attributing damage
to actions of rogue soldiers. As a matter of international law, the International Law
Commission affirms that the responsibility of a State under Article 91 of Geneva Protocol

I — that the State “shall be responsible for all acts by persons forming part of its armed

forces” “clearly covers acts committed contrary to orders or instructions.”*#° Moreover,
the evidence shows that the 32" Reinforced Brigade was an elite regular force that acted

under the chain of command.*47

(3) The Tribunal’s Decision

As with Claimant’s other claims for loss of property during the Revolution, the evidence
shows that there was some damage to Al Hani’s property and facilities for which there is a
right to compensation under Article 5(2)(b) of the Treaty. The evidence also shows,
however, that during this period, Al Hani’s property and facilities were also damaged or
looted by others including rebels, NATO, looters, and Al Hani’s own employees.
Respondent is not responsible under Article 5 of the Treaty for damage from these other

causes.

The Tribunal is therefore again left to make its best assessment of how much damage is
attributable to actions by Libya’s armed forces, in particular, soldiers of the 32™ Reinforced
Brigade, in conditions not potentially implicating military necessity. In doing so, it is again
guided by the principles applied in the previous claim for equipment lost/destroyed in 2011,
recognizing that some compensation is due, but that the evidence does not allow of precise
determination. Based on the Sadaoui Report, especially the detailed chronology of events
from page I 1 onwards, the Tribunal determines that approximately one-third of the damage
is attributable to Libyan State forces for purposes of liability under Article 5(2)(b) with a
reasonable degree of certainty. Consequently, the damages for which Libya is liable

amount to €858,000, approximately one-third of the €2,573,186 claimed.

CLAIM 2. EQUIPMENT REMOVED FROM TWEISHA IN 2014
Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the Treaty, Claimant seeks compensation for a large amount of
Al Hani’s vehicles and heavy equipment removed from the Tweisha yard by unidentified

persons at some time after October 2013 but before July 2014.

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 116 of 337

A large amount of Al Hani’s vehicles and other heavy equipment was assembled at Al
Hani’s Tweisha yard following the outbreak of the Revolution in 2011, and varying
amounts of equipment were kept there subsequently.*** Satellite photographs show
numerous vehicles and other items of equipment in the yard as of October 2013, and that

they were no longer there in July 2014.

Claimant places the value of the missing vehicles and equipment at €10,238,821.
Respondent’s expert finds the documented value to be about €561,000 less.>49 Thus, the
core dispute between the Parties does not go to the value of the missing equipment. It
instead concerns the circumstances of its removal, and whether Respondent bears

responsibility under the Treaty.

qd) Claimant’s Position

Claimant contends that removal of the vehicles and equipment, and Respondent’s
subsequent failure to investigate its loss and seek its return, was in breach of the Treaty,
and in particular involved a failure to assure constant protection and security in breach of
Article 3(1) of the Treaty. In Claimant’s view, Article 3(1) imposes an obligation of due
diligence to provide physical protection and security.**° As to the content of this duty,
Claimant refers to AMT v. Zaire, which found it to require a State to take “all measures
necessary to ensure the full enjoyment of protection and security of [the] investment.”>>!
Claimant adds that the duty of due diligence includes the obligation to “take adequate steps

99352

to apprehend and punish a wrongdoer. Claimant rejects Respondent’s suggestion that
a State’s resources and ability to provide protection and security are relevant in assessing

due diligence, contending that the view that the constant protection and security standard

Claimant indicates that it learned of the disappearance of the vehicles and equipment from
review of commercial satellite images taken well after its departure from Libya;***
Claimant asserts no independent knowledge of what happened to the vehicles and
equipment. However, it advances two lines of argument to establish Respondent’s liability
under the Treaty. First, Claimant refers to a letter sent by Strabag in December 2014 to
Libya’s Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, with copies to the Prime
Minister and the Ministers of Foreign Affairs, of Economy and Industry, and of Finance
and Planning, seeking assistance regarding the missing equipment. The letters to these
officials were addressed to them at a hotel in Tobruk, presumably reflecting the unsettled
conditions in Libya at that time. (Copies were also sent to the Prime Minister’s Office and
to Ministry buildings in Tripoli.) The copy from Claimant’s files in the record indicates
that various methods of delivery were to be utilized. There is no evidence confirming that

the letters were received, but Respondent does not deny that they were.

Citing the Treaty’s constant protection and security obligation under Article 3(1) of the

Treaty, Strabag’s December 2014 letter requested

that you confirm whether any Government officials or persons
otherwise acting on behalf of the Libyan State were responsible for
the removal of our property. In any event, we request the competent
Libyan authorities to take steps as a matter of urgency and arrange
for the return of our machinery and equipment to our main yard at
Tripoli — Gasr Bengashir — Tweisha.***

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 118 of 337

There was no reply, and there is no indication that Respondent’s officials took any action
in response to the letter. Claimant contends that these circumstances establish
Respondent’s liability for a failure to provide constant protection and security as required

by the Treaty.

In its Post-Hearing Brief, Claimant develops an additional argument. At the close of the
Hearing, the Tribunal asked the Parties to provide any additional information available
regarding the missing Tweisha vehicles and equipment. Neither Party provided anything
further. However, pointing to Mr. Turki’s testimony at the Hearing that Al Hani’s materiel
had been removed to LIDCO’s yard (examined infra), and to Mr. Al-Naas’s testimony that
“LIDCO is part of the Libyan Government,” Claimant argues that the Tribunal should draw
adverse inferences in light of Respondent’s failure to provide anything on the fate of the

vehicles and equipment.**°

(2) Respondent’s Position

Respondent’s Counter-Memorial agrees that the obligation to provide full protection and
security imposes a duty of due diligence but maintains that this duty does not entail strict
liability. For Respondent, “[t]he essential question is whether the State exercised due
diligence to the extent ‘reasonable under the circumstances’.”*>” In this regard, Respondent
contends that “international law affords a State a particularly wide measure of deference”
in assessing whether the State has shown due diligence.*** Moreover, in Respondent’s
view, application of the Treaty standard “must take into account a State’s resources and

ability under the circumstances of [a] war.”*5?

Respondent also contends that “[b]reaches of this standard are not easily proven,”>°

pointing to perceived shortcomings in the logic or evidence of Claimant’s claim. Thus, in
a footnote, Respondent’s Counter-Memorial contends that the fate of the equipment was

an internal Al Hani matter for Strabag to sort out with its joint venture partner:

Claimant claims that satellite photography show that its equipment

was removed from the Tweisha worksite in July 2014 ... However,

Mr. Turki testifies that he was told by an Al-Hani representative that

Al-Hani itself had in fact moved its equipment from the Tweisha

yard ... The Joint Venture Agreement between LIDCO and Strabag

provides that LIDCO is responsible for sourcing equipment and for

“sourc[ing], nominat[ing], and secur[ing]” locations for Al-Hani ...

The decisions of the Al-Hani joint venture partners regarding

management of their property is an internal matter for Al-Hani. *6!
In her opening argument at the Hearing, Respondent’s Counsel elaborated on this
argument. She noted that Mr. Azouz _ the individual identified in a witness’s statement
(discussed infra) as having removed the property was Al Hani’s Deputy General

362 and

Manager, and a member of its Board of Directors, signed many letters for Al Hani,
indeed was the victim of an earlier kidnapping cited by Claimant.*°? As Deputy General

Manager, Mr. Azouz presumptively had authority to take possession of the equipment.

Counsel also suggested at the Hearing that the equipment might have been sold to satisfy
Al Hani’s obligations, particularly to Gumhouria Bank.** She speculated that, as the bank
had a security interest in Al Hani’s moveable property, the equipment could legitimately
have been sold to satisfy the bank’s claims.*°> However, Counsel’s argument was framed
as a hypothetical, describing what might have happened. While she cited documents

indicating that the bank had a security interest in Al Hani’s moveable equipment, no

evidence was offered to support the hypothesis that the bank seized and liquidated the

equipment.

As to Claimant’s letter requesting Respondent to investigate the disappearance of the
equipment, Respondent contends that at the time the equipment disappeared from the yard,
Libyan authorities were not in control of the affected area and could not investigate or
recover the lost property. Respondent maintains in this regard that “[t]he circumstances in
Libya following the 2011 Revolution made it impossible for the Libyan authorities to
recover the property in question or identify the individuals allegedly responsible.”*6° More

specifically, Respondent cites a conflict among multiple factions that broke out in 2014:

In such a situation it is impossible for the Libyan authorities to
guarantee full protection and security. The internationally
recognized government has not been in continuous direct control of
much of the territory where the property in question was located,
such as the areas of Tweisha and Tajura.°°”

(3) The Tribunal’s Analysis and Decision

The Parties agree that Article 3(1) of the Treaty does not impose strict liability and that the
applicable legal standard is instead one of due diligence.*°* They do not agree on the
implications of this standard here. However the standard is defined, Claimant has the
evidentiary burden of showing Respondent’s failure to exercise due diligence in the

circumstances. The Tribunal therefore turns to the relevant evidence.

The evidence shows that Mr. Napowanez, Mr. Penkhues,*°? Mr. Akasha?” and other Al
Hani personnel sought to collect as much of Al Hani’s property as possible at Tweisha yard

after the Revolution began in early 2011.7! The amount of property in the yard rose and

it may have been removed by LIDCO, Strabag’s joint venture partner, a wholly owned

Respondent’s witness Mr. Turki states in his First Witness Statement that “[s]ometime in

equipment from the Tweisha camp in 2014, but I have no actual knowledge of when or

340. Mr. Akasha, a former Al Hani employee who did not appear at the Hearing, stated in his

Witness Statement:

Two days after Mr. Napowanez left Libya,?”” Mr. Azouz, Mr. Ali
Salabi, together with three armed men from a private militia came

said they had instructions to take everything from the yard and move
it to LIDCO’s compound. I tried to stop them, but was beaten up by
the militiamen and was told not to return to the Tweisha site again.
I reported this incident to the police, but no investigation was carried
out and no one was charged. I have not returned to the Tweisha site
since that time, although I heard that LIDCO has taken all of Al
Hani’s equipment and has sold much of it to third parties.°”8
341. The Tribunal cannot give great weight to the evidence of either of these witnesses.
Mr. Turki candidly states that he “ha[d] no actual knowledge of when or how equipment
was removed from the Tweisha camp.” Mr. Akasha did not attend the Hearing and was not
cross-examined. Further, he acknowledges in his written statement that his reference to
LIDCO taking Al-Hani’s equipment and selling it is based on hearsay and not personal

knowledge.

342. Thus, the witness evidence concerning the circumstances of loss consists of two small and
uncertain comments from witnesses with no personal knowledge who suggest that
Strabag’s joint venture partner LIDCO may have had something to do with it. There is no
other evidence regarding the circumstances of the equipment’s disappearance. There is no
evidence that Claimant made any inquiries aside from its December 2014 letter, or that it

sought to contact its erstwhile joint venture partner.

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 123 of 337

Thus, the core of the Claimant’s claim boils down to an argument that when high
Government officials were asked about the disappearing equipment some months later, at
a time when they were displaced from the capital to Benghazi, there was no response at the
time or subsequently. The Tribunal should therefore infer that Respondent failed to act in
response to the disappearance, showing a failure to provide constant protection and security

in breach of Article 3(1) the Treaty.

The inference Claimant asks the Tribunal to draw must be assessed in light of the situation
in Libya. As Respondent contends, and as the Tribunal earlier observed, the security
situation in and around Tripoli in and after the summer of 2014 was unsettled and
dangerous. As the UN Secretary-General observed in his 5 September 2014 Report to the
UN Security Council:

The reporting period witnessed the most serious outbreak of armed

conflict, in Tripoli, Benghazi and elsewhere in the country, since

2011. The use of heavy weaponry in densely populated areas by all

sides, in particular in the capital, resulted in an unprecedented

movement of population as civilians tried to escape the fighting. An

estimated 100,000 people were displaced in Tripoli, with an

additional 20,000 in the east. At least 100,000 are known to have

crossed the borders into neighbouring countries. The conflict also

caused the vast majority of the international community present in

Libya, including the United Nations, to withdraw from Libya.”
The Tribunal finds that Claimant’s evidence is not sufficient to establish a failure of due
diligence by Respondent. The bits of witness testimony described above _ both pointing in
the direction of Al Hani’s joint venture partner as the relevant actor are of little assistance.
And in light of the prevailing conditions of violence and disruption in Libya in 2014 and
subsequently, the suggested inference is too uncertain to sustain claim for €10 million. The
Tribunal finds that Claimant has not proved that Respondent failed to meet its obligations
under Article 3(1) of the Treaty with respect to the unexplained disappearance of Al Hani’s
property or otherwise acted contrary to its obligations under the Treaty. Claimant’s claim

for €10,238,821 for equipment missing from Tweisha yard in 2014 is dismissed.

F. CLAIM 3. AMOUNTS OWED TO AL HANI UNDER PAYMENT CERTIFICATES

346. Pursuant to Article 8(1) of the Treaty, Claimant seeks substantial amounts for payment
certificates that were submitted under the Benghazi, Misurata, TIAR, TIAR-NE, and
Tajura Contracts, but were not paid. Claimant’s quantification experts from FTI place the
total value of these at €36,615,174.>8° Respondent’s quantification expert from Blackrock
assesses the unpaid payment certificates on a figures-as-figures basis to be €33,618,213.°*!

The difference between the experts — slightly less than €3 million primarily involving

382

differences regarding the road contracts*** — is hardly inconsequential, and is examined

infra. Nevertheless, the Parties’ quantification experts agree to a substantial degree

regarding the amounts of unpaid certificates, differing as to about 8.2% of the claimed total.

(1) Issues under the Road Contracts

347, Respondent’s principal witness on the payment certificates for the road contracts, Mr. Al
Kelani, acknowledges that substantial amounts were not paid on approved payment
certificates for these contracts. Mr. Al Kelani joined the TPB in June 201 1,383 and so had

no personal knowledge of earlier events. At the Hearing, he introduced a number of

384

changes to his witness statements,”** and on cross-examination he did not in some cases

provide responsive or consistent answers.**> Claimant’s Post-Hearing Brief cites this to

claim as presented by FTI at the hearing. CH-3, FTI Quantum Hearing Presentation, p. 8.

argue that Mr. Al Kelani did not prepare his witness statement himself, that he had no first-

hand knowledge, and that his testimony should be given no weight.?*°

It does appear that significant parts of Mr. Al Kelani’s witness statement and its supporting
documentation were prepared by, or with substantial assistance from, others. His testimony
denying that he received significant assistance from others in preparing his witness
statement was unconvincing.**” However, his statements provide an overview of the road
contract payment certificate claims, and the Tribunal has referred to his evidence in

framing its consideration of these claims.

Mr. Al-Kelani acknowledges that substantial sums were due with respect to unpaid
payment certificates for the Benghazi, Misurata, TIAR-NE and TIAR Contracts. His
appraisals of amounts due differ from the Parties’ quantification experts’ analyses, and the
Tribunal has primarily referred to the Parties’ experts’ assessments in analyzing this claim.
Nevertheless, the Tribunal views Mr. Al Kelani’s First Witness Statement as a useful

“reality check,” confirming that many payment certificates were indeed not paid.
Thus, in Mr. Al Kelani’s calculation, for inter alia:

- The Benghazi Contract. Claimant sought approximately LYD3.67 million and €2.58
million for unpaid certificates. Of these, Mr. Al Kelani acknowledged that

approximately LYD2.85 million and €1.74 million are owed to Al Hani.**

- The Misurata Contract. Claimant sought about LYD2.59 million and €2.58 million for
unpaid certificates. Mr. Al Kelani accepts that of this, Al Hani is owed LYD2.41

million and €1.38 million. >?

- The TIAR Contract. Claimant sought approximately LYD3.37 million and €1.90
million for unpaid payment certificates, of which Mr. Al Kelani assesses that roughly
LYD3.17 million and €1.81 million is due to Al Hani. However, he also maintains that
the amount due should be reduced by the amount of the unrecovered advance payment
(LYD767,000 and €439,000), leaving a balance in Al Hani’s favor of LYD2.41 million

and €1.38 million.?°°

351. At the Hearing, both Parties’ experts attributed the roughly €3 million difference between
their valuations of unpaid certificates under all of the contracts to essentially the same
causes. In FTI’s calculation, almost half of the difference reflects disagreement as to the
applicable exchange rate under the road contracts, a matter that FTI viewed as “contractual
or legal in nature.” An amount of about €584,000 is attributed to deductions to Al Hani’s
claims for additional costs of bitumen under the Benghazi, Misurata and TIAR
Contracts.*?! FT] attributes a further amount of about €935,000 to Respondent’s contention
that Al Hani was not entitled to certain payments under the TIAR-NE Contract, principally

for Payment Certificate No. 3.
352. Respondent’s expert Mr. Osbaldeston of Blackrock had a similar analysis:

[T]he issues really boil down to about two or three issues. For the
Benghazi and the Misurata Contracts, | understand the differences
primarily relate to an Exchange Rate issue and/or deductions that
were made on certain Certificates in respect to document bitumen.
The largest difference which I think now has been addressed by FTI
in its presentation of yesterday relates to the TIAR-NE Contract and
the valuation of the Works, the gross value of the Works against the
various milestone payments.*”

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 127 of 337

The Tribunal observes that both Parties’ quantification experts presented extremely
detailed and extensive reports, addressing numerous valuation and accounting issues
involving amounts great and small. The Tribunal does not see its task to be to address every
issue raised in several hundred pages of reports by the two sets of experts. It will instead
focus on a small group of issues that may bear significantly on any amounts due under the

contracts.

(2) The Quantification Experts’ Principal Disagreements

The Parties’ experts identify three areas as primarily responsible for their different
assessments of the amount due for unpaid payment certificates: the exchange rates for the
Misurata Contract; Respondent’s deductions from Al Hani’s bitumen certificates; and the

alleged payment shortfalls under the TIAR-NE Contract.

A, The Misurata Exchange Rate

The largest single difference, which FTI assesses to be over €1 million, involves the

exchange rate used for payments under the Misurata Contract.
Mr. Al Kelani contends in his First Witness Statement that:

Because the Benghazi, Misrata and Garaboulli contracts did not
mention the exchange rate to be used, the exchange rate applied was
the exchange rate in effect on the day TPB’s payment letter of credit
(the “Payment Letter of Credit”) was opened (or the exchange rate
in effect when the Payment Letter of Credit was increased to fund
the Variation Order amount, or refunded to fund work already under
the scope of the contract, in the event the Payment Letter of Credit
was not fully funded at the outset of the project).>%

Claimant disagrees:

In respect of the Misurata and Garaboulli Contracts, Mr. Al Kelani
and the Respondent wrongly assert that the contracts are silent as to
the applicable exchange rate. As Mr. Knaack explained in his letter
to the TPB on 10 October 2010, Article 3 of Annex 2 to the Misurata
Contract stipulated that the exchange rate applicable in the contract
was the “selling rate of exchange of the Central Bank of Libya 28

33 1 Al Kelani WS 26.

116

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 128 of 337

days prior to signing the Contract.” Mr. Knaack sent a further letter
to the TPB on this issue on 7 December 2010. The TPB responded
to neither letter.°%

358. Annex 2 is contained in a 21 March 2007 Addendum to the Misurata Contract submitted
by Al Hani in English that, inter alia, states Al Hani’s price in response to RBA’s tender
offer. Each page of this Addendum and its Annexes was signed by RBA and bears its seal,
evidencing RBA’s agreement to Al Hani’s response to its offer. Article 3 of Annex 2 states:
“The rates and prices are based on the selling rate of exchange of the Central Bank of Libya

28 days prior to signing of the contract.”3%°

359. Mr. Al Kelani’s response in his Second Witness Statement is essentially that the Addendum

was contractually irrelevant and created no obligation for TPB because it was in English:

TPB is required by law to apply the terms in the Arabic versions of
the Contracts and, as | noted in my First Statement, the Arabic
versions of these two Contracts are silent as to the exchange rate.
The applicable exchange rate for payments under the Benghazi and
Misrata Contracts is, therefore, the one on the date of opening of the
relevant letter of credit, which is consistent with the practice of
TPB.**

360. | When he was shown the Addendum in cross-examination at the Hearing, Mr. Al Kelani

testified that he did not know of its existence:

Q. But you see that in English there is a signed agreement which
does mention an exchange rate.

A. I don’t know. I don’t know this document. As a person
working on the financial side, I was not aware of this
document.

Q. You have not seen this document before today; is that what

you are saying?
A. No, I have never seen it before.*9”

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 129 of 337

The import of the argument in Mr. Al Kelani’s Second Witness Statement is that the
Addendum (which he had never seen) was contractually irrelevant. However, the
Addendum includes numerous elements that are central elements of the Misurata Contract.
These include Al Hani’s specification of the projected contract priced, the term of
execution, the amount of the advance payment, minimum liability insurance requirements,
unit prices for materials, Al Hani’s obligations to accommodate TPB on-site engineer, as
well as lesser commitments such as Al Hani’s obligation to provide TPB with 4
Volkswagen Passats and a four-wheel drive Toyota Landcruiser. The document was signed

and sealed by TPB, indicating agreement with the contents.

The Parties implemented the Contract in accordance with the terms of the Addendum, and
there is no evidence that TPB regarded other provisions of the Addendum, which it signed
and sealed, as evidence of agreement as contractually irrelevant. As a matter of good faith
in the performance of its contractual obligations, TPB cannot pick and choose which

provisions in the Addendum are to be observed and which can be ignored.

The Tribunal decides that the applicable exchange rate for determining payments in Euros
under the Misurata Contract is “the selling rate of exchange of the Central Bank of Libya
28 days prior to signing of the contract.” On this basis, FTI assesses and the Tribunal
accepts that Al Hani is entitled to receive an additional €1,092,078 on its payment

certificates claim pursuant to Article 8(1) of the Treaty.

B. Deductions for Bitumen Payment Certificates

Mr. Al Kelani explains in his First Witness Statement that there was a shortage of bitumen
in 2009, resulting in market prices for bitumen above the contractually authorized prices.

Accordingly, a special process was created for contractors to recover the increased cost:

118

365.

366.

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 130 of 337

[T]he General People’s Committee issued instructions to pay the

difference between the market price and the contractually agreed

price of bitumen. Based on those instructions, contractors in projects

that TPB was supervising would submit payment certificates with a

separate, specific accounting for the price of bitumen. These

certificates (the “Bitumen Certificates”) would go through the same

review process as the normal Payment Certificates for works

performed under the Road Contracts.°”*
According to Mr. Al Kelani’s First Witness Statement, Claimant sought LYD7.488 million
for bitumen certificates, of which he calculated only LYD5.333 million was due, a
difference on the order of LYD2.155 million.*°? FTI contends that the figures Mr. Al
Kelani gives in this paragraph cannot be reconciled with figures elsewhere in his witness
statement, and that “[t]he amount excluded by Blackrock/A1 Kelani for increased bitumen
costs in excess of the BOQ is not entirely clear from the Al Kelani witness statement, but

it appears that this amount is approximately EUR 1.0M.?4°°

Mr. Al Kelani contends in his First Witness Statement that Al Hani claimed for amounts
of bitumen in excess of the agreed Bills of Quantities under the contracts.*°' He therefore
reduced the claim for the Benghazi Contract because of “the excess amount of bitumen Al-
Hani claimed in these certificates, which were [sic] in excess of the amounts set forth in

the agreed Bill of Quantities for the Benghazi Contract.”4

He made a corresponding
reduction to the bitumen claim for Misurata for the same reason: “[t]his difference is
attributable to the excess amounts of bitumen that Al-Hani claimed to use which were in

excess of the amounts set forth in the approved Bill of Quantities.”4°

367. At the Hearing, Mr. Al Kelani confirmed that bitumen certificates had to be reviewed and
approved by the employer’s representative (the supervising engineer at the site) prior to
submission.‘ Prior to approving the certificate, the supervising engineer therefore was

obliged to confirm that the certificates correctly indicated the quantity of bitumen used.
368. | Claimant’s experts from FTI disagree with Mr. Al Kelani’s analysis:

30) _ ... Mr. Al Kelani suggests that the Bills of Quantities for the
increased cost of Bitumen were “agreed”, inferring that they
represented fixed price adjustments up to the limit of those
quantities.

31) In the first instance, we have seen no evidence to confirm
Mr. Al Kelani’s assertion. Secondly, the amounts being
claimed for the increased cost of Bitumen are all based on
payment certificates that were approved under the terms of.
the contract and the quantities of asphalt work included in
approved contract work certificates. The values of the
contracts were estimated, to be finally decided by
multiplication of the contract rates by the actual executed
quantities of work. The same principle applied to the
evaluation of the increased cost of Bitumen, in that the Bills
of Quantities for the evaluation were necessarily provisional,
subject to final quantities of asphalt work, which serve as the
basis for the evaluation of the increased cost of bitumen.

 

32) ... Neither Blackrock nor Mr. Al Kelani have explained or
provided any evidence to support the statement that the
amounts that were certified in the Bitumen Payment
Certificates “were in excess of the amounts set forth in the
agreed Bill of Quantities”. In this respect, as the contracts
always provided for the value of the contract work and the
increased cost of bitumen to vary by re-measurement of the
asphalt work, any cap on the quantities of bitumen work
applied by RBA, for internal budgeting purposes, would
always be subject to change according to the quantities of
work actually performed.*°>

Mr. Osbaldeston’s Second Quantum Report notes Mr. Al Kelani’s argument in this regard,

but does not comment on it.4°°

The Tribunal agrees with FTI’s characterization of the situation with respect to bitumen
under the contracts. The Bills of Quantities under the contracts were indicative and
provisional. They were not contractual limits on the amounts of materials to be used, as
demonstrated by the provisions of the contracts and of Libya’s Contracts Regulations
discussed elsewhere in this Award that authorized the employer to vary quantities within a

15% range without any change in unit costs.

In his Second Witness Statement and in cross-examination, Mr. Al Kelani advances a
further contention. He maintains that bitumen certificates previously certified by TPB’s
supervising engineer and approved by others in TPB and REKABA, including TPB’s

Technical Department,”

were reduced because the Technical Department later changed
its position and decided that Al Hani charged for more material than was required.*°* These
changes were made by a person currently in TPB’s Technical Department who did not

provide a Witness Statement or appear as a witness to explain them.*”?

The Tribunal finds that Respondent’s cited bases for the reductions in Al Hani’s bitumen
certificates lack sufficient legal or factual basis. The Tribunal does not accept that the
contract’s estimated Bills of Quantities set a limit on the amounts of bitumen that could be
used and for which Al Hani could be paid, or the additional or alternative contention that
TPB’s Technical Department long after the fact reversed its earlier approval and reduced

the compensable amount previously approved for payment.

The Tribunal finds, under Article 8(1) of the Treaty, that Al Hani was entitled to recover
the full claimed amount of its unpaid payment certificates for bitumen pursuant to its

contractual rights to be paid.

C. The TIAR-NE Contract

The TIAR-NE Contract involved a comparatively small (LYD4,950,000) project to design
a three-kilometer extension of the Tripoli International Airport Road. The Contract
provided for the work to be performed in three phases.*'° Claimant’s witness Mr. McDevitt

summarized Claimant’s understanding of the three phases as follows:

[T]he first phase corresponded to the preparation and provision to

the employer of the preliminary studies and design for the road

extension; the second phase corresponded to the preparation and

submission of the primary design; and the third phase corresponded

to the preparation and submission of the final design and the tender

documents for the construction work.4!!
As summarized by Claimant, this claim involves its contention that “whereas TIAR-NE
Payment Certificate No. 1 was paid in full, Payment Certificate No. 2 which was also
certified, was only 80% paid, and the TPB paid none of Payment Certificate No. 3 or for

the additional work going beyond the original contract scope.”*!”

As presented at the Hearing, FTI assesses the difference between the Parties’ experts
regarding the amount for unpaid invoices under the TIAR-NE Contract to be €935,680.7!>
Mr. Osbaldeston of Blackrock assesses a substantially larger difference, of €2,033,659.4!4
While not clear to the Tribunal, the difference apparently reflects Mr. Osbaldeston’s belief
that significantly lower amounts are due to Al Hani, either reflecting the unrecovered
balance of the advance payment or Respondent’s contention that Al Hani was paid for work

that was not performed.

() The 20% Reduction of Payment Certificate No. 2

Respondent’s defenses to the claims regarding the TIAR-NE Contract relied heavily upon
the evidence of Eng. Mohammed Bisher, the head of TPB’s Studies and Planning
Department. For procedural reasons, Mr. Bisher was unable to obtain a visa to attend the
Hearing, and therefore had to be cross-examined remotely from Tunis. Whether due to
technological difficulties or his lack of familiarity with the process, his answers were

sometimes not responsive or in harmony with his written testimony.

As to the 20% payment reduction for the Payment Certificate No. 2, Mr. Bisher’s First
Witness Statement alleges a variety of shortcomings and unwarranted delays by Al Hani.
He thus states that Al Hani’s work on the second phase failed to produce required elements,
including soil surveys, a geotechnical study, a plan to protect existing utilities and “a
complete set of preliminary design drawings and specifications.”*'> In his Second Witness
Statement, he alleges that TPB nevertheless paid for allegedly incomplete work “in order
to ensure the continuity of work on the project.”4'® Mr. Al Kelani’s Second Witness
Statement advances a similar argument of deficient performance as a “correction” to his
First Witness statement. He urges that Al Hani was not entitled to recover the 20% balance

on Payment Certificate No 2 “[iJn light of Al-Hani’s failure to complete Phase Two.” *!7

For Claimant, Mr. McDevitt describes the design work performed under the contract, which
involved a substantial process of coordination with stakeholders in the project, as well as
changes resulting from that process.*!* He stated that he did “not understand why the TPB
did not pay the full amount since the design work was properly executed,”*'? and disputes

Respondent’s allegations of delays and poor performance:

I also object to Mr. Bisher's criticisms of our performance and his
allegations that we were severely delayed. It is true that we
requested extensions of time, first in our letter dated 22 June 2010
and then in our letter dated 12 December 2010. However, these were
caused by delays caused by the different government authorities
who had a stake in the project and the time it took us to redesign and
incorporate the changes required by the Committee and the other
government authorities, many of whom we could only communicate
with through the TPB, and were agreed to by the TPB.*?°
380. The Tribunal finds that the evidence does not support Respondent’s contention of
inadequate performance of Phase 2 of the TIAR-NE Contract. In this regard, in Mr.
Bisher’s testimony on cross-examination, he acknowledged that he had signed Payment
Certificate No. 2, and that in doing so he affirmed that the work required under the second

phase of the contract had been properly carried out:

Q. When you signed Payment Certificate Number 2, that was to
confirm that the Payment Certificate was correct; is that
right?

A. I did not sign the Payment Certificates for the money side. I
look at the technical parts. I’m not a specialist in financial
questions.

Q. So, your signature on the Payment Statement was
confirmation that the technical work had been completed in
full; is that correct?

[technical interruption]

A. The answer is yes.*?!

381. Other statements by Mr. Bisher on cross-examination lead the Tribunal to doubt that the
Phase 2 payment was reduced for reasons somehow reflecting the quality of Al Hani’s

performance. Mr. Bisher first stated on cross-examination that he did not recall why only

80% of Payment Certificate No. 2 was paid,*~ but he was then shown a TPB letter referring
to a General People’s Committee resolution “which indicates to payment [sic] of (80%) for
approved interim invoices, pending the completion of the administrative procedures related
to the payment and reimbursement.” This document referred to Payment Certificate No. 2
as “approved by the supervision and technical management department.”4”> Mr. Bisher did
not dispute this letter, and indeed later referred to it in responding to questions from the

Tribunal.474

The Tribunal finds that the evidence on record does not establish that there was any
deficiency in Al Hani’s performance in the second phase of the contract. In signing the
Payment Certificate, Mr. Bisher affirmed that the work was properly done and Al Hani was
entitled to payment. TPB’s letter directing 80% payment likewise affirmed that payment
was approved. That letter shows that the 80% partial payment was made to carry out a
broader Government policy, not because of any supposed deficiency in Al Hani’s Phase 2
performance. There was therefore no legal basis for the 20% reduction to Payment

Certificate No. 2. Al Hani is entitled to recover the amount of the reduction.

(ii) Payment Certificate No. 3
Payment Certificate No. 3, which reflected 40% of the value of the TIAR-NE Contract
(LYD1.98 million), was submitted on 27 December 2010,475 shortly before the Revolution
began in February 2011. In his assessment of amount due under the TIAR-NE Contract,
Mr. Al Kelani initially did not take Payment Certificate No. 3 into account as he “learned
of Payment Certificate No. 3 under this Contract only in this Arbitration. To my

knowledge, this payment request was never submitted by Al-Hani to TPB.”47°

Mr. Al Kelani revised his testimony in his Second Witness Statement, contending that Al
Hani had failed to perform Phase Three of the contract and was therefore not entitled to
payment.*”” Mr. Bisher’s First Witness Statement was more categorical: “[t]he Third Phase

of the contract was not paid, as no works were performed for that phase.”*?

Under Appendix B of the TIAR-NE Contract,*?? the third installment of 40% of the
contract’s value was to be made “[u]pon receipt and approval of the second phase
documents and papers (the final studies and designs, as well as the bid documents).”
Claimant contends that the “documents and papers” required by the Contract were
submitted, and that it was entitled to payment. In this regard, the record includes a 2 January
2011 letter from Al Hani to RBA transmitting the Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies in CD
form.**° The TIAR-NE Detailed Design Report is also in the record.*?! It is a substantial
and detailed 839-page document including, infer alia, annexes with road design drawings,
horizontal and vertical alignments, a drainage system design, a ventilation design for the

tunnel, technical specifications, and a cost estimate report.

The Tribunal has difficulty reconciling this evidence with Mr. Bisher’s and Mr. Al Kelani’s
initial assertions that no work was done under Phase 3 of the TIAR-NE Contract. In his
Second Witness Statement, Mr. Bisher acknowledges that Al Hani had indeed submitted
800-plus pages of materials, but contends that they were insufficient as they did not include
“detailed design drawings and specifications” and other documents that in his view were

required under the Contract.**?

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 138 of 337

Claimant sought without much success to cross-examine Mr. Bisher regarding the
procedure that TPB would have followed in reviewing Payment Certificate No. 3. This
process should have entailed consideration whether the extensive materials submitted by
Al Hani satisfied the contractual requirements. However, Mr. Bisher did not provide clear
answers to questions regarding that process.*** Indeed, he testified that he had no personal

recollection of Payment Certificate No. 3.434

Counsel for Claimant referred to Payment Certificate No. 3 having been lost in TPB and
having been resubmitted after the Revolution, but Mr. Bisher was unaware of this,
testifying that “I don’t remember. I don’t remember when this Payment Certificate was
submitted or whether it was lost.”4*> In any case, it is clear that Payment Certificate No. 3

was not paid.

The evidence shows that Al Hani submitted over eight hundred pages of design work to
RBA at the end of 2010 and beginning of 2011. Under the terms of the contract, Al Hani
was to be paid “[u]pon receipt and approval of the second phase documents and papers (the
final studies and designs, as well as the bid documents).” The documents clearly were not
approved, but it is not evident from the record whether RBA actually considered them in
good faith. (The Tribunal recalls in this regard that the design documents were submitted

shortly before the outbreak of the Revolution in February 2011.)

Mr. Bisher’s written evidence contends that the materials were not complete and did not
satisfy the contract. His responses on cross-examination — his testimony that he did not
recall submission of Payment Certificate No. 3, and his unclear testimony regarding TPB’s
procedure for review of payment certificates suggest that the submitted materials were

not given detailed consideration, if indeed they were considered at all.

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 139 of 337

It is clear that Al Hani did a large amount of design work, and submitted an extensive
volume of documentation pursuant to its Phase 3 obligations under the TIAR-NE Contract.
However, it also appears that this material was not reviewed or approved through the
approval process envisioned under the Contract, so the Contract’s requirements for
payment were not fully satisfied. In the circumstances, the Tribunal believes that a modest
reduction on the order of 10% in the amount to be allowed is warranted, to take account of
any corrections or shortcomings that might have emerged in the review process.
Accordingly, on the basis of Article 8(1) of the Treaty, the Tribunal awards 90% of the

amount claimed with respect Payment Certificate No. 3, €1.04 million.

D. Tajura Payment Certificates

Most of the Parties’ arguments and evidence involving the Tajura project go to Claimant’s
claims for delay and are discussed infra. Claimant also seeks the amount of several unpaid
payment certificates approved by HIB’s engineer for work done and materials used in the
Tajura project.**° Al Hani submitted five certificates for work done on the project. The first
was paid in full, and the second was largely paid. The last three certificates, all submitted
on the eve of the Revolution, were not paid. Al Hani also submitted several smaller unpaid
bitumen certificates that the Parties’ quantification experts assessed at either approximately

€560,000 or €605,000.*37

The Parties’ experts do not differ significantly in their assessments of the amount of the
unpaid Tajura payment certificates. FTI’s First Quantum Report assesses that €15,190,589
was not paid; Mr. Osbaldeston’s First Quantum Report concludes that nothing was due, as
in his opinion, the amounts owing should be credited against the unrecovered balance of
the Tajura advance payment, leaving a net to Al Hani of zero.*** In his Second Expert
Report, Mr. Osbaldeston maintains his opinion in this regard. However, he assesses on a
figures-for-figures basis that the amount of unpaid Tajura payment certificates was

LYD9,802,008 and €8,185,038. He converts the LYD component to be €5,691,356 (versus

FTI’s assessment of €5,456,692), for a total of €13,876,394. Mr. Osbaldeston adds to this
the amount €605,076 for unpaid bitumen certificates, for a total of €14,481,470.

Over the course of the proceedings, FTI refined its calculation of the amount due for the
Tajura payment certificates, but it did not state the amount separately in its presentation at
the Hearing. Mr. Osbaldeston’s Hearing presentation presents FTI’s final claim to be

€14,200,825.39

The Tribunal notes Mr. Osbaldeston’s opinion that nothing is due with respect to these
certificates, as the unpaid amounts should be netted against the unrecovered amount of the
Tajura advance payment. The Tribunal addresses issues related to Respondent’s set-off

claim infra and does not consider any possible set-off here.

Thus, the Parties’ quantification experts are substantially agreed regarding the total of the
unpaid payment certificates. FTI assesses the total to be of the order of €14.20 million.
Blackrock identifies a higher amount, approximately €14.48 million, roughly €280,000

larger than FTI’s assessment,*4°

the difference apparently due to different exchange rates
used by the experts. The Tribunal has not been directed to evidence in the record that details
the different exchange rates used or that would otherwise assist it in assessing this relatively
small difference between their assessments. In any case, the Parties and their experts have

not identified significant issues requiring decision by the Tribunal.

The Tribunal accepts FTI’s lower figure of €14.20 million as appropriately reflecting the
amount of payment certificates for the Tajura project that were certified by HIB’s

representative on the project but were not paid.

(3) The Tribunal’s Decision on Payment Certificates

As noted supra, Claimant’s quantification experts from FTI place the total value of unpaid

payment certificates to be €36,615,174.""!

Respondent’s quantification expert from
Blackrock assesses the unpaid payment certificates on a figures-as-figures basis to be
€33,618,213.*" As to the three issues identified by the experts as primarily responsible for
the approximately €3 million difference, the Tribunal has decided that the exchange rate
specified in Addendum 2 to the Misurata Contract should be applied; that Al Hani’s
bitumen certificates should be paid in full; and that the claims for Payment Certificates 2
and 3 under the TIAR-NE Contract should be paid in full, subject to a limited reduction to

the amount due under Payment Certificate No. 3 to reflect that the final documentation

produced was not reviewed and accepted as required by the TIAR-NE Contract.

Accordingly, pursuant to Article 8(1) of the Treaty, the Tribunal awards the sum of

€36,500,000 in respect of Claimant’s claim for all unpaid payment certificates.

CLAIMS 4 AND 5, PARTI. — RESPONDENT’S CRITICAL PATH CONTENTIONS;
BENGHAZI CONTRACT

As noted supra in paragraphs 245 and 246, the Tribunal has primarily adopted the system
for numbering Claimants’ claims used by the Parties’ quantification experts. The Tribunal

deals with Claims 4 and 5 jointly in this section.
(1) Amounts Owed to Al Hani for Additional Work Done

A, Respondent’s Critical Path Evidence

Before turning to Claimant’s several claims for work allegedly done in excess of that
provided for in Al Hani’s contracts, the Tribunal must consider a body of evidence
presented by Respondent which it contends should significantly reduce the amount of any

such recoveries.

“4! This amount claimed was refined slightly over the course of the proceedings. The €36.6M figure reflects the final
claim as presented by FTI at the hearing. CH-3, FTI Quantum Hearing Presentation, p. 8.

“2 RH-15, Blackrock Quantum Hearing Presentation, p. 4. In his presentation to the Tribunal, Mr. Osbaldeston said
that he had given his assessments “on a figures-as-figures basis ... I’ve simply given you a figure that I believe is
correct insofar as you determine any liabilities due.” TR 10: 2246:1-4 (Mr. Osbaldeston).

130

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 142 of 337

402. Respondent submitted two substantial expert reports by Mr. Richard Lee Edwin of
Blackrock Progamme Management, who contended that the extensions of time extended

to Strabag/Al Hani under several of its contracts were not sufficiently or properly justified.
403. As Mr. Edwin described his mandate to the Tribunal at the Hearing:

My instructions are to ... give my opinion regarding whether Al Hani
submitted sufficient or adequate evidence demonstrating its
entitlement to extensions of time and prolongation compensation on
each of the various contracts, also to provide proper and timely
notice in support of each of its claims and whether or not it based its
asserted Delay Claims on the Terms and Conditions of the various
contracts.*#3

404. In Mr. Edwin’s opinion, extensions for delays are appropriate only where a delaying factor

can be shown to affect the “critical path” of the project; that is, that the cited delaying factor

actually impacted the program and resulted in delay overall. In his view, this

leads to the presumption that some form of critical-path analysis is
necessary. Simply demonstrating a change of scope or increasing
quantities or delay to a specific activity ... may not, of itself, be
sufficient to justify the award of an extension of time. It must also
be demonstrated to have impacted the critical path at the relevant
time.“4

405. Mr. Edwin concluded that the several extensions of time for contract performance
authorized under Al Hani’s several contracts were not properly justified, in particular by

appropriate critical path analysis, and were therefore unwarranted.

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 143 of 337

Drawing on Mr. Edwin’s evidence, Respondent maintains that various events giving rise
to delays in Al Hani’s construction projects have not been shown to have “caused a critical

445 and “In the absence of any reasonable contemporaneous critical

delay to the Contract
path program, it is impossible to determine whether any event actually impacted a
project.”“*° The thrust of Respondent’s argument is that, in the absence of the critical path
analysis advocated by Mr. Edwin, Claimant has not established that the substantial
extensions of time for contract performance were awarded because of events attributable

to Al Hani’s contract partners.*47

In his presentation to the Tribunal on the penultimate day of the Hearing, Mr. Edwin sought
to illustrate his views by presenting a detailed analysis of work on the Benghazi Contract,
an analysis not previously introduced by the Respondent. Members of the Tribunal

questioned whether this material could properly be considered, given its nature and the

very late stage at which it was first offered.*#8

The Tribunal then paused to consider the matter. The presiding arbitrator then recalled

discussions between the Parties and the Tribunal prior to the Hearing:

[W]e had a carefully discussed and ordered procedure under which
the direct examinations it was not envisaged that they would be
going to the kind of supplemental analysis that you have presented
here.

Now, we understand your view that this sort of follows inexorably
from what you may have said, but still it does seem to the Tribunal
to, in effect, be new evidence at a difficult point in the proceedings.
And, from that point of view, the Tribunal is reluctant to accept your
Report for purposes of the record because it does seem to
supplement in material ways what we already had before us.**°

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 144 of 337

Mr. Edwin’s expert testimony accordingly continued without reference to his new analysis.
He contended that in the case of Benghazi Variation Order No. 2, there was no critical path
analysis and no proper substantiation of the additional time sought by Al Hani and granted
by the employer.**° He offered similar views with respect to the extensions granted for the
451

Misurata*”’ and other contracts.

On cross-examination, however, Mr. Edwin acknowledged that the type of analysis he
advocated was typically used prior to granting an extension of time. He acknowledged
further that Claimant did not now seek additional extensions, that the extensions involved
in the contracts at issue were all agreed by the respective employers based on the
circumstances and information known to them at the time, and that Respondent did not ask

the Tribunal to disregard those extensions or make any counter-claims related to them.

Mr. Edwin answered questions put to him on cross-examination clearly and fully, and the
Tribunal appreciates his clarity and candor. However, the Tribunal finds his answers to call

into question the relevance of his evidence in this case:

Q. In an ideal world, notifications of delay or the assessments
of delay, any extensions of time are made during the
currency of a project, aren’t they?

A. That’s correct.

Q. And the Claimant relies on extensions of time that were
made on that basis, doesn’t it?

A. Yes.

Q. And the Employer granted those extensions of time
contemporaneously.

A. Yes.

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 145 of 337

Q. Where the Parties agree extensions of time
contemporaneously, there is no need to perform a further
analysis after the event to second guess that extension of
time. It was granted, wasn’t it?

A. In terms of the time element, potentially, yes. In terms of the
entitlement to compensation whether the time element
associated with the payment of compensation, then it is
relevant to undertake further analysis, in my opinion.

Q. So, for example, in relation to Tajura, you said that to the
extent the Parties agreed an extension of time of 318 days
during the currency of the Project, further analysis at this
stage appears unnecessary?

A. That’s correct.

Q. And the same principle would apply to other projects than
Tajura.

A. That’s correct.

Q. Your clients have not suggested that the contemporaneous

extensions of time can or should be reopened, have they?
A. No, they have not.

Q. And no legal basis for reopening extensions of times has
been asserted in these proceedings?

A. No.
Q. As a practical matter, many years after the event, you
couldn’t put yourself fully back into the position of the

Employer at the time, could you?

A. No.4?

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 146 of 337

As Mr. Edwin confirmed, the several extensions of time for contract performance by Al
Hani involved in the following claims were agreed by the employers. The decisions to grant
those extensions are not now disputed. Had Mr. Edwin been advising the Parties when
these decisions were made years ago, events might or might not have developed differently.
He was not, and he freely acknowledged that he could not as a practical matter put himself

back in the position of the employers at the time these decisions were made.

B. The Tribunal’s Decision on the Critical Path Evidence

Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that Mr. Edwin’s evidence does not materially assist
it in its task. Respondent in effect contends that, absent critical path analysis at the time,
the Tribunal cannot attribute any significance to the several extensions of time that have
given rise to claims in this case.*3 The Tribunal does not agree. The extensions were
granted, and the Tribunal must therefore assess their significance in light of the evidence

in the case.

(2) The Benghazi Contract

Claimant seeks €7,302,790 for additional costs claimed for delay and disruption of the

Benghazi Road project said to be the responsibility of Respondent.***

The Benghazi Project. The Benghazi Contract was Strabag and Al Hani’s first significant
project in Libya. The Contract was signed on 18 October 2006,*°> following discussions
that began in May 2006.4 It called for Strabag to maintain 228 kilometers of the dual-
carriageway coastal highway between Ajdabiya and Al Marj in the east of the country.*%”
The initial parties to the Benghazi Contract were Strabag SE (which under the law in Libya

at that time, could enter into contract for public works) and the Road and Bridges Authority.

The Contract was subsequently assigned to Al Hani.*** The employer’s representative on

the project was Middle East Consulting Engineer (“MEC”).*°?

The Contract. The Contract price was based on measured quantities quantified in a Bill
of Quantities (“BOQ”) included in the Contract documents.*** The tender documents for
the Contract included a document provided to Strabag prior to contracting indicating the
maintenance method to be used in the rehabilitation project (“MNM document”).*°! As
discussed infra, the Parties dispute whether this document was a part of the Contract
establishing the repair method Strabag was to employ, or instead lacked contractual
significance, so that the employer could require a significantly different method of repair

without financial consequences.

There is no dispute regarding the contents of the MNM document. It specifies seven
different methods of maintenance and identified twelve stretches of road of varying lengths

where a particular maintenance method was to be applied.
Article | of the Contract states that Strabag was to carry out the maintenance work:

[I]n accordance with the provisions of this contract and its
appendices, the technical specifications, drawings, maps, quantity
lists, price schedules and CDs attached thereto ... In addition, the
Second Party acknowledges that it has reviewed all contract
documents and its appendices, has properly understood them, and
has accepted to contract based thereupon as well as to proceed with
execution pursuant thereto.

The Course of Performance. Strabag and RBA carried out a joint preliminary inspection
of the road on 28 and 29 November 2006. This showed that the estimated BOQ provided
with the Contract “grossly under-stated” the quantities necessary to carry out the works
indicated in the Contract.*®” Strabag began physical work on the basis indicated in the

maintenance method document in April 2007.4

In May 2007, Strabag was notified that RBA had appointed MEC as the Engineer on the
project. On 17 May 2007, Strabag submitted to MEC a “Method Statement” setting out
how it intended to carry out the work, describing it as involving continuous repair and

repaving as envisioned in the MNM document.‘

MEC was requested to conduct its own inspection to determine the quantities required.*”
MEC’s survey “revealed that damage to the road was more severe” than assumed in the
initial BOQ, so quantities had to be adjusted, including for preliminary activities required

before laying the binder course.*7!

Multiple drafts of a revised BOQ were prepared, and a final version agreed with MEC was
submitted to RBA for approval on 28 July 2007. The description of the Works in this
document specified that three small areas, totaling 1.8 km, would be patched, but the

remaining 415 km would be carried out over the full width of the road.47?

In the meantime, however, beginning in May 2007, MEC began to instruct use of different
methods of maintenance, and in particular to carry out repairs on small discontinuous

patches of road, not a continuous repair and resurfacing.‘ Acting on MEC’s instructions,

Strabag/Al Hani ultimately carried out the repair work in approximately 3,700 patches,

rather than in twelve continuous stretches of road.474

The evidence shows that the revised maintenance method led to significant delays. Because
of this, because the Contract’s initial BOQ badly underestimated the quantities required
even for the initial maintenance method, and because it did not reflect significant increases
in milling and other work required by the changed method of interrupted patches, Al Hani

ultimately requested two Variation Orders.

Mr. El-Abesh described the process for developing variation orders as an iterative
negotiating process, in which RBA/TPB and the contractor engaged to come to a result
reviewed by the auditors and acceptable to all.47> He also noted that the process for
approving requests for variation orders was “lengthy and required several layers of
approval.”4”° After a lengthy review process,*”” both Benghazi Variation Orders were

approved.

Variation Order No. 1, approved on 7 August 2008, extended the value of the Contract by
about LYD9.8 million and its duration to 15 December 2009,*”* a total of 350 days.*”
Variation Order No. 2 further increased the Contract price by more than LYD30.6 million
and extended the period for performance to 50.5 months, until 15 May 2011.**° In total,

the two Variation Orders increased the value of the Benghazi Contract by 61.91%.**!

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 151 of 337

A. Claimant’s Position

Claimant seeks €7,302,790 for additional costs due to delay and inefficiency resulting from
RBA’s change in the maintenance method. Claimant contends that it concluded the
Contract and mobilized personnel and equipment on the basis that it was to carry out the
repairs specified in the MNM document to the substructure of the road in the specified
reaches, and then lay a continuous binder course over the road. Because of the relatively
short 19-month period initially specified for repairing 425 kilometers of road, Claimant
states “we had to select and import high producing plant and heavy equipment to meet this
demanding schedule.”***

The two Variation Orders significantly increased both the Contract value and the time for
performance. However, Claimant contends that neither compensated it for additional costs
due to delay and inefficient utilization of resources due to the change to a system of 3700
patchwork repairs. Claimant contends this change rendered the work significantly slower
and less efficient, and resulted in substantial uncompensated costs.43 In Claimant’s

submission:

[C]arrying out the repairs in this manner resulted in the under-
utilisation of Strabag International’s equipment and manpower, and
introduced significant inefficiencies into the progress of the works.
In consequence, additional time was needed to carry out the contract
works, and Strabag International (and later Al Hani) suffered a
significant reduction in its productivity rates.*%4

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 152 of 337

Claimant contends that it developed its bid on the basis of the tender documents provided
by the employer, including the “Maintenance Categories” detailed in the MNM.“*° In this
regard Strabag’s letter of 16 August 2006 submitting its bid states that Strabag’s quote is
based on “[d]ocuments of a number of Maintenance Categories specifying and quantifying
the rehabilitation works.” The letter also refers to the colored schematics indicating the

maintenance methods to be applied to each section of the road.**°

Claimant maintains that it planned the work and mobilized resources on the understanding
that, under the Banghazi Contract, “following the removal of defective pavement surfaces
in certain stretches of the roadway and certain other isolated repairs, an overlay of asphalt
pavement (Wearing and Binder course) would then be placed to the full width of the
road.””487 Instead, MEC’s instructions required it to work in a slow and piecemeal fashion,

ultimately making 3,700 separate patches.

Mr. de Maria estimated that the changed maintenance method reduced Strabag’s
productivity by 60%.*** In his submission, “Strabag had to incur additional costs arising
from the under-utilisation of its equipment, and a disjointed and discontinuous method of

working, for a longer period of time.”

Claimant disputes Respondent’s interpretation of Article 5 of the Contract, to the effect
that Article 5 required Claimant to carry out an extensive in-depth survey of the road at its
own expense prior to bidding. Claimant observes that pre-contracting inspection of 430 km
of road during a bidding process extending from May to Mid-August 20064” was
necessarily limited, and that a detailed pre-bidding survey of the kind urged by Respondent

would have taken many months and involved substantial uncompensated expense.

Claimant likewise rejects Respondent’s interpretation of Article 7 of the Contract, to the
effect that Article 7 made the contractor responsible for the correctness of the plans and
factual representations made in RBA’s bidding and contracting documents. To the
contrary, Claimant showed that it was prepared to do the work utilizing the maintenance

method indicated in the tender documents and indeed mobilized on this basis.

Claimant also disputes Mr. Osbaldeston’s interpretation of Article 9, to the effect that it
gave RBA discretion to change the scope of the work significantly without additional
compensation. In Claimant’s understanding, this provision established only that, should
experience show that the BOQ had to be increased or decreased within the 15% limit, the
prices specified in the Contract for the inputs specified in the BOQ aggregate, cement,
and the like | would be applied without change. In Claimant’s view, Article 9 did not
authorize the employer to significantly change the nature of what the contractor was to

accomplish.*?!

Claimant denies that Variation Orders Nos. | and 2 barred its claims. Claimant insists that
the revised BOQs in the Variation Orders “reflected the increased quantities needed to
carry out the repairs on a patchwork basis, but did not compensate Strabag for the costs
incurred as a result of the unproductive method of working, such as increased labour costs,

492

additional equipment costs and other overheads. Claimant notes in this regard that it

presented these separate claims to RBA contemporaneously.*”?

Claimant’s quantification experts from FTI conclude that the amount claimed for delay and

lost productivity for the 350-day period “is reasonably stated.”“°* As described by FTI,

 

Claimant established its loss of productivity utilizing “measured mile” methodology.
Productivity (for example tons of asphalt laid per day) was established for activities

specified in the MNM document for periods when the contractor utilized those methods.

This was then compared with reduced productivity determined for periods where work was
carried out using piecemeal patching.** Al Hani describe this methodology in a 16 October
2010 letter to the Implementing Board of the Communications Projects setting out its claim
for additional costs resulting from the changed maintenance method. (This letter and its

supporting documentation and photographs run over 290 pages.) 4%

Claimant’s experts from FTI then calculated a daily rate of LYD46,301 for the costs
stemming from delay and inefficiency, based on an internal cost schedule. This amount
was multiplied by the 350 additional days authorized by the variation orders, resulting in
estimated losses of over LYD16.2 million. As its estimate was significantly higher than

Claimant’s claim, FTI judged that the claim was reasonable.*?”

B. Respondent’s Position

As summarized in its Post-Hearing Brief, Respondent first maintains that the MNM
document was not a part of the Contract so that that the employer could instruct Al Hani to
utilize a substantially different and more time-consuming method of work without
contractual consequences. Respondent cites in this regard the Libyan Administrative
Contract Regulations, which specify that “only those documents that are signed by both
parties can be considered part of the contract.”*°* In Respondent’s contention, the MNM
document on record bears only Strabag’s seal and is not signed or sealed by RBA.* This

confirms, in Respondent’s view, that the MNM document was not part of the Contract.5°°

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 155 of 337

In Respondent’s view, the maintenance method in the MNM document was not part of the
Contract, “because the manner in which work was to be performed was to be determined
by Al Hani and not specified by any contractual terms.”°°' While the MNM document was
provided to Strabag prior to bidding, it was, like the BOQ, a provisional document subject
to change. “Tender documents provided only preliminary data and a preliminary estimate

of quantities, which was subject to change during the execution of the contract.”°°?

Thus, in Respondent’s view, neither the Benghazi nor the subsequent Misurata Contract
“fixed a maintenance method or provided a manner in which the work was to be
performed.” Instead, ““Al-Hani was responsible for determining the final maintenance
method under these contracts through a survey to assess the necessary scope and design of
the works.”°°> However, in Respondent’s view, Strabag/Al Hani failed to conduct a proper
pre-contractual survey, which would have revealed the badly deteriorated condition of the
road and the shortcomings of the maintenance method contained in RBA’s tender

documents.

Respondent maintains in this regard that Articles 5 and 7 of the Benghazi Contract required
Strabag/Al Hani prior to contracting to verify the road’s condition and the correctness of
RBA’s contract documents. In Respondent’s view, these articles “allocated the risk of the
condition of the road and the adequacy of the general maintenance parameters for the
works” to the contractor. Strabag/Al Hani failed to make appropriate investigations of the
road and of the bidding documents it was given, and must bear the consequences, as “the

risk of ‘any additional costs’ was contractually assumed by Al-Hani.”°°4

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 156 of 337

In his reports, Respondent’s quantification expert Mr. Osbaldeston briefly advances the
further argument that Article 9 of the Contract authorizes significant uncompensated
increases in the scope of work to be performed.° This argument is not developed in

Respondent’s Post-Hearing Brief.

Respondent further contends that “the increase in contract price through the approved

508 and that

variation orders provided full compensation for all of the contractor’s costs,
nothing more can be claimed for the work. In Respondent’s view, by accepting the

variation orders, Claimant waived any claims for additional payments.

Thus, for example, Variation Order No. 2 significantly increased the total value of the
Contract to reflect Al Hani’s additional work. Article 3 then provided, inter alia, “the
second party [i.e., the contractor] shall not claim any increase in the contract prices or any
compensation resulting of the increase in the contract value.”*°” In Respondent’s view, by
accepting the variation orders, the contractor waived the claims for additional amounts

sought here.

Respondent adds in this regard that, had Al Hani believed itself entitled to additional
payment on account of alleged delay and inefficiency, it should have included these claims
in the proposed variation orders that it prepared and that RBA ultimately approved. It did

not do so, indicating that no such additional compensation was due.°°*

As to the amount claimed, Respondent’s quantification expert Mr. Osbaldeston from
Blackrock contends in his First Report that Al Hani failed to document its claim or explain
its basis or the method used to calculate it. He accordingly values the claim at “nil.”°°? In

his Second Report, Mr. Osbaldeston again wholly discounts the claim, relying on Mr.

Edwin’s opinion to the effect that the extensions of time granted in the variation orders

were not properly substantiated and that the delay was the contractor’s responsibility.>!°

In his Second Report, Mr. Osbaldeston further contends that, should the Tribunal
nevertheless find liability for delay and inefficiency due to the changed maintenance
method, the daily rate should be significantly less than that claimed by Claimant. In his
view, Claimant failed to substantiate its claimed rate, failed to show how costs were
mitigated, and failed to consider its own inefficiencies.*'' He further contends that the Bau-
Rechen- und Verwaltungszentrum (“BRVZ”) cost reports used by FTI (see paragraph 864
infra) do not provide a sufficient basis for the claimed rate, that they incorrectly include

certain overheads, and otherwise overstate the proper rate.*!

Mr. Osbaldeston estimates in his Second Report that, should any costs be allowed, the daily
rates should be a range of approximately LYD11,000 to 19,000 for delay and prolongation
costs and between approximately LYD11,521 and 18,890 per day for disruption and loss

of productivity costs.>'3

C. The Tribunal’s Decision

Status of the MNM Document. The Tribunal does not agree that the MNM document lacked

contractual significance and could be disregarded without consequence after work began.

The MNM document clearly set out, measured section by measured section, the work that
the contractor was to perform on specific sections of the road. Respondent acknowledges
that RBA provided it to Strabag and other prospective bidders with the understanding and
expectation that the recipients would rely upon it in preparing their bids. Mr. El-Abesh
confirmed at the Hearing that the MNM document was provided to Strabag and other

potential bidders by RBA prior to bidding>"*

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 158 of 337

Respondent’s Post-Hearing Brief contends that the MNM document was provided to
bidders “exclusively to aid the companies participating in the bidding process to price their
offers by relaying limited maintenance points.”*'> However, the Tribunal does not accept
that the MNM document concerned only “limited maintenance points.” The document
clearly identifies the work that a prospective bidder was to perform, identifying the repairs
to be performed on specific measured sections of the road. Without such guidance, a

prudent contractor could not know what it was being asked to do, or how much to bid.

In cross-examination, Mr. El-Abesh appeared to accept that the document was intended to

be taken seriously:

Q. .. [I]n terms of the tender, it was provided to tell the
Contractor, what to do; correct?

A. Yes, correct.*!°

Strabag’s letter submitting its bid clearly shows that it relied on this information in
preparing the bid.*'” After the bid was accepted, Strabag mobilized on the basis of the work
it expected to perform. Mr. de Maria states, for example that “our paver and asphalt plant

were selected on the basis of carrying out bulk work.”>!®

If, as Respondent contends, there was no maintenance method established by the
Contract,*'? leaving it to be determined after a contractor surveyed the road before or after
it took possession, it is difficult to understand why RBA provided this document and the
related colored schematics indicating the work to be done section-by-section. It would
seem inconsistent with good faith for an employer to provide these materials to prospective

bidders, expecting bidders to rely upon them, but then to disregard them after contracting.

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 159 of 337

Thus, the Tribunal is not persuaded by Respondent’s argument that RBA’s MNM
document and presumably the colored schematics also provided to Strabag and other
prospective bidders — have no contractual consequences and can be disregarded by the
employer. Respondent urges that the MNM was not stamped and signed by both parties,
which it maintains was necessary for it to be part of a contract under Libya’s Contracting
Regulations. The same argument would presumably apply as well to the colored schematics

in the record.5°*

However, this argument seems not to have been carried out in the contracting parties’ actual
practice. Article | of the Benghazi Contract requires the contractor to carry out the work
in accordance with the Contract and “the appendices, the technical specifications,
drawings, maps, quantity lists, price schedules and CDs attached thereto ... All
aft ioned de and appendices shall be idered an integral part of this
contract’ (emphasis added).°?' While the record does not include the full array of the
documents Article | lists as elements of the Contract, it does include, for example, the

multi-page document establishing the technical specifications.*”

This is a significant
document listed in Article 1, but it bears only the contractor’s stamp and signature. It shows
that the contracting parties did not view parallel stamps and signatures as essential for all
of the contractually important documents that Article | expressly identifies as parts of the

Contract.

Given this practice — and the significant issue of good faith that would otherwise be
presented if the MNM document were deemed to be contractually irrelevant the Tribunal
does not accept that the MNM document and other tender documents provided to Strabag

to specify the required scope of work are contractually irrelevant.

520 Respondent advances a similar argument regarding the Misurata Contract, where the record includes a similar
document setting out a maintenance method. In that case, the document was stamped and signed by Al Hani, and also

stamped

but not signed — by the employer. Respondent urges that the absence of a signature to accompany the

employer’s seal renders that document irrelevant, notwithstanding the presence of the employer’s seal. Resp. PHB

461. Articles 5, 7 and 9. The Tribunal does not share Respondent’s interpretations of Articles 5,
7 and 9 of the Benghazi Contract, which Respondent contends shift the risks of hidden
defects, imperfect specifications, and the like to a contractor. In the Tribunal’s view, a
correct understanding of these articles must take into account Article 1 of the Contract,
which defines the work the contractor is to perform. Article 1 makes clear that it is the

employer, and not the contractor, that determines what is to be done:

The Second Party pledges to execute the activities for the project to:
maintain the coastal highway between Ajdabiya and Al Marj, with
complete accuracy and meticulousness in accordance with the
provisions of this contract and its appendices, the technical
specifications, drawings, maps, quantity lists, price schedules and
CDs attached thereto, as well as any written agreement to be
concluded in connection with this contract ...°?3
462. Article | reflects a familiar pattern in contracting. The client specifies what the contractor
is to do; the contractor agrees to do that work. Respondent contends, however, that Article
5 obliged prospective bidders to carry out a detailed survey of the road, and that failure to
do so made the successful bidder responsible for undisclosed defects and deterioration of

the road, apparently including concealed conditions.

463. Article 5 of the Contract. The Tribunal does not agree with this expansive reading of the
contractor’s obligations under Article 5 of the Benghazi Contract. As its language shows,
Article 5 addresses actions prior to bidding, as a prospective contractor evaluates a possible
bid on a project. In cross-examination, Mr. El-Abesh acknowledged the limited character

of a contractor’s pre-bidding inspection in this situation.

Q. So, I think you’ve answered the point that, before the
Contract is signed, there is nothing to be done, but I was —
you were saying that actually they were to perform some
survey?

A. Before signing the Contract, the company doesn’t do any
work which is paid for. This is normal.

Q Yes.

So, you would expect the Contractor only to do very limited
investigations prior to getting a contract, wouldn’t you?

A. Yes.

It’s an assessment of the general situation. They study the
documents. They verify that they are correct when there are
documents which specify the details of the Contracts. In this
given situation with the Strabag contracts, there’s also the
BOQ, and they study the BOQ, they visit the site, they look
at the road, they get to know the road. This is what they do
before the Contract.

Q. Yes.

And then after the Contract has been awarded to the
successful Contractor, that Contractor would have a greater
opportunity to see the areas and plan further; is that correct?

A. It is not a possibility; it is a duty.°*4

464. This testimony by the head of the TPB reinforces the Tribunal’s view that Article 5 does
not impose the heavy burdens, or has the broad risk-shifting effect, now claimed by
Respondent. Article 5 is a universal standard clause, typical of all contracts made for
“construction only”, where the design is provided by the employer or its own consultants.
It is generally meant to prevent future claims for price increases based on alleged lack of
knowledge of the site conditions at the time of the tender. The present Claimant’s claim,
however, is for damages and costs caused by the revised working methods and associated
costs and delays, not a claim for price revision. In any case, the clause applies to the works
to be executed as defined in the contract and cannot enlarge the contractor’s scope of works
beyond the works precisely agreed in the contract. Nor can it transform a “sole

construction” contract into a “design and build” contract, as Respondent seems to contend.

Respondent’s interpretation of Article 5 would disregard the normal mode of contracting.
It would instead obligate the contractor to investigate in depth prior to bidding in order to
identify significant errors in the client’s description of the project and shortcomings in its
specification of the necessary work. Having failed to do so, says Respondent, the contractor
assumed the risks of the employer’s errors and shortcomings. This is not, in the Tribunal’s

view, a correct or fair reading of Article 5.

The Tribunal believes that a prospective contractor should be entitled to rely on what it is
told in tender documents provided by the client, including the client’s description of the
work it seeks to have performed. It would be unreasonable, and inconsistent with the
employer’s duties of good faith under Article 148 of the Libyan Civil Code>”* to interpret
Article 5 to make Al Hani responsible prior to contracting for identifying the

shortcomings of the pre-contractual documents it received from the employer.

The Tribunal notes in this regard that in a subsequent contract, in a situation where the TPB
wished Al Hani to carry out a detailed survey of a road repair project and to suggest a
maintenance method, this was clearly stated in that contract. The BOQ of the Garaboulli
Contract thus required Al Hani to perform a “technical field study of the status of the road
and the method of maintenance.”*?° There is no such provision in the Benghazi (or

Misurata) Contracts.

The Tribunal accordingly dismisses Respondent’s defenses based on Article 5 of the

contract.

Article 7 of the Contract. With respect to Article 7, Strabag and its successor Al Hani
clearly was prepared to do the work utilizing the maintenance method contained in the
MNM document, subject to increases in the BOQ to provide adequate materials. Indeed,
Strabag began work utilizing the specified method, while informing the employer that

additional quantities of material would be required. It was the employer’s representative

who then changed the method to be used, not the contractor. This gives the lie to any claim

that Strabag/Al Hani failed to comply with Article 7.

Article 9 of the Contract. The extent to which Respondent maintains arguments based on
Article 9 is not clear. This article allows certain adjustments in quantities of materials to
reflect evolving conditions as a project progresses. However, the Tribunal does not accept
that it authorizes an employer to change the basic nature of the work to be done without
financial consequences. Article 9 has a different and narrower purpose. Correctly
interpreted, it means that if the BOQ quantities actually required go up or down by no more

than 15%, there can be no change in the unit rates for the materials involved.
Mr. El-Abesh explains this clearly in his Second Witness Statement:

When the value of the required works exceeded the estimated

contractual value by less than 15%, Al-Hani was required to perform

the works under a variation order using the existing contractual unit

rates and did not have the right to change the unit rates for the

additional quantities needed for performance.*?”
The Tribunal next considers Respondent’s contention that, by accepting the two Variation
Orders, Strabag waived any claims for additional compensation related to delays and
inefficiencies. The relevant sentence appears in Paragraph 3 of the Variation Orders to
quote Variation Order No. 2: “The second party shall not claim any increase in the contract

prices or any compensation resulting of the increase in the contract value.” *78

The Tribunal does not understand this sentence in the manner urged by Respondent. The
first clause in the sentence does not by its terms apply. This claim does not seek increases
in the contract prices, that is, the contractually specified unit prices for materials and items
listed in the BOQ. The second sentence also appears inapposite. The claim involves delays
and inefficiencies resulting from changes in the project, not compensation “resulting of the

increase in the contract value.” The quoted phrase might have relevance were this a “cost-

plus” contract, where the contractor’s compensation is determined by the value of the

contract and not by the measured volumes. This is not such a contract.

It is clear that Al Hani did not regard itself as having waived its Delay Claims by operation
of this sentence in the variation orders. There was no agreement of the kind that Mr. El-
Abesh said characterized the formulation of such orders.°?? Al Hani made clear at all
relevant times that it sought additional compensation for the delay and inefficiency
resulting from the changed method of repair. Indeed, Mr. El-Abesh confirmed that Al Hani
persisted with these claims following the variation orders, noting that Al Hani “continued
to insist that the approved variation orders did not compensate it for the delay caused by
its loss of productivity.” In this regard, a meeting planned in early 2011 to address the issue

did not occur because of the Revolution.°°°

Thus, there clearly was no agreement by Al Hani to forego these claims, and the language

of the orders said to reflect or result in a waiver of the claims falls short of doing so.

Quantification. It is not disputed that the changed maintenance method resulted in delays
and inefficient use of equipment. Mr. El-Abesh acknowledged as much in cross-

examination:

Q. So, it’s much less efficient to work on a patchwork basis than
it is to work on a full-width basis, isn’t it?

A. Yes.
Patchwork also needs more skills, and if you don’t have

those skills, it means that the Contractor will be delayed.
This is what happens, usually.°>!

Q. ... So, it’s more difficult to do the patchwork, and it takes
longer to lay the same quantity of asphalt, doesn’t it?

A. If we work on patches, we take more time, but, as I have
always said, if the company does not have the skills
necessary within the ranks of the workers because a lot —
logic says that if there is — the quantities are less, then we
should work in a weaker fashion. But it is clear that when we
work on the basis of patches, we cannot use heavy
equipment. We have to use smaller-sized equipment.*??
The record shows that the changed maintenance method introduced significant elements of
delay and inefficiency in Strabag’s/Al Hani’s operations. RBA acknowledged the delay by
agreeing to a 350-day extension of time for performance. Moreover, Al Hani incurred a
variety of costs — for inefficiently deployed labor, for depreciation or rental of idle
equipment, and for running and administrative costs — that would not have been incurred

had the project proceeded as initially planned.

The Tribunal finds that Claimant has shown that it is entitled to additional compensation
on account of uncompensated additional costs incurred on account of the changed
maintenance method and the resultant delays. The Tribunal therefore turns to the issue of

quantification of the compensation due under the Benghazi Contract.

Claimant assessed its additional costs to equal a daily rate of LYD34,455 for 350 additional
days, a claim that FTI assessed to be “reasonably stated.”>*? In this regard, FTI made its
own independent assessment of the appropriate daily rate for the period of delay. FTI
concluded, based on its assessment of data in Al Hani’s Monthly Reports, that a daily rate
of LYD46,301, was justified by the evidence. This rate is significantly higher than that
claimed by Al Hani.>**4

As noted supra, Respondent’s expert Mr. Osbaldeston contended, based on Mr. Edwin’s
opinion, that the extensions granted to Al Hani were not justified, so that this claim should
be valued at “nil.” However, as also explained supra, the Tribunal does not accept the
relevance of Mr. Edwin’s evidence. The extensions were in fact approved by RBA at the

time and Respondent makes no request to set them aside. The Tribunal is convinced from

the evidence that the significant increase in the time required for performance was the result

of the changed maintenance method and the resulting delays and inefficiencies.

Mr. Osbaldeston contends in the alternative that, should the Tribunal find liability, the daily
rate applied in calculating the claim was too high. In his opinion, Claimant did not consider
the possible effects of Strabag/Al Hani’s own actions as causes of delay, and included
unjustified overheads and other unwarranted elements. (On this first point, the record
indicates that Strabag did in fact consider at least some of its own shortcomings and other
extraneous factors in calculating its claim. Mr. de Maria states, for example, that in seeking
additional time, Strabag excluded delays caused by its own delay in beginning asphalt

production and by shortages in bitumen.*3>)

Mr. Osbaldeston calculates a range of daily rates both for delay and inefficient working
that in his view should apply should the Tribunal find liability. His low estimates for delay
and inefficiency combined totaled on the order of LYD22,500 per day; his combined high
estimates totaled about L YD37,890.°*° This higher combined daily rate in fact exceeds the
amount used by Claimant in calculating the claim (LYD34,455), a point implicitly reflected

in FTI’s final presentation to the Tribunal at the Hearing.*>”

Given that the daily rate used by Claimant is less than both the rate calculated by FTI, and
the high end of the range of estimates offered by Mr. Osbaldeston, the Tribunal judges it
to provide a reasonable reference point for assessing additional uncompensated costs from
the changed maintenance method. As to the relevant evidence, the Tribunal has taken
account of Exhibit C-119, which is a voluminous and detailed demonstration of the
prolongation costs and disruptive losses of productivity; Section 4.2 of FTI’s First Report,
and Appendix 16 to their Second Report, which analyze Exhibit C-119, finding it a

valuable piece of evidence that leads FTI to assess a daily rate substantially higher than the

rate claimed by Claimant; and has, especially, taken account of Blackrock’s ‘Assessments

Summary’ forming part of Appendix 4.1 to their Second Quantum Report.

In this last table, Blackrock assesses this claim at a maximum of LYD13,265,000, which
would be reduced to a minimum of LYD8,007,746 “if items colored in red above are
removed.” The Tribunal notes that the minimum value arrived at by Blackrock reflects the
total removal of the four items colored in red in the above table, whereas Blackrock had
only suggested to adjust them down rather than deleting them all. The Tribunal further
notes that, by readjusting the difference between Blackrock’s maximum and minimum
through reasonable reduction rather than complete removal of the four criticized items, the
resulting amount would almost coincide with the amount claimed by Al Hani at the time
of the events, and in addition would leave intact an important part of the amount

assessed by FTI.

Based on these considerations, pursuant to Article 8(1) of the Treaty, the Tribunal awards
€6.90 million in respect of Claimant’s claim for uncompensated work on the Benghazi

Road project.

inefficiencies that Claimant attributes to RBA’s changed instructions regarding the scope

of the work to be done and its failure to provide timely decisions and instructions.

487. Respondent presents multiple arguments in response to the claim, at different levels.
Respondent first contends that there is no contractual or legal basis for the claim.
Respondent also advances a second tier of arguments regarding Al Hani’s allegedly

deficient performance of work under the Misurata Contract.

A. Basis of the Claim: Claimant’s Position

488. Claimant contends that:

During the course of the works on the Misurata project, the RBA
issued a number of instructions to Al Hani changing the method of
repairing the Misurata road, the pavement design and the culvert
design. The instructed changes resulted in delay and increased cost
to Al Hani, which Al Hani is entitled to recoup under the contract.
Al Hani thus claimed from the TPB the monthly costs for wages,
equipment, running costs, salaries, financing and overhead costs
incurred during the period of delay.*#?
489. Specifically, Claimant seeks compensation for uncompensated monthly costs said to result

from three separate periods of delay:

(dd) Claimant seeks compensation for 215 days of delay during the first delay period,
from 28 September 2007 through 30 April 2008.*3 This period covers the time
after Al Hani took possession of the work site in July 2007 and received the advance
payment in September 2007, and then ascertained that the road was seriously
deteriorated and needed to be rebuilt rather than merely “maintained” as anticipated
under the Contract. Claimant contends that there followed a substantial period

before RBA provided instructions for how the additional work was to be performed.

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 169 of 337

(2) The second claimed delay period of 288 days*** began in August 2008, when the
asphalt mix specified in RBA’s revised instructions could not withstand the heavy
loads on the road, leading to rutting. Work was then stopped for an extended period
while a German laboratory assessed the problem and recommended adding a
polymer to the asphalt mix. RBA then took additional time to approve this

recommendation and to authorize import of the polymer material.

(3) The third period, for 16 days, involves delays in determining the design for

repairing or replacing 45 culverts in the road.

490. Claimant contends that the Misurata Contract was a construction contract, and that Al
Hani’s contractual role was not to design the project. For Claimant, the Misurata Contract

and other road contracts

were all construction contracts whereby Strabag International/Al
Hani was obliged to construct the roads according to the instructions
and specifications provided by the RBA/TPB. The design was thus
provided by the RBA/TPB: these were not design and build
contracts.

Accordingly, when invited to bid for these contracts, Strabag
International/Al Hani did so on the basis of the scope of work
detailed in the tender documents prepared by the employer, notably
the [Bills of Quantities], Technical Specifications, and Method of
Maintenance ... Once selected, the contractor was obliged to execute
the works that work [sic] in accordance with the scope and
specifications contained in the tender documents unless and until the
employer instructed it otherwise ... °°

491. Thus, in the view of Claimant’s witness Mr. McDevitt:

Our view has always been and I believe it’s supported in our
execution of this Contract and also in the document itself that we are
not responsible for design. We were not. We were only responsible
for construction. And we pointed this out.°4°

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 170 of 337

In support of its position, Claimant points to, inter alia, a document given to it prior to
bidding indicating section-by-section the specific work that was to be done on each portion
of the road. Claimant views the maintenance method contained in this document as
defining the work it was to perform under the Contract. In direct examination, Mr.

McDevitt testified that it formed the basis for Al Hani’s pricing of its bid for the job:

My clear understanding of the situation at that time was that the

maintenance method formed the basis for the pricing of the offer and

the pricing of this work and subsequently became part of the part of

this Contract for this Project and was part of the documents

thereof.°4”
In support of its contention, Claimant draws attention to a March 2007 Addendum to the
Misurata Contract, signed by RBA and bearing its seal and official tax stamps, stating inter
alia, that Al Hani’s quote is based on specified documents provided by RBA including
“[djocuments of a number of Maintenance Categories specifying and quantifying the

rehabilitation works.”>“

Claimant further maintains that under Article 1 of the Contract, the contractor was
contractually bound to carry out the work in accordance with the technical specifications

it was given, including the maintenance method.*"”

The First Delay Period. As described in FTI’s First Report, “[t]he scope of the contract
work required repairs to be carried out to areas of the carriageway in accordance with the
Employer’s maintenance and repair scheme, which specified planning, or milling of the
road surface, repairing cracks and laying asphaltic concrete to damaged areas.”°°°

However, according to FTI, on commencement of work:

[T]he severity of damage to the road exceeded that anticipated by
the Employer, rendering the specified repair work inappropriate. Al
Hani had no alternative other than to await the Employer’s
instructions during which time it sourced quarries with sufficient
capacity to provide the aggregate for the anticipated additional
work. It was not until 25 March 2008 that the Employer carried out
an inspection of the road and issued instructions on | and 19 April
2008 to amend the contract work by removing and replacing the

entire asphaltic wearing course, binder layers and also the base

course.>*!

Due to additional amendments by the employer to the specifications and scope of the
project, Al Hani could not commence work until 30 April 2008, 215 days later than

planned.>*? This is the First Delay Period for which Claimant seeks compensation.

The Second Delay Period. Claimant seeks compensation for a further 288 days of delay,
from 18 August 2008 to 1 June 2009, stemming from the need to change the paving mix
because the reconstructed road was subject to rutting caused by heavily overloaded
trucks:*3 “Al Hani’s view ... was that the period from 18 August 2008 to | June 2009 was
essentially non-productive, and resulted in the requirement to increase the amount of time
required for the works on the road.”>4 Respondent*s Counter-Memorial acknowledges that

“[t]hroughout these months, little other work was performed.”>*>

The Second Delay Period arose as follows. After receiving RBA’s revised instructions to
proceed in late April 2008, Al Hani began reconstruction of the road. However, in August
2008, rutting appeared in two of the reconstructed sections.**° A 17 August 2008 message
from Al-Mamar, the supervising engineer, received the next day, stated that “[a]ll works

are stopped” and requested Al Hani “to start searching and studying the reasons of this

matter [the rutting] before the removal operation.”*°’ Then, “[o]n August 26, 2008, Al-
Mamar further instructed Strabag International to prepare a full study on the maximum
loads and other characteristics of the road, as well as a study on the properties of the

bitumen being used.”°°°

Samples of the bitumen were sent to a lab in Germany, which in November 2008 advised
that the asphalt mix specified by RBA was not suitable for the traffic, which involved
overloaded commercial vehicles carrying excessive loads. The lab recommended adding a

polymer to the paving mix to compensate for poor bitumen quality.°°°

A substantial period was then required to obtain a variation order authorizing a change in
the paving mix to address the rutting issue,’ including debates regarding which paving
courses should use polymer-modified asphalt and RBA’s demand that Al Hani discount
the increased price by 10%.**' RBA instructed Al Hani to follow the lab’s instructions in
part in February 2009, but did not approve import of the material to be used until | June
2009.5

The Third Delay Period. The Third Delay Claim involves delays in determining a course
of action for 45 badly deteriorated culverts, an issue that had to be resolved prior to
paving.°® Claimant contends that Al Hani identified this issue early in the project, but there
was no joint inspection of the culverts until 7 April 2008, after which RBA agreed they
should be replaced.*™ This entailed a significant change in the scope of work.*° Further

delays ensued pending RBA’s decision on the design for the new culverts; Al Hani and

RBA each blamed the other for the delays in resolving the design.°® On 4 January 2009,
Al Hani was instructed to proceed on the basis of an earlier design proposed by the
consulting engineer. Al Hani did so on 26 January 2009, with the caveat that it would not

assume responsibility for the design.°°”

Mr. McDevitt’s Witness Statement refers to multiple unanswered requests to RBA for
guidance regarding the culverts, beginning in December 2007 and culminating in a 17 May
2008 instruction from the engineer to rebuild the culverts using a design provided by
RBA.*8 Al Hani responded, inter alia, that the RBA design was for culverts of one meter
diameter, but ten of the existing culverts were two meters. Difficulties and a substantial
correspondence then ensued over several months regarding quality of concrete provided
by a local supplier, a request that Al Hani provide designs for the two meter culverts (which
was done), and other issues.°”? This sequence concluded with RBA on 4 January 2009
instructing Al Hani to proceed with construction of the culverts based on instruction
contained in the engineer’s letter of May 2008. Mr. McDevitt understood this to show that

“RBA had changed its position regarding our proposals for the 2m culverts.”°7!

Claimant contends that the period required to settle on the design for the culverts extended

for a period of 519 days. However, most of this overlapped with the 503 days claimed for

372

the first and second periods of delay’’* discussed above. Accordingly, this claim is for only

16 days, reflecting the “difference between the total amount claimed for the culverts, 519

days, and the total of the first two claims (503 days).”>7>

RBA agreed to variation orders authorizing additional time for contract performance
exceeding the periods claimed in this claim°” and raising the Contract value for the direct
costs of the additional work involved in the changes in scope involved in these three claims.
Claimant contends, however, that these did not compensate it for its associated indirect

costs of idle facilities, personnel, equipment and the like.

Claimant disputes Respondent’s contention that Article 5 of the Contract required it to
conduct a detailed pre-contracting inspection of the road sufficient to identify the extent of
its deterioration and define the remedial work required. In Claimant’s view, the nature of
any contractor’s pre-contracting inspection for a 210 km road project was necessarily
limited. Prior to contracting, the contractor did not have free access to the site, nor the time
or funding necessary to conduct extensive assessments.*”> In the view of Claimant’s

witness Mr. McDevitt, Article 5 of the Misurata Contract therefore:

covers your inspection to establish resources and to establish
whether there are facilities available. It actually explains what it
covers here, availability of workforce, existing plant and equipment,
existing sources of materials--all of the things that you need in order
to put together a bid for the actual work itself. It does not, in my
opinion, extend to including design or evaluation of the design
because the time allowed for that is just simply too great.>”°

Mr. McDevitt observes that even after signing the Contract and being given access to the

site in July 1997:

Strabag International would have carried out the initial visual drive
through to see the general condition and so on, yes, but at that stage,
we had no--we had no down payment at this point. We didn’t get
that until September [1997] to mobilize the resources necessary to
start all of this. And the Contract, I think, says that it doesn’t start
until we receive our Advance Payment.

54 The precise amount of additional time approved by the Variation Orders is not clear from the evidence. McDevitt

delay involved in this claim.

said earlier, this survey you referred to is purely for construction
purposes, not for redesigning the Project.*”

 

Claimant also denies that Article 7 of the Misurata Contract made Al Hani the guarantor
that RBA’s designs and specifications were correct. In Claimant’s view, Article 7 did not
go to the accuracy of the documents provided, but instead “whether the drawings and
specifications provided were sufficient for the contractor to carry out the work

specified.”>”* Mr. McDevitt thus understood this provision to have a limited role: based on

its review of the documents, could the contractor determine “‘is it buildable, basically.”°”°

B. Basis of the Claim: Respondent’s Position

Respondent denies liability, maintaining that under the Contract Al Hani, and not the
employer, was responsible for determining the nature and extent of required remedial work

and the manner to accomplish it. In Respondent’s submission, “the contract was signed

27580

based on only a rough estimate of the works required for the roa with responsibility

for determining the scope and character of necessary work falling on Al Hani.
Respondent explains in this regard that the Misurata Contract was

tendered without a full study of the conditions of the coastal road,
the precise maintenance method that would be required, or the
quantities that would be necessary for the works. Mr. El-Abesh
explained during his cross-examination that “the Coastal road
Contracts were not based on technical surveys, and they do not
include engineering and technical studies.” Rather, the Benghazi
and Misrata Contracts were tendered on the basis of a visual
inspection only, and the final maintenance method was left subject
to Al-Hani’s completion of an actual survey of the road in order to
quantify the works to be performed under the Contracts.**!

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 176 of 337

510. Thus, in Respondent’s view, the Contract was not a typical construction contract. It was
instead in substance a “design and build” contract that gave Al Hani the primary role in
surveying the state of the road and determining and proposing the remedial or

reconstruction work required. According to Mr. El-Abesh’s Second Witness Statement:

[T]he Misrata Contract and all the other Road Contracts was
awarded on the basis of an estimated BoQ and general maintenance
parameters. The contractor was responsible for proposing the final
maintenance method for the road after completing a survey of the
works.58?

511. Mr. El-Abesh affirmed this interpretation of the Contract at the Hearing:

Q. ... after the Contract has been awarded to the successful
Contractor, that Contractor would have a greater opportunity
to see the areas and plan further; is that correct?

A. It is not a possibility; it is a duty. The Contractor, once he
received the site, he has to review all the documents and
verify the state of the road, suggest a mode of action, define
the true BOQ, the Specifications, the Technical and
Engineering Specifications. This is the duty that falls upon
the Contractor.583

512. Accordingly, in Respondent’s submission, all delays in determining the nature and extent
of necessary work to repair the Misurata road were the fault of Al Hani and should be at
its cost. Respondent advances, in support of this view, interpretations of Articles 5,°*4 7
and 9 of the Contract mirroring those considered supra in connection with the Benghazi

Contract.

582 9nd EI-Abesh WS 417.

583 TR 5:1262:8-18 (Mr. El-Abesh).

584 Article 5 of the Misurata Contract is similar if not identical to Article 5 of the Benghazi Contract. The version in
the record reads: “The Second Party [the contractor] hereby attests that, prior to signing this contract, it inspected the
job site and the surrounding areas, and acquainted itself with all circumstances that are related to execution of the
work or that may affect it, such as the nature of the land, the condition of the soil, the water resources, the weather
conditions in the region, the roads, the traffic, and the availability of a workforce, etc. The Second Party shall be
deemed solely responsible for the effects and results arising from these factors.

165

514.

S15.

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 177 of 337

Respondent thus maintains that Article 5 of the Misurata Contract made Al Hani
responsible for identifying the seriously deteriorated condition of the road and other
relevant factors, such as heavy truck loading, prior to signing the Contract. Failure to
identify such factors placed the risk of their occurrence on Al Hani. Respondent contends
further that under Article 7, Al Hani accepted the correctness of the plans and specifications
it received from RBA. If these turned out to be incorrect as both Parties agree they were

the ensuing delays were again entirely at Al Hani’s risk. Thus, according to Respondent,
“[t]he changes in the maintenance method and pavement design fall clearly within Al-

Hani’s assumption of liability under Articles 5 and 7 of the Contract.”**>

Respondent stressed that Article 5 of the Misurata Contract made Al Hani responsible for
investigating and accepting “all circumstances” that might affect the work. It thus
shifted all risks that such conditions might affect performance of the contract away from

RBA and onto Al Hani.

Al-Hani assumed responsibility for any adverse effects that the

actual condition of the road could have on the performance of the

works. That included severe damage to the road, the traffic load and

the effects of inclement weather. Al-Hani, therefore, undertook the

risk of any adverse actual conditions by signing the Mirata [sic]

contract ...”86
Given the circumstances of the claim where contractor and employer agreed that the
scope of the work to be performed that was provided to the contractor did not reflect
realities on the ground Respondent also stresses Article 7 of the Contract.**” Respondent
maintains that, under this provision, “Al-Hani also assumed responsibility for any defects

in the drawings and other technical specification ‘as though [Al-Hani] had submitted

587 The text of Article 7 in the record is again similar, if not identical, to the version considered in connection with the
Benghazi Contract: “Any error or omission in any description, design or drawing submitted by the First Party, may be
corrected at any time. In addition, the Second Party shall personally verify the soundness of the specifications, designs
and drawings submitted thereto, and shall notify the First Party, at the appropriate time, of its remarks in regards
thereto. If it [i.e. the Second Party] accepts them [i.e. the specifications, designs and drawings], it shall be responsible
for them as though it had submitted them.”

them.’588 And, as with the Benghazi Contract, Respondent contends that Article 9 of the
Misurata Contract authorizes the employer to change the scope of work by up to 15%

without any additional compensation.°*

Respondent also contends, as it did in connection with the Benghazi Contract, supra, that
a maintenance method specified in RBA’s tender offer was not part of the Contract under
Libyan law, and Al Hani had no contractual right to rely on it.5°° The arguments advanced
are essentially those advanced in connection with the Benghazi Contract, and will not be

repeated here.

Respondent further contends that these claims are foreclosed by the terms of RBA’s
Variation Order No. 2, which contains language that Respondent contends bars Al Hani’s
claims for additional costs due to delay.*°' The arguments are again similar to those

advanced under the Benghazi claim.

Blackrock, Respondent’s quantification experts, maintain in their First Report that nothing
is due in respect of this claim, “primarily because the details provided did not allow proper
independent verification of the periods involved, the resources affected and their costs.”5°”
Blackrock’s Second Report again maintains that there is no liability, relying on the opinion

of Respondent’s expert Mr. Edwin?

that Al Hani bore responsibility for the claimed
delays and losses. Mr. Edwin’s opinion is in turn based on the opinion of Mr. El-Abesh,
the head of the TPB. As discussed infra, Blackrock’s expert Mr. Osbaldeston maintains
that, should the Tribunal find liability, any recovery should be calculated for shorter delay

periods and lower daily rates.

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis and De

 

ion Regarding the Basis of the Claim

519. The Nature of the Contract. In the Tribunal’s view, assessing the significant differences
between the Parties regarding Al Hani’s responsibility under the Misurata Contract again
requires consideration of the Contract’s specific terms. Article 1, defining the “Subject of

Contract,” defines Al Hani’s basic obligation:

The 2nd. Party [i.e., Al Hani] committed to execute the works of the
project: Maintenance of the Coastal Road, Misurata/ Sirte Sector
with all perfection and precision according to the provisions
hereunder: technical specifications, drawings, layouts, bills of
quantities, price schedules attached herewith and all what is to be
agreed for in writing regarding this contract at the specified
locations of the aforementioned sector. The 2nd. Party declares that
he reviewed all contract documents, the annexes thereof, well
understood and based on [these] he accepted contracting and to
execute in conformity with [them].

All documents and annexes mentioned above are deemed as
indivisible part of this contract.°%
520. Thus, Article 1 of the Misurata Contract commits Al Hani to perform specified work
according to the construction documents provided to it, an obligation echoed in Article 13.
There is no mention of an obligation for Al Hani to conduct a detailed survey of the road’s
condition and on that basis to design and secure the employer’s approval of a program to

reconstruct it. This is simply not what the Contract says.

521. Article 8, captioned “Project Management & Execution Time Schedule,” reinforces this

understanding of the Misurata Contract:

The 2nd. Party, within fifteen days as from the date of taking over
the site, must present for the Ist. Party a program clarifying the
methodology to be followed in the progress of works hereunder, the
time schedule to fulfill the work stages, arrangements to be taken
during the progress of work, equipment to be supplied for execution,
the temporary construction to be established and any others.

168

522.

$24,

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 180 of 337

Moreover, it shall amend this schedule based upon what the First

Party deems appropriate and the progress of the work.°>
The Contract thus gives Al Hani just fifteen days to develop its program to carry out the
specific work it agreed to perform, clearly too little time to carry out the type of detailed
survey and design work described by Mr. El-Abesh as required by the Contract. Article 25,
dealing with the calculation of the amounts of monthly claims for payment, again does not
conform to Respondent's conception of the Misurata Contract. It provides for monthly
computation of work performed based on actual measurement. There is no process or

metric for measuring design or engineering work.

The Tribunal thus does not believe that the Misurata Contract supports Respondent’s
characterization of Al Hani’s contractual responsibilities. Had RBA intended a contract
providing for the contractor to prepare detailed studies and the accurate pre-identification
of the maintenance method, it could have done so, as it did in the subsequent Garaboulli
Contract.** Instead, internal TPB correspondence from 2009 acknowledges that “the
maintenance project of the costal road has been contracted in full and in general without
the preparation of detailed studies and the accurate pre-identification of maintenance

method.”°?”

Respondent contends that Al Hani “knew full well” that it was standard practice of Libya
to enter into contracts based on rough estimates and not detailed studies.°°8 This, however,
is not how this Contract is worded. Moreover, the evidence for this description of Libya’s
general practice is unconvincing and inconsistent with Mr. El-Abesh’s testimony. While
he testified that the road maintenance contracts involving Al Hani were not based on

technical studies, he stated that this was not true of other road contracts: “As for the other

contracts, they are numerous, they were concluded with other companies, and they included
in the files technical and engineering studies very detailed and sophisticated.”°”” For their
part, Claimant’s witnesses clearly did not agree that Al Hani entered into a contract with

an undefined scope of work.°°

525. Article 5 of the Contract. The Tribunal explained its understanding of Article 5 in
connection with the Benghazi Claim, supra, and refers to that discussion in connection
with Respondent’s similar contentions here. It notes, however, that testimony at the
Hearing reinforces its view of the limited scope of a contractor’s obligations under Article
5 of the Misurata Contract. Mr. El-Abesh acknowledged at the Hearing that a contractor’s
pre-contracting inspection was necessarily limited and that the time available “was a few
months. You are speaking of a few months, less than a year. About four months, if I

recall.”©°' He acknowledged further that any inspection during this period was necessarily

limited:

Q. The surveys that were carried out before the award of the
Contracts would not be paid for by the Employer, would
they?

A. Do you mean the original BOQ that was used for the

Contract? Is that what you’re speaking about?

Q. No, I’m talking about any work that was done by a bidder
before they were given the Contract. That wasn’t to be paid
for, was it?

A. I’m not quite sure I’ve understood the question.

There is no work before the Contract. When there is no
contract, there is nothing to be done. Either I haven't
understood you--can you please clarify your question? It’s
not clear.

Q. So, I think you’ve answered the point that, before the
Contract is signed, there is nothing to be done, but I
was--you were saying that actually they were to perform
some survey?

A. Before signing the Contract, the company doesn’t do any
work which is paid for. This is normal.

Q. Yes. So, you would expect the Contractor only to do very
limited investigations prior to getting a contract, wouldn’t
you?

A Yes, 002

Article 7 of the Contract. Article 7 of the Misurata Contract figures more significantly in
Respondent’s arguments here than in the Benghazi claim, where the Claimant expected
and intended to proceed on the basis of the maintenance method it received from the
employer. The Tribunal is not persuaded, however, that Article 7 shifts to Al Hani all of
the risks and costs associated with the shortcomings of the employer’s description of the

work to be done.

The first sentence of Article 7 of the Misurata Contract recognizes that there may be errors
or omissions in “any description, design or drawing” provided by the employer, and that
these may be corrected. Article 7 thus recognizes that the employer’s documents may not
be the last word, and that experience may reveal errors or shortcomings. In light of this,
the second sentence directs the contractor to verify the soundness of the construction
documents it was given, checking them against the physical realities of the project. The
evidence shows that this is what Al Hani did at the time of the relevant events, thus, inter
alia, complying with the “timeliness” requirement in Article 7. It found that the
construction documents received from RBA did not match the realities of a badly
deteriorated road. It then did as the second sentence requires, notifying the employer of the

actual conditions of the road, launching a protracted process of assessment and redesign.

62 TR 5:1260:16 — 1261:20 (Mr. El-Abesh).

171

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 183 of 337

528. The Tribunal notes in this regard the undisputed testimony of Mr. McDevitt, who indicated
that when Al Hani gained access to the job site in July 2007, it began to verify whether the
drawings and specifications matched the realities of the road. It then promptly notified the
employer of the discrepancies between the “description, design or drawing” and the road’s

actual condition. Mr. McDevitt thus told the Tribunal at the Hearing that

if you look at the correspondence, we were notifying them from the
3rd of July forward of things that we were finding in the field.°°
[O]n the 3rd of July of that year, we did draw attention to the fact
that there were problems with how applicable this maintenance,
method of maintenance would be because of the deteriorated
condition of the highway or the road. And from that point forward,
of course, it eventually ended up that the whole thing had to be
changed, and we moved from a maintenance and repair-type project
to a complete reconstruction.°*
529. Thus, the Tribunal does not find Respondent’s interpretation of Article 7 of the Misurata
Contract to be persuasive or consistent with the article’s wording, the evidence of the

witnesses, or with international practice in the construction industry.
530. The Tribunal therefore rejects Respondent’s defense based on Article 7 of the Contract.

(3) Responsibility for the Maintenance Method Provided to the Contractor

531. Respondent contends that “the parties did not agree on a maintenance method in the
Misurata Contract.” As noted supra, the documents provided to potential bidders on the
Misurata project included a document setting out, section by section, the nature and extent
of maintenance work to be carried out on each portion of the road. The specified method
generally provided that limited resurfacing and other maintenance work was involved, not
a major rebuilding of the road. This document was included among the sealed documents

included in the record as part of the Misurata Contract.

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 184 of 337

In the event, however, Al Hani and the employer agreed that the road was substantially
more deteriorated than anticipated, and that significant reconstruction was required in lieu
of the maintenance method originally communicated to the contractor. The process of
assessing the state of the road, deciding on the methods and specifications for rebuilding
it, and providing implementing instructions to Al Hani, took many months. During this
period, resources mobilized for the project were largely idle, leading to Claimant’s First

Delay Claim.

Respondent contends, however, that the maintenance methods provided to prospective
bidders were not part of the Contract and did not define Al Hani’s responsibilities
thereunder. In the case of the similar document involved in the Benghazi Contract, Mr. El-

Abesh testified that these were merely a “description” of the work to be performed:

Q. [T]he tender documents also included information regarding
the method of working that you just referred to; didn’t they?
It’s the thin document, I think you said.

A. Yes. This document is an explanation of the different
maintenance points. There are designs, drawings when you
have to withdraw a layer of asphalt from the road, when you
have to grade the surface, how you have to go about
repairing, but this is not an official document. That is why
we do not consider it is a contractual document. It is not a
specification. It’s just a description.°°7
As evidence that the maintenance method given to bidders had no legal consequences,
Respondent again cites provisions of Libya’s contracting regulations listing documents
deemed to be part of a contract. The import of Respondent’s argument is that the employer
had no responsibility for delays resulting when the maintenance method it provided to
prospective bidders to guide preparation of their bids did not in fact reflect the much more

extensive work required.

(4) The Tribunal’s Conclusion Regarding Status of the Maintenance Method

The Tribunal does not accept Respondent’s contention that the maintenance method given
to Al Hani to guide preparation of its bid is contractually irrelevant. This argument is
inconsistent with normal business practice and with principles of fairness and good faith
governing interpretation and performance of contracts in Libya. An employer cannot in
good faith provide prospective contractors with a detailed schema showing the work they
are to perform under a contract, and then contend — after a contractor has committed to a
project and a price — that its description of the work to be performed is irrelevant, as

Respondent seems to contend.

In any case, in addition to the evidence previously cited,°*

in response to the Tribunal’s
request at the Hearing, Claimant provided a fuller copy of the Misurata Contract that
includes a copy of the management method document bearing the seal of RBA.°°?
Respondent acknowledges that the document was sealed by both parties to the Contract,
but contends that it was not signed by the RBA representative and that the absent signature
means that “this document and the maintenance method reflected therein were not
incorporated into the Misrata Contract.”°'° The Tribunal does not accept this argument,

which rests on an unpersuasive technicality.

The maintenance method was part of the Misurata Contract and could not be disregarded
without consequences. Further, as Claimant points out, even if this were not so, under
Article 1 of the Contract, it was obliged to follow the instructions given by the employer,
until the employer changed those instructions. Al Hani did not have the right under the

Misurata Contract to disregard RBA’s guidance defining the work it was to perform.

(5) Did the Variation Orders Extinguish Al Hani’s Delay Claims?

Respondent next contends that Al Hani waived its Delay Claims when it agreed to the terms
of Variation Order Nos. 1 and 2.°'' Respondent’s Counter-Memorial cites in this regard
item 3 of Variation Order No. 2: “The second party is not entitled to claim any increase in
the prices stated in the contract or claim any compensation resulting from the increase in

612

the value of the contract. Respondent also cites Article 99(c) of the Administrative

Contract Regulations, which it contends requires this result.°'>

Claimant denies that it waived its Delay Claims and disputes Respondent’s construction of
the quoted language. In Claimant’s view, the cited clause does not bar its Delay Claims,
but instead “mirrors the provision contained in Article 99 of the Administrative Contracts
Regulations that provides that additional works of up to an additional 15% of the contract
value will be performed under the contract’s original unit rates ...”¢'* The Tribunal believes
the analogy to the Administrative Contracts Regulations is informative, because it clarifies

the significance of the word “prices” plural.
Article 99 of the Administrative Contract Regulations provides:

The Contracting Body shall have the right to make amendment
modification to the contract object by increase or decrease within
the limits of the percentage to be agreed upon in the contract,
provided that total amendments shall not exceed (15%) (Fifteen
percent) of the original contract value, without any right to the
Contractor to claim for any amendment to the prices. The
Contracting Body may apply the provisions of paragraph (c) of
Article (60) to the value of amendments.°!*

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 187 of 337

Accordingly, the Tribunal does not understand the cited language of the variation orders in
the sense contended by Respondent. The first sentence says that the employer has the right
to increase or decrease the volume of work to be performed without “any amendment to
the prices.” The reference to “prices” — plural — is most reasonably understood, as Claimant
contends, to refer to the unit rates set by the Contract, such as the agreed unit prices for
materials such as aggregate, bitumen, or cement. This makes practical and commercial
sense. A project may increase or decrease in scale to reflect realities on the ground; within

the limited range of 15%, the agreed unit rates for the contractor’s inputs remain stable.

Indeed, in his Second Witness Statement, Mr. El-Abesh expresses the same understanding
of the very similar language of Article 9 of the Misurata Contract, confirming that the

reference to “prices” refers to unit rates:

When the value of the required works exceeded the estimated

contractual value by less than 15%, Al-Hani was required to perform

the works under a variation order using the existing contractual unit

rates and did not have the right to change the unit rates for the

additional quantities needed for performance.°!®
The meaning and relevance of the concluding clause of the cited provision in the Variation
Order No. 2: “or claim any compensation from the increase in the value of the contract” is
not clear. It is not literally correct, as the Variation Order did in fact authorize additional
compensation for Al Hani’s direct costs. It also is not relevant: the present claims are not
predicted upon “the increase in the value of the project,” but are for indirect costs allegedly

incurred on account of delay.

The Tribunal concludes that RBA/TBA’s Variation Orders did not bar or extinguish Al

Hani’s claims for damages allegedly resulting from delay.

[o]n 12 January 2010, Al Hani submitted to the Secretary of the

General People’s Committee for Transportation a report detailing

the delays caused by the RBA’s instructions and the associated costs

that Al Hani incurred as a result. Al Hani claimed, in particular,

additional costs incurred arising from (a) the revision of the scope

of works maintenance contract to a “full scale re-construction”; (b)

the RBA’s changes to the pavement design; and (c) the need to

replace the culverts.°!”
Through two variation orders, RBA agreed to compensate Al Hani for the direct costs
incurred from the changed maintenance method, the revised technical specification, and
the increased culvert work, but the variation orders did not reflect indirect costs resulting
from delay.°'® These included costs such as depreciation of equipment that sat idle during
periods of delay and costs of maintaining staff during periods of inactivity. In total, Al Hani
claims for delay of 519 days related to RBA’s alleged failures to respond in a timely way

to requests for decisions and instructions, at a daily rate of LYD 36,772/day.°"”

(7) The First Delay Period

Claimant seeks compensation for 215 days during this period, from 28 September 2007
through 30 April 2008.°°

The site was handed over on | July 2007, and RBA provided the advance payment in two
installments on 5 September 2007 and 10 September 2007.°! Soon after gaining access to
the site, Al Hani wrote to the RBA that “[t]he actual existing pavement condition is far
29622

worse than suggested by the Maintenance Methods given in the contract documents.

Instead, “a complete pavement renewal would be necessary.” Al Hani began some work,

but was instructed by the Engineer (Al-Mamar, RBA’s representative at the site) to halt as

cracks were discovered affecting the total cross section of the road.°**

Mr. El-Abesh confirms that “in mid-November we instructed Al-Hani to perform the
required studies and to determine the actual state of the road. Based on this, Al-Hani was
to propose a strategy for the maintenance of the road.”°> Mr. El-Abesh complains that Al
Hani’s subcontractor was slow in initiating this work.© The Tribunal observes in this
regard that a detailed survey was not part of Al Hani’s original duties under the Misurata
Contract, so a certain amount of time would have been required to identify and mobilize

resources to carry out the additional work.

The method for reconstruction was not finally defined and confirmed for many months. In
a 31 January 2008 meeting, RBA confirmed the need for long-term durability and asked
Al Hani to propose a new maintenance method. Al Hani did so, but its proposal was not
accepted.°?? On 6 March 2008, Al Hani wrote to the RBA stating that they had not received
instructions on how to proceed. A joint site inspection did not occur until 25 March 2008.°7*
Subsequent letters to RBA in April 2008 again cited the lack of instructions on how to
proceed.©°

According to Mr. El-Abesh, “on April 1, 2008 Al-Mamar [the supervising engineer]
approved the method of maintenance for the first 35 km section of the road,”**? but later
that month Al-Mamar, ordered additional changes. Al-Mamar then confirmed the approved
method in a letter dated 7 May 2008.°°! The changed method required significantly

increased quantities of materials, including large quantities of additional aggregates

different from those previously specified. In Claimant’s view, this “resulted in substantial

prolongation and loss of productivity along with substantial delay to the completion of all

activities.”°*? Claimant further contends that “this initial period was largely abortive.”°?

At the Hearing, Mr. McDevitt testified to the great impact of the change in the work to be

performed by Al Hani:

It changed from being a selective repair and maintenance to being a
total reconstruction. That is the radical change that we’re talking
about. That means — has ramifications in many ways — vastly
increased quantities of materials and so on.°*

Mr. El-Abesh agreed at the Hearing that the revised maintenance method was approved in
April 2008 and Variation Order No. | formally recording the employer’s changed
instructions was issued later in 2008.°°> The RBA subsequently agreed in Variation Order
No. 2 to authorize the additional materials required, but did not compensate Al Hani for

time-related depreciation and other delay costs.°%”

(8) The Tribunal’s Assessment of the First Delay Period

In addition to its arguments involving interpretation of the Contract, Respondent contends
that delays related to the Misurata Contract reflected lack of competence and effort on the

part of Strabag/Al Hani:

The lack of technical expertise from Strabag International’s staff,
including its engineers, coupled with the insufficiency of its
equipment strategy, posed major obstacles to its performance. As
explained below, Strabag International had trouble meeting its
scheduled obligations and had issues with quality, something
unexpected from a company representing itself as having “more
than 170 years of experience” in “80 countries.”°**

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 191 of 337

The Tribunal does not believe that the evidence supports Respondent’s characterization,
which is difficult to reconcile with HIB’s subsequent decision to enter into the extremely
large Tajura Contract with Al Hani. In the Tribunal’s view, the evidence shows that Al
Hani mobilized with appropriate dispatch, but then encountered a situation fundamentally
different from that reflected in the terms of the Contract. This resulted in several months
of severely limited activity as Al Hani carried out the detailed assessment of the road as
instructed by RBA in November 2007 and then awaited RBA’s revised instructions
regarding the work to be done. FTI concludes that “very little work could be accomplished

during this period, and what work was performed was largely abortive.”°??

The Tribunal finds that Claimant has established that Al Hani is entitled to recover its

indirect costs stemming from the delay incurred during this period.

Quantification of the First Delay Claim. In a submission to RBA dated 31 October 2010,
Al Hani submitted its claim for delay and an additional LYD50,000 for culvert design
work. The total claimed was LYD19,134,893, an amount that FTI concluded “in principle
is reasonable.”*? This submission included a detailed schedule of monthly costs for wages,
equipment, running costs, and other time-related expenses. The total monthly costs were
divided by 30 to give a daily rate of LYD36,772,™' the rate used to calculate the amount

of all three components of this claim.

The evidence of Respondent’s quantification experts does not assist the Tribunal in

assessing the amount of the First Delay Period Claim. Mr. Edwin, Respondent’s “critical
path” expert, accepted Mr. El-Abesh’s legal interpretations of Al Hani’s duties under the
Misurata Contract and Respondent’s interpretation of Article 7, concluding that no

642

compensation was due.°*” As noted, the Tribunal rejects both of these premises.

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 192 of 337

Blackrock’s First Quantum Report by Mr. Osbaldeston is similar. Mr. Osbaldeston also
accepts Respondent’s interpretation of Al Hani’s obligations under the Contract, further
suggesting that some progress was made during the delay period. FTI finds this analysis
“flawed” and “wrong,” contending that the evidence cited by Mr. Osbaldeston relates to a
sector of the road that is not subject to the Delay Claim.®> Mr. Osbaldeston objects as well
to the lack of detailed designs and specifications for the changed work, plant records, and
the similar detailed substantiation of the amounts claimed, leading him to conclude that “I

am unable to value this claim.”°4°

Mr. Osbaldeston’s Second Report is similar. He again values the claim at “nil,” based on
the opinion of Mr. Edwin, who in turn relied upon Mr. El-Abesh’s evidence interpreting
the Contract. Thus, Mr. Osbaldeston concludes: “I value this at NIL. My assessment is
based on the findings of Mr. Edwin that the delay resulted from Al Hani’s failure to

undertake its survey and to propose the method of maintenance in a timely manner.”°*”

While Mr. Osbaldeston regarded this portion of the claim as having a value of “nil,” he did
accept that some limited Delay Claims might be justified, and posited a daily rate of
LYD9,127 for these, referring to Annex 4.2 of his Second Report as substantiating this
figure. Annex 4.2 is a detailed Excel spreadsheet that lacks explanatory narrative. It does

not clarify to the Tribunal the basis for Mr. Osbaldeston’s estimated daily rate.

The Tribunal addresses the applicable daily rate below. As to the length of the delay,
Claimant seeks compensation for 215 days of delay from 28 September 2007 through 30
April 2008.* Mr. El-Abesh appears to agree that there was delay from September 2007
to April 2008, although he places the blame for the delay on Al Hani.™? Given Mr. El-

Abesh’s evidence, the Tribunal accepts 28 September 2007 through 30 April 2008 a
period of 215 days, as claimed by Claimant as the length of the First Delay Period.

(9) The Second Delay Period

563. The difference between the Parties with respect to the Second Delay Period essentially
concerns responsibility for rutting identified in the road in August 2008, after work got
underway following the First Delay Period. The rutting led the supervising engineer to
instruct a halt in the work pending clarification of its cause. Analysis showed that the
rutting was due to use of a prescribed asphalt mix that could not withstand the weight of

heavily overloaded trucks in summer heat.

564. Respondent contends that Al Hani was contractually obliged to conduct a survey that would
have identified that trucks on the Misurata road were often overloaded, and the rutting
proved that Al Hani had failed to conduct a proper survey. Respondent refers in this respect

to its contentions regarding Article 5 of the Contract:

Al-Hani reported that the changes in the maintenance method were
due to the severity of the damage to the road, and that the change in
the pavement design was due to heavier traffic than anticipated and
that the material used to repair the road was especially vulnerable to
rutting in the presence of high ambient temperature. Both of these
factors, i.e., traffic and weather conditions, are expressly within Al-
Hani’s assumed liability under Article 5 of the Contract.°°

565. Thus, according to Mr. El-Abesh:

[I]t was Al-Hani’s responsibility to perform a proper survey of the
road, including traffic load. If, as claimed by Al-Hani in October
2010, the rutting was being caused by higher than anticipated traffic
load, any delays caused by the required change in the asphalt mix to
address that problem can only mean that Al-Hani did not perform an
adequate survey in the first place. Had Al-Hani calculated the traffic
load properly, no rutting would have appeared and no necessary
corrective action would have been required.°°!

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 194 of 337

Mr. El-Abesh added that once the rutting occurred, it was Al Hani’s responsibility to

identify the proper mix formula to correct it, and that Al Hani was slow in doing so:

It took Al-Hani several months to present the necessary studies and

to prepare and propose the mix formula for the project. Neither RBA

nor Al-Mamar could give any new instructions without these.

Therefore, it is very surprising that Claimant now brings a claim for

delay when it was Al-Hani that caused these delays.°*
For its part, Claimant contends that “the rutting was due to the out of date and inadequate
pavement design specification for the traffic loadings and the poor quality of the available
bitumen.”©*? Mr. McDevitt stated that on 13 December 2007, RBA provided the Technical
Specifications that Al Hani was to follow in its work;®4 RBA’s cover letter referred to the
Misurata Contract and stated that the specification were provided “for compliance and
successful implementation.”®*> The Technical Specifications document stated that a paving
mixture created pursuant to the specifications it contained “may be considered satisfactory
for heavier [traffic loads] if [that] occurs.”°° The rutting showed that RBA’s Technical

Specifications were not correct in this crucial regard, leading Mr. McDevitt to conclude:

The fact that the Project faced delays because the outdated

prescribed Maintenance Method and Technical Specifications

needed to be revised to cope with the actual state of the roadway was

the responsibility of the RBA and not Al Hani as Mr. El Abesh

suggests.°°7
Respondent does not dispute that RBA provided Al Hani with detailed specifications for
the work it was to perform. Exhibit C-454 is an Addendum to the Misurata Contract signed
and sealed by RBA specifying that Al Hani’s offer was predicated in part on Libya’s
“General Technical Specifications Book for Road Construction.” The December 2007

version of the specifications given to Al Hani appears to be a limited revision of these.

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 195 of 337

Respondent does not contend that Al Hani failed to comply with RBA’s specifications.
Instead, Respondent’s argument seems at its core to be that the Contract required Al Hani’s
duty to identify the inadequacy of RBA’s specifications in light of existing conditions and

to propose an alternative.

The Tribunal addressed supra and in connection with the Benghazi claim Respondent’s
contentions regarding Articles 5 and 7 of the Contract. In the Tribunal’s view,
Respondent’s reliance on those articles here does not accurately reflect Al Hani’s duties
under the Contract. Under Article 1, Al Hani agreed to work in accordance with the
specifications it was given. There is no claim that it failed to do so. The Tribunal does not
accept Respondent’s contention that the Contract also required Al Hani to identify
shortcomings in those specifications and to conduct the engineering work required to

identify how RBA should change them.

It is also clear from the record that, after a recommended solution was identified following
laboratory tests in Germany, many months elapsed as RBA assessed the solution,
negotiated with Al Hani over price and details of application of the recommended polymer,

and finally approved procurement of the required material so that work could resume.

Al Hani claims that it encountered 288 days of delay as the solution for the rutting was
identified and as RBA considered and eventually authorized the solution. Claimant
contends that this period “from 18 August 2008 to 1 June 2009 was essentially non-
productive, and resulted in the requirement to increase the amount of time required for the

works on the road.”°5%

The Tribunal concludes on the basis of the evidence that Al Hani is entitled to recover its
indirect costs resulting from this period of 288 days of delay. The Tribunal considers infra

the appropriate daily rate to be used in assessing compensation for this delay.

(10) The Third Delay Period

As summarized supra, Claimant contends that early in the project, Al Hani identified the
need to repair or replace 45 culverts. However, there was no joint inspection of the culverts
until 7 April 2008, after which RBA agreed they should be replaced,° leading to
additional changes to the scope of work®” and further delays pending RBA’s decision on
the new culverts’ design. Mr. McDevitt’s Second Witness Statement refers to multiple
unanswered requests to RBA for guidance regarding the culverts, beginning in December
2007 and culminating in a 17 May 2008 instruction from the engineer to rebuild the culverts
using a design provided by RBA.®! Al Hani responded, inter alia, that the RBA design
was for culverts of one meter diameter, but ten of the existing culverts were two meters.°©?
Difficulties and a substantial correspondence then ensued over several months regarding
quality of concrete provided by a local supplier, a request that Al Hani provide designs for
the two meter culverts (which was done), and other issues.° This sequence concluded
with RBA on 4 January 2009 instructing Al Hani to proceed with construction of the

culverts based on instruction contained in the engineer’s letter of May 2008.°°*

Mr. El-Abesh’s understanding of this complicated course of events is different. In his view:

The supposed design problems to which Mr. McDevitt refers
pertained to 8 culverts only, and these were required to be designed
by Al-Hani. Al-Hani took roughly four months to submit its full
designs for those 8 culverts, and only provided its commercial
proposal for these culverts on November 13, 2008. Thus, it is clear
that it was Al-Hani itself that delayed the completion of these
culverts.

Even if it were true that RBA was responsible for the design and that
the J&P design was provided to Al-Hani for the 8 culverts, under
Article 7 of the Misrata Contract Al-Hani is deemed to be
responsible for the designs as if it had submitted them.°°°

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 197 of 337

The Tribunal has previously rejected Respondent’s interpretation of Article 7 of the
Misurata Contract. It also finds Mr. El-Abesh’s response to Mr. McDevitt’s chronology of
complaints insufficient to rebut a chronicle of slow responses and slow decision-making in

RBA regarding the culverts.

Claimant contends that the period required to settle on the design for the culverts extended
for 519 days. However, most of this overlapped with periods involved in its First and
Second Delay Claims. Accordingly, this claim is for only 16 days, reflecting the
“difference between the total amount claimed for the culverts, 519 days, and the total of

the first two claims (503 days).”°°

The Tribunal finds Respondent responsible for an additional 16 days of delay related to the
culverts. The Tribunal considers below the daily rate to be applied in determining damages

for the three delay periods.

(11) The Daily Rate

The Tribunal thus finds in favor of Claimant’s claim for compensation for 519 days of
delays in the Misurata project on account of various instances in which the scope of work
under the Contract had to be revised and the employer did not provide timely and
appropriate directions. Claimant seeks compensation for this delay at the rate of
LYD36,772/day.” This figure is therefore significant in assessing the amount of

compensation that may be due.

Al Hani’s calculations for determining the daily rate are in Annex 2 of a submission sent
to the Secretary of the General People’s Committee for the Implementation of
Communications Projects dated 31 October 2010. This lists, inter alia, a monthly charge
of LYD400,000 for depreciation of equipment; LYD259,100 for salaries, taxes and
insurance; LYD233,200 for wages and food for 320 local and third-country employees;
and LYD46,900 for running costs, rentals and maintenance at site. The subtotal of expenses
is then increased for 5.25% for “Finance Cost,” 3.5% for “Local Overhead,” and 6.5% for

“Overseas overhead.”

The amounts claimed in Annex 2 were not analyzed by Claimant’s quantification experts
at FTI. They instead built up alternative daily rates based on the available evidence that in
aggregate exceeded the rate claimed by Claimant,®° leading FTI to conclude that the

claimed rate was reasonable. FTI’s First Quantum Report further observed:

[I]n respect of each claim, we have reviewed the basis of claim and
discussed with Strabag employees the methodology adopted by Al
Hani to calculate the costs incurred by it. In our view as construction
experts, the claims made by Al Hani are reasonable in principle, as
is the methodology adopted by Al Hani to determine the amounts
that it has claimed.°”

Blackrock’s quantification expert Mr. Osbaldeston did not engage with this figure in his
First Quantum Report, finding insufficient supporting records to assess any portion of the
amounts claimed.°’' His Second Report concludes that there was no liability because Al

Hani did not meet its contractual obligations.°””

However, this report appears to accept the
possibility that compensation for a limited number of days of delay might be justified. In
that case, Mr. Osbaldeston posits daily rates of variously LYD9,018 for the initial period

of change in scope and LYD9,127 for the period of delay on the culverts.°?

Mr. Osbaldeston’s analysis in his Second Report of the daily rate claimed by Claimant is
not clear to the Tribunal. His Annex 4.2 is a dense spreadsheet with no accompanying
clarifying narrative. Mr. Osbaldeston expresses a clearer view where he suggests that the
claimed costs for delay might have been, at least in part, already recovered through
Payment Certificates. However, the Tribunal disagrees. Payment Certificates only
remunerate physical works progressively executed, measured and priced by multiplying

unit rates for relevant quantities. They cannot cover for idle time costs.

Mr. Osbaldeston was also unclear when invited by Tribunal Members to clarify his view
on the matter.°” In criticizing Claimant’s BRVZ accounting system used in this and other
claims, he expressed “concerns” as to whether the daily rates applied to recover
prolongation costs reflected “actual costs incurred,” an issue “that raises an alarm bell for
me.” He also seemed to have misunderstood elements of the claim, referring to the
possibility that Claimant included risks allowances, rather than costs incurred. This is
contradicted by Claimant’s list of cost items provided to the IBCP on 31 October 2010.°7
Each item unquestionably refers to actual costs already incurred; there is no risk allowance

for future events.

(12) The Tribunal’s Analysis and Decision Concerning the Daily Rate and
Compensation Due

The Tribunal is faced with the following situation: Respondent’s primary defense to this
claim is that time-related costs resulting from delays were, under the Contract, risks
undertaken by Claimant, a position the Tribunal does not accept. Respondent’s expert
disputes the daily rate claimed, primarily with questions and expressions of skepticism that
do not materially assist the Tribunal. For their part, Claimant’s experts endorse “as
construction experts” the validity of Al Hani’s methodology in calculating the costs
incurred, but do not assess the specific amounts claimed, instead developing their own

hypothetical aggregate daily rate higher than the rate claimed by Al Hani.°”

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 200 of 337

The Tribunal is thus left with the task of evaluating the quantum of the present claim using
its own discretion and understanding of the factual and documentary evidence on the
record. Al Hani’s detailed (114-page) explanation of the amount claimed at Exhibit C-127
provides much useful information; References 6 through 21 of that document show that
Respondent and Al Hani attended several meetings and shared continuing written
exchanges during 2008 and 2009 in order to define the specific design parameters needed
to remedy the insufficient tender data or inadequate specifications to allow the work to
proceed. The evidence shows that the Respondent’s essential approvals of the engineering

solutions finally adopted were constantly late, a recurring cause of delays.

The file also reflects several joint site inspections made by Respondent and Al Hani. The
Tribunal infers that Respondent therefore could not be unaware of the continuing presence
at site of Al Hani’s resources, principally construction materials, equipment and personnel,
during the long non-working periods. Respondent was thus in a position to assess from the
observations of RBA’s personnel whether the daily rate claimed by Claimant was
appropriate or not, but there is no indication that it made any effort to do so. The Tribunal
further notes that Claimant’s witness Mr. McDevitt attended all meetings and inspections
of 2008 and 2009 and thus has detailed direct personal knowledge of the relevant
circumstances. The Tribunal must give appropriate weight to his testimony, in particular
to his statement whereby “we calculated the total site costs incurred during these delays for
general site overheads, staff salaries, labour wages, plant and equipment, financing charges
and head office overheads at a rate of LYD36,772.433 per day, resulting in an overall cost
of LYD19,134,892."677

The Tribunal finds that the list of Al Hani’s claimed delay costs in Annex 2 of Exhibit
C-127 depicts logically and correctly a construction site and the principal cost items. The
Tribunal sees no inconsistency or apparent disproportion in the amounts attributed to each
item, and any discount or modification of specific items by the Tribunal would prove
arbitrary in the absence of any better evidence. The costs in the breakdown in Annex 2 do

not appear excessive, given the dimension of the site in question, the significant number of

workers and employees, the magnitude of materials, plants and equipment imported to
Libya, and the corresponding financing disbursements. Notwithstanding Mr. Edwin’s
evidence questioning the extensions, the amount of time actually approved by the employer

is not disputed. The costs listed at that time total LYD1,103,1 rig heae

The Tribunal therefore accepts the daily rate calculated by Al Hani reflected in Annex No.
2, except for the two overhead items, namely “local” and “overseas” overhead. First,
overheads generally include a profit component, and are indeed used to build up a new
price, not to determine the amount of a pure cost. Second, parts of the local overheads are
already accounted for in the site running costs. Third, the Tribunal does not accept that the
so-called overseas overheads, apparently incurred by Claimant, should be considered in the
present context. The Tribunal presumes that its Austrian headquarters expenses, usually
compensated through overheads, were not overburdened due to the suspensions and

resulting delays in Libya.

Accordingly, the Tribunal deducts from the claimed monthly costs in Annex No. 2 the
amounts of LYD33,502.00 for local overheads and LYD62,218.00 for overseas overheads,
in total LYD95,720, leaving a monthly cost of LYD1,007,453. The daily rate awarded by
the Tribunal is therefore LYD33,582. (LYD1,007,453: 30 LYD33,582).

Applying this daily rate to the 519 days claimed by Claimant results in a total of
approximately LYD17,429,000. According to FTI’s Second Report, Annex 2, paragraph 3
of the Misurata Contract establishes LY D1.72/€1 as the applicable exchange rate under the
Contract.°”? Applying this rate, the amount due for this claim equals €10.133 million. The
Tribunal awards this amount in respect of the Misurata claim pursuant to Article 8(1) of

the Treaty.

CLAIMS 4 AND 5, PART III. TAJURA CONTRACT: INTRODUCTION AND FIRST DELAY
CLAIM

(1) Introduction: The Claims

Pursuant to Article 8(1) of the Treaty, Claimant also seeks substantial amounts for
additional uncompensated costs incurred and work performed under the Tajura Contract.
The Tajura project was by far the largest project undertaken by Al Hani in Libya. It
involved extensive design and construction work in connection with a major urban
development in Tajura, a city roughly 20 km from Tripoli.°*° As described by Respondent’s
witness Mr. Baryon at the Hearing, “[i]ndeed, the Tajura Work was very complex. It
covered roads, main water network, sewage network, and traffic design, so it was a huge

Project ...°°8!

Claimant seeks payment in respect of several payment certificates that were approved by
HIB’s representative but were not paid. These claims are addressed supra, in connection
with Strabag’s claims for unpaid payment certificates and need not be considered here. In
addition, Claimant makes two claims for delay-related losses and a third for additional
unpaid work in connection with the Tajura project and certain emergency road repairs. As
quantified in the presentation of Claimant’s valuation expert at the Hearing,®*? Claimant

seeks:

-  €8,716,301 for indirect costs related to the delayed commencement of work following

conclusion of the contract;

- €16,220,240 for additional indirect costs caused by delays after notice to proceed was

given in June 2009; and

- €6,341,831 for work performed, but not compensated pursuant to HIB’s Requests for
Proposals (“RFPs”) Nos. 4 and 8, and for emergency repair work on the 11" of June
Road leading to Tripoli’s International Airport late in 2009. (Although the road repair
work was not in the Tajura area, payment for emergency repairs on the 11" of June

Road was “rolled into” HIB’s Tajura project for administrative purposes.)

(2) The Tajura Contract

Al Hani and HIB initially signed the Tajura Contract at an inaugural ceremony on 26
November 2007. Following delays that apparently included slow demobilization by an
incumbent contractor®* and review and revision of the initial Contract by REKABA,°**
the revised Tajura Contract was then signed on 18 May 2008.°% It established a global

price of approximately LYD780 million.°°°

Article | of the Tajura Contract commits Al Hani to “execute the integrated utilities project
for the city of Tajura, including execution of the water, sewage and rainwater drainage
networks, the pumping stations, the sanitation water collection tanks, the upper water tank,
the filtration tanks, as well as the road, pavement and street light networks.” Clause “d” of
Annex IA specifies “[t]he execution and detailed design will be based on the VEGAWERK
[sic] design.” Clause “f” of that Annex specifies that “[t]he stormwater network will be
based on seepage tanks execution confirmation will be after soil investigation and

study.”687

The “Particular Conditions” in Annex IB of the Tajura Contract include, inter alia,
Condition 4 addressing payment for “the completion of the FEGA WERK design and
modified version of the Storm Water Network with Seepage Reservoirs ...°°*8 Condition 6
defines the scope of work to include “Completion of the FEGA WERK design and detailed

design” and “Modified version of the Storm Water Network with Seepage Reservoirs.”°*?

Clause 16 of Annex 1B provided: “In the unlikely event of a delay to the Works by the
First Party, the Second Party shall be entitled to extension of time for the Contract Period

and the Second Party entitle to claim compensation according to law regulations.”°%

Pursuant to Article 7 of the Contract, Al Hani was to verify the soundness or omissions in
Fegawerk’s design, propose to HIB variations or alterations to make the preliminary design

workable, and wait for HIB’s approval before performing the authorized variations.

HIB appointed two supervising engineers to oversee Al Hani’s performance of the
Contract. One was AECOM Libya Housing and Infrastructure, Inc., the Libyan subsidiary
of the American firm AECOM. AECOM was appointed by HIB to provide technical and
managerial oversight for all of HIB’s projects in Libya. The second was the Japanese
consulting firm NJS Consultants Limited (“NJS”), which was responsible for engineering

supervision in the Tajura project.

The work initially specified in the Contract was to be increased over time pursuant to
several RFPs for additional design and construction work.®”' RFP I related to a project that
was cancelled. As discussed infra, additional work pursuant to RFPs 2, 3, 5, and 6 was

eventually incorporated into Modification Order No. 2 (“MO 2”).°?

(3) The First Delay Claim
A. Introduction: Factual Background

As presented by Claimant’s quantification experts from FTI at the Hearing, Al Hani seeks
€8,716,301 for costs related to the delayed commencement of work on the Tajura
project.°?

The basic design for the project was developed by a Swiss firm, Fegawerk. As noted above,
the Tajura Contract provided that Al Hani was to complete the Fegawerk design, and
prepare a more detailed design based on that design. Al Hani was also to design a “Storm

Water Network with Seepage Reservoirs” and 48 km of roads and street lighting.°*

Initial site handover occurred on 7 October 2008. The initial 75% of the advance payment

was paid on 25 October 2008, with the balance paid on 5 March 2009.

The evidence indicates that Al Hani began work on the project even before the second
signing of the Contract in May 2008, including site preparation, identifying vendors and
quarries, mobilizing personnel and equipment, and beginning review of the design
documents. It also reviewed the Fegawerk basic design documents, which were revised
in response to Strabag’s comments.°?’ According to a December 2010 Report by NJS,
Respondent’s supervising engineer, “the Contractor commenced work on his site
installation area on 3™ June 2008 and held a design issues presentation on 1° July 2008
despite the fact that Notice to Proceed was not issued until | year later on 24" June

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 206 of 337

According to the First Consolidated Monthly Report prepared by NJS for the period August
2008 to March 2009, “[c]ontractor has fully mobilized in anticipation of fast start of
construction.”°? According to Claimant’s witness Mr. Dohring, Al Hani’s Tajura Project

Manager at Tajura during this period:

[A]t the outset of the project, we took the basic design drawings

prepared by Fegawerk, including for the water supply and the

sewerage network, then worked to modify and complete them, and

prepare the detailed design on the basis of the Fegawerk design. We

provided to the HIB a detailed presentation in which we reported on

the design for the project (including both the Fegawerk design and

the design that we and [a sub-contractor] had prepared). We also

started activities on the project, including on the road works and

water supply, both of which were based on the original Fegawerk

basic design.”
During this period, again according to NJS’s First Consolidated Monthly Report, “[i]t is
apparent that the Contractor anticipated very little design modification and has indicated

that he expected to confirm and construct the Fegawerk designs without modification.”!

As noted supra, the Tajura Contract specified that Al Hani was to work on the basis of the
basic Fegawerk design. However, at some point in 2008, HIB and AECOM decided to
utilize a different set of national design criteria developed by AECOM to harmonize all of

HIB’s infrastructure projects in Libya.”

In November 2008, NJS gave Al Hani a CD containing the new AECOM design criteria,
but the CD was not accompanied by any clear direction regarding the new criteria.” In a
24 November 2008 letter to HIB, Mr. Dohring responded that the Contract “is based on the

General Specification of Implementation Board of Housing and Infrastructure and the

Fegawerk Technical Report, Specifications and Drawings.”74 He stated that the new
AECOM design was in many respects different from the Fegawerk design, and that its
application would result in “a considerable delay in time and an increase in the total project
costs.” The letter stated further that if this new design was to be adopted, Al Hani would

require formal instructions.”°>

Following Mr. Dohring’s request for written instructions regarding the change in Al Hani’s
work under the Contract, a 22 January 2009 letter from Mr. Sterry, NJS’s senior
representative on the project, directed Al Hani to abandon the “abortive” Fegawerk criteria

and to adopt the new AECOM design criteria. Inter alia, the NJS letter stated:

You are hereby instructed that any design work hence forth carried
out by you for this project which is based solely upon the Fegawerk
design criteria, concepts and details will be considered abortive
work. It has been made clear to NJS that no approvals for
construction may be issued for designs prepared in this manner
which do not comply with Aecom design criteria and modified
concepts. It should be clear that the intention is that the review and
modification process be a rigorous and complete review and
redesign prior to construction.

For your guidance, the following is an outline of the approach which
will be followed

1) This letter is issued to immediately halt abortive design work

being undertaken based on Fegawerk criteria.7°
The NJS letter specified that a modification order would be issued addressing extensive
changes in the substance and timing of Al Hani’s work. These included requiring Al Hani
“to adopt the HIB/AECOM design criteria as issued (including those under development)
as the basis for all project designs,” and to modify the project designs and construction

schedule.

The letter also called for Al Hani to carry out several large additional tasks not covered by
the existing Contract, pursuant to RFPs to be issued to include power, gas, and
telecommunications design and construction work. It also informed Al Hani that the
seepage pond system for storm water specified in the Contract was rejected in favor of an
alternative using a few large ponds, with overflow to the sea “with criteria to be prepared
by Aecom.” The letter concluded that NJS “look[s] forward to your cooperation in

reformulating and redesigning this project.” 77

There followed a period of several months during which Al Hani discarded or revised
design work previously done based on the Fegawerk designs and developed alternative
designs utilizing the new design criteria. At the Hearing, Claimant’s witness Mr. Dohring
explained the extent of changes required by the instruction to adopt the new design criteria
and to undertake significant new design work.’°* Al Hani was unable to carry out
significant construction work for the period required for the replacement designs for that

work to be developed, reviewed, and approved.

Ultimately, HIB issued a preliminary Notice to Proceed on the TC 5 Roadway on 24 June

2009. HIB did not at the time complain of delays attributable to Al Hani.’°°

B. Claimant’s Position

Claimant claims €8,716,301 for Al Hani’s indirect and delay costs for the 13-month period
between the date of signature of the final version of the Tajura Contract (18 May 2008)
and the date it was given Notice to Proceed on the TC5 Roadway on 24 June 2009.’"°
Claimant maintains that HIB’s change in design criteria and the 22 January 2009
instruction to cease work based on the Fegawerk criteria significantly delayed Al Hani’s

performance of the Contract and led to substantial inefficiencies and delay costs. According

707 C.37, Letter from NJS to Al Hani dated 22 January 2009, p. 2.

to Mr. Dohring, the claimed costs “comprised plant and equipment costs (including
depreciation and repair costs), labour costs and salaries, rent and running costs of buildings,

bond, guarantee and insurance costs.”7!!

Claimant refers, inter alia, to contemporary correspondence and to the testimony of Mr.
Dohring to show the extent of effort prior to the 22 January 2009 NJS letter that was wasted
and the impact of the changes set out in that letter on subsequent work. According to Mr.
Dohring “[e]ffectively, we were being asked to go back to square one and start our work

on the project from scratch.”7!?

Claimant maintains that the impact of the 22 January 2009 changes was understood and
accepted by AECOM and NJS. Inter alia, Claimant points to the agreed minutes of a 30
January 2 February 2009 workshop convened to address the changes’ impact and to

determine the way forward:

It was agreed between AECOM, NJS and Al Hani that changes in
design and phasing of the works will modify parts of the already
executed design works as of 22" January 2009 and Al Hani will
include the cost for any such works in their response to RFPs. It is
agreed that Al Hani has mobilized according to the agreed program
and is not able to start the works as planned. Accordingly the cost
of idle time and/or inefficient mobilized resources will be included
into the RFP.”

Claimant contends that during the initial thirteen-month period, NJS, HIB and AECOM
several other times acknowledged Al Hani’s entitlement to additional compensation and

gave assurances that additional costs would be compensated. For example, on 27 March

2009, NJS stated:

[Y]ou should rest assured that any unforeseen costs which you can

reasonably demonstrate to have resulted from directions given by

NJS and AECOM, accepted by you in good faith, will be fairly and

professionally evaluated, and recommended for payment if not

covered by existing or modified contract provisions. 7!
With respect to the amount of its claim, Claimant refers to the positive assessment of its
quantification experts from FTI and rejects the opinion of Respondent’s quantification
expert Mr. Osbaldeston, who values both of Claimant’s Delay Claims at nil.7!° FTI
contends in this regard that Mr. Osbaldeston’s opinion is “flawed and appears to be based,
in part, on legal/contractual opinions.”’!® Claimant further contends that his opinion is

inconsistent with much contemporaneous documentation and Mr. Dohring’s evidence.’!”

Claimant disputes the objections of local accountants retained by NJS who rejected
significant amounts of this claim, ’!* deeming their objections unreasonable and formalistic.
According to Mr. Déhring, in response to the accountants’ concerns, Al Hani on 10
November 2009 submitted additional explanations and supporting documents.’!° These are
said to have explained “the basis for our calculation of the depreciation costs related to the
plant and equipment for the project (in respect of which we provided three alternatives),
provided evidence of the location of the idle equipment, provided substantiation of our
costs (with reference to invoices), eliminated any double-counting in the calculations,
checked and re-submitted staff lists and provided details of salary costs.””** However, the
accountants “continued to make very formal objections, for example, stating that we had
provided copies and not originals, or that the suppliers’ invoices were not consistent with

Tax Department requirements ...”7?!

™m

Claimant denies that it failed to mitigate.’ In this regard, NJS’s Second Monthly Report

for the period April 2009 June 2009 records:

The contractor has partially demobilized due to the interruption to
design process brought about post 22 January 2009 and the
anticipated delays to approval of RFPs prior to recommencement of
design activities. Some plant has been removed from site to other
projects in order to minimize the claim for idle equipment.”>

C. Respondent’s Position

Respondent disputes Claimant’s compensation claims for the First Delay Period.
Respondent advances in this regard arguments based on Article 5, 7 and 9 of the Tajura
Contract similar to those advanced in the Misurata and Benghazi Contracts. (These three
provisions appear to have been standard in the contracts concluded by Strabag/Al Hani

with its Libyan counterparts.)

Respondent first contends that under Article 5 of the Tajura Contract, Al Hani was obliged
to inspect the job site and familiarize itself with conditions potentially affecting the
project.”4 In Respondent’s contention, a proper inspection would have revealed the

shortcomings of the Fegawerk designs. >

Respondent further contends that Article 7 of the Tajura Contract obliged Al Hani to review
the plans and specifications for the project and to identify promptly any deficiencies, and
that this obligation made it “responsible for addressing any problems with the Fegawerk
design.””° Citing the evidence of Mr. Baryon, Respondent maintains that there were
multiple flaws in the Fegawerk designs, so that “Al-Hani was responsible for fixing the
Fegawerk designs even if there had never been new AECOM design criteria,” flaws that

Al Hani did not correct.”7

Respondent maintains that Al Hani did not make necessary revisions to the Fegawerk
designs, citing “Al-Hani’s refusal to assess and modify the Fegawerk designs as
required.”’* In this regard, emphasizing the evidence of Mr. Baryon, Respondent contends
that the Fegawerk designs clearly were deficient, and that this should have been apparent
to Al Hani. Indeed, Respondent maintains that the defects in the Fegawerk design were
brought to Al Hani’s attention prior to contracting, citing a letter to Al Hani on 15 March
2010.”° Having agreed to work on the basis of these designs, Al Hani bore responsibility
for their shortcomings, so the time required to develop appropriate replacement designs

was at Al Hani’s risk and expense, not Respondent’s.

Respondent further contends that Article 9 of the Tajura Contract authorized HIB to revise
the scope of the project by 15% without any additional compensation to Al Hani.”° This
apparent import of this contention is that the decision to abandon the Fegawerk criteria was
a limited revision of the project’s scope not warranting additional compensation.
Respondent maintains in this regard that the changes required by the 22 January 2009 letter
were of limited consequence. Mr. Baryon thus stated at the Hearing that these changes
required by the new design criteria were minor, and involved only “slight changes to the

designs.””>!

Again emphasizing Mr. Baryon’s evidence,’*? Respondent contends that Al Hani’s work
was in any event poorly done. “Al-Hani’s poor management and design coordination was
the most significant factor in the delayed commencement of construction on the Tajura
Project. Most problematic and surprising was its poor design work.””*> Respondent also
criticizes Al Hani for delays associated with Al Hani’s insistence on a Modification Order

revising and expanding the scope of work under the Contract. Respondent dismisses Al

Hani’s insistence on securing a Modification Order as “excuses” and an attempt “to shift

the blame for its delays to HIB, NJS and AECOM.”74

With respect to Claimant’s claim for damages, Respondent’s quantification expert Mr.
Osbaldeston values the claim at nil, “based on the assumption that the Commencement

Date was 18 June 2009 therefore up to this point Strabag was proceeding at risk.”7>°

Should the Tribunal not agree with this legal conclusion, Mr. Osbaldeston also refers to a
review of Al Hani’s claims for this period carried out by accountants retained by NJS and
summarized in a December 2010 NJS Report. This report reflects NJS’s judgment
recognizing claims of LYD8,631,195 during this initial period.”*° Mr. Osbaldeston
calculates that should the Tribunal find that Al Hani was not proceeding “at risk,” the Delay
Claims during the First Delay Period should be calculated at a daily rate of between

LYD24,019 and LYD26,585 per day.”>”

D. The Tribunal’s Analysis and Decision

The Tribunal finds that Claimant is entitled to recover for Al Hani’s indirect costs incurred
on account of delays during the thirteen-month period between May 2008 and June 2009.
The Tribunal agrees in this regard with the assessment of HIB’s supervising engineer, NJS,
that “the original contract is not a design and build type contract,” a position NJS finds

“fully supported by examination of the original contract documents.”7**

629. The evidence shows that even before the final signing of the Tajura Contract in June 2008,
Al Hani began both substantial mobilization and work to revise and supplement the
Fegawerk designs. As examined infra, the evidence further shows that after being
instructed by NJS to cease work based on Fegawerk designs, previously completed design
work had to be redone or discarded. Further, Al Hani was placed in a position of

significantly reduced activity during which it incurred substantial indirect and delay costs.

630. The Tribunal finds Respondent’s contentions that the Fegawerk design was not “revised

39739

wholesale’ and involved only “minor” changes unconvincing and inconsistent with the

record. In response to the Tribunal’s question at the Hearing, Mr. Dohring described the

significance of the changed standards:

Q. [C]an you give us some practical illustrations of how that
changed the nature of the design task? We’ve heard in very
abstract ways it was a fundamental change, but in concrete
terms, what did that mean for you and your design people?

A. What does it mean?

If you’re starting a design in a certain country or certain area,
you’re not doing it out of your mind. You have some basic
standards which you have to apply. In Paris you have some
standards, and in Germany different standards, and in
America different standards.

And these standards you have to work with. You have to
calculate, for example, the requirement of the people, you
can use maybe 100-liter per day or 10-liter or 200-liter per
day, and this is fixed in the standards. With the quantity of
water, you have to decide the size of the pipes, for example.
With size of the pipes, you have to decide the size of the
pump to pump the water out, and this is the whole role.

Therefore, the specification is the basis for everything,
wherever your calculation starts.“

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 215 of 337

NJS’s 22 January 2019 letter deeming further work predicated on the Fegawerk criteria
“abortive” recognized the impact of the new design criteria. The evidence shows that, even
if elements of the Fegawerk design could be retained, as Respondent claims, they had to
be revised to assure compliance and compatibility with the new AECOM design. In cross-
examination, Mr. Dohring disputed the contention that portions of Al Hani’s design work

were not affected by the changed criteria.

Q. And, obviously, there are some areas where there is no
difference; right?

A. I don’t think so because FEGA WERK design is based on a
European standard and AECOM design is based on
American standards, and they’re completely different. You
cannot pick one of them and pick one of them, you work a
little bit as part American, and work a little bit as part
European, that will not work. You need a complete
specification standard and drawings which are similar to the
whole Project.”4!
Multiple documents emanating from or endorsed by HIB or its representatives
acknowledged Al Hani’s right to compensation for loss and delay resulting from the
changed design criteria. Thus, the signed minutes of the “design workshop” convened
among Al Hani, HJS, and AECOM in late January and early February 2009, quoted supra,
show that Respondent’s representatives understood and accepted the significant
consequences of the 22 January 2009 changes for Al Hani. The minutes record that Al Hani
mobilized “according to the agreed program and is not able to start the works as planned,”
and that “the cost of idle and/or inefficient mobilized resources will be included into the

REP.”72

633. Similarly, on 19 February 2009, NJS sent a “Road Map” to AECOM that was copied to Al
Hani. This listed the RFPs that HIB needed to issue to cover the additional work specified
in the 22 January 2009 letter, and identified the need for Al Hani to identify its Delay
Claims stemming from redesigning the project.”“? The Road Map noted the extensive

changes required by the HIB’s change in direction, citing:

- A change from a fairly well defined (albeit imperfect) client
designed and Bill of Quantities based project (with a
requirement to review and complete the designs), to a radically
different design and build type of contract with significantly
increased design coordination, liaison and detailed base design
responsibilities for the contractor (RFP 6) as well as significant
additional scope items (design of electrical, telecoms and gas
networks and tertiary roadways and infrastructure RFP 2,3,5)).

- A modified phasing of the works substantially different from
that anticipated by the Contractor...’4*
634. An NJS document entitled “Report on Al Hani Claims” covering the period until June 2009

states in part:

It must be included [sic] then that Al Hani do indeed have the
technical basis for claim for delay, and that this conclusion is well
supported by the contract documents, and also by the very issue of
signed MO 2. This conclusion was initially reported to
AECOMIHIB by NJS by way of letter dated 20" April 2009, some
17 months before approval of MO2.74>
635. Contemporary documents sent or endorsed by HIB’s representatives thus clearly accepted

Al Hani’s right to claim for additional costs.

636. The Tribunal does not accept Mr. Osbaldeston’s contention that the Tajura Contract was
not effective prior to the June 2009 Notice to Proceed, so that Al Hani acted at its peril (and

expense) prior to that date. The Tribunal finds that the interpretation of the Contract

explained in a December 2010 NJS Report to HIB correctly reflects the situation under the

Contract:

Annex |B states that “the Second Party shall be paid for the design
review within 60 days after the signing of the Contract”. It further
states that the First Party shall provide the Second Party an area of
approximately 8 hectares within 60 days after signing of the
Contract, as a job site.

This is important since it establishes that the Contract becomes
effective on signing and confirms that the obligations of both Parties
exist prior to payment of Advance Payments, Notice to Proceed, or
Hand Over of the site. It confirms the Clients desire that design
works be completed urgently and further establishes that site
establishment for construction should proceed quickly.”°
637. Claimant seeks €8,716,301 for indirect costs stemming from the delayed commencement
of the work.”” FTI’s First Report indicates that more than half of the claimed amount
reflected salaries for expatriate and local staff at the Tajura project site.““* The amounts
claimed by Al Hani evolved as documentation was refined and discussed with the NJS
accountants. (As noted supra, NJS referred Al Hani’s claims for delay to outside
accountants, who disputed significant amounts of the claims.) An NJS report sent to Al
Hani on 30 March 2010, summarized the claims for February, March and April of 2009.
The outside accountants supported approximately LYD2.60M of the LYD3.773M claimed

for this three-month period, about 69% of the total.”4°

Of Al Hani’s claim of LYD13.370 million for the period through June 2009, NJS and its
accountants ultimately accepted LYD8.631 million, °° approximately 64.6%. Applying his
own assessments of the evidence and of the elements properly he believed chargeable in
Al Hani’s daily rate, Mr. Osbaldeston assessed at the Hearing that should the Tribunal find
liability, Claimant had documented claims amounting to LYD10,873,277, approximately

69.4% of the final amount claimed.”>!

The reasons for NJS’s accountants’ reductions to the First Delay Claims, and Al Hani’s
responses, are not fully developed in the record. Mr. Osbaldeston observes that the results
of an audit by the accountants “are presented in summary format and I cannot verify what
specifically NJS accepted and/or rejected.”7? In cross-examination, Mr. Baryon,
Respondent’s primary witness on many aspects of the Tajura claim, stated that he had no
role in assessing Al Hani’s claims.”>> Mr. Turki also stated that he “was not involved in the
evaluation of the claims.””*4 A 19 August 2009 NJS letter paraphrasing the accountants’
objections suggests that claims for equipment rental were disallowed because the
accountants thought the equipment should have been purchased by Al Hani with funds
drawn from the advance payment, and not rented.”*> A more detailed December 2010 NJS
Report identifies controversies concerning expatriate remuneration and the costs of idle
equipment. As to equipment, NJS’s position appears to have been that depreciation was

not an allowable actual cost.”

As discussed supra, Mr. Déhring contended that NJS’s accountants’ review process was
overtechnical and unreasonable, for instance, by requiring original documents rather than
copies. He also describes a process of multiple meetings and discussions with the
accountants during 2010, in the course of which “we considered that we had provided more
than enough support to evidence these costs.””°” Al Hani also met with HIB on 2 December
2010, after which it again submitted “full documentation supporting our claim.””* The

Revolution then intervened.

For their part, Claimant’s quantification experts from FTI concluded that “the claim

amounts as originally presented are reasonable and do not require adjustment.””°°

Thus, contemporaneous assessments by NJS’s accountants assessments disputed by Al
Hani at the time and by Claimant in the current proceedings as well as the calculations
of Respondent’s quantification expert Mr. Osbaldeston accept from 65% to 69% of Al
Hani’s claims to be appropriate and sufficiently documented. A significant proportion of

the amount now claimed is thus not disputed.

With respect to the remaining thirty-odd percent of the claimed amount, the Tribunal finds
force in Mr. Déhring’s contention that the NJS accountants reviewed Al Hani’s claims in
an excessive and unreasonable fashion, and did not take into account explanations and
supporting documentation provided by Al Hani. In particular, the Tribunal fails to
understand why depreciation, an actual cost item recoverable in this industry, was

disallowed by NJS’ accountants.

Because of the Revolution, there was no final agreed resolution of this final disputed
portion of the Delay Claim. The Tribunal accepts that in a complex multi-part claim such
as that involved here, there may have been some computation errors, improperly included

items, and the like, such that recovery of the full amount claimed is not warranted. In these

circumstances, the Tribunal concludes that a reduction of approximately 10% of the

claimed amount is warranted.

On the basis of Article 8(1) of the Treaty, the Tribunal accordingly awards 90% of the

amount claimed for the First Delay Claim, i.e., €7.845 million.

CLAIMS 4 AND 5, PARTIV. TAJURA CONTRACT: SECOND DELAY CLAIM AND CLAIM
FoR ADDITIONAL WORK

qd) The Second Delay Claim
A, Introduction: Factual Background

As presented by FTI at the Hearing, Claimant seeks €16,220,240 for additional costs
related to delays in the Tajura project from the date of AECOM’s Notice to proceed (24
June 2009) to the scheduled date of approval of the revised preliminary design under RFP
6 (7 May 2010.)

The Notice to Proceed instructed Al Hani to proceed with a number of projects and tasks,”°!

most importantly preparation of a new preliminary design for the entire project. The current
claim involves the substantial period involved in preparing and securing approval of the
overall preliminary project design and related materials utilizing the substitute AECOM

criteria.”

As noted supra, the 22 January 2009 NJS letter called for Al Hani to revise the basic
Fegawerk design documents and to undertake much additional work. This additional work
was sketched out in February 2009, when NJS issued the “Road Map for Preparation for
Requests for Proposals and Modification Orders.” The Road Map envisioned issuance of
6 RFPS by HIB for additional work on the Tajura project. These were RFP 2 (Gas Utilities
Design), RFP 3 (Power Utilities Design), RFP 4 (Coordination and Liaison for Designs,
Utilities and Clearance), RFP 5 (Tertiary Roadway and Utilities Design) and RFP 6

70 CH-3, FTI Quantum Hearing Presentation, p. 23. Blackrock presents the claim in Libyan dinars, as
LYD29,136,872. This indicates an exchange rate of LYDI.79 €1, which appears to be broadly consistent with
exchange rates during the period.

(Design Modification to New Criteria and Phasing, including redesign of main and

secondary roads and associated utilities).

RFP 6 covered the new preliminary design for the entire project utilizing the new design
criteria.”? The Road Map anticipated that after these RFPs were approved, HIB would
issue a Modification Order to provide a contractual basis authorizing and assuring funding

for the additional work.”

The process for issuing the RFPs, for developing Al Hani’s responses, and for securing
HIB’s assessment and approval of those responses took many months, involving extensive
and sometimes vigorous exchanges between Al Hani and NJS. The core redesign work for
the entire project covered by RFP No 6 was not approved until 7 May 2010, the terminal

date for this portion of the claim.

MO 2, required to provide a contractual basis for Al Hani’s redesign of the work covered
by the original Contract under RFP No 6 and the additional work covered by RFPs 2, 3 and
5, was not initially signed until 15 December 2009. The document was then revised,
apparently at the instance of REKABA,’® and a final version was dated 30 September
2010.76

The Parties cast blame on each other for delays during the long process to secure HIB’s
approval of the revised project design and the designs for additional work under the several
RFPs. However, as finally agreed by HIB, MO 2 extended the period for contract
performance by an agreed total of 318 days, covering the period between the date of the

Notice to Proceed (24 June 2009) to the date of approval of the preliminary design under

RFP 6 (7 May 2010).767 MO 2 also increased the value of the Contract by LYD24,850,000,
reflecting all the additional work envisioned by RFPs 2, 3, 5 and 6.

The evidence, including periodic progress reports prepared by NJS, indicates that during
this multi-month process, Al Hani also carried out some construction work on roads and

other infrastructure.7°°

B. Claimant’s Position

Claimant urges that MO 2 shows HIB’s agreement that the change in design criteria, and
the process for designing and approving additional work called for by RFPs 2, 3, 5 and 6,

resulted in significant delays, as shown by the 318-day agreed extension of time.

Claimant contends that the increase in time and direct costs reflected in MO 2 did not
compensate it for €16,220,240 of additional or indirect costs stemming from the 318-day
delay. As with its First Delay Claim under this Contract, Claimant maintains that NJS
understood and accepted this. Claimant points to, inter alia, a 31 January 2010 NJS letter
stating that “[you] should rest assured that any unforeseen costs which you can reasonably
demonstrate to have resulted from directions given by NJS and AECOM, accepted by you
in good faith, will be fairly and professionally evaluated, and recommended for payment
1.7769 NJS’s 29 December 2010 Report on Al Hani’s claims is to the same effect,
concluding: “Al Hani do indeed have the technical basis for claim for delay, and this
conclusion is well supported by the contract documents, and also by the very issue of signed

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 223 of 337

Claimant denies that delays stemmed from poor design, planning or management on Al
Hani’s part. Claimant maintains that Respondent’s arguments regarding alleged
shortcomings in its performance rest on selective and misleading references to NJS
correspondence in the course of a complex iterative design process and omit Al Hani’s
responses. Claimant notes in this regard that iterative revision of designs is characteristic
of the design process.’”' Claimant adds that some of its responses were delayed because
the underlying criteria for RFPs were not fully known to Al Hani, or were otherwise due
to conditions beyond its control, including deteriorated utilities and non-performance by

other entities, such as the State-owned electricity company.

Claimant urges that Respondent’s extensive arguments concerning disagreements and
shifting positions regarding design of the storm water system are misleading and incorrect,
but are in any event irrelevant to the present claim. Claimant reviews the history of this
matter in considerable detail, noting that, while Mr. Baryon was opposed to seepage ponds,
they were provided for in the Tajura Contract, NJS and HIB approved the concept in June
2009,’ and that NJS then approved designs for seepage reservoirs in October 2010, but
the next month instructed Al Hani to cease work on the current design’”> because of an

abrupt change in design philosophy by HIB.

Claimant denies that MO 2 established the total compensation due for the period and barred
the present claims. Claimant points in this regard to extensive correspondence and
interchanges with NJS and HIB following MO 2 as showing that both Parties did not regard
these claims as having been waived. Rather, Mr. Déhring insists, MO 2 confirmed that
“t]he prices offered do not include any provision to direct and indirect delay costs which

are dealt with separately.”74

Claimant maintains that its claims were extensively and properly documented, and that the

accountants acting for NJS acted unreasonably in assessing Al Hani’s claims.’

C. Respondent’s Position

Respondent’s Counter-Memorial contends, emphasizing the testimony of Mr. Baryon, that
“[i]n reality, it was Al-Hani’s shoddy design work that was the primary cause of the delayed
commencement. Al Hani was consistently late in submitting designs and its designs were

of exceedingly poor quality.”7”°

Respondent highlights Mr. Baryon’s criticisms of Al Hani’s approach to the design of the
storm water drainage system, providing for the use of seepage ponds, which Mr. Baryon
judged to be incorrect in the circumstances.’’”? Respondent also emphasizes perceived
shortcomings in “fast-track” work on certain priority road projects.’”® While
acknowledging that “‘it is true that the removal of certain obstacles was not proceeding as
expected,” Respondent contends that “there was still work that could have been done.”””°
Respondent further maintains that Al Hani utilized its campsite, tools and personnel on

other projects, in violation of the Contract.7°°

Respondent emphasizes that, in its view, Al Hani’s claims were wholly unwarranted or
inadequately documented. Respondent urges in this regard that Al Hani’s claims were

78! recalling the arguments and

examined by NJS “and found to be woefully insufficient,
evidence with respect to the alleged deficiencies of Al Hani’s claims during the First Delay

Period.”** The Counter-Memorial notes in particular NJS’s accountants’ objections to Al

Hani’s treatment of the costs of rented equipment, which the NJS accountants suggested

should have been purchased with funds from the advance payment. 7*>

Respondent’s quantification expert Mr. Osbaldeston of Blackrock was of similar mind,
contending in his reports that Al Hani had not “properly made out its claim with

calculations, records and other details to demonstrate its losses.”78+

Respondent adds that Al Hani’s requests for clarifications and for approval of MO 2 did
not justify delays on Al Hani’s part. Respondent argues in this regard that “verbal and
written direction” to proceed with additional work were sufficient, and Al Hani’s insistence
on a modification order to provide a contractual basis for its work reflected “excuses” and

attempts “to shift the blame for its delays to HIB, NJS and AECOM.”78>

Respondent also contends that “a major cause” of delays in the design process was the

location of Strabag International’s engineering team in Germany.7°°

A further argument raised by Mr. Osbaldeston concerns the possible waiver by Al Hani of
the Second Delay Claim pursuant to the 30 September 2010 Addendum to the Contract,’°”
a document captioned in the Claimant’s exhibits as “Variation Order No. 2 to the Tajura
Contract.” Article (2) of this document states that “[t]he prices of this annex are fixed and
include all expenses, costs, obligations, taxes and fees of any kind, incurred by the Second

Party for implementing the scope of works of this annex according to the attached BoQ.”

Mr. Osbaldeston observed in his First Report that “according to [the] contract addendum
of 30 September 2010, it appears to me that Al Hani may have compromised all of its
claims in relation to the design issues.””** FTI responded in its Second Report, pointing
out that an antecedent document, Modification No. ee includes a note stating “The prices
offered do not include any provision to direct and indirect delay costs which are dealt with
separately.””°° Mr. Osbaldeston acknowledged this in his Second Report but indicated that
the document dated 30 September 20107! does not contain this language. He observes that
“I do not know why this is, but the Variation Order would normally be the document that

confirms the modification of the Contract and not MO 2 which I understand precedes it.”7°

As to the December 2010 NJS report stating that Al Hani had a “technical basis” for its
claims, Respondent urges, again citing Mr. Baryon, that the document was prepared by a
person “who had a reputation of being overly lax with Al Hani,” and that it in any event
pointed to significant shortcomings in the preparation and documentation of Al Hani’s

claims.’

Notwithstanding Respondent’s objections to this claim, the Counter-Memorial concludes

that:

Despite the “appalling” nature of Al-Hani’s claims, HIB was
prepared to compensate Al-Hani for costs associated with delays.
However, characteristically Al-Hani has refused to send
documentation. HIB remains waiting to this day for Al-Hani to
provide an accounting of its delay costs that meets the basic
minimum standards of accounting. ’**

Respondent’s Rejoinder takes a less forthcoming view: Claimant’s Delay Claims “have

still not been substantiated nor did HIB agree to compensate Al-Hani for this extension.””°°

D. The Tribunal’s Analysis and Decision

As explained infra, the Tribunal finds that the evidence, including extensive contemporary
documentation, establishes that Al Hani was entitled to some recovery for its delay and
indirect costs during the Second Delay Period. However, the record regarding the amount
of compensation due is less clearly developed than with respect to Claimant’s First Delay

Claim under the Tajura Contract.

Were the Claims Compromised? The Tribunal first considers Mr. Osbaldeston’s suggestion
that by reason of the 30 September 2010 Addendum to the Contract, Al Hani

“compromised all of its claims in relation to the design issues.”7°°

MO 2, signed by Al Hani in September 2010 and by NJS in December 2009, is at variance
with this claim.””’ The additional design work instructed after abandonment of the
Fegawerk design was priced in MO 2. However, as pointed out by FTI, the document
excludes the direct and indirect delay costs incurred during the 31 8-day period of delay. It
includes a note clearly stating “[t]he prices offered do not include any provision to direct

and indirect delay costs which are dealt with separately.”7"

In contemporary correspondence, Al Hani made clear its intention to seek compensation

for these additional costs. Al Hani’s 27 January 2010 letter to NJS states:

At this stage we would like to clearly point out again that the
Amount of 24,850,000.000 LYD for this MO represents the amount
for the re-design only. No allowance has been made for
consequential direct and indirect cost related to the MO and to the
contract, due to the extended contract period of 318 days.

This has been made clear by the “Note: The prices offered do not

include any provision to direct and indirect delay costs which are

dealt with separately”, as mentioned in the MO. 7°
NJS promptly replied on 31 January 2010, affirming that any request for payment of
additional costs “will be evaluated by NJS fairly and professionally in accordance with the

contract and an appropriate recommendation made to AECOM/HIB.”*

On 28 June 2010, Al Hani submitted its claim for additional costs and expenses during the
Second Delay Period.*®' The Parties remained in discussion of these claims and their
supporting documentation throughout the remainder of their relationship. HIB declined to
pay the claims, apparently because of disagreements regarding the adequacy of the
supporting documentation, reflecting objections by the accountants retained by NJS that

Claimant views as excessive and unreasonable.*

Al Hani’s claims thus remained under discussion with HIB, including at a 2 December
2010 meeting, several months after signature of Variation Order No. 2. A report by NJS on
Al Hani’s claims dated 29 December 2010 concluded that “Al Hani do indeed have the
technical basis for claim for delay, and that this conclusion is well supported by the contract
documents, and also by the very issue of signed MO2.”*°? Concerning abandonment of the
Fegawerk design, the NJS Report observes that “Technically the Contractor was quite
contractually correct, and within his rights, to ignore anything other than written

instructions from HIB until late November. Even after issue of the Letters of Authority, the

powers given to AECOM and NJS by these letters of authority were so limited as to be of

little value in resolving a major contractual conflict.”°°*

On 19 January 2011 at HIB’s request, and virtually as the Revolution began Al Hani
provided updated calculations of its additional costs until that date.*°> Al Hani’s claims for

delay and indirect expenses were never paid.

The Parties’ contemporary conduct thus shows that Al Hani continued to assert its claims
for delay and additional costs throughout 2010 and into 2011, that NJS affirmed the
contractual basis for those claims, and that HIB continued to consider them. Thus, the
contracting parties at the time did not understand Al Hani’s Delay Claims to have been

waived.

Respondent’s Counter-Memorial confirms that this was precisely the procedure the parties

envisioned:

While Variation Order No. 2 extended the contract period by 318
days and increased the contract value to reflect additional design and
construction work, the parties agreed to a separate process to
compensate Al-Hani for any costs associated with the delayed
commencement. Al-Hani was required to submit its Delay Claims
to NJS for evaluation.8°°
The Tribunal accordingly concludes that present claim was not waived by operation of the

30 September 2010 Addendum to the Contract.

Was Al Hani’s Work Defective? The Tribunal next considers Respondent’s contention that
the design and construction work performed during the Second Delay Period was of poor
quality. Respondent’s contention in this regard is heavily reliant on Mr. Baryon’s evidence,
particularly his strongly expressed views regarding allegedly incorrect choices by Al Hani

in designing the storm water drainage system.

The Tribunal notes that Mr. Baryon was hired by NJS as a field inspector engineer in July
2009, after significant events now at issue occurred;*°7 he confirmed at the Hearing that
his evidence regarding those matters does not reflect personal knowledge but instead what
he was told by colleagues.*°* He confirmed on cross-examination that he was one of thirty
engineers employed by NJS,*? most of whom worked on roads, drainage water and
drinking water, and that he “was specialized in roads and water, sewer, rainwater, and
drinking water.”*!'° Thus, his expertise and personal knowledge did not extend to some of

the design and contracting issues on which he offered opinions.

Respondent criticizes Al Hani’s “refusal to assess and modify the Fegawerk designs as
required,”*'' alleging that Al Hani failed to correct significant design defects as required

by the Tajura Contract, including “significant problems with the water system, sewage

812

system, storm water system” and other elements."’~ Respondent and Mr. Baryon further

allege “poor management and design coordination” and “consistently late and of low

quality work” by Al Hani.*"3

Claimant’s witness Mr. Déhring, Al Hani’s project manager, vigorously disputes these
contentions, *'* urging that Respondent’s use of contracting correspondence is selective and

misleading, citing examples supporting this view.*'>

The Tribunal notes that these criticisms also seem at variance with the generally more
positive assessments given in NJS’s Monthly Reports on the project and in correspondence

and reports,*!®

including by NJS’s senior person on the project, Mr. Sterry. Mr. Baryon
criticized Mr. Sterry as unduly permissive and favorable to Al Hani.*'7 However, Mr.
Sterry, and not Mr. Baryon, was NJS’s senior representative, responsible for overseeing
and assessing Al Hani’s work at Tajura. Mr. Dohring, Mr. Sterry’s counterpart on the
project, found Mr. Baryon’s “suggestion that Mr. Sterry’s views were not representative of
NJS [to be] misplaced.”*'* In cross-examination, Mr. Déhring described Mr. Sterry as

“very hard-pushing against-towards us to start and to execute the Project.”*!9

Mr. Baryon’s evidence reflected strong personal views regarding a protracted design
debate among various interested parties regarding management of storm water run-off.
While the Tajura Contract provided for seepage ponds, Mr. Baryon viewed this an
unsuitable approach. However, the evidence shows that Al Hani was given evolving
instructions by its employer in this regard. The 22 January 2009 letter instructed Al Hani
to design an alternative detention basin solution with overflow to the sea. Some questioned
this revised approach, and an option “without overflow to the sea” was then adopted.*?° To
cut a long story short, the debate over the best method to deal with storm water and
associated soil tests continued for many months.*?! NJS eventually approved the designs
for two seepage ponds, but on 27 September 2010 noted public concern over the use of
such ponds. Then, on 10 November 2010, NJS instructed Al Hani to cease all work on the

currently approved design philosophy until a new concept had been approved.* Mr.

Baryon indicated on cross-examination that the decision to abandon seepage ponds was

made by HIB,*?? which had originally called for them in the Contract.

688. Claimant views this sequence of evolving design choices and evolving directions to Al
Hani as “symptomatic of the approach that the HIB took to the management of the Tajura

Contract.”*™ The Tribunal finds force in this contention.

689. Responsibility for Delays. The Tribunal is also not persuaded by Respondent’s contention
that Claimant was largely responsible for delays during this period. An undated Time
Impact Analysis prepared by NJS paints a substantially different picture.*?> This Analysis
reviews the delays from February 2009 to May 2010, attributing them to the large volume

of additional work and design revisions introduced by HIB. NJS notes in this regard:

- the introduction of base designs of electrical, telecoms and gas distribution systems,

which were not part of the originally agreed scope of work;

- the introduction of design of tertiary roads and infrastructure not previously included

in the project scope;

- the abandonment of Fegawerk’s design and the introduction of a radically different
design and build type of contract with significantly increased design coordination,

liaison and detail-based design responsibility for the contractor;

- significant additional scope items connected to the inclusion of electrical, telecoms and

gas distribution systems; and

- a modified phasing of the works substantially different from those originally
anticipated based on Fegawerk design, especially for the purpose to bring benefit to the
largest number of people in the shortest possible time starting with the most highly

urbanized areas.

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 233 of 337

690. The NJS analysis accordingly concluded that

[t]he nature of the changes and increased responsibilities
incorporated in MO 2 are such that in effect the Contractor has found
himself under virtual suspension of work since 22"! January 2009
until such time as the issue ofa letter by HIB dated 315‘ January 2010
confirming acceptance of the offer and scope of works for MO2.°?6

691. Given the scope of the changes to Al Hani’s work under the Tajura Contract, Mr. Baryon
acknowledged in cross-examination that the 318-day extension of time for performance

authorized by MO 2 was “reasonable”:

A. So, when we talk about 318 days, that was not a period of
time that was required just to finish this new design but also
to finish the design work on other parts of the project.

So, it is true that we agreed that 318 days was reasonable,
but it was reasonable to conduct all this required design
work, and it was not specific or restricted to RFP 6.87

692. The evidence also shows that the construction work Al Hani was able to carry out during
this period encountered obstacles for which Al Hani was not responsible, notably failure
to identify or clear utilities and other obstacles standing in the way of design and
construction work. NJS’s First Consolidated Monthly Report for August 2008 March

2009 thus observes “Responsibility for Utilities clearance rests with HIB and not contractor

and is delaying construction.”***

693. | NJS Report No. 7 at the end of August 2010 is similar:

The main factors that have affected construction progress have been
delays caused by third party utilities. Works on TF 66 has been
suspended until GECOL confirm their requirements regarding the
existing underground cable which is in the proposed sewer
alignment. GECOL substations and OH cables still require
relocating along TC 22. This is causing partial obstructions along
the new road alignment...°?°

694. A third NJS document describes another difficulty:

To meet the Contractor’s schedule, approximately 1.2 km of road
needs to be cleared and handed over each week. Thus since the
signing of the Contract some 3 years ago, approximately 150 km
should have been cleared and handed over to date, whereas in fact
only 13 km have been handed over to date, with many of these roads,
even now, not completely free of obstructions.*??

695. | NJS concluded in a December 2010 Report that “[hJand over of sites remains on the single
most critical issues affecting the current program of the project and undermining the

Client’s [i.e., HIB’s] position under the Contract.”83!

696. The Tribunal also finds unpersuasive Respondent’s contention that Al Hani’s calls for clear
authorization from HIB to deviate from the initial Contract, and in particular for completion
of MO 2 to sanction payment for additional work, caused unnecessary delay. The evidence
shows that Al Hani’s caution in this regard was reasonable. NJS itself acknowledged the
limited scope of its authority to direct deviations from the Contract in the December 2010
Report to HIB, noting “the very limited powers given to NJS through the Letter of
Authority, which restricts the authority of NJS to some extent, and therefore requires HIB

confirmation of significant instructions.”** NJS accordingly concluded:

Technically, the Contractor was quite contractually correct, and
within his rights, to ignore anything other than written instructions
from HIB until late November [2008]. Even after the issue of the
Letters of Authority, the powers given to AECOM and NJS by these
Letters of Authority were so limited as to be of little value in
resolving a major contractual conflict.*?

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 235 of 337

Respondent’s position regarding other claims in this case also indicates that Al Hani’s
caution was warranted. For example, as discussed infra, Respondent’s defense to the claim
for emergency repairs to the 11" of June Road contends, inter alia, that payment could not

be made because there was no modification order authorizing it.

The Tribunal, accordingly, does not accept the contention that Al Hani was itself a major
cause of the delays encountered. The Tribunal instead concludes that the evidence shows
that actions (and inaction) by HIB and its representatives led to significant delays and

inefficiencies that caused significant additional expense to Al Hani.

However, the evidence also shows that Al Hani was able to carry on a good deal of work
on roads and other construction during this period. Mr. Dohring thus observed that by

February 2011, Al Hani had

undertaken significant work in preparing the sites, obtaining

material and equipment, mobilizing personnel, and obtaining

approval for the designs. By that time we were also working on the

roads on the sites that had been made available to us, had started

building the pumping stations, digging trenches for the pipelines, we

had built the pre-cast yard, and were constructing seepage ponds as

well as other works — we were accordingly fully engaged in

construction activities. **
During this period, Al Hani submitted Payment Certificate Nos. 3, 4, and 5 as well as four
bitumen certificates, for a total of LYD9,802,008 and €8,185,038, plus LYD1,004,316 for
unpaid bitumen certificates.**> Al Hani’s claims for these unpaid certificates are addressed
in connection with Claimant’s separate claims for unpaid payment certificates, supra and

will not be addressed here.

The difficulty facing the Tribunal, then, is how to assess the amount of additional costs Al
Hani incurred due to delays caused by the revised and expanded design process, while
during the same period it was able to utilize its personnel and equipment to carry out some

work for which it seeks payment through its payment certificate claims.

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 236 of 337

The evidence for this period is less clearly developed than that for the First Delay Claim
Period. Al Hani’s First Delay Claim was scrutinized, albeit unfairly in Al Hani’s view, by
NJS’s accountants who approved substantial amounts. The Tribunal has not been referred
to any corresponding evidence of NJS’s assessment of the claims here which might provide
a reference point. Accordingly, the Tribunal must look to the evidence provided by the

Parties’ experts from Blackrock and FTI.

The experts advance different analyses and conclusions. FTI’s evidence emphasizes the
chronology of events leading to the 318-day time extension agreed by HIB.**° FTI judges
this extension to be fully warranted, arguing that it indeed “understates the true delay
experienced by Al Hani up to the point that all work stopped in February 2011.7837 FTI
made its own calculation of an appropriate daily rate during the period, which it assessed
to be LYD82,375 per day.*°8 Multiplying this by the 318 days of the agreed extension gives
approximately LYD26.195 million (approximately €14.63 million at the exchange rate that
FTI apparently used). FTI concludes that the similarity of their estimate with the amounts
originally claimed shows that the claim is “reasonable and dofes] not require

adjustment.”*9

Blackrock’s First Report does not assist the Tribunal, as it concludes that Al Hani is not
entitled to any compensation for delay during either the First or Second Delay Claim
Period.*#* Mr. Osbaldeston’s Second Report affirms this conclusion, continuing to value
the Second Delay Claim at “nil”.84! However, should the Tribunal award indirect costs for
this period, Mr. Osbaldeston’s Second Report calculates a “provisional” daily rate of

between LYD39,694 and LYD47,731 for the Second Delay Period.*4? Multiplied by 318

days, these rates point to additional costs ranging from approximately LYD12.62 million

to LYD15.18 million (roughly €7.05 million to €8.48 million).

In his presentation at the Hearing, Mr. Osbaldeston presented a “figures-as-figures”
assessment of the value of the claim as LYD15,063,977,°> very close to the figure arrived
at above using the higher of his two daily rates. In its corresponding Hearing presentation,
FTI assessed this amount to equal €8,385,984, slightly more than half of Claimant’s claim
of €16,220,240.844

The evidence and arguments do not allow a precise assessment of the almost €8 million
difference between the experts’ respective assessments. Unlike the First Delay Claim
Period, the claims here were not scrutinized by NJS’s accountants, a process that although
disputed offered a reference point for the Tribunal’s assessment. The evidence shows that
the Second Delay Period was not wholly lost for Al Hani, which was able to utilize its
personnel and equipment to perform some substantial design and construction work for
which it could and did submit Payment Certificates. In the circumstances, and in the
exercise of its discretion in a situation involving less than perfect evidence, the Tribunal
determines to award the amount put forward by Mr. Osbaldeston at the Hearing
(approximately €8,386,000), plus half of the difference between his estimate and the

amount claimed, an additional amount equal to €3,917,000.

Pursuant to Article 8(1) of the Treaty, the Tribunal accordingly awards €12,303,000 for

Claimant’s period covering the Second Delay Period Claim.

(2) Claims for Additional Work
A. The 11" of June Road

As set out in FTI’s Hearing presentation, Claimant seeks €2,716,395 for uncompensated
emergency repair work it carried out on the 11" of June Road in late October and early
November 2010.**5 Although the amount involved in this claim is less than that involved

in many other claims, both Parties devoted substantial effort and attention to it.

It is undisputed that in early October 2010, HIB requested Al Hani to carry out emergency
repairs to the road leading to Tripoli’s International Airport in preparation for an A frican-
European summit the next month.**° It also is undisputed that Al Hani diverted resources
from the TIAR road project, rapidly completed the required emergency repairs, and that Al
Hani was not paid for the work.*47 The road to the airport was reopened on 7 November

2010, in time for the summit.®48

The Parties dispute whether Al Hani is entitled to an agreed price of LYD4,879,536.947,
or should be paid some lesser amount. Respondent contends that Al Hani did not properly
perform the work, so its compensation should be reduced. Further, although the 11" of
June Road was not in the Tajura area, emergency repairs were linked to the Tajura Contract
for Respondent’s administrative purposes. Respondent contends that payment was properly
refused because Al Hani did not submit a proposed Modification Order to the Tajura
Contract for HIB’s review and approval under the Tajura Contract’s Modification Order

process.

B. Claimant’s Position

Claimant contends Al Hani and HIB agreed, in particular at a meeting on 20 October 2010,
that Al Hani would perform the emergency repair work for a fixed total cost of
LYD4,879,536.947.549 Claimant cites in this regard the signed and sealed minutes of that
meeting, minutes that were signed by Respondent’s witness who testified at the Hearing,
Mr. Turki. These confirm LYD4,879,536.947 as the cost of the work, and state that “the
full value of the work will be billed to HIB” and that “HIB agrees to pay, the invoice for

the work on or before December 15, 2010.”°*°

Claimant maintains that the emergency repairs were accomplished in the manner, and in
the limited time, required by HIB; that it submitted a payment certificate on 27 November
2010;*! and that it is entitled to payment of the full agreed price. It further contends that
the modalities for arranging payment are a matter for HIB to resolve, and that payment

cannot properly be denied because of HIB’s internal administrative requirements.

With respect to HIB’s claim to reduce the amount due by approximately LYD1 million on
account of various specified and unspecified shortcomings, Claimant contends, inter alia,
that the supposed shortcomings were never notified to it during performance. Claimant
submits that the reductions instead reflect an intervention by REKABA, which criticized
Al Hani’s work in a letter to HIB that also castigated HIB for entering into the repair
arrangement without a formal contract, said to be contrary to applicable legislation.**? At

the Hearing, Mr. Turki testified that he had never seen REKABA’s letter.855

With respect to Respondent’s several grounds for reducing the amount to be paid, and for

then denying payment, Claimant contends, inter alia, that:

actually performed; and that Al Hani failed to take the steps required to obtain paymen:

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 240 of 337

Road signage was properly placed, citing measurement sheets approved by the
supervising engineer,*™* and pointing out that neither the project engineer nor HIB’s
on-scene representative is recalled to have voiced complaints about this issue while

work was underway;

A reduction due to the failure to lay two courses of asphalt is improper, noting that the
agreed minutes provided that Al Hani would only lay a “[rJegulating course where

7855

neede given the limited time to carry out the emergency repairs;

The claim that Al Hani failed to smooth around manhole covers is unsupported, and

that Al Hani was not instructed to carry out this work;856

There is no basis for an arbitrary reduction of 30% based on unexplained

9857

“comments, apparently on account of REKABA’s criticisms;*** and

Notwithstanding Respondent’s contrary claim, Al Hani did submit requested
documents, but in any case, HIB cannot invoke its internal administrative processes as

a reason for non-payment.**?

C. Respondent’s Position

In his Witness Statements and at the Hearing, Mr. Turki explained the reduction on
multiple grounds, contending, inter alia, that performance was defective; the emergency

repair contract was not for a lump sum, but was based on a BOQ, with payment for works

1,860

At the Hearing, Mr. Turki went further, testifying that there was no contract, only a

modification of the Tajura Contract.**!

Respondent first contends that the amount due to Al Hani should be reduced due to the

“shoddy and incomplete nature of Al-Hani’s work.”°™

It contends, inter alia, that Al Hani
failed to (1) provide all of the required road signage, (2) properly lay the asphalt, in that it
laid a single course of asphalt rather than laying separate wearing and regulating courses,
and (3) failed to request a Modification Order to the Tajura Contract in accordance with
the modification mechanism under that contract. At the Hearing, Mr. Turki stated that it
was the contractor’s responsibility to know that such an order was required,*® and Al Hani
was not paid because they did not follow the provisions of the Tajura Contract dealing with

modification orders.

Mr. Turki values the works performed at LYD3,878,594.94,° approximately LYDI
million less than the amount claimed. In his Second Quantum Report, Respondent’s
valuation expert Mr. Osbaldeston assesses the amount due to Al Hani for the repair work

to be LYD3,379,604, LYD500,000 less than the amount indicated by Mr. Turki.8°°

D. The Tribunal’s Analysis and Decision

The Tribunal understands the evidence to show that Al Hani performed the emergency

repairs on the 11"

of June Road in the expedited manner requested by HIB and in
accordance with the terms of the Minutes of the 20 October 2010 meeting. Respondent’s
present complaints regarding the quality of those repairs were not expressed by HIB’s
representatives at the time, and are often countered by measurement sheets signed by HIB’s
on-scene representative. Respondent has not provided a convincing explanation for the
substantial deductions from the agreed price reflected in the October Minutes that appear

to have been prompted by REKABA’s intervention.

Further, the Tribunal does not accept the contention that Al Hani could not be paid because
it did not secure a Modification Order to the Tajura Contract. The agreed Minutes of the
20 October 2010 meeting, at which Al Hani agreed to perform the emergency work and
which were signed by Mr. Turki, state the agreed price, that Al Hani was to submit its
invoice, and that it would then be promptly paid.*°” Respondent has not shown why its own
internal administrative and budgeting processes which Al Hani in any event sought to
satisfy justify payment of less than the full agreed amount. The Tribunal is not persuaded
that it was incumbent upon Al Hani to know that payment provisions reflected in the 20
October Minutes were of no consequence and that payment would require a Modification

Order to the Tajura Contract.

Pursuant to Article 8(1) of the Treaty, the Tribunal accordingly awards €2,716,395 for the
uncompensated emergency repair work Al Hani performed on the 11" of June Road in the

autumn of 2010.

(3) Claim for Additional Work under RFP 4

RFP 4, which Mr. Dohring described as “particularly important,”*** involved identification

and removal of existing utilities, work that was required in order for new construction work
to proceed. The work covered by RFP 4 may not have been incorporated into a
Modification Order prior to the Revolution, although the evidence is inconsistent regarding
this.*? Nevertheless, it is undisputed that Claimant carried out work within the scope of

RFP 4 for which it was not paid.

867 C-124, Minutes of 20 October 2010 Meeting.

868 Dohring WS 984.

89 There is conflicting evidence whether RFP 4 was incorporated into a Modification Order. Mr. Baryon stated in his
first Witness Statement that it was not. However, an NJS Report disclosed by Respondent after the hearing pursuant
to the Tribunal’s request states that Modification Order No. 3 — which would have included the work covered by RFP
4 — was approved by the HIB in December 2010. Cl. PHB 4196.

Pursuant to Article 8(1) of the Treaty, Claimant seeks €2,664,276 for this work, which
included work to identify water supply, sewerage, and storm water networks.°” Mr.
Dohring states that this work included both above-ground surveys, and also below-ground
work that required sending “investigating teams down the sewers to identify the location

of utilities ... this was a huge exercise.”*7!

Claimant alleges that Al Hani performed this work, which was recorded on a Day Works

basis, on a good faith basis and expecting to be paid.*”

According to Mr. Dohring, Al Hani
acted proactively in good faith with the expectation that it would be paid, notwithstanding
that the HIB had not yet issued a Modification Order.*”> Claimant refers in this connection
to a 13 December 2010 letter from NJS stating that “it is our intent to convert all works
currently being executed on a Day Works basis to BOQ items once MO3 (RFP4) has been

approved.”*74

On the basis of their review of Al Hani’s field measurement sheets and other materials
supporting this claim, FTI concludes that Al Hani is entitled to LYD4,937,222, which they
equated to €2,748,508.°% At the Hearing, the FTI experts reduced the claim by
approximately €84,000 to €2,664,276.°”

B. Respondent’s Position

Respondent contends that payment was not made because of differences regarding the rates

to be applied to the work. According to Respondent’s Counter-Memorial:

With regard to RFP 4, the parties could not agree on the terms of
payment. NJS and HIB insisted that the contract rates be used.
However, as FTI notes, the contract rates were only used by Al-Hani
“in some instances.” The parties were to resolve their differences
regarding payment terms in a new variation order, and HIB
requested that Al-Hani submit such a variation order. However, Al-
Hani never did so.°””
At the Hearing, Respondent’s quantification expert Mr. Osbaldeston assessed the value of

the work performed at LYD4,634,606,°* equal to €2,580,044.°

C. The Tribunal’s Analysis and Decision

The Parties do not appear to dispute, and the Tribunal accepts, that Al Hani performed a
significant amount of work related to RFP 4 for which it was not paid. As finally presented
at the Hearing, the Parties’ experts’ assessments of the value of this work do not differ

greatly; the difference between them is €84,232, approximately 3% of the total claimed.

The evidence for both this claim and the following one is less complete than for some other
claims. Claimant states in this regard that in both cases, the value of the claim was

“estimated on the basis of available documents.”8*°

Given the nature of the evidence and lacking a clear explanation of the reason for the
difference between the FTI and Blackrock assessments of the value of the work performed,

the Tribunal awards the lower of the two, €2,580,044, pursuant to Article 8(1) of the Treaty.

(4) Claim for Additional Work under RFP 8
A, Claimant’s Position

Claimant also seeks €961,160**! for construction work on a large box storm water culvert
and two other smaller construction tasks falling within the scope of RFP 8, which also

seems not to have been included in a Modification Order.**

As with the work related to RFP 4, Claimant contends that it performed this work in good
faith and in expectation that it would be paid, and that it submitted appropriate
documentation of this work. The record includes photographs of the large storm water

culvert.

B. Respondent’s Position

Respondent contends that the Modification Order required in order for Al Hani to be paid
was never signed “due to a breakdown in the negotiations regarding the payment method
to be made for the work, and due to Al-Hani’s failure to submit the variation order for
review as requested.”**? However, “HIB was still prepared to pay Al-Hani for the work

that it had adequately performed and for which it could provide documentation.”***

Respondent’s quantification expert Mr. Osbaldeston assesses the claim at LYD831,787
(approximately €463,000) stating that “[w]hilst I accept that some reinforced concrete

work was done based solely on the photographs provided I cannot value it accurately.”**>

C. The Tribunal’s Analysis and Decision

Here again, it is undisputed that Al Hani performed substantial work in the reasonable
expectation that it would be paid, but was not paid. The difficulty goes to assessing the
value of the work that was done. Mr. Osbaldeston of Blackrock estimates the value of the
work to be roughly half of FTI’s estimate. Given the circumstances, and the absence of

clear evidence to sustain a higher value, the Tribunal adopts Mr. Osbaldeston’s estimate.

Pursuant to Article 8(1) of the Treaty, the Tribunal awards €463,000 for Al Hani’s

uncompensated work covered by RFP 8.

CLAIMS 4 AND 5, PART V. RETENTION AMOUNTS
(1) Retention Amounts

All of Al Hani’s contracts with Libyan public entities authorized the employer to retain 5%
of the amounts claimed on payment certificates as an incentive to assure satisfactory
completion of the works. For example, under Article 10(e) of the General Conditions of

the Benghazi Contract,

[t]he first party shall keep 5% of each monthly payments [sic] for
the guarantee of the good performance of the works. They shall be
paid after the provisional acceptance of the works in accordance
with the provisions of article (54) of the Contract.**

Like Al Hani’s other contracts, Article 54 of the Benghazi Contract then sets out a detailed

procedure for inspection and provisional acceptance of the works following completion. It

provides, inter alia, that

[t]he final payment and the release of the final guarantee shall not
be made before the execution [of the agreed procedure for inspection
and acceptance] otherwise the first party shall execute t{h]Jem on the
expenses and responsibility of the second party.*#”

Each payment certificate issued by Al Hani recorded the amount
retained by the Authorities by way of performance guarantee, but
which the Authorities failed to release to Al Hani despite the fact
that they took possession of the corresponding sections of the
roads. *#8

According to Claimant’s witness Mr. Knaack:

On the Benghazi, Misurata and TIAR contracts, we had completed

significant sections of the roads which were being used by traffic

and we considered that we were entitled to the release of retention

sums for these sections, but the clients never did so.°8°
At the Hearing, Claimant’s quantification experts from FTI computed the total of the
improperly retained retentions to be €7,924,256.° The corresponding calculation by
Respondent’s witness and its experts from Blackrock offered two figures: one indicated by
Respondent’s witness Mr. Al Kelani of €7,917,828 and a second calculated by Mr.

Osbaldeston of €7,872,602.°"! All three of these calculations point to similar amounts.

As discussed below, Respondent denies Al Hani’s right to recover any of the retentions.
For all of the contracts, Respondent maintains that the contractual requirements for final
acceptance and release of the retentions were not met, so that it need not release the retained

amounts.

The facts relating to the contracts differ, so they must be considered individually. In its
assessments, the Tribunal is mindful that the contractual acceptance process was not
necessarily conducive to prompt acceptance and release of retentions. Indeed, the road
contracts can be seen as giving the employer incentives not to rush to accept completed
work. Prior to acceptance, even if a road had been in service for several years, the

contractor remained fully responsible for maintaining it, removing sand, and, in

Respondent’s view, for repairing any damage from road accidents or unexpectedly heavy

vehicle loadings after the road was put in service.

This view of the contractor’s continuing responsibilities was confirmed by Respondent’s

witness Mr. El-Abesh at the Hearing:

Q. Is it correct that the Employer considered any damage to the
road had to be repaired by the Contractor, no matter how that
was caused?

A. This is the nature of the Contract. The Contract stipulates
that the Project or the road is under the responsibility of the
other party until it is delivered, taken possession of, and the
company knows now, that because they have looked at the
model Contract used-or-used for other parts of this road
before it signed the Contract.

Q. But once the road is being taken back by the Employer and
put to traffic, then it isn’t in the possession of the Contractor,
is it?

A. Contractually speaking, that is not correct. 8%

Claimant’s supervisor of the Benghazi project, Mr. de Maria, characterized the matter this
way: “[i]t was ... not in the RBA’s interests to issue a provisional acceptance certificate for
completed sections of the road, and in fact, in Libya, the RBA delayed provisional

acceptance.”8%

A, The Benghazi Contract

In their First Report, Claimant’s quantification experts from FTI stated the total retention
amount for the Benghazi Contract, the most advanced of the several contracts, to be

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 249 of 337

The evidence shows that sections of road covered by the Contract began to be placed in
service in 2007 and much more of the road was placed in service by October 2009.** At
the Hearing, Mr. El-Abesh confirmed that at the time of the Revolution, the Benghazi

project was completed, except for RBA’s acceptance of the road:

Q. ... [B]y the time the Revolution happened, this Project was
complete, wasn’t it?

A. The Benghazi Project, you mean?

Q. Yes.

A. Yes, yes. It was the only thing that was not completed was
the delivery andtaken the Owner had not taken possession
of the road.*%°

Mr. de Maria’s Witness Statement described a recurring sequence of attempts, beginning
in 2008, to gain provisional acceptance as the length of completed road increased. RBA in
each instance identified what it deemed to be shortcomings in Al Hani’s work, as well as

damage to the road after it was put into service, all requiring additional work by Al Hani.*°”

In Respondent’s view, these further requirements for contractual acceptance were never
satisfied. Hence, “RBA insists on the fact that Strabag International continues to bear
responsibility until the Benghazi project is handed over to RBA,”*%* albeit twelve years

after long sections of the refurbished road entered into service.

In his First Witness Statement, Mr. El-Abesh, described Al Hani’s initial effort to secure
acceptance in October 2009. At that time RBA requested “the removal and replacement of
certain damaged sections of the road, the restoration of damaged shoulders, the removal of

sand from shoulder edges and the reposition of certain road signs.”*°? Mr. de Maria insisted

that this work was done, but Mr. El-Abesh insisted that it was not, and described additional
inspections and meetings in 2010 when Al Hani’s work was again found inadequate for
provisional acceptance.*” The RBA this time called for Al Hani to “prepare a proposal for
the treatment of waves” on the road surface, repairing guard rails, removing sand from
shoulders, and providing the asphalt mixtures that had been used.°°! This process continued
through the years; a 2011 attempt was frustrated by the Revolution, and another RBA

committee identified additional required changes in 2012.9

750. Among the requirements identified in 2012 was for lab tests to be done on samples taken
from multiple locations on the road. In his First Witness Statement, Mr. El-Abesh insisted

3 so that RBA did not receive the results, and that “the

that they were not paid for,”
provisional acceptance process remains incomplete and we have not been able to release
the retention money.”*™ In his testimony at the Hearing, Mr. El-Abesh told the Tribunal
“there was a modest amount of money that wasn’t paid, which is the fees for the testing
done by the laboratory. The company did not pay for the tests, and that is why we have
never received the results of these tests undertaken.”° In response to the Tribunal’s
question referring Mr. El-Abesh to a check by which Claimant said it had paid for the tests,
Mr. El-Abesh expanded upon his written statement, speculating, without reference to any

evidence, that either the check was not deposited or the samples failed the tests.°°°

751. In his Second Witness Statement, Mr. Napowanez disputed Mr. El-Abesh’s version of
events, stating that the tests had been paid for and passed. “We paid Fatah University its
fees, who confirmed that the samples taken had met with the required technical

specifications.” °°? Mr. Napowanez’s testimony is supported by photocopies of a certified

check to the University Office for Engineering Consultancy for LYD16,545, stamped as
having been received, and of the university’s signed and stamped receipt.** Respondent

did not dispute the authenticity of these documents.

Respondent’s Rejoinder seeks to counter this evidence with a January 2018 letter to the
TPB from the University’s Engineering Consulting Office. This letter states that Al Hani
did not pay the remaining test fees of LYD16,545, so that the results “will not be handed
to the company until it was paid the amount owed to the office.”*? The Tribunal has two
observations regarding this letter, which was obtained by TPB a few months before the
Hearing in this arbitration. First, it conflicts with Respondent’s occasional speculative
arguments that Al Hani had the results and knew that they were unsatisfactory, and so
concealed them. The January 2018 letter says that Al Hani cannot see the results until it
pays. Second, it is flatly inconsistent with the Consulting Office’s official signed and sealed
receipt given to Al Hani in March 2013, acknowledging receipt of Al Hani’s certified check
for LYD16,545.°"°

(@) The Tribunal’s Analysis and Decision

The events summarized here show a recurring pattern in which RBA and TPB rebuffed
multiple attempts by Al Hani over the course of multiple years to secure acceptance of
completed road work, much of it placed into service years before. The evidence indicates
that Al Hani sought to remedy defects cited by RBA in this process. These efforts were
never good enough. Instead, throughout this period, RBA was content to leave the
responsibility and expense of repairing damage from accidents, removing sand, and

remedying design defects on Al Hani.

In the circumstances, the Tribunal finds that Al Hani is entitled to the amount of the

retentions held by Respondent under the Benghazi Contract.

FTI’s final presentation to the Tribunal did not give contract-by-contract figures for the
claimed amount of retentions. Blackrock’s final presentation to the Tribunal at the Hearing
identified FTI’s final figure for the Benghazi retentions to be €2,790,715; Blackrock’s
corresponding final figure was €2,753,085, utilizing the exchange rate indicated by FTI.*!'
The reason for the approximately €47,000 difference was not explained and is not readily

apparent to the Tribunal.

In light of this ambiguity in the evidence, the Tribunal elects to split minor difference
between the two experts’ valuations. Pursuant to Article 8(1) of the Treaty, the Tribunal

awards €2,780,000 in respect of this portion of the claim.

B. The Misurata Contract

The Parties’ experts appear to agree that Respondent holds retentions for work on the

Misurata road repair contract in the amount of €1,909,862.9!

As mentioned above, the Misurata Contract was concluded by Strabag International and
the RBA in April 2007,°"? and later transferred to Al Hani with the consent of the Libyan
authorities. As discussed supra, the project then was affected by substantial delays. The
Parties dispute responsibility for these delays and whether Al Hani is entitled to additional
compensation for them. Both Parties’ primary emphasis regarding this contract in these

proceedings involves these delay issues.

Work on the project was still underway at the time of the 2011 Revolution, and the project
was then one of three (along with the TIAR and Garaboulli road projects) for which Al

Hani signed recommencement agreements after the Revolution.?!*

According to Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, “[b]y February 2011, when the 2011
Revolution commenced, Al-Hani had performed roughly two thirds of the works under the
Misurata Contract.”°'> In his First Witness Statement, Mr. Knaack said that Al Hani had
completed “significant sections” of Misurata and other roads, and that they were being used
for traffic.?'® This is consistent with Respondent’s statement that about two-thirds of the

work was completed.

The record regarding Al Hani’s efforts to secure release of the retentions is less detailed
than for the Benghazi Contract. Respondent’s Counter-Memorial mentions one effort by

Al Hani to gain provisional acceptance of a portion of the road:

In or around August 2010, Al-Hani requested provisional

acceptance of the first section of the road. Pursuant to the Contract,

a technical committee, with the participation of Al-Hani, was

formed. The technical committee found rutting problems with the

road, paint jobs failing to meet specifications, and areas where no

shoulder works were performed. In view of these considerable

issues, the committee refused to grant provisional acceptance.°!”
Respondent bases this statement regarding the claimed inspection and defects in
performance on an undated letter from the “Committee for Provisional Acceptance to the
Main and Branch Roads Department of TPB.”°'® This letter is signed by only two of the
three committee members and bears no stamps or seals, as frequently appear on TPB’s

official correspondence.

In his Witness Statement, Mr. El-Abesh adds that “[t]o date, the works in that section are

still out of specification. For this reason, provisional acceptance has not occurred.”°!?

Claimant indicates a different understanding of these events:

... [T]he first part of the Misurata road, between Misurata and
Al-Hesha, was complete and ready for hand-over to the TPB.
Accordingly, on 11 August 2010, Al Hani wrote to the TPB
requesting provisional acceptance of this 78 km stretch of
the road.

The TPB only responded five months later, on 24 January
2011, indicating that it intended to form an inspection
committee that would meet on 30 January 2011. However,
to the Claimant’s knowledge, no meeting of the inspection
committee ever took place, with the result that the
Respondent has failed to reimburse to Al Hani any of the
retention monies for this completed stretch of the road.°”°

765. Claimant cites in this regard a 24 January 2011 letter from the TPB, notifying Al Hani that

a committee had been formed and would visit the works on 30 January 2011.°?! This was

at the time that revolutionary unrest was beginning in eastern Libya.

accepted, it has been open to traffic for many years:

(@) The Tribunal’s Analysis and Decision

The record is less extensive with respect to the Misurata Contract, and there is conflicting
evidence regarding the status of Al Hani’s efforts to gain provisional acceptance. However,
Respondent and its witness confirm that at least two-thirds of the work was completed and
that the road, improved by work performed by Al Hani, has now been open to traffic “for

many years.”

Thus, Respondent has had the benefit of Al Hani’s work on the road over a substantial
period, while keeping the retentions. Al Hani did tender the work for approval, although
the evidence is conflicting and inconclusive regarding the result. However, in the
circumstances, the Tribunal again concludes, in keeping with the role of good faith in the
performance of contracts, that Al Hani is entitled to recover the amount of the retentions
held by Respondent. As noted, Claimant’s and Respondent’s valuation experts both place
this amount to be €1,909,862, 3 which is the amount awarded by the Tribunal pursuant to

Article 8(1) of the Contract.

C. The TIAR Contract

To recall, the TIAR Contract involved the re-construction and upgrading of the access road
to Tripoli’s International Airport. The Parties’ valuation experts agree that Respondent
retained €1,883,705 in respect of work performed by Al Hani on the Contract.°*4 It also
appears agreed that as of the time of the Revolution, the project was 75% complete.??> Mr.
Napowanez states in this regard that “[b]y February 2011 we had completed much of the
construction work on the Airport Road, with only works on the westernmost lane in the

urban section of the road outstanding.””°

During the currency of the TIAR Contract, Al Hani requested the
RBA or TPB on multiple occasions from as early as 11 October
2009 to take provisional acceptance of completed sections of the
road. On 20 February 2011, the TPB approved the establishment of
a committee to arrange for the provisional acceptance of the road,
but to the best of the Claimant’s knowledge no further steps were
taken.”

771, Mr. Napowanez cites multiple letters from Al Hani to RBA®* requesting RBA or TPB to

take possession of the road. He states:

As we completed work on sections of road, they were immediately
opened to traffic. | requested the RBA several times to take primary
receipt of sections of the road, but there was no response from the
RBA and the provisional acceptance process was never initiated.°”°
772. Respondent offered limited comments with respect to this claim. In his First Witness

Statement, Mr. El-Abesh says only the following:

By the time of the 201] Revolution, Al-Hani had completed
approximately 75% of the works under the TIAR Contract.
However, it had not completed provisional acceptance of any
portion of the road.

I note that Claimant has now requested the release of LYD 3.2
million of retention money for the TIAR project. That money cannot
be released until the provisional acceptance process is completed.*°

(@) The Tribunal’s Analysis and Decision

773. Thus, Respondent again has had the benefit of Claimant’s work on a substantially
completed and important project, but has held the retentions. In the circumstances, the
Tribunal again concludes, in keeping with the role of good faith in the performance of

contracts, that Claimant is entitled to recover the amount of the retentions held by

D. The Tajura Contract

Claimant seeks €989,766 for amounts withheld under the Tajura Contract. However, this
project was far from complete when work was interrupted by the Revolution, and Claimant
does not contend that Respondent has any current benefits or advantages from the work Al
Hani did complete. Respondent further points out in its Rejoinder that Claimant did not

recovery of the retained amounts present under some other contracts are not present here.
This portion of the claim is denied.

E. The Garaboulli Contract

Claimant also seeks €336,184 with respect to amounts withheld from payments under the
Garaboulli Contract.°>? This was the final contract concluded by Al Hani in Libya, and at
the time of the Revolution, approximately 5% of the work had been completed. Here, as
with the Tajura Contract, Respondent gained no significant benefit from a substantially
completed project, nor did Al Hani seek provisional acceptance of any of its work. The
considerations warranting recovery of the retained amounts under some other contracts are

not present here.

This portion of the claim is denied.

(2) Conclusion Regarding the Retention Amounts

For the reasons given here, pursuant to Article 8(1) of the Treaty, the Tribunal awards
€6,573,567 in respect of the claims for the amounts of retentions for the Benghazi,
Misurata, and TIAR Contracts. Claimant’s claims for retentions for the Tajura and

Garaboulli Contracts are denied.

CLAIMS 6.1 — 6.4. CLAIMS RELATED TO EXCEPTIONAL / FORCE MAJEURE EVENTS

Pursuant to Article 8(1) of the Treaty, Claimant seeks substantial amounts for injuries said
to result from the events of 2011, based on “Article 36 and related provisions of the

Contracts.”9>

qd) Claimant’s Position

As initially presented in Claimant’s Memorial, this claim was for about €56.5 million.?°°
Approximately €22.23 million was for immobilization of equipment, notably for
depreciation while equipment was idle; Respondent’s quantification expert did not dispute
that such claims for immobilization of equipment were a proper element of damages should
the Tribunal find liability. An additional €21.67 million reflected lost or damaged

equipment, and €9.97 million was for bond and insurance costs.

As the case progressed, Claimant’s experts from FTI deleted claims for lost/damaged
equipment that were duplicated in other claims. As presented by FTI at the Hearing, the
modified claim totals €37,148,520,%7 of which about €24.3 million is for “immobilized
equipment” and €10.3 million for “financial charges” (bonds and insurance).%* The
remainder of the claim, approximately €2.36 million, is for stand-by and evacuation costs.
This last element is a relatively small part of the claim. Nevertheless, certain portions of it,
such as Claimant’s assumed per-person cost for evacuating third-country staff, received

considerable attention by the experts and at the Hearing.

782. Claimant’s arguments and FTI’s analyses did not allocate the claimed damages contract-
by-contract, but amounts claimed for each contract are contained in letters sent by Al Hani
to its contract partners in September 2011 setting out Al Hani’s claimed entitlement under

various contracts for the period 20 February 2011 until the end of June 2011. These

letters were subsequently updated several times.”#°

783. Claimant summarized its position in its Post-Hearing Brief:

The so-called ‘Article 36 Claims” were triggered by the
Respondent’s failure to observe the obligations under Article 36 of
the Contracts (for the Garaboulli, TIAR and Tajura Contracts, as
modified) and Article 105 of the Administrative Contracts
Regulations.

The Claimant’s case is straightforward: Al Hani was entitled to
compensation for exceptional circumstances and duly notified its
claims to the Authorities in September 2011. There appears to be no
dispute that exceptional circumstances existed at the time, giving
rise to the claims for compensation, and that the Authorities failed
to [sic] any compensation. The Respondent has accordingly failed
to observe its obligations in breach of Article 8(1) of the Treaty.”4'

(2) Respondent’s Position

784. Respondent denies that any compensation is due. As explained in its Post-Hearing Brief,

Respondent maintains that (i) the Libyan Revolution and ongoing
hostilities have amounted to force majeure, not just “exceptional
circumstances,” and (ii) Al-Hani is not entitled to compensation for
damages as a result of the force majeure situation either under the
terms of the Contracts or Libyan law. Although the applicable force
majeure provisions vary by Contract, none of the Contracts provide
for compensation in the event of force majeure.°?

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 260 of 337

In the Counter-Memorial, Respondent advances an additional argument affecting the three
contracts for which the Parties concluded Recommencement Agreements (the Misurata,
TIAR and Garaboulli Contracts). Respondent contends that their force majeure provisions
“were later superseded by their respective Recommencement Agreements, which in Article
2 provided for a separate and exclusive process to determine losses due to the 2011
Revolution.”*> Thus, for these three contracts, “compensation is only available through

the mechanism and for the amounts established by the Recommencement Agreements.”°**

The Parties agree that the relevant contract provisions vary, so that the contracts must be

analyzed in light of their specific terms.

(3) The Parties’ Legal Experts

As these claims involved significant questions of Libyan law, the Parties’ legal experts
played an important role. Dr. Abuda and Dr. Ahnish, the Parties’ respective experts, offered
substantial opinions on the parties’ respective rights under the several contracts, agreeing
on some matters, and not on others. The expert offered by Respondent, Dr. Abuda,
expressed opinions that, if accepted by the Tribunal, would significantly limit
compensation for these claims. Accordingly, the Tribunal must consider a matter bearing

on his evidence.

At the Hearing, counsel for Claimant referred to documents showing that Dr. Abuda served
as head of the Twenty Committee, and thus played a significant role in devising Libya’s
policies related to treatment of foreign investors and investments after the Revolution. This
fact was relevant to the Tribunal’s assessment of the independence and objectivity of Dr.
Abuda’s evidence. However, his role as head of the Twenty Committee was not disclosed
in his Expert Opinions or otherwise by Respondent. Respondent’s counsel acknowledged

in response to the Tribunal’s question at the Hearing that it should have been disclosed.

Nevertheless, Dr. Abuda’s significant connection with the Respondent was not disclosed
to the Tribunal until Claimant raised the issue. Claimant’s Post-Hearing Brief contends that
this failure to disclose shows that he was not an independent expert®® and that his

testimony should be given no weight.”*”

Following Dr. Abuda’s testimony at the Hearing, the presiding arbitrator stated that “the
Tribunal will certainly take the failure to disclose [his role as head of the Twenty
Committee] into account in its consideration of his testimony,”** further observing
“{c]ertainly, he might have had some value _ had he been tendered as a witness of fact, but
he was not.”*4? The Tribunal has taken this situation into account in assessing the

credibility and weight of Dr. Abuda’s evidence.

(4) The Tribunal’s Analysis and Decision

A, Article 36 and Articles 105 and 106 of the Administrative Contracts
Regulations
The Tribunal begins with an observation regarding the nature of force majeure provisions
under contracts or general law. These exist to allocate risks resulting from exceptional,
often large-scale, events that cannot be anticipated or prudently planned for. These events
typically impose costs on both contractors and their employers. Through contract
provisions such as Article 36, the contracting parties agree on the allocation of those costs.
The Tribunal’s task is thus to identify and give effect to the risk allocation agreed by the

parties in each contract.

Each of the contracts at issue, except the TIAR-NE Design Contract, includes an identically
worded Article 36. The Parties’ experts both utilized the following translation of this

provision:

If general, exceptional, irreversible and unanticipated circumstances

occur, render execution of the obligation exhausting, and expose the

Second Party to grave loss, but do not render execution impossible,

the Second Party may request compensation that restores the

financial equilibrium of the contract to a reasonable level. If these

circumstances persist, and there is no hope that they will cease, the

contract may be terminated. In addition, the Second Party may be

exempted from executing its obligations, if force majeure occurs

rendering execution of the contract impossible. °°°
The Parties and their experts agree that this provision gives effect to principles of Libyan
law that recognize two different situations: exceptional circumstances and force
majeure.°°'! They also agree that in Libyan law, the two situations have different legal

consequences.”” The fundamental difference between the Parties concerned which

situation existed in Libya at relevant times.

The experts agree that the first leg of Article 36, which mirrors Libya’s Administrative
Contracts Regulations,’ deals with situations involving “exceptional circumstances,”
where contract performance can be resumed but potentially at a significant cost to the
contractor. Where there are such “exceptional circumstances,” a contractor may request
compensation to “restore the financial equilibrium of the contract.” Claimant maintains
that the circumstances of 2011 reflected exceptional circumstances, entitling it to such

compensation.

The second leg of Article 36, again mirroring the Administrative Contract Regulations,
gives a contractor the right to terminate the contract if force majeure continues and relieves
the contractor of its obligation to perform if force majeure renders performance

impossible.°** This second leg does not authorize any compensation. Respondent contends

that the events of 2011 and subsequently involved continuing conditions of force majeure

precluding performance, so there was no right to compensation.

The Parties’ experts agree that parties to a contract can agree to modify application of the
provisions of the Administrative Contracts Regulations dealing with situations that disrupt
contract performance, and that they have done so with the Garaboulli, TIAR and Tajura
Contracts.°°> The Tribunal considers the effect of these three amendments infra. However,
three of the contracts (Benghazi, Misurata and TIAR-NE) were not amended, so the
possibility of compensation is governed by Article 36 (Benghazi, Misurata), or the
Administrative Contract Regulations (TIAR-NE). The Tribunal considers these three

contracts first.

B. Claimant’s Position Regarding Article 36

Claimant maintains that circumstances in Libya following the Revolution should be
characterized as exceptional circumstances warranting compensation under the first
sentence of Article 36, not as force majeure. In his First Opinion, Dr. Ahnish opined that
the events of 2011 were exceptional circumstances whose continuation later ripened into a

situation of force majeure that continues to the present day:

I am of the view that continuation of the events of 2011 for some
time and the sporadic uncertainty that still exists until now amounts
to Force Majeure as it is not yet evident that the current Government
has effective control over the territory of Libya. A reasonable
interpretation of Libyan law would lead to the conclusion that the
continuation of the unrest in Libya since 2011, coupled with the
sporadic violence that is still continuing, confirms that the
unforeseeable and unanticipated circumstances that took place in
Libya in 2011 have continued and culminated into an event of force
majeure. °°

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 264 of 337

At the Hearing, Dr. Ahnish confirmed that, in his view, there was a period of exceptional
circumstances in the aftermath of the Revolution marked by negotiation of the
Recommencement Agreements, but that the evolving security situation subsequently led to

a situation of force majeure that has continued:°*”

[It] seems from what I have known from the documents that I have
reviewed, there are two events, one that started with exceptional
circumstances, and the Parties tried to deal with that in what they
call the Resumption Agreement, and after that the Parties--the event
of exceptional circumstances continued to the extent that it becomes
force majeure under Libyan law.°*

C. Respondent’s Position Regarding Article 36

Respondent counters that there has existed a continuous period of force majeure in Libya
rendering performance of the contracts impossible, beginning with the Revolution in 2011
and continuing to the present day. As expressed by Respondent’s counsel on the first day
of the Hearing, “[w]hat we have here in this case is impossibility. We have had persistent,
protracted extraordinary circumstances that prevent performance.”®° In Respondent’s
view, “the continuous impossibility of performance since the 2011 Revolution cannot be
doubted, as the facts demonstrate a persistent, protracted period of circumstances

preventing performance.”°°

Dr. Abuda endorsed Respondent’s position. In his opinion, the events of 2011 constituted

force majeure; in response to the Tribunal’s question at the Hearing, he confirmed that “the

force majeure situation still prevails.”°°' In his opinion, this force majeure situation

rendered performance of the contracts impossible, and the contractor was therefore not

entitled to compensation under Libyan law:°°?

In terms of compensation due as a result of force majeure, the
default rule under Article 168 of the Civil Code is that no
compensation is due by a person if the injury results from a cause
outside his control such as unforeseen circumstances or an event of
force majeure. Neither the Civil Code, nor the Administrative
Contracts Regulation entitle the parties to compensation due to force
majeure?

Neither the Administrative Contracts Regulation nor the contracts at
issue here refer to an intention to deviate from the default rules of
the Civil Code. Therefore, in the event of impossibility due to force
majeure, RBA, TPB and HIB are also (i) legally exempt from
performing their obligations, (ii) not liable to make reparation for
damages arising from force majeure if the injury resulted from a
cause beyond their control and (iii) the corresponding contract may
be terminated.

D. Were the Contracts Terminated by Force Majeure?

801. There is another apparent difference of view between the legal experts as to the effect of
force majeure under Article 36 on the continued existence of the contracts. In cross-
examination, Dr. Ahnish expressed the view that such force majeure automatically
terminated an affected contract by operation of law, even without notice of termination or

similar action by the contractor:°°>

Q. ... SO, you are saying that regardless of whether the Parties —
either Party declared a termination, you’re saying, as a
matter of Libyan law, they were terminated.

A. I think the Declaration, in my view, as a matter of Libyan
law, the Declaration, the termination would be of a
declaratory nature rather than an obligation with a party to ...
explicitly announce the termination. What caused the
termination is a force majeure ...°°
Dr. Abuda did not share this view, indicating that under Libyan law, a contract “may” be
terminated in circumstances of force majeure, as indeed is clear from the text of Article 36,

which gives an affected contractor a right to terminate, but termination is not automatic.%°”

The Parties’ conduct is not consistent with Dr. Ahnish’s suggestion that the contracts were
automatically terminated by force majeure. Based on the evidence, in the months after the
end of the Revolution in October 2011, both Parties displayed interest in resuming work
and clearly did not view the contracts as having been terminated. As noted supra, in the
spring of 2012, Respondent’s authorities created the “Twenty Committee” which
developed policy guidance for government bodies in restoring contract relations with
foreign contractors.** Much additional evidence shows the Parties’ shared understanding
that the contracts were not terminated and could be brought back into operation.

Respondent’s Counter-Memorial points out, for example:

307. Two days after the liberation of Libya on October 23, 2011,
Al-Hani wrote to TPB, stating that it was assessing its losses
in order to resume works under the contracts ...

308. In December 2011, TPB wrote to Al-Hani to see whether it
was interested in recommencing works under the TIAR
Contract. On February 7, 2012, TPB met with Al-Hani to
explore the possibility of recommencing works.°°°

The Minutes of a 7 February 2012 meeting between Mr. El-Abesh and Al Hani

representatives are to the same effect. They state that “Eng. Sami Al-Abish informed that

the Libyan Government instructed the TPB to contact the National Companies to discuss
the subject of recommencement and completion of their projects as soon as possible.”°”°
(At the Hearing, Mr. El-Abesh denied the statement attributed to him regarding instructions

from the Libyan Government,””!

although he previously cited the Minutes of the 7 February
meeting as an exhibit to his First Witness Statement without any reservation.) In any case,
the uncontested portions of the document clearly show TPB’s wish to get on with projects

that had been interrupted, not to terminate the contracts.

Beginning in 2012, the Parties entered into negotiations for the Recommencement
Agreements on terms that assumed the continued existence of the contracts. As Respondent
points out, “[iJn the Recommencement Agreements, the parties expressly stated their

intention to resume works that had been suspended because of the 2011 Revolution.”°”

In
2014, TPB, concerned that Al Hani had not recommenced work under four road contracts
(including the Benghazi Contract, for which there was no Recommencement Agreement)
wrote to Al Hani that if work was not recommenced TPB would “start the procedures to

withdraw these contracts.”°73

Claimant continued to perform under the contracts, maintaining in force substantial
financial guarantees; indeed, Claimant claims for amounts it has paid and continues to pay

for these as part of the relief sought in this case.

Thus, the Parties clearly regarded these contracts as remaining in force, and Respondent’s
representatives and its counsel at the Hearing confirmed to the Tribunal that they have not
been terminated.°”* Based on the record and uncontested statements regarding the
contracts’ status at the Hearing, the Tribunal does not accept that they have been

terminated.

E. Article 36: Exceptional Circumstances or Force Majeure?

The Tribunal is confronted with two competing visions of the situation under Article 36 of
the contracts and relevant provisions of Libyan law. Is there a continuing situation of force
majeure that began in 2011 and has since rendered performance of the contracts
permanently impossible, as Respondent contends? Or, was there a period of exceptional
circumstances, during which it was possible to resume performance, although subsequent
events transformed the situation into an enduring situation of force majeure, as Claimant

contends?

It does appear that for a time following the Revolution, the parties to these contracts
believed there was a possibility to resume work under some of them, and took actions to
that end. However, the Tribunal assesses that the actual course of events shows this belief.
was not correct. As matters developed, Al Hani was not able to resume work. Indeed, Mr.
Napowanez, Claimant’s senior representative in Libya, writes that “I left Libya in early
2014 as the security situation had worsened, and Strabag’s management did not consider it

safe for me to remain in Libya.”9”°

The Tribunal has considered supra evidence regarding post-Revolutionary conditions in
Libya in connection with Libya’s courts’ ability to fairly and safely adjudicate claims under
these contracts and other matters.°”° Additional evidence submitted by both Parties
indicates that conditions in Libya following the Revolution would not have allowed the

resumption of substantial work under Al Hani’s contracts.

Respondent, for example, points out that:

- In January 2012, clashes erupted between former rebel forces in Benghazi, reflecting
discontent with the pace and nature of change under the governing National

Transitional Council (“NTC”).°”7

- The NTC struggled to control local armed militias, especially in the western part of the
country. In June 2012, one of the militias, the Al-Awfea Brigade, briefly took over
Tripoli International Airport, and the election commission building in Benghazi was

ransacked by mobs.°7®

- Protests erupted again following the GNC’s refusal to disband after the expiration of
its mandate in February 2014, and fighting subsequently broke out between forces loyal
to the outgoing GNC and the new Parliament. In July 2014, UN staff left the country,
embassies shut down and foreigners were again evacuated. The Tripoli International
Airport was destroyed for the most part in the fighting that took place in July and
August 2014.97

812. Claimant offers a similar litany of serious security concerns after the Revolution:

- Claimant’s Memorial observes that “[d]Juring the course of 2013, Al Hani experienced

increasingly serious issues related to the security situation in Libya.”°*°

- Mr. Napowanez emphasized this deteriorating security situation in 2013, as Al Hani
was preparing to resume some work. “[D]uring this period, the security situation got
worse. The security situation in Libya after we returned to Libya was manageable, but
we still had to be very careful about our movements. However, in 2013 the situation
deteriorated ... One particularly serious incident occurred on 15 May 2013 at the

employees and the security of its operations.”**

- According to Mr. Napowanez, “[w]ith increased physical danger, and the lack of
protection that we were getting from the Libyan police and security forces, we could

not guarantee the safety of the sites of our employees.”?*

- Mr. Knaak states that “[i]n 2013, the security situation in the country deteriorated. With
our ongoing cash-flow problems and faced with the deteriorating security situation, it
became increasingly apparent that we would not be able to proceed with the

contracts.”°**

F. The Tribunal’s Decision on Exceptional / Force Majeure Events

Given this and other similar evidence in the record, the Tribunal finds that conditions in
Libya since the end of the Revolution in 2011 have constituted force majeure for purposes
of Article 36 of the Benghazi, Misurata, and TIAR-NE Contracts, as contended by

Respondent.

(5) The Effect of the Recommencement Agreements

Respondent advances a further argument regarding the three contracts that were the subject
of Recommencement Agreements (the Misurata, TIAR, and Garaboulli Contracts).
Respondent contends that these contracts’ force majeure provisions “were later superseded
by their respective Recommencement Agreements, which in Article 2 provided for a
separate and exclusive process to determine losses due to the 2011 Revolution.”*** Thus,
for these contracts, “compensation is only available through the mechanism and for the

amounts established by the Recommencement Agreements.”?°

815. Thus, for example, Article 2 of the Misurata Recommencement Agreement provides:

The second party will not claim, as main condition for resuming
work in the project, value of compensations of any direct or indirect
damages as a result of the events that occurred in the country. The
damages will be specified by forming a committee from the owner
in the presence of the contractor as proof for the case and settlement
of the compensation will be according [to] the state’s decision in the
compensation.°*7
816. The Tribunal notes that the primary thrust of this provision is to oblige Al Hani not to claim
compensation for its damages from the Revolution as a condition for resuming work. It
does not alter any entitlement to damages under the relevant contract and legal provisions.
It is procedural in character, indicating a procedure through which these claims could in
the future be asserted and assessed through a committee to be created, and that, so far as

the Tribunal is aware, never has been created.

817. In any case, the Parties’ experts agree that the Recommencement Agreements could not
have affected Claimant’s claimed rights in respect of these damages. As stated in

Respondent’s Rejoinder, the Agreements are in a “state of suspension.” They

would have had an effect on Article 36 if Al-Hani had resumed
works. Because Al-Hani never did so these Contracts remain in a
state of suspension (similar to the TIAR-NE, Benghazi and Tajura
Contracts). Claimant agrees that because “Al-Hani could not
recommence its works under the Contracts, then the Parties are to
revert to the provisions of the original Contracts.”°**

818. In cross-examination, when directed to this passage in the Rejoinder, Dr. Abuda,

Respondent’s legal expert, endorsed it:

Q. So, there [i.e., in the Rejoinder] the Respondent seems to say
that the Recommencement Agreements are suspended, and
the Original Contracts apply. Is that also your opinion?

A. When an agreement is suspended with specific conditions
and terms such as the recommencement of the work and the
contractor does not recommence the work, it means that this
Agreement is not enforced because one of the parties did not
implement it, and the original text remains prevailing over
the other.

Q. So, the Recommencement Agreements would only have
prevailed over the original agreements if the
Recommencement Agreements had been in force. Is that
what you’re saying?

A. Yes, yes.°8?

819. Dr. Ahnish, Claimant’s legal expert, expressed a similar conclusion. In his view, the
Recommencement Agreements established two conditions | recommencement of the
works, and the ability to complete them within 900 days “without interruption attributable

to the disturbances following” the Revolution:

If either of the two conditions failed to materialise, it is my opinion
that the Recommencement Agreements were to cease to apply, in
their entirety, because the whole purpose of entering into the
Recommencement Agreements would be frustrated. If disturbances
continued and, as a consequence thereof, Al Hani could not
recommence its works under the Contracts, then the Parties are to
revert to the provisions of the original Contracts in every
aspect/matter relating thereto.”

820. The conditions described by Dr. Ahnish were, of course, not met. The Parties’ experts thus
point to the same conclusion: that the Recommencement Agreements are not relevant for
the Tribunal’s present task of assessing whether any compensation is due in respect of the

claimed injuries. The Tribunal accordingly does not consider them further here.

(6) Implications of Force Majeure for the Benghazi, Misurata, and TIAR-NE
Contracts

The Tribunal first considers the implications of its finding of force majeure for the

Benghazi, Misurata, and TIAR-NE Contracts. In the first two, Article 36 is the governing

text.°?' Article 36 does not appear in the TIAR-NE Contract, but the substantively identical

provisions of the Government Contracting Regulations instead apply.

Given the Tribunal’s conclusion that events in Libya since 2011 constitute force majeure
for purposes of Article 36 and the Government Contracting Regulations, Al Hani has no
right to compensation for its force majeure related losses under the Benghazi and Misurata
contracts. It has the right to terminate the contracts, a right it has not exercised. Further, Al
Hani “may be exempted from executing its obligations if force majeure occurs rendering
execution of the contract impossible.” But the contractually-agreed allocation of loss under
Article 36 places the burden of Al Hani’s losses from the Revolution and subsequent events

on Al Hani, not on Respondent.

The same applies to the TIAR-NE Contract, which is governed by the corresponding
principles of the Government Contracting Regulations. No compensation is due with
respect to any force majeure-related losses related to this contract, although it appears that

none is claimed.

The Tribunal notes that, even if the prevailing conditions were assessed to be “exceptional
circumstances” and not force majeure, it is not apparent that compensation would have

been available under these contracts.

Events in Libya in the months after the Revolution did not correspond to the logic of the
first clause of Article 36 and the corresponding provisions of Libyan law and regulations.
Claimant’s expert evidence explains that the purpose of allowing compensation for

“exceptional circumstances” is to allow work on public contracts to be continued or

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 274 of 337

resumed. In his Second Expert Opinion, Dr. Ahnish described the underlying policy
rationale to be that “the administrative authority must bear a portion of this financial burden
in order to ensure that the contractor can continue to perform the contract and, in turn,

ensure that public works are not disrupted.”**

Against this background, both experts express the view that the first clause of Article 36
authorizes compensation only if work is resumed during or after the force majeure
period.°®> According to Dr. Abuda, under this provision and Article 105 of the Regulations,
“if the contractor notifies the other party of the end of force majeure, then it has to resume
performance, unless performance becomes permanently impossible.”°* Dr. Ahnish

expresses a similar understanding of Article 36, writing:

Unlike in respect of the TIAR, Garaboulli and Tajura Contracts, this

“compensation” becomes due only if the Second Party continues to

perform its obligations under the Benghazi and/or the Misurata

Contracts. Termination for force majeure itself as defined in Article

36 (without amendment) does not trigger compensation.*”°
Claimant disputes this interpretation in the Reply,°%° but the Tribunal finds that it is most
consistent with the wording and structure of the first clause of Article 36. This provision
deals with situations where continuing or resuming work is not “impossible” but is
“exhausting” and exposes the contractor to “grave loss.” If so, the contractor “may request”
compensation to “restore the financial equilibrium ... to a reasonable level.” The contract
thus envisages a process of adjustment so that work can continue or resume. The contractor
may seek not full compensation but amounts sufficient to restore the balance of rights
under the contract to a “reasonable” level so that the contractor can resume or continue

work.

982 9"4 Ahnish Opinion, p. 6 (emphasis added).

°°3 The first sentence of the translation of Article 36 can perhaps be read to mean that there can be compensation only
if the contractor continues to work during the period of upheaval, but this would be inconsistent with the common
understanding of force majeure. Neither Party’s expert takes this view.

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 275 of 337

This understanding of Article 36 indicates that no compensation would be available with
respect to the Benghazi Contract even if there had been “exceptional circumstances.” The
evidence shows that by 2011 work on this project was virtually complete. The road was
open to traffic; portions had been open for several years. As discussed above, there were
limited remaining issues involving final acceptance and recovery of retention monies, but
for all practical purposes, the project was finished. Al Hani had no realistic expectation or
desire to return to work on it after the Revolution, save to the limited extent of its
unsuccessful efforts to recover the retentions. No compensation was needed to enable Al

Hani to resume work.

The situation related to the Misurata Contract is somewhat different. Work was well
advanced on the project, but it was not as near to final completion as the Benghazi project.
Respondent’s desire to conclude a Recommencement Agreement indicates that it wished
further work on the road. However, Al Hani did not resume work, either under the original
contract nor the Recommencement Agreement. Given this, it is not clear that compensation
would be due under this contract, even if the prevailing conditions were deemed to be

exceptional circumstances.

The Tribunal concludes that no compensation was due under the Benghazi, Misurata and

TIAR-NE Contracts.

(7) The Garaboulli, TIAR and Tajura Contracts
A. Garaboulli and TIAR Contracts

The Garaboulli, TIAR, and Tajura Contracts all include additional clauses, each captioned
and worded differently, that both Parties’ legal experts agree supersede or modify the
application of Article 36.°” All three amendments use language that does not by its terms
reflect the distinction between exceptional circumstances and force majeure. Instead, the
three contracts all utilize the term “force majeure” in its broader and more generally

understood meaning, not the limited sense it is used in Article 36.

832. Dr. Abuda and Dr. Ahnish offer slightly different translations of the amendments to the
Garaboulli and TIAR Contracts, but their translations do not differ in substance. In Dr.

Abuda’s translation of the Garaboulli Contract:

If Second Party is unable to fulfil its obligations under the contract
due to force majeure, it shall be entitled to obtain an extension and
monetary compensation due to the delay.

If the obstacle to execution of the work persists, due to the force
majeure, for 60 days or for multiple periods totaling more than 90
days, the Second Party shall be entitled to terminate the contract,
and recoup all losses and costs resulting therefrom.°”*

833. Dr. Ahnish’s translation is similar in substance.°””
834. In Dr. Abuda’s translation, the TIAR amendment provides:

In the event of exceptional circumstances that prevent the Second
Party from executing the work, such as force majeure, the Second
Party shall be entitled to extension of time and costs as a result
thereof.

If these circumstances continue for a period of 60 days, or there is
an increase exceeding 90 days, the Second Party shall be entitled to
terminate the contract, and shall be compensated by the First Party
for the losses and expenses. '”

() The Tribunal’s Assessment of the TIAR and Garaboulli Contracts
Amendments

836. These clauses entitle the contractor to receive compensation in circumstances where it is
not available under Article 36. They give the contractor different rights depending on the

gravity of the situation. Thus, according to Dr. Ahnish:

Under this amendment, compensation payable to the Second Party
in the event of continuation to perform is twofold: (i) “extension of
time and (ii) costs incurred as a result thereof [the delay]” (emphasis
is mine). Payment of compensation awarded to the Second Party in
the event of continuation to perform its duties under these Contracts
is no longer left to the absolute discretion of the judge upon applying
the principle of “restoring the financial equilibrium” of the contract
to a reasonable level as provided under Article 36. Under the
amendment of Article 14, the level of compensation is now defined
with some clarity: “costs incurred as a result of the delay” meaning,
all costs incurred by the Second Party resulting from the delay.

If the unforeseen event developed into force majeure that triggers
termination, again the Second. Party under Article 14 shall be
entitled to “compensation for losses and expenses incurred.”

Therefore, under the above Garaboulli and TIAR Contracts, the
level of compensation payable in the event of continuation is “costs
incurred” or “financial compensation” as a result of the delay. In the
event of termination, the level of compensation is the same: to
“recover all losses and costs incurred” or “compensation for the
losses or expenses”. !°°

837. Dr. Abuda agrees that under these amendments, the contractor is entitled to full
compensation, and not some reduced amount under the “equilibrium” concept, including
compensation in case of termination. For him, the amendments “modify the effect of force
majeure by allowing the contractor to recover all occurred losses and expenses due to force

majeure when performance becomes impossible.” !°

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 278 of 337

Thus, the experts agree that if there are force majeure conditions force majeure as
generally understood, and not in the limited sense the term is used in Article 36 a
contractor can obtain both an extension and “compensation due to the delay.” If these
conditions persist “for 60 days or for multiple periods totaling more than 90 days,” the
contractor has additional rights: the option to terminate the contract and the right to recover

its “losses and costs.”

The contracts thus make compensation available in both situations delay, and ultimate
impossibility | although the use of different language suggests that the extent of

compensation might be different in each case.

Dr. Ahnish addresses the meaning of “compensation for delay” under the two amendments.

In his view:

The meaning of the expressions “compensation for delay’ and
“losses and costs/expenses incurred” is not defined under these
Contracts; but it would certainly include the following heads of loss
which I understand that Al Hani subsequently claimed in September
2011:

Cost related to immobilization of plant and equipment;

Costs of repatriating personnel from Libya for safety reasons;
Costs of cancellation of subcontracts and purchase orders;

Standby costs of keeping personnel on site for reasonable period
until evacuation or resumptions of Works after force majeure event

ceases;

Financial charges incurred in having to keep in place bonds and
insurance pending resumption of Works under the Contracts;

Surveillance, utilities, maintenance and other costs incurred in
maintaining the sites relating to the Works pending resumption of
Works;

Damage to equipment, machinery and site facilities in 2011 not
compensated by insurance. !°°*

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 279 of 337

Dr. Abuda appeared to question this list, noting that Dr. Ahnish did not provide a basis for

his conclusions, but he offers no alternative reasoning or conclusions. ate)

Thus, Claimant is contractually entitled under the TIAR and Garaboulli Contracts to
recover “compensation due to the delay” associated with the force majeure events of 2011.
The Tribunal assesses that Dr. Ahnish’s list provides a reasonable measure of compensable
costs under these contracts. However, it notes that in the claim as ultimately presented,
Claimant’s valuation experts from FTI removed claims for cancellation of subcontracts and
purchase orders and made no claim for surveillance, maintenance and administrative
costs.'°°° The amount of compensation due under the Garaboulli and TIAR Contracts is

addressed infra.

B. The Tajura Contract

The Tajura amendment uses a different formula that includes a reference to Article 36. In

Dr. Ahnish’s translation, the provision reads:

In the event of force majeure [that] faces the Second Party, the
Second Party shall then be entitled to extension of time for the
Contract Period and shall be paid the additional expenses incurred
by idland associated therewith [with the delay] pursuant to Article
36.!

In Dr. Abuda’s similar translation:

In the event of Force Majeure facing the Second Party, the Second
Party shall be entitled to extension of time for the Contract Period
and reimbursement of his associated additional costs incurred,
pursuant to Article 36,0

845. In correspondence in 2012, Al Hani confirmed that its claim with respect to losses related

to Tajura is based on this clause. '°°°

846. This amendment, like the amendments to the TIAR and Garaboulli Contracts, diverges
from Article 36. First, it utilizes the term “force majeure” in its more commonly understood
and broader meaning, not in the limited sense used in Article 36. Under the Tajura
amendment, force majeure is not limited to situations where performance cannot be
resumed. Second, the clause gives the contractor two rights: an extension of time to

perform, and a right to compensation for delay-related expenses “pursuant to Article 36.”

847. In their opinions, both experts conclude that the cross-reference imports from Article 36
the concept that compensation is to “restore the balance of the contract.” Thus, while Dr.
Ahnish views the intention of the cross reference to be “unclear,” he assesses that “the
parties here agreed that the ‘compensation’ payable to the Contract [sic] under Article 14
shall be calculated under the criterion provided under Article 36: ‘... compensation that
restores the financial equilibrium of the Contract to a reasonable level’.”'°'? Dr. Abuda
agrees that the Article 36 principle of “restoring the balance” applies under the Tajura

amendment. '°'!

848. However, the Parties and their respective experts differ in another fundamental respect.
Respondent interprets the provision also to import Article 36’s limitation that
compensation is only available if the contractor resumes work. Respondent points out there
was no Recommencement Agreement for Tajura, and that Al Hani never resumed work.
Accordingly, in Respondent’s view, there can be no compensation for force majeure losses

under the Tajura Contract.'°?

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 281 of 337

Dr. Abuda supports Respondent’s view:

This provision seems to modify Article 36 by requiring that the
contractor, as part of restoring the balance of the contract under
Article 36, must receive an extension of time. It does not seem to
require payment of compensation when performance has become
impossible due to force majeure; otherwise, granting an extension
of time to the contractor would be meaningless. In the latter
situation, under Article 106 of the Administrative Contracts
Regulations, both parties are excused from liability.'°'>

Dr. Ahnish sees no such limitation on compensation under the amendment.

() The Tribunal’s Assessment of the Tajura Amendment

The disputed reference to Article 36 is located at the end of the clause relating to the
payment of compensation. The Tribunal finds the logical interpretation of this to be as
do both Drs. Ahnish and Abuda that it imports into the Tajura Contract the concept that
compensation for losses may be less than full. Under Article 36, compensation is limited
to that required “to restore the equilibrium of the contract.” It thus may involve something

other than full reimbursement of the costs stemming from a force-majeure-related delay.

The Tribunal does not accept Respondent’s further argument that the cross-reference to
Article 36 also imports the limitation that compensation is only available if work is
resumed. The consequence of this argument would be that the brief reference to Article 36
reintroduces the distinction between exceptional circumstances and force majeure, with
compensation only available for the former. This would effectively render the Tajura
amendment without substantial effect, as a contractor’s right to compensation would be the
same under both the amendment and under Article 36. This goes too far. The Tribunal does

not believe that in amending Article 36 the contracting parties intended a nullity.

854.

855.

856.

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 282 of 337

Accordingly, the Tribunal decides that Claimant is entitled to compensation for its damages
resulting from disruption of the Tajura Contract to the extent required to “restore the
financial equilibrium” of the contract. This requires the Tribunal to assess the meaning of

the obligation to “restore the financial equilibrium” in the facts presented here.

Dr. Ahnish indicates that this involves something short of full compensation for all losses
and excludes, for example, lost profits.'°'* His Second Expert Opinion summarizes the
jurisprudence of the French Conseil d’Etat, which he portrays as very influential in the
development of administrative law in Egypt and Libya. According to Dr. Ahnish, “the
decisions of the Conseil d’Etat as a matter of practice in the majority of cases has been to
hold the state liable for 90% of the loss. In a few rare occasions, the French Conseil d’Etat

had held states liable for 80% and 95% of the loss.”!°'%

Dr. Abuda agrees with the concept of sharing the financial burden of force majeure
conditions between the two parties, although he maintains that this allocation of burden

must be done by a judge. In his view, this idea

is reflected in Article 105 of the Administrative Contracts
Regulation: “the contractor shall have the right to compensation for
recovering the contract financial balance to a reasonable limit,”
which can be done by distributing the financial burden resulting
from these circumstances, within reason, between the contracting
parties. This rebalancing needs to be done by a judge. Justice would
not be served if only one of the parties is held responsible for such
exceptional circumstances causing hardship.'°!°

The opinions of both legal experts thus indicate that the contractor would be entitled to
compensation, but adjusted in some manner to allocate the losses between contractor and
client. However, if the Conseil d’Etat decisions are a guide to this balancing as Dr. Ahnish
contends, the reduction of the contractor’s claim would be relatively modest. The Tribunal

addresses this issue further infra.

C. The Compensation Due

As explained supra, only three of the Contracts Garaboulli, TIAR and Tajura allow for
recovery of all or a portion of what the Tribunal refers to here for convenience as “force
majeure” losses. The Benghazi, Misurata and TIAR-NE Contracts do not authorize such
compensation. The Tribunal addresses infra the question of how to allocate Claimant’s
claimed losses among the several contracts, given that Claimant presented these claims
globally and not contract-by-contract. First, however, the Tribunal must consider the total

amount of losses claimed.

As presented at the Hearing, Claimant seeks €37,148,520 for its ‘force majeure” claims.
The two Parties’ quantification experts differ regarding the claimed amount. FTI assesses
the claim for “immobilized plant and equipment,” the largest component of the claim, at
€24,770,928. Blackrock accepts that €23,111,695 of this has been documented.!°'? The
difference, almost €1.66 million, reflects Mr. Osbaldeston’s use of a lower net book value
for the equipment, reflecting his opinion that the cost of transporting equipment from port

to job site should not be included in net book value.!°!®

FTI disputes Mr. Osbaldeston’s position, pointing out, inter alia, that “[u]nder
International Accounting Standards ..., costs to transport fixed assets to the place where
they are placed in service are to be capitalized and spread out (i.e. depreciated) over the
depreciable life of the asset.”!'°'? The Tribunal finds FTI’s argument and evidence in this
regard to be persuasive, and accepts FTI’s assessment of the value of immobilized plant

and equipment, €24,770,928.

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 284 of 337

The next element of the claim involved comparatively smaller claims of €1,058,315 for the
costs of evacuating staff, and €1,300,912 for staff stand-by costs. Of these, Blackrock
accepts €603,056 of evacuation costs and €791,291 of staff stand-by costs to have been
sufficiently documented.'”° The difference between the experts thus amounts to

approximately €965,000.

Mr. Osbaldeston raises an array of objections to the claimed evacuation costs, assessing
€264,000 of local expenditures to be unsubstantiated, based, infer alia, on his view that
Mr. Knaack’s estimate of a cost of LYDI50 per evacuee, while it “does not seem
unreasonable” should have been “recorded in Cologne,” which was not subject to the
chaotic conditions prevailing in Libya.'?! As these costs were incurred in multiple
locations in the face of a chaotic situation, and the amount is, as Mr. Osbaldeston indicates,
“not unreasonable,” the Tribunal is not persuaded by this objection. Mr. Osbaldeston
further regards approximately €172,000 of flight costs as potentially duplicative. FTI
disputes this, claiming that the disputed items reflect different cost codes in Strabag’s
accounting data and were properly reflected there as separate expenditures.'°?? The
Tribunal accepts Claimant’s position in this regard, and accepts the claimed evacuation

costs as an element of the overall “force majeure” claim.

Mr. Osbaldeston also raises multiple questions regarding the €1.3 million claim for standby
staff costs. These often reflect his view that the claim lacked the “further and better
particulars” he would normally expect to find in a construction claim, or involve evidence
that he finds unclear or that is stated in foreign currencies or languages (German). © FTI
and Blackrock both identify the remaining difference between the experts in this area to be
approximately €510,000.'°74 About €190,000 of this reflects use of Al Hani’s January 2011

staff costs, rather than those from March 2011, in extrapolating staff costs for February

2011.'°5 Another €320,000 reflects Blackrock’s questioning the correctness or sufficiency
of Al Hani’s payroll data. The Tribunal does not accept Blackrock’s arguments in either

respect.

The final element involves claims for financial charges claimed on account of the
disruption of Al Hani’s/Strabag’s activities, for which Claimant seeks €10,281,063. Mr.
Osbaldeston of Blackrock regards €9,236,544 of this as having been sufficiently
documented.'°?° The difference between the experts is thus approximately €1 million. A
portion of this assessed either as €176,500 (FTI) or €191,000 (Blackrock) relates to
insurance costs, and primarily involves a difference regarding the recoverable amount of
the construction coverage: is it recoverable to the end of the maintenance period (as FTI
contends) or to the end of the construction period (Blackrock).'°°?7 Mr. Osbaldeston
contends for the shorter period because “a contractor would recover the full cost during the
Time for Completion and nothing during the maintenance period.”!°?* The Tribunal does
not accept the logic of this argument; the full cost recovered by a contractor at the time of
completion would presumably reflect the cost of maintaining insurance cover during any

subsequent maintenance period.

A second and larger difference given as approximately €862,000 (FTI) or €592,000
(Blackrock) involves Strabag’s costs for maintaining guarantees. With respect to these,
Mr. Osbaldeston of Blackrock excludes Strabag’s administrative fees for maintaining the
guarantees incurred by BRVZ, “the treasury department of the Strabag Group.”!0?°
Mr. Osbaldeston finds that he is “unable to assess these fees,” but finds them
“exceptionally high.”'°° However, according to Mr. Knaack, these fees reflect both the

direct costs for the fees and charges of the bank issuing the guarantees as well as the

associated administrative costs incurred by BRVZ to administer the guarantees. '°' Viewed

in this broader light, the Tribunal does not find the BRVZ charges to be excessive.

The previous discussion does not address the full range of Blackrock’s numerous questions
and criticisms. A number of these involve relatively small amounts that may indeed be
questionable in the circumstances. Making allowance for these in the context of a good
deal of detailed and sometimes conflicting evidence, the Tribunal concludes that Claimant

has sufficiently established “force majeure” losses in the amount of €37,000,000.

However, the Tribunal has also determined that Claimant is not entitled to recover force
majeure losses under the Benghazi, Misurata and TIAR-NE Contracts (although it appears
that none are claimed under the TIAR-NE Contract). Al Hani is contractually entitled to
recover such costs for the TIAR and Garaboulli Contracts. It also has a right to recovery
under the Tajura Contract, but any recovery must be adjusted to restore the “financial

equilibrium” of the Contract.

Claimant’s “force majeure” claim was not specified contract-by-contract; claims under all
of the contracts were instead aggregated. There is no right to recovery under some
contracts, and only a qualified right to recover under the Tajura Contract. Accordingly, the
Tribunal must assess, within the limits of the available evidence, the recoveries under the
three contracts that authorize them. The result is an approximation, but this is the necessary

consequence of the manner in which Claimant presented its claim.

Claimant’s Memorial refers to the “Reclamation Letters” sent by Al Hani in December
2011 and subsequently updated that set out Al Hani’s claimed force majeure costs for each

individual contract. '°>

The amounts claimed in these letters are not presented in a manner
that precisely parallels the current claims. Nevertheless, these letters contain sufficient
information to allow the Tribunal to make a reasoned appraisal of the proportion that the

costs Claimant attributes to each contract bears to Claimant’s total claim.

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 287 of 337

The Tribunal has carried out a substantial analysis of amounts claimed in the Reclamation
Letters. On the basis of the information contained there, the Tribunal assesses that Al
Hani’s several contracts for which it claims force majeure claims contributed to the amount

of the total claim in the following proportions:

Benghazi - 45%

Misurata - 10.4%

TIAR - 8.7%

Garaboulli - 11.0%

Tajura - 65.4%
100%

While these proportions are approximate, they are the Tribunal’s best assessment, made

necessary by the manner in which Claimant elected to present its claims.

As discussed supra, the Tribunal has determined the total of Claimant’s “force majeure’
losses to be €37,000,000. As the Benghazi and Misurata Contracts do not authorize
compensation for “force majeure” losses, 14.9% of this amount, approximately €5.51

million, must remain on Claimant’s shoulders.

Claimant is entitled to recover with respect to 19.7% of the total, €7.29 million, for losses

related to the TIAR and Garaboulli Contracts.

The Tribunal assesses that 65.4% of force majeure losses, or €24.20 million, can be
attributed to the Tajura Contract. However, as decided supra, this amount must be adjusted
in order to restore the “balance of the contract.” Dr. Ahnish testified that the influential
practice of the French Conseil d’Etat “as a matter of practice in the majority of cases has
been to hold the state liable for 90% of the loss. In a few rare occasions, the French Conseil
d’Etat had held states liable for 80% and 95% of the loss.”!°> The Tribunal was not

directed to other relevant evidence on this issue. Taking account of terms of the Contract,

the practice of the Conseil d’Etat, and the circumstances of the claim, the Tribunal awards

€21.25 million in respect of the claim involving Tajura.

Accordingly, pursuant to Article 8(1) of the Treaty, the Tribunal awards €28.54 million in

respect of Claimant’s claim under Article 36 and related provisions of the several contracts.

ADVANCE PAYMENTS UNDER THE CONTRACTS "+

Respondent contends that any amounts found due under the several contracts should be set
off against large sums said to reflect the unrecovered balances of advance payments made
to Al Hani under those contracts. As described swpra, Al Hani’s employers made
substantial advance payments in connection with all of the contracts at issue. These funds
were to be recouped by the employers over time by reducing the amounts paid to Al Hani
as work progressed. This was accomplished by having Al Hani deduct an agreed
percentage from the total amount claimed under each payment certificate prior to

submitting it for payment.

It is undisputed that through this mechanism, Respondent completely recovered the
advance payments on the Benghazi and Misurata road contracts. (Although the Benghazi
advance payment was recovered, Respondent continued to recover some funds in excess
of the total required. '°>°) However, large amounts were not recovered in this manner. The
largest advance payment was for the large Tajura infrastructure contract, where the work
was not far advanced, in part due to the delays discussed supra. Respondent’s counsel
stated at the Hearing that the initial advance payment for Tajura was for €45 million and
LYD74 million;'°% in post-Hearing correspondence, Claimant states its exposure under

the Tajura advance payment guarantee to be €51,905,971.53.'°*7 In its Post-Hearing Brief,

Respondent puts the total of the “unearned” advance payments under the Tajura, TIAR,

TIAR-NE, and Garaboulli Contracts as €98,128,1 59,1038

877. Also, as described supra, the contracts required that guarantees be established and
maintained to provide security for the employers’ ability to recover the advance payments.

As described by Respondent:

The Contracts (except for TIAR-NE'%%) all included a provision
requiring the Advance Payment to be guaranteed with an
“unconditional” and “irrevocable” letter of credit, which HIB or
TPB had a right to call “without the need for a warning, a judicial
claim, or the undertaking of any other actions, and without
consideration of any objection from the Second Party or a third
party.” !04

878. Significant issues related to the guarantees were not clarified at the Hearing. On 29 October
2019, the Tribunal Secretary sent a message to the Parties on behalf of the Tribunal seeking

clarification regarding the guarantees. The letter stated that the Tribunal

noted that the guarantees established and maintained by the
Claimant as security for the advance payments received by Al Hani
would seem to be a factor of some significance in the relationship
between the Parties, but also noted a lack of clarity in the pleadings
and at the hearing regarding the situation of the guarantees.

The Tribunal would welcome any clarifications the Parties can
provide in relation to the matter of the guarantees in order to assist
the Tribunal in completing its mandate. The Tribunal would in
particular appreciate knowing whether there have been any relevant
developments related to the guarantees since the hearing.'™*!

RESPONDENT’S POSITION

Respondent contends that the unrecovered balances of the advance payments exceed any
amounts due to Al Hani under the contracts, and that these balances should be set-off

1042

against any amounts found due to Strabag under the contracts. Respondent’s Post-

Hearing Brief confirms that it seeks to have its unrecovered advance payments treated as a

set-off. '°43 Respondent does not make a counter-claim.!°44

Unjust Enrichment. Respondent contends that the amount Al Hani received as advance
payments substantially exceeds the percentage of work accomplished in Tajura and other
cases.'°*> Thus, large portions of the advance payments were “unearned,” and should be
set off against any recovery by Strabag.'"° Failing to do so unjustly enriches Claimant,
while allowing set-off would entitle Respondent to recover the “unearned” portion pursuant
to the contracts and applicable provisions of Libyan law and the Administrative Contracts
Regulations. '°47 Respondent further contends that, as Claimant alleges that the advance
payments were utilized to purchase equipment, compensating Al Hani for lost equipment

would constitute impermissible double recovery. !°*

Unauthorized Use. Respondent further maintains that a set-off is required because
Claimant failed to prove that it utilized the advance payments for the purposes for which
they were provided, and instead used them for other purposes.'? In this connection,
Respondent suggests that Strabag improperly transferred the Euro portion of the advance
payments to accounts in Europe for its own corporate purposes, rather than utilizing the

funds for the purposes for which they were provided. !°°°

Respondent also contends that a set-off was required both by several provisions of the

contracts and by provisions of Libyan law dealing with restitution.

Status of the Guarantees. In response to the Tribunal’s 29 October 2019 request for
clarification regarding the guarantees, Respondent replied by counsel’s letter of 15
November 2019 that “the guarantees relating to the Tajura Contract expired in 2012 and
2013.” Respondent’s letter adds that a three-year limit under Libyan law for HIB to claim
against the issuing bank for refusing to extend or pay the amounts under the guarantee has
expired, leaving HIB with only the option of a suit in Libyan courts against Al Hani for
restitution and breach of contract. The letter further states that any such action in Libyan
courts “would be limited to the extent the Tribunal has set off against the amount claimed
by Strabag (based on the contractual claims belonging to Al Hani) the unearned payment

currently still held by Strabag but belonging to Al Hani.”'°5!

As to the TIAR, TIAR-NE and Garaboulli projects, Respondent’s letter states:

[T]he advance payment guarantees were valid at the time of the
hearing and we understand them to be valid still today. As with the
Tajura advance payment guarantee, to the extent any advance
payment setoffs asserted by Respondent are accepted against the
claimed amounts sought by Strabag in this arbitration ... regarding
the TIAR, TIAR-NE and Garaboulli contracts, TPB would be
prevented by the terms of the advance payment guarantees from
calling on or cashing them. In other words, the advance payments
under the TIAR, TIAR-NE and Garaboulli contracts would be
deemed by the bank to have been repaid to the same extent of the
setoffs allowed by the Tribunal.!°

In a second letter responding to the Tribunal’s invitation to comment on Claimant’s letter
of 15 November 2019, Respondent reiterates its view that the Tajura guarantee has expired
and cannot now be called by HIB.'°*? The letter further disputes the evidence that Claimant
has paid bank charges to maintain this and other guarantees, contending that the evidence
of record consists only of accounting data and is “only secondary proof (at best)” that
Strabag has paid bank charges to maintain the guarantees between February 2011 and June
2017.!°54 Respondent concludes that, because Al Hani did not agree to renew the Tajura
guarantee at the time the parties were discussing possible resumption of the Tajura project,
“{t]here is no basis to claim amounts for maintaining guarantees that Claimant itself made

sure expired long ago.”!95

CLAIMANT’S POSITION

Claimant dismisses Respondent’s argument as “a confused mixture of set-off and unjust

enrichment arguments.” !°5° In Claimant’s view, there is no contractual basis for

claimed set-off in Libyan courts. '°°°

Claimant contends that there are no remaining “unearned” balances from the advance
payments, maintaining that all of these funds were utilized for work on Al Hani’s projects
and have been exhausted.!°° In this regard, Claimant refers to evidence said to show that,
because of Respondent’s slow or non-payment of substantial amounts due for payment and
bitumen certificates, its claims for additional work, and the failure of its State-owned joint
venture partner LIDCO to inject cash into the joint venture, Al Hani had to finance the
work itself, first by securing loans from Strabag, and then with a loan from Gumhouria
Bank. '°°' Claimant submits that it lost money on its Libyan contracts and was not unjustly

enriched. '°°

Claimant denies that it improperly diverted the Euro portion of the Tajura advance payment
to its own benefit. Claimant contends that Respondent’s argument in this regard reflects
misunderstanding of the accounting procedures and documents upon which the argument
is based, and that the advance payments made in Euros were transferred to Strabag accounts
in Europe with the employers’ knowledge to cover costs for equipment and other expenses

payable in Euros.'°%

890. Claimant expresses concern that the advance payment guarantees remain a potential
liability, pointing out that Mr. Al-Naas indicated at the Hearing that HIB apparently
envisioned calling the Tajura guarantee.'°* In counsel’s 15 November 2019 letter
responding to the Tribunal’s 29 October 2019 request for clarification, Claimant contends
that while the status of the Tajura fronting guarantee is “uncertain” due to an administrative
error by Gumhouria Bank, a related counter guarantee by Strabag remains in force between
Gumhouria Bank and ABC International Bank to secure the Libyan Bank from loss in case
ofa call,'°° while a third backing guarantee runs between Claimant and ABC International

Bank.'° With respect to the Tajura advance payment guarantee the Claimant states:

[T]he Respondent has previously relied on the fact that, as Mr.
Knaack originally explained, in 2012 HIB issued instructions to
Gumhouria Bank to extend the fronting guarantee, but (according to
the Claimant’s understanding based on correspondence from
Gumhouria Bank) HIB delivered those instructions to the wrong
branch. Because of this mistake, there is some uncertainty regarding
the status of the fronting guarantee (i.e., whether it has expired as a
matter of Libyan law). However, there is no such uncertainty
regarding the status of the backing guarantee, under which the
Claimant remains fully liable, with the result that ABC International
Bank retains the right to call on that backing guarantee (which it will
likely do if it faces a claim by Gumhouria Bank), and if ABC
International Bank does so, the Claimant will have the obligation to
pay the full amount of the guarantee.'°67

891. Claimant observes in this regard that it continues to pay bank charges to maintain the
guarantees, including the Tajura advance payment guarantee, and has claimed these as an
element of its claim for damages related to interruption of the contracts. The Tribunal

addresses these claims for bank charges supra.

if the Tribunal accepted the Respondent’s set-off argument and then

faced a call from ABC International Bank on the Tajura backing

guarantee that remains in place, along with calls on the Tajura and

TIAR performance guarantees from ABC International Bank and

Deutsche Bank (which it will be unable to contest). If that occurs

(which Mr. Al Naas indicated is highly likely), the Claimant would

effectively face a ‘double jeopardy’: it would be prejudiced in its

claim for damages in this arbitration, and it would be obliged to pay

over EUR 55 million, in circumstances where the Respondent has

deliberately avoiding calling on the guarantees until the close of

these arbitration proceedings. '°°*
In counsel’s second letter of 10 December 2019, Claimant contends that Respondent’s
claim in its 15 November 2019 letter that the Tajura guarantee has lapsed is not correct and
does not accurately reflect the evidence. Claimant points in this regard to Mr. Al-Naas’s
statement at the Hearing (discussed infra) that HIB “intends to call the guarantees,
depending on the outcome of this arbitration.” Claimant further disputes Respondent’s
contention that a limitations period has extinguished HIB’s rights to claim restitution
against the bank,'°°? contending that Respondent’s position in this regard is inconsistent.
In Claimant’s view, if HIB’s claim against the bank is time-barred under Libyan law, so is
Respondent’s claim for restitution of the advance payments.'°” Claimant further denies
that any set-off would reduce the amount that could be claimed under the guarantees,
pointing out that these are irrevocable on-demand instruments, so that any call would result

in payment of the full guarantee amount.!°7!

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS AND DECISION

The Tribunal notes that the Parties’ recent exchange of correspondence leaves some
matters of fact unclear. /nter alia, there is a lack of clarity regarding the advance payment
guarantees for the TIAR, TIAR-NE and Garaboulli Contracts. Respondent appears to
regard the unrecovered advance payments under these three contracts as relevant in
determining the amount of its claimed set-off. For its part, however, Claimant does not
identify them as posing potential liabilities, apparently because these guarantees were
provided by Al Hani, not by Strabag. In its 10 December 2019 letter, Claimant states in

this regard:

With regard to the Respondent’s reference to the TIAR, TIAR-NE

and Garaboulli guarantees, which the Respondent acknowledges are

still valid, these include guarantees provided by Al Hani along with

the TIAR performance guarantee provided by Strabag (which the

Claimant discussed in its 15 November 2019 letter).!°”
Jurisdiction and Admissibility. Respondent does not specifically address the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction to consider its set-off claim, instead contending that a set-off is required to
avoid unjust enrichment and that cited provisions of the contracts and of the Libyan Civil
Code authorized recovery of the unrecovered advance payments. !°7 For its part, Claimant
disputes the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to consider the claim and finds no legal basis for it on

the merits.

In assessing its jurisdiction to consider the set-off claim, the Tribunal notes that Article 13
of the Treaty, which deals with indemnification, indicates that a Contracting Party can seek

to set-off claims against it:

A Contracting Party shall not assert as a defence, counter-claim,
right of set-off or for any other reason, that indemnification or other
compensation for all or part of the alleged damages has been
received ....

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 297 of 337

While this provision does not expressly authorize a set-off in the present context, it
indicates that the treatymakers saw set-offs as within a tribunal’s jurisdiction. The Tribunal
also recalls that ICSID’s Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules apply in this case. Article
47 of those Rules authorizes either party to present “an incidental or additional claim or
counter-claim.” Respondent’s claimed set-off can reasonably be viewed as an “incidental
or additional claim” for purposes of Article 47. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that it has
jurisdiction to address Respondent’s set-off claim to the extent of its authority to extend

relief under Article 15 of the Treaty.

There is a related matter regarding the admissibility of Respondent’s set-off claim under
the Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules. Under Article 47 of those rules, an incidental
claim must be presented no later than in the Reply. In this case, Respondent’s claim of set-
off was sufficiently articulated in the Counter-Memorial to satisfy the requirement of

Article 47.'0%

Unjust Enrichment. Respondent contends that not allowing its requested set-off would
result in unjust enrichment of Claimant, '°”> but it did not clearly address the status or nature
of unjust enrichment under some potentially relevant system of law under the Treaty.
Forms of the doctrine do exist in different systems of national law, but with varying
elements and requirements. '°’° All appear to require, however, that the party against whom

a claim for unjust enrichment is brought receive some incontrovertible benefit as a result.

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 298 of 337

The Tribunal is not persuaded that this is the case here. The testimony of Mr. Knaack and
other witnesses establishes to the Tribunal’s satisfaction that the advance payments, as well
as substantial additional funds derived from loans from Strabag and from Al Hani’s Libyan
bankers, were utilized by Al Hani to carry forward the several construction projects in the
face of delayed or non-payment of Al Hani’s payment certificates and claims for additional
work. And, at the end of the day, Claimant maintains that it lost money on its activities in

Libya. '°7’ “Unjust Enrichment” does not properly describe the situation here.

Claimed Misuse of the Advance Payments. Claimant denies that Al Hani and Strabag
improperly diverted advance payments received, either to fund work on other contracts or
for Strabag’s purposes unrelated to Libya. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that the
contracts do not specify or limit the purposes for which the advance payments are provided.
They thus do not support Respondent’s contention that Claimant utilized the advance
payments improperly by using advance payments received in connection with one project
to support work on others. This is particularly the case as Al Hani was working on several
contracts at the same time, while experiencing difficulties in obtaining timely payment on

many, if not all, of them.

The Tribunal is also not persuaded by Respondent’s contention that Strabag improperly
transferred funds from Al Hani to accounts in Europe for Strabag’s own purposes unrelated
to construction activities in Libya. The Tribunal finds the evidence sufficient to show that
payments received in Euros were properly transferred to Strabag’s accounts with the
knowledge of Al Hani’s employers and for appropriate purposes, such as purchase of

equipment and payment of expatriate salaries.

Status of the Guarantees. The several contracts at issue do not by their terms provide for
set-offs and instead create a mechanism of guarantees to secure the advance payments. As
Respondent points out, supra, these take the form of unconditional and irrevocable letters
of credit in favor of the employer established in a Libyan bank. The contracts allow for the

amount of the letter of credit to be reduced over time as the employer progressively

recovers the advance payment through reductions in the amounts paid on Al Hani’s

1078

payment certificates, although it is not clear to the Tribunal whether this in fact

occurred.

The Parties disagree whether this mechanism has continuing relevance for the large
advance payment for the Tajura Contract. In both of its recent letters, Respondent denies
the continued existence of any guarantee of the Tajura advance payment, contending that

the Tajura advance payment guarantee ceased to exist in 201].

The Tribunal is not persuaded of Respondent’s recent position. The testimony at the
Hearing and the evidence on record show that significant elements in the chain of
guarantees securing the Tajura advance payment remain in effect, as does the entire TIAR

guarantee and the separate performance guarantees for both of these Contracts.

Respondent’s present position seems inconsistent with the position of Respondent’s
officials at the Hearing, when Mr. Al-Naas, HIB’s senior official responsible for letters of

credit, told the Tribunal that HIB was contemplating a possible call on the Tajura

guarantee:
Q. Do you know whether HIB, depending on the outcome of
this arbitration, intends to call the Guarantees?
A. Yes.

[Interpreter asks that question be repeated for technical reasons.]

Q. Are you saying that HIB intends to call the Guarantees
depending on the outcome of this arbitration?

A. HIB seeks to get its rights. It has obligations, but it also has
rights, and it is entitled to asking for the enjoyment of its
rights. !°79

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 300 of 337

Respondent’s present position also conflicts with a substantial body of evidence, accepted
by Blackrock’s quantification expert Mr. Osbaldeston, showing that Strabag has for many
years paid bank charges to maintain the Tajura and TIAR advance payment and
performance guarantees. In the context of Claimant’s “Article 36” claim for losses from
disruption due to the Revolution, Respondent and Blackrock did not dispute that Strabag
made payments to maintain these guarantees, although, as discussed supra, the Parties’
respective experts differed regarding the total amount paid. Blackrock’s presentation to the
Tribunal at the Hearing ultimately assessed Claimant’s cost of maintaining guarantees at
€2,951,026.'°8° Claimant presumably did not pay these significant amounts in respect of

allegedly “non-existent” guarantees.

Respondent’s recent correspondence questioned this evidence, and indeed suggested that
Claimant acted improperly by submitting evidence of recent transactions to maintain the
Tajura performance guarantee.'°*' This guarantee is different from the advance payment
guarantee, and Respondent has not previously contested its continued existence. The

Tribunal does not accept Respondent’s recent contentions regarding it.

The Tribunal accordingly concludes that the guarantees, including at least the Tajura
backing guarantee and Strabag’s related obligations to ABC Bank, remain in effect and

must be taken into account in assessing the claimed set-off.

Contract Provisions Dealing with Termination. Respondent contends that Al Hani’s
contracts must now all be deemed to be terminated, so these provisions addressing contract
termination must be applied and require a “wrapping up” giving effect to the claimed set-
off. Respondent observes in this regard that the several contracts and Libya’s Contracting
Regulations all contain provisions requiring a final settlement of accounts between the
contracting parties at the time of a contract’s conclusion or premature termination.

Respondent’s Post-Hearing Brief identifies several such standard contract provisions

including Article 54 (the procedure for provisional receipt), Article 56 (final receipt), and

the corresponding provision of the Administrative Contract Regulations (Article 125). !8

911. Apparently to show that these provisions now should be applied, Respondent’s Post-
Hearing Brief contends that “the contracts should be deemed terminated ipso facto as of
February 2011.”!'°8? However, as discussed supra in connection with Claimant’s “Article
36” claims, the Tribunal does not agree that the contracts have been terminated. This
contention is inconsistent with the views of both Libyan officials and of Respondent’s

counsel at the Hearing.

912. Thus, in response to the presiding arbitrator’s question at the Hearing, Mr. Turki was clear

that the Tajura Contract has not been terminated:

Q. ... Why has the Contract not been terminated?

A. As [ have told you, there is still goodwill on our part for the
Contract to be reinstated, and all rights. As of 2011, we have
been asking the Contractor, and we collaborate with him in
order to pursue the implementation of the Project, the
purpose of which is to serve the people of this area who have
suffered a lot. Until this day, they still carry water to have
water. There is still areas that are covered--flooded with
water. We had hoped that this company would help us in
completing the Project, but the contrary is what happened.
That is why we did not take any measure to terminate the
Contract. '8

913. Referring to this testimony, Respondent’s counsel at the Hearing confirmed that the Tajura
Contract has not been terminated: “the [Tajura] Contract has not been terminated, and [Mr.
Turki] testified to that in answer to I think that’s general knowledge, and I think his

testimony confirmed that as well ... It has not been terminated. Not been terminated.” !8>

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 302 of 337

Thus, testimony at the Hearing, confirmed by Respondent’s counsel, is that the Tajura
Contract has not been terminated. The Tribunal has received no evidence that any of the
other contracts have been terminated, so that the cited provisions of the contracts and the
Administrative Contracts Regulations dealing with situations of contract termination do

not literally apply here. These contracts remain in existence.

However, even if the contract provisions cited in Respondent’s Post-Hearing Brief are
taken as a reference or guide, they do no greatly assist the Tribunal. The contracts and the
Administrative Contracts Regulations do indeed establish procedures for an orderly
settlement of accounts between contracting parties at contract termination or completion
of performance. The difficulty here, however, is that the circumstances of this arbitration
do not allow this sort of orderly and comprehensive resolution of the contracting parties’
respective positions. Performance of the contracts has been interrupted by the Revolution
and the ensuing disorder in Libya, so that the Parties are addressing Claimant’s claims in
this vigorously contested arbitration, not through a negotiated wrapping-up. Under the
Treaty, the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to compel any such comprehensive

wrapping-up of accounts that would include authoritative release of the guarantees.

This Tribunal’s jurisdiction under Article 15 of the Treaty is limited to declaring that a
Party has acted contrary to the BIT, to making a recommendation, or awarding pecuniary
compensation. Absent the agreement of the Parties under Article 15(1)(d) of the BIT

which has not been given here — it cannot effect any sort of global settlement of accounts
that would address the panoply of Claimant’s claims, Respondent’s claimed set-off, and

release of the guarantees to the extent of any set-off allowed.

Restitution under Libya’s Civil Code. The same difficulty arises with respect to
Respondent’s contention that its claimed set-off is justified by the provisions of Libyan law
dealing with restitution.'°°° This invocation of Libyan law seems at variance with

Respondent’s recent suggestion that Libyan law also imposes a three-year limitation period

1087

on restitution claims, which would seem to preclude its present claim invoking that

same law. Putting this difficulty aside, if Respondent’s restitution claim could be addressed

in Libya’s courts, !°8%

it would be before a judge with broader powers to address the overall
situation, including compelling Respondent to release the guarantees to the extent of any

set-off the court might allow. This Tribunal has no such authority.

The Unbalanced Situation Created by the Guarantees. As the foregoing suggests, the
Tribunal is concerned by the continued existence of the unconditional and irrevocable
guarantees created to secure the advance payments and other aspects of Al Hani’s
performance. If Respondent’s claimed set-off were to be applied, those guarantees would
remain. Claimant would be left exposed to the risk of what would in essence be double

recovery by the Respondent.

The Tribunal does not wish to impugn the good faith of any Party. Nevertheless, as a matter
of good order and fundamental fairness, it could not apply the requested set-off without
firm arrangements in place to assure that Claimant’s exposure under the guarantees would
at the same time be reduced or ended to the extent of any set-off. The Tribunal does not
take comfort in this regard from Respondent’s recent statement that Gumhouria Bank, or
any other bank involved in the chain of guarantees, would reduce the amount paid in the
event of a demand on a guarantee purely on the basis that this Tribunal allowed some or
all of Respondent’s claimed set-off. A bank that extends an “unconditional” and
“irrevocable” letter of guarantee has no duty, and perhaps no right, to pay some lesser

amount on the basis of an arbitration ruling to which it is not party.

The Tribunal has no authority to address this difficulty without the agreement of the Parties.
Article 15 of the Treaty limits the forms of relief the Tribunal may include in an award.
Under Article 15(1)(d), any attempt by the Tribunal to devise some remedy relevant to the
set-off and the continued existence of the guarantees would require the Parties’ consent.

They have not given such consent. Even if they were to do so, there might be no assurance

that any bank issuing a letter of guarantee would or could give effect to a Tribunal

award.

For the forgoing reasons, the Tribunal decides, by majority, that Respondent’s requested
set-off is denied. In the view of the majority, this is a matter that must be addressed by the

Parties, if it is to be addressed, outside the context of this arbitration.

COSTS

Each Party seeks an award of costs in its favor.

In this regard, Article 15(b) of the Treaty provides that arbitration awards may provide for
“pecuniary compensation, which shall include interest from the time the loss or damage

was incurred until time of payment.”

The Tribunal is further guided in this regard by the first sentence of Article 58(1) of the

Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules:

Unless the Parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal shall decide how
and by whom the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal,
the expenses and charges of the Secretariat and the expenses
incurred by the parties in connection with the proceeding shall be
borne.

CLAIMANT’S COSTS SUBMISSION

Claimant contends that in considering the allocation of costs, the Tribunal has broad
discretion under Article 58 of the Rules. In this regard, it cites what it sees as growing
application in investment arbitration of “the principle that the losing party pays, but not
necessarily all of the costs of the arbitration or of the prevailing party.”!°8? However, in

Claimant’s view, other factors may also be considered. Tribunals may take into account

misconduct by a party during the proceedings and whether a party responsible for a

particular part of the proceeding should bear the resulting costs.'°%°

Claimant identifies four aspects of this arbitration that it contends the Tribunal should
weigh in assessing costs. First, Claimant maintains that Respondent refused to engage in
consultations as required by Article 11(1) of the Treaty, did not respond to written requests
for consultations prior to initiation of the arbitration, and otherwise engaged in conduct

said to be inimical to settlement of the case. °°!

Second, Claimant contends that Respondent sought unsuccessfully to bifurcate the
proceeding and insisted on making groundless jurisdictional objections, resulting in
unnecessary costs. Claimant further asserts that Respondent “adopted a tactic of delaying
the arbitration and unnecessarily complicating and confusing the issues before the

Tribunal,” citing events in the course of the proceedings said to support this view.!°%

Third, Claimant contends that Respondent engaged in procedural tactics and delays that
disrupted the proceedings and resulted in unnecessary costs, citing multiple events during

the course of the proceedings said to support this contention. !°%

Finally, Claimant alleges that Respondent adopted a defensive strategy of misleadingly
obfuscating factual issues and introducing unnecessary complexity, thereby significantly
complicating the arbitration and resulting in unnecessary costs. /nter alia, Claimant
contends that Respondent made allegations that were unsubstantiated, based on selective
and misleading use of documents, or contradicted by the evidence, including new evidence
disclosed after the Hearing at the Tribunal’s request. Claimant further contends that
Respondent refused a meeting between the Parties’ financial experts that would have

simplified the quantum evidence. !0%

Given these factors, Claimant submits that, should the Tribunal find in Claimant’s favor, it
should be awarded all of its costs. However, if the Tribunal “does not accept the Claimant’s
submissions in whole or substantial part ... the Tribunal should nevertheless order the
Respondent to reimburse a significant part of the costs that the Claimant only incurred as
aresult of Respondent’s defence strategy.”'°% Finally, Claimant requests that the Tribunal
award compound interest on costs awarded to it, calculated in accordance with Section VI

of its Memorial. '%

Claimant’s Reply to Respondent’s Submission on Costs responds to what it deems “a series
of misleading and inaccurate statements” in that document. The Reply criticizes harsh
language contained in Respondent’s Submission. It denies that Claimant acted
inappropriately in relation to three matters cited by Respondent, i.e., Claimant’s successful
opposition to Respondent’s request for bifurcation, its actions in relation to possible
interference with a witness, and its complaints regarding Respondent’s document

production. '°°7

Claimant states its costs to be:
a. Contribution to ICSID and the Tribunal’s costs and expenses: US$800,000;'°%%
b. Legal costs, comprising:

i. Claimant’s law firm’s costs and expenses: €7,884,465.27

arbitration, which will be addressed infra.

RESPONDENT’S COSTS SUBMISSION

Respondent contends that it should be awarded costs in accordance with the “costs follow
the event” principle, in accordance with the practice of a growing number of investment
tribunals. Respondent alleges that its costs were substantially increased by what it deems
“Claimant’s procedural misconduct in this Arbitration,”!°%° and that “there is a long and

constant practice of tribunals using their discretion to sanction procedural misconduct.” |!

Respondent alleges that Claimant’s misconduct lay in making misleading statements
opposing bifurcation; an improper attempt to obtain provisional measures; and “scurrilous
accusations of improper conduct,” the latter apparently referring to correspondence

involving possible interference with a witness.'!°!

Respondent further requests an award of costs “as a result of Claimant’s false accusations
in regard to Respondent’s document production,” emphasizing the difficulties of collecting

documents in Libya “given the state of affairs affecting Libya.?|'?

Respondent contends further that Claimant’s refusal to accept bifurcation of the case was
inappropriate and caused unnecessary expense.'!°? Finally, Respondent requested the
Tribunal to use its discretionary power to order Claimant to pay interest on any amount
awarded in respect of legal and arbitration costs “at a reasonable commercial rate running

from the date of the Award until payment.”!!

In response to Claimant’s Submission on Costs, Respondent maintains that Claimant’s
allegations of its procedural misconduct are “frivolous” and should be disregarded. !'°° In
Respondent’s submission, these allegations are made to “explain away [Claimant’s]
exorbitant and unreasonable costs.”''°° Respondent’s submission discusses details of an
unsuccessful settlement meeting, and renews allegations of improper conduct by Claimant
in relation to an incident of possible interference with one of its witnesses. Respondent
characterizes Claimant’s costs as exorbitant, and its allegations as “false in all material

respects” and as involving “outrageous and baseless accusations.”'!°7

Respondent states its costs and expenses incurred in the arbitration to total

US$5,950,334.75, comprised as follows:

TOTAL: US$5,950,334.75

Hence Respondent incurred US$5,625,334.75 in legal fees and expenses. The amount paid

by Respondent to cover the costs of the arbitration is addressed below.

COSTS OF THE ARBITRATION

The costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, ICSID’s

administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in US$):

Arbitrators’ fees and expenses

Prof. Crook (President) 399,247.86
Prof. Crivellaro 311,043.58
Prof. Ziadé 324,776.46
ICSID’s administrative fees 190,000.00
Direct costs 140,360.14
Total 1,365,428.04

The above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties. As reflected in
ICSID’s financial statement, Claimant has made advance payments in the amount of
US$974,632.00 to cover the cost of the arbitration. (The payment of the US$25,000 lodging
fee is excluded in this amount as it is not part of the advance payments made to cover the

costs of the arbitration.) The amount advanced by Respondent to cover the cost of the

payment made by Respondent following its costs submission. The advances paid by each party are reflected in ICSID’s
financial statement which will be sent to the Parties separately.

arbitration is US$524,477.91. The difference between the Parties regarding the amounts of
advance payments made is largely due to the fact that while each Party was invited to pay

half of the requested advances, Claimant on two occasions paid Respondent’s share.

THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION ON COSTS

The Parties agree that under Article 58 of the ICSID (Additional Facility) Arbitration
Rules, the Tribunal has discretion in allocating costs and expenses to take into account the
outcome of the arbitration. Each Party urges the Tribunal to do so in its favor on this basis.
This approach is indeed being applied with increasing frequency in international

investment arbitration. The Tribunal has followed it in this case, as urged by both Parties.

This arbitration has been vigorously conducted. Both Parties have been represented by able
and energetic counsel. As is natural in a complex and vigorously contested arbitration
involving multiple issues, particularly one conducted under unusual and difficult
circumstances, there have been some strongly held differences of view and some
misunderstandings. However, notwithstanding contrary suggestions in both Parties’ costs
submissions, the Tribunal does not accept that there has been conduct of a nature that

should significantly affect the allocation of costs.

At the end of the day, Claimant has been largely successful. The Tribunal has not accepted
Respondent’s multiple objections to jurisdiction, or its claimed set-off for the contract
claims. However, Claimant has not prevailed in all respects. The Tribunal has accepted
only a portion of its claims for losses relating to actions by Respondent’s military forces
under Article 5 of the Treaty. Its claim for the disappearance of a large quantity of property
from the Tweisha yard in 2014 failed for lack of proof. While Claimant’s claims under the
road and Tajura Contracts have largely been upheld, portions of its “Article 36” claims and
claims for delay and additional work on the Tajura project have not been accepted. Thus,

Claimant’s success is less than total.

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 311 of 337

Given the overall outcome of the case, the Tribunal decides that Respondent shall bear its
costs for legal costs and expenses. In addition, Respondent shall pay to Claimant 75% of
Claimant’s legal costs and expenses in this case. As noted above, Claimant’s legal costs
and expenses amount to €9,469,017.35 and £1,491,628.36. (This amount excludes the
advances paid to ICSID to cover the cost of the arbitration, an issue that is addressed in the
following paragraph). Applying the Tribunal’s decision, Respondent is to pay Claimant
€7,101,763.01 and £1,118,721.20 for Claimant’s legal costs and expenses.

With regard to the costs of the arbitration, the Tribunal recalls its decision on Day 2 of the
Hearing (10 July 2018) that Respondent is to pay the costs associated with Mr. Bisher’s
testimony by video-conference, including costs associated with ICSID staff traveling to

Tunis. As indicated on ICSID’s financial statement, this amounts to US$6,435.75.

Regarding the cost of the arbitration, the Tribunal notes that the total arbitration costs,
excluding the costs associated with Mr. Bisher’s video-conference testimony (i.e. US$
6,435.75), amount to US$1,358,992.29. The Tribunal decides that Respondent is to bear
75% of these arbitration costs, i.e. US$1,019,244.22. Claimant shall bear 25% of these
arbitration costs, i.e. US$339,748.07.

Based on ICSID’s financial statement, of the total disbursements excluding costs related to
Mr. Bisher’s testimony, US$837,281.87 was paid from Claimant’s advance payments.
Applying the Tribunal’s cost ruling, i.e. that Claimant pay US$339,748.07 of the arbitration
costs, Respondent is to pay to Claimant US$497,533.80. Any funds remaining in the trust
fund account will be refunded by ICSID.''°?

1109 The amount Respondent is to pay to Claimant can also be calculated as follows: using US$1,019,244.22 (i.e.,
Respondent’s 75% share of the arbitration costs excluding the costs associated with Mr. Bisher’s testimony), then
adding US$6,435.75 (i.e., the costs associated with Mr. Bisher’s testimony) and then subtracting US$528,146.17 (i-e.,
the advances paid by Respondent plus its share of the investment income as indicated in ICSID’s Financial Statement).

XI. INTEREST

A. CLAIMANT’S POSITION

949. On the question of interest, Claimant requests:

interest on the amounts that the Tribunal orders the Respondent to
pay to the Claimant calculated from the date on which the respective
amounts became due and at the rates specified in Section VI of the
Memorial, until the Claimant receives full payment of the amount
ordered by the Tribunal.'!'°

950. Claimant’s Post-Hearing Brief adds that interest should be calculated in accordance with

Article 15(b) of the Treaty and at a commercial rate as set out in Claimant’s Memorial.!''!
In the Memorial, Claimant asks the Tribunal to award compound interest at a commercial
rate, citing in this regard Article 4(2)(d) of the Treaty (providing for interest “at a
commercial rate established on a market basis” in determining compensation for

112 13

expropriation), as well as the writings of commentators and recent arbitration
decisions.'''* In Claimant’s view, these cases and commentators establish compound

interest as reflecting contemporary commercial practice.

951. In response to Respondent’s contentions, Claimant’s legal expert Dr. Ahnish denied that
Libyan law barred payment of interest under Al Hani’s contracts as usury (riba) and that
Libya’s Law No | of 2013 annulled Article 92 of Libya’s Administrative Contracts
Regulations authorizing compensation for late payment.'''> In his view, “the payment of
interest on payments overdue under the contracts concluded between a Libyan authority

and another judicial person before 01/01.2015 would not be affected” by the 2013 law.!!'¢

Claimant cites a calculation of its interest claim made by its experts FTI on the basis of the

five-year average on 3-month EURIBOR rates compounded on a 6-monthly basis.
RESPONDENT’S POSITION

Respondent contends that Claimant is not entitled to recover interest under the contracts!!'®

because they are subject to Libya’s law prohibiting assessment of interest.'''? Respondent
cites in this regard Libya’s 2013 Law on Banning Usury in Civil and Commercial
Transactions, '!2° which Respondent contends has retroactive effect. Thus, “Al-Hani is not

entitled to recover interest as it is prohibited as Riba under Libyan law.”!'?!

Respondent’s legal expert, Dr. Abuda, supported these contentions, maintaining that
Articles | and 2 of the 2013 law prohibit the recovery of interest and have retroactive

effect.''??

In its Counter-Memorial, Respondent acknowledged that Libya’s Administrative Contract
Regulations allow compensation for late payments, although the interest rate cannot exceed
a rate approved by the Central Bank of Libya.''?> However, in its Post-Hearing Brief,

Respondent maintains that this Regulation “was derogated by the law on Riba.”!!74

As to Claimant’s request for compound interest, Respondent refers to Article 235 of the
Libyan Civil Code which is said to prohibit compound interest and recoveries of interest
exceeding the amount of a debt.''?> Respondent also points to the ILC’s Commentary on

its Articles on State Responsibility, which concludes that “the general view of courts and

tribunals has been against the award of compound interest, ... even of those tribunals which
hold claimants to be normally entitled to compensatory interest.”!'® Respondent cites

additional commentators and arbitral authority to the same effect.!'?7

Respondent concludes that if the Tribunal awards interest with respect to amounts due
under the contracts, it should likewise award interest with respect to the unrecovered
balances of the advance payments “calculated as simple interest at an annual rate of 3% or
5%, whichever rate the Tribunal determines is appropriate ... if any interest is to be awarded

to Claimant.”!!

THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION ON INTEREST

The Tribunal begins by recalling the central position of the Treaty as the foundation of its
jurisdiction. Article 15 of the Treaty expressly sanctions payment of interest as part of an
Award. Under Article 15(1) of the Treaty, arbitration awards “may include an award of
interest.” Further, under Article 15(1)(b), in cases where pecuniary compensation is
awarded, it “shall include interest from the time the loss or damage was incurred until time
of payment” (emphasis added). The Tribunal finds further instruction in Article 4(2)(d),
which requires that compensation in cases of expropriation shall “include interest at a

commercial rate established on a market basis ...”

The Treaty thus defines the Tribunal’s role in relation to interest. It is to apply the
international law of the Treaty, and not Libya’s domestic law. The Parties and their legal
experts debated the position of interest under Libya’s domestic law at some length.
However, that domestic law whatever its content, which was vigorously disputed does

not alter the international legal obligation that Libya and Austria established in their Treaty.

The Treaty reflects well-established international practice in this regard.'!?°

Thus, it is the Treaty, and not Al Hani’s contractual arrangements, that determines the
amount of any interest to be reflected in the Tribunal’s award. The Tribunal notes in this
regard that Claimant has in these proceedings referred to amounts said to be due as default
interest on late payments of payment certificates and other amounts claimed by Al Hani,
on the basis of contract provisions authorizing interest on late payments by the
employers.''? While those contract provisions may provide relevant indicators, they do
not prescribe or limit the interest to be awarded by the Tribunal. As set out infra, the

Tribunal includes interest as a component of the relief awarded pursuant to the Treaty.

A further question is whether interest should be simple or compound. It is true that
compound interest is a feature of contemporary commercial and economic life, and that
many tribunals have seen it to be warranted in order to provide full compensation for losses.
Other tribunals, however, have not followed this approach. Hence, there cannot be said to
be a uniform international practice in this regard. The Tribunal is also mindful of the ILC’s
Commentary to Article 38 of the State Responsibility Articles (reflecting the critical
perspective of the distinguished rapporteur, Judge Crawford). The Commentary takes the
view that compound interest should be awarded only where there are “special
circumstances which justify some element of compounding as an aspect of full

reparation.”!'3!

determining amount of interest.).

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 316 of 337

The Tribunal finds that in the unusual circumstances of this case, where it has found that
Respondent has been subject to a protracted period of force majeure from early 2011 to the
present day, simple and not compound interest provides a more appropriate measure of
compensation. Accordingly, the Tribunal decides to award simple interest at the EURIBOR
annual rate plus 4% on the sums awarded with respect to Claimant’s claims under the
Treaty and on the sums awarded to Claimant in respect of its legal costs and expenses and
the costs of arbitration. Should EURIBOR cease to be available at some date prior to
payment of the Award, any interest accruing subsequent to that date shall be determined at

the rate of the Euro Short Term Rate for the relevant period plus 4%.

A further complication involves the date at which interest should begin to run. This case
involves multiple claims that gave rise to liability at different times over a span of years.
Given this situation, the Tribunal determines that interest shall commence to accrue on 1
January 2012 with respect to amounts awarded pursuant to Claimant’s claims la., |.b., I.d.
and claims 6.1-6.4. Interest shall begin to accrue on | March 2011 on amounts awarded in
respect of all of Claimant’s other claims under the Treaty, namely on claims 3, 4 and 5.
Interest on the sums awarded to Claimant in respect of its legal costs and expenses and the
costs of arbitration pursuant to paragraph 948 shall begin to accrue 60 days after the date

of dispatch of this Award.

CLAIMANT’S REQUESTS FOR COMPENSATION: ADDITIONAL CLAIMS

As this Award shows, Claimant’s case involves a web of separate claims for multiple items
of damage, each valued individually. In its Memorial, Claimant seeks 60% of the amount
of specified damage for six listed heads of claim, based on its 60% ownership of Al Hani.
As noted supra, these were (1) equipment requisitioned by Respondent’s forces; (2)
equipment destroyed by those forces; (3) equipment damaged by those forces; (4) damage
they caused to site facilities; (5) property removed from the Tweisha yard; (6) amounts
under payment certificates and for additional work related to the contracts; (7) retention
amounts; and (8) amounts claimed “under Article 36 and associated provisions of the

1132

Contracts, a claim with multiple components.

The Tribunal has been guided by this outline of Claimant’s claims in preparing this Award.
However, Claimant’s Memorial also adds two alternative and additional claims. The

Tribunal must now consider these.

First, Claimant contends that compensation for its losses should be “no less than the losses
that the Claimant incurred in making its investment in Libya.”''? Claimant defines these
to be: (1) the amount of Strabag’s paid-up capital in Al Hani (LYD12 million) with interest
from the date of the investment, plus (2) Al Hani’s total debt to Strabag International for
funds it loaned to Al Hani, said to amount to €35 million as of 28 February 2014, with

interest from that date.''3+

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 318 of 337

This claim was presented as a contingent or alternative request for a minimum amount of
compensation. As set out in this Award, the Tribunal awards sums larger than this
minimum amount in relation to Claimant’s six principal heads of claim. Accordingly, the
Tribunal need not further address this alternative claim. (The Tribunal notes that there was
a lack of clarity in the proceedings regarding the status or relevance of the €35 million loan
from Strabag International to Al Hani. The loan reflected a transaction between two closely
linked companies in the Strabag group of companies. Had A] Hani been paid for its unpaid
payment certificates and for its additional work, it should have been able to repay that loan.
Al Hani’s claims for these amounts are largely upheld in this Award. Adding €35 million
for the loan to the amount of compensation awarded here would therefore threaten a

significant double recovery.)

To the extent that Claimant maintains any claim with respect to recovery of the €35 million

loan from Strabag International to Al Hani, that claim is denied.

In addition to the heads of damage specifically listed above, Claimant’s Memorial makes
another large claim under Article 3(1) of the Treaty, involving an alleged denial of fair
treatment. Claimant bases this claim on a 5 May 2013 notification from Libya’s Prime
Minister to Libya’s Central Bank, which Claimant understood to relieve it of the obligation
to continue extending letters of guarantee and to pay various charges to maintain bonds
and guarantees.''?5 Claimant accordingly seeks approximately €7.165 million for

Respondent’s alleged failure

to exempt Al Hani and Strabag from the expenses of extending
letters of guarantee, and by the Authorities’ failure to take steps to
release the Claimant from its on-going obligations to pay financial
charges for the performance bonds for the Tajura and TIAR
Contracts and the advance payment guarantee for the Tajura
Contract. ''6

Respondent disputes this claim, referring, inter alia, to the testimony of Mr. Al-Naas, who
attended meetings on the subject at the Central Bank and believes that no decision was
taken to implement the notification. Respondent contends further that the communication
from the Prime Minister’s office had a more limited scope than asserted by Claimant.!!37
In recent correspondence regarding the advance payments, Respondent insists that the
Prime Minister’s announcement was “never enacted into law or regulation” and would

have in any event been applicable only to Libyan entities issuing guarantees.''**

This issue, involving a claim for many millions of Euros, received only peripheral
treatment by the Parties. Given the limited and disputed evidence, the Tribunal cannot find

that there was a breach of Article 3 or any other provision of the Treaty with respect to it.

This claim is subject to yet another infirmity. The amounts claimed appear to have also
been claimed, in whole or significant part, as part of Claimant’s “Article 36” claims. As
considered supra, Claimant’s claims for maintaining guarantees and related financial
expenses have been allowed by the Tribunal insofar as they are authorized by the terms of

the governing contracts.

This claim for additional compensation involving the 5 May 2013 communication from the

Prime Minister’s office, is denied.

THE PARTIES’ REQUESTS FOR RELIEF

In its Reply, Claimant requests the following relief:

For the reasons set out in the Claimant’s Memorial and this Reply,
the Claimant requests that the Tribunal render an award:

a. Declaring that the Respondent has violated Articles 3(1), 3(2),

Treaty in the amount of EUR1 12,087,995, as set out above in
Section V, above, or such other amount as the Tribunal may
determine to be payable;

c. Ordering that the Respondent pay interest on the amounts that
the Tribunal orders the Respondent to pay to the Claimant
calculated from the date on which the respective amounts
became due and at the rates specified in Section VI of the
Memorial, until the Claimant receives full payment of the
amount ordered by the Tribunal ...''5°

976. For its part, Respondent asks in its Rejoinder that:

For the reasons set forth in the Counter-Memorial, this Rejoinder,
and all of the accompanying witness statements, legal expert
opinions and expert reports submitted therewith, Claimant’s claims
should be dismissed in their entirety for lack of jurisdiction, or, in
the alternative, the claims should be dismissed in their entirety on
the merits.''4°

XIV. CONCLUSION ON CLAIMANT’S CLAIMS

977. As specified above, the Tribunal finds that breaches of Respondent’s obligations under the

Treaty have caused loss or damage to Al Hani in the amount of €124,895,006.00.

at

978. As specified above, Claimant’s 60% ownership interest in Al Hani, entitles Claimant

to be compensated for 60% of the amount of loss or damage incurred by Al Hani.''4?

Respondent shall pay, €74,937,003.60, constituted as follows:

XV. THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISIONS AND AWARD

980. For the reasons stated in the body of this Award, the Tribunal makes the following

decisions and Award:

(ld) As specified in the body of this Award, the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the
Claimant and its claims under the Treaty and the ICSID Additional Facility Rules.

Respondent’s objections to jurisdiction are dismissed.

(2) As specified in the body of this Award, Respondent has breached its obligations

under Article 5 of the Treaty.

(3) As specified in the body of this Award, Respondent has breached its obligations

under Article 8 of the Treaty.

(4) As specified in the body of this Award, on account of Respondent’s breaches of the
Treaty, Claimant is awarded, and Respondent shall pay to Claimant,

€74,937,003.60.

In light of the sum awarded in (4) with respect to loss or damage to Claimant
incurred under Articles 5 and 8 of the Treaty, the Tribunal considers that Claimant
is fully compensated. Therefore, the Tribunal does not make further awards of
compensation under other provisions of the Treaty cited by Claimant. Claimant’s
claims with respect to an inter-company loan and an alleged denial of fair treatment

in connection with expenses to maintain bonds and guarantees are denied.

Respondent shall pay simple interest at the EURIBOR annual rate (or the Euro
Short Term Rate if applicable in the future) plus 4% on the sum awarded to the
Claimant, i.e. €74,937,003.60, until the date of payment, divided as follows and

commencing on the following dates:

- Commencing | January 2012: interest on the amounts awarded to Claimant in

respect of Claimant’s claims 1.a., 1.b., 1.d. and 6.1-6.4., i.e., on €23,328,600.00.

- Commencing | March 2011: interest on the amounts awarded to Claimant in

respect of all of Claimant’s claims 3, 4 and 5, i.e., on €51,608,403.60.

Respondent shall bear its own legal costs and expenses incurred in these
proceedings. Respondent shall pay to Claimant the amount of €7,101,763.01 and
£1,118,721.20 in respect of 75% of Claimant’s legal costs and expenses and shall
pay simple interest on this amount at the EURIBOR annual rate (or the Euro Short
Term Rate if applicable in the future) plus 4%, such interest to begin to accrue 60

days after the date of this Award.

Respondent shall also pay to Claimant the amount of US$497,533.80 in respect of
the costs of the arbitration. Respondent shall pay simple interest on this amount at
the EURIBOR annual rate (or the Euro Short Term Rate if applicable in the future)

plus 4%, such interest to begin to accrue 60 days after the date of this Award.

All other claims are dismissed.

Partial Dissenting Opinion

1. I firmly believe that dissenting opinions should be resorted to only in the event of
serious disagreements over matters of principle. While I fully respect the views of my
two distinguished colleagues and value the thoroughness with which our deliberations
have been conducted, I am unable to support their decision on the important issues of
advance payments and set-off described below. | thus respectfully dissent with respect

to these issues only.

2. For the sake of clarity, | set out below the main facts relevant to the present opinion.

These facts are extensively developed in the Award.

3. Claimant, Strabag SE, is a large international construction firm incorporated in Austria.
Following the relaxation of international sanctions against Libya, Claimant saw
opportunities for large construction projects in Libya and, through its wholly owned
German subsidiary Strabag International Ltd., secured contracts with the Libyan Roads
and Bridges Authority (“RBA”) in 2006 and 2007 for two major road projects in

Benghazi! and Misurata.?

4. Following Libya’s decision to require foreign construction firms to carry on their
business jointly with a Libyan partner,’ Strabag International Ltd. joined with the

Libyan Investment and Development Company (“LIDCO”) in 2007 to create a joint

venture company under the name of Al Hani General Construction Co. (“Al Hani”).4

Claimant indirectly owns 60% of Al Hani and LIDCO owns the remaining 40%.

5. In 2009, with the approval of RBA, Strabag International Ltd. assigned the Benghazi
and Misurata contracts to Al Hani.> Al Hani also entered into several other contracts
for construction works in Libya. They included the TIAR contract with RBA for the
reconstruction and upgrading of the Tripoli International Airport Road,® the TIAR-NE
contract with RBA for technical studies and designs for the northern extension of the
Tripoli International Airport Road,’ the Garaboulli contract with the Transportation
Projects Board (“TPB”) for the maintenance of the coastal road between Ras Ejdir and
Garaboulli and the development and upgrading of the Tripoli Western Access Road,®
and the Tajura contract with the Housing and Infrastructure Board (“HIB”) for design
and construction work in connection with a major new urban development in the city
of Tajura, a suburb of Tripoli.’ The latter was the largest contract, with an estimated

value of over 778 million Libyan Dinars (“LYD”).

6. Article 10(a) of the Tajura, TIAR, and Garaboulli contracts and Article 2(1) of
Appendix B of the TIAR-NE contract provided for an advance payment to be made to
Al Hani by the relevant contractual counterparty on Respondent’s side. (Article 10(a)
of the Benghazi and Misurata contracts provided for the advance payment to be made
to Strabag International Ltd.) The advance payment constituted part of the total value
of the contract and its purpose was to help Al Hani/Strabag International Ltd. cover the

initial costs incurred in starting the project.

7. In the Benghazi, Misurata, TIAR, TIAR-NE, and Garaboulli contracts, the advance
payment amounted to 15% of the total contract price. In the Tajura contract, it

represented 20% of the contract price.

Case 1:20-cv-02600 Document 1-3 Filed 09/15/20 Page 327 of 337

Because the advance payments were made under each contract prior to the performance
of any works by Strabag International Ltd. (for the Benaghazi and Misurata contracts)
and Al Hani (for the remaining contracts), they were intended to be recouped through
pro rata deductions from Strabag International Ltd.’s/Al Hani’s invoices during the life
of the relevant contract. Strabag International Ltd. or Al Hani, as the case may be, would
repay the advance payments through the deduction of the amount of 15% (or 20% in
the case of the Tajura contract) from each Payment Certificate until the advance
payments were repaid in full. Each Payment Certificate required Strabag International

Ltd./Al Hani to submit proof of works on the specific project.

Each contract required that the advance payments be guaranteed by unconditional and
irrevocable letters of credit obtained by Al Hani (or Strabag International Ltd. for the
Benghazi and Misurata contracts prior to their assignment to Al Hani in 2009) in favor
of the relevant contractual counterparty on Respondent’s side, except for the TIAR-NE
contract, in which Article 2(1) of Appendix B merely provided that the advance
payment should be paid by RBA to Al Hani “in exchange for a letter of guarantee in
the same amount,” without specifying that the letter of guarantee should be

unconditional and irrevocable.'°

It is undisputed between the Parties that Strabag International Ltd. (for the Benghazi
and Misurata contracts) and Al Hani (for the remaining contracts) received all the
contractually mandated advance payments. The amounts of the advance payments
were, for the Benghazi contract, LY D 4,870,803 and EUR 2,949,640;!! for the Misurata
contract, LYD 7,419,344;!? for the Tajura contract, LYD 155,717,915;!> for the TIAR
contract, LYD 11,124,958;'4 for the TIAR-NE contract, LYD 742,500;'° and for the

ll. It is also undisputed that Strabag International Ltd. and Al Hani, directly or through
Claimant, provided the contractually required unconditional and irrevocable advance
payment guarantees, in the form of letters of credit, in favor of the various

counterparties on Respondent’s side.

12. It is likewise undisputed that through the deduction mechanism of Article 10(a),
Respondent completely recovered the advance payments on the Benghazi and Misurata

road contracts.

13. Respondent contends, however, that Al Hani still holds EUR 98,128,159 in unearned
advance payments under the Tajura, TIAR, TIAR-NE, and Garaboulli contracts,'7 and
that Al Hani has an obligation to repay those unearned amounts since they pertain to

work that was never performed by Al Hani under the contracts.'®

14. Accordingly, Respondent contends that if the Tribunal determines that any amounts are
owed to Al Hani under the contracts, such amounts should be set off against the

unearned amounts of the advance payments.

15. Claimant, on the other hand, argues that there are no remaining unearned amounts from
the advance payments, since all the advance payments were applied to work on Al
Hani’s projects and have been used up. It also expresses concern that some letters of
credit in relation to some of the projects remain a potential liability. Claimant contends
that it would suffer significant prejudice and face “double jeopardy” if the Tribunal
were to accept Respondent’s set-off argument and if it then had to honor a call from the

banks, which it would be unable to contest as the bank guarantees are unconditional.!?

7 Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, 208; see also Exhibit RH-15, presentation on quantum by lan Michael
Osbaldeston, slide 7, column J. According to column H, the amounts of unearned advance payments are as
follows: for the TIAR contract, LYD 1,491,601; for the TIAR-NE contract, LYD 556,875; for the Garaboulli
contract, LYD 24,230,566; and for the Tajura contract, LYD 148,570,399. They total EUR 98,128,159. Claimant's.
quantum expert, Patrick A. McGeehin, also states that the balance of the advance payments is around EUR 90
million: safe to say that the current balance of the Advance Payment is somewhere in the 90-some million
range.” See Hearing Transcript, July 19, 2018, 2126:6-8.

Garaboulli Project.”

16. Claimant alleges that three bank guarantees continue to represent liabilities”? for it: (1)

the advance payment guarantee for the Tajura project, Letter of Credit 12293,7!

in an
amount of EUR 51,905,971.53; (2) the performance guarantee for the Tajura project,

guarantee for the TIAR project, Letter of Credit 12402,?? in an amount of LYD

1,002,747.58.

17. The advance payment guarantee for the Tajura project and the performance guarantees
for the Tajura and TIAR projects each consisted of (1) an unconditional and irrevocable
“fronting guarantee” in the form of a standby letter of credit from Gumhouria Bank in
Libya in favor of HIB (for the Tajura guarantees) and RBA (for the TIAR performance
guarantee) and (2) a “backing guarantee” in the form of a counter-guarantee letter of
credit issued by Claimant’s bank, namely ABC International Bank (for the Tajura
guarantees) and Deutsche Bank (for the TIAR performance guarantee), in favor of
Gumhouria Bank. Claimant had to pay fees to ABC International Bank and Deutsche

Bank to maintain the letters of credits.

18. As for the TIAR advance payment guarantee and the TIAR-NE and Garaboulli
guarantees, Claimant does not seem to consider them a potential liability as these were

provided by Al Hani, not by Claimant itself.7*

as well as for performance), Respondent asserts that they had expired by 2012 and

2013.77

The majority of the Tribunal finds that “[t]he testimony at the Hearing and the evidence
on record show that significant elements in the chain of guarantees securing the Tajura
advance payment remain in effect, as does the entire TIAR guarantee and the separate
performance guarantees for both of these Contracts.””* It concludes, therefore, that “the
guarantees, including at least the Tajura backing guarantee and Strabag’s related
obligations to ABC Bank, remain in effect and must be taken into account in assessing

the claimed set-off.””

The majority’s finding that the Tajura guarantees remain valid is premised on (1) the
hearing testimony of Mr. Al Naas, HIB’s senior official responsible for letters of credit,
who stated that HIB was contemplating a possible call on the Tajura guarantees,*° and
(2) “a substantial body of evidence ... showing that Strabag has for many years paid
bank charges to maintain the Tajura and TIAR advance payment and performance
guarantees.”>' According to the majority, “Claimant presumably did not pay these

significant amounts in respect of allegedly ‘non-existent’ guarantees.”??

However, the evidence on the record regarding the Tajura advance payment guarantee
in the amount of EUR 51,905,971.53 (by far the most substantial guarantee) casts
serious doubt on its continuing validity. The record shows that both Gumhouria Bank
and ABC International Bank regarded at least the fronting guarantee component of the

Tajura advance payment guarantee as having expired.

According to the very wording of Letter of Credit 12293, the fronting guarantee was
supposed to remain valid until May 31, 2012, after which date, “and in absence of [HIB]

instructions within its validity, it will be automatically considered as null and void.”*>

The backing guarantee was supposed to be “valid 30 (thirty) days beyond the expiry

date of [the fronting guarantee].”*4

A Swift communication from Gumhouria Bank to ABC International Bank dated July
17, 2012, shows that (1) on March 15, 2012, HIB delivered instructions to Gumhouria
Bank to renew the fronting guarantee, but that those instructions were sent to the wrong
branch of Gumhouria Bank; (2) on July 5, 2012, ABC International Bank sent a Swift
message to Gumhouria Bank asking to be “release[d]” from the backing guarantee; and
(3) on July 17, 2012, Gumhouria Bank requested ABC International Bank to “reinstate”

the guarantee until the end of June 2013.°°

From the foregoing, one may reasonably infer that ABC International Bank considered
the fronting guarantee to have expired given that no request for extension was made
within its validity period. ABC International Bank accordingly asked to be “release[d]”

from the backing guarantee.

The record shows that ABC International Bank considered the backing guarantee to
have expired as well. On December 23, 2015, in response to a Swift communication
from Gumhouria Bank dated November 16, 2015, ABC International Bank stated that
“[a]s advised to you previously, your standby LC reference ST-BY L/C 12293 [i.e., the
fronting guarantee] and our counter guarantee in your favour with Ref No. 10/08/0526

have both expired.”*®

ABC International Bank informed Claimant of its understanding on this matter in a
letter of December 29, 2015.°’ Thus, Claimant was aware of ABC International Bank’s

position that both the fronting guarantee and the backing guarantee had expired.

Moreover, this position was shared by Al Hani. In a letter it sent to HIB as far back as

March I1, 2013, it referred to the Tajura advance payment guarantee as having

expired.*® This understanding was also made clear in Claimant’s submissions in the

course of the proceedings and in statements made by one of Claimant’s witnesses.

29. In its Reply, Claimant states the following:

The Respondent in its Counter-Memorial contends that Al Hani’s
failure to renew the advance payment guarantee, which had lapsed,
explains why the recommencement agreement for the Tajura
Contract was never agreed. The Respondent’s position is
misleading: the disagreement with the advance payment guarantee
was in the context of the negotiations with Gumhouria Bank,
which refused to renegotiate the interest that Al Hani was paying
on its credit facility unless it re-established the guarantee which,
as Mr. Knaack explained in his first witness statement, Al Hani
was unwilling to agree to renew while it was still uncertain
whether Al Hani could proceed with the project.*°

30. Claimant’s assertion in its Reply is borne out by the testimony of Mr. Knaack, the
commercial manager of Al Hani. Mr. Knaack made it clear that Al Hani understood the
Tajura advance payment guarantee, including the backing guarantee between

Gumhouria Bank and ABC International Bank, to have expired:

At this time, | also had a number of meetings with Gumhouria
Bank. As | mentioned above, Al Hani had taken out a credit facility
with Gumhouria Bank in 2010 which we had exhausted, and I tried
to negotiate with the bank a moratorium on interest. However, our
negotiations with Gumhouria Bank were difficult since the bank
would always insist that we agreed to renew the advance payment
guarantee for the Tajura contract. The counter-guarantee between
Gumhouria Bank and ABC Bank had expired due to an
administrative oversight and Gumhouria Bank tried to get us to
agree to rectify this, which we refused to do since it was still
uncertain that we would be able to continue with the project.*?

31. Notwithstanding all of the above, Claimant was charged by ABC International Bank
and agreed to pay it fees for the backing guarantee,‘! despite ABC International Bank’s
clear belief, which Claimant shared, that both the fronting guarantee and the backing

guarantee relating to the advance payment under the Tajura contract had expired.

The conclusions reached by the majority with respect to the issues of the advance

payments and the guarantees are untenable for the reasons given below.

First, the Tribunal unanimously observes that “the state of the Libyan courts remains
very critical,”“? that “Libyan courts are not a practicable and safe option,”*? and that
Claimant had “no viable mechanisms for settling disputes with the Libyan State entities
involved ... other than resorting to Treaty arbitration.”*4 Yet, when it comes to
Respondent’s request for set-off, the majority states that this is a “matter that must be
addressed by the Parties, if it is to be addressed, outside the context of this arbitration,
without indicating in which forum. The practical implications of this distinction is that
contractual claims, insofar as they address Claimant’s rights, are selectively elevated
into treaty claims, while Respondent’s set-off requests arising from the same
contractual relationship are denied similar treatment and are to be addressed “outside

the context of this arbitration” in a forum yet to be identified by Respondent.

Having determined that it had jurisdiction over Claimant’s contractual claims, and
having supplanted Libyan courts for the purpose of deciding those claims, the Tribunal
was under the obligation to comprehensively resolve the dispute, as Libyan courts
would have done. Consequently, it was incumbent on the Tribunal to rule on the issue

of the advance payments with a view to settling all amounts against all contracts.

Respondent’s proposition that the amounts resulting from Claimant’s claims for
damage had to be set off against the unearned portions of the advance payments finds
support in Libyan law, which is the law applicable to the underlying contracts. Article
184(1) of the Libyan Civil Code states: “Whoever receives, by way of payment, what
is not owed to him must return it.” Similarly, Article 185 of the Libyan Civil Code
provides: “A payment which was not due may be recovered if it was made in the
performance of an obligation whose cause had not materialized or had ceased to exist.”
In the same vein, Article 349 of the Libyan Civil Code (entitled “debts capable of set-

off’) allows the amount owed by a debtor to a creditor to be set off against the amount

owed by the creditor to the debtor. This is possible even when the claims do not arise
from the same source, i.e., if the claimant is seeking a claim under one contract and the

respondent is seeking set-off for overpaid funds under another contract.

Second, the majority expresses concern regarding the “continued existence of the
unconditional and irrevocable guarantees created to secure the advance payments and

other aspects of Al Hani’s performance.’“°

However, the evidence on record from both Parties with respect to the advance payment
guarantees is confusing and contradictory, and any assertion that the Tajura guarantees
(by far the most substantial ones) are still valid is speculative. It is noteworthy that the
majority gives undue weight to the testimony of one of Respondent’s witnesses, Mr.
Naas, in relation to the Tajura bank guarantees, even though Respondent distanced itself
from the testimony of Mr. Naas in its letter to the Tribunal of November 15, 2019.47 It
is striking that while the Award frequently casts doubts on Respondent’s witnesses and
their testimonies, qualifying them as contradictory, inconsistent, or unconvincing,*® the
majority makes a positive assessment of the testimony of one of Respondent’s

witnesses on this particular issue.

The majority posits that it “could not apply the requested set-off without firm
arrangements in place to assure that Claimant’s exposure under the guarantees would
at the same time be reduced or ended to the extent of any set-off." It adds that the
Tribunal “has no authority to address this difficulty without the agreement of the

Parties.”5° Both assertions are arguable.

As indicated in the Award, the drafters of the Austria-Libya BIT saw set-offs as lying
within a tribunal’s jurisdiction per Article 13 of the treaty, and Respondent’s claimed
set-off can reasonably be viewed as an “incidental or additional claim” for purposes of

Article 47 of the ICSID’s Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules.°! The Tribunal

therefore has jurisdiction over the advance payment issue, irrespective of any
jurisdiction it has to rule on the bank guarantees. Even if all the bank guarantees were
deemed still to be valid and any decision on the advance payment were to be made
conditional on the prior resolution of the issue of the bank guarantees (which is the
approach taken by the majority), it would have been possible to determine the amount
of the unearned portions of the advance payments and allow Respondent to proceed
with set-off only afier releasing all the bank guarantees still in its possession.
Alternatively, Respondent could have been requested to provide evidence that the

guarantees had been cleared prior to any ruling on set-off.

Third, while the majority stresses the necessary link between the advance payments and
the bank guarantees, it overlooks the obvious overlap between the advance payments

and some of Claimant’s claims for damages.

While Respondent and its expert provide detailed figures for advance payments that
they consider not yet to have been earned,*? Claimant states vaguely, with little
supporting documentation, that the full advance payments had been fully used up to
finance “significant costs that Strabag incurred upfront at the outset of the projects (for
example, in recruiting and mobilising personnel, constructing site facilities, purchasing
equipment and machinery, and engaging sub-contractors).”*? By its own admission,
Claimant used unearned portions of the advance payments to buy equipment and supply

the joint venture with cash.

The Tribunal nonetheless awards Claimant compensation for some of the
aforementioned up-front costs, including for lost or damaged equipment and damages
caused by delay. Without proper consideration of the issue of advance payments, it may
well turn out that the Award compensates Claimant for equipment and other costs that,
by Claimant’s own admission, have already been covered using unearned portions of

the advance payments, i.e., monies from Respondent.

As Respondent states in its written submissions:

If the Tribunal awards damages for loss of equipment as requested
by Claimant without offsetting the unearned portions of the

Advance Payments, then Al-Hani would have received twice the
value of the equipment: first by way of damages and second by
means of the unearned retained Advance Payments. This double
recovery is impermissible.*4
44, A task partially completed may prove in practice to be more problematic than a task not
initiated at all. The majority’s decision to summarily deny Respondent’s requested set-
off®> fails to recognize that the issues of the advance payments, the bank guarantees,
and Claimant’s claims for damages are intertwined and cannot be resolved separately.
This fragmentation is not conducive to “good order and fundamental fairness,”°* to

which the majority and indeed the entire Tribunal aspired.
