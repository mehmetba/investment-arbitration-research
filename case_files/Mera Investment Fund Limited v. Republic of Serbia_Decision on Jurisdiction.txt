to fully restructure e.g. transfer their assets and liabilities to a newly incorporated Cyprus company and liquidate the
former, thus avoiding possible tax and other implications in the country of origin. An additional and equally important
advantage is that the business of the company can continue without interruption and hence there will be a significant
saving in administration and other costs.”

contribution in kind.” In January 2010, the Claimant contributed the remainder of

The Respondent

The Respondent is the Republic of Serbia (“Respondent”). The Respondent is
represented in this arbitration by Ms. Senka Mihaj, Mr. Aleksandar Fillen, Ms.
Bojana Bilanko of Mihaj, Tlic & Milanovic, in collaboration with Prof. Dr. Vladimir
Pavic of the Faculty of Law of the University of Belgrade, Mr. Vladimir Djeric of
Mikijelj Jankovic & Bogdanovic, along with Ms. Olivera Stanimirovic, State
Attorney of Serbia, and Ms. Milena Babic of the Serbian State Attorney’s Office.

The origin of the present dispute

13.

According to the Claimant’s case, from early 2013 until the present the Respondent
adopted a number of measures against Mera Invest, including the freezing of all of
its assets, the fabrication of a tax claim against Mera Invest, and the blocking of
Mera Invest’s bank accounts, accounts receivables from related companies and
bank accounts and accounts receivables of certain companies affiliated with Mera
Invest.78

It is the Claimant's case that these measures in turn caused Mera Invest’s businesses
to cease trading and be destroyed, projects came to a complete halt and were
abandoned, term deposits were lost and Mera Invest became overindebted.”? The
Claimant submits that as a result, the Respondent has deprived the Claimant of its
investments in Serbia.*°

The BIT

C-039,

Decision on Jurisdiction

The Republic of Cyprus and the Republic of Serbia (at the time of signing still the
State Union of Serbia and Montenegro) signed the BIT on 21 July 2005, which
entered into force on 23 December 2005. Serbia is the universal legal successor of
the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro and has fully inherited its international
legal personality and international agreements.*”

Specifically, the Claimant relies upon Article 5(1) of the BIT, pursuant to which
investments under the BIT shall not be nationalized, expropriated or subjected to
measures having the effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation.**

The Claimant also relies on Article 2(2) of the BIT, requiring that “[i]nvestments
of investors of each contracting party shall at all times be accorded fair and
equitable treatment [...] in the territory of the other Contracting Party.”*4

The Claimant bases further claims under the portion of Article 2(2) of the BIT
which mandates full protection and security over investments of investors covered
under the BIT.*>

Lastly, the Claimant cites Article 10 of the BIT for its claims. The relevant provision
states that “[i]f the laws of either Contracting Party [...] contain provisions entitling
investments by investors of the other Contracting Party to a treatment more
favourable than is provided for by the present Agreement, such laws [...] shall to
the extent that they are more favourable prevail over this Agreement.”*°

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

C-181

On 3 January 2017, the Claimant filed a request for arbitration dated
28 December 2016 (“RfA”)*” with ICSID.

Upon receipt of the prescribed lodging fee from the Claimant on 23 January 2017,
and in accordance with Article 36 of the ICSID Convention, the Secretary-General
of ICSID (“Secretary-General”) registered the Request for Arbitration and
notified the Parties on the same date.

In accordance with the Parties’ agreed method of constituting the arbitral tribunal,
the tribunal is composed of Dr. Georg von Segesser, a national of Switzerland, as
the presiding arbitrator; The Honourable L. Yves Fortier, a national of Canada,
appointed by the Claimant; and Dr. Bernardo M. Cremades, a national of the
Republic of Spain, appointed by the Respondent (together referred to as the
“Arbitral Tribunal’).

On 22 May 2017, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(1), the Secretary-General
notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and

Cyprus-Serbia BIT, Article 5 (CL-001).

Cyprus-Serbia BIT, Article 2(2) (CL-001).

Cyprus-Serbia BIT, Article 2(2) (CL-001).

Cyprus-Serbia BIT, Article 10 (CL-001).

The Request for Arbitration was accompanied by factual exhibits (C-001 to C-004) and one legal authority (CL-1).

that the Arbitral Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on such
date. Ms. Milanka Kostadinova, ICSID Senior Legal Adviser, was also designated
to serve as the Secretary of the Tribunal.

On 27 July 2017, the Arbitral Tribunal held the first session at the World Bank
Conference Centre in Paris. Subsequently, on 1 August 2017, the Arbitral Tribunal
issued Procedural Order No. | setting out the procedure to be followed in the
arbitration (“PO 1”). At the first session, the Respondent indicated that it considered
submitting jurisdictional objections and filing a request for bifurcation. The
Procedural Timetable attached as Annex A to PO 1 provided for alternative
scenarios, with and without bifurcation.

On 31 October 2017, the Claimant submitted its Memorial on the Merits (“C-M”),

together with two witness statements,** two expert reports,” factual exhibits*” and
legal authorities.*!

Between 30 November 2017 and 9 January 2018, the Parties exchanged Requests
for Production of Documents and their corresponding objections in the form of
Redfern Schedules.

After a review of the Respondent’s Reply to Claimant’s Objections to Document
Production Requests and the completed Redfern Schedule, the Arbitral Tribunal
concluded that without a preliminary substantiation of the objections to the Arbitral
Tribunal’s jurisdiction, it was premature to determine with sufficient reliability
which documents may be relevant and material to the outcome of its decision on
jurisdiction. On this basis, on 15 January 2018, the Arbitral Tribunal invited the
Respondent to submit its Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction together with any
corresponding revision to its document production requests, and set a time limit for
when the Claimant was to submit its comments.

Pursuant to the Arbitral Tribunal’s instructions of 15 January 2018, on
26 January 2018, the Respondent submitted its Preliminary Objections to
Jurisdiction (“R-POJ”), together with an accompanying witness statement*” and
legal authorities.** Included in its submission was a request by the Respondent to
bifurcate the proceedings.

On 5 February 2018, the Claimant submitted its comments on the Respondent’s
Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction (“C-CoJ”) with legal authorities.“

Decision on Jurisdiction

31. With its Procedural Order No. 2, dated 9 February 2018, the Arbitral Tribunal
issued its decisions on document production requests (“PO 2”). Thereafter, the
Claimant produced the documents ordered by the Arbitral Tribunal without the need
for an intervention by the Arbitral Tribunal on the matter.

32. On 31 March 2018, the Respondent submitted its Counter Memorial (“R-CM”),
together with two witness statements,*> four expert reports,*° factual exhibits*’ and
legal authorities.** In its Counter Memorial the Respondent set out its position on
jurisdiction, the admissibility of the Claimant’s claim and on bifurcation.

33. On 27 April 2018, the Claimant submitted its Reply to the Request for Bifurcation
(“C-RoB”) together with legal authorities.”

34. On 16 May 2018, the Arbitral Tribunal issued its Decision on Bifurcation
bifurcating the proceedings to address the Respondent’s objections to jurisdiction
concerning the Claimant’s status as an investor under the BIT, as well as the
Respondent’s objection regarding the jurisdictional requirements of “investment”
as defined by Article 1(1) of the BIT. The Arbitral Tribunal denied the
Respondent’s request for bifurcation for the Respondent’s third objection
concerning the admissibility of the Claimant’s claim based on the fork in the road
principle.

35. On 31 July 2018, the Claimant filed its Reply on Jurisdictional Objections (“C-
RJ”) accompanied by two witness statements,°° two expert reports,*! factual
exhibits and legal authorities.*>

36. On 14 August 2018, the Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 on the
organization of the hearing on jurisdictional issues (“PO 3”).

37. By letter dated 17 August 2018, the Respondent requested leave from the Arbitral
Tribunal to submit additional evidence. On 22 August 2018, the Claimant provided
its reply to the Respondent’s request. With its Procedural Order No. 4 (“PO 4”) of
23 August 2018, the Arbitral Tribunal dismissed the Respondent’s request of
17 August 2018 to add additional evidence to the record.

ANALYSIS

Law applicable to jurisdiction

49. The Parties agree that the jurisdictional requirements for a case to be brought before
an ICSID Tribunal are contained in the ICSID Convention and in the BIT. More
precisely, the Arbitral Tribunal’s jurisdiction is determined by the provisions of
Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and Article 9 of the BIT.

50. The relevant provision of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention reads as follows:
“The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out

In addition to an audio recording of the hearing on jurisdiction deposited in the archives of ICSID, a transcript of the
hearing was prepared by the court reporters and shall be cited in the following as Tr. J. [I/II] [page:line].

of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or
agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national
of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to
submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may
withdraw its consent unilaterally.”°’

The text of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention requires that four conditions must
be met for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction: (i) the dispute must be between a
Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State, (ii) the parties must
have expressed their consent to ICSID arbitration in writing, (iii) the dispute must
be a legal one, and (iv) it must arise directly out of an investment.

The Arbitral Tribunal observes that both States that are relevant to this dispute are
Contracting States of the ICSID Convention. Serbia signed the ICSID Convention
and deposited the instrument of ratification on 9 May 2007. The ICSID Convention
entered into force in Serbia on 8 June 2007. Serbia is therefore a Contracting State
for the purposes of the ICSID Convention. Cyprus signed the Convention on 9
March 1966 and deposited its ratification on 25 November 1966. The ICSID
Convention entered into force in the Republic of Cyprus on 25 December 1966.

The Arbitral Tribunal’s jurisdiction is also contingent upon the terms of the
document in which consent to arbitration is contained, in this case the BIT. The
Arbitral Tribunal must be satisfied that the terms of Article 9 of the BIT, and by
extension the terms of Article 1 (which defines the terms “investor” and
“investment”), have been complied with.

Article 9 of the BIT provides for ICSID arbitration in the following terms:

“1. Disputes between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting
Party in relation to an investment for the purpose of this Agreement, shall be
submitted in written form, with all detailed information, by the investor of the other
Contracting Party. Where possible, the parties shall endeavor to settle these disputes
amicably.

2. If these disputes cannot be settled by negotiations within six months from the
written notification under paragraph | of this Article, they may be submitted, by the
choice of the investor, to:

- a competent court of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is
made;

- an ad hoc tribunal of arbitration, in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the
United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL);

- arbitration court of the International Chamber of Commerce in Paris; or

- International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) set up by

the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and
Nationals of other States, from 18th March 1965.”

Decision on Jurisdiction

55. In line with the general practice of other ICSID tribunals, the Arbitral Tribunal
interprets the BIT and the ICSID Convention according to the rules set forth in the
Vienna Convention on the Laws of Treaties (“Vienna Convention”), much of
which reflects customary international law.>*

56. Article 31 of the Vienna Convention provides that “[a] treaty shall be interpreted in
good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the
treaty in their context and in light of its object and purpose.”*? The terms of the BIT
shall therefore be interpreted against the background of the provision in which it
appears, as well as the background of the BIT as a whole.

57. According to Article 31(2) of the Vienna Convention the context for the purposes
of interpreting the treaty includes the text of the treaty as well as “its preamble and
annexes”. Under Article 31(3)(c) “TaJny relevant rules of international law
applicable in the relations between the parties” shall also be considered.°!

58. Furthermore, the Arbitral Tribunal may take recourse to supplementary means of
interpretation under Article 32 of the Vienna Convention either “to confirm the
meaning resulting from the application of [A]rticle 31” or to determine the meaning
when the interpretation according to Article 31 leaves the meaning of the term
“ambiguous or obscure” or leads to a result which is “manifestly absurd or
unreasonable.”

The Respondent’s objections to jurisdiction

59. In the following, the Arbitral Tribunal will review and analyze the Respondent’s
specific objections to jurisdiction over the Claimant’s claim in the following order:

(1) Whether the Claimant is an “investor” as defined by Article 1(3)(b) of the
BIT (jurisdiction ratione personae)?

(2) Whether the Claimant meets the jurisdictional requirements of “investment”
as defined by Article 1(1) of the BIT (jurisdiction ratione materiae)?

(3) Whether granting jurisdiction would defeat the object and purpose of the
BIT?

(4) Whether granting jurisdiction would go against the object and purpose of the
ICSID Convention?

60. The Arbitral Tribunal summarizes the Parties’ respective positions in the below,
which are further dealt with to the extent relevant in the sections of the Arbitral
Tribunal’s findings.

Decision on Jurisdiction

Whether the Claimant is an “investor” pursuant to Article 1(3)(b) of the BIT
(jurisdiction ratione personae)?

Article 1(3)(b) of the BIT provides that ‘investor’ shall mean “a legal entity
incorporated, constituted or otherwise duly organized in accordance with the laws
and regulations of one Contracting Party, having its seat in the territory of that
Contracting Party and making investments in the territory of the other Contracting
Party.”

Thus, for the Claimant to qualify as an investor, it must be a legal entity
(i) incorporated, constituted or otherwise duly organized according to the laws of
the Republic of Cyprus, (ii) having its seat in the territory of the Republic of Cyprus,
and (iii) making investments in the territory of Serbia. Article 1(3)(b) of the BIT
does not on its face contain any additional requirements for an entity to qualify as
an investor under the BIT.

The Arbitral Tribunal must decide what is meant by the terms of Article 1(3)(b) of
the BIT and will address the Respondent’s objections to each of these three
cumulative conditions in the following.

Whether the Claimant is “a legal entity incorporated, constituted or otherwise
duly organized in accordance with the laws and regulations of” Cyprus?

1.1.1) | The Respondent’s position

According to the Respondent, the Claimant does not fulfill all of the requirements
mandated under Cypriot law for proper incorporation.® The Respondent argues that
under Cypriot law, in order for a company to be properly incorporated it must have
a registered office, and in order for an address to qualify as a registered office, the

company must have “some right to use such premises”.

The Respondent contests the validity of the lease agreement of 31 December 2013
(“Lease Agreement”) produced by the Claimant in these proceedings for its office
space at Arch. Makariou III 66, Kronos Court, 1st floor, Office 12, 1770 Nicosia,
Cyprus.® According to the Respondent, Article 77 of the Cypriot Contract Law
requires real estate lease agreements for periods in excess of twelve months be
“concluded in written form and must be countersigned by two witnesses”.° The
Respondent argues that since the Lease Agreement was issued for an indefinite
term, it had to be signed before two witnesses, which it was not. The Respondent
concludes that the Claimant fails to meet the requirement of having a registered
office and, as such, also fails to satisfy the requirement of proper incorporation.
According to the Respondent, the Claimant cannot thereby be deemed an investor
pursuant to Article 1(3)(b) of the BIT.”

Decision on Jurisdiction

66. In addition, the Respondent claims that the Claimant undertook steps in bad faith
to obtain proper incorporation only in preparation for a potential investment
arbitration. The Respondent argues that the Lease Agreement was only allegedly
issued well after the beginning of the alleged breaches of the BIT by the
Respondent.” Furthermore, in the Respondent’s view, the “[s]udden invoicing and
rent payments occurred only after the dispute has already arisen and Claimant
undoubtedly became cognizant of the jurisdictional obstacles it will face.”’° For the
Respondent, the nationality of a party must be assessed against the timing of the
dispute, and the manipulation of nationality requirements for pre-existing disputes
has to be regarded as abusive.’! As a result, the Respondent asks that the Claimant’s
“abusive tactics” be sanctioned by finding that it does not meet the incorporation
requirement under the BIT.””

1.1.2) | The Claimant’s position

67. The Claimant maintains that it is validly incorporated in Cyprus.”? The Claimant
relies on the certificates issued by the relevant legal authorities in Cyprus as proof
of its incorporation in Cyprus since March 2009,” as well as the evidentiary
testimony of its expert Mr. Alecos Markides, former Attorney General of Cyprus.”>

68. The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s argument that a registered office is an
element of incorporation under the BIT or Cypriot law.” According to the
Claimant, “incorporation” and “registered office” are two distinct notions and the
requirements to establish a registered office are built on those for incorporation.””
In any event, the Claimant maintains that even if one were to accept that a registered
office is an element of incorporation, as well as, accept the Respondent’s argument
that the Lease Agreement is null and void, the Claimant still has a valid title to its
registered office. ’*

69. Citing the Respondent’s own expert, the Claimant argues that under Cypriot law “if
a contract of lease is void and the rent is paid by the tenant possessing this property
on a monthly or annual basis, the status of the tenant is construed that he is a tenant
from month to month or from year to year pursuant to a verbal agreement of
monthly or annual duration.””? The Claimant relies on payment confirmations,*” as

well as witness testimony of Ms. Tatiana Ieronymides,*! as proof that the lease for
its registered office is valid and has been concluded since 2012.

1.1.3) — The Arbitral Tribunal’s findings

70. The Arbitral Tribunal accepts the incorporation certificates submitted by the
Claimant as proof of its valid incorporation in Cyprus.** There is nothing on the
face of these documents which prevents the Arbitral Tribunal from finding that they
were validly issued by the relevant authorities on the dates indicated. Thus, as of
the date when the provisional certificate of continuation was obtained on 20 March
2009, the Claimant Company is to be treated by operation of the law as having been
incorporated in Cyprus. The Arbitral Tribunal finds no reason to discredit the expert

testimony of Mr. Alecos Markides confirming this fact.*°

71. Nevertheless, even if the Arbitral Tribunal were to accept the Respondent’s line of
reasoning that a registered office is a precondition to incorporation in Cyprus, and
that in order to establish a registered office one must evidence some right of use
over the property — of which the Arbitral Tribunal is not convinced — these elements
are considered to be satisfied in the present case.

72. The fact that the Lease Agreement was not signed before two witnesses is in the
end irrelevant. Irrespective of the validity or enforceability of the Lease Agreement,
the document demonstrates the intention of the concerned entities to enter into a
legally binding agreement. The Respondent acknowledges that “[t]he validity for
voidance of lack of written form allows [ someone to prove that there was, in
place of that, an oral agreement for this period of time. [...] in absence of contract
in proper written form, then proof of when the contract was concluded, whether it
was performed, relies purely on payments.”*+

 

73. The Claimant has submitted a number of confirmations of rent payments and rental
invoices issued by the lessor of the property in question.*° The Claimant's physical
presence at its registered office has also been confirmed by the Claimant’s expert
Mr. Alecos Markides, on whose instructions his associate lawyer made an
unannounced visit to the Claimant’s premises, took pictures of the facilities, and
inspected the company documents available for public viewing.*° Taken together,
this evidence, coupled with the credible witness testimony of the Claimant’s

as regards the case at hand [...] as expressly stated in the last 3 lines of paragraph 46 at page 29 of PD, ‘This tenancy
from month to month complies with the requirements of Cyprus Companies Law and creates sufficient right of use or

manager Ms. Tatiana Ieronymides,*’ is sufficient to demonstrate that the Claimant
had occupied the premises located at Arch. Makariou III 66, Kronos Court, Ist
floor, Office 12, 1770 Nicosia, Cyprus.** This is, in the Arbitral Tribunal’s view,
enough to be considered as having a right to use the premises in question, thereby
validating the status of the Claimant’s registered office and incorporation based on
the Respondent’s argumentation. The exact terms and scope of the Claimant’s
tenancy, be it of short-term or indefinite duration, is not of relevance to the present
case and need not be decided by the Arbitral Tribunal.

74. Furthermore, the Arbitral Tribunal is not convinced by the Respondent’s multiple
allegations of malfeasance on the part of the Claimant.*? Insofar as the Respondent
argues that the Claimant deceptively attempts to meet the requirements set out by
the majority in the CEAC v. Montenegro case for an office to qualify as a registered
office under Cyprus law,” the Arbitral Tribunal takes note of the fact that the
decision in the CEAC case was issued on 26 July 2016, whereas the Lease
Agreement produced by the Respondent is dated 31 December 2013. Thus, even if.
the Arbitral Tribunal were to accept the requirements established by the majority in
CEAC, which is not the case,°! it could not be that the Respondent only entered into
the Lease Agreement in order to avoid jurisdictional pitfalls and meet the
requirements established by the majority in the CEAC case, since the Lease
Agreement was issued two and a half years before the ICSID decision was rendered.
The Arbitral Tribunal has no reason not to believe that the Lease Agreement was
created in December 2013. The fact that there are signatures missing, again, does
not in the view of the Arbitral Tribunal lead to a finding that the Claimant did not
have the right to use the premises mentioned in such document. In addition, as
regard to the timing of the confirmation of rent payments and rental invoices
submitted by the Claimant in these proceedings, there is nothing on the face of these
documents which requires the Arbitral Tribunal to call into question their
authenticity or their evidentiary value.

75. With the right of the Claimant to use the property in question, even without a validly
executed written lease agreement, and the payment of a rent starting well before the
present arbitration has been initiated, there can be no reason to assume that the
Claimant undertook steps in bad faith to obtain proper incorporation in Cyprus, as

Tr. J.1152:5-15 (Ms. Tatiana Ieronymides): “Mera moved to my office, 66 Makariou Avenue, back in 2012, and that’s
what gave right. So to have all accounts there, everything was managed from there, the meetings were happening there:
the directors would come to sign, you know, the documents which needed. I was talking to the banks from that office.
So for me this is only a formal and the lease agreement and the payment. Mera is there in this 66
Makariou Avenue; nothing changes that. And I am sitting in that office [...].”; Witness Statement of Ms. Tatiana
Ieronymides, dated 31 July 2018, paras 7, 23-24 (CWS-4). Ms. Ieronymides’ testimony confirms that she resides in
Nicosia, Cyprus and has run the “family office” of the companies of the Mi8kovié family, ie. the five investment
companies which include the Claimant, out of their office in Nicosia (Witness Statement of Ms. Tatiana Ieronymides,
dated 31 July 2018, paras 7-8 (CWS-4)). In the Arbitral Tribunal’s view there can be no question that the Claimant has
a physical presence at its registered office.

the Respondent suggests, only in preparation of its claims in the present
proceedings.

1.2) Whether the Claimant has “its seat in the territory of’ Cyprus?

1.2.1) The Respondent’s position

76. According to the Respondent, the term “seat” as used in Article 1(3)(b) of the BIT,
should be understood by its ordinary meaning in the context of a nationality
criterion of investment treaties, as meaning the place of effective management.”
The Respondent argues that effective management refers to “those people in an
organization (legal person) who are actually responsible for controlling and
organizing the organization, and who actually manage its business and
operations.”°* For the Respondent, the purpose of the BIT, being the creation of
favourable conditions for greater economic cooperation between the Contracting
Parties, can only be served “when investors who possess a true, genuine connection
with one Contracting Party to the BIT, invest in [the] territory of the other
Contracting Party.”°* The Respondent maintains that there must be a substantive
link between the company and the country in which it is organized and to assess the
seat of a company one must look to who actually makes the decisions with regards
to its business.°>

77. The Respondent argues for the interpretation of the second condition of
Article 1(3)(b) of the BIT under international law without renvoi to municipal
law.*° This is, according to the Respondent, supported by the fact that
Article 1(3)(b) of the BIT refers to national law only in respect of incorporation,
and not in respect of seat.°” The Respondent also cites Article 9(4) of the BIT which
stipulates the application of international law in case of disputes under the BIT.°*

78. Inthe Respondent’s view since the Claimant’s place of effective management was
not in Cyprus, but rather in Serbia, the Claimant fails to fulfill the second
requirement of Article 1(3)(b) of the BIT, and hence cannot be deemed an investor
under the BIT.”? The Respondent takes the position that “none of the decisions
concerning the business operations of the Claimant were made by anyone in
Cyprus”, but that rather, “the decision-making process was at all times in the hands
of Serbian nationals, Messrs. Miskovic.”!° According to the Respondent, the
Claimant is nothing more than a conduit for the Claimant’s owners to conduct its

business activities and gain access to a dispute settlement mechanism reserved for
investments and investors of foreign character. !°!

Furthermore, the Respondent argues that even if renvoi is made to Cypriot law, the
term seat would not mean a registered office. '°? The Respondent maintains that the
term “seat” as contained in the BIT cannot be equated with a “registered office” as
proposed by the Claimant since a registered office is a formal prerequisite for legal
existence of a company under Cypriot law.'°? The Respondent argues that in order
to give meaning to the term seat, as read in the context of Article 1(3)(b) of the BIT,
it must indicate something in addition to incorporation, like management of and
control over the investment, and therefore it cannot be taken to signify a registered
office. !

1.2.2) | The Claimant’s position

The Claimant argues that it satisfies the second condition of Article 1(3)(b) of the
BIT as it maintains a seat in Cyprus. According to the Claimant, international law
requires that the term “seat”, as set out in the context of the BIT, be interpreted as
the physical location of a legal entity in the unoccupied territory of Cyprus
following the Turkish invasion of northern Cyprus in 1974.!°

Alternatively, the Claimant argues that even if the term “seat” were interpreted
outside of its context, international law dictates a renvoi to Cypriot municipal law,
according to which “seat” means a registered office.!°° The Claimant claims to
fulfill all of the requirements of the substantive requirements prescribed under the
Cypriot Companies Law for its registered office located at Arch. Makariou III 66,
Kronos Court, Ist floor, Office 12, 1770 Nicosia, Cyprus. !°7 According to the
Claimant, this is also the “place where its board of directors meets and where its

shareholder convene [sic]”,'°* thus being the place where it “conducts [its] main

corporate functions”. !”

The Claimant submits that the term seat, as utilized in the BIT, is to be interpreted
broadly, and does not require any particular activity.!'° Thus even if no renvoi to
Cypriot municipal law were made, under international law, the Claimant maintains
that the term “seat” as set forth in the relevant BIT does not imply any “real
economic activities”, “beneficial ownership” or “ultimate control”.!!!

83. Furthermore, even if no renvoi to Cypriot municipal law were made and under
international law seat means effective management, the Claimant argues that this
would entail the management of company by its statutory directors and managers
and not the activities of shareholders and beneficiaries, and that in the present case
the Claimant’s place of effective management is in Cyprus.!!”

1.2.3) The Arbitral Tribunal’s findings

84. The Arbitral Tribunal undertakes to analyze the meaning of the term “seat” as set
out in Article 1(3)(b) of the BIT pursuant to international law.

85. Looking first to the ICSID Convention, it is well-accepted that Article 25 of the
ICSID Convention leaves it to the contracting parties to determine nationality,
including corporate nationality. Accordingly, the ICSID Convention does not
specify what should be understood as the seat of a legal entity. The tribunal in
Rompetrol recognized that “[a]s ICSID tribunals and commentators have regularly
observed, the drafters of the Convention abandoned efforts to define ‘nationality’
for the purposes of Article 25, and instead left the State Parties wide latitude to
agree on criteria by which nationality would be determined.” ''> The latitude granted
to define nationality for purpose of Article 25 is considered to be “at its greatest in
the context of corporate nationality under a BIT”.''* In the present case, although
the BIT sets out the three-part test for establishing the nationality of a legal person,
it fails to provide further guidance as to what is to be understood by the requirement

of a “seat in the territory of that Contracting Party”.!!°

86. As acknowledged in the separate opinion of Prof. William W. Park in the CEAC
case, “[i]nternational law as it currently stands provides no uniformly accepted
‘ordinary meaning’ of corporate seat.”!!® The tribunal in Tenaris & Talta also
observed that similarly “[...] it is clear that neither [‘sede’ or ‘siége social’] has
been used in international law and practice as a consistent ‘legal term of art’, with

only one meaning”.!!7

87. The Arbitral Tribunal finds it difficult to accept the Respondent’s position that the
term “seat” is ordinarily understood in international law to convey the place of
effective management, i.e. where decisions are effectively made. Absent from the
wording of Article 1(3)(b) of the BIT is language requiring that there be a
substantive link between the company and the country in which it is organized.
When interpreting the same provision of the BIT as in issue in the present
arbitration, Prof. William W. Park noted in CEAC that “[s]ometimes ‘seat’ marries

with a qualifier to become siége réel or ‘real seat’”, but however noted that the
present BIT “did not adopt such language” and “[a]n arbitral tribunal would be bold
indeed to add adjectives on its own initiative [as the] Treaty drafters introduced no
such additional requirements”.''* As recognized in the decision on jurisdiction and
admissibility in the Yukos Universal Limited v. The Russian Federation case, “[t]he
principles of international law, which have an unquestionable importance in treaty
interpretation, do not allow an arbitral tribunal to write new, additional
requirements — which the drafters did not include — into a treaty, no matter how
auspicious or appropriate they may appear.”!!°

88. To require that the “effective management” take place in Cyprus absent such
wording in the BIT would be to import into the treaty an obligation which is absent.
As correctly noted by Prof. William W. Park in the CEAC case, however desirable
this may be from a policy perspective “an arbitral tribunal bears a duty of fidelity
to the treaty text as drafted, and cannot rewrite the contract states’ bargain.”!?°
According to the Respondent it is “usual practice in Cyprus as it has been known
for years as a popular offshore jurisdiction, and one need only google ‘Cyprus
offshore’ to find a plethora of links to various law and consultancy firms offering
services of incorporating and maintaining companies on Cyprus.”!?! If the
Respondent is of this viewpoint, then when it negotiated the BIT in question it could
have required that in order for a legal entity to qualify as an investor under the BIT,
it would need to be managed and controlled in the place of incorporation. It is not
for the Arbitral Tribunal to insert additional requirements into the BIT which could
have easily been inserted by the negotiators at the time of drafting, but were not.!2*

89. Since there is no definition of “seat” in the ICSID Convention, nor in the BIT, and
no uniform definition under international law, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that
the term in question must be interpreted by way of renvoi to municipal law. In
Barcelona Traction, the International Court of Justice affirmed that
“[...] international law has had to recognize the corporate entity as an institution
created by States in a domain essentially within their domestic jurisdiction. This in
turn requires that, whenever legal issues arise concerning the rights of States with
regard to the treatment of companies and shareholders, as to which rights
international law has not established its own rules, it has to refer to the relevant

rules of municipal law.”!?? The renvoi approach for the treatment of corporate
entities is also promoted by the commentary to Article 9 of the International Law
Commission's Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection, which states that
“[...] international law has no rules of its own for the creation, management and
dissolution of a corporation or for the rights of shareholders and their relationship
with the corporation, and must consequently turn to municipal law for guidance on
this subject [...]”.!"4 Professor Schreuer admits that municipal law may be relevant
for ICSID jurisdiction. According to Prof. Schreuer, “[d]efinitions of corporate
nationality in national legislation or in treaties providing for ICSID’s jurisdiction
are directly relevant to the determination of whether the nationality requirements of
Art. 25(2)(b) have been met [...] Therefore, any reasonable determination of the
nationality of juridical persons contained in national legislation or in a treaty should
be accepted by an ICSID commission or tribunal.”!?5

 

The concept of a “seat” of a legal entity remains essentially a municipal law concept
derived from civil law tradition and is foreign to Cypriot law which is rooted in
English common law. As confirmed by the Claimant’s legal expert, former
Attorney General of Cyprus, Mr. Alecos Markides, Cypriot law “does not recognise
any notion equivalent to the French law concept of ‘siége social’ or the German law
concept of ‘real or effective seat””.!?° Mr. Alecos Markides goes on to propose that
“Tijnstead, Cypriot law adopts the so-called ‘incorporation’ approach to
determining a company’s lex societatis”,'?” and that as a result “a company ‘seated’
in Cyprus is one that is incorporated in Cyprus and maintains a registered office in
the Republic”. !78 Professor William W. Park in CEAC, also Iunderstood the term
“seat” as set out in Article 1(3)(b) of the BIT to mean a “registered office” and
thereby established that “the plain meaning of registered office, best matches the
meaning of ‘seat’ in Cyprus as used in this particular Treaty.” !??

The Arbitral Tribunal considers this approach of defining the term seat to be fitting
in the present case. Given the placement of the term “seat” as a second condition in
the list of requirements for a legal entity to qualify as an investor under the BIT, the
Arbitral Tribunal accepts that this term should be understood as a different and
separate criterion than the requirement of incorporation. In the Arbitral Tribunal’s
view, as compared to incorporation which relies generally on the execution of
documents, the requirement of a seat involves what the Arbitral Tribunal considers
to be an element of physical presence. The Arbitral Tribunal finds the statements
made by the Claimant’s witness, Mr. Georgios Iacovou, to be relevant. The former
Minister of Foreign Affairs, and signatory of the BIT for Cyprus, stated that “[i]n

this sense, ‘seat’ means the seat of the legal person, the registered office, the
physical location of a company where it can be visited, where service can be
made”.!°° The Arbitral Tribunal therefore accepts that the meaning of the term
“seat” must be understood to have been a reference to an actual location, place or
address. Thus, in the Arbitral Tribunal’s view the equivalent of this condition under
Cypriot law is the registered office of an entity.

Section 102 of the Cypriot Companies Law requires a registered office in Cyprus
“to which all communications and notices may be addressed”.!*! The registered
office of a company serves various purposes, including serving as the place where
the company shall keep: the register of holder of debentures; !*? every instrument
creating any charge requiring registration or any mortgage requiring recording;'**
the register of its members;'*4 the book containing the minutes of proceedings of
any general meeting; '** the books of account;!*° and the register of its directors and
secretaries, !57

The Arbitral Tribunal finds the Claimant’s certificates issued by the relevant
authorities in Cyprus confirming its registered office located at Arch. Makariou IIT
66, Kronos Court, Ist floor, Office 12, 1770 Nicosia, Cyprus, to be conclusive
evidence for the existence of its registered office.'8 Furthermore, based on the
additional submitted evidence, the Arbitral Tribunal can only draw the conclusion
that the relevant criteria for a registered office are met in this case.!*°

The Arbitral Tribunal does not accept the “requirements” established by the
majority in CEAC.'*° The additional conditions applied by the majority in the
CEAC case went beyond assessment of the confirmation of a registered office by
the relevant authorities, to also include inquiry into: (i) the existence of physical
premises, (ii) a lease or license to use the premises, (iii) accessibility of the premises
for at least two hours per day, (iv) the keeping of books and registers, and (v) the
company’s name affixed to the outside of the building. The present Arbitral
Tribunal agrees with the position taken by Prof. William W. Park in CEAC, that
this test “finds no support in either domestic or international law” and that the
“Ta]doption of that standard would require arbitrators to assume a policy-making
mission in excess of their authority.” !*!

Decision on Jurisdiction

In any event, even if the Arbitral Tribunal were to accept the test established by the
majority in CEAC, these requirements are considered to be fulfilled in the present
case since the factual elements of the Claimant’s case are quite different than the
ones of claimant in CEAC. The evidence establishes that the Claimant has a
physical presence at the indicated address where it exercises some right of use.'4?
As noted earlier, the Claimant’s physical presence at its registered office has also
been confirmed by the Claimant’s expert Mr. Alecos Markides, on whose
instructions his associate lawyer made an unannounced visit to the Claimant’s
premises, took pictures of the facilities, and inspected the company documents
available for public viewing. '7

Lastly, the Arbitral Tribunal turns to the Respondent’s arguments relating to the use
of the term “seat” or (edra in Greek) in the Cypriot Companies Law. According to
the Respondent, since the Cypriot Companies Law refers both to the term for “seat”,
as well as the term for “registered office”, the two cannot be the same, but rather
the concept of seat must be understood as a distinct concept from that of a registered
office. '*4 The Arbitral Tribunal finds this variance irrelevant as it is due to the fact
that the term seat is essentially a concept of civil law tradition that does not have its
origins in Cypriot law.'*5 The Arbitral Tribunal therefore reconfirms its
interpretation that a registered office according to Cypriot law best lends itself to
the meaning of seat as used in the BIT.'4°

Worthy of noting in this context is that according to the Respondent, the concept of
seat under Cypriot law is included in various provisions of Cypriot Companies law
which govern issues such as transfer of company seat from abroad to Cyprus.!47
Remarkably in the present case the Claimant undertook such re-domiciliation from
Netherlands Antilles to Cyprus in 2009.'48 The legal opinion of Ioannides
Demetriou law offices on the “Re-Domiciliation of Foreign Companies into
Cyprus” speaks of the “[t]ransfer of a company’s ‘seat of incorporation’”.'4? The
proxy and waiver of notice executed in support of the transfer, state that the purpose
of the document was “[t]o approve the conversion of the [Claimant] into a company
under Cypriot Law, as per the date that all formalities required to effectuate such
conversion have been met and to Transfer the [Claimant’s] seat from Curacao, the
Netherlands Antilles to the Republic of Cyprus.” !>° The extract from the Netherland
Antilles’ register also states that “[...] according to a statement filed April 3, 2009,
it was resolved to transfer the statutory seat of the corporation to the Republic of

Cyprus”.!>! The Arbitral Tribunal accepting, as the Respondent has, that the term
seat as included in the Cyprus Companies Act concerning the re-domiciliation of
companies from abroad to Cyprus is the same as the definition of seat as contained
in the BIT, arrives at the conclusion that the Claimant has its seat in Cyprus since it
is undisputed that the Claimant validly redomiciled from the Netherlands Antilles
to Cyprus by application of said legislation.

Whether the Claimant can be considered as “making investments in the
territory of” Serbia?

1.3.1) | The Respondent’s position

98. The Respondent takes the position that the Claimant’s investment is the purchase
of PZP shares, and the later incorporation of Serbian entity Mera Invest, where the
Claimant contributed a large portion of its PZP shares as Mera Invest’s founding
capital.'°* According to the Respondent, since these activities took place in 2006
and 2008 respectively, and since at the time of these events the Claimant was a
Netherlands Antilles’ company, the Claimant cannot be regarded as an investor
within the meaning of Article 1(3)(b) of the BIT as the Claimant was not “making”
the investments as a company incorporated in Cyprus. !*

99. The Respondent asserts that in order to benefit from protection under the BIT, the
Claimant must be a protected investor at the time it makes its investment. '** For the
Respondent, the conditions for an “investor” as set out in Article 1(3)(b) of the BIT
are not only cumulative but must occur “at the same time”.'*> According to the
Respondent, “the phrase ‘making investments’ denotes an act of investing, which
is actually performed [...] and not future or to completed investments.” !*° For the
Respondent the nationality of the investor cannot be decoupled from the moment
or period in which the investment was made. '°7

 

100. The Respondent’s objection to jurisdiction based on the third condition of
Article 1(3)(b) of the BIT is qualified. The Respondent appears to accept the
fulfillment of this criteria to the extent the Claimant made investments in Serbia
after its relocation to Cyprus. '**

C-012 (emphasis added); see also Shareholder Resolution dated 11 November 2011, by which the Claimant's
shareholder put on record that it approved “the transfer of the seat of the company which will continue its corporate
existence under the Laws of the Republic of Cyprus” (C-008) (emphasis added).

made by an investor in the sense of Article 1(3)(b) of the BIT and, consequently, only this contribution is the protected

Decision on Jurisdiction

The Respondent also argues that based on Article 12 of the BIT the investment
treaty shall apply “to investments made by investors of one Contracting Party prior
to as well as after the date of the entry into force of this Agreement”, and that since
in its view the Claimant’s investment was not “made by” an investor of one
Contracting Party, the BIT is not applicable. '*?

1.3.2) — The Claimant’s position

The Claimant submits that there is no requirement under the BIT which mandates
that an investor only qualifies as such if it is a company registered in Cyprus at the
time of making of the investment.!°

Notwithstanding, the Claimant argues that the holding and managing of assets
qualifies as “making investments” under the BIT.'*! For the Claimant, ongoing
activities must also be protected under the BIT so that a restructuring, such as the
transfer of the seat from the Netherlands Antilles to Cyprus, does not divest an
investor of protection.'® The Claimant argues that this interpretation results from
the words “[...] and maintain favourable conditions” of the preamble of the BIT.'®

 

The Claimant also submits that its investments did not stop with establishing Mera
Invest, but that the Claimant after moving to Cyprus, has been “making
investments” through Mera Invest right until the Respondent’s measures forced the
investments to lay dormant.!

The Claimant contends that as per Article 12 of the BIT, the BIT applies to cause
of action that arose after the treaty’s entry into force, i.e. after 23 December 2005.'°
Thus, in the Claimant’s view, what is relevant for jurisdiction ratione temporis is
that the Claimant had the nationality of a Cyprus entity at the time of consent, which
is commonly equated with the time when the dispute arises.'°° The Claimant
highlights the fact that the nationality change of the Claimant took place years
before the dispute had arisen. !°”

1.3.3) — The Arbitral Tribunal’s findings

To the extent that there is a requirement of activity when determining the status of
an investor — of which the Arbitral Tribunal is not convinced — the Arbitral Tribunal
considers that this is satisfied in the present case.

qualified investors enjoy the treaty’s protection. So, consequently, if Claimant proves its case, it may claim damages
only in proportion to the value of its presented investment in [Mera Invest]: that is 14% of its equity.”

Decision on Jurisdiction

In the Arbitral Tribunal’s view, “making investments” comprises more than the
funding and acquisition of investments, but as well, the holding and management
of investments. This is derived from the object and purpose of the BIT to provide
broad investment protection,'® as well as an ordinary reading of Article 1(3)(b) of
the BIT. It is evident that the Claimant actively held and managed the investments
after it became a Cyprus entity,'® thereby “making investments” in Serbia as
required by Article 1(3)(b) of the BIT.

The BIT expressly provides that “[a] change in the form in which assets are invested
or reinvested shall not affect their character as investments”.!”° Accordingly, in the
Arbitral Tribunal’s view, the BIT provides broad investment and investor protection
so that the rights and interests regarding an investment should remain intact even
with a change in the form in which they are held, i.e. even with a re-domiciliation
of the investor.

Similarly, in PSEG Global v. Turkey, where two investment vehicles bought a claim
against Turkey, the tribunal supported a finding that “whatever rights or interests
the branch office had [regarding the investment] were transferred to [the investment
vehicles]” and that “[bJecause of this continuity”, the “jurisdiction of the Tribunal

is therefore not affected [by] the change of corporate structure”.!7!

The Arbitral Tribunal considers that the continuity of entities is even more prevalent
in the current case where the Claimant remained the same entity that made the
investment but with a later change in domicile. Where changes in corporate
structure should not alter the rights in an investment, so should it also be the case
where there is no successor in law and business, but in fact the same entity involved.
Cypriot law allows the transfer of a company seat from abroad to Cyprus without
the need to liquidate the former company and transfer their assets and liability to a
newly incorporated Cyprus company.!”? Thus, factually-speaking the ownership of
the investment never changed. The Claimant, although having moved from the
Netherlands Antilles to Cyprus, remained the same legal entity that made the
investment in Mera Invest. Thus, the Arbitral Tribunal concludes that the third
condition of Article 1(3)(b) of the BIT is satisfied in the present case.

Whether the Claimant meets the jurisdictional requirements of “investment”
as defined by Article 1(1) of the BIT (jurisdiction ratione materiae)?

The Respondent’s position

The Respondent contends that the assets of Mera Invest (as opposed to the
Claimant’s share in Mera Invest) do not fall under the definition of investment in
Article 1 BIT because they are not assets that were invested by a protected investor,

even if one were to assume the Claimant is a protected investor under the BIT (quod

Thus, while the Respondent accepts the Arbitral Tribunal’s jurisdiction over claims
relating to the alleged impairment of the value of the Claimant’s shares in Mera
Invest,'”* the Respondent submits that the Arbitral Tribunal lacks jurisdiction
ratione materiae over any claims that arise from the rights in assets held by the
Claimant’s subsidiary Mera Invest.'7°

The Respondent asserts that according to generally accepted principles and rules of
international law, a distinction must be drawn between a shareholder, on the one
hand, and the company and the company’s assets, on the other hand.'”° According
to the Respondent, the Claimant as a shareholder does not have standing to directly
pursue claims concerning the assets of its subsidiary, since, from the Respondent’s
perspective, only Mera Invest has standing to pursue such claims.

In support of its position, the Respondent argues that the BIT does not expressly
allow shareholders to file claims on behalf of their companies. !7” Furthermore, the
Respondent cautions that there would be a risk of double recovery in the present
case if the Arbitral Tribunal were to allow the Claimant to seek damages over Mera
Invest’s assets in addition to the alleged diminution in the value of its shares in
Mera Invest. !78

The Claimant’s position

According to the Claimant, the present arbitration concerns the direct and indirect
investments made by the Claimant in Serbia. Specifically, the Claimant submits that
“the present dispute arises out of:

-  Claimant’s 100% share in Mera Invest, i.e. direct investments, and

- Reinvestment of proceeds from the sale of PZP Shares, done in the form of
Mera Invest, i.e. indirect investments, in particular:

The Claimant maintains that the BIT definition of investment certainly covers all
of the Claimant’s investments in Serbia, both direct (i.e. shares in a company) and
indirect (i.e. the investments made through a local subsidiary).'*° According to the
Claimant, this finding flows from the broad definition of investment in Article 1(1)
of the BIT; the BIT’s preamble; the alteration of form clause in Article 1(1) of the
BIT; and established treaty practice, with other BITs expressly excluding indirect
investments from their protections. !*!

In any event, according to the Claimant it does not seek compensation for assets of
Mera Invest, but rather seeks compensation for the impairment of its shares in Mera
Invest. !*? In the Claimant’s view, the value of its 100% interest in Mera Invest is,
by definition, equal to the value of Mera Invest’s assets. Thus, the Claimant submits
that any loss suffered by Mera Invest as a result of the Respondent’s measures leads
to an equal impairment of the value of the Claimant’s shares. '*? For the Claimant,
the valuation of its equity interest in Mera Invest requires the valuation of Mera
Invest, or rather, Mera Invest’s businesses and prospects. '§+

The Arbitral Tribunal’s findings

In the present case, the Parties agree that the Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction to
hear claims concerning the alleged diminution of the value of the Claimant’s
shareholding in Mera Invest arising from the measures taken by Serbia against Mera
Invest.'*° The Claimant submits that this is “precisely what Claimant claims” and
that the Respondent’s qualified jurisdictional objection is based on a
misconstruction of the Claimant’s case.'*® It would appear that insofar as the
Claimant seeks compensation for the impairment of its shares in Mera Invest, the
Parties submit to the Arbitral Tribunal’s jurisdiction and there is no objection to
jurisdiction rationae materiae for the Arbitral Tribunal to decide.

Nonetheless, it may well turn out in the ongoing proceedings on the merits that a
distinction between direct and indirect investments may not always be so clear. It
is therefore appropriate to address jurisdiction also under this extended aspect. To
the extent that the Claimant’s claims may be categorized as claims over the assets
of Mera Invest, the Arbitral Tribunal will now address the issue of whether assets
held by a company (as opposed to its shares) constitute protected investments

pursuant to the BIT in respect to which an investor that is its shareholder may bring
a claim.

The BIT determines the question of protected investments. According to Article 9
of the BIT, only “[d]isputes that may arise between one of the Contracting Parties
and an investor of the other Contracting Party with regard to an investment in the
sense of the present Agreement” are protected.'*” Pursuant to Article 1(1) of the
governing BIT, the term investment shall mean:

“every kind of asset invested by an investor of one Contracting Party in the
territory of the other Contracting Party in accordance with the laws and
regulations of the latter and in particular, though not exclusively, shall
include:

a) movable and immovable property and any other rights in rem such as
mortgages, liens or pledges;

b) shares, bonds and other kinds of securities;
c) claims to money or other claims under contract having an economic value;
]

A change in the form in which assets are invested or reinvested shall not affect
their character as investments, provided that such a change does not contradict
the laws and regulations of the Contracting Party in the territory of which the
investments were made.” !88

 

According to the Vienna Convention “[a] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in
accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their
context and in light of its object and purpose.” '*? Due consideration of the preamble
to the BIT is relevant to determine the BIT’s object and purpose and the scope of
the protected investment.

In the present case, the preamble of the BIT states inter alia that the contracting
parties entered into the BIT with the desire “to create favourable conditions for
greater economic cooperation between the Contracting Parties” and “to create and
maintain favourable conditions for reciprocal investments”.'°° The Arbitral
Tribunal considers this language to support a reading of the BIT, which is a treaty
concerning “the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments”,'?! to
provide broad investment protection.

123. Tribunals interpreting similarly worded preambles also found that they foster broad
investment protection. 192 Ror instance, in the SGS Société Générale de Surveillance
S.A. v. Republic of the Philippines case, where the preamble of the bilateral
agreement between the Swiss Confederation and the Republic of the Philippines
confirms that the treaty is intended “to create and maintain favourable conditions
for investments by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the
other”,!® the tribunal found that “[iJt is legitimate to resolve uncertainties in its
interpretation so as to favour the protection of covered investments.” !*4

124. Similarly, in the Telefonica S.A. v. The Argentine Republic case, where the
preamble of the bilateral investment treaty between the Argentine Republic and the
Kingdom of Spain states that the parties “intend to establish favorable conditions
for the investments carried out by investors of each party in the territory of the other
one”,'®> the tribunal found that “[d]isregard of the actual treatment of the company
representing the investment, by removing it from the [bilateral investment treaty’s]
coverage, would therefore require a restrictive interpretation of the [bilateral
investment treaty’s] terms contrary to its object and purpose.”!°°

125. The Arbitral Tribunal considers that the object and the purpose of the BIT to protect
an investment regardless of the form and change in the form in which the investment
is held is also expressly reflected in the text of the BIT. Article 1(1) of the BIT
provides that “[a] change in the form in which assets are invested or reinvested shall
not affect their character as investments”.!®’ Thus, according to the Arbitral
Tribunal’s reading of this clause, an investor is free to choose the form of its
investment, be it direct or indirect; and to change its form at a later stage, in order
to invest or reinvest the proceeds.

126. The BIT also adopts a broad asset-based definition of investment with an open-
ended illustrative list of covered assets. The definition of investment is framed in
the broadest terms to include “every kind of asset”. The specific categories of
investment included in the definition are listed as examples rather than with the
purpose of excluding those not mentioned. The definition of investment as provided

in the BIT focus on what is to be protected, i.e., “the fruits and values generated by
the investment”. '°*

127. The definition of “investment” contained in Article 1(1) of the BIT is silent as to
whether the investor’s ownership over the protected investment, is direct or indirect.
There is also nothing in the language of Article 1(1) of the BIT which would
preclude a finding that the Claimant can bring a claim in respect to underlying assets
of its subsidiary. The fact that the BIT does not expressly anticipate such claims
does not suggest that such claims should be excluded.

128. Notably, where the Respondent wished to exclude indirect investment from the
scope of protection, it did so with express language in other investment treaties it
negotiated. For example, the bilateral Agreement between Serbia and the
Government of the Republic of Azerbaijan on the Promotion and Reciprocal
Protection of Investments defines investment as “every kind of assets established
or acquired directly by an investor of one Contracting Party in the state territory of
the other Contracting Party [...]”.'°? In the same way, the bilateral Agreement
between the Government of the Republic of Turkey and Serbia Concerning the
Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments provides that the term
investment “shall refer to all direct investments made in accordance with the laws
and regulations in the territory of the Party where the investments are made”.

129. It is in fact not unusual that an investor, who wants to make an investment abroad,
uses a company as a vehicle, thereby investing in the host country. The tribunal in
EURAM vy. Slovak Republic, in interpreting an equally broad definition of
investment,””! held that “[t]his is broad language which is quite wide enough to
encompass what is today the very common situation of a foreign company making
an investment through a subsidiary incorporated in the host State.”

130. Other tribunals when faced with the similar issue have supported the principle that
where a company is controlled, legally or factually, by a certain shareholder or
group of shareholders, the latter may be entitled to a direct claim in respect of the

assets of the former.”°? Accordingly, in situations where a shareholder controls the
company that owns the assets in issue, tribunals may consider those underlying
assets to be the investments of the shareholder.

131.

In the von Pezold v. Zimbabwe case, the tribunal recognized that “[t]his principle —
that where a company is controlled, legally or factually, by a certain shareholder or
group of shareholders, the latter may be entitled to a direct claim in respect of the
assets of the former — has, as the von Pezold Claimants submit, since gained
currency in investment treaty arbitration,” and that there may be instances where an
individual who makes his investments through a company might be regarded as a
de facto investor. 7°

132. The tribunal in Azurix v. Argentina also recognized that “even where a foreign
investor is not the actual legal owner of the assets constituting an investment [...]
that foreign investor may nonetheless have a financial or other commercial interest
in that investment. This is so, irrespective of whether the actual legal owner of the
assets [...] is a wholly or partly owned subsidiary of the investor [...].”?°° As to the
separate legal personalities and legal obligations, the tribunal in Azurix confirmed
that “[a]n investment protection treaty having this effect does not alter the legal
nature of the investor’s interest nor that of the legal owner of the investment, nor
does it ignore the separate legal personalities and separate legal rights and
obligations of the shareholder and the company. Rather, it merely ensures that
whatever interest, legal or otherwise, that the investor does have will be accorded
certain protections.”?°°

133. In the Telefonica case, when interpreting a similarly broad “every kind of asset”
definition of investment,” the tribunal held that the investor’s rights were not
limited to the mere title to the shareholding in the local subsidiary, but that the
tribunal was competent “‘to entertain claims that measures affecting the legal regime
of [the local subsidiary’s] operations have breached [the shareholder’ s] rights under
the [bilateral investment treaty].”?°° The Telefénica tribunal found that “in case of
an acquisition by an investor of one Contracting Party of the entire capital of a
company of the other Party, treaty protection is not limited to the free enjoyment of

the shares, that is the exercise of the rights inherent in the position of a shareholder.
It also extends to the standards of protection spelled out in the [bilateral investment
treaty] with regard to the operation of the local company that constitutes the
investment.”

134. In the present case, the Claimant not only invested in its subsidiary Mera Invest, but
also through its wholly owned and controlled subsidiary.?!° The Respondent’s
argument that the Clamant was not required under Serbian law to establish a local
company in order to invest,?!! even if accepted, does not change the fact that the

Claimant made investments which are eligible for protection by setting up a local

company through which it invested in Serbia.*! Furthermore, the Arbitral Tribunal

is not convinced by the Respondent’s arguments that Mera Invest is not controlled
by the Claimant and that the Arbitral Tribunal should by some means look through
the Claimant’s entity structure to the ultimate shareholder of the Claimant.?!*

135. Based on the foregoing, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that the assets held by the local
company, Mera Invest, constitute protected investments pursuant to the BIT, in
respect to which the Claimant as its shareholder may bring claims not only for the
impairment of the value of its shares in its subsidiary, but also for the impairment
of its subsidiary’s assets.

Decision on Jurisdiction

BIT is the “stimulation of entrepreneurial initiative leading to development of
economic relations between Serbia and Cyprus.”?!”

The Respondent contends that the Claimant’s activities in no way stimulated
entrepreneurial initiatives in Serbia or contributed to a greater economic
cooperation between Cyprus and Serbia since, according to the Respondent, the
Claimant is fully owned and controlled by Serbian nationals which utilize funds
obtained in Serbia for its investment in Serbia.?!*

The Respondent submits that “economic cooperation between Serbia and Cyprus
[...] can only benefit from investments made in Serbia which have their origin in
Cyprus (and vice versa)”.*!? For the Respondent, “[nJo furthering of economic
relations between Serbia and Cyprus can occur in a situation where a Serbian
national makes an investment into Serbia in a round-trip manner.”””° The
Respondent focuses on the fact that, in its view, “it was the capital of a Serbian
businessman which originated from business activities in Serbia that Claimant used
to make its investment.””?!

In addition, the Respondent further argues that the “entire business undertaking that
is the subject of these proceedings is an entrepreneurial undertaking of Mr. Miroslav
Miskovic, a Serbian businessman” and that there “was absolutely no entrepreneurial

involvement of Cypriot nationals in said business undertaking”.???

The Respondent claims that allowing jurisdiction in this case would be another
confirmation that the abuse of bilateral investment treaties is becoming more
prevalent, since in the present case the Claimant has no connection to Cyprus and
its end-owners are Serbian.”?? The Respondent cites the Saluka case, cautioning
against treaty shopping through shell companies.?7*

The Claimant’s position

The Claimant submits that the object and purpose of the BIT is to be interpreted
with reference to both the full text of the preamble and the text of the BIT, both of
which support broad investment protection. ??°

The Claimant maintains that on a plain reading of the entire preamble, the object
and purpose of the BIT is to, first and foremost, “create favorable conditions for
investments, and to promote and protect them; in turn, this promotion and
protection should then contribute to enhancing entrepreneurial initiative and

economic relations.”?”° Furthermore, the Claimant submits that arbitral practice
interpreting similar preambles support interpreting the object and purpose of the
BIT to provide broad protection of investors and their investments.

The Claimant also argues that the BIT does not require that the investor itself
contribute to enhancing entrepreneurial initiative and economic relations.””’ For the
Claimant, the mentioning of these terms in the preamble of the BIT “was merely
the result that the Parties believed [...] might be achieved by their promise to
promote and protect investments.”??8

According to the Claimant, there is also nothing in the text of the BIT, including its
preamble, which would contain any reference or requirement regarding the origin
of the funds invested.”? In the Claimant’s view, introducing such a requirement
would be impermissible, and given the BIT’s broad protective purpose, inconsistent
with its object and purpose.?*?

The Arbitral Tribunal’s findings

As established in the above sections, the Arbitral Tribunal considers the object and
purpose of the BIT to be broader than the Respondent contends.”*! This
understanding is supported by the text of the BIT, including its preamble.”

The Contracting States of the BIT had complete freedom of choice and they chose
to limit treaty protection to those qualifying as investors according to Article 1(3)(b)
of the BIT, and investments pursuant to Article 1(1) of the BIT. Although the
preamble of the BIT refers to “economic cooperation between the Contracting
Parties” and “favourable conditions for reciprocal investments”, the above
provisions of the BIT fall silent as to any specific requirements of a stimulation of
entrepreneurial initiative or development of economic relations between
Contracting States. In addition, the BIT contains no requirement that the capital
used by the investor to make its investment originate in the place of the investor, or
that such capital not originate from the place of investment. If the Arbitral Tribunal
were to now interpret the BIT to include these additional conditions, as the
Respondent suggests, it would be disregarding what the Contracting States have
expressly agreed. A requirement that the origin of the capital is decisive for the
international character of an investment cannot be read into the provisions of the
BIT.

As elaborated in the Saluka case, “the predominant factor which must guide the
Tribunal’s exercise of its functions is the terms in which the parties to the Treaty
now in question have agreed to establish the Tribunal’s jurisdiction [...] that means

the terms in which they have agreed upon who is an investor who may become a
claimant entitled to invoke the Treaty’s arbitration procedures.”?*? Similarly, in
Veteran Petroleum Limited (Cyprus) v. Russian Federation, the tribunal confirmed
that it “cannot in effect impose upon the parties a definition of ‘Investment’ other
than that which the parties to the [treaty], including Respondent, have agreed.”?*4

149. It is reiterated time and again by investment tribunals that “it is not for tribunals to
impose limits on the scope of [bilateral investment treaties] not found in the text,
much less limits nowhere evident from the negotiating history. An international
tribunal of defined jurisdiction should not reach out to exercise a jurisdiction
beyond the borders of the definition. But equally an international tribunal should
exercise, and indeed is bound to exercise, the measure of jurisdiction with which it
is endowed.”°5

150. Thus, in light of the foregoing, the Arbitral Tribunal is reluctant to read into the BIT
additional requirements which conflict with its object and purpose and chosen
definitions of investor and investment.

151. Furthermore, the Respondent’s insinuation that the Claimant has engaged in some
sort of treaty shopping fails. As set out above, the Claimant had been incorporated
in the Netherlands Antilles in May 2006 and established Mera Invest in
September 2008.7%° In November 2008, the Claimant initiated its seat transfer to
Cyprus, which was completed by March 2009.73” In January 2010, the Claimant
contributed its remaining 6.59% shareholding in PZP Nis to Mera Invest.?**
Thereafter, Mera Invest purchased shares in Serbian banks, offered fixed-term RSD
deposits and made investments into related and non-related Serbian entities.>*?
According to the Claimant’s case, from early 2013 until the present the Respondent
adopted a number of measures against Mera Invest.7*°

152. On the basis of the foregoing timeline, there cannot be any suspicion of treaty
shopping by the Claimant, since the Claimant’s decision to move from the
Netherlands Antilles to Cyprus was taken in late 2008, and the Respondent’s actions
which form the basis of the Claimant’s case took place four years later. Tribunals
have found that an investor will not qualify for the protection of the BIT concerned
only if the nationality is changed after the dispute has arisen or “when the relevant

party can see an actual dispute or can foresee a specific future dispute as a very high
probability and not merely as a possible controversy.””“! This is not the case here.

153. In any event, even if, as the Respondent suggests, the Claimant’s sole aim had been
to seek investment protection, this would in the view of the Arbitral Tribunal still
be irrelevant. To structure an investment with the aim to seek protection of a BIT is
not per se in breach of the good faith expected of an investor. It is “not uncommon
in practice, and — absent a particular limitation — not illegal to locate one’s
operations in a jurisdiction perceived to provide a beneficial regulatory and legal
environment in terms, for examples [sic], of taxation or the substantive law of the
jurisdiction, including the availability of a [bilateral investment treaty].”?4

154. To prevent forum shopping, the Respondent could have included a “denial of
benefits” provision in the BIT requiring the investing company to have substantive
business activities in Cyprus in order to qualify under the BIT. Alternatively, the
Contracting States could have insisted that a corporate investor have “real economic
activities” in the country in which it is located, as they each did in their respective
investment treaties with Iran’? and Switzerland™., It is not for the Arbitral Tribunal
to now insert such restrictions which are absent from the BIT.

4) Whether granting jurisdiction would go against the object and purpose of the
ICSID Convention?

4.1) The Respondent’s position

155. Inits Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction, the Respondent argues that the Arbitral
Tribunal lacks jurisdiction under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. According to
the Respondent, when assessing jurisdiction “what must first be examined is
whether jurisdiction exists under ICSID Convention, and only if it does, would a
further analysis be conducted by assessing the provisions contained in the relevant
BIT (or a multilateral treaty)”.?45

156. In its discussion of the requirements of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention the
Respondent looks to what it considers to be the object and purpose of the ICSID
Convention. In the Respondent’s view the ICSID Convention “applies to and
concerns investments which are of an international character — that is, foreign

investments made by foreign investors”.?4° The Respondent submits that when
assessing “whether an investment is of domestic or of foreign character, two
elements are crucial — (i) the origin of capital and (ii) effective control of the
investment” .**” It is the Respondent’s case that foreign investments must entail the
flow of foreign capital into the host state, and that in the present case the invested
capital originated in the host state, and therefore does not have foreign character.”4*

 

157. In its later pleading, the Respondent submits that the ICSID Convention sets the
outer limits to jurisdiction, and while these limits are hard to define, in the absence
of explicitly stated criteria, and through a process of interpretation, the object and
purpose of the ICISD Convention must be considered.”4? According to the
Respondent, when defining the outer limits of the ICSID Convention, the criteria
espoused by Professor Weil in his dissenting opinion in Tokios Tokelés v. Ukraine
— control and origin of capital, are both reasonable and understandable, as they are
in line with the object and purpose of ICSID Convention.”°°

158. Relying on the Report of the Executive Directors on the ICSID Convention, the
Respondent argues that the object and purpose of ICSID Convention is “to stimulate
inter-state partnership in cause of economic development and to stimulate flow of
international capital.”**! For the Respondent, the ICSID Convention strives to
stimulate foreign investments — to incentivize investors from one country to invest
their capital in other countries, and does so by establishing a dispute settlement
mechanism which is meant to give recourse to foreign investors, as opposed to
domestic ones.”>?

159. The Respondent claims that regarding the Claimant’s case, the true investor cannot
be the Claimant, as it is only an instrumentality of the actual investor, a Serbian
national.”°? The Respondent submits that since in the present case the origin of the
capital is Serbian, and the effective control over the investment is Serbian, there is
no foreign investor or foreign investment as required by the ICSID Convention, and
thus the Claimant lacks jurisdiction. Thus, according to the Respondent if the
Arbitral Tribunal were to confirm jurisdiction in this case it would go against the
object and purpose of the ICSID Convention.

160. The Respondent urges that when assessing its jurisdiction, the Arbitral Tribunal
should look at actual relationships, and not formal appearances.?** The Respondent

warns that an overly rigid and formal approach to assessing the jurisdictional
criteria under the ICSID Convention may open the door to possibility of abuses.”°>

The Claimant’s position

The Claimant submits that all jurisdictional requirements under the ICSID
Convention are met.?*° According to the Claimant, the Respondent’s interpretation
of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention as limiting (instead of expanding)
jurisdiction has been uniformly rejected by doctrine and tribunal practice.?*”

In the Claimant’s view, the ICSID Convention does not set forth any requirements
for origin of capital or effective control.?°* Citing the tribunal in the Rompetrol case,
the Claimant argues that the criteria espoused by Professor Weil in his dissenting
opinion in Tokios Tokelés “[have] not been widely approved in the academic and
professional literature, or generally adopted by subsequent tribunals”, and that
“Tany] Tribunal would in any case have a great difficulty in an approach that was
tantamount to setting aside the clear language agreed upon by the treaty Parties in
favour of a wide-ranging policy discussion. Such approach could not be reconciled
with Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.”7*°

The Claimant also argues that the Respondent’s narrow interpretation of the object
and purpose of the ICSID Convention “is simply incorrect.” According to the
Claimant, based on the ICSID Convention’s preamble and text,2°! the object and
purpose of the convention is to “establish an investor-state dispute settlement
center, in an effort to contribute to a favorable investment climate”.”©? The Claimant
argues that the ICSID Convention is not an attempt to develop substantive rules for
the protection of private investments, but rather an effort to improve the investment
environment by offering a procedural framework for the settlement of disputes.7°
According to the Claimant, the ICSID Convention accepts the contracting States

freedom to define their own requirements for ICSID jurisdiction, which a tribunal
should then defer to.?*

Decision on Jurisdiction

4.3) The Arbitral Tribunal’s findings

165. The Arbitral Tribunal accepts that based on the preamble”® and text? of the ICSID
Convention, the object of the treaty is to promote economic development through
the creation of a favorable investment climate.”°”

166.

a

Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention provides that “[t]he jurisdiction of the
Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment,
between a Contracting State [...] and a national of another Contracting State, which

the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre”.

167. In Abaclat v. Argentina, the tribunal clarified that the criteria developed by a
number of arbitral tribunals with regard to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and
the definitions of investment contained in bilateral investment treaties often do not
coincide because “they can be said to focus each on a different aspect of the
investment, i.e., they each look at the investment from a different perspective.”
The Abaclat tribunal went on to state that “[t]he two perspectives can be viewed to
be complementary, and to merely reflect a two-folded approach of the [bilateral
investment treaty]and the ICSID Convention towards investment: At first, it is
about encouraging investments, i.e., creating the frame conditions to encourage
foreign investors to make certain contributions, and once such contributions are
made, it is about protecting the fruits and value generated by these contributions.”?””

168. Article 25 of the ICSID Convention is silent on definitions of several key terms —
including what is to be understood by investor and investment. Indeed, contracting
parties are given the widest possible latitude to determine the extent of their consent
to ICSID jurisdiction. Undeniably, the “[c]onsent of the parties is the cornerstone
of the jurisdiction of the Center”.?”!

169. If the Arbitral Tribunal were to accept the Respondent’s arguments that the ICSID
Convention sets the outer limits of jurisdiction, and that such outer limits should be

the role of private international investment therein; [blearing in mind the possibility that from time to time disputes
may arise in connection with such investment between Contracting States and nationals of other Contracting Stat
[...]; [a]ttaching particular importance to the availability of facilities for international conciliation or arbitration [,
[dlesiring to establish such facilities [...]”.

ICSID Convention, Article 1(2) of the ICSID Convention states that “The purpose of the Centre shall be to provide
facilities for conciliation and arbitration of investment disputes [...]”.

Decision on Jurisdiction

understood to contain requirements pertaining to the origin of capital and effective
control of the investment, the Arbitral Tribunal would override the Contracting
Parties’ explicit choice on how to define the nationality of an investor and the scope
of investments covered under the BIT. The Arbitral Tribunal is reluctant to do so.

170. In the Arbitral Tribunal’s view, the ICSID Convention contains no requirement that
the capital used by the investor to make its investment originate from the place of
the investor, or that such capital cannot originate from the place of investment.

171.

Other ICSID tribunals have come to a similar finding. Notably, the majority in
Tokios Tokelés found that “the ICSID Convention does not require an ‘investment’
to be financed from capital of any particular origin” and that “the origin of the
capital used to acquire [the] assets is not relevant to the question of jurisdiction
under the Convention.”?” The tribunal in Tokios Tokelés goes on to further state
that “the ICSID Convention contains no inchoate requirement that the investment
at issue in a dispute have an international character in which the origin of the capital
is decisive.”?7

172. Similarly, the tribunal in von Pezold also confirmed that “[t]here is no origin of
capital requirement in the [bilateral investment treaties] or under the ICSID
Convention.”?” As did, the tribunal in the Lemire v. Ukraine case “[...] neither the
[bilateral investment treaty] nor the ICSID Convention includes an origin-of-capital
requirement. Nor is such a requirement to be inferred from the purposes of the
[bilateral investment treaty] and/or the ICSID Convention.”?”>

173. In addition, foreign effective control of the investment is not a criterion provided
for under the ICSID Convention to determine nationality. There is no basis in the
ICSID Convention to set aside the agreed definition of nationality contained in
Article 1(3) of the BIT, in favor of a test based on the nationality of the ultimate
beneficiary of the Claimant.?”°

174. When faced with a similar question, the ICSID tribunal in Caratube v. Kazakhstan
came to the same finding. The tribunal held that “[t]here can be no dispute that the
wording of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention does not specify the required
form and extent of foreign control and, more specifically, does not expressly require
actual, effective control, rather than legal control.”?77

Decision on Jurisdiction

175. The tribunal in the Tokios Tokelés case found that “[t]he use of a control-test to
define the nationality of a corporation to restrict the jurisdiction of the Centre would
be inconsistent with the object and purpose of Article 25(2)(b) [...] the purpose of
the control-test in the second portion of Article 25(2)(b) is to expand the jurisdiction
of the Centre.”?”* The tribunal in Tokios Tokelés went on to state that
“Article 25(2)(b) does not mandatorily constrict ICSID jurisdiction for disputes
arising in the inverse context from the one envisaged by this provision: a dispute
between a Contracting Party and an entity of another Contracting Party that is
controlled by nationals of the respondent Contracting Party”.?” Similarly, the
tribunal in Wena Hotels v. Egypt found that “the literature rather convincingly
demonstrates” that Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention is meant to expand
ICSID jurisdiction.?°°

176. Based on the foregoing, in the Arbitral Tribunal’s view, accepting jurisdiction in
the present case would not go against the object and purpose of the ICSID
Convention. The Arbitral Tribunal is of the opinion that its interpretation of the
BIT, and more specifically what is to be understood as investor and investment, are
compatible with the ICSID Convention. The ICSID Convention has set the frame
conditions to encourage foreign investors to make certain contributions, and the
BIT in question sets out the protection of the fruits and values generated by these
contributions.7*!

3) The Arbitral Tribunal’s findings

183. Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention prescribes that “[i]n the case of arbitration
proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the
expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall
decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of
the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid.
Such decision shall form part of the award.”°!

184. ICSID Rule 28(1)(b) gives arbitral tribunals the authority to decide “with respect to
any part of the proceeding, that the related costs (as determined by the Secretary-
General) shall be borne entirely or in a particular share by one of the parties.”?°?

185. The Arbitral Tribunal has decided to defer its decision on the awarding of costs
having arisen in the proceedings so far until the Arbitral Tribunal’s final ruling on
the merits.
