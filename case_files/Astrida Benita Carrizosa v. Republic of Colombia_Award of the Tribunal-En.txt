OVERVIEW OF THE DISPUTE

The present dispute arises out of the Republic of Colombia's fiscal, administrative
and judicial, including the 2014 Order, measures allegedly resulting in the loss of the

Astrida Benita Carrizosa v. Republic of Colombia (\CSID Case No. ARB/18/5)

 

Award

Claimant’s indirect shareholding interests in Granahorrar, a Colombian financial
institution. The Claimant argues that Colombia’s measures violated multiple
provisions of the TPA and claims compensation for damages.

The Respondent disputes the claims. As a preliminary matter, it submits that the
dispute is outside the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. It further explains that its fiscal,
administrative and judicial measures were required to protect the country’s financial
market stability in face of a severe economic crisis, and were thus in line with
Colombia's obligations under international law and the TPA.

REQUESTS FOR RELIEF

The Claimant formulated her final request for relief in respect of jurisdiction in her
Reply on Jurisdiction (“CRU”) as follows:

For the foregoing reasons, authority, premises, and evidence, Claimant,
Astrida Benita Carrizosa, respectfully requests that this Arbitral Tribunal
reject Respondent's, the Republic of Colombia, objections to jurisdiction,
and proceed to a merits hearing in furtherance of the equitable
administration of justice."

On the merits, the Claimant set out her request for relief in the Request for Arbitration
in the following terms:

Reserving its right to amend, supplement, or otherwise restate its claims
and the relief requested in connection with such demand, claimant
request an award granting, without limitation, the following relief:

(i) A declaration that Colombia has violated the Treaties [TPA and
Colombia-Switzerland BIT], customary international law, and Colombian
law with respect to claimant's investments;

(ii) Compensation to claimant for all damages that she has suffered, to
be developed, and quantified in the course of this proceeding, but
including, without limitation, Colombia’s failure to provide claimant and
her investments fair and equitable treatment, national treatment, fair
judicial recourse, and for its arbitrary and discriminatory interference with
claimant's use and enjoyment of its investments;

(iii) Such compensation, exclusive of attorney’s fees and costs must be
no less than USD 40,000,000.

(iv) All costs and fees associated with this proceeding, including all
professional fees and disbursements;

1 CR4J, p. 502.

Astrida Benita Carrizosa v. Republic of Colombia (\CSID Case No. ARB/18/5)

 

Award

(v) An award of compound interest until the date of Colombia’s final
satisfaction of the award at a rate to be fixed by the Tribunal; and

(vi) Such other relief as counsel may advise and the Tribunal may deem
appropriate.”
11. The Respondent formulated its final request for relief in respect of jurisdiction in its
Rejoinder on Jurisdiction (“RRu”) as follows:

For the foregoing reasons, Colombia respectfully requests that the
Tribunal:

a. render an award dismissing Claimant's claims in their entirety, for lack
of jurisdiction; and

b. order Claimant to pay all of Colombia’s costs, including the totality of
the arbitral costs incurred by Colombia in connection with this
proceeding, as well as the totality of Colombia's legal fees and expenses,
plus interest.>

12. The Respondent did not seek relief on the merits.

G. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT

13. The present proceedings are conducted under the ICSID Convention, Article 25 of
which contains a jurisdictional requirement of, inter alia, a written consent of the
parties to the dispute to submit their investment dispute to the jurisdiction of the
International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (the “Centre” or “ICSID”).
While the Claimant has provided her consent in her Request for Arbitration (the
“RFA’),* the Parties dispute whether Colombia has also given its consent to
arbitrate.

14. The Claimant invokes two legal instruments as Colombia’s purported consent to
submit the present dispute to the jurisdiction of the Centre, the US-Colombia Trade
Promotion Agreement (the “TPA’), and in particular its Chapter 12 (Financial
Services), and the Colombia-Switzerland BIT. Article 12.1.2(b) of the TPA reads as
follows:

Section B (Investor-State Dispute Settlement) of Chapter Ten
(Investment) is hereby incorporated into and made a part of this Chapter

2 RFA, para. 225.
3 RRJ, para. 399.
4 RFA, para. 215.

Astrida Benita Carrizosa v. Republic of Colombia (\CSID Case No. ARB/18/5)

 

Award

solely for claims that a Party has breached Articles 10.7 (Expropriation
and Compensation), 10.8 (Transfers), 10.12 (Denial of Benefits), or
10.14 (Special Formalities and Information Requirements), as
incorporated into this Chapter.

15. Pertinent parts of Section B (Investor-State Dispute Settlement) of Chapter Ten

(Investment) of the TPA, in turn, reads as follows:

Section B: Investor-State Dispute Settlement

Article 10.15: Consultation and Negotiation

In the event of an investment dispute, the claimant and the respondent
should initially seek to resolve the dispute through consultation and
negotiation, which may include the use of non-binding, third-party
procedures.

Article 10.16: Submission of a Claim to Arbitration

1. In the event that a disputing party considers that an investment dispute
cannot be settled by consultation and negotiation:

(a) the claimant, on its own behalf, may submit to arbitration under this
Section a claim

(i) that the respondent has breached
(A) an obligation under Section A,
(B) an investment authorization, or
(C) an investment agreement;

and

(ii) that the claimant has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising
out of, that breach; and

(b) the claimant, on behalf of an enterprise of the respondent that is a
juridical person that the claimant owns or controls directly or indirectly,
may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim

(i) that the respondent has breached
(A) an obligation under Section A,
(B) an investment authorization, or
(C) an investment agreement;

and

(ii) that the enterprise has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or
arising out of, that breach,

provided that a claimant may submit pursuant to subparagraph (a)(i)(C)
or (b)(i)(C) a claim for breach of an investment agreement only if the
subject matter of the claim and the claimed damages directly relate to
the covered investment that was established or acquired, or sought to

Astrida Benita Carrizosa v. Republic of Colombia (\CSID Case No. ARB/18/5)

 

Award

be established or acquired, in reliance on the relevant investment
agreement.

2. At least 90 days before submitting any claim to arbitration under this
Section, a claimant shall deliver to the respondent a written notice of its
intention to submit the claim to arbitration (“notice of intent”). The notice
shall specify:

(a) the name and address of the claimant and, where a claim is submitted
on behalf of an enterprise, the name, address, and place of incorporation
of the enterprise;

(b) for each claim, the provision of this Agreement, investment
authorization, or investment agreement alleged to have been breached
and any other relevant provisions;

(c) the legal and factual basis for each claim; and

(d) the relief sought and the approximate amount of damages claimed.
3. Provided that six months have elapsed since the events giving rise to
the claim, a claimant may submit a claim referred to in paragraph 1:

(a) under the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Rules of Procedures for
Arbitration Proceedings, provided that both the respondent and the Party
of the claimant are parties to the ICSID Convention;

(b) under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, provided that either the
respondent or the Party of the claimant is a party to the ICSID
Convention;

(c) under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules; or

(d) if the claimant and respondent agree, to any other arbitration
institution or under any other arbitration rules.

In addition, through the Most-Favored-Nation (“MFN”) clause found in Article 12.3.1
of the TPA, the Claimant purports to invoke Article 11 of the Colombia-Switzerland
BIT as Colombia’s alleged consent to arbitrate. In relevant part, this provision, which
the Claimant quotes in the RFA, has the following content:

(1) If an investor of a Party considers that a measure applied by the other
Party is inconsistent with an obligation of this Agreement, thus
causing loss or damage to him or his investment, he may request
consultations with a view to resolving the matter amicably,

(2) Any such matter which has not been settled within a period of six
months from the date of written request for consultations may be
referred to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Party
concerned or to international arbitration. In the latter event the
investor has the choice between either of the following:

(a) ..the International Centre for Settlement of Investment
Disputes (ICSID) provided for by the Convention on the
Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and

Astrida Benita Carrizosa v. Republic of Colombia (\CSID Case No. ARB/18/5)

 

Award

Nationals of other States, opened for signature at Washington
on March 18, 1965; and

(b) ..an ad hoc-arbitral tribunal which, unless otherwise agreed
upon by the parties to the dispute, shall be established under
the arbitration rules of the United Nations Commission on
International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).

(3) Each Party hereby gives its unconditional and irrevocable consent to
the submission of an investment dispute to an_ international
arbitration in accordance with paragraph 2 above, except for
disputes with regard to Article 10 paragraph 2 of this Agreement.

(4) Once the investor has referred the dispute to either a national tribunal
or any other international arbitration mechanism provided for in
paragraph 2 above, the choice of the procedure shall be final.

(5) An investor may not submit a dispute for resolution according to this
Article if more than five years have elapsed from the date the investor
first acquired or should have acquired knowledge of the events giving
rise to the dispute.

[J
(8) The arbitral award shall be final and binding for the patiies to the
dispute and shall be executed without delay according to the law of the
Party concerned.

17. Article 12.3.1, namely the MFN clause of Chapter 12 of the TPA, which the Claimant

invokes, ® provides as follows:

Each Party shall accord to investors of another Party, financial
institutions of another Party, investments of investors in financial
institutions, and cross-border financial service suppliers of another Party
treatment no less favorable than that it accords to the investors, financial
institutions, investments of investors in financial institutions, and cross-
border financial service suppliers of any other Party or of a non-Party, in
like circumstances.

H. PROCEDURAL RULES

18. This arbitration is governed by the ICSID Convention; any rules of procedure agreed
upon by the Parties; and the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings
(the “ICSID Rules’). If a question of procedure arises which is not covered by the
instruments listed in the preceding sentence, the Tribunal has the power to set a
rule pursuant to Article 44 of the ICSID Convention. Accordingly, the Tribunal has

Award

issued various procedural directions, including, but not limited to, Procedural Orders
Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4.

LAW GOVERNING JURISDICTION

The jurisdiction of the Tribunal is governed under the ICSID Convention, the TPA
and international law.

When applying the law, the Tribunal is not bound by the arguments and sources
invoked by the Parties. The principle of iura novit arbiter allows the Tribunal to form
its own opinion of the meaning of the law, provided that it does not surprise the
Parties with a legal theory that was not subject to debate and that the Parties could
not anticipate.®

RELEVANCE OF PRIOR DECISIONS AND AWARDS.

Both Parties have relied on previous decisions or awards in support of their
positions, either to conclude that the same solution should be adopted in the present
case, or in an effort to explain why this Tribunal should depart from that solution.

The Tribunal considers that it is not bound by prior decisions under any rule of
international law. At the same time, pursuant to the general principles of legal
certainty, the Tribunal must pay due consideration to relevant decisions of
international tribunals. Specifically, subject to the text of the treaty or to compelling
grounds to the contrary, it should adopt legal solutions firmly established in a series
of consistent cases, thereby contributing to the harmonious development of
international investment law.

LANGUAGE

Pursuant to paragraph 12.1 of Procedural Order No. 1, the procedural languages of
the arbitration are English and Spanish.

PLACE OF PROCEEDINGS

Pursuant to Articles 62 and 63 of the ICSID Convention and paragraph 11 of
Procedural Order No. 1, Washington D.C. is the place of the proceedings.

With the agreement of the Parties, as reflected in Procedural Order No. 3, the

hearing on jurisdiction was held by videoconference.

SCOPE OF THIS AWARD

As reflected in the Procedural Calendar at Annex 1 to Procedural Order No. 1, the
Parties have agreed to bifurcate the proceedings between jurisdiction and merits.
Therefore, the present Award addresses the Respondent's jurisdictional objections.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On 25 January 2018, ICSID received a Request for Arbitration dated 24 January

2018 from Ms. Carrizosa against the Republic of Colombia (the “Request’).

On 9 March 2018, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in
accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the
registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties
to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with
Rule 7(d) of ICSID’s Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and

Arbitration Proceedings.

The Parties agreed to constitute the Tribunal in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of
the ICSID Convention, as follows: the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators,
one to be appointed by each Party and the third, presiding arbitrator to be selected

by the co-arbitrators and appointed by agreement of the Parties.

Pursuant to this method, the Tribunal was composed of Prof. Diego Fernandez

Arroyo, a national of Argentina and Spain, appointed by the Claimant; Mr. Christer

Award

Sdderlund, a national of Sweden, appointed by the Respondent; and Prof. Gabrielle
Kaufmann-Kohler, President, a national of Switzerland, appointed by agreement of
the Parties.

On 11 December 2018, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the
ICSID Rules, notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their
appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted
on that date. Ms. Alicia Martin Blanco, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to
serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.

In accordance with Rules 13(1) and 20(1) of the ICSID Rules, the Tribunal held a
first session and preliminary procedural consultation with the Parties (“First
Session”) on 5 February 2019 by telephone conference.

Following the First Session, on 19 February 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural
Order No. 1 recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters and the
decision of the Tribunal on disputed issues. Procedural Order No. 1 provides, inter
alia, that the applicable ICSID Rules would be those in effect from 10 April 2006,
that the procedural languages would be English and Spanish, and that the place of
proceeding would be Washington, DC. Procedural Order No. 1 also sets out the
Parties’ agreement to appoint Mr. David Khachvani of Lévy Kaufmann-Kohler as
Assistant to the Tribunal, and includes a schedule for a bifurcated jurisdictional
phase of the proceedings. The schedule was later amended on several occasions.

On 7 March 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 on transparency of
the proceedings.

On 13 June 2019, the Claimant submitted her Memorial on Jurisdiction and
accompanying documents, including the witness statement of Ms. Astrida Benita

On 29 January 2020, the Tribunal confirmed that the Hearing on Jurisdiction had
been postponed from March to November 2020.

On 21 February 2020, the Respondent submitted its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and
accompanying documents, including a second expert report of Jorge Enrique Ibafez
Najar.

On 1 May 2020, the United States of America filed a submission as non-disputing
treaty Party, pursuant to Article 10.20.2 of the TPA (the “US Submission’).

On 5 May 2020, the Claimant requested leave to file written observations on the US
Submission, to which the Respondent objected on 8 May 2020. On 12 May 2020,
the Tribunal decided to grant the Parties an opportunity to file observations in writing

on the US Submission.

On 26 May 2020, the Parties submitted simultaneous written observations on the
US Submission.

On 20 July 2020, the Tribunal invited the Parties to consider whether they would be
agreeable to holding a virtual Hearing. The Parties indicated their preferences on
the format of the Hearing on 27 July 2020. The Claimant did not object and the
Respondent indicated that it would not object if the Tribunal determined that an in-
person hearing would not be feasible or advisable in view of the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic.

On 28 August 2020, the Respondent wrote to inform the Tribunal of the election the
day before of its legal expert Dr. Jorge Enrique Ibafiez Najar as a justice
(magistrado) of the Constitutional Court of Colombia. On 1 September 2020, the
Respondent (i) informed the Tribunal that Dr. Ibafiez’s appointment meant that,
pursuant to Colombian law, he would not be permitted to participate in the upcoming
Hearing; (ii) submitted that “the unique circumstances that would prevent Dr. Ibafiez
from participating in the Hearing constitute a valid reason pursuant to Section 19.13
of Procedural Order No. 1 for his failure to appear if summoned to the Hearing”; and
(iii) requested that the Tribunal “exercise its authority and discretion and consider
Dr. Ibafiez’s written reports (dated 23 October 2019 and 21 February 2020),
notwithstanding his inability to testify orally at the hearing.”

On 1 September 2020, the Parties informed the Tribunal of the witnesses and
experts that they wished to examine at the Hearing. The Respondent called Dr.
Martha Teresa Bricefio de Valencia, and the Claimant called Dr. Jorge Enrique
Ibafiez Najar. In addition, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal call six of her
experts to appear at the Hearing (Prof. Mistelis; Mr. Wethington; Prof. Coe; Dr.
Bricefio; Dr. L6pez Roca; and Dr. Vargas Rincon). In the alternative, the Claimant
sought leave to present said experts pursuant to Section 19.7 of Procedural Order
No. 1. On 4 September 2020, the Respondent objected to the Claimant's primary
and alternative requests.

On 4 September 2020, the Claimant responded to the Respondent's September 1
letter concerning its expert Dr. Ibafiez, and requested that: “unless Dr. Ibafez
appears for cross-examination at the hearing, the Tribunal should disregard his two

expert reports.”
A pre-hearing conference was held on 8 September 2020 by videoconference.

On 24 September 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 on the
organization of the Hearing. The order established inter alia (i) that the Hearing
would take place on 29 September 2020 and on 9-12 November 2020, with the
September session dedicated to the examination of Dr. Ibafez — before being sworn
in as a Constitutional Court Justice; (ii) that the Tribunal would only hear testimony
on jurisdiction at this Hearing and therefore that Prof. Coe, Dr. Lopez Roca and Dr.
Vargas Rincon would not be heard; and (iii) that the Claimant had not established
compelling reasons to examine Prof. Mistelis or Mr. Wethington in the sense of
Section 19.7 and the Tribunal did not deem it necessary to call them ex officio per
Section 19.10 of Procedural Order No. 1.

On 29 October 2020, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that Ms. Carrizosa would
be unable to attend the November Hearing and had requested to be represented at
the Hearing by her son, Mr. Alberto Carrizosa. On the same day, the Respondent
objected to the attendance of Mr. Carrizosa.

On 2 November 2020, the Tribunal found that it would not be appropriate to deny
the Claimant's right to appoint a person of her choice as representative at the
Hearing, and invited the Claimant to notify the appointment of Mr. Alberto Carrizosa
as her representative to the Secretary-General. On 2 November 2020, the Claimant
submitted her notification to the Secretary-General of ICSID. On 4 November 2020,
the Tribunal referred to the Claimant's letter of November 2, 2020 addressed to the
Secretary-General of ICSID and confirmed that the appointment had been properly
notified.

On 6 November 2020, the Claimant objected to the participation at the Hearing of
three persons listed in the Respondent's list of participants for the November
Hearing, to which the Respondent replied on 8 November 2020. On the same date,
the Tribunal decided that the three representatives should be admitted to attend the
November Hearing, and requested that the Respondent provide evidence of their
authority to attend on behalf of Colombia, which the Respondent did on 11
November 2020.

On 9 November 2020, the Claimant requested that the Hearing be postponed by
one day on account of tropical storm conditions in Miami, to which the Respondent

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

This section summarizes the factual background of the dispute that gave rise to this
arbitration. It does not purport to be exhaustive and is meant to provide a general
overview of the key facts and factual allegations to put the Tribunal’s analysis on
jurisdiction in proper context.

CLAIMANT AND HER INTERESTS IN COLOMBIA

The Claimant, Ms. Astrida Benita Carrizosa, is a citizen of the United States of
America since 1954.” At the center of her controversy with the Republic of Colombia
are the shares that she and her family held in Corporacién Grancolombiana de
Ahorro y Vivienda (“Granahorrar”).

Granahorrar was a financial institution founded in Colombia in 1972 as a subsidiary
of Banco de Colombia, a Colombian private bank.® It was a Corporacién de Ahorro
y Vivienda (“CAV”), a type of financial institution authorized to obtain capital via

deposits and to finance the construction industry through loans and mortgages.°

The Claimant, her husband Julio Carrizosa and three sons Alberto, Felipe, and
Enrique (the “Carrizosa Family”) acquired shares in Granahorrar in 1986.1° Within
the following two years, the Carrizosa Family became a majority shareholder in
Granahorrar.'’ They subsequently restructured their holdings, such that, by 1998,
Ms. Carrizosa indirectly owned 2.3307% of Granahorrar through three holding
companies incorporated in Colombia: (i) Asesorias e Inversiones C.G. S.A., (ii)
Inversiones Lieja LTDA, (iii) |.C. Interventorias y Construcciones LTDA (the “Holding
Companies”). The entire Carrizosa Family in turn (indirectly) owned 58.76% of
Granahorrar. Mr. Julio Carrizosa served as Chair of Granahorrar’s Board of
Directors.

THE 1997-2001 Economic Crisis

In the 1990s, Colombia began deregulating its financial sector following the global
shift toward market liberalization. It privatized State-run banks, admitted foreign
financial institutions, and recapitalized the national bank. As a result, in the first half
of the decade, the Colombian economy attracted a significant influx of foreign capital
and achieved an impressive growth of its gross domestic product.

The global tide started to change in 1996, as different regions took turns facing
economic recessions and financial crises. From 1997 through 2001, the Colombian
economy experienced what experts have termed as “the most severe economic
crisis in its history.”? At the heart of the crisis, which resulted in a significant
contraction of the gross domestic product and record levels of unemployment, was
the collapse of the country’s currency exchange regime and of the system of
financial services.

The crisis prompted the Government to increase the level of regulation in multiple
fields of economic activity. The financial sector was one of the first to face the
increased Governmental regulation. Throughout 1998, the Colombian financial
regulatory authorities adopted a variety of measures that applied to multiple actors
of the financial sector. Three administrative regulatory agencies were leading the
effort of the Government:

i. The Central Bank, which is established by the Constitution and among
various functions, serves as the lender of last resort to Colombian financial
entities;>

ii. The Superintendency, a regulatory body tasked with supervising the
Colombian financial system, ensuring, inter alia, that financial entities
maintain appropriate liquidity levels and preventing the public’s loss of
confidence in the financial system; '* and

iii. | Fogafin - a regulatory entity tasked with protecting depositors, preventing
unjustified enrichment by shareholders, and temporarily managing
distressed financial institutions to ensure their financial recovery.‘

In the process, the regulatory agencies conducted so-called oficializacion of a
number of banks and financial institutions.‘° Under this practice, the agencies
injected capital to rescue banks from a liquidity crisis. Depending on the volume of
the injections, the banks could eventually pass into the Government's control and
ownership.

The Government's efforts enjoyed a varied degree of success. Be it for those efforts
or otherwise, in the beginning of the new millennium, the Colombian economy
started to stabilize in line with the regional recovery.

FISCAL ADMINISTRATIVE MEASURES INVOLVING GRANAHORRAR

Granahorrar, as an entity involved in finance and construction — two severely
affected sectors — unsurprisingly suffered harsh consequences of the 1997-2001
economic crisis. The Parties dispute the extent to which the crisis contributed to
Granahorrar’s financial hardship. The Respondent submits that the effects of the
crisis were exacerbated by a dispute between Granahorrar’s shareholders that
lasted from late 1997 to mid-1998,"’ with the result that, by October 1998,
Granahorrar was in a severe liquidity crisis that created an insolvency emergency,
warranting the Government's regulatory interference. '® The Claimant disputes this
account. She calls Granahorrar’s condition at that time a “temporary liquidity deficit”
and argues that it was Colombia’s purported regulatory measures and its
discriminatory decisions to withhold requisite support that led to the deterioration of
the company’s financial standing.

The Parties also disagree on the nature and motives of the Governmental
intervention in Granahorrar’s business. For the purposes of the jurisdictional

analysis, the Tribunal can dispense with entering into these controversies. It suffices
to summarize the relevant administrative measures.

In June and July 1998, the Central Bank provided Granahorrar with temporary
liquidity infusions (“TLIs”) in the amount of approximately USD 194 million.2°
Pursuant to Resolution No. 25 of the Central Bank, TLIs constitute direct deposits
by the Central Bank on a given financial institution’s Central Bank account. They aim
at aiding financial institutions which suffer from a temporary liquidity squeeze but are
still solvent.2"

On 6 July 1998, Granahorrar and Fogafin executed an agreement, pursuant to which
Fogafin undertook to guarantee up to COP 300 billion (approximately USD 222
million) of Granahorrar’s interbank financing and overdraft obligations, until 6 August
1998 (the “Fogafin Agreement”). In exchange, Granahorrar agreed to issue to
Fogafin promissory notes valued at 134% of the guarantee amount actually relied
upon by Granahorrar.”* In subsequent months, the parties amended the Fogafin
Agreement 13 times, modifying the amounts, converting the guarantee into direct
funding by Fogafin and extending the maturity of the financing.”>

In a report issued on 22 July 1998, Fogafin recorded that, despite its interventions,
Granahorrar had lost approximately COP 311 billion (approximately USD 226
million) in savings accounts and certificates of deposit.24 The report also stated that
“restoration of trust in [Granahorrar] could be propelled by its sale” and thus
recommended that any further financial support be conditioned on a change in
Granahorrar’s ownership.7°

In the following months, Granahorrar’s financial standing continued to deteriorate.
The Parties diverge on Granahorrar’s precise condition at this time. The Respondent

argues that, by October 1998, Granahorrar defaulted on its payment obligations
toward its creditor banks, returned multiple checks and defaulted on its TLI interest
payments to the Central Bank, thereby becoming insolvent and violating the Fogafin
Agreement.”° The Claimant denies these allegations and argues that the financial
authorities withheld requisite support from Granahorrar compared to its
competitors.2”

Be this as it may, on 2 October 1998, the Central Bank terminated the TLIs and took
possession of Granahorrar’s promissory notes.22 On the same date, the
Superintendency directed Granahorrar to raise COP 157 billion (approximately
USD 99.8 million) in new capital to offset its alleged insolvency (the “Capitalization
Order’”).° It gave Granahorrar until 3:00 pm on the next day, 3 October 1998, to
raise the additional capital, citing the risk of a “systemic crisis” and “economic
panic.”*° While the Parties dispute whether the authorities have properly notified the
Capitalization Order to the shareholders of Granahorrar, it is common ground that
Granahorrar did not raise the additional capital as required by the Capitalization
Order.

On 3 October 1998, the Superintendency issued a report to Fogafin, concluding that
Granahorrar was insolvent and illiquid, citing its default on payments due to multiple
creditors.*' On the same day, it decided to proceed with the oficializacién of
Granahorrar, by recapitalizing it. Thus, still on 3 October 1998, Fogafin ordered
Granahorrar to reduce the nominal value of its shares to COP 0.01 (the “Value
Reduction Order’).°2

Once Granahorrar had complied with the Value Reduction Order, Fogafin
capitalized Granahorrar first with COP 30 billion (approximately USD 19 million) on
3 October 1998 and second by an additional COP 127 billion (approximately
USD 80.4 million) on 5 October 1998. As the capitalization was effected through
the acquisition of shares, Fogafin became Granahorrar’s majority shareholder. The
Parties disagree on whether the Value Reduction Order was properly notified to the
Carrizosa Family.

On 16 October 1998, Granahorrar held a general assembly of shareholders, at
which the attending shareholders — which did not include the Carrizosa Family —
unanimously approved new corporate statutes and elected a new board of
directors.“

These measures contained the collapse that Granahorrar was allegedly facing at
that period. Following the stabilization of the Colombian economy, on 31 October
2005, Fogafin sold Granahorrar to Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria, a Spanish
bank.%

ADMINISTRATIVE JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS

On 28 July 2000, the Claimant through her Colombian holding companies initiated
a judicial challenge of the administrative measures that the Governmental agencies
took in 1998 before the Administrative Tribunal of Cundinamarca. In particular, she
requested the nullification of the Value Reduction Order and the Capitalization Order
(collectively, the “1998 Measures”) and compensation for the value of the shares
that she held in Granahorrar together with interest.°°

Among other substantive and procedural defects, the Claimant argued that Fogafin
and the Superintendency had failed to properly notify her of the 1998 Measures, and
that the measures lacked substantive justification, since Granahorrar was not

actions had a sound basis in fact and law .%®

On 27 July 2005, the First Section of the Administrative Judicial Tribunal issued a
judgment, which dismissed the claims on the merits (the “2005 Judgment’).*? In
doing so, however, the court rejected the Governmental agencies’ defense founded
on the statute of limitation, as it held that the agencies had not properly notified the
1998 Measures to the Claimant.

The Claimant appealed. In her notice of appeal, she submitted that the
Administrative Judicial Tribunal had failed to: (i) decide her claims; (ii) assess the
evidence; (iii) properly interpret the 1998 Measures; and (iv) recognize Fogafin’s and
the Superintendency’s abuse of power.*? The appeal was assigned to the Fourth
Section of the Council of State. The Council of State is Colombia’s highest judicial
organ with jurisdiction in administrative matters.

On 1 November 2007, the Council of State issued its judgment (the “2007
Judgment”), in which it reversed the 2005 Judgment.‘' According to the Council of
State, at the time of taking the 1998 Measures, the Governmental agencies had
insufficient evidence to conclude that Granahorrar had become insolvent. In turn,
the Council of State upheld the Administrative Judicial Tribunal’s finding that the
Superintendency and Fogafin had not complied with the applicable notification
requirements and therefore the Claimant's appeal was not barred under the statute
of limitation.4* Consequently, the Council of State ordered the Superintendency and

review of judgments of the Council of State.©° Be that as it may, in this instance, the
Constitutional Court decided to select the petitions of the Superintendency and
Fogafin for the full bench review with the aim of setting a judicial precedent.* It thus
consolidated the two petitions in a single proceeding and issued a stay of the 2007
Judgment pending such review.*?

On 26 May 2011, the Constitutional Court issued a unanimous judgment (the “2011
Decision”) quashing the 2007 Judgment on the ground that the Council of State had
committed substantive, procedural, and factual errors.®? The Constitutional Court
reasoned that the Superintendency and Fogafin had properly notified the Claimant
of the 1998 Measures and, therefore, her judicial challenge of those measures was
time barred.

The Claimant filed a petition to annul the 2011 Decision before the Constitutional
Court. While the Parties agree that the Constitutional Court may annul its own
judgments in certain circumstances, they dispute the legal nature of the annulment
proceedings.

In support of its annulment action, the Claimant argued that the Constitutional Court
had violated her due process rights by improperly assuming jurisdiction over a
matter that fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Council of State.°4 The Claimant
was joined in her petition by Magistrate Mauricio Fajardo, a then member of the
Council of State, who also complained that the Constitutional Court had overstepped
its mandate by reviewing the 2007 Judgment.

On 25 June 2014, the Constitutional Court issued an order (the “2014 Order”),

the Constitutional Court.

ANALYSIS

The Parties agree that these proceedings are instituted under the ICSID Convention.
Pursuant to Article 41 of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal has the authority to
determine its jurisdiction:

(1) The Tribunal shall be the judge of its own competence.

(2) Any objection by a party to the dispute that that dispute is not within

the jurisdiction of the Centre, or for other reasons is not within the

competence of the Tribunal, shall be considered by the Tribunal which

shall determine whether to deal with it as a preliminary question or to join

it to the merits of the dispute.
To discharge this mandate, the Tribunal must analyze the facts and the Parties’
positions to determine whether the present dispute is within its jurisdiction. The
starting point of the analysis is Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, which reads
as follows:

The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising
directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any
constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to
the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State,
which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.
When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its
consent unilaterally.

It is well established that a State does not automatically consent to the jurisdiction
of the Centre by virtue of being Parties to the ICSID Convention. As is clear from
Article 25 of the Convention, in addition there must exist a “consent in writing”
between the disputing Parties to submit their dispute to arbitration (not to speak of
the other requirements contained in Article 25).

The Claimant invokes the TPA and the Colombia-Switzerland BIT as Colombia’s
written offer to arbitrate, which she purports to have accepted in her Request for
Arbitration of 24 January 2018 (the “RFA”).°° The Respondent objects that it has not
consented to submit this dispute to this Tribunal. More specifically, Colombia raises
objections to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione temporis, ratione voluntatis and
ratione materiae. The Claimant rejects these objections.

In this Section, the Tribunal will analyze the jurisdictional objections. Before setting
out its analysis on an objection, it will briefly summarize the Parties’ respective
positions. If the Tribunal finds one or more of the jurisdictional objections to be
dispositive of the case, it may dispense with analyzing the rest of the objections.

TEMPORAL SCOPE OF THE TPA

The Parties disagree on whether the dispute and the claims fall within the temporal
scope of Colombia's consent to arbitration under the TPA, which entered into force
on 15 May 2012. In particular, they dispute whether the fact that the bulk of
Colombia’s impugned conduct took place before the entry into force of the TPA
places the dispute outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

1. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent submits that the Claimant has failed to establish that the Tribunal
has jurisdiction ratione temporis. According to Colombia, the present dispute and
the claims fall outside the temporal scope of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction pursuant to
Article 10.1.3 of the TPA®’ and the customary international law principle of non-
retroactivity.

Under the principle of non-retroactivity of treaties, as codified in Article 28 of the
VCLT, State conduct that occurred before the entry into force of the TPA could not

submissions.

possibly amount to a violation of that treaty.®* Indeed, as Article 13 of the ILC Articles
on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (the “ILC Articles”)
clarifies:

An act of a State does not constitute a breach of an international

obligation unless the State is bound by the obligation in question at the

time the act occurs.°?

107. Article 10.1.3 of the TPA reflects this customary rule by limiting the temporal scope

of the Contracting States’ consent to arbitrate. It provides that Chapter 10 of the TPA
“does not bind any Party in relation to any act or fact that took place or any situation
that ceased to exist before the date of entry into force of this Agreement.”©

108. The Respondent points out that, except for the 2014 Order of the Constitutional
Court, all of the acts of which the Claimant complains predate the entry into force of
the TPA on 15 May 2012.*' Therefore, the claims flowing from those acts are outside

the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione temporis.

109. With respect to the 2014 Order, Colombia submits that, when faced with conduct
postdating the entry into force of the treaty, the test is whether the conduct changes

the pre-treaty status quo of the claimant's investment. That is not the case of the
2014 Order, which merely confirmed the 2011 Decision.®

The Respondent's legal expert, Dr. Ibafez, testified that the remedy that the
Claimant sought against the 2011 Decision was an extraordinary recourse, which
does not provide for a possibility of appeal.“ Thus, according to the Respondent,
the 2014 Order merely put an end to an attempt to reopen the closed proceedings
regarding the 1998 Measures, which had ended with a final judgment dismissing the
Claimant's claims. It is manifest that the 2014 Order did not change the status quo
that prevailed before the TPA's entry into force.®° For the Respondent, the Claimant
seeks to use the 2014 Order as a “Trojan horse, designed to potentiate a claim that,
at its core, challenges pre-treaty rather than post-treaty conduct.”

Furthermore, in reliance on the reasoning of the Spence tribunal, the Respondent
argues that for post-treaty conduct to come under the jurisdiction of the treaty
tribunal, it must “constitute an actionable breach in its own right.”*” According to
Colombia, the claims concerning the 2014 Order are not independently actionable,
because the adjudication of these claims would require a finding on the lawfulness
of pre-treaty conduct (i.e., of the 1998 Measures and of the 2011 Decision).

For Colombia, it is not only the claims that are outside the Tribunal’s temporal
jurisdiction, but also the legal dispute as a whole. The notion of dispute has a broad
definition in international law. It denotes “a disagreement on a point of law or fact, a
conflict of legal views or of interests between two persons.”® According to the

Respondent, conduct that takes place after a dispute has arisen may confirm or
prolong the same dispute, without thereby triggering a new dispute.”°

113. Colombia submits that the present dispute arose at the latest on 28 July 2000, when
the Claimant initiated the judicial action before the Administrative Judicial Tribunal,
through which she challenged the lawfulness of the 1998 Measures and sought
compensation.”' It cannot be seriously argued that the 2014 Order triggered a new

dispute.

114. Therefore, according to Colombia, the present dispute predates the entry into force
of the TPA and is thus outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione temporis.

2. The Claimant’s Position

115. The Claimant submits that her claims and the overall dispute are within the temporal
scope of the TPA, since the conduct of which she complains transcends the TPA’s
entry into force in 2012. The Claimant does not oppose what she calls Colombia’s
“unremarkable proposition” that the TPA does not apply to acts that occurred prior
to its entry into force.’ Nor does she challenge that this proposition is grounded on
Article 28 of the VCLT.’3 However, this does not, so the Claimant argues, exempt
the Respondent from responsibility for the measures it took after the TPA’s entry
into force, i.e. responsibility for the 2014 Order.

116. Relying on Chevron v. Ecuador, the Claimant contends that an investor may
maintain a treaty claim based upon a State measure after the treaty’s entry into
force, even though other State conduct related to the measure may have occurred
prior to the treaty’s effective date.” In this vein, the Chevron tribunal was “satisfied
that the alleged improper action or inaction by the Ecuadorian courts post-dating the
BIT’s entry into force could still amount to a denial of justice” even though the

claimant’s investment had “been influenced by acts and omissions occurring prior to
the entry into force of the BIT.”’5 To bolster her position, the Claimant further relies
on several decisions concerning the ratione temporis scope of the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (“ICCPR’”) and its Optional Protocol.’®

Furthermore, according to the Claimant, the non-retroactivity presumption anchored
in Article 28 of the VCLT and the intertemporal principle embodied in Article 13 of
the ILC Articles concern the temporal application of treaties to State acts -- not to
disputes. There is no general principle of international law that would render the TPA
inapplicable to “disputes”, as distinct from “acts”, pre-dating its entry into force.

In this respect, the Claimant opposes the Respondent's reliance on Article 10.1.3 of
the TPA for the proposition that “[i]n the application of investment treaties, one of the
temporal dimensions that is governed by the principle of non-retroactivity relates to

the moment in which the dispute arose.”””

According to the Claimant, this provision merely restates the general rule of non-
retroactivity of treaties, and does not purport to place disputes that may have arisen
before the entry into force of the TPA outside the scope of the treaty’s consent to
arbitration.

The Claimant considers that the decisions in Lucchetti v. Peru and Vieira v. Chile,
on which Colombia relies, are inapposite. There, the tribunals’ rejection of pre-treaty
disputes on ratione temporis grounds was premised on express exclusions in the
relevant treaty language of the Chile-Peru and Chile-Spain BITs, which provided
that the treaties:

[S]hall not, however, apply to differences or disputes that arose prior to

[S]hall not apply [...] to disputes or claims arising or resolved prior to its

No comparable language is found in the TPA. Accordingly, so says the Claimant, it
should not be assumed that the Parties have excluded pre-TPA disputes from the

treaty’s scope of application.

In any event, even if the TPA excluded from its ambit all “disputes” that arose before
its entry into force, this dispute arose in 2014. In this respect, the Claimant defines
the term “dispute” as a controversy on an alleged violation of the applicable treaty.
In this respect, the Claimant distinguishes a dispute that alleges a treaty violation
based upon post-treaty State conduct from an earlier (related) dispute over conduct
that preceded the treaty. She argues that, the former category of controversy could
not have arisen until the challenged State measure alleged to violate the TPA, had
occurred. Since the TPA only entered into force in 2012, there could have been no

dispute about its violation prior to that date.

Therefore, the Claimant submits that the present dispute, which arose after the 2014

Order, is within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione temporis.

3. Analysis

It is common ground between the Parties that the TPA does not apply to conduct
that predates its entry into force.® It is indeed uncontroversial that, pursuant to the
customary international law rule about non-retroactivity, a treaty does not bind the
Contracting States in respect of their pre-treaty actions or omissions, unless it
provides otherwise. Article 28 of the VCLT codifies this rule also known as the
principle of non-retroactivity of treaties:

Unless a different intention appears from the treaty or is otherwise
established, its provisions do not bind a party in relation to any act or fact

which took place or any situation which ceased to exist before the date

of the entry into force of the treaty with respect to that party.®"
The TPA does not provide otherwise. Instead, its Article 10.1.3 confirms the
customary rule of non-retroactivity in the following terms:

For greater certainty, this Chapter does not bind any Party in relation to

any act or fact that took place or any situation that ceased to exist before

the date of entry into force of this Agreement.®?
The TPA entered into force on 15 May 2012.8 Among the measures that the
Claimant alleges as the basis of her claims, only the 2014 Order postdates the entry
into force of the TPA. The prior conduct of Colombia, including the 1998 Measures
and the 2011 Decision took place before the TPA’s effective date and cannot
possibly constitute a breach of the TPA. This conclusion is confirmed by the rule of
State responsibility, according to which there can be no breach of an international
obligation if that obligation did not apply at the time of the commission of the
allegedly unlawful conduct:

An act of a State does not constitute a breach of an international

obligation unless the State is bound by the obligation in question at the

time the act occurs.
Article 12.1.2(b) of the TPA — the purported basis for the consent to arbitration in this
case — limits the Tribunals jurisdiction “solely” to:

[C]laims that a Party has breached Articles 10.7 (Expropriation and

Compensation), 10.8 (Transfers), 10.12 (Denial of Benefits), or 10.14

(Special Formalities and Information Requirements).®
Colombia could not have violated those provisions by conduct that predated the
entry into force of the TPA. Thus, any claim of unlawfulness of the Respondent's
pre-TPA conduct is outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

That being so, it remains to be seen whether the Tribunal could exercise jurisdiction
over the claim that the 2014 Order violated the provisions of the TPA, e.g. because

that order constituted an unlawful judicial expropriation of the Claimant’s alleged
investment.

Colombia submits that such claim is also beyond the temporal scope of the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction. In the Tribunal’s view, the Respondent’s objection in this
respect can be divided in two principal arguments.

= First, Colombia argues that the Tribunal cannot separately entertain a claim
arising out of the 2014 Order, the reason being that the principle of treaty non-
retroactivity - as embodied in Article 10.1.3 of the TPA — carves out from the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction the present dispute as a whole, since it arose prior to the
TPA’s entry into force.

=" Second, the Respondent submits that a claim related to the lawfulness of the
2014 Order lies beyond the Tribunal’s competence, since that order is not an

independently actionable breach of the TPA.

In addition, Colombia also asserts that the 2014 Order did not change the pre-treaty
status quo of the Claimant's alleged investment. This argument is, however, closely
intertwined with the Respondent's defense that the 2014 Order does not constitute
an independently actionable treaty breach. The Tribunal will therefore deal with
these issues together.

The Tribunal will address the two prongs of the Respondent's objection in turn.
a. The scope of the TPA is not limited to post-treaty disputes

The Respondent argues that the principle of treaty non-retroactivity excludes from
the treaty’s scope of application not only pre-treaty conduct, but also any dispute
that would have arisen prior to the treaty’s entry into force.®° Resorting to what it
calls the “classic” definition of dispute found in the PClJ’s Mavrommatis judgment, *”
Colombia submits that the dispute between Ms. Carrizosa and Colombia arose well
before the TPA’s entry into force, and in particular when Colombia’s competent
organs took the 1998 Measures. Thus, even though one of the impugned acts — the

2014 Order — postdates the treaty’s effective date, for the Respondent, the entire
dispute lies beyond the temporal scope of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

The Claimant's refutation of this objection is twofold. First, she disagrees with the
proposition that the customary international law principle of treaty non-retroactivity
applies to disputes. Second, she considers that the Respondent’s proposed general
definition of dispute should be discarded in favor of a more specific definition based
on Chapter 10 of the TPA, which refers to investment disputes involving claims of a
violation of the TPA. According to the Claimant, no dispute could have existed under
that definition prior to the TPA’s entry into force. Thus, Colombia’s contention that
the dispute predates the TPA has no merit.

The Tribunal is not persuaded that the temporal scope of its jurisdiction is limited to
disputes that have arisen after the entry into force of the TPA. The text of the TPA
contains no temporal limitation with respect to disputes that may come under the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction. The language of Article 10.1.3 of the TPA, which reflects the
customary international law principle of treaty non-retroactivity, excludes any pre-
treaty “act or fact’, but is silent on pre-treaty disputes.

The PClJ’s definition of dispute as “a disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict
of legal views or of interests between two persons”® covers a situation where a
single dispute encompasses several claims related to various actions and
omissions, each of which may constitute a self-standing violation of applicable legal
norms. If, while the dispute is unfolding, a disputing State accedes to an international
treaty, which prohibits a type of conduct that underlies the existing dispute,
subsequent acts of the same type are not outside the treaty’s scope of application
simply because such acts may be deemed part of the existing dispute.

As an example, assume an ongoing dispute between State A and State B arising
out of State A’s pollution of a shared river. If the two States enter into a treaty that
prohibits such environmental pollution, it would hardly be a valid defense for State
A to argue that it should be allowed to continue polluting the river, because the

dispute over the pollution arose prior to the treaty’s entry into force.

138. Here too, if the 2014 Order could give rise to a self-standing breach of the TPA — an
issue that will be addressed in the subsequent section — the principle of treaty non-
retroactivity would not place that post-TPA breach outside the treaty’s temporal
scope. The fact that the broader dispute concerning the alleged mistreatment of the
Claimant’s purported investment in Colombia may have arisen before the TPA’s
effective date does not mean that the TPA condoned Colombia’s repeated
mistreatment of the Claimant’s investment after its entry into force. Such an outcome
would not be warranted by the ordinary meaning of the terms of Article 10.1.3 of the
TPA, their context, or the object and purpose of the TPA.

139. To substantiate its position, the Respondent cites several investment awards.®°
These awards do not, however, support the proposition that the principle of treaty
non-retroactivity excludes pre-treaty disputes from the treaty’s scope of application,
especially in cases where the disputed conduct continues after the treaty’s entry into
force.

140. It is correct that the tribunal in MC/ v. Ecuador held that “[a]ny dispute arising prior
to [the BIT’s effective] date will not be capable of being submitted to the dispute
resolution system established by the BIT.”°° Yet, it went on to clarify that a distinction
should be drawn between pre- and post-treaty acts and that it had jurisdiction over
claims of alleged violations of the BIT arising from post-treaty conduct:

With respect to acts or omissions alleged by the Claimants to be
breaches of the BIT subsequent to its entry into force, the Tribunal
considers that it has Competence insofar and as those facts are proven
to be a violation of the BIT.%

In other words, the MC/ tribunal confirmed that, if a post-treaty act constitutes an
independently actionable breach of the treaty, the principle of treaty non-retroactivity
would not prevent the treaty tribunal from exercising jurisdiction over claims arising
out of such breach.

Similarly, in Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine, the tribunal confirmed that it would have
jurisdiction on a “cause of action” arisen after the treaty’s effective date:
The obligations assumed by the two state parties to the BIT relating to
the minimum standards of investment protection (including the
prohibition against expropriation) did not become binding, and hence
legally enforceable, until the BIT entered into force on 16 November
1996. It follows that a cause of action based on one of the BIT standards
of protection must have arisen after 16 November 1996.%
Thus, if post-treaty conduct can constitute an independent cause of action under the
treaty, it will come under the treaty tribunal's jurisdiction, irrespective of whether such

conduct may pertain to a broader pre-treaty dispute.

In ATA v. Jordan the tribunal held that the treaty did not apply retroactively to pre-
treaty investment disputes:
Under the plain meaning of Article IX(1), the Tribunal may only exercise
jurisdiction ratione temporis over the Claimant's claims if it finds that the
dispute arose after the entry into force of the Treaty on 23 January
2006.%°
Article X(1) of the Turkey-Jordan BIT on which the tribunal based this conclusion,
however, does not appear to substantiate the application of the principle of treaty
non-retroactivity to disputes.** While the provision makes clear that the treaty shall
apply to pre-existing investments it does not mention pre-treaty disputes. It is
therefore difficult to understand the basis on which the tribunal concluded that pre-

treaty disputes were beyond the scope of its jurisdiction.

146. In any event, the ATA tribunal acknowledged the reasoning of the NAFTA tribunal
in Mondev v. USA, according to which a treaty tribunal can exercise jurisdiction over
post-treaty acts, which are “themselves inconsistent with applicable provisions of
[the treaty]”, even if the dispute arose prior to the treaty’s effective date.°° The ATA
tribunal did not purport to override this reasoning. Instead, it moved on to set out an
alternative reasoning that justified declining jurisdiction in that case:

Even if the Tribunal were to assume, arguendo, that the alleged denial
of justice represented a discrete claim, unconnected to the dispute which
is the gravamen of the Claimant’s case on this point, and thus may be
conceived as occurring after the entry into force of the BIT, does an
international commercial arbitral award constitute an investment that
could be, as it were, expropriated by an otherwise lawful annulment by
a national court?%

147. This Tribunal considers the reasoning of the Mondev v. USA tribunal more
persuasive. In that case, the dispute arose prior to the entry into force of the NAFTA.
When the NAFTA entered into force, the claimant’s judicial challenge of the
impugned measures was pending before the Massachusetts courts. The claimant
argued that, since a claim for denial of justice could not be perfected until the
exhaustion of local remedies and since local remedies were not exhausted until after
the entry into force of NAFTA, the tribunal could entertain a denial of justice claim.
While the tribunal rejected that argument, it did acknowledge that it could have
assumed jurisdiction if the judicial decisions post-dating the NAFTA amounted to
breaches of the NAFTA:

Thus events or conduct prior to the entry into force of an obligation for
the respondent State may be relevant in determining whether the State
has subsequently committed a breach of the obligation. But it must still
be possible to point to conduct of the State after that date which is itself
a breach. In the present case the only conduct which could possibly
constitute a breach of any provision of Chapter 11 is that comprised by
the decisions of the SJC and the Supreme Court of the United States,
which between them put an end to LPA’s claims under Massachusetts
law. Unless those decisions were themselves inconsistent with
applicable provisions of Chapter 11, the fact that they related to pre-1994
conduct which might arguably have violated obligations under NAFTA

(had NAFTA been in force at the time) cannot assist Mondev. The mere
fact that earlier conduct has gone unremedied or unredressed when a

treaty enters into force does not justify a tribunal applying the treaty
retrospectively to that conduct. Any other approach would subvert both
the intertemporal principle in the law of treaties and the basic distinction
between breach and reparation which underlies the law of State
responsibility.°”
Consequently, as the operative part of the award shows, the Mondev tribunal
concluded that it had jurisdiction, albeit “limited to Mondev’s claims concerning the

decisions of the United States courts.”®

Thus, if post-treaty conduct is in itself an actionable breach of the treaty, the principle
of non-retroactivity does not place such conduct outside the reach of the treaty even
if the dispute to which the conduct pertains had arisen before the treaty entered into
force. For this reason, the Tribunal need not determine whether the notion of dispute
found in Chapter 10 of the TPA prevails over the broad notion found in customary
international law. In either case, the Tribunal would be competent to entertain a claim
which arises from a particular post-treaty conduct and which is capable of
constituting a breach of the TPA.

In the following section, the Tribunal will now review whether the 2014 Order is
capable of constituting an independently actionable breach of the TPA.

b. The 2014 Order is not an independently actionable breach of the TPA

As set out above, the Parties agree that, pursuant to the principle of non-retroactivity,
the TPA does not apply to acts and facts that took place before the treaty’s entry
into force. The 2014 Order is the only contested act that occurred after the TPA’s
effective date. The Respondent argues, however, that the claims related to the 2014
Order are not independently actionable, “because adjudication of these claims would
require a finding on the lawfulness of pre-treaty conduct.”99

The Claimant concurs with what she calls “the uncontroversial proposition that the
challenged State measure during the relevant timeframe (post-entry-into-force and
after the limitations cut-off date) must give rise to a claim under the treaty."

97 Mondev v. USA, Award, Exh. CL-0045, para. 70.

Award

However, for the Claimant, this proposition does not entail that the post-treaty claim
must be unrelated to the pre-treaty conduct.

The Tribunal recalls that its jurisdiction under Article 12.1.2(b) of the TPA is limited
to claims of violations of a specific set of substantive provisions of Chapter 10 of the
TPA. Those provisions in turn are temporally limited to post-treaty acts and facts
pursuant to Article 10.1.3 of the TPA. The cumulative result of these two limitations
is that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to assess the lawfulness of the Respondent's
pre-treaty conduct, be it under the TPA or under any other source, such as
customary international law. It follows that, unless the post-treaty conduct (i.e. the
2014 Order) is itself capable of constituting a breach of the TPA, independently from
the question of (un)lawfulness of the pre-treaty conduct, claims arising out of such
post-treaty conduct would also fall outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

The Tribunal finds support for its reasoning in multiple investment treaty awards. In
particular, as set out above, when addressing the issue of treaty non-retroactivity,
the tribunal in Mondev v. USA reasoned that the post-treaty judicial decisions would
come under its jurisdiction only if they were “themselves inconsistent” with the
NAFTA:

Unless those [post-NAFTA] decisions were themselves inconsistent with

applicable provisions of Chapter 11, the fact that they related to pre-1994

conduct which might arguably have violated obligations under NAFTA

(had NAFTA been in force at the time) cannot assist Mondev. '°
Amore recent decision in Spence v. Costa Rica is also instructive. The case related
to Costa Rica’s environmental regulations for the protection of leatherback turtles,
which allegedly resulted in an unlawful expropriation of the claimant’s property.
While the regulatory measures predated the applicable treaty’s effective date, the
judicial decisions that determined the compensation due for the alleged
expropriation were taken after the treaty came into force. When interpreting Article
10.1.3 of the applicable treaty'°? — equivalent to Article 10.1.3 of the TPA — the
tribunal reasoned that pre-treaty conduct could “constitute circumstantial evidence
that confirms or vitiates an apparent post-entry into force breach, for example, going

to the intention of the respondent.”'®? However, in order for the post-treaty conduct
to come under the tribunal's jurisdiction, it needed to “constitute an actionable
breach in its own right.” The tribunal went on to emphasize that:

[I]t will be necessary to assess whether the claim that is alleged can be

sufficiently detached from pre-entry into force acts and facts so as to be

independently justiciable. 1°

156. In the present case, the single post-treaty conduct of which the Claimant complains

fails to meet this test. The Parties and their legal experts extensively debated various
points of disagreement in respect of the legal nature of the 2014 Order. In particular,
the discussion focused on whether the annulment proceedings leading to the
issuance of the 2014 Order were in the nature of an extraordinary recourse (recurso
extraordinario) under Colombian law.’ The Claimant acknowledged that
annulment is an “exceptional possibility” which does “not involve a de novo review
of the merits of the case”, and is allowed in “special circumstances where due
process is seriously affected.”"°” In addition, the experts did not dispute that through
this order, the Constitutional Court reviewed the Claimant’s and the Council of
State’s petition for the annulment of its 2011 Decision.’ In other words, the legal
effect of the 2014 Order was to leave unaltered the outcome of the 2011 Decision,
which in turn had annulled the 2007 Judgment.

157. As discussed earlier, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to assess the lawfulness of the
Respondent's pre-TPA conduct. The mere fact that in 2014 the Constitutional Court
did not annul or otherwise redress the outcome of the pre-treaty measures does not

place those measures within the scope of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. To borrow the
words of the Mondev tribunal:
The mere fact that earlier conduct has gone unremedied or unredressed
when a treaty enters into force does not justify a tribunal applying the
treaty retrospectively to that conduct. 1°
The Claimant did assert that the 2014 Order “coincided with the end of all judicial
labor in Colombia concerning the Claimant's investment” and that her “claims arise
from Order 188/14, the Constitutional Court’s June 25, 2014 denial of the motion for
annulment of its May 26, 2011 opinion.”""°, but nowhere did she raise any specific
allegations that impugn the lawfulness of the 2014 Order separately from her
complaints about the 1998 Measures and the 2011 Decision.

To the extent the Claimant’s challenge of the 2014 Order were to mean that the
Order constitutes a self-standing denial of justice, that claim could not prosper as a
matter of jurisdiction. Indeed, denial of justice is one of the components of the FET
standard and the latter is not available to an investor under Chapter Twelve of the
TPA, not to speak of the fact that the claim would have been barred by the three
year limitation period, as explained in the following section.

At the Hearing, the Tribunal asked the Claimant to articulate whether she raised any
complaint specifically directed at the 2014 Order and, if so, whether she claimed
damages caused by such order and distinct from the compensation sought for the
pre-treaty conduct. Her answer was the following:
The 2014 Constitutional Court's opinion had the effect of finally
removing, without compensation, Claimant's entitlement to the value of
her investment in Granahorrar that had been embodied in the 2007
Judgment that the Council of State had rendered.‘
This statement does not point to an independent allegation raised against the 2014
Order. It rather corroborates that the proceedings ending with the 2014 Order
necessarily called for a finding about the lawfulness of the 2011 Decision. It was the
2011 Decision that - to borrow the Claimant's words — would have “removed” the
Claimant’s alleged investment embodied in the 2007 Judgment, assuming a

judgment can embody an investment. If the 2011 Decision was lawful, the 2014
Order, which refused to annul it, would inevitably also be lawful, as the Claimant has
alleged no independent violation perpetrated through the proceedings leading to the
2014 Order, such as a denial of justice, through the order itself. This being so, the
Claimant does not dispute that the 2011 Decision cannot amount to a breach of the
TPA, for the reason that the 2011 Decision predated the TPA’s entry into force in
2012.""? Given that the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is limited to the adjudication of alleged
breaches of the TPA," the Tribunal is not competent to resolve a claim that in its
essence arises out of measures predating the entry into force of the TPA.

Moreover, the Claimant's categorization of the damages claimed undoubtedly
shows that she does not claim redress for losses suffered from the 2014 Order in
and of itself. As the Claimant's damages expert, Mr. Argiz explains, the Claimant
retained him to:
[P]rovide expert opinions on damages incurred by the Claimant as a
result of the Colombian government's (“Respondent”) actions through its
agencies (e.g. Central Bank, FOGAFIN and Superintendency of
Banking) to expropriate Corporacion Colombiana de Ahorro y Vivienda
(‘Granahorrar”), resulting in loss of value of Claimant's interest in
Granahorrar.'
The Tribunal would not be able to decide on such damages without reviewing the
lawfulness of the pre-TPA measures that are indisputably beyond the temporal
scope of the TPA.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal adds that it is not the Claimant's failure to
articulate a prima facie case on the merits that results in a finding of lack of
jurisdiction. Rather, it is the fact that the only measure that postdates the TPA’s entry
into force is not separately impeachable, or in the words of the Spence tribunal, does
not “constitute an actionable breach in its own right.”""

The Claimant is correct that the Spence tribunal held that a court judgment

for a pre-treaty expropriation, could constitute “an independently actionable breach,
a distinct and legally significant event that is capable of founding a claim in its own
right.”'° However, there is a significant difference between a judgment that sets the
compensation for an expropriation and may thus breach the treaty if the
compensation is not adequate or effective, and a court decision that resolved a
challenge over an alleged prior administrative expropriation.

Indeed, a judicial decision dealing with the amount of compensation for expropriation
can be independently challenged, e.g. for violating the treaty’s standard of adequate
and effective compensation. The same cannot be said of the 2014 Order, which
merely rejected the bid to annul the 2011 Decision and is not alleged to amount to
a treaty violation separate and distinct from the prior challenged measures. Hence,
the Claimant’s statement that the “2014 Order constituted a new State measure on

which Claimant's claims are based”""” is unpersuasive.

For these reasons, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the measures giving
rise to the claims in this arbitration predate the entry into force of the TPA and are
therefore not capable of constituting breaches of the TPA. As a result, the claims
are beyond the temporal scope of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. The Tribunal could stop
its analysis here. Out of an abundance of caution, it will nevertheless address the
Respondent's other objection to its temporal jurisdiction, which relate to the three-
year limitation period under Article 10.18.1 of the TPA.

LIMITATION UNDER ARTICLE 10.18.1 TPA

The Parties disagree whether the three-year limitation period contained in Article
10.18.1 of the TPA bars the claims in this arbitration.

1. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent submits that the claims are time barred under Article 10.18.1 of the
TPA, which provides for a three-year limitation period as one of the conditions to
Colombia's consent to arbitration. ""®

170. Colombia opposes the Claimant's argument that the limitation of Article 10.18.1 does
not apply to her claims, which are submitted under Chapter 12 of the TPA. It argues
that Chapter 12 of the TPA does not itself include an investor-State dispute
settlement procedure, but instead incorporates the dispute resolution provisions of
Chapter 10. In doing so, it does not purport to abandon the limitations to arbitration
set forth in Chapter 10.

171. Therefore, according to the Respondent, the cut-off date for the claims pursuant to
Article 10.18.1 is 24 January 2015 (i.e., three years before the Claimant submitted
her claims). The latest alleged breach of which the Claimant complains is the 2014
Order, which was issued on 25 June 2014, i.e., six months before the cut-off date.
As a result, her claims are time-barred in their entirety.

172. Colombia further challenges the Claimants’ contention that the MFN provision of
Chapter 12 of the TPA would allow her to resort to a more favorable five-year
limitation period contained in the BIT which Colombia concluded with Switzerland. 1°
As an initial matter, the Respondent argues that the Claimant cannot rely on the
MEN provision, since it is outside the scope of the TPA’s consent to arbitration
contained in Article 12.1.2(b).'7° In any event, the MFN provision, which is contained
in Article 12.3.1 of the TPA‘*' does not specify whether it applies to conditions to
consent to arbitration. According to a consistent line of investment jurisprudence, an
MEN clause cannot be used to circumvent conditions of consent unless its text

“clearly and unambiguously” so provides. 122

173. For the Respondent, the Claimant's reference to the object and purpose of the TPA
is ill-placed. Nothing in the object and purpose of the TPA suggests that a general
MEN provision can be applied to the consent to arbitrate. As for the Claimant's
argument in respect of Colombia’s treaty practice, the Respondent argues that, such
practice is not a proper source of treaty interpretation under the Vienna Convention
on the Law of Treaties (“VCLT”).

174. By contrast, an interpretative agreement of the Contracting States is authoritative
pursuant to Article 31.3(b) of the VCLT and the Tribunal must take such agreement
into account. '?3 As the US Submission makes clear, the US and Colombia agree on
the interpretation of the TPA. This includes the interpretation of Article 12.1.2(b)
which “incorporate[s] into Chapter Twelve the dispute resolution provisions of
Chapter Ten, Section B, ‘solely’ with respect to claims brought under the specific
Chapter Ten Articles incorporated into Chapter Twelve.”'*4 As a result, “an investor-
State Tribunal has no jurisdiction to consider any procedural or substantive
treatment extended by a TPA Party to a third-State investor or investment through
a multilateral or bilateral agreement of a TPA Party with a third State.”"75

For Colombia, even if the Claimant were permitted to use the MFN clause to resort
to the limitation period contained in the Colombia-Switzerland BIT, this would not
help her case, as she also failed to meet the five-year statute of limitation set in that
treaty. Indeed, the application of the five-year limitation would defer the cut-off date
to 24 January 2013. Pursuant to the Colombia-Switzerland BIT, the Claimant would
need to have acquired knowledge of the events giving rise to the dispute after that
date. Yet, so argues Colombia, these events occurred well before that date in
January 2013. Therefore, the claims would in any event be time barred.

More specifically, Colombia asserts that the dispute arose at the latest on 28 July
2000, the date on which the Claimant initiated the judicial action before the
Administrative Judicial Tribunal, through which she challenged the lawfulness of the
1998 Measures and sought compensation. '?° The Claimant's attempt to portray the
2014 Order as an event triggering a new dispute ignores that it merely confirmed the
2011 Decision. The 2014 Order, so submits the Respondent, cannot be divorced
from Colombia’s prior conduct. The Claimant’s submissions in this arbitration
confirm as much, considering that she challenges the lawfulness of “both the
regulatory and the judicial treatments imposed by the Republic of Colombia.”'2”
Therefore, for the Respondent, it is evident that the 2014 Order did not give rise to
a new dispute. 17°

For these reasons, the Respondent submits that, the claims are time-barred under
Article 10.18.1 of the TPA and, therefore, outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

2. The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant submits that the three-year limitation period set forth in Article 10.18.1
of the TPA is not applicable to her claims. She rather contends that, by virtue of the
MEN provision enshrined in Article 12.3.1 of the TPA, she is entitled to benefit from
the more favorable five-year bar contained in the Colombia-Switzerland BIT.'7°
According to the Claimant, the Tribunal is entitled to apply the MFN clause contained

in Article 12.3.1 of the TPA, since it has jurisdiction over all the substantive
provisions of Chapter 12 of the TPA.1%°

179. In reliance on the expert report of Olin L. Wethington‘s’, the Claimant argues that
the MFN clause in Article 12.3.1 of the TPA is a broadly worded provision that
captures more favorable procedural as well as substantive treatment extended by
Colombia to investors of other states. According to the Claimant, dispute resolution
procedures, being part and parcel of the modern investment protection regime, must
be regarded as a key aspect of the treatment of foreign investors.

180. According to the Claimant, the interpretation of Article 12.3.1 of the TPA in
accordance with Article 31 of the VCLT makes it plain that the MFN provision
extends to all “treatment”, including treatment with respect to procedural remedies.
In particular, the ordinary meaning of Article 12.3.1 supports Claimant's
interpretation, as it guarantees most-favored-nation “treatment”, in like
circumstances, without any other restriction. As the Claimant’s expert, Professor
Loukas Mistelis, emphasizes in his report:

Dispute settlement provisions by their very nature belong to the same
category as substantive protections for foreign investors. In other words,
the way a right is procedurally exercised is part and parcel of substantive
protection. 9?

In connection with the context of Article 12.3.1 of the TPA, the Claimant refers to
three other provisions of that treaty, which, according to her, provide investors with
comparable protections (the national treatment under Article 10.3; most-favored-
nation treatment under Article 10.4; and national treatment under Article 12.2). Yet,
these guarantees are limited to specified aspects of treatment, in contrast to the
general treatment guarantee of Article 12.3.1

In addition, the Claimant points out that a footnote to the MFN provision contained
in Article 10.4 of the TPA clarifies that it is not intended to “encompass dispute
resolution mechanisms, such as those in Section B [of Chapter 10], that are provided
for in international investment treaties or trade agreements.” Tellingly, the parties to
the TPA chose not to include a similar restrictive footnote to the MFN clause in Article
12.3, which is the clause that is contained in the TPA’s financial services chapter
and is relevant to this case. The logical consequence of such an omission, so the
Claimant argues, is that, unlike Article 10.4, Article 12.3.1 does extend to dispute

resolution.

The Claimant further invokes the Contracting States’ treaty practice, arguing that
they have expressly excluded dispute resolution from MFN provisions, whenever
they intended to do so.'*® Further, according to the Claimant, interpreting “treatment”
in Article 12.3.1 of the TPA to extend to treatment in connection with dispute
resolution proceedings is consistent with the TPA’s object and purpose, which is to
promote the protection of foreign investment.

For the Claimant, Colombia’s interpretation of Article 12.1.2(b) of the TPA, pursuant
to which that provision does not apply to the MFN clause, deprives the entire Chapter
12 of its conceptual content and practical application, reducing Article 12.3.1 to a

rights and duties that make up the legal concept of what property is”, and “the right to enforcement
is an essential component of the property rights themselves, [...] not a wholly distinct right.”).

right without a remedy, a result that “frustrates the workings, purpose and objectives
of that Chapter.”1°°

Thus, by virtue of the MFN provision in Article 12.3.1 of the TPA, Claimant insists
that she is not bound by the three-year time bar found in Article 10.18.1. Instead,
she claims to be entitled to invoke the more favorable treatment granted by
Colombia to Swiss investors under Article 11(5) of the Colombia-Switzerland BIT,
which provides a five-year limitation. 9”

The Claimant submitted this dispute to arbitration on 24 January 2018. Hence,
pursuant to the limitation period of the Colombia-Switzerland BIT, the cut-off date is
24 January 2013. According to the Claimant, the measure, which gave rise to this
treaty dispute was the 2014 Order, which denied the motions for annulment of the
2011 Decision. *%*

The Claimant refutes Colombia’s argument that the dispute arose no later than 28
July 2000, when Claimant's investment companies filed administrative proceedings
against the Superintendency and Fogafin before the domestic administrative courts.
According to her, the term “dispute” in Article 11(5) of the Colombia-Switzerland BIT
should not be construed broadly. Instead, the dispute should be understood as a
controversy involving the claim that the Respondent has breached the treaty. Such
a dispute could not have arisen until the challenged measure had occurred. Since
the TPA entered into force in 2012, there can be no dispute about the breach of that

treaty prior to that time.

In addition, the existence of prior State actions, says the Claimant, does not deprive
the Tribunal of jurisdiction ratione temporis. The existence of “background facts”
does not serve to accelerate the accrual of claims for the purposes of the limitation
period.'*? In this respect, the Claimant opposes what she calls the Respondent's

“invented” two-prong test, which requires the Claimant to show that the 2014 Order
“fundamentally changed the status quo of the Claimant's investment’, and that such
measure is “independently actionable” and can be “evaluated on the merits without
requiring a finding going to the lawfulness of pre-[treaty] conduct.”"#° According to
her, the three cases that Colombia cites in favor of this alleged test - Corona
Materials v. Dominican Republic, Eurogas v. Slovak Republic and ST-AD v.

Bulgaria‘“' - do not support the Respondent's position.

In any event, the Claimant asserts that the 2014 Order dramatically changed the
pre-treaty status quo by dismissing the petitions for annulment of the 2011 Decision
and thereby denying the Claimant her last avenue of judicial recourse. The
exceptional nature of the annulment proceedings does not change this outcome.
What matters is that the annulment petitions, if granted, would have had substantial
legal consequences, i.e., the reversal of the 2011 Decision and restoration of
Claimant's rights. 14?

For these reasons, the Claimant submits that Article 10.18.2 does not bar her claims

and that the present dispute falls within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

3. Analysis
Article 12.1.2(b), reads as follows:

Section B (Investor-State Dispute Settlement) of Chapter Ten
(Investment) is hereby incorporated into and made a part of this Chapter
solely for claims that a Party has breached Articles 10.7 (Expropriation
and Compensation), 10.8 (Transfers), 10.12 (Denial of Benefits), or
10.14 (Special Formalities and Information Requirements), as
incorporated into this Chapter.

This provision thus incorporates Section B on investor-State dispute settlement of
Chapter 10 of the TPA into Chapter 12 to make it available to investors of the
financial sector. Section B affords investors of one Contracting State the right to

submit an “investment dispute” against the other Contracting State to international
arbitration."4° This right comes with certain conditions and limitations that are
contained in the same Section B, and in particular in Article 10.18. One of these
limitations is found in Article 10.18.1, which establishes a time limitation for claims
in the following terms:

Article 10.18: Conditions and Limitations on the Consent of Each Party

1. No claim may be submitted to arbitration under this Section if more

than three years have elapsed from the date on which the claimant first

acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the breach alleged

under Article 10.16.1 and knowledge that the claimant (for claims

brought under Article 10.16.1(a)) or the enterprise (for claims brought

under Article 10.16.1(b)) has incurred loss or damage. “4
The Parties do not appear to dispute that Article 10.18.1 of the TPA is incorporated
by reference into Chapter 12 by way of Article 12.1.2(b) of the TPA, and rightly so.
As the language of Article 12.1.2(b) makes clear, Section B of Chapter 10 is
incorporated into Chapter 12 of the TPA “solely for claims that a Party has breached”
four specific provisions of Chapter 10. Hence, it is clear that Article 10.18.1, which
forms part of Section B of Chapter 10 and is entitled “Conditions and Limitations on
the Consent of Each Party’, is incorporated by reference as a limitation to the
Contracting States’ consent to arbitration under Article 12.1.2(b) of the TPA.

The Parties do not dispute that the date on which the Claimant “first acquired, or
should have first acquired, knowledge of the breach [...] or damage” cannot be later
than the date when the Claimant acquainted herself with the 2014 Order, i.e. shortly
after the Constitutional Court handed down the order on 25 June 2014.'*5 The
Claimant commenced this arbitration on 24 January 2018, '“° that is more than three
years after she first acquired knowledge of the alleged breach of the TPA. It follows
that, by the time the Claimant sought to accept Colombia's offer to arbitrate under
the TPA, that offer had been extinguished by operation of the limitation period set

out in Article 10.18.1 of the TPA. The consequence of this finding is that the disputing
Parties have not agreed to arbitrate the claims that form part of the present dispute.

Faced with this obstacle, the Claimant invokes Colombia’s offer to arbitrate included
in another treaty, namely the Colombia-Switzerland BIT,"4’ by virtue of the MFN
clause contained in Article 12.3.1 of the TPA, which reads as follows:
Each Party shall accord to investors of another Party, financial
institutions of another Party, investments of investors in financial
institutions, and cross-border financial service suppliers of another Party
treatment no less favorable than that it accords to the investors, financial
institutions, investments of investors in financial institutions, and cross-
border financial service suppliers of any other Party or of a non-Party, in
like circumstances. 4°
On the basis of this MFN clause, the Claimant wishes to substitute the three-year
period contained in Article 10.18.1 of the TPA with the allegedly “more favorable”
five-year period encompassed in Article 11.5 of the Colombia-Switzerland BIT, a
provision of the following content:

An investor may not submit a dispute for resolution according to this
Article if five years have elapsed from the date the investor first acquired
or should have acquired knowledge of the events giving rise to the
dispute. "49
Leaving aside the question whether an MFN clause can at all be used to displace
conditions of consent to arbitration, such as Article 10.18.1 of the TPA, there are two
separate reasons why the Claimant cannot overcome the jurisdictional obstacle that
she faces by virtue of the TPA’s MFN provision and Article 11.5 of the Colombia-
Switzerland BIT. The Tribunal will discuss each one in turn.

a. Article 12.3.1 is itself beyond the Tribunal’s jurisdiction

As the Tribunal explained at the outset of this section, the subject-matter scope of
Colombia's consent to arbitrate under Article 12.1.2(b) of the BIT is limited to four
substantive provisions of the TPA, namely Articles 10.7 (Expropriation and
Compensation), 10.8 (Transfers), 10.12 (Denial of Benefits), and 10.14 (Special
Formalities and Information Requirements). It follows that, even assuming that the

MEN clause could in principle be used for jurisdictional purposes, it would be of no
avail to the Claimant, since Article 12.3.1 is itself outside of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction,
not being among the four provisions of Chapter 10, to which Article 12.1.2(b) refers.
In other words, it is not within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to apply the MFN clause.

The Contracting States to the TPA concur with this interpretation. Colombia argues
that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to apply the Chapter 12 MFN clause, since “there
is no clause of the TPA that provides such jurisdiction,”'©° a view with which the US
agrees:
As a threshold matter, [...] no claim brought via Article 12.3.1 may be
brought by an investor against a State Party to the TPA. Thus, an MFN
claim brought via Article 12.3.1 alleging that a Party extended more
favorable treatment to a third-Party investor or investment than was
accorded to the investor or investment of the other Party cannot be the
subject of investor-State arbitration. 1°"
The Parties dispute whether the convergence of views between the US Submission
and Colombia's position in this arbitration constitute a subsequent agreement or
subsequent practice of the Contracting States regarding the interpretation of the
treaty within the meaning the VCLT’s rules of treaty interpretation, and in particular
of Articles 31.3(a) and (b):

There shall be taken into account, together with the context:

(a) Any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the
interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;

(b) Any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which
establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation; 1°
The Claimant acknowledges that “to the extent that a subsequent agreement or
subsequent practice exists, it would, of course, be taken into account by the Tribunal,
together with the context, in conducting the Tribunal's interpretive analysis.”°° She
adds, however, that a mere convergence of views in this arbitration does not amount
to subsequent agreement or practice in the meaning of the VCLT.

202. Incontrast, the US submits that “the concordant interpretations presented by the two
TPA Parties in this proceeding” can qualify as “as a subsequent agreement under
31(3)(a), as a subsequent practice under 31(3)(b), or both.”"* It adds that Article
31.3 of the VCLT is a mandatory provision, which obligates the Tribunal to take the
Contracting States’ subsequent agreements and practice into account. '®> Colombia
similarly puts forward that the Contracting States’ statements, including in the
context of contentious proceedings, constitute subsequent practice under Article
31.3(b) of the VCLT, insofar as they “contribute to the identification of an agreement

as to the interpretation of the treaty.”

203. The Tribunal notes that the ILC in its work on subsequent agreements and
subsequent practice expressed the view that “statements in the course of a legal
dispute” can constitute a subsequent practice insofar as they help establish the
Contracting States’ agreements as to the interpretation of the treaty.'®” That said, it
concurs with the Claimant that subsequent agreements and practice “cannot be
used as a means for modifying or escaping the Treaty's terms.”"5° However, in the
present case, the common position of the TPA Contracting States merely confirms
the clear language of Article 12.1.2(b), according to which the subject-matter scope
of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is limited to four substantive provisions of the TPA,
which do not include the MFN clause of Article 12.3.1.

the substantive provisions in Chapter 12 of the TPA, including Article 12.3.1. At the

Hearing, the Tribunal asked the Claimant to point to a textual basis in the TPA for
her argument. She responded that there were four such bases:
First, Article 10.22, the governing law. [...] Second, Article 12.3, MFN.
Third, Article 12.1.2(b). And fourth, the substantive provisions contained
in Chapter 12 itself.1°°
The Tribunal fails to find the basis for its jurisdiction to adjudicate claims concerning
Article 12.3.1 of the TPA in any of these four alleged sources.

First, Article 10.22 of the TPA provides that the Tribunal shall “decide the issues in
dispute in accordance with this Agreement and applicable rules of international law.”
This provision deals with the TPA Contracting States’ choice of the substantive law,
which tribunals shall apply to disputes that come within their jurisdiction pursuant to
the dispute settlement clauses of Chapters 10 and 12. It is a choice of law, not a
choice of forum clause. It does not provide the Tribunal with jurisdiction to adjudicate
claims concerning the entirety of the TPA or all rules of international law applicable
between the Parties. Such interpretation would lead to far reaching consequences,
vesting TPA tribunals with competence to settle practically any international law
dispute between the disputing parties. It would also render the limiting language of
Article 12.1.2(b) nugatory.

Second, Article 12.3.1 requires the Contracting States not to treat each other's
financial sector investors less favorably than those of third States. Nowhere does it
vest tribunals with jurisdiction over such less favorable treatment. If the mere
presence of a standard of protection in the TPA provided the treaty tribunal with
jurisdiction to adjudicate claims arising out of that standard, the limiting language of
Article 12.1.2(b) would be devoid of any significance.

Third, Article 12.1.2(b) of the TPA, which the Claimant also cites as a basis for
jurisdiction to apply the MFN clause, is clear: the Contracting States consent to
arbitrate their disputes with financial sector investors only in respect of breaches of
four provisions of the TPA, which do not include Article 12.3.1.

Fourth, the substantive provisions of Chapter 12 of the TPA cannot themselves

 

constitute a basis for the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. A contrary finding would obfuscate
the distinction between the law that governs the merits of a dispute and a tribunal’s

jurisdiction. To support her position, the Claimant submits that a “holistic and
comprehensive” interpretation of the TPA suggests that the investor's rights
contained in Chapter 12 must “provide investors with actual protection by virtue of
compensatory damages.”'® According to her:

[A] treatment protection standard has no practical remedial application if

it does not provide for the right to pursue compensatory damages arising

from its breach. "6
The Tribunal cannot share this interpretation. States routinely enter into international
treaties that contain obligations but no or limited mechanisms to adjudicate disputes
arising out of such obligations. It is axiomatic in international law that an adjudicatory
body, such as this Tribunal, cannot presume that a sovereign State has consented
to its jurisdiction. This is in particular corroborated by Article 25.1 of the ICSID
Convention, which requires written consent to arbitration. Hence, that consent is
contained in Article 12.1.2(b) of the TPA and it does not cover the MFN clause.

As a result, the Tribunal concludes that the MFN clause of Article 12.3.1 is beyond
its jurisdiction. Therefore, the Claimant cannot rely on this provision to substitute the
limitation period of Article 10.18.1 with that of the Colombia-Switzerland BIT.

b. The claims are in any event time barred under the Colombia-Switzerland BIT

Even if it were within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to apply the MFN clause, quod non,
and the latter allowed the Claimant to substitute the TPA’s limitation period by the
one of the Colombia-Switzerland BIT, the claims would still be time-barred. Article
11.5 of the Colombia-Switzerland BIT, which the Claimant purports to invoke, bars
the submission of a dispute to arbitration if more than five years have elapsed since
the investor first acquired knowledge of “the events giving rise to the dispute.”'®2
Thus, the Claimant would need to show that she became aware of these events only
after 24 January 2013.1

The only disputed measure that took place after this date is the 2014 Order. By the
2014 Order, the Constitutional Court confirmed its 2011 Decision. The 2011

Decision in turn reversed the Council of State’s 2007 Decision, and thus left the
consequences of the 1998 Measures unaltered. As discussed above, the claims in
this arbitration arise out of the 1998 Measures and possibly out of the 2011 Decision,
if one accepts that the 2007 Judgment may embody the investment.'®* The 2014
Order is not an independently actionable breach. In these circumstances, it would
be difficult to find that the Claimant learned about “the events giving rise to the
dispute” only after the 2014 Order.

The Claimant argues that the dispute arose after the 2014 Order, since the Parties
could not have been in dispute about a violation of the TPA prior to the TPA’s entry
into force in 2012. It is true that the Parties could not disagree over breaches of the
TPA before the TPA became effective. Yet, that does not mean that no
disagreement arose between them over rights arising from the measures
complained of well before the Treaty’s entry into force. As was mentioned earlier,
the 2014 Order did not give rise to an independently actionable breach of the TPA,
let alone to a new dispute. Moreover, even assuming for the sake of discussion that
the 2014 Order was an actionable breach in and of itself, this would still not turn it
into the event “giving rise to the dispute” within the meaning of Article 11(5) of the

Colombia-Switzerland BIT.

Furthermore, the Claimant's interpretation of the term “dispute” as a narrow notion
aiming specifically at a disagreement on a possible violation of the applicable treaty
is belied by Article 2 of the Colombia-Switzerland BIT. That provision states that it is
“not applicable to claims or disputes arising out of events which occurred prior to its
entry into force.”' If the term “dispute” were understood narrowly, as a
disagreement related to an alleged treaty violation, this provision of the Colombia-
Switzerland BIT would serve no purpose. Indeed, if “dispute” meant what the
Claimant suggests, there could be no “dispute arising out of events which occurred
prior to [the treaty’s] entry into force”, since pre-treaty events cannot give rise to a
treaty violation. The Claimant admits that much." Thus, if the Claimant's

interpretation of the term “dispute” was adopted, Article 2 of the Colombia-

Switzerland BIT would be regulating an impossible eventuality.

At the Hearing, the Claimant herself referred the Tribunal to what she called “the
cardinal rule of interpretation that ‘treaties, and hence their clauses, are to be
interpreted so as to render them effective rather than ineffective.”'®” The Tribunal
concurs that the principle of effet utile is applicable in treaty interpretation. °° Under
this principle, the Tribunal cannot accept the Claimant’s narrow interpretation of the

term “dispute” used in the Colombia-Switzerland BIT.

The Tribunal finds support for its reasoning in the jurisprudence of investment
tribunals. ATA v. Jordan is instructive here.'®° Prior to the entry into force of the
applicable Turkey-Jordan BIT, the Jordanian Court of Appeal had annulled a
commercial arbitral award that the claimant had obtained against a Jordanian State
entity. After the BIT entered into force, the Supreme Court upheld the Court of
Appeal’s decision. The tribunal rejected the claimant's argument that the Supreme
Court's decision had given rise to a separate dispute:
[C]laimant attempts to present a denial of justice as an independent
violation of the BIT and to invite the Tribunal to treat it as if it were
unconnected to the dispute in order to shift the moment of its occurrence
forward and to locate it in time after the entry into force of a BIT.
The ATA tribunal's analysis is relevant here, considering that Article 11(5) of the
Colombia-Switzerland BIT refers to the occurrence of “the events giving rise to the
dispute” as the point from which the five-year limitation period starts to run.

Similarly, the tribunal in Lucchetti v. Peru, faced with pre- and post-treaty measures,
sought to determine whether such measures formed part of the same legal
dispute.'”° According to the tribunal, “the critical element in determining the

existence of one or two separate disputes is whether or not they concern the same
subject matter.”'”' Applying this test, the tribunal went on to verify “whether and to
what extent the subject matter or facts that were the real cause of the disputes differ
from or are identical to the other.”"72

The 2014 Order did not alter the “subject matter” or “the real cause” of the dispute.
The Parties were engaged in the same legal dispute at least since Colombia adopted
the 1998 Measures against Granahorrar and the Claimant initiated a judicial
challenge against those measures before the Colombia’s administrative courts in
2000. The “subject-matter” and “the real cause” of that dispute has always been
Colombia’s treatment of the Claimant's interests in Granahorrar.

Assuming that the Claimant were correct that the present dispute could be divided
up, the logical watershed moment would be the time of the Constitutional Court's
2011 Decision. One might argue that the Council of State put an end to the Parties’
previous dispute concerning the 1998 Measures by its 2007 Decision and that the
Constitutional Court’s 2011 Decision thus gave rise to a new dispute, concerning
that Court’s alleged abuse of power by encroaching on the judicial mandate of the
Council of State. Yet, even under this assumption, which the Tribunal does not
accept, the Claimant would have acquired knowledge of such new dispute in 2011.
Hence, her claims would in any event be time barred under Article 11(5) of the
Colombia-Switzerland BIT.

As a consequence, the Tribunal finds that more than five years have elapsed
between the time which the Claimant acquired knowledge of “the events giving rise
to the dispute” and the commencement of this arbitration. Therefore, even if the
Claimant were entitled to rely on Article 11(5) of the Colombia-Switzerland BIT, her
claims would be time barred.

Having determined that the MFN provision of Article 12.3.1 is outside its jurisdiction,
and that the claims would be in any event time barred under the Colombia-
Switzerland BIT, the Tribunal can dispense with addressing whether Article 12.3.1
applies to substantive treatment only or whether it can also substitute jurisdictional

requirements such as Article 10.18.1 of the TPA. Indeed, this question becomes
irrelevant once it is clear that the limitation period of the Colombia-Switzerland BIT
does not assist the Claimant in overcoming the jurisdictional obstacles that her claim
faces in this arbitration.

By way of a summary, the Tribunal determined in the preceding two sections that
there are two grounds for declining its jurisdiction over the present dispute: the
claims lie beyond the temporal scope of the TPA and they are in any event time
barred under Article 10.18.1 of the TPA.

Therefore, for reasons of judicial economy, the Tribunal dispenses with analyzing
the Respondent’s objections to its jurisdiction ratione materiae and so-called
jurisdiction ratione voluntatis. It thus turns to the issue of allocation of costs of this
arbitration.

CcosTs
The Respondent’s Costs

The Respondent has submitted that it incurred the following costs: (i) USD 344,066
arbitration costs; (ii) USD 1,370,125 legal fees and expenses; '”° (iii) USD 43,246.36
expert fees;'’4 and (iv) USD 107,544.36 Colombia's personnel costs.17°

The Respondent argues that the Claimant should pay all of Colombia’s costs in
connection with this proceeding, which amount in the aggregate to USD
1,864,981.72, plus interest.1”°

173 In its Submission on Costs (footnote. 1), Colombia reserved its right to update this subtotal to
reflect fees and expenses not yet invoiced. The Tribunal notes that there has been no substantive
work involved after that submission and that none of the Parties has requested leave to update its
cost submissions.

3,468.5/USD 1 (i.e., the average exchange rate for 2020). Respondent's Submission on Costs,

175 The costs incurred by Colombia reflect time spent by personnel preparing documents, attending
strategy meetings, reviewing and commenting on draft submissions, and attending the hearing.
These costs have been converted from COP to USD at a rate of COP 3,468.5/USD 1 (i.e., the
average exchange rate for 2020). Respondent's Submission on Costs, footnote 3.

2. The Claimant’s Costs

arbitration costs; (ii) USD 2,351,332 legal costs; (iii) USD 334,981 costs of experts,

witnesses and consultants; and (iv) USD 11,106 in other expenses. ‘7

The Claimant seeks an award for such total costs in an amount of USD 3,066,485,
plus interest. 179

3. Analysis

Each Party seeks to recover the entirety of its costs related to this arbitration,

including legal fees and interest.
Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides as follows:

In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the
parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in
connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom
those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal
and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid.
Such decision shall form part of the award.
This provision gives the Tribunal discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration,
including attorney's fees and other costs, between the Parties as it deems

appropriate.

ICSID tribunals tend to award costs adopting allocations that range between two
main approaches."®° The first approach considers that ICSID costs should be
apportioned in equal shares and that each party should bear its own costs. The
second approach resorts to the principle “costs follow the event” according to which
costs are apportioned based on the relative success of the parties’ positions. In
between these two approaches, solutions vary depending on the weight the tribunal

177 In its Submission on Costs (para. 2), the Claimant reserved the right to seek costs incurred after
the filing of this submission. The Tribunal notes that there has been no substantive work involved
following this date and that none of the Parties has requested leave to update its cost submissions.

may place on various circumstances, including the conduct of the parties in the

arbitration and other parameters.

Here, the Tribunal considers that the circumstances which it should take into account
include the outcome of the dispute, the reasonableness of the Parties’ costs, and

the Parties’ procedural conduct.

As set out above, the Tribunal upheld the Respondent's objection to its jurisdiction,
with the result that the claims fail for lack of jurisdiction. The outcome of the dispute

therefore militates in favor of an award of costs against the Claimant.

Further, the Tribunal considers that the Respondent's legal fees and other costs are
reasonable in light of the number and complexity of the issues involved. They are
also considerably lower than those of the Claimant.

Finally, the Tribunal notes that both sides conducted the proceedings in an efficient
and professional manner. It emphasizes that the Claimant accepted the bifurcation
of the proceedings between jurisdiction and merits, which contributed to significant
savings in terms of costs considering the outcome.

For these reasons, in the exercise of its discretion, the Tribunal comes to the
conclusion that it is appropriate that the Claimant bear the entirety of the arbitration
costs and bear 50% of the Respondent’s legal fees and other costs, i.e.
USD 760,458.

The costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the
Tribunal’s Assistant and ICSID’s administrative fees and direct expenses, amount
to a total of USD 588,896.12 broken down as follows:
Arbitrators’ fees and expenses
Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler USD 108,465.20

Diego Fernandez Arroyo USD 68,698.33
Christer Soderlund USD103,500.00

Assistant's fees and expenses USD 64,820.00

ICSID’s administrative fees USD168,000.00
Direct expenses USD 75,412.59
Total USD 588,896.12

240. These costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in equal
parts.'®’ As a result, each Party's share of the costs of arbitration amounts to USD
294,448.06. Consequently, ICSID will reimburse 50% of the balance of advance
payments to each Party, and the Claimant shall pay USD 294,448.06 to the
Respondent.

241. Finally, the Tribunal notes that, while the Parties have claimed interest on costs, they
have not substantiated their claim nor otherwise provided any indication about
applicable rate, accrual date(s), compound or simple nature of the interest
computation. Therefore, the Tribunal will not award interest.

Vi. OPERATIVE PART
242. For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal renders the following award:
i. | The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the dispute before it;

ii. | The arbitration costs amount in total to USD 588,896.12 and shall be borne
by the Claimant, who shall thus pay USD 294,448.06 to the Respondent;

iii. | The Claimant shall pay to the Respondent the amount of USD 760,458 for
legal fees and costs incurred in connection with this arbitration.

181 The Parties’ advance payments were made in equal shares. The USD 25,000 difference in the
amounts claimed by each Party as arbitration costs corresponds to the non-refundable lodging fee
paid by the Claimant.
