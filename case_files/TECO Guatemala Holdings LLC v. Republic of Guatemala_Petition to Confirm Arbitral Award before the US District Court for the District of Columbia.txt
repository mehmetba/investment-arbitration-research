PETITION TO CONFIRM ARBITRAL AWARD

Petitioner TECO Guatemala Holdings, LLC (“TGH”), by and through its attorneys White

& Case LLP, submits as follows:
NATURE OF THE PROCEEDING AND RELIEF SOUGHT

1. Petitioner is commencing this proceeding to confirm an international arbitration
award (the “Award”) rendered in its favor on December 19, 2013, in TECO Guatemala
Holdings, LLC v. Republic of Guatemala, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/23, an international
arbitration proceeding before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes

(“ICSID”) (the Arbitration”), as modified by a subsequent decision on annulment rendered in

Case 1:17-cv-00102 Document 1 Filed 01/16/17 Page 2 of 10

the arbitration proceeding on April 5, 2016 (the “Annulment Decision,” and, together, the “Final

Award”), pursuant to 22 U.S.C. § 1650a and Article 54 of the Convention on the Settlement of

Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the “ICSID Convention”).

Certified copies of the Award and the Annulment Decision are attached as Exhibits 1 and 2,

respectively, to the Declaration of Andrea J. Menaker (“Menaker Declaration’’), attached hereto.
PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

2. Petitioner TGH is a company incorporated under the laws of the State of
Delaware, and a subsidiary of TECO Energy, Inc., a company incorporated under the laws of the
State of Florida.

3. The Republic of Guatemala (“Guatemala”) is a “foreign state” for purposes of the
Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1603.

4. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Guatemala pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
§ 1330(b), which provides that this Court can exercise personal jurisdiction over a foreign state
in an action with respect to which the foreign state is not entitled to sovereign immunity under 28
U.S.C. §§ 1605-1607.

5. Guatemala is not entitled to sovereign immunity under 28 U.S.C. § 1605, because
this case falls under the exception for cases brought to confirm arbitral awards that “are or may
be governed by a treaty or other international agreement in force in the United States calling for
the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards.” 28 U.S.C. §1605(a)(6).

6. Specifically, the Final Award is governed by the Convention on the Settlement of
Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the “ICSID Convention”), to
which the United States is a party, and which provides that “[e]ach Contracting State shall

recognize an award rendered pursuant to this Convention as binding and enforce the pecuniary

Case 1:17-cv-00102 Document 1 Filed 01/16/17 Page 3 of 10

obligations imposed by that award within its territories as if it were a final judgment of a court in
that State.” ICSID Convention, art. 54(1). The ICSID Convention also provides that the
provisions of ICSID Convention, art. 54 “shall apply mutatis mutandis to proceedings before the
Committee,” in other words, to decisions on annulment rendered by ICSID ad hoc committees,
such as the Annulment Decision. ICSID Convention, art. 52(4). In addition, the Final Award is
governed by the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (“DR-CAFTA”),
to which the United States is a party, and which provides that “[e]ach Party shall provide for the
enforcement of an award in its territory.” DR-CAFTA, art. 10.26.7.

7. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and pursuant to
Article 54 of the ICSID Convention, which, as noted above, directs contracting states to
recognize ICSID arbitral awards and enforce pecuniary obligations imposed thereunder as if they
were “a final judgment of a court in that State.” The United States is a contracting state to the
ICSID Convention and has adopted implementing legislation to give full faith and credit to
arbitral awards rendered under the ICSID Convention. See 22 U.S.C. § 1650a(a). Guatemala
also is a party to the ICSID Convention. See ICSID, List of Contracting States and Other
Signatories of the Convention (indicating that Guatemala signed the ICSID Convention on
November 9, 1995 and that the ICSID Convention entered into force for Guatemala on February
20, 2003), available at https://icsid.worldbank.org/en/Pages/about/Database-of-Member-
States.aspx. In the United States, the federal district courts have exclusive jurisdiction over
actions to enforce ICSID arbitral awards. 22 U.S.C. § 1650a(b).

8. Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(f)(4).

FACTS
The Parties’ Agreement

9. Guatemala announced the privatization of Empresa Eléctrica de Guatemala, S.A.
(“EEGSA”), the largest electricity distribution company in the country, in December 1997.
TECO Energy participated in the international public offering through its subsidiary, TPS de
Ultramar Guatemala, S.A. (“TPS”), in a consortium with Iberdrola Energia, S.A. and
Electricidade de Portugal, S.A. (collectively, the “Consortium”).

10. The Consortium formed Distribucién Eléctrica Centroamérica, S.A. (“DECA I’),
an investment company incorporated under the laws of Guatemala, of which TPS held 21
percent. DECA I was awarded the bid for EEGSA on July 30, 1998, and the closing took place
on September 11, 1998. After DECA I merged with EEGSA in 1999, the Consortium
incorporated DECA II under the laws of Guatemala to be the holding company. Through DECA
I and DECA II, the Consortium maintained an approximate 81 percent controlling interest in
EEGSA from 1998 until the sale of DECA II in October 2010.

11. In 2005, TECO Energy was restructured, and TPS’s shares in DECA II were
transferred to Petitioner, TGH.

12. Guatemala’s National Electric Energy Commission (the “CNEE”) publishes the
electricity rates for EEGSA and other distribution companies, in accordance with Guatemala’s
General Electricity Law and Regulations. The rates incorporate, among several components, a
Value Added for Distribution (“VAD”), through which distributors are compensated for
operating expenses and infrastructure, and are provided a fair return on their investments. The
VAD is recalculated every five years, after each distributor has submitted an independent study

on relevant VAD components, and the CNEE has reviewed the study.

Case 1:17-cv-00102 Document1 Filed 01/16/17 Page 5 of 10

13. The CNEE’s VAD review process for the 2008-2013 tariff period was the subject
matter of the arbitration brought by TGH against Guatemala for Guatemala’s violation of Article
10.5 of the DR-CAFTA, which resulted in the Final Award that is the subject of this Petition.

14. TGH argued that the VAD review process was arbitrary, unlawful, denied TGH
due process, was inconsistent with the principles set out in Guatemala’s General Electricity Law
and Regulations, and thus violated Guatemala’s obligation under Article 10.5 of the DR-CAFTA
to afford protected investments fair and equitable treatment. When the VAD for that tariff period
took effect, EEGSA’s financial performance deteriorated significantly. EEGSA suffered cash
flow losses, and DECA II eventually was sold at a depreciated value to Empresas Ptiblicas de
Medellin E.S.P. (“EPM”) in October 2010.

15. The DR-CAFTA includes a dispute resolution clause providing for arbitration
under the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the
“ICSID Arbitration Rules”).

Article 10.15 of the DR-CAFTA provides:

In the event of an investment dispute, the claimant and the respondent should

initially seek to resolve the dispute through consultation and negotiation, which

may include the use of non-binding, third-party procedures such as conciliation

and mediation.

Article 10.16 of the DR-CAFTA provides:
1. In the event that a disputing party considers that an investment dispute cannot
be settled by consultation and negotiation:
(a) the claimant, on its own behalf, may submit to arbitration under this
Section a claim

(i) that the respondent has breached
(A)an obligation under Section A,
(B) an investment authorization, or
(C) an investment agreement;

and

(ii) that the claimant has incurred loss or damage by reason of,
or arising out of, that breach; and

Case 1:17-cv-00102 Document1 Filed 01/16/17 Page 6 of 10

(b) the claimant, on behalf of an enterprise of the respondent that is a
juridical person that the claimant owns or controls directly or
indirectly, may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim

(i) that the respondent has breached
(A)an obligation under Section A,
(B) an investment authorization, or
(C) an investment agreement;
and
(ii) that the enterprise has incurred loss or damage by reason
of, or arising out of, that breach.

2. At least 90 days before submitting any claim to arbitration under this Section,
a claimant shall deliver to the respondent a written notice of its intention to
submit the claim to arbitration (“notice of intent’).
3. Provided that six months have elapsed since the events giving rise to the
claim, a claimant may submit a claim referred to in paragraph 1:
(a) under the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Rules of Procedures for
Arbitration Proceedings, provided that both the respondent and the
Party of the claimant are parties to the ICSID Convention;
(b) under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, provided that either the
respondent or the Party of the claimant is a party to the ICSID
Convention; or
(c) under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.
Arbitration before ICSID
16. On January 13, 2009, TGH filed a Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim to
Arbitration, in accordance with Articles 10.15 and 10.16 of the DR-CAFTA. On October 20,
2010, TGH filed a Notice of Arbitration before ICSID. The Notice provided that the claim was
being submitted under the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules, because both
Guatemala and the United States are parties to the ICSID Convention, and TGH is a national of
the United States and an “investor of a Party” as defined in the DR-CAFTA.
17. TGH sought an award of damages in the amount of US $243,585,335 plus
interest. Out of this amount, US $21,100,552 corresponded to TGH’s portion of the cash flow

EEGSA lost from August 1, 2008, when the VAD took effect, until October 21, 2010, when

TGH sold its ownership interest in EEGSA as a direct consequence of Guatemala’s breach of the

Case 1:17-cv-00102 Document 1 Filed 01/16/17 Page 7 of 10

DR-CAFTA (for ease of reference, “historical losses”), and US $222,484,783 corresponded to
the damages suffered by TGH as a result of the impaired value at which TGH sold its ownership
interest in EEGSA (for ease of reference, “loss of value’).

18. On December 19, 2013, the ICSID Arbitral Tribunal rendered the Award finding
Guatemala liable, and granting TGH damages for its historical losses in the amount of
US $21,100,552 plus interest on that amount at the US Prime rate plus two percent as from
October 21, 2010 until the date of full payment, compounded annually, and a portion of TGH’s
costs.

19. As of January 16, 2017, the awarded damages plus interest total US $29,116,553.

The Decision on Annulment

20. On April 18, 2014, TGH filed an application for partial annulment of the Award,
insofar as the Award denied TGH’s claim for compensation for loss of value arising from the
sale of TGH’s ownership interest in EEGSA on October 21, 2010, interest on historical losses
accruing in the period from August 1, 2009 until October 21, 2010, and TGH’s claimed interest
rate applicable to pre-award interest. Also on April 18, 2014, Guatemala filed an application for
annulment of the entire Award. The applications were filed pursuant to Article 52 of the ICSID
Convention and Rule 50 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.

21. On April 5, 2016, the ICSID ad hoc Committee rendered its decision on the
Annulment. As explained in the accompanying Menaker Declaration, the Committee denied in
its entirety Guatemala’s application for annulment of the Award and granted TGH’s petition for
partial annulment of the Award. The Annulment Decision upheld the Arbitral Tribunal’s
decisions on jurisdiction, liability, and the award of damages to TGH for TGH’s historical losses

amounting to US $21,100,552, plus interest on that amount at the US Prime rate plus two percent

Case 1:17-cv-00102 Document1 Filed 01/16/17 Page 8 of 10

as from October 21, 2010 until the date of full payment, compounded annually. The Annulment
Decision partially annulled the Award insofar as the Award denied TGH’s claims for
compensation for losses arising from the sale of its ownership interest in EEGSA and interest for
the period preceding the sale, as well as the Arbitral Tribunal’s ruling on costs. The Annulment
Decision also dismissed the portion of TGH’s request for partial annulment of the Award
concerning the interest rate applicable to pre-award interest.

22. As a result of the Annulment Decision, the unannulled portions of the Award,
including the award to TGH of US $21,100,552 in damages, plus interest on that amount
compounded annually at the US Prime rate plus two percent as from October 21, 2010 until the
date of full payment, have become final and binding upon Guatemala.

23. In its Decision on Annulment, the ad hoc Committee also ordered Guatemala to
pay to TGH US $273,652.39 incurred by TGH in contesting Guatemala’s application for
annulment, and to reimburse TGH for half of its costs of ICSID’s administrative fees and
expenses concerning TGH’s application for partial annulment (the latter amount becoming due
and payable 60 days after ICSID transmits the Final Financial Statement to the Parties). These
additional damages amount to US $284,791.46, half of which is US $142,395.73. More than 60
days have elapsed since ICSID transmitted the Final Financial Statement to the Parties on
October 20, 2016, and thus the entire amount awarded to TGH in the Decision on Annulment,
i.e., US $416,048.12 (calculated as one half of US $284,791.46, i.c., US $142,395.73, plus
US $273,652.39), has become due and payable to TGH. This amount is in addition to the above-
referenced amounts awarded to TGH in the unannulled portions of the Award.

24. As of the present date, Guatemala has failed to pay the amounts owed to TGH

pursuant to the Final Award. See Menaker Decl. {ff 11-15.

CLAIM FOR RELIEF

25. The United States and Guatemala are contracting states parties to the ICSID
Convention. 22 U.S.C. § 1650(a) provides that “[t]he pecuniary obligations imposed by [an
award issued pursuant to the ICSID Convention] shall be enforced and shall be given the same
full faith and credit as if the award were a final judgment of a court of general jurisdiction of one
of the several States.”

26. Article 54 of the ICSID Convention provides that “[e]ach Contracting State shall
recognize an award pursuant to this Convention as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations

27. Accordingly, pursuant to 22 U.S.C. §1650a and Article 54 of the ICSID
Convention, Petitioner requests that this Court confirm and recognize the Final Award.
Petitioner also requests that this Court enter judgment in favor of Petitioner and against
Guatemala in the amounts stated in the Award and the Annulment Decision.

28. Specifically, as explained above, under the terms of the Award, Petitioner is
entitled to damages in the amount of US $21,100,552, plus interest on that amount at the US
Prime rate plus two percent as from October 21, 2010 until the date of full payment,
compounded annually. As of January 17, 2017, the awarded damages plus interest total
US $29,116,553.

29. In addition, as also explained above, under the terms of the Annulment Decision,
Petitioner is entitled to reimbursement of US $142,395.73, representing half of its costs of
ICSID’s administrative expenses and fees related to its application for partial annulment of the
Award, and to US $273,652.39 in costs incurred by Petitioner in contesting Guatemala’s

application for annulment. These two amounts total US $416,048.12.
