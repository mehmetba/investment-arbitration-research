PROCEDURAL HISTORY
(COMMENCEMENT OF THE ARBITRATION

By letter dated 23 May 2008, the Claimant ‘notified the Russian Federation, through the
Russian Ministry of Justice, of its claims under the ECT, accepted the Russian
Federation’s offer to arbitrate and invited the Russian Federation to engage in settlement

discussions.”!

On 25 July 2008, the Ministry of Justice informed the Claimant that receipt of that notice

was not within the Ministry’s competence.”

On 27 August 2008, the Claimant forwarded that notice to the Government of the Russian

Federation and to the Administration of the President of the Russian Federation.

By Notice of Arbitration dated 15 February 2013, the Claimant commenced arbitration
proceedings against the Russian Federation pursuant to Article 26(4)(b) of the ECT and
the 1976 Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law
(the UNCITRAL Rules).*

CONSTITUTION OF THE TRIBUNAL AND PRELIMINARY PROCEDURAL MATTERS

By its Notice of Arbitration, the Claimant appointed Mr J William Rowley QC as the first
arbitrator. Mr Rowley’s address is 20 Essex Street, London WC2R 3AL, United
Kingdom.

of Appointment (17 February 2014) (Terms of Appointment), [4](a).

By letter to the Claimant dated 3 May 2013, the Respondent appointed Professor Brigitte
Stern as the second arbitrator. Professor Stern’s address is 7 rue Pierre Nicole, 75005

Paris, France.

On 8 October 2013, the Claimant requested that the Secretary-General of the Permanent
Court of Arbitration (the PCA) act as the appointing authority with regard to the
appointment of a presiding arbitrator, pursuant to Articles 6 and 7 of the UNCITRAL
Rules. In its submission, the Claimant stated that the Parties were ‘in agreement as to the
employment of the list-procedure referred to in Article 6(3) of the 1976 Rules..., but wish
for the list to be provided by the Secretary-General to include at least five names.’>

On 9 October 2013, the PCA proposed to the Parties the use of a modified list procedure,
allowing each of the Parties to eliminate a maximum of three names from a list of seven
and requiring each Party to rank by preference the remaining names. On 15 October 2013,

each of the Parties agreed to the PCA’s proposal.

In a letter of 4 November 2013, the PCA implemented the modified list procedure,
sending each Party a list of seven candidates who could be appointed as Presiding
Arbitrator, and, in separate letters of 19 November 2013, each Party submitted comments
to the PCA regarding the list of candidates.

On 22 November 2013, Professor Campbell McLachlan QC was appointed as Presiding
Arbitrator by the Secretary-General of the PCA. Professor McLachlan’s address is
Victoria University of Wellington, School of Law, Old Government Buildings,
55 Lambton Quay, Wellington, New Zealand.

By 18 February 2014, both Parties and all Tribunal members had signed the Terms of
Appointment, confirming that: (i) the members of the Tribunal had been validly
appointed in accordance with the ECT and the UNCITRAL Rules; (ii) the proceedings
shall be governed by the UNCITRAL Rules; (iii) the Tribunal shall determine the legal
seat of the arbitration in Procedural Order N° 1 after hearing the Parties on the issue;
(iv) the language of the arbitration shall be English; (v) the International Bureau of the

the ECT and applicable rules and principles of international law; and (vii) the arbitral
proceedings shall be held in private and all documents in these proceedings created for
the purpose of the arbitration as well as all other documents or evidence produced by
either Party shall be confidential, unless the Parties expressly agree in writing to the

contrary.

On 31 March 2014, each Party submitted arguments regarding the Tribunal’s
determination of the seat of the arbitration. The Respondent proposed Vienna, Austria or
Frankfurt, Germany, but indicated that it would also support the designation of Geneva,
Switzerland, or Paris, France. The Claimant proposed The Hague, the Netherlands, or
London, United Kingdom.

On 12 April 2014, both Parties, all Tribunal members and Mr Jack L W Wass signed the
Terms of Appointment of the Assistant to the Tribunal, confirming that Mr Wass would
be appointed as Assistant to the Tribunal on the terms set out therein. Mr Wass’ address
is Stout Street Chambers, Level 6, Huddart Parker Building, Wellington 6011, New
Zealand.

On 14 April 2014, the Tribunal convened a preliminary procedural hearing in Vienna,
Austria. At the hearing, the Tribunal heard the Parties regarding the determination of the
seat of arbitration and the issue of whether or not to bifurcate proceedings, and the
Tribunal and Parties discussed a draft Procedural Order N° | and the procedural calendar.

On 24 April 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order N° 1 (PO N° 1), in which it
determined, infer alia, that the seat of the arbitration shall be Geneva, Switzerland. The
Tribunal also decided to bifurcate the proceedings, setting forth a procedural calendar for
a preliminary phase during which three of the objections raised by the Respondent to the

constitution, laws or regulations”’;°

(ii) ‘[t]he intra-company loans allegedly made by Claimant to Yukos Oil Company

are not “investments” within the meaning of Article 1(6) ECT’;’ and

Parties confirmed that they had no further procedural matters to draw to the attention of

the Tribunal.?

In accordance with the Tribunal’s directions, the Parties exchanged submissions on costs
relating to the jurisdiction phase on 5 October 2015 and comments on the other Party’s

costs submissions on 19 October 2015.

On 17 May 2016, the Tribunal invited the Parties’ observations on The Hague District
Court Judgment in Action Nos C/09/477160 / HA ZA 15-1, C/09/477162 / HA ZA 15-
2 and C/09/481619 / HA ZA 15-112, which were duly provided by the Claimant on the
same date, and by the Respondent on 23 May 2016. On 26 May 2016, the Tribunal
decided to admit The Hague District Court Judgment into the record. It also advised that
it would consider the Claimant’s further submissions of 24 May 2016, and permitted the
Respondent to provide a reply, which it submitted on 31 May 2016.

On 18 January 2017, the Tribunal issued its Interim Award on Jurisdiction (the Interim
Award). The Tribunal decided that:

(1) | The Respondent’s provisional application of the Energy Charter Treaty under
the terms of Article 45(1) does include its consent to international arbitration
under Article 26(3)(a) (by majority).

(2) The Claimant does own an asset constituted by a debt of a company associated
with an Economic Activity in the Energy Sector in the Area of the Respondent
such that it has made an Investment to which the present dispute with the
Respondent relates (by majority).

(3) Citizens or nationals of a third State did not control the Claimant on 11 April
2014 when the Respondent sought to deny the Claimant the advantages of
Part III of the Energy Charter Treaty, such that the Respondent was not
entitled to invoke the provisions of Article 17(1).

(4) | The three objections to jurisdiction and admissibility raised by Respondent in
its Notice dated 11 April 2014 that the Tribunal set down for determination in
a preliminary phase by Procedural Order No 1 dated 24 April 2014 are
therefore dismissed (by majority in respect of objections (1) and (2)).

Any other objections to jurisdiction and admissibility are, pursuant to
Procedural Order No 1, joined to the merits.

The stay of proceedings on the merits ordered in Procedural Order No | is
lifted with effect from 28 days following the communication of this Interim
Award on Jurisdiction to the Parties.

The Tribunal shall thereafter fix by procedural order, after consultation with
the Parties, a revised timetable for further pleadings and a hearing on the
merits.

All costs of and occasioned by the hearing of these objections to jurisdiction
shall be reserved."°

Professor Brigitte Stern issued a dissenting opinion in relation to the first two issues, in

which she considered that:

(i)

(ii)

MERITS

Article 26 of the ECT cannot be introduced in the Russian legal order through
an administrative act and, therefore, cannot be provisionally applied on the
international level, and therefore the Tribunal has no jurisdiction ratione

temporis; and

The Claimant cannot be considered as having made an autonomous investment

and the Tribunal has no jurisdiction ratione materiae to deal with the case.

PHASE

On 20 February 2017, following the lifting of the stay of the proceeding on the merits

pursuant to the Interim Award, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties proposing a procedural

calendar for the phase on the merits. By letter of 22 February 2017, the Tribunal wrote

further to propose Lausanne, Switzerland, as the venue for the hearing on the merits (the

Hearing).

A number of discrete procedural matters arose during the merits phase of the proceedings,

which, in the interest of clarity, will be set out seriatim rather than strictly chronologically.

(i) Debevoise & Plimpton LLP had been appointed as counsel for the Respondent
in these proceedings, to replace Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP;

(ii) The Respondent had made an application to set aside the Interim Award (the
Set-Aside Application) before the Swiss Federal Tribunal and that the latter had
issued a Provisional Measures Order for the stay of the present arbitration

proceedings; and

(iii) The Respondent was ready to submit a formal application for the stay of the
proceedings should the Tribunal so require.

On | March 2017, the Claimant advised that: (i) it did not object to the stay of the
proceedings, subject to the Tribunal being permitted during the pendency of the Set-Aside
Application proceedings to decide on the venue of the Hearing and the provisional
schedule for the phase on the merits; and (ii) that it had no objection to Lausanne as the
venue for the Hearing subject to the assurance of safe passage of the Claimant’s witnesses

and client representatives.

By letter of 7 March 2017, the Respondent: (i) expressed its agreement with the
Claimant’s proposal concerning the stay of the proceedings; (ii) indicated its agreement
with Lausanne as the venue for the Hearing; and (iii) submitted several comments with

regard to the provisional timetable for the phase on the merits.

On 16 March 2017, following consultation with the Tribunal, the Parties wrote jointly to

the Swiss Federal Tribunal, indicating that:

(i) The Claimant consented to the stay of the arbitral proceedings requested by the

Respondent; and

(ii) The Parties had agreed that the Tribunal should in the interim be able to rule on

the place of the Hearing and the provisional timetable for the procedural phase

in the merits, which would only be applicable in the event the Set-Aside

Application was rejected.

On 10 August 2017, the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal to inform it that the Set-Aside
Application had been dismissed by the Swiss Federal Tribunal as premature, the Interim
Award having reserved several of the Respondent’s jurisdictional objections to the merits

phase.

2. Procedural calendar and written submissions

On 15 September 2017, the Parties jointly submitted an agreed procedural calendar for

the phase on the merits.

By letter of 4 October 2017, the Tribunal confirmed its agreement with the written phase
of the procedural calendar proposed by the Parties. Following an exchange of
correspondence between 12 and 25 October 2017, the Parties agreed that the Hearing be

held in Lausanne, Switzerland, between | and 12 July 2019.

Following a joint request by the Parties, by letter of 26 July 2018 the Tribunal confirmed
a further amendment to the procedural calendar and noted that ‘the written pleadings
phase will close on 7 May 2019”, and that ‘{nJo further slippage in the date for close of

written pleadings can be contemplated.”

Claimant provided explanations on the matter and confirmed it had completed the filing

On 25 March 2019, the Claimant informed the Tribunal and the Respondent that one of
its fact witnesses, Dr Andrei Illarionov, would not appear at the Hearing and that his

(iii) further ial relief and d to the procedural ti In its
application, the Respondent alleged, infer alia, that the Claimant had been ‘harassing’
one of Respondent’s witnesses, Mr Gololobov, referring to his inclusion on the ‘Free

On 16 April 2019, the Tribunal directed the Claimant to file its written response to the
Respondent’s application by 23 April 2019. On 19 April 2019, the Tribunal fixed the date
of Saturday 27 April 2019 for a procedural hearing by telephone conference on the

Respondent’s application.

On 23 April 2019, the Claimant submitted its response, in which it requested that the

R dent’s application for di of the procedural ti bie be dismissed

Le PP

On 27 April 2019, the Tribunal held a procedural hearing by telephone conference to

determine the Respondent’s application for postponement of the Hearing.

On 30 April 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order N° 10 (PO N® 10), in which it:
(i) decided that all references to Dr Ilarionov’s witness statements are expunged from the
record in this arbitration; (ii) ordered the Claimant to file and re-serve amended copies of
its Memorial and Reply omitting such references; (iii) granted the Respondent a one-week
extension for the service of its rejoinder submissions; (iv) extended the date for
notification of witnesses to be cross-examined at the Hearing; (v) otherwise dismissed the
Respondent’s application; and (vi) decided that the reasonable costs of and occasioned
by the Respondent’s application are payable by the Respondent in any event upon the
conclusion of the proceedings. In the course of its reasoning in PO N° 10, the Tribunal
found ‘no evidence on the record that might support the proposition that the Claimant or
its officers or agents are behind the inclusion of Dr Gololobov on the “Free Russia”
Website or that his inclusion on that Website is in any way connected with the present

>

case.

———
"2 The Respondent further indicated that it would shortly file an application “for provisional measures to protect

its witnesses from Claimant’s harassment”, but no such application was filed.

On 10 May 2019, the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal, advising that due to safe passage
concerns regarding the Claimant’s witnesses, the Parties jointly proposed that the Hearing

be moved to London, United Kingdom.

On 14 May 2019, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on the Merits, together with Second
Expert Reports of Professor Esakov (Esakov 2), Professor Pieth (Pieth 2) and Professor
Danon (Danon 2).

On 25 May 2019, a procedural hearing by telephone conference was held to discuss inter
alia the Parties’ joint request to transfer the venue for the Hearing. On 27 May 2019, the
Tribunal wrote to the Parties to advise that it acceded to their request to transfer the venue

for the Hearing from Lausanne to London.

On 28 May 2019, the Parties gave notice of the persons whose witness statements and
expert reports had been served by the other Party that were required to attend the Hearing
to give oral evidence. In particular, the Claimant notified inter alia that it required

Mr Gololobov’s attendance at the Hearing to be cross-examined.

On 3 June 2019, and in accordance with PO N° 10, the Claimant submitted amended
copies of its Memorial and Reply omitting references to Dr Illarionov’s witness

statements.

On 5 June 2019, the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal regarding ‘new submissions and
evidence’ included in the Rejoinder. It requested that the Tribunal grant it two additional
hours at the Hearing (taken from the Respondent’s time allocation) to allow its counsel
and its fact and expert witnesses to address such submissions and evidence. The

Respondent objected to this proposal.

On 7 June 2019, the Respondent wrote to advise the Tribunal and the Claimant that
Mr Gololobov would not be attending the Hearing. It alleged that this was as a result of
‘harassment’ from individuals who stand behind or are otherwise closely associated with
the Yukos Group. It invited the Tribunal to receive and consider Mr Gololobov’s written

evidence and afford it the weight it deemed appropriate.

On 11 June 2019, the Claimant replied to the Respondent’s letter, alleging that the
harassment allegation was a ‘smokescreen’ for Mr Gololobov’s absence. It requested an

order that Mr Gololobov’s statement should be disregarded.

On 14 June 2019, the Presiding Arbitrator held a pre-hearing telephone conference with
the Parties to discuss, inter alia, the schedule for the Hearing. The Presiding Arbitrator,
on behalf of the Tribunal, declined the Claimant’s application for two additional hours of
Hearing time, in view of the principle of equality of the Parties. He noted however that
the principle of equality does not prescribe equal Hearing time in a literal sense, and that
the Tribunal would ensure that the Claimant had a proper opportunity to examine its
witnesses on the new submissions and evidence as the principle of fairness and equality

require.

Further to the discussion at the pre-hearing telephone conference, on 24 June 2019 the

Parties submitted an agreed indicative schedule for the Hearing.

On 26 June 2019, and further to the Tribunal’s proposal, the Parties submitted an agreed

Dramatis Personae and Joint Chronology of Events.

Also on 26 June 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order N° 11 (PO N° if) on the
admissibility of the statement of Mr Gololobov. It found no evidence to support the
Respondent’s allegation that he had been harassed by or on behalf of the Claimant. It held
that basic principles of the equality of the parties and the right of a party to test the
evidence presented by the opposing party required that, in default (without a valid reason)

 

of the witness’s di for cro ination when req d, his is

inadmissible and must be excluded from the record.

On 27 June 2019, and in accordance with PO N° 11, the Respondent submitted amended
copies of its Counter-Memorial and Rejoinder omitting references to Mr Gololobov’s

witness statement.

3. Claimant's corporate reorganisation

Capital Limited’ (the Corporate Reorganisation). It did not provide the date of the

change in domicile in this communication.

The Parties exchanged correspondence and submissions between 17 January 2018 and
7 May 2018 with regard to the Corporate Reorganisation. In sum, the Respondent made
two applications concerning; (i) production of documents and provision of explanations
about the circumstances of the Corporate Reorganisation; and (ii) security for costs. The
Claimant provided certain information and documents in response and otherwise objected

to both applications.

On 18 May 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order N° 4 (PO Ne? 4) ruling on the
Respondent’s applications. The Tribunal ordered that:

@ The case intituling in these dings should be ded so that the

 

Claimant’s name shall appear as ‘Yukos Capital Ltd (formerly Yukos Capital
Sarl);

(ii) The Claimant was to provide the reasons for its Corporate Reorganisation and

for lack of disclosure thereof at the time it took effect;

(iii) The Respondent should pursue any further request for production of documents
on this matter alongside the document production requests on the merits as
provided in PO N° 3; and

(iv) The Respondent’s application for security for costs was adjourned pending the

completion of the steps set out in (b) and (c) above.

By its letter of 31 May 2018 and separate Statement of the same date by David A Godfrey,
director of Yukos Capital Ltd (formerly Yukos Capital §.a r.l), the Claimant gave an

explanation for its reorganisation.

Following an exchange between the Parties regarding an adjustment to the procedural
calendar, the Tribunal confirmed on 6 June 2018 that the procedural calendar had been

adjusted in accordance with the Parties’ agreement.

70. On 6 June 2018, the Respondent submitted comments on the Claimant’s letter and the
Statement of Mr Godfrey of 31 May 2018, and requested that the Tribunal order the
Claimant to provide an additional statement by Mr Godfrey. By letter of 15 June 2018,

the Claimant replied to these comments and objected to the Respondent’s request.

71. On 28 June 2018, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties rejecting the Respondents request that
a further statement be filed by Mr Godfrey.

4. Document production

72. Following the exchange of the first round of pleadings, the Parties made a simultaneous
exchange of requests for the production of documents as provided by PO N° 1. Following
the exchange of objections and responses, a number of requests remained outstanding.
The Parties submitted Redfern Schedules and introd cy on 31 August 2018,

 

 

and requested that the Tribunal make an order on those outstanding requests.

73. On 21 September 2018, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal with regard to ‘an issue
that has arisen between the Parties regarding their obligations under [PO N° 1] with
Tespect to documents relied upon by expert witnesses’ and requesting the Tribunal to
clarify the scope of such obligations. By letter of 28 September 2018, the Claimant

provided its response to the Respondent’s letter.

74. On 28 September 2018, the Tribunal issued its decision on the Parties’ requests for
production of documents in Procedural Order N° 5 (PON?®5).

75. Pursuant to PO N° 5 and by further agreement of the Parties, on 3 December 2018 the
Parties respectively submitted signed statements summarising the steps taken to comply
with PO N° 5,!3

 

'° Further to the deadline provided in PO N®S and following subsequent joint requests by the Parties, the Tribunal
granted extensions of the time period for production of documents to 15 November 2018 first and to 30 November
2018 afterwards. See PO N° 5, [33](2); Letter from the Tribunal to the Parties (18 October 2018); Letter from the

78. On 11 July 2018, the Respondent filed a Motion to Strike with its Counter-Memorial
requesting that the Tribunal strike from the record three sets of arbitral awards on which
the Claimant sought to rely, on the ground that these awards had been set aside by the

competent court at the place of arbitration in those cases. The three sets of awards were:

THE CLAIMANT

Yukos Capital was incorporated in Luxembourg on 31 January 2003 as a group finance
company to serve the needs of the wider Yukos group of companies (the Yukos
Group).”° At its formation, Yukos Capital’s direct parent was Yukos Finance BV (Yukos
Finance), a Dutch company owned by Yukos Oil. In 2005, Yukos Finance transferred
ownership of Yukos Capital to its subsidiary, Yukos International UK BV (Yukos
International), another Dutch company. Yukos Finance then delivered its shares in
Yukos International (in exchange for depository receipts) to a Dutch foundation, Stichting
Administratiekantoor Yukos International (the Stichting). Accordingly, the Stichting
wholly owns Yukos International and, through it, Yukos Capital.?!

On 4 August 2016, Yukos Capital S.a 1.1. merged with Miwok Wealth PIC Ltd (Miwok),
an entity incorporated in the BVI in 2014 also owned by the Stichting.” The Articles of
Merger provided that Yukos Capital S.a r.l. would be the merging company, and Miwok
the surviving company. On 1 September 2016, Miwok changed its name to Yukos Capital
Ltd, and on 8 February 2017 Yukos Capital S.a r.l. was struck off the Luxembourg
company register.”> This Corporate Reorganisation is relevant to the Respondent’s
objection to jurisdiction with regard to the Claimant’s status as a protected investor under
the ECT, and is discussed in that context below.”4

THE STRUCTURE OF THE YUKOS OIL BUSINESS

Yukos was privatised in the 1990s, and by the time of the events with which this

proceeding is concerned was one of the largest oil companies in Russia.

Yukos Oil itself (£e. Yukos Oil Company OJSC) was a holding company that held
interests in a number of onshore (Russian-incorporated) and offshore (foreign-

incorporated) companies.”

Among those subsidiaries, Yukos owned three primary oil production companies (the
Producti bsidiaries): Yt kneft (YNG), ft (SN) and
Tomskneft (TN).26 Yukos also owned a number of refining and trading companies, both

 

onshore (Russian-incorporated) and offshore (foreign-incorporated). These trading
companies purchased oil and refined petroleum products from Yukos production and

refining companies, and sold them to the market or to other Yukos subsidiaries.”

One of the principal offshore structures established by Yukos was known as the
Armenian Branch, because the principal holding company under Yukos Oil itself for
the Group companies in question, Yukos CIS Investments (Yukos CIS), was

incorporated in Armenia. It consisted of the following elements:

(i) Yukos CIS was incorporated in Armenia as a fully-owned subsidiary of Yukos
Oil;
(ii) Its fully-owned subsidiary was Yukos Hydrocarbons Ltd (incorporated in the

BVI) (Yukos Hydrocarbons);

(iii) Its fully-owned subsidiary was Brittany Assets Ltd (incorporated in the BVI)
(Brittany);

(iv) Brittany owned 10% of the share capital in Brill Management Ltd (incorporated
in the BVI) (Brill), the remaining 90% being owned by a trust known as the

“Stephen Trust’;

(v) Brill owned a number of other subsidiaries. Of most relevance for the present
dispute are two parallel chains of companies that terminated in Russian trading

companies:

i. Brill owned 10% of James Holding Venture Corp (incorporated in the
BVI) ( ,”° which in turn fully owned Dunsley Ltd (incorporated in
Cyprus) (Dunsley), which in turn fully owned OOO Ratibor (Ratibor),

one of the Yukos trading subsidiaries incorporated in Russia;

ii. Brill fully owned Moonstone Investments Ltd (incorporated in the BVI)
(Moonstone), which in turn fully owned Nassaubridge Management Ltd
(incorporated in Cyprus) (Nassaubridge) which fully owned OOO Fargoil

(Fargoil), another Yukos trading subsidiary incorporated in Russia.

Both Ratibor and Fargoil were incorporated in Mordovia, a low-tax region (or LTR)
established under Russian law that offered preferential tax arrangements to certain

investors.

The Armenian Branch is depicted on the following diagram:>°

Claimant to update the diagram at Counter-Memorial, [81]. The entities in white boxes were added by the Claimant

C. THE LOANS

106. The claims in this arbitration concern the treatment of two loans advanced by Yukos
Capital to Yukos Oil under agreements dated 2 December 2003 (the December 2003
Loan)?! and 19 August 2004 (the August 2004 Loan).

107. Each of the Loans was advanced with funds that were loaned to Yukos Capital by another
company in the Yukos Group: the December 2003 Loan was backed by a loan from

Loan was backed by a USD 355,000,000 loan from Hedgerow (the Hedgerow Loan).>4

108. Each of the Loans was back-to-back and non-recourse: the funds were advanced to Yukos
Capital for the express purpose of Yukos Capital advancing those funds to Yukos Oil,
and Yukos Capital was only liable to repay its lender when it was repaid by its borrower.
The terms and effects of the Loans were considered in detail by the Tribunal in its Interim

Award.3>

oe

The December 2003 Loan was drawn down progressively between 2 December 2003 and
28 June 2004, and the August 2004 Loan was drawn down on the day it was executed,*°

110, The Loans were among 26 loans that Yukos Capital made to Yukos Oil or its subsidiaries
between 2 June 2003 and 19 August 2004. In each case these loans were backed by loans

from another Yukos entity, in all but two cases being Brittany.>”

111.

As to the source of the funds:

(i) Itis common ground that the December 2003 Loan was funded primarily*® from
profits of oil trading activities, in particular that had accumulated in Russian

subsidiaries (Ratibor and Fargoil) and passed by way of dividends to their

Cyprus parents (Dunsley and Nassaubridge), to their parents in the BVI (JHV

and Moonstone), then to Brill and finally to Brittany.

At that point the Parties differ: the Claimant’s evidence is that the loans were
also sourced from fixed income debt investments and offshore investments;??
the Respondent submits that the entirety of the loans were derived from Fargoil
and Ratibor via Brill (described with Brittany as a ‘cash accumulation center’), °

and notes that there was no documentary support for the Claimant’s testimony.*!

112. As to the application of the funds:

(iii)

It is common ground that part (USD 0.9 billion) of the December 2003 Loan was
used to fund part of a USD 2 billion dividend issued by Yukos Oil (the so-called
giga-dividend).*? The dividend was declared on 28 November 2003* and the
December 2003 Loan was approved by Yukos Oil shortly thereafter.

Thus Yukos Oil’s bank statements record a payment of RUB 30.4 billion (USD 1
billion) on 5 December 2003, which the Respondent says represented the share
of the dividend due to Hulley, one of the shareholders in Yukos Oil. The same
day, Yukos Capital transferred RUB 26.0 billion (USD 0.9 billion) to Yukos Oil
under the December 2003 Loan.

The Parties agree that part of the funds advanced under the December 2003 Loan

could also have been used to redeem promissory notes. Beyond this, the record

(iv) The Claimant says that the giga-dividend was required to implement the merger
with Sibneft that had been completed on 3 October 2003, and in particular to
achieve a specified debt-equity ratio.“© The Respondent says that this is a
pretence and the giga-dividend was an ‘asset-stripping tool’.47 The Tribunal

returns to this issue below.*®

It is common ground that the Hedgerow Loan was funded by the sale of. Hedgerow’s 56%
interest in its subsidiary Rospan, and that the August 2004 Loan was used by Yukos to
pay part of the first tax re-assessment levied by the Respondent against Yukos Oil in the

circumstances described below.’?

D. THE YUKOs OIL TAX ASSESSMENTS

The first tax audit. Between October 2002 and March 2003, the Russian tax authorities
conducted a Field Tax Audit of Yukos Oil concerning the 2000 and 2001 tax years. The
resulting report was delivered to Yukos Oil on 28 April 2003.*3 Following the submission
of certain objections by Yukos Oil, the Inspectorate for the city of Nefteyugansk issued a
decision finding Yukos Oil liable for certain limited tax offences,™ requiring a total
payment of RUB 8,936,233.22 by Yukos Oil.*> Subsequently, by certificates of 19

Maintenance Tax.*’ Following the submission of certain objections by Yukos Oil, the

Deputy Minister for Taxes and Duties of Russia issued a resolution on 14 April 2004

whereby it held Yukos Oil liable for intentional non-payment of tax (the 2000 Tax

Assessment). ** The 2000 Tax Assessment required a total payment of RUB

99,375,538,234.40, °° which in turn was comprised of (i) RUB 47,989,241,953 in

indebted taxes, (ii) RUB 19,195,696,780 in fines and (iii) RUB 32,190,599,501.40 in

default interest. A resolution of the Ninth Arbitrazh Court of Appeal released on 23
November 2004 confirmed the 2000 Tax Assessment.§!

117. In brief, the 2000 Tax Assessment determined that the ‘Yukos Tax Arrangement’—and

oa

in particular its onshore structure—was ‘an illegal tax evasion scheme’ using ‘fake
organizations’ registered in low-tax regions and involved in the ‘oil and after-product
movement chain’.®* These corporations retained the revenue resulting from the sale of oil
and refined products to utilise certain tax preferences. According to the December 2003
audit, Yukos Oil was the ‘true owner of the oil and after-products’ and the entity in control

of their purchase, transfer and sale. Consequently, the 2000 Tax Assessment concluded

Tax Assessments. '!? Yukos Oil again filed an unsuccessful petition for voluntary
enforcement on 16 December 2004, requesting that the 7% enforcement fee not be

collected.'”°

136. On 17 December 2004, the Bailiffs Department notified tax authorities on the status of
the enforcement proceedings. '2! In sum, Yukos Oil was acknowledged to have
voluntarily or coercively paid RUB 117,112,769,476.26 (approximately USD 4.21
billion),!22 while a total of RUB 344,222,156,424.22 remained to be collected under the
enforcement proceedings for the 2000-2003 Tax Assessments.

137. The 2004 Tax Assessment. There are no formal payment demands on the record pertaining
to the 2004 Tax Assessment.'23 However, the Russian courts permitted the inclusion of
the claims of the Russian Federal Tax Service (the Federal Tax Service) in Yukos Oil’s
Register of Creditors’ Claims (the Register of Creditors), recognising liabilities of

around RUB 66 billion in tax arrears and interest and RUB 42 billion in penalties.'**

Tax Assessment.'?° At the request of Yukos Oil, Russian authorities accepted to conduct

the sale of YNG by public auction. !76

139. On 12 August 2004, the international investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein
(DKW) was appointed to carry out the valuation of the seized YNG participation. !27
DKW provided its report on 6 October 2004 (the DKW Valuation), concluding that the
total share capital of YNG had an estimated value between USD 18.6 and 21.1 billion.
The report noted that, if present or future tax and environmental liabilities were accounted
for, the estimated value could be reduced to a range between USD 15.7 and 18.3 billion.'78
Several alternative valuations, including one commissioned by Yukos Oil, provided

ranges generally in line with the DK W Valuation. !2°

140. While YNG’s market value was being determined, YNG was itself subject to further tax
reassessments by the Russian authorities amounting to approximately USD 4.6 billion.
These assessments concerned the 2001-2003 tax years and were primarily based on

transfer pricing violations under Article 40 of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation.

dismissed the claims.'“* Yukos Oil’s bankruptcy application in the United States was

rights under the B Loan were eventually transferred to Moravel Investments Ltd, a

company associated with the Yukos Oil shareholders, !5!

148. The Western Banks raised concerns about Yukos Oil’s ability to repay the Syndicate
Loan, '** Between May and June 2004, Yukos Oil made some prepayments '53 and
provided guarantees for the Syndicate Loan and the B Loan through YNG and other
Production Subsidiaries.'** On 2 July 2004, the Western Banks declared an Event of
Default under the Syndicate Loan, '55 but eventually agreed to rely on the security
mechanisms. '* Following the auction of YNG, Yukos Oil stopped making payments
under the Syndicate Loan.'57 As a result, the Western Banks filed a claim against Yukos
Oil for the outstanding debt under the Syndicate Loan (amounting to
USD 472,787,663.10), which was recognised by the High Court of England and Wales
on 24 June 2005 (the English Judgment). !58

149, The Western Banks sought to enforce the English Judgment before Dutch courts,
referring to Yukos Oil’s shares in Yukos Finance. The Western Banks argued that, due to

153. In parallel, YNG (by then a subsidiary of Rosneft) submitted a separate bankruptcy
petition against Yukos Oil, which was accepted for consideration on 27 March 2006.!67
On 29 March 2006, the Moscow Arbitrazh Court commenced bankruptcy proceedings on
the basis of the Syndicate Loan and formalised the replacement of the Western Banks by
Rosneft as the applicant.'S* By the same Ruling, Mr Eduard K Rebgun was appointed as
‘temporary receiver’ of Yukos Oil.

154. The bankruptcy declaration. The bankruptcy proceedings began as a ‘supervision
procedure’, with Mr Rebgun being required to convene a meeting with the creditors of
Yukos Oil to determine whether the company should be declared bankrupt or to consider
alternative plans of viability, In advance of this meeting, which was originally scheduled
for 16 June 2006, Yukos Oil approved a financial rehabilitation plan (the Rehabilitation
Plan) that would, in principle, allow the company to satisfy its debts within two years

while remaining a going concern. The Rehabilitation Plan provided, inter alia:

(i) A separate cash pool, to be funded mainly from the sale of ancillary and non-
Core assets, would be created for payment of several claims originating in Russia,
including those of tax authorities and YNG;

(ii) The claims arising from the Syndicate Loan and the B Loan (as well as other

. The creditors’ meeting eventually took place on 20 and 25 July 2006, with twenty-four
creditors holding participation and voting rights.!™ The report prepared by Mr Rebgun
estimated that the total value of Yukos Oil’s assets, following the application of profit tax
to be incurred in their sale, was around RUB 458.7 billion, while the claims admitted to
the bankruptcy proceedings amounted to RUB 491.2 billion.'® Particularly, Mr Rebgun
concluded that even in the scenario that current loss-free operations were possible, ‘the

oil company’s solvency is impossible to restore.’ !76

159. Atthe creditors’ meeting, Yukos Oil defended the viability of the Rehabilitation Plan and
the solvency of the company, arguing that Mr Rebgun’s valuation was misguided.'77
However, the creditors rejected considering the Rehabilitation Plan and voted in favour
of filing a petition requesting that Yukos Oil be declared bankrupt. Both decisions were
approved with the favourable vote of only four of the twenty-four creditors, which held
93.87% of the claims and thus necessarily included the largest creditors of Yukos Oil: the
Federal Taxation Service, Rosneft and YNG.!8

its liquidation and appointed Mr Rebgun as receiver of the company.'”?

H. THE LIQUIDATION OF YUKOS OIL

163. On 23 October 2006, a consortium of appraisal firms led by ZAO Roseco was selected
for making the inventory and evaluation of Yukos Oil’s assets.”°* In the report submitted
after the conclusion of the liquidation, Mr Rebgun recorded the accumulation of a
bankruptcy estate totalling RUB 877 billion (approximately USD 35.55 billion) from the

sale of Yukos Oil’s assets.?

164. Yukos Oil’s assets were divided into 20 different ‘lots’ and progressively auctioned
between March and August 2007, under the organisation of the RFPF and the supervision

of Mr Rebgun.?"° The sale of some of the most relevant assets resulted as follows:

(i) On 27 March 2007, Lot 1 containing Yukos Oil’s remaining 9.44% stake in YNG
was sold for USD 7.59 billion to Rosneft’s subsidiary OOO RN-Razvitiye;?"'

(ii) On 4 April 2007, Lot 2 containing a 20% stake in Gazpromneft and three minor
Production Subsidiaries was sold for USD 5.83 billion to OAO EniNeftegaz, a

IV. JURISDICTIONAL OBJECTIONS
A. INTRODUCTION
1. Tribunal’s consideration in Interim Award on Jurisdiction

168. The Tribunal begins by recalling its decision, in PO N° 1, that it would address three of

 

the Respondent’s jurisdictional objections in a preliminary phase, and join any other
objections to jurisdiction or admissibility to the merits, 72° The three jurisdictional
objections accordingly determined by the Tribunal in its Interim Award dated 18 January

2017 were:

a That ‘[t]he Russian Federation never ratified the ECT and applied the ECT until
October 18, 2009 on a provisional basis pursuant to Article 45(1) ECT only “to
the extent that such provisional application is not inconsistent with its

constitution, laws or regulations”;

(ii) That ‘[t]he intra-company loans allegedly made by Claimant to Yukos Oil

Company are not “investments” within the meaning of Article 1(6) ECT’; and

(iii) That, ‘[s]ince Claimant is a shell company with no substantial business activities
in Luxembourg and is ultimately controlled by nationals of a third State,
Respondent is entitled to deny Claimant the advantages of Part Ill of the ECT
pursuant to Article 17 ECT’!

The Tribunal rejected the first and second of these objections by majority, and the third

unanimously.

2. Remaining jurisdictional objections

169. In the present phase of the arbitration, the Respondent raises a number of further
objections on which basis it submits the Tribunal should decline jurisdiction. The

jurisdictional objections now advanced are:
(i) That the Loans were illegal under international law;
(ii) That the Loans were illegal under domestic law;

(iti) That the Claimant does not qualify as a protected investor under Article 1(7) of
the ECT in light of its corporate structure and current nationality;

(iv) That the current proceedings are an abuse of process; and

(v) That the Claimant’s claim is excluded by virtue of the tax carve-out in Article 21
of the ECT.

17

S

Grounds (iii) and (v) raise discrete points as to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction and can
conveniently be considered and determined in this section. The Respondent’s
jurisdictional objections based upon illegality (objections (i) and (ii)) raise issues that are
intertwined with the facts relevant to the merits and therefore fall to be considered in
connection with the Tribunal’s analysis of liability. The claim of abuse of process
(objection (iv) specifically concerns the questions whether the present proceedings seek
recovery for a loss that was foreseeable when the investment was made or alternatively
seek abusively to achieve double recovery. Without prejudice to the character of this
objection, the Tribunal finds it convenient to consider its implications in connection with

the facts relevant to causation and compensation in Parts VII and VIII below.

B. OBJECTION (II): CLAIMANT’S STATUS AS PROTECTED INVESTOR
1. The Respondent’s position

171,

The Respondent submits that the Claimant does not qualify as a protected ‘investor’ under
Article 1(7) of the ECT, on the basis that: (i) Yukos Capital is a shell company controlled

by Russian nationals; and (ji) that Yukos Capital is no longer a national of an ECT

Contracting State.””? Each of these submissions will be set out in further detail below.

Asa preliminary point, the Respondent contends that it is not precluded from raising new
objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and the admissibility of the Claimant’s
claims, arguing that the record demonstrates that it intended to raise several objections to
jurisdiction and that the Interim ‘Award was limited in scope to specific objections.?” In
particular, it contends that Article (7) was not at issue in the jurisdiction phase of the
proceedings, and that any findings in the Interim Award relating to the Claimant’s status
as an investor under the ECT are limited to the objections at issue in that phase.” In any
event, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal would have the power to reconsider any

findings it may have made in its Interim Award that it considers were premature or

incorrect.2°

Turing to its substantive objection, the Respondent first submits that the ECT does not
protect investments made by host States’ own nationals (‘round-trip investments),
arguing that a proper contextual reading of Article 1(7) in light of the object and purpose
of the ECT mandates that its provisions should only be applied to protect investments by
foreign investors.2”° In relation to context, the Respondent refers to various provisions of
the ECT referring only to investors of ‘another’ Contracting Party without reference to
Article 1(7),22” as well as Article 17 (excluding investments made by third-State nationals
from ECT protection), which it submits should apply a fortiori to shell companies owned
by nationals of the host State228 It also refers to an understanding adopted by the ECT

Contracting Parties, which envisages a factual determination of ‘control’ to ascertain

whether an investor is controlled by ‘another’ Contracting Party to the ECT.?29 It submits

that this understanding, along with the other provisions of the ECT referred to, provides

contextual support for the interpretation of ‘investor’ in Article 1(6) to exclude investors
of the host State.?3°

174. In relation to the object and purpose of the ECT, the Respondent contends that the ECT
is intended to promote and protect foreign, cross-border investment, in particular by
Western investors in the former USSR, thereby excluding host-State investments.23! It
refers to various references in Article 2 of the Treaty to ‘political and economic
cooperation’, ‘complementarities’, ‘mutual benefits’, the ‘flow of investments and
technologies’, and the desire to provide a ‘stable, transparent legal framework for foreign
investments’. It also refers to the Final Act of the European Energy Charter
Conference, to which the text of the ECT was appended, which states that the Treaty was
“designed to promote East-West industrial co-operation by providing legal safeguards in
areas such as investment, transit and trade’, and submits that the promotion of ‘round-

trip’ investments falls outside the object and purpose of the ECT. 233

175. The Respondent submits that international law principles further support its interpretation
of Article 1(7) of the ECT as excluding ‘round-trip’ investments.” It submits that two
fundamental principles are widely recognised by arbitral tribunals and national courts
(and there is no evidence that the ECT’s Contracting Parties intended to derogate from
them), being that the investment treaty regime is not intended to provide domestic

investors with recourse against their home States,>5 and that international law recognises

only a beneficial or substantive owner, not the formal and legal owner of an investment.*
It refers to cases where tribunals have denied claims where an investment is owned or
controlled by nationals of the host State, noting that in such cases meeting the formal

definition of investor is not sufficient to extend investment treaty protections.?>”

176. The Respondent also draws upon the subsequent State practice of a large number of ECT
Contracting Parties to submit that ‘round-trip’ investments fall outside Article 1(7) of the
ECT.3® By way of example, the Respondent points to the EU-Canada Free Trade
Agreement between Canada, the European Union, and EU Member States, which
excludes shell companies from the scope of treaty protection.” The Respondent also
points towards the 2014 consultation notice to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment
Partnership which expressly excludes that shell companies and those without ‘substantive

business operations in the territory of one of the Parties could qualify as an “investor”,’%°

177. With this in mind, the Respondent submits that, although officially incorporated in
Luxembourg, Yukos Capital was at all times beneficially owned and controlled by
Russian nationals for illicit purposes.”' It argues, inter alia, that Yukos Capital was
managed and controlled from Moscow by the ‘Yukos Oligarchs’, its banking was
conducted from Russia, it has no physical presence, no business activity, no significant
assets or employees in Luxembourg, its ultimate holding company (the Stichting) was
under the control of the ‘Yukos Oligarchs’, and the ‘Yukos Oligarchs’ currently control

the Claimant through a kickback agreement revealed in 2015.2

178. Further, the Respondent argues that the abuse of Yukos Capital’s corporate structure
warrants lifting the corporate veil to expose the Russian national investors beneath.” It
submits that it is a fundamental principle of international law, supported by international
jurisprudence and decisions of numerous arbitral tribunals, that an abuse of the corporate
structure through illegality or fraud warrants piercing the corporate veil.” In the
Respondent’s submission, the conduct of the Russian nationals in the present case is
especially egregious, given that the corporate form of the Claimant was not abused simply
to gain access to the investment treaty dispute resolution mechanisms, but also to further
acriminal enterprise.° The Respondent therefore contends that the Tribunal should lift
the corporate veil and deny the Claimant, as a shell company controlled by Russian
nationals, the protections of the ECT.” It also refers to the Claimant’s submission that
the Respondent has waived all veil-piercing arguments due to its counsel’s comments at
the Hearing on Jurisdiction,?*” and contends that such comments cannot satisfy the legal

standard that waiver of arguments must be express or unequivocally implied.”4*

Second, and in the alternative, the Respondent contends that Yukos Capital lost its
qualifying Luxembourg nationality due to its ‘change of domicile’ and merger into a BVI
entity in 2016." It contends that it is a long-established rule of international law that a
claimant must hold continuous nationality in a contracting State of the relevant treaty

decisions in arbitrations from the first half of the twentieth century.?5' The Respondent
therefore submits that the Corporate Reorganisation terminated Yukos Capital’s rights

under the ECT.

2. The Claimant’s position

The Claimant’s principal response to the Respondent's case on Article 1(7) of the ECT is
that the issues raised by the Respondent are res judicata. However, in the event the
Tribunal finds otherwise, the Claimant submits that Yukos Capital is under the control of
the Stichting and that the ‘Yukos Oligarchs’ never exercised any degree of control over
Yukos Capital or the Stichting. It also rejects the Respondent’s arguments regarding the
Claimant’s Corporate Reorganisation, contending that the relevant date for jurisdiction

purposes is the date of commencement of proceedings.

First, the Claimant argues that the Respondent made a considered choice not to present a
jurisdictional argument based on Article 1(7) in the jurisdiction phase of these
proceedings, 5? and submits that the same is the case for arguments relating to the
Claimant as a shell company and piercing the corporate veil.?§* It contends that the
Respondent has already accepted that the Claimant is an ‘investor’ for the purpose of
Article 1(7) of the ECT and controlled by the Stichting, and that its current submissions
regarding ‘round-trip’ investments and shell companies are a flagrant disregard for the
Tribunal’s Interim Award and the arbitral process.” It also argues that any objections
that the Respondent expressly disclaimed or which should have been made in the

jurisdictional phase should be rejected, on the ground that they were not made as early as

Article 32(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules which provides that awards are final and binding

on the parties, which it submits applies to the Interim Award.?°”

182. The Claimant then responds to the Respondent’s substantive jurisdictional objection,
arguing that the Respondent’s interpretation of Article 1(7) is flawed.?** It argues that
there is no basis to depart from the ordinary meaning of the provision or to read words
into Article 1(7), and that the Respondent’s contextual argument is circular since the
provisions it invokes refer the reader back to the definition of investor in Article 1(7).?°°
It also contends that the reference to the Contracting Parties’ ‘understandings’ relates to
Article 1(6) of the ECT, which is res judicata by virtue of the Interim Award.?©

183. The Claimant characterises the Respondent’s reliance on purported subsequent practice
of the ECT’s Contracting Parties as ‘particularly disingenuous’ since the instruments
referred to by the Respondent do not have the same Contracting Parties as the ECT and
do not establish the agreement of the ECT’s Contracting Parties regarding the ECT’s
interpretation. 6! Finally, and with reference to the evidence of Mr Misamore, the
Respondent contends that the ‘Yukos Oligarchs’ did not exercise any degree of control

over Yukos Capital or the Stichting.”

184. In respect of the Respondent’s contention that the Claimant’s Corporate Reorganisation
has caused the Claimant to lose standing before this Tribunal the Claimant submits that it

made by reference to the date the proceedings are instituted.” It argues that there is
nothing in the ECT that requires an investor to maintain continuous nationality between
the commencement of proceedings and the date of the award, and that such a requirement
could require an investor to ignore all commercial and legal realities that might warrant a
change in domicile throughout the duration of the proceedings (which might take many
years to conclude).” It submits that the Claimant was a Luxembourg entity (as Yukos
Capital S.a 1.1.) between its date of incorporation and until 2016, which it submits covers
the date the investments were made, the date alleged violations of the ECT occurred, the
date losses were sustained and the date the proceedings were instituted.” For
completeness, the Claimant contends that the BVI entity (Yukos Capital Ltd) is the owner
of all rights and property of Yukos Capital S.ar.l., including the investment,” and that

the Stichting remains in control of the Claimant despite its Corporate Reorganisation.”

3. The Tribunal’s analysis

Res judicata, The Tribunal approaches the Respondent’s objection to its jurisdiction
under Article 1(7) as a new objection. It does not consider that the Respondent is
precluded generally from bringing this objection on the ground of res judicata. When the
Tribunal decided to bifurcate these proceedings, it did so on the basis that this was to
enable three specific objections to jurisdiction, enumerated in [2.1] of PO N° 1, to be
determined in a preliminary phase. The third such objection (as formulated in the

Respondent’s letter dated 11 April 2014 and provided in [2.1](c)) was:

Since Claimant is a shell company with no substantial business activities in
Luxembourg and is ultimately controlled by nationals of a third State, Respondent is
entitled to deny Claimant the advantages of Part III of the ECT pursuant to Article
17 ECT.

Yukos Capital v Russia

Page 66 of 303

The Tribunal went on to provide in [2.2] of PO N° I that: ‘Any other objections to

jurisdiction or admissibility... are to be joined to the merits.’

The objection that the Respondent now advances is brought under Article 1(7) ECT. The
Respondent submits that an ‘Investor’ for the purpose of the Treaty does not include a
company that, though ‘organized in accordance with the law applicable in [another]
Contracting Party’, is controlled by nationals of the Contracting Party in which the
investment was made. This objection does involve the question of the control of the
Claimant, the significance of which the Tribunal will explain below. Nevertheless, it
proceeds under a different provision of the ECT and engages the significance vel non of

alleged contro! by nationals of the host State, not a third State.

Further or alternatively, the Respondent alleges that, whatever may have been the
previous position, as a result of the Corporate Reorganisation carried out by the Claimant
since the Hearing on Jurisdiction, it has ceased to be organised in accordance with the
law applicable in another Contracting Party. On any view, this objection could not be
precluded by a plea of res judicata since it relates to facts and matters that arose after the
Hearing on Jurisdiction and were not available to be considered by the Tribunal in its
Interim Award.

The statements that the Respondent’s counsel made at the Hearing on Jurisdiction are to
be read in this light. The Chairman specifically referred Respondent’s counsel to
Article 1(7) in the course of the Hearing and asked whether its definition of ‘Investor’
affected her analysis. She replied:
To be clear, Respondent does not object on the basis of Article 1(7) ECT to the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction at this stage.”
The understanding that this statement was limited to the issues that had been bifurcated
and was without prejudice to any subsequent objection that might be raised at a later stage
in the proceedings is confirmed by the terms in which the Tribunal recorded the

Respondent’s confirmation in its Interim Award, when it stated:

268 Jurisdiction T5/118/24-1 19/1 (Respondent), emphasis added.

Page 67 of 303

During the Hearing, the Respondent confirmed that for the purpose of this phase of
the proceedings, it:

(a) Does not object to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction on the ground that Yukos Capital
does not qualify as an Investor in terms of Article 1(7)2

191. The dispositif of the Interim Award limits the Tribunal’s decisions at that stage to the

three objections to jurisdiction that were the subject of bifurcation. It goes on to provide:
Any other objections to jurisdiction and admissibility are, pursuant to Procedural
Order No 1, joined to the merits.”

192. The above finding makes it unnecessary for the Tribunal to rule on the question of the
circumstances (if any) in which decisions taken in an interim award on jurisdiction are
capable of being reopened while the proceedings are extant. At the same time, the
evidence given in the jurisdiction phase remains part of the arbitration record and

available to the Tribunal in its assessment of the issues presently before it.

193. Ownership and control of the ‘Investor’. Article 26 ECT provides for the submission to
arbitration of ‘[dJisputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another
Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the former, which

concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the former under Part III...”

Article 1(7) ECT defines ‘Investor’. It provides in relevant part:

The Respondent submits that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction because: ‘Although
formally incorporated in Luxembourg, Yukos Capital was at all times beneficially owned

and controlled by nationals of the host State, i.e. the Yukos Oligarchs.’?”!

In order to advance this claim as a matter of law, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal
must look beyond the ordinary meaning of the text of Article 1(7). It refers to a number

of material sources that it alleges are relevant to this exercise,

If (which the Tribunal does not decide) these sources were relevant, it could only be on
the basis that the Claimant met the Respondent’s proposed test of being ‘owned and

controlled by nationals of the host State’ at the material time.

The material time for the purpose of determining the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is the
date upon which the dispute was submitted to arbitration, This was 15 February 2013,
being the date on which the Claimant claimed to accept Russia’s consent to arbitration.?”
Such an approach is, as the Tribunal has already observed in its Interim Award, ‘in
conformity with the constant practice of international courts and tribunals.’ Investment

arbitration is no exception.”

The factual record as to the ownership and control of the Claimant as at that date was
established on an undisputed basis during the jurisdiction phase.” As the Tribunal then
found, as from 14 April 2005, a Dutch Stichting became the sole shareholder of Yukos

Capital, through Yukos International, another company in the Yukos Group.?”°

Page 69 of 303

At that Hearing, the Tribunal was concemed to determine an objection on the ground of
ownership or control by natural persons of a third State (namely United States nationals,
members of the Board of the Stichting). This required the Tribunal to determine who in
turn owned or controlled the Stichting. The agreed evidence that the Tribunal received
from two distinguished experts of Dutch law, called respectively by the Claimant and the
Respondent, was to the effect that ‘it is the board as an organ that controls the stichting
and not the individual natural persons.’2”” As a consequence, the Tribunal found that ‘the
“control” of Yukos Capital for the purposes of Article 17(1) of the ECT is exercised by
an organisation organised under the laws of a Contracting State, namely the Stichting
acting by its Board. It is not controlled by nationals of a third state, since it is the Board
as a collective organ and not its individual members that exercise control over the

Stichting’s affairs.’?”*

This finding was reached in relation to the Respondent’s jurisdictional objection under
Article 17, where ‘control’ is expressly stated to be a part of the legal test. As the Tribunal
has already found above, it does not bind it or the Parties per se in relation to the

Respondent's present objection under Article 1(7).

Nevertheless, the evidence given on that question was and is undisputed. The necessary
consequence is that, even if the Tribunal were to make the assumption in the Respondent’s
favour that ownership or control of the Claimant is to be taken into account as part of the
test for whether it is an ‘Investor’ for the purpose of Article 1(7) ECT (which the Tribunal
does not decide), the uncontradicted evidence is that, at the material time, the Claimant
was not so owned or controlled. Rather it was owned and controlled by a Dutch Stichting

acting by its Board.

. The result is that this first limb of the Respondent’s objection under Article 1(7) must fail.

In reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal does not neglect the Respondent’s contention
that the Claimant’s corporate veil must be pierced in light of Respondent’s allegation that

the Claimant was a vehicle for an illegal enterprise. This contention necessarily depends

upon a consideration of the facts and matters upon which the allegation of illegality

depends, to which the Tribunal will turn in Part VI.C below.

204. Continuous nationality. The Respondent then objects that, even if the Claimant met the
test of Article 1(7) at any earlier date, it has ceased to be ‘a company or other organization
organized in accordance with the law applicable’ in a Contracting State, as a result of a
corporate reorganisation by which it was merged into a BVI entity in 2016. It submits
that, in order to be able to continue to invoke the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, the Claimant
must maintain the nationality of a Contracting State continuously until the date of the
Award.

205. The Tribunal rejects this submission as a matter of law. As it has observed above, the
constant practice of international courts and tribunals is to determine jurisdiction as at the
date of institution of the proceedings. There are sound reasons of principle for this. That
is the date on which the Tribunal is seised of the dispute as formulated in the Claimant’s
claim. If the court or tribunal had jurisdiction at that stage on the basis of a valid
submission by way of consent by both Parties, it cannot lose its jurisdiction in that case
by a subsequent change in the factual situation.” The same consideration applies to the
fulfilment of the elements of the instrument of consent. The court or tribunal is
determining its jurisdiction on the basis of facts that have arisen up to the date of the

institution of proceedings and not thereafter.

206. The ECT contains no express provision that would support a requirement that continuous
nationality must be maintained to the date of the Award. The Respondent alleges that
such a requirement is to be implied from what it characterises as ‘long established rules
of international law.’*®° Putting aside for present purposes the question whether rules of
customary international law on the nationality of corporations are applicable within the

framework of the specific provisions of the ECT, the Respondent’s submission must in

any event be rejected because the rule for which it contends is not a rule of customary

international law.

207. The Respondent relies upon the Award of a NAFTA tribunal in the Loewen case.”*! To
the extent that this case may be said to stand for a broad proposition that, as a matter of
customary international law, a claimant must maintain its nationality continuously until
the date of the award, the International Law Commission has rejected it. Save in cases
where the corporation acquires the nationality of the State against which the claim is
brought after presentation of the claim? (which was the position in Loewen, but is not
the case here), the Commission, in its Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection 2006,
adopted the date of presentation of the claim as the final date for the determination of

nationality.?8

208. The Commission expressly disapproved the suggestion in Loewen that nationality must
be maintained until final resolution of a claim. It decided that it ‘was not prepared to
follow the Loewen tribunal in adopting a blanket rule that nationality must be maintained
to the date of resolution of the claim... Instead, preference is given to the date of the

official presentation of the claim as the dies ad quem.’?*

209. This Tribunal finds this to be a correct statement of the current position in customary
international law. It follows that, even if it were to accept the Respondent’s submission
that a rule from international custom on nationality should be imported into the
construction of the definition of ‘Investor’ in Article 1(7) ECT, the Respondent’s
submission must be rejected because customary international law does not support the

tule for which it contends.

OBJECTION (V): ARTICLE 21 CARVE-OUT

The Respondent contests the admissibility of the Claimant’s expropriation claims on the
basis of a composite act (see Section V.A.1(a)). The Respondent submits that the
composite act expropriation theory is precluded by the taxation carve-out in Article 21 of
the ECT, which excludes taxation measures from its protections. According to the
Respondent, the measures referred to by the Claimant to support its expropriation claim

are legitimate taxation measures, which fall within the scope of the carve-out.

The Claimant disputes that Article 21 precludes the Claimant’s claims or the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction, arguing that Article 21(1) is not an unqualified carve-out and that the acts
complained of are not taxation measures. These arguments will be discussed in turn
below.

The Parties’ views in respect of the objection based on Article 21 are summarised below,
without prejudice to its proper characterisation as an objection to admissibility or the

Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

1. The Respondent’s position

The Respondent claims that the ECT’s taxation carve-out in Article 21 precludes the
Claimant’s composite act theory of expropriation.”** In the Respondent’s view, the term

‘taxation measures’ in the ECT covers ‘the panoply of regulatory activities related to the

lund Jeoislati f;

State’s tax regime and the pi of taxes, i tax and
collection of taxes.’”8° It submits that this interpretation is consistent with the ordinary
meaning of the terms ‘taxation’ and ‘measures,’ as well as with the ECT’s travaux

préparatoires.”*” According to the Respondent, arbitral tribunals have interpreted the

term ‘taxation measures’ broadly and have applied a prima facie test when determining

whether a taxation carve-out applies to certain measures.7**

214. The Respondent contends that the allegations used by the Claimant to support its
expropriation claim relate to taxation measures under the ECT, as they were taken to
implement tax laws and therefore fall within the Article 21 carve-out.”® The Respondent
specifically refers to: (i) charging Yukos Oil with tax liabilities based on re-assessments;
(ii) freezing Yukos Oil’s assets to forestall payment of the alleged tax claims;
(iii) threatening the revocation of Yukos Oil’s oil licences; (iv) conducting searches and
seizures on Yukos Oil’s operations; (v) conducting the seizure and auction of YNG;
(vi) conducting bankruptcy proceedings in respect of Yukos Oil; and (vii) auctioning the
remainder of Yukos Oil’s Russian assets.”®° According to the Respondent, each of these
actions was taken to implement tax laws and therefore falls within the Article 21 carve-

out,29!

. The Respondent submits that Article 21(1) does not require a determination of whether a
taxation measure is bona fide.?% It contends that such a determination would be improper
given the provision’s aim of preserving States’ sovereign prerogative to conduct fiscal

affairs. 7°? In any event, the Respondent submits that the taxation measures were

legitimate, as is the basis for its case on the merits.?

216. Further, the Respondent contends that the ‘claw-back’ in Article 21(5)(a) does not apply

to the alleged composite expropriation.”% It distinguishes the term ‘taxes’ from ‘taxation

‘Taxes,’ the Respondent argues, are monetary charges imposed by the State,”°” which
does not extend to executive or judicial measures that administer or enforce such
monetary charges.?%* To the extent that such an interpretation would create a ‘hole’ in the
legal regime, the Respondent submits that would be a ‘hole’ that the ECT drafters
intended to include.” It therefore contends that the actions referred to by the Claimant

fall outside the scope of the ‘claw-back’ provision.*”

217. In the alternative, the Respondent submits that the Claimant did not follow the referral
mechanism established in Article 21(5)(b)(i),°°! contending that the Claimant's failure to
refer the matter to the tax authorities renders its composite expropriation claim
inadmissible.” It argues that the Article’s text and relevant jurisprudence make clear that
the referral process is mandatory,°~ and contends that the use of the word ‘shall’ indicates
a legally binding obligation. In the event that the Article does contain an exception
where the referral to tax authorities would be futile, the Respondent submits that the

Claimant has advanced no evidence in this regard.3%

2. The Claimant's position

218. The Claimant disputes that Article 21 precludes the Claimant’s claims or the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction. > It argues that Article 21(1) does not provide an absolute, unqualified
carve-out from investment protection, ?”” that the acts complained of in this case are not
‘taxation measures’ under Article 21(1),2% and that, even if they could be classified as

such, the ‘claw-back’ in Article 21(5) would apply.°°?

219. The Claimant submits that Articles 21(3) and 21(5) provide that a tax action falls outside
the definition of ‘taxation measure’ if it is applied in a discriminatory manner, or else is
expropriatory or discriminatory.>!° To the Claimant, these exceptions demonstrate that
the ECT provides investment protection with regard to taxes and contemplates

‘independent oversight’ of host-State taxation measures.?!!

220. The Claimant also disputes that the impugned actions constitute ‘tax measures’ within the
meaning of Article 21(1).!? It argues that a complete analysis must include a factual

generating revenue to be used for public purposes.?/> If the answer to this question is no,
then, in the Claimant’s view, the State action is not truly a taxation measure and therefore
falls outside the scope of Article 21(1).?!4

221. According to the Claimant, this interpretation complies with the object and purpose of the
ECT to protect and promote investments in the energy sector.*!§ It contends that the
Respondent’s interpretation would allow a State to evade ECT obligations by disguising
treaty breaches as taxation measures.*!° In this regard, the Claimant submits that its
interpretation is consistent with the good faith requirement in Article 26 of the Vienna
Convention on the Law of Treaties?!” and contends that its interpretation of Article 21 of
the ECT has been confirmed by various investment tribunals interpreting that Treaty.?"°
The Claimant therefore contends that the Respondent’s actions cannot constitute ‘taxation

measures’ within the scope of Article 21(1).3"°

222. In the alternative, the Claimant submits that the ‘claw-back’ in Article 21(5) applies.>°
First, the Claimant refers to the Respondents argument that the ‘claw-back’ applies only
to ‘taxes’ and not to the administration and enforcement of the same.*” The Claimant
argues that this distinction is illogical, since the ‘claw-back’ concerns expropriation, but
tax laws alone, without administration and enforcement, cannot effect an expropriation.”
It further contends that taxation can constitute an expropriation whether or not it results

in the insolvency of the taxpayer.?23

223. Second, the Claimant submits that there was no need for it to follow the referral
mechanism established in Article 21(5)(b)(i).>* It notes that Article 21(5)(b)(i) provides

initiate proceedings without making a prior referral to the Competent Taxation

Authority.376

224. Finally, the Claimant submits that Article 21(5) does not require the Tribunal to make a
referral where there is no effective remedy.>”” It argues that any reference to the Russian
tax authorities would ‘undoubtedly have been futile,’ given their ‘key role... in bringing
about the demise of Yukos Oil.’>28 The Claimant also notes that the tribunal in the Hulley
Final Awards found that any referral to the competent authorities would have been futile

because of the volume and complex nature of the material.>2?

3. The Tribunal’s analysis
225. Taxation Measures. Article 21 ECT provides in relevant part:

(1) Except as otherwise provided in this Article, nothing in this Treaty shall create
tights or impose obligations with respect to Taxation Measures of the
Contracting Parties. In the event of any inconsistency between this Article and
any other provisions of the Treaty, this Article shall prevail to the extent of
the inconsistency.

(5) (a) Article 13 [Expropriation] shall apply to taxes.

(b) Whenever an issue arises under Article 13, to the extent that it pertains to
whether a tax constitutes an expropriation of whether a tax alleged to
constitute an expropriation is discriminatory...

(i) The Investor or the Contracting Party alleging expropriation shall refer
the issue of whether the tax is an expropriation of whether the tax is
discriminatory to the relevant Competent Tax Authority...

(ii) The Competent Tax Authorities shall, within a period of six months of
such referral, strive to resolve the issues so referred...

(iv) Under no circumstances shall involvement of the Competent Tax
Authorities, beyond the end of the six month period... lead to a delay
of proceedings under Articles 26 and 27.

(7) For the purpose of this Article:
(a) The term “taxation measure” includes:

(i) any provision relating to taxes of the domestic law of the Contracting
Party or of a political subdivision thereof of a local authority therein;
and

(ii) any provision relating to taxes of any convention for the avoidance of
double taxation or of any other international agreement or arrangement
by which the Contracting Party is bound.

Issues. The Respondent’s objection under this head gives rise to four sub-issues:

(i) Is the Claimant’s right that is here invoked a right ‘with respect to Taxation
Measures’ (including provisions in Russia’s domestic tax law or in its Double

Taxation Agreements)?
(ii) If so, does the exception in Article 21(5) for expropriation claims apply?

(iii) If so, was the Claimant obliged to refer its claim to the Respondent’s Competent
Tax Authorities?

(iv) If so, what is the effect, if any, of any failure on its part to do so on the jurisdiction

of this Tribunal to determine the present claim?

The first of these is a threshold issue. It would only be if the Claimant’s claim were
properly characterised as a claim with respect to Taxation Measures that it would be
necessary to go on to analyse whether the carve-out for expropriation claims applies, and
then to consider whether the procedure laid down in the ECT in that event had been

complied with and, if not, the consequences for the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. Yet, in

the particular context of the claims advanced in the present case, it is necessary to consider
both sets of issues arising under Article 21. The Article must, in any event, be read as a

whole in order to determine its object and purpose.

Composite Act. The Respondent advances its objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction
under this head solely in relation to that element of the Claimant’s claim, which the latter
refers to as its ‘composite act’ theory.> It does not submit that this objection applies to
deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction to determine the Claimant’s claim that its Loans were
expropriated in the bankruptcy proceedings. As a result, this objection, if it were accepted,
would not apply to the whole of the case, but only to one way in which the Claimant

pleads its case.

Yet, simply put, the Claimant only has one claim. It has only suffered one loss: the loss
of the sums due under its Loans. It does not, and could not, advance a claim for losses
suffered by any other person other than itself. Indeed it is fundamental to the Claimant’s
claim that the Loans constituted its distinct investment in an economic activity in Russia.
The Tribunal (by majority) accepted in its Interim Award that:

The Claimant does own an asset constituted by a debt of a company associated with

an Economic Activity in the Energy Sector in the Area of the Respondent such that

it has made an Investment to which the present dispute with the Respondent

relates.3!
Further, the Claimant’s claim against the Respondent consists only in an allegation that,
by its actions, the Respondent has breached its international obligations to the Claimant
under ECT Article 13 (Expropriation) and, secondarily, Article 10 (Promotion, Protection
and Treatment of Investments). This gives rise to two causes of action under the Treaty;
but it does not alter the subject matter or object of the claim. To be actionable at the suit
of the Claimant, the actions of the Respondent must have caused the loss of the Claimant’s

investment, and not that of anyone else. In the language of Article 21(1), it is the ‘rights’

of the Claimant and the ‘obligations’ of the Respondent vis-a-vis the Claimant with which

this Tribunal is concerned.

For reasons that will be developed more fully when the Tribunal opens its analysis of the
merits in Part VIA below, these elementary points have real consequences for the nature
of the Claimant’s claim. They mean that the essential gravamen of the claim concerns the
actions of the Respondent that allegedly invaded the rights of Yukos Capital vis-a-vis its
Loans. This point applies equally to the Claimant’s case and to the Respondent’s

objections.

As will be explained further below, the concept of a ‘composite act’ may conveniently
encapsulate a series of acts to be considered together when the Tribunal is assessing
whether the Respondent has committed an international delict. But this does not make all
of the acts allegedly directed against Yukos Oil ipso facto part of a composite act directed
against Yukos Capital. That would run counter to the principle that the position of a
creditor is legally distinct from that of its debtor. This does not exclude the possibility
that the alleged acts of the Respondent were part of a campaign directed against the
Claimant as part of the Yukos Group, along with Yukos Oil and other members of the
Group. But the purpose of the Tribunal’s enquiry will be to determine the relevance of

those acts to, and their effect upon, the Claimant.

In turn, this point also addresses the Respondent’s objection under Article 21. The
Claimant does not sue in respect of a Taxation Measure levied by Russia against it, No
such charge was imposed. To the extent that its case concerns Taxation Measures, these
were imposed upon its parent company, Yukos Oil, which stands in the context of the
present claim as its creditor. Those measures are not actionable at the suit of the Claimant.
To the extent that they are relevant in the present case, it is not because the Claimant may
advance a claim in respect of them: it is only to the extent that they may provide the

context for the actions of the Respondent that were directed against Yukos Capital.

The consequence is that this is not a claim of the Claimant ‘in respect of a Taxation
Measure’ of the Respondent. The point may be further tested by reference to the
procedure contemplated by the Contracting Parties under the Article 21(5) carve-out. This

procedure contemplates that, in the first instance, the investor (here Yukos Capital) shall

Page 81 of 303

‘refer the issue of whether the tax is an expropriation or whether the tax is discriminatory
to the relevant Competent Tax Authority.’>3? These provisions would operate naturally
and sensibly in a dispute between the taxpayer and the Tax Authority, But the matters of
which the Claimant makes complaint in the present proceedings do not give rise to a claim
in respect of its tax liability. It is not possible to see how the Claimant could have been
expected to make such a reference, or how vis-a-vis it the Competent Tax Authorities

\
might be expected ‘to resolve the issues so referred,’?3>

235. Expropriation carve-out. Further, even if the claim were properly to be regarded as ‘with
respect to Taxation Measures,’ the exception for expropriation claims in Article 21(5)

applies and is not excluded by the procedure prescribed thereunder.

236. The Claimant’s principal claim is that the Respondent has breached Article 13 of the ECT
by expropriating the entirety of the sums remaining due under its Loans otherwise than

in accordance with the provisions of that Article.

237, The Claimant asserts in addition a claim under Article 10 (Promotion, Protection and
Treatment of Investments). However, as will be explained in greater detail in Part VLA.2
of this Award, the facts and matters upon which the Claimant relies for this alleged cause
of action are the same as those pleaded in respect of its Article 13 claim. Moreover, there:
is, in the circumstances of this case, substantial overlap in the legal elements that would
be required to be established for the purpose of Article 10. One of the elements specified
in Article 13 for a lawful act of expropriation is that the taking be ‘carried out under due
process of law.’ In its Article 10 claim, the Claimant alleges that the standard ‘involves

a lack of due process that leads to an outcome which offends judicial propriety.’>°5

238. It would only be if the Tribunal were to reach the view that the claim under Article 13 for

0

expropriation of the investment does not succeed that it would be necessary to consider

whether the Article 10 claim might import a different standard of liability for the

332 Art 21(5)(b)(i) ECT.
333 Art 21(5)(b)(ii) ECT.
334 Art 13(1)(¢) ECT.

determination of loss. In any event it will be necessary to consider the expropriation claim

first.

This leaves the question whether the operation of the carve-out under Article 21(5) is

d.

juded by the procedural provisions set out th The Tribunal has already given
its principal answer to this above: As the present claim is not in respect of a tax liability
of the Claimant, the provisions requiring a reference to the Competent Tax Authority are

inapplicable to the Claimant’s claim.

If, contrary to this conclusion, it were appropriate to examine the conduct of Yukos Oil
(the debtor subjected to the tax liability), the record that the Tribunal has examined, and
which were analysed in detail in Part III.E, demonstrates that Yukos Oil made multiple
attempts to challenge its tax liabilities before the competent Russian tax authorities, which

attempts did not succeed.

Further and in any event, Article 21(5)(b)(iv) provides that: ‘Under no circumstances shall
involvement of the Competent Tax Authorities, beyond the end of the six month period...
lead to a delay of proceedings under Articles 26 and 27.” As a matter of construction, this
provision indicates that the Contracting Parties did not intend that compliance or not with
the procedural requirements of Article 21(5) should constitute a bar to resort to arbitration
under Article 26.326 Nor is there any suggestion in the Respondent’s case that such resort
would have been reasonably available to the Claimant within the prescribed six month

period or at all.?>7

For the above reasons, the Respondent’s objection to jurisdiction under Article 26 must

be rejected.

LIABILITY AND ILLEGALITY — PARTIES’ ARGUMENTS

The Claimant’s essential case on liability is that the Respondent, through its various
actions against it and its parent Yukos Oil, expropriated the Claimant’s investment and
failed to afford it fair and equitable treatment (FET), in breach of the ECT. The
Respondent’s answer is that such actions were legal and therefore do not amount to
expropriation under the ECT, and that the Claimant’s investments were illegal under both

international and domestic law and are therefore not entitled to protection.

EXPROPRIATION AND UNFAIR TREATMENT
1. The Claimant’s position

The Claimant submits that the Respondent unlawfully expropriated the Claimant’s
investment, in breach of Article 13(1) of the ECT.*** Particularly, the Claimant asserts
that the Respondent’s acts had the effect equivalent to expropriation, and that they:
(i) lacked a public interest purpose; (ii) were discriminatory; (iii) disregarded the due
process of law; and (iv) lacked payment of prompt, adequate and effective

compensation.>°°

The Claimant alleges that the Respondent’s acts against Yukos Oil and Yukos Capital
constitute a composite expropriation of the Claimant’s investment, in that the Russian
Federation illegally rendered Yukos Oil insolvent through its various actions previously
described. It further submits that the Russian judiciary’s acts against Yukos Capital
during the bankruptcy proceedings establish a separate instance of expropriation,
independently capable of meeting the standard under the ECT.*“

(a) Expropriation through composite act

246. The Claimant submits that an indirect expropriation occurs when a State ‘substantially
deprives’ an investor of the title, possession or access to the benefit and economic use of
its investment.>"! It contends that an indirect expropriation need not result from a single,
discrete act, but rather may stem from a ‘composite act’ comprised of acts that
individually may not qualify as an expropriating measure but, in the aggregate, have the

effect equivalent to an expropriation.

247. The Claimant contends that the Respondent’s acts, in the aggregate, ‘mortally affected’
Yukos Oil’s ability to repay the Loans and therefore deprived the Claimant of the benefit
of its investment.> In its view, the alleged acts should be considered in the aggregate
because ‘they are linked so as to converge to the composite result,’ 34 and that such

composite act constitutes an indirect expropriation.*

248. The Claimant submits that Article 13(1) of the ECT contains four conditions for lawful
expropriation: (i) a public interest purpose; (ii) non-discrimination; (iii) due process of
law; and (iv) prompt, adequate and effective compensation.™* It elaborates on each of

these points separately as set out below.

249. Public interest purpose. The Claimant submits that the Respondent's acts did not pursue
a purpose in the public interest.247 According to the Claimant, the Respondent's real goal

was not to collect taxes legitimately, but to expropriate Yukos Oil.> It contends that the

that the Tax Assessments had no basis in Russian law and were therefore ‘wrongful,

arbitrary and capricious.’35°

250. The Claimant further asserts that the Respondent’s ‘brutal enforcement strategy and
refusal to engage with Yukos Oil’s settlement offers’ show its intent to dismantle Yukos
Oil and expropriate its assets.°>' According to the Claimant, the Russian courts and
bailiffs worked in tandem to ‘ratchet up the alleged tax liabilities’ while freezing Yukos
Oil’s assets and preventing it from discharging those liabilities.*>* The Claimant equally

Non-discrimination. The Claimant contends that the Respondent’s acts were

(i) summarily rejected Yukos Capital’s claims but accepted claims from similarly situated
creditors in the bankruptcy proceedings; (ii) subjected Yukos-related entities to
impossible evidentiary standards while ‘rubber-stamping’ the claims of Rosneft, the
Federal Tax Service and YNG; and (iii) did not allow YNG to renegotiate its tax liability,
but allowed Rosneft to acquire YNG, reduce YNG’s liability by 80% and restructure

payment into a five-year plan.** According to the Claimant, these acts, among others,

The Claimant disputes that the Register of Creditors included a significant number of
claims by Yukos-related entities.>*” It submits that 99% of such claims were made by
TN, and that the Respondent only included those claims because it knew that Rosneft
would acquire them.** As for the remaining 1% of Yukos-related claims, the Claimant
notes that together they represented a value of only RUB 150 million.> The Claimant
posits that such claims ‘likely slipped through the net while Rosneft and the Federal Tax
service were preoccupied with devising spurious grounds to challenge the far more
substantial claims of Yukos Capital, Glendale and Vostok Trade, valued at over RUB 140

billion.

Due process of law. The Claimant submits that the Respondent’s acts violated principles
of due process. According to the Claimant, due process requires ‘basic legal
mechanisms, such as reasonable advance notice, a fair hearing and an unbiased and
impartial adjudicator to assess the actions in dispute.’>% It emphasises that an investor
must have a ‘reasonable chance within a reasonable time to claim its legitimate rights and

have its claims heard.’>

The Claimant contends that the Respondent’s actions ‘could not be further away from

property; (ii) document seizures in violation of Russian laws; (iii) failure to provide

the lawyers for Yukos Oil and Yukos Capital; and (ix) the denial of the Claimant’s
participation in the Yukos Oil bankruptcy based on unfounded grounds contrary to

Compensation. The Claimant submits that it has not received any compensation from the

Russian Federation despite the expropriation of its investment.°7

In response to the Respondent’s arguments regarding proximate cause, the Claimant
contends that the Respondent’s actions were the proximate cause of the Loans’
destruction.“ In the Claimant’s view, the standard for proximate causation is whether
the actions caused harm within the ambit of Article 13, in light of its purpose.°® In this
regard, the Claimant submits that the purpose of Article 13 is ‘to create a climate

favourable to the operation of enterprises and to the flow of investments’ and the ‘best

destruction of the Loans is a harm within the ambit of Article 13.37!

257. The Claimant contends that it is well established that an equity investment in a company
is expropriated when a State unlawfully takes the company or its assets.?” It asserts that
this conclusion holds for debt investments as well, noting that the ECT makes no
distinction between the level of protection provided to debt versus equity.>” In this
regard, the Claimant disputes the Respondent’s characterisation of Petrobart Ltd v Kyrgyz
Republic, being that acts directed at a claimant’s debtor are too remote to serve as a basis
for an investment treaty claim.?” The Claimant notes that the tribunal in Petrobart was
considering the question of breach, not proximate cause or remoteness, and it argues
that while the tribunal rejected an expropriation claim, it nevertheless found a breach of
the FET standard.” In any event, the Claimant argues that Petrobart is distinguishable
from the present case, because it involved the right to be paid under a sales contract,
which, in the Claimant’s view, is different from a creditor’s rights under a loan

agreement.?””

Claimant submits that—in light of the actions taken by the Russian Federation against
Yukos Oil—it would be implausible to suggest that the Respondent’s actions were not

directed at the Claimant and its investment.>®°

The Claimant also submits that Russia’s actions against Yukos Oil were the factual cause
of the Claimant’s loss, since Yukos Oi! would have remained financially stable and repaid

tax was legal, the VAT taxes constitute an independent factual cause of Yukos Oil’s
insolvency, because, absent the improper imposition of VAT, Yukos Oil would have been
able to pay the corporate profit tax, remain solvent and satisfy its obligations to the

Claimant.>

(b) Judicial expropriation

The Claimant also submits that the Russian judiciary’s treatment of Yukos Capital
constitutes an independent act of expropriation, as the judgments denying Yukos
Capital’s claims in the bankruptcy proceedings were improper, discreditable, or

manifestly contrary to Russian law.

The Claimant submits that, in order to find judicial expropriation, the Tribunal must find

that the State judiciary acted illegally.>®

to demonstrate illegal judicial behaviour, *** but that it need only establish any of the

process.2®” The Claimant contends that all three of these criteria can be satisfied in the

present case.788
263. With regard to the First Bankruptcy Application, the Claimant contends that:

..the Moscow Arbitrazh Court had no grounds whatsoever on which to refuse
Yukos Capital’s claim: the Notice of Default had been properly delivered and
received, there was no ‘material change in circumstances’ requirement to accelerate
the Loans, and even if there was, the court’s ‘assessment’ of the facts was wrong on
all accounts. The court’s decision, which simply copied verbatim large sections of
Federal Tax Service’s arguments without independent verification, was baseless,
arbitrary and wholly contrary to Russian law.7*?

264. The Claimant submits that its appeal of this decision was unlawfully suspended due to an
unrelated investigation that, according to the Claimant, never actually existed.?°° The
Claimant adds that its appeal of this suspension was, in its view, summarily rejected
without any analysis of Yukos Capital’s arguments. *°! The suspension was lifted

following Yukos Oil’s liquidation, and the Claimant’s appeal was rejected as moot.?

265. As discussed above, the Claimant alleges that the Russian courts’ treatment of its Second
Application was equally flawed.>%? According to the Claimant, the Moscow Arbitrazh

Court made ‘ludicrous’ and ‘illogical’ findings based on irrelevant evidence, undertaking

‘no legal analysis and provid[ing] no legal justification for its decisions.’>** The Claimant
asserts that ‘no impartial court’ could reach the same conclusion as the Moscow Arbitrazh

Court, given the same evidence.3

The Claimant submits that its appeal of this decision was rejected ‘in blatant disregard
for due process.’ 3° The Claimant further contends that “Mr Rebgun’s invalidation
proceedings, no doubt initiated as a delaying tactic, prevented any further appeal, again

leaving Yukos Capital’s claim ultimately unheard.’397

Moreover, the Claimant submits that it was severely prejudiced in its ability to mount a
defence in the bankruptcy proceedings, due to the Russian courts’ wilful blindness to the
alleged harassment and intimidation of its lawyers, leading to their withdrawal as Yukos

Capital’s representatives.*°

The Claimant asserts that the above factual contentions demonstrate an abuse of rights,
as well as arbitrary decision-making and a violation of due process. *? It therefore
maintains that the Russian courts’ behaviour in isolation amounts to a judicial
expropriation, but also fits within a wider pattern of conduct in breach of Articles 13 and

Pp makes no r to the principle, and relies on
Dr Gladyshev’s opinion that a broader interpretation of ‘Exception (d)’ (by which
founders or shareholders of the debtor are excluded from the third priority ranking of
claims) would not have been applied by the courts to Yukos Capital at the time of the

bankruptcy proceedings.*”

(c) Fair and equitable treatment

270. The Claimant submits that Russia breached Article 10(1) of the ECT by failing to provide
fair and equitable treatment to its investment in Yukos Oil.‘°? Specifically, the Claimant
asserts that: (i) the Respondent’s conduct was grossly unfair, inequitable, capricious and
arbitrary and lacked in transparency, procedural propriety and due process; (ii) the
Respondent denied justice to the Claimant; and (iii) the Respondent failed to provide a

predictable and stable legal framework.4™

271. The Claimant clarifies that, in its view, the FET standard in the ECT surpasses the
international minimum standard and has a specific legal meaning.*® It contends that this
meaning should be discerned with reference to the ordinary meaning of the terms of
Article 10(1) and in the light of their context and purpose.‘°° Accordingly, the Claimant
submits that in interpreting the FET standard, the Tribunal should consider whether the
Russian Federation’s conduct was conducive to providing a stable, transparent legal

framework for foreign investments in the context of the energy sector.*””

272. According to the Claimant, investment tribunals have identified protections against unfair
State conduct that is: (i) unreasonable, arbitrary, or disproportionate; (ii) lacking in
transparency; or (iii) lacking in due process.*°* It asserts that the FET standard protects
against State abuses of sovereign power, such as harassment, coercion or unfounded

409 and maintains that under i jurisprudence, the composite act

principle applies to FET claims.*”°

273. The Claimant submits that there can be ‘no serious debate’ that a State violates the ECT’s
FET standard where the State ‘exercises its sovereign powers — investigatorial,
prosecutorial, regulatory or otherwise — to harass, intimidate, or retaliate against an
investor for political purposes.”*'' As set out in relation to its expropriation arguments,

the Claimant maintains that the Respond gaged in acts of f

all those associated with it, including Claimant and its Investment.’4" In the Claimant’s

view, this ‘deliberate conspiracy’ alone violated Article 10(1).43

a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety.’4 In this
regard, the Claimant makes a number of factual contentions, including allegations of:

{v) State harassment of Yukos-related agents and lawyers; and (vi) judicial decisions that

these actions demonstrate a lack of transparency and due process, in violation of the FET

standard and the ECT.*"

Similarly, the Claimant submits that the Respondent’s actions constituted a denial of
justice, which is a separate element of the FET standard.‘!7 According to the Claimant, a
denial of justice takes place when a State’s courts: (i) refuse to entertain a valid suit;
(ii) subject a case to undue delay; (iii) administer justice in a seriously inadequate way;
or (iv) maliciously misapply the law.‘'® The Claimant asserts that a denial of justice
involves a judicial act that is clearly improper and discreditable, wilfully disregards due

process and shocks a sense of juridical propriety.‘”

The Claimant maintains that the Russian courts pursued the following actions as part of
a State campaign to destroy Yukos and expropriate its assets:*”° (i) adopting verbatim the
submissions of Russian tax authorities while failing to consider the evidence and
arguments submitted by the Claimant; (ii) accepting submissions by Rosneft, Mr Rebgun
and the Russian tax authorities on the day of hearings, thereby denying the Claimant the
opportunity to respond; (iii) holding hearings in the absence of Claimant’s counsel while
knowing that such absence was a result of State harassment and intimidation;
(iv) rejecting the Claimant’s bankruptcy applications without any critical analysis at the
initial or appellate levels; (v) arbitrarily suspending the Claimant’s bankruptcy appeals;

and (vi) terminating the suspended appeals when the sham Yukos Oi! bankruptcy had

in the aggregate, demonstrate a denial of justice in violation of Article 10(1).47

277. The Claimant also contends that the same actions demonstrate a breach of the effective
means requirement in Article 10(12).‘?3 According to the Claimant, the standard for
effective means is similar to, but less demanding than, the denial of justice standard.424
The Claimant asserts that the standard requires that: (i) the host State establish a proper
system of laws and institutions, and (ji) those systems work effectively in any given
case.‘?5 In the Claimant’s view, the facts above demonstrate that Russia’s systems of laws

and institutions ‘fell far below this standard.’476

278. Referring to Article 10(1)'s express protection against ‘unreasonable or discriminatory
measures,’ the Claimant submits that the Respondent’s actions also violated this
protection.*?” It contends that this protection is inherent in the FET standard, *8 and
prohibits conduct that is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust, idiosyncratic or
discriminatory.”° The Claimant asserts that a measure is arbitrary if it is not reasonably
related to a rational policy.*° To the Claimant, the Respondent’s alleged campaign to

destroy and expropriate Yukos does not constitute a rational policy.“3! The Claimant

279. Finally, the Claimant asserts that the Respondent has breached the FET standard by
failing to provide a stable and predictable legal framework for the Claimant’s
investment.’ Arguing that FET requires a host State ‘to act in a consistent manner, free
from ambiguity and totally transparently in its relations with the foreign investor...’,4%*

the Claimant submits that Russia’s conduct violated this standard, particularly in the way

its tax laws were applied by the tax authorities and its bankruptcy laws were enforced by

the Russian courts. “95

2. The Respondent’s position

280. The Respondent contends that both of the Claimant’s theories regarding expropriation-—
being the composite act theory and the judicial expropriation theory—are misconceived
and lack legal or evidentiary basis.“

(a) Expropriation through composite act

281.

The Respondent advances four objections to the Claimant’s composite act theory. The
first objection is linked to its claim that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the alleged
acts because they are taxation measures and are thus excluded by operation of the ECT’s
taxation carve-out.**” That objection has ae been set out at tength above and will not

be repeated.*3* The Respondent’s bjections will be d d seriatim below,

being: (j) that the Claimant has failed to establish a composite act, both legally and
factually; (ii) that the acts directed against Yukos Oil were not a proximate cause of
the Claimant’s losses;“*° and (iii) that the various acts were not a factual cause of the

Claimant’s losses."

282. Legal and factual proof of composite act. The Respondent submits that the Claimant’s
composite act theory fundamentally misunderstands the applicable rules of international
law, arguing that a ‘composite wrongful act’ arises where an obligation can only be
breached through a series of measures rather than through an individual act.”? The
Respondent therefore contends that the Claimant must show that there are a number of
separate acts amounting to an international wrong, but that none of those acts when
considered in isolation is expropriatory.““? In this regard, the Respondent refers to a
number of occasions on which the Claimant asserts that an expropriation is made out on
the basis of an individual act alone—including in relation to VAT, fines, penalty and
enforcement measures, and the refusal to permit the Claimant to participate as a creditor
in the bankruptcy proceedings. 4 In the Respondent’s view, each of these allegations
constitutes a discrete, independent and self-sufficient alleged international wrong and

therefore cannot logically form the basis of a composite act expropriation argument. “4°

283. Moreover, the Respondent submits that the Claimant’s description of a ‘coordinated

w

campaign’ within the Russian State meets the definition of a ‘conspiracy’, and that the
Claimant fails to meet the high evidential threshold required for such allegations.“° It

contends that, while the Claimant has avoided characterising its case as a conspiracy, its

Page 98 of 303

composite act case clearly amounts to one and the Claimant must therefore prove ‘a
conscious combination of various agencies of government without justification to defeat

the purposes of an investment agreement.’“47

284. The Respondent also draws attention to the Claimant’s contention that the Loans were
expropriated when Yukos Oil was struck off the register of companies in 2007,“"8 arguing
that this is illogical in light of the Claimant’s simultaneous contention that the Loans were

expropriated in 2006 when Yukos Capital’s bankruptcy claims were denied.*49

285. Proximate cause. The Respondent asserts that the Claimant’s composite act theory fails
because the underlying acts were not directed at the Claimant or the Loans, and therefore

450 Tt contends that a more

have no direct or legally significant link to the claimed losses.
substantial nexus between the Respondent’s actions and Yukos Oil’s bankruptcy is

required; in other words, the Claimant has failed to establish causation.*5'

286. The Respondent submits that causation is a necessary element of State responsibility

under public international law and the ECT,‘ and that the alleged wrong must directly

cause the harm suffered.*°>

287. More specifically, the Respondent argues that acts directed at a claimant’s debtor are too
remote to give rise to an investment treaty claim.*** While acknowledging that the ECT

includes both debt and equity in its definition of investment, the Respondent submits that

this does not eliminate the distinction between the two.*® It submits that debt and equity
remain separate forms of investment under the ECT since they may need to be treated
differently when analysing whether a breach of the Treaty has occurred. 456 The
Respondent notes that, unlike equity holders, debt holders are protected by bankruptcy
regimes, and therefore it is only if the creditor or its loans have been subjected to some
illegal conduct in the course of bankruptcy proceedings that expropriation arguments may
arise.“5” The Respondent further asserts that an investor cannot claim for expropriation of
debt where the contractual debt continues to exist and the legal characterisation of the

obligation to pay has not been altered. **

288.

oo

The Respondent submits that it ‘is similarly untenable for a creditor, such as Claimant, to
maintain an expropriation claim solely on the basis that Respondent’s actions were a
factual predicate of the debtor’s bankruptcy. A more substantial nexus is required.’*° For
example, the Respondent argues that even accepting the Claimant’s allegation of
discrimination vis-a-vis its investment, this would constitute discrimination against
Yukos Oil—not Yukos Capital.“ Thus, according to the Respondent, there is no legal

causation between the discrimination and Yukos Capital’s harm.*!

289. Factual cause. The Respondent likewise contends that the impugned actions were not the
factual cause of Yukos Oil’s bankruptcy. “© It asserts that the Claimant cannot

that there is no proof that it was even aware of the Claimant’s existence before the

bankruptcy proceedings.*

29

S

Even if the Respondent’s actions against Yukos Oil satisfied the requirements of legal
causation, it submits that its actions were not a factual cause of the Claimant’s harm since
the bankruptcy proceedings resulted from the Yukos Group’s own allegedly unlawful
actions.‘® In this regard, the Respondent argues that the share buyback scheme and the
giga-dividend—resulting in a divestment of billions of dollars from Yukos Oil—meant
that Yukos Oil did not have sufficient resources to satisfy the demands made pursuant to
the Tax Assessments.‘ It therefore argues that Yukos Oil would have properly faced
bankruptcy following the Tax Assessments regardless of the enforcement measures later

taken by the Russian Federation in respect of them.‘*”

N
oO

. Furthermore, the Respondent asserts that Yukos Capital could not have recovered under
the Loans pursuant to the bankruptcy proceedings.“ It submits that Yukos Oil faced two
possibilities at that point: (i) financial rehabilitation; or (ii) a formal declaration of
bankruptcy,“ and that its creditors voted against rehabilitation and instead chose to
liquidate the company.‘” The Respondent therefore submits that the Russian courts
rejected Yukos Capital’s claims in line with ‘fundamental rules and principles of Russian
bankruptcy law,”*7! and that the Claimant would not have recovered even if its claims had

been accepted in light of the subordination principle.*” Finally, the Respondent contends

that, even if the Rehabilitation Plan had been chosen, the Claimant would not have been
able to recover under the Loans since the financial Rehabilitation Plan envisaged

extinguishing inter-company claims such as the Loans.*

292. Therefore, the Respondent submits that the Claimant’s allegations, even if true, do not

establish factual causation.‘

(b) Judicial expropriation

293. The Respondent contests the Claimant’s judicial expropriation theory on three grounds.
First, it contends that the theory relies on acts taken by Mr Rebgun, Yukos Oil’s
liquidator,*75 and that his actions are not attributable to the Russian Federation.*” These
arguments are set out along with the Tribunal’s analysis, and are therefore not repeated
here.*”” Second, the Respondent argues that the Claimant has failed to articulate the
‘exacting standard’ for investment claims premised upon judicial acts.478 Third, it submits
that the Claimant has failed to meet this standard and demonstrate that the Russian courts

violated the ECT.*”? These latter arguments will be addressed below.

294. The Respondent submits that the Claimant must satisfy an ‘exceedingly high legal

d. HT

d’ in order to ish judicial mi duct.**° The Respondent relies on a number

of international authorities to submit that, as a corollary of the presumption of regularity

judicial misconduct.**! It submits that denial of justice claims must be premised upon a
systemic failure of the State’s judicial system, as opposed to individual judicial decisions,
and that even a substantial error does not generally rise to the level of international
responsibility in international investment cases.**? Otherwise, the Respondent submits
that the Tribunal would be at risk of inappropriately substituting its own views for those

of the Russian courts on matters of Russian law."®

The Respondent further submits that allegations of grave judicial impropriety, such as
corruption, are subject to a particularly high standard.** It advocates for a standard of
clear and convincing evidence when approaching allegations of criminal conduct, since

‘the graver the charge the more confidence must there be in the evidence relied on.7485

Turning to the allegations made by the Claimant in the present case, the Respondent
submits that such acts do not meet the exacting standard set out above for judicial
expropriation.** Specifically, the Respondent contends that the Claimant has failed to
establish its allegations that the Russian judiciary: (i) behaved corruptly; (ii) participated
in a conspiracy to frustrate the Claimant’s bankruptcy claims; (iii) illegally denied the

factual record does not support the Claimant’s contentions.*® The Respondent makes

specific submissions in relation to each of the Claimant's contentions, as set out below.

297. First, in relation to the Claimant’s allegation that the Russian judiciary behaved corruptly,
the Respondent contends that the Claimant has failed to present any admissible or
persuasive evidence in this regard.‘°° Rather than applying the presumption of regularity,
which the Respondent submits is well established in decisions of Dutch courts in other
Yukos-related matters and investment treaty jurisprudence, the Respondent argues that
the Claimant effectively imposes a presumption of irregularity on the Russian legal
system.**' The Respondent opposes this approach and maintains that specific judicial
decisions may only be discredited in light of clear, convincing and conclusive evidence

of corruption.*”

298. Second, the Respondent submits that the Claimant has failed to establish a conspiracy

between the Russian judiciary and executive during the bankruptcy proceedings.“ It
argues that there is nothing suspicious about the fact that the Claimant’s claim was
opposed by other existing creditors, as it was in accordance with their commercial best
interest due to the impact it would have had on their entitlements to Yukos Oil’s assets.'4
Moreover, the Respondent disputes that evidence of conspiracy can be found in the
verbatim adoption of the submissions of the Russian tax authorities, as this is common

practice within Russia for efficiency reasons and is adopted by Russia’s highest

that the impugned judgments evidenced bad faith or bias.4%°

299. Third, the Respondent contends that the Claimant has failed to establish that the Russian
judiciary acted illegally by denying Yukos Capital’s bankruptcy claims.“*” In this regard
the Respondent relies on Professor Zaitsev’s expert report, which concludes that the
courts were fully entitled to reject the claims as a matter of Russian law and on the basis
of the evidence before them.*” The Respondent therefore argues that the courts’ rulings
had ‘ample basis’ and thus fall short of the standard that the Claimant must meet./?
Further, the Respondent argues that even if Yukos Capital’s bankruptcy claims had been
accepted, they would have been subordinated and thus would not have yielded

recovery.5

300. Fourth, the Respondent submits that the Claimant has failed to establish discriminatory
treatment in the bankruptcy proceedings.*”! It opposes the Claimant’s assertion that the
courts rejected the claims of entities related to Yukos Oil but ‘rubber stamped’ those of
Rosneft and YNG, %? arguing that the bankruptcy courts: (i) accepted a significant
number of claims by Yukos-related entities; (ii) ‘clearly justified’ their denial of other

and (iv) rejected some of the claims submitted by the Federal Tax Service and YNG.50

301.

Fifth, the Respondent maintains that the Claimant has failed to establish any procedural
defects in the bankruptcy proceedings.*°” In the Respondent’s view, Yukos Capital had
‘ample opportunity’ to present its case and made extensive, repeated submissions to the
courts.5°8 The Respondent asserts that the Claimant was duly notified of the time and
place of court hearings and presented its case at many of them.5° Additionally, the
Respondent notes that the bankruptcy court granted the Claimant’s extension application
in the face of Rosneft’s opposition.5'° Moreover, the Respondent disputes that the court
was ‘determined to proceed’ when Yukos Capital failed to secure representation.*!!
According to the Respondent, it was the Claimant that requested the court to proceed in

the absence of its counsel.>!

302. Sixth and finally, the Respondent opposes the claim that it harassed the Claimant’s
lawyers or otherwise undermined their ability to present their case.*? According to the
Respondent, international law recognises the ‘fundamental prerogative right and duty of
States’ to conduct criminal investigations.*!* It submits that its investigation into Yukos

money laundering and tax evasion scheme,’>!> and that the resulting searches and seizures
were fully consistent with Russian law, as were the interviews of the Claimant’s
lawyers.*'® Moreover, the Respondent contends that Yukos Capital has failed to establish
that the Russian Federation’s investigation prevented it from presenting its case.5!’ The
Respondent submits that: (i) a letter between Yukos Capital and its attorneys suggests
that only copies of materials were seized;>!* and (ii) the record is ‘unclear’ as to why
Yukos Capital’s lawyer resigned and why the Claimant decided to proceed unrepresented
in the Second Bankruptcy Application.*"” In the Respondent’s view, the Claimant’s lack

of counsel at that stage, without more, cannot amount to a treaty breach.*°

(c) Fair and equitable treatment

. The Respondent raises the same defences against the Claimant’s FET claim as it does

against the expropriation claim. First, the Respondent opposes the Claimant’s main
factual claim and the contentions that comprise it: Russia discriminated against the
Claimant and its investment and disregarded due process norms in furtherance of a State-

wide campaign to transfer Yukos-related assets to the State and State-related entities.

Second, the Respondent submits that the Claimant has failed to establish that the
impugned acts were the proximate and factual cause of the Claimant’s loss. This

argument, summarised under expropriation, applies equally to the Claimant’s FET claim.

Third and finally, the Respondent maintains that the Claimant has failed to meet the

‘exacting’ standard required to demonstrate judicial misconduct. Therefore, the

Respondent contests the Claimant’s denial of justice and effective means claims, as well

as the FET claim insofar as it implicates judicial behaviour.

LEGALITY OF ‘INVESTMENTS’
1. The Respondent’s position

The Respondent contends that the Claimant’s investments are illegal under domestic and
international law, and therefore do not qualify as protected investments under the ECT.*”!
It alleges that the Claimant and the Loans were an integral part of a criminal enterprise
used for money laundering and tax evasion and are therefore outside the Tribunal’s

jurisdiction.°?

Specifically, the Respondent argues that: (i) the Loans are void under Russian and New
York law; (ii) the Claimant’s investments were illegal, and illegal investments are not
protected under the ECT and international law; (iii) the Claimant’s ‘unclean hands’
preclude protection under the ECT and international law; and (iv) the Claimant’s

investments violate international public policy.

(a) Legality of the investments under domestic law

. The Respondent contends that Claimant’s Loans were void ab initio under both Russian

law and New York law, and therefore do not qualify as investments under Article 1(6) of
the ECT.%3 It submits that if the Loans are objectively void as a matter of law, this is a
jurisdictional matter unaffected by whether the Respondent has previously raised these

arguments during the bankruptcy proceedings or elsewhere.>4

Beginning with Russian law, the Respondent first submits that the Loans contravened the

legal prohibitions on abuse of right and bad faith transactions in Articles 10 and 168 of

the Russian Civil Code because they facilitated the transfer of illegal proceeds. ° It

contends that a Russian court would not hesitate to invalidate a transaction made for the
purpose of laundering funds accumulated as a result of unlawful tax evasion, and
characterise it as a ‘bad faith’ transaction for the purposes of Articles 10 and 168 of the
Civil Code.°”6 In this sense, the Respondent argues that these provisions provide for a
‘good faith taxpayer’ doctrine under Russian law.°”” The Respondent also contends that
the Loans contravene these provisions because they violate the fundamental principle of
Russian ‘law prohibiting arbitrary interference by a party with the exercise of free rights
of its contractual counterparty.*”* In this respect, the Respondent argues that the loan
decisions were imposed on Yukos Capital by the Russian Yukos Group directors,°”? and
that the Loans did not confer any conceivable ‘benefit’ to Yukos Oil; only to Group
Menatep Ltd (Group Menatep), and Yukos Capital.*°

. The Respondent then submits that the Loans were a ‘mere facade’ executed to disguise

and facilitate illegal tax evasion and money laundering, and therefore constituted ‘sham’
or ‘mock’ transactions invalid under Article 170 of the Russian Civil Code.**! The
Respondent contends that the Loans were made for appearance purposes only, and that if
it is proved that funds were provided by Yukos Capital for some economic purpose other
than the genuine provision of credit on commercial terms, such as the payment of a large
dividend to Yukos Oil’s majority shareholders, then the Loans must be considered void

‘sham’ and ‘mock’ transactions.*” It further submits that an alternative purpose for the

Loans could have been to allow Yukos Oil later to claim its own funds in the bankruptcy

proceedings through Yukos Capital as the formal creditor.°*

. Turning to New York law, the Respondent submits that contracts made for an illegal
purpose or contrary to public policy are void and unenforceable thereunder.* It contends
that courts applying New York law have refused to enforce contracts made for the purpose
of avoiding New York law or foreign taxes,>>> or where the subject of the contract is the
proceeds or fruit of crime.** It further submits that fraudulent contracts are also void and
unenforceable under New York law, and refers to the use by courts of ‘badges of fraud’
to determine whether a contract was motivated by fraudulent intent.°7 In the present case,
the Respondent submits that these are: (i) the fact that the Claimant is a mere shell
company controlled by the ‘Yukos Oligarchs’; (ii) the Loans are structured as non-
recourse agreements; (iii) that the loan agreements did not state the purpose of the Loans;
(iv) that no security or collateral was provided against the Loans; (v) that the Loans were
part of a series of back-to-back loan arrangements; and (vi) that the Loans did not reflect
commercial reality and lacked economic substance.** On this basis, the Respondent

claims that the Loans are unenforceable under New York Law.

(b) Legality of the investment under international law

The Respondent submits that an investment must be ‘made in accordance with law’ in
order to benefit from ECT protection, *? and that this is a principle of general international
law that applies even in the absence of explicit treaty text. It contends that the ECT
must be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning of its terms in
their context and in light of its object and purpose.*"! In this regard, it points to the
reference, in the introductory note, to the ECT’s fundamental aim, being ‘to strengthen
the rule of law on energy issues,’ and argues that the ECT should therefore be interpreted
in a way that encourages respect for the rule of law.>*” The Respondent contends that the
ECT’s legality requirement is not constrained to infringements of the host State’s criminal

law, but extends to international law and other relevant national laws.543

The Respondent submits that the Loans were not made in accordance with law, and are
therefore not protected by the ECT. In light of what it terms the extensive and cross-
border nature of the criminal activity in this case, the Respondent submits that the Loans
are contrary to international law, international public policy and the national laws of both
Russia and other relevant implicated jurisdictions.™ It refers to its allegations of ‘treaty
abuse, tax evasion and wide-scale money laundering’ on the part of the Claimant, and
contends that such unlawful conduct cannot be viewed as minor or trivial so as to not

engage the legality requirement as argued by the Claimant. It also submits that the

Page 111 of 303

illegality of the Loans arises as from their inception, since they were designed with the

above illegal purposes in mind.*47

The Respondent contends that the applicable standard of proof in relation to this
jurisdictional objection is the ‘balance of probabilities’ or the ‘preponderance of
evidence’, even where allegations of serious criminal misconduct are made.** It argues
that, given the covert nature of the alleged crimes (tax evasion and money laundering), a
case will generally depend on an accumulation of circumstantial evidence.*? It submits
that the evidence in the present case raises a number of ‘red flags’, and that the Tribunal
should give significant weight to the fact that the Claimant is either unwilling or unable

to answer the serious questions that consequently arise.*°°

. With respect to its specific allegations of illegality, the Respondent contends that the

Loans were: (i)an instrument of abuse of the Luxembourg-Russia Double-Tax
Agreement (the Luxembourg DTA) giving rise to criminal tax evasion under Russian
law; and (ii) the proceeds of a scheme of criminal tax evasion under Russian criminal law

and money laundering, which the Respondent termed ‘the Laundromat.’**!

. Abuse of the Luxembourg DTA. First, the Respondent contends that the Loans constituted

an abuse of the Luxembourg DTA on the basis that the Claimant structured the Loans to
claim improperly such benefits of the Luxembourg DTA and avoid paying Russian
taxes.** It submits that a proper construction of the Luxembourg DTA requires that

Yukos Capital be the beneficial owner of the relevant income,** and that the Claimant

does not satisfy the meaning of beneficial ownership under the substance-over-form
approach required by international law.*** As to the Claimant’s permanent establishment
in Russia, the Respondent submits that this is a factual question answered by the evidence
demonstrating the management and control of Yukos Capital from Moscow by Yukos
Group executives. °° Finally, the Respondent submits that the non-pursuit of other
Russian companies using the Luxembourg DTA in the same manner as the Claimant is

not relevant to the question of the illegality of the Claimant’s behaviour.>

The Respondent submits that all three elements of the crime of tax evasion under Russian
law have been satisfied by the Claimant’s alleged abuse of the Luxembourg DTA.°°” The
Respondent relies on the evidence of Professor Esakov to argue that tax evasion under
Russian law has three elements: (i) non-payment of due taxes; (ii) failure to submit a tax
declaration or other required document, or knowingly including false information in such
documents; and (iii) non-payment of taxes on a large scale.*>8 Focusing primarily on the
second element, the Respondent contends that Yukos Capital and Yukos Oil made false
representations on tax declarations by stating that they were entitled to obtain the benefits
under the Luxembourg DTA, in circumstances where they knew they were not entitled to

such benefits.5?

The Respondent also submits that the Loans in and of themselves were impermissible
State Aid under EU law.*® It contends that the Luxembourg tax authorities had applied a
‘safe harbour’ rule to the Loans later determined illegal by the European Commission, **!

Agreements (ATAs) for the Loans which validated a cost-plus margin of less than half
the lowest rate permitted under the rule.5* It submits that no effort was made to check
whether the Loans corresponded to the economic reality of the underlying services, and
therefore the Loans benefitted from impermissible State Aid and were thus contrary to

law. 563

The ‘Laundromat’. Further or alternatively, the Respondent contends that the Loans were
the proceeds of a criminal scheme of tax evasion and money-laundering scheme within
the Yukos Group, which it terms the ‘Laundromat.’>* Under this head, the Respondent

relies upon its allegations of:

(i) Iilegal acts in the privatisation of Yukos in 1995;5%
(ii) Onshore tax evasion using ‘Closed Administrative-Territorial Formations’ or
“ZATOs’ 35

(iii) Onshore tax evasion using LTR Subsidiaries in other low-tax regions, notably

in this case, Fargoil and Ratibor;*6”

(iv) Offshore tax evasion through abuse of the Cyprus-Russia Double-Tax
Agreement (the Cyprus DTA); and finally (as already detailed),

(v) Offshore tax evasion through abuse of the Luxembourg DTA.

Relying on the evidence of Professor Pieth, the Respondent submits that the general
international consensus reveals two key elements of money laundering: (i) a predicate

criminal offence from which the funds or other property derives; and (ii) the act of

laundering itself (i.e. the transfer or concealment of the proceeds of crime by knowing
persons).°® In relation to (i), the Respondent contends that the predicate offences in the
present case, for which no conviction is formally required, include the corruption and
bribery of public officials in the privatisation of Yukos Oil, fraud, and both onshore and
offshore tax evasion.*” As to (ii), the Respondent argues that there are a number of ‘red
flags’ signalling that money laundering has occurred in the present case, including the use
of slush funds, trusts, shell companies, tax havens and frequent restructurings,
liquidations and name changes.°”' On this basis, the Respondent submits that the Loans
were an instrument of money laundering, and therefore an instrument of illegality not

entitled to the protections extended by the ECT.5”

(c) Clean hands

321. The Respondent alternatively submits that the Claimant’s claims should be precluded
because it comes to the Tribunal with ‘unclean hands’ by engaging in abusive and
wrongful conduct.*” It submits that the clean hands doctrine has been widely recognised
and applied in international law, including by arbitral tribunals as a basis to decline to
exercise jurisdiction.°” The Respondent submits that since the Russian Federation’s acts

argues that the application of the clean hands doctrine in international disputes where a
continuing violation was occurring does not limit the application of the principle to other
scenarios,5”’ and submits that the principle underpinning the clean hands doctrine (that
he who seeks equity must do equity) can apply in investment treaty disputes where

damages are sought, rather than be protection against a continuing violation.5”8

(d) International public policy

323. The Respondent submits that the Loans violate international public policy because they
were advanced both to launder the proceeds of crime and to evade taxes.*” It contends
that it is well-established that claims arising from investments that violate international
public policy cannot benefit from protections offered by international investment
treaties. 58° Noting that investment tribunals have previously identified a rule of
international public policy prohibiting corruption and bribery,™*! the Respondent submits
that such rule also extends to tax evasion and money laundering since those crimes are
the focus of the same anti-corruption treaties that formed the basis for the rule in relation

to corruption and bribery.*

324. First, the Respondent contends that there is an international public policy against tax
evasion, noting that tax evasion has severe consequences for the international community
and is against the international legal order.5® It contends that a rule of international public
policy against tax evasion can be established through an examination of State and
international practice, and is not precluded by the absence of a formal ‘international
criminal tax law.’** In this regard, the Respondent submits that combating tax evasion
has become a pressing priority at the national and international levels,>* and highlights
the criminalisation of and serious sanctions imposed for tax offences in numerous
domestic jurisdictions.**° The Respondent further argues that the relevant period for
assessing a rule of international public policy is the time of adjudication, not the time of
the acts in question, as public policy is a mandatory imperative binding on a tribunal in

the present.*8”

Second, the Respondent argues that there is a clear emergence of an international public
policy against money laundering, *** noting that this is not disputed by the Claimant.>” It
contends that money laundering has serious and wide-ranging consequences, and that it
amounts to a threat to the integrity of the world’s banking system.” It submits that the
detection and prevention of money laundering is a priority at both the national and

international levels, and that such developments demonstrate the emergence of

international public policy in this regard.5!

. Finally, the R d ds that the application of i ional public policy is not

P PP
contingent on the establishment of criminal conduct under any particular domestic law,
as that would render the international public policy defence otiose.> It argues that it
would be unprincipled for a tribunal to endorse conduct contrary to an established
international legal consensus simply because the law of the host State did not at the

relevant time proscribe the conduct in question.5%

2. The Claimant’s position

The Claimant submits that the Respondent’s jurisdictional objection on illegality grounds
cannot succeed. It contends that the Respondent’s arguments are undermined by its
assumption that the crimes of tax evasion and money laundering have been committed,>*
submitting that there is no underlying criminal conduct or similar behaviour that could
form the basis for the Respondent’s objection.°* In any event, the Claimant makes
specific submissions in relation to the legality of the investment, the clean hands doctrine

and international public policy, which are set out below.

(a) Legality of the investments under domestic law

The Claimant submits that the transactions were not ‘mock’ or ‘sham’ transactions under
Russian law. In addition to its general submissions regarding the overall legality of the
Yukos Oil arrangement, the Claimant contends that there is no evidence of any lack of
intent on the part of the trading companies and Yukos Oil to create the legal consequences
entailed by the oil sale contracts.>% It argues that the Russian Tax Ministry had the
opportunity to challenge both the eligibility of the trading companies for the preferences

claimed and the transfer pricing used in the relevant transactions, but submits that the

Respondent chose not to do so.5%”

329. The Claimant further submits that the assessment of good faith under the Russian Civil
Code relates only to the relationship between the taxpayer and its business counterparty,
not between a taxpayer and the State.°"8 It therefore contends, drawing support from the
authorities cited by the Respondent, that Articles 168-170 of the Russian Civil Code do
not serve as useful tools for the tax authorities, since the Civil Code concept of good faith
as between civil parties does not apply outside that context—for example, in Russian tax
law (between taxpayers and the State).>» It therefore rejects the concept of a ‘good faith
taxpayer’ doctrine, and submits that any reference to good faith in the taxation context

has no relation to civil law good faith.

330.

°

The Claimant also contends that it is striking that the Respondent has never before made
the submission that the Loans were void ab initio or were sham or mock transactions
under Articles 10, 168 or 170 of the Russian Civil Code.™ It points out that there was no
reference to these provisions in the 2000 Tax Assessment or in the court decisions that

upheld it.

(b) Legality of the investment under the ECT

331.

The Claimant first notes the absence of an express legality requirement in the ECT, and
argues that a number of ECT tribunals have rejected the argument that such a requirement

should be read into the Treaty.®°? While maintaining its general submission that there is

no illegality present in this case, the Claimant contends that the language of the ECT
suggests a bar to Respondent’s illegality defence as a matter of jurisdiction.*™ Further,
the Claimant submits that the question of illegality applies only at the time of the making
of the investment, and not to subsequent actions during the performance of the

investment.

The Claimant also submits that the Respondent bears a ‘particularly heavy’ burden of
proof in relation to an admissibility defence based on illegality. While not defining the
precise standard to be applied in the present case, the Claimant notes that some tribunals
have applied standards higher than the balance of probabilities, such as ‘reasonable
certainty’ or ‘clear and convincing evidence.’ The Claimant submits that, whatever the

standard is, the Respondent has failed to meet it in this case.

With reference to its general submission that the Yukos Oil arrangement was not illegal,
the Claimant addresses the following allegations made by the Respondent in turn:
(i) alleged onshore tax evasion; (ii) alleged offshore tax evasion; (iii) alleged abuse of the
Luxembourg DTA and EU State Aid rules; (iv) mens rea with respect to the alleged
money laundering scheme; and (v) the absence of a connection between the Loans and

the privatisation of Yukos Oil.°”

Onshore tax evasion. The Claimant submits that there is no legal basis for the conclusion
that Yukos Oil’s ‘tax optimisation’ scheme constituted money laundering.*'° It contends
that, in the relevant period, the Russian Criminal Code expressly excluded tax evasion as

a predicate offence for money laundering, and therefore even if tax evasion could be

proved it could not form the basis for that offence.®"' It further submits that an application
of current laws (which include tax evasion as a predicate offence) would offend the
criminal law principle that an accused must have reason to know that the conduct being
engaged in was a crime.°!? The Claimant then argues that money laundering also requires
a conviction for the predicate offence, and submits that no convictions were obtained in
the present case.®' It also submits that, even if there was a legal basis for a money
laundering argument, no tax evasion was committed in any event and Yukos Oil’s tax

structure was legal.°!4

335. Asto the act of laundering, the Claimant argues that the Loans were not made with money
criminally acquired by the Claimant or as a result of it having committed a crime, as they
were borrowed from other companies in the Yukos Group.*! It contends that the only
‘predicate offence’ alleged against it is its role in assisting Yukos Oil to ‘eliminate the
obligation to pay withholding tax on interest payments under the Loans’, and that the
proceeds therefrom were not used to make the Loans.®"6 Further, the Claimant contends
that the reasons for the giga-dividend were legitimate, and therefore was not the aim of
any money laundering exercise.°"” In any event, it submits that only a fraction of the funds
paid to the Cyprus holding companies, Dunsley and Nassaubridge (the Cyprus
companies) by way of dividend resulted from savings in corporate profit tax and that the
remainder remained untainted by any offence, and further contends that the Respondent

has not proved that the funds for the Loans originated from these small fractions."

336. The Claimant also submits that the Respondent cannot show that a manager or other
individual involved had the requisite mens rea to commit a crime. It contends that, since

all major companies in Russia engaged in the use of trading companies in the low-tax
regions and the tax authorities were aware of it, no-one could have been on notice that

such activity was criminal.©! The Claimant further argues that no weight should be given

to the conclusions of the Respondent’s expert Professor Esakov on this matter, since his

analysis is premised on an assumption that criminal tax evasion had occurred.°

337. Offshore tax evasion. As a starting point, the Claimant submits that the alleged use of the
Cyprus DTA to minimise withholding tax on dividends from the Russian trading
companies, even if proved, cannot constitute a predicate offence for money laundering
under Russian law for the same reasons it advances regarding its onshore activities! It

also repeats its argument that the Respondent has not proved that the funds for the Loans

originated from the small fractions of the dividends from the Russian trading companies

allegedly representing illegal tax savings.©

338. More generally, the Claimant also submits that there was no illegality in connection with
the offshore structure. It argues that the effect of the Cyprus DTA was to reduce Russian
withholding tax on dividends to non-Russian companies from 15% to 5%, and that
dividends paid to Russian companies in the same circumstances would have been taxed
at 6%.°3 The Claimant submits that the realisation of the 1% spread between these figures

would be too insignificant to justify putting the ‘Laundromat’ into operation.

339. The Claimant then contends that benefits under the Cyprus DTA were rightly claimed.°>
It submits that the only live issues in this regard are whether the Cyprus companies were
beneficial owners of the dividends distributed, and whether those companies had a
permanent establishment in Russia.°% To the first question, the Claimant submits that

Russia’s position on beneficial ownership at the relevant time was a formal one, and relies

 

on Russian tax authorities’ guid: and the of the sub over form

2)
approach by a Russian court.’ On this basis, the Claimant contends that the Cyprus
companies both satisfy the formal standard for beneficial ownership, being residence in
Cyprus and legal control over whether to retain or distribute the dividends they
received.©8 To the second question, the Claimant submits that under Russian tax law at
the time, a foreign entity—such as the Cyprus companies—would not be considered to
have a permanent establishment in Russia where its assets consisted of equity and debt
investments and it did not conduct active commercial activities in the Russian
Federation. It further contends that evidence of effective management in Russia is not
relevant since the relevant legal amendment to this effect occurred in 2015,° and further
that such effective management could not be established by the Respondent in any

event.©!

340. Abuse of the Luxembourg DTA and EU State Aid rules. First, the Claimant argues that the
Respondent cannot re-open the issues of whether the Claimant was eligible to claim the
benefit of the Luxembourg DTA, since that was already determined by the Tribunal in

the Interim Award. Nevertheless, the Claimant submits that the two live issues relating

to the Luxembourg DTA are whether Yukos Capital was a resident of Luxembourg and
whether it had a permanent establishment in Russia.“ To the first question, the Claimant
submits that the Respondent’s expert has conceded that Yukos Capital was lawfully
entitled to obtain its Luxembourg tax residency certificate, and further argues that
companies owned by the Respondent have taken the same approach as the Claimant in
this regard. {t also argues that there is no beneficial ownership concept incorporated
into the Luxembourg DTA, and that as a matter of Russian tax law this would have been
satisfied in any event as the beneficial owner concept at the time was equivalent to the
legal owner.©5 As to the second question, the Claimant argues that Russian law did not
have an ‘effective management’ standard for determining permanent establishment at the
relevant time,®%° and that the Respondent cannot prove that the Claimant was partly
managed from within Russia in any event.” On this basis, the Claimant asserts that it

was entitled to claim the benefits of the Luxembourg DTA.°%

341, The Claimant then addresses the Respondent’s submissions regarding the BU State Aid

rules, arguing that the European Commission decision determining that the Luxembourg
rule was illegal did not apply to the ATAs in the present case, but to a previous system.5?
It also argues that there is no evidence that the Commission had referred Luxembourg’s
non-compliance with its directive to the European Court of Justice,° that even the

Respondent’s tax expert does not suggest that the ATAs in respect of the Loans were

unlawful, **! and finally that any breach of the EU’s State Aid rules would be an unlawful

act by Luxembourg, not the Claimant,

342. Failure to prove mens rea. The Claimant then submits that the Respondent has failed to
show that anyone at Yukos Oil or Yukos Capital believed that there were issues with the
legality of the offshore tax arrangements, and therefore the Respondent cannot
demonstrate criminal intent in that regard. The Claimant submits that Yukos Oil’s
offshore structure was intended to create a platform for international expansion, and in
support contends that the relevant offshore elements were created with the advice and
assistance of international experts, corporate and legal advisers, as well as professional
auditors and tax advisors.“ It contends that its reliance on professional tax advisors is
significant in light of the accepted principle of tax law that international tax optimisation
is not criminal if the taxpayer believes in good faith that the actions taken do not give rise
to an additional tax liability.©> The Claimant further argues that the Respondent does not
identify the specific individual(s) possessing the criminal intent to evade tax and launder

the proceeds of that crime, since that allegation amounts to no more than invention.

343. Absence of connection between the Loans and privatisation. The Claimant contends that
there is no connection between the Loans and the privatisation of Yukos Oil.” To the
extent that the Respondent relies on bribery of former Yukos Oil managers as a predicate
offence for money laundering, the Claimant submits that there was no such bribery and
further that any question of bribery is irrelevant in any event. It contends that all

relevant activity that the Respondent relies upon for the bribery allegation occurred prior

to Yukos Capital’s incorporation and the making of the Loans, and that the funds later
used for the Loans were drawn from Yukos Oil’s oil production activities—not any
alleged bribery.™® It further submits that, as in the Hulley Final Awards and therefore
here, the Respondent cannot demonstrate that the alleged illegalities to which it refers are

sufficiently connected with the final investment transaction.

344. The Claimant also submits that even if the alleged bribery had occurred, money
laundering requires the use of the proceeds of the specific predicate offence alleged (i.e.
bribery).®*' It argues that, if the proceeds of the alleged bribery are ‘tainted shares’ held
by the majority shareholders, Yukos Oil’s cash flows remain separate to such shares and
therefore cannot be said to be the proceeds of any alleged bribery. The Claimant also
points to the lack of conviction or any charges brought by the Russian authorities
regarding the Yukos Oil privatisation, or against any of the individuals alleged to have
committed the crimes in question.® Finally, the Claimant submits that the limitation
period for bribery has expired under the Russian Criminal Code,® and that no tolling
argument can succeed since the Respondent has known about the arrangements with the

former Yukos Oil managers since at least 2003.5

345. In relation to the Respondent’s specific allegation that a bribe was paid by Yukos
executives to the former managers of Yukos Oil, the Claimant submits that this is not a

bribe. It contends that it was common practice to conclude agreements between potential

 

and pany during the acquisition process in order to incentivise

managers to increase the chances of profitability of the acquired company. 656 The

Claimant refers to the evidence of Mr Misamore, who states that Yukos Oil’s accountants

were also aware of and indeed assisted in documenting the legal arrangement.%7

346. In conclusion, the Claimant submits that the Respondent's illegality defence must fail,
and that ‘the Laundromat is an invention conjured in bad faith in an attempt by

Respondent to avoid being held responsible for its very serious violations of the ECT.”

(c) Clean hands

347. Turning to the Respondent’s clean hands argument, the Claimant contends that, under
international law, there is no general interpretation of the clean hands doctrine that would
effectively bar an investor’s claim. It argues that the authorities cited by the
Respondent are inapposite, since the tribunals in those cases declined jurisdiction because
the investment itself had been procured via illegal means such as fraud or corruption,

which it submits does not advance the Respondent’s case beyond illegality.&°

348. The Claimant submits that the elements to be satisfied to bar a claim under the clean hands
doctrine are: (i) the breach must concern a continuing violation; (ii) the appropriate
remedy sought by the claimant should relate to protection against a continuing violation
and not past violations; and (iii) there must be a relationship of reciprocity between the
obligations considered; namely, that the defendant’s reliance on its clean hands argument

must flow from the reciprocal obligation by the claimant as the basis for its claim.°*!

349. According to the Claimant, the Respondent has failed to satisfy these three
requirements. It submits that the Respondent’s breach is not continuing, that it is not
seeking specific performance but rather compensation, and that the Claimant has not itself
violated a reciprocal obligation on which it then seeks to rely. On this basis, the

Claimant contends that the clean hands doctrine does not apply.

(d) International public policy

350. The Claimant submits that the Respondent’s argument relying on international public
policy must fail. It contends that the authorities relied upon by the Respondent do not
support the view that tribunals may dismiss claims on international public policy grounds
independently from a finding of illegality,® adding that international public policy has
never been invoked to preclude a claim in the absence of illegality and that such illegality
(if it existed) is limited to bribery of foreign public officials or contracts secured by
fraudulent misrepresentation. The Claimant therefore concludes that tax evasion
without any other conduct cannot not give rise to public policy considerations, and that,
while there are international initiatives aimed at preventing tax evasion, those do not
amount to a system of international criminal tax law which could give rise to international

public policy considerations.§”

law and international tax law. It has had the benefit of very detailed and learned
submissions of counsel, both in their written memorials and in oral pleading, summarised
in Part V above. In order to decide the matter it will be necessary to consider these

arguments, and the evidence relevant to them, carefully and in detail.

352. However, before embarking on this exercise, the Tribunal makes some preliminary
observations about the way in which it approaches the overall character of the present

case so as to frame the ensuing analysis. These observations concern:
(i) The claim as based upon an investment made by way of a loan; and

(ii) The relation between the alleged causes of action.

1. An investment constituted by a loan

353. The present case is one of a number of disputes that have arisen in diverse international
courts and tribunals between the holders of interests in Yukos Oil and the Russian

Federation over the circumstances that ultimately led to the demise of that company.

354. This case nevertheless falls to be considered on its own merits. The Tribunal is not bound
by the decisions of other tribunals. It is common ground that the prior decisions give rise
to no estoppel and that each Party has borne the burden of proving by way of evidence
adduced before the present Tribunal the facts on which it relies to support its claim or

defence.

355. The Claimant’s claim has a feature that distinguishes it from the majority of other
investment arbitration claims. The Claimant was never a shareholder in Yukos Oil. The
investment upon which it is founded was made by way of loans. Moreover the Claimant
was an intra-Group finance company, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Yukos Oil.
It advanced the Loans to its parent in that capacity. As a result, Yukos Oil stood in the

position of debtor vis-a-vis the Claimant, its creditor.

°§ PO N° 6, [41]. Claimant withdrew its plea of collateral estoppel during the course of the Hearing: T9/2090/20-
21 (Claimant).

356. The Tribunal has already decided, by majority, for the reasons set out in its Interim

Award, that the Claimant ‘does own an asset constituted by a debt of a company

associated with an Economic Activity in the Energy Sector in the Area of the Respondent

such that it has made an Investment to which the present dispute with the Respondent

relates.’° In order to reach that conclusion, it determined (in summary) that, for the

purpose of the ECT:

@

Gi)

(iii)

An investment may be made by way of a loan, provided that such investment
has both a legal materialisation (being an asset belonging to the claimant) and an
economic materialisation (being a commitment of resources that constitutes both

an economic contribution and an assumption of risk).o”

The Claimant had made a contribution to an economic activity in the Russian
Federation by way of the Loans. This contribution was not to be determined by

671

reference to the origin of the funds®”' nor was it excluded because the Loans

were made by way of inter-company transfers within a corporate group.°”

The making of an investment by way of a loan also involves an assumption of
tisk as to the success or failure of the venture, which would in turn affect the
prospects for repayment.°” In the instant case, the only holder of the right to
repayment of the debt constituted by the Loans in the present case was Yukos
Capital. The fact that it had entered into back-to-back arrangements with two
other Yukos Group companies (Brittany and Hedgerow) did not affect that
position since it had not ‘transferred that right—legally or beneficially—to
Brittany.’

357. Throughout these proceedings, the Claimant has insisted on its separate corporate
personality. It invokes its right to pursue the present claim based on the rights that it alone

is entitled to vindicate under the Loans, which it asserts are separate and distinct from the

claims of the shareholders in relation to the treatment of Yukos Oil.

358. Nevertheless, at the merits stage, the fact that the investment was made by way of a loan
does affect the scope of the matters that are legally relevant to the determination of the
claim. Yukos Capital is not a member of Yukos Oil. It is its creditor. As the International
Court of Justice held in Barcelona Traction: ‘Creditors do not have any right to claim
compensation from a person who, by wronging their debtor, causes them loss. In such

cases, no doubt, the interests of the aggrieved are affected, but not their rights.’6”°

359. The Tribunal considers that this principle is applicable in the case of a claim under the
ECT that is founded upon a loan. It applies in the present context with particular cogency.
The Claimant itself does not conflate its rights with those of Yukos Oil. On the contrary,
its claim is founded upon its distinct right. Were it otherwise, there would be an
unconscionable overlap with the claim already pursued by Yukos Oil before the European
Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) and determined there and the claims of the Yukos Oil
shareholders, which have already been pursued and determined in prior ECT arbitration

proceedings.

360. The necessary consequence is that the focus of this Award will be on the alleged invasion
of the rights of Yukos Capital vis-a-vis its Loans. That is not to say that: (i) the
circumstances in which those Loans were made; and (ii) the course of events by which
the Loans were not repaid in full is irrelevant to the Tribunal’s enquiry. On the contrary,

both form an essential part of the context against which the Tribunal will assess the claim.

361.

Indeed, both Parties rely on elements of the wider course of events in advancing their

rival claims and defences:

(i) The Claimant alleges that the tax reassessments raised against Yukos Oil were

part of an orchestrated campaign by the Russian State to drive Yukos Oil into

bankruptcy and deprive it of its assets. It contends that these acts in turn deprived
Yukos Oil of its ability to repay the Loans. The subsequent disallowance of a
claim for the debt in the bankruptcy was simply part and parcel of a composite

act that affected the Yukos Group as a whole.

(ii) The Respondent, whilst denying that the Claimant is entitled to invoke a claim
based on acts directed against Yukos Oil, nevertheless affirmatively relies on
what it sees as the inextricable connection between the two companies for its
positive case. It alleges that the Loans were simply part of an illegal scheme or
‘Laundromat’ devised by Yukos Oil to evade the payment of tax in Russia by
circulating the profits made by oil trading within the Yukos Group around group
companies both inside and outside Russia for the enrichment of the Yukos Oil

shareholders,

(iii) For its part, the Claimant accepts that, whatever may be the precise legal basis,
if the Respondent were to persuade the Tribunal that the Claimant was ‘engaged
in a vast operation of criminal tax evasion and criminal money-laundering’ it

would not prevail in the arbitration.6%

362. The Tribunal will need to consider and evaluate aspects of the wider record of events
concerning the Yukos Group as a whole in order to decide these allegations. But it is
important to be clear from the outset as to the basis upon which it does so. The Tribunal
has no mandate to re-determine the entirety of the acts of the Russian State against the
Yukos Group. Nor (as already observed) is it entitled to rely for this purpose on the
findings of prior tribunals. It is solely concerned with the investment made by the
Claimant and the allegations of expropriation and unfair treatment directed against that

investment.

considered together when the Tribunal is assessing whether the Respondent has

committed an international delict.6”” But this does not make all of the acts allegedly
directed against Yukos Oil ipso facto part of a composite act directed against Yukos
Capital. That would run counter to the principle that the position of a creditor is legally
distinct from that of its debtor. However, this does not exclude the possibility that the
alleged acts of the Respondent were part of a campaign directed against the Claimant as
part of the Yukos Group, along with Yukos Oil and other members of the Group. But the
purpose of the Tribunal’s enquiry will be to determine the relevance of those acts to, and

their effect upon, the Claimant.

364. A different way of putting the same point is as a matter of causation: the alleged acts must
cause the loss to the creditor. For this purpose, the Tribunal’s enquiry must be directed at
considering those acts that are the proximate cause of the creditor’s loss. The chain of
causation may be broken if the acts are too remote or if the actions of the creditor or of a
third party intervene. The Tribunal will return to consider the implications of this point

in Part VII below on causation.

365. The Tribunal considers that similar considerations must also necessarily guide its
approach to the Respondent’s case on illegality. The question for the Tribunal is whether
the investment constituted by the Claimant’s Loans was tainted by illegality when it was
made so as to deprive the Claimant of the protections of the ECT or its rights under the
Loans. In approaching this question, the Tribunal will have to determine whether the
Loans constitute the proceeds of illegal acts of tax evasion and money laundering. This
in turn requires an enquiry into the role played by the Loans as part of a larger transaction
of which they form a part and the role of other persons in guiding and directing that

transaction.

366.

a

Such an enquiry does not mandate the Tribunal to consider the conduct of Yukos Oil in
its tax affairs generally in matters unrelated to the transaction giving rise to the Loans,
nor that of its shareholders from their initial acquisition of that company. This, too, would
be to conflate the issue necessarily engaged by the Claimant’s making of the Loans with

other matters that are not germane to that issue and do not properly concern the present

dispute. For this reason, the Tribunal must exclude those parts of the Respondent’s
‘Laundromat’ case that relate to: (i) acts alleged to have taken place in the initial
privatisation of Yukos; or (ii) the use of trading companies other than those specifically

in the Armenian Branch used to fund the Loans.

2. The relation between the causes of action

The second issue of general import that arises from the way in which the present case is
advanced is the relationship between the causes of action that the Claimant advances
respectively under Article 13 (Expropriation) and Article 10 (Promotion, Protection and
Treatment of Investments) of the ECT insofar as these claims relate to the Respondent’s
treatment of the Claimant’s investment in the bankruptcy.

The Claimant submits that its treatment in the bankruptcy of Yukos Oil amounts to both:
(i) ‘judicial expropriation’; and (ii) a violation of the guarantee of fair and equitable

treatment.

. These interrelated claims give rise to four interrelated preliminary sub-issues of law:

(i) What is the standard applicable to a claim of expropriation by the judicial organs
of the State?

(ii) Must the Claimant establish that the actions of the judiciary constitute a failure

of ‘due process of law’ amounting to a denial of justice?

(iii) What is the relationship in this context between a failure of due process and

illegality?

(iv) In the circumstances of the present case, does the claim under Article 10 import
a different or lesser standard or include other considerations in respect of the
liability of the Respondent that would not otherwise be applicable under
Article 13?

Application of expropriation to judicial acts. Article 13 of the ECT provides in pertinent
part:

Page 134 of 303

(1) Investments of Investors of a Contracting Party in the Area of any other
Contracting Party shall not be nationalized, expropriated or subjected to a
measure or measures having effect equivalent to nationalization or
expropriation (hereinafter referred to as “Expropriation”) except where such
Expropriation is:

(a) _ for a purpose which is in the public interest;
(b) not discriminatory;
(c) carried out under due process of law; and

(d) accompanied by the payment of prompt, adequate and effective
compensation.

371. Article 13 (which is in a form widely recognised in general international law) imposes

aI four requirements for the validity of a taking of property: (i) public interest purpose;
(ii) non-discrimination; (iii) due process of law; and (iv) compensation. All four such

requirements must be met. Otherwise, the taking will constitute an expropriation, giving

rise to a breach of Article 13. So far as concerns liability in the present case, the principal

areas of dispute between the Parties have concerned (iii) due process of law and (ii) non-

discrimination. The Tribunal will consider the due process requirement first.

372. Neither Article 13 nor the ECT as a whole draws any distinction in relation to this

obligation between the organs of the Contracting Party.

373. General international law draws no distinction between the organs of the State in ascribing
the responsibility of the State for a breach of an international obligation. The general rule
is:

The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under
international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any
other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the State, and

whatever its character as an organ of the central Government or of a territorial unit
of the State.6”*

374. The acts of the judiciary may therefore engage the responsibility of a State for
expropriation as much as the acts of executive officials, as other investment tribunals have
recognised.°” Where, as here, the alleged taking consists of a number of acts taken by

both executive and judicial organs of the State, the tribunal must therefore consider the

totality of the State’s conduct vis-a-vis its treatment of the investment.

375. Although (as in this case) an alleged taking as a result of judicial decision has sometimes

been referred to for convenience as ‘judicial expropriation’ ,®° in the view of the Tribunal

such reference does not denote a separate or distinct cause of action.

376. Nevertheless the application of the expropriation test to judicial organs gives rise to some
specific considerations, which flow from the nature of the judicial task. An important
function of municipal courts is to determine claims to property according to the applicable
law. Such courts cannot normally be faulted if they determine such rights in accordance
with due process; apply a law that is not in itself expropriatory; do not subject the investor
to discrimination and reach a result that is not manifestly improper, whether or not the
result is to deprive the claimant of its property. As the tribunal in Garzanti Koza put it:

A seizure of property by a court as a result of normal domestic legal process does
not amount to an expropriation under international law unless there was an element
of serious and fundamental impropriety about the legal process.
377. The question in such cases, consistent with the requirements of Article 13, is whether the

court has reached its decision ‘under due process of law’ and without discrimination.

378. Due process of law and denial of justice. The requirement of Article 13(1)(c) that any
taking be in accordance with ‘due process of law’ 682 imports a set of considerations that

are also engaged when an international court or tribunal is required to determine whether

Page 136 of 303
a State has acted in an arbitrary manner giving rise to a denial of justice, since, as a
Chamber of the International Court of Justice has observed:
Arbitrariness is not so much something opposed to a rule of law, as something,
opposed to the rule of law... It is a wilful disregard of due process of law, an act
which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of juridical propriety.°
379. When it is the acts of the municipal courts that are being considered, the considerations
that apply in the case of a denial of justice will also determine whether due process of law
has been followed for the purpose of an expropriation claim. That is to say: the
international tribunal will be concerned to enquire whether the claimant has been afforded
access to the court for a hearing on the merits of its claim; without undue delay; in
accordance with a fair procedure. The international tribunal may also scrutinise the
judgments of the municipal court. This is not with a view to substituting its decision on
questions of municipal law to that of the municipal court. The international tribunal is not
a court of appeal on matters of municipal law. Nevertheless, the decision itself may

constitute relevant evidence of judicial propriety or impropriety. *4

380.

S

It is important to be clear about the point that is being made here. An expropriation claim
is concerned with a substantive deprivation of property; whereas a denial of justice claim
(like a claim for breach of a guarantee of fair and equitable treatment more generally) is
concerned with the process of decision-making by the State and its effect upon the

investor.

38

. Nevertheless, as a constituent requirement of the ECT protection from expropriation is
the requirement that any taking be ‘under due process of law’, the tribunal must consider
the process of decision as part of its evaluation of whether a breach of Article 13 has been
committed. Where the impugned acts of the State include judicial acts, this means that it
will be necessary for the conduct of the judiciary to be assessed according to the same

standard and applying the same factors as would arise in a denial of justice claim.

382. Due process of law and ‘illegality’, There is some suggestion in prior arbitral awards and
in the Parties’ pleadings that the test for the Tribunal is one of ‘illegality’. This may be
traced in particular to the award in Saipem.®* The Tribunal doubts whether this criterion
is of much assistance in clarifying the nature of its task. In Saipem itself, the treaty
provision for expropriation at issue in the case imposed a condition that the measures be
‘in conformity with all legal provisions and procedures.’ ®7 It was common ground in that
case that this entitled the tribunal to consider questions of illegality under both municipal
and international law. The tribunal made clear that it only considered this question
because of the Parties’ ‘agreement that the unlawful character of the actions was a
necessary condition’ and was not otherwise to be treated as a departure from the doctrine
that would normally apply.®® The Saipem tribunal also found a distinct breach by
Pakistan of its obligations under the New York Convention on the Recognition and
Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards 1958. °° This factor, particular to the
circumstances of that case, enabled it to apply the consideration of illegality under
international law to a concrete breach of a treaty obligation, in addition to its more general

finding of abuse of right.

383. In the present case, the treaty test is ‘due process of law’ not ‘illegality.’ An international
tribunal is not to be conflated with a final court of appeal on legality under municipal law.
It is only concerned with whether a breach of international law has been committed. That
is a distinct question of legality under international law, since:
The characterization of an act of a State as internationally wrongful is governed by

international law. Such characterization is not affected by the characterization of the
same act as lawful by internal law.

In the present context, legality under international law can only be determined by
reference to the standard specified under Article 13 of the ECT, which comprises each of
the specified elements, including the requirement of ‘due process’. It does not add
anything, and may only add an element of circularity or confusion, to describe the test as

one of illegality.

Due process of law and fair and equitable treatment. Article 10 of the ECT provides in

relevant part:

(1) Each Contracting Party shall... encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable
and transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make
Investments in its Area. Such conditions shall include a commitment to accord at all
times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable
treatment. Such Investments shall also enjoy the most constant protection and
security and no Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or
discriminatory their ti use, or
disposal. ...

(12) Each Contracting Party shall ensure that its domestic law provides effective
means for the assertion of claims and the enforcement of rights with respect to
Investments. ...

. The Tribunal will have considered the question whether the Respondent accorded the

Claimant’s investment ‘due process of law’ and whether any taking was or was not
‘discriminatory’ for the purpose of its assessment of the claim of expropriation under
Article 13. In so doing, as explained above, it will examine the same factors that also
apply under Article 10. In the circumstances of this case, it would only be if the Tribunal
were to reach the view that the claim did not otherwise constitute a breach of Article 13
(as, for example, if the Tribunal were to take the view that the act did not constitute a
taking) that it would be obliged to go on to consider whether there was, in the alternative,
a breach of Article 10.

For this reason, the Tribunal will concentrate its attention on the claim of expropriation.
If that claim is sustained, it will be unnecessary for it to consider the alternative
formulation of the claim under Article 10, since it would not add anything to the analysis

or the relief sought.

In view of the matters that are at issue in this case and the analysis above, the Tribunal

will now proceed to consider the evidence as to whether or not the Claimant’s property

in the sums advanced under the Loans was taken without due process of !aw such that it

amounted to a denial of justice and was discriminatory.
EXPROPRIATION

1. Introduction

The Claimant’s written case alleged that the Respondent’s conduct constituted:
(i expropriation through a composite act; (ii) judicial expropriation; and (iii) a violation

of the guarantee of fair and equitable treatment vouchsafed by Article 10 of the Treaty.
In closing, it drew these threads together into two propositions:

(i) Russia enacted a politically-motivated plan to destroy Yukos Oil through the

imposition of tax assessments that had no basis;®"! and

{ii) The treatment of the Claimant in the bankruptcy constituted breaches of the ECT,
and in particular the denial of the Claimant’s claims violated the guarantee of
fair and equitable treatment, including through a denial of justice and judicial

expropriation.

For the reasons already developed above in Part VI.A, the Tribunal has reached the view

that:

(i) This case is concerned with the Respondent's treatment of Yukos Capital’s claim
under the Loans, and not the claims of its debtor Yukos Oil or other members of
the Yukos Group (Part VIL.A.1);

(ii) As a consequence, the first question for the Tribunal is to assess whether the

refusal to admit the Loans in the bankruptcy of Yukos Oil amounts to
expropriation under Article 13 of the ECT (Part VI.A.2);

a

‘not discriminatory.” These considerations are the same as those applicable
under Article 10. So it would only be necessary for the Tribunal to consider the
claim for failure to provide fair and equitable treatment in the event that, for

other reasons, the claim under Article 13 is not established.

. Asa result of these conclusions, the Tribunal will consider first the Claimant’s treatment
in the bankruptcy, analysing the record as to the facts (section 2) and then the question

whether this amounts in international law to a breach of Article 13 of the ECT (section 3).

391

392. At that point, it will also consider whether the treatment of the Claimant was part of an
orchestrated campaign against it and other members of the Yukos Group.

393

. The Claimant identifies eight elements of the Claimant’s treatment in bankruptcy that it

said, individually and collectively, breached the ECT:9

(i) The Claimant’s applications in the bankruptcy were rejected on spurious grounds

without any proper legal analysis;

(ii) The Claimant’s appeals were suspended and eventually terminated without its

claims being heard;

(iii) The Claimant’s lawyers were intimidated, including by searches and raids of the
Claimant’s and its lawyers’ offices (as part of a campaign against lawyers acting

for Yukos Group entities generally);

(iii) In considering that question, the Tribunal will also consider whether its
conclusions under (ii) are further supported by evidence suggesting that the
treatment of Yukos Capital was part of a campaign directed against the Claimant
as part of the Yukos Group, along with Yukos Oil and other members of the

Group.

(iv) The test for expropriation under Article 13 of the ECT requires consideration of
whether any State taking was carried out ‘under due process of law’ and was

(iv) Documents were seized in violation of Russian law;

(vy) Attempts were made to expropriate the Claimant through a rigged auction of

Yukos Finance;

(vi) Criminal investigations were started to stall the Claimant’s applications and

intimidate the Claimant and its counsel;

(vii) Vexatious invalidation claims were brought to stall the Claimant’s applications;

and

(viii) Discriminatory treatment was suffered compared with non-Yukos-related

creditors.

394. The Respondent maintains that the Claimant has failed to establish the high threshold
necessary for expropriation by its judicial organs, The Russian courts had dismissed

Yukos Capital’s claims on good legal grounds and without judicial impropriety.

2. Treatment of Yukos Capital in the bankruptcy

395. The Tribunal has summarised at a high level the background facts to this arbitration in
Part II] above. In this section of the Award, it reviews the evidence concerning the

treatment of Yukos Capital in the bankruptcy in particular.
396. Sources of evidence:

(i) The only witness of fact to give evidence and appear before the Tribunal in
relation to the detail of the bankruptcy proceedings for either Party was
Mr Rudolph Mkhitaryan, a witness for the Claimant, who had been appointed
Head of the Legal Department at Yukos Refining and Marketing in 2005.°°
Mr Mkhitaryan travelled to London on 5 April 2006 and did not thereafter return

penalty.” It confirmed by letter dated 12 July 2006 that it had received the Claimant’s
Notice of Default of 11 November 2005, which demanded payment of the full amount of
the debt pursuant to Articles 2.4.1 and 2.4.3 of the December 2003 Loan Agreement, on

400. However, Mr Rebgun, Rosneft and the Federal Tax Service all objected to the First z

Bankruptcy Application:

(i) Mr Rebgun argued that the evidence submitted with the First Bankruptcy
Application failed to: (i) prove the transfer of all funds included in the Loans;
(ii) reflect whether the individuals who signed the Loans were authorised to do
so; (iii) include bank statements of the accounts where the Loans were received;
(iv) include a ‘suitable translation’ of the letter on early termination of the Loans;
(v) contain enclosures representing ‘an integral part of the agreement’; and 3

(vi) apply the relevant RUB-USD exchange rate,”°7

(ii) Rosneft opposed the First Bankruptcy Application on the basis that the Loans
were still not due at the time bankruptcy proceedings began, arguing that Yukos

Capital was not entitled to demand an early repayment of the Loans.”

(iii) The Federal Tax Service also contended that the Loans had not yet become due
and added that, to the extent that Yukos Capital was aware of the tax claims
against Yukos Oil when it granted the Loans (suggesting that the December 2003
Loan was in fact granted in January 2006), it could not rely on these
circumstances to request early repayment.”? The Federal Tax Service also
submitted that Yukos Oil had referred to the Loans as ‘Long-Term Loans’”"° and
that, ‘[i]n reality, [Yukos Oil] had reserved its own funds for the purpose of
settling the claims of the tax authorities.’”"!

401. On 19 July 2006, the Moscow Arbitrazh Court denied the First Bankruptcy Application,
taking the view that the Loans were not yet due and thus could not be included in the
Register of Creditors. The Court’s decision was aligned with the position of the Federal

Tax Service, and adopted a major part of its written submission verbatim.”

Federal Tax Service wrote to the GPO concerning Yukos Capital’s attempts to be
recognised as a creditor of Yukos Oil. The Federal Tax Service reiterated the objections
raised against the First Bankruptcy Application, and added that Yukos Oil’s apparent
recognition of the early payment demand of the Loans was contrary to its accounting
records, and said:
[T]he Federal Tax Service of Russia requests prosecutorial response to these facts
indicating unlawful actions by officers of Yukos Oil Company OJSC with the intent
of embezzling funds from the Russian Federation budget and their commission of

fraud and document forgery regarding the existence of a debt totaling over RUB 100
billion.74

403. Criminal investigation and searches. On 8 August 2006, the Russian Deputy General
Prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings and began an investigation of the Claimant on
the basis of indications of fraud. The initiating order referred to the alleged unlawfulness
of the Yukos Tax Arrangement and stated that the materials provided by the Federal Tax
Service indicated that Yukos Capital ‘had been used to amass financial resources acquired
by illicit means’, concluding that the Loans were ‘fraudulent’ and ‘knowingly false’
agreements ‘with the aim of deceiving officials’ in charge of the bankruptcy

proceedings, 7!5

404. Pursuant to a search warrant issued that day, the investigative group of the GPO
conducted a search of the Moscow office of Nomos on 9 August 2006.7"6 The record of

the search describes the search of rooms in the Nomos offices, records the seizure of

7 Letter from the Deputy Director of the Federal Tax Service to the Office of the Prosecutor General of the
Russian Federation, with enclosures (31 July 2006), 3 e¢ seg. (R-642). The Claimant asserts that it had never seen
this communication, which was disclosed by the Respondent on 14 March 2019 as part of its document production
obligations. See Memorial, [271]; Rejoinder, [217].

dated 17 August 2006, Nomos informed the Claimant that the search included seizure of
all documents received from Yukos Capital, and seizure of the power of attorney granted
by the Claimant (dated 24 April 2006) for the purposes of, inter alia, the First Appeal.”!®
Yukos Capital complained contemporaneously that the homes of its lawyers were
searched,”!® and Mr Mkhitaryan testifies to a recollection that Mr Das Gupta had told him

that his father’s home had been searched, mistaken for his own.”°

405. The record of the search of the Nomos offices noted that its representatives had stated
three complaints: that an inventory of documents contained in the seized folders was
absent; that there was no mention of the paperback folder seized in one office; and that
documents concerning Transneft were seized despite not being mentioned in the search
warrant.”"! The search record also refers to the seizure of a number of hard disk drives
and floppy disks from Nomos servers and computers. ?? The Tribunal accepts

on the search record, the removal of hard disk drives is likely to have had a significant

effect on the data files of Nomos in general.”

On 15 August 2006, the Managing Partner of Nomos, Ms Titievskaya, was interviewed
for approximately three hours. The transcript records her refusing to testify about any
facts known to her in connection with the rendering of legal services. When questioned
about the legal services agreement with Yukos Capital dated 24 April 2006,
Ms Titievskaya explained that Nomos corresponded by email with Yukos Capital through
the three directors of TMF Corporate Services SA (TMF), that she did not discuss the
firm’s engagement agreement with Mr Das Gupta, and that the only time she contacted
him was for assistance getting in touch with Mr Theede (from whom she obtained a letter
confirming Yukos Oil’s receipt of Yukos Capital’s early repayment demand).”4 Nomos
mentioned this interview in its letter of 17 August 2006 to the Claimant.’

Mr Mkhitaryan’s evidence under cross-examination was that he understood (through
Mr Das Gupta) that Ms Titievskaya was ‘scared’ of the repercussions of being involved
in the Yukos case, so expressed a preference not to communicate directly with Yukos

managers and instead to be hired by Mr Das Gupta.’°

In the letter of 17 August 2006, Nomos explained that in the upcoming appeal hearings,
it would have to inform the court that, as a consequence of the search, all relevant
documents received from Yukos Capital had been seized, as well as the power of attorney,
and that ‘in this connection the Lawyers have no possibility to represent the above

mentioned documents in the court hearings.’”’ Mr Mkhitaryan also deposed that the

Ms Titievskaya on the ability of Nomos to carry on business was derived primarily from
his conversations with Mr Das Gupta.” Nevertheless, reviewing both his evidence and
the documentary record, the Tribunal is satisfied, and so finds, that it was these events
that led to her decision to withdraw from legal representation of the Claimant in the
bankruptcy. 72°

The First Appeal. At the hearing for the First Appeal, held on 28 September 2006, counsel
for Yukos Capital requested an adjournment based on the Nomos search, but the request
was denied and the court proceeded to consider a motion filed by the Federal Tax Service
to stay the proceedings due to the pendency of the criminal case against Yukos Capital.
Rosneft supported this motion, and Yukos Capital’s representatives (having lost their

application to have the proceeding adjourned) did not object. 73!

- Ina ruling issued on the same day of the hearing, the Ninth Arbitrazh Court of Appeal
granted the motion of the Federal Tax Service and suspended the First Appeal on the basis
of the GPO’s order of 8 August 2006.7? The court found that, to the extent that the
determination whether the Loans were agreements with ‘knowingly false information’

was ‘of direct significance for establishing the validity of the claims made by Yukos

Capital’, the proceedings should be suspended until a decision was rendered in the

criminal case.”

412. On27 November 2006, Yukos Capital submitted the First Cassation Appeal against the
ruling of the Ninth Arbitrazh Court of Appeal, arguing, inter alia, that the criminal case
needed to be in the process of ‘being tried exactly by the court’ to warrant suspension of
another proceeding, and that the investigation of the GPO only constituted a ‘pre-trial

proceeding on the criminal case.’”**

413. The Second Bankruptcy Application. Yukos Oil was formally declared bankrupt on
1 August 2006 and liquidation proceedings commenced. As a result, all debts owed by

Yukos Oil became due and owing as a matter of Russian law. 7

414. The Claimant then filed the Second Bankruptcy Application for the inclusion of the Loans
in the Register of Creditors on 11 October 2006.” By then, the debt claimed by Yukos
Capital amounted to RUB 128,132,862,918.13.737

415. Both Mr Rebgun and the Federal Tax Service objected to the Second Bankruptcy
Application. Mr Rebgun requested that the Second Bankruptcy Application be denied,

arguing that it concerned the same issues that were still pending under the suspended First

Appeal.’°* The Federal Tax Service’s opposition to the Second Bankruptcy Application
relied primarily on the premise that the funds pertaining to the Loans were ‘essentially
the funds of Yukos Oil Company OJSC itself.’”® The Federal Tax Service submitted that
the Moscow Arbitrazh Court had already reached this conclusion when rejecting the First
Bankruptcy Application, and submitted that this was confirmed by the alleged evidence
that: (i) the role of the offshore companies within the Yukos Tax Arrangement was to
amass proceeds obtained through tax evasion; (ii) the demand for early repayment of the
Loans was only proved by a letter of Yukos Oil’s CEO but not properly reflected in the
company’s public records; and (iii) the Rehabilitation Plan foresaw that Yukos Oil would

eliminate all intragroup claims, which would therefore include the Loans.”

416. In advance of the hearing on the Second Bankruptcy Application, the Claimant notified
the Moscow Arbitrazh Court that it could neither ‘ensure participation of its
representatives’ nor access qualified legal assistance, owing to the pressure placed on its
lawyers at Nomos and the seizure of documents through the criminal investigation; it
explained that it had no choice but to ask for the Court to proceed in the absence of Yukos
Capital’s representatives.”"' Mr Mkhitaryan explained that it was not in Yukos Capital’s
interest to request a postponement of the hearing, because it needed to have its claims

registered before the liquidation was completed. ’*

The hearing on the Second Bankruptcy Application was held, as originally scheduled, on
27 November 2006. Yukos Capital’s representatives did not appear at the session, but the
court decided to proceed on the basis that Yukos Capital’s representatives ‘had been
notified of the time and place of the proceeding’ and had requested that the claim be heard

in their absence.”

Following the hearing, the Moscow Arbitrazh Court issued an oral decision rejecting the
Second Bankruptcy Application, which was provided in writing on 4 December 2006.4
The court dismissed Mr Rebgun’s objection, finding that the grounds on which the
Second Bankruptcy Application was based (particularly Yukos Oil’s bankruptcy
declaration) differed from those concerned in the First Appeal. Conversely, the Federal
Tax Service’s position was upheld in its entirety, with its written submission being

incorporated verbatim into the ruling.

The Second Appeal. On 18 December 2006, the Claimant filed the Second Appeal against
the decision denying the Second Bankruptcy Application. Yukos Capital submitted that
it had never had access to the objections of Mr Rebgun and the Federal Tax Service on
the Second Bankruptcy Application, that previously undisclosed evidence could not be
relied upon, and that the decision of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court had no basis. As for
the existence of a debt under the Loans, the Claimant submitted that the tax returns to
which the decision referred could not modify civil liabilities, while contending that the
bankruptcy declaration rendered the debate on the enforceability of its claims moot.”
With regard to the ownership and origin of the funds, Yukos Capital argued that it sufficed

to prove the existence of a loan agreement and the maturity of the obligations therein,

420. The hearing on the Second Appeal started on 17 January 2007, but it was postponed due
to the absence of Yukos Capital’s representatives.”“* In advance of that hearing, Yukos
Capital (by TMF) requested that the hearing be held in its absence because it was
‘effectively deprived of the opportunity to have procedural representatives in Russia.’ In

explaining the reasons for that application, Yukos Capital noted that it had been

represented by Nomos but said:

6.

From the moment the Application for inclusion of the Company's claims in
the register of Yukos Oil Company OJSC creditors was filed, however, these
attorneys were subjected to pressure by means of searches conducted by
investigators from the Prosecutor General’s Office of the Russian Federation
at the offices of NOMOS Law Firm and the attorneys’ home addresses, as well
as attempts to interview them on aspects of the provision of legal assistance
to the Company.

In the course of the investigative actions, documents were seized from the
NOMOS Law Firm attorneys that relate to the rendering of legal assistance to
the Company, as a result of which the attorneys were and still remain unable
to properly represent the Company’s interests in the court of first instance and
in the court of appeal, while the Company, lacking the relevant procedural
documents, cannot hire other representatives.

Thus, the Company has effectively been deprived of the opportunity to receive
qualified legal assistance and have procedural representatives in the instant
case.

At the same time, the Company understands that no matter which Russian
attorneys it hires to represent it in this case, those attorneys will immediately

be subjected to similar actions by the law-enforcement agencies, aimed at
getting them to withdraw from representing the Company in court.

42). Mr Mkhitaryan rejects the Respondent’s suggestion that Yukos Capital had other options
available, testifying in his written evidence in particular that the necessary documentation
required by any new lawyers to appear (including powers of attorney executed by Yukos
Capital’s then-directors, Mr Godfrey and Mr Misamore) had been seized in the Nomos
raids and could not be replaced in time.”°° Yukos Capital was left formally unrepresented

between early January 2007 and May 2007.

422. The hearing was resumed on 15 February 2007. Mr Rebgun, Rosneft and the Federal Tax
Service all opposed the Second Appeal, referring to the decision on the Second
Bankruptcy Application and its conclusion that the funds at stake belonged to Yukos oil
at all times, and adding that the Claimant had failed to prove that the Loans had been

effectively transferred. ’!

423. On 22 February 2007, the Ninth Arbitrazh Court of Appeal denied the Second Appeal.”

The court rejected the Claimant’s arguments and reiterated that: (i) the existence of an
obligation of early repayment of the Loans was not proved; and (ii) Yukos Oil was the
actual owner of the funds involved in the Loans, which were the result of formal
agreements based on ‘the common interests of the debtor’s former management and the

appellant’s current management.’7?

425. On 17 May 2007, Mr Rebgun initiated separate proceedings requesting that the Loans be
declared invalid. The petition alleged that, to the extent that Yukos Oil was the ultimate
owner of the funds involved and also had control over the Claimant, the Loans constituted
a transaction ‘with an interested party’ the performance of which would signify real harm
to Yukos Oil and losses for its creditors.’** One week later, Mr Rebgun filed a motion for
the suspension of the proceedings on the First Cassation Appeal and the Second Cassation
Appeal, arguing that ‘the possible invalidation of the loan agreements could deprive
Yukos Capital S.a r.l. of grounds for filing claims pursuant to the Federal Law on

Insolvency.’?5”

426. Suspension of the Cassation Appeals. On 31 May 2007 the Second Cassation Appeal was
suspended pending a decision on the petition to declare the Loans invalid.”* Yukos
Capital was by then represented by Mr Morozov of Gridnev and Partners.°° The Court
rejected Yukos Capital’s request for a recess to file written submissions on the petition to

suspend the appeal, on the basis that it had made its position clear in the oral hearing and

procedural law did not require written statements ‘regarding every issue that arises during

a court session.’76°

427. On 20 July 2007, the Moscow District Federal Arbitrazh Court found that the First
Cassation Appeal had been submitted in violation of procedural requirements, because it
was not accompanied by documents proving the authority of the persons who signed the
appeal, granting the Claimant until 20 September 2007 to submit those documents and
confirm service failing which the Court would ‘recommit the cassation appeal.’”' On 28
September 2007, the Ninth Arbitrazh Court of Appeal stayed the proceedings pending
resolution of the criminal proceedings against Yukos Capital,” a decision which was
upheld by the Federal Arbitrazh Court on 24 October 2007.78

428. The liquidation of Yukos Oil was finalised in November 2007, leading to the dissolution
of the company. On this basis, the pending proceedings regarding the Claimant’s attempt
to be included in the Register of Creditors were terminated.” The case initiated by Mr

Rebgun on the validity of the Loans was also terminated. ®

429. The Claimant cites a number of other applications by which the Claimant attempted to
appeal the rejection of its bankruptcy applications that were terminated on the ground that

Yukos Oil had ceased to exist.”

430. Applications of other Yukos subsidiaries. As the bankruptcy proceedings evolved, several
subsidiaries of the Yukos Group aside from the Claimant also sought to have their claims
included in the Register of Creditors. In total, the claims of 23 subsidiaries were
recognised. Many of these entities (e.g. TN, SN) were eventually acquired by Rosneft and

its subsidiaries during the liquidation of Yukos Oil.77

431.

In contrast, a number of other Yukos subsidiaries had their applications rejected by
Russian courts, further to the objections raised by Mr Rebgun, Rosneft and YNG, and the
Federal Tax Service.” As in relation to Yukos Capital, the courts generally found that

the applicants had failed to prove the validity or existence of their claims.

3. Did the Respondent expropriate the Loans in breach of Article 13 ECT?

The Tribunal must first deal with two preliminary objections raised by the Respondent:

0) That the decision of the Dutch courts that the Loans continue to exist and can be
enforced means necessarily that they have not been expropriated because the

Claimant cannot establish the ‘virtual annihilation and effective

neutralisation’ 7 of its investment or their ‘irreversible and permanent

taking.’7”

(ii) That the actions of Mr Rebgun as Receiver of Yukos Oil in the bankruptcy are

not attributable to the Respondent, which is accordingly not liable for them.

433. Continued existence of Loans. The Respondent is correct that the Loans that are the legal
materialisation of the investment that is the subject of the present proceedings have been
ruled valid and enforceable at the suit of the Claimant in proceedings against O00

Promneftstroy (Promneftstroy). ’”! The judgment is subject to appeal.

434. The Tribunal does not accept that this finding excludes the Claimant’s claim for
expropriation. In the Tribunal’s view, the Respondent’s submission conflates the legal
form by which the investment was held with its economic materialisation. The question
for the Tribunal is whether any or all of the sums advanced under the Loans have been
irreversibly and permanently taken as a result of the Respondent’s actions. The fact that
the Loans as legal instruments remain in force and can be sued upon is not determinative

of that question.

435. This has been the constant jurisprudence of international tribunals considering

expropriation claims:
(i) The Iran—US Claims Tribunal has held that:

A deprivation or taking of property may occur under international law through
interference by a state in the use of that property or with the enjoyment of its benefits,
even where legal title to the property is not affected.’

(ii) The same point has been made by arbitral tribunals. In Occidental, the tribunal

observed:

The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant in that expropriation need not involve the
transfer of title to a given property, which was the distinctive feature of traditional

expropriation under international law. It may of course affect the economic value of
an investment.’

The Tribunal will consider in Part VIII.D below the extent to which credit must be given

for sums recovered by the Claimant under the Dutch judgment.

Attribution of acts of Mr Rebgun. On the second preliminary issue, however, the Tribunal
accepts the correctness of the Respondent’s position that the actions of a Temporary
Receiver are not attributable to the State.” The Tribunal agrees with the findings of the
Grand Chamber of the ECtHR in Kotov v Russia that, under Russian law, a liquidator is
substantially autonomous from the State authorities. He cannot be treated as an agent of
the State, whose acts engage the responsibility of the State at international law.”” The

position is in substance the same in relation to a temporary receiver.””°

For its part, the Claimant (while insisting that Mr Rebgun was not in fact acting
independently””’) nevertheless makes clear that it does not rely on the acts of Mr Rebgun
as attributable to the Respondent. It states:

Claimant’s case does not turn on Mr. Rebgun’s acts and omissions being attributed
to Respondent.

Instead, Claimant maintains that the Russian administrative, prosecutorial and
judicial organs acted in cohort in expropriating Claimant’s Investment and the

Page 159 of 303

Russian State adopted Mr. Rebgun’s egregious acts as its own when its courts failed

to exercise their proper supervisory role in the bankruptcy.”
As a result, the Tribunal will approach its analysis of the treatment of the Claimant’s
Loans in the bankruptcy of Yukos Oil by focussing on the conduct of the Russian State
itself: the process of the Russian courts and the contemporaneous actions of the

prosecutorial authorities.

(a) Treatment of the Loans in the Yukos Oil bankruptcy

Having considered the totality of the evidence (summarised in Part VI.B.2 above), the
Tribunal has reached the conclusion that the disallowance of the proof of debt of Yukos
Capital in the bankruptcy of Yukos Oil constituted expropriation of that debt by the
Respondent because the taking was without ‘due process of law’ and was discriminatory,
amounting to a denial of justice. As already observed, Article 13 ECT requires all four
conditions for a State taking not to constitute expropriation. ’” Accordingly, the
Respondent’s failure to meet the requirements of due process of law and non-
discrimination amounting to a denial of justice constitutes a breach of its obligations
under Article 13.

. As to absence of due process of law, the Tribunal relies in particular on the following

facts and matters.

First Bankruptcy Application. The Claimant’s proof of debt, including the notice of
default, was regularly submitted.”®° It was rejected by the Moscow Arbitrazh Court not
on the ground that the debt was invalid, but on a ground that had no basis in law or fact,

namely that the debt had not been and could not be accelerated.’*! The Court adopted

verbatim the objections of the Federal Tax Service. 7°? The Tribunal finds no indication
of an independent judicial consideration. The Moscow Arbitrazh Court ignored the

evidence of acceleration that had been submitted.”®

443. Initiation of criminal proceedings. Immediately following the filing by Yukos Capital of
an appeal to the Ninth Arbitrazh Court of Appeal,’** the Federal Tax Service sent its letter
to the GPO requesting initiation of criminal proceedings.”® This letter was based upon
the demonstrably incorrect ground that the Loans had been advanced in 2006 after Yukos
Oil had already been the subject of revised tax assessments. On the basis of this request
alone, and without independent examination, on 8 August 2006, the GPO ordered the

initiation of criminal proceedings eight days later.”

444. Search and seizure of the files of Claimant’s lawyers. Based on the GPO’s Order, the
Court approved searches and seizures of files in the offices of Yukos Capital’s lawyers,
Nomos, and Ms Titievskaya was interrogated. 7°’ Following this interrogation, Ms
Titievskaya no longer signed applications advancing Yukos Capital’s claim, leaving the

Claimant without effective legal representation.

445. The Tribunal finds that these criminal proceedings were instituted in order to intimidate
the Claimant and its legal representatives from pursuit of the Claimant’s claim in the

bankruptcy. It notes in particular that:

The criminal proceedings were instituted shortly after the Claimant had filed an
appeal from the decision of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court denying its First

Bankruptcy Application;

The search was directed at the Claimant’s legal representatives in the

bankruptcy;

The GPO seized many files and computer hard drives from the Nomos offices,
apparently without any regard for the need to protect the confidentiality of the
lawyer-client relationship. Professor Esakov’s expert evidence was that this
would have to be assessed on a document-by-document basis, ”** but there is no

evidence or suggestion that this was done;

No criminal charges have been brought against the Claimant or its directors,
officers or agents as a result of this investigation since the institution of the

criminal proceedings; ’®?

Yet the pendency of the criminal proceedings served as a basis upon which the
Federal Tax Service could apply to suspend the Claimant’s pursuit of relief in
the bankruptcy, while the bankruptcy proceedings were still ongoing;
applications that the Russian courts granted.

446, Suspension of appeal. On the basis of the pending criminal proceedings, the Court

suspended the Claimant’s appeal from the decision denying its First Bankruptcy

Application on 28 September 2006.7”

447. Second Bankruptcy Application. Following the Court’s declaration of the bankruptcy of

Yukos Oil on 4 August 2006, all debts became due and owing by operation of law.

Accordingly, the Claimant filed a Second Bankruptcy Application on 6 October 2006.”*!
The Claimant was not provided with the objections to its Application filed by the Federal
Tax Service and the Receiver. Following the harassment of its lawyers in the criminal
investigation, it had no effective legal representation.” It was left with no option but to
seek the consideration of the Court in the absence of its representatives. The Court
rejected the Second Bankruptcy Application after a cursory hearing and in the absence of
any evidence to support the assertion that the funds were those of Yukos Oil, relying
instead on its judgment in the First Bankruptcy Application (which was the subject of a
stayed appeal) and without evidence of an independent examination of the Federal Tax

Service’s objections.”

448. Second Appeal. The Claimant appealed the rejection of the Second Bankruptcy
Application, but, as a result of the actions taken by the GPO, it was unable to obtain any
legal representation.’* The Court of Appeal rendered its judgment on a basis that neither

party had argued, namely that the debt did not exist because the Loans were invalid.”

449. Petitions to invalidate the Loans. Only after the Claimant petitioned the Court of
Cassation on 10 April 2007,” did the Receiver petition to invalidate the Loans as de

facto funds of Yukos Oil in reliance on the Court of Appeal’s judgment.’”

450. Suspension of cassation hearing. On 31 May 2007, the Federal Arbitrazh Court granted
the motion of the Receiver to suspend the Second Cassation Appeal on the basis that the
Loans were subject to invalidation proceedings, refusing the request of Yukos Capital for

an adjournment so as to be able to present written argument.%°

451.

Liquidation of Yukos Oil. In November 2007, Yukos Oil was placed into liquidation. On
that basis, the Claimant’s application to be entered in the Register of Creditors was
terminated without a substantive determination of the validity of the Loans or its rights

thereunder.7%°

452. In the Tribunal’s view, the process outlined above is the very opposite of a due process
of law. This is not simply a case of a debt being wrongly excluded in a bankruptcy or the
liquidation of company while an application to admit a debt was still outstanding.
Considering the totality of the process summarised above, the Claimant was never
afforded a proper opportunity to have its claim considered and admitted. On the contrary,
it was subjected to a series of actions, both by the courts and the prosecutorial authorities,
which precisely foreclosed that opportunity. In short, it was subject to a denial of. justice,

as a result of which its rights relating to the Loans were taken.

Discrimination. Further, the actions of the Respondent in excluding Yukos Capital from
the creditors of Yukos Oil were discriminatory. The claims of YNG, Yukos Oil’s

production subsidiary, were substantially accepted.®°

It will be recalled (Part III.E.2 above) that YNG had been Yukos Oil’s principal
Production Subsidiary, accounting for around 60% of the oil production of the Yukos
Group. It had been acquired at its nominal value by the then State-owned oil company
Rosneft on 22 December 2004.°°!

YNG submitted a bankruptcy petition against Yukos Oil, which was accepted for
consideration on 27 March 2006.* The bulk of YNG’s claims were admitted in the
bankruptcy, either as part of the Rehabilitation Plan or as payment for arrears from the
sale of oil between YNG and certain LTR Subsidiaries"? On 1 October 2006, YNG
formally merged into Rosneft, as a result of which all of YNG’s claims in the bankruptcy

were attributed to Rosneft.5

The Respondent maintains that there was no discrimination in fact, as not all of YNG’s
claims were admitted in the bankruptcy, and a number of claims by Yukos-owned entities

were so admitted. °5

Yukos Capital v Russia

Final Award

Page 165 of 303

The Tribunal finds that the portions of YNG’s claim that were not admitted were de

minimis, amounting to just 1.37% of the total amount claimed.°°°

The largest portion (99%) of the claims of other Yukos Oil subsidiaries that were admitted
in the bankruptcy was the claim of TN, another Production Subsidiary,®” which was itself

subsequently acquired by Rosneft.°

Having reviewed the record of court decisions, and considered the expert evidence
submitted by Dr Gladyshev for the Claimant and Professor Zaitsev for the Respondent,
the Tribunal can find no valid reason for the exclusion of the Claimant’s claims in the
bankruptcy, when the claims of other Yukos subsidiaries that had been or were

subsequently acquired by Rosneft were admitted.

Professor Zaitsev accepted that, by virtue of Article 126 of the Russian Bankruptcy Law,
all debts became due and owing from the date of Yukos Oil’s bankruptcy.®” It follows
that the first reason advanced by the Ninth Arbitrazh Court of Appeal in its decision of
22 February 2007, namely that the existence of an obligation of early repayment of the

Loans was not proven, *!° had no legal basis.

The second ground relied upon by the Court was that Yukos Oil was the actual owner of

the funds in question, based on ‘the common interests of the debtor’s former management

and the appellant’s current management.’ ®!!

The Tribunal accepts the evidence of Dr Gladyshev that this finding had no basis in
Russian law at the time, which excluded only the claims of shareholders arising from their
shareholding.*!? It had no application to loans, including shareholder loans, still less to
an inter-company loan from subsidiary to parent. The Tribunal considers that Professor
Zaitsev’s alternative ‘subordination theory’, which is not referred to in the judgments of
the Russian courts in the Yukos Oil bankruptcy, is an ‘ex-post facto rationale’ that is not

supported by the Russian law in force at the material time.*!>

Accordingly, the Tribunal is satisfied that there was no legitimate basis upon which the
Russian courts could distinguish between the claim of YNG and the claim of Yukos
Capital. It concludes that the Respondent discriminated against Yukos Capital. This
constitutes discrimination for the purpose of Article 13(1) ECT, and contributes, with the
denial of due process, to a denial of justice. On this basis, the Tribunal finds the
Respondent to be in breach of its obligations to the Claimant under Article 13 of the
Treaty.

(b) As part of an orchestrated campaign against the Yukos Group?

The Tribunal further finds that, for the reasons set out below, its conclusion that the
Claimant was subject to an expropriation of its property as a result of denial of justice is
corroborated by actions taken against other companies in the Yukos Group as part of an
orchestrated campaign.*!4 For the reasons explained in Part VI.A.1 above, it is neither
necessary nor appropriate for its purpose for the Tribunal to review the whole course of
events that led to the bankruptcy of Yukos Oil. This Tribunal is concerned only with the
claim of Yukos Capital as to the Respondent’s conduct affecting its rights in the Loans.
Nevertheless, it is entitled to consider the evidence adduced before it in relation to the

treatment of the Yukos Group as a whole to the extent that it may be relevant to the

allegation that the treatment accorded to Yukos Capital was part of an orchestrated

campaign on the part of the Respondent against the Group.

As summarised in Parts III and V above, the present Tribunal has heard substantial
submissions and evidence adduced on behalf of both Parties on this larger context. It
reaches its decision solely on the basis of the evidence presented before it. Having
considered that evidence, the Tribunal finds certain elements of the conduct affecting
Yukos Oil to be shared in common with the procedure affecting Yukos Capital, so that
the acts that are the subject of the present proceedings are part of such an orchestrated

campaign against the Yukos Group as a whole.
Two elements are particularly relevant for this purpose:

ji The imposition of VAT on Yukos Oil in relation to oil exports, which was the
single largest element in the Tax Assessments that led to its bankruptcy and

which received no substantive review by the Russian courts; and
(ii) The campaign of harassment of Yukos Oil’s lawyers.

Each of these elements corroborates the Tribunal’s finding that the denial of, justice to
which the Claimant was subjected was part of an orchestrated campaign against the Yukos

Group as a whole.

VAT. The Claimant submits that 56% of the tax assessment claims against Yukos Oil
related to the non-payment of VAT, amounting to USD 13.59 billion (including fines and
interest relating to VAT).*!5 It alleges that the imposition of VAT on Yukos Oil had no
basis in Russian law and that, but for the VAT element in the tax reassessments, Yukos

Oil would have been able to meet its tax liabilities and thereby avoid bankruptcy.*'¢

469. The Tribunal heard evidence from Judge Batsiev, an expert called on behalf of the

Respondent, on this point.*!” In summary, Judge Batsiev confirmed that:

(i) VAT in Russia is a federal tax and that therefore the region in which the taxpayer
resides is irrelevant;$!8

(i) ‘The VAT Law provided that export operations (regardless of whether the
exported goods were produced by the exporter or were purchased by him for re-
sale) were exempt from tax; and Chapter 21 of the Tax Code envisages taxation
at the rate of 0%’;5!9

(iii) The LTR Subsidiaries submitted the documents required under the VAT Law to
support their claim to a 0% rate on the basis that the oil in question was
exported;®?°

(iv) The Tax Ministry reassessed the tax as payable by Yukos Oil on the ground that
the revenues were in fact the revenues of Yukos Oil and consequently the
documents had to be provided to the tax authorities at the place of Yukos Oil’s
location; #2!

(vy) Judge Batsiev confirmed that, in view of the fact that the requisite documents
had already been submitted by the subsidiaries, this was a ‘formal position’ ;*”

He was unable to provide information as to why this was not sufficient.°%
470. The Tribunal specifically asked counsel in closing to address inter alia the question:

[D]oes Respondent maintain that the VAT element of the Yukos Oil 2000-2004 Tax
Reassessments was lawfully imposed? If so, on what evidence does Respondent rely
for this purpose?*”>
471. The Respondent’s submission, in response to this question, was to rely to the evidence of
Judge Batsiev to the effect that ‘the Tax Authorities have always had a position of very
strict compliance with formal requirements, including presenting a full list of documents
and absence of defects in those documents and presenting those documents by the proper

entity.’ 26

472. The Tribunal can find no evidence on the record that might be capable of supporting the
proposition that, even if the Russian tax authorities had determined that Yukos Oil and
not the LTR Subsidiaries was the proper taxpayer, VAT on the oil exports of the Yukos
Group was properly chargeable, nor that there was any failure to support the claim with
the proper documentation. On any view, it is uncontested that the LTR Subsidiaries did
submit the requisite documents. Moreover, the hearing transcript shows that Yukos Oil

resubmitted the same documents.

473. Yet the Moscow Arbitrazh Court and the Ninth Arbitrazh Court of Appeals held this
evidence inadmissible, since it showed receipt of the revenue by the LTR Subsidiaries
and not Yukos Oil.®?7 The result was to base a USD 13.59 billion VAT liability on what

was at most a failure to comply with a question of form in the submission of documents,

in circumstances in which Yukos Oil was entitled to and did resubmit the documents. As

bl dent?

a matter of sub it is i id was not d by the Resp S

expert—that no VAT is properly chargeable on oil exports.

In the light of these circumstances, the Tribunal concludes that the Russian courts’
summary acceptance of the position of the tax authorities and their refusal to reconsider
the imposition of VAT in the face of the uncontroverted evidence submitted by Yukos
Oil constitutes a denial of justice,®"* which, in complicity with the tax authorities, was
aimed taking the property of Yukos Oil.

When this record is compared with the record of the treatment of the Claimant’s
subsequent claim to recover its Loans in the bankruptcy of Yukos Oil, the Tribunal
concludes that the treatment of Yukos Capital was part of a wider campaign on the part
of the Respondent, in which the judiciary participated, with the common objective to
deprive companies in the Yukos Group of their property.

Harassment. A second example of the orchestrated nature of the campaign against the
Yukos Group, including the Claimant, relates to the treatment of its legal advisors. The
Tribunal has referred above to the enforcement actions taken against the Claimant’s
Russian lawyers and the effect on the Claimant's ability to defend its interests before the

Russian courts in the bankruptcy.

A similar pattern may be observed in relation to other legal advisors to the Yukos Group.

The Tribunal received evidence on this from two witnesses:

(i) A witness statement of Mr Yuri Schmidt. 9 Mr Schmidt had been
Mr Khodorkovsky’s criminal defence lawyer. He gave his statement in the
proceedings Hulley Enterprises Ltd v Russia (the Hulley Proceedings). It was
signed on 15 September 2010. The Respondent elected not to cross-examine

Mr Schmidt in the Hulley Proceedings, so its contents were unchallenged
there. °° Mr Schmidt passed away in 2013. The Claimant in the present
proceedings produced this statement with its Memorial and referred to it also in
oral argument without objection from the Respondent. The Tribunal therefore

receives this statement as evidence, while taking due account of the fact that it

could not be tested in the proceedings before it.

(ii) Mr Mkhitaryan, who had been a member of the Yukos Moscow Legal
Department from 1997, and was its Head in 2005, becoming a member of the
Legal Department of Yukos Services UK Ltd from 2006, a position that he still

The victims of the harassment campaign by the Russian authorities were not only
Mr Khodorkovsky’s defense lawyers, but also defense lawyers for Yukos and
Yukos-related persons, as well as Yukos’ in-house counsel and outside lawyers. As
one of the two senior members of Mr. Khodorkovsky’s team, I can refer to a non-
exhaustive list of facts of harassment and intimidation of lawyers by the Russian
authorities through personal attacks, threats, attempts to disbar, illegal raids and

seizures in their offices.

480. He then set out a number of examples of each of these types of harassment.*? Of
particular relevance to the present case are the examples that he gave of raids and seizures
in lawyers’ offices.*3* He concluded:
It is important to note that the timing of the attacks... was always meticulously
calculated to correspond to the critical stages in the dismantlement of Yukos. ... By
depriving lawyers of their files and intimidating them, Russian authorities ensured
that Yukos and its former management would not be in a position to properly defend
themselves, and that Yukos’ jewel asset could be confiscated without difficulty.*°
481. Mr Mkhitaryan deposed not only to his knowledge of the actions taken against
Ms Titievskaya but also to his own interrogation; to the arrest of Vasily Alesanyan (Head
of the Legal Department at Yukos Oil until 2006); and to the circumstances that led to
Mr Mkhitaryan’s departure from Moscow, stating that he was ‘[flearful of my personal

freedom.’®6

482. At the Hearing, he was questioned extensively about his knowledge of the circumstances
in which the offices of Nomos were raided and Ms Titiyevskaya resigned from
representing the Claimant. In the course of giving this evidence, he reiterated that
‘lawyers of Yukos were frightened and interrogated’*?” and that ‘the main reason’ for

such intimidation was ‘to obtain all the assets.’#*

483. In the course of the closing submissions, a member of the Tribunal specifically asked
counsel for the Respondent to address any submissions that he wished to advance both
about the treatment accorded to the internal and external lawyers to the Claimant and the

lawyers for Yukos Oil.®° Counsel submitted that ‘there is no evidence to show--to

support the allegation of harassment and intimidation with respect to Yukos Capital’s
bankruptcy lawyers.’*“° He added: ‘there is not enough support to seriously suggest that
any pressure was being put on internal lawyers to the extent that that could affect the
ability of Yukos Oil to defend itself in the courts and to vindicate its rights as that could

become necessary.’ ®!

In light of the evidence summarised above, the Tribunal rejects that submission. It
considers that there is clear and uncontroverted evidence that the lawyers—internal and
external—for the Yukos Group were subjected to a campaign of harassment. The object
of that campaign was to undermine the ability of companies within the Group to defend
themselves in the proceedings against the confiscation of their assets. In this regard, the
Tribunal finds that the actions taken against the lawyers for the Claimant form part of a
concerted campaign with actions taken against the lawyers for other companies within

the Yukos Group.

The Tribunal relies on this additional evidence of a concerted campaign as corroborating
its finding that the Respondent expropriated the Claimant's investment of funds under the

Loans through its refusal to recognise the Claimant’s claim in the bankruptcy.

ILLEGALITY

Having reached the conclusion in Part VI.B that the Claimant’s investment of funds under
the Loans was expropriated by the Respondent, the Tribunal must now consider whether
the Claimant’s claim is precluded on the ground that the sums for which it is seeks

recovery were the fruits of illegal or fraudulent conduct.

1. Legal character of allegations of illegality

As detailed in Part V.B above, the Respondent pleads its case on illegality in a number of
different ways, relying on legal doctrines that it alleged to be relevant under both national

law and international law. In their written pleadings, the Parties developed extensive

Page 174 of 303

argument on the elements of illegality under each of the theories advanced by the

Respondent and adduced pertinent expert evidence, which was tested under cross-

examination at the Hearing.

488. Nevertheless, during the course of the Hearing, and in particular in closing argument,

partly in response to specific written questions posed by the Tribunal and partly as a result

of concessions made by the Parties, it has become clear that the scope of the issues in

dispute between the Parties which the Tribunal is required to determine, has been

significantly narrowed.

489. The Respondent's final case. In closing, the Respondent put its case on illegality in two

ways:

w

ii)

Interest payments on the Loans. Its primary case is that, under the proper
construction of the Luxembourg DTA, the Claimant was obliged to pay tax in
Russia on the interest payments under the Loans. Its failure to do so constitutes

criminal tax evasion, which renders the Claimant’s claims unenforceable. ®?

The ‘Laundromat’. Its alternative case * is that the Loans constitute the
proceeds of criminal tax evasion either through the use of on-shore tax structures
or through the payment of dividends under the Cyprus DTA and are
unenforceable as such.*“4 As Respondent’s counsel put it in closing:

Really the fundamental part of what we call the “Laundromat case,” is that the
money that was being advanced under the Loans was the proceeds of a crime.

2 T10/2164/12-23 (Respondent).

3 The Respondent’s counsel stated at T10/2186/16-19 that ‘this is our alternative case on illegality. So to be

completely clear, the Laundromat is not a necessary part of our case on illegality.”

Page 175 of 303

On the basis that... all of the money originated in the LTRs, and so was the
product of on-shore tax evasion, and was funneled through Cyprus so was the
product of the DTA abuse in Cyprus."

490. Regulatory default. Even if the Claimant’s failure was not criminal, but only a regulatory
default, the Respondent maintains that the Tribunal must still dismiss the claim either
under the international law doctrines of public policy or unclean hands, or because the
domestic law governing the Loans (whether Russian or New York law) holds that a
contract made for the purpose of tax evasion, or where its subject matter is the fruits of a

crime, is void.*°

491. The Claimant's concession. The Claimant for its part concedes that if the Tribunal were
satisfied that it was ‘engaged in a vast operation of criminal tax evasion and criminal
money-laundering’ then it could not succeed in its claim.**” In response to the Tribunal’s
questions in closing, the Claimant’s counsel made clear that this concession applies
whether or not the Tribunal’s finding of criminal conduct is based on the onshore tax
arrangements; tax on dividends under the Cyprus DTA or tax on interest under the
Luxembourg DTA. In any of these three events, the Claimant accepts that it cannot
succeed if the Tribunal were to make a finding of criminal conduct such that ‘some

portion of the investment could be described as the proceeds of crime.’**

492. Criminal tax evasion. As a result, the Parties are agreed that, for purposes of both the
Respondent’s primary and its secondary case, the principal question for the Tribunal to
consider is whether the conduct in question constituted a crime of tax evasion. That

question must necessarily be assessed under Russian law, being the law that the

should have paid more interest, and it knew it should have done that in such a way that it’s criminal, ] suspect I
could-I could craft an argument that would say that’s not a public international law illegality defense, but J'm not
making that argument.’ (emphasis added).

Respondent alleges the Claimant criminally evaded. This requires the Tribunal to

determine the constituent elements of that crime and then to evaluate the evidence.

493. In light of the Claimant’s concession, it will not be necessary for the Tribunal to determine
whether, as the Respondent alleges, the conduct could also constitute criminal money
laundering.**? The Respondent accepts that tax evasion was not a predicate offence for

money laundering at the material time under Russian law.*°

494, In any event, the Tribunal does not consider that the Respondent’s characterisation of the
Loans as part of a money laundering scheme or ‘Laundromat’ adds materially to the
underlying question of whether the Loans were funded by the fruits of criminal tax
evasion. The Tribunal Chairman raised the following question about the Respondent’s
case in this respect in the course of its closing submissions:

[I]f the object, then, of the Laundromat in, on your case, was to extract more money
than should have been extracting because it was extracted without payment of the
proper taxes for the benefit of the shareholders, why the second part of the
transaction? Why couldn’t, on your case, the shareholders have simply taken the
money at the point that it reached Cyprus? What on Earth was the point of running
the risk of repatriating it to Russia and re-extracting it at that point...?%'

495. After referring to various aspects of the structure of the series of transactions, the
Respondent concluded:

Really, the fundamental part of what we call the “Laundromat case,” is that the
money that was being advanced under the Loans was the proceeds of crime. So the
Laundromat almost sort of stops there for the purposes of our defense. We then go

on to explain what happened to the money, but as I say that’s really just to close the
circle and provide you with the context and the explanation.

CHAIRMAN McLACHLAN: And the basis upon which you say—do you say that
all of the money was the proceeds of crime?

MS. ROWE: On the basis that I don’t believe it’s disputed that all of the money
originated in the LTRs, and so was the product of on-shore tax evasion, and was
funneled through Cyprus so was the product of the DTA abuse in Cyprus.®*
The Respondent accepts that the dividend payments that in turn funded the Loans were
the proceeds of real oil sales, but submits that the entire pool is tainted by the illegal

conduct, namely the alleged criminal evasion of Russian tax. 853

Regulatory breach for non-payment of tax. Before analysing the evidence as to criminal
conduct, it is necessary in order to delineate the scope of the Tribunal’s analysis, to
determine whether, absent criminal intent, a regulatory breach of tax law would suffice,

whether as a matter of domestic or international law.

The Claimant’s concession does not go so far as to extend to the alternative basis on
which the Respondent puts its case under each of the two alleged bases of illegality
outlined above in the event that the Tribunal were to find that criminality is not made out,
but that there was nevertheless a regulatory failure to pay tax that was lawfully due under

Russian law.

In that event, the Respondent nevertheless maintains that the claim should be dismissed.
For its principal case under the Luxembourg DTA, it submits that the Loans are void
under their governing law (whether that may be Russian or New York law).** In both the
principal and the secondary case, it also invokes international public policy and the clean

hands doctrine under international law.

For its part, the Claimant disputes that a failure to pay tax that is a regulatory breach but
does not constitute a criminal offence can give rise to a public international law illegality

defence that would deprive it of investment protection.** Insofar as the Respondent also

maintains that ‘this argument quite obviously (and by its terms) fails with the “Yukos

In considering the scope of the issues raised for the Tribunal’s decision on the
Respondents case on regulatory breach for non-payment of tax, it is necessary to consider

@ The claim that the Loans are void under their applicable domestic law; and

(ii) The claim that a regulatory breach in failure to pay tax engages the public

Loans void under their applicable law. In considering this question, it is necessary to start
by recalling five axiomatic principles of international investment law that frame the
enquiry:

(i) ‘International law does not create property rights. Rather, it accords certain

protections to property rights created according to municipal law.’857

(ii) From this first proposition, it follows that ‘for there to have been an
expropriation of an investment... the rights affected must exist under the law

which creates them.’88

(iii) Since ‘expropriation concerns interference in rights in property, it is important

to be meticulous in identifying the rights duly held by the Claimant... [since

Nevertheless, these findings in no way preclude the Respondent from raising in the
present phase an allegation of the illegality of the Loans under their applicable law,
whether as an objection to jurisdiction or as a defence on the merits. The Respondent
specifically notified its intention to raise a plea of illegality as early as 11 April 2014.8
The Tribunal determined in PO N° 1 that this objection could not be determined in the

preliminary phase, but should be joined to the merits.°

 

The nature of the Respondent's allegations. In these ci itt important
to analyse the substantive nature of the grounds for illegality raised by the Respondent
that it alleges render the Loans void, whether under Russian or New York law. When this
is done, it becomes apparent that the Respondent does not merely allege that the sums
that were advanced under the Loans constituted an investment that was contrary to
Russian law. That is to say, it does not allege that it was itself illegal for an intra-group
finance company in the position of Yukos Capital to advance funds by way of a loan to
its ultimate parent. Rather, the Respondent maintains that the unlawful character arose
from the failure to pay due tax in relation to the Loans themselves or antecedent
transactions from which the funds advanced under the Loans were derived. It alleges that
the Loans were advanced as part of a scheme to facilitate the transfer of the illegal
proceeds of criminal tax evasion and money laundering. This is the case that is advanced
whether the matter is put under Russian law, or under New York law or as a matter of

international law.
Russian law, The Respondent alleges that:

[T]he Loans were void ab initio and without legal effect under Russian law, because
(i) the Loans facilitated the transfer of illegal proceeds and therefore contradicted the
legal prohibition on abuse of right and bad faith transactions; and (ii) the Loans were
a mere fagade executed to disguise and facilitate illegal tax evasion and money
laundering, and therefore constituted void “sham” and “mock” transactions.*”

507. It relies in support on the evidence of Professor Bevzenko, its expert on Russian civil law.
Professor Beyzenko makes clear from the outset in his First Report that he was instructed

to assume that:

1) _ the “loans” were part of a large-scale multi-jurisdictional money laundering
scheme;

2)  Yukos Capital, a shell company, was part of the money laundering scheme
that existed to disguise the origin of the monies obtained as a result of illegal
activities, including aggressive tax evasion;

3) the funds Yukos Oil received under the Loan Agreements represented the
proceeds of illegal activities, including: tax evasion through the abuse of
preferential taxation schemes, and the abuse of international conventions for
the avoidance of double taxation; and

4) the funds that Yukos Capital extended to Yukos Oil under the Loan
Agreements were in economic terms, Yukos Oil’s own funds that it continued
to own,

508. Professor Bevzenko confirmed at the Hearing that these assumptions formed the basis for
the conclusion in his Report that the Loans would be treated as void as a matter of Russian
law.®® Specifically in relation to the Luxembourg DTA he stated that ‘tax evasion under
that breach of Double Taxation Treaty forms the bad-faith behaviour, and that bad faith
behaviour, the breach of the principle of good faith and fair dealing, is the ground for
invalidation of the contract under Russian law.’8”

New York law, The Respondent also advances a case that the Loans would be void under
New York law, in the event that the Tribunal were to take into account the Addenda to
the Loans of 27 October 2005, whereby the applicable law was said to be amended and
testated as ‘the substantive law of the State of New York, USA.’*7! Citing various New

York judicial decisions,®” the Respondent alleges that a contract made for the purpose of
defrauding tax authorities®”? or to ‘evade tax liability’ are unenforceable and so too are
contracts the subject matter of which represent ‘the fruit of a crime’’’ and contracts made

‘with intent to defraud.’*”

The Tribunal finds nothing exceptional in these general principles of civil law, whether
as embodied in the Russian Civil Code or under New York law. Their common feature is
that they all require a deliberate intent to commit a criminal act or fraud. Indeed this was
the explicit premise on which Professor Bevzenko was instructed to opine. The result is
that they do not on analysis add a materially different set of legal considerations to those
that the Tribunal will have to consider when analysing the Respondent’s principal ground
on which it bases its case. The national laws invoked do not support the proposition that,

absent criminal intent, a regulatory breach suffices to render the Loans void.

Mlegality under international law? Nor is the position different if the nature of the
Respondent’s allegations is considered under the public international law doctrines of

public policy or unclean hands.

These doctrines are a manifestation of the general principle of good faith. The Tribunal
accepts that this principle provides a basis under international law upon which investment
protection may be denied that is separate and distinct from the requirement that
investments be made in accordance with host State law. As the tribunal in Hamester put
it:
An investment will not be protected if it has been created in violation of national or
international principles of good faith; by way of corruption, fraud or deceitful

conduct; or if its creation itself constitutes a misuse of the system of international
investment protection under the ICSID Convention. It will also not be protected if it

is made in violation of the host State’s law (as elaborated, e.g. by the tribunal in
Phoenix)”
$13, It also follows from the source of these doctrines in the general principle of good faith
under international law that something more than a breach of national law is required for
such principles to be engaged so as to deprive the investment of international law
protection. To this extent, the Tribunal accepts the Respondent’s proposition that
international public policy is an autonomous ground for dismissal and is not co-extensive

with, nor does it require the establishment ofa breach of, domestic law.578

514. Public policy. Tribunals have invoked international public policy to dismiss an
investment claim in two categories of case: (i) when there was corruption and bribery;

and (ii) when the investment was procured through fraud or forgery.
515. Corruption. The first category of cases include:

(i) World Duty Free, where the contract had been procured by paying a bribe to the

President of the Respondent State;*”

payment of bribes;*° and

516. Fraud, The second category of cases include:

(i) Inceysa v El Salvador, where the investor obtained a concession contract through

fraud in the public bidding process;5**

(ii) Churchill Mining v Indonesia, where the investments were procured by means
of forged documents, to the production and preparation of which the investor
had been wilfully blind;®? and

(iii) Plama v Bulgaria, where the investor obtained the investment by providing
materially misleading information about the shareholding which was required

for the Government’s approval of the investment.°

517. The common element that links all of these cases is that of an intention to procure the
investment through corrupt or fraudulent means (including wilful blindness to such

means). Unless this can be established, the doctrine does not assist the Respondent.

518. Unclean hands. Alternatively, the Respondent invokes the international law doctrine that
(in the language of Sir Gerald Fitzmaurice) a party ‘which is guilty of illegal conduct may
be deprived of the necessary locus standi in judicio for complaining of corresponding
illegalities on the part of other States, especially if these were consequential on or were

embarked upon in order to counter its own illegality—in short were provoked by it.?88

519. In invoking this doctrine, the Respondent accepts that its application would require the
Tribunal to assess the relationship between its conduct and that of the Claimant. Citing
the above formulation, it submits that ‘the role of Claimant and the Loans as

instrumentalities in the Yukos Oligarchs’ money-laundering and tax evasion schemes’

gives rise to ‘the quintessential case in which the alleged acts about which the Claimant

complains... were consequential on or were embarked upon in order to counter

{Claimant’s] own iNegality.’5%

In the case of this plea, as in the case of public policy, the Respondent relies upon its
allegations of the Claimant’s participation in criminal or fraudulent conduct: money-

laundering and tax evasion. Respondent’s counsel stressed this in closing, when stating:

It was a structure purposefully and intentionally set up to evade $350 million in
Russian taxes.

There can be no doubt that a policy, condemning tax evasion in its strongest possible

terms exists."*”
This type of conduct was also at the heart of the principal case on which the Respondent
relies as a contemporary application of the unclean hands doctrine (in addition to those
already cited in relation to public policy): Al-Warraq v Indonesia.*** In that case, the
treaty in question, the OIC,** contained an Article, which expressly provided that:

The investor shall be bound by the laws and regulations in force in the host state and

shall refrain from all acts that may disturb public order or morals or that may be

prejudicial to the public interest. He is also to refrain from exercising restrictive
practices and from trying to achieve gains through unlawful means,*”

This Article contemplates a much broader enquiry into the conduct of the investor, both
ratione materiae and ratione temporis, than would otherwise be required in international

investment law on the authorities analysed above. The tribunal’s analysis in Al-Warraq

was necessarily guided by the specific treaty language. It is that specific language that

explains the tribunal’s comment that criminality was not required.®' It sufficed under the
OIC that the investor’s actions failed to uphold the laws and regulations in force in the

host State and were prejudicial to the public interest.

523. Nevertheless, in holding that the clean hands doctrine applied (as distinct from the broader
provisions of the article) the tribunal emphasised that the actions of the investor amounted

to fraud, an immoral or illegal act.°

524. There is some doubt as to whether the clean hands doctrine exists as a separate doctrine
of general international law outside the express provisions of particular treaties.*°> The
authorities that have been cited all consider categories of serious wilful wrongdoing in
the context of the international public policy plea.** They all address cases where there
was something more than mere failure to comply with domestic law. In international law,
the clean hands doctrine is closely linked to the principle of good faith, which is
concerned with wilful wrongdoing, such as corruption, fraud or deceitful conduct or
conduct that constitutes a breach of international as opposed to domestic law. The
Respondent’s case is in any event put on the basis that the Claimant is indeed guilty of
such an intentional crime or fraud on the Respondent. The Tribunal considers that the
conduct in question would need to reach this threshold in order for the clean hands

doctrine to be engaged.

‘The Tribunal concludes from the above that the Claimant failed to uphold Indonesian laws and regulations. The
‘Tribunal further considers that the Claimant’s action, whether criminal or not, caused a liquidity issue to Bank
Century, and his actions have been prejudicial to the public interest, in this case the Indonesian financial sector.
The Claimant having breached the local laws and put the public interest at risk, he deprived himself of the
protection afforded by the OIC Agreement.’

Page 187 of 303

The result of the above analysis is that, in considering the Respondent’s plea of illegality,
the question for the Tribunal is whether it finds on the evidence before it that the C laimant
was guilty of intentional wrongdoing that constituted either a criminal misconduct or
fraud. Whether it is analysed as a matter of the law applicable to the Loans or under
general principles of international law, the issue for the Tribunal’s decision comes to the
same: were the sums extended under the Loans the proceeds of criminal evasion of

Russian tax?

In light of that decision, the Tribunal does not find it necessary finally to decide whether
any or all of the Respondent’s objections based on illegality are properly to be treated as
objections in limine to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal or as preliminary objections on
grounds of admissibility or as substantive defences to the Claimant’s claim. The nature
of such objections is that they can only be determined in light of all the evidence of the
conduct of both Parties. It was for this reason that the Tribunal originally ordered that the

plea of illegality be joined to the merits, where such evidence could be fully tested.

2. Evaluation of the evidence

In the application of the law to the facts, the Tribunal will, as it must, determine the facts
on issues that require its decision on the basis of the evidence presented before it in the
present arbitration. For that purpose, as Article 24(1) UNCITRAL Rules provides: ‘Each
party shall bear the burden of proving the facts relied on to support his claim or defence.’
As it is the Respondent that advances the plea of illegality, it is the Respondent that bears

the burden of proving the facts that it relies upon to support its plea.

Criminal intent. In addressing this issue, the critical factor is that of intention. In other
words, even if there were a failure to pay tax that was properly due, did the persons that
set up the structure of payments ftom which the sums paid by the Claimant under the
Loans were derived intend to defraud the Russian tax authorities? This does not require
knowledge that the acts would constitute a specific crime. What is required is well
captured in the Russian Criminal Code which requires:

A crime shall be deemed to be committed with direct intention if the person was
conscious of the social danger of his acts (omission), foresaw the possibility or the

inevitability of the onset of socially dangerous consequences, and willed such

529.

Ro)

The principle so stated accords with the way in which intention is generally understood

in criminal law in other major legal systems.

530.

So

Scope of enquiry. For this purpose, the fact that the Tribunal is concerned with
determining illegal intent vis-a-vis the funds that were used for the purpose of the Loans
serves to focus its enquiry. The Respondent advances very wide-ranging allegations of
illegal conduct by the ‘Yukos Oligarchs’ from the inception of their acquisition of Yukos
Oil in 1995. The Tribunal has already held®” that these allegations are not germane to

the enquiry that it must undertake in relation to the claims in the present arbitration.

wn
wo

. The Respondent also raises allegations concerning the alleged misuse by Yukos Oil of
other forms of on-shore tax evasion through the incorporation of companies in low-tax
regions of Russia or ZATOs. Professor Batsiev confirmed in evidence that Yukos Oil was
not using any such companies in the years 2001-2003." The use of such companies is
therefore also not germane to the present case, since the Loans were not derived from
funds received from the use of companies in ZATOs but from trading subsidiaries

principally in Mordovia and Evenkia.

532. The result is that the Tribunal will focus its enquiry on the specific structure that was
actually used at the material time in 2003-2004, when the Loans were made. The Tribunal
has summarised this structure in Part III.B above. It is depicted in diagrammatic form at

[104] and is referred to as the Armenian Branch.

Mr Misamore deposed that ‘from the time when I joined YUKOS Oil as CFO in 2001, 1
sought assurances that the structure was fully compliant with all relevant Russian tax
laws. I received those assurances from multiple expert legal and tax advisers.” 93 Ina prior
interview that he had given to the Russian criminal authorities investigating
Mr Khodorkovsky, Mr Misamore had dealt specifically with the arrangements for the
funding of the Loan through the Armenian Branch.™ Considering the payment of the
dividend from Fargoil to Nassaubridge in Cyprus, he stated: ‘There was absolutely
nothing about this dividend that could possibly constitute money laundering.’ °°” He
explained the purpose of the dividend and subsequent payments as being to minimise
taxes in order to fund the cash needs of the Yukos Group, in particular in relation to the
Sibneft merger. He deposed that the payment of the dividend was disclosed to the Russian

tax authorities, because withholding tax was paid on it.°°° Mr Misamore was taken to this

The Respondent placed some reliance at the Hearing on its alleged inability to call

Mr Dimitry Merinson, who had been cash manager in the Treasury Group in Moscow at

the relevant time, to give evidence.°'* Prior to the Hearing, on 15 April 2019, the

Respondent had raised alleged difficulties in obtaining evidence from Mr Merinson (and

two other former Yukos Oil employees) as one ground for an application for adjournment

of the merits Hearing.?'> Having received both written and oral submissions from both

Parties, the Tribunal ruled on this application in PO N° 10 on 30 April 2019. The Tribunal

found that the Respondent had been aware of the likely testimony of Mr Merinson since

his interrogation by the Russian Prosecutor on 25 April 2018.°'* It had also been aware

of the confidentiality undertakings given by Mr Merinson since the Judgment of the
English High Court on 27 February 2018,?!7

The Tribunal ruled:

78. If therefore the Respondent had wished to adduce evidence from any of these
persons, it has had ample time to do so at a time in which any issues of confidentiality
could have been addressed and, if necessary, appropriate provision in that respect
could have been made by the Tribunal.

79. It is, in the Tribunal’s view, no answer to say, as the Respondent does, that it had
hoped to obtain the relevant evidence through the disclosure process and, this not
having been obtained, it must seek to prove its case by other means.

80. In international arbitration, each Party is obliged to support its case by reference
to all of the evidence on which it relies, including written statement of witnesses.
The present case is no different.

81. It is thus incumbent on each party to decide whom it wishes to call as witnesses
to support its allegations. In the present case, this issue is one that the Parties would
have had to consider in relation to the merits since the resumption of the case in «
September 2017, and in particular in Respondent’s case at the latest since the
Claimant’s service of the Memorial on 27 October 2017.

82. It cannot, in the Tribunal’s view, be a ground for adjournment if a party chooses
not to progress the steps necessary to adduce evidence from particular witnesses and

instead waits to see whether the requisite evidence is produced as a result of
disclosure from the opposing party.

83. In any event, the Claimant has confirmed that ‘any confidentiality obligations to
which Messrs. Merinson and Ketcha are subject would not be enforced to prohibit
their providing any testimony in these proceedings’.

84. The Tribunal therefore rejects the suggestion that the Respondent's inability (if
it be the case) to call evidence from these persons results from a failure to cooperate
on the part of the Claimant.?!®
545. Expert evidence. On criminal intent, the Respondent relied upon the expert evidence of
Professor Esakov, Head of the Department of Criminal Law at the National Research
University Higher School of Economics in Moscow. Professor Esakov submitted two

reports and also attended the Hearing for cross-examination.

546. Professor Esakov draws a fundamental distinction in Russian law between: (i) ‘a simple
omission in payment of taxes’; and (ii) the crime of tax evasion. He explains that the non-
payment of taxes that are due constitutes ‘an administrative violation’ but ‘is not
punishable under Russian criminal legislation.’ °!? The crime of tax evasion requires
more. It requires ‘knowingly including false information in a tax declaration’*° and the

subjective element of ‘intention.’%?!

547. He reached the conclusion that: ‘The subjective element of criminal tax evasion crime

(the intention) appears to be satisfied for the reasons stated above, at § 22.’922

548. The Tribunal has closely examined the reasons given in [22] of Professor Esakov’s
Second Report, on which he was tested under cross-examination. Professor Esakov there

states that his opinion is ‘on the basis of the documents referred to in §§ 23-24 below.’

549. In [23], he ‘substantiate[s] this conclusion’ by reference to five ‘documents provided to
me by Counsel.’ Professor Esakov confirmed under cross-examination that these

documents were ‘sufficient’ to enable him to reach his conclusion as to criminal intent.”

550. The Tribunal has considered each of the documents relied upon by Professor Esakov in

[23]:

(i) Two documents relate to the use of tax incentives in the ZATOs. As already
pointed out, the ZATOs were not used in the transaction that funded the
Loans.*25 These documents are not therefore germane to the enquiry that the
Tribunal must undertake in these proceedings.

(ii) One document relates to a ‘Production Development Fund’, which is also not

alleged to have been involved in the transaction at issue in the present case.9%

(iii) The remaining two documents mention a possible risk of ‘significant tax claims’
arising ftom the use of low-tax region entities, if the tax optimisation
mechanisms were successfully challenged by the tax authorities. 92? The
documents identify a risk that tax might be held payable if the mechanisms could

be successfully challenged. In other words, they identify the risk that an

administrative liability to pay tax might arise. They do not suggest criminal

intent to evade tax.

Professor Esakov also referred to and relied upon the Request of the Federal Tax Service
to the GPO to open a criminal investigation against the Claimant.°”* He deposed that ‘the
materials presented by the tax authorities themselves set out sufficient data pointing to
the existence of the elements of a crime.’””? The grounds set out in that Request were that
‘at the time the loan was granted, Yukos Oil Company OJSC had already been presented
with significant tax claims.’?° The Request reaches this conclusion on the basis that the

Loan was paid to the borrower’s account on 13 January 2006.

This is plainly incorrect. The sums that were advanced under the Loans were so advanced
from December 2003—October 2004. The initial payments predated any tax claim against
Yukos Oil. When this was put to him in cross-examination, Professor Esakov accepted
that the GPO would not have conducted a pre-investigative inquiry into the facts

supporting grounds for the Request.°?!

Professor Esakov also placed some evidentiary reliance on the findings of the ECtHR in
the claims brought by Yukos Oil and Messrs Khodorkovsky and Lebedev against the
Respondent.°*? These judgments, while they are undoubtedly to be accorded the greatest
of respect as decisions on matters within that Court’s remit, cannot constitute evidence of
fact before the present Tribunal. As the Tribunal had cause to explain in its PO N° 6 dated
1 November 2018, for this to be so, it would be necessary to establish that these decisions

case, it would of course have much wider implications for the case as a whole, in light of
the conclusions reached by the ECtHR on the claimants’ various claims of expropriation
in those cases. But the Respondent makes no such allegation, nor could it in view of the

difference in the identity of the parties.

554, PwC. Two of the documents relied upon Professor Esakov and referred to in [550] above
emanated from the auditors to the Yukos Group, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). At the
Hearing, both Parties sought to support their respective cases on illegality by reference to
the position of PwC:

(i) The Claimant argues that the structure which the Yukos Group had adopted was
set up on the advice of PwC, which had endorsed its legality, °° as its fact

witnesses, Mr Misamore and Mr Smirnov, attest.%35

(ii) The Respondent submits that the Claimant has produced no documentary
evidence from PwC that would support this proposition. It points out that it
sought any such documents in the production phase and none were produced.
The Respondent invites the Tribunal to draw an adverse inference from the
absence of such documents that ‘either they do not have it anymore, they never
had it, they don’t want us to see it.’ It adds that PwC subsequently withdrew

its certification of the Yukos Group’s financial statements.

555. The Tribunal considers that the absence of specific documentation from PwC relevant to
the Armenian Branch is a point that ultimately assists neither Party. In the absence of such
documentation, the Tribunal is not prepared to draw the conclusion that the Claimant

invites it to make to the effect that the structure was considered and approved by PwC.

556. On the other hand, it is the Respondent that bears the burden of proving its case on

illegality. It had the opportunity to cross-examine the Claimant’s witnesses of fact on their

statements as to the support derived from PwC. Their testimony on this point was not
materially altered under cross-examination.°3” Nor did such cross-examination give the
Tribunal cause to doubt the Claimant’s verification of the adequacy of its production of

documents, which was confirmed by the signed statement of Mr Godfrey.

557. In these circumstances, the Tribunal draws no adverse inference from the absence of -
documentation from PwC of the kind that the Respondent urges it to make in support of

its case on illegality.

3. Conclusion

558. In light of the evidence presented, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent has not
established that the arrangements through which the funds were remitted to make the
Loans were the fruits of a scheme established with the criminal intent to evade Russian

tax.

559. The case that the Respondent has advanced depends (whatever the applicable law) on a
finding of deliberate criminal intent. As this crucial element has not been established, it
is unnecessary for the Tribunal to go on to determine the question (much debated in the
expert evidence adduced by both Parties”>°) whether or not the transfer of sums under the
Loans did or did not meet the requirements of the Luxembourg-Russia DTA such that
interest payable under the Loans could benefit from that Treaty’s provisions. TI his
question would only have arisen if the Tribunal were satisfied on the evidence that the
Claimant had the requisite mens rea. For the reasons developed above, the Tribunal does

not consider that such criminal intention has been established, and so it is not necessary

to reach the question whether tax ought to have been paid in Russia on the interest

payments under the Loans, °°

CAUSATION AND CONTRIBUTION TO THE INJURY
INTRODUCTION

There is no dispute between the Parties that sums were advanced under the Loans. Nor is
it disputed that (save for some initial interest payments) the Loans were not repaid by the
debtor, Yukos Oil, and that no sums in respect of them were recovered in the latter’s

bankruptcy, Yukos Capital’s proof of debt having been declared inadmissible.

There is nevertheless a substantial issue raised by the arguments of the Parties that the
Tribunal must resolve relating to foreseeability and causation of loss. The resolution of
this issue will affect whether the sums due under the Loans are properly to be treated as

recoverable compensation against the Respondent for its breach of the ECT.

The Respondent submits that this issue goes to the admissibility of the claim before the
Tribunal because it gives rise to an abuse of its process. The Claimant accepts that this
issue is relevant, but submits that, on the facts of this case, it goes to ‘damages, not
admissibility’ *#' and is concerned with the question of ‘proximate cause.’°*? For the
reasons developed below, the Tribunal considers that the question whether the risk of loss
of its investment was reasonably foreseeable by the Claimant goes to causation: whether
the proximate cause of the Claimant’s loss is attributable to its own actions in committing
funds when the risk of their loss was already foreseeable rather than to the Respondent’s

breaches of the Treaty.

* Further, the Respondent does not allege that any award of compensation to the Claimant should be reduced by

the amount of tax that should otherwise have been paid pursuant to the construction of the Luxembourg DTA for

which it contends.

563. In view of the importance of this issue and the difference of approach adopted by the
Parties in their written pleadings, the Tribunal formulated some specific questions to the

Parties and invited their submissions on them in closing. The pertinent questions were:

5. Respondent alleges that Claimant’s claim is an abuse of process because the
present dispute was foreseeable at the time the Investments were made: (a) is there
a distinction, as a matter of international law, between restructuring an existing
investment to take advantage of treaty protection that would not otherwise be
available, which parenthetically we note is the subject of many of the cases, and the
initial making of an investment? (b) on what authority does Claimant rely for the
proposition advanced in its Reply at 526 that the foreseeability of a dispute is
relevant to the calculation of loss but not to an allegation of abuse of process?

6. To what extent was the dispute that is the subject matter of the present proceedings
foreseeable when—and then we take each of the three stages in the chronology:
Firstly, when the 2003 Loan was executed; secondly, when the drawdowns were
made under that Loan; and then thirdly, and finally, when the 2004 Loan was
executed and drawn down?

ieiinaeEua#s» =

7. Does it make a difference (on each Party’s theory) whether funds are advanced to
support a related party of the Claimant (here Yukos Oil) in a process that with
hindsight formed part of the alleged expropriation which is the basis of the
Claimant’s claim? And if so, why?

 

564. Both Parties availed themselves of the opportunity thus afforded to address these

questions in their closing submissions.

565. The Tribunal therefore addresses this issue before considering whether compensation is

due and, if so, on what basis and in what amount.

B. ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES
1, The Respondent’s position

566.

a

The Respondent contends that the Loans are not entitled to investment protection because
they were advanced at a time when the dispute was foreseeable, and specifically they
were advanced when there was a foreseeable risk that Yukos Oil would not be able to

repay the Loans because of the Tax Assessments that form the basis of the present claim.

Page 200 of 303

567. The Respondent formulates this objection in terms of abuse of process, and relies on two
lines of authority for the proposition that investment protection is not available for

investments that were made when the dispute was foreseeable:*"*

(i) First, tribunals have dismissed claims where a claimant has restructured its
investment to benefit from the protection of an investment treaty ‘at a point in

time when a specific dispute was foreseeable’ ;**>

(ii) Second, tribunals have denied protection ‘when the claimant has knowingly
assumed the investment risk that ultimately materialized’ on the basis that
‘Bilateral Investment Treaties are not insurance policies against bad business

judgments.’947

568. The Respondent says that the funds were advanced at a time when the dispute was not
only foreseeable but already ongoing, and in those circumstances the claim is an abuse of

process and contrary to the international law principle of good faith.”

569. The Respondent maintains that there is no relevant distinction in result between
restructuring an existing investment and making a new investment when the dispute was

foreseeable at the time: both constitute an abuse of process.%? In the latter case, the

investor is assuming the risk of the dispute and the loss of the investment: the investor
must take the company in which it invests as it finds it.5° The Respondent accepts that
there is overlap between questions of abuse of process and questions of causation, since

the same facts could be relevant to both.°*!

570. Inthat connection, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal must focus on the knowledge
held by Yukos Capital at the relevant time (not necessarily information held by the
market). The Tribunal must take into account the risks that Yukos Oil was deliberately
running in 2003 and 2004, and that Yukos Capital must have known about those risks. In

d bil

this respect, the R accepts that ility cannot be d with hindsigt

but that hindsight can help to assess objective and subjective risk at the time.95

In closing, the Respondent advanced five related points:

(i) It was foreseeable that Yukos Oil might not be willing or able to repay the

Loans;°*
(ii) The risk of insolvency was foreseeable and assumed by Yukos Capital;
(iii) The Respondent's alleged offending acts did not cause the insolvency;
(iv) The Respondent’s alleged offending acts were foreseeable; and
(v) Yukos Capital assumed the risk of Yukos Oil’s own reckless behaviour.

572. Causation. First, the Respondent argues that the necessary causation was not present.

Yukos Oil’s working capital position showed it to be in a ‘precarious state’ when the

could have foreseen Yukos Oil’s unwillingness or inability to repay, rather than assessing that question in the

abstract.

December 2003 Loan was executed, and this called into question its willingness or ability

to service the Loan.%>

573. In particular, Yukos Oil needed to borrow money in order to meet its needs (including
from Brittany via Yukos Capital).°° As a holding company, Yukos Oil relied on cash
flow but was not receiving dividends because this income was being diverted to the LTR
Subsidiaries. Thus, the Respondent submits there is no factual basis for the assumption
that Yukos Oil would have obtained funding from its subsidiaries. °°? While the
Respondent accepts that Yukos Oil could have sold an asset or taken on more debt to
service the Yukos Capital Loan, it submits that this is an artificial assumption when there
would be no repercussions if they did not pay off the Yukos Capital Loan.° The
Respondent accepts that there was enough money within the Group to satisfy the Loans,

but it was offshore.%?

574. Foreseeability of insolvency. Second, the Respondent submits that Yukos Oil’s
insolvency was foreseeable in December 2003, because it had negative working capital
and no discernible income, in a legal framework where non-payment of debts for three
months is sufficient to commence insolvency procedures. This is why Société Générale
and Moravel required security. In contrast, Yukos Capital did not demand any protection
from Yukos Oil’s weak liquidity.°°

575. Third, the Respondent submits that the Claimant had presented no financial analysis to

demonstrate what caused Yukos Oil to become insolvent, submitting that it was in fact

the Société Générale decision to initiate bankruptey proceedings and Yukos Oil’s

Fourth, the Respondent submits that the Respondent’s acts that are said to have pushed
Yukos Oil into insolvency were foreseeable, particularly in light of the arrest of Messrs
Khodorkovsky and Lebedev.°

577. Assumption of risk. Finally, the Respondent submits that because of its related party
status, Yukos Capital assumed the risk of Yukos Oil’s reckless behaviour throughout
2003 and 2004, and in particular the failure to pay the Tax Assessments, the making of
‘meaningless’ settlement agreements (involving offering shares in Sibneft while the

transaction was being unwound), and its ‘reckless’ interference with the YNG auetion.?

e

. Failure to mitigate/contribution. Alternatively, the Respondent argues that the Claimant
failed to mitigate its loss or contributed to it, submitting that the Claimant’s failures in
this regard ought to preclude or reduce recovery in the present case since ‘investment
treaties such as the ECT are not insurance policies against business risk.’ ° Citing Article
39 of the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts
(ARSIWA), it argues that the principle of contributory fault is well known in arbitral
practice and was applied in MTD v Chile with the consequence that, even though the
tribunal found the respondent liable for breach of treaty, it reduced the damages by 50%
because the claimant had not conducted itself as a wise investor. It submits that the effect
of the Claimant’s various ‘uncommercial decisions’ means that, if the Tribunal were to
find in favour of the Claimant ‘it should negate or reduce any award of damages’ to reflect

its contributory fault.9

579. In this regard, the Respondent argues that Yukos Capital failed to mitigate its risk by

extending two unsecured loans to Yukos Oil on ‘uncommercial terms, in circumstances

where truly arms’ length lenders undoubtedly would have refrained.’°% Specifically in

relation to the August 2004 Loan, it points out that this Loan was made in circumstances

where Yukos Oil already had frozen bank accounts, had significant tax liabilities, had

already referred to its own possible bankruptcy in a press release, and already had a public

notice of default issued against it in respect of another loan.°®’ The Respondent further

notes that, at the time of the August 2004 Loan, Yukos Capital had not received and had

failed to request information regarding Yukos Oil’s financial health under the December
2003 Loan.**

580. The Respondent submits that the Claimant and its controllers borrowed and loaned funds
without formal loan agreements and did so on uncommercial terms.°© The Respondent
also argues that the Claimant failed to mitigate its damages by failing to call the Loans
until more than 15 months following Yukos Oil’s last interest payment, despite the fact
that under each of the Loans the Claimant could do so, if it considered that Yukos Oil’s

financial position would not allow their timely repayment.°”

581.

The Respondent further contends that this argument extends to the interest spread
damages, submitting that since there was a very significant risk that Yukos Oil would not
make any of the outstanding payments under the Loans from July 2006, the interest spread

damages should also be reduced to zero.*”!

2. The Claimant’s position

Legal principles. The Claimant accepts that foreseeability of a dispute is relevant. It
submits that on the facts of this case it should not be assessed in terms of abuse of process,

but rather is relevant to damages taking into account the requirement for causation.°” In

particular, the Claimant submits:°7?

(i) Re-domiciling an existing investment in order to obtain treaty protection is

recognised as giving rise to an abuse of process.

(ii) Where a new investment is being made, it is necessary to distinguish between
cases where there was no existing financing vehicle in place (and the investor
chose to establish the vehicle in a particular country to obtain treaty protection)
and cases where an existing financing vehicle was already established in a

country with treaty protection.

The Claimant argues that where there is no existing financing vehicle in place, to make
an investment when there were hostilities against the borrower that made a dispute
foreseeable, might give rise to an abuse of process. However, it submits that in the second
category no abuse of process could arise. On the facts of the present case, the Claimant
submits that because it was incorporated in January 2003 before any of the relevant acts
occurred, it was ‘already treaty-protected for any investment it makes’ and there can be

no abuse of process.

Nevertheless, the Claimant accepts that an investor in that position ‘may have quantum
issues if it makes an investment where a dispute is foreseeable’®” so that on the facts of
the present case, any question of foreseeability can only be relevant ‘to the calculation of

loss.?97°

585. The Claimant did not disagree with the proposition that knowledge held by Yukos Oil
could be taken into account in assessing whether the Claimant could or should have
foreseen the dispute. Mr Godfrey’s evidence was that the decision to make the Loans
would have been made by the Management Board in Moscow and executed by the

Treasury Group.°”

586. Factual submissions. The Claimant advanced its submissions on the evidence in closing
in response to the Tribunal’s Question 6, in which it had asked the Parties to address the
foreseeability of the dispute at three periods: (i) when the December 2003 Loan was
executed; (ii) when the drawdowns were made under that Loan; and (iii) when the August

2004 Loan was executed and drawn down.

587. The Claimant says that in December 2003, there was no reason to believe that there was
going to be a dispute under an investment agreement, noting in particular the conclusion
of the internal working group that it was ‘business as usual.’*”’ The Claimant also submits
that there was no reason for concern during the period of the drawdowns until the 2000
Tax Assessment (issued on 14 April 2004) was first upheld by the courts on 26 May 2004,
because until that point the advice received by Yukos was that ‘even the Russian courts
could withstand political pressure’ in relation to the December 2003 audit ‘because [it]
was so ridiculous.’>”* It noted, in particular, that any dispute would have to involve the

liquidation of Yukos Oil, since otherwise it would be able to meet the repayments.

588. The Claimant states that ‘the key date for the drawdowns is 26 May 2004,’ being ‘the first

time a Russian court validates the Tax Assessment.’ It goes on to explain:

9%6 F2/350/12-19; T2/352/1-6; T2/352/13-353/4 (Godfrey), Mr Theede testified to having no recollection of this
issue (T2/392/1-21), and Mr Misamore’s evidence was that the Treasury Group ‘determined the need for funds
within the Group’ and sent out ‘proposals’ and Yukos Capital would have made the loan ‘if they had no issues
with it? (T2/493/12-494/2),

Up until that time, you have an assessment that’s been issued in late 2003. The advice
from the counsel, that’s the Pepeliaev memo that’s in the record, was that even the
Russian courts could withstand political pressure because that was so ridiculous,
but—so it’s not until May that the Russian courts actually do validate that. And that’s
a fact. And that makes a dispute —well, it begins to suggest, is there an issue?°®°
On the other hand, it submits that these ‘rumblings’ were counteracted by President
Putin’s subsequent statement in June 2004 that the State had no intention to bankrupt

Yukos Oil.%8!

The August 2004 Loan was made in the midst of an escalation of events “and for the
purpose of trying to satisfy some of the Tax Assessment{(s].’ °°? By that stage, the
Claimant could foresee that the Russian State was hostile to Yukos Oil in a way that might

impact its investment.°%

Nevertheless, Claimant submits that it could not foresee that the bankruptcy of Yukos Oil
was likely or a real possibility, given that Yukos Oil was meeting its obligations. The
Claimant submits that it was only after the ‘sham’ auction of YNG that Yukos Capital

had real cause for concern.”

The Claimant accepts that ‘foreseeability is the legal touchstone’®® and that, in light of
the expert evidence of Mr Rosen,”*’ by August 2004, there is the possibility of a legal

dispute which the Tribunal is entitled to weigh in its deliberations.°*

No failure to mitigate. The Claimant argues that the risk that caused Yukos Capital to
suffer under the Loans ‘had nothing to do with their commercial terms or unreasonable
commercial risks’, but was rather caused by the Respondent’s illegal expropriation of the
issuer of the debt, Yukos Oil.% It contends that this particular risk ‘could not have been

anticipated.’°°

With particular reference to the August 2004 Loan, the Claimant contends that, while the
first tax assessment had been issued and certain enforcement actions had indeed
commenced against Yukos Oil at the time the Loan was made, positive public assurances
had been given by the Respondent as to the future of Yukos Oil on which the Claimant

was entitled to rely.°7!

The Claimant therefore submits that the Respondent’s assertion that the Claimant failed
to mitigate its risk is unfounded, and its assertion that ‘truly arms’ length lenders
undoubtedly would have refrained’ from lending to Yukos Oil is unsupported by the

evidence. °°

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS”?
1. Characterisation of the issue

The Tribunal has already stated in its Introduction to Part VII that it attaches particular
importance to the proper characterisation of the issue that arises for decision in relation
to the legal significance (if any) of the Claimant’s own conduct at the time of the making
of its ii Upon this preliminary question of ck isation hangs the legal test
to be applied to the facts. It was for this reason that it invited the Parties to address closing

596. There are in summary, four sub-issues that arise:
(i) Is the question one of admissibility to be determ: ined by reference to the principle

of abuse of process, or does it go to the extent of the substantive obligation to

make reparation for the injury caused by the Respondent’s illegal act?
(ii) If the latter, what legal test is applicable to determine causation?

(iii) Is there a distinction between causation and contribution to the injury, and, if so,

what is the difference?
(iv) What date or dates are relevant for this purpose?

597. Abuse of process or causation? The Tribunal has already indicated that it has reached the
view that the Claimant’s conduct in this case is properly analysed as a question of

causation and not as one of abuse of process.

598.

Undoubtedly there are cases in which the manner in which a claimant seeks to engage the
jurisdiction of the tribunal constitutes an abuse of process. A classic instance is where ‘an
investor has changed its corporate structure to gain the protection of an investment treaty
at a point in time when a specific dispute was foreseeable.’°™ This type of circumstance
is properly characterised as an abuse of process because the investor is abusively seeking
to invoke the protection of an international tribunal before whom to pursue its claim
where, prior to the dispute, it had no such right. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent
that this type of conduct constitutes bad faith on the part of the investor and renders the

claim inadmissible and liable to dismissal.

599. However, this is not the present case. The Claimant did not change its corporate
nationality between incorporation and the events of which it makes complaint in order to

seek to take the benefit of an investment treaty to which it had not previously been

entitled. It was on any view already incorporated in Luxembourg before the dispute arose.

600. The second category of cases on which the Respondent relies are cases in which ‘the

has ingly d the i risk that ultimately materialized’®> on
the basis that ‘Bilateral Investment Treaties are not insurance policies against bad

business judgments.’9°

601.

The Tribunal accepts the elementary principles (i) that an investor must take the
conditions of the host State as it finds them and cannot make complaint simply because
the known hazards of investing in a particular country materialise;°” and (ii) that an
investor must take responsibility for its own business decisions. But the cases on which
the Respondent relies in support of these propositions were not decided on grounds of
want of jurisdiction or inadmissibility. On the contrary, they were decided on the merits
in which the tribunals were concerned to determine whether the relevant treaty standard

had been breached or the true cause of the claimant’s alleged loss.

602. Asa result, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent’s submission that objections of this kind
are properly characterised as abuse of process, such that they go to the jurisdiction of the
Tribunal or admissibility of the claim. This does not mean that the Claimant’s conduct is

irrelevant to its claim for damages.

603. Causation & reasonable foreseeability. Where, as here, the Tribunal has found the
Respondent liable for breach of its international obligations under treaty, its obligation is

“to make full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act.’ 58 As

Bin Cheng put it, summarising the earlier arbitral authorities: ‘The proper criterion... is,
therefore, not the directness of the consequences, but their foreseeability or proximate

causality in relation to the wrongful act.’99

604. One way in which the chain of causation may be broken is by the victim’s own actions.
As the International Law Commission observed in its Commentary on ARSIWA:
It is possible to envisage situations where the injury in question is entirely
attributable to the conduct of the victim and not at all to that of the ‘responsible’
State. Such situations are covered by the general requirement of proximate cause
referred to in article 31..."
The distinction drawn in this passage between the conduct of the victim and that of the
responsible State means neither more nor less than that—as in any case in which the chain
of causation is broken by conduct other than that of the respondent—the tribunal is
presented with two possible causes and finds that one (in this context the conduct of the
victim) is the proximate cause, because it is the predominant or operative cause of the

claimant’s loss.

605. This question, being a pure question of causation, does not depend upon the establishment

of fault or negligence on the part of the claimant or any apportionment of responsibility

 

bety the clai and the respondent State. The question of causation only arises
where the tribunal has already determined that the respondent has committed an

internationally wrongful act. The tribunal must then determine whether the actions of the

State caused the claimant’s loss. The chain of causation may be broken where the
proximate cause of the claimant’s loss is the claimant’s own decision to invest in light of
the reasonable foreseeability that its investment may well be lost. It is not necessary for
this purpose that the claimant could foresee the precise form of unlawful act that the
respondent may commit or the particular character of the resulting dispute between the

parties.

606.

a

A finding that the proximate cause of the claimant’s loss is his own actions has been
dispositive in a number of cases, despite findings of culpability on the part of the
respondent. In ELS/,'~' a Chamber of the ICJ held that, although the respondent State
had requisitioned the company, the underlying cause of the company’s difficulties lay in
its own mismanagement and not the act of requisition. In Maffezini, the tribunal concluded
that ‘[w]hile it is probably true that there were shortcomings in the policies and

> 1002

practices of the relevant State entities, the respondent could not be held responsible

1093 the tribunal concluded that the

for Mr Maffezini’s own business losses. In Olguin,
relevant State organs ‘clearly appear to have been negligent.’ !°°* However, it went on ‘it
needs to be determined whether, in this case, there existed a suitable causal link that
would produce specific legal consequences, such as an obligation, on the part of the State
of Paraguay, and a right, on the part of Mr. Olguin, to demand and obtain compensation
for the losses he suffered.’ !°5 The tribunal ruled that Mr Olguin’s claim must be denied.

His losses were caused by his own imprudence in making his investments. !°°°

607. In Biwater,'%7 the tribunal found that the respondent State had committed multiple
breaches of the BIT, including by means of expropriation.' It nevertheless dismissed

all of the claimant’s claims for damages. ! The tribunal’s reasoning is instructive. It held

that ‘it is well settled that one key requirement of any claim for compensation (whether

for unlawful expropriation or any other breach of Treaty) is the element of causation.’ 1010
Citing Article 31(2) ARSIWA, the commentary thereon and ELSI, it decided that ‘[t]he
key issue in this case is the factual link between the wrongful acts and the damage in
question, as opposed to any issue as to remoteness or indirect loss.’'°!! Applying the
principles of causation to the facts of that case, the tribunal concluded that ‘the actual,
proximate or direct causes of the loss and damage for which [the claimant] now seeks
compensation’ were its own acts and not the respondent’s violations of the BIT.'°!? In
that case, this was despite the fact that the claimant’s conduct preceded the respondent

State’s measures.

608. In the present case, the Claimant accepts that the Respondent’s actions must be the
‘proximate cause’''} of its loss, and that, for this purpose ‘foreseeability is the legal
touchstone.’ !°'4 The Respondent, for its part (while insisting on abuse of process)
nevertheless submits that ‘it is intimately related to foreseeability.’!°'S It explains that:

“Because you foresee the risk, you assume it.’ !°!6

Contribution to injury. Even where the chain of causation is not broken in this way, the
Tribunal may be required, in order to do equity between the claimant and the respondent
to take account of ‘the contribution to the injury by wilful or negligent action or omission
of the... entity in relation to whom reparation is sought.’'°'7 The determination of the
extent of such contribution requires an assessment of the proportional extent to which the

claimant’s own negligent or wilful conduct contributed to its loss.

This was the approach adopted in MTD v Chile,!°'® where the Tribunal found a breach of
treaty on the part of the respondent, but apportioned the claimant’s damages 50:50 in
order to take account of the contribution of the claimant to its own loss. An ad hoc
committee comprising Judge Guillaume, Professor Crawford (as he then was) and
Dr Ordéfiez Noriega, upheld this approach on annulment. Citing Article 39 ARSIWA, it
held: ‘There is no reason not to apply the same principle of contribution to claims for
breach of treaty brought by individuals.’!°'?

The committee then went on to consider whether the tribunal had been at fault in failing
to give reasons for its 50:50 apportionment. Finding that there was no annullable error in

this respect, it explained:

As is often the case with situations of comparative fault, the role of the two parties
contributing to the loss was very different and only with difficulty commensurable,
and the Tribunal had a corresponding margin of estimation. Furthermore, in an
investment treaty claim where contribution is relevant, the respondent’s breach will
normally be regulatory in character, whereas the claimant’s conduct will be different,
a failure to safeguard its own interests rather than a breach of any duty owed to the
host State. In such situations it is not unusual for the loss to be shared equally.
International tribunals which have reached ths point have often not given any ‘exact
explanation’ of the calculations involved.”

612. The consequence is that if, at any given date, the evidence falls short of breaking the chain

of causation, it is still necessary to consider whether the Claimant has, by wilfully or
loentl di

4 ly or inuing to extend ad’ to Yukos Oil, contributed to its

own loss, and, if so, by what extent.

613. The Parties also addressed this second question as one of whether the Claimant had failed
to mitigate its loss. There is indeed a connection, since the International Court of Justice
has observed as a basis for the calculation of damages that ‘an injured State which has
failed to take the necessary measures to limit the damage sustained would not be entitled
to claim compensation for that damage which could have been avoided.’ 1021 The same

principle is applicable to the conduct of a private claimant.

614. In the Tribunal’s view, on the facts of this case, the issue is more properly analysed as
one of the Claimant’s contribution to its own loss. It is not alleged that there were steps
that the Claimant ought to have taken that might have mitigated a loss already suffered.
Rather the issue is whether the Claimant ought not to have made certain of its investments
by way of advances under the Loans in light of the risk of loss that was then reasonably
foreseeable. In other words, did the Claimant, by its own deliberate or negligent acts or

omissions, contribute to its loss?

615. Relevant dates, The relevant dates on which to assess reasonable foreseeability are the
dates on which the Claimant made its investment. As a starting point for analysis, this
means the dates on which the Claimant entered into the Loans to Yukos Oil, namely:
(i) 2 December 2003 in respect of the December 2003 Loan; and (ii) 19 August 2004 in
respect of the August 2004 Loan. These were the two dates on which the Claimant had to
decide whether to enter into a legal commitment by way of loan in the amount specified

in the loan documentation to make an investment in Russia.

616. However, the structure of the Loans was different.

On 3 July 2003, Mr Lebedev was arrested and detained on charges including fraud,
embezzlement and tax evasion.'°3! Two days later, Mr Khodorkovsky and Mr Leonid
Nevzlin (former Vice-Chairman of the Board of Yukos Oil) were summoned for

On 7 July 2003, Yukos Oil announced a share buyback worth USD 3.7 billion. !°

In July 2003, Yukos Oil’s offices were raided. '°34 Mr Mkhitaryan testified that following
Mr Khodorkovsky’s arrest, ‘the raids and interrogations intensified, and an atmosphere
of fear and uncertainty became pervasive at Yukos.’!°35 At the same time, contemporary
news reports confirmed that company analysts continued to recommend investors to buy
Yukos stock, stating that ‘[t]his is a temporary development... Company fundamentals

remain unchanged.’ !°

On 24 July 2003, Yukos formed a working group to investigate how the recent events
were affecting the company. The working group’s interim conclusions on 9 August 2003
suggested that operational activities were proceeding normally and that investigations of
the company would not lead to viable legal challenges, but that ‘defensive measures’
against individuals associated with the company had not been successful.'°>7 The view

two resolutions failed, and the third passed.'°3 Mr Nevzlin was quoted as stating that
Sibneft shareholders had asked the controlling interests of Yukos Oil to postpone the
scheduled vote on the first two items for undisclosed ‘technical difficulties’, but
emphasised that the merger had not been shelved and that the exchange of shares was still
effective. Mr Theede’s evidence was that he became aware at some point after the meeting

that the shareholders of the two companies had met.!°>*

635. A representative of Sibneft was reported as confirming that Yukos executives might be
unaware of these developments because they arose out of an agreement between the
shareholders. Both Yukos Oil CEO Mr Kukes and Mr Theede stated that they had not
been notified of the merger being suspended, and the former stated that all merger
processes were going to plan.'°> Mr Theede’s evidence under examination was that he
found out after the meeting that the ‘Sibneft people’ were trying to unwind the
transaction, !°5 while Mr Misamore’s recollection was that the two shareholder groups
were willing to discuss unwinding the transaction and this was related to the arrest of
Mr Khodorkovsky. !°°7

636. Commenting on the suspension of the merger, the Russian Minister of Economic
Development and Trade stated that the ‘whole situation with Yukos is generally negative

The Board of Directors met that afternoon, expressing its concern at the Sibneft
developments and recommending that the Management Board ‘present the members of
the Board of Directors with an analysis of the possible risks contained in the agreements
previously signed by the Company relating to the transaction with Sibneft for the adoption
of future decisions’ by 10 December 2003. As part of the third item on the agenda, the
Board ‘expressed their concern regarding whether the management of the Company had
duly assessed the political risks with the current situation’ and voted to create a working
committee to study the same.!° Finally, the Board voted to approve the Yukos Capital

December 2003 Loan as a major transaction, !°°

The Tribunal questioned Mr Misamore about the decision to advance the December 2003
Loan. Mr Misamore testified that at the time of arranging the December 2003 Loan and
the first drawdown, he did not give any consideration to the risk that, as a result of the
developments occurring in Russia affecting the company, it would not be repaid. Noting
the tax certificates that the company had received, he testified:
Clearly, when your—the CEO, effectively, of Yukos Oil Company had been arrested
on charges, that’s a pretty traumatic affair, and we rebounded from that, but the
nature of the company and its continuing operations were still very strong, the
company had a Market Capitalization in excess of 40 billion, I believe, right after

the Sibneft merger; that was the same Market Capitalization in, I believe, April 2004,
when I had a conference call.

So, the market didn’t perceive an awful lot of risk either, and we were continuing
operations, '°*!

1059 The members of the Board of Directors were named as Messrs Kukes, Golubev, Buclez, Kontorovich, Loze,

Soublin, Pokholkov, Gupta, Carey and Kosciusko-Morizet, and the meeting was also attended by inter alia Mr

639. Mr Misamore testified that the company was ‘mystified’ at the commencement of the tax
audit in light of the 17 November 2003 certificate, and that they did not realise that the

process was politically motivated at the time. yom

(b) Events between 3 December 2003 and the August 2004 Loan

640. On 8 December 2003, the Russian Tax Ministry served notice on Yukos Oil of its
intention to conduct a further tax audit for the year 2000. This report was issued on
29 December 2003 and found that Yukos Oil was liable for underpaid taxes of RUB 79.6
billion (approximately USD 2.72 billion) together with fines and interest amounting to
RUB 98.5 billion (USD 3.37 billion).'® In a memorandum, Mr Gololobov stated that it
was probable that any objections to the report would most likely not be accepted, and that
payment could be demanded to be paid within a day. 064

641. On 18 December 2003 and again on 22 April 2003, Standard & Poors downgraded Yukos

Oil’s credit rating.'°

642. Around this time, the home and offices of Mr Gololobov, who was coordinating Yukos

Oil’s response to the Tax Assessments, were raided. !0%

643. Yukos Oil was advised by Russian counsel, Sergei Pepiliaev, on 5 January 2004, that:

The position of the Ministry of Taxes and Levies stipulated in the inspection act is
totally inconsistent with the Russian tax law and also the practice of its application.

Analysis of the act... affords grounds to assume that the results of the inspection
must be invalidated by the arbitration court. Court practice in similar cases is not in
favour of the Ministry of Taxes and Levies.

Even if we assume political pressure on the court the extent of violations committed
by the Ministry for Taxes and Levies will make it impossible even for the most
biased judge to support the clearly unlawful inspection act.'°®”
644. On 16 February 2004, the Moscow Arbitrazh Court made an interim order prohibiting
Yukos Oil from taking actions to dispose of, transfer or encumber the Sibneft shares it

had earlier acquired under the Deed of Share Exchange. '°

645. On 1 March 2004, the Moscow 4rbitrazh Court invalidated Yukos Oil’s issue of 1 million

common shares used to acquire the Sibneft shares. °°?

646. Mr Misamore stated that he did not consider, at the time any of the drawdowns were made
under the December 2003 Loan up to March 2004, that there was a risk that Yukos Oil
might not be able to repay, given the company’s estimated cash flow of USD 9 billion for

the year.!°7”

647. On 14 April 2004, the Tax Ministry issued its 2000 Tax Assessment, imposing on Yukos
Oil an additional liability to tax, fines and penalty interests for the year 2000 of RUB 99.4
billion (USD 3.48 billion), due to be paid two days later,'°”' and issued payment demands,
proceedings to recover the sums and an application for an ex parte injunction to secure

In July 2004, the Ministry of Justice announced its plan to sell YNG, prompting

jewel of oil production’ at Yukos Oil ‘would kick a vital foundation out from under’ the

going in for the kill’, leaving ‘little doubt the authorities’ final goal is for Yukos to cease
to exist in its current form, materially erasing most, if not all, shareholder value in the

process’, although another observer suggested it could be a ‘high-stakes bluff.’ ass

Yukos Capital entered into the August 2004 Loan on 19 August 2004. The purpose of the
Loan, as stated in the Minutes of Yukos Oil, was ‘to satisfy a part of the 2000 tax
liabilities,’ °"'
The same meeting considered Yukos Oil’s current position, which is summarised in the
following terms:
S. Theede updated the Board on the Company’s current cash situation as well as
recent meetings of the management board members with legal advisers on the
bankruptcy issues. At this time, the Company intends to avoid declaring bankruptcy.

B. Misamore stated, that in order to avoid bankruptcy, the Company would need, in
the nearest time, to stop paying VAT and the mineral extraction tax.'

Mr Misamore deposed in his First Witness Statement that the August 2004 Loan was
made in a context in which ‘[a]t the time we were desperately trying to keep the business
alive in the hope that President Putin was not intent on destroying the entire company and

that a negotiated resolution might be achieved.’ !°%

In response to a question from the Chairman, he accepted that at the time the August 2004
Loan was advanced there was ‘probably more of a risk’ that Yukos Oil might not survive,
although it ‘continued to believe’ and ‘continued to negotiate with the Russian
government for a global settlement.’ !°* He pointed out that, in April 2004, Yukos Oil
had filed a case with the European Court of Human Rights, because it had become

Mr Rosen, Claimant’s valuation expert, very fairly accepted that ‘if the Tribunal decides
these events should be considered, then they would absolutely affect the valuation of the

assets.” 1096

3. Conclusion on causation and contribution

The question for the Tribunal is whether, on the dates on which Yukos Capital made its
investments under the Loans, there was a reasonably foreseeable risk that these sums
would be lost to the Claimant as a result of the actions of the Respondent. If that is so, the
proximate cause of the Claimant’s loss will be its own actions in choosing to make the
investment despite this risk, not the Respondent’s acts. Alternatively, it may have, by its

own wilful or negligent acts, contributed to its loss.

In making this assessment, the Tribunal approaches Yukos Capital’s decisions to make
investments under the Loans as its decisions to contribute to an economic activity within
the territory of the Respondent State, for which, on each occasion, it bore the risk. This
necessarily follows from the decision of the majority of the Tribunal in the Interim Award.
As it was then put, considering respectively the requirements of contribution and risk:
A decision on the part of one subsidiary company within a multinational oil and gas
group to make a loan to another group company that is engaged in economic

activities in the energy sector in another state party to the ECT would (in principle
and in absent other contrary evidence) constitute an ‘Investment.’

A loan to an enterprise or economic venture in the host state still involves risk as to
the success or failure of the venture. At the point that the investor disburses funds
under the loan to the venture, it is committed to its success or failure. The investor
has a stake in that venture, Its risk materializes in a failure to repay.'°

In considering what was reasonably foreseeable by an investor in the position of Yukos

Capital at the time funds were advanced under the Loans, the Tribunal takes account of

the evidence as to the knowledge actually held by Yukos Capital when the decisions to

advance the funds were made. !°%8

(a) December 2003 Loan

So far as concerns the December 2003 Loan, the Tribunal concludes from its examination
of the evidence summarised above that it was not reasonably foreseeable, on 2 December

2003, that Yukos Oil would default on repayment because of the Respondent's actions.

It is certainly the case that the Respondent’s arrests of members of the senior management
of Yukos Oil, and the raid on the company’s offices, were matters of grave concern. But
the question for Yukos Capital as lender was simply whether the position of its borrower
was then such that it was reasonably foreseeable that the Loan would not be repaid in
light of the actions of the Respondent. Yukos Oil as the debtor was the parent company
of a highly profitable, cash-generating group of companies. The arrest of
Mr Khodorkovsky, while a very serious matter for the governance of Yukos Oil, is
insufficient evidence to make it reasonably foreseeable that Yukos Oil would be driven

into bankruptcy and unable to repay its debt to the Claimant.
The evidence is, in fact, to the contrary:

(i) An internal Yukos Oil review had concluded on 24 July 2003 and again on
25 September 2003 that it was business as usual at the Company, despite the
actions taken against management. This was also the view of investment analysts

reported in the press;

(ii) The Russian Ministry of Taxes had as recently as 17 September 2003 issued

certificates confirming that Yukos Oil had no tax debts outstanding;

(iii) A syndicate of Western banks had been prepared to extend a secured loan to
Yukos Oil in the amount of USD 2.6 billion in September 2003;

108 Above at [586].

Page 231 of 303

(iv) The Russian Minister of Economic Development and Trade stated that the
‘whole situation with Yukos is generally negative for the economy’ but that the
‘nationalization of Yukos is not at issue’ since if damages (presumably arising

out of unpaid taxes) were proven ‘those damages will be paid for in cash or other

company assets. !°°9

(v) The Russian Tax Ministry had not commenced a further tax audit, nor had it
issued any revised tax demand. Although both of those steps followed shortly
after the Loan, there was no prior indication that such an audit would result in a
claim for USD 3.37 billion.

672. In light of these considerations, the Tribunal concludes that it was not reasonably
foreseeable on 2 December 2003 that the sums that the Claimant had committed to
advance under the December 2003 Loan would prove to be irrecoverable as a result of

the Respondent’s actions.

673. The position evolved rapidly during the first half of 2004. The question for the Tribunal
is whether it had changed so materially as to break the chain of causation or led to a
situation in which the Claimant was contributing to its own loss. For these purposes it

necessary to take this period in stages.

674. In the first quarter of the calendar year, Yukos Oil faced its first revised tax assessment
from the Tax Ministry. On the other hand, the validity of that assessment had not yet been
determined in court. Yukos Oil had estimated a cash flow for the year of USD9
billion.!'©° The Tribunal accepts Mr Misamore’s evidence that, until this time he did not

consider that there was any risk that Yukos Oil would be unable to repay the Claimant.

675. There were a number of adverse material events in the second quarter. The Tribunal refers

in particular to:

(i) The freezing of certain of Yukos Oil’s assets by court order on 15 April 2004;

109 Completion of Yukos, Sibneft Merger Suspended, Interfax News Agency (28 November 2003), 2 (C-730).

Page 232 of 303

(ii) The upholding of the 2000 Tax Assessment by the Moscow Arbitrazh Court on

26 May 2004;

(iii) Yukos Oil’s public statement on 27 May 2004 that the pendency of the tax claim
and the freezing of its assets raised the possibility of bankruptcy ‘before the end
of 2004;7!!°! and

(iv) The removal of Judge Cherburashkina on 22 June 2004 and the annulment of her

interim orders suspending the 2000 Tax Assessment the following day.

676. The gravity of the situation was reflected in Yukos Oil’s application to the ECtHR on
23 April 2004.

677. Considering all of this evidence in the round, the Tribunal concludes that there was a
reasonably foreseeable risk that the Claimant’s investment might not be repaid from
27 May 2004—1the date on which Yukos Oil for the first time publicly acknowledged the
risk that it might be driven into bankruptcy as a result of the actions of the Tax Ministry
and the decision of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court upholding those actions on the previous
day. From that date, any lender in the position of the Claimant was on notice that further
sums that it advanced under the Loan were at some risk of non-recovery as a result of the

actions of the Respondent.

Drawdown.’!!®3 Jt had undertaken to grant loans to Yukos Oil ‘within 2 (two) business
days from the date’ of submission of a Notice of Drawdown.''® The loan is ‘deemed to
have been granted... when the funds have been credited to the Borrower’s bank

account,’ #105

Yukos Oil as Borrower undertook to repay all loans borrowed under the December 2003
Loan by no later than 31 December 2008. However under Article 2.4.1, the Claimant was
entitled to request the return of the loan before maturity where ‘the Lender shall [have]
sufficient grounds to reckon that financial position of the Borrower does not allow timely

repayment of the loan.” !!6

The Tribunal well understands that Yukos Capital’s commercial decision to commit funds
up to the maximum provided in the December 2003 Loan Agreement had been made
when that agreement was entered into on 2 December 2003. The maximum amount had
not been reached and the Agreement provided for the making of further loans on very
short notice. The position of Yukos Oil as Borrower in May 2004 was unprecedented and

fast developing. It remained uncertain.

On the other hand, the decision of the Moscow Court on 26 May 2004 to uphold the 2000
Tax Assessment and Yukos Oil’s statement on 27 May 2004 that it faced the risk of
bankruptcy should have given a reasonable lender in Yukos Capital’s position cause to
consider whether it was prudent for it to continue to advance loans under the December
2003 Loan Agreement. Article 2.4.1 provides that Yukos Capital was entitled to request
repayment prior to maturity if it as lender had reasonable grounds to consider that Yukos
Oil might not be able to make timely repayment. If a lender is entitled to recall a loan
already made where there are sufficient grounds to reckon that it will not be timely repaid,
it must be implicit in such an arrangement that the lender is not bound to continue to

advance further loans. The Tribunal considers that a public statement of the risk of

bankruptcy does amount to such sufficient grounds. A lender in the Claimant’s position
might still recover its loan by way of a claim in the borrower’s bankruptcy, but this is not

the same thing as timely repayment of the loan in accordance with its terms.

683. There is no indication on the record that the Claimant made any assessment at this stage
as to whether it was prudent for it to continue to advance further loans under the December
2003 Loan Agreement. In the circumstances as then existed between 27 May and end
June 2004 (when the total amount under the Agreement had been advanced), the Tribunal
considers that the Claimant was negligent in safeguarding its own interests as lender. By
its failure to do so, the Claimant has contributed to its own loss in respect of sums
advanced after 27 May 2004.

684. The Tribunal considers that the Claimant’s failure in this respect equally contributed to
this part of the loss along with the Respondent’s subsequent breaches of the treaty. It
therefore assesses the extent of that contribution at 50% of those sums. The Tribunal has
in this regard a margin of appreciation. On this occasion, it finds no reason to depart from

the usual approach of equal contribution. !!°7

685. Accordingly: compensation for the loss relating to the sums advanced under the
December 2003 Loan from 3 December 2003 to 26 May 2004 is properly recoverable in
the present action. Sums advanced after that date (namely the sums advanced on 16 June
2004, 22 June 2004 and 28 June 2004) may be included in the assessment of
compensation due from the Respondent to the Claimant, but discounted by 50% to take

account of the extent of the Claimant’s contribution to its own loss.

(b) August 2004 Loan

686. In the case of the August 2004 Loan, the Claimant had to make a decision on 19 August
2004, in light of the information then available, whether to enter into the Loan at all. In
terms of assumption of risk, this gave rise to a materially different situation to that which

had applied under the successive drawdowns of the December 2003 Loan in the course

of the second quarter of 2004, analysed above. The issue for the Claimant was now
whether, in light of the situation as it had developed, it was reasonably foreseeable that
any funds that it might decide to invest under this new Loan arrangement would be lost.
If this were so, the proximate cause of Claimant’s loss would be its own decision to invest

in light of such knowledge, which knowledge could break the chain of causation.

In making this assessment, it matters not that the events of August 2004 took place well
before the Yukos Oil bankruptcy proceedings and the Respondent’s measures against the
Claimant in those proceedings that have led to the Tribunal’s finding of expropriation in
this arbitration. This was precisely the position in Biwater'' and the other cases
discussed above.!!® The proximate cause of loss is the cause that is predominant or

operative, which may not be the most immediate in time.

For this purpose (as already noted) the Tribunal must assess the actions of the Claimant
vis-a-vis the August 2004 Loan as those of an investor choosing to make an investment.
This necessarily follows from its Interim Award, in which the Tribunal held that an intra-
group loan was to be treated as just as much an investment as any other and subject to the
same requirements. That is to say: by advancing the August 2004 Loan, the Claimant was
both making a contribution and assuming the ‘risk as to the success or failure of the
venture. At the point that the investor disburses funds under the loan to the venture, it is
committed to its success or failure. The investor has a stake in that venture. Its risk

materializes in a failure to repay. !!!°

The significance of the Claimant’s decision at this point is not to be underestimated. It is
only its investment that gives rise to this claim. Had it decided not to enter into the August
2004 Loan, the consequence would be that the sum of USD 355 million, which was the
subject of that Loan, would not have been paid into the territory of the Respondent. As a
result it would neither have been subject to the financial position of Yukos Oil as borrower

nor amenable to expropriation by the Respondent. They would have remained the

property of the Claimant. Conversely, a decision to invest these funds in an economic
activity in the energy sector in Russia by lending them to Yukos Oil made the fate of
these funds immediately subject to the financial position of Yukos Oil and placed them

on the territory of the Respondent and subject to the measures of its organs.

(v) At its Board meeting which approved the August 2004 Loan, Yukos Oil had
been advised that ‘in order to avoid bankruptcy, the Company would need, in

the nearest time, to stop paying VAT and the mineral extraction tax. 1415

(vi) The purpose of the Loan was stated to be ‘to satisfy a part of the 2000 tax
liabilities.’!"'6

On the other hand, there continued to be contrary indications, not least President Putin’s

public statement of 17 June 2004 that the Respondent had no desire to bankrupt Yukos

Oil. The Tribunal’s view, based on its assessment of the Respondent’s conduct to this

691.

date, is that little weight can be placed on this statement in light of the facts as detailed

above, !"!7

692. Considered from the perspective of a lender in the position of the Claimant, these events
plainly raise an imminent risk that Yukos Oil as borrower would be driven into
bankruptcy and that any sums advanced by way of loan would not be recovered in
accordance with their terms, but would have to be recovered, if at all, by way of a claim
in the bankruptcy. There is a risk inherent in advancing a loan to a business that has

announced that it may be bankrupted as a result of the actions of the State.

»

This still leaves the question of whether the events as they then existed were such as to
render it reasonably foreseeable that the Claimant’s investment would be lost altogether.
If this were so, it would break the chain of causation. This is not a question of fault on the
Claimant’s part. It is simply a question of what was reasonably foreseeable in light of the

facts as then known to the Claimant.

2004 Loan was made in a context in which ‘[a]t the time we were desperately trying to

entire company and that a negotiated resolution might be achieved.’ ''!® He accepted that
at the time the August 2004 Loan was advanced there was ‘probably more of a risk’ that
Yukos Oil might not survive, although it ‘continued to believe’ and ‘continued to
negotiate with the Russian Government for a global settlement.’!'!9 He pointed out that,
in April 2004, Yukos Oil had filed a case with the European Court of Human Rights,
because it had become apparent that the company was being treated improperly for

political reasons. ''?°

These statements amount to an acceptance that the August 2004 Loan was being advanced
in circumstances in which it was not merely foreseen that Yukos Oil as borrower might
be driven into bankruptcy, but that this was as a result of deliberate conduct on the part
of the Respondent, which was ‘intent on destroying the entire company.’ The
foreseeability of such an intention would affect the totality of the assets of the Yukos
Group on the territory of the Respondent.

Moreover, the chronology of events demonstrates significant involvement of the Russian

courts in this conduct:

application that the bailiffs enforce against its stake in Sibneft before

COMPENSATION
INTRODUCTION
In light of the conclusion that the Tribunal has reached on causation, the Claimant is in

 

principle entitled to ip ion from the Respondent for its loss ioned by the
expropriation of the sums advanced under the December 2003 Loan (but subject to an
apportionment of 50% in respect of the last three loans extended under that Loan
Agreement to take account of its own contribution to its loss). In view of its decision on
causation in relation to the August 2004 Loan, the Tribunal will disregard sums claimed

in respect of this Loan and the arguments of the Parties in respect of such sums.

The Tribunal must now proceed to determine the amount of compensation that is due in

respect of that loss.

In order to do so, it proceeds in the following five steps to consider:

(i) What is it that the Claimant has lost for which it is entitled to compensation?:
(ii) The valuation of that loss;

(iii) Whether the Claimant has already recovered any such sums, such that the

amount of compensation is to be reduced accordingly;

(iv) Interest; and

(vy) Costs.
NATURE OF Loss
1. The issue

The first issue that the Tribunal must consider in fixing the compensation due to the

Claimant is: what is it that the Claimant has lost for which it is entitled to compensation?

On this threshold issue, the Parties adopt diametrically opposite points of departure. The
issue that the Tribunal must resolve is whether that loss is to be determined by reference

to either:

Page 241 of 303

(i) The amount of the profit or gain that the Claimant expected to make on the Loan;

or

(ii) The total value of the Loan, comprising the principal advanced and any interest

due thereunder.

705. The point arises here in the specific context of the back-to-back arrangements in respect

707.

of the December 2003 Loan as between Yukos Capital and Brittany dated 20 November

2003 (the Brittany Loan Agreement).'!26 The Tribunal considered these arrangements

at length in its Interim Award. '!?7

|. Nevertheless, it expressly left open for the merits phase ‘the questions that arise from the

nature of these arrangements as to what loss the Claimant may have suffered in the event

that the Tribunal were to find in its favour on liability.”! as

As summarised below, the Parties addressed this question in their written pleadings.
Given its importance, the Tribunal also addressed the following question to them, inviting

their oral submissions in closing:

13: What is the ordinary rule as to the account that the Tribunal should take of the
means by which an investment was funded for the purpose of assessing its loss? And
then some subsidiary questions: What is the principle underlying this rule? Is any
such rule affected if the funder is a related party to the lender? Does the rule apply
in this case? And if not, why not?!"

2. Arguments of the Parties
(a) The Claimant’s position

The Claimant argues that its contractual arrangements with Brittany and Hedgerow can
raise no questions as to the extent of its loss.'"° It accepts that where a third party ‘has a
right of ownership in the investment, the compensable damage must be reduced to the
extent of that third party’s ownership right.’!!3! However, it submits that where a party
has debts and other obligations to a third party in relation to an investment, these cannot

affect the compensable damages to which the party is entitled. '!5?

In this regard, the Claimant contends that the Tribunal has already found in the Interim
Award that Yukos Capital is the owner of the Loans, and that neither Brittany nor
Hedgerow own any beneficial interest in them. ''3 It submits that this issue is res judicata,
arguing that the question of beneficial and legal ownership of assets or rights is a
substantive one, and cannot be limited to the jurisdiction phase of the case.''34 With
reference to the non-recourse or hedging arrangements in the Brittany and Hedgerow
Loans, the Claimant argues that those arrangements ‘restrict the manner in which the
liability to those lenders is to be discharged’, but do not extinguish Yukos Capital’s

liability. !!35 The Claimant applies the same analysis to the Respondent’s arguments

regarding ‘interest spread’, submitting that Yukos Capital’s funding arrangements can

have no impact on its right to recover the value of the Loans. hes

The Claimant also submits that any argument as to beneficial ownership is in fact a

jurisdictional objection to the Claimant’s status as investor. ''37 It contends that the

relevance of beneficial versus legal ownership ended when the Tribunal determined that _

the Claimant is the beneficial owner of the Loans for the purpose of qualifying as an

‘Investor’ under the ECT.'"8

(b) The Respondent’s position

. The Respondent submits that the Claimant has suffered no loss, as Yukos Capital is not

the beneficial owner of the Loans.'% While acknowledging that the Tribunal in its
Interim Award has determined that neither Brittany nor Hedgerow owned any beneficial
interest in the Loans, it submits that this conclusion is limited to the Tribunal’s decision
on jurisdiction and that the Tribunal has not yet decided that she Claimant was the
beneficial owner of the Loans or of the repayment flows thereunder. ''4° The Respondent
notes that the Tribunal left open for the merits phase ‘the questions that arise from the
nature of these arrangements as to what loss the Claimant may have suffered in the event

that the Tribunal were to find in its favour on liability.’ ue

The Respondent then contends that it is a fundamental principle of international law that
relief should only be granted to the owner of a beneficial interest, '"“? defining ‘beneficial

owner’ as a party ‘unconstrained by a contractual or legal obligation to pass the payment

received to another person.’''4 It argues that Yukos Capital was mandated to pass the
payments received under the Loans to Brittany and Hedgerow, with its role being that of
a ‘passive conduit’ of funds between those entities and Yukos Oil,''“* and therefore the
risk and the injury have been borne by a third party and not the Claimant.''*5 On this
basis, it submits that it is for the ultimate beneficial owners of the Loans to pursue claims

for damages, not Yukos Capital.!'6

Characterising the Loans as a means to facilitate tax evasion, the Respondent argues that
the Loans themselves had no value due to their lack of impact on Yukos Oil’s
consolidated balance sheet.''*? It contends that the value of these ‘intra-group loans’ was
included in the value of Yukos Oil, and has therefore already been taken into account in
the Hudley Final Awards.''*8 Since international law does not permit double recovery, it

submits that the Claimant should not be able to recover in these proceedings.'9

The Respondent submits that when determining loss, one must consider the economic
substance of the transactions and not the legal formalities recorded in the paper
documents.''5° In support of its contention that the Loans were no more than ‘paper
assets’, the Respondent refers to various instances where it submits that the Claimant and
Yukos Group treated the Loans as assets of little to no value—such as Hedgerow’s
di | of any prospect of repayment of the Hedg: Loan on 24 January 2005.5! It

also argues that the Claimant's inability to provide a consistent basis for estimating the

value of the Loans demonstrates their lack of value, referring to Yukos Capital’s financial
statements, the bankruptcy proceedings and the present arbitration, arguing that the values
ascribed to the Loans by the Claimant fluctuate in those instances between USD 0 and

USD 13.07 billion.''*? In light of the above, the Respondent submits that the Claimant

could not have genuinely considered the Loans to be of any real value."

715. Following its argument relating to the back-to-back nature of the Loans, the Respondent
submits that the maximum extent of Yukos Capital’s loss must be limited to the ‘interest
sptead’ between the December 2003 Loan and the Brittany Loan.!" It argues that such
damages have been claimed and awarded in cases involving non-recourse project
financing, based on the net cashflows of the project after non-recourse project financing
obligations have been discharged.''5 The Respondent calculates the interest spread to be
0.0625%, submitting that the Brittany Loan required Yukos Capital to pay Brittany the
principal under the December 2003 Loan as well as 99.9375% of the interest. ''% It
contends that 0.0625% of the interest under the December 2003 Loan is equivalent to

it has made an Investment to which the present dispute with the Respondent
relates'!5?

718. It has further held earlier in the present Award that the Respondent has breached

Article 13 ECT by expropriating the Claimant’s property in the sums advanced under the

December 2003 Loan.''©?

719. A property right of the Claimant. The consequence is that the loss for which the Claimant

is to be compensated is the loss of the Claimant’s rights in that property.

720, The Emmis Tribunal explained the relation between a claim of expropriation and the

721.

existence of a property right of the claimant in the following terms:

In view of the fact that the only cause of action within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is
that of expropriation, Claimants must have held a property right of which they have
been deprived. This follows from the ordinary meaning of the term. The Oxford
English Dictionary defines ‘expropriate’ as ‘(of the state or an authority) take
(property) from its owner for public use or benefit’/‘dispossess (someone) of
property’. Its origin is from the medieval Latin expropriat- ‘taken from the owner’,
from the verb expropriare, from ex- ‘out, from’ + proprium ‘property’, neuter
singular of proprius ‘own’ ,"'6!

It also follows from the basic notion that an expropriation clause seeks to protect an
investor from deprivation of his property that the property right or asset must have vested
(directly or indirectly) in the claimant for it to seek redress. This has been recognised by

many tribunals, for example:

(i) In Generation Ukraine v Ukraine," the Tribunal noted that since

‘expropriation concems interference in rights in property, it is important to be

meticulous in identifying the rights duly held by the Claimant at the particular

moment when allegedly expropriatory acts occurred.’

(ii) In Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.S. v Islamic Republic of

Pakistan,''® the Tribunal noted that the ‘first step in assessing the existence of

an expropriation is to identify the assets allegedly expropriated.’

ii) In Apotex v United States of America," the Tribunal rejected the claimant’s
argument that it had made an investment in the United States by applying for
regulatory approval for a drug that it claimed it would have been granted but for
the respondent’s alleged breaches. The tribunal held ‘the critical enquiry must

be as to the nature of the alleged “property” as at the date of the alleged breach

- not at some future point.” "65

Proper approach to valuation of that loss. The proper approach to be adopted to the
valuation of that loss was authoritatively expounded by the Permanent Court of

International Justice (PCIJ) in Chorzéw Factory when it ruled on the issues of

compensation following its finding that the factory had been expropriated:

On approaching this question, it should first be observed that, in estimating the
damage caused by an unlawful act, only the value of property, rights and interests
which have been affected and the owner of which is the person on whose behalf
compensation is claimed, or the damage done to whom is to serve as a means of
gauging the reparation claimed, must be taken into account. This principle, which is
accepted in the jurisprudence of arbitral tribunals, has the effect, on the one hand, of
excluding from the damage to be estimated, injury resulting for third parties from
the unlawful act and, on the other hand, of not excluding from the damage the amount
of debts and other obligations for which the injured party is responsible. The damage
suffered by the Oberschlesische in respect of the Chorzéw undertaking is therefore

equivalent to the total value-but to that total only-of the property, rights and interests
of this Company in that undertaking, without deducting liabilities."

This approach was approved by the ad hoc committee in Occidental Petroleum v

Ecuador, in which the committee explained its application in the following way:

It stands for the common sense proposition that in the calculation of damages for the
taking of assets

- debts and other obligations for which the injured party is responsible should not
be excluded, while

- injury resulting to third parties should indeed be excluded.

To give an example: if a State expropriates a piece of real estate, the mortgage loan
which served to finance the acquisition should not be deducted from the fair market
value; but if the investor before the expropriation had transferred a 50% share of the
property to a third party, the third party’s share | i the value of the investment must
be deducted from the claim for compensation."

The committee partially annulled the award in that case. It adopted the fundamental
distinction between (i) debts for which the injured party is responsible and (ii) injury
resulting for third parties that had been made by the PCIJ in Chorzéw.

Professor Stern had also applied that distinction in her partial dissent to the award. She

explained its rationale in these terms:

The plain text of the Chorzéw Factory dictum indicates that a distinction has to be
made, between rights belonging to a third party for which a claimant cannot assert
any claim and Jiabilities towards a third party which are a constitutive part of a
claimant’s entitlements. In order to distinguish the two, a good point of departure is
to state that a liability means that A (OEPC) is under an obligation to transfer
something to B (AEC), a transfer means that A (OEPC) has transferred something
to B (AEC). In other words, it is clear that the Chorzéw Factory dictum means that,
on the one hand compensation can only be granted to the owner of a right that has
been interfered with, and that on the other hand, if a right belonging to an owner is

burdened with a /iability this does not prevent its owner to receive full compensation
for its right."

726. The Tribunal considers that this approach is correct. Applying this approach, it means
that the Tribunal, in order to determine the Claimant’s property interest, for the loss of
the ownership of which it is to be compensated by the Respondent, must exclude any
rights belonging to a third party for which the claimant cannot assert any claim, but ‘not

exclude any liabilities of the Claimant towards third parties.

727. Application to the arrangements in the present case. Applying this approach to the facts
of the case requires the Tribunal to return to the nature and consequences of the back-to-
back arrangements between (i) Yukos Oil and the Claimant on the one hand; and (ii) the
Claimant and Brittany on the other. Although these arrangements were already set out in

the Interim Award, for clarity of exposition it is necessary to repeat them here.

728. The December 2003 Loan Agreement establishes a loan between Yukos Capital (defined

as ‘Lender’) and Yukos Oil (defined as ‘Borrower’). It provides in relevant part:

730. In its Interim Award, the Tribunal (by majority) analysed these transactions in the

following way:

504. What was the substance of this set of transactions? Undoubtedly, Yukos
Capital’s obligation to repay Brittany only arose if and to the extent that Yukos Oil
repaid its debt to Yukos Capital.'""!_As between Brittany and Yukos Capital, it is
Brittany that bears the risk of default associated with Yukos Capital’s loan to Yukos
Oil, in terms of Yukos Oil’s failure to pay and of Russian sovereign, foreign
exchange and tax risks.''” Brittany has no right of recourse against Yukos Capital
if and to the extent that Yukos Oil does not repay its loan to Yukos Capital.

505. Does this affect the substance of the transaction between Yukos Capital and
Yukos Oil? A majority of the Tribunal’s view is that it does not. The only person
that holds the right to claim repayment of the debt represented by Yukos Capital’s
Joan to Yukos Oil is Yukos Capital. It is Yukos Capital that advances the loans to
Yukos Oil under the Yukos Capital Loan Agreement. Yukos Oil’s undertaking to
repay those loans with interest is made to Yukos Capital alone.''”> Yukos Capital
does, therefore, have an economic interest in the Loans, since it is Yukos Capital that
holds the debt.

506. Those synallagmatic obligations between Yukos Oil and Yukos Capital are not
held by the latter on behalf of Brittany or any other third party. This conclusion is
confirmed by reference to both the Yukos Capital Loan Agreement and the Brittany
Loan Agreement. Brittany has no right to claim recovery of Yukos Oil’s debt. Yukos
Capital has not transferred that right — legally or beneficially — to Brittany. Brittany
does not receive under the Brittany Loan Agreement any right to Yukos Oil's debt
to Yukos Capital or any ability to pursue a claim against Yukos Oil in respect of that
debt. It merely limits its own rights of recovery vis-a-vis Yukos Capital by assuming
the risk if and to the extent that Yukos Capital is not repaid.

507. Nor has Brittany indemnified Yukos Capital under the Brittany Loan
Agreement against any loss that Yukos Capital may suffer as a result of default by
Yukos Oil under the Yukos Capital Agreement. The right to seek repayment — and_
to invoke Yukos Oil's tiability for nonfulfilment of its obligations''* — remains
solely held by Yukos Capital on its own behalf.

731. Inthe Interim Award, the Tribunal expressly reserved the question of the effect of these

arrangements on the extent of the Claimant’s loss (if and to the extent it were to find

liability).!""5 The Tribunal has therefore now revisited these findings in the light of the
legal test applicable to the nature of the loss to be compensated, as determined above,
namely the distinction between (i) a liability of the victim (which does not go to reduce
its loss) and (ii) the transfer of an ownership interest in the property to a third party (which

does).

732. The Tribunal finds that the effect of these arrangements is that it is the Claimant, and only
the Claimant, which owns the asset constituted by the sums advanced under the December
2003 Loan. There was no transfer of any ownership interest (legal or beneficial) from
Yukos Capital to Brittany. Rather, Yukos Capital simply retained a liability to Brittany
in respect of repayments that Yukos Capital received of the sums that Yukos Capital had

advanced to Yukos Oil under the Loans.
733. Comparing the two back-to-back loan agreements:

(i) Yukos Oil’s obligation to repay the Loans is an obligation owed to Yukos

Capital alone;!!7

di) Yukos Capital, and only Yukos Capital, has the right to make Yukos Oil liable
for failure to make due fulfilment of its obligations in accordance with Russian

civil law;!!77

(iii) Further, it is Yukos Capital, and only Yukos Capital, that has the right to demand

early repayment on account of the financial position of Yukos Oil'!'7 and to

demand penalty interest for late repayment. !!7°

734. Conversely, Brittany’s Loan Agreement is only with Yukos Capital and not with Yukos
Oil. Yukos Capital assumes a liability to repay Brittany under that Loan Agreement.!!8°

That is a liability that Yukos Capital owes as lender. The Brittany Loan Agreement does

not purport to and does not confer any ownership right upon Brittany in respect of Yukos

Capital’s property as constituted by its Loan to Yukos Oil.

735. Undoubtedly Yukos Capital’s obligations to Brittany are greatly qualified by the terms of
clause 5 (Hedge) in the Brittany Loan Agreement. These provisions qualify Brittany’s
right to obtain repayment of its loan to Yukos Capital in all of the events there listed,
which include both (i) Yukos Oil’s failure to repay Yukos Capital and (ii) sovereign risk.
These terms affect Yukos Capital’s borrowing risk. They do not qualify Yukos Capital’s
ability to seek repayment of its Loan from Yukos Oil. Nor do they negate the fundamental
risk that Yukos Capital assumed as a lender to Yukos Oil as to the success or failure of
the venture in Russia in which Yukos Capital was investing.''*' If anything, the limited
nature of Brittany’s rights vis-a-vis Yukos Capital under the Brittany Loan Agreement
serves to underscore the basic point that the property in Yukos Capital’s Loans to Yukos
Oil remains with Yukos Capital alone. A waiver granted by Brittany of its rights to
recovery from Yukos Capital does not affect the value of Yukos Capital’s asset,

represented by the sums advanced to Yukos Oil under the December 2003 Loan.''®?

736.

a

This conclusion is not affected by the limited nature of the profit that Yukos Capital was
projected to make under its Loan Agreement with Yukos Oil, as constituted by the spread
of 0.0625%, between the interest rate payable by Yukos Oil to Yukos Capital and the
interest rate that Yukos Capital was in turn obliged to pay to Brittany.

"182 Tn Yukos Capital’s 2004 Accounts (PH-44), the capital asset represented by the Loans are recorded in full on
the Balance Sheet (p.7) despite the notation at p.6 as to a contingent waiver on loans payable. For the same reason,
Yukos Capital’s 2019 release of Brittany (Letter from the Claimant to the Tribunal, 5 February 2019 (SFC-49)
cited at [816] below) does not affect the existence or enforceability of Yukos Capital’s Loans to Yukos Oil, as the
Dutch Courts have confirmed; [809]-[810] below.

the purpose of a claim of expropriation, is not limited to any profit that may be expected
to be earned on that property. The value of income flows may (depending upon the
valuation methodology adopted) be an input to the capital value of the property, but it is
not the value. To take a simple example, the value of a house is determined by its market
valuation as a capital investment. If the house were in use fora commercial purpose, the
income derived from that activity may be relevant to the value of the undertaking as a
whole. It would not make the capital value of the house legally irrelevant. In the event
that the house were expropriated, the victim’s loss for which the respondent would be

liable would include its loss of capital represented by the value of the house itself.

The position is no different where the victim’s property is the chose in action represented
by sums advanced by way of a loan, It is still the case that the claimant’s property is the
value of its capital interest in the sums advanced + any interest to be earned on that capital

and not the net profit alone.

The Respondent submits, in answer to the Tribunal’s Question N° 13, that, in determining
Joss, the Tribunal must look to ‘economic substance’ and to the ‘money flows’ and not to

the legal character of the Loans and the legal ownership of the Loans.''®°

In light of the Chorzéw Factory test enunciated above, the determination of the loss

cannot be idered in isolation from the ch and q) as a matter of law
of the arrangements between the parties. This is because it really does matter whether the
victim retains ownership of the property the loss of which is the subject of the claim, and
whether its relationship with a relevant third party is properly characterised as a liability

or as a transfer of beneficial ownership.

The Respondent’s valuation expert, Mr Knyazev, accepted as much in response to the
Tribunal’s question. Mr Knyazev had been asked in re-examination as to his opinion in

the event that a commercial bank had taken on the role of an intermediary in a back-to-

back arrangement with an identified party for onward lending.''®* Mr Knyazev accepted

that this type of arrangement occurred where ‘it’s a syndicate of Western banks coming

together and use a frontier agent lending money to risky operators in jurisdictions like
Russia.’!!85 The Chairman then asked Mr Knayzev:

[A]ssume a syndicate of banks that are lending into a frontier bank, and the frontier

bank, in turn, lends on such that its profit on the transaction is just its turn on the
transaction, but it, nevertheless, receives and pays as principal rather than agent.

MR. KNYAZEV: Yes.
CHAIRMAN McLACHLAN: What is your answer?

MR. KNYAZEV: Then I would say the value—the value of the front loan, they
should get the full value to satisfy obligations.

So it would economically, again, it would be linked because the frontier company,
acting as a principal, they still have these obligations to—if they diluted this, if there
is no precondition that they could lend—they could source funds from anywhere
without conditions, they I would say probably yeah, it would be the principal value
plus interest, yes, discounted, ''%6
742. The Tribunal has found that Yukos Capital did lend to Yukos Oil as principal and not as
agent. Its back-to-back arrangements with Brittany, by means of which the Loans were
funded, did not result in Brittany acquiring a property interest in Yukos Capital’s Loans
to Yukos Oil. Yukos Capital simply retained a liability to Brittany, the extent of which

was determined by the terms of the Brittany Loan Agreement.

743. Applying the test expounded in Chorzéw Factory and applied in Occidental v Ecuador,
the Tribunal excludes this liability from its calculation of Yukos Capital’s loss. Rather, it

to apply a discount from a valuation of principal plus interest. The Tribunal considers whether such a discount is

includes both the principal advanced under the December 2003 Loan plus the interest to

be earned thereon.

THE APPLICABLE STANDARD
1. The issue

The next question to be addressed is the standard that is to be applied to the valuation of
the loss of the property constituted by the principal and interest in sums advanced under
the December 2003 Loan. This question involves consideration of whether, in the
circumstances of the present case, there is a material difference between (i) a valuation
based on the Chorzéw Factory test for reparation wiping out the consequences of the

Respondent’s illegal actions and (ii) the fair market value (FMV) of the loans.

2. Arguments of the Parties
(a) The Claimant’s position

The Claimant advocates for a ‘but-for’ approach to reparation. While acknowledging that
Article 13 of the ECT provides for a specific rule of compensation for expropriation, the
Claimant contends that such rule does not cover reparation in case of a breach of
Article 13,1"87 in which event it submits that customary international law requires that the
Claimant be placed in the same position it would have been in had the wrongful acts not

occurred. !188

On the basis that the Respondent’s wrongful acts were its ‘destruction’ of Yukos Oil, or,
alternatively, its non-recognition of Yukos Capital’s claims in the bankruptcy
proceedings, |"? the Claimant submits that the appropriate reparation in this case would

include the principal amounts under the Loans, any unpaid interest, and pre-award interest

from the date that the principal amounts were to be repaid.'!%° It contends that while it is
entitled to choose the valuation date as either the date of the expropriation or the date of
the Award, the damages suffered at those dates is the same.'!! In any event, it clarifies

that it calculates damages as at the date of the Award.!!9?

pproach to the calculation of di where he that Yukos Oil engaged in tax

 

evasion and that the Tax Assessments were legitimate.''! The Claimant contends that

legitimate.'!

(b) The Respondent’s position

749. The Respondent submits that FMV is the appropriate measure of damages in the present
case, ''%° arguing that it applies where a claimant seeks damages for total loss of
investment, whether a loan or otherwise.''%” It defines the FMV standard as:

the price, expressed in terms of cash equivalents, at which property would change
hands between a hypothetical willing and able buyer and a hypothetical [willing] and
able seller, acting at arm’s length in an open and unrestricted market, when neither
is under compulsion to buy or sell and when both have reasonable knowledge of the -
relevant facts.'1%*

750. Referring to the Chorzéw Factory standard, the Respondent argues that the Claimant
makes no submissions on why that standard should prevail over FMV.''? It submits that
the ECT in Article 13(1) explicitly requires that the FMV standard be applied in cases of
expropriation, !”°° and contends that such standard should apply regardless of the nature
of the breach found by the Tribunal, since ‘there is no good reason to adopt different
standards for assessing damages payable under different treaty provisions, when the loss
alleged to result from those breaches... is the same.”!?°! It also seeks to distinguish the
application of the Chorzéw Factory standard on the basis that it is ‘not particularly

helpful’ in cases between States and private parties.'*°? Given that, in the Respondent’s

view, the Claimant has failed to establish the FMV of the Loans, it has failed to prove the

compensation it seeks and is therefore not entitled to monetary relief. '?°

751. As to the valuation date, the Respondent refers to Article 13(1) of the ECT, which
provides that the valuation date for FMV is ‘immediately before the Expropriation or
impending Expropriation became known in such a way as to affect the value of the
Investment’. '?4 It therefore submits that the FMV of the Loans should be determined at
17 July 2006, being the date on which Moscow Arbitrazh Court rejected Yukos Capital’s

First Bankruptcy Application. !2°°

752. Applying this valuation date, the Respondent contends that the FMV of the Loans is
zero. With reference to Mr. Haberman’s report, it submits that by 17 July 2006:
(i) Yukos Oil had been rated ‘Ca’ by Moody’s, which it contends suggests that loans to
Yukos Oil were ‘highly speculative and are likely in, or very near, default, with some
prospect of recovery of principal and interest’;!2°7 (ii) Yukos Oil had defaulted on both
of the Loans; (iii) Yukos Capital had issued notices of default in respect of both Loans;
(iv) Yukos Capital had written off the loan receivable balances in its financial statements
for both Loans; !?°8 and (v) Hedgerow had written off its remaining interest in the August

2004 Loan on the basis that it was ‘not recoverable’. '2°?

753. The Respondent disputes the Claimant’s calculation of the FMV of the Loans. First, it
argues that the Claimant has no case that the August 2004 Loan exceeded zero, since the

Claimant’s expert cannot demonstrate the commercial interest for that Loan.!?!° Second,

in relation to the December 2003 Loan, the Respondent submits that the expert’s

assessment that a willing buyer would not seek a discount on the December 2003 Loan is

‘farcical’ in light of the number of matters that would need to be overlooked to reach such

a conclusion, including ignoring the absence of lender protections and the absence of

financial information concerning Yukos Oil.'?'' In light of these factors, the Respondent

submits that a willing buyer would have sought a significant discount on the December
2003 Loan. !?!?

Referring to its allegations of tax evasion and money laundering on the part of Yukos
Capital, as well as Yukos Oil’s ‘massive hidden tax liabilities’, the Respondent submits
that true third parties would not be aware of such issues. On this basis, it argues that any
FMV analysis resulting in a value of more than zero would be predicated on ‘significantly
incomplete information’, and that an analysis that does not take this information into

account would likely overstate the Loans’ value. '2!3

Finally, in the event that the face value of the Loans is indeed the appropriate measure of
damages, the Respondent submits that the Claimant has failed to establish that ‘but for’
the Respondent’s acts, Yukos Oil would have been able to repay them.'?"* It contends
that there are a number of matters, such as alleged acts by the Respondent that are not
within this Tribunal’s jurisdiction or that do not amount to breaches of the ECT, that have
not been taken into account by the Claimant’s expert when assessing Yukos Oil’s
financial health.'?!5 It further submits that even if the Claimant can establish Yukos Oil’s
ability to repay the Loans, the inclusion of the ‘bad debt’ provision in the Hedgerow Loan

Agreement suggests that repayment of the Loans was not anticipated. '716

3. The Tribunal’s Analysis

756. The Parties’ written pleadings and experts’ reports suggested that there may be a material
difference between them as to the appropriate standard by which to determine the extent

of the Claimant’s loss, as between:
(i) The FMV standard mandated by Article 13 ECT; and

(ii) The full reparation standard contemplated by the Permanent Court of

International Justice in Chorzéw Factory.

757. In the end, in the light of the oral evidence of the experts and the closing submissions of
counsel, the Tribunal is satisfied that, on the facts of this case, there is no material

difference in the application of the two standards.

758. In order to explain why this is so, and the legal standard that must be applied in this case,

it is necessary to set out briefly the relevant formulations.

5

o

Article 13(1)(d) ECT provides that any expropriation must be:
..-accompanied by the payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation.

Such compensation shall amount to the fair market value of the Investment
expropriated at the time immediately before the Expropriation or impending
Expropriation became known in such a way as to affect the value of the Investment
(hereinafter referred to as the ‘Valuation Date’).

760. The PCIJ, in its classic dictum in Chorzéw Factory, expounded the following principle of

general application to reparations for a breach of international law:

The essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act—a principle
which seems established by international practice and in particular by the decisions
of arbitral tribunals—is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the
consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all
probability, have existed if that act had not been committed. Restitution in kind, or,
if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a
restitution in kind would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained
which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it—such

343945

Page 265 of 303

are the principles which should serve to determine the amount of compensation due
for an act contrary to international law. '2"”
761. The Claimant is quite correct to point out that Article 13 ECT provides a standard for
lawful expropriation, whereas the PCIJ was concerned with the legal test applicable to
unlawful acts, contrary to international law. This still leaves the question whether, in the

circumstances of this case, it makes a material difference.

762. The International Law Commission, which endorsed the Chorzéw Factory test in its
Commentary on Article 36 ARSIWA, '?'§ made the following comment on the
appropriate test for valuation of the compensation due:

(21) The reference point for valuation purposes is the loss suffered by the claimant
whose property rights have been infringed. This loss is usually assessed by reference

to specific heads of damage relating to (i) compensation for capital value; (ii)
compensation for loss of profits; and (iii) incidental expenses.

(22) Compensation reflecting the capital value of property taken or destroyed as the
result of an internationally wrongful act is generally assessed on the basis of the
‘fair market value’ of the property lost. The method used to assess ‘fair market
value’, however, depends on the nature of the asset concerned, Where the property
in question or comparable property is freely traded on an open market, value is more
readily determined. ... Where the property interests in question... are not the subject
of frequent or recent market transactions, the determination of value is more
difficult.,..'2"°
763. These observations are germane to the present case. The Tribunal draws two preliminary

conclusions:

(i) Whether in the case of a lawful expropriation or an unlawful breach of treaty,
the standard of compensation for the loss of the capital value of property rights
is FMV;

Page 266 of 303

(ii) The method used to determine the FMV of a capital asset will depend upon the
nature of the asset concerned, and in particular on whether the asset is ‘freely

traded on an open market.’

The World Bank Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment!””° (the
Guidelines) indicate that a range of different approaches to the determination of FMV
may need to be applied depending on the nature of the asset and the relevant
circumstances. The Guidelines distinguish between the valuation of: (i) a business that
had been operating as a going concern; (ii) an enterprise that it not a proven going

concern; and (iii) other assets. !22!

The Guidelines provide that ‘other assets’ may be compensated ‘on the basis of (a) the
replacement value or (b) the book value in case such value has been recently assessed or
has been determined as of the date of the taking and can therefore be deemed to represent
a reasonable replacement value.”!””? ‘Replacement value’ is defined to mean ‘the cash
amount required to replace the individual assets of the enterprise in their actual state as
of the date of the taking.’ !?2

Although the accounting experts differed greatly in the approaches adopted in their
respective reports, in the end, following cross-examination at the Hearing, the Tribunal is
satisfied that these differences arise from the nature of the assumptions that each was

instructed to make. They do not amount to a methodological difference.
Mr Rosen, the Claimant’s expert, confirmed that:

..-™my conclusion was consistent with fair market value, so in the end there really is
no difference between whether you took a Chorzow standard of valuation or implied

a fair market value standard of valuation. You would arrive at the same conclusion
as I did in my Report.!24

768. Mr Haberman, the Respondent’s first expert, addressed in his Report the approaches to

arriving at the FMV of a loan.'*5 He concludes that: ‘The DCF [discounted cash flow]

method... is the most relevant method to valuing loans.’ !?6 He observes that:

The cash flows from a loan are clearly defined as the loan interest payments due and
the return of the nominal value of the loan upon its maturity. The principal
uncertainties in valuing these cash flows are first whether they will actually be paid
and secondly whether the interest rate on the loan maintains a reasonable retum
relative to underlying interest rates. The discount rate takes account of this risk and
any other uncertainties, along with the time value of money.!227

769. Applying this approach to the December 2003 Loan, Mr Haberman opines that the interest

770.

rate of 9% was not commensurate with commercial borrowing rates otherwise applicable
in the Russian market and as a result that a commercial buyer of the Loan would discount
the value of the Loan from inception. '?8 The remainder of his risk analysis refers to the
effect of the Respondent’s actions on and after April 2004 on the value of the Loans. Mr
Haberman does not suggest that a discount to reflect the time value of money would be
applicable here, in circumstances in which the entirety of the Loan ought to have been

repaid in accordance with its terms prior to the present Award.

Mr Rosen agrees that ‘a commercial interest rate can be used to discount the interest and
principal payments to the issue date to calculate the FMV of a loan.” 229 However, he

advances expert evidence to the effect that ‘the loan interest rates of the Yukos Loans

Page 268 of 303

reflect a reasonable commercial interest rate. Therefore the FMV of the Yukos Loans is

equal to the face value of the Yukos Loans at each issue date.” !25°

771. Mr Knyazev, Respondent’s second expert, was asked by a member of the Tribunal to
address himself to the appropriate assessment of the value of the loans in the event that
he were (i) to exclude the allegations of fraud made by the Respondent and the back-to-
back structure and (ii) then assume that Yukos Oil retained the ability to call upon its
operating subsidiaries to obtain the cash required to fulfil its liabilities. '?3' His conclusion

in that event was: ‘it would then be book value, yes, plus interest, yes.” '25?

772. The Tribunal therefore approaches the valuation of the property interest of the Claimant
for which it is to be compensated as a result of the Respondent’s expropriation on the

basis that:

(i) It must assess the FMV of those loans (capital and interest) excluding any effect

on the value of those assets as a result of the Respondent's illegal acts; and

(ii) As it is valuing a loan and not a business, the appropriate valuation method is

likely to be the replacement or book value of that loan.

773. The Tribunal agrees that it is for the Claimant to prove its loss and that one cannot simply
assume that the FMV of a loan is equivalent to its face value. |? It has therefore carefully
examined the evidence adduced by the Claimant in support of its claim (which, on this
issue is principally found in Mr Rosen’s Second Report), along with the evidence for the

Respondent, given by Messrs Haberman & Knyazev.

774. As at the issue date, the Tribunal finds no evidence to suggest that a discount to the face
value should be applied. It accepts the evidence of Mr Rosen that the contractual interest

rate under the December 2003 Loan was equivalent to a commercial rate. Accordingly, a

Page 269 of 303

FMV assessed on the basis of a DCF analysis of the kind proposed by Mr Haberman
would, on the facts of this case (excluding the Respondent’s illegal acts) produce the same

outcome as replacement or book value.

In assessing the FMV of the December 2003 Loan but for the Respondent’s illegal acts,
the Tribunal rejects the Respondent’s submission that the correct valuation date is 17 July
2006, being the date on which Moscow Arbitrazh Court rejected Yukos Capital’s First

Bankruptcy Application, |74

The Tribunal has already found above that:

(i) The Respondent’s actions against the Claimant were part of an orchestrated
campaign against the Yukos Group as a whole, which ran from the first tax

reassessment in April 2004;

(ii) The Claimant itself accepts in its submissions that 26 May 2004 was a ‘key date’
since the decision of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court upholding the 2000 Tax

‘Assessment on that date gave rise to a dispute between the Parties. '75°

The Tribunal therefore excludes all of the actions of the Respondent directed against
Yukos Capital’s creditor, Yukos Oil, from its assessment of the value of the December

2003 Loan but for the Respondent's actions.

Once those matters for which the Respondent is responsible are excluded, the
consequence is that (subject to the adjustments made in Part VII above to take account of
the Claimant’s contribution to its injury and causation), it does not matter what the correct

valuation date is: the result will be the same.

There was some discussion with the experts at the Hearing, in part prompted by questions
from the Tribunal, as to the extent to which the Loans could have been traded on the open
market and the value or discount that might have been applied had the Loans been sold

or assigned. In the final analysis, the Tribunal has reached the view that this approach

would not provide a useful indication of FMV in this case. Yukos Capital advanced the
Loans on an inter-company basis for intra~Group financing. The Loans were not
structured as instruments to be traded on an open market, nor would examination of such
a market readily yield relevant comparable transactions from which an open market value

could be derived.

0. This does not mean that the Loans had no value, or must necessarily be discounted to take
account of the fact that they could not be easily traded. Provided that, but for the
Respondent’s conduct, the Loans (both as principal and interest) would have been timely
repaid in full by Yukos Oil as borrower, such that Yukos Capital bore no material credit
risk, the Tribunal finds that book or replacement value represents the correct valuation by

which to measure the Claimant's loss and there is no reason to discount that value.

The evidence demonstrates that Yukos Oil’s financial position in December 2003 and up
until 26 May 2004 was such that there was every likelihood that the Loans would have

been repaid in full:

i) In October 2003, Yukos Oil was rated Ba2 and BB by Moody’s and Standard &
Poor’s rating agencies respectively.'3° The Moody’s rating was the highest that
it had accorded to any Russian company in 2003, reflecting Yukos Oil’s high
quality proven reserves, strong production growth potential and low operating

cost base. !237

(ii) Yukos Oil had achieved strong operational performance and financial stability

for several years prior to April 2004.!238

(iii) Its EBITDA would, but for the Respondent’s actions, have amply supported the
projected loan interest payments on both the Yukos Capital Loan and its other

debt. '2°

{iv) World oil prices rose throughout the period in question from around USD 30 per
barrel to almost USD 80 per barrel in July 2006, reaching a maximum of over
USD 140 per barrel in 2008.'74°

(v) Yukos Oil’s total assets by year-end 2003 were approximately four times its total
debt (even after the December 2003 Loan and the giga-dividend). '4!

In the Tribunal’s view, these factors provide overwhelming evidence establishing that,
were it not for the Respondent’s actions, the financial position of Yukos Oil would have
been such as to enable it to repay Yukos Capital’s Loan in full and to continue to make
quarterly interest payments in accordance with its terms. A reasonable lender in the
position of Yukos Capital would have so concluded and valued the FMV of the Loan at

face value,

In these circumstances, the Tribunal has carefully examined the contrary expert evidence
of Mr Haberman for the Respondent, which was that the FMV of the Loans as at 17 July

2006 was ‘zero’, !242

The Tribunal finds that the reason for the difference between the experts is that
Mr Haberman takes into account for the purpose of his valuation a series of actions of the
Respondent against Yukos Oil and Yukos Capital between April 2004 and July 2006.24

Mr Knyazev adopts substantially the same reasoning in his subsequent report when he

concludes that by his valuation date of 17 July 2006 ‘Yukos Oil could not service its debts

and therefore the FMV of the Yukos Loans at this date was nil.’ '244

785. For the reasons already given, the Tribunal finds that these actions must be excluded in

order to arrive at a FMV of the December 2003 Loan for purposes of compensation.

786.

a

In light of all the evidence, the Tribunal therefore holds that the FMV of the December
2003 Loan for purposes of compensating the Claimant for the loss of its property is
equivalent to the amount of principal actually advanced, together with the interest
thereon, that was contractually due and remains unpaid. It finds no basis to apply a

discount.

: 787. By virtue of its decision on contribution in [685] above, the Tribunal has concluded by
majority'™ that the amounts of principal that are recoverable as compensation from the
Respondent in these proceedings must be reduced by 50% in respect of the final three
sums that were drawn down under the December 2003 Loan on 16 June 2004 (RUB
1,740,480,008), 22 June 2004 (RUB 870,114,000) and 28 June 2004 (RUB
1,306,089,000) respectively. '#° After deduction of 50% of these sums, the total amount
of the principal under the December 2003 Loan that is payable by way of compensation

in these proceedings is: RUB 77,342,764,401.89.

788. Under the terms of clause 2.4 of the December 2003 Loan Agreement, the Lender
undertook to repay all loans borrowed thereunder by no later than 31 December 2008

(unless the term of maturity were adjusted by mutual agreement in writing). '247

789. For reasons developed more fully below in relation to interest, the Tribunal accepts the

evidence of Mr Rosen that ‘it is reasonable that Yukos Capital would have transferred the

RUB-denominated cash flows into USD as it is the global reserve currency and a common
default currency for international financial activity.’ !4* The Tribunal adopts the maturity
date of the December 2003 Loan, namely 31 December 2008, as the date of currency
conversion. It has therefore applied the rate of exchange between Russian roubles and US
dollars as at that date specified in Mr Rosen’s Second Report, namely 29.40 RUB to 1
USD.'"9 Applying that rate, the sum due by way of compensation in respect of the

principal expressed in US dollars is USD 2,630,706,272.17.

Such compensation is, in the view of the majority,'**° applying the test of the PCH in
Chorzéw Factory, ‘a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind would
bear’, the payment of which is necessary to ‘reestablish the situation which would, in all
probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.’ '251 That is because (subject
to the deduction for contribution of Yukos Capital) such compensation represents the
capital value of the sums advanced under the December 2003 Loan, which is the asset of
the Claimant that was invested in Russia and taken by the Respondent without

compensation, '75?

PRIOR RECOVERY
1. The issues

The Tribunal must now consider whether the sums that it had found to be prima facie

r ble by way of cc ion for the R dent’s breach of treaty fall to be

reduced as a result of the Claimant’s prior recovery of the same loss either (i) as a result

of previous proceedings or (ii) by way of repayment.

2. Arguments of the Parties
(a) The Respondent’s position

792. As an objection to jurisdiction, the Respondent submits that the Claimant’s claims

constitute an abuse of process, because this arbitration represents the sixth attempt to

recover the Loan proceeds. !253

793. The Respondent submits that, in addition to the present proceedings, the ‘Yukos

Oligarchs’ have made numerous attempts to recover the Loan proceeds, namely:

(i) The payment of USD 0.9 billion via the giga-dividend in 2003;

(ii) The claims brought in the Russian bankruptcy proceedings;

(iii) The claims submitted by Yukos Capital to the European Court of Human Rights;
(iv) The Hulley Proceedings; and

(v) The Claimant’s initiation of ‘multiple and parallel’ proceedings in the District

Court of Amsterdam. !254

794. It contends that multiple pursuits of the same claim in different fora is tantamount to an
abuse of process, and that the doctrine of unjust enrichment is also engaged to prevent the

attempt to ‘sixtuple dip,’ !255

(b) The Claimant’s position

795. The Claimant submits that the value of neither of the Loans has been recovered.!?% It
contends that the initiation of proceedings in different fora to recover losses arising out

of the same factual matrix but based on different causes of action is not an abuse of

3. The Tribunal’s analysis
(a) Introduction

If it were to be the case that the Claimant had already been compensated for the totality
of its loss, or had already received an enforceable final judgment or award in its favour
against the Respondent on the same claim as it advances in the present proceedings, its

action in pursuing the present proceedings would be treated as abusive and liable to be

struck out. The first step is to analyse whether this is in fact the case, Even if an abuse of
process is not made out, the Claimant would still be liable to give credit to the extent that
it has already recovered all or part of the sums outstanding under the December 2003

Loan.

798. In analysing this question, the Tribunal must at the outset exclude from consideration

three of the Respondents alleged grounds:

(i) Yukos Capital claims in the Russian bankruptcy. The claims brought by Yukos
Capital in the Russian bankruptcy proceedings form the very gravamen of the
present proceedings. It is because no recovery of the Loans was achieved in
those domestic proceedings that the present claim is brought under international
law. It is axiomatic that a claimant cannot be precluded from pursuit of a treaty
claim by the very actions of the State organ that form the subject matter of its

claim.

(ii) Yukos Capital ECtHR claim. The claims of Yukos Capital before the ECtHR
were withdrawn at an early stage and have not been the subject of adjudication
by that Court.

(iii) The Hulley Proceedings. The Hulley Proceedings were brought by shareholders
in Yukos Oil and not by Yukos Capital. Following the Respondent’s application
to strike the Hulley Awards from the record in the present proceedings, the
Claimant confirmed that it placed no reliance on the binding effect of the Awards

in these proceedings. There has been no recovery under any of those Awards.
799. This leaves for consideration two grounds that do require closer examination:

(i) The giga-dividend. The first concerns the effect, if any, of the fact that USD 0.9
billion of the proceeds of the December 2003 Loan was applied towards the
payment of a dividend to the then shareholders of Yukos Oil;

(ii) The Dutch proceedings. The second concerns the potential relevance of
proceedings for the enforcement of the Loans before the Dutch courts and any

proceeds derived therefrom.

Page 277 of 303

(b) The giga-dividend

The Respondent claims that the portion of the proceeds paid under the December 2003
Loan that was used to fund a dividend payment to the shareholders of Yukos Oil must be
excluded from any compensation awarded to the Claimant in these proceedings because
the ultimate shareholders, to that extent, did not suffer a loss by virtue of the Loans,

having taken out the cash as dividends. '26°

The Claimant maintains that this is irrelevant, since the ‘Yukos Oligarchs’ as majority
shareholders were not parties to the Loans. It adds that in any event the majority

shareholders have disclaimed any interest in this proceeding. "7°!

The material facts in relation to the giga-dividend are not in dispute. They were canvassed
in the course of the evidence of Mr Misamore. '262 A Ithough there was an extensive debate
as to whether the payment of the dividend was or was not required for the purpose of the
Sibneft merger, Mr Misamore did not dispute the ultimate outcome. He confirmed, in
answer to a question from a member of the Tribunal that ‘the payment of the dividend did
one thing: It sent money out of the company.’ ' He then elaborated under cross-

examination from counsel:
Q. But the result of doing what you did was actually to get cash out of the Group.
A. Absolutely.
Q. And it would go—where did it go?
A. It went to all the shareholders.

Q. So, the shareholders, the majority shareholders received a very substantial amount
of cash as a result of this dividend?

A. They were the majority shareholders.
Q. Can you just answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ please.
A. Yes.

Q. You’re clearly not making some other refined answer. And, of course, the thing
about a dividend is, once you pay the money, it’s gone?

A. That’s right.2

Nor is it disputed that the present arbitration is pursued for the benefit of the same
shareholders: that is to say the former shareholders of the Yukos Group, who remain the
ultimate owners of Yukos Capital. The Claimant had placed some reliance on a letter
from the majority shareholders in which they disclaim their interest in any recoveries
from the present claim in favour of the minority shareholders.'265 But Mr Godfrey very
fairly accepted in cross-examination that the disclaimer of interest in this letter would be
revocable, !6 as did counsel for the Claimant in closing submissions in response to a

specific question from the Chairman. !76

The question for the Tribunal is whether the payment of that dividend is legally relevant
in considering whether Yukos Capital’s December 2003 Loan has been repaid in whole
or in part by Yukos Oil. The Tribunal is satisfied that it is not. The giga-dividend did not
go to reduce Yukos Oil’s indebtedness under the Loan, On the contrary, that debt
remained outstanding and unpaid. It was that debt that formed the basis of Yukos
Capital’s right to claim in the bankruptcy of Yukos Oil, a right that it was unlawfully

precluded from pursuing as a result of the actions of the Respondent,

By contrast, the dividend was paid by Yukos Oil to its shareholders. There is no evidence
that any part of the dividend was applied to reduce or extinguish the Loan or was

otherwise returned to Yukos Capital. The present Tribunal is concerned only with the

claim of Yukos Capital: the extent of its rights and its losses, if any. It cannot take account
of a dividend payment to Yukos Oil’s shareholders, whether or not some of those same

persons may ultimately benefit from sums recovered under the present Award.

806. The Tribunal therefore rejects the Respondent’s submission that the f of the giga-

dividend amounted to repayment of the Loan, rendering the present proceedings an abuse

of process.

(c) The Dutch proceedings

807. The relation of the Dutch proceedings to the present arbitration is somewhat complex.
Much of the relevant evidence was only elicited in the course of the Hearing as a result

of the Tribunal’s questions. This observation implies no criticism of the Parties, since a

number of the most material d in those pr dings occurred between the
close of the written pleadings and the Hearing. The Tribunal will first set forth the state
of the record in relation to the two proceedings that are relevant to the present claim as at
the date of the Hearing in the present arbitration (July 2019) before analysing their effect

on the quantum of the present claim. 268

of Yukos Oil.

809. The proceeding was initiated on 9 August 2007 before a provisional relief judge, while
the liquidation of Yukos Oil was still ongoing. On 30 June 2008 (after Promneftstroy had
acquired Yukos Finance) Yukos Capital demanded payment of the amounts pertaining to
the Loans from Yukos Oil. Promneftstroy intervened in that proceeding and requested
that the claims be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, on the basis that Yukos Oil had ceased
to exist. The Dutch Supreme Court ultimately resolved this motion on 13 November
2015, '?” rejecting the jurisdictional objections and ruling that Yukos Capital should be
given an opportunity to direct its claims against Promneftstroy (as the transferee of the

shares in Yukos Finance) before the District Court.

810. Yukos Capital proceeded accordingly. On 5 December 2018, the Amsterdam District
Court issued a judgment ruling, inter alia, that: (i) Yukos Capital’s claims pursuant to the
Loans were admissible; and (ii) Yukos Capital may take recourse against the shares in
Yukos Finance in payment of said claims. '27!

remained pending before the Amsterdam Court of Appeal.

In January 2019, the Dutch Supreme Court resolved this action on a definitive basis,
upholding the District Court’s original finding that Yukos Oil’s bankruptcy could not be
recognised in the Netherlands, meaning that Promneftstroy was not entitled to the shares

of Yukos Finance. '27?

The Parties' submissions. The Claimant submits that it brought the Promneftstroy action
to protect itself against a potential expropriation by the Respondent in the event that Dutch
courts were to recognise Promneftstroy’s ownership of Yukos Finance. However, since
Promneftstroy’s ownership was not recognised, it would no longer be necessary for

Yukos Capital to pursue its enforcement action against the shares in Yukos Finance. '?7*

The Respondent describes the Promneftstroy action as ‘an abuse of process’ and submits
that it evidences that the Loans have not been expropriated. It adds that the ‘Yukos
Oligarchs’, by having been granted ownership over Yukos Finance, ‘have been awarded.
full satisfaction for the Loans... against themselves’, or that, in any event, credit for the

value of Yukos Finance should be given in Yukos Capital’s claim.'””°

Extent of recoveries: The Claimant advised on 5 February 2019 that, following the ruling
of the Supreme Court in the Rebgun action:
Yukos Capital Ltd has redeemed the Brittany and Hedgerow Loans from Yukos
Hydrocarbons International Ltd. Thereby, Brittany and Hedgerow Loans were
terminated and Claimant is released and discharged from all obligations, claims, and
demands under these loans.'2”°
At the Hearing, Mr Godfrey explained that, after the Supreme Court judgment, it became
certain ‘who owned the Dutch structure’ because now ‘the beneficiaries of both these

structures are the same, [i.e.] the former shareholders of Yukos Oil.’ He stated that the

redemption of the back-to-back loans was done to create ‘a more tax-efficient

818. Yukos Capital paid a distribution of USD 625,022,889.04 to its shareholder Yukos
Hydrocarbons on 18 January 2019.'”8 Mr Godfrey informed the Tribunal that some

USD 100 million was still retained within the Dutch structure. 279

819. On the record before it, the Tribunal finds that the Dutch courts have ruled that Yukos
Capital retains a valid right to recover the proceeds of the Loans, enforceable against its
creditor Yukos Oil. It was this right that enabled Yukos Capital to take recourse against
Promneftstroy to the extent that the latter had received Yukos Oil’s property in the
bankruptcy (namely Yukos Oil’s shares in Yukos Finance).

820.

S

The Tribunal finds that Yukos Capital’s pursuit of its claim in the Promneftstroy action
in no way renders its pursuit of the present arbitration an abuse of process. On the
contrary, it is the gravamen of its claim before the present Tribunal that it was unlawfully
deprived of its ability to recover the sums extended under the Loans as a result of the
actions of the Respondent State. There is no inconsistency between such a claim and the
civil enforceability of the Loans against the creditor or those succeeding to the creditor’s
assets. There is no identity of parties or cause of action between the present arbitration

and the Promneftstroy action.

821.

Of course, if Yukos Capital did succeed in securing recoveries of the sums outstanding
under the Loans in the Dutch proceedings, such recoveries would go to reduce its loss in
the present proceedings and it would be bound to give credit for such recoveries
accordingly. The Claimant acknowledges this and is prepared to give an undertaking to
that effect. The Tribunal will record this undertaking in its dispositif,

Page 283 of 303

The remaining question is whether, as a the result of the Dutch proceedings or of Yukos
Capital’s January 2019 distribution to its shareholder, any part of the sums due under the

Loans has been recovered.

The Tribunal finds no evidence that this is the case. The Dutch Supreme Court ruled on
18 January 2019 in the Rebgun action that Promneftstroy did not own the shares in Yukos
Finance. As a result, such shares ceased to be an asset against which Yukos Capital could

enforce the Loans.

Further, there is no evidence that Yukos Capital’s distribution to its shareholder on the

same date represents the proceeds of any recovery of the Loans.
Conclusion. As a result, the Tribunal concludes that:

(i) Yukos Capital’s pursuit of the Dutch proceedings does not render its claim in

the present arbitration an abuse of process; and

(ii) There has been no prior recovery of the sums due under the Loans for which

credit must be given in the present proceedings;

(iii) However, should any such recovery be effected, the Claimant is bound to give

credit for it in its enforcement of the present Award.

INTEREST
1. The claim to interest

Thus far the Tribunal has been considering the basis for compensation of the Claimant
for the loss of its property in the Loans primarily by reference to the loss of the principal

sums extended under the December 2003 Loan and not repaid.

In addition to its claim for compensation in respect of the principal, the Claimant also

claims interest on the following basis:

(i) Contractual interest at the rate provided under the December 2003 Loan
Agreement, in the amount of USD 1,310,000,000; and

Page 284 of 303

(ii) Pre-award interest on each tranche of the principal and interest from the date on

which it would have been paid to the date of the Award. '28°

828.

9

In calculating contractual interest, the Claimant does not claim the penalty rate provided
for late payment in clause 3.2 of the December 2003 Loan Agreement. It submits that the
correct basis for calculation of its loss is the difference between the value of cash flows
that Yukos Capital received under the Loans, and the value of the cash flows that it would
have received but for the illegal acts. It assumes that, in a ‘but for’ scenario, Yukos Oil
as the creditor of Yukos Capital would have paid all sums due under the Loan in

accordance with its terms.!28!

829. The Claimant calculates pre-award interest on the basis of the RUB rate + 2% up to
31 November 2007 (when Yukos Oil was struck off) and thereafter it applies the 6-month
USD LIBOR + 2%. As at 31 December 2018, the Claimant calculates its pre-award
interest on this basis at USD 1,625,000,000.!282

830. The Respondent does not plead as to the correct approach to the award of interest. It relies
on its primary position that the value of the Loans on 17 July 2006 was zero, a position
that the Tribunal has rejected for the reasons given in Part VIII.C above. However, the
Respondent’s expert, Mr Haberman, does give evidence as to the rate to be applied to pre-

award interest, which the Tribunal considers below.

2. The Tribunal’s analysis
(a) Point of departure

831.

The Tribunal undoubtedly has the power to award interest. Article 26(8) ECT provides
that:

The awards of arbitration, which may include an award of interest, shall be final and
binding upon the parties to the dispute.

Page 285 of 303

832. The ECT provides no further guidance as to the basis upon which such an award of

833.

834.

835.

83

a

interest is to be made. Nor is there any such express provision in the UNCITRAL Rules

1976, which govern the procedure of the present arbitration.

Article 38 ARSIWA encapsulates the general principle applicable to the award of interest
for breach of an international law obligation:
1. Interest on any principal sum due under this chapter shall be payable when

necessary in order to ensure full reparation. The interest rate and mode of calculation
shall be set so as to achieve that result.

2, Interest runs from the date when the principal sum should have been paid until the

date the obligation to pay is fulfilled.
The Tribunal approaches the award of interest in the present case on the basis that it must
determine whether an award of interest is ‘necessary to ensure full reparation’ and, if so,
it has discretion to decide upon the rate and mode of calculation in order to achieve that

result.
(b) Issues of principle
The following points of principle arise:

(i) Contractual interest. Whether full reparation requires an award in respect of the

contractual interest due and unpaid under the December 2003 Loan.

(ii) Pre-award interest. What rate of interest should apply to pre-award interest: the
Claimant adopting a mixed Russian rouble and a USD LIBOR rate + a 2%

premium; the Respondent's expert proposing a Euro deposit rate. aes

(c) Contractual interest

. The Tribunal has already decided that the debt owed by Yukos Oil to Yukos Capital under

the December 2003 Loan constitutes a form of property. As it held in its Interim Award:

128 Haberman, [5.5]; Rosen 2, [119]-[134].

Yukos Capital v Russia
Final Award

Page 286 of 303

Such a debt is not purely, as Respondent submitted, a “claim[] to money... pursuant
to contract” under Article 1(6)(c) [ECT]. The debt will give rise to a contractual
relationship of debtor and creditor, the incidents of which are determined by
reference to the terms of such a contract. The debt also gives rise to a chose in action
that is an “asset” — a property interest of the “Investor.”

837. It noted with approval the following formulation of Douglas:

The provision of credit by the investor to an entrepreneur or enterprise engaged in
commercial activities in the host state qualifies as an investment. The investor
acquires rights to a debt, which can be assigned and thus has the feature of a right in
rem. Credit can take the form of a loan....

A loan is the payment of money by the investor to the debtor (an entrepreneur or
enterprise engaged in commercial activities in the host state) upon terms that the sum
advanced, with any stipulated interest, must be repaid by the debtor in due course.

A loan is the form of credit that features most prominently as an investment in the
corpus of investment treaty precedents, '2*°

838. The Tribunal reached the same conclusion in Part VIII.C.3 above when it considered the

nature of the Claimant’s property for the loss of which it is to be compensated, finding
that ‘where the victim’s property is the chose in action represented by sums advanced by
way of a loan... the claimant’s property is the value of its capital interest in the sums

advanced + any interest to be earned on that capital and not the net profit alone.’ !2%

839. Once the contractual interest payments are correctly analysed as part of the Claimant's
property interest in the sums outstanding under the Loan, its loss of those payments is to
be calculated by reference to the rate applicable under the December 2003 Loan
Agreement and as at the date when the interest payments would have been made, but for

the Respondent's actions.

Yukos Capital v Russia

Page 287 of 303

The Tribunal has considered whether it ought to make any adjustment to the contractual
interest rate, taking account of the fact that, being an intra~Group loan, the rate was
negotiated between related parties. However, the evidence is that the rate of 9.0%
applicable under the December 2003 Loan was in fact significantly lower than the average
interest rate on RUB denominated loans. The Respondent’s expert Mr Haberman
concluded that ‘banks in Russia were offering an average interest rate on one year RUB-

denominated loans to non-financial organisations of 12.4% at December 2003.’ '78”

In these circumstances, the Tribunal finds that the contractual interest due under the
December 2003 Loan that was not paid, and would have been paid but for the
Respondent’s actions, must be included as part of the Claimant’s property for the loss of

which it is to be compensated.

(d)_-Pre-award interest

The Tribunal considers that an award of pre-award interest is ‘necessary in order to ensure
full reparation.’ As a result of the Respondent’s breach of treaty, the Claimant has been
deprived of the use of its money since the relevant sums fell due under the December

2003 Loan Agreement.

The outstanding question between the Parties is the rate that is to be applied to pre-award

interest on the sums payable to the date of this Award.

Both Parties’ experts are agreed that pre-Award interest should be calculated on a
compound basis'® and that international rates are applicable for at least part of the

period. However, they disagree on the appropriate rate to be applied.

The Claimant adopts a RUB short-term interbank rate until 27 November 2007 and the

low as 0.32% in May 2014, arriving at 2.89% by November 2018. !289

846. The Claimant’s expert Mr Rosen, in his Second Report, offers an alternative calculation,
in which the debt would be converted from Russian roubles to US dollars as at the
maturity date of the December 2003 Loan, namely 31 December 2008.!2°° On this
alternative basis, he calculates a difference in compensation in respect of interest of USD
243 million, arising from the deterioration in the exchange rate of the Rouble to the US
dollar over that period. !9!

847, The Respondent’s expert Mr Haberman criticises the Claimant’s experts’ approach of

applying the Rouble interbank rate + a 2% premium on the ground that this would, at

some points, actually exceed the contractual rate.'29

848. He proposes conversion of the funds into Euros and adoption of a Euro-denominated
deposit rate, which yielded rates between 0% and 4%, but mostly at the lower end. He
does so on the basis that Yukos Capital reported in Euros. He provides a calculation of
pre-award interest on the spread (on the assumption that the Tribunal found the spread to

be recoverable without a discount).!2%

849. This gives rise to the following sub-issues for the Tribunal’s decision:
(i) The date of conversion;
(ii) Whether the debt is to be converted into US dollars or Euros;

(iii) Whether a deposit or a commercial lending rate is to be applied; and

Date of conversion. The December 2003 Loan was denominated in Russian roubles. The
Tribunal therefore considers that, in order to ensure full reparation, during the period until
the Loan was intended to be repaid in full, the amount of any interest should be calculated

by reference to the rates of interest applicable to Russian roubles.

The Tribunal determines that the appropriate date on which the outstanding debt should
be converted into another currency for the purpose of determining the interest rates
applicable thereafter is 31 December 2008. Mr Rosen very fairly accepts in his Second
Report that ‘this is also consistent with the Counterfactual Scenario in which Yukos Oil

was not dissolved in November 2007.’ 12%

The Tribunal agrees. It finds that, in order to calculate interest rates it must compare the
position that would have obtained but for the Respondent’s breach. This is what the
Article 38(2) ARSIWA mandates in providing that: ‘Interest runs from the date when the
principal sum should have been paid until the date the obligation to pay is fulfilled.’

US dollars or Euros? It is correct that Yukos Capital, as a company incorporated in
Luxembourg, reported its accounts in Euros.'?°5 Nevertheless, as an intra-Group finance

company, it carried its long-term loans in Russian roubles or in US dollars, 129°

The Tribunal therefore finds that a rate of interest for US dollars should be applied to the
sums outstanding after the redemption date of 31 December 2008.

Deposit or commercial lending rate? The Tribunal agrees with Mr Rosen that, as the
Claimant’s business was a commercial lender to other Group companies, the rate that

should be applied is one applicable to commercial lending and not to sums on deposit.

856. Moreover, the Tribunal accepts Mr Rosen’s evidence in reply that the Euro rates that
Mr Haberman had used were not rates actually available to Yukos Capital, since they
apply only as between registered commercial banks and the European Central Bank, and
that Mr Haberman had in fact erroneously applied the ECB Main Refinancing Operations
rate rather than the Deposit Facility Rate that he had stated he considered to be
appropriate. '2°” In rejoinder, Mr Knyazev corrects the rate to the Deposit Facility Rate,
but offers no response to Mr Rosen’s larger critique of the artificiality of using deposit

Premium? The Claimant’s experts add a 2% premium to the applicable rates. The only

justification that they provide for this is that this is ‘a modest spread.” '?%

858. As Mr Haberman points out, for some of the period in which the Rouble rates are to be
applied, the application of such a premium leads to a rate that would actually exceed the

9% rate contractually agreed. !3°°

The Tribunal cannot accept that this is ‘necessary in order to ensure full reparation.”

860. In fact, a review of the rates that Yukos Capital actually achieved on its long-term loans,
as reported in its Accounts, shows that its loans in Russian roubles were provided at fixed

rates, almost invariably of 9%. '3°!

Yukos Capital’s long term loans in US dollars were at margins of LIBOR + 1.00% —

Respondent shall pay interest up to the date of this Award at the rate of:

F. Costs
1. The legal framework

864. These proceedings are governed by the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules, Article 38 of which lays
down the following framework for the award of costs:

The arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in its award. The term ‘costs’
includes only:

(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator and to
be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with Article 39;

(b) The travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;
(c) The costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral tribunal;

(d) The travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent that such expenses are
approved by the arbitral tribunal;

(e) The costs for legal representation and assistance of the successful party if such
costs were claimed during the arbitral proceedings, and only to the extent that the
arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable;

(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the expenses of the
Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague.

865. Article 39(1) adds, as regards the fees and expenses of the Tribunal:

The fees of the arbitral tribunal shall be reasonable in amount, taking into account
the amount in dispute, the complexity of the subject-matter, the time spent by the
arbitrators and any other relevant circumstances of the case.

866. Article 40 provides in relevant part, as regards the allocation of costs:

1. Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in principle be
borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each
of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable,
taking into account the circumstances of the case.

2. With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in article
38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the circumstances of the
case, shall be free to determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion
such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable.

(iv)

At the conclusion of the Hearing on jurisdiction on 4 September 2015, the
Tribunal directed each Party to exchange submissions on costs on 5 October
2015 and comments on the other Party’s costs submissions on 19 October
2015;13°6

In the event, the Tribunal decided to order in its Interim Award that: ‘All costs
of and occasioned by the Hearing of these objections to jurisdiction shall be

reserved;’ 1307

Save in one instance, where the Tribunal was called upon to issue a procedural

order on a contested application it reserved costs; '*°8

In its PO N° 10 concerning the Respondent’s application for amendment of the

procedural timetable, the Tribunal decided, substantially dismissing the

 

lication, that ‘(t]he ble costs of and ioned by this application are
payable by the Respondent in any event upon the conclusion of the
proceedings.” 130?

(and those of the Assistant and Registry), the balance of the deposit held by the PCA is

EUR 105,410.64. This unused balance shall be returned to the Parties in equal shares.

Article 40(1) establishes a general principle that the above costs shall be borne by the
unsuccessful party, subject to the Tribunal’s discretion to apportion ‘taking into account

the circumstances of the case.’

In the present case, the Claimant has substantially prevailed on the majority of its claim.
The Tribunal finds no grounds to depart from the general principle in Article 40(1).
Accordingly, it shall make an order that the Respondent reimburse the Claimant for the

portion of the Tribunal and administrative fees and expenses advanced by the Claimant.

4. Costs for legal representation

Article 40(2) UNCITRAL Rules establishes a different rule with regard to the Parties’
costs for legal representation and assistance. It confers upon the Tribunal a free discretion

to determine which Party shall bear such costs or to apportion them between the Parties.

(a) The Parties’ submissions

In accordance with a procedural direction issued by the Tribunal and agreed with counsel
for both Parties at the close of the merits Hearing, the Parties were directed to file
simultaneous costs submissions by 27 September 2019, providing therewith itemised
schedules of the costs incurred, with liberty to file observations on the other Party’s costs
submissions by 11 October 2019. !3!7

. Both Parties duly filed costs submissions and schedules on the specified date. By
agreement between the Parties and the Chairman, the date for filing reply observations

was extended to 16 October 2019. Both Parties filed such observations on that date.

Both Parties invite the Tribunal to award costs of legal representation on the basis of the

costs follow the event principle, though they put this point in different ways:

(i) The Claimant accepts that the Tribunal has a discretion, but requests an order
that the Respondent pay the Claimant’s costs on the basis that ‘the successful

party should be able to recover its costs related to the claims upon which it was

successful’ in order to ensure full reparation.'?'

(ii) The Respondent argues that the costs follow the event approach is applicable to
costs of legal representation.'! {t invites the Tribunal to consider in addition

the Parties’ conduct during the dispute. '3?°

883. So far as quantum of costs is concerned:

@ The Claimant seeks USD 23,178,637.97. 32! This figure includes its
contributions to the deposit on costs in the amount of USD 1,398,675.00. The
Claimant’s total claim for costs of legal representation is therefore:

USD 21.779.962.97;

 

(ii) The Respondent seeks USD 11,732,489.64 for the jurisdiction phase and
GBP 18,708,206.08 for the merits phase. This latter amount includes its
contributions to the deposit on costs in the amount of GBP 681,224.39. Its total
claim for costs of legal representation is therefore USD 11,732,489.64 and
GBP 18,026,981.69. Converted at the exchange rate prevailing at 24 February
2021 for purposes of a purely indicative comparison, the Respondent claims
costs of legal representation in US dollars of: USD 37,127,389.64

132! This figure does not include the costs associated with the cancellation of the Hearing in Lausanne, for which
each Party paid EUR 10,213.74. As expressed in the Tribunal’s letter to the Parties of 27 May 2019, the Tribunal
considered that the Parties were ‘jointly and severally responsible for all costs thrown away and incurred as a result
of this late change of venue’. Having considered the Parties’ costs submissions and observations, the Tribunal
determines that each of the Parties shall bear its equal share of these costs. Accordingly, the Claimant’s request to

increase its claim for costs by EUR 10,213.74 is denied.

In both cases, the Parties include the expenses of witnesses (a separate category in

Article 38(d) UNCITRAL Rules) in their schedules of costs.

(b) Apportionment

The Tribunal considers that the Claimant has substantially prevailed on its claim, both as
to jurisdiction (by majority) and on the merits. Although the Tribunal has ultimately
excluded the August 2004 Loan from recoverable losses on grounds of causation, and
reduced the amount recoverable under the December 2003 Loan to take account of the
Claimant’s contribution to its own loss, it does not consider that these reductions alter the

basic point that the Claimant has succeeded in its allegation of expropriation.

The Tribunal has carefully considered the Respondent’s submissions to the effect that any
costs award should be reduced to take account of the Claimant’s conduct in the course of
the proceedings. The Tribunal does not consider that the Claimant wasted costs or
otherwise engaged in improper conduct in its pursuit of the claim, such that it should

reduce any award of costs by way of apportionment.

(c) Quantum
This leaves the quantum of costs to be awarded.

Article 38(c) UNCITRAL Rules requires the Tribunal to determine whether the amount

of legal representation costs is ‘reasonable.’

On any view, this has been a substantial dispute, which has been vigorously and

professionally litigated by counsel for both Parties.

One ly utilised in the of is to compare the
respective parties’ costs.'°?? On this measure, the Tribunal notes that the Claimant’s
claimed legal costs, though still very large, are much less than those claimed by the

Respondent.

891. The Tribunal has also considered the objections to specific items that Respondent raises

893.

895.

in its Observations as to: (i) the fees of Professor Shay, international tax expert; and (ii)

the fees of Lalive, a Swiss law firm.

Professor Shay. The Claimant seeks to recover USD 1,629,853.62 in respect of the fees
of Professor Shay for the merits phase of the proceedings (through his law firm, Ropes &
Gray). The Respondent objects that this amount is unreasonable as it: ‘exceeds the
cumulative costs of all 14 experts engaged by the Respondent by more than 30%; and the

cumulative costs of all of Claimant's remaining experts by more than 72%.” '373

The Tribunal considers that the fees of international tax experts may well reasonably
differ depending upon the jurisdiction in which they practise and whether they work ina
university or in a law firm. The question for the Tribunal is not whether such fees are
reasonable on a lawyer-client basis, but whether they are a reasonable expense to be
recoverable on a party-party basis. Looked at in this light, there is force in the
Respondent’s submission that Professor Shay’s fees are disproportionate to the fees of
other experts in the arbitration, including those giving evidence on tax matters. Further,
in the event, the issues on which Professor Shay primarily concentrated in his evidence
did not greatly assist the Tribunal in reaching its award. Taking all of these factors
together, and in the exercise of its discretion to determine reasonableness, the Tribunal
fixes the reasonable amount to be recoverable in respect of Professor Shay’s fee at

USD 800,000.00 and reduces the amount claimed accordingly.

Lalive. Second, the Claimant seeks USD 397,646.89 in respect of the costs of Lalive, the
well-known Swiss law firm. The Claimant’s itemised schedule of costs shows that these

costs were incurred in relation to the Respondent’s Set-Aside Application. !34

The Respondent objects that these costs do not constitute costs of the arbitral

proceeding. '325

896. The Tribunal agrees. The costs of opposing Russia’s Set-Aside Application before the
Swiss Federal Tribunal are not costs of the present arbitration and are not recoverable by

way of an award of costs by this Tribunal. These costs must be excluded from the amount

claimed.

representation to be payable by the Respondent at USD 20,552,462.46.

DISPOSITION
For the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal hereby DECIDES that:

(1) By taking the Claimant’s Loans without due process or compensation, the

Respondent expropriated those Loans in breach of Article 13 ECT;

(2) In view of its finding under (1) above, it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to
determine the Respondent’s liability for the Claimant’s alternative claims under

Article 10 ECT;

(3) The Respondent shall compensate the Claimant for its loss of the sums due under

the December 2003 Loan, save to the extent set forth in (4) below;

(4) The recovery of sums advanced under the December 2003 Loan after 27 May
2004 falls to be reduced by 50% in view of the Claimant’s contribution to its own

loss in respect of those sums (by majority McLachlan and Stern; Rowley dissenting);

(5) The Respondent is not under a duty to compensate the Claimant for its loss of
the sum advanced under the August 2004 Loan, as the Claimant caused its own loss
of that sum because it extended that sum at a time when it was reasonably
foreseeable that those funds would be lost (by majority McLachlan and Stern; Rowley

dissenting);

(6) The Respondent shall pay compensation for the Claimant’s loss of the value of
the December 2003 Loan (after the reduction for contribution referred to in (4)

above), comprising:

(i) Principal of RUB 77,342,764,401.89, converted to US dollars at the rate
applicable on 31 December 2008 (29.40 Russian roubles to the US dollar)
namely: USD 2,630,706,272.17;

(ii) Unpaid contractual interest at the rate of 9% per annum accrued quarterly
on sums drawn down under the December 2003 Loan from the day after

the date of drawdown to 31 December 2008, converted to US dollars on

Page 1 of 15

I. INTRODUCTION

1. Lam in agreement with large parts of the Award, including the findings establishing the
Respondent’s liability under the ECT. I also agree with the conclusion that Claimant is
entitled to compensation for its loss of the value of the December 2003 Loan in the
amount of USD 2,630,706,272.17, plus interest, as set out in [6] of the Disposition.
However, I consider that the Respondent’s liability to compensate the Claimant goes

beyond these amounts.

2. My difference with my esteemed colleagues concerns their conclusions that: (a) only 50%
of the sums advanced by Claimant after 26 May 2004 on the December 2003 Loan is
recoverable (because Claimant contributed equally to its loss); and (b) Claimant’s loss on
its August 2004 Loan is irrecoverable in these proceedings (because Claimant alone

caused its loss).
3. These conclusions are untenable.

4. — As regards the irrecoverability of the loss of the August 2004 Loan, there is no credible
legal support for the majority’s decision. No cases were cited in which an investor-state
tribunal has ever concluded that an investor is entitled to no compensation where (as here)
its loss would not have occurred in the absence of the impugned conduct of the host state.

This almost certainly means that there are no such cases.

5. The majority contends that “A finding that the proximate cause of the claimant’s loss is
his own actions has been dispositive in a number of cases, despite findings of culpability

on the part of the respondent.”!

6. These cases relied on for this contention are discussed below where I deal with the August
2004 Loan. However, they provide no support for the majority’s conclusion that
Respondent should be freed of its treaty obligation to compensate for its effective taking
of the August 2004 Loan. The cases cited all concern investments which became

worthless, or had been lost (either by reason of the investor’s own mistakes, mismanaged

or bad luck) before the relevant respondent state was alleged to have breached its treaty
obligation. In the only case where a treaty breach was actually found, it occurred only

after the investment had become valueless, thus causing no loss.

As regards the conclusion that Claimant contributed (to the extent of 50%) to the loss of
the advances it made under the December 2003 Loan after 26 May 2004, the majority errs
(as discussed below) by failing to take into account that, on the record before the Tribunal,
even if Yukos Oil were to face bankruptcy it would have had sufficient assets to repay
the December 2003 Loan absent Respondent’s unlawful acts against it and against

Claimant.

Put differently, even if the majority was correct to conclude that Claimant was negligent
in making the final three advances on the December 2003 Loan, that negligence was not

causative of its loss.

THE EFFECT OF THE MAJORITY’S CONCLUSIONS ON CONTRIBUTION/
CAUSATION

Before turning to the more detailed discussion of the majority’s contribution/causation
analysis of the two loans, the effect of the majority’s conclusions makes plain the

majority’s error.

In the case of the December 2003 Loan, RUB 3,916,683,000.00 was advanced after 26
May 2004 (drawdowns of 16, 22 and 28 June 2004). The effect of the majority’s 50%
discount on Claimant’s compensation for this component of its December 2003 Loan
enables Respondent and its designees to retain and be unjustly enriched by
RUB 1,958,341,500.00, or approximately USD 66,610,255. 10? of Claimant’s funds.

In the case of the August 2004 Loan of USD 355 million, the effect of the majority’s
holding that Claimant was entirely responsible for this loss enables Respondent and its
designees to retain and be unjustly enriched by the whole of the USD 355,000,000.00.

he same exchange rate as that set out at [789] of the Award is applied here, namely 29.40 Russian roubles to

Page 3 of 15

A conclusion that Respondent should not be held to its treaty obligation to compensate
Claimant for the taking of the entirety of its two loans and the associated contractual and
pre-award interest (i.e., to have its obligation to compensate Claimant reduced by at least
the principal sum of USD 421,610,255.10) cannot be correct in circumstances where
Claimant would almost certainly have been repaid in full had Respondent: (a) not sold
Yukos Oil’s YNG to Rosneft in a rigged auction for a fraction of its true worth in a
transaction that was acknowledged to be a practical nationalisation;? and (b) not treated

Claimant unlawfully in Yukos Oil’s eventual bankruptcy proceedings.

DID CLAIMANT “CONTRIBUTE” TO ITS INJURY IN RELATION TO THE
DECEMBER 2003 LOAN?

When performing a comparative contribution-to-loss analysis between an investor and,
in this case, as found, a state which (in its relevant treaty breaches) intended to destroy
the investor’s ability to recover its investment, a tribunal should be very sure that it does
not engage in hindsight as to what was foreseeable. In the case of doubt or uncertainty,
it is certainly proper to give the innocent investor the benefit of the doubt over a state that
has intended in its unlawful actions to injure the investor. A tribunal must also determine
whether the risk foreseen would have occurred in the absence of the host state acting

unlawfully. If not, the foreseen risk would not be causative of loss.

The majority’s holding that the Claimant should bear 50% of its loss in relation to the
three drawdowns that remained to be made after 26 May 2004 is based on the conclusion
that “there was a reasonably foreseeable risk that the Claimant’s investment might not be
repaid from 27 May 2004”.* This assessment of foreseeability was based on and limited
to the possibility that Yukos Oil might have to declare bankruptcy. No consideration was
given as to the prospects for Claimant to recover its loan in such a future bankruptcy. Nor
did the majority consider the foreseeability of any treaty breach by Respondent in relation

to Claimant’s December 2003 Loan, including its ability to recover its loan in a

hank di:

ptcy p jing absent any

yful action by Respond These

constitute a fundamental error. Finally, no real attempt was made to justify a 50% figure.

15. The majority placed much weight on the 26 May 2004 decision of one judge in the
Moscow Arbitrazh Court to uphold the first Tax Assessment (the 2000 Tax Assessment)
and Yukos Oil’s statement the next day, on 27 May 2004, that it faced the risk of
bankruptcy. It says that these facts “should have given a reasonable lender in Yukos
Capital’s position cause to consider whether it was prudent for it to continue to advance

loans under the December 2003 Loan Agreement.”°

16. At [683] of the Award, the majority states that “the Tribunal considers that the Claimant
was negligent in safeguarding its own interests as lender”, and at [684] it says that “[t]he
Tribunal considers that the Claimant’s failure in this respect equally contributed to this

part of the loss along with the Respondent’s subsequent breaches of the treaty.”

17. With respect, this is an untenable conclusion and outcome. The majority gave no
consideration to Claimant’s ability to recover its loan in any bankruptcy proceeding that
might be instituted. There was no suggestion that Respondent’s future unlawful acts

against Claimant could be foreseen. And the conclusion ignores the important facts that:

qj Yukos Oil had been advised in very plain terms by its outside lawyers that there
was utterly no merit in the 2000 Tax Assessment (discussed further below in

relation to the August 2004 Loan);

(ii) another judge of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court had, on 19 May 2004, suspended
the 2000 Tax Assessment, and that this suspension remained in force as at the
26 May 2004 court ruling;

(iii) even if Yukos Oil were to declare bankruptcy, at this stage of events (well before
Respondent’s unlawful behaviour in relation to the rigged YNG auction) Yukos
Oil had more than enough assets (details below) to pay the 2000 Tax Assessment

and any penalties should the assessment survive the challenge Yukos Oil had

launched against it;

(iv) on 17 June 2004, the day after Claimant made its next advance on the Loan,
President Putin made a strong statement (details below) that was evidently
designed to reassure concerned foreign investors that the Russian authorities, the
government and the economic officials of the country were not interested in

seeing Yukos Oil go bankrupt; and

(v) the last two advances on the December 2003 Loan were made (as required in the
Loan Agreement) during the week that followed President Putin’s widely
reported reassurance (i.e., on 22 and 28 June 2004).

18. On these facts, it must be wrong to conclude that Claimant’s decision to complete the
December 2003 Loan Agreement was negligent, let alone of sufficient risk as would
require Claimant to share equal responsibility with Respondent for its loss. It is true that
Yukos Oil was being subjected to reassessment by the Russian tax authorities on how it
had self-assessed its taxes for its 2000 and 2001 tax years. But this happens every day in
every country in the world and it is not negligent for counterparties to continue to deal
with companies who are facing tax audits. It is only negligent if the counterparty has
reason to believe there is merit in the audit and that its borrower will not be able to repay

a loan if, in the end, it is found that it has to pay the tax.

IV. OUGHT CLAIMANT TO BEAR THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE LOSS
OF ITS AUGUST 2004 LOAN?

19. Having assessed Claimant’s loss on a foreseeability/contribution based analysis for the
December 2003 Loan, the majority moves to a foreseeability/break-in-the-chain analysis
of the August 2004 Loan. That Loan was made on 19 August 2004, Jess than two months

after President Putin’s announcement and the date Claimant made its final advances on
the December 2003 Loan.

20. The relevant cases and the ILC (in its Commentary on ARSIWA) make it clear that it is
only proper to abandon a contribution-based analysis in favour of a break-in-the-chain

analysis where, on the facts of a particular case, it is clear that the investor’s loss was

incurred (or was inevitable) solely or predominantly because of its own conduct (or

improvidence) before its investment was affected by the impugned conduct of the host

 

state.

As noted above, no case was cited in which a tribunal has determined that an investor is
entitled to no compensation where its loss would not have been incurred in the absence

of the impugned conduct of the host state.

At [606] and [607] of the Award, reference is made to a number of cases in which other
tribunals are said to have concluded that the relevant investor caused its own loss (and
thus was entitled to no compensation from the relevant state) despite the fact that the state
in question has also been found culpable. The paragraphs wrongly suggest that these
cases are good precedents for the majority’s conclusion that Claimant should receive no

compensation for the loss of its August 2004 Ioan.

These paragraphs give the wrong impression as to the findings in the cited cases and what
they stand for. This is because, in each of these cases, the relevant investor’s loss: (a) had
accrued or become inevitable before the allegedly wrongful act of the state; and (b) no
part of the relevant investor’s loss flowed from or was made worse by any subsequent act
of the state. Thus, each of these cases is fundamentally different from the present case,
where the only reason Yukos Oil faced (and was ultimately driven into) bankruptcy and

Claimant lost its investments was the internationally unlawful acts of Respondent.

Put differently, Claimant did not make its August 2004 Loan to Yukos Oil when it was,
through its own fault or mismanagement, unable to repay the Loan. Yukos Oil only
became unable to repay, and Claimant only became unable to claim as a creditor in Yukos
Oil’s bankruptcy, because of multiple acts by Respondent in breach of the ECT, most of
which occurred after both the December 2003 and August 2004 Loans had been made.
The relevant factual chronology is set out at [46] below.

In this case, had Respondent not acted against Yukos Oil and Claimant as it did, Yukos
Oil would unquestionably have been able to repay both the December 2003 and the

August 2004 Loans and Claimant would have suffered no loss.

The cases cited by the majority in [606] and [607] are summarised briefly below. I
respectfully suggest that these cases do not support the conclusion that the loss suffered
by Claimant in relation to the August 2004 Loan was entirely or predominantly
attributable to its own conduct such that Respondent can properly be released of any

responsibility for its unlawful treatment of Claimant.

ELSI: In this case, the IC] Chamber concluded that, prior to the “requisition” (the
impugned act), ELSI was in an actual or virtual state of insolvency which had been
brought about entirely by reason of its own mismanagement of its business. In any event,
even though the requisition had no deleterious effect on ELSI’s business (indeed it likely
helped it), the Chamber was unable to see anything which could be said to amount to a

violation of the relevant Article of the FCN Treaty by reason of the requisition.’

MAFFEZINI v. SPAIN:® Here, the tribunal concluded that the losses suffered by
Mr Maffezini (i.e., as the result of the failure of his investment in Spain) were not the
result of allegedly wrong advice regarding the costs of the project given by a Spanish
state entity (one of four alleged breaches of the relevant BIT). Rather, the tribunal held
that the state entity was not carrying out a public function — hence Spain had committed
no BIT breach. It was in this context that the Tribunal observed that BITs were not
insurance policies against bad business judgements and that Spain could not be held
responsible for Mr Maffezini’s own business losses.” But this cannot be taken to suggest
that BIT’s do not constitute a form of insurance against the BIT state signatories’

contravening the treaty in its treatment of a qualifying investor.

OLGUIN v. PARAGUAY:"° Mr Olguin invested in a project in Paraguay. In so doing,
he lost the funds he deposited with a finance company when it went bankrupt. The funds

were being held on deposit pending their commitment to the project. Four allegations of

breach of the relevant BIT were made. The allegations, which concerned the lost deposit,
were all rejected by the tribunal. It held that the finance company went bankrupt because
of the irregular conduct of its managers, not by reason of unlawful conduct of the state.
While the tribunal noted that the finance company’s bankruptcy might have been
prevented had Paraguay’s financial regulators performed better, this did not amount to a
breach of the BIT, but simply reflected the rather lax regulation of financial institutions
in Paraguay at the time the investment was made. This obiter observation by the tribunal
was not a finding that the state was the cause of Mr Olguin’s loss. The tribunal also noted
that Mr Olguin had his reasons for investing in Paraguay and it was not reasonable for
him (an accomplished businessman, with a track record as an entrepreneur going back
many years, etc.) to seek compensation for losses he suffered on making a speculative, or
at best, a not very prudent investment. The key take-away from this case is that Paraguay
was found not to have breached the BIT in any way and that Mr Olguin had to bear the
same risks as anyone else who put money on deposit with a financial institution in

Paraguay at that time.!'

BIWATER vy. TANZANIA: This case is relied on by the majority in [607] and [608]
of the Award as being particularly apposite to the proposed finding that Claimant was
entirely or predominantly responsible for its loss in relation to the August 2004 Loan.
The opposite is true. The case concerned Biwater’s failed investment in rejuvenating and
operating the Dar es Salaam water and sewerage systems. Biwater alleged a series of
breaches of the relevant BIT that occurred between 13 May and 1 June 2005. While the
tribunal concluded that each of the alleged breaches was proven, the fundamental
difference between Biwater and the present case is that the tribunal also found on the facts
before it that Biwater’s investment had been such a bad one that, well before 13 May
2005 (the date of the first alleged breach of the BIT), the investment had become of no
economic value.'? That is to say, the state’s conduct had nothing to do with (i.e., had not

caused) the loss because the investment had been lost by the investor before the state

breached its treaty obligations.

By comparison, in the present case, it was not properly open to the majority to conclude
that the August 2004 Loan, when made on 19 August 2004, would not or could not be
repaid in the absence of Respondent’s unlawful conduct, and thus that Claimant caused

its own loss by making the Loan.

Although Russia’s Ministry of Justice announced its plan to sell YNG on 21 July 2004
(three weeks after the last draw down on the December 2003 Loan), Claimant had no
knowledge when it advanced the August 2004 Loan that the later YNG auction would be
rigged, and that YNG’s assets would be sold for a song. Had YNG’s assets been sold
properly, there would unquestionably have been sufficient funds to cover the August 2004
Loan. As to this, [139] and [140] of the Award set out details of the DKW valuation of
the seized YNG assets. That valuation also stated that, even if future tax and
environmental liabilities were accounted for, the value range would be between USD 15.7
and 18.3 billion. Respondent's later tax assessments (i.e., those that come after the loans
were advanced), would have reduced these amounts by less than USD 5 billion. It is to
be recalled that YNG was valued by Rosneft at USD 55.78 billion at the end of 2005 in
its prospectus for offering shares — i.e., after YNG had been acquired by it through the

rigged auction."

In addition, even though the possibility that Yukos Oil might have to enter into
bankruptcy proceedings in the future was known when the August 2004 Loan was
advanced, those bankruptcy proceedings were not commenced in Russia until March
2006, 18 months after the August 2004 Loan was advanced. 1s

Against this background, the only proper conclusion is that Respondent's unlawful
campaign against Yukos Oil and its unlawful acts against Claimant were the cause of
Claimant’s loss of the August 2004 Loan. The simple reason for this is that, on the

balance of the evidence, the Loan would not have been lost had Russia not committed its

campaign against Yukos Oil and expropriated Claimant’s investment. This is confirmed

by the Tribunal’s conclusion (by majority of McLachlan/Rowley), that the factors set out

in [781]:

.-provide overwhelming evidence establishing that, were it not for the Respondent’s
actions, the financial position of Yukos Oil would have been such as to enable it to
repay Yukos Capital’s Loan in full and to continue to make quarterly interest

payments in accordance with its terms. A reasonable lender in the position of Yukos
Capital would have so concluded and valued the FMV of the Loan at face value.'6

DID CLAIMANT “CONTRIBUTE” TO ITS INJURY IN RELATION TO THE
2004 LOAN?

Assuming the impropriety of a conclusion that Claimant’s loss of the August 2004 Loan
was “entirely attributable to [its own conduct] and not at all to that of the “responsible”
State [Russia]”,'” the question of whether it should bear some of its own loss (because it
contributed to it) turns on whether the dispute (i.e., arising from Respondent’s unlawful
treatment of Claimant) was reasonably foreseeable at the time the Loan was made on
19 August 2004. This is because, absent Respondent’s conduct which gave rise to the
dispute, Claimant could have claimed in the bankruptcy and would likely have been paid.

The questions concerning contribution that the Tribunal put to the Parties prior to their
closings all bore on the foreseeability of the dispute at the time Claimant’s investments

were made. !®

Claimant and Respondent agreed that the foreseeability of the dispute was relevant to the
[culation of d Respondent also pted that bility cannot be assessed
with hindsight.!9

The majority concludes that: (a) there was a foreseeable risk that Claimant’s investment

might not be repaid from 27 May 2004; and (b) it was reasonably foreseeable on

19 August 2004, less than three months later, that Claimant’s August 2004 Loan would

be lost altogether.
There are at least two problems with these findings.

First, they do not focus on the actual dispute (i.e., whether Respondent’s conduct vis-a-
vis Claimant, not Yukos Oil, constituted a breach of the ECT). Recall that the Tribunal
limited its assessment of ECT breach to Respondent’s treatment of Claimant’s claims
under the Loans and not the claims of its debtor Yukos Oil or other members of the Yukos
Group. And Claimant’s claims are limited to the treatment it received from Respondent
as it attempted to make its claims in Yukos Oil’s bankruptcy as a creditor based on the

Loans.”°

Second, the majority gives virtually no consideration in the Award as to the foreseeability
of that dispute. With the exception of one paragraph ([695]), at no point in Part VII does
the majority concern itself with whether it was reasonably foreseeable by Claimant, when
it made the two Loans, that Respondent would attack it, as it did, when it later sought to

register its claims in Yukos Oil’s bankruptcy.

Dealing briefly with [695], the majority asserts that, on the date that Claimant advanced
the August 2004 Loan (19 August 2004), it not only foresaw that Yukos Oil might be
driven into bankruptcy, but it also foresaw:

that this was as a result of deliberate conduct on the part of the Respondent, which

was ‘intent on destroying the entire company’, The foreseeability of such an

intention would affect the totality of the assets of the Yukos Group on the territory

of the Respondent.
With respect, this assertion can only be attributed to Claimant (or Yukos Oil) with the aid
of hindsight. It is now evident, from a detailed review of its behaviour over a three-year
period (2004-2007), that Respondent was then determined to eradicate the Yukos Group

after devouring its assets and distributing them to its favoured entities. But the record

before the Tribunal as to what was happening in the spring and summer of 2004 simply

does not indicate that this was known at the time.

The majority says that it does not matter that the August 2004 Loan was made “well
before the Yukos Oil bankruptcy proceedings and the Respondent’s measures against the

Claimant in those proceedings”.?! But with respect, it does matter.

Exactly what was happening and when is set out in useful detail at [114]-[153] of the
Award. In broad sweep, it shows plainly that at the time the two Loans were advanced,
what we now know was an unlawful campaign to acquire the Yukos Group’s assets was

only just getting underway.

The chronological data-points below (taken from the paragraphs cited above) show
clearly that Claimant had no reasonable basis, either in late May or in mid-August 2004,

to foresee either the present dispute or that either of the Loans would not be repaid.

(i) Only the first of the five Tax Assessments had reached a stage where Yukos Oil
had been found liable for tax offences when the August 2004 Loan was made.
The second Assessment (the 2001 Tax Assessment) came to a decision on such
liability only on 2 September 2004,” well after the two Loans had been made.

All the others come later.

(ii) Initially, after it received the 2000 Tax Assessment, Yukos Oil’s external
Russian counsel stated in robust terms that it was so unmeritorious, and the
extent of the tax ministry’s violations were so apparent that it would be
“impossible even for the most biased judge to support the clearly unlawful

inspection act.”

(iii) Although the tax ministry’s collection claim on the 2000 Tax Assessment was

upheld by one judge of the Moscow Arbitrazh Court on 26 May 2004, the effect

(i.e., the enforceability) of that Assessment had previously been suspended (by

another judge of the same court), and remained so until the suspension was
annulled on 23 June 2004.

{iv) On 17 June 2004, a day before an expected court ruling on the 2000 Tax

Assessment, President Putin was reported in the New York Times as saying:

Russian authorities, the government, and the economic officials of our

country are not interested in seeing Yukos go bankrupt... The government

will try to do everything not to topple this company.”>
The majority expressed the view, “based on its assessment of the Respondent’s
conduct to this date”, that “little weight can be placed on this statement”. Given
that this statement was made less than six months after the 2000 Tax
Assessment, and long before the rigged auction of YNG’s assets and the 2006
bankruptcy, the majority’s “view” can only be hindsight based. In any event, it
is well established that what governments say in these circumstances to and
about investors matters (and can have consequences) in the context of investor-
state disputes. It may now be a relatively common view that Mr Putin cannot
wholly be trusted. But that was not so clear in the summer of 2004. Moreover,
the fact that he made the statement on behalf of the government and the relevant
Russian authorities was clearly intended to calm roiling markets and to be

believed.

(v) The New York Times reported further that shares of Yukos Oil jumped 42% on
the news (of Mr Putin’s statement) before trading was suspended for the day and
gave details of settlement discussions between Yukos Oil and Russia. The
market’s reaction to Mr Putin’s statement was signalling the possibility of Yukos

Oil’s tax problems being resolved.

(vi) As mentioned earlier, on 21 July 2004, the Ministry of Justice announced plans

to sell the seized YNG assets. All of the valuations that were carried out at this

time indicated that the share capital of YNG well exceeded the then known and

future tax liabilities. Valuations ranged between USD 18.6-21.1 billion (DKW

valuation), USD 16,1-22.1 billion (JP Morgan valuation) and USD 20-25 billion
(possible bid range by TNK-BP).?6

(vii) The second to fifth Tax Assessments all occurred after the August 2004 Loan
was advanced.?? The rigged YNG auction took place on 19 December 200478
and Yukos Oil was petitioned into bankruptcy in March 2006.?°

47. The central point of the above chronology is that it shows that what Respondent was really

up to only became clear well after the two Loans were advanced.

48. On this record, I consider that it was not possible for the majority properly to conclude
either that Claimant was entirely responsible for the loss of the August 2004 Loan or that
it was reasonably foreseeable that a possible future bankruptcy proceeding against Yukos
Oil would result in the loss of the Loan (having regard to Yukos Oil’s and YNG’s net
asset values at this time).

49. On this record, it is my respectful view that finding that Claimant was entirely responsible
for the loss of the August 2004 Loan is perverse. It is equivalent to saying that if a state
is sufficiently likely to breach its treaty obligations, then, even if a particular treaty breach
against the investor itself cannot be foreseen, the state will be free to breach the treaty in
the future and be relieved of its solemn treaty obligation not to do so and to compensate
its investors if it does.

in Ripinsky and Williams, BYTs “do mitigate risks of certain government actions”.*° That

is to say, they do serve as insurance against behaviour prohibited by the treaty.

Page 1 of 19

INTRODUCTION

I am in agreement with large parts of the Award, as indicated in its operative part. My
main disagreement with my esteemed colleagues concems the way in which the majority
has considered the loss incurred by Yukos Capital, as a consequence of the violation by
the Russian State of its international obligations under the ECT. In my view, the decision
of the majority results in an unjust enrichment of Yukos Capital. It is quite striking for
me that the majority of the Tribunal has decided to award Yukos Capital significant
amounts of money which would never have been in its possession for more than a few
hours if the course of events had been ‘business as usual’, i.¢., if the Respondent had not

violated the ECT.

This unfortunate outcome results, in my view, from the fact that the majority has not
properly applied international law to the real economic facts of the case, but has instead
created a fiction by relying on accounting valuation exercises that it bases on an
incomplete and inaccurate picture of the economic business into which Yukos Capital
had entered.

In other words, Yukos Capital is now, with the Award adopted by the majority, in a much
better position than the one it would have been without the illegal acts of the Respondent

State: I do not think that this should be the goal of international arbitration.

* * *

I will only examine here the loss incurred by Yukos Capital as a consequence of the fact
that, under the December 2003 Loan, Yukos Capital did not receive some of the interest
due on its Loan to Yukos Oil and that the Loan to Yukos Oil was not reimbursed by the
latter. I will not deal with the August 2004 Loan, as I agree that it was made by the
Claimant at a time when it was foreseeable that it would not be reimbursed and that the
loss was therefore due to the deliberate decision of the Claimant to grant the Loan and

was not a consequence of any action of the Respondent.

5. I start from the premise that the December 2003 Loan! is an investment of Yukos
Capital, as was decided by the majority in the Interim Award, and that the question is
what, if anything, Yukos Capital has lost because of the actions of Russia. To be clear, I
remain of the view that this premise — as framed by the majority — is wrong, as explained

in my Dissenting Opinion annexed to the Interim Award, However, I want to explain here

that even if it is considered that there is an investment made by Yukos Capital, the loss is

very different from the one found by the majority.

6. This Opinion will therefore concentrate on the following question: What is the loss of
Yukos Capital?

7. Inorder to answer this crucial question for the decision on quantum, I will proceed in four
steps. First, the facts of the case and the law to be applied have to be clearly ascertained.
As far as the facts are concerned, I consider it unavoidable to look at the December 2003
Loan from Yukos Capital to Yukos Oil, not in isolation, as has been done by the majority,
but as an element of a global economic endeavour. As far as the law is concerned, it is
useful to restate the well-known general principles of international law concerning
compensation in case of a violation of international law by a State. Second, I will analyse
what would have been the situation if there had been no violation of international law, to
understand what was the potential profit derived by Yukos Capital from its investment
operation. Third, I will examine thoroughly what is the situation of Yukos Capital after
the violations committed by Russia, to understand what was its true loss. Fourth, I will
indicate what are, in my view, the main flaws, both factual and legal, of the majority’s

approach.

Ul. THE FACTUAL AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK
A. THE DESCRIPTION OF THE GLOBAL INVESTMENT OPERATION
8. Asa point of departure of my analysis, I insist that in order to evaluate the entitlements

of Yukos Capital, a holistic approach is necessary, analysing the Loan to Yukos Oil, in

" Loan Agreement between Yukos Oil Company and Yukos Capital S.a r.l. (2 December 2003) (December 2003
Loan Agreement) (C-9).

the general contractual framework of the other legal commitments with which they were

intrinsically linked.*

I indicate at the outset that this is a completely different situation from a loan made by
one company to another after having itself borrowed money from a bank, the two
operations being entirely distinct. A bank does not predetermine the use of the money by
its borrower, and, even more importantly, a bank will never accept not to be repaid if the

borrower is not repaid by the entity to which it happened to lend the money.

In fact, in what are called back-to-back loans, the Loan TO Yukos Capital preceded the
Loan to Yukos Oil and entirely predetermined all the conditions of the global deal, and
specifically all the parameters of the Loan FROM Yukos Capital to Yukos Oil.

The purpose of the overall contractual scheme put in place in 2003 must not be
overlooked: it was for Brittany, a BVI company, to lend money to Yukos Oil, a Russian
company, through the intermediary of Yukos Capital, a Luxembourg company at the time

of the events at issue in this case.

If we now look at the role of Yukos Capital in the back-to-back Agreements forming the
investment operation, we see that Yukos Capital undertook to grant a Loan to Yukos Oil:
this was the purpose of the December 2003 Loan Agreement.’ Since Yukos Capital had
no money of its own for this operation, it used money borrowed from Brittany: this was
the purpose of the Brittany Loan Agreement, dated a few days before on 20 November
2003.* This first Agreement already identified the final recipient of the funds, and it was
indicated in the Brittany Loan Agreement that the subsequent Loan from Yukos Capital
to Yukos Oil was going to be performed by what was called ‘Sub-Lending’ for the same
amount as the Brittany Loan:
(a) _ Borrower intends to provide a loan facility to OAO “NK “YUKOS” [Yukos

Oil], a company duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the
Russian Federation (hereinafter referred to as “Sub-Borrower”), such loan

Loan Agreement) (C-130).

15. The interest to be paid by Yukos Oil to Yukos Capital under what would become the
December 2003 Loan was also predetermined in the Brittany Loan Agreement, and was
set at 9%.® In other words, the money was going to flow from the Lender (Brittany) to
the Borrower (Yukos Capital) and then from Yukos Capital (now the Sub-Lender) to
Yukos Oil (now the Sub-Borrower).

16. The drawdown dates and the repayment dates of the December 2003 Loan were also

predetermined in the Brittany Loan Agreement:
Drawdown Date

Means the day when Borrower transfers funds to Sub-Borrower at the request of the
latter under Sub-Lending Agreement.

Final Repayment date

2™ January 2009, which date may be either accelerated or postponed by mutual
agreement in writing by the Parties hereto. Such Final Repayment date will not be
later than one Business Day after the date on which the Sub-Lending is redeemed.”

17. This indicates without the slightest possible doubt that the two legal instruments are to be
construed as a single legal operation. Indeed, the drawdown date of the Brittany Loan is
not the date when the funds are transferred from Brittany to Yukos Capital, as it should
be if it were an independent loan, but the date when the funds reach Yukos Oil through
the December 2003 Loan. Therefore, the interest to be paid on the Brittany Loan only
starts to accrue from the date when the December 2003 Loan is performed, which is
another way of saying that the money from Brittany accrued interest only when it reached

the final intended recipient, i.e., Yukos Oil.

18. In other words, the two Agreements are highly interlinked, as all the conditions of the
second Agreement were already determined in the first Agreement. In fact and law,
all the parameters of the obligation to dispose of the Brittany Loan to Yukos Capital in
order to transfer it to Yukos Oil were pre-determined in the Brittany Loan: the identical
amounts to be loaned, the rate of interest, the maturity date of the December 2003 Loan
to Yukos Oil (31 December 2008) and the linked maturity date of the Brittany Loan to
Yukos Capital (2 January 2009).

19. Therefore, it will be necessary to analyse these global contractual arrangements which

predetermine the economics of the loan transactions for the different actors involved, and

in particular to examine what economic interest Yukos Capital could draw from the

investment operation in order to ascertain what its possible loss could be.

However, before entering into this inquiry, it is appropriate to recall the international rules

on compensation in the event of a violation of international law.

THE UNCONTESTED PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW

I hesitate to restate the well-known approach to the standard of reparation in case of
damage caused by a violation of international law, which has been elaborated in the most
quoted Chorzéw Factory case, as reproduced in the Award in [760]:
The essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act ... is that
reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act
and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that
act had not been committed. Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment
of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind would bear; the
award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained which would not be covered by
restitution in kind or payment in place of it — such are the principles which should
serve to determine the amount of compensation due for an act contrary to
international law. '°

Of course, this theoretical approach has to be translated into figures; in other words, the

damages have to be quantified. This is why the PCIJ had decided to ask experts to value

the loss of the Oberschlesische, the company to which the Chorz6w Factory belonged:
[Xn order to obtain further enlightenment in the matter, the Court, before giving any
decision as to the compensation to be paid by the Polish Government to the German
Government, will arrange for the holding of an expert enquiry ... un

Unfortunately, the PCIJ never had to deal with the results of the expert enquiry, as the

parties entered into a settlement and the case did not go to the quantum phase.

As will be elaborated upon later, I consider that the majority has not properly applied

these principles and has not granted compensation that could, as far as possible, ‘wipe out

all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all

probability, have existed’ if the illegal act had not been performed.

In order to ascertain the reparation that can ‘re-establish the situation which would, in all
probability, have existed’ if the illegal act had not been performed, it is necessary to

develop but-for scenarios, which is now common practice in investment arbitrations.

The questions therefore are: first, what would have been the economic situation of Yukos
Capital, without the breach that the Tribunal did find (the but-for scenario), and second,
what is the economic situation of Yukos Capital, with the breach that the Tribunal did
find (the actual scenario). If there is a difference, this will be the damage supported by

Yukos Capital, all other circumstances being equal.

THE BUT-FOR SCENARIO: WHAT WAS GOING TO BE THE PROFIT OF
YUKOS CAPITAL?

In order to fully understand what Yukos Capital might have lost, it is necessary to
understand what it would have gained, in a situation in which there was no illegal act

performed by the Respondent.

THE POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES

The Claimant has argued that the Tribunal should apply a but-for approach when dealing
with the compensation to be granted to Yukos Capital. Its position is summarised in the

Award, in [745], in the following way:

The Claimant advocates for a ‘but-for’ approach to reparation. While
acknowledging that Article 13 of the ECT provides for a specific rule of
compensation for expropriation, the Claimant contends that such rule does not cover
reparation in case of a breach of Article 13, in which event it submits that customary
international law requires that the Claimant be placed in the same position it
would have been in had the wrongful acts not occurred. (Emphasis added)

While the Respondent preferred to base its analysis of compensation on the FMV, it
clearly acknowledged that, if the Tribunal were to apply a but-for analysis, the only

entitlement of the Claimant would be the interest spread:

PCA Case No. 2013-31

Yukos Capital v Russia

Award — Dissenting Opinion of Prof. Brigitte Stern
Page 8 of 19

Yukos Capital’s claim for damages is simply not met out on the “but for” or “Counter
Factual”, i.e., the situation that in all probability would have existed absent
Respondent’s alleged breach of the ECT. Yukos Capital would never have been
entitled to the value of the Loans in their entirety, but merely the interest rate
“spread” between ... the December 2003 Loan and the Brittany Loan ... ua

... Even Claimant’s preferred Chorz6w Factory standard is of little avail to it because
the but-for scenario only affords Claimant the spread between ... the December 2003
Loan and the Brittany Loan ... °

I will now analyse what would have been the situation without any breach by the
Respondent State.
THE REPAYMENT OF THE LOAN BY YUKOS OIL TO YUKOS CAPITAL

Here, two different scenarios were considered in the contractual scheme.

J. Main scenario: Yukos Oil pays the interest and repays the capital of the Loan
from Yukos Capital

As soon as Yukos Capital received the capital back from Yukos Oil, it undertook to

immediately transmit it back to Brittany:

3, Repayment

Borrower shall repay the amount outstanding within one Business Day upon
redemption of any part of Sub-Lending.“

This is the scenario that would, in all probability, have occurred in the normal course

of events, without a breach by the Respondent.

Page 9 of 19

2. Alternative scenario: Yukos Oil does not pay the interest nor repay the
capital of the Loan from Yukos Capital

The Agreements however also envisioned a less probable, but possible scenario. The

situation in which Yukos Oil would not fulfil its obligation to repay the December 2003

Loan was also foreseen in the Brittany Loan Agreement:
5. Hedge

Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt Lender shall bear all
risks associated with Sub-Lending, including, but not limited to the following:

(a) Failure to pay, which means the failure by Sub-Borrower to make, when and
where due, any payments under Sub-Lending Agreement;

(b) Sovereign risk, ...

(c) Foreign exchange risk, ...
(d) Tax risk, ...'°

This indicates that all risks, even if not mentioned in clause 5, were assumed by

Brittany.

As a consequence, if Yukos Oil did not reimburse the December 2003 Loan, it committed
a failure to pay, and the risk was not assumed by Yukos Capital, but by Brittany. This
means that, if the obligation of Yukos Oil to reimburse its debt to Yukos Capital was not
respected, the concomitant obligation of Yukos Capital to reimburse its debt to Brittany

was automatically cancelled.

In other words, the obligation of Yukos Capital to transfer the money back to Brittany
was without a sanction in circumstances where the obligation was not fulfilled due to the
non-fulfilment of its own obligation by Yukos Oil. This was indeed acknowledged in the

Undoubtedly, Yukos Capital’s obligation to repay Brittany only arose if and to the
extent that Yukos Oil repaid its debt to Yukos Capital. As between Brittany and
Yukos Capital, it is Brittany that bears the risk of default associated with Yukos
Capital’s loan to Yukos Oil, in terms of Yukos Oil’s failure to pay ... ue

The same understanding was reiterated by the President during the Hearing:

CHAIRMAN McLACHLAN: ... my understanding ... is that the effect of these
Agreements was that Yukos Capital was under no obligation to make a repayment
to Hedgerow and Brittany unless and until a repayment was made by Yukos Oil to
Yukos Capital, and that’s reflected in Clauses 3 and 5 of the Agreement. Is that your
commercial understanding of the structure here?

MR. GODFREY: Broadly speaking, yes.!7
HOW WAS THIS GOING TO WORK CONCRETELY?

In practical terms, what would have happened if the Agreements would have been

performed in the absence of a violation?

First step: Yukos Capital receives the money from Brittany under the Brittany Loan
Agreement. The interest rate for this Loan was 8,9375%. The second step was already
foreseen in this Agreement, including the interest rate at which Yukos Capital was going

to loan the money to Yukos Oil, which was 9%.

Second step: Yukos Capital has the obligation to transmit the money received from

Brittany to Yukos Oil.

Third step in the most probable main scenario: If Yukos Oil repays 9% interest to
Yukos Capital, the latter has to pay 8,9375% interest to Brittany, this operation being
made quarterly. In that case, Yukos Capital has earned the difference between the interest
rate in the December 2003 Loan Agreement and in the Brittany Loan Agreement: 9% -
8,9375% = 0.0625%, called the ‘spread’. If Yukos Oil was going to reimburse its
December 2003 Loan to Yukos Capital, the latter had to transmit the equivalent amount
of money within one business day to Brittany, which means that in the but-for scenario

Yukos Capital was not entitled to keep the property of the money lent.

Page 11 of 19

Third step in a possible alternative scenario: If Yukos Oil, for one reason or another,
does not pay the interest to Yukos Capital, the latter is not obliged to pay the interest to
Brittany, but has lost what it was entitled to receive as a profit resulting from its role in
the overall economic operation, i.e., the spread. If Yukos Oil, for one reason or another,
does not repay the amount of the December 2003 Loan to Yukos Capital, the latter is not
obliged to repay the amount of the Brittany Loan to Brittany, which means that in this

situation, Yukos Capital does not lose anything.

From the above, it is crystal clear that, in the but-for scenario, Yukos Capital was never
going to be able to obtain and retain the amount of the Loan for itself, as this situation

was not envisioned in the contractual scheme.

In conclusion, it is quite clear that, in the main and most likely but-for scenario,
what Yukos Capital would have received is the spread, all the spread, but only the

spread.

‘THE ACTUAL SCENARIO: WHAT IS THE LOSS OF YUKOS CAPITAL?

What did Yukos Capital lose because of the partial implementation of the global

contractual scheme, due to Russia’s actions?

THE LOSS AS PRESENTED BY THE CLAIMANT

The Award summarises the loss as presented by the Claimant, in [709], in the following

way:

With reference to the non-recourse or hedging arrangements in the Brittany and
Hedgerow Loans, the Claimant argues that those arrangements ‘restrict the manner
in which the liability to those lenders is to be discharged’, but do not extinguish
Yukos Capital's liability. The Claimant applies the same analysis to the
Respondent’s arguments regarding ‘interest spread’, submitting that Yukos Capital’s
funding arrangements can have no impact on its right to recover the value of the
Loans.

‘THE LOSS AS PRESENTED BY THE RESPONDENT

‘The Award summarises the loss as presented by the Respondent, in [715], in the following

Yukos Capital v Russia

Award — Dissenting Opinion of Prof. Brigitte Stern
Page 12 of 19

Following its argument relating to the back-to-back nature of the Loans, the
Respondent submits that the maximum extent of Yukos Capital’s loss must be
limited to the ‘interest spread’ between the December 2003 Loan and the Brittany
Loan. It argues that such damages have been claimed and awarded in cases involving
non-recourse project financing, based on the net cashflows of the project after non-
recourse project financing obligations have been discharged. The Respondent
calculates the interest spread to be 0.0625%, submitting that the Brittany Loan
required Yukos Capital to pay Brittany the principal under the December 2003 Loan
as well as 99.9375% of the interest. It contends that 0,0625% of the interest under
the December 2003 Loan is equivalent to USD 9.4 million.

THE LOSS OF YUKOS CAPITAL IN THE ACTUAL SCENARIO, AS I ANALYSE IT

Since the only thing that Yukos Capital would have gained — if the global contractual
scheme had been implemented according to its requirements and without any act of
Respondent in violation of international law is the spread, this is potentially also what

it was susceptible to lose.

In the actual scenario, the contractual scheme was implemented normally, without any
interference until 29 June 2004, which was the date of the last interest payment by Yukos
Oil to Yukos Capital.

Therefore, the spread was lost starting with the payment of interest which was due
quarterly between 29 June 2004 (the first missing spread being the one resulting from the
absence of the quarterly payment on 30 September 2004) and 2 January 2009 (the Final
Repayment Date of the Brittany Loan). In accordance with the conclusion as to causation
and contribution in the Award at [685], the amount of interest (and therefore of the spread)
is to be calculated on 100% of the sums drawn down before 26 May 2004, and 50% of
the sums drawn down after that date (namely the sums drawn down on 16 June 2004,
22 June 2004 and 28 June 2004).

Yukos Capital has therefore lost the difference between the interest rates on the

sums which have not been paid, i.¢., it has lost part of the spread.

The next question is whether in the actual scenario, Yukos Capital has also lost the
amount of the December 2003 Loan itself, as concluded by the majority. In the actual
scenario, as indeed in the but-for scenario, the role of Yukos Capital was to transmit the
reimbursement by Yukos Oil of the December 2003 Loan to Brittany. The fact that Yukos

Capital did not receive the reimbursement means only that it had nothing to transmit —
and thus lost the spread which was the price for the service rendered — but it lost nothing
else, and particularly not the amount of the December 2003 Loan, which it was not

entitled to keep.

In conclusion, if no other events had occurred in the actual scenario, the Tribunal should

have granted Yukos Capital part of the lost spread after 29 June 2004, and nothing more.

My analysis is confirmed by the relevant observation that Yukos Capital has, before this
arbitration, consistently acknowledged that it has suffered no loss. This is evidenced by
reference to two documents mentioned on Slide 115 of the Respondent’s Opening

Argument:

ai The first document is Yukos Capital’s financial statements for the period ending
on 31 December 2004:
Contingent Waiver of loans payable, interest payable and interest
expenses. The loans payable have a limited recourse and any losses on the
loans receivable are born by the lenders.'*
(ii) The second document is an email from Fred van Rouwendal to John Douglass
and others:
The loans you are referring to are back to back loans. From the relevant loan
agreements granted to YC Sarl, it becomes clear that the loans payable have
limited recourse on the related loans receivable. Any losses on the loans
receivable would not result in a loss for the company."
The same position was expressed even during the arbitration. Indeed, on 5 February 2019,
Gibson Dunn, counsel for the Claimant, wrote to the Tribunal that it no longer had any
claim under the Brittany or Hedgerow Loans:

Further to Claimant’s submission dated 1 February 2019, please be advised
following the judgment of the Dutch Supreme Court rendered on 18 January 2019 in

 

18 Yukos Capital Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2004 (PH-44), quoted in Respondent's
Opening Slides. 115, emphasis added by Respondent.

Promnefstroy et al. v Godfrey et al., (in which the Dutch Supreme Court confirmed
that the sham Yukos Oil bankruptcy could not be recognized as contrary to Dutch
public policy), Yukos Capital Ltd has redeemed the Brittany and Hedgerow Loans
from Yukos Hydrocarbons International Ltd. Thereby, Brittany and Hedgerow
Loans were terminated and Claimant is released and discharged from all
obligations, claims, and demands under these loans.”

57. This is stated by the Claimant, not the Respondent.

58. All these elements of the record tend to the conclusion, also reached by the experts of the
Respondent, that the loss of Yukos Capital, due to the non-reimbursement by Yukos Oil
of some of the interest and of the capital due under the December 2003 Loan, is equal to

zero.

59. This is corroborated also in Respondent’s Rejoinder on the Merits, {514]?!, in which the
Respondent emphasises the fact that the Claimant itself does not have a clear view of its
loss and attributes a zero value to the December 2003 Loan in its financial statements of
2005, 2006 and 2007:

The Loans lack of economic substance and therefore value is reflected by the fact
that Claimant has been incapable of advancing a consistent basis to estimate either

the value of the Loans or, in turn, the value of its loss. Claimant has variously valued
the Loans or its loss between $0 and $13.07 billion:

(a) $0, as the value attributed to the Loans in Claimant’s financial statements
including for 2005, 2006 and 2007;

(b) $4.3 billion and $4.8 billion (in April 2006 and October 2006 respectively), in
the bankruptcy proceedings of Yukos Oil;

(©) $13.07 billion (to 31 January 2013) in Claimant’s Notice of Arbitration;
(d)  $5.957 billion (to 27 October 2017) in Claimant’s Memorial on the Merits;

(e) $11.214 billion (as at 31 December 2017) based on the Loans “aggregated
gross value”, while simultaneously valuing them with a book value of $1; and

(f) $625 million, as the value that Claimant ascribed to the Hedgerow and
Brittany Loans when it discharged these in January 2019. (Which are the near
mirror images of the December 2003 and August 2004 Loans).

In sum, I consider that the most convincing conclusion is that the Claimant's loss is close
to zero, in view of all the circumstances of the case, but that in any case, Yukos Capital’s
loss cannot be more than a part of the lost spread. | consider therefore that the

conclusion reached by the majority is utterly wrong.

THE MAIN FLAWS IN THE MAJORITY’S APPROACH

In my view, the majority has disregarded both the factual situation and the applicable

legal principles.

THE MAJORITY HAS DISREGARDED THE FACTS IN RESPECT OF YUKOS’ GLOBAL
ECONOMIC OPERATION

I think that the main flaw in the majority’s approach comes from its continued analysis
of the back-to-back loans as if they were separate instruments, instead of taking into
consideration their evident linkage. The majority looks at only half of the picture, and

turns a blind eye to the other half.

It is because the majority refused to analyse the two contracts as a single legal operation
that they concluded that Yukos Capital has made an investment in Yukos Oil. Admitting
this, for the sake of reasoning, I consider that it is for the same reason — because the
majority refused to analyse the two contracts as a single economic operation — that the
majority concludes that Yukos Capital is entitled to receive the capital which it lent to
Yukos Oil, even though: (i) if it received the capital back from Yukos Oil, it was not
entitled to benefit from it for more than one day; and (ii) if it did not receive the capital

back from Yukos Oil, it was under no obligation to transmit the capital back to Brittany.

I need to answer here what looks like a common-sense remark by the majority, but is in
fact a complete fallacy in view of the situation of Yukos Capital. In order to justify that
the loss of Yukos Capital was not only its profit (the spread), the majority writes the
following in [737]:

Page 16 of 19

The valuation of property, which is the thing that is to be valued in determining loss
for the purpose of a claim of expropriation, is not limited to any profit that may be
expected to be earned on that property. The value of income flows may (depending
upon the valuation methodology adopted) be an input to the capital value of the
property, but it is not she value. To take a simple example, the value of a house is
determined by its market valuation as a capital investment. If the house were in use
for a commercial purpose, the income derived from that activity may be relevant to
the value of the undertaking as a whole. It would not make the capital value of the
house legally irrelevant. In the event that the house were expropriated, the victim’s
loss for which the respondent would be liable would include its loss of capital
represented by the value of the house itself.
What is missing here is that Yukos Capital had no right to keep the ‘house’ after the

maturity date of 2 January 2009.

Because the majority persists in analysing the two Agreements as if they were
independent of one another, it adopts some conclusions which I find fundamentally
wrong. This results in clearly inaccurate statements. For example, in [734], the majority
writes:

Conversely, Brittany’s Loan Agreement is only with Yukos Capital and not with

Yukos Oil.
Although this is formally correct if one looks only at the signatories of this Agreement, I
consider this statement substantially incorrect since the Brittany Loan Agreement
contains numerous references to Yukos Oil on its face. To be more precise, the Brittany
Loan Agreement includes within its four pages one reference to OAO “NK “YUKOS”
[this being Yukos Oil], as well as four references to the term ‘Sub-Borrower’, which is
defined as Yukos Oil. Furthermore, as was developed in the analysis of the factual
situation earlier in this Opinion, the terms and conditions of the Loan facility from Yukos
Capital to Yukos Oil are fully defined in the Brittany Loan Agreement, where it appears
under the term ‘Sub-Lending’, used 16 times. This means that there are 21 direct or
indirect mentions of the Loan from Yukos Capital to Yukos Oil in the Brittany Loan
Agreement, which, in my view, mandates reading the two Agreements together.
Thus, in fact (as well as in law), the December 2003 Loan from Yukos Capital to Yukos
Oil is actually governed by the Brittany Loan Agreement.

As will be seen later, this factual error has overwhelming consequences, as it is the first

pebble that paved the way to a flawed interpretation of the applicable law, by carving out

a right governed by two concomitant and entangled Agreements and treating it in an
independent manner so as to assign to it a value incommensurate with its expected

earnings.

As another of an i the majority iders that the Claimant
is entitled to pre-award interest on the sums granted, to take into account the profit it
could have made in using this money on the market, and grants therefore to Yukos Capital

a commercial rate of interest.

Such a decision brings into the light the flawed approach of the majority, as it grants to
Yukos Capital interest on a sum that it was only entitled to keep for one day (and that in
any case it would no longer possess from 2 January 2009), for a period stretching over
more than 12 years. This is an easy way to make unjustified profit and benefit from an

unjust enrichment.

THE MAJORITY DISREGARDED THE UNCONTESTED PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL
LAW

I consider that the majority, while purporting to apply the Chorzéw Factory principles,
manifestly applies its own interpretation of these principles. More precisely, the majority
deliberately ignores the situation that would have existed in all probability without the
breach even though it refers to Chorzéw, which clearly indicates that the reparation has
to reinstate the situation that would have existed without the breach. Once again, I quote
the basic principle stated by Chorzéw, already quoted above:

The essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act ... is that

reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act

and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that

act had not been committed.
It should be noted that this sets out a very general principle, which has to be given higher
standing than the consequences it may have in terms of accounting practice, these being

dependent on the particular circumstances of a case.

In the present case, by considering the December 2003 Loan from Yukos Capital to Yukos
Oil as an asset of its own, and not as a part of a set of two entangled Agreements, the

majority creates a situation that could never have happened, not even with the

slightest probability, in the normal course of events. Indeed, the Brittany Loan Agreement
provides that:
Borrower shall repay the amount outstanding within one Business Day upon
redemption of any part of Sub-Lending.”*
Thus, the majority’s approach amounts to a pure fiction, in which Yukos Capital is
awarded the amount of the December 2003 Loan to Yukos Oil, while its obligation to
repay its own debt is extinguished, or at least remains unsettled. This is inconsistent with
the obligations of Yukos Capital, and is exactly where the issue of unjust enrichment

arises.

As was explained above in my analysis of the but-for scenario, the overall value of Yukos
Capital cannot exceed the potential gain that this company could expect from its business,
ie., the spread, possibly updated by some discounting formula following modern
valuation theory. In other words, if Yukos Capital had been on sale, a willing buyer would

have offered a sum of an order of magnitude close to the value of the spread.

To support what I view as a fiction, the majority, unable to root its decision in general
principles of international law, relies extensively on accounting practice rather than law,
using valuation rules and discussing whether the FMV and the full compensation
principle of Chorzéw are equivalent. It gives a positive answer to this question, finally
concluding in [786]:
In light of all the evidence, the Tribunal therefore holds that the FMV of the
December 2003 Loan for purposes of compensating the Claimant for the loss of its
property is equivalent to the amount of principal actually advanced, together with
the interest thereon, that was contractually due and remains unpaid.
The actual issue — blurred in the reasoning of the majority — is not whether an accounting
technique such as FMV correctly translates the legal principles of Chorzéw, but whether
Chorzéw can dictate, in the circumstances of the present case, an amount of compensation
that is several orders of magnitude higher than the actual value of Yukos Capital, based

on its potential earnings. As explained in this Opinion, the answer is no.

In conclusion, I continue to consider that Yukos Capital was not an investor whose
investment was the Loans, as developed in my Dissenting Opinion annexed to the Interim
Decision on Jurisdiction. However, even assuming the majority were right and accepting,
for the sake of legal discussion, that Yukos Capital was an investor engaged in an
investment activity, I consider that, at the stage of quantum, the majority has completely
disregarded the reality and the true nature of Yukos Capital, whose role as an investor
was to render a financial service, i.e., to pass through sums of money from one company
of the Yukos Group to another, for a profit consisting only of the spread. Moreover, as
explained above, it has not applied the proper law to these distorted facts, engaging in
accounting exercises of valuation foreign to the relevant international law principles.
With the Award rendered by the majority, Yukos Capital will now receive the amount of
a loan which it was never entitled to keep, and be able to reap interest at a commercial
rate for 12 years, meaning, as mentioned at the outset of this Opinion, that Yukos Capital

will benefit from an unjust enrichment.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

By letter dated 23 May 2008, the Claimant “notified the Russian Federation, through the
Russian Ministry of Justice, of its claims under the ECT, accepted the Russian
Federation’s offer to arbitrate and invited the Russian Federation to engage in settlement

discussions.”

On 22 August 2008, the Ministry of Justice informed the Claimant that receipt of the

notice was not within the Ministry’s competence.

On 27 August 2008, the Claimant forwarded the notice to the Government of the Russian

Federation and to the Administration of the President of the Russian Federation.>

By Notice of Arbitration dated 15 February 2013 (“Notice of Arbitration”), the Claimant
initiated arbitration proceedings against the Russian Federation pursuant to Article
26(4)(b) of the ECT and the 1976 Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission
on International Trade Law (the “UNCITRAL Rules”).4

By its Notice of Arbitration, the Claimant notified the Respondent of its appointment of
Mr/J. William Rowley QC as the first arbitrator. Mr Rowley’s address is 20 Essex Street,
London WC2R 3AL, United Kingdom.

By letter to the Claimant dated 30 May 2013, the Respondent appointed Professor Brigitte
Stern as the second arbitrator. Professor Stern’s address is 7 rue Pierre Nicole, 75005

Paris, France.

On 8 October 2013, the Claimant requested that the Secretary-General of the Permanent
Court of Arbitration (the “PCA”) act as the appointing authority with regard to the
appointment of a presiding arbitrator, pursuant to Articles 6 and 7 of the UNCITRAL

Rules. In its submission, the Claimant stated that the Parties were “in agreement as to the

2 Notice of Arbitration (15 February 2013) (“Notice of Arbitration”), para. 31.

3 Notice of Arbitration, para. 31; Letter from Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP to the Government of the Russian
Federation, including attachments (27 August 2008) (Exhibit C-103).

* Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on Intemational Trade Law, 1976, GA Res. 31/98. The
Notice of Arbitration purported to invoke the revised 2010 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, but it was accepted by
the Parties and recorded in the Terms of Appointment of the Tribunal that the 1976 rules were applicable: Terms
of Appointment (17 February 2014) (“Terms of Appointment”), para. 4(a).

employment of the list-procedure referred to in Article 6(3) of the 1976 Rules ..., but

wish for the list to be provided by the Secretary-General to include at least five names.”5

On 9 October 2013, the PCA proposed to the Parties the use of a modified list procedure,
allowing each of the Parties to eliminate a maximum of three names from a list of seven
and requiring each Party to rank by preference the remaining names. On 15 October

2013, each of the Parties agreed to the PCA’s proposal.

In a letter of 4 November 2013, the PCA implemented the modified list procedure,
sending each Party a list of seven candidates who could be appointed as Presiding
Arbitrator, and, in separate letters of 19 November 2013, each Party submitted comments
to the PCA regarding the list of candidates.

On 22 November 2013, Professor Campbell McLachlan QC was appointed as Presiding
Arbitrator by the Secretary-General of the PCA. Professor McLachlan’s address is
Victoria University of Wellington, School of Law, Old Government Buildings, 55
Lambton Quay, Wellington, New Zealand.

By 18 February 2014, both Parties and all Tribunal members had signed the Terms of
Appointment, confirming that: (a) the members of the Tribunal had been validly
appointed in accordance with the ECT and the UNCITRAL Rules; (b) the proceedings
shall be governed by the UNCITRAL Rules; (c) the Tribunal shall determine the legal
seat of the arbitration in Procedural Order No. | after hearing the Parties on the issue; (d)
the language of the arbitration shall be English; (e) the International Bureau of the PCA
shall act as registry; (f) the issues in dispute shall be decided in accordance with the ECT
and applicable rules and principles of international law; and (g) the arbitral proceedings
shall be held in private and all documents in these proceedings created for the purpose of
the arbitration as well as all other documents or evidence produced by either Party shall

be confidential, unless the Parties expressly agree in writing to the contrary.

On 31 March 2014, each Party submitted arguments regarding the Tribunal’s
determination of the seat of the arbitration. The Respondent proposed Vienna, Austria or

Frankfurt, Germany, but indicated that it would also support the designation of Geneva,

that such provisional application is not inconsistent with its constitution, laws or

regulations””;$

(ii) “[t]he intra-company loans allegedly made by Claimant to Yukos Oil Company are

not ‘investments’ within the meaning of Article 1(6) ECT”;? and

(iii) “[s]ince Claimant is a shell company with no substantial business activities in
Luxembourg and is ultimately controlled by nationals of a third State, Respondent
is entitled to deny Claimant the advantages of Part III of the ECT pursuant to Article
17 ECT."

y. Russian Federation (PCA Case Nos AA 226, 227 & 228, 30 November 2009),
exhibited in this arbitration as CL-9, CL-26 & CL-27. Both Parties have pleaded as
to the relevance of those Decisions for the issues of jurisdiction presently before this

Tribunal.

It has come to the Tribunal’s attention from the public record that on 20 April 2016
a District Court sitting at The Hague in action nos C/09/477160 / HA ZA 15-1,
/09/477162 / HA ZA 15-2 and C/09/481619 / HA ZA 15-112 rendered judgment
in proceedings challenging these Awards (together “The Hague District Court
Judgment”).

The Tribunal invites the Parties’ observations as to (i) the admission of The Hague
District Court Judgment into the record in the present proceedings; (ji) whether, if
admitted, the Parties would wish to be heard on its relevance (if any) to the
proceedings in the present case and (iii) if so, in what form they would wish to be
heard. The Parties are requested to file their preliminary observations on these
questions by Spm (CET) on Monday, 30 May 2016.""

29. In response:

(a) By email of the same date, the Claimant replied, suggesting that “the fact that
neither party has sought to introduce [The Hague District Court Judgment] into
the record of this proceeding speaks for its relevance.” In the event that the
judgment were to be introduced into the record on the application of the
Respondent, the Claimant submitted that its relevance could be addressed in

submissions not exceeding three pages.

(b) By letter dated 23 May 2016, the Respondent made certain observations on The
Hague District Court Judgment and requested that it be admitted into the record
and taken into account by the Tribunal in its award. The Respondent expressed
the opinion that it was not necessary for the Parties to be further heard on the

relevance of the judgment.

(c) By letter of 24 May 2016, the Claimant advised that it did not object to the

Capital to its subsidiary, Yukos International UK B.V. (“Yukos International”), another
Dutch company. Yukos Finance then delivered its shares in Yukos International (in
exchange for depository receipts) to a Dutch foundation, Stichting Administratiekantoor
Yukos International (the “Stichting”). Accordingly, the Stichting wholly owns Yukos
International and, through it, Yukos Capital.'7 The structure and operation of the
Stichting is relevant to the Respondents third objection to jurisdiction, and is discussed

in that context below.

35. The purpose of this restructuring, according to the Claimant, was to protect Yukos Oil’s
foreign assets from being confiscated by the Russian State. Yukos Oil was dissolved in

2007 at the conclusion of bankruptcy proceedings in Russia,’

36. At the core of the present dispute are two loans that the Claimant extended to Yukos Oil
in December 2003 (the “December 2003 Loan”) and August 2004 (the “August 2004
Loan” and, together with the December 2003 Loan, the “Loans”). The Claimant alleges
that those loans constitute an investment, and that, by various acts attributable to it, the

Respondent expropriated that investment.'?

37. The Respondent relies, inter alia, on Yukos Capital’s financial statements and affidavits
as well as witness statements of former Yukos Oil and Yukos Capital executives to assert
that the Claimant “essentially acted as an ‘intermediary’” by receiving the funds for the
December 2003 Loan from Yukos Oil subsidiaries solely for the purpose of making loans
to other Yukos Oil subsidiaries, and that the Loans were part of a “tax-efficient dividend

repatriation strategy.””° It is on the basis of this characterisation that the Respondent rests

IV. LEGAL PROVISIONS RELEVANT TO THE DISPUTE

38. The Tribunal shall apply substantive law in accordance with Article 26(6) of the ECT,

Vv. OUTLINE OF THE PARTIES’ SUBMISSIONS
A. THE RESPONDENT’S SUBMISSION

40, The Respondent contends that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear Yukos Capital's

claims. The Respondent bases its argument on three grounds:

(i) Arbitration of the present dispute is inconsistent with the Russian Federation’s
“constitution” and “laws” for purposes of Article 45(1) of the ECT, and,
accordingly, the obligation to provisionally apply the ECT did not extend to Article
26; the arbitration agreement on which the Claimant seeks to rely is “null and

void?:2?

Yukos Capital has not made an Investment protected under Article 1(6) of the ECT,
because the purported Loans were in substance dividends designed to repatriate to
Russia the profits of Yukos Oil’s Russian trading subsidiaries, in which Yukos

Capital played no meaningful role and should be “disregarded”;?? and

The Respondent is entitled to deny the Claimant the benefits of Article 17 of the
ECT because the Claimant is a shell company with “no substantial business
activities” in Luxembourg and is controlled by nationals of a third state, namely the

United States nationals who are members of the Stichting’s board.”

B. THE CLAIMANT’S SUBMISSION

41. The Claimant submits that the Tribunal should reject each of the Respondent’s objections

to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, arguing as follows:

(i)

ii)

In relation to Article 45(1), the Claimant makes three independent submissions:
first, a signatory may avoid provisional application only where the principle of
provisional application itself is i i with d ic law — Article 45(1) does

 

not contemplate a “piecemeal” comparison of specific provisions of the Treaty with
domestic law: second, provisional application is not inconsistent with Russian law
because the executive had authority to commit the Respondent to provisional
application of Article 26 (and that renders it consistent with Russian law); third,
even examined on a piecemeal basis, Article 26 — the arbitration of investment

disputes — is not inconsistent with Russian law26

‘The Loans qualify as “Investments” under Article 1(6) of the ECT;”” the Claimant
rejects the argument that they fail a test derived from “general international law” as

to what qualifies as “investment.””*

(iii) The Respondent’s attempt to invoke Article 17(1) cannot give rise to a jurisdictional
challenge, since the Respondent would only be entitled to deny the benefits of Part

II of the ECT (whereas Article 26 is found in Part V);”° the Claimant submits that

the Respondent's purported invocation of Article 17 after the arbitration had been
commenced could not operate retrospectively to deny the Claimant accrued rights;>°

and that the Respondent cannot make out the two substantive requirements of the

Article.

42, The Respondent requests that the Tribunal:

VII. THE OBJECTIONS TO JURISDICTION

44,

45.

46.

47.

48.

The three objections raised by the Respondent to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal raise
distinct points of substance. Each one of them would, if held to be well founded, operate

to exclude the jurisdiction of the present Tribunal over the whole of the Claimant’s claims.

Pursuant to Article 21(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, “[tJhe arbitral tribunal shall have the
power to rule on objections that it has no jurisdiction, including any objections with
respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration clause or of the separate arbitration
agreement.” This provision reflects the concept, fundamental to international arbitration,
of compétence-compétence, namely that an international tribunal has jurisdiction to rule

upon its own jurisdiction.

In view of the distinct character of each of the objections, the Tribunal shall proceed by
considering each in turn, setting forth the Parties’ arguments followed by its own analysis

and decision.

A. DOES THE PROVISIONAL APPLICATION OF THE ECT IN THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION,
PURSUANT TO ARTICLE 45 OF THE ECT, PROVIDE A BASIS FOR THE TRIBUNAL’S
JURISDICTION?

The first of the jurisdictional objections for the Tribunal’s determination is whether
Article 45 provides a jurisdictional predicate for the present claim, and in particular
whether the proviso to Article 45(1), which provides for provisional application “to the
extent that such provisional application is not inconsistent with its constitution, laws
or regulations” (the “Domestic Law Inconsistency Clause”) excludes the provisional

application of Article 26.

The Parties’ first point of disagreement concerns the scope of that clause. The Claimant’s
case is that a respondent state may only rely on that limitation where the principle of
provisional application itself is inconsistent with the state’s “constitution, laws or
regulations”: the limitation is “all-or-nothing.” Since the Respondent does not deny that
Russian law recognizes the principle of provisional application (albeit subject to limits),
the disposition of this issue in the Claimant’s favour would dispose of the Respondent’s
first jurisdictional objection. The Respondent, on the other hand, submits that the clause
contemplates a piecemeal analysis, such that a state will not be obliged to provisionally

apply any individual provision of the Treaty that is inconsistent with its domestic law.

Page 18 of 195

The second sub-issue that arises under this head is whether Article 26 itself, or its
provisional application, is inconsistent with Russian law. The Tribunal now summarizes
the submissions of each Party on both of these issues before coming to its own decision

on provisional application as a whole.
1. The correct interpretation of Article 45(1)

(a) The Respondent’s position
The Respondent contends that, pursuant to Article 45(1), a signatory applies the ECT
provisionally pending its entry into force for that signatory “to the extent that such
provisional application is not inconsistent with its constitution, laws or regulations.” The
Respondent argues that, accordingly, the Domestic Law Inconsistency Clause of Article
45(1) applies (a) to conceptual inconsistencies (¢.g. the non-recognition of the principle
of provisional application in constitutional law) and also (b) to inconsistencies of
individual treaty provisions (e.g. Article 26 of the ECT on the settlement of disputes
between “Investors” and “Contracting Parties”) with the laws or regulations of a

signatory.*>

Addressing the wording of Article 45(1) of the ECT, the Respondent notes that the plain
language of the Domestic Law Inconsistency Clause and the ordinary meaning of the term
“to the extent” mean that the scope of provisional application of the ECT by a signatory
depends on whether or not each provision of the ECT is consistent with the “constitution,
laws or regulations” of that signatory. The Respondent contends that the ordinary
meaning of the words “to the extent,” “scope” or “width” is to the same effect in the other
authentic language versions of the ECT,” and is consistent with its use elsewhere in the
ECT.” The Respondent objects to the interpretation of the Domestic Law Inconsistency
Clause put forth by the Claimant, which suggests that the provision would only take effect
if the domestic law of an ECT signatory prohibits provisional application of the Treaty in
its entirety2® The Respondent contends that such an interpretation would siphon any

meaning out of the term “to the extent,” effectively substituting it with the term “if” or

“where”? and would eliminate the term “such.”° If that meaning was intended, then
Article 45(1) would not refer to “such provisional application” but would simply refer to

“provisional application” or “provisional application as such.”*!
PI

52. The Respondent points out that, while the Claimant attempts to draw support for its
interpretation from an expert Opinion submitted by Professor Reisman on behalf of the
claimant in Hulley Enterprises Limited v. Russian Federation” (“Hulley Enterprises”)
Professor Reisman expressly rejected the Claimant’s position in a 2011 article, noting
that “[i]f Article 45(1) had been intended to refer to the notion of the permissibility of the
provisional application of a treaty as such, it would not have been necessary to introduce
the phrase ‘to the extent’? The Respondent refers to several further authorities in

accord with this view.

53. The Respondent also sees as significant the inclusion of “laws” and “regulations” in the
“to the extent” clause, observing that a prohibition of provisional application typically
results from constitutional requirements or acts of legislation implementing constitutional
principles; in contrast, such prohibition typically would not result from “several laws” or
“hierarchically lower legal acts” such as regulations.*> Thus, the Respondent argues that
the inclusion of “regulations” in the Domestic Law Inconsistency Clause confirms “that

not only conceptual inconsistencies, but also specific inconsistencies of particular treaty

provisions with domestic laws and regulations are covered.“ The Respondent cites the

same article by Professor Reisman as confirmation of this observation.*?

The Respondent submits that its interpretation is supported by the context of the
provision. Firstly, with regard to the Claimant’s argument that “provisional application’
has the same meaning under both Articles 45(1) and 45(2)(a) (i.e. application of the
Treaty as a whole),”** the Respondent disagrees, arguing that “provisional application”
does not have the same meaning in Article 45(1) of the ECT as in Article 45(2) of the
ECT. In contrast to Article 45(1), with its “to the extent” language, Article 45(2)(a)
allows a signatory state to opt out of provisional application entirely. Further, under
Article 45(2)(c), a signatory must still provisionally apply the provisions of Part VII
(“Structure and Institutions”) “to the extent that such provisional application is not
inconsistent with its laws or regulations.”*? Thus, “[pJursuant to Article 45(1) ECT, a
signatory applies all parts of the ECT, but subject to inconsistencies with its domestic
law. Pursuant to Article 45(2)(c) ECT, a signatory applies only Part VII, but again subject

to inconsistencies with its domestic law.”*°

The Respondent contends that, “[s]ince a signatory that applies Part VII on a provisional
basis pursuant to Article 45(2)(¢) ECT has already opted out of provisional application
entirely,” the Domestic Law Inconsistency Clause in Article 45(2)(c) of the ECT can only
refer to “inconsistencies between that signatory’s ‘laws or regulations’ and specific
obligations under Part VII of the ECT.”5! Moreover, the Respondent points out that a
facsimile sent by the U.S. Department of State to the Energy Charter Conference

Secretariat in the context of the ECT negotiations supports this view.*?

Secondly, the Respondent rejects the Claimant’s assertion that Article 45(3)(b) of the

ECT supports an “all-or-nothing” approach to Article 45(1), arguing that “Article

45(3)(b) ECT says nothing about the scope of a signatory’s provisional application under
Article 45(1) ECT."**

Thirdly, the Respondent rejects the Claimant’s argument that Article 45(6) of the ECT
supports the Claimant’s “all-or-nothing” approach to Article 45(1),>> since the language
of Article 45(6) “simply confirms that Article 45 provides for two distinct regimes of
provisional application.” The Respondent further notes that, if the Claimant were correct
in its contention that Article 45(1) is an “all-or-nothing” provision, there would be no

oe

reason for Article 45(6) to provide expressly that cost contributions be made “in

accordance with and subject to the provisions of paragraph (1).”5°

Fourthly, the Respondent rejects the Claimant’s argument that Article 45(2)(b) of the
ECT reflects a reciprocity of obligations and provides that investors of a signatory may
not claim Treaty benefits unless the signatory consents to apply the Treaty in its entirety.*”
The Respondent points out that Article 45(2)(b) makes explicit reference to the “benefits
of provisional application under paragraph (1)” (thus including the Domestic Law
Inconsistency Clause), rather than to “this Treaty.” Therefore, according to the
Respondent, the reciprocity limitation provided in Article 45(2)(b) only applies to a
signatory if it has opted out of provisional application pursuant to Article 45(2)(a).*8

The Respondent also regards the Claimant’s argument in relation to Article 27 of the
VCLT as misguided, noting that, while “Article 27 VCLT prohibits a State from invoking
its domestic law as justification for failure to perform a treaty,” “(a] State that invokes its
internal law pursuant to a ‘to the extent’ clause does not seek to justify its failure to
perform a treaty obligation,” but rather does so “to determine the extent and content of

the obligations it has accepted under a treaty.”°° In this regard, the Respondent points

out that, contrary to the Claimant’s argument,” Professor Lefeber’s 1998 article and its
2011 entry in the Max Planck Encyclopedia fully support its position, acknowledging the
ECT as an example of a treaty providing “that its provisional application is subject to
national law, which means that, in case of conflict national law prevails over the treaty.”®!

According to the Respondent, other commentators are in accord.

60. The Respondent takes the view that the authorities cited by Claimant for the proposition

 

that the Respond interpretation of the D: ic Law I i y Clause runs
against Article 27 of the VCLT “are unavailing.” The Respondent submits that the
Claimant’s citation of Resolution No. 8-P (“Resolution No. 8-P”) rendered in 2012 by
the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation (the “Constitutional Court”) is
irrelevant because the quoted statement dealt with treaties that had entered into force, and
the ECT has not yet entered into force for the Respondent.® In like manner, the
Respondent rejects the notion that the expert opinion of Professor Reisman in the Hulley
Enterprises arbitration provides authority for the proposition that the Respondent’s
interpretation of the Domestic Law Inconsistency Clause runs counter to Article 27 of the

VCLT.&

61. The Respondent further contends that the Claimant’s citation of an expert opinion
submitted by Professor James Crawford in Hulley Enterprises is unavailing, as “[n]o
authority is cited to support the statement that Article 27 VCLT has been relied upon to
reduce the scope of a ‘to the extent’ clause to the principle of provisional application."

Claimant,® pointing out in particular that both cases were chaired by the same arbitrator
and that the Hulley Enterprises award is currently subject to set aside proceedings in the

Netherlands.

62. The Respondent further contends that the Claimant has inaccurately conflated the
Domestic Law Inconsistency Clause under Article 45(1) of the ECT and the grounds for
invalidating consent under Article 46(1) of the VCLT.© According to the Respondent,
the two provisions have an “essentially different nature and function” and stand in marked
contrast with regard to their language and the conditions under which they may be
invoked.”” In particular, the Respondent points out that it “does not seek to vitiate its
consent to apply the ECT on a provisional basis” (as it might under Article 46(1) of the
VCLT), but that it is invoking “its domestic law pursuant to the ‘to the extent’ clause in
Article 45(1) ECT to determine the extent of its obligations under the ECT.”7!

63. Regarding the issue of reciprocity, the Respondent further points to a memorandum” and
an article’> by Mr Craig S. Bamberger, acknowledging (in the words of the Respondent)
“that a signatory that applies the ECT provisionally pursuant to Article 45(1) ECT might
—or might not— apply a particular provision of the ECT, including, critically, the investor-
State arbitration mechanism in Article 26 ECT, depending on whether the Treaty
provision in question is consistent with the signatory’s ‘constitution, laws or
regulations’.”* The Respondent also submits that Mr Bamberger’s article refutes a

policy argument relied on by the tribunal in Hulley Enterprises and by the Claimant,’>

that, if a signatory state were allowed to invoke inconsistencies with individual provisions
of the ECT, a situation of “unacceptable uncertainty” would emerge.” The Respondent
refers to Mr Bamberger to note that treaty drafting requires balancing competing interests
through compromise, and that in the case of Article 45(1) of the ECT the drafters balanced
“the signatories’ interest to have the treaty applied as soon as possible” with a “respect
for domestic law constraints.””” In this manner, “flexibility in the scope of the ECT’s
provisional application” was instrumental in “ensur[ing] the widest possible participation
in provisional application, including by signatories that were not in a position to commit

to provisional application of the entire Treaty because of domestic law constraints.””8

In response to a question from the Tribunal, the Respondent identified a number of
provisions of the ECT that it considered were provisionally applied by the Russian
Federation because they reflected existing protections in Russian law.”? To that extent an
investor has the protection of substantive treaty obligations, although it may only enforce
them in the Russian domestic courts.®° In the Respondent’s submission, each investor
must be aware of the domestic law limitation in Article 45 of the ECT, and is responsible
for conducting due diligence with the assistance of local counsel to determine which of

the provisions of that treaty it will be entitled to rely on.*!

The Respondent goes on to argue that its interpretation is also in line with the “purpose
and effect” of Article 45(1) of the ECT, which “is to accommodate the domestic law
problems that provisional application raises for most States by limiting provisional
application to those treaty provisions that are consistent with each signatory’s domestic
laws.”8? The Domestic Law Inconsistency Clause was, according to the Respondent,
“clearly motivated by this goal,” having been introduced according to a proposal by the
United States in the draft Basic Protocol of October 1991.8 As the Respondent

highlights, the United States admitted in a facsimile that it “d[id] not have any legal
difficulty with provisional application per se” and found the language of the Domestic
Law Inconsistency Clause “essential to any provisional application obligation.”** The
European Community likewise recognized the principle of provisional application,
relying on the Domestic Law Inconsistency Clause itself to limit its provisional

application to provisions within its competence.*°

The Respondent further alleges that the “vast majority” of ECT negotiating states

d.

recognized the principle of provisional application, yet “had to di
law constraints through the ‘to the extent’ clause.”®° In particular, the Respondent pleads
that Germany limited provisional application to obligations that “were consistent with its
legislation or within executive competence, not requiring parliamentary approval.”®7
Likewise, the Netherlands only allowed the executive to agree to provisional application
“if a treaty did not deviate, or necessitate deviation from, the Constitution, and to the
extent its provisions did not deviate from Dutch legislation or necessitate such
deviation.”88 Similarly, the Respondent contends that France “recognized the principle
of provisional application, but only permitted the provisional application of treaties on
matters falling within the power of the executive or after parliamentary authorization had

been granted.”®?

The Respondent further contends that its interpretation is in line with “the circumstances
of the ECT’s conclusion and the signatories’ practice in interpreting and applying Article
45(1) ECT.”® The Respondent highlights that, while a number of signatories of the ECT
made declarations pursuant to Article 45(2)(a) when signing the ECT, others chose to
expressly rely on the Domestic Law Inconsistency Clause of Article 45(1) to exclude or

limit the provisional application of the ECT.’!

The Respondent points out that, contrary to the Claimant’s assertion,” the fact that “these
ECT signatories invoked the ‘to the extent’ clause to exclude provisional application does
not support an inference that they interpreted Article 45(1) ECT as an all-or-nothing
provision.” In fact, according to the Respondent, two of the relevant signatories
“expressly stated that Article 45(1) ECT ‘does not create any commitment beyond what

is compatible with the existing legal order of the Signatories’.” ”

In addition, the Respondent contends that even where signatories made no declaration
whatsoever, internal documents show that they shared the Respondent’s interpretation of
Article 45(1) of the ECT. In particular, the Respondent refers to several documents
prepared by the Finnish Government,” as well as a 1994 Statement by the Council, the
Commission and the Member States of the European Community on Article 45 of the
European Energy Charter Treaty (the “1994 Joint EC Statement”).°° The Respondent
argues that, in the 1994 Joint EC Statement, the European Community and its then twelve
Member States, by stating that Article 45(1) of the ECT “does not create any commitment
beyond what is compatible with the existing internal legal order of the Signatories,” relied
on that provision to determine that a signatory of the ECT would not have to file a
declaration of non-application pursuant to Article 45(2), in order to exclude the non-
application of parts of the ECT not compatible with its legal order, as this is an automatic
consequence from the text of Article 45(1).°’ The Respondent adds that the Member
States that adopted the 1994 Joint EC Statement did not communicate their position to

the other ECT negotiating states, as such communication was not required of them.”

The Respondent also refers to the ““to the extent’ clause in paragraph 1(b) of the Protocol

of Provisional Application” of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (“GATT”),

pointing out that there is a “consistent body of GATT case law” confirming that “GATT
Contracting States were entitled to and did invoke specific inconsistencies of their
domestic laws with particular GATT obligations.”°? The Respondent also argues that
there was “never any suggestion that consent by the executive to provisional application
may suffice to eliminate inconsistencies” between domestic law and GATT

obligations.'”

Furthermore, the Respondent disputes the Claimant’s allegation'®! that the “Respondent
‘at all relevant times made clear’ that it applied the ECT provisionally as a whole.”
The Respondent alleges that the “Claimant has failed to point to a single statement by
Respondent in the course of the ECT negotiations or at the time of the Treaty’s signature
that ‘made clear’ that it would apply the ECT provisionally as a whole.”!? In particular,
the Respondent takes issue with the Claimant’s “selective” and “out of context”
quotation'® of background information published on the website of the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, which according to the Respondent “does not state that Respondent
applies the ECT as a whole.”'® Likewise, the Respondent rejects the Claimant’s
argument! that a statement made by the Russian delegation at the 2002 Energy Charter
Conference proves that the Respondent believed it was bound to provisionally apply the
ECT asa whole.'°” In contrast, the Respondent argues that the statement does not address

the scope of provisional application.'*

The Respondent submits that the fact that the European Union and Energy Charter
Secretariat and Conference pressured the Respondent to ratify the ECT “evidences that
they appreciated that provisional application did not impose on Respondent the same

obligations as ratification.”"? In like manner, the Respondent contends that statements

by the United Kingdom Secretary of State provide support for the Respondent’s
interpretation of the Domestic Law Inconsistency Clause.'!° The Respondent recounts
that the UK Secretary of State told the House of Commons in 2006 that Article 45 “places
some obligations on the Russia[n] Federation, but only to the extent that such provisional

application is not inconsistent with its constitution, laws or regulations.”""!

The Respondent also quotes the former chairman of the legal advisory committee to the
European Energy Conference, Mr Bamberger. In an article on the subject of the
provisional application of the ECT’s dispute resolution provisions in energy transit
disputes, Mr Bamberger acknowledged that:

[e]ven in the case of a state not making such a declaration [pursuant to Article
45(2)(a) of the ECT], it could prove extremely difficult to ascertain the extent to
which the provisions of the ECT are inconsistent with the particular signatory’s

constitution, laws or regulations.!!?

The Respondent submits that Mr Bamberger’s article supports the proposition that “the
operation and effectiveness of the transit dispute settlement mechanism . . . depends on

the consistency of that mechanism with each signatory’s domestic law.”!?

(b) The Claimant’s position

Against the Respondent’s position, the Claimant contends that Article 45(1) of the ECT
permits a signatory to avoid provisional application of the ECT as a whole “only to the
extent the principle of provisional application is inconsistent with their domestic law.”!'4
The Claimant contends, that this was “not the case with Russia, nor does Respondent
suggest that it is.”!!> The Claimant additionally points out that, whilst a signatory to the

Article 45(2) ECT, “Respondent did not do so.”"6 The Claimant argues that the
Respondent’s interpretation of the Domestic Law Inconsistency Clause represents a
“piecemeal argument” that would make “the specific scope of provisional application
entirely dependent on the degree and nature of each signatory’s invocation of its internal
laws.” Such an interpretation would “run[] counter to cardinal principles of international

law.7!!7

The Claimant argues for an interpretation of Article 45(1) grounded in the “ordinary
meaning” of the provision, emphasizing the need for reading the provision in the context
of the ECT’s object and purpose, in line with Article 31(1) of the VCLT.!'8 Accordingly,
the Claimant contends that the limiting language of Article 45(1) “applies only to ‘such
provisional application’,” the meaning of which must be the foundation of a proper

interpretation of Article 45(1). Mg,

Interpreting Article 45(1) in this manner, the Claimant focuses on the word “such,” which
it alleges was “ignored by Respondent.” 120 ‘The plain meaning of “such” in this context
is, according to the Claimant, “of the kind specified.” '21 The Claimant further argues
that “the kind of provisional application specified is that ‘[e]ach signatory agrees to apply
[the ECT] provisionally pending its entry into force for such signatory’.”'?* Therefore, as
the Claimant contends, “the limiting ‘to the extent’ language . . . operates only where
applying ‘this Treaty’ (i.¢., the principle of provisional application itself) is inconsistent
with the signatory’s constitution, laws or regulations.”!73 The Claimant notes that such
an interpretation is consistent with the findings of the tribunals in Hulley Enterprises!

and Kardassopoulos.'*

The Claimant further contends that “‘provisional application’ has the same meaning
under both Articles 45(1) and 45(2)(a) (i.e. application of the Treaty as a whole).”!26
According to the Claimant, the Respondent concedes that the Claimant “is correct that
the phrase ‘such provisional application’ refers to the provisional application previously
mentioned in Article 45(1) ECT, namely the provisional application of ‘this Treaty’ .”!?7
After making such a concession, however, the Claimant asserts that the Respondent offers
a rebuttal! that is no more than a tautology and a “confused commentary devoid of any
apparent logic.”!?° The Claimant adds that the Respondent’s authorities in this regard do

not support the Respondent’s position.'”°

The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s assertion that the Claimant’s interpretation of
Article 45(1) “deprives the term ‘to the extent’ of any meaning and would effectively
substitute for it ‘if’, ‘unless’ or ‘where’,”!>! noting that the Respondent’s interpretation
“cannot be gleaned from the language on any logical basis.”!*? Although it accepts that
deleting “such” or replacing it with “if? would also convey the meaning for which the
Claimant contends, it maintains that this does not change the proper interpretation of the

clause.'33

The Claimant also rejects the Respondent’s reliance on the word “regulations” as being
within the Domestic Law Inconsistency Clause,'* noting that the word was added at the

request of the Japanese delegation late in the drafting process and “attracted no

signalled a consensus understanding that Article 45(1) would be subject to a piecemeal

interpretation.”'37

The Claimant also disputes the Respondent’s contention that the Claimant’s interpretation
renders Article 45(1) “superfluous.”"*8 The Claimant notes that, for signatories that do
not make an opt-out declaration, Article 45(1) “provides a safety net that ... permits
[signatories] to ... avoid provisional application if, and only if, it is inconsistent with
their laws to so apply the Treaty,” as opposed to opt out declarations made pursuant to
Article 45(2)(a), which “may be made for any reason.”!3° So if any state had a concern
with provisional application, they were free to opt out pursuant to that clause.'#° They

could also opt out of the 20 year tail.'*!

The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s interpretation of other provisions in Article 45 as
well, finding the Respondent’s contentions'”? regarding Article 45(3)(b) “impossible to
comprehend.”'4? The Claimant criticizes the Respondent’s interpretation as ignoring the
fact that Article 45(3)(b) holds that, under Article 45(1), there exists an “obligation . . . to
apply Parts III and V,” the effect of which is to “strip[] Article 45(3)(b) of all meaning
for any signatory claiming that Parts III and V are inconsistent with its domestic law.”!“*
What this conveys, according to the Claimant, is that “under any interpretation of Article

45(1), signatory states are applying provisionally Parts II] and V.”!*5

Further, the Claimant finds the Respondent’s arguments" regarding Article 45(2)(b) to
be “unclear” and “circular and of no apparent significance,” contending instead that

“Article 45(2)(b) simply provides for reciprocity.”"“” According to the Claimant, the

Respondent’s position'*® on Articles 45(1) and 45(2)(b) is a “piecemeal approach” in
which “signatory states could invoke their own domestic law to determine which Treaty
obligations they would apply provisionally.”"? Under the Respondent’s interpretation,
for states applying the ECT provisionally, “there would then be no legal obligation of
reciprocity whatsoever, either to or from them: signatory states would be free to adopt (or
not) their own subjective, non-transparent policies of reciprocity ... based upon their
domestic-law infused provisional application,” thereby creating a system in which
investors would face the impossible job of deciphering a “non-reciprocal patchwork of
‘reciprocity’.”!°° The Claimant refers to commentary characterizing such a system as
lacking “harmonisation, standardisation or unification of conduct” since “the reach of

international law would be limited by approximately [40] internal legal orders.”!'>!

As the Claimant notes, Article 17(1) of the VCLT provides that “the consent of a State to
be bound by part of a treaty is effective only if the treaty so permits or the other
contracting States so agree.”'5? The Claimant contends that Article 45(2)(c) of the ECT
is an example of a provision that expressly provides for provisional application of only
part of the ECT, as it requires a signatory that has made a declaration under Article
45(2)(a) to “apply Part VII provisionally . . . to the extent that such provisional application
is not inconsistent with [their] laws or regulations.”!53 Thus, “Article 45(2)(c) creates a
specific exception where parties are to apply only Part VII.”!** In contrast, the Claimant
notes that Article 45(1) does not contain such express authorisation for a signatory to
apply provisionally only a part of the Treaty, “mak[ing] clear that the use of ‘provisional
application’ in Articles 45(1} and 45(2)(c) refers to application of the Treaty as a

whole.”!5°

The Claimant cites Article 45(2)(a) of the ECT as support for this argument, since the
provision entitles the signatory to deliver a declaration after signing the ECT that the

signatory “is not able to accept provisional application.” According to the Claimant,

Article 45(2)(a) therefore “provides that a declaration removes ‘[t]he obligation contained

in paragraph (1),’ making clear that ‘provisional application’ has the same meaning under
both Articles 45(1) and 45(2)(a) (ie., application of the Treaty as a whole).”1%6

The Claimant also cites Article 45(2)(b) of the ECT and its “reciprocity of obligations,”
providing that “investors of a signatory may not claim [ECT] benefits unless the signatory
consents to apply [the ECT] provisionally (e., in its entirety).”!*” On such obligations,
the Claimant references Hulley Enterprises for the proposition that “[a]llowing a State to
modulate . . . the obligation of provisional application . .. would undermine the principle
that provisional application of a treaty creates binding obligations,”'** thus “creat[ing]
unacceptable uncertainty in international affairs.”'*° It would also mean that one state
could be “provisionally applying virtually nothing and receive all of the benefits from

states that are applying the whole thing.”!®

Commenting on the Respondent’s submissions as to what provisions were provisionally
applied by the Russian Federation, the Claimant suggests that “the Russian Federation
provisionally applied nothing” but just invited investors to avail themselves of the

protections available under existing Russian law.'*!

The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s critique! that the Hulley Enterprises tribunal’s
decision regarding Article 45(1) issues was based merely on policy considerations.'®
The Claimant notes that Articles 27 and 46 of the VCLT “reflect the strong presumption
in international law of the separation of international law and domestic law,” and that, in
spite of the Respondent’s arguments to the contrary, '® these articles are relevant to the

interpretation of the Domestic Law Inconsistency Clause.'® Further, the Claimant notes

that “legal certainty” is more than a policy issue, considering it instead “a fundamental
principle of international and national law” that “informs” Articles 27 and 46 of the
VCLT.'® Thus, the Claimant argues that, “if Article 45(1) was to depart from [these
principles of international law] it would need to expressly state that that is what it is

doing,” noting that Article 45(1) does not do so.'¢7

The Claimant also rejects the Respondent’s citation of Professor Reisman’s critique of
the same position that the Claimant has adopted in this arbitration,'®* noting that the
Respondent omits a portion of Professor Reisman’s analysis that shows that Professor
Reisman, Hulley Enterprises, and Kardassopoulos are all in accord with the proposition
that a signatory state wishing to avoid provisional application “must duly notify in
advance that its constitution, laws or regulations disable it from provisional application”
and that, for investors having already invested in a State, “Part III and Part V of the ECT
remain in force for 20 years with regard to any investments made in that state during the
provisional application unless a declaration rejecting the ‘tail’ is made at the time of

signature.”!©

The Claimant also refers to Article 45(3) of the ECT as a provision allowing a signatory
to stop provisionally applying the ECT, but nonetheless simultaneously requiring a
signatory to apply Part III and Part V of the ECT with respect to investments that already
had been made, unless that signatory is listed in Annex PA.'” Accordingly, the Claimant
sees Article 45(3) as evidence that “application of Parts III and V of the ECT is part of
the obligation of provisional application found in Article 45(1),” as “it would otherwise

be nonsensical.”!7!

As additional support for its argument that the ECT envisions two categories of
provisional application, the Claimant also cites Article 45(6) of the ECT, which states

that “signatories shall, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of paragraph (1)

or subparagraph (2)(c) as appropriate, contribute to the costs of the provisional Secretariat

as if the signatories were Contracting Parties.” The Claimant contends that Article 45(6)

supports its argument that “there are two distinct categories of provisional application ...

application of the Treaty as a whole under Article 45(1) or application only of Part VII
under Article 45(2)(c).""?

The Claimant also cites Article 27 of the VCLT to show that the Respondent is wrong to
“invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a
treaty.”" As authority for this proposition, the Claimant cites the legal opinions of
Professor Crawford and Professor Reisman in Hulley Enterprises,'™ as well as the
Constitutional Court.'5 The Claimant concedes that, under Article 46(1) of the VCLT, a
“narrow exception” applies “[i]f a fundamental provision of internal law ‘regarding
competence to conclude treaties’ ... manifestly precludes the giving of consent to so
conclude ... the treaty.”!76 Nevertheless, the Claimant rejects the notion that the
Respondent has suggested or could suggest that this exception applies to the Respondent
here.'77 According to the Claimant, the interpretation advanced by the Respondent would
give Article 45 of the ECT “the function of a reservation,” and Article 46 of the ECT

“precludes any reservations to individual Treaty provisions.”'78

The Claimant further rejects the Respondent’s interpretation arguments, noting that
“[m]ost of the Respondent’s arguments in support of its . . . approach may be described
as supplementary means of interpretation arguments.”'7? The Claimant contends that
Article 45(1) of the ECT is not “ambiguous or obscure” and that interpreting the ECT

using a plain language approach does not lead to a “manifestly absurd or unreasonable”

result. Thus, according to the Claimant, the Respondent’s arguments are “unnecessary

and should not be considered pursuant to Article 32 of the [VCLT].”!®°

 

In any event, the Claimant iders the Respondent’s interp

misguided for several reasons. Firstly, the Claimant notes that a UN General Assembly
discussion to which the Respondent refers “concerns the principle of provisional
application of treaties” but does not support the “piecemeal” provisional application for

which the Respondent argues.'*!

Secondly, the Claimant avers that a work by René
Lefeber — cited by the Respondent as authority for the proposition that “in the event of a
conflict, domestic laws prevail over inconsistent treaty provisions” — does not, in reality,

back up such a proposition.!®

On the contrary, the Claimant notes, quoting Lefeber, that
“if a competent organ agrees to the provisional application of a treaty in disregard of such
domestic limitations, such disregard will normally not have legal effect at the
international level.”'®} Thirdly, on the Respondent’s argument regarding state practice,
the Claimant notes that the states referred to by the Respondent invoked the “to the extent”
language of Article 45(1) of the ECT “solely to exclude,” not to limit, provisional

application of the ECT."

Moreover, the Claimant argues that the Respondent “at all relevant times made clear that
it was provisionally applying ‘the Treaty’, not merely some unidentified part of it.”!® As
evidence for this proposition, the Claimant highlights the fact that the Respondent failed
to notify the ECT Secretariat of any desire to be excepted from provisional application
on the basis of either Article 45(1) or Article 45(2)(a) of the ECT, even though the
Secretariat had “asked all delegations wishing to make a request to be excepted from

provisional application to notify it.”!®*

Furthermore, the Claimant notes that, at the Sixteenth Plenary Session of the Energy
Charter Conference, the Respondent joined a declaration stating that “a party may not
invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a
treaty.”'8? Even further, the Claimant draws evidence from the Energy Charter
Conference of December 2002, quoting the Russian delegation as saying that it had “yet
to ratify the Energy Charter Treaty, but, as a Signatory Country, it implements the Treaty
from the day it entered into force.”'*8 The Claimant submits that the “Respondents
conduct during the treaty negotiations displayed nothing but complete enthusiasm for
provisional application.”"®° The Claimant also cites an information bulletin from the
website of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs as evidence that the Respondent

acknowledged that it was provisionally applying the ECT as a whole.'%

The Claimant further contends that, regarding state practice, the Respondent only
analyzes the practice of one State — Finland — and that, moreover, the documents it relies
on fail to “provide evidence of ‘any agreement’ between the parties or an instrument
accepted by the other parties on signature or any ‘subsequent agreement’ or ‘practice’
establishing the agreement of the parties for purposes of Article 31 of the [VCLT].”""
Additionally, the Claimant finds the other documents cited by the Respondent to be

irrelevant and, “in any event, consistent with the Claimant's interpretation.”!?

The Claimant argues that state practice in fact provides support for its interpretation,
noting that, during the negotiating process, an “emphasis on legal certainty prevailed over
opposition from various delegations!” and referring to the Energy Charter Conference

not to provisionally apply the ECT.'* The Claimant notes that nine states — Iceland,
Malta, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Switzerland, Turkmenistan, Norway, Japan, and Poland — made
declarations pursuant to Article 45(2)(a), and that Hungary made a declaration citing
Article 45 without specifying a particular paragraph.'®> The Claimant cites the Hulley
Enterprises decision, which highlighted that no state relied on Article 45(1) for “selective
or partial application of the ECT based on the non-application of only those individual
provisions that are claimed to be inconsistent with a signatory’s domestic Jaw.7!96
According to the Claimant, the Respondent has not provided evidence that any signatory
that did not give notice or make a declaration adopted the Respondent’s “piecemeal

approach” to Article 45(1).!9”

99. The Claimant also refers to the Decision of the Energy Charter Conference of 7 December
2000 recording the termination of certain transitional arrangements contained in Annex
T by Armenia and Russia, noting that the decision does not suggest an understanding that,
after the transitional arrangements were terminated, Russia would only apply in part the
substantive obligations referred to in Article 32(1), since such a point would have been
recorded.!98 The Claimant sees further support for its interpretation of Article 45(1) in
“the practice of the ECT Secretariat concerning transitional provisions in Article 32 in

relation to, inter alia, Article 10(7) on non-discrimination.”!?

100. The Claimant submits that GATT practice is not informative on this point because the

provisional application regime is different.

Joint EC Statement] does not say, and cannot be read as meaning, that certain elements
of the ECT will not be provisionally applied by the European Community because they
are inconsistent with the Community’s internal legal order.” Rather, the Tribunal in
Hulley Enterprises found that “the [1994 Joint EC Statement] concludes that the
European Community can safely sign the ECT, and accept the obligation of provisional
application, without taking on any obligation to do anything that is beyond its
competence.”*°3 Accordingly, the 1994 Joint EC Statement is “not so much an example
of partial provisional application of the ECT due to inconsistency with the EC’s legal
order, as . . .an example of the EC’s partial jurisdiction for the provisional application of
the whole ECT.”

The Claimant notes that there is no suggestion in the statement that the European
Community thought that individual provisions of the ECT could be applied provisionally
ona piecemeal basis.2°5 Rather, when the European Court of Justice issued Opinion 1/94,
holding that there were certain categories of treaties that the European Commission did
not have competence to commit to, the European Community took the view that each of
the European Commission and Member States could commit to the provisions that they
were competent to commit to, and the result was provisional application of the entire

treaty 2%

The Claimant additionally rejects that the Bamberger and Loibl articles referred to by the
Respondent are relevant, since “[t]he opinions of publicists as to the interpretation ofa

treaty are not supplementary means of treaty interpretation.”?°7

Regarding the Respondent’s argument that it never received the benefits of provisional
application, the Claimant disagrees, contending that Russia was “anxious to bind as many
signatories as possible to immediate provisional application of the Treaty,” since signing

the ECT was one part of a larger plan to attract foreign capital following the collapse of

the USSR“ The Claimant adds that the Respondent provisionally applied the ECT until

it notified the ECT depository in 2009, a period in which it received “substantial foreign

investment” in the energy sector.7°?

105. Further, the Claimant rejects the Respondents citation of a 2006 statement by the
Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs to the UK House of
Commons,”"” noting that the statement is “irrelevant” and contending that, in any event,

the statement is consistent with the Claimant's interpretation.?!!

2. Is Article 26 or its provisional application inconsistent with Russia’s

constitution, laws or regulations?

(a) The Respondent’s position

106.

nN

The Respondent contends that Article 26 of the ECT is, for purposes of Article 45(1) of
the ECT, inconsistent with the Russian Federation’s “constitution, laws or regulations.”
It argues that any ECT provision that imposes an obligation that cannot be fulfilled in
conformity with domestic law, or that grants a right that cannot be exercised in conformity
with domestic law, is inconsistent with the signatory’s domestic law for the purposes of
Article 45(1).2

107, The Respondent argues that since “Article 26 ECT is a treaty provision that is inconsistent
with Russian law,” as long as the Russian Federation has not ratified the ECT,?"> the
provisional application of Article 26 of the ECT “at least beyond six months” is
inconsistent with the Russian Federation’s “constitutions” and “laws” for the purposes of
Article 45(1) of the ECT.2'* The Respondent further contends that the provisional
application of Article 26 of the ECT “has at all relevant times been inconsistent with

Russian laws prohibiting the arbitration of disputes arising out of public law relations,”

and that, for this reason, the provisional application of Article 26 is inconsistent with the

Respondent's laws for the purposes of Article 45(1) of the ECT.?!5

108. As support for this argument, the Respondent appeals to the principle of the separation of
powers, citing the 1993 Constitution of the Russian Federation (the “Constitution”) and
the Russian Federal Law on International Treaties of the Russian Federation (the
“FLIT”).

109. Addressing the argumentation of the Claimant, the Respondent takes the view that the

Claimant “conflates fundamentally different concepts of the law of treaties,” thereby

 

‘repeatedly misch iz[ing] Respondent’s sig of the ECT as an expression of
‘consent to be bound? by the ECT.”?'® The Respondent notes that the ECT includes an
express ratification requirement, pointing out that, as a consequence, the Respondent
“never consented to be bound by the ECT, and the ECT never entered into force for
Respondent.”?'? According to the Respondent, “by signing the ECT, subject to
ratification ..., Respondent did not consent to be bound by the Treaty,” but merely
agreed to “apply the ECT provisionally ‘to the extent that such provisional application is

not inconsistent with its constitution, laws or regulations’.”?!8

110, In particular, the Respondent refers to Article 106(d) of the Constitution, which provides
that the State Duma (the lower chamber of the Federal Assembly) must adopt federal laws
on the “ratification and denunciation of international treaties of the Russian Federation,”
pointing out that these laws are then subject to mandatory consideration by the Council
of the Federation (the upper chamber of the Federal Assembly). When these

itutional are not lied with, the fund: | principle of the

q Ip

separation of powers under the Constitution is violated.?" Specifically, the Respondent
states that the Russian Federation splits treaty-making powers between the executive and
Parliament, with the President (or Government) having the power to negotiate and sign

treaties, the Federal Assembly having authority to ratify treaties by adopting a federal

law, and the president having the power to sign that federal law as well as the ratification
instrument prepared on the basis of that federal law.° Quoting from Professor
Asoskov’s second opinion, the Respondent concludes that the Russian Government “does
not have the power to express consent to be bound by the treaty on behalf of the Russian

Federation”?!

ll

. The Respondent also refers to Articles 6(2), 14, 15(1)(a), and 15(2) of the FLIT, which
implement the principle of separation of powers in the context of the treaty making

process. These articles provide a requirement that certain categories of treaties, including

1 di 1

those “whose i requires of existing legislation or of
new federal laws, or that set out rules different from those provided for by a law” must
be ratified through the enactment of a federal law.2”2 The Respondent says that Professor
Stephan accepts that the Government may not express the Russian Federation’s consent
to be bound by a treaty which sets out rules different from those provided for by federal
law — except where there is provision for provisional application.” He thus accepts that
the Government lacks competence to enact, amend or supplement federal laws — except
to the extent that the Government is authorised to implement orders by the president under

Article 90 of the Constitution that do not contradict Russian law224

112. Additionally, Article 23(1) of the FLIT states that “[a]n international treaty or a part ofa
treaty may, prior to its entry into force, be applied by the Russian Federation provisionally
if the treaty itself so provides or if an agreement to that effect has been reached with the
parties that have signed the treaty.”"°> The Respondent notes that Article 23(2) of the
FLIT provides a requirement that the provisional application of a legislative treaty must
be submitted to the State Duma within six months of the beginning of the treaty’s

provisional application;26 Professor Asoskov’s evidence was that this was to enable

parliament to have the “final say,” even though the treaty could not derogate from federal

law by provisional application.?””

113. The Respondent also notes that the FLIT’s predecessor, the Law of the USSR dated 6
July 1978 “On the Procedure for Conclusion, Per! and D. iation of
International Treaties of the USSR” (the “USSR FLIT”), which remained in force when

 

the ECT was signed, contained ratification requirements that were similar to those of the
future FLIT. These ratification requirements were “applicable, inter alia, to ‘treaties
providing for rules different from those contained in the USSR legislative acts,’ as well
as to ‘international treaties of the USSR . . . where the contracting parties have agreed on
subsequent ratification when concluding the treaty’.”?"®> The Respondent asserts that
Professor Stephan agrees that the same wording is present in the 1978 and 1995 Laws
(with the exception of the last sentence), but stresses that the constitutional order had
changed significantly, including the creation of the institution of the president as part of
the executive (whereas the Presidium had previously been part of the legislature).?”°
114, The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s argument that, pursuant to Article 15(4) of the
Constitution, “treaties are incorporated into the Russian legal system ‘at the time of
expression of valid consent’ and automatically prevail over Russian law."° The
Respondent notes that Article 15(4) of the Constitution is a conflict of law rule that
“grant[s] priority in application to treaty provisions that establish ‘other rules than those
envisaged by law’” and “is not implicated where the terms of the treaty set a limit on its

application by reference to inconsistent domestic law.”9!

115.

Additionally, the Respondent contends that, whilst a treaty may be incorporated into
Russian law pursuant to Article 15(4) of the Constitution, this “does not mean that its
provisions prevail over Russian domestic law.”**” According to the Respondent, quoting

of the Constitution, as applied by the Supreme Court and supported by the Constitutional
Court, is that non-ratified treaties (including those applied on a provisional basis pending
their entry into force for the Russian Federation) have no priority over federal laws and

other legal acts having a higher rank in the hierarchy of sources of Russian law.”

116. Thus, the Respondent submits that it is “firmly established in Russian law that the
executive is not authorized to express the Russian Federation’s consent to be bound by a
treaty that requires ratification through the enactment of a federal law by the Federal
Assembly.”234 Decisions to consent to be bound by a treaty shall be adopted by state
authorities “in accordance with their competence” (Article 6(1) of the FLIT) so where
ratification is within the exclusive competence of the Federal Assembly (pursuant to
Article 160 of the Constitution and Article 14 of the FLIT), the executive may sign the
treaty but may not express the Respondent’s consent to be bound.”> The executive may

also agree to provisional application, but in the absence of ratification such a treaty has

Tided |

the status of a treaty cc without parli ‘y approval and is gly

hierarchically subordinate to federal laws?

117. The Respondent further contends that “[i]n implementing an unratified treaty, including

domestic system to the extent that it provided rules different to those of federal law; the

Respondent submits that Professor Stephan accepted that characterisation.“

 

118. A ding to the Respondent, these itutional ints “apply with equal force in
the context of treaties that are applied on a provisional basis,” meaning that the
implementation of “treaty provisions that require amendment of existing or enactment of
new legislation or that set out rules different from those provided for by law” is
“inconsistent with the Russian Constitution.”**! So the Respondent cites a recent decision
of the Constitutional Court for the proposition that a derogation from the requirement that
a dispute must be heard in the arbitrazh courts cannot be adopted by the executive but
must be provided by federal law.” According to the Respondent, these restrictions derive

“from the Constitution’s limitation on executive powers and the principles of separation
of powers, the rule of law and the requirement that the executive must act on the basis of

federal laws.”

119. Referring to the Chinese trespassers case, the Respondent relies on Professor Asoskov’s
testimony to the effect that limitations on the implementation of a provisionally applied
treaty translate into limitations on the executive’s power to consent to provisional
application, such that the executive is not authorised to consent to apply a treaty
provisionally to the extent that it would lack the power to implement it.”“4 So, pursuant
to Article 15(4) of the Constitution, only a treaty consent to be bound which was given in
the form of a federal law prevails over federal laws; in this respect, Professor Asoskov

relies on Resolutions of the Plenum of the Supreme Court which are not concerned

specifically with provisional application but are said to be generally applicable.24>

According to the Respondent, Professors Asoskov and Stephan agree that Article 15(4)

applies to both treaties that have entered into force and provisionally applied treaties.*4°
The Respondent submits that Professor Osminin’s opinion that the government may
derogate from federal law by consenting to provisional application is a minority view

based on disapproval of the relevant jurisprudence”

120. The Respondent contends that “[n]either of the two court decisions cited by Claimant and
its expert for the proposition that the terms of a provisionally applied treaty necessarily
apply in lieu of Russian federal law supports such a proposition.””** Resolution 8-P holds
that agreement to provisional application of a treaty means that the treaty becomes part
of Russian law and must be applied on the same basis as treaties that have entered into
force, but the Russian Federation may condition provisional application of a treaty prior
to its entry into force by compliance with the Constitution, laws and other regulatory acts
of the Russian Federation.” The Respondent argues that Professor Stephan accepts that
this expression refers to the same three types of legal acts as Article 45(1) of the ECT:

the constitution, laws and regulations.?*°

121. The Respondent submits that this confirms the general application of Article 15(4) of the
Constitution, but the treaty in question takes its place in the hierarchy of Russian law
according to the body that expressed consent to be bound by it. So where consent to be
bound (or consent to provisional application) was expressed by the government, the treaty

is incorporated at the level of a government resolution and does not prevail over federal

law.25!

122, The Respondent also disputes the Claimant’s assertion? that signatories of the ECT
expressly recognized, in the sixteenth understanding of the Final Act of the Energy
Charter Conference™, the possibility that Article 26 of the ECT would be incorporated

into domestic legal systems and would prevail over conflicting domestic law.” The
Respondent contends that, “[o]n its face, Understanding No. 16 does nothing more than
clarify that an ECT Contracting Party is not required to enact the substantive investment
protections in Part III into its domestic law in order to allow an investor to submit a
dispute to its courts or adi tribunals, izing that self- ing treaty
provisions are directly applicable in the legal systems of many ECT Contracting Parties,”
and that “Understanding 16 thus does not go to the question whether or not arbitration of

the present dispute is consistent with Respondent's ‘constitution, laws or regulations’.”*55

123. The Respondent further rejects the argument of the Claimant that Article 26 of the ECT
and Russian law cannot possibly be inconsistent because President Yeltsin signed the
ECT and thereby expressed the consent of the Respondent State to be bound by the
ECT2% The Respondent notes that the ECT was not signed by President Yeltsin but
rather by the Deputy Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation,
Mr Davydov.257 It challenges Professor Stephan’s opinion that the powers of the
President to negotiate and to sign treaties are exclusive, and that Mr Davydov as a member
of the Government was acting under a form of delegation.** In addition, the Respondent
points out that, since Article 39 of the ECT expressly required ratification of the Treaty,

its signature was “only ‘a stage in the conclusion of” the ECT.”

124. The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s view*™ that Russian domestic law and Article 26
of the ECT cannot be inconsistent since the Claimant seeks to enforce rights that arise
under the ECT and that are interpreted pursuant to public international law.?6' The
Respondent submits that the Claimant ignores the fact that Article 26 of the ECT is
qualified by the Domestic Law Inconsistency Clause of Article 45(1), and argues that the

two textbooks cited by the Claimant in this regard? are not relevant to addressing this

issue.

The Respondent also rejects the Claimant’s expert’s contention that Yukos Capital’s
claims are arbitrable because the Claimant does not request the annulment of public acts
such as tax assessments, enforcement measures, and decisions of the receiver in
bankruptcy proceedings.*® Professor Stephan’s evidence is that matters such as tax
assessments must be challenged before the Russian courts “[a]bsent some derogation.”2
The Respondent cites Professor Asoskov as authority for the proposition that a review of
the legality of such acts would be “inevitably” necessary to determining compensation
claims derived from those acts of governmental authority. The Respondent also quotes
Professor Skvortsov in concluding that “a dispute for compensation of damages caused
by the unlawful actions of State bodies and their officials exercising their public law

functions may not be referred for resolution to an arbitral tribunal.”

The Respondent argues that disputes between a foreign investor and the host state are
generally within the jurisdiction of the host state’s courts, regardless of whether the
investor invokes protections under treaty or domestic law.?6? Under Russian law, claims
for the wrongful exercise of state power are heard by the courts of general jurisdiction

and the arbitrazh courts.26

The Respondent further argues, citing the First Opinion of Professor Asoskov, that certain
public law disputes “have always been non-arbitrable under Russian law,” including

disputes regarding tax assessment, sanctions levied by tax authorities, the enforcement of

Tax Code, the Civil Procedure Code, the Arbitrazh Procedure Code, the Law ‘On

Entities’.”?””

o

Addressing the Claimant’s view that limitations on arbitrability are not applicable to state
authorities acting in a public law capacity,”’! the Respondent contends that this “turns the
principle of non-arbitrability on its head.”?”? According to the Respondent, “[pJublic law
disputes are not arbitrable precisely because the principles of freedom of contract and
procedural discretion, which allow parties to refer disputes to arbitration in the sphere of
private law, are not present in the sphere of public law.”?”3 As a consequence, the
Respondent quotes Professor Asoskov to the effect that a legal regulation that involves
an exercise of sovereign power is a public law regulation (alleging that the Claimant chose
not to cross-examine Professor Asoskov on this point?) and “{pJublic law disputes are

not arbitrable unless a federal law expressly provides an exemption.” 275

129, Specifically, the Respondent argues that this dispute is to be settled in the Moscow
Arbitrazh Court pursuant to Article 35 of the 2002 Arbitrazh Procedure Code.2 Article
4(6) of that Code authorises parties to displace the jurisdiction of the arbitrazh courts by
virtue of an arbitration agreement only if the dispute arises out of civil law relations,
which, according to Professor Asoskov, are relations based on the principle of

coordination, as opposed to public law relations, which are based on the principle of

£;

taxation tax and bankruptcy issues, arises out
of public law relations and thus cannot be referred to arbitration.” The consequence is
that, according to the Constitutional Court, “the current legal system does not permit the
arbitration of disputes arising out of administrative and other public law relations” unless
there is a derogation provided by federal law.?®° Professor Stephan’s response is that “‘do
not allow’ is not the same as ‘forbid’.”?®! The Respondent cites a decision of the Supreme
Arbitrazh Court and commentary in support, but accepts that there is no case holding that
a claim based on the breach of an investment treaty is not arbitrable in Russia2®
Professor Stephan accepts that neither the Civil Procedure Code nor the Arbitrazh Code
contain any authorisation to refer disputes arising out of public law relations to arbitration,

but says that nor do they contain any “language of prohibition.”?*

130. The Respondent emphasizes that several laws on foreign investment, namely the 1991
Fundamentals of Legislation on Foreign Investments in the USSR (the “USSR
Fundamentals”), the 1991 Law on Foreign Investments in the RSFSR (the “1991 FI
Law”) and the 1999 Law on Foreign Investments in the Russian Federation (the “1999

law disputes.

under Russian law, foreign capital must be injected into “objects of entrepreneurial
activity” in the territory of the Russian Federation and result in a capital increase in the
Russian economy from foreign resources.*** The Loans do not meet these requirements
for a “foreign investment” as they “were in fact profits made by Yukos Oil Company’s
trading subsidiaries and other entities controlled by Yukos Oil Company” and failed to

involve any “injection of foreign capital into the Russian Federation.””6

132. In any event, the Respondent submits that the abovementioned laws “do not authorize the

submission of investment disputes arising out of public law relations to arbitration.””°”
Thus, both Article 43 of the USSR Fundamentals and Article 9 of the 1991 FI Law would
only allow investment disputes “arising out of civil law relations” to be submitted to
arbitration, whilst state courts would have jurisdiction over disputes regarding sovereign
acts or omissions unless (in the words of the 1991 FI Law) “another procedure is

established by an international treaty in force in the territory of the RSFSR.”?°

133. In like manner, according to Article 10 of the 1999 FI Law, investment disputes would

be arbitrable only “in accordance with international treaties of the Russian Federation and

its federal laws.”?°°

134, The Respondent argues that Article 10 of the 1999 FI Law itself “does not address the
issue of arbitrability,” as it merely “conditions an investor’s right to submit investment
disputes to arbitration on an international treaty or a federal law providing for such a
right."?°° The Respondent submits that “[n]o federal law has been enacted that authorises
the arbitration of disputes arising out of public law relations, including claims for
compensation based on allegedly unlawful taxation measures, enforcement measures

related to tax assessments or actions or omissions of State organs in bankruptcy

matters.”?°! The Respondent relies on Professor Asoskov’s evidence that Article 10 isa
“declaratory norm” or “blanket provision” which does not itself provide an independent
basis for resort to arbitration.2 The q is that, although the provision does not
prohibit arbitration, a claimant must be able to point to another federal law or treaty which
provides for the right to arbitrate.?? Where a treaty provides for arbitration, it must either
be ratified or (where provisionally applied) the treaty terms must be permitted by Russian
law2* The consequence is that, under current law, it is never possible to provide for
provisional application of an international treaty’s provision for investor-state dispute

settlement through arbitration.?95

135. The Respondent submits that the reference to treaties in force in the 1991 FI Law means
ratified treaties, consistent with the distinction in the VCLT between the entry into force
of a treaty and its provisional application,?°° while the references to an “international
treaty of the Russian Federation” in the 1999 Law means an international agreement
concluded by Russia,"” to which Russia had given consent to be bound.?* The ECT is
not, according to the Respondent, a treaty to which the Respondent has consented to be

bound.?”?

136. The Respondent submits that it does not matter at which time piecemeal provisional
application is assessed, since disputes such as the present dispute have always been non-
arbitrable. While states may have been free to change their law during the period of
provisional application, it was expected that “more of it [would become] provisionally

applicable over time.”3° Nevertheless, the Respondent submits that the question of

whether the Russian Federation consented to arbitration must be assessed by reference to

the 1991 FI Law in force when the ECT was signed.**!

137. The Respondent further argues that there are no federal laws that authorise arbitration of
the present dispute. Because the ECT, “through the renvoi to Russian federal law” in
Article 45(1), provides for arbitration only to the extent not inconsistent with Russian
federal laws, the ECT does not “establish another procedure for the resolution of
investment disputes”; such disputes are exclusively within the jurisdiction of domestic

courts,3

138. According to the Respondent, the provisions that the Claimant relies on “do not delegate
legislative power to the executive to derogate from the principle of non-arbitrability of
public law disputes,” but merely “refer to treaties that have been ratified by Parliament
through the enactment of a federal law, as Respondent’s consistent practice in the
conclusion of bilateral investment treaties confirms.”°> In other words, the laws on
foreign investment do not authorise the executive to submit the present dispute to

arbitration 34

139. The Respondent notes that it is a party to 57 bilateral investment treaties that were subject

IS

to ratification3°> The Russian ratification instruments regarding these BITs were

accompanied by explanatory notes, which the Respondent argues demonstrate that
*investor-State arbitration provisions ‘set out rules different from those provided for by

law’ within the meaning of Article 15(1)(a) FLIT, i.e., they derogate from federal

laws.”2°° The same position prevailed under the 1978 Law.°°7 According to the

ratification, they are inconsistent with Russian law.” The Respondent notes that none
of those BITs contained a provisional application clause (and all were ratified) and
suggests that there is accordingly “no ... practice” of the Russian Federation provisionally
applying investment treaties." The Respondent notes that Professor Stephan testified
that he was not aware of any investment treaty that was not subject to ratification at the
international level: that is, that contemplated an ultimate method of consent and going

into force other than through ratification.3!°

140. In the context of the ECT, the Respondent points out that the explanatory note prepared
by the Government as part of its attempt to persuade the State Duma to ratify the ECT
and relied on by the Claimant?" “does not express a view on whether arbitration under
Article 26 ECT, or the implementation of any other ECT provision, is inconsistent with
Russian law for purposes of Article 45(1) ECT.”?!?_ The Respondent submits that the
Claimant relies on a mistaken English translation of the explanatory note, which, when
properly translated, only states that Article 45(1) of the ECT (rather than the application
of the ECT in general) conformed with Russian law.3!? The Respondent points out that
Professor Stephan also accepted that, properly translated, the reference to “provisions on
provisional application” should refer to “provision” in the singular, and understood that

141. With regard to the Claimant’s quotation of the explanatory note that “[t]he provisions of
the ECT are consistent with Russian legislation,”?'* the Respondent claims that this has
been taken out of context.*'? The Respondent explains that there are three categories of
legislative treaties whose ratification is contemplated by Article 15(1)(a) of the FLIT,
namely, (i) treaties that require enacting federal laws to amend federal laws already in
existence, (ii) treaties that require adopting new federal laws for implementing non-self-
executing treaty provisions, and (iii) “treaties that provide for derogations from federal
laws applicable solely in specific relations with other Contracting States and their citizens
and nationals,” which do not require adopting new federal laws or amending existing
ones, instead being “appl[ied] directly in the Russian legal system and prevail[ing] over

inconsistent federal laws pursuant to Article 15(4) of the Constitution.”3!8

142. According to the Respondent, the explanatory note placed the ECT within the third
category of treaties, with the consequence that it did “not require the enactment of any
concessions or the adoption of any amendments” since if it “set out rules different from
those provided for by a law, the rules of the international treaty shall apply.”3!° The fact
that the ECT contained a number of provisions yet to be reflected in Russian legislation
was not an obstacle to ratification because legislation aligning Russian law with GATT
and WTO standards was in the process of being enacted.*° So the list of provisions relied
on by the Claimant does not list all those provisions inconsistent with federal law, but
rather contains a non-exhaustive list of provisions whose implementation will require the

enactment of new federal laws.??!

143. Article 26 falls into the category of ECT provisions that are inconsistent with federal law
but will, following ratification, prevail over that federal law.” So where the explanatory
note records that inconsistent provisions of the ECT would prevail over domestic law in

relations with other contracting parties pursuant to Article 15(4) of the Constitution, the

Respondent contends that this is a “post-ratification analysis” that does not address
whether the ECT is subject to ratification or contains provisions inconsistent with Russian
law in the absence of ratification;* in other words, the explanatory note does not discuss

whether ratification is required, but is based on the premise that it is.22

(b) The Claimant’s position

144. Asa starting point, the Claimant submits that the question is not — as the Respondent is
said to formulate it - whether individual treaty provisions are inconsistent with Russian
law in the abstract. Rather, the question is whether provisional application of such
individual provisions is inconsistent with Russian law25 The Claimant’s case is that
provisional application of Article 26 is not inconsistent with Russian law, either because
the executive had authority to commit the Russian Federation to provisional application
of the clause, or because the clause itself is not inconsistent with Russian law since the
relevant foreign investment statutes contemplate the submission of international

investment treaty disputes to arbitration.

145. The Claimant also stresses that “provisional application is an extraordinary thing” and an
exception to the separation of powers: that explains the requirement under Russian law
to submit provisionally-applied treaties to the State Duma within six months.?2° Thus,
provisional application in accordance with Article 25 of the VCLT means that a state
agrees to apply provisions of the treaty even though they require ratification and

implementing legislation to become part of domestic law.>27

146. As a preliminary matter, the Claimant argues that the burden of proof to show that the
provisional application of Article 26 of the ECT is inconsistent with Russian law is on
the Respondent, and that the Claimant is not under any obligation to show that the
arbitration of this dispute is consistent with Russian law.228 The Claimant asserts that,

under the ordinary meaning of “inconsistent with” “only a direct conflict with Russian

law existing at the time of the ECT’s signature . . . would satisfy the limitation in Article
45,” and that the Domestic Law Inconsistency Clause could do no more than “absolve[]
Respondent from an obligation to pass new legislation or modify existing legislation in
case of a direct conflict with ECT provisions.”2? The Claimant notes that this

“requirement of a positive conflict” is consistent with state practice.??°

147. Likewise, the Claimant contends that tribunals in investment treaty arbitrations also have

 

required “express prohibition under domestic law” in their determination of whether an

 

inconsistency exists between treaty provisions and domestic law.*3! The Claimant refers
to the decisions in Kardassopoulos,>>? Achmea v, Slovak Republic™ (“Achmea’),
Electrabel v. Hungary™ (“Electrabel”), and Khan Resources v. Mongolia® as authority
for this proposition. In other words, only where domestic law “forbids compliance” will
the necessary inconsistency exist — a vacuum is not sufficient.>2° With these decisions in
mind, the Claimant argues that the “Respondent fails to put forward any case to establish
that Russian law existing at the time of ECT signature forbade arbitration of investment
disputes or required Respondent to modify existing legislation — i.e., that a conflict
existed.”>9” The Claimant cites authority from the GATT context in support, arguing that
it was not the case that the Russian Federation had “no choice but to violate the treaty.”>*
So, where domestic law offers only one form of recourse, but the treaty provides an

alternative, then provisional application will enable the claimant to take advantage of the

treaty procedure,>9

148. To the contrary, the Claimant points out that the Respondent sought to ratify the ECT in
the State Duma of the Russian Federal Assembly, and that during that ratification process,
the government of Russia made a “determination” (albeit not on the international plane™°)
confirming that “[t]he provisions of the ECT are consistent with Russian legislation.”*4!
The Claimant submits that the drafter of that note listed the provisions of the ECT that

were in conflict with Russian law, and did not include Article 26.3%

149, The Claimant submits that “Article 26 ECT is not inconsistent with Russian law,”3*? since
“[tJreaties become incorporated into Russian law at the time of expression of valid
consent,” even without an incorporating act.>4 The Claimant maintains that this also
holds true for treaties applied provisionally, as is the case with the ECT.3° The Claimant
argues that an inconsistency between international treaties and Russian domestic law
“cannot exist as a matter of Russian law,” since the terms of international treaties would

“apply in lieu of the rules provided by domestic law.”?6

Contrary to allegations made by the Respondent,**” the Claimant contends that it is not
“conflating provisional application with final entry into force,” but “simply set[ting] out
the implications of a treaty mechanism that Russia cannot deny it has consented to by its
signature.”*“8 The Claimant quotes from a Resolution of the Constitutional Court to
support the proposition that “[a]greement to provisional application of an international
treaty means that it ... must be applied on the same basis as international treaties that
have entered into force ... since otherwise, provisional application would be
meaningless.”*? Further, the Claimant quotes the Russian delegate in the context of the

ECT negotiations as understanding that there would be a “period of provisional

application of the Treaty [that] would be a sort of running in period of the implementation

of this most important instrument for international cooperation.”>°

Against the Respondent’s arguments as to why Russia was not bound, the Claimant notes
that “a provisionally applicable treaty is binding and constitutes a legally enforceable
instrument among signatory states,” citing the ILC Commentary to Article 25 of the
VCLT.*5! The Claimant considers “irrelevant” the fact that President Yeltsin did not sign
the ECT himself? noting that the Constitution grants the President the authority to
express consent to be bound to treaties, and that the signature of a duly authorized
representative of the president “is equivalent to the President’s personal signature.”355
The Claimant notes that no part of its case rests on an assumption that President Yeltsin
himself signed the ECT.2%4

The Claimant also contends that the Respondent “conflates international ratification with
domestic consent to ratification.”*5> The Claimant cites Professor Stephan as authority
for the proposition that “ratification of a treaty is an international process and occurs only
when a treaty party renders the relevant documentation as specified by the treaty,” noting
that in the case of Russia the tive renders such d ion, not the legis! o08
The Claimant adds that Russian law does not require legislative domestic ratification of
all treaties and that “Russian law indisputably provides for provisional application of
treaties with signature in advance of, and thus independent of, subsequent domestic

ratification.”>57

53. Furthermore, the Claimant takes issue with the Respondent’s argument that the ECT

Secretariat’s desire to see Russia’s ratification of the ECT is evidence that the Secretariat

recognized that “provisional application did not impose on Respondent the same

obligations as ratification,”*** proposing instead that the Secretariat wanted Russia to

ratify the ECT in order to affirm Russia’s political commitment and to increase the treaty

regime’s legal certainty and stability.

154. According to the Claimant, a signatory commits to provisional application of all treaty

360

provisions to which that signing authority can commit the state. The executive branch

has authority under Article 86 of the Constitution to negotiate and sign treaties.**' When
a treaty provides for signature to have the effect of accepting a binding obligation, the
Russian Federation is bound by that. The executive is empowered to determine
whether to agree to provisional application and therefore commit Russia to so apply a
treaty.° None of those propositions are said to be disputed. The only limitation,
according to the Claimant, is that the executive may not agree to the provisional

application of provisions that violate the Constitution itself.>%

155. This is because, the Claimant submits, Article 23 of the FLIT empowers the executive to
commit to the provisional application of treaty provisions that conflict with domestic law
provided that the treaty so provides.*® The Claimant cites a number of commentaries
which opine that the purpose of provisional application is to apply a treaty immediately
pending the fulfillment of specific procedures required for its entry into force (usually
ratification),*® and rejects Professor Asoskov’s contention that these are a minority view

in the absence of any dissenting commentary on the record.°6”

156. The Claimant also submits that in the only Russian decision on the record which addresses
this point — the Lufthansa case — the court simply applies the treaty without regard to
whether its provisions are consistent with domestic law,>** while the decisions on which
Professor Asoskov relies for the proposition that only ratified treaties can prevail over
federal law do not concern provisional application. Professor Stephan testified that the
Chinese trespassers case involved a treaty that had been brought into legal effect by an
exchange of notes, and did not provide for provisional application. In that context, the
court’s decision was that the exchange of notes did not substitute for ratification.” The
Claimant also put to Professor Asoskov a Council of Europe document which records the
Russian Federation’s statement that provisional application of a treaty is possible if the

treaty so provides; Professor Asoskov’s opinion was that the response was incomplete.>7!

158. The consequence is that when the executive agrees to provisional application then the
terms of the treaty become part of Russian law and are enforced as if the treaty were in
force pursuant to Article 15(4) of the Constitution.375

159. The Claimant submits that if (as is not disputed) the executive can commit the Russian
Federation to provisionally apply a treaty that determines territorial boundaries (including
one that is required to be ratified by Article 15(3) of the FLIT), it is “inconceivable” that

it would not have the power to commit the state to arbitrate with an investor.3”

160. The Claimant accordingly rejects Professor Asoskov’s “hierarchy argument,” according
to which a treaty in force in the Russian Federation that has not been ratified is
subordinate to federal laws. The Claimant submits that none of the authorities on which
Professor Asoskov bases this theory concerns provisional application. The “whole point”
is that a provisionally applied treaty is applied as if it is in force,>”’ and it assumes the
same hierarchy as if it were in force.>” Professor Asoskov’s distinction between the
authority of the Government and that of the President is beside the point, since although
executive acts are subordinate to legislative acts the effect of provisional application is to
apply the treaty as if it had been ratified.37?

161. On the subject of whether Article 26 is in fact inconsistent with any provisions of Russian
law, the Claimant rejects the Respondent’s contention that “disputes about taxes, their
enforcement and bankruptcy .. . cannot be arbitrated.” It says this is relevant only for
“arbitration in Russia within its domestic legal system,” but not with regard to rights

arising under a treaty and interpreted according to public international law.>®°

162. So, the Claimant disputes the Respondent’s reliance on Professor Asoskov’s theory of
“the principle of non-arbitrability of public law disputes as a fundamental aspect of the

Russian law.”38! The Claimant quotes Professor Stephan, arguing that Professor

Asoskov’s “authorities involve only the interpretation of particular legislation, and do not
indicate the existence of any broader principle barring the Russian Federation from
submitting to binding arbitration.”>*? The Claimant insists that Professor Asoskov makes
a “misleading point” when he asserts*® that certain disputes — concerning the assessment
and collection of taxes and tax sanctions, the enforcement of tax authorities’ decisions
and the bankruptcy of Russian legal entities — must be resolved in Russian courts.384 The
Claimant maintains that the present dispute does not concern such matters: the Claimant
is not “asking the Tribunal to try a bankruptcy case” or any of the other kinds of case
dealt with in the laws on which Professor Asoskov relies.*#° The present dispute does not
arise in the context of a relationship of subordination, but under a multilateral investment
treaty,38° and the Claimant alleges that Professor Asoskov has no authority for the
extension of that principle to public international law disputes.28’ Under cross-
examination, Professor Asoskov accepted that none of the first four examples of disputes
falling within the principle of non-arbitrability involved a dispute under public

international law arising from a treaty entered into between states.**

163. Thus “[tJhe fact that Russian public authorities used sovereign powers when effecting
their expropriatory objectives does not disqualify this dispute as an investment dispute
arbitrable under international law or somehow entrust its resolution to the Russian
domestic legal order/system.”>®? Rather, the Claimant quotes Professor Stephan to make
the point that the fact that Russia took measures “in [the] exercise of its public authority”

makes this dispute arbitrable rather than precluding it>°°

164. On the contrary, and citing Professor Stephan’s interpretation of the USSR Fundamentals,
the 1991 FI Law and the 1999 FI Law, the Claimant argues that “Russian law positively

recognizes that disputes under public international law instruments may be resolved by

165.

a

So, the 1999 FI Law provides that such disputes may be arbitrated, “if the treaty says
so.”5% So far as the 1991 FI Law refers to treaties “in force,” the Claimant’s answer is
that provisionally applied treaties are applied as if they are in force.>® It is on this basis
that the Claimant argues that, even if the executive was not empowered to commit the
Russian Federation to treaty provisions that conflicted with federal law, the foreign
investment laws do in fact contemplate the submission of disputes such as the present one
to arbitration and, therefore, there is no inconsistency. In other words, the reference to
“treaty” in those laws includes provisionally applied treaties*” and in those circumstances

there is “by definition, a consistency.”37

166. The Claimant also relies on Professor Asoskov’s opinion that the law on production
sharing agreements authorizes arbitration, and submits that the language of the foreign

investment laws is identical?

167. The Claimant also disputes the Respondent’s arguments regarding Article 23(2) of the
FLIT, which requires that treaties that are provisionally applied be sent to the State Duma
for ratification within six months of being signed.*°° The Claimant argues that “Article
26 ECT did not require the amendment or supplementation of existing Russian law,” as
it “became part of Russian law by operation of the Russian Constitution.“ Additionally,
the Claimant maintains that Article 23(2) of the FLIT did not exist at the time that the
ECT was signed by the Respondent and cannot be applied retroactively, since such

Article 27 of the VCLT.*"

168. In any event, the Claimant explains that, contrary to the Respondent’s position, Article
23(2) recognizes that the termination of the provisional application of treaties operates by
notification to other Contracting States, a fact that was also appreciated by the Respondent
when it “communicat{ed] its termination of provisional application by a notification to

proposition via references to Professor Stephan’s first report,“®? a note the Respondent

169. With regard to the Respondent’s arguments based on Article 12 of the USSR FLIT,“° the
Claimant submits that this law is not applicable, as it is in conflict with the Constitution.°”
Even so, the Claimant maintains that the USSR FLIT did not preclude the provisional

application of treaties.‘°

170. With respect to other treaty practice, the Claimant rejects the Respondent’s contention
that eight explanatory notes drawn from 57 BITs in force confirm that investor-state
arbitration provisions set out rules different from those provided by law and therefore are
subject to ratification.“? The Claimant argues that these explanatory notes are irrelevant,

as the only relevant time is December 1994 and the only relevant inconsistency’

a provision for provisional application, meaning that, in those cases, Russia would have
to ratify the treaties in order to be bound.*'’ Moreover, according to the Claimant, “most
of the BITs concerned legislation that did not exist at the time of the ECT’s signature.”*!
The Claimant rejects the relevance of the authorities cited by Professor Asoskov to
support the proposition that Article 26 of the ECT is inconsistent with Russian law,*"?
contending that these authorities deal with “unratified treaties having no provisional
application clause that include rules conflicting with existing legislation,” compared with
the current arbitration, which involves the ECT, “a treaty with a provisional application
clause that has no rules conflicting with Russian investment legislation.”*"* For the
Claimant, Russian domestic law states that international treaties may be applied
provisionally “if the treaty itself so provides” and that decisions on provisional
application by the Russian Federation “shall be made by the body that has taken the
decision to sign the ii ional treaty Jing to the procedure set out in Article 11 of
this Federal Law.”*!5

 

171.

The Claimant also takes issue with the Respondent’s argument“!® that there was not a
“pre-existing legal basis” in Russian law for the application of Article 26 because there
were no investment treaties in force between Russia and 21 ECT contracting states.”
The Claimant contends that the Respondent has not offered any support for the notion
that there is a requirement that there must be a pre-existing legal basis for international
obligations that states voluntarily assume, and notes that, even if valid, the principle does

not establish any “inconsistency.”4!8

acts or omissions.”*”° The Claimant submits that the Respondent did have BITs with
other ECT contracting states that provided for settlement of investment disputes via
arbitration, including the France-USSR BIT.?! The Claimant also notes that a Model
BIT approved by Resolution of the Government of the Russian Federation in 1992
provides for the settlement of investment disputes by arbitration without limitations

regarding civil law issues.‘”*

173. Finally, the Claimant argues that, if a state decides to invoke the Domestic Law
Inconsistency Clause, it must do so in good faith.4#? According to the Claimant, the
Respondent has not done so, as its “‘inconsistency’ arguments are contrived with the aim

to escape accountability for its actions.”**

3. The Tribunal’s analysis

(a) Introduction

174. The Tribunal considers that the issue that arises for its decision under this head is:

Did Russia’s provisional application of the ECT “to the extent that such provisional

ion is not i i with its itution, laws or ” under the

terms of Article 45(1) include its consent to international arbitration under Article
26(3)(a)?

175. The answer to this issue turns on the question whether the application of Article 26 is “not
inconsistent with” Russia’s “constitution, laws or regulations”, since the Respondent

accepts that, if there were no such inconsistency, there would be a treaty obligation

assumed by the Respondent to apply that provision on a provisional basis.‘

176. The Tribunal is conscious of the fact that this issue is one that has generated differing

views in the jurisprudence‘?

and difficulty in the doctrine.4?” While remaining fully
cognizant of the reasoning set forth in the decisions of other tribunals and of those
publicists that have been cited to it, this Tribunal approaches the issue, as it is bound to
do, in accordance with its power and duty to decide for itself upon its own jurisdiction.
It addresses the question independently in the light of the evidence presented by the

Parties before it and of the applicable law as it finds it to be,

177. The Tribunal will assess the question whether its jurisdiction has been established by
reference to the law applicable at the time of the institution of proceedings, namely 15
February 2013, being the date on which the Claimant claimed to accept Russia’s consent
to arbitration of the present dispute. Such approach is in conformity with the constant

practice of international courts and tribunals.*?8

178. This rule is also important in the present case in view of the nature of provisional
application. Both Parties accept that states that have entered into a treaty that they have
agreed will be provisionally applied “to the extent that such provisional application is not
inconsistent” with domestic law may progressively remove any such inconsistencies
during the period of provisional application.‘”? As a result, the material time at which to
determine whether the rule in Article 26 of the ECT is “not inconsistent with” Russian

law is the time at which the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is invoked.
179. The Tribunal analyses the issue in the following sections:

(a) Section (b) analyses the proper interpretation of the regime of provisional
application under Article 45 of the ECT in accordance with the general rule of
interpretation set forth in Article 31(1) of the VCLT.

(b) Section (c) considers that regime against the background of the institution of
provisional application in general i ional law (p to Article 31(3)(c)
of the VCLT).

(c) Section (d) examines relevant practice of the ECT States at the conclusion of
the Treaty (Article 31(2)) and the preparatory materials for the Treaty (Article
32) as to the construction of Article 45.

(d) Section (e) considers the evidence as to Russian practice under the ECT.

(e) Section (f) addresses the extent to which Article 26 is “not inconsistent” with

Russian law.

(b) The regime of provisional application under the ECT

180. It is common ground that the basis for jurisdiction of the present Tribunal that is invoked
by the Claimant depends in the first instance upon the proper construction of the regime
for provisional application of the ECT set forth in its Article 45. The Claimant brings its
claim solely for alleged breach of rights contained in the ECT. It claims a right to choose
to settle its dispute with the Respondent pursuant to the dispute settlement provisions of
Article 26(2)(c) of the ECT, which includes submission to an arbitral tribunal under
UNCITRAL Rules under Article 26(4)(b). It relies in particular upon the unconditional
consent of the Respondent as a contracting party to international arbitration under Article
26(3)(a).

181. In view of the fact that Russia signed the ECT, but did not in the event decide to ratify it,
the question whether it has consented to arbitration under Article 26 must be determined
on the basis of the meaning and effect to be given to the provisions of Article 45 of the

ECT, which prescribe a detailed regime for its provisional application.

182. Although this Article has been set out earlier in this Decision, it is necessary to repeat the

terms of its paragraphs (1)-(3) for clarity of the analysis that is to follow:**°

 

430 Pursuant to ECT, Art. 50, the Treaty was signed in English and six other official languages “of which every
text is equally authentic”. The Parties agreed that the language of this arbitration is English: Terms of Appointment,
para. 6(a). Neither Party submits or advances evidence that there is any material difference between the English
text and the texts in the other official languages in which the ECT was concluded. The Respondent submits: “The

Article 45—Provisional Application

(1) Each signatory agrees to apply this Treaty provisionally pending its entry
into force for such signatory in accordance with Article 44, to the extent
that such provisional ication is not it is with its itutis
laws or regulations.

 

(2) (a) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) any signatory may, when signing, deliver
to the Depository a declaration that it is not able to accept provisional
application, The obligation contained in paragraph (1) shall not apply
toa signatory making such a declaration. Any such signatory may at any
time withdraw that declaration by written notification to the Depository.

(b) Neither a signatory which makes a declaration in accordance with
subparagraph (a) nor Investors of that signatory may claim the benefits
of provisional application under paragraph (1).

(¢

Notwithstanding subparagraph (a), any signatory making a declaration
referred to in subparagraph (a) shall apply Part VII provisionally
pending the entry into force of the Treaty for such signatory in
accordance with Article 44, to the extent that such provisional
application is not inconsistent with its laws or regulations,

(3) @) Any signatory may terminate its provisional application of this Treaty
by written notification to the Depository of its intention not to become
a Contracting Party to the Treaty. Termination of provisional application
for any signatory shall take effect upon the expiration of 60 days from
the date on which such signatory’s written notification is received by the
Depository.

(b) In the event that a signatory terminates provisional application under
subparagraph (a), the obligation of the signatory under paragraph (1) to
apply Parts Il and V with respect to any Investments made in its Area
during such provisional application by Investors of other signatories shall
nevertheless remain in effect with respect to those Investments for twenty
years following the effective date of termination, except as otherwise
provided in subparagraph (c).

(

&

Subparagraph (b) shall not apply to any signatory listed in Annex PA. A
signatory shall be removed from the list in Annex PA effective upon
delivery to the Depository of its request therefor.

183. The Respondent's objection and the submissions of the Parties have focused on the proper
construction of the final clause of Article 45(1), the Domestic Law Inconsistency Clause.
By this clause, each signatory agrees to apply the Treaty provisionally prior to its entry
into force for it “to the extent that such provisional application is not inconsistent with its

constitution, laws or regulations.”

ordinary meaning of the ‘to the extent’ clause in the other authentic language versions of the ECT is to the same
effect”: Memorial, para, 38,

184. The Tribunal approaches the task of interpreting Article 45(1) in the light of the general
tule of treaty interpretation prescribed in Article 31 of the VCLT. This rule, which is
accepted to be a statement of the customary international law rule of interpretation, was
also expressly accepted by way of the declaration of a number of delegations (including
Russia) at the Adoption Session of the ECT as supplying the relevant rules of
interpretation for the ECT."' It will be necessary to refer to a number of the elements

identified in Article 31 as relevant to interpretation.

185. The point of departure is Article 31(1), which requires interpretation “in good faith in
accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their
context and in the light of its object and purpose.” Article 31(2) provides that the first

element in the “context” is “the text, including its preamble and annexes.”
186. Analysis of the text enables the following initial points to be made.

187. The Final Provisions of the ECT set forth in Part VIII draw a clear distinction between
two types of unilateral acts by states which are to have legal consequences on the plane
of international law: (i) signature of the Treaty under Article 38 by those States which
have signed the Energy Charter; and (ii) ratification, acceptance or approval by those
States under Article 39. That Article does not itself specify the consequences that flow

from the act of signature.

188. The Treaty’s entry into force — generally and in respect of any particular state — is
determined by reference to ratification, acceptance or approval under Article 44 “Entry

into Force.”

189. Article 45 “Provisional Application” immediately follows the provision on entry into
force. It introduces a separate form of legal obligation. This obligation is assumed by
“[e]ach signatory”; that is to say, a state that has signed the Treaty in accordance with
Article 38. Such signatory “agrees to apply this Treaty provisionally pending its entry
into force for such signatory in accordance with Article 44, to the extent that such

provisional application is not inconsistent with its constitution, laws or regulations.”

Paragraph (1) could thus be described as determining the scope of provisional application

ratione materiae.

190. The ensuing paragraphs (2) and (3) of Article 45 establish a specific regime governing

the scope of provisional application ratione personae and ratione temporis.

191,

Ratione personae. Article 45(2) permits a signatory to deposit a declaration upon
signature “that it is not able to accept provisional application.” Such a declaration
produces a legal effect on both the burdens and the benefits of provisional application

ratione personae:

(a) It is effective to disapply the regime of provisional application generally in
respect of that signatory: Article 45(2)(a).

(b) It also precludes both that signatory and its Investors from claiming the benefits

of provisional application: Article 45(2)(b).

192. Ratione temporis. Article 45(3) enables a signatory to terminate provisional application
upon notification of its intention not to become a contracting party to the Treaty. It adds

two provisions as to the effect of such a notification ratione temporis:

(a) Termination of provisional application does not take effect until 60 days after

receipt of notification by the Depositary: Article 45(3)(a).

(b) In the event of such a termination, the obligation of the signatory under
paragraph (1) to apply Parts III (“Investment Promotion and Protection”) and V
(“Dispute Settlement”) “with respect to any Investments made in its Area during
such provisional application by Investors of other signatories” remains in effect
for those Investments for 20 years following the effective date of termination:
Article 45(3)(b).

193, Each signatory had the option upon conclusion of the Treaty not to accept the obligation
in Article 45(3)(b) by entering its name on the list in Annex PA: Article 45(3)(c).

194. Provisional application generally under Article 45. This initial review of Article 45(1)—

(3) permits the following five preliminary observations about the scheme of the Treaty

Case 1:22-cv-00798 Document 1-2 Filed 03/23/22 Page 441 of 598

PCA Case No. 2013-31
Interim Award on Jurisdiction
Page 73 of 195

vis-a-vis its provisional application (subject always to the effect of the Domestic Law

Inconsistency Clause, to the construction of which the Tribunal will turn shortly).

195. First, the signatories expressly contemplated that, by signing the ECT, they were
engaging in a set of mutual legal rights and obligations to apply the Treaty provisionally
in accordance with its terms prior to its entry into force. The regime of provisional
application contemplated by Article 45 is therefore separate and distinct from the legal
relations between the Contracting Parties that will apply upon entry into force following
ratification. The Domestic Law Inconsistency Clause in Article 45(1), which refers to
“such provisional application” as being “not inconsistent with its constitution, laws or
regulations” is a reference to the inconsistency with domestic law of the regime of
provisional application created by virtue of Article 45. It does not relate to the

requirements of domestic law applicable to the entry into force of a treaty.

196. Second, the concept of provisional application contemplated by Article 45 cannot be
regarded as purely moral or a matter of diplomatic courtesy or option. It denotes a state
of affairs intended to operate and produce legal effects. This is confirmed both by the
ordinary meaning of the words used in paragraph (1) and the context of the other

paragraphs of Article 45.

197. The Oxford English Dictionary defines “application” as “the action of putting something
into operation” and “provisional” as “arranged or existing for the present, possibly to be
changed later.”#?2 When these two concepts are put together, they refer to a state of affairs
that, while it may be subject to later change, nevertheless exists and is in operation for the

present.

198. This construction of provisional application under Article 45(1) as producing legal
obligations prior to entry into force is further supported by reference to Article 45(3)(b).
This sub-paragraph speaks of “the obligation of the signatory” under Parts III and V

following a termination of provisional application remaining in effect for 20 years.

199. Parts III and V create legal obligations under international law dealing ratione materiae

with (a) substantive rights of investors and (b) dispute settlement:

(a) Part III creates legal obligations under international law to afford investment
promotion, protection and treatment of investments. Its obligations are
expressed in terms that are mandatory and contemplate legal process. So, for
example, Article 13 “Expropriation” provides that investments “shall not be
nationalized [or] expropriated” save under the conditions there specified. These
include that the expropriation be “carried out under due process of law” (Article
13(1)(c)) and that the investor has “a right to prompt review, under the law of
the Contracting Party making the Expropriation by a judicial or other competent
and independent authority” (Article 13(2)).

(b) Part V confirms “unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to

 

international arbitration” (Article 26(3)(a)). It provides that the tribunal so
established “shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Treaty
and applicable rules and principles of international law” (Article 26(6)); that the
resulting awards “shall be final and binding” (Article 26(8)).

200. Third, the signatories contemplate that the obligations arising for them upon signature by

201.

way of provisional application include obligations vis-a-vis Investors. Article 45(3)(b)
expressly refers to the continued application of Parts ITI and V. Since Article 45(3)(b)
speaks of the obligation of the signatory under these Parts “remain{ing] in effect” for 20
years after a signatory’s termination, it follows that the signatory’s obligations to
Investors under Parts III and V are already in effect, having arisen upon signature as a
matter of provisional application, provided always that such application was ab initio not
inconsistent with the domestic laws of the signatory state. This notwithstanding that both
Parts III and V constantly refer to “Contracting Parties” — an expression defined as “a
state ... which has consented to be bound by this Treaty and for which the Treaty is in
force”: Article 1(2).

The conclusion that provisional application is capable of applying to the obligations of
States to Investors is further reinforced by the express reference to Investors in Article
45(2). This reference would be unnecessary if provisional application could not apply to

create legal duties of states to Investors. It is only because provisional application

Case 1:22-cv-00798 Document 1-2 Filed 03/23/22 Page 443 of 598

otherwise is capable of so applying that it is necessary to confirm expressly that when a
State opts out of the regime under Article 45(2), it is relieved from the obligation of
provisional application and neither it nor its Investors may take the benefit of it vis-4-vis

other signatories.

Fourth, the provisional application regime is designed to apply, if necessary, over a long

 

period of time. Absent prior termination, the provisional application of the Treaty applies
until its entry into force for that signatory. The cumulative entry-into-force provisions of
Article 44 entail two 90-day periods: after collective ratification of at least 30 states and

following individual ratification.

Further, and crucially, the ability that the negotiating states created for a signatory to
decide to opt out of the provisional application regime altogether after signature upon its
decision not to become a party to the Treaty does not enable such a state to avoid the
obligations of Parts III and V in respect of investments made during the period of
provisional application for 20 years after termination: Article 45(3)(b). The import of
this provision is clear. Investments made during the period in which the ECT is
provisionally applied in respect of a particular State and prior to any decision on the part
of that State not to be become a party are (again subject to the domestic inconsistency
clause) entitled to extended treaty protection. A signatory State may not encourage such
investment by provisional application and then, by terminating provisional application,
divest such investments already made during the period of provisional application of the

treaty protections.

Fifth, in recognition of the potentially onerous nature of the obligations upon signatories

arising by virtue of the Treaty’s provisional application (not least those of Article
45(3)(b)), Article 45 makes liberal provision for any State to opt out of the regime
altogether upon signature. This it may do by the simple expedient of a declaration under
Article 45(2).4 Such a declaration places the declaring State in the same position that it
would be in upon signature under any other treaty that requires ratification. It excludes

any possibility of provisional application. At the same time, it excludes the declaring

433 gome States also declared that they would not apply the Treaty provisionally under Art. 45(1): Austria,
Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, Romania and Turkey. See Updated List of Signatories to the ECT (1 March
1995) (“Updated Signatories List”) (Exhibit C-144).

State and its Investors from any of the benefits of provisional application that would
otherwise be opposable to other signatory States. Neither the declaring State nor its
Investors can share in any of the benefits of the Treaty until its entry into force for that
state under Article 44,

Further, a signatory also had the option upon signature (but not thereafter) to exclude the
long tail provision in Article 45(3)(b), by entering its name on the list in Annex PA.

The Domestic Law Inconsistency Clause. Against this background, it is now possible to
return to consideration of the Domestic Law Inconsistency Clause in Article 45(1) within
the framework of the general rule of interpretation in Article 31(1) of the VCLT. The

following preliminary observations may be made:

(a) Each part of clause (1) must be interpreted in good faith. This means that the
Tribunal must seek to give an effective meaning to the agreement of “[eJach
signatory ... to apply this Treaty provisionally pending its entry into force for
such signatory” as well as to the proviso to that agreement “to the extent that
such provisional application is not inconsistent with its constitution, laws or
regulations.” An interpretation that would be so broad as to empty either the
positive agreement of the relevant signatory or the Domestic Law Inconsistency
Clause of any effect would not be consistent with an interpretation of the terms
of Article 45(1) in good faith.

(b) Such a signatory also has the option, without restriction, upon signature of
delivering a declaration excluding the operation of provisional application of
the ECT altogether under Article 45(2). The proviso to Article 45(1) must be
given a meaning that preserves a distinct sphere of operation for it in contrast to
the making of a declaration under Article 45(2). This is particularly so since
both legal acts are to be undertaken by the same person on behalf of the same

State at the same time.

(c) The Clause contains an express renvoi to domestic law. Its terms require any
person seeking to understand the nature and scope of the obligations assumed
by a particular signatory State by way of provisional application to consider that

State’s “constitution, laws or regulations” in order to satisfy themselves as to

 

Case 1:22-cv-00798 Document 1-2 Filed 03/23/22 Page 445 of 598

PCA Case No. 2013-31
Interim Award on Jurisdiction
Page 77 of 195

whether, and if so to what extent, the proviso applies to qualify the obligation.
Nevertheless, this does not change the character of the obligation assumed by
each signatory State under Article 45(1) as an obligation that is governed by
international law. Domestic law is relevant because the international law
obligation so provides and then only to that extent. Article 45(1) does not
operate to convert a signatory’s international law obligation into one of its own

domestic law.

(d) The agreement to provisional application in Article 45(1) is one that is made by
asignatory. The question whether provisional application as a consequence of
such an agreement is “not inconsistent with [a State’s] constitution, laws or
regulations” must be determined by reference to whether, under the
constitution, laws or regulations of the relevant State, an obligation of
provisional application assumed by a signatory infringes the proviso. This is a
question that is separate from the provisions of a State’s constitution or laws

relating to the ratification of a treaty for the purpose of its entry into force.

(e) The signatory’s agreement is framed as giving rise to a positive obligation of
the State. By contrast, the proviso is limited in two ways. First, it requires
consideration of “the extent” to which provisional application is subject to
domestic inconsistency. Second, the proviso is formulated as a double negative:
“not inconsistent.” The signatory agrees to give the Treaty provisional
application, provided that such application does not give rise to an inconsistency
with domestic law. The burden is on the signatory State invoking such an

inconsistency to establish it.

207. “Not inconsistent with.” The ordinary meaning of the words “not inconsistent with”
requires careful consideration. The expression connects two sets of legal rules: (i) those
assumed by each signatory under international law by way of provisional application of
the Treaty and (ii) those under the signatory’s “constitution, laws or regulations.” It is
necessary to analyse the relation between these two sets of legal obligations required by

the connecting phrase. This is defined by reference to two cumulative elements: the to

be determined by reference to lack of consistency and the use of the double negative form:

“not inconsistent with.”

The Oxford English Dictionary" offers the following relevant definition of “consistent”

as “[a]greeing or according in substance or form; congruous, compatible.” It defines

” as “[nJot isting; not ing in spirit, or form: not in
keeping; not consonant or in accordance; at variance, discordant, incompatible,
incongruous.” Collins English Dictionary*™ defines inconsistent relevantly as “lacking
in consistency, agreement, or compatibility; at variance.” It also adds a meaning
applicable to a set of propositions in logic: “enabling an explicit contradiction to be

validly derived.”

The relation of compatibility required is affected by the use of the double negative form
“not inconsistent with.” A number of the examples given in the Oxford English
Dictionary of the historical usage of “inconsistent” use it in its double negative form:
“[rJesentment is not inconsistent with Good-will”; “[t]he benevolence of God ... is not
inconsistent with his determination to punish.” In these examples, the double negative is
used to contrast two things that are not the same. They may have quite different content.
Yet they may also be regarded as not inconsistent, since they may each exist side-by-side

without coming into conflict between each other.

The use of the double negative form denotes in the first place a point about burden of
proof: that the burden is on the party that wishes to establish inconsistency, rather than
imposing a burden on the party that wishes to rely on the positive obligation to establish
that it is consistent with the proviso. It also conveys a substantive element of the relation
between the positive obligation and the proviso. A requirement that the positive
obligation be consistent with the proviso might be said to denote complete identity or
conformity between the two sets of legal obligations in question. By contrast, the purpose

of the requirement that the positive obligation be not inconsistent with the domestic law

proviso is to prevent a clash between the two systems, even if they differ in material

respects.437

211. This consideration of the ordinary meaning of the phrase “not inconsistent with” enables
the following conclusions to be drawn as to its ordinary meaning in the context of Article
45(1):

(a) The relation that is contemplated is not one of equivalence between the two sets
of legal obligations referred to Article 45(1). It does not require the obligations
existing in one such set to exist also in the other. Nor does it require the
obligations existing in one set to be expressly authorized or permitted by the
rules of the other set. Rather the use of the term “not inconsistent” asks a
different question. It is whether (and if so to what extent) the two bodies of law
can live together: are they “compatible” or are they “discordant”? The enquiry
that the interpreter is directed to undertake is one that requires identification of

conflict, if any, between the two systems, rather than identity or equivalence.

(b) The double negative form “not inconsistent with” in both ordinary and legal
usage denotes both: (i) that the burden is on the party alleging the inconsistency
to establish it; and (ii) that the extent of consistency required in the relation
between the two sets of legal obligations is one that “prevents clashes” rather

than one that “ensures conformity.”

212. As will be seen, these conclusions are also supported by the manner in which the law has

approached the use of the same or similar tests in other cognate areas of international law.

(c) Provisional application in international law

213. The regime for the provisional application of the ECT under its Article 45 has a number
of distinctive features. Yet provisional application is itself a well recognised institution
in general international law, to which the Tribunal is directed by Article 31(3)(c) of the
VCLT to refer in its interpretation of Article 45 of the ECT.

application of treaties finds express recognition in Article 25 of the VCLT which
provides:
Article 25—Provisional application

(1) A treaty or part of treaty is applied provisionally pending its entry into force
if:

{a) the treaty so provides; or
(b) the negotiating States have in some other manner so agreed.

Q

v

Unless the treaty otherwise provides or the negotiating States have otherwise
agreed, the provisional application of a treaty or part of a treaty with respect
to a State shall be terminated if that State notifies the other States between
which the treaty is being applied provisionally of its intention not to become
a party to the treaty.

Article 25 is found in Part II of the VCLT “Conclusion and Entry into Force of Treaties,”
Section 3 of which deals in particular with “Entry into Force and Provisional Application
of Treaties.” This Section precedes Part III, which, under the heading “Observance,
Application and Interpretation of Treaties,” deals in its Section 1 with the obligation upon

parties to observe a treaty that is in force.

Part II Section 3 distinguishes between “Entry into force,” which is provided for in Article
24 and “Provisional application” in Article 25. A treaty enters into force “in such manner
and upon such date as it may provide or as the negotiating States may agree,” failing
which it is determined by reference to the consent of the states to be bound. Where the
treaty so provides, entry into force requires the deposit of instruments of ratification,
approval or accession.**® By contrast, provisional application takes effect pending the
entry into force of the treaty. It suffices for this purpose that the treaty itself so provides
or that the negotiating states have so agreed.

Article 25 of the VCLT reflects the extensive practice of states. The final clauses of the
two treaties comprising the Peace of Westphalia 1648 provided that, notwithstanding the

requirement for ratification, the substantive provisions were to be carried out as soon as

possible after signature and to the extent practicable before ratification." There is much

subsequent practice over the ensuing three centuries.

Of particular note is the GATT, which was subject to provisional application under a
Protocol of Provisional Application for nearly 50 years from 1947 until the adoption of
the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the WTO in 1994.“ The provisional application
of the GATT between the Parties included Articles XXII and XXIII, which formed the
source of the signatory states’ consent to the international settlement of disputes by GATT

panels.

The legal effect of this practice was recognised and codified by the International Law
Commission in its preparatory work for the VCLT. In its Commentary to draft Article
22 (which preceded Article 25 of the VCLT), the Commission noted:

This article recognizes a practice which occurs with some frequency to-day and
requires notice in the draft articles ... (T]here can be no doubt that such clauses have

legal effect."

When the Commission returned to the same topic in 2013, it emphasised to the Sixth
Committee of the General Assembly that both the Special Rapporteurs on the Draft
Articles on the Law of Treaties and members of the Commission took the view that
“unless the parties agreed otherwise, agreement to provisionally apply a treaty implied
that the parties concerned were bound by the same rights and obligations under the treaty

in the same way as if it were in force.”*?

At the Vienna Diplomatic Conference to negotiate the VCLT, the ILC’s draft Article 22
on provisional application was amended into the form now found in Article 25 of the
VCLT. It was moved into Part II of the Convention, dealing with “Conclusion and Entry

into Force of Treaties.” One aspect of the amendments then made was to separate the

institution of the provisional application of a treaty, which by definition arises prior to the
entry into force of the treaty and by virtue of a provision in the treaty or the agreement of
the negotiating states, from the legal consequences of a treaty that is in force as between
the states parties to it following their consent to such entry into force. As the Tribunal

will later explain, this distinction is reflected in Russian law.

The final form of the draft article was adopted by a majority of 87 votes to 1.3 Sir
Humphrey Waldock (Special Consultant to the Conference) commented: “The practice

of provisional application was now well established among a large number of States.”444

223. Reference to other aspects of the law of treaties also sheds further light on the meaning
of “not inconsistent with.” There are two lines of case-law interpreting treaties that,
though not identical to the Domestic Law Inconsistency Clause in Article 45(1) of the
ECT, are particularly germane to its construction: (i) the interpretation of Article 1(b)
Protocol of Provisional Application of the GATT; and (ii) the consideration by ECT
tribunals of the compatibility of successive treaties under Article 30 of the VCLT,

of the GATT provides that the governments of the signatory states “undertake ... to apply

(b) Part II of that Agreement to the fullest extent not inconsistent with existing

This language is not identical to Article 45. It refers to “existing legislation” and not to a
signatory state’s “constitution, laws and regulations.” It also reinforces the primary
obligation, by requiring the signatory states to give provisional application “to the fullest

extent.” Nevertheless, the clause sets the link between each state’s international law

obligations arising by virtue of their agreement provisionally to apply the GATT and their

domestic law as determined by the former being “not inconsistent with” the latter.

In interpreting this requirement, GATT Panels, following a Working Party Report,
adopted a construction that required that “the legislation on which [the reliance on the
proviso] is based is by its terms or expressed intent of a mandatory character—that is, it
imposes on the executive authority requirements which cannot be modified by executive
action.”““ The proviso did not operate to give priority to all existing legislation. Where
such legislation did not prohibit the executive from committing to the provisional
application of a rule different to the domestic law, the signatory state was obliged to do
so in order to meet the obligations of Part I] GATT in accordance with its agreement to

provisional application.

This approach is in accord with the interpretation of “not inconsistent with” that the
Tribunal has already reached as a matter of ordinary interpretation. That is to say, it
requires a conflict between the domestic legislation on the one hand and the provisional
application of the treaty, given effect by decision of the executive, on the other. Such a
conflict will only arise where the legislation contains a mandatory rule that has the effect
of prohibiting the executive from proceeding to give provisional application to the

relevant treaty obligation.

Application of successive treaties. Tribunals also have to consider the relation between
two sets of legal rules, each of which is binding and applicable, when determining the
relation between successive treaties relating to the same subject matter under Article
30(3) of the VCLT. This paragraph provides that “[w]hen all parties to the earlier treaty
are parties also to the later treaty but the earlier treaty is not terminated or suspended in
operation under article 59, the earlier treaty applies only to the extent that its provisions

are compatible with those of the later treaty.”

This provision differs from Article 45(1) of the ECT. It uses “compatible” as the

connecting factor rather than “not inconsistent.” It is framed as a positive test, requiring

compatibility of the earlier treaty, rather than a negative assurance of “not inconsistent.”
Article 30 is concerned with successive sets of international law obligations between
parties inter se, not a qualification upon such obligations derived from a particular state’s
domestic law. These material differences noted, reference to the jurisprudence under this
provision is also of some assistance. The ordinary meaning of “inconsistent” found above
includes “incompatible.” In both cases, the test contemplates a relation of continuing
parallel sets of obligations, one to be applied “to the extent” of compatibility with the

other.

In Achmea“” and Electrabel"® tribunals had to determine whether the obligations
assumed by the respondent states under investment treaties were compatible with
obligations that they had subsequently assumed under EU Treaties. In Achmea, the issue
concerned compatibility of a submission to arbitration under a prior bilateral treaty with
EU law. The Tribunal held that this question was to be determined by reference to
whether such a submission violated EU law. It found that it did not, there being no rule
of EU law that prohibits investor-state arbitration.“° In Electrabel, the Tribunal
considered whether the submission to arbitration under the ECT was compatible with the
EU legal order. It found no “inconsistency,” there being “no legal rule or principle of EU
law that would prevent this Tribunal from exercising its functions in this arbitration under
Article 26 of the ECT."4°

In this context, the question of compatibility is answered by reference to whether the rule
in the later treaty prevents the application of the rule in the earlier treaty, such that the

application of the prior rule would violate the later treaty.

(d) Other guides to interpretation of Article 45

The Parties also referred the Tribunal to materials prepared by the negotiating States
either in the course of the drafting of the ECT or following its adoption that they
considered may assist the Tribunal in the interpretation of Article 45 of the ECT. The

Tribunal is entitled to consider such material to the extent that it properly forms part of:

(a) any other element of the context in which the treaty was concluded (Article 31(2) of
the VCLT); or (b) subsequent practice of the parties as to the interpretation of the treaty

treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion either in order to confirm a meaning arrived
at or to determine such a meaning in cases of ambiguity or where the result would

otherwise be absurd: Article 32 of the VCLT.
233. Two points deserve emphasis:

(a) The negotiating States agreed that “there should be a strong commitment to
Provisional Application of the Energy Charter Treaty” and specifically
requested those States that did not wish to apply the Treaty provisionally to
make a declaration to that effect at the time of signature“! A number of
negotiating States availed themselves of this option,**? which, the Secretariat
reminded them, was an action available to be taken upon signature. Upon

signature, states made three different kinds of declarations under Article 45:

(i) Some signatories declared that they could not accept provisional

application of the Treaty in accordance with Article 45(2)(a).

(ii) A number of other signatories declared that they would not apply

the Treaty provisionally in accordance with Article 4s(1).4*

(e) Russian practice as a signatory to the ECT

234. Having considered the nature of provisional application as expressly provided in the ECT
and under general international law, it is now necessary to consider the actions taken by

the Respondent in connection with its signature and provisional application of the ECT.

235. Under the signature of Mr Chernomyrdin, Chairman, the Government of the Russian
Federation resolved on 16 December 1994 to execute the ECT subject to certain specified
declarations and to instruct Mr Davydov, its Deputy Chairman, to execute the Treaty.*5”
The Government resolved to make a number of declarations with respect to separate
articles of the ECT, as listed in an Appendix to the Resolution. This list did not include
any declaration of the kind provided for in Article 45. By a certificate of the same date,
the Russian Federation (under the signature of its Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs)
issued full powers to Mr Davydov to sign the ECT,*** which he did on 17 December
1994.4

Russia, apparently prepared on behalf of the Russian delegation to the Charter Conference
of the ECT held in Brussels on 8 July 1997, states that:

Provisional application of international treaties is quite common in Russian legal
practice ... When provisional application is foreseen in the text of the treaty, no
separate decision to this effect is taken. The decision to sign a treaty includes the
decision to apply it provisionally since the draft treaty is approved by the Decree of
the President or by the Ruling of the Government. In this particular case the decision
to sign the ECT in 1994 was approved by the Ruling of the Government of the
RUF."

The FLIT requires that a treaty presented for ratification be accompanied by an “analysis
of the consistency of the treaty with the legislation of the Russian Federation.“*' The
Treaty was presented to the Russian Parliament for ratification in 1996 under cover of the

Government’s Explanatory Note, which stated inter alia:

Prior to the entry into force of the ECT, the majority of the Contracting Parties agreed
to apply the treaty on a provisional basis. In this respect, it was decided that such
provisional application of the ECT would be implemented to the extent that it would
not be inconsistent with the constitution, laws and regulations of the country in

question.

At the time of signing of the ECT, the provision on provisional application was in
conformity with the Russian legal acts. For that reason, the Russian side did not
make declarations as to its inability to accept provisional application (such

declarations were made by 12 of the 49 ECT signatories).

The legal regime of foreign investments envisaged under the ECT is consistent with

the provisions of the existing Law of the RSFSR.“

On 18 December 2002, the Delegation of the Russian Federation further stated to the
Energy Charter Conference that “[t]he Russian Federation has yet to ratify the Energy
Charter Treaty, but, as a Signatory Country, it implements the Treaty from the day it
entered into force.“ At that stage, it proceeded on the premise that the ratification of
the Treaty by the Russian Parliament would largely depend upon a successful finalization
of the Transit Protocol.

On 25 November 2005, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation issued
background information on the ECT in which it stated: “[t]he Russian Federation applies
[the ECT] on a provisional basis in accordance with Part Il of the [VCLT] and Section II
of the [FLIT]."4%

On 20 August 2009, the Russian Federation notified the depository of the ECT that it did
not intend to become a Contracting Party to the Treaty.*® Pursuant to Article 45(3)(a) of
the ECT, this notification had the effect of terminating Russia’s provisional application
of the Treaty on 19 October 2009, 60 days after notification.

Pausing at this point in the analysis, the following observations may be made as to the

factual position adopted by Russia vis-a-vis the Treaty’s provisional application:
Pi P' y PP!

(a) The Russian Government, in investing Mr Davydov with full powers to sign the
ECT, did not avail itself to make any declaration of the kinds permitted by
Article 45 that would have restricted the provisional application of the Treaty
pending its entry into force for Russia following ratification. The Energy
Charter Secretariat had reminded all negotiating States of this option, which a

number of other States exercised upon signature.

(b) Russia took the view that, since provisional application was specifically

provided for in the Treaty, and since the institution of provisional application

was well known under Russian law, it was not necessary to make a specific

decision as to provisional application.

(c) The Russian Government considered that no declaration was required since the
ECT “was in conformity with the Russian legal acts” and “consistent with the
provisions of the existing Law.”* Contrary to the Respondent’s submission
that this is a “post-ratification analysis,“ the Tribunal considers this to be a
statement of the relationship between the ECT and Russian law as at the date of
the Note — that is, prior to the ECT’s ratification.

(d) Russia continued to inform the Energy Charter Conference, even after the
Russian Parliament had deferred its ratification of the Treaty, that it
“implements” and “applies the Treaty on a provisional basis. It did not

suggest in so stating that its provisional application was qualified or partial.

(e) This continued to be Russia’s position from conclusion and signature of the
Treaty in December 1994 until its notification that it did not intend to become a

contracting party nearly 15 years later in August 2009.

242. Nevertheless, Russia’s obligation of provisional application that it voluntarily assumed
upon signature in December 1994 under Article 45(1) of the ECT was always subject to
the proviso: “to the extent that such provisional application is not inconsistent with its

constitution, laws or regulations.”

(f) “Not inconsistent with” Russian constitution, laws or regulations

243. The Tribunal now turns to consider whether, and if so to what extent, such provisional
application was “not inconsistent” with the Russian Constitution, laws or regulations
(together “Russian Law”). It does so informed by the construction of the Domestic Law
Inconsistency Clause that it has reached above, applying Articles 31-2 of the VCLT,

(a) The question is whether the provisional application of Article 26 of the ECT is

not inconsistent with Russian law;

(b) The signatory States (including Russia) expressly contemplated that the dispute
settlement provisions of Part V of the ECT (which contains Article 26) are
capable of provisional application (para. 200 above), if not inconsistent with

their respective national laws;

(©) Consistency does not require identity or equivalence. The question is whether
the two legal orders are compatible or discordant. The test of “not inconsistent
with” is designed to prevent clashes between the two legal orders. It does not
ensure conformity or require express permission in domestic law (para. 210

above);

(d) This requires a conflict with a mandatory rule that precludes the executive from

giving provisional application to Article 26 (para. 227 above).

244. In addressing the question whether the provisional application of Article 26 is not
inconsistent with Russian law, the Tribunal has been assisted by experts called on behalf
of the Parties: Professor Stephan for Claimant and Professor Asoskov for Respondent,
each of whom was called for cross-examination and asked to answer questions from the
Tribunal. It also has the benefit of an extensive file of primary materials of Russian law
presented by the Parties, which contains relevant legislation, judicial decisions and
commentary. Two preliminary points should be made about the Tribunal’s approach to

Russian law:

(i) The Tribunal is directed to address the application of Russian law by virtue of the
renvoi found in the proviso to Article 45(1). In determining the content of Russian

law, the Tribunal proceeds in light of the following consideration:

Where the Tribunal is presented with a question of municipal law essential to
the issues raised by the Parties for its decision, the Tribunal, whilst retaining
its independent powers of assessment and decision, must seek to determine

the content of the applicable law in accordance with evidence presented to it

as to the content of the law and the manner in which the law would be

understood and applied by the municipal courts.’

(ii) Having ascertained the content of Russian Law, it is then obliged to consider its
application within the framework of the test posited in Article 45(1), the

construction of which is determined under international law (para. 206(c) above).

“Constitution” and “laws.” The Domestic Law Inconsistency Clause in Article 45(1)
requires the Tribunal to determine whether Russia’s provisional application of the Treaty
is not inconsistent with three elements of its national legal system: (i) its Constitution, (ii)
its laws, and (iii) its regulations. Neither Party has relied upon specific Russian
regulations as being relevant to this enquiry. The Tribunal may therefore confine itself

to the Russian Constitution and laws.

The Treaty’s distinct references to a signatory state’s constitution and to its laws directs
attention to two distinct ways in which it may be said that the Domestic Law

Inconsistency Clause is engaged:

(i) That the institution of the provisional application of a treaty is itself inconsistent
with the State’s constitutional arrangements in relation to the assumption of
international law obligations under a treaty, because it is in conflict with a
mandatory rule of the Constitution that has the effect of preventing the executive

from exercising a power to agree to provisional application; or

(ii) That the subject-matter of the international law obligation in question conflicts with
a mandatory limitation imposed by domestic legislation upon the provisional

application of the particular type of treaty obligation.

The Tribunal will consider each of these possible forms of inconsistency, whilst noting

that they are nevertheless closely interrelated:

(a) As a matter of international law, they are both different aspects of the single
question provoked by Article 45 of whether the provisional application of

Article 26 of the ECT is or is not inconsistent with Russian Law as a whole.

(b) As a matter of Russian Law, there is an important distinction between Russia’s
Constitution”! and laws adopted thereunder by the Russian Parliament.
Nevertheless, in answering the question posed in paragraph 246(i) above, the
Tribunal will find it necessary to refer in addition to certain federal legislation,
notably the FLIT‘”® and to judicial decisions of the competent Russian final
courts of appeal on its interpretation. This legislation bears directly on the core
constitutional law question of the distribution of powers between Parliament

and the executive in relation to international treaties.

248. Constitutional effect of provisional application under Russian law. As noted above, the
first step in the enquiry is to examine the general effect given to the institution of

provisional application under the Russian Constitution and law.

249, The following general propositions as to the impact of the Constitution itself on the
provisional application of treaties are not contentious and were accepted by Professor

Asoskov, Russia’s legal expert:
(a) Article 15(4) of the Constitution provides:

The universally-recognised rules of international law and international treaties
of the Russian Federation shall be a component part of its legal system. If an
international treaty of the Russian Federation provides for other rules than

those envisaged by law, the rules of the international treaty shall be applied.’”?

{b) The rule of incorporation and supremacy within the Russian legal system for

international law includes the rules of the VCLT.4

(c) Article 15(4) of the Constitution applies equally to provisionally applicable

treaties.”

250. The FLIT draws a distinction between the ratification of international treaties, which must
be done by federal law in cases where ratification is required (Articles 14-15) and the

provisional application of treaties by the Russian Federation (Article 23).

251.

‘The effect given to the provisional application of treaties under Russian law is confirmed
by Article 23 of the FLIT, which makes express provision for provisional application as
follows:

Article 23. isional application of i ional treaties by
the Russian Federation

1. An international treaty or a part of a treaty may, prior to its entry into force, be
applied by the Russian Federation provisionally if the treaty itself so provides
or if an agreement to that effect has been reached with the parties that have
signed the treaty.

2, Decisions on the provisional application of a treaty or a part thereof by the
Russian Federation shall be made by the body that has taken the decision to
sign the international treaty according to the procedure set out in Article 11 of
this Federal Law.

If an international treaty — the decision on the consent to the binding character
of which for the Russian Federation is, under this Federal Law, to be taken in
the form of a Federal Law — provides for the provisional application of the
treaty or a part thereof, or if an agreement to that effect was reached among
the parties in some other manner, then this treaty shall be submitted to the State
Duma within six months from the start of its provisional application. The term
of provisional application may be prolonged by way of a decision taken in the
form of a federal law according to the procedure set out in Article 17 of this
Federal Law for the ratification of international treaties.

3. Unless the international treaty provides otherwise, or the respective States
otherwise agree, the provisional application by the Russian Federation of a
treaty or a part thereof shall be terminated upon notification to the other States
that apply the treaty provisionally of the intention of the Russian Federation
not to become a party to the treaty.

252. Both experts agree that Article 23(1) and the first sentence of Article 23(2) reflect the

position that obtains pursuant to the VCLT and under prior Russian law.‘ The

consequence is that, in Russian practice, treaties requiring ratification are also capable of

being applied provisionally.*”” As it was put in a scholarly Commentary on the FLIT:

The provisional application of treaties has been widely used in Russian treaty
practice. Before the Law entered into force, such practice was based on Article 25 of
the [VCLT]. Article 23 of the Law was called upon to harmonize this practice; it
introduces requirements in addition to those contained in the [VCLT].

In Russian practice, treaties requiring ratification are likewise applied

provisionally.*7*

The second sentence of Article 23(2) adds an additional procedural requirement of
submission to the State Duma within six months from the start of a treaty’s provisional
application. It is common ground between the experts that this requirement was newly
introduced by way of the FLIT in 1995; it was not found in the prior Russian law; its
introduction did not have retrospective effect so as to apply to the provisional application
of treaties undertaken on behalf of Russia prior to the enactment of the FLIT.4” In any
event, a failure to comply with this new requirement does not mean that the provisional
application of a treaty in Russia is automatically terminated.*®° “Such a result would
contradict Article 23 of the Law and Article 18 of the [VCLT] ... [SJuch a failure will not

automatically entail any international legal consequences.”**!

The status of the provisional application of a treaty within the Russian legal system was
the subject of authoritative determination by the Constitutional Court in Resolution 8-P
upon a specific challenge to the constitutionality of Article 23 of the FLIT.*8? In that
case, the applicant sought review of a decision on the part of the Government to impose

customs duties upon him for the import of goods through Kazakhstan in accordance with

the higher rates prescribed in a customs union treaty between Russia and Kazakhstan.
That treaty had not entered into force and was subject to provisional application. The
Court had to review Article 23(1) of the FLIT in order to decide “the extent upon which
the issue of possibility of review of provisional application of an international treaty of
the Russian Federation (or any part thereof) prior to its entry into force, which affects the

rights, freedoms and duties of man and citizen and establishes other rules than those

Page 95 of 195

provided by law and in case such treaty was not officially published, is resolved."**

255. The Constitutional Court held that provisional application has the following effect:

256. In consequence, the Court held that “provisions of a provisionally applied international
treaty become part of the legal system of the Russian Federation and, like international

treaties of the Russian Federation that have entered into force, have priority over Russian

laws.’

The Russian Federation may agree to provisional application of an international
treaty (whether in full or in part), may determine the maximum period of its
provisional ication and may ition provisional application of an international
treaty (or any part thereof) prior to its entry into force by compliance with the
Constitution of the Russian Federation, laws and other regulatory acts of the Russian
Federation. Agreement to provisional application of an international treaty means
that it becomes part of the legal system of the Russian Federation and must be applied
on the same basis as international treaties that have entered into force (unless
otherwise expressly stated by the Russian Federation), since otherwise, provisional
application would be meaningless. That is why neither the [VCLT] nor the [FLIT]
contains any exemptions from pacta sunt servanda with respect to provisional
application of treaties: as follows from Article 25(2) of the Convention and Article
23(3) of the Federal Law, if a treaty does not provide otherwise or if the respective
states have not agreed otherwise, provisional application of such international treaty
or any part thereof with respect to the Russian Federation will cease if it notifies
other states between which such treaty is provisionally applied of its intention not to

become a party thereto.“

257. As a result, the Court upheld the constitutional validity of Article 23(1) of the FLIT
“insofar as it permits provisional application prior to its entry into force of an international
treaty of the Russian Federation (or any part thereof).” Such provisional application is
valid even where the provisionally applied treaty is “establishing rules other than those
provided by law,”*®° with the consequence that the treaty forms part of Russian law

pending its ratification or the termination of provisional application.

258.

The Tribunal attaches considerable weight to this Ruling of the apex Constitutional Court
in the Russian legal system. It concludes from its Ruling that the institution of the
provisional application of a treaty or part thereof is constitutionally valid under Russian
law and gives rise to rights and duties within the Russian legal system that take
precedence over other Russian laws. The Constitutional Court reached this conclusion,
construing a treaty that was to be provisionally applied and contained no domestic law
inconsistency proviso. When addressing the question whether there is a constitutional
prohibition on provisional application, the Tribunal regards this Ruling as applicable a
Jortiori to a case, such as the present, where provisional application is subject to a
domestic law inconsistency clause. The Ruling confirms that, irrespective of the
inclusion or omission of a domestic law inconsistency clause, there is no objection under
the Constitution to the provisional application of a treaty establishing rules other than

those provided by law.487

259.

xo

It also follows from this Ruling that the institution of provisional application, as
recognised and given effect in Russian law, provides grounds for an exception to federal
law. This possibility is also confirmed in Russian doctrine. As Professor Osminin

concludes in his treatise:

The [FLIT] (Art 23) contains no restrictions limiting the scope of provisional

 

of treaties ing to their subject-matter, permitting p1
application to be used for all categories of treaties subject to ratification, including

treaties that establish rules different from those prescribed by law,*8*

#86 Resolution No. 8-P, p. 13, dispositif para. 1 (Exhibit R-35).

“87 Supreme Court Cassation Ruling (Exhibit AVA-61) cited by Respondent as authority for the contrary position
is not in point. See paras. 117-119 above. The treaty in question in that case had not been ratified and contained
no provisional application clause: Stephan: T2/162/15-25,

488 Osminin, pp. 326-327 (Exhibit RL-140); see also Zvekkov & Osminin, p. 75 (Exhibit CL-48).

260. Itis in this context that Article 15(1) of the FLIT falls to be interpreted."®? That provision
requires ratification, inter alia, of international treaties “that set out rules different from
those provided by law.” That is a separate question to provisional application of a treaty
pending its ratification and entry into force. The FLIT does not prohibit the provisional
application of such treaties pending ratification. Rather, it expressly contemplates it. The
purpose of provisional application is to grant binding effect to treaties that must otherwise

be ratified in order to take effect within Russia’s legal system.

261.

Article 23(2) also provides guidance as to which internal organ within the Russian
Federation is empowered to take decisions on the provisional application of a treaty or
part thereof. It requires such a decision to be made “by the body that has taken the

decision to sign the international treaty according to the procedure set out in Article 11.”
262. Article 11 provides:

1. Decisions to negotiate and to sign international treaties of the Russian Federation

shall be made:

a) with respect to treaties to be concluded on behalf of the Russian Federation, by
the President of the Russian Federation, but with respect to treaties to be concluded
on behalf of the Russian Federation on matters under the jurisdiction of the
Government of the Russian Federation, by the Government of the Russian

Federation;

b) with respect to treaties to be concluded on behalf of the Government of the

Russian Federation, by the Government of the Russian Federation.

2. Decisions to negotiate and to sign international treaties of the Russian Federation
on matters under the jurisdiction of the Government of the Russian Federation shall

be made by the President of the Russian Federation if circumstances so require.

263. Article 11 of the FLIT as a whole confirms that the decision to sign an international treaty
on behalf of Russia is one within the competence of the executive, not for Parliament. In

the present case, the decision to sign the ECT was taken by the Government of the Russian

*° FLIT (Exhibit AVA-52).

Federation by Resolution, pursuant to which Mr Davydov was issued with full powers to

sign on behalf of Russia.*”

26

na

Against this background, it is possible to return to the place within the Russian
constitution of treaties that may, if the treaty so provides, be provisionally applied. Article
23 permits such provisional application by the Russian Federation and empowers the
body that has taken the decision to sign the treaty pursuant to Article 11 to make the
decision to provisionally apply the treaty or a part thereof. Where such a treaty is
provisionally applied, it becomes, to the extent of such provisional application “an
international agreement concluded by the Russian Federation.”*! For that purpose,
““conclusion’ means the expression of the consent of the Russian Federation to be bound
by an international treaty.”4” In turn, the reference in Article 15(4) of the Constitution
to “international treaties and agreements of the Russian Federation” includes treaties that

are provisionally applied, as both Parties and their experts agree.

265.

a

The Tribunal next tests whether this conclusion, arrived at by construction of the pertinent
provisions of the Constitution and the FLIT, is also consistent with the principle of the
separation of powers that may be said to underlie the requirement enshrined in Article 15
of the FLIT to subject “international treaties ... that set out rules different from those

provided for by law” to ratification “through the enactment of federal law” by Parliament.

266. The FLIT draws a careful distinction between the entry into force of a treaty and the
regime of provisional application prior to entry into force.*?? The ECT does the same. It
requires ratification by a State for the purpose of entry into force; ** while provisional

application operates “pending [the ECT’s] entry into force for such signatory.”4%

Interim Award on Jurisdiction
Page 99 of 195

Consistent with this structure, the question whether to ratify the ECT such that it may
enter into force for Russia was one for the Russian Parliament. The executive accepted

this, introducing a Bill into Parliament seeking ratification.

The question here is different: it is whether the provisional application of the ECT
pending ratification and entry into force itself offends the constitutional principle of the

separation of powers.

The provisional application of a treaty prior to its ratification and entry into force is an
institution that is expressly contemplated by the FLIT. It was Parliament that enacted the
FLIT as a federal law. It is by virtue of that law that Parliament empowers the executive

to commit Russia to such provisional application of treaties.

Professor Asoskov opines that, since Article 15(4) of the Constitution accords priority to
international treaty obligations over federal law, only such obligations that have been
ratified by Parliament and implemented by federal law can be given such effect.‘%”
Otherwise there would be the prospect of conflict between treaty obligations and federal

law, each having the force of law within the Russian legal system.

In the present case, the Domestic Law Inconsistency Clause ensures that there is no such
conflict, since the treaty obligations only apply “to the extent that such provisional

application is not inconsistent” with Russian law.

In the Tribunal’s view, provisional application of the ECT under Article 45(1) is not
inconsistent with the Constitution, since (a) Russian law expressly contemplates that the
executive may commit Russia to the provisional application of a treaty prior to its
ratification and (b) there can be no conflict between the ECT and Russian law in a manner
that might offend the priority necessarily accorded to Parliament as a matter of the
separation of powers to enact federal law, since, to the extent of such a conflict with

federal law, the Treaty would not provisionally apply.

Page 100 of 195

From the above analysis, the Tribunal concludes that the decision of the executive in
Russia to give provisional application to the ECT was not inconsistent with its

Constitution.

“Not inconsistent with” Russian laws on the settlement of investment disputes? That is
not the end of the analysis. The Tribunal must also consider whether the provisional
application of the dispute settlement provisions of Article 26 is itself “not inconsistent
with” Russian law. Following the construction of Article 45 that the Tribunal has found
above, this would have to be because such provisional application would conflict with
mandatory provisions of Russian legislation that, expressly or impliedly, may not be

derogated from by the executive by way of provisional application.

In light of its finding at paragraph 177 above, the Tribunal addresses Russian law
pertinent to this question as at the date on which its jurisdiction was invoked, namely 15
February 2013. This is the date on which its jurisdiction falls to be determined, both
Parties also accepting that a State applying the Treaty provisionally may progressively

remove inconsistencies over time.

It is important to be clear about the scope of this enquiry: it is limited to the question
whether there is a mandatory rule of Russian legislation that prohibits the executive from

agreeing to the provisional application of Article 26 of the ECT.

Much of the evidence adduced on behalf of Respondent and relied upon by Professor
Asoskov was directed towards establishing the non-arbitrability of public law disputes
between private persons and the state within the Russian municipal legal order, including
disputes concerning matters such as bankruptcy and taxation. This proposition is not
germane to the issue before the Tribunal, which relates to whether there is any prohibition
on an agreement made on the plane of international law to submit a category of disputes
with foreign nationals to international arbitration. The fact that the subject matter of the
Claimant’s underlying allegations may relate, for example, to the application of
bankruptcy legislation, does not change the character of the claim in respect of which this

Tribunal’s jurisdiction is invoked.

The Parties agree that Russian law permits the State to submit to binding resolution of

such investment disputes by arbitration pursuant to an international treaty. The Tribunal

received evidence as to the extensive scope of Russia’s programme of investment treaties,
in which the Russian Federation does submit to binding international arbitration of

disputes between it and foreign investors.**

The issue in dispute between the Parties that is submitted for the Tribunal’s decision is
whether Russian law prohibits the executive from agreeing to such a form of dispute
resolution as provided by Article 26 by way of provisional application such that the
provisional application of Article 26 is inconsistent with Russian law. This question is
not addressed by reference to the record of Russian bilateral investment treaties. On the
evidence before the Tribunal, none of these contained a clause providing for their
provisional application. The fact that these treaties were each submitted for ratification
to the Russian Parliament does not therefore address the question of whether Russian
legislation prohibits the executive from provisionally applying a treaty clause providing
for international arbitration prior to ratification. At the same time, the fact that Russia
has consented to the submission of investment disputes to international arbitration by way
of ratified treaties in other circumstances is not itself sufficient to establish that the

provisional application of Article 26 is not inconsistent with Russian law.

The relevant provision of Russian legislation that was in force at the date on which the
jurisdiction of this Tribunal is to be determined is Article 10 of the 1999 FI Law.‘ This

states:

A dispute of a foreign investor arising in connection with its investments and
business activity conducted in the territory of the Russian Federation shall be
resolved in accordance with international treaties of the Russian Federation and
federal laws in courts, arbitrazh courts or through international arbitration (arbitral

tribunal).

The Preamble to the 1999 FI Law states, inter alia, that it is aimed at “making sure that
the legal treatment of foreign investment is consistent with the rules of international law

and international practice of investment cooperation.”

resolution of investment disputes:

(a) It permits reference to international treaties of the Russian Federation as
providing one source for rules concerning the resolution of a dispute of a foreign

investor in connection with its investments in the Russian Federation.

(b) It offers international arbitration as one forum for the resolution of such disputes

by way of an alternative to courts or arbitrazh courts.

“[I]nternational treaties of the Russian Federation” is to be construed as a reference to
such treaties as are capable of creating legal obligations within the Russian legal system.
In light of the evidence of Russian law cited above, a provisionally applied treaty also has
the force of law within the Russian legal order. Unlike its predecessor the 1991 FI Law,5
the 1999 FI Law does not qualify the reference to international treaties with the words “in
force.” As the Constitutional Court has confirmed, a treaty that is provisionally applied
is applied on the same basis as treaties that have entered into force. The reference to
“international arbitration” includes a treaty provision for the resolution of disputes
through international arbitration, such as Article 26 of the ECT, in a treaty that is

provisionally applied.

Russian legislation on the resolution of investment disputes does not prohibit the
executive from provisionally applying a treaty that contains a reference of such disputes
to international arbitration. The Tribunal dingly ludes that the decision of the
executive to give provisional application to the ECT was not inconsistent with Russia’s

“laws”.

The Tribunal has reached the above conclusions following its own independent analysis

of the law in the light of the evidence and the legal authorities adduced before it.

As mentioned earlier," with the Parties’ agreement, the Tribunal received into the record

in these proceedings The Hague District Court Judgment dated 20 April 2016, setting

provisional application of the ECT to the Russian Federation vis-a-vis an invocation of
jurisdiction under Article 26, the Tribunal invited the Parties to make submissions on the
relevance (if any) of the judgment in the present case. Both the Arbitral Tribunal and the

evidentiary record and submissions advanced before them, which may well differ
materially from the record in the present proceedings. Nevertheless, in view of the fact
that the present Tribunal has come to a different view on the application of Article 45(1)
to that reached by the District Court, the Tribunal now indicates in outline where it

respectfully differs from the District Court in its analysis of the law.

In the first place, the District Court holds that “not inconsistent with” is equivalent to

“compatibility.” It reasons that:

Given in part the fact that the provisional application finds its legitimacy in the
signing (and the sovereignty of the Signatories is at stake in a number of treaty
provisions), the provisional application of the arbitral provision contained in Article
26 is also contrary to Russian law if there is no legal basis for such a method of
dispute settlement or is irreconcilable with the starting points and principles that have

been laid down in or can be derived from legislation.*

As a result of characterising the question as a search for compatibility with Russian law,
the District Court considers that “incompatibility with Russian law can also exist if that
law does not provide for the option of arbitration as laid down in Article 26 ECT.”%* It
finds that the 1999 FI Law “does not provide a separate legal basis for the arbitration of
disputes between an investor and a state in international arbitral proceedings, as provided
for in Article 26 ECT.”5°5 The Court concludes that it “does not follow the Tribunal’s

opinion that such disputes, and therefore also the current dispute, can be arbitrated based

on Russian law.”5%

The Respondent in the present case urged a similar interpretation upon the Tribunal. In
answer to a question from the Tribunal as to which provisions of the ECT had been
applied by the Respondent upon signature, it referred solely to a number of substantive
provisions of Russian domestic law that were already in force at the time of signature and
that contain obligations similar to those in the ECT, but were only enforceable in the

Russian courts.*°7

For the reasons developed above,°"* the Tribunal considers that this approach is not in
accordance with Article 45 of the ECT when interpreted in accordance with the general
approach to interpretation of treaties in international law, codified in Articles 31-2 of the
VCLT. The District Court’s enquiry construes the test in Article 45 in a manner that does
not give effect to the purpose of the provision, namely the agreement of the signatory
States to apply the Treaty provisionally subject to the Domestic Law Inconsistency
Clause. The approach of the District Court reverses the enquiry mandated by Article 45.
Its approach requires the signatory State to have already made provision in its domestic
law in terms that are in substance the same as the treaty obligation. Such an interpretation
would mean that the provisional application of the ECT, as provided in Article 45, would

add nothing to the pre-existing domestic law of the signatory States.

This would deprive Article 45 of its substantive effect, despite the clearly expressed intent
of the signatories that the ECT was to be subject to provisional application, with the
consequences spelled out in detail in the ensuing paragraphs of Article 45. As the

is well d in both

Tribunal has shown, the institution of provisi
international law and in Russian law as giving effect, on a provisional basis prior to
ratification, to the obligations of international law assumed by the signatory states under

the Treaty.

292. For these reasons and in the light of the rest of its analysis above, the Tribunal differs in

its interpretation of Article 45 of the ECT in its application to the present case.

293. The Tribunal concludes that, upon signature, the Respondent did agree to provisionally
apply Article 26 of the ECT in accordance with — and with the consequences provided for
in— Article 45.

294. In light of this conclusion, the Tribunal finds it unnecessary to decide whether provisional
application must apply to the ECT as a whole or may apply piecemeal, since, for all of
the reasons elaborated above, it is in any event satisfied that the Respondent’s agreement
to the provisional application of the ECT includes the obligation to submit a dispute to
arbitration under Article 26.

B. Dip THE CLAIMANT MAKE A PROTECTED INVESTMENT UNDER THE ECT?
1. Introduction and factual background

(a) The Respondent’s objection

295. In its second principal objection to jurisdiction, the Respondent alleges that the Loans do

not qualify as Investments in terms of Article 1(6) of the ECT.

296. The Respondent accepts that the Claimant is an “Investor” for the purpose of Article 1(7)

of the ECT, being ‘a company or other organization organized in accordance with the law

applicable in that Contracting Party.”

297. However, it submits that the Loans do not constitute an “Investment” on the grounds that
the Loans:

(a) Do not qualify as “other debt of a company” in terms of Article 1(6)(b), “claims
to money” in terms of Article 1(6)(c) or “Returns” in terms of Article 1(6)(d);

(b) Do not meet the characteristics of an Investment under Article 1(6); and

(c) Are not “associated with an Economic Activity in the Energy Sector” in terms
of Article 1(6).

(b) The relevant provisions of the ECT

298, The ECT provides the following relevant definition of “Investment”:

Article_1—Definitions
(6) “Investment” means every kind of asset, owned or controlled directly or

indirectly by an Investor and includes:

(a) tangible and intangible, and moveable and immovable, property, and
any property rights such as leases, mortgages, liens, and pledges;

(b) a company or business enterprise, or shares, stock, or other forms of
equity participation in a company or business enterprise, and bonds and
other debt of a company or business enterprise;

(c) claims to money and claims to performance pursuant to contract having
an economic value and associated with an Investment;

(d) ...
(ec) Returns;

(4) any right conferred by Jaw or contract or by virtue of any licences and
permits granted pursuant to law to undertake any Economic Activity in
the Energy Sector.

 

refers to any i ii with an ic Activity in
the Energy Sector and to investments or classes of investments designated by a
Contracting Party in its Area as “Charter efficiency projects” and so notified to
the Secretariat.

299. “Economic activity in the Energy Sector” is defined in Article 1(5) to mean: “an economic

300.

301.

activity concerning the exploration, extraction, refining, production, storage, land
transport, transmission, distribution, trade, marketing, or sale of Energy Materials and
Products.”

“Area” means with respect to a state that is a contracting party both “the territory under
its sovereignty” and the sea and sea-bed over which it exercises sovereign rights in

accordance with the international law of the sea: Article 1(10).

“Returns,” which are included within the definition of “Investment” by virtue of Article
1(6)(e), are defined in Article 1(9) to mean “the amounts derived from or associated with

an Investment, irrespective of the form in which they are paid, including profits,

dividends, interest, capital gains, royalty payments, management, technical assistance or

other fees and payments in kind.”

An investment may be made by “establishing new Investments, acquiring all or part of

existing Investments or moving into different fields of Investment activity”: Article 1(8).

The requirement that there be “an Investment” forms an integral part of the agreement to
submit disputes concerning an alleged breach of the Investment Promotion and Protection
provisions of Part III of the ECT to international arbitration. Article 26(1) defines the
scope ratione materiae of the disputes capable of submission to arbitration under Article
26(3)(a) as “{dJisputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another

Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the former.”°'°

(c) Summary of the Parties’ characterisation of the Loans

A brief summary of the factual background to this arbitration was provided in Part III of
this Award. A closer understanding of the background, character and operation of the
Loans is now necessary in order to understand the nature of the Respondent’s objection

and the Claimant’s response.

The Tribunal briefly summarises the Parties’ different positions on the characterisation
of the primary facts before summarising the facts as it finds them to be. It then outlines
the Parties’ detailed submissions on the question of whether the Claimant made a

qualifying Investment.

The Respondent submits that the history, intent and terms of the Loans demonstrate that
they were a repatriation to Yukos Oil in Russia of the profits of its own oil trading
activities in Russia and the sale of its interest in a Russian gas company.*!' The form of
a loan was adopted to achieve tax benefits. But, on the Respondent's case, the substance
was not changed; the Loans did not contribute anything to the Russian economy. Yukos

Capital played no meaningful role in the transaction and should be disregarded.>'?

In order to illustrate the structure of the relevant transactions the Respondent produced an

annotated demonstrative exhibit.>"

The Respondent submits that, in those circumstances, the Loans do not qualify as an
Investment in terms of Article 1(6). During the Hearing, the Respondent confirmed that
for the purpose of this phase of the proceedings, it:

(a) Does not object to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction on the ground that Yukos Capital

does not qualify as an Investor in terms of Article 1(7);5'4 and

(b) Does not argue that the payments from other companies in Yukos Group out of
Russia were contrary to Russian law. It accepted (again for this purpose only)
that the transfers from Russia to Cyprus (including the tax paid on them) were

in accordance with the then treaty arrangements between Russia and Cyprus.°"5

The Claimant produced its own version of the Respondent’s demonstrative exhibit5!®
The Claimant does not take issue with the basic structure of the transactions alleged by
the Respondent. The primary difference is that the Claimant submits that funds upon
which Yukos Capital drew in order to fund the Loans comprised — in addition to the
dividends derived from trading subsidiaries’ profits — funds from international

investment, which together formed a pool of investments.*!”

The Claimant submits that there “was never anything remotely circular” about the path
of the funds, which were never owned by Yukos Oil. This was not a strategy to “pop
funds out of Russia just to stick them back in for tax purposes,” and the original strategy

was to use the funds for international expansion.>!®

d) The Tribunal’s approach to the evidence
PP

In addition to the documentary evidence submitted on the record in these proceedings
relating to the Loans by both Parties, the Tribunal also had the benefit of witness evidence.
The Claimant called Mr Misamore, who had been the Chief Financial Officer of Yukos
Oil from April 2001 to December 2005. He submitted two witness statements and was
tendered for cross-examination at the hearing. He also answered questions from the
Tribunal. In addition, each Party produced experts on inter-company loan transactions:
Mr Gleichenhaus and Mr Grantham for the Claimant, and Professor Lys for the
R dent. They each submitted reports and d before the Tribunal.

. The Tribunal is mindful of the nature of its function at the jurisdictional stage in relation

to contested matters of fact. Its draws a distinction that is well established in the
jurisprudence of international courts and tribunals, both generally and in the specific
context of investment disputes. That is the distinction between: (a) allegations of fact that
go to the merits of the claim, which the Tribunal must take care not to prejudge at the
jurisdictional stage and must instead approach on a prima facie basis; and (b) questions
of fact that go directly to the scope of its jurisdiction, on which it is bound to make a final

determination.

313. As the Annulment Committee in Duke v. Peru observed:

[AJn arbitral tribunal must, for the purpose of its jurisdictional determination,
presume the facts which found the claim on the merits as alleged by the claimant to
be true (unless they are plainly without any foundation). In that sense, its
determination may be said to be prima facie. But, in the application of those
presumed facts to the legal question of jurisdiction before it, the tribunal must
objectively characterise those facts in order to determine finally whether they fall
within or outside the scope of the parties’ consent. Jn making this determination, the
tribunal may not simply adopt the claimant’s characterisation without examination.
In this way, a tribunal whose jurisdiction is contested strikes the balance between
avoiding pre-judging the merits, on the one hand, and objectively determining the

question of jurisdiction on the other.*!°

314. That an objective and final determination of its jurisdiction must be made was a central
element in the reasoning of the International Court of Justice in Oil Platforms when it

observed:

[T]he Court cannot limit itself to noting that one of the Parties maintains that such a
dispute exists, and the other denies it. It must ascertain whether the violations of the
Treaty of 1955 pleaded by Iran do or do not fall within the provisions of the Treaty
and whether, as a consequence, the dispute is one which the Court has jurisdiction

vatione materiae to entertain, pursuant to Article XXI, paragraph 2. °°

315. The distinction here drawn was well elucidated by Judge Higgins in her Separate Opinion,
when she said:*?!

Where the Court has to decide, on the basis of a treaty whose application and
interpretation is contested, whether it has jurisdiction, that decision must be
definitive .... It does not suffice, in the making of this definitive decision, for the
Court to decide that it has heard claims relating to the various articles that are

“arguable questions” or that are “bona fide questions of interpretation”...

The only way in which, in the present case, it can be determined whether the claims
of Iran are sufficiently plausibly based upon the 1955 Treaty is to accept pro tem the
facts as alleged by Iran to be true and in that light to interpret Articles I, IV and X
for jurisdictional purposes — that is to say, to see if on the basis of Iran’s claims of

fact there could occur a violation of one or more of them.

316. The same distinction was made in the investment arbitration context by the tribunal in
UPS v. Canada when, distinguishing the two types of factual allegations for jurisdictional
purposes, it observed, as to the second type, that “any ruling about the legal meaning of
the jurisdictional provision, for instance about its outer limits, is binding on the

parties, "522

(e) The factual background

In this section, the Tribunal analyses the facts pleaded as relevant to this second
jurisdictional objection in more detail. It makes findings on matters that are clearly
established on the record and identifies remaining matters in dispute between the Parties

as to the appropriate isation of the ions or the i to be drawn
from them. It will return to those factual matters where the Parties are not in agreement
at a later point in its analysis, once it has determined what issues of fact are essential to
its reasoning for the purpose of deciding the specific jurisdictional objection before it. In
light of the limited nature of a tribunal’s fact-finding task at the jurisdictional stage
outlined above, the Tribunal is not to be taken as pre-judging other issues of fact that may

be germane to the merits.

Yukos Capital was incorporated in 2003 as a group finance company to serve the needs
of the wider Yukos Group.**3 In 2005, its ownership structure was reorganised so that it
was owned by Yukos International, which in turn was wholly owned by the Stichting.
The purpose of this restructuring, according to the Claimant, was to protect Yukos Oil’s
foreign assets from being confiscated by the Russian State. Yukos Oil was dissolved in

2007 at the conclusion of bankruptcy proceedings in Russia.°™

This proceeding concerns two Loans — the December 2003 Loan and the August 2004
Loan — under which Yukos Capital was the lender and Yukos Oil the borrower. In each
case, the Loans were funded by non-recourse back-to-back loans from other entities in
the Yukos Group. The structure of these loans and the source of the funds advanced under
them are relevant to the Respondent’s contention that they do not give rise to qualifying

Investments in terms of the ECT.

The December 2003 Loan, The December 2003 Loan was made pursuant to a loan
agreement dated 2 December 2003, whereby the Claimant agreed to loan Yukos Oil an
amount not to exceed RUB 80 billion.52° The December 2003 Loan carried a quarterly

interest rate of 9 percent, and its repayment was due on 31 December 2008. Failure to

321. The August 2004 Loan. The August 2004 Loan was made pursuant to a loan agreement
dated 19 August 2004, whereby the Claimant agreed to loan Yukos Oil an amount not to
exceed USD 355 million.5® The August 2004 Loan carried a semi-annual interest rate of
six-month LIBOR plus 1.75 percent, and its repayment was due on 30 December 2009.
Failure to meet the repayment due date entitled the Claimant to a penalty of 0.1 percent
“of the amount overdue for each day of delay.”*?? The August 2004 Loan was disbursed

to Yukos Oil in full upon the execution of the loan agreement.
322. Back-to-back loans, Each of the Loans was backed by another loan agreement:

(a) The December 2003 Loan was linked to a back-to-back agreement between
Yukos Capital and Brittany Assets Ltd. (“Brittany”);

(b) The August 2004 Loan was linked to a back-to-back agreement between Yukos
Capital and Hedgerow Ltd (“Hedgerow”) which “extended to Yukos Capital a

‘facility’ up to a certain amount.”5

(b) Hedgerow was incorporated in Cyprus. It was wholly owned by Yukos Oil
through an intermediate subsidiary, Yukos UK Ltd, a British company.5*?

324. The agreements with Brittany and Hedgerow defined Yukos Capital as the “Sub-Lender”
and determined the maximum amount to be sub-lent, the nominal interest rate, and the
maturity.>93 In practice, the funds that Brittany and Hedgerow lent to Yukos Capital were
equal to the amounts that Yukos Capital sub-lent to Yukos Oil, and, in most cases, these
funds were transferred in and out of Yukos Capital’s bank accounts in matching deposits

and withdrawals made within one business day of each other.>™+

325. In both cases, there was a specified margin (described as the “spread”) between the

interest rate payable under the primary loan and the sub-loan:

(a) The December 2003 Loan carried an interest rate on the sub-lending to Yukos
Oil of 9 per cent. The interest rate payable on the corresponding loan from
Brittany was 8.9375 per cent. That is a margin of one sixteenth of one per cent
or 6.25 basis points (0.0625%).°

(b) The August 2004 Loan carried an interest rate on the sub-lending of six-month
LIBOR plus 175 basis points. The interest rate on the corresponding loan from
Hedgerow was LIBOR plus 171.875 per cent. That is a margin of one thirty-
second of one per cent, or 3.125 basis points, or half the margin applicable to
the December 2003 Loan.

326. The Respondent submits that the spreads were calculated to be the minimum necessary
to achieve approval of the arrangements from the Luxembourg tax authorities and avoid
the risk of the tax authorities imputing to Yukos Capital receipt of a larger spread based
on transfer pricing rules. Thus, the spread declined between the 2003 and 2004 loans

because the tax authorities agreed in the interim that the lower spread was acceptable.

The Respondent claims that the spread was no more or less than an administrative fee.**6

The terms of the agreements with Brittany and Hedgerow were non-recourse. Yukos
Capital did not have to repay the funds until Yukos Oil paid it pursuant to the sub-lending
agreements of the Loans.°>” The Respondent alleges that Yukos Capital acknowledged
this in 2004 in correspondence with Brittany and Hedgerow,>** and it was reflected in a
subsequent agreement with Fair Oaks (the assignee of Brittany’s and Hedgerow’s
interests under the loans) in 2010.59 These terms also prescribed that Brittany and
Hedgerow “shall bear all risks associated with Sub-Lending.”>"° The Respondent submits

that this includes the risk of failing to receive the spread.*! The Loans were unsecured.*?

Mr Gleichenhaus’ evidence is that the Loans were accounted for as such in Yukos
Capital’s financial statements from 2003 to 2007.54

The Respondent accepts that the Loans met the formal requirements to qualify as such.
Nevertheless it submits that they should be treated as dividends for the purpose of

determining whether they constitute an Investment in terms of the Treaty.*4*

Origin of the loan funds. It was common ground that funds from profits of oil trading
activities within the Yukos Group, including those of its Russian subsidiaries, Ratibor

and Fargoil, were remitted to Brittany and provided a source of the funds used for its

December 2003 loan to Yukos Capital, which Yukos Capital in turn applied to the
December 2003 Loan to Yukos Oil: 54

(a) Yukos Oil’s wholly owned Russian production subsidiaries produced oil, and
sold it to various Yukos trading companies which traded the oil amongst
themselves.* In this case, profits were accumulated in two companies, Fargoil

and Ratibor, both Russian companies.

(b) Yukos Oil was the ultimate owner of Fargoil and Ratibor through intermediate
holding companies: Yukos CIS, which, in turn, owned Yukos Hydrocarbons,
which, in turn, owned Brittany, which owned (through further British Virgin
Island entities) two Cyprus entities, Nassaubridge and Dunsley. Those two

companies owned Ratibor and Fargoil respectively.**”

(c) Trading profits accumulated by Ratibor and Fargoil were passed in the form of
dividends to their Cyprus parents, which, in turn, passed the profits through their
holding structures in the British Virgin Islands to Brittany.5*

(d) Brittany’s funds were then lent to Yukos Capital, which then lent them to Yukos
Oil.

331. An area of dispute between the Parties on the evidence concerns the extent to which, as
Respondent alleges, these funds were sent in a loop that started and finished in Russia.
The evidence that the Tribunal has received in this jurisdictional phase as to this is as

follows:

(a) The payment by Fargoil and Ratibor of dividends to their foreign parents
constituted an expatriation of the profits of Russian oil trading subsidiaries of
Yukos Oi1.549

(b) Mr Misamore also accepts that, as he testified in Russian proceedings in 2009,
the dividends derived from Fargoil and Ratibor formed at least a source of the
funds loaned to Yukos Oil under the December 2003 Loan.5° For example, Mr
Misamore testified in 2009 that it was decided that the funds derived from
Fargoil’s 2003 dividend would be loaned by Brittany to Yukos Capital, and then
to Yukos Oil.**' To the same effect, Mr Gleichenhaus (an expert for the
Claimant) noted that the funds lent to Yukos represented dividended profits

from trading or treasury operations of Yukos subsidiaries.5

(c) At the same time, it is common ground that Yukos Capital loaned some of the
funds generated by these dividends to production subsidiaries within the Yukos
Group.*? They were not simply routed directly to Yukos Oil in foto.

(d) The Fargoil and Ratibor dividends were paid over a period to June 2003,
while Brittany did not loan the funds to Yukos Capital until December 2003.

(e) Mr Misamore testifies that the funds Brittany lent to Yukos Capital came out of
a pool that also included funds generated by the international entities from the
investment of their own funds and profits passed from their international
subsidiaries.*° The Respondent rejects this evidence as unsubstantiated.>%
This evidence was not advanced in Mr Misamore’s written witness statements,
and largely emerged during his cross-examination. It receives support from a
statement of Mr Wilson given for the purpose of the Russian criminal
proceedings and exhibited in this arbitration. Mr Wilson states that he was until
April 2002 an International Tax Director at PwC (Moscow) and tax advisor to
Yukos Oil, before being appointed International Tax Director of Yukos Oil. He

states that the dividends “together with the foreign trading profits and the profits

from foreign treasury operations” would be available to Yukos Capital.°>”
8 Pp

At the present jurisdictional stage, there is insufficient documentary evidence on the
record to enable the Tribunal to make a precise determination of the source of all of the
funds received by Brittany that were in turn applied to the Loan. The Tribunal finds on
the evidence that at least some of the funds advanced under the Loan were derived from
profits originally generated by Russian subsidiaries of Yukos Oil. However, given that
money is fungible and there was a delay of some six months between the dividends being
paid and the Loan being advanced, it cannot simply equate the funds advanced under the
December 2003 Loan with the dividends paid by Fargoil and Ratibor.

The funds advanced under the August 2004 Loan were derived from the sale of
Hedgerow’s 56 per cent shareholding in Rospan Overseas Ltd (“Rospan”), a Russian
company. Yukos Oil was the ultimate owner of this equity interest through intermediate
companies within the Yukos Group: Yukos UK Ltd, which, in turn, owned Hedgerow.***
The funds were not passed to Yukos Oil by way of dividend through Hedgerow’s
immediate parent company Yukos UK Ltd. Instead, they were loaned to Yukos Capital

and then to Yukos Oil. Yukos Oil used the funds to make a tax payment in Russia.°?

Control of the funds and the parties’ intentions in making the Loans. The Respondent
submits that Yukos Oil remained in control of Yukos Capital, Brittany, and Hedgerow,
and thus the funds that were moved via the Loans, at all times.5® The Claimant does not
dispute that all of the relevant Russian and international entities were subsidiaries of
Yukos Oi1.55!

Yukos Capital was administered by TMF Corporate Services S.A. and TMF Management
Luxembourg S.A. (“TMF”) the Claimant’s corporate and management service providers
in Luxembourg. Mr Misamore accepted that TMF took instruction from the Yukos

treasury group about what transactions to conduct and the terms on which to conduct

them, including in relation to the Loans. He maintained that they exercised an
independent function as professional managers including with respect to
documentation.° Nevertheless, Mr Misamore accepted that TMF did not conduct credit
checks or underwriting procedures before loaning funds, where Yukos Capital operated
as an inter-company financing vehicle.5* Claimant’s expert, Mr Gleichenhaus, accepted
that TMF played no role in cash management, except to the extent that it administered

transactions involving funds going in or out of Hedgerow or Brittany.**

336. Mr Misamore testified that the funds were extended by way of loans because the
repatriation was intended to be temporary, and that was a tax efficient means of achieving
a temporary repatriation and management flexibility.* Interest payments were initially
made under the December 2003 Loan.*®° No payments were made under the August 2004
Loan.**” Mr Misamore stated at the time that this was because Yukos Oil’s bank accounts
had been frozen in the Russian tax proceedings.° Yukos Capital made formal demands

for payment of the outstanding Loans,*® but did not pursue further enforcement action.”

337. The Claimant emphasises that the legal ownership of the funds stayed with the party

lending them — Brittany and then Yukos Capital — and those companies were located

71

outside Russia.*”" Yukos Oil itself never owned the funds prior to the Loans being

made.>” Likewise, the fact that Yukos Capital borrowed the funds in order to lend them

does not change their legal ownership.5”

The Respondent invites the Tribunal to conclude that Yukos Capital had no role of
economic substance in the transactions, describing it as a “transfer agent” or “delivery
agent,” ultimately of Yukos Oil, but within the structure of the transaction, as an agent of
Brittany or Hedgerow.°” The Tribunal will return to consider this submission when it

analyses the economic materialization of the Loans.>”>

The Respondent does not dispute in the present jurisdictional phase that the transactions
by which the funds were transferred out of Russia were made in accordance with the
relevant tax conventions, including the Russia-Cyprus Double Tax Agreement.5”
Withholding tax at the rate agreed between Russia and Cyprus under that Treaty was paid

on those dividends.*””

There is no evidence adduced before this Tribunal, for the purpose of determining the
present jurisdictional issue of whether an “Investment” was made, that the Loans would
have been treated as dividends under the Double Tax Agreement between Russia and
Luxembourg.>” Article 10(3) of this Treaty expressly excludes loans from its definition
of dividends providing that: “[/e] terme “dividendes” employé dans le présent article
désigne les revenus provenant d’actions, actions ou bons de jouissance, parts de mine,

parts de fondateur ou autres parts bénéficiares a Y exception des créances.”>”

This leaves for consideration the overall purpose of the transactions. The Tribunal returns

2. The Parties’ submissions

The Tribunal now summarises the Parties’ submissions on the question of whether the

Claimant made a qualifying Investment.

(a) The Respondent’s submissions

(i) Do the Loans constitute “other debt of a company,” “claims to

money” or “Returns”?
The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s assertion to the effect that the “Loans” are “debts
of Yukos Oil’s” and, as such, constitute “debt of a company or business enterprise” within
the meaning of Article 1(6)(b) of the ECT.*®° According to the Respondent, the Loans
were the “economic equivalent of a dividend,” since the funds in question were profits
generated by Yukos Oil’s subsidiaries, which were at all relevant times controlled by

Yukos Oil and accounted for in its consolidated financial statements.*8!

The Respondent asserts that Article 1(6)(b) of the ECT only covers “equity and debt
interests in a company, but not claims to money under a loan agreement.”**? This results
from a contextual interpretation, given that, whilst “other types of assets listed in Article
1(6)(b) ECT are separated by commas,” the formulation “‘other debt of a company or
business enterprise’ is not set off by commas and is thus to be treated as within the same
asset class as ‘bonds’.”*83 In accordance with the ejusdem generis principle, the general
term “debt” must belong to the same genus as the specific word “bond” that precedes it,
implying that “other debt of a company” only refers to “debt instruments issued by a
company.”

The Respondent also refers to the principle of effet utile, contending that the Claimant’s
suggested interpretation would both render Article 1(6)(c) and the reference to “claims to
money” contained therein “largely redundant” and “deprive the express limitation” to

claims “associated with an Investment” in that Article of any meaning, since all claims to

money against a company—whether associated with an investment or not—would be

covered by Article 1(6)(b) of the ECT.5*° Claims to money are covered, therefore, only

by Article 1(6)(c), with Article 1(6)(b) being limited to equity and debt interests in a
company.5*%

Arguing that Electrabel does not support the Claimant’s position in its Counter-

Memorial, the Respondent rejects the Claimant’s contention that the Loans may be seen

as debt interests in Yukos Oil, meaning the Loans do not come under the scope of Article

1(6)(b) of the ECT.58” The Respondent also notes that none of the cases cited by the

Claimant for the proposition that loans are protected investments concern “stand-alone

loans ... that did not form part of the investor’s economic venture in the host state.”5*8

To the extent that the Claimant alleges that the Loans qualify as Returns in terms of
Article 1(6)(e) and Article 1(9), they must be amounts derived from or associated with an
Investment.>* If anything, the Respondent submits, the funds were returns of a Russian
company (Yukos Oil) and granting “treaty protection to funds associated with
shareholdings of a Russian company in its Russian subsidiaries would be at odds with the
investment treaty system” since investment treaties are not deemed to create protection

for rights involved in purely domestic claims.5°°

The Respondent contends that Article 1(6)(c) of the ECT only covers claims to money
that form part of an “overall investment” in the host state.°?' The Respondent cites the
decision in Electrabel to support the idea that there needs to be an “overall investment,”
which must be an “investment other than the one addressed” in the particular sub-
paragraph.**? The Respondent claims that, since the Claimant’s alleged “Investment”

only consists of the two Loans, there is no “overall investment” that claims to mone:

could be associated with and that, accordingly, the Loans cannot be covered by
Article 1(6)(c) of the ECT.5%

(ii) Do the Loans bear the characteristics of an Investment in terms of
Article 1(6)?
349. The Respondent contends that the Loans are not protected under the ECT because they
do not qualify as “Investments” under Article 1(6) of the ECT.5™

350. The Respondent maintains that, pursuant to Article 31(1) of the VCLT, Article 1(6) of
the ECT must be interpreted in good faith, in accordance with its ordinary meaning, in its
context, and in light of the ECT’s object and purpose,>*> which involves consideration of

“the concept of investment under general international law.”°**

351.

The Respondent cites the tribunal in Alps Finance v. Slovak Republic (“Alps Finance”)
for the proposition that “[t]he term investment has an inherent meaning,” which entails
“a commitment of resources, a certain duration, and an element of risk.”°9? In Alps
Finance, the tribunal found that it is insufficient merely to establish that an asset falls
within the category of “claims and rights to any performance having an economic value.”
The Respondent quotes from the decision of the tribunal in Nova Scotia v. Venezuela to

similar effect.>*

352.

N

The Respondent also points out that a contextual interpretation of “Investment” backs up
the contention that there is a need to give the notion of “Investment” an “objective
meaning.”®®? The Respondent argues that this interpretation is corroborated by the use of
the term “Investment” elsewhere, particularly in Article 10(1) of the ECT and in the ECT
Contracting States’ Understanding with respect to Article 1(6) of the ECT.

353. The Respondent submits that, from Article 1(6) of the ECT, it is clear that “the term
‘Investment’ cannot be dissociated from its ordinary meaning.”®' In spite of the broad
list which precedes Article 1(6) and which describes the various forms that an investment
may take, Article 1(6) “does not dispense with the requirement that an investment have
certain inherent characteristics, which derive from the term’s ordinary meaning.”© The
Respondent highlights, in particular, the fact that Articles 1(6), 1(8), and 10(1) of the ECT
refer to the “making” of investments. Accordingly, “for an investor to have made an

investment, the assets listed in Article 1(6) ECT must have been invested.”6*

354. The Respondent argues that this interpretation conforms with the object and purpose of
the ECT, which is expressed at Article 2 as “long-term cooperation in the energy field,
based on complementarities and mutual benefits.”°° Such an object and purpose would
remain unrealized “if any asset held by any company incorporated in one ECT
Contracting State benefited from ECT investment protection” without regard as to
“whether it engaged in any investment activity in another ECT Contracting State, had
control or direction over the asset, or transferred any value to another ECT Contracting
State.” Referring to the communication from the European Commission cited by the
Claimant for the proposition that the ECT was intended to protect repatriation of profits,
the Respondent submits that the concern was the protection of profits of foreign investors
investing in Eastern Europe, and that the ECT “was never intended to and does not protect
the repatriation of profits of a host state company ... arising from its activities in the host

state, back to the host state.”©°?

It submits that the cases cited by the Claimant, including Stati v, Kazakhstan (“Stati”) and
Alpha Projektholding v. Ukraine, were concerned with reinvested profits, not repatriated
profits, that the Claimant contradicts itself by claiming that the funds were both a

repatriation of profits and the injection of capital into Russia, and submits that the

Claimant has failed “to demonstrate that the source of funds is irrelevant as a matter of
law.”6°8 Other cases cited by the Claimant do not concern “round-tripping” of funds.©
The Respondent was asked whether, if the transfer of the funds by Fargoil and Ratibor
out of Russia resulted in the money being lost to the Russian economy ina lawful manner,
the return of that money was a benefit to the Russian economy. The Respondent's
response was that this did not qualify for protection because there is no association with

an original protected investment.§!2

35

s

Citing Romak S.A. (Switzerland) y. The Republic of Uzbekistan (‘Romak’), the
Respondent contends that a “mechanical application” of the categories of assets listed in
an investment definition without regard for the “objective requirements of an investment”
would lead to a “result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.”*!! In response to the
Claimant’s argument that tribunals endorsing the objective requirements of an investment
have done so only to decline jurisdiction over “one-off sale of goods contract[s] akin to
ordinary commercial transaction[s],” the Respondent says that it is precisely the
“principled” approach of these tribunals ‘that allowed them to distinguish between an

investment and an ordinary commercial transaction.®'?

357. The Respondent describes an investor’s contribution to the economy as a “guid pro quo”
of the right to bring a claim to international arbitration®!? and refers to several tribunals
in investment treaty arbitrations that found that they did not have jurisdiction in the
absence of such a contribution.°'* In particular, the Respondent quotes from the decision

held that there could be no protection for rights “not involving any significant flow of
capital, resources or activity into the host State’s economy.”®'> It also submits that KT
Asia Investment Group B.V. v. Kazakhstan (“KT Asia”) is analogous, arguing that Yukos
Capital was only an “instrument in this game of revolving door” where Yukos Oil shifted

assets between its “various pockets.”6"

Similarly, with regard to the notion of risk, the Respondent refers to several arbitral

617 618

decisions®'’ as well as publicist commentary®'* that support the idea that risk is a

necessary element of an “investment.”°!9

With regard to such citations of authority, the Respondent rejects the Claimant’s
assertion™? that awards in non-ECT arbitrations are “irrelevant” to this Tribunal’s
determination.! The Respondent notes that the Claimant “has not been able to point to
any difference in language in the investment definitions applied by the tribunals cited by
Respondent that would render their decisions or awards ‘irrelevant’ to the interpretation
of Article 1(6) ECT.”6*? None of the ECT cases on which the Claimant relies except one,
Stati, dealt with an objection that the assets did not meet the inherent characteristics of an

investment, and that case is inapposite.°>

The Respondent also rejects the Claimant’s argument that contribution, duration, and
risk are not relevant to determining whether an asset is an investment, noting that “out of
the seven ECT decisions and awards cited by Claimant for the proposition that the term
‘investment’ lacks an objective meaning under Article 1(6) of the ECT, only one ECT

present case.” The Respondent contends that the Claimant “did not attempt to rebut
any of the authorities cited by Respondent that confirm that risk is a necessary element of
an investment,” except for one, the rebuttal of which was “misleading,” according to the

Respondent.56

According to the Respondent, the Loans do not meet the objective requirements of an
investment under the ECT. The Respondent submitted in closing that it was the intention
from the start that the dividends paid by Fargoil and Ratibor representing Russian oil
trading profits would be repatriated in the form of loans.’ Since the loaned funds
essentially consisted of profits made by Yukos Oil’s trading subsidiaries and other entities
controlled by Yukos Oil and the Claimant “merely acted as a conduit in back-to-back
transactions to funnel [these profits] to Yukos Oil Company,” the Claimant made no

contribution to the Russian Federation and did not incur any risk.°8

As the Respondent argues, the agreements with Brittany and Hedgerow “reveal that
Yukos Capital never made any decision with respect to the ‘Loans’, had no control over
the funds that transited through its bank accounts, and never had any economic interest
in those funds.” The Respondent submits that no value was transferred through the
Loans from Luxembourg to the Russian Federation.°° The Respondent recalls that the
Phoenix Action tribunal rejected a claim in which a restructuring of domestic investments
was merely “a rearrangement of assets within a family” rather than being a part of a

“significant flow of capital, resources or activity into the host State’s economy.”

The Respondent alleges that the funds of both the December 2003 Loan and the August
2004 Loan were “in substance” dividends to Yukos Oil, dressed up as loans to avoid
Russian taxes.° In the case of the December 2003 Loan, the funds were “profits arising

from the production and sale of oil produced by Yukos Oil Company’s subsidiaries,”

whilst in the case of the August 2004 Loan they were the “proceeds of the sale of Yukos
Oil Company’s indirect interest in another Russian oil and gas company,” Rospan.? To
the extent that interest payments were made (which would be inconsistent with the
transactions’ characterisation as dividends), the Respondent submits that this had no

impact on the economic position of the Yukos Group.©*

The Respondent denies the Claimant’s assertion that the Respondent “recognized that the
Loans were valid intercompany loans, not dividends,” asserting that Yukos’ filing of a
financial statement did not involve recognition or approval by the Respondent and that
Yukos never disclosed to the Russian Federation details about the “loan” in its tax

filings.5

Against this backdrop, the Respondent argues that the Claimant failed to show “that it
made a personal contribution to the ‘Loans’ and that the ‘Loans’ involve a ‘contribution
to, or relevant economic activity within’ the Russian Federation.” In particular, the
Respondent points out that the decision of the tribunal in Romak, upon which the Claimant
relies,°*” did not imply “that any commitment of funds, or transfer of title to funds, fulfills
the contribution requirement.”®* According to the Respondent, the Claimant must show,
but has not shown, that “it committed funds ‘in furtherance of a venture’, i.e., that it had
an economic interest in the ‘Loans’ and committed its funds in order to ‘obtain an

economic benefit’.”6??

As the Respondent argues, the Claimant never had any control over the funds it received
from other Yukos Oil subsidiaries, which were rather “at all relevant times controlled by
Yukos Oil Company.”*° The purpose of the Loans was not to engage in economic

activity, but to avoid Russian taxes that would have been due if dividends had instead

been paid by the subsidiaries.“ The Loans also did not transfer any value from any ECT
contracting state to the Russian Federation, but, if anything, “withheld value from the

Respondent since they were designed to and did avoid Russian taxes on profits,"

367.

a

The Respondent asserts that, in spite of the Claimant’s arguments to the contrary, the fact
that Yukos Capital was a “passive conduit” is “not irrelevant,” citing Standard Chartered
Bank v. Tanzania, in which “{t}he tribunal required that there be an ‘active relationship
between the investor and the investment’ in the sense that ‘the investment was made at
the claimant's direction, that the claimant funded the investment or that the claimant
controlled the investment in an active and direct manner’."®3 The Respondent also

rejects as inapposite the authorities the Claimant cites on this point.

Addressing the Claimant’s argument that a dividend payment was necessary to facilitate
the merger between Yukos Oil and Sibneft, a joint stock company incorporated in the
Russian Federation in 1995 (“Sibneft”),* the Respondent points out that this cannot be
the case, since Yukos and Sibneft called off the merger before the December 2003 Loan
was made.°!© The Respondent relies on Mr Misamore’s statement in 2009 Russian court
proceedings that the money was loaned to Yukos Oil or other Group companies for their
“cash needs.”647

The Respondent points out that the Claimant has been unable to provide any documentary

2003 Loan “were used to fund Yukos Oil’s continuing operations."

The Respondent likewise claims that the Claimant did not incur any risk, as it was merely

 

“effectuating back-to-back p ona non- basis.“ The Respondent cites
Toto Costruzioni v. Lebanon for the proposition that investment “implies an economical
operation initiated and conducted by an entrepreneur using its own financial means and
at its own financial risk,” something that, according to the Respondent, Yukos Capital did
not do.°° The Respondent also argues that the interest rate spreads between the Loans
and the back-to-back agreements were “trivial,” implying that the Claimant “did not
expect a commercial return.”®! Thus, the Respondent contends, the only purpose for
interposing Yukos Capital was to minimise tax, not for any “economic motivation or
purpose,” since Yukos Capital played no role in cash management, produced no
efficiencies, was not used to collect group funds and (as explained below) did not perform

a foreign exchange function because it bore no risk.

So, in spite of the Claimant’s arguments to the contrary,°™ the Respondent contends that
one cannot view the back-to-back agreements as “hedges” nor can one view interest rate
spreads as evidence of risk-taking by Yukos Capital, as “Yukos Capital paid nothing . . .
in exchange for the non-recourse or indemnification terms” and the “minuscule spreads
are the cost that Yukos Oil Company chose to pay to be able to gain tax benefits in
Luxembourg.”*5 The Respondent submits that “[t]he non-recourse provisions in the
Brittany and Hedgerow agreements were an inherent feature of the scheme, and Yukos
Capital was never meant to have any role other than that of a passive conduit,” as Brittany

and Hedgerow bore all risk associated with the Loans.5%

Further, despite the Claimant’s insistence otherwise, the Respondent notes that the
Claimant has “fail[ed] to produce a single document showing any negotiation about the

[back to back payment agreements],” demonstrating that “the interest rate spreads on the

‘Loans’ were not on ‘arm’s length terms’ or determined with a ‘view to generate
profits’.”°” Yukos Capital’s lack of economic interest in the loans is further shown by
the fact that “Yukos Capital’s litigation efforts have been paid for by other Yukos Group

subsidiaries.”°*

In those circumstances, the Respondent says that because the Claimant played no active
role in the making of the investment, made no contribution and incurred no risk, it cannot
say that it made the “so-called ‘loans”” — and this is “true irrespective of whether the funds
originated from the sale of oil and gas in Russia and the sale of a Russian company, which
in any event the Claimant does not dispute; and this is also true irrespective of whether
these back-to-back transactions amounted in substance to a repatriation of dividends
rather than a lending of funds.”®? The Respondent submits that the transactions were
always conceived as the repatriation of profits, there was no economic purpose to the
transaction and Yukos Capital’s role was not “in accordance with its economic
interests.” In particular, “there was no genuine intent to collect because there was no
genuine intent to repay,”®' which the Respondent submits is demonstrated by Yukos
Capital’s conduct when stress on the Loan arose.5* It also submits that the “economic
imperatives that existed for repatriation at the inception of the loan will remain the same
in the future, leading to rollover or forgiveness”; thus, all the Respondent is “asking the

Tribunal to do is ... take account of the true economic position.”

For all these reasons, the Respondent contends, the Loans do not qualify for protection
under Article 1(6) of the ECT.

(iii) Are the Loans associated with an Economic Activity in the Energy
Sector?

The Respondent further argues that, for an investment to be “associated with an Economic

Activity in the Energy Sector” (set out in Article 1(5) of the ECT), as required under

Article 1(6) of the ECT, there must be a “functional relationship” between the investment
and that activity, rather than merely a “contractual relationship with a company engaged
in economic activities in the Energy Sector.”® The Respondent disputes the Claimant’s
proposition that “any financing provided to an energy company is necessarily
‘[a]ssociated with an economic activity in the energy sector’,” pointing out that the

Claimant has cited no authority in this regard.

The Respondent refers to the decision rendered in Amto v. Ukraine (“Amto”), where the
tribunal had to decide whether shares in a Ukrainian company that had concluded
contracts with a nuclear power generating company for the provision of technical services
constituted an investment protected under Article 1(6) of the ECT.® The tribunal took
the view that “[a] mere contractual relationship with an energy producer is insufficient to
attract ECT protection where the subject matter of the contract has no functional
relationship with the energy sector.”6°7 Since energy producers have “dozens, if not
hundreds, of contracts and contractual counter-parties,” it could “not be in line with the
object and purpose of the ECT to extend its investment protection provisions to all these
contractual counter-parties and their contractual rights without a functional

qualification."

The Respondent suggests that the Loans were not used to engage in any of the economic
activities set out as illustrative of an “Economic Activity in the Energy Sector” in the
ECT Contracting Parties’ Understanding on Article 1(5) ECT.6° They were, according
to the Respondent, rather made to avoid taxes, whilst paying “a massive dividend to
Yukos Oil Company’s majority shareholders” (in the case of the December 2003 Loan)
or “allegedly . . . to pay a small portion of Yukos Oil Company’s back taxes.”®” To the

extent that the Claimant asserts that money from the Loans was used to fund the

operations of Yukos Oil and to pay overdue taxes,°”! the Respondent points out that the
Claimant has not produced evidence in this regard.** As such, the Respondent concludes,
the Loans constituted a “disinvestment” without any “functional relationship” with an

“Economic Activity in the Energy Sector.”©7

(b) The Claimant’s submissions

(i) Do the Loans constitute “other debt of a company,” “claims to

money” or “Returns”?
The Claimant dismisses the Respondent’s reliance on the ejusdem generis principle in its
interpretation of Article 1(6)(b) of the ECT as “literally nonsensical.”® Loans include,

so the Claimant submits, “‘other debt of a company’, ‘debt instruments issued by 2

 

p and ‘debt i in a company’.” Furth , the Claimant adds that “[it]
is aware of no investment treaty anywhere (whether ECT or otherwise) where
‘investment’ definitions relating to debt obligations have been interpreted to exclude

Joans.”675

In response to the Respondent’s characterization of the Loans as dividends, the Claimant
notes that there are two separate issues: first, whether these are loans or dividends, and
second, whether Yukos Capital should be considered to be the lender as a matter of tax
or accounting treatment. The Claimant accepts that the first issue is relevant to the present
analysis, and that if the Respondent can satisfy the Tribunal that the Loans are really
dividends, then the Claimant will fail. But the second question relates to the allocation

of risk between Yukos Capital and its lenders, and is irrelevant to the Tribunal’s task.

On the second issue, the Claimant contends that it need only establish legal ownership —
that Yukos Capital made the Loans — and that matters that go to the degree of control

exercised by Yukos Capital are irrelevant.°”’ For this reason, the Claimant submits that

Yukos Capital could have been (but was not) a conduit, since beneficial ownership and

irrelevant.”6”

. The Loans meet, so the Claimant argues, “virtually uniform” legal tests that distinguish
them from dividends.® Relying on Mr Gleichenhaus’ evidence, the Claimant asserts
that, notwithstanding their inter-company characteristic, the Loans “are consistent with
the substance, form and requirements of debt instruments,” which include “defined
interest payments and a defined maturity date”; “defined rights to enforce the payment of
principal and interest”; “a defined obligation to repay the loans”; “the existence of formal
and duly executed loan agreements”; and “the intention of Yukos Capital and Yukos Oil
to establish a debtor-creditor relationship.”*! | The Claimant submits that
Mr Gleichenhaus’ evidence that the Loans were made on “arm’s length market terms” is
not disputed. The Claimant asserts that Rosneft, a joint stock company incorporated in
the Russian Federation, as well as the Respondent’s tax authorities recognized the

Loans as loans and not dividends.©*

382. The Claimant further posits that the reliance “on intercompany loans for tax effective
financing” is “ubiquitous” and “commonplace in the world of commerce,”°* and that the
fact that the Loans were accounted for in Yukos Oil’s consolidated financial statements
“has nothing to do with, and cannot alter, the legal nature” of the transactions between
Yukos Capital and Yukos Oil.5% Indeed, the Claimant relies on the fact that the Loans

were recorded as a debt of Yukos Oil on the latter’s financial statements — on Yukos Oil’s

balance sheet as a liability and on Yukos Capital’s balance sheet as an asset ~ in support

of the contention that they are loans.”

The Claimant rejects the Respondent's effet wile argument," contending that it “distorts
the principles of effectiveness, by denying the treatment of money as an asset within the
ECT capable of investment and failing to distinguish between the (in common law terms)

intangible property right or chose in action, and the action to enforce it."6®?

The Claimant submits that the Respondent’s characterization of the Loans as dividends
is “dishonest,” as the Respondent has known about the Loans since they were made but
at no time tried to re-characterize them as dividends prior to these arbitral proceedings.
Specifically, the Claimant notes that the Russian tax authorities were given copies of
Yukos Oil’s 2003 and 2004 financial statements in which the Loans were clearly
disclosed.®! Even further, the Claimant notes that, in their December 2003 reassessment
for additional tax, the Russian tax authorities never suggested that the Loans were really
dividends.°” The Claimant points to similar instances where the character of the Loans
was not brought into question, including in a submission by the Russian Federal Tax
Service and a ruling by the Moscow City Arbitration Court. The Claimant dismisses
the contention that the tax authorities did not have sufficient access to information on the
Loans as “laughable given Yukos Oil’s premises were repeatedly raided [and] all
documents were seized” and asserts that the Tribunal should disregard that contention

since the Respondent has not submitted relevant fact witness testimony.

The Claimant further submits that the Respondent also engages in “similar intercompany
lending practices” yet does not characterize those loans as anything but loans.6 The

Claimant cites the example of O0.J.S.C. Gazprom (“Gazprom”), which submitted to

Luxembourg authorities a request for approval of tax treatment. That request describes
an arrangement whereby Gazprom incorporated Gazprom ECP S.A. (“Gazprom ECP”)
as an orphan entity in Luxembourg. The arrangements with Gazprom ECP involved
back-to-back loans and interest rate spreads, with Gazprom ECP earning a margin on its
loans to Gazprom.®’ Further, Gazprom ECP board meetings and shareholder meetings
were held in Luxembourg, and corporate records were kept there. The Claimant notes
that, in the submission to authorities, PricewaterhouseCoopers submitted that “Gazprom
ECP is effectively managed from Luxembourg and qualifies as a Luxembourg tax
resident company.”°§ The Claimant further notes that the Gazprom ECP loans were

taxed by Russia as loans and not as dividends.°?

On the question of whether the Loans were really loans, the Claimant further disputes the
testimony of Professor Lys, the conclusion of which “is based upon a manipulation of the
facts and grossly flawed applications of tax and accounting rules.”” The Claimant calls
into question the accuracy of the facts as told by Professor Lys, arguing that the sources
to which Professor Lys cites — principally, prior statements by officers of Yukos Oil — do
not support his position.”! Instead, the Loans “were undoubtedly loans,” and there is
nothing in the statements cited by Professor Lys that suggests that the investment of funds
into Russia would have been made by dividend if Yukos Capital had not existed.” The
Claimant takes issue with Professor Lys’ methodology of analysis, disagreeing with his
“substance over form” analysis and his focus on the question of whether Yukos Capital
assumed the role of a “typical commercial lender,” an issue that is, according to the
Claimant, “completely irrelevant.”” The Claimant criticizes Professor Lys’ report for
acknowledging that Mr Gleichenhaus’ report focuses on how the Loans have “several

trademark characteristics of loans,” but nevertheless failing to address this observation,

even failing to identify “the defining characteristics that distinguish loans from

dividends.”7

387. Further, the Claimant takes issue with Professor Lys’ “substance over form” analysis that
concluded that Yukos Capital did not bear risk associated with the Loans. The
Claimant maintains that, first, it is an irrelevant test. Citing Professor Shay, the
Claimant contends that the “substance over form” doctrine is relevant only to determining
the tax treatment applicable to a particular transaction, such that “even if some tax
authority were to conclude that the Yukos Oil Loans should be taxed as dividends, and
none ever did, they would still be loans as a legal matter.”?°’ The Claimant and Professor
Shay submit that, if the “substance over form” doctrine were relevant, such analysis
properly concluded would show that “the Yukos Loans would be respected as
indebtedness and such doctrines would not operate to recast the Yukos Loans as dividends

or as anything other than loans.””"8

388. The Claimant further rejects Professor Lys’ determination that “Yukos Capital should
simply be ignored” and the Loans treated as one single loan from Brittany and/or
Hedgerow to Yukos Oil, accepting Professor Shay’s view that, properly analyzed, “Yukos
Capital should be respected as a separate entity and the Yukos Loans should be respected
as separate transactions.”””” The Claimant thus submits that there is “no evidence on

which you could make any kind of a finding that Yukos Capital should be disregarded,”7"°

389. The Claimant also criticizes Professor Lys’ “loose” referral to the rules of accounting and
principles applied by tax authorities, noting that the Claimant’s own expert, Mr Andrew
Grantham, concludes that Russia and Luxembourg applied “form over substance” rules,

making it such that “there is no proper accounting basis on which to suggest the Yukos

Yukos Capital to Yukos Oil were loans, and not dividends.””!?_ The Claimant notes that
Professor Lys’ “interpretation” of the substance over form doctrine “would likely cripple
the corporate finance structures” of United States based international companies.’'? The
Claimant also notes that none of its experts were cross-examined on the substance of their

opinion that these were loans,7!*

390. On the basis of the authorities discussed by these witnesses, the Claimant submits that the
“only relevant enquiry” is whether the borrower intended to repay the funds advanced,
that the Respondent has not alleged a lack of intent to repay,”!> and the “evidence in the
record ... is unequivocal that there was an intent to repay at all relevant times.””!° To the
extent that the Respondent addressed in closing submissions the “intent to recover,” the
Claimant submits that some of this material was not in the record and was, in any case,

irrelevant.”"”

The Claimant also submits that, as defined in Article 1(9) of the ECT, the Loans “are an
‘asset’ owned by Yukos Capital and the obligation of Yukos Oil to repay the Loans,
together with interest thereon, constitute ‘Returns’ as that term is defined in Article 1(9)
ECT.””'8 The Loans constitute, so the Claimant asserts, “valid, legal indebtedness of
Yukos Oil.”7"°

.+. the ‘overall investment’ test of Electrabel has no application.”””! Citing Professor
Douglas’s opinion, the Claimant argues that there is a “fundamental distinction between
‘claims to money’ and ‘loans”” and submits that “[a] loan is the form of credit that features
most prominently as an investment in the corpus of investment treaty precedents.””? In
this light, the Claimant contends that the Loans are in effect “substantial loans” that fall

under the ECT’s protection.”?

393, The Claimant maintains that Article 1(6) makes it clear that the list in that provision “is

supposed to be a broad, illustrative, non-exclusive list of the examples of assets
considered by the parties to be investments, and that “other debt” and “claims to money”
are broad, catch-all terms which may refer to a variety of transactions, in line with the
treaty’s purpose and the broad definition in Article 1(6).””"* Further, “[t]here is no reason
why a particular ‘loan agreement’ cannot comprise or give rise to more than one of the
assets listed in Article 1(6)."”5 In other words, the Loans constitute both debt of a
company and a claim to money.”° The Claimant submits that sources cited by the
Respondent, such as the German Model BIT, confirm that loans are considered claims to
money “only ‘when investment definitions do not expressly mention loans,” a situation
that does not arise with the ECT, since Article 1(6)(b) has a special category for “debt of

a company.”727

394. To the extent that the Respondent suggests that the Loans can only be a “claim to money,”

company.”

(ii) Do the Loans bear the characteristics of an Investment in terms of
Article 1(6)?
The Claimant begins by noting that the Respondent does not dispute that it meets the
definition of “Investor” in Article 1(7) of the ECT.”

The Claimant contends that, in light of Article 31(1) of the VCLT, the “‘ordinary
meaning’ of the terms employed in Article 1(6) is that the definition of ‘Investment’ is
wide and open-ended: an investment is ‘every kind of asset’.””5° The Claimant further
argues that, in spite of the Respondent’s submissions to the contrary, “[nJo tribunal has
emphasized ‘the need to interpret the term “Investment” [i.e. Article 1(6) of the ECT] in

339

accordance with the concept of investment under general international law’” and,

therefore, dismisses the Respondent’s reliance on the Salini test.73!

The Claimant disputes the Respondent’s focus on the “inherent meaning” of
“Investment,””*? arguing that the concerns that motivated the tribunals cited by the
Respondent do not exist in the current arbitration.”? Accordingly, the Claimant asserts
that it is not necessary for the Tribunal to express its view on whether it is proper for an

investment tribunal to “legislate treaty meaning” by way of “inherent” principles.”™4

The Claimant notably highlights E/ectrabel, an arbitration under both the ECT and the
ICSID Convention, in which the tribunal “recognized that Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention and Article 1(6) ECT each has its own test for an investment” and stated that
“[t]he tribunal did not conflate the two tests, or suggest that the Safini or any similar test
had independent significance under the ECT, but correctly proceeded to analyse them
separately.””35 The Claimant also quotes Stati v. Kazakhstan, an arbitration in which the

tribunal concluded that “the so-called Salini test ... cannot be used for the definition of

investment under the ECT or, likewise, in the present case.””* In addition, the Claimant
dismisses the Respondent’s authorities””— including Romak — for “supplementing the
ECT’s terms” as being essentially “irrelevant.””* The Claimant also contends that
(contrary to the Respondent’s assertions) extending treaty protection to “any asset” under

Article 1(6) of the ECT does not run counter to the ECT’s object and purpose.73

399. The Claimant notes that none of the ECT cases in the record applied an inherent
characteristics test to Article 1(6) (the two which did so applying it to Article 25 of the
ICSID Convention).”° Overall, all but two of the awards where the inherent
characteristics test was applied were ICSID cases, where Article 25 gives rise to special
considerations because it uses “investment” in lower case, whereas in the ECT
“Investment” is specifically defined.”' So the Claimant submits that there is “no general
international principle for the application of inherent characteristics, and in fact there is a
positive avoidance of it outside the ICSID context.”"” Thus, the Claimant rejects the
Respondent’s argument that the Claimant must establish that it made an “active
contribution of money or other assets to Respondent’s economy,””? contending that
neither the ECT nor the authorities cited by the Respondent mention such a

requirement. ’4

inherent characteristics test involved distinguishable facts.“5 The Claimant submits that

cases”: for example, in KT Asia the purchase price was not “even remotely arm’s length”

and was met by the manufacture of sham loans.”

Asked by the Tribunal whether, in order to constitute an Investment under Article 1(6),
one has to establish not merely that there is something which takes the legal form of an
asset, but also that there is an economic materialisation of that, in the form of an asset
passing into the territory of the contracting state, the Claimant submitted that it needed to
establish ownership or control of an asset which creates rights and obligations which are
deemed to have their location in the host state.” There is, the Claimant’s submits, no
need to establish a contribution or flow of funds, noting that if an investor purchases
shares in a public listed company on the exchange, it may have contributed nothing to the

company itself, but would nevertheless still hold an investment in that company.”

In any event, the Claimant asserts that the Loans satisfy the “Salini test.” The Claimant
argues that “[it] committed funds, indeed, approximately US$ 3.2 billion, to Yukos Oil
with the purpose to receive repayment plus interest and profit from the interest rate spread
between the Loans and Yukos Capital’s own cost of funds,””*° which ultimately flowed

into the Respondent’s economy”" at “a real risk” that effectively materialized.’

On the subject of contribution, the Claimant asserts that the principal amounts of the
Loans “were in fact disbursed into the Respondent’s economy and used for Yukos Oil’s
business in Russia’s energy sector.””*? The Loans transferred from outside Russia into
Russia US$3.5 billion of capital, so that would satisfy any requirement to establish a flow

of funds or some contribution of value.”

404. That those funds represented the repatriation of profits, or may have originated at one
point in time in the host state, is legally irrelevant.’*> These were Yukos Capital’s funds,
they were never the property of Yukos Oil, and the origin of the funds and whether Yukos
Capital controlled them is immaterial.” Citing the report of Professor Lys, the Claimant
says that the funds originated in the “earnings” of international companies.” Those
funds belong as a matter of law and property to those companies, a decision was made to
invest those funds in Russia in a tax-efficient way, and the result was an international
injection of funds.”** In the Claimant’s submission, the Respondent has not identified “a
single authority that suggests the origin and source of funds is relevant” to the Tribunal’s
decision.” In any case, there was nothing about the funds loaned under the August 2004
Loan that were Russian, since they represented the proceeds of the sale by an international

company of an asset that happened to be located in Russia.”

405. The Claimant admits that “[i]f one takes only a short term/snap view of Yukos Oil’s
treasury operations at the time,” an amount of RUR 26 billion disbursed on 8 December

2003 pursuant to the December 2003 Loan “could be said to have been applied toward a

9761

dividend payment to Yukos Oil’s shareholders. However, that dividend payment

would have been “required to implement a merger between Yukos Oil and Sibneft”””? by

adjusting Yukos’ debt leverage ratio.”

406. The remaining proceeds of the December 2003 Loan were used, according to the

Claimant, “for working capital to fund the continuing operations of Yukos Oil” against

the backdrop of “the increasingly hostile and illegal acts of the Russian authorities.””*

The proceeds of the August 2004 Loan “were to be used by Yukos Oil to make a partial

payment toward the immense . . . tax assessments that formed part of the Respondent’s

strategy for the expropriation of Yukos assets and destruction of . .. Yukos Oil.”765

As for the Respondent’s argument that the contribution must be made “in furtherance of
a venture,””® the Claimant argues that the decision from which the Respondent took the
criterion (Romak) may be distinguished from the present arbitration and that, in any event,

Yukos Oil qualified as a “venture.”7"

. On the subject of risk, the Claimant submits that the only issue is how the risk was

allocated between Yukos Capital and Brittany and Hedgerow, but that this has “nothing
to do with whether the loans had risk.””6* Moreover, Yukos Capital had its own risk
because it had its own expected profits. The Claimant describes as “ridiculous” the
suggestion that Yukos Capital was protected against the risk of not receiving the spread,
arguing that there is nothing in the record to suggest that the non-recourse nature of the

back-to-back Loans was intended to function as an indemnification of Yukos Capital.’

Moreover, the Claimant posits that “the source of funds for an investment is not relevant
even in non-ECT cases”””! nor is it “relevant to an assessment of the legal relationship
created between Yukos Capital and Yukos Oil or the nature of that indebtedness.””” The
Claimant contends that “Respondent’s conception of whether the funds advanced
pursuant to the Yukos Oil Loans were Claimant’s funds makes little sense in the context
of commercial lending” as it “would effectively require tribunals to make detailed
forensic examinations into the source of funds to determine on some unarticulated test
whose funds were loaned.”””? The Claimant distinguishes the investment treaty awards

that the Respondent cites in this regard from the circumstances of the present case,”

Additionally, the Claimant rejects the Respondent’s apparent complaint that the Loans
represent an “ordinary commercial transaction,” as they bear no resemblance to a sale of
goods contract, such that the authorities relied upon by the Respondent in this regard “are
clearly distinguishable and therefore irrelevant.””’> The Claimant quotes Professor
Douglas for the proposition that “[a] loan is the form of credit that features most

prominently as an investment in the corpus of investment treaty precedents.”7”

As for the Respondent’s argument that the funds loaned by Yukos Capital to Yukos Oil
were “profits generated . . . in Russia,” the Claimant first argues that there was no alleged
circular flow of funds, as “Yukos Oil never owned the funds at issue until it received them
in its capacity as a borrower from Yukos Capital.”””’ The Claimant adds that, in any
event, the source of the funds is irrelevant, a proposition it seeks to support by several
past investment treaty awards.’ Additionally, the Claimant points out that the object
and purpose of the ECT “strongly counsel against any restrictive reading that might

deprive [intercompany lending] of protection” under the ECT.77?

(iii) Are the Loans associated with an Economic Activity in the Energy
Sector?
The Claimant submits that “the purpose of the Loans was to advance billions of dollars

to a major oil company whose only activities were in the energy sector.”7®°

The Claimant emphasizes the importance of the factual context in the interpretation of
Article 1(6) in light of the ECT’s object and purpose.”! The Claimant dismisses the
Respondent’s reliance on the decision in Amto on the basis that the “Claimant invested
directly in an energy company” in contrast to the claimant in Ato.” Moreover, the
Claimant asserts that “[it] is aware of no authority, and Respondent cites none, where a

tribunal has examined the use of proceeds of equity or debt financing provided directly

to an energy company to determine whether that financing was ‘associated with’ activity

in the energy sector.”783

The ECT Contracting Parties’ Understanding on Article 1(5) of the ECT is, so the
Claimant argues, merely “illustrative” and cannot be construed so as to “only attract
protection under the ECT if the funds are used by [a] company specifically for the
physical or actual exploration, production, transportation, marketing or sale of oil and not
the related necessary ancillary tasks of running a company dedicated to those
activities.””** The Claimant argues that such an interpretation would be “unworkable and
... produces absurd results.”78° While reiterating that the December 2003 Loan “was
necessary” for the financing of the Yukos Oil and Sibneft merger, and the August 2004
Loan for the payment of taxes,”®* the Claimant concludes that “[t]here is no question that
direct equity and debt investments in energy companies are associated with their activities

and attract the protection of the Treaty.”7°?

The Claimant cites British Caribbean Bank v. Belize as authority for the proposition that
“the benefit of a loan agreement is to be found in the location to which the funds were

disbursed.”78

The Claimant rejects the suggestion that a different test applies to equity and debt, noting
that if an investor purchases equity in a public listed oil company on the exchange, then
the company usually never sees the money at all. Accordingly, there is no place for a

“use of proceeds” test.”8

The Claimant disputes the Respondent’s allegation that the Claimant has not provided
evidence supporting its statement as to the use of the Loans, noting that the witness

statements of Mr Misamore shed light on such use and that it is the Respondent’s burden

to establish that he is being untruthful.”° Moreover, even if the Claimant had the burden
of establishing the use of the Loans (which Claimant maintains it does not), the burden
would have shifted to the Respondent because the Respondent has control of the relevant

documents (following the seizure of Yukos Oil’s records).”"!

Further, the Claimant maintains that, in spite of the Respondent's arguments to the
contrary,” the merger with Sibneft had not been called off before the execution of the
December 2003 Loan.” The rest of the funds were used for Yukos Oil’s ongoing
business, which can be interpreted as nothing other than “activity in the energy sector.”7"4
The Claimant adds that the payment of dividends “is part of the normal and necessary

activities of an energy company” and does not constitute “disinvestment.”79

3. The Tribunal’s analysis

(a) The material issues

The question before the Tribunal under this challenge to its jurisdiction ratione materiae
may conveniently be stated, in the pertinent terms of Articles 1(6) and 26(1) of the ECT,

as:

Whether the Claimant “own[s]” an “asset” constituted by a “debt of a company”
“associated with an Economic Activity in the Energy Sector” in the “Area” of the
Respondent such that it has made an “Investment” to which the present dispute with

the Respondent “relat[es].”

The definition of “Investment” in Article 1(6) of the ECT “means every kind of asset,
owned directly or indirectly by an Investor.” The definition then sets out a non-exhaustive
list of categories of asset. The Tribunal has framed the issue in terms that are derived

from Article 1(6)(b), which refers, inter alia, to the “debt of a company.”

PCA Case No. 2013-31
Interim Award on Jurisdiction
Page 147 of 195

The Claimant also submits that its “asset” is comprised by either “claims to money” under
Article 1(6)(c) or “[rjeturns” under Article 1(6)(e). The Tribunal approaches the issue by
reference to whether the Claimant owns the ‘debt of a company” under Article 1(6)(b),
since, for reasons that are developed below, this characterisation appears to the Tribunal
to be the most apt description of the Claimant’s Loans. It would only be if the Loans did
not meet that characterisation that it would be necessary to go on to consider whether in

the alternative they might be characterised as “claims to money” or “[rJeturns.”

In light of the specific arguments that have been developed before the Tribunal in relation
to the facts and circumstances of this case, this major question gives rise on the Tribunal’s

analysis to two distinct sub-issues:

() Whether the sums that the Claimant paid to Yukos Oil under the Loans were not
advanced as a loan, and therefore did not constitute a “debt of a company” but rather

amounted to dividends.

(ii) Alternatively, if the sums advanced were by way of loan, whether it is not the

Claimant but rather Brittany and Hedgerow that own that asset.

If the answer to either of these sub-issues were “yes,” the consequence would be that the
Tribunal would have no jurisdiction because the Claimant would not “own” an “asset”

constituting an “Investment” upon which it could in law found a claim:

(a) In the first case that would be because, upon disbursement of the funds, the
Claimant would have irrevocably relinquished any claim to repayment. It
would no longer own an asset constituted by the chose in action under the Loan.
Rather the funds would, from the moment of their transfer, be an asset of Yukos
Oil. The Claimant accepts that, if this were the case, it would not have an

“Investment.”76

(b) In the second case, if the sums were to be treated as having been extended by
way of loan, there would be an asset remaining in the hands of the lender, but

the lender would not be the Claimant.

In both cases, but in different ways, the Respondent invites the Tribunal to look beyond
the form of the particular Loans to consider the alleged economic substance of the
transactions at issue. It invites the Tribunal to treat the transaction as including wider
elements from the context beyond the specific transfers from the Claimant to Yukos Oil.

It relies on both:

(a) Steps in the transfer of assets prior to Yukos Capital’s receipt of the funds. The
Respondent alleges that the funds may be traced from Russian subsidiaries of
Yukos Oil. In particular, it alleges that the true transferors are Brittany and

Hedgerow, not the Claimant; and,

(b) Steps subsequent to the receipt of the funds by Yukos Oil. In particular, it relies
upon a contemporaneous payment by Yukos Oil of a dividend to its
shareholders. Claimant alleges that this payment was made in connection with

the planned merger between Yukos Oil and Sibneft.”””

It is important to be clear about precisely what it is that the Respondent invites the

Tribunal to find in this respect and what it does not.

The Respondents case in this regard is not that the Loans should be treated as shams. It
submits that it is not necessary for the Tribunal to obliterate the legal rights and duties of
the Parties under the legal regime applicable to the Loans. Rather those Loans should be
re-characterised for the specific and different purpose of considering whether they

constitute an “Investment” under the ECT.

The essence of this submission is well explained in the following passage from the

transcript. There are two steps in the Respondent’s submission:

(a) The Respondent first invites the Tribunal to find that the two possible ways of re-
characterising the transaction identified in paragraph 422 above result “when
analysed in economic substance” in a single transaction: a dividend payment from

Brittany or Hedgerow as the case may be to Yukos Oil:

"97 Respondent: para. 368 above; Claimant: paras. 405 — 406 above.

[What appear to be two loan transactions are at most one: from Brittany to
Yukos and from Hedgerow to Yukos. And then when analysed in economic
substance, we suggest that that is equivalent to and always was intended to
have the effect of a dividend to Yukos Oil.

[Tribunal Member]: So when you said “to Yukos”, you meant to Yukos Oil?

[Counsel for Respondent]: Correct.”

(b) The Respondent then submits that such re-characterisation does not affect the legal
obligations of the Parties “in other spheres.” It is limited to a finding of “the true
transaction” for the purpose of the question whether there is an “Investment” under
the ECT:

[I]t is quite possible for one legal regime to disregard the legal form of an
arrangement to test its true economic substance for purposes of determining

the significance of those arrangements for a different legal regime. ...

(R]echaracterisation of these transactions for purposes of analysis under the
ECT does not mean that you’re piercing the corporate veil, does not mean that
you’re obliterating what legal obligations or rights those parties might have in
other spheres. [t means that you’re analysing the true transaction for the
purposes of determining whether there is a protected investment under the

Energy Charter Treaty.

[A]ny decision that you make about whether this is a protected investment has
no consequence for the parties to the transaction as to their legal obligations.
That’s something for them to deal with in a different setting. Just as a
recharacterisation for tax purposes would not affect the legal obligations of

the parties in a different setting.”

428. In order to address these submissions, the Tribunal must therefore decide, on the evidence
before it, as to the particular character of the transaction at issue and for the purpose of

jurisdiction (and not otherwise):

(a) Whether the extent of the jurisdiction ratione materiae granted under the ECT
requires it to re-characterise a transaction (the legality of which is not disputed)

in terms of “economic substance”; and,

(b) If so, whether that would have the consequence that the Claimant does not have

an “Investment” that can found a claim under the ECT before this Tribunal.

(b) A loan associated with an Economic Activity in the Energy Sector

429. In approaching this question, it is necessary for the Tribunal to make preliminary findings
of law on two other aspects of the issue that were traversed in argument. These findings
will only be relevant if and to the extent that the transaction is properly to be characterised
as a loan. Nevertheless they will assist in focusing on the specific nature of the central

issues for decision. These issues are:

(a) Whether a loan that is associated with an Economic Activity in the Energy
Sector is capable of constituting an “Investment” for the purpose of the ECT;

and,

(b) What is the content of the connecting factor denoted by “associated with an

Economic Activity in the Energy Sector.”

430. A loan as a form of “Investment.” In the first place, the Tribunal finds that, where a
company makes a loan that is “associated with an Economic Activity in the Energy
Sector,” such a loan is capable of constituting “debt” that is an “Investment” for the

purpose of the ECT.

431.

This conclusion results from the ordinary meaning of Article 1(6)(b) of the ECT. The
Tribunal does not accept the Respondent’s submission that, as a matter of construction,
Article 1(6)(b) is incapable of including such a loan. It does not accept that “other debt of
a company” is to be read down to include only instruments equivalent to a “bond.” The
Respondent’s argument that “other debt of a company” must be limited to “debt

instruments issued by a company” would involve reading into Article 1(6) words that are

not there. The use in the Treaty of the word “other debt of a company” refers, in its
ordinary meaning, to the existence of an obligation of indebtedness on the part of a
company. In the hands of the “Investor” such a debt is capable of constituting an “asset”

for the purpose of the definition of “Investment.”

Such a debt is not purely, as Respondent submitted, a “claim[] to money ... pursuant to
contract” under Article 1(6)(c). The debt will give rise to a contractual relationship of
debtor and creditor, the incidents of which are determined by reference to the terms of
such a contract. The debt also gives rise to a chose in action that is an “asset” — a property

interest of the “Investor.”

This conclusion, arrived at as a matter of the construction of the ordinary meaning of
Article 1(6)(b) pursuant to Article 31(1) of the VCLT, is further supported by
consideration of the approach that has been taken to the question whether loans that are
linked to an economic venture may be considered as an investment in general
international law, to which the Tribunal makes reference pursuant to Article 31(3)(c) of
the VCLT.

It is not the case that a loan, considered in isolation, is ipso facto an investment; rather
reference to these authorities supports the Tribunal’s view that the critical distinction is

the extent to which the loan is linked to an economic venture in the host state.

This point has been emphasised in both the jurisprudence and the doctrine. In CSOB v.
Slovak Republic, the tribunal held:

Loans as such are therefore not excluded from the notion of an investment under
Article 1(1) of the BIT. It does not follow therefrom, however, that any loan and, in
particular, the loan granted by CSOB to the Slovak Collection Company meets the
requirements of an investment ... under Article 1(1) of the BIT, which speaks of an
“asset invested or obtained by an investor of one Party in the territory of the other
Party.”

The | scheme embodied in the C idation Agr shows, however,

that the CSOB Ioan to the Slovak Collection Company is closely related to and

cannot be disassociated from all other transactions involving the restructuring of
CSOB.

The basic feature of the Consolidation Agreement was not the financial consolidation
of CSOB as such, but the development of the role and activities of CSOB in both
Republics.”

436. By contrast, in Joy Mining Machinery Ltd v. Egypt®°! and in Alps Finance®™ the loan was
linked respectively with a contract of sale and a contract of assignment. It was not linked
with an underlying economic venture capable of constituting an investment. It followed

that the loan itself could not constitute an investment.

437. Doctrine also supports the proposition that a loan may constitute an investment, provided
that it is linked to an underlying economic venture in the host state. Douglas explains the

point in the following way:

The provision of credit by the investor to an entrepreneur or enterprise engaged in
commercial activities in the host state qualifies as an investment. The investor
acquires rights to a debt, which can be assigned and thus has the feature of a right ir

vem. Credit can take the form of a loan....

A loan is the payment of money by the investor to the debtor (an entrepreneur or
enterprise engaged in commercial activities in the host state) upon terms that the sum

advanced, with any stipulated interest, must be repaid by the debtor in due course,

A loan is the form of credit that features most prominently as an investment in the

corpus of investment treaty precedents.*°

438. “Associated with an Economic Activity in the Energy Sector.” Within the framework of
the ECT, the nature of the requisite link is prescribed by the final paragraph of Article
1(6), which specifies: “‘Investment’ refers to any investment associated with an
Economic Activity in the Energy Sector.” Such Activity is further defined in Article 1(5)
as “an economic activity concerning the exploration, extraction, refining, production,
storage, land transport, transmission, distribution, trade, marketing or sale of Energy

Materials and Products.”

439. The connecting factor “associated with” is relevantly defined in the Oxford English
Dictionary as “ d with an organization or business.”®4 The conseq of the
use of this phrase by the treaty drafters is that it suffices that the contribution made by
way of loan in turn contributes to an enterprise that is itself engaged in an Economic

Activity in the Energy Sector.

440. The business of Yukos Oil is described in its audited 2004 Accounts as “exploring of oil
and gas deposits, extracting of oil and gas, selling of oil and other products, and providing
of services.”*°> This activity falls squarely within the ECT definition of an Economic
Activity in the Energy Sector. This is further confirmed by the Understanding of Article
1(5) that the representatives agreed to by signing the Final Act, which refers specifically
to (i) “prospecting and exploration for, and extraction of, e.g., oil [and] gas” as well as
(iii) its “land transportation, distribution, storage and supply” and (vi) “marketing and
sale of, and trade in Energy Materials and Products, e.g. retail sales of gasoline,” together
with (vii) “research, consulting, planning, management and design activities related to the

activities mentioned above.”®°S

441.

The Tribunal does not accept the Respondent’s submission that the loan itself must be
devoted to the activity. The term used in the Treaty is “associated with,” which, as the

Tribunal has found, is met where the investment by way of loan goes to support an

enterprise that itself carries out the defined economic activities in the area of the relevant
state.

The construction placed on this phrase by the Tribunal in Amdo, an authority relied upon
by the Respondent, is consistent with this interpretation when read in its proper context.

dd.

In that case, the tribunal was asub that a mere 1 rel ‘

iB P
with an energy company (such as “contracts of a power station for publishing, advertising
or security services”) would not be “associated with” an Economic Activity in the Energy

Sector.°” The tribunal held:

[T]he interpretation of the words ‘associated with’ involves a question of degree, and
refers primarily to the factual rather than legal association between the alleged
investment and an Economic Activity in the Energy Sector. A mere contractual
relationship with an energy producer is insufficient to attract ECT protection where
the subject matter of the contract has no functional relationship with the energy
sector. The open-textured phrase ‘associated with’ must be interpreted in accordance
with the object and purpose of the ECT, as expressed in Article 2. The associated
activity of any alleged investment must be energy related, without itself needing to
Satisfy the definition in Article 1(5) of an Economic Activity in the Energy Sector.*

In Amito itself, the contribution made by the claimant was in the form of the provision of
technical services directly related to the production of electrical energy, which services

the tribunal held amounted to an “Investment.”

The present case concerns a direct financial contribution to an enterprise that is engaged
in an Economic Activity in the Energy Sector. An interpretation in accordance with the
purpose of the ECT, is, as Article 2 states, to be “in accordance with the objectives and
principles of the Charter.” The Objectives of the European Energy Charter itself include
“to create a climate favourable to the operation of enterprises and to the flow of
investments” and “promoting best possible access to capital.”®° A loan to an enterprise

that is engaged in an Economic Activity in the Energy Sector meets this objective.

These preliminary findings are subject to the issues of law and fact as to the economic
substance of the transaction that have already been identified, to which the Tribunal must

now turn.

(c) The materialization of an “Investment”

446. The Tribunal takes as its point of departure for analysis of the “economic substance”
argument the premise that inherent in the concept of “Investment” is both a legal and an

economic materialization.
447. This requirement is reflected in Article 1(6) of the ECT:

(a) The list at the outset of Article 1(6) is concerned with identifying “assets.” Its
focus is on proprietary rights “owned or controlled” by the Investor. Such rights
form the legal basis of a right the invasion of which by a respondent state may

be the subject of a claim under the Treaty.

(b) The final paragraph of Article 1(6) then adds an economic element in stating
that “‘Investment’ refers to any investment associated with an Economic

Activity in the Energy Sector.”

448. The use in this last sentence of “investment” in lower case emphasises that the drafters of
the Treaty desired to distinguish the legal materialization of the asset from the factual

enquiry into its association with economic activity — both elements being required!

449. This dual aspect of “Investment” in investment treaties has been expressed in the cases

as being between:

(a) The legal aspect: “the asset belonging to the clai ” or “fruits and assets

resulting from the investment”; and

(b) The economic aspect: “a commitment of resources” or “contributions that have

created such fruits and assets.”*!!

*!0 The Parties consider the general significance of this reference to “investment”: Memorial, para. 93; Counter-
Memorial, para. 198; Reply, para. 251. The Tribunal here makes a more specific finding on construction of this
sentence.

450. Both elements must be present to constitute an investment. As it was put in KT Asia:

The assets listed in Article 1(1)(a) of the BIT are the result of the act of investing.
They presuppose an investment in the sense of a commitment of resources. Without
such a commitment of resources, the asset belonging to the claimant cannot

constitute an investment within the meaning of ... the BIT.

[A]ssets cannot be protected unless they result from contributions, and contributions
will not be protected unless they have actually produced the assets of which the

investor claims to have been deprived.®!?
451. Each of these elements entails a different type of enquiry.

452. The legal materialization of the Investment is to be determined according to the law
applicable to the asset in question, which requires a renvoi to municipal law. The tribunal

in Emmis International Holding BV v. Hungary explained this point in the following way:

The need to identify a proprietary interest ... is confirmed by the definition of
‘investment’ in the Treaties. In each case, the Treaty refers compendiously to ‘every
kind of asset[s]’. The Oxford English Dictionary definition of ‘asset’ is:

(usually assets) an item of property owned by a person or company, regarded

as having value and available to meet debts, commitments or legacies.

The definitions in the Treaties go on to provide particular examples of types of
property or rights that may constitute an asset for this purpose. But these examples
are not exhaustive.

In order to determine whether an investor/claimant holds property or assets capable
of constituting an investment it is necessary in the first place to refer to host State
law. Public international law does not create property rights. Rather, it accords
certain protections to property rights created according to municipal law. As the
EnCana Tribunal put it:

[FJor there to have been an expropriation of an investment or return ... the

rights affected must exist under the law which creates them. [ ... ].°">

In its challenge to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, the Respondent does not seek to
challenge the validity of the Loans according to the law applicable to them.®4 The result
is that the legal materialization of the Loans must be treated as having been satisfied for

the purpose of determining this element of “Investment.”

The concept of the economic materialization of an investment is concerned with an
essentially factual question, namely whether the investor has in fact made a “commitment
of resources.” In the case of the ECT, such a contribution must be “associated with an

Economic Activity in the Energy Sector.”

In the present case, the fact that funds extended under the Loans were transferred to Yukos
Oil in Russia is undisputed. The Respondent nevertheless submits that inherent in the
ECT concept of “Investment” are the twin elements of “contribution” and “risk” and that
assessment of these requires consideration of the “economic substance” of the transaction.

The Tribunal will take each of these elements in turn.

(d) Contribution
The Tribunal has already found that the economic materialization of an investment within
the ECT assumes that the Investor makes a contribution associated with an Economic

Activity in the Energy Sector.

The Respondent advances its argument under this head on two bases: origin of capital
and the alleged economic effect of the loans as a dividend. Each of these submissions

may be summarised as follows:

(a) Origin of capital. In economic terms, the funds that were used originated in
Russia. The Respondent submits that the funds were being “round-tripped from

the Russian Federation to the Russian Federation at the request of the Russian

parent company.”*'> The return of the same funds to Russia thus affords no

“contribution” to economic activities within Russia.

{b) Economic effect of a loan as a dividend. The Respondent argues that the loan
was in economic substance a dividend to Yukos Oil, the parent company of the

group; that being the objective that Yukos Oil desired to achieve.

458. These allegations raise questions of fact to which the Tribunal will shortly tun. It is first

necessary to consider the parameters of the issues as a matter of law.
459. The first of the arguments raises two preliminary questions:

(a) The relevance as a matter of law of the origin of the capital utilised by an

investor to make its investment.

(b) The extent to which an intra-group loan, funded within a corporate group, may

itself constitute an “Investment.”

460. Origin of capital. Construction of the terms of the ECT does not indicate that the
jurisdictional requirement of an “Investment” is to be tested by reference to the origin of
the funds drawn upon by the Investor for the purpose of making its investment. The
requirement is simply that the Investment be “owned or controlled directly or indirectly
by an Investor.” An “Investor” means relevantly “a company or other organization
organized in accordance with the law applicable in that Contracting Party.”®'6 It is not

disputed in this case that the Claimant is an “Investor.”

461.

Generally, the origin of the funds used by an investor is legally irrelevant to the
jurisdictional question of whether that person has made an investment, absent an express
provision to the contrary. The tribunal in Caratube International Oil Company LLP v.

Republic of Kazakhstan (“Caratube”) summarises the position:

[S]ubject to express provisions to the contrary, the origin of capital used to make an

investment is immaterial for jurisdiction purposes. However, there still needs to be

Interim Award on Jurisdiction
Page 159 of 195
some economic link between that capital and the purported investor that enables the

Tribunal to find that a given investment is an investment of that particular investor.®!”

462. The Caratube tribunal adds an important footnote to this passage: “The capital can come
from the investor’s own funds located in any country, from its subsidiaries or affiliates

located in any country, from loan, credit or other arrangements.”*'8

46.

w

. This principle confirms the interpretation arrived at by reference to the ordinary meaning
of the words of Article | of the ECT, That this is necessarily so (absent an express
decision on the part of treaty parties to create a special contrary regime) results from
consideration both of the nature of capital and the purpose of investment promotion and
protection by treaty. Money is by its nature fungible, and, save in exceptional
circumstances, it will not usually be possible to trace funds so as to be able to find that
sums in the account of one person are the same as, or specifically derived from, those in
the account of another person. In both cases they are likely in the nature of things to have

been mixed with funds from other sources.

464. Tracing the origin of funds is not the concern of investment treaties. Such treaties do not
ask how the investor raised the funds that it drew upon in order to invest. It might do so
on the capital markets; or by borrowing funds from a commercial bank or from a related
company. The investor is not restricted to utilising funds from its own commercial
operations (funds that may in any event “originate” with third parties with which it
trades). What matters for the purpose of an investment treaty is that the investor has
decided to contribute those funds towards an enterprise or economic activity in the host
state and in the process has acquired and owns an asset that leaves the investor with a

stake in that enterprise or economic activity.

465.

a

It would be contrary to the object and purpose of the ECT to circumscribe the ways in
which an investor is permitted to acquire the capital needed to make an investment. That

would not “create a climate favourable to the operation of enterprises and to the flaw of

investments” or “promot{e] best possible access to capital.”*!

466. Intra-group loans. Does it matter for this purpose if the funds that are utilised are derived

467.

from intra-group transfers within a group of companies? The award on which the
Respondent places particular reliance in this regard is KT Asia. In that case, the tribunal
had to address the question whether the claimant “must itself have made a contribution
or whether it can benefit from a contribution made by someone else.”®° The claimant
did not dispute that it made no injection of fresh capital. It argued that an inter-company
transfer in the context of an internal restructuring within a group of companies still
amounts to a contribution. The tribunal assumed for the sake of discussion that no new
investment is required where an investment is transferred from one group affiliate to
another. It then addressed whether there was in the case before it “a corporate group as
this concept is generally understood in corporate and tax law as well as under accounting

and financial reporting standards,”®2!

The tribunal in KT Asia characterised the concept of a group of companies in the

following terms:

It is common knowledge that a group of companies ~ such as Exxon Mobil in the
first case invoked by the Claimant or Nomura in the second — exists when two or
more corporations are under common corporate ownership or control. Ordinarily,
companies owned or controlled by one individual do not qualify as a corporate group
though sometimes national legislation may so treat them. Although composed of
separate legal entities, which must comply with the legal and regulatory
requirements applicable to them, groups generally operate as a single economic
entity with a common objective and strategy and a group management, In such a
case, the group may report its financial results on a consolidated basis; its group
status may be taken into account for tax purposes (subject to dealing at arms’ length);
and national law may impose certain liabilities to sanction any misuse of the group

structure.°2

468. It then contrasted the position in the facts before it:

In the present case, Mr Ablyazov beneficially owned and controlled many companies
through nominees and individuals whom he trusted and who (directly or indirectly)

owned or controlled the shares. These nominees and other individuals acted on Mr
Ablyazov's instructions and were required not to disclose that they held or controlled
the shares for his benefit. Mr Ablyazov was never himself a shareholder in any of
the companies, Indeed, it is the Tribunal’s understanding that there was no single
person (whether corporate or individual) who had legal title to the shares in the

companies held for the ultimate benefit of Mr Ablyazov.

Consequently, there was no holding company and no single individual shareholder
directly or indirectly connecting all the companies of which Mr Ablyazov was the
beneficial owner. Neither was there a single economic unity, not to speak of
consolidation for financial reporting or tax purposes. This aggregation of assets in
the form of a myriad of companies is in reality the antithesis of a group. To treat
Mr Ablyazov’s ultimate beneficial ownership of all the various companies via
nominees and trusted agents as a sufficient connecting factor to create a group would
be nonsensical. Indeed, the whole purpose of the structure was to conceal
Mr Ablyazov's interest and make it look as if the different entities that held blocks

of shares in BTA were independent of him and of each other.”
469. The tribunal concluded that:

[T]here was a number of entities all owned by nominees of Mr Ablyazov, who
disposed of the companies and their assets as of his own without regard to their
separate legal personalities .... Mr Ablyazov used the companies as his ‘pockets’
shifting assets from one to the other solely to suit his own purposes .... There may
be nothing unlawful in Mr Ablyazov treating the assets of companies formally
owned by other persons as his personal property. However, he cannot do so and at
the same time argue that the companies should be treated as a conventional

commercial group when it comes to claiming treaty protection.®™

470. The essence of the tribunal’s finding in KT Asia is that the assets in question were the
property of Mr Ablyazov and not that of the claimant, which was a bare nominee or sham
designed to conceal Mr Ablyazov’s true beneficial interest. In making this finding, the
tribunal contrasted the position with that of inter-company transfers within a corporate

group. While the KT Asia tribunal was not called upon to decide the circumstances in

which an inter-company transfer within a corporate group might amount to a contribution
for the purpose of finding an “Investment,” it did not decide that such an arrangement per

se fails to qualify.

The Tribunal does not consider that an inter-company transfer within a corporate group
can be excluded as such from qualifying as a contribution for the purpose of investment
law. As the first cited passage from the XT Asia award explains very well, there may be
areal distinction between the treatment of a corporate group as a “single economic entity”
in economic terms and for purposes of consolidated group accounting and the legal and
regulatory requirements applicable to the separate legal entities within such a group.
There is no inconsistency in this distinction. It reflects the simple fact that the disciplines
of economics and consolidated accounting on the one hand, and law on the other, are

addressed to different aspects of business activity.

The ECT promotes and protects “Investments” “associated with Economic Activities in
the Energy Sector” within the “Area” of each signatory State, being “the territory under
its sovereignty.”®5 These objectives proceed from the premise that states will benefit
under the ECT by the flow of investments and capital into economic activities in their

territory.

This structure reflects an elementary fact of the organisation of contemporary economic
life in the relation between commercial enterprises and sovereign states. A corporate
group may be organised into numerous different companies that operate in diverse
different states. By contrast, a state is defined in part by reference to territory. This is
reflected in the terms of the ECT, which, in Article 1(10), defines “Area” with respect to
a state that is a Contracting Party by reference to “the territory under its sovereignty.”
The objectives that the signatories to the European Energy Charter sought to achieve for
each participating state are objectives that must produce their effects within the territory
of that state. “Investment” is therefore inherently concerned with a contribution

associated with economic activities in such territory.

In approaching this question, the Tribunal does not consider that the concept of the

economic materialization of an Investment protected under Article 1(6) of the ECT is

825 ECT, Art. 1(10) (Exhibit C-1).

limited in such a way that it would exclude loans made between two companies within
the same corporate group. A decision on the part of one subsidiary company within a
multinational oil and gas group to make a loan to another group company that is engaged
in economic activities in the energy sector in another state party to the ECT would (in
principle and absent other contrary evidence) constitute an “Investment.” It would be a
“contribution” to those economic activities in the energy sector within the host state and
thus meet the object and purpose of the Treaty. If the loan had not been made, the funds
may still be within the multinational group in economic terms (and for the purpose of
consolidated group accounts). The funds, however, not having been applied by way of a
loan, would lack both of the elements of an Investment. There would be no legal
materialization. Nor would the funds have given rise to an economic materialization by

being associated with an economic activity within the territory of the host state.

475. The Tribunal must therefore now analyse on the facts as adduced before it whether the
particular features of this transaction operate in such a way that these particular Loans,
though their legal materialization is not disputed, cannot be regarded as making an

economic contribution to Russia.

476. The Tribunal has already found on the facts that funds advanced under the December
2003 Loan came to Yukos Capital through Brittany from the profits of oil trading
activities within the Yukos Group, including those held by two of its Russian subsidiaries,

Ratibor and Fargoil.526

477.

a

The funds advanced under the August 2004 Loan were derived from the sale of
Hedgerow’s shareholding in Rospan, a Russian company. Yukos Oil was the ultimate

owner of that equity interest through intermediate holding companies.®”

478. Mr Misamore explained that he took a deliberate decision to repatriate the proceeds of

these sales as loans for the following reason:

The only reason why the funds were repatriated to Yukos [Oil] in Russia through the
use of intra-company loans is simple: tax minimization and cash management

flexibility strategy, which was and continues to be today a common practice not only

for Russian companies, but by virtually all companies involved in international

commerce,

Specifically, if a foreign subsidiary of a multi-national corporation repatriates its
funds in the offshore accounts to a parent in Russia permanently, such as through a
dividend payment, the company must pay withholding tax in the jurisdiction where
the company is incorporated and/or domiciled. If, on the other hand, the foreign
entity loans the funds to either a holding company or its subsidiary in Russia, then
the transfer qualifies for either 0% or a minimal, depending on a local tax regime,
withholding tax.®*

479. It follows from this that the Treasury Department of Yukos Oil identified that it had to

S

make a specific choice between making inter-group company payments by way of

dividend and by way of loan.

The initial payments from the Russian trading subsidiaries Ratibor and Fargoil to their
Cyprus affiliates were made by dividend. Those payments were taxed at the rate
prescribed in the Russia-Cyprus Double Tax Treaty.*”° It forms no part of the evidence
before the Tribunal at this jurisdictional stage to suggest that this expatriation of funds
was unlawful under Russian law.®° At that point, these funds had left the sovereign
territory of Russia. They were no longer devoted to economic activities within the energy
sector in Russia. They could have been applied to the economic activities of the Yukos

group outside Russia.?!

At the second stage of the transfers from Brittany or Hedgerow to the Claimant and from
the Claimant to Yukos Oil, the sums were transferred by way of loan. The Claimant
admits that this was a deliberate decision in order to make the working capital available
to Yukos Oil without having to pay tax on it, as would have been the case were the sums

to have been paid as a dividend.

482. Such a choice would, in the Tribunal’s view, only fall outside the concept of “Investment”
when either: (a) the Loans were found to be invalid or a sham as a matter of their legal
materialization (which is not alleged here); or (b) if the Loans were to be treated as in

substance a dividend because there was no intent to repay.
483. The evidence before the Tribunal is that the transactions were treated as loans:

(a) They appear as a contingent liability in the 2004 audited accounts of Yukos
Oil .82

(b) Yukos Oil made scheduled repayments under the Loans until its accounts in
Russia were frozen, and the Claimant made subsequent demands for

payment,®

(c) The Moscow City Arbitration Court did not call into question that the Loans
should be treated as such when ruling on their admissibility in the Yukos Oil
bankruptcy proceedings. Rather, it decided that the claim was premature, the
due date for fulfillment of the obligations under the Loans not having arisen as

at the date of the receivership.°**

484. This evidence is all consistent with an intent on the part of Yukos Oil to repay the
Claimant and thus with a subsisting asset in the form of a loan held by Yukos Capital.

485. This is not negated by the fact that these sums were liable to consolidation in the
Consolidated Group Accounts of the Yukos Group, This follows from the nature of
consolidated accounts as presenting the global economic position of a group of

companies, not the economic position of any particular company within the group.

486. Nor is the position affected by the fact that part of the loan to Yukos Oil was used by it
in turn to pay a dividend to its shareholders. The evidence advanced by the Claimant on

this aspect is that this dividend was paid in order to support the proposed merger between

Yukos Oil and Sibneft.*> Mr Misamore gave detailed evidence about this in his witness

statements.®°° His account was not challenged on cross-examination.

The Tribunal finds that, to the extent that part of the loan proceeds were at the time
intended to be used for this purpose, that would also be “associated with an Economic

Activity in the Energy Sector.”

Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the Loans are a “debt of a company” that constitutes
an “Investment” for the purpose of Article 1(6) of the ECT. This finding, however, does

not conclude its enquiry.

(e) Risk
The second aspect of the Respondent’s argument as to the economic substance of the
transaction is that the Claimant did not make an investment, since it bore no risk under
the Loans. Such risk, it is said, was passed on to Brittany or Hedgerow by virtue of the
back-to-back nature of the loan documentation. As a result, the asset is not to be treated

in economic terms as “owned” by the Claimant.

It is a commonplace to observe that an element of risk is inherent in the economic
materialization of an investment. This is another ground upon which an investment is

distinguished from a sales transaction.

The Tribunal is bound to observe, however, that, in its view, there are two difficulties that

arise on the Respondent’s legal case under this head.

In the first place, the factor of risk, however useful it may be as an indicator to distinguish
a sale from an investment, can have only limited value where the investor makes its
investment by way of a loan. In the case of a sale transaction, there is no investment
because the seller retains, by virtue of a contract of sale, no proprietary interest in an
economic venture in the host state. By contrast, as the Tribunal has already found,®°7 an

investment is commonly made by way of a debt, provided that such a debt is associated

with an enterprise or economic activity in the host state. This form of legal

materialization of an investment is expressly contemplated by Article 1(6)(b) of the ECT.

Where the mechanism of a loan is used, the investor retains the right to repayment of
capital; has the ability to fix its returns through a specified interest rate; and may also
have other legal mechanisms open to it to limit its risk. This form of investment is
therefore of its nature quite different from an equity investment, in which the value of the
investment will be much more directly influenced by the success or failure of the
economic venture. In the case of an equity investment, the risk element constitutes a
much more direct connection between the investor’s asset and the venture in which it

owns a stake.

These differences do not make a loan any the less an investment. A loan to an enterprise
or economic venture in the host state still involves risk as to the success or failure of the
venture. At the point that the investor disburses funds under the loan to the venture, it is
committed to its success or failure. The investor has a stake in that venture. Its risk
materializes in a failure to repay. That is a risk of a different order to non-payment for
specific goods delivered under a contract of sale. The element of risk is, therefore, in
reality another way of expressing the same underlying concept of “contribution” already

discussed.

There is a second difficulty in the instant case with the specific way in which the
Respondent advances its case. The Respondent does not for this purpose challenge the
legal materialization of the investment. It does not seek to argue that the Loans are invalid
or to be set aside under their applicable law. Yet the requirement of Article 1(6) of the
ECT to which its submissions on the back-to-back nature of the loan transactions must be

directed is the requirement that the Investment be “owned” by the Investor.

Ownership is a legal estate. It describes a legal relationship between person and property.
As the Tribunal has already held,®** international law does not create rights in property.

It must refer to national law to do so. Although the Respondent suggested that the

Page 168 of 195

Claimant was to be treated as an “agent” of Brittany or Hedgerow,* it developed no

legal case under the applicable law in this respect.

497.

_

Nor did the Respondent submit that there was any other basis for treating Brittany or
Hedgerow as the owner — legal or beneficial — of the chose in action constituted by the
debt. On the contrary, the Respondent emphasises that its case “does not mean that you’re
piercing the corporate veil, does not mean that you’re obliterating what legal obligations
or rights those parties might have in other spheres.”*“ It adds that the finding that it seeks
“has no consequence for the parties to the transaction as to their legal obligations.”84!
Nor, it bears repeating, did the Respondent submit that the Claimant was not an Investor.
It did not argue that the Claimant was a sham or a shell company established to disguise
the real owner (as was found to be the case in KT Asia). It did not submit that Brittany or

Hedgerow was to be treated as the owner of the debt.*4

498. The Respondent’s case is not founded upon the legal character of the arrangements, but
on a submission as to what it submitted was the “true economic position”: that Brittany
or Hedgerow were “the economic actors” and that Yukos Capital was “just a passive
conduit.”**3 Since the Respondent does not advance a submission impugning the legal
character of the arrangements, and since the Tribunal has not been presented with
evidence on the arbitration file for this jurisdiction hearing that might support such a
submission, it must approach the determination of its jurisdiction on the basis that the
legal arrangements between the Claimant and Brittany/Hedgerow are valid and carry the

legal incidents and consequences that appear on their face.

2 When a member of the Tribunal put this possible analysis to counsel for Respondent, he submitted: “One might

paras. 262-4 (referred to in the Dissenting Opinion of Arbitrator Stern at paras. 124 & 141) to be applicable to the
present case, because, in the view of the majority, neither Brittany nor Hedgerow owned any beneficial interest in
the Loans.

Page 169 of 195

Seen in this light, there is no doubt that the loans from Brittany/Hedgerow provided the

capital to the Claimant that it, in turn, used to extend the Loans to Yukos Oil. The

Brittany/Hedgerow loan agreements did so on terms that closely matched the Loans

between the Claimant and Yukos Oil. As described above,*“* the Claimant’s agreements

with Brittany and Hedgerow provided that they had no recourse against the Claimant in

the event that the Claimant was unable to make payment because it had not been paid by
Yukos Oil.

Does that have the consequence that the Claimant was not itself a lender with an
Investment that is capable of founding the Tribunal’s jurisdiction? A majority of the

Tribunal does not consider that this is so.

In order to explain why it has reached this conclusion, it is now necessary for the Tribunal
to analyse the nature of the relationships between Yukos Capital and, respectively, its
borrower and lender. For this purpose, it suffices to take the Yukos Oil and Brittany pair

of loan transactions.

The Agreement between Yukos Capital and Yukos Oil dated 2 December 2003 (the
“Yukos Capital Loan Agreement”) establishes a loan between Yukos Capital (defined

as “Lender”) and Yukos Oil (defined as “Borrower”). It provides in relevant part:5%6

1. SUBJECT

1.1 During the term hereof the Lender undertakes to grant to the Borrower interest
bearing loans with total amount (hereinafter referred to as “Loan Amount”) not
exceeding 80'000'000'000-00 (Eighty billion) Russian Rubles, and the Borrower
undertakes to repay such loans and to pay interest for use of funds hereunder at the
rate of 9% per annum.

1.2. Each loan designated to be granted by the Lender to the Borrower hereunder
shall be lent as a separate drawdown.

1.3. Each loan designated to be granted by the Lender to the Borrower within Loan
Amount Stipulated in paragraph 1.1. hereof, shall be requested by a separate Notice

of Drawdown, stating terms of such drawdown.

2. RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES

2.1. The Lender undertakes to grant loans to the Borrower within 2 (two) business
days from the date when the Borrower submitted to the Lender a Notice of
Drawdown, stating drawdown amount, which neither separately nor in aggregate
with other loans granted earlier hereunder may exceed Loan Amount as defined in
paragraph 1.1. hereof, and other terms of such drawdown.

A loan shall be deemed to have been granted by the Lender at the time when the
funds have been credited to the Borrower's bank account.

2.2. The Borrower is entitled to return loans obtained hereunder prior to their

 

maturity (before of terms, in respective Notice of D

submitted by the Borrower to the Lender)
2.3. The Borrower undertakes to submit to the Lender a copy of its quarterly balance
sheet with stamp of tax office evidencing its acceptance by the latter not later than
the 10th of second month following the end of each quarter.

2.4, The Borrower undertakes to repay all loans, borrowed hereunder, to the Lender
not later than 31st December 2008. Such term of maturity of the loans may be
adjusted by mutual agreement of the Parties made in writing. The interest on the
loans granted hereunder shall accrue quarterly and shall be payable not later than last
business day of the last month in the quarter. The loan shall be deemed to be repaid
in full at the time when respective funds have been credited to the Lender's bank
account. At the request of the Lender the Borrower shall return the loan before
maturity as stated above in the events as follows:

2.4.1. the Lender shall sufficient grounds to reckon that financial position of the
Borrower does not allow timely repayment of the loan.

2.4.2 in other events, defined by the laws of the Russian Federation from time to

time in force being.

3. RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PARTIES

3.1. In the event of nonfulfillment and/or not due fulfillment of obligations,
hereunder the parties shall be liable in accordance with civil legislation of the
Russian Federation from time to time in force being.

3.2. In the event of delay in the repayment of the loan by the Borrower the Lender is
entitled to require that penalty be payable by the Borrower in the amount of 0, | (zero
point one) per cent of the amount overdue. The payment of the penalty shall not

relieve the Borrower from fulfillment of the obligation in kind (i.e. of the repayment

of the Ioan and/or of payment of interest for using the loan).

4, FORCE MAJEURE

4.1. The Parties shall not bear responsibility for non-fulfillment or not due fulfillment
of their obligations should such hereunder breach be caused events beyond their
control (force majeure), i.e. extraordinary and unforeseen circumstances, which
being beyond control of the Party in breach prevented such Party from due
fulfillment of its obligations.

503. The Agreement between Yukos Capital and Brittany dated 20 November 2003 (the
“Brittany Loan Agreement”)*” establishes a loan between Brittany (defined as

“Lender”) and Yukos Capital (defined as “Borrower”). It provides in relevant part:

WHEREAS:

(a) Borrower intends to provide a loan facility te OAO "NK "YUKOS", a company
duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the Russian Federation
(hereinafter referred to as "Sub-Borrower"), such loan facility to be granted shall not
exceed 80'000'000'000-00 (Eighty billion) Russian Rubles, shall bear interest at the
rate of 9% per annum and shall mature not later than 31st December 2008
(hereinafter referred to as “Sub-Lending”, and respective loan agreement
documenting such Sub-Lending to be hereinafter referred to as Sub-Lending
Agreement);

(b) Lender has agreed to make available this Loan Facility on the terms set forth

herein.

NOW, THEREFORE, the Parties have agreed as follows:

non Russian residents;

(iii) the adoption, enactment or implementation of any rule, regulation or statute by

on the transfer of securities and any other holding of Sub-Lending, or cash proceeds
arising from the maintenance, redemption, purchase sale or holding of Sub-Lending;
(c) Foreign exchange risk, which means the risk that Lender may either not be able
to convert proceeds in Russian Rubles into hard currency upon repayment hereunder

advanced by Lender as Advances under this Agreement;

(d) Tax risk, which means that interest receivable by Borrower on Sub-Lending may

be reduced by any Russian withholding taxes and other statutory deductions.

to Yukos Capital.*** As between Brittany and Yukos Capital, it is Brittany that bears the
tisk of default associated with Yukos Capital’s loan to Yukos Oil, in terms of Yukos Oil’s
failure to pay and of Russian sovereign, foreign exchange and tax risks.*“? Brittany has
no right of recourse against Yukos Capital if and to the extent that Yukos Oil does not
repay its loan to Yukos Capital.

Does this affect the substance of the transaction between Yukos Capital and Yukos Oil?
A majority of the Tribunal’s view is that it does not. The only person that holds the right
to claim repayment of the debt represented by Yukos Capital’s loan to Yukos Oil is Yukos
Capital. It is Yukos Capital that advances the loans to Yukos Oil under the Yukos Capital
Loan Agreement. Yukos Oil’s undertaking to repay those loans with interest is made to
Yukos Capital alone.®° Yukos Capital does, therefore, have an economic interest in the
Loans, since it is Yukos Capital that holds the debt.

Those synallagmatic obligations between Yukos Oil and Yukos Capital are not held by
the latter on behalf of Brittany or any other third party. This conclusion is confirmed by
reference to both the Yukos Capital Loan Agreement and the Brittany Loan Agreement.
Brittany has no right to claim recovery of Yukos Oil’s debt. Yukos Capital has not
transferred that right — legally or beneficially — to Brittany. Brittany does not receive
under the Brittany Loan Agreement any right to Yukos Oil’s debt to Yukos Capital or any
ability to pursue a claim against Yukos Oil in respect of that debt. It merely limits its
own rights of recovery vis-a-vis Yukos Capital by assuming the risk if and to the extent

that Yukos Capital is not repaid.

Nor has Brittany indemnified Yukos Capital under the Brittany Loan Agreement against
any loss that Yukos Capital may suffer as a result of default by Yukos Oil under the Yukos
Capital Agreement. The right to seek repayment — and to invoke Yukos Oil’s liability for
nonfulfilment of its obligations®*' — remains solely held by Yukos Capital on its own
behalf.

The fact that Yukos Capital’s own liability to its lender, Brittany, is limited by the terms

of the Brittany Loan Agreement, may potentially give rise to questions as to the extent of

its loss. In the present proceedings, that would be a question to be determined in the event

that the Tribunal were to find liability. It does not shift the right to reclaim the debt owed
by Yukos Oil from Yukos Capital to Brittany.

In addition, the Claimant holds the right to its own return on the Loans, the loss of which
it risked in the event of the failure of Yukos Oil, being the spread or difference between
the interest that it earned and that was earned by Brittany/Hedgerow.** This spread was
not covered by the back-to-back arrangements. It was specifically notified to the
Luxembourg tax authorities and treated by them as sufficient to justify the
characterisation of the transaction as a valid loan made by a Luxembourg company for
the purpose of the double tax treaty with Russia.*? The Tribunal’s analysis of the nature
and incidents of the Loans has an important consequence in the context of the larger issue
with which the Tribunal is presently concerned, namely the question whether Yukos
Capital made an investment associated with an economic activity in the Respondent’s

Area sufficient to meet the jurisdictional threshold required by the ECT.

The Tribunal has already held that the origin of capital used to make an investment is not
germane to the enquiry whether the Investor has in fact made such an Investment. This
is so including where another company within a corporate group supplies the capital and
including where (as will often be the case) the Investor raises the capital by borrowing
the funds. It follows that the terms upon which the capital is raised are not relevant to the
question at hand, unless exceptionally they lead to an argument of the kind successfully
taised in KT Asia that would support a finding that the investment company is a sham or

shell used to hide the identity of the true beneficial owner.

The effect of the Loans was to take funds that were outside Russia and to invest those
funds in the Area of the Respondent in an enterprise, Yukos Oil, which was engaged in
an Economic Activity in the Energy Sector. The result of this investment was that the

lender assumed the operational risk that the funds might not be repaid. The funds were

at the risk of any factor that might affect Yukos Oil’s economic activity in Russia. The
Loans were placed at risk of the failure of that business to deliver sufficient returns to
enable repayment. Such risk includes the risks of sovereign intervention, the protection
against which is the function of Part III of the ECT. This fundamental risk remains
irrespective of the internal inter-group arrangements between the Claimant and its

lenders.

512. In reaching these conclusions for the purpose of determining its jurisdiction, the Tribunal

emphasises that it leaves open for the merits phase of the proceedings the questions that
arise from the nature of these arrangements as to what loss the Claimant may have

suffered in the event that the Tribunal were to find in its favour on liability.

For these reasons, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant “own[s]” an “asset” constituted by

2 4,

a “debt of a company” “associated with an Economic Activity in the Energy Sector” in
the “Area” of the Respondent such that it has made an “Investment” to which the present

dispute with the Respondent “relat[es].”

C. DOES THE “DENIAL-OF-BENEFITS” PROVISION (ARTICLE 17) OF THE ECT BAR THE
CLAIMS?

. The third objection to jurisdiction for consideration in this phase of the arbitration

concerns Article 17 of the ECT. That Article comes within Part III of the ECT and

provides, in relevant part:

Each Contracting Party reserves the right to deny the advantages of this Part to:

(1) a legal entity if citizens or nationals of a third state own or control
such entity and if that entity has no substantial business activities in
the Area of the Contracting Party in which it is organized;

The Respondent says that it was entitled to deny the benefits of Part III of the ECT to the
Claimant at any time before the deadline for raising jurisdictional objections. It says that
the Claimant has at relevant times been controlled by nationals of a third state (namely
the United States) and has not had substantial business activities in Luxembourg. As a

consequence, the Respondent says that, the Claimant having been denied the benefits of

Part III, it has no claim that it may assert before the Tribunal, which must dismiss the

claims for lack of jurisdiction or declare them inadmissible.°™4

The Claimant maintains that the Respondent’s purported denial of benefits cannot
constitute a challenge to jurisdiction; its invocation of Article 17 of the ECT after the

commencement of the arbitration cannot have retrospective effect; and the two

cumulative requirements of Article 17(1) of the ECT have not been met.®%

1. The Parties’ submissions
The Tribunal now summarises the Parties’ arguments.

(a) Can Article 17(1) give rise to a jurisdictional challenge?

(i) The Respondent’s position

. According to the Respondent, denying the benefits under Article 17(1) of the ECT can

lead to a jurisdictional challenge.*** The Respondent argues that “[a] Contracting Party's
consent to arbitration under Article 26 ECT extends only to ‘[d]isputes . .. which concern
an alleged breach of an obligation of [a Contracting Party] under Part III’,” thus making
such an alleged breach “a necessary predicate of jurisdiction.”*5” An “investor that has
been denied the advantages of Part III is not owed any obligations under Part III,” and its
allegations of fact are thus not capable of amounting to a breach of an obligation under
Part III;*** in those circumstances there cannot be a dispute concerning an alleged breach

of an obligation under Part I1.°°
(ii) +The Claimant’s position

The Claimant maintains, referring to Article 31(1) of the VCLT, that the reservation of
the right to deny benefits pursuant to Article 17(1) of the ECT applies only to Part III, but

that the reservation does not apply to Part V, in which Article 26 sets forth the right to
arbitration.*® The Claimant submits that the awards cited by the Respondent are all
“frrelevant, as in each case the denial of benefits provisions expressly applied to the
contracting parties’ consent to arbitrate”®*! and thus the state had the right to deny the
benefit of consent to arbitration. This does not retrospectively deny the other benefits,

but removes the avenue for addressing the breach of those provisions.°

(b) Was the Respondent entitled to invoke Article 17(1) after the
commencement of the arbitration?

(i) The Respondent’s position

520. The Respondent argues that it has the right, by virtue of Article 17(1) of the ECT, to deny
to the Claimant the benefits of Part III of the ECT “at any time” within the period
prescribed by the applicable arbitration rules for raising objections to jurisdiction or
admissibility,** as long as the Respondent fulfills the provision’s requirements;** and,
accordingly, that it is entitled to invoke Article 17(1) in these proceedings. It invokes a
number of awards in support. Criticising the Plama v. Bulgaria decision, it submits that
restricting the provision to having prospective effect denies it of any meaningful
application.*6 It submits that the Claimant’s interpretation would render the clause
nugatory, and would require a respondent state to attempt to monitor in the territories of
each of the 48 ECT contracting states the ownership and control structures of potential

claimants.°%

S2le

The Respondent submits that “a shell company owned or controlled by third State citizens
or nationals could have had no legitimate expectation that it will not be denied the
advantages of Part III of the ECT unless it has been upfront about its ownership and

control and its lack of substantial business activities and obtained a specific representation

from the Contracting Party concerned that it will not be denied benefits,” something that
Yukos Capital did not do.°?

(ii) The Claimant’s position

522, The Claimant maintains that Article 17(1) of the ECT does not operate automatically but
is a right reserved to states that must be positively exercised; that it has no effect until
then and is not retrospective.®®* By the time the Respondent exercised this right on 11

ae 2014, the benefit of the protections had been enjoyed and the breach of those

 

869 The Respondent’s interpretation would be to “ ively

P P

introduce conditions to its unconditional consent to arbitrate.”®”° This would have the
effect of negating all the other benefits of the Treaty that the Claimant had enjoyed and
depriving it of the ability to enforce those rights.*” While “a contracting party’s
obligations under Part III are a corollary of an investor’s advantages,” the Claimant
alleges that “it does not follow that such obligations automatically evaporate once
advantages are unilaterally denied, nor that the host states are the judges of this
determination.”*” It cites jurisprudence in support*”? and distinguishes the authorities
cited by the Respondent.*”

523. Any investor has a legitimate expectation that it is entitled to the benefits of the ECT until
they are denied. The object and purpose of the ECT in promoting “long-term co-operation
in the energy field” supports the proposition that Article 17 has prospective effect.5 A

requirement that an investor seek a representation from the state that it would not be

ECT."87%6

(c) Is the Claimant owned or controlled by nationals of a third state?

(i) The Respondent’s position

524. The Respondent submits that “control” in Article 17(1) of the ECT “includes control in
fact, including a financial or equity interest in a company, the ability to exercise
substantial influence over its management and operation, and the selection of members
of its board of directors or other managing body.”*”” The Respondent disputes that
questions of “control” are always based on the ownership of a shareholding interest in the
relevant person, which conflates ownership and contro] and deprives the latter concept of
meaning.*® The Respondent argues that control over a legal entity may be asserted
through an ability to exercise substantial influence over the entity’s management and
operation or the selection of the members of its managing body,*” and that in the ECT
context control means control in fact.8*° The Respondent distinguishes the cases cited by
the Claimant, which concern companies controlled by direct or indirect shareholders,
from the current arbitration, which concerns a Stichting that “has no owners and is

managed and controlled solely by its Board.”8*!

525. The Respondent says that the Stichting controls Yukos Capital through its 100%
shareholding in Yukos International, which, in turn, owns 100% of Yukos Capital.*®? The
Respondent submits that the purpose of a Stichting Administratiekantoor is to transfer
control over a limited liability company from the company’s shareholders to the members

of the Stichting’s board, who exercise the combined powers of the company’s

The Respondent further rejects the Claimant’s argument that the nationality of Board
members is irrelevant because they act collectively as the Board; because the Board is
subject to the supervision of the Dutch courts; and because the Board members have a
duty to consider the interests of the Claimant and the other entities and shareholders of
the Yukos Group. It says that the nationality of the majority of Board members is what

Board.* Individual directors do not control the Stichting. Rather the Board is a Dutch
body subject to the ultimate supervision of the Dutch courts that makes decisions over the

528. The Claimant says that the question of control is based on ownership of a shareholding
interest.5™ In this case, the Board collectively pursues its line of business in the interests
of all its stakeholders and to the extent that the Stichting exercises control over Yukos
Capital, such control is exercised by the legal person of the Stichting.8%° Without the
necessary participating ownership interest, no person could draw on the benefits of Part
IH or would have standing to make a claim.5° Article 17(1) is concerned with cases
“where the ‘real’ investor is from a third state which benefits from the Investment but
would not afford the same protection to the Investors of the host state.” The United States
does not benefit ftom an investment protected under the ECT just because some American

nationals are directors of the Stichting, and the directors are not the “real” investors.”

529. The fact that the Board has corporate powers similar to those held by shareholders under
Dutch law does not transform the directors of such Board into pseudo-shareholders within
the meaning of Article 17.5 Professor Tjittes’ expert report does not support the
conclusion that individual Board members can control the Stichting such that the
nationality of the majority of the Board members would determine whether the Stichting
is controlled by a third state. Board members have a fiduciary duty to act in the best
interests of the Stichting, which is different from the liberty that shareholders hold to

pursue their own interests as long as such pursuit does not harm other shareholders.®%

The Board is an organ within the Stichting and not a separate legal entity, and has no
economic interest in the Stichting or standing to make claims.°°' So the “board doesn’t
own or control the stichting or Yukos Capital, and individual board members do not have

rights of ownership or control.”

The Claimant rejects the submission that, since the Stichting does not have any
shareholders, it must be the nationality of the majority of the members of the Stichting
Board that determines control. The lack of shareholders does not “suddenly invest the
board ... or individual investors with rights of shareholders just because there are no

existence” and, therefore, did not have “substantial business activities” in terms of Article
17(1) of the ECT. The mere fact of registration does not connote a real presence. A
registration certificate from the Russian Ministry for Tax referred to by the Claimant does
not show the level of business activity conducted in Luxembourg, only that Yukos Capital

was incorporated there.°%

with a traditional holding company that “actively holds shares in subsidiaries which

employ personnel and produce goods or services to third parties.”»”°

(ii) The Claimant’s position

537. The Claimant says that it was not the kind of “mailbox investor” which Article 17 was
aimed at controlling. Rather it was established as a lucrative Luxembourg-based group
finance pany.22! TMF ducted sut ial everyday busi activities in
Luxembourg on its behalf." The Claimant’s business activities and ownership structure
had to change as a direct result of the Respondent’s breaches and the Respondent cannot

deny the Claimant the benefit of protections in reliance on them.”

538. The Claimant says the ordinary meaning of “business activities” “encompasses a wide

range of commercial and administrative actions taken by or on behalf of an enterprise.”?”*

The “substantial” threshold must be assessed in the context of the Claimant’s business,

and means “of substance, not merely of form”; materiality not magnitude is the test."

539. The Claimant notes that the Luxembourg law on incorporation requires that a company
has a “real” presence in Luxembourg.”° The Claimant rejects the Noguera Report’s
conclusion that Yukos Capital could not satisfy the minimum criteria for business activity
in Luxembourg.” There is no basis for casting any doubt on the representations made

respect to the certificate of residency, the Claimant says the Luxembourg authorities
approved its business activities in Luxembourg on the basis of full and honest disclosure
by the Claimant, and the existence or lack of inquiry is a matter for the Luxembourg

authorities to decide.°°

The Claimant submits that it was established as an active company incorporated to
provide financing to companies within the same group, with “a designated functioning
office in Luxembourg,” a Luxembourg address and contact details; that its sole director

corporate director is evidence of substantial business activities in Luxembourg and

contribution to the Luxembourg economy by paying fees.°°°

2004, and notes that until February 2007, TMF was Yukos Capital’s sole director and

expropriatory actions.”** Likewise, its lack of taxable outputs directly resulted from the

Respondent's expropriation.°”
2. The Tribunal’s analysis

(a) The issue

In PO No 1, the Tribunal ruled that the following objection to jurisdiction and
admissibility (as formulated in the Respondent's letter dated 11 April 2014) should be

determined in a preliminary phase (together with the two issues already dealt with above):

Since Claimant is a shell company with no substantial business activities in
Luxembourg and is ultimately controlled by nationals of a third State, Respondent is
entitled to deny Claimant the advantages of Part [II of the ECT pursuant to Article
17 ECT.¥°

The Tribunal considers that the specific issue that it is necessary for it to decide under
this head is:

Did “citizens or nationals of a third state ... control” the Claimant on
11 April 2014 when the Respondent sought to deny it the benefits of Part III
ECT pursuant to Article 17(1)?

This corresponds to issue (c) of the pleaded issues summarised above.

In framing the issue in this way, the Tribunal acknowledges that the Parties also presented
arguments on several other aspects of the construction and application of Article 17(1) of

the ECT in the present case.

The second condition for the invocation of a denial of advantages under Article 17(1) of
the ECT — that the entity “has no substantial business activities” in Luxembourg (pleaded
issue (d) above) — is additional to the requirement of ownership or control by nationals of
athird state. Both requirements must be met in order for a contracting state to be entitled

validly to deny a legal entity the advantages of Part III of the ECT. If either one or the

Page 188 of 195

other element is not present, Article 17(1) may not be invoked. The Tribunal proposes
first to examine the issue of control by nationals of a third state, since, if this were not
established on the evidence, it would be unnecessary to consider whether the second

element of no substantial business activities were made out.

The question whether Article 17(1) has retrospective or merely prospective effect
(pleaded issue (b) above) would only arise for decision in the event that the Tribunal were
to find that both of the two factual predicates for a valid invocation of Article 17(1) were
established on the evidence. If the Tribunal were satisfied that the two conditions were
met, it would have to proceed to decide whether, on its proper construction, a denial of
the advantages of Part III of the ECT under Article 17(1) is capable of applying to alleged
breaches of Part III that had occurred prior to the notice of denial. Conversely, this
question will be academic in the present case, if the factual predicates to Article 17(1) are

not made out in any event.

The Parties also differ on the question whether the issue raised by the Respondent under
Article 17(1) is properly a matter that is to be resolved as a question of jurisdiction or
admissibility and is thus capable of determination at this stage in the proceedings (pleaded
issue (a) above). The Respondent invites the Tribunal to determine the issue at this stage,
arguing that the jurisdiction of the Tribunal under Article 26 of the ECT extends only to
a dispute concerning “an alleged breach of an obligation ... under Part III.” If the
advantages of Part III have been effectively denied to the Claimant, there can be no
dispute that arises for the Tribunal’s determination and thus no jurisdiction. By contrast,
the Claimant submits that, Article 17 being expressly confined to Part III, it is by its terms
concerned only with the substantive protections of the Treaty. This is a merits issue, it
argues, and does not relate to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, which is conferred by
Article 26 under Part V “Dispute Settlement”.

On this question, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent. The provisions of Article 17
determine the jurisdictional scope ratione personae of the ECT. That is to say, where
Article 17 is validly invoked, it excludes from the scope of the Treaty a person that would

otherwise be entitled to invoke the Treaty as an “Investor.”

The essential interrelation between Article 17 and the operative provisions of the Treaty

may be seen from an analysis of the Treaty text. Article 26 provides for the settlement of

 

Case 1:22-cv-00798 Document 1-2 Filed 03/23/22 Page 557 of 598

PCA Case No. 2013-31
Interim Award on Jurisdiction
Page 189 of 195

disputes according to arbitration between a contracting party and an “Investor of another
Contracting Party ... which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the former

under Part III.”
550. “Investor” is defined in Article 1(7) as meaning:
(a) with respect to a Contracting Party:

(i a natural person having the citizenship or nationality of or who is
permanently residing in that Contracting Party in accordance with its

applicable law;

(ii) a company of other organization organized in accordance with the law

applicable in that Contracting Party;

(b) with respect to a “third state”, natural person, company or other organization
which fulfils, mutatis mutandis, the conditions specified in subparagraph (a) for a

Contracting Party.
551. Where a Contracting Party denies advantages under Article 17(1), the effect is that:

(a) A legal entity that would otherwise meet the criteria to be an Investor under
Article 1(7) and be entitled as such to pursue a claim for breach of the Treaty

may not do so; and,

(b) The contracting state no longer owes that entity any obligation under Part ITI

that may form the subject of a dispute.

552. The result is that the question whether the advantages of Part III have been denied to a
particular person determines the scope ratione personae of the claims that the Tribunal
may entertain, not the merits of any such claim. For this reason, the Tribunal remains of
the view that it took in PO No 1 that the Respondent’s objection under Article 17 is
properly regarded as a jurisdictional objection and is ripe for determination in this present

preliminary phase.

553. The Tribunal will now turn to consider the evidence on the issue identified above at

paragraph 543 and to rule on it.

(b) Control by nationals of a third state

554. The Respondent alleges that the Claimant was, at the time of the denial of benefits, as a
result of a corporate re-organisation, controlled in fact by nationals of a third state, namely
the United States of America.

555. The basic facts relevant to this case are not in dispute:

{a) From its incorporation in January 2003 until April 2005, Yukos Capital was
owned by Yukos Oil through Yukos Finance, a Dutch subsidiary of Yukos

oil.”

(b) In 2005, the ownership of Yukos Capital was reorganised. A Dutch stichting
was created on 14 April 2005. The Stichting became the sole shareholder of
Yukos Capital through Yukos International, another Dutch company in the

Yukos Group.

(c) As at 29 May 2014, four of the five members of the Board of the Stichting were
nationals of the United States of America (Messrs Theede, Godfrey, Misamore

and Fleischman) and the Board has always consisted of a majority of United

States citizens.°*

556. The issue is whether these undisputed facts suffice to establish control in fact by nationals
of a third state.

557. The Claimant is owned by an entity that is a national of a contracting party, namely, the
Stichting, which is an “ ization organized in d with the law applicable” in
The Netherlands.

Pursuant to Article 2:285 of the Dutch Civil Code, the Stichting has no owners and is

managed and controlled solely by its Board, which represents the Stichting."

The Respondent’s challenge therefore turns on whether it suffices in order to establish
control by nationals of a third state that a majority of the members of the owner’s Board

are nationals of a third state.

This question requires consideration of the manner in which a stichting is itself controlled

as a matter of Dutch law,

On this question, the Tribunal had the benefit of expert evidence of two distinguished
Dutch jurists: Professor Justice J. H. M. Willems for the Claimant and Professor Dr. R.
P. J. L. Tjittes for the Respondent. Each expert filed reports.”

The Parties agreed to dispense with cross-examination, but tendered the experts in the
event that the Tribunal had any questions for them.™® With the agreement of the Parties,
the Tribunal took the opportunity to address its own questions to them together on one

point.°#
The relevant passage in the transcript of the hearing is as follows: 9°

THE CHAIRMAN: We have been much assisted by our reading of both of your
respective reports in our understanding of the legal structure and incidence of the
Dutch institution of the stichting, and this particular type of stichting that was created

for the purpose of holding the assets ultimately in the Claimant company.

The general understanding which we derive from your respective reports, which I
wish to test in order to ensure that our understanding is correct, is that the organ of
the stichting which exercises the deliberative powers of the stichting, makes its

decisions, is the board. Is that correct Professor Tjittes?

*6 Dutch Civil Code, Art. 2:285 (Exhibit R-66): — |. ‘A Foundation (“‘stichting”) is a legal person formed by
means of a juridical act, that has no members”; — 3. “The objective (purpose) of a Foundation (‘‘stichting”) may
not include the making of distributions to its founders (incorporators) or to those who are participating in its
bodies”; Memorial, para. 182; Stichting Articles of Association (19 March 2008) (Exhibit R-74).

A. (Professor Tjittes) That's correct, Mr Chairman.
THE CHAIRMAN: And Professor Willems?
A. (Professor Willems) That is correct, Mr Chairman.

THE CHAIRMAN: And that in exercising its powers, the board is obliged to act as
a collectivity; is that right, Professor Tjittes?

A. (Professor Tjittes) That is correct, Mr Chairman.
A. (Professor Willems) That is correct, Mr Chairman.

THE CHAIRMAN: In that sense, therefore, the board operates as an organ which is
distinct from the individual natural persons that comprise its individual members; is

that right, Professor Tjittes?

A. (Professor Tjittes) That is correct, Mr Chairman; although individual members
may have some obligations individually towards the stichting itself, or towards third

parties, like creditors of the stichting. But as such, your presumption is correct.
THE CHAIRMAN: Professor Willems?

A. (Professor Willems) That is correct, what you have put, Mr Chairman. I wouldn't

 

use the my has used In my
opinion, it is possible to divide more or less the working load between the different
members of the board, but that does not make that specific member having a separate
duty or position or whatever. It's a sort of practical way of organising your system;

I would frame it like that.

THE CHAIRMAN: Yes, of course. One moment. (Pause) We understand that the
board itself nominates and appoints board members. Is that right, Professor Tjittes?

A. (Professor Tjittes) That is correct, Mr Chairman.
THE CHAIRMAN: Professor Willems?

A. (Professor Willems) That is correct, Mr Chairman.

564. This agreed evidence from both experts confirms that, as a matter of Dutch law, it is the
board as an organ that controls the stichting and not the individual natural persons that

comprise its members.

565. In the present case, this has the necessary consequence that the “control” of Yukos Capital
for the purposes of Article 17(1) of the ECT is exercised by an organisation organised
under the laws of a Contracting State, namely the Stichting acting by its Board. It is not
controlled by nationals of a third state, since it is the Board as a collective organ and not

its individual members that exercise control over the Stichting’s affairs.

566. Having reached the conclusion that the first of the two factual predicates for the valid
invocation of a denial of advantages is not made out, it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to
determine whether the additional requirement — that the Claimant “has no substantial

business activities” in Luxembourg — was also present.

VIII. DECISION

567. For all of the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal hereby DECIDES that:

(1) The Respondent’s provisional application of the Energy Charter Treaty under
the terms of Article 45(1) does include its consent to international arbitration
under Article 26(3)(a) (by majority).

(2) The Claimant does own an asset constituted by a debt of a company associated
with an Economic Activity in the Energy Sector in the Area of the Respondent
such that it has made an Investment to which the present dispute with the

Respondent relates (by majority).

(3) Citizens or nationals of a third state did not control the Claimant on 11 April
2014 when the Respondent sought to deny the Claimant the advantages of Part
TI of the Energy Charter Treaty, such that the Respondent was not entitled to
invoke the provisions of Article 17(1).

(4) The three objections to jurisdiction and admissibility raised by Respondent in
its Notice dated 11 April 2014 that the Tribunal set down for determination in

a preliminary phase by Procedural Order No 1 dated 24 April 2014 are

therefore dismissed (by majority in respect of objections (1) and (2)).

(5) Any other objections to jurisdiction and admissibility are, pursuant to
Procedural Order No 1, joined to the merits.

(6) The stay of proceedings on the merits ordered in Procedural Order No 1 is
lifted with effect from 28 days following the communication of this Interim

Award on Jurisdiction to the Parties.

(7) The Tribunal shall thereafter fix by procedural order, after consultation with
the Parties, a revised timetable for further pleadings and a hearing on the

merits.

(8) All costs of and occasioned by the hearing of these objections to jurisdiction

shall be reserved.

1. This is an important and complex case and although the three members of the Tribunal
had lengthy and challenging exchanges of views, they could not at the end of the day
arrive at a unanimous analysis both on the interpretation of Article 45 and its
consequences and on the question of the existence of an investment protected under the
ECT, and therefore on the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione voluntatis and ratione materiae.

DISSENT ON ARTICLE 45 OF THE ECT

2. The necessary starting-point for the analysis is that the Tribunal has been seized as an
international tribunal by a Notice of Arbitration made by the Claimant against the
Respondent under Article 26 of the ECT:

The agreement to arbitrate on which Yukos Capital relies is set forth in Article 26 of the
Energy Charter Treaty of 1994 (the ECT).!

It is common ground that the Russian Federation did sign the ECT at the time it was
adopted in 1994, and that it not only abstained from ratifying it, but that the Duma
positively refused to ratify it in 1997. It is also on record that the Russian Federation
terminated the provisional application of the ECT in 2009.

3. The question to be solved is, therefore, whether Article 26 is binding for the Russian
Federation, so that the jurisdiction of the Tribunal can be based on it. The Claimant
considers that it is binding as a result of the Russian Federation’s signing of the ECT and
the application of Article 45 (1) concerning provisional application of the Treaty by the
Signatories. The Respondent alleges that the provisional application of Article 26 is
excluded by application of the limitation clause in Article 45 (1) of the ECT providing
for provisional application only “to the extent that such provisional application is not
inconsistent with its constitution, laws or regulations.”

I. THE MEANING OF PROVISIONAL APPLICATION OF THE ECT

4. Before entering into the interpretation of Article 45 (1) of the ECT, it appears necessary
to ascertain the distinction between a treaty in force and a treaty provisionally applied in
general international law as well as in the Russian legal order.

"Notice of Arbitration, 15 February 2013, § 1. See also Interim Award on Jurisdiction (hereinafter “Award”),
§ 180: “It is common ground that the basis for jurisdiction of the present Tribunal that is invoked by the Claimant
depends in the first instance upon the proper construction of the regime for provisional application of the ECT set
forth in its Article 45. The Claimant brings its claim solely for alleged breach of rights contained in the ECT. It
claims a right to choose to settle its dispute with the Respondent pursuant to the dispute settlement provisions of
Article 26(2)(c) of the ECT, which includes submission to an arbitral tribunal under UNCITRAL Rules under
Article 26(4)(b). It relies in particular upon the unconditional consent of the Respondent as a contracting party to
international arbitration under Article 26(3)(a).”

Page 2 of 32

A. THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN A TREATY IN FORCE AND A TREATY PROVISIONALLY APPLIED
The distinction in international law

5. _ It is uncontested that a treaty provisionally applied is not a treaty in force. This is
consistent with the distinction made in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties
(VCLT) between the entry into force of a treaty and its provisional application, in Articles
24 and 25, respectively:

Article 24 Entry into force

1. A treaty enters into force in such manner and upon such date as it may provide or as the
negotiating States may agree.

2, Failing any such provision or agreement, a treaty enters into force as soon as consent to
be bound by the treaty has been established for all the negotiating States.

Article 25 Provisional application

1. A treaty or a part of a treaty is applied provisionally pending its entry into force if:
(a) the treaty itself so provides; or
(b) the negotiating States have in some other manner so agreed.
2. Unless the treaty otherwise provides or the negotiating States have otherwise agreed, the
provisional application of a treaty or a part of a treaty with respect to a State shall be
terminated if that State notifies the other States between which the treaty is being applied
provisionally of its intention not to become a party to the treaty. (Emphasis added)

6. — It should be noted here that the Claimant has somehow tried to blur this distinction in
relying on a concept of “provisional entry into force.” This is what can be read in its
Rejoinder:

Similarly, as noted in the ILC Commentary to Article 25 of the Vienna Convention, a
provisionally applicable treaty is binding and constitutes a legally enforceable instrument
among signatory states: “{...] there can be no doubt that such clauses have legal effect and
bring the treaty into force on a provisional basis.”

Thus,
“[...] from a drafting point of view, it seemed necessary to specify that it is the
treaties in force in accordance with the provisions of the present articles to which
the pacta sunt servanda rule applies. The words ‘in force’ of course cover treaties
in force provisionally under Article 22 as well as treaties which enter into force
definitively under Article 21."

7. However, Claimant’s reliance on a notion of “treaties in force provisionally” or “treaty
into force on a provisional basis” is based on a draft of the article on provisional
application dated 1966, which is entirely different from the one finally adopted. The
text commented by Claimant, on the basis of the ILC’s comment? of an article which was
not finally adopted, is the following:

Claimant’s Rejoinder, §§ 20-21. Footnotes omitted. Emphasis in the original.
3 Yearbook of International Law Commission, 1966, Vol II, pp. 210-211, Exhibit CL-46.

PCA Case No. 2013-31
Interim Award on Jurisdiction — Dissenting Opinion
Page 3 of 32

Article 22. Entry into force provisionally

1. A treaty may enter into force provisionally if:
(q) The treaty itself prescribes that it shall enter into force provisionally ending
ificati approval or ion by the ing States; or
(b) The negotiating States have in some other manner so agreed.
2. The same rule applies to the entry into force provisionally of part of a treaty.

Article 22 as just quoted referred indeed to the notion of provisional entry into force,
while the final adopted text clearly rejected that concept and introduced a dramatic change
in the vocabulary speaking of provisional application “pending entry into force.” This
means that the States have expressly rejected the idea of a “provisional entry into
force.”

In other words, it is beyond doubt that a provisionally applied treaty cannot be considered
as a treaty in force under international law.

The distinction in the Russian legal system

10.

It can also be mentioned here that this understanding that there is a difference between a
treaty provisionally applied and a treaty in force — as well as the idea that a provisional
application can be of the whole treaty or part thereof — has been adopted by the Federal
Law On International Treaties of the Russian Federation of 16 June 1995 (FLIT)*, which
reproduced the distinction found in the VCLT and whose Article 23 reads:

Article 23 Provisional application of international treaties by the Russian Federation

1, An international treaty or a part of a treaty may, prior to its entry into force, be
applied by the Russian Federation provisionally if the treaty itself so provides or if an
agreement to that effect has been reached with the parties that have signed the treaty.
(Emphasis added)

The distinction in the ECT

ll.

In fact, no one really contests the fundamental difference between a treaty in force and a
treaty provisionally applied. The ECT itself embodies that distinction, as indeed
mentioned in the Award:

The Final Provisions of the ECT set forth in Part VIII draw a clear distinction between two
types of unilateral acts by states which are to have legal consequences on the plane of
international law: (i) signature of the Treaty under Article 38 by those states which have
signed the Energy Charter; and (ii) ratification, acceptance or approval by those states under
Article 39. That Article does not itself specify the consequences that flow from the act of
signature.>

The consequences are indeed specified in Article 45.

12. Having this important distinction between a treaty in force and a treaty provisionally
applied in mind, it is for the Tribunal to make explicit the consequences that flow from
the interpretation of Article 45, which it will do in due course.

B. THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE 45 (1) OF THE ECT

13. The point of departure of the analysis must be the text of Article 45, of which the first
paragraph is reproduced here:

ARTICLE 45 PROVISIONAL APPLICATION

(1) Each signatory agrees to apply this Treaty provisionally pending its entry into force for

such _ Signatory in accordance with Article 44, to the extent that such provisions)
is not ii it with its itution, laws or r

added)®

14, The rules of interpretation of an international treaty are well known and embodied in
Article 31 of the VCLT. On this point, I fully subscribe to the following statement in the
Award:

The point of departure is Article 31(1), which requires interpretation “in good faith in
accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context
and in the light of its object and purpose.”

Interpretation in good faith

15. The fact that any interpretation has to be made in good faith does not raise discussion. I,
therefore, fully agree here on what is said in the Award under § 206(a) and have nothing
to add to these thoughtful considerations:

Each part of clause (1) must be interpreted in good faith. This means that the Tribunal must
seek to give an effective meaning to the agreement of “[e]ach signatory ... to apply this
Treaty provisionally pending its entry into force for such signatory” as well as to the proviso
to that agreement “to the extent that such provisional application is not inconsistent with
its constitution, laws or regulations.” An interpretation that would be so broad as to empty
either the positive agreement of the relevant signatory or the domestic inconsistency
proviso of any effect would not be consistent with an interpretation of the terms of Article
45 (1) in good faith.

Interpretation of the text

16. It seems to me that the use of the words “to the extent” indicates that the extent of the
provisional application of the ECT will depend on the absence of its inconsistency with
the totality of the internal legal order, i.e., the constitution, laws and regulations. In other
words, the rules of the Treaty will be provisionally applied to the extent they are not
inconsistent with any norm of the Russian legal system, or, to say it differently, if they

are consistent with that legal order® and will not be provisionally applied if they are
inconsistent — or, to say it differently, if they are not consistent — with any norm of the
Russian legal system.

Interpretation in the context of the adoption of the text

17. To interpret the meaning of Article 45 (1), an important reference is to the views of
representatives of the European Community? and the States during the finalization of the
negotiations in 1994 or thereafter, of an authorized legal commentator of the ECT, and,
last but not least, of the respective structures of the national legal orders and the
international legal system, which shed some light on the object and purpose of the Treaty,
and in particular its Article 26. Some guidelines can also be found for the interpretation
of the ECT article on provisional application in the interpretation given to a similar article
in the GATT, which, as is well known, was provisionally applied from 1948 to 1994, the
date of the adoption of the Marrakesh Agreement establishing the WTO.

Common view of the European Community and the Member States at the time of the adoption
of the ECT

18. The views expressed in a Joint Statement by the Council, the Commission and the
Member States indicate both that the test for provisional application is whether or not a
commitment in the Treaty is compatible with the existing legal order of the Signatories
and that the European Community could only apply provisionally parts of the Treaty:!°

Article 45 (1) of the European Energy Charter Treaty should be interpreted as defining the
conditions and limits for the provisional application of the ECT by the Signatories:

(a) it does not create any commitment beyond what is compatible with the existing
internal legal order of the Signatories;

8 I confess that I have some difficulty to follow the linguistic considerations on the interpretation of the expression
“not inconsistent” as implying what has been called a double negative form in §§ 207-211 of the Award, especially
in light of a further statement found in the Award, in § 233 (b), to the effect that “the negotiating states attached
importance to inclusion of the Domestic Law Inconsistency Clause so as to ensure that provisional application
‘does not create any commitment beyond what is compatible with the existing internal legal order of the
Signatories.”"(Emphasis added), which seems to equate “not inconsistent” with “compatible.” I would also like to
add that it seems that there is no double negation in the Russian text, which by definition has some relevance here.

° As it was then called.

© Strangely, the Hulley tribunal did not consider that these statements contradicted its view of an all-or-nothing
application of the ECT and the impossibility of a partial provisional application with the following self-
contradictory statement: “This is therefore not so much an example of partial provisional application of the ECT
due to inconsistency with the EC’s legal order, as it is an example of the EC’s partial jurisdiction for the provisional
application of the whole ECT — meaning, necessarily, that some parts of the ECT simply cannot be provisionally
applied by the EC.” (Emphasis added), Hulley Enterprises Limited (Cyprus) v. The Russian Federation,

(c) this interpretation allows the C ity to limit the provisi lication to
the matters which fall under its competence. (Emphasis added)!

19. A Council Decision in respect of the provisional application of the ECT by the European
Community confirmed that provisional application could concern only parts of the
Treaty:

Whereas the provisional application of the Energy Charter Treaty will help attain the
objectives of the European Community;

Whereas the European Community has competence for parts of the Energy Charter
Treaty;

The European Community shall apply on a provisional basis from the time of signature the
Energy Charter Treaty to the extent that it has competence for the matters governed by the
Treaty. (Emphasis added)"

20. The conclusion which flows from these statements is that it is possible to apply only parts
of the Treaty and not others — for example Article 26.

Some views of States during the negotiations of the ECT

21. Can be quoted here, for example, what the American delegation stated in a fax dated 24
February 1994, during the discussion of the wording of Article 45 (1):

As | noted during the last plenary, we do not have any legal difficulty with provisional
application per se, so long as it is carefully qualified to ensure that no party is obliged to
do, or to retrain from doing, anything for which that party’s constitution or law
requires an appropriately ratified treaty. Our law, for example, generally speaking
prohibits expenditure of funds to pay the U.S. share of the expenses of an international
organization absent the express approval of the Congress. For such reasons language along
the lines ‘to the extent permitted by its constitution or laws’ is essential to any provisional
application obligation. (Emphasis added)'*

22. The same position was reiterated in a fax dated 4 August 1994 from the American
Ambassador to the Dutch Ambassador during the finalization of the text of the ECT, on
4 August 1994:

--- most national and subnational laws provide for disputes under those laws to go to the
local courts, not through international arbitration unless there is special provision.
Accordingly I imagine that provisional application does not, by and large, bind the
signatory to Articles 30 and 31. But both these are really matters for lawyers. If am wrong,
however, the US position could be eased if there were specific provision in Article 50 under

which a signatory could declare that it is not able to accept provisional application with
respect to particular sub-federal bodies or to Articles 30 and 31. (Emphasis added)"*

Some general views of States on the limits of provisional application

28;

The German Foreign Office Guidelines on the Treatment of International Treaties also
indicate that some commitments can only be made by the Legislative body and not
through an administrative act;

On the German side, unrestricted provisional application of a treaty may, in principle, only
be agreed to if the treaty does not require either parliamentary consent in accordance with
Article 59(2) of the German Constitution (Grundgesetz) or any other domestic
implementation. Otherwise, provisional application would infringe the legislature’s
exclusive sphere of competence. [...] This question is closely connected with the question
of the need for a law granting parliamentary consent to a treaty (treaty law
(Vertragsgesetz)): to the extent that treaty provisions trigger the aforesaid requirement, they
can, in principle, not be applied provisionally, The provisional application of a treaty
may in such cases only be agreed to, if made dependent on a unilateral statement that
the domestic requirements for provisional application are fulfilled, or if it is agreed
upon that provisional application is only foreseen within the limits of domestic law.
(Emphasis added) '*

Views of an authorized legal commentator of the ECT

24. The following comments have quite some weight, as their author was the chair of the

25.

legal advisory committee to the Energy Charter Treaty negotiation. It is, therefore, quite
striking that both before the entry into force of the ECT for the States that had ratified the
Treaty in 1998 and ten years later he expressed some doubts on the applicability on a
provisional basis of Article 26.

The first expression of doubt can be found in an article published in 1996:

It is presently unclear, however, to what extent additional commitments to the Energy
Charter Treaty’s substantive rights and obligations flow from the Treaty’s “provisional”
application commitments.

And it should be borne in mind that even after the Treaty has entered into force for at least
30 states, there is no predicting how long it will take before it is in force for all of the
signatories, some of whom could continue to apply it “provisionally” for a period of
uncertain duration. Thus, it could become important to clarify the duties owed between a
Treaty signatory for which the Treaty is in force and one that is applying the Treaty
provisionally, the duties owed to their respective investors, and the extent to which these
Telationships are subject to the Treaty's dispute settlement mechanisms. (Emphasis
added)

and 31 were to become in the final text Article 26 and 27 relating to Settlement of Disputes respectively between

26. The same views were expressed again in 2006:

At the present time the ECT is in a phase of “provisional application.” The term of course
refers to a treaty signatory's commitment to comply with a treaty, in whole or in part,
before completion of the ratification process. Article 25 of the Vienna Convention allows
for provisional application, which can create obligations going beyond those that Article
18 of the Convention imposes to “refrain from acts which would defeat the object and
purpose” of a treaty. In states where the Legislative Branch of the Government has not been
asked to consent to provisional application, such a commitment often rests on the actual or
implied authority of the Executive Branch, the scope of which may not be clear, and which
may be especially problematical as concerns the acceptance of legally binding
resolution in an international forum of disputes over domestic matters. (Emphasis
added)!”

27. What these writings convey is at least the fact that it was far from self-evident that Article
26 could be applied provisionally.

Interpretation of the GATT’s clause on provisional application

28. Because of great similarities between the clauses relating to provisional application in the
ECT and in the GATT, it is worth referring to the manner in which the analysis of the
consistency of GATT’s provisionally applied rules with the internal legal orders has been
performed, as excellently presented in the Award:

Provisional application of the GATT. Article | of the Protocol of Provisional Application
of the GATT provides that the governments of the signatory states “undertake ... to apply
provisionally on and after 1 January 1948:

(a) Parts and III of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade; and

(b) Part II of that Agreement to the fullest extent not inconsistent with existing
legislation.”

This language is not identical to Article 45. It refers to “existing legislation” and not to a
signatory state’s “constitution, laws and regulations.” It also reinforces the primary
obligation, by requiring the signatory states to give provisional application “to the fullest
extent.” Nevertheless, the clause sets the link between each state’s international law
obligations arising by virtue of their agreement provisionally to apply the GATT and their
domestic law as determined by the former being “not inconsistent with” the latter.

In interpreting this requirement, GATT Panels, following a Working Party Report, adopted
a construction that required that “the legislation on which [the reliance on the proviso] is
based is by its terms or expressed intent of a mandatory character ~ that is, it imposes
on the executive authority requirements which cannot be modified by executive action.”
The proviso did not operate to give priority to all existing legislation. Where such
legislation did not prohibit the executive from committing to the provisional application of
a rule different to the domestic law, the signatory state was obliged to do so in order to

meet the obligations of Part II GATT in accordance with its agreement to provisional

Interpretation in light of the object and purpose of Article 26 of the ECT

29.

30.

31.

32.

33%

When interpreting Article 45 (1), the respective structures of the international legal order
and the Russian legal order must not be lost sight of, in order to fully understand the
object and purpose of Article 26.

As far as the international legal order is concerned, it must be emphasized that to give a
foreign private investor the right to sue a State in which it has invested through a
mechanism of investment arbitration is quite an extraordinary commitment. It is indeed
of utmost importance not to forget that no participant in the international community, be
it a State, an international organization, a physical or a legal person, has an inherent right
of access to a jurisdictional recourse. There is no general rule providing a jurisdictional
or arbitral forum to implement the substantive rights that might exist at the international
level. An arbitral tribunal — just as the ICJ or any international court — does not have a
general jurisdiction, an international arbitral tribunal only has a “compétence
d’attribution”, which has to respect the limits provided for by the States.

And in order to appreciate how a State gives such exceptional power to an international
arbitral tribunal, reference must be made to the national legal order, which distributes the
powers among its different components. In the case of Russia — as probably many other
States — giving such a consent to international investment arbitration is a prerogative of
Parliament either through the enactment of a federal law or the ratification of a treaty, as
will be explained in more detail below.

In sum, it results from this approach of the interpretation of Article 45 (1), according to
the international principles of interpretation, that this article permits the application of the
parts of the Treaty which are consistent with the Russian legal order, and that it must be
carefully verified that Article 26 can be a part provisionally applied.

The next step is, therefore, to verify to what extent the Russian legal order permits
provisional application of the rules of the ECT, and in particular of Article 26.

II. THE CONTENT OF THE RUSSIAN LEGAL ORDER

34.

35.

The international rule — Article 45 (1) — provides that the scope of the provisional
application of the ECT extends only to the rules which are consistent with the constitution,
laws and regulations of the concerned country.

The Award’s approach was to first analyze the consequences of provisional application
in general’? and to then verify that this provisional application is not inconsistent with the
Russian legal order. It seems to me, however, that the consistency test has to be performed
before the consequences of the provisional application are analyzed and not after. The
required consistency with the Russian legal order is a condition for the possibility of

provisional application not a consequence or afterthought of a performed provisional
application.

36. Therefore, in order to determine whether it is possible to apply provisionally the ECT
and, in particular, Article 26, the structure of the Russian legal order has to be examined.

37. It is necessary to specify here the respective roles played by the national legal order and
the international legal order. A mere reading of Article 45 — the international rule — shows
that it proceeds to a renvoi to the national legal orders, This has been aptly summarized
in the Award,2° when stating that “(d)omestic law is relevant because the international
law obligation so provides and then only to that extent.”?!

38. It is, therefore, necessary to look at the Russian legal order, as the ECT directs. For
reasons of procedural efficiency, the analysis will concentrate on the question of whether
the provisional application of Article 26 was consistent or not with the Russian legal
order.

The general questions raised
39. The Award formulated the central issue in the following way:

The Tribunal considers that the principal issue that arises for its decision under this head
is:

Did Russia’s provisional application of the ECT “to the extent that such provisional

ication is not i i with its itution, laws or i under the
terms of Article 45 (1) include its consent to international arbitration under Article
26 (3) (a)?

The answer to this issue turns principally on the question whether the application of
Article 26 is “not inconsistent with” Russia’s “constitution, laws or regulations”,
since Respondent accepts that, if there were no such inconsistency, there would be a

ty obligation assumed by to apply that provision on a provisi
basis.

20 Award, § 206 (c).

21 It can be noted here that the Mulley tribunal considered that because of the international rule of pacta sunt
servanda, national law could not be taken into account, which seems to be a complete misunderstanding of what
Article 45 provides. This is what the tribunal said, in § 313 of the award: “Under the pacta sunt servanda rule and
Article 27 of the VCLT, a State is prohibited from invoking its internal legislation as a justification for failure to
perform a treaty. In the Tribunal’s opinion, this cardinal principle of international law strongly militates against an
interpretation of Article 45 (1) that would open the door to a signatory, whose domestic regime recognizes the
concept of provisional application, to avoid the provisional application of a treaty (to which it has agreed) on the
basis that one or mare provisions of the treaty is contrary to its internal faw.” To the contrary, the Dutch court
understood correctly the interplay between international and national law: “Even while it is possible that provisions
of national law can stand in the way of the performance of one or more provisions of the ECT, the basis for doing
so is encased in the ECT itself —i.e., at treaty level. In other words: a state that relies on a conflict between a treaty
provision and national law, on sound grounds and referencing the Limitation Clause, does not act contrary to the
pacta sunt servanda principle, nor to the principle of Article 27 VCLT.” The Hague District Court Judgment dated
20 April 2016, § 5.19.

The Tribunal is conscious of the fact that this issue is one that has generated differing
views in the jurisprudence and difficulty in the doctrine. While remaining fully
cognizant of the reasoning set forth in the decisions of other tribunals and of those
publicists that have been cited to it, this Tribunal approaches the issue, as it is bound
to do, in accordance with its power and duty to decide for itself upon its own
jurisdiction. It addresses the question independently in the light of the evidence
presented by the Parties before it and of the applicable law as it finds it to be.””

As far as the methodology adopted is concerned, I follow the same approach as the
majority, referring only marginally to the positions of other bodies on the questions raised.

In order to answer the question of whether Article 26 was consistent or not with the
Russian legal order, two complementary questions can be raised, as indicated in the
Award:

The Tribunal therefore now turns to consider whether, and if so to what extent, such
provisional application was “not inconsistent” with the Russian Constitution, laws or
regulations

(d) This requires a conflict with a mandatory rule that precludes the executive from
giving provisional application to Article 26

The Treaty’s distinct references to a signatory state’s constitution and to its laws directs
attention to two distinct ways in which it may be said that the Domestic Law Inconsistency
Clause is engaged:

(i) That the institution of the provisional application of a treaty is itself inconsistent
with the state’s constitutional arrangements in relation to the assumption of
international law obligations under a treaty, because it is in conflict with a mandatory
rule of the Constitution that has the effect of preventing the executive from
exercising a power to agree to provisional application; or

(ii) That the Subj =perer er of the international law obligation i in question conflicts
witha itation imposed by d lation upon the provi:
application of the rareleul type of treaty obligation.”?

A distinction must indeed be made between the consistency with the national legal order
of the procedure for introducing an international mechanism of investment arbitration in
the national legal order and the consistency of such mechanism itself with the national
legal order.

And, in my understanding, the answer to this dual question is that Article 26 providing
for investor-State international arbitration is not inconsistent as such with the Russian
legal order, but that the introduction of this extraordinary mechanism in the Russian legal
order by an act of the executive power is required, as will be explained now.

The mechanism of international arbitration is well-known and accepted as a mechanism
to resolve disputes between a foreign investor and the Russian State. As mentioned in the
Award, “(t)he Tribunal received evidence as to the extensive scope of Russia’s program

of investment treaties, in which the Russian Federation does submit to binding
international arbitration of disputes between it and foreign investors.”™* It appears from
the file that the State has ratified 57 BITs providing for a mechanism of investor-State
arbitration, The mechanism in itself is thus not contrary to the Russian legal order.

45. The same cannot be said of the introduction of such mechanism in the Russian legal order.
The existence of a mandatory rule prohibiting provisional application of Article 26

46. It is sufficient that a rule be inconsistent with either the constitution, or some laws or
regulations, in order for such rule not to be able to be provisionally applied.

47. There has been no submission to the effect that Article 26 would be inconsistent with any
Russian regulation. The inquiry is thus limited to the consistency or not of the introduction
of Article 26 in the Russian legal order with the Russian constitution or laws.

48. As the reason for such choice will become apparent in due time, when the analysis of the
Russian laws on international investment will have been performed, I start the analysis
not with the consistency or not of Article 26 with the constitution, but with the consistency
or not of the said provision with some Russian laws dealing with investor-State
arbitration.

49. Applying the same analysis as was performed for the GATT, it must be verified whether
there exists in the Russian legal order a law of a mandatory character prohibiting the
provisional application of a mechanism of investor-State arbitration, such as the one
provided for in Article 26 of the ECT through an executive act.

50. It can be noted that the Award recognizes that provisional application of a rule would not
be consistent with the Russian legal order “where the legislation contains a mandatory
rule that has the effect of prohibiting the executive from proceeding to give provisional
application to the relevant treaty obligation.”?5

51. [state that such laws exist, and I refer here to the Law on Foreign Investment in RSFSR
(Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic) of 4 July 1991 (1991 FI Law), and the
Law on Foreign Investment in the Russian Federation of 9 July 1999 (1999 FI Law).2?

52. First, it must be mentioned that it was the 1991 FI Law which was applicable when the
ECT was signed. That Law provided the following:

Article 9. Dispute Resolution

Investment disputes, including disputes over the amount, conditions and procedure of the
payment of compensation, shall be resolved by the Supreme Court of the RSFSR or the
Supreme Arbitrazh Court of the RSFSR, unless another procedure is established by an
international treaty in force in the territory of the RSFSR.

Page 13 of 32

International treaties in force in the territory of the RSFSR may provide for recourse to
international means of resolution of disputes arising in connection with foreign investments
in the territory of the RSFSR. (Emphasis added)

The first compelling conclusion is that in 1994, at the time of the signature by the
Russian Federation of the ECT and its agreement to apply it provisionally to the extent
that such provisional application is not inconsistent with its constitution, laws or
regulations, the introduction into the Russian legal order of Article 26 by an act of
the executive was inconsistent with the Law on Foreign Investment of the RSFSR of
1991,28 which provided that such disputes were in principle to be decided by the Russian
court but could by exception be decided through arbitration, if so provided by a
federal law or a treaty in force, in other words, a ratified treaty. There was absolutely
no room in 1994 for the possibility to introduce in the Russian legal order a mechanism
of international investment arbitration such as the one provided for in Article 26, through
an executive act, because such an introduction needed the intervention of Parliament. In
other words, if “international treaties in force in the territory of the RSFSR may provide
for recourse to international means of resolution of disputes arising in connection with
foreign investments in the territory of the RSFSR,” it means that this cannot be provided
by a treaty which is not in force and only applied provisionally.

The Law on Foreign Investment of the Russian Federation of 1999,?° which was in force
at the time of the institution of the proceedings, was adopted in order to acknowledge
the replacement of the RSFSR by the Russian Federation, and provides as follows:

A dispute of a foreign investor arising in connection with its investments and business
activity conducted in the territory of the Russian Federation shall be resolved in accordance
with international treaties of the Russian Federation and federal laws in court, arbitrazh
court or through international arbitration (arbitral tribunal). (Emphasis added)

1 am aware that the law of 1999 does not explicitly refer to treaties in force, but I do not
think that this changes the preceding conclusion. Before explaining why, some words
should be said here, as a background, on the extremely complex situation created by the
end of the RSFSR. A series of agreements have been adopted, and it is not clear exactly
when the Russian Federation and the other successor States replaced the RSFSR, but it
can be no earlier than 8 December 1991, the date of the Minsk Accords.*? What is certain
is that the 1991 FI Law was dated 4 July 1991, and the 1999 FI Law was dated 9 July
1999, and that between those two dates, the RSFSR disappeared, which explains the need
to have a new law replacing the old one. The purpose of the new law was to acknowledge
the change of sovereign, not a change in the respective powers of the legislative and
executive powers.

PCA Case No. 2013-31
Interim Award on Jurisdiction — Dissenting Opinion

The reason why the 1999 FI Law does not differ from the 1991 FI Law is, firstly, that
routinely a reference to an international treaty is a reference to a treaty which is ratified
or, in other words, in force. A provisional application is something special that needs to
be mentioned. A reference to an international treaty, without specification, is, in my
view, a reference to a treaty which is in force following a consent given by the different
methods accepted by international law. The provisional application of a treaty is a
modality of existence of the treaty as if it were in force, but such a treaty cannot be equated
to a “treaty of” the relevant country.

Secondly, the context of the adoption of the new law supports this analysis. There is no
trace in the record indicating that, suddenly, in the 1999 FI Law, the Duma would have
divested itself of its exclusive existing right to create a mechanism of international
arbitration under the 1991 FI Law, without specifying clearly such a dramatic change, for
example in stating in Article 10 that such a mechanism could from now on, in the future,
be created “by international treaties in force adopted by the Duma or international treaties
put in provisional application by the Executive” or “by international treaties of the
Russian Federation, including provisionally applied treaties.”

The majority adopts another interpretation of Article 10 of the 1999 FI Law in the Award
and concludes that because the words “in force” are not there, the concept of international
treaty contains a treaty that is provisionally applied. But, in my view, the exception —a
treaty provisionally applied — cannot be included by implication in the rule, lest there
would be no difference between the rule — a ratified treaty — and its exception — a
provisionally applied treaty.

If such a Copernican change had occurred between the two laws, no doubt there would
have been a lot of political discussion as well as many academic papers commenting on
this major change of paradigm. I am aware of no such document in the file.

There are, however, indicia going in the reverse direction and supporting the view that
the 1999 FI Law did not introduce any change. In the Explanatory Note of 1997 by which
the Government submitted the ECT to the Duma in order for it to ratify it,?! it explained
that once ratified, “(t)he provisions of the ECT are consistent with Russian legislation.”
And when referring to Russian legislation, the Note makes no difference between the
existing FI Law of 1991 and the upcoming FI Law under discussion in the Duma, which
was to become the 1999 FI Law:

The legal regime of foreign investments envisaged under the ECT is consistent with the
provisions of the existing Law of the RSFSR on Foreign Investments in the RSFSR, as
well as with the amended version of the Law currently being discussed in the State Duma,
and does not require the enactment of any concessions or the adoption of any amendments
to the abovementioned Law. (Emphasis added)

No distinction is made here between the 1991 FI Law and the 1999 FI Law.

Although it is sufficient that the introduction of Article 26, through a mere executive act,
be inconsistent with the Russian laws on international investment to prevent the
provisional application of Article 26 and render the analysis of the consistency with the
constitution superfluous, some comments can be made on the approach of this question
in the Award.

The jurisprudence of the Russian Constitutional Court

62.

63.

64.

65.

The jurisprudence of the Russian Constitutional Court (CC) also has to be taken into
account in order to ascertain the content and interpretation of the Russian legal system,
as indeed underscored in the Award.” The Award relies principally on one decision to
analyze the consistency of the introduction of Article 26 in the Russian legal order under
Article 23 of the FLIT with the constitution.

In this regard, the Award puts great emphasis on a decision of the Constitutional Court
dealing with the provisional application of a treaty.?3 The question raised in that case was
the constitutionality of Article 23 (1). This article provides:

Article 23. Provisional application of international treaties by the Russian Federation

1, An international treaty or a part of a treaty may, prior to its entry into force, be applied
by the Russian Federation provisionally if the treaty itself so provides or if an agreement
to that effect has been reached with the parties that have signed the treaty. (Emphasis added)

The Award states the following in relation to that case:

The Tribunal attaches considerable weight to this Ruling of the apex Constitutional Court
in the Russian legal system. It concludes from its Ruling that the institution of the
provisional application of a treaty or part thereof is constitutionally valid under Russian
law and gives rise to rights and duties within the Russian legal system that take precedence
over other Russian laws. The Constitutional Court reached this conclusion, construing a
treaty that was to be provisi applied and ined no d ic law is

proviso. When addressing the question whether there is a constitutional prohibition on
provisional application, the Tribunal regards this Ruling as applicable a fortiori to a case,
such as the present, where provisional ication is subject to ad ic law ii

clause. The Ruling confi irms that, irrespective of the inclusion or omission of a domestic
Jaw inconsistency clause, there is no objection under the Constitution to the provisional
application of a treaty establishing rules other than those provided by law. (Emphasis
added)™*

 

Several comments need to be made here. The first one is that this decision was
accompanied by two dissents, which is a factor that might be taken into account with
regard to the weight to be attached to the decision of the majority. The second comment
is that the decision of the Constitutional Court is not exactly what the majority has
summarized when stating that “the provisional application of a treaty or part thereof is
constitutionally valid under Russian law and gives rise to rights and duties within the

Russian legal system that take precedence over other Russian laws” as my colleagues
ignored an important caveat, which is that the applicability of rules provisionally applied
and their precedence over other Russian laws exist only if the provisionally applied rules
have been duly published in the same manner as a ratified treaty has to be published, in
order to respect the rule of Jaw. This is what the CC said on this question:

 

In this regard, direct i of provisions of a isi ly applied i

treaty of the Russian Federation sine the rights, freedoms and duties of man and citizen
and establishing rules other than those provided by law, shall be preceded, on a mandatory
basis, by its official publication ...

The necessity of the official publication of provisionally applied international treaties of
the Russian Federation affecting the rights, freedoms and duties of man and citizen and
establishing rules other than those provided by law is also dictated by the requirements for
certainty, clarity and unambiguity of a legal rule, as well as its consistency with the existing
system of legal regulation arising from constitutional principles of a rule-of-law state,
supremacy of law, legal equality and justice ... (Emphasis added)*

There is no evidence, to my understanding, that the ECT has been so published. But more
importantly, the only thing that the CC really decided is that Article 23 allowing
provisional application of a treaty — without a limitation clause — was not contrary to the
constitution, as long as the provisionally applied treaty was published, so that such
provisional application is not inconsistent with “the constitutional principle of the rule-
of-law state, supremacy of law, legal equality and justice.”

The CC did not discuss the issue of a treaty with a limitation clause, but the Award
considers that the same solution applies. In fact, the third, and probably the most
important, comment relates to the application of a decision concerning a treaty without a
limitation clause to the very different situation of a treaty with a limitation clause. In my
view, the solution of the Constitutional Court is not applicable a fortiori to the situation
of Article 45 (1), but the reverse solution should apply a contrario. Indeed, Article 23
provides for provisional application if so provided by the treaty. When there is a
limitation clause, the provisional application is not possible if it is inconsistent with the
national legal order, and, in my view, the CC should apply Article 45 as a provisionally
applicable article and respect the limitations provided there to the provisional application.

To illustrate what I consider to be a serious logical error, I think it best to take a more
practical example. Firstly, let us take the case of a provisionally applied treaty without
any limitation clause saying: “Alcoholic drinks are authorized for everyone.” Applying
the CC’s analysis, this rule could apply even if the Russian legal order contained a rule
stating that alcoholic drinks are not authorized under the age of 18, and minors have
therefore a right stemming from the treaty to drink alcohol. Secondly, let us then take the
case of a provisionally applied treaty with a limitation clause saying: “Alcoholic drinks
are authorized for everyone, to the extent it is not inconsistent with the national legal
order.” Assuming that according to the Russian legal order, alcoholic drinks are not
authorized under the age of 18, the reasoning of the Award still implies that even in this

situation, minors can drink alcohol, in violation of the Russian laws. But this conclusion
is in plain contradiction with the treaty.

My analysis would be the following: the treaty in this second situation makes a renvoi to
national law; national law makes a renvoi to the treaty, which creates some circularity,
which has been at the root of many misunderstandings or misrepresentations of the
applicable rules all along in these proceedings. In such situation, as an international
Tribunal, we have to give precedence to the treaty and if the treaty says that it does not
apply if it is inconsistent with the national legal order, so be it. Going back to my example,
in the second situation, contrary to the first one, minors are not allowed to drink alcohol.

In other words, I do not think that the conclusion drawn by the majority from the
mentioned decision of the CC is right, and find to the contrary that it confirms that the
provisional application according to Russian law (Article 23 (1)) depends on the extent
that the ECT allows such application, and, as is not controversial, the ECT only applies
provisionally if not inconsistent with the Russian legal order. The conclusion is that
Article 26 cannot be applied provisionally, because it is inconsistent with the mandatory
rule found in the FI laws requiring a treaty in force as was demonstrated earlier.

In other words, the Russian executive may commit Respondent to the provisional
application of treaty provisions that may be inconsistent with domestic law BUT NOT if
the Treaty itself says that the provisional application is only possible if it is not
inconsistent with the national legal order.

To confirm this evident interpretation, it is interesting to look at the Russian practice vis-
a-vis the ECT or provisional application in general.

I will review here the main documents relating to the practice of the Russian Federation,
which have been analyzed in the Award. °°

Resolution regarding the execution of the Energy Charter Treaty and related documents, 199437

74.

The first document that should be looked at is the Resolution of the Government of the
Russian Federation by which it decided to sign the ECT. All it says is that “[t]he
Government of the Russian Federation hereby resolves ... to execute the Energy Charter
Treaty.” This is in contrast with the Explanatory Notes relating to the introduction of
investor-State disputes in bilateral treaties, which says that these BITs are ratified.>*

°° Award, §§ 234 and ff.

37 Exhibit R-23.

*8 The fact that the annexes to the Note do not deal with Article 26 is irrelevant in my view, as the non-application
of Article 26 was necessarily covered by the Limitation Clause. The Declarations were mainly concerned with
reservations related to other international law rules, not with internal rules, as this was unnecessary because of the
wording of Article 45 (1).

Note on the Legal Aspects of Provisional Application of International Treaties in Russia, 19979

75.

76.

According to the Award, this note was “apparently prepared on behalf of the Russian
delegation to the Charter Conference of the ECT held in Brussels on 8 July 1997.” 4°
Some extracts — different from the one cited in the Award at § 236 —are given here:

From Art. 23 it follows that the treaties, entry into force of which requires certain lengthy
procedures in the State (e.g. ratification), can be applied provisionally.

Provisional application means putting the treaty into effect, applying its provisions in
reality i.e. performing actions foreseen in the treaty to the extent provided for in the
treaty.

.-. provisional application until entry into force and implementation of the treaty is
not the same.

--. Art. 31 (3) of the Law is of principal importance. It states that an international treaty is
subject to implementation by the Russian Federation from its entry into force for the
Russian Federation.

Analysis of provisional (till entry into force) application of international treaties by the
Russian Federation shows that in each specific case a detailed study of the legal scope
of provisional application of the treaty is necessary. (Emphasis added)

This confirms the understanding by the Russian authorities that provisional application
ofa treaty was different from implementation of a treaty in force. It also suggests that one
has to look at the different provisions of the treaty (“a detailed study of the legal scope of
provisional application”) to see which rules are and which rules are not consistent with
the Russian legal order.

Statement by the Delegation of the Russian Federation to the Energy Charter Conference,
4

20024"

The

The Russian Federation has yet to ratify the Energy Charter Treaty, but as a Signatory
Country, it implements the Treaty from the day it entered into force.

We proceed on the premise that the ratification of the Energy Charter Treaty by the Russian
Parliament would largely depend on a successful finalization of the Transit Protocol ...

This harmless political statement made in an international conference should not be
considered to mean more than what it means. It means indeed that the Russian Federation
applies provisionally the Treaty since the treaty has entered into force, not since the treaty
has entered into force for the Russian Federation. The Energy Charter Treaty was signed
in December 1994 but only entered into legal force on 16 April 1998, by application of
its Article 44. What this document means, therefore, is that the Russian Federation applies
the ECT, with the limitation clause, since 1998. This document also reiterates simply the
distinction between a State, which has only signed the treaty and a State, which has

ratified it, and indicates that. it is hoped that a constructive dialogue concerning some

Explanatory Note to the Draft Federal Law “On Ratification of the Energy Charter Treaty,
1997

78.

83.

The Claimant has insisted heavily on this Explanatory Note in order to support its
argument according to which the Russian Federation never considered that the
introduction of Article 26 by an executive act was contrary to the Russian legal order.
The Respondent, on the other hand, has given an explanation according to which the
different statements have to be put in context and mean essentially that once ratified, the
ECT is consistent with the Russian legal order.

This is a Note prepared for the Parliament, in order to encourage it to ratify the ECT. In
order to understand it correctly, one must be attentive to its structure in two quite distinct
parts: the first part is a background presentation of the ECT at the time it was signed; the
second part analyzes all the effects and consequences of the ratification.

In the first part of the document, the position of the Russian Federation as a signatory was
described as follows:

Prior to the entry into force of the ECT, the majority of the Contracting Parties agreed to
apply the treaty on a provisional basis. In this respect, it was decided that such provisional
application of the ECT would be implemented to the extent that it would not be
inconsistent with the constitution, laws and regulations of the country in question.

At the time of the signing of the ECT, the provision on provisional application was in
conformity with the Russian legal acts. For that reason, the Russian side did not make

declarations as to its inability to accept provisional application (such declarations were
made by 12 of the 49 ECT signatories). (Emphasis added)

‘This means indeed that the principle of provisional application limited by the necessity to
be consistent with the Russian constitution, laws and regulations was accepted in the
Russian legal system. This is indeed so, as, at the time of signature, the RSFSR was
applying Article 25 of the VCLT, later embodied in Article 23 of the FLIT cited above.
Russia clearly indicates that if the principle of provisional application had not been
permitted under Russian law, the State would have made the declaration provided for in
Article 45(3).

From the textual analysis, it results clearly that what is declared here to be in conformity
with the Russian legal system is “the provision on provisional application.” It does not
say that the different provisions included in the ECT were in conformity with the Russian
legal system.

In the second part of the Explanatory Note*, all the benefits of the ratification and the
conditions of ratification were enumerated. This part should, in my view, be interpreted

so as to mean, first, what will be the benefits of the ECT once ratified and, second, what
will be the relation of the ECT once ratified — in other words, once in force — with the
Russian legal system.

84. First, all the benefits are enumerated:

Ratification of the ECT will contribute to:

improvement of the investment climate and the creation of conditions for attracting
foreign investments ...4

- the creation of favorable conditions for export ...

the acceleration of Russia’s accession to the GATT/WTO ...

the resolution of the problem of transit of energy resources ...

the facilitation of access of Russian capital to the energy sector of other countries ...
- ... and soon

Ratification of the ECT will also enable:

- Russia’s national sovereignty over its natural resources
- Recognition of the transitional state of the Russian economy ...

Ratification of the ECT will have a major foreign policy impact ...

85. And after this long list of the benefits of ratification, the Explanatory Note confirms that
this ratification does not necessitate any change in the existing laws“, precisely because
these laws authorize the Parliament to provide for international investment arbitration, in
the following terms:

The provisions of the ECT are consistent with Russian legislation.

The ECT provisions touch upon legal principles which are envisaged by such legal acts as
the Law of the RSFSR on Foreign Investments in the RSFSR ...

The legal regime of foreign investments envisaged under the ECT is consistent with the
provisions of the existing Law of the RSFSR on Foreign Investments in the RSFSR, as well
as with the amended version of the Law currently being discussed in the State Duma, and
does not require the ofany ions or the adoption of any

to the abovementioned Law. The ECT is also consistent with the provisions of Russian
bilateral international treaties on the promotion and protection of investment. (Emphasis
added)

86. As summarized during the hearing by Respondent's counsel, this is a “post-ratification
analysis’°, meaning that, once ratified, the rules of the ECT on arbitration will apply and

This benefit post-ratification gives credit to the analysis according to which, before ratification, Article 26 did
not improve the investment climate and create conditions for attracting foreign investments.

‘5 This has been aptly explained by the Respondent in its Reply, § 193: Secon Claimant's citation to the
statement “[t]he provisions of the ECT are is with Russian legis ling and taken out of
context, This statement forms part of the Government’s ‘assessment whether the ECT’s ratification requires the
amendment of existing or the enactment of new Russian laws, .

will not be inconsistent with Russian law, as Russian law accepts that international
arbitration can be introduced by federal laws or ratified international treaties.‘”

87. Asaconsequence of the preceding developments, Article 26 cannot be introduced in the
Russian legal order through an administrative act and, therefore, cannot be provisionally
applied on the international level. As a consequence, Yukos Capital can have no recourse
to investment arbitration, since Article 26 cannot serve as a basis for our Tribunal’s
jurisdiction. In other words, the conclusion is that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction ratione
temporis.

DISSENT ON JURISDICTION RATIONE MATERIAE

88. To make things clear, I am not in disagreement — on the contrary — with the general
theoretical analysis of a loan being able to qualify as an investment if it is associated with
an economic enterprise. In this sense, I fully agree with the following statement in the
Award:

It is not the case that a loan, considered in isolation, is ipso facto an investment; rather ...
the critical distinction is the extent to which the loan is linked to an economic venture in
the host state, **

89. An investment must be linked with a process of creation of value, which distinguishes it
clearly from a sale, which is a process of exchange of value, or a loan, which is a process
of selling of money for a given price, in other words, a process of provisional transfer of
value for a fixed remuneration. As a consequence, a loan per se is not an investment”, a
loan participating in an economic enterprise is an investment.

90. 1am neither in disagreement with the fact that it is irrelevant for purposes of the definition
of investment to ascertain the origin of the funds, i.e., whether they are dividends or not,
whether they come from the investor’s own funds or are borrowed or whether they come
from abroad or not. A caveat here being that, in this specific case, if the loans themselves
were to be requalified as dividends they would not be considered as an investment, a point
on which the Claimant agrees.*° I also agree with the fact that, under the applicable law,

“7 This understanding has also been endorsed by the The Hague District Court Judgment dated 20 April 2016,
setting aside the Awards in Hulley Enterprises Ltd/Yukos Universal Lid (Isle of Man)/Veteran Petroleum Lid
(Cyprus) v. Russian Federation, in its § 5.60: “Whether or not the ratification of the ECT and more specifically of
Article 26 would require and adjustment of Russian legislation, is a wholly different question than the question
whether the provisional application of this provision is in accordance with Russian law. The latter question is not
answered in the explanatory memorandum.”

48 Award, § 434. I also agree with the references to case law and doctrine to support this view mentioned in
§§ 435-437.

4° This has been in particular stated in Postovd banka, a.s. and ISTROKAPITAL SE v. Hellenic Republic, \CSID
Case No. ARB/13/8, Award, 9 April 2015, where the bonds of the Greek Government were not considered as an
investment, as they were not associated with an economic undertaking: “361. If an “objective” test is applied, in
the absence of a contribution to an economic enue, there could Pe no investment. . .. 371, ... under the objective
approach of the definition of what ie. toan economic venture ofa certain
duration implying an operational tisk, the atioa by Podtov’ banka of the interests in GGBs would not
constitute an investment ..

5° See for example, Claimant’ 's Rejoinder, § 126: “A central plank of Respondent’s argument that Claimant has no
protected Investment under Article 1(6) ECT is its contention that the Yukos Oil Loans are not loans at all, but

Page 22 of 32

and taking into account the facts, the operations by which money was transferred from
Yukos Capital to Yukos Oil have to be qualified as loans, and not as dividends,

My dissent is based on the disregard by the majority of the Tribunal of the global legal
operation in which the discussed Loans were included, which, in my view, creates an
unprecedented twist of the concept of what constitutes an investment protected by
international law.

The Award characterizes the central issue relating to jurisdiction ratione materiae in the
following way:

Whether the Claimant “own[s]” an “asset” constituted by a “debt of a company”
“associated with an Economic Activity in the Energy Sector” in the “Area” of the
Respondent such that it has made an “Investment” to which the present dispute with the
Respondent “relat[es].”*"

I would slightly amend this in order to be even more precise by putting the emphasis on
the act of investing rather than on the result of such activity:

Whether the Claimant “own[s]” an “asset”, which it has invested, constituted by a “debt
of a company” “associated with an Economic Activity in the Energy Sector” in the “Area”
of the Respondent such that it has made an “Investment” to which the present dispute with
the Respondent “relat[es].”

This precision is taken from Article 1(6) of the ECT, which states in relevant part:

A change in the form in which assets are invested does not affect their character as
investments and the term “Investment” includes all investments, whether existing at or
made after the later of the date of entry into force of this Treaty for the Contracting Party
of the Investor making the investment and that for the Contracting Party in the Area of
which the investment is made (hereinafter referred to as the “Effective Date”) provided
that the Treaty shall only apply to matters affecting such investments after the Effective
Date. (Emphasis added)?

The Decision in fact acknowledges this aspect,” but, in my view does not draw all the
consequences of this utmost important element present in Article 1(6) of the ECT, which
is the “making” of an investment. If looked at through this lens, the Loans of Yukos
Capital cannot, in my view, be considered as investments.

The conclusion reached in § 513 of the Award, according to which “the Tribunal finds
that the Claimant ‘own[s]’ an ‘asset’ constituted by a ‘debt of a company’ ‘associated
with an Economic Activity in the Energy Sector’ in the ‘Area’ of the Respondent such
that it has made an ‘Investment’ to which the present dispute with the Respondent
‘relat[es]’”, could seem prima facie convincing, especially as the different steps of the
reasoning are excellently presented, but for the fact that the analysis is stopped one step
too early. In other words, the majority’s approach would be acceptable if there existed

dividends. Claimant does not dispute that if Respondent is correct, the Yukos Oil Loans cannot be characterized
as an Investment of the Claimant.”

two sets of completely independent loans, each having its own rationale; but the analysis
is flawed under the circumstances of this case, because it does not really consider
exhaustively the legal construction created by the back-to-back loans.

Before analyzing these instruments, it deserves mentioning that the Claimant tried, in a
first move, to conceal from the Tribunal, and, in a second move, to ignore the existence
of, the back stage loans. Indeed, as is the case in the Notice of Arbitration, there is no
mention of the back-to-back loans agreements in Claimant's Counter-Memorial on
Jurisdiction, when presenting the loans which are the basis of the claim.* This, in spite
of the fact that the Respondent has discovered the scheme and had raised the issue in
Respondent's Memorial on Jurisdiction. This tends to raise the question whether the
existence of the back-to-back loans permits to support the Claimant’s argument that it has
performed an investment in Yukos Oil.

Coming then to the analysis of the back-to-back loans, I will concentrate my comments
on the loan flowing from Brittany to Yukos Capital and then to Yukos Oil. I rely here on
the citations of the loan contracts which can be found in §§ 502-503 of the Award. A
similar analysis on all counts can be performed concerning the loan from Hedgerow.

In my view, the two loans are so inextricably linked that they have to be considered as a
unique global unified transaction: the first loan conditions the second one and vice
versa. It is indeed a “game of mirrors”, but the source of the image is Brittany: the Brittany
loan was only made in order to have the Yukos Capital loan made to Yukos Oil, and the
repayment or non-repayment of the Yukos Oil debt is immediately reflected in the
equivalent repayment or non-repayment of the Yukos Capital debt to Brittany. Not to
mention, of course, their concomitance in time, 12 days for the Brittany loan and 1 day
for the Hedgerow loan. But the links are far more important than that.

The two loans from Brittany to Yukos Capital and from Yukos Capital to Yukos Oil were
quasi simultaneous

100. The first loan agreement on which Yukos Capital bases a claim is the loan agreement

101.

dated 2 December 2003, in which Claimant agreed to loan Yukos Oil an amount not to
exceed RUR 80 billion (US$ 2.7 billion). This loan was linked to a back-up agreement
dated a few days earlier, on 20 November 2003.°°

A very similar analysis can be performed for the Hedgerow loan agreement, which was
signed on 19 August 2004, only one day before the second loan agreement to Yukos Oil
on which the Claimant bases its claim,>” while the back-up agreement between Hedgerow
and Yukos Capital was signed on 18 August 2004.>* This loan was in an amount not to
exceed US$ 355.000.000.

54 There is only a mention of Exhibit C-130 and Exhibit C-131, among many others, in footnote 16 and footnote
307 to illustrate the fact that Yukos Capital entered into more than 40 loans agreements in 2003-2004.

Page 24 of 32

The two loans from Brittany to Yukos Capital and from Yukos Capital to Yukos Oil had
linked purposes

102. In the first leg of the operation, the Brittany loan to Yukos Capital, its purpose is already
indicated to be in fact the purpose of the second leg, as is made clear by different
references in that document, the Lender being Brittany and the Borrower Yukos Oil:

WHEREAS:

(a) Borrower intends to provide a loan facility to OAO "NK "YUKOS" [this is Yukos
Oil], a company duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the Russian
Federation (hereinafter referred to as "Sub-Borrower"'), such loan facility to be granted
shall not exceed 80'000'000'000-00 (Eighty billion) Russian Rubles, shall bear interest
at the rate of 9% per annum and shall mature not later than 31st December 2008
(hereinafter referred to as “Sub-Lending”, and respective loan agreement documenting
such Sub-Lending to be hereinafter referred to as Sub-Lending Agreement);

(b) Lender has agreed to make available this Loan Facility on the terms set forth herein.
NOW, THEREFORE, the Parties have agreed as follows:

Advance
Shall mean any advance made or to be made by Lender hereunder which Borrower
undertakes to use for Sub-Lending.

2, Commitments

Lender agrees on the terms and conditions herein, to make available to Borrower a loan
facility equal to the Facility amount. Lender undertakes to transfer Advances hereunder in
US Dollars to the account of Borrower in total Facility amount in order to make feasible
Sub-Lending by Borrower. (Emphasis added)”

103. Thus, the absolute first thing mentioned in the loan from Brittany to Yukos Capital was
that it was made so that Yukos Capital could — and, in fact, had to — lend the money
received to Yukos Oil. In other words, the purpose of the agreement was not for Brittany
(the Lender) to lend money to Yukos Capital (the Borrower), which could use that money
to invest how it deemed fit; the asserted goal was to lend money to Yukos Oil (the Sub-
Borrower) and this was achieved by linking the two loans together. In the first loan, the
final recipient was already nominally designed. The sole purpose of the Lending by
Brittany was the Sub-Lending Agreement to Yukos Oil.

104, This purpose was then fulfilled almost word for word in the Loan from Yukos Capital
(the Lender) to Yukos Oil (the Borrower):

1. SUBJECT
1.1 During the term hereof the Lender undertakes to grant to the Borrower interest bearing

loans with total amount (hereinafter referred to as “Loan Amount”) not exceeding
80'000'000'000-00 (Eighty billion) Russian Rubles ... and the Borrower undertakes to

repay such loans and to pay interest for use of funds hereunder at the rate of 9% per annum.
(Emphasis added)”

105. In order to fulfill such purpose, some conditions were set forth; some concerning the loan
of Brittany to Yukos Capital, some concerning in advance the loan from Yukos Capital
to Yukos Oil.

106. As far as the conditions of the loan from Brittany to Yukos Oil are concerned, the interest
was set at 8,9375%. The difference with the forecasted 9% of the Loan from Yukos
Capital to Yukos Oil was described during the proceeding as the “spread”, whose role
will be discussed later.

The two loans from Brittany to Yukos Capital and from Yukos Capital to Yukos Oil had
linked conditions

107. As far as the conditions of the second leg of the operation, the Loan from Yukos Capital
to Yukos Oil are concerned, these were entirely pre-determined in the first leg of the
operation, the Brittany loan to Yukos Capital, in the following terms:

(a) ... such loan facility ... shall bear interest at the rate of 9 % per annum and shall
mature not later than 31st December 2008 (hereinafter referred to as “Sub-Lending", and
respective loan agreement documenting such Sub-Lending to be hereinafter referred to as
Sub-Lending Agreement

1. Definitions

Drawdown Date
Means the day when Borrower transfers funds to Sub-Borrower at the request of the
latter under Sub-Lending Agreement.

3. Repayments
Borrower shall repay the amount outstanding within one Business Day upon redemption of
any part of Sub-Lending.

4, Interest

The loan shall accrue interest at the interest rate determined above with effect from
each Drawdown date for actual number of days elapsed thereupon on the basis of actual
calendar year. The interest shall accrue quarterly and shall be payable on the next Business
Days upon receipt of respective quarterly interest from Sub-Borrower, or on final
Repayment Date together with repayment of last outstanding balance to Lender, (Emphasis
added)

108. These conditions set forth in the first leg were mirrored in the second leg:

Page 26 of 32

1.1 ... the Borrower undertakes to repay such loans and to pay interest for use of funds
hereunder at the rate of 9% per annum.

2. RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES

2.4. The Borrower undertakes to repay all loans, borrowed hereunder, to the Lender not
later than 31st December 2008. (Emphasis added)

109. All the parameters of the second leg were already pre-determined in the first leg: the
identical amounts to be loaned, the rate of interest of the second leg, the maturity date of
the loan to Yukos Oil (31 December 2008) and the linked maturity date of the loan to
Yukos Capital (2™ January 2009),

The drawdown dates and the repayment dates of the loan from Brittany are the
drawdown dates and the repayment dates of the Yukos Capital Loan to Yukos Oil

110. Last, but not least, what shows clearly that the two legal instruments are to be construed
as a unique legal operation is the fact that the drawdown date of the loan from Brittany
to Yukos Capital is not the date when the funds are transferred from Brittany to Yukos
Capital, as it should be if it were an independent loan, but the date when the funds reach
Yukos Oil, through the second Loan; and, therefore, the interests to be paid on the first
loan start only to run on the date when the second loan is performed, which is another
way of saying that the money from Brittany received only interest when the money
reached the final intended recipient, Yukos Oil.

111. It seems clear that, in this scheme, the initial actor as well as the final beneficiary of the
whole operation was to be Brittany.

Yukos Capital has no “right” of its own to the interest on and the repayment of the loans
to Yukos Oil protected in international law

112. The majority based itself on the mere legal ownership to assert that the Claimant has made
an investment, The majority considered that the investment of Yukos Oil was its tight to
interests and repayment of its loan to Yukos Oil, as stated in § 505 of the Award:

The only person that holds the right to claim repayment of the debt Tepresented by Yukos
Capital’s loan to Yukos Oil is Yukos Capital. It is Yukos Capital that advances the loans
to Yukos Oil under the Yukos Capital Loan Agreement. Yukos Oil’s undertaking to repay
those loans with interest is made to Yukos Capital alone. Yukos Capital does, therefore,
have an economic interest in the Loans, since it is Yukos Capital that holds the debt.
(Footnotes omitted)

113. It could indeed be argued, as it is by the majority of the Tribunal, that only Yukos Capital
had a “right” to claim the interests and reimbursement of the loan, and that it was the only
entity capable under the contractual arrangement with Yukos Oil to sue Yukos Oil for the
money. This could prima facie seem correct, but it is not if the overall picture is not lost
of sight. Again, this is an analysis restricted to the second Loan without any consideration
of the first loan.

Page 27 of 32

There are indeed mutual obligations in the loan from Yukos Capital to Yukos Oil:

1.1... the Lender [Yukos Capital] undertakes to grant to the Borrower [Yukos Oil] interest
bearing loans ... and the Borrower undertakes to repay such loans and to pay interest for
the use of funds ...

1.23.1, In the event of non-fulfillment and/or not due fulfilment of obligations hereunder,
the Parties shall be liable ...

In other words, if looked in isolation, this agreement seems to grant to Yukos Capital a
right to receive interests and the return of the money loaned, and therefore a claim against
Yukos Oil. However, if looked at in the framework of the unified operation, the “right”
of Yukos to receive the money back is instantly emptied of any substance as it has the
concomitant obligation to hand it the next day to Brittany.

To say it differently, the right to sue Yukos Capital, if exercised, would be in favor of
Brittany, as it was the entity having the right to recuperate the money that initially flowed
from it to Yukos Oil, in passing through Yukos Capital. In other words, the only “right”
that Yukos Capital has is to ask for the money from Yukos Oil in order to transfer
it to Brittany, it does not have a right to receive money for itself, which could be
expropriated, it only had the right to collect the interests and recuperate the loan for
Brittany. This results from § 3 of the loan from Brittany to Yukos Capital stating that
“Borrower (Yukos Capital) shall repay the amount outstanding within one Business Day
upon redemption of any part of Sub-Lending (Yukos Oil).”

. Moreover, if Yukos Oil does not pay, Yukos Capital has no obligation towards Brittany

and therefore does not sustain any loss resulting from the non-fulfilment of its repayment
to Brittany. This is indeed acknowledged by the majority in § 504:

... Undoubtedly, Yukos Capital’s obligation to repay Brittany only arose if and to the extent
that Yukos Oil repaid its debt to Yukos Capital. As between Brittany and Yukos Capital, it
is Brittany that bears the risk of default associated with Yukos Capital’s loan to Yukos Oil,
in terms of Yukos Oil’s failure to pay ...

This was indeed clearly stated in the loan ftom Brittany to Yukos Capital:

Lender shall bear all risks associated with Sub-Lending, including, but not limited to the
following:

(a) Failure to pay, which means the failure by Sub-Borrower to make, when and where due,
any payments under Sub-Lending Agreement;

The substance of Yukos Capital “right” was to transfer whatever it receives from Yukos
Oil to Brittany: if it receives nothing, it has to transmit nothing; if it receives something,
it must transfer it. For me, this is not a substantial right that can be expropriated. The real
owner of the rights and obligations under the set of contracts was Brittany. If Brittany had
not lent money to Yukos Capital, the latter had no obligation to lend money to Yukos Oil.

If Yukos Oil did not repay its loan from Yukos Capital, the latter had no obligation to
repay its loan to Brittany.

120.

S

During the Hearing, answering a question on the difference between a legal owner and a
beneficial owner, counsel for Respondent answered in the following way:

One might analogise to beneficial ownership, but I think that the true economic position
here is that Brittany and Hedgerow were the economic actors, and that, as we've tried to
establish in these proceedings, Yukos Capital was just a passive conduit: it received a fee
for transmitting funds back to Brittany and Hedgerow if and as it received them.”
(Emphasis added)

121.

Although the Respondent was not entirely clear on its position, it asserted that the true
economic actors were Brittany and Hedgerow, and this is sufficient in my view to
consider them as the beneficial owners: they were undoubtedly the ultimate beneficiaries
of the circular back-to-back arrangement.

122. It is well known that, in cases where the legal title and the beneficial ownership are split,
as far as the position of international law towards beneficial owners is concerned, it is
quite uncontroversial that international law grants relief to the owner of the economic
interest and not to the one having a mere legal title.

123. This is how Elihu Lauterpacht summarized the position of international law on this
distinction in his pleadings for Belgium in the Barcelona Traction case:

Precedents recognizes that in cases where there is an apparent division of ownership as
between a formal and legal owner, on the one hand, and a beneficial, substantive actual or
equitable owner on the other, international law ... has concerned itself with the beneficial,
the substantive, the actual, the equitable or the real ownership.

124. It is also important here to quote the Occidental Petroleum ad hoc Committee Decision:

262. The position as regards beneficial ownership is a reflection of a more general principle
of international investment law: claimants are only permitted to submit their own claims,
held for their own benefit, not those held (be it as nominees, agents or otherwise) on
behalf of third parties not protected by the relevant treaty. And tribunals exceed their
jurisdiction if they grant compensation to third parties whose investments are not entitled
to protection under the relevant instrument. (Emphasis added) ©

125. This means, in my understanding, that the concept of beneficial owner extends the
meaning of a nominee or agent beyond the strictly legal concept of such persons, to
encompass also persons who are considered to be in a comparable position, which is
exactly the situation encountered here.

Page 29 of 32

The Claimant did not have the full legal right to use and enjoy either the loan that was
granted to it or the debt that Yukos Oil had towards it, as it was constrained by intertwined
contractual obligations, which made Brittany the initial actor of the loan to Yukos Oil and
the ultimate beneficiary of the debt of Yukos Oil. It cannot, in my view, be denied that
Yukos Capital was a mere passive conduit company, having no autonomous right to
enforce.

It appears that indeed counsel for Claimant has recognized as much during the Hearing,
when he insisted on the unique relevance of legal ownership and stated: “Yukos Capital
is an investor under this treaty, and the fact that the beneficial owner is somebody else is
irrelevant.”*7

I consider that this montage is not far from the situation of the kind successfully raised in
KT Asia® that would support a finding that the investment company is a shell or conduit
used to conceal the identity of the true beneficial owner.”

Yukos Capital has no right to the “spread” provided for in the Loan, which is not an
investment protected in international law

129.

130.

131.

132.

 

It could also be argued, as has been done by the majority, that Yukos Capital had a “right”
to the spread as an investor having made an investment. One of the arguments relied upon
in the Award is indeed that “(i)n addition, the Claimant holds the right to its own return
on the Loans, the loss of which it risked in the event of the failure of Yukos Oil, being
the spread or difference between the interest that it eared and that was earned by
Brittany/Hedgerow.””!

This could seems again prima facie correct, but a closer look at the global operation gives
another picture.

The spread represents one sixteenth of one per cent or 0.0625% of the sums of money
loaned under the 2003 Brittany/Yukos Capital/Yukos Oil loan and one thirty-second of
one per cent, or 0.03125% of the sums of money loaned under the 2004 Hedgerow/Yukos
Capital/Yukos Oil loan.

The spread was not the result of the investment. The result of the investment — if there
had been an investment — would have been an interest of 9%. If Yukos Capital had made
by contract a loan of money A obtained through a loan B in an entirely distinct loan
contract, it could indeed be said that it earned an interest of 9% on loan A and could use
that money to reinvest or to repay the other loan B. However, this is not the result of the
working together of the two linked back-to-back contracts. What mechanism did they
create? They created a differential mechanism: the spread has to be considered for what
it is: it is the payment of the service rendered by Yukos Capital (for non-illegitimate tax
purposes) to the Yukos group, the service of shifting forth and back certain sums of
money from Brittany to Yukos Oil and from Yukos Oil to Brittany. Further, the amount

Page 30 of 32

of the payment of this service was in fact, according to counsel for Respondent, “the tariff
that was charged by Luxembourg for the privilege of using it for its tax advantages, not
for any economic motivation or purpose in the transaction.””? As the Award
acknowledges in § 326:

The Respondent submits that the spreads were calculated to be the minimum necessary to
achieve approval of the arrangements from the Luxembourg tax authorities and avoid the
risk of the tax authorities imputing to Yukos Capital receipt of a larger spread based on
transfer pricing rules. Thus, the spread declined between the 2003 and 2004 loans because
the tax authorities agreed in the interim that the lower spread was acceptable.

133. Moreover, it clearly appears that Yukos Capital was only entitled to this money, if it
fulfilled the whole cycle of conveying the money from Brittany/Hedgerow to Yukos Oil
and back to Brittany/Hedgerow. The spread was not a profit on the Loan, it was not a
return on an investment; it was a payment which was independent of the loan, a
remuneration for being an intermediary. Being a passive intermediary is not “making an
investment.”

134. There have been divergent analyses of whether the loss of the spread was a risk taken by

Yukos Capital.

135. Looking at the loan from Brittany to Yukos Capital, it appears clear to me that the risk of
the loss of the spread was not to be borne by Yukos Capital. As already mentioned,” it
provided that:

Lender shall bear all risks associated with Sub-Lending, including, but not limited to the
following:

(a) Failure to pay, which means the failure by Sub-Borrower to make, when and where
due, any payments under Sub-Lending Agreement; (Emphasis added)

136. The loss of the spread was included generally in the reference to “all risks” and was more

precisely linked to the “failure to pay” by the Sub-Borrower, i.e., Yukos Oil.

137. It is worth noting here the following exchange between my co-arbitrator and counsel for
Respondent concerning the risks assumed by Brittany:

Q. Does that capture any failure to receive the spread?

A. Yes, because it’s any payments under the sub-lending arrangement, and the spread only
arises if there are payments under the sub-lending arrangement and then a repayment to
Brittany.

Q. So there's no risk of not achieving the profit?

A. As I read those terms, that's correct.

Q. When I say there's no risk associated, it’s a question, and you are answering that that is
correct?

A. Correct.”

138. This is corroborated, in my view, by the fact that it is indeed the entity Fair Oaks to which

139.

140.

141.

the 2003 Brittany Agreement and 2004 Hedgerow Agreement were assigned, which is
paying for the expenses linked with the recovery of the so-called “right” of Yukos Capital.
This was explained by Respondent, and not denied by Claimant:

Consistent with Yukos Capital’s lack of an economic interest in the “Loans,” the record
shows that Yukos Capital’s litigation efforts have been paid for by other Yukos Group
subsidiaries. For instance, in November 2010, Yukos Capital and Fair Oaks entered into a
so-called “Loan Agreement” by which Fair Oaks gave Yukos Capital US$ 10 million
interest free, for Yukos Capital to pay lawyers (“2010 Fair Oaks Agreement”). The stated
reason for this arrangement was that “tin accordance with Section 5 of the Loan Agreements,
Lender has agreed to bear all risks associated with Sub-Loans and to indemnify Borrower
[Yukos Capital] for legal and related expenses involved with the recovery thereof and to
compensate Borrower for legal and related expenses incurred by Borrower in the course
of seeking remedies for the default of ‘Sub-Borrowers.”®

There is a strong presumption that the entity paying to vindicate a right is the person to
whom this right belongs. No compelling element has been submitted to reverse this
presumption.

In conclusion, the Claimant cannot be considered as having made an autonomous
investment and the Tribunal, in my view, has no jurisdiction ratione materiae to deal with
the case. Were it to grant the relief requested by Claimant, the latter is, in the framework
of the global operation analyzed so far, under the concomitant contractual obligation to
hand it over to Brittany/Hedgerow. It is particularly important in this case to delineate
precisely the rights at stake, as the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the rights of Brittany
or Hedgerow, as they are not parties to this arbitration.

The importance of the respect of the limited jurisdiction of international arbitral tribunals
— whether jurisdiction ratione personae or ratione materiae — has been aptly emphasized
by the Occidental Petroleum ad hoc Committee Decision:

263. This subjective limitation of ICSID jurisdiction is a natural consequence of
international investment law. Arbitral tribunals are not courts of, justice holding unfettered
jurisdiction. The role of arbitral tribunals is not to redress torts worldwide. Arbitral
tribunals are instruments created by and subject to the consent of States, as formalized in
the relevant instrument, and are only empowered to adjudicate disputes between protected
investors and consenting States, Other disputes are outside their remit. Investors cannot
expand the jurisdiction ratione personae of arbitral tribunals by executing private contracts
with third parties.

264. Specifically, protected investors cannot transfer beneficial ownership and control in a
protected investment to an unprotected third party, and expect that the arbitral tribunal
retains jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute between the third party and the host State. To

hold the contrary would open the floodgates to an uncontrolled expansion of jurisdiction
ratione personae, beyond the limits agreed by the States when executing the treaty. 7°

142. To be clear, the conclusion that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction ratione materiae in this
case is not the result of the application of a so-called theory or doctrine of substance over
form; it is the result of an objective analysis of the concrete result in real life of the legal
structuring of the linked loans.
