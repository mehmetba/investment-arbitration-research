Petition to Enforce Arbitral Award
Petitioners Eiser Infrastructure Limited and Energia Solar Luxembourg S.A.R.L.
(“Eiser”) bring this action to enforce an arbitral award (the “Award”) issued on May 4, 2017 in
ICSID Case No. ARB/13/36 against Respondent, the Kingdom of Spain (“Spain”), following
arbitration proceedings conducted in accordance with the Convention on the Settlement of
Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the “ICSID Convention”).
Pursuant to Article 54 of the ICSID Convention and 22 U.S.C. § 1650a, arbitral awards issued

under the ICSID Convention are not subject to collateral attack and must be enforced and given

Case 1:18-cv-01686 Document1 Filed 07/19/18 Page 2 of 10

the same full faith and credit as if the award were a final judgment of a court in the United
States.

Accordingly, Eiser requests that this Court (1) enter an order enforcing the Award in the
same manner as a final judgment issued by a court of one of the several states, and (2) enter
judgment in Eiser’s favor in the amount of €128 million, together with interest from June 20,
2014 to May 4, 2017 at the rate of 2.07 percent, compounded monthly, and interest from May 4,
2017 to the date of payment in full at the rate of 2.50 percent, compounded monthly.

A certified copy of the Award is attached as Exhibit A to the Declaration of Matthew S.
Rozen (“Rozen Decl.”), Exhibit 1 hereto. A copy of the ICSID Convention is attached hereto as
Exhibit 2.!

Parties

1. Petitioner Eiser Infrastructure Limited is a private limited company incorporated
under the laws of the United Kingdom. Petitioner Energia Solar Luxembourg S.A.R.L. is a
private limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg.

2. Respondent, the Kingdom of Spain, is a foreign state within the meaning of the
Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (“FSIA”), 28 U.S.C. §§ 1330, 1332, 1391(f), 1602-1611.

Jurisdiction and Venue
3. This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to the FSIA,

28 U.S.C. § 1330(a), because this is a “nonjury civil action against a foreign state” on a claim

' Eiser previously filed an ex parte petition to enforce the Award in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York. See Eiser Infrastructure Limited and Energia
Solar Luxembourg S.A.R.L., No. 1:17-cv-03808 (S.D.N.Y. May 19, 2017). After the Second
Circuit issued its decision in Mobil Cerro Negro, Ltd. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,
863 F.3d 96 (2d Cir. 2017), prohibiting enforcement of ICSID awards through ex parte
proceedings, Eiser and Spain stipulated to the voluntary dismissal of the action without
prejudice.

Case 1:18-cv-01686 Document 1 Filed 07/19/18 Page 3 of 10

“with respect to which the foreign state is not entitled to immunity” under the FSIA. Pursuant to
Section 1605(a)(1) of the FSIA, Spain is not entitled to immunity from this Court’s jurisdiction
in an action to enforce an ICSID Convention award because it has waived that immunity by
agreeing to the ICSID Convention. See Blue Ridge Investments, L.L.C. v. Republic of Argentina,
735 F.3d 72, 84 (2d Cir. 2013). Further, pursuant to Section 1605(a)(6) of the FSIA, Spain is not
immune from suit because this is an action to enforce an arbitral award governed by the ICSID
Convention, which is a treaty in force in the United States for the recognition and enforcement of
arbitral awards. Id. at 85.

4. This Court also has subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to 22 U.S.C. § 1650a(b),
which provides that “[t]he district courts of the United States . . . shall have exclusive jurisdiction
over actions and proceedings” to enforce awards entered under the ICSID Convention.

5. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Spain pursuant to the FSIA, 28 U.S.C.

§ 1330(b). Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(f)(1) and (4).

6. The Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seg. does “not apply to
enforcement of awards rendered pursuant to the [ICSID] convention.” 22 U.S.C. § 1650a(a).
Thus, the FAA’s jurisdictional requirements do not apply to this action.

The Underlying Dispute

7. Beginning in 2007, Spain adopted legislation with the goal of attracting
investment in concentrated solar power projects within its territory. Award §§ 102-13 (Rozen
Decl., Exhibit A). In reliance on the financial incentives and inducements provided by these
legislative measures, Eiser invested approximately €126 million in solar power projects in
Spain’s territory. Id. §§ 114-23, 474. After a change in governmental leadership, Spain adopted

a series of laws between 2012 and 2014 retrenching on, and eventually revoking, the economic

Case 1:18-cv-01686 Document 1 Filed 07/19/18 Page 4 of 10

incentives on which Eiser had relied in investing in solar power projects. Id. §§ 137-54. The
rescission of these incentives caused substantial harm to the value of Eiser’s investments. Jd.
49 154, 365.

8. Eiser’s investments in solar power projects were protected by the Energy Charter
Treaty (“ECT”), which “establish[es] a legal framework [for] promoting long-term cooperation
in the energy field” and seeks to “creat[e] a stable . . . legal foundation for cross-border energy
relations.” Award § 99 (Rozen Decl., Exhibit A); see generally ECT (Exhibit 3 hereto).

9. Spain is a contracting party to the ECT,? and consented to submit disputes arising
under that treaty to arbitration under the ICSID Convention. See ECT, art. 26(3)(a), (4)(a)(i)
(Exhibit 3 hereto).

10. Article 26(3)(a) of the ECT provides that “each Contracting Party hereby gives its
unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration . . . in accordance
with the provisions of this Article.” Article 26(4)(a)(i) further provides that where “the
Contracting Party of the Investor and the Contracting Party . . . to the dispute are both parties to
the ICSID Convention,” the dispute will be submitted for arbitration under that convention.

11. Spain is a party to the ICSID Convention.’ Eiser Infrastructure Limited and
Energia Solar Luxembourg S.A.R.L. are investors under the ECT, and are incorporated under the
laws of the United Kingdom and Luxembourg, respectively, both of which are also contracting

parties to the ICSID Convention‘ and the ECT.* ECT, art. 1(7) (Exhibit 3 hereto); Award § 2

Case 1:18-cv-01686 Document 1 Filed 07/19/18 Page 5 of 10

(Rozen Decl., Exhibit A). Accordingly, Spain consented to arbitrate the underlying dispute
pursuant to the ICSID Convention.

12. On December 9, 2013, Eiser filed a request with the International Centre for
Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID”) for arbitration under the ICSID Convention.
Award § 6 (Rozen Decl., Exhibit A). Eiser contended that Spain’s legislative actions that
resulted in the devaluation of Eiser’s investments constituted a breach of Spain’s obligations
under the ECT. Jd. 4 155.

13. An ICSID arbitral tribunal (the “Tribunal”) was constituted on July 8, 2014.
Award § 10 (Rozen Decl., Exhibit A). The Tribunal conducted a Hearing on Jurisdiction and
Merits in Paris, France, from February 15 through February 20, 2016. Id. 473.

14. On May 4, 2017, the Tribunal issued the Award, finding that Spain had breached
its obligations under Article 10(1) of the ECT by failing to accord fair and equitable treatment to
Eiser’s investments within Spain’s territory. Award J 486(b) (Rozen Decl., Exhibit A).

15. The Award requires Spain to pay €128 million as damages. Award § 486(c)
(Rozen Decl., Exhibit A). The Award further requires Spain to pay interest on the damages
award at a rate of (1) 2.07 percent from June 20, 2014 to May 4, 2017, compounded monthly,
and (2) 2.50 percent from May 4, 2017 until the Award is paid in full, compounded monthly. Jd.
§ 486(d).

16. The ICSID Convention provides that a party may file an application for the
annulment of an arbitral award with the ICSID Secretary-General and request a stay of
enforcement during the annulment proceedings. See ICSID Convention, art. 52(1), (5) (Exhibit 2
hereto). Ifa party requests a stay of enforcement, the ICSID Convention provides that

“enforcement shall be stayed provisionally” until the request for a stay has been decided. Jd. art.

Case 1:18-cv-01686 Document 1 Filed 07/19/18 Page 6 of 10

52(5). If the request for a stay of enforcement is denied, the ICSID Convention provides that the
provisional stay of enforcement is lifted and “[t]he award shall be binding on the parties” and
“{eJach party shall abide by and comply with the terms of the award,” notwithstanding the
pendency of an application for the annulment of the award. Id. arts. 52(5), 53(1).

17. After the Award was issued, Spain filed an application for annulment with the
ICSID Secretary-General and requested a stay of enforcement for the pendency of the annulment
proceedings. On March 23, 2018, the ad hoc Committee established in accordance with the
ICSID Convention to preside over the annulment proceedings issued a decision denying Spain’s
request for a stay of enforcement. ICSID Convention, art. 52(3) (Exhibit 2 hereto).

18. The ad hoc Committee also decided to “confirm[] and give[] full effect to
[Eiser’s] undertaking” to Spain (1) to promptly repay Spain any and all amounts received in
satisfaction of the Award to the extent that the annulment application is successful; and (2) to not
disburse or transfer any amounts received in satisfaction of the Award to its investors or to any
third party while the annulment proceeding is ongoing (or thereafter, to the extent the annulment
application is successful). The ad hoc Committee directed Eiser to submit, with all necessary
formalities, such undertaking to Spain.

19. On May 8, 2018, Eiser submitted an undertaking to Spain in full compliance with
the terms stated in the ad hoc Committee’s order. The undertaking was signed by the director of
Eiser Infrastructure Limited and the three directors of Energia Solar Luxembourg S.A.R.L., who
are duly authorized to bind their respective companies to the terms of the undertaking.

20. Accordingly, as provided by the ICSID Convention, the ad hoc Committee’s
decision lifted the provisional stay on enforcement and rendered the Award binding and

enforceable against Spain. ICSID Convention, arts. 52(5), 53(1) (Exhibit 2 hereto). Spain

Case 1:18-cv-01686 Document 1 Filed 07/19/18 Page 7 of 10

objected that the undertaking signed by the directors of the Eiser entities did not meet the
“necessary formalities,” and on May 31, 2018, Spain requested that the ad hoc Committee
reconsider its decision denying Spain’s request for a stay of enforcement during the pendency of
the annulment proceedings. The ad hoc Committee has not ruled on Spain’s request or re-
imposed a stay of enforcement. Also on May 31, 2018, Eiser requested that the ad hoc
Committee confirm that the undertaking provided to Spain satisfies the “necessary formalities”
and stated that, “[iJn the interim, the Eiser Parties reserve their right to commence appropriate
enforcement actions against Spain should it continue to refuse to pay the Award.”

21. The annulment proceedings before the ad hoc Committee are ongoing as of the
filing of this Petition.

Legal Basis for Relief

22. The ICSID Convention provides that contracting parties must “recognize an
award rendered pursuant to [the] Convention as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations
imposed by that award within its territories as if it were a final judgment of a court in that State.”
ICSID Convention, art. 54(1) (Exhibit 2 hereto). The ICSID Convention further provides that a
contracting state “with a federal constitution may enforce such an award in or through its federal
courts and may provide that such courts shall treat the award as if it were a final judgment of the
courts of a constituent state.” Id.

23. The United States is a contracting party to the ICSID Convention and is therefore
obligated to enforce the Award as if it were a final judgment of a court in the United States.°
That obligation is fulfilled by 22 U.S.C. § 1650a, which provides:

(a) An award of an arbitral tribunal rendered pursuant to chapter IV of the

convention shall create a right arising under a treaty of the United States. The

° https://icsid.worldbank.org/en/Pages/icsiddocs/List-of-Member-States.aspx.

Case 1:18-cv-01686 Document 1 Filed 07/19/18 Page 8 of 10

pecuniary obligations imposed by such an award shall be enforced and shall be

given the same full faith and credit as if the award were a final judgment of a

court of general jurisdiction of one of the several States. The Federal Arbitration

Act (9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.) shall not apply to enforcement of awards rendered

pursuant to the convention.

24.  Arbitral awards issued against a foreign state pursuant to the ICSID Convention
may be enforced by bringing a plenary action in federal court in compliance with the
requirements for commencing a civil action under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and with
the personal jurisdiction, service, and venue requirements of the FSIA. See Micula v. Gov't of
Romania, 104 F. Supp. 3d 42, 49-50 (D.D.C. 2015); Mobil Cerro Negro, Ltd. v. Bolivarian
Republic of Venezuela, 863 F.3d 96, 100, 117-18, 119-20 (2d Cir. 2017).

25. Awards issued pursuant to the ICSID Convention are not subject to collateral
attack in enforcement proceedings under 22 U.S.C. § 1650a. “Member states’ courts are ... not
permitted to examine an ICSID award’s merits, its compliance with international law, or the
ICSID tribunal’s jurisdiction to render the award; under the Convention’s terms, they may do no
more than examine the judgment’s authenticity and enforce the obligations imposed by the
award.” Mobil Cerro, 863 F.3d at 102. The ICSID Convention therefore “reflects an
expectation that the courts of a member nation will treat the award as final.” Id.; see also id. at
118 (noting that an “ICSID award-debtor ... [is] not ... permitted to make substantive challenges
to the award”); see also ICSID Convention, arts. 53(1), 54(1) (Exhibit 2 hereto). Consistent with
this mandate, 22 U.S.C. § 1650a(a) provides that the FAA “shall not apply to enforcement of
awards rendered pursuant to the convention,” thereby “mak[ing] [the FAA’s defenses]
unavailable to ICSID award-debtors in federal court proceedings.” Mobil Cerro, 863 F.3d at
120-21. District courts thus enforce ICSID awards without allowing substantive challenges to

enforcement of the awards. See, e.g., Duke Energy Int’l Peru Investments No. 1 Ltd. v. Republic

Case 1:18-cv-01686 Document 1 Filed 07/19/18 Page 9 of 10

of Peru, 904 F. Supp. 2d 131, 132-34 (D.D.C. 2012); Republic of Panama v. Jurado, No. 8:12-
cv-1647, Doc. 18 (M.D. Fla. June 13, 2013).
Cause of Action and Request for Relief

26. — Arbitral awards issued pursuant to the ICSID Convention are subject to
mandatory enforcement in the courts of the United States, which must give those awards the
same full faith and credit as a final judgment issued by a state court. 22 U.S.C. § 1650a(a).

27. The Award was rendered in accordance with the ICSID Convention against Spain
and in Eiser’s favor. Eiser is therefore entitled to enforce the Award’s pecuniary obligations
against Spain.

28. Accordingly, Eiser is entitled to an order (a) enforcing the Award in the same
manner as a final judgment issued by a court of one of the several states, and (b) entering
judgment in Eiser’s favor in the amount specified in the Award.

29. Eiser requests that the Court enter judgment in euros, which is the currency
specified in the Award. See Award J 486(c) (Rozen Decl., Exhibit A). This Court has authority
to enter judgment in a foreign currency when requested by the judgment creditor. See Cont’l
Transfert Technique Ltd. v. Federal Gov't of Nigeria, 603 F. App’x 1, 4 (D.C. Cir. 2015); Cont’l
Transfert Technique Ltd. v. Federal Gov't of Nigeria, 932 F. Supp. 2d 153, 158 (D.D.C. 2013),
aff'd, 603 F. App’x 1 (D.C. Cir. 2015); accord Leidos, Inc. v. Hellenic Republic, 881 F.3d 213,

220 (D.C. Cir. 2018).

Case 1:18-cv-01686 Document1 Filed 07/19/18 Page 10 of 10

WHEREFORE, Eiser requests that the Court enter an order:

(a) enforcing the Award against Spain in the same manner as a final judgment issued by a
court of one of the several states; and

(b) entering judgment against Spain and in Eiser’s favor in the amount of €128 million,
together with interest from June 20, 2014 to May 4, 2017 at the rate of 2.07 percent,
compounded monthly, and interest from May 4, 2017 to the date of payment in full at the rate of

2.50 percent, compounded monthly.
