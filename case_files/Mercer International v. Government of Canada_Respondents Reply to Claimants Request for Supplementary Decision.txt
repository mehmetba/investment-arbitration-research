IL. INTRODUCTION

1. The Claimant’s request for a supplementary decision ("Request") under
Article 57 of the ICSID Additional Facility Rules (“Article 57”) should be rejected.
After reviewing the evidence provided by the Parties, the Tribunal agreed with
Canada and dismissed the Claimant’s claim with respect to BCUC Order G-48-09
("Order G-48-09") under NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1103. The Claimant’s Request

seeks to re-argue this decided question, which is beyond the scope of Article 57.

IL. ICSID ADDITIONAL FACILITY RULE ARTICLE 57 IS LIMITED IN
SCOPE

2. Article 57 provides that a party may request a supplementary decision from

a tribunal in the limited circumstance where it has "omitted to decide" a question in

its award.’ Accordingly, an applicant under Article 57 must clearly identify a

"question" that the award failed to decide,’ and the request must be denied if the

award already provides an answer. A supplementary decision is not an opportunity

for the Tribunal to reconsider its decision or reasoning.

3. Tribunals faced with requests under Article 57 have properly recognized that
its scope is limited. For example, the tribunal in ADM v. Mexico explained that:
“Article 57 does not empower the Arbitral Tribunal to make a new decision, or to
modify its existing decision, or even to supplement the reasoning of its existing

decision.” Similarly, the tribunal in Loewen v. United States explained that "it is not

1 Article 57(1) provides: "Within 45 days after the date of the award either party, with notice to the
other party may request the Tribunal, through the Secretary-General, to decide any question which
it had omitted to decide in the award."

open to the Tribunal to reconsider [its reasoning]" or its decision to dismiss the

claim before it.*

4. In rejecting the claimant's request for a supplementary decision in the
Loewen case, the tribunal considered the entirety of the award to assess whether the
question posed with respect to the claimant's NAFTA Article 1116 claim had been
answered. In particular, apart from a dismissal "of all the claims 'in their entirety"
in the Loewen award, there was "no distinct reference in the Award" to the
claimant's NAFTA Article 1116 claim.’ Nonetheless, the tribunal found that the
dismissal of all of the claims after the examination on the merits - including the
Article 1116 claim - "was a consequence" of the reasoning it had expressed.° Thus,
an assessment of whether a tribunal omitted to decide a question cannot be
formalistic - if the award provides an answer in substance to the question posed,

then Article 57 provides no further recourse.

Ill. THE TRIBUNAL DID NOT OMIT TO DECIDE THE QUESTION
IDENTIFIED BY THE CLAIMANT

5. The question the Claimant alleges the Tribunal omitted to decide in its Award

was the Claimant’s “discrimination claim under NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1103 with

respect to Order G-48-09.”’ It is, however, patently obvious from the Award that the

Tribunal decided this question. In three separate places in the Award, the Tribunal

ruled:

[T]he Tribunal has decided that that the Claimant’s claims for
“discriminatory treatment” based upon NAFTA Articles 1102,
1103 and 1105(1) in relation to BCUC Order G-48-09 must be
rejected.*

The Tribunal (by a majority) dismisses the Claimant’s remaining
claims as to which it has and may exercise jurisdiction; namely: (i)
the Claimant’s claims relating to BCUC Order G-48-09 under
NAFTA Articles 1102, 1103 and 1105.”

As to the merits of the claims made by the Claimant (for itself and

ZCL), concerning BCUC Order G-48-09, the Tribunal dismisses

all such claims under NAFTA Articles 1102, 1103, and 1105(1).1°
6. The Award is clear: the Tribunal answered the question put to it with respect
to Order G-48-09 and NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1103. The Claimant's Request is
nothing more than an attempt to have the Tribunal reconsider its existing decision,

and on this basis alone it must be rejected.

7. The inappropriate nature of the Claimant's request is further shown by the
many other instances in the Award where the Tribunal assessed the merits of the
Claimant's Order G-48-09 claim. For example, the comparators used by the Claimant
to make out its claim under Articles 1102 and 1103 were Howe Sound and
Tembec.'! In particular, the Claimant has argued that Order G-48-09 "effectively
prohibits Celgar’s access to FortisBC embedded cost electricity while Celgar sells its
self-generated electricity", while others, like Howe Sound and Tembec, are afforded

some access to embedded cost electricity under Order G-38-01.” While the tribunal

agreed with the Claimant that Order G-48-09 constituted treatment for the purposes
of Articles 1102 and 1103" and accepted that Howe Sound and Tembec “were
ostensibly comparators” as regards Order G-48-09," it ultimately determined that
neither were "‘in like circumstances’ for the purposes of NAFTA Articles 1102 and
1103.”° This determination again makes it clear that the Tribunal answered the

question the Claimant now alleges that it omitted to decide.

8. The Tribunal also recognized that deference was due to decisions of the
BCUC in the specialized and technical matters of which it is seized - such as those
addressed in Orders G-48-09 and G-38-01. In particular, in support of its rejection of

the Claimant's discrimination claims, the Tribunal reasoned as follows:

Under NAFTA's Chapter 11, this Tribunal cannot operate as a court of appeal
from decisions made by BC Hydro or the BCUC, particularly on such

 

extensive and complex technical matters calling for specialist judgment to be

exercised by BC Hydro and the BCUC at the particular time."®

9. The Tribunal set out further reasons elsewhere in its Award that fully answer
the Claimant’s question with respect to NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1103 and Order G-
48-09. For example, in the context of Article 1105, the Tribunal turned its mind to

the very allegation at the centre of the Claimant’s discrimination claim:

 

(“..the Measures claimed by Mercer are twofold, First, Mercer claims that BCUC Order G-48-09 has
applied a “net of load” standard to Celgar, preventing it from accessing embedded cost power to supply its
load while it sells self-generated electricity.”); and Second Expert Report of Brent Kazcmerek (16
December 2014), 3 (“...BCUC Order G-48-09 prevented FortisBC from selling any electricity purchased
from BC Hydro under the parties’ 1993 power purchase agreement (the “1993 BC Hydro-FortisBC PPA”)
while the self-generator was selling electricity. As FortisBC’s generation and electricity purchases are
commingled into a single resource stack, the practical impact of BCUC Order G-48-09 is that FortisBC is
prevented from selling any electricity to self-generators that are selling their self-generated electricity (c.g.,
Celgar).”).

[...] the Tribunal addresses first the factual premise of this claim as
set out in the quotation from Paragraph 33 of the Claimant’s Reply
above, namely: “BCUC Order G-48-09 imposes a net-of-load
access standard on Celgar, by effectively preventing FortisBC
from selling Celgar any embedded cost electricity from Fortis’ pre-
existing resource stack while Celgar is selling electricity."’

10. After analysing the parties' evidence over several paragraphs,"* the Tribunal

agreed with Canada and found:

[I]t is clear from the contemporaneous documents produced by the
BCUC, Celgar, FortisBC and BC Hydro that BCUC Order G-48-
09 did not “prevent [] FortisBC from selling Celgar any embedded
cost electricity from Fortis’ pre-existing resource stack while
Celgar is selling electricity” [Emphasis here supplied]. Such
prevention is the factual premise for the Claimant’s claim, as to
which it bore the legal burden of proof. Indeed, as the Respondent
pointed out, Celgar acquired a right that no other mill in British
Columbia had, which was the ability to sell all of its self-
generation below its GBL to the market and to supply its Mill from
FortisBC resources so long as that supply did not include BC
Hydro supply to FortisBC under their PPAs.””

11. Since the Claimant relied on the same factual premise for its Articles 1102
and 1103 claims with respect to Order G-48-09, the Tribunal’s factual determination
here fully answers the Claimant’s argument under Articles 1102 and 1103. It is thus
again made clear that the Claimant’s Request asks the Tribunal to reconsider its

decision and reasoning, which it is not permitted to do under Article 57.

12. The Claimant’s assertion that the Tribunal omitted to decide “the question of
Mercer’s claim for damages due to Order G-48-09”” is equally incorrect. The
Tribunal considered all of the evidence and squarely decided the issue in substance.

Putting aside the impropriety of the Claimant's assertion that tribunals should

assess claims for damages where liability has not been established, the Tribunal did,

in fact, make a decision concerning the Claimant’s damages with respect to Order G-

48-09. This is apparent on the face of the Award and is reconfirmed when the

Claimant's allegations are set alongside key sections of the Tribunal’s decision:

 

Claimant’s Reply Memorial, [J] 200-205
[emphasis added]

Tribunal’s Award, [| 7.38-7.40

 

 

200. Canada also contends that thi:
omehow
eliminates any discrimination or that it reduces
Mercer’s damages, in respect of Mercer’s claim
based on Order G-48-09’s imposition of a net-
of-load standard. In making this argument,
Canada appears to be distinguishing (1) harm
caused by Order G-48-09, from (2) harm
caused by the establishment of a
discriminatorily high GBL for Celgar. ...

 

201. ... Mercer disagrees that it is possible to
separate the harm caused by the two Measures.
because they are interrelated. ...

202. ...Mercer agrees with Canada, that, as a
result 0:

Mercer is entitled to, and Mercer
has sought, only damages arising from its
discriminatory, excessive GBL. Specifically,
Mercer claims damages only based on Celgar’s

349 GWh/year GBL, and not based on its

higher current lord

below its current load but above its 349
GWh/year GBL,; it has capped its damages
based on its GBL of 349 GWh/year, and the
2007 load on which it was based. ...

 

 

 
  

 

204. ... If this is what Canada means when it
contends that Celgar’s less favorable treatment

7.38 BCUC G-48-09: As regards the
Claimant’s claims for “discriminatory
treatment” regarding BCUC G-48-09, the
Tribunal can decide these claims with relative
succinctness. As regards such treatment, the
Claimant’s complaint is effectively directed at
BC Hydro and the BCUC for precluding
Celgar’s ability to arbitrage with sales of
energy to third parties, including its ability to
access (via Fortis BC) BC Hydro’s low cost
energy. However, the effect of that complaint is
limited, according to the Claimant’s own case.

7.39 In summary, the Claimant submitted (inter
alia) in its Reply that the

    
 

does allow Celgar

Reply, the Claimant pleaded: “Mercer does not
claim additional or separate damages resulting
from Order G-48-09’s net-of-load restriction,
because, as Canada correctly contends

 
 

7.40 Thus, the Claimant only claims damages
arising from the Respondent’s alleged liability
regarding Celgar’s GBL. The Claimant does
not seek further or separate damages resulting
from Order G-48-09 itself. Given that the

Tribunal has di: d the Claimant’s case

arrangement with BC Hydro,” then Mercer
agrees.

205. Put another way, as Mercer laid out in its
Menrorial, the Tribunal’s initial task with

regarding Celgar’s GBL (see above), the
Claimant’s claim for “discriminatory
treatment” under NAFTA Articles 1102 and
1103 regarding BCUC Order G-48-09 becomes
otiose. The Tribunal therefore dismisses this

 

respect to damages is to determine the GBL claim.
Celgar should have received to afford it
treatment comparable to the best treatment
afforded any comparator. The difference
between that GBL and Celgar’s 2009 EPA
GBL of 349 GWh/year will reflect the
additional quantum of electricity Celgar should
have been permitted to sell. Mercer’s damages
then are based on the diminution in Celgar’s
enterprise value resulting from the loss of that
revenue stream (less Celgar’s cost to procure
replacement electricity). Mercer does not claim
additional or separate damages resulting from
Order G-48-09’s net-of-load restriction,
because, as Canada correctly contends.

   

 

 

13. The Claimant’s suggestion that the Tribunal’s decision was “mistaken”
because damages from Order G-48-09 are “separate” from damages due to the GBL
set by BC Hydro” is not only irrelevant, but contradicts the Claimant’s own
pleadings.” Article 57 is not an avenue to challenge decisions made by a tribunal or

to have a tribunal “supplement the reasoning of its existing decision.””* The question
the Claimant alleges was omitted from the Award was plainly answered. The
Claimant simply appears to be unhappy with the result. The Request is improper

and should be rejected.

IV. CONCLUSION

14. The Request is beyond the scope of Article 57. The Tribunal decided that the
Claimant’s claim with respect to Order G-48-09 had no merit, and it is not open to
the Tribunal to reconsider or supplement its decision or reasons. Canada has
incurred costs responding to the unjustified Request and therefore seeks its costs, in

addition to the costs that it has already been awarded by the Tribunal.
