to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.

On 7 August 2009, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 in which it joined

award, and requested that Claimant address Respondent’s jurisdictional objections in its
Reply Memorial.

On 14 August 2009, Claimant submitted its Reply Memorial.

On 8 September 2009, Respondent submitted its Rejoinder Memorial.

deliberated in writing.

INTRODUCTION TO THE DISPUTE

According to Claimant, it made a significant investment in the aviation industry in the
Czech Republic in 2000 through a joint venture to manufacture aircraft with Moravan-
Aeroplanes, a.s. (“MA”), a corporation incorporated under the laws of the Czech Republic.
On 8 August 2001, Claimant and MA entered into the “Unanimous Shareholder
Agreement” (“USA”), under which Claimant financed the purchase by MA of the assets of
LET, a.s. (“LET”), a recently bankrupt state-owned Czech aircraft manufacturing company.
Under the USA, MA was to acquire the LET Assets and then transfer them, along with
other assets of MA, to Letecké Zavody a.s. (“LZ”), a company formed for the purpose of
the joint venture project. LZ would then issue 49% of its shares to Claimant and assume

MA’s debt to Claimant.

Following alleged breaches of the USA by MA, Claimant sought the assistance of various

officials in the Czech government and initiated criminal proceedings against members of

12

28.

29.

the board of directors of MA and LZ in November 2002. Claimant also initiated civil
proceedings to intervene with certain corporate acts by LZ and MA and to protect its
investment in ongoing bankruptcy proceedings in respect to MA and LZ in late 2002. In
2003, Claimant commenced arbitration in Stockholm against LZ and MA, obtaining an
interim and final award in its favour. According to Claimant, the Czech courts wrongfully
failed to recognise and enforce either award. Meanwhile, the LET Assets were sold off

under bankruptcy proceedings with respect to MA and LZ.

Claimant asserts that its investment in the Czech Republic was mistreated as a result of
inaction of the Czech courts and officials, malfeasance by Czech bankruptcy trustees, and
through the manifest inadequacy of the legal system of the Czech Republic with respect to
the recognition of arbitral awards. For these reasons, Claimant argues that the Czech
Republic is in breach of its obligations under the BIT to “encourage the creation of
favourable conditions for investors of the other Contracting Party to make investments in
its territory” (Article II(1) BIT), and accord fair and equitable treatment and provide full
protection and security to Claimant’s investment (Article II[(1) BIT). Claimant argues that
even if its transaction was flawed, it was nonetheless entitled to call upon the Czech state to
protect its investment and access the remedies available under domestic law, the BIT, and

customary international law.

Respondent disputes Claimant’s claims and emphasises that Claimant voluntarily entered
into the risky joint venture project without performing proper due diligence on MA, its
parent company Moravan, or its owner (all of which Respondent asserts were already
technically insolvent), or securing operational capital that was necessary to run the
business. In addition, under the USA, Respondent observes that Claimant was only ever to
acquire a minority stake in LZ, and thus Claimant would never have enjoyed control over
LZ or MA, and as an unsecured creditor, it was always exposed to the risk of their
insolvencies. As it so happened, although Claimant obtained favourable awards in the
Stockholm Arbitration, it was not able to enforce them against MA and LZ because the two
companies were placed into bankruptcy. Respondent argues that the Czech courts were
justified in refusing to enforce the Final Award of the Stockholm Arbitration because LZ
and MA had been declared bankrupt before the Stockholm Tribunal rendered the Final
Award, and that no state would allow a creditor to register a security interest over the assets

of a debtor once it is the subject of bankruptcy proceedings.

Respondent submits that Claimant cannot now seek to have the Czech Republic indemnify
the consequences of Claimant’s poor business decisions. Respondent argues that Claimant
negligently assumed extreme financial risks in relation to its decision to attempt to produce
aircraft at the LET factory and in the structuring of its investment, including by recklessly
failing to secure for itself any standard legal protections in the joint venture agreement as a
result of which it lost that investment. Respondent asserts that the obligations of the Czech
Republic under the BIT do not include guaranteeing the contractual obligations or financial

viability of private parties.

Finally, Respondent insists that Claimant cannot show loss as a result of the Czech

Republic’s acts or omissions.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND TO THE DISPUTE

What follows is a chronological summary of certain facts, some of which are disputed, that
are relevant to this dispute without prejudice to the full factual record in this case that the

Tribunal has considered.

LET and Moravan a.s. (“Moravan”) were both state-owned companies involved in the

manufacture of aircraft in the Czech Republic.? Moravan was the parent company of MA.*

In 1994, LET produced 40 L-410 aircraft for delivery to a customer in the former USSR.
The customer never paid for 35 of the 40 aircraft and as the production of these aircraft had
been financed with bank loans, LET went into bankruptcy and was eventually privatised.
Several successive managements of LET were unable to find customers for the unsold

stock during the ensuing seven years.*

On 16 July 1996, LET agreed with its creditors on a bankruptcy settlement. This settlement
was guaranteed by Komeréni banka, a then state-owned bank and large creditor of LET.
LET emerged from its first bankruptcy partially financially restructured, with its debt
reduced from more than CZK 5.4 billion to some CZK 2 billion.”

On 17 March 1998, LET entered into an agreement with a strategic investor, Ayres
Corporation (“Ayres”), a small US corporation, for the production of a small cargo
aircraft. Claimant alleges that under this agreement, Ayres had to assume significant debt

encumbering the LET Assets.’

According to Respondent, the aircraft was ultimately never manufactured and the business
relationship between LET and Ayres never produced the results intended by their
agreement. LET was declared bankrupt for a second time on 24 October 2000. The
investment by Ayres represented the only strategic investment in LET between its

privatisation and bankruptcy.*

On 25 May 2000, Donald Jewitt (“Jewitt”), President of FPS,’ entered into a Memorandum
of Understanding with MA, regarding the possible commercialisation of the Finist aircraft,
a Russian-designed utility aircraft. At that time, Mr. Libor Soska (“Soska’”) was the
President and Chairman of the Board of Directors of MA. In its first year of operation,

Claimant asserts that this project appeared to proceed well. A formal partnership agreement

Matusik is the Vice-President of and aviation consultant to FPS."

On 20 July 2000, pursuant to a written agreement dated 18 July 2000, Claimant advanced
USD 200,000 to MA for the purchase of an SM-92 Finist aircraft and to partially fund
design royalties to be paid to TechnoAvia, a Russian company that owned the rights to the
SM-92 Finist Aircraft.'* A license agreement effective 28 September 2000 for the
manufacture of Finist aircraft was executed between MA, as agent and trustee for Claimant,

and TechnoA via.”

On 4 December 2000, Claimant advanced a further USD 100,000 to MA.'*

It was against this background that Claimant and Matusik considered expanding their

business relationship with Soska, specifically by purchasing the LET Assets.'*

Claimant asserts that as part of its due diligence, it considered the legal and political context
of investing in the Czech Republic through attendance at meetings with representatives of
the Czech government, and reviews of websites and materials directly and indirectly
maintained by the Czech Republic, noting that the Czech government was boasting a safe,
modern, transparent, and predictable investment climate including a robust arbitration

regime.'® Claimant also asserts that it analysed all available information about the LET

In late 2000, LET was declared bankrupt.'*

According to Claimant, in early 2001, Soska indicated to Claimant that MA had the
opportunity to get involved in other projects with leading European aircraft manufacturers
and suggested the acquisition of the LET facility by MA and Claimant in a joint venture to

operate as LZ in order to expand the manufacturing capacity of MA."

existent for seven years.””

A Memorandum of Information dated March 2001 prepared by the bankruptcy trustee of

LET in connection with the sale of LET identified the risk of inadequate operating capital.”'

While investigating the potential purchase of the LET Assets, Claimant was allegedly
informed that, in the course of Soska’s negotiations with JUDr. Zlatava Davidova
(“Davidova”), the bankruptcy trustee of LET, she had indicated that a much reduced price
for the LET Assets was available on the understanding that LET would be dedicated to the
revival of the Czech aircraft manufacturing industry, and on the condition that those assets
would be controlled at least 51% by Czech nationals or a Czech entity because of the

political importance of the aircraft industry. This reduced price would be the result of the

On 25 July 2001, a creditor of MA, Tora Group, filed a petition for the bankruptcy of MA

and the evidence indicated that MA was bankrupt.”*

On | August 2001, LZ was registered with the Commercial Register of the Regional Court

in Brno (“Commercial Register”, “Regional Court’) as a wholly owned subsidiary of

MA2°

On 8 August 2001, Claimant and MA entered into the USA®*! under which, Claimant states,
MA agreed to acquire the LET Assets and transfer them, along with other assets of MA, to
LZ, and LZ would then issue 49% of its shares to Claimant and assume MA’s debt to
Claimant. The loan from Claimant to LZ of CZK 203,000,000 was secured by a
promissory note annexed to the USA (“Promissory Note’) and a covenant that the loan was
to be a first secured charge against the assets of MA and LZ.” Claimant asserts that it was
induced to enter into the USA on the basis of the success of its original engagement with
MA.** Prior to 8 August 2001, a representative of MA allegedly advised Claimant that
Moravan was unable to repay its bank debt and was involved in a dispute with its financing

banks.

On 9 August 2001, Claimant made the third of four payments for the financing of the
purchase of the LET Assets, to MA, in the amount of CZK 35,000,000.*°

Claimant and Soska also agreed, aside from the USA, that Moravan would secure the
payment of taxes and other expenses incurred in the transfer of the LET Assets, which were
expected to exceed CZK 100,000,000 and potentially reach an amount equivalent to the
selling price of the LET Assets.” The amount of transfer tax due on the real property was

assessed at CZK 61,000,000, which was approximately 2.5 times MA’s profit in 2000.”

On 14 August 2001, Claimant made the fourth and final payment for the financing of the
purchase of the LET Assets, to Davidova, in the amount of CZK 80,000,000.**

On 15 August 2001, MA and Davidova entered into two purchase and sale contracts for the
production assets of LET and the tangible assets of Turbolet, s.r.o. (a LET subsidiary), and

a contract for the transfer of aircraft type certificates.”

It is uncontested that at the time the loan was disbursed by Claimant, its security interest
over the movable and immovable assets of MA and over the LET Assets (after they were
acquired) was not perfected.“ According to Claimant, between mid-2001 (prior to
execution of the USA) and early 2002, it made repeated requests to MA for a listing of the
LET Assets in order to register its security interest, all of which were deflected by

representatives of MA.“! Mrs. Zlata Groningerova (“Gréningerova”), Director in Chief of

the CKA, acknowledged that the problems associated with gaining control of the LET

Assets were anticipated.”

After acquiring the LET Assets, MA failed to transfer all of the LET Assets to LZ, failed to
transfer 49% of the shares of LZ to Claimant, and failed to provide a listing of the LET
Assets and where they were located. Claimant alleges that both MA and LZ, controlled by

Soska, immediately commenced a covert and unauthorised liquidation of the LET Assets.”*

Soon after the closing of the purchase of the LET Assets, Claimant began to have concerns
about the intentions of MA and its principals to fulfil the obligations to FPS under the USA
because MA began sending allegedly nonsensical financial and technical data to

Claimant.*

In mid-October 2001 at a Czech government-sponsored reception in Calgary, Claimant met
with Mr. Jiri Parkmann (“Parkmann”), Consul General for the Czech Republic in Canada,
and Mr. Jerry Jelinek (“Jelinek”), Czech Honorary Consul in Calgary, Alberta. Parkmann
and Claimant discussed Claimant’s project and Parkmann provided information on the

Czech government, business environment, and tax system.”

On 22 October 2001, a general meeting of LZ was held. At this meeting, Soska was
declared president of the LZ Board of Directors and authorised the issuance of 309 new
shares at a value of CZK 1,000,000 each. Claimant learned of this meeting in September
2002.

Respondent alleges that the bankruptcy trustee of MA later invalidated the October 2001
contribution of assets by MA into the capital of LZ pursuant to the USA on the basis of the
effective date of bankruptcy of MA of 14 August 2001."7

On 6 December 2001, Claimant made a further payment to MA, in the amount of

CZK 3,712,296.

From late 2001 to June 2002, Claimant developed plans for the establishment of a support
and service facility for L-410 aircraft in Midland, Texas (the “Midland Facility”).

In January 2002, Claimant developed further concerns when it was informed by Thomas
Heath (“Heath”), a pilot and marketing consultant that had been hired to assist the
management of LZ with negotiations with Rolls Royce and BAE Systems, that discussions
between LZ and prospective customers had only been at a high level of abstraction without
any discussion of the manufacturing and financial specifics necessary to conclude a

contract for work.*°

On 25 February 2002, Claimant conducted meetings with representatives of Rolls Royce
and BAE Systems to discuss business opportunities, such as the manufacture of engine

parts for Rolls Royce by LZ.”'

On 27 February 2002, Soska was declared personally bankrupt by Resolution of the
Regional Court in Brno. He appealed the declaration on 14 March 2002 and it was
annulled by the High Court in Olomouc on 24 May 2004.” Claimant learned of Soska’s

bankruptcy proceedings had been nullified.**

In April 2002, Soska sent certificates for purported post-dated non-registered bearer shares

for 49% of LZ’s issued shares for a total face value of CZK 151,000,000 to Claimant.**

On 12 June 2002, Soska refused to sign agreements with North American partners that
would permit the plans for the Midland Facility to proceed. Claimant asserts that the plans

thereby came to a halt.

In July 2002, Jewitt discovered that the share certificates he received from Soska were not

authentic.°°

By July 2002, the relationship between Soska and Jewitt had broken down completely.*”
Respondent contends that following the end of this relationship, LZ did not have a source

of funding for its business.”

In July 2002, Matu8ik travelled to the Czech Republic with a representative of a financing
company to introduce him to LZ’s business and to continue discussions regarding the

Midland Facility.”

Also in July 2002, Mr. Brett Olsen (“Olsen”), counsel for Claimant in Canada, contacted

to report those concerns to the Minister of Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic.”
Claimant asserts that it had been assured by Parkmann and Jelinek that the aviation industry
was very important to the Czech Republic and therefore that government officials were

likely to assist Claimant to protect its investments."

Minister and Minister of Industry and Trade to request a personal meeting. Following a
change in government, on 26 July 2002, Claimant wrote to Mr. Ji#f Rusnok (“Rusnok”), the

By letters dated 26 July 2002 and 8 August 2002, the Deputy Minister of Industry and
Trade, Vaclav Srba (“Srba”), indicated to Claimant that while the Czech government was
not a party to the dispute between Soska (as owner of Moravan) and Ceskoslovenské

Referring to your request concerning a personal discussion with the Ministry of

the Czech companies Moravan, a.s., and Letecke zavody, I let you know the
following:

The Ministry of Industry and Trade is not a party in the dispute that exists between the
principal owner of Moravan Ing. Soska and the Czechoslovak Commercial Bank, and
in view of the fact that it is a case of private subjects, the Ministry has no possibility to
intervene in it. At present, a transfer of receivables related to the company Moravan
a.s., from the Czechoslovak Commercial Bank to the Czech Consolidation Agency
takes place, and this transfer having been finished, the State will have a possibility to
enter into negotiations with Ing. Soska from its position of a creditor. We suppose that
the solutions will be found allowing investments of your clients to serve further on the
original purpose, as mentioned in your letter. (emphasis added)

Letter from Srba to Olsen, dated 8 August 2002 (Exhibit C-0032), which provides in relevant part::

in addition to my letter of July 24, 2002 I informed you about the present relation of
the Ministry of Industry and Trade to the points at issue regarding the Moravan as.
and Letecké zavody a.s. companies described in your above mentioned letter. From

The CKA acquired the receivable against Moravan from CSOB in July 2002. Srba also
informed Claimant that he had been entrusted by Rusnok to arrange for the direct
negotiation of the transfer of the debt to the CKA and had charged the Senior Director of

the Ministry Ing. Josef Jarabica (“Jarabica”) to meet with Claimant.“

From approximately the second half of 2002 onwards, LZ began to default on its debts and
its creditors began to file court enforcement orders; thirteen orders for attachment between
26 August 2002 and 23 November 2003, ranging in value from CZK 14,490 to
CZK 3,600,000 were issued.

On 21 August 2002, Moravan was declared bankrupt and the CKA was identified as its

On 21 August 2002, Claimant had its first of several meetings with Jarabica.” At this
meeting, Claimant informed Jarabica of the events to date, including the fact that Soska had
been petitioned into personal bankruptcy on 27 February 2002 and was therefore not
entitled, as Claimant understood it, to hold office or be a director of any company in the
Czech Republic. Jarabica allegedly (i) assured Claimant that he would speak to the
Minister of Industry and Trade and the Minister of Justice with a view to finding a solution
to Claimant’s problems and that the Czech government would do all that it could to support
Claimant in its future business activities; and (ii) expressed the importance of Claimant
having met with him, and the ongoing interest of the Czech government in encouraging

Claimant in the revival of the Czech aircraft industry.

In late August 2002, Claimant met again with Jarabica to urge him to take steps to ensure
that the CKA together with the bankruptcy trustee take immediate control of the assets of
Moravan.” Between 2002 and 2004, Claimant alleges that it had three additional meetings

with Jarabica seeking assistance from the Czech government to recover the LET Assets.”

In September 2002, Claimant retained JUDr. Jaroslav Sup (“Sup”) of Transfin International

s.r.0. (“Transfin”) to act as agent for Claimant in the Czech Republic.”

Also in September 2002, Claimant met with Josef Orbes (“Orbes”) of LEGES v.o.s.
(“LEGES”), the bankruptcy trustee for Moravan, to ask him to use Moravan’s ownership of
MA and MA’s control of LZ to preserve the LET Assets. Orbes allegedly advised
Claimant that he did not have control of any of the assets, nor did he have access to the

Moravan premises without Soska’s permission.”

Claimant also met with Gréningerova in September 2002, at which time Claimant asserts

that it urged the CKA to take steps to ensure that Orbes assume control of Moravan and its

subsidiary companies to preserve the value of Moravan’s assets. As MA and LZ were
subsidiaries of Moravan, Claimant alleges that Moravan’s assets indirectly included the

LET Assets.”

Approximately one week after Claimant met with Gréningerova, she met with Orbes and at
that meeting, Orbes explained to her that he had reason to be concerned that improper
transfers of property out of Moravan into other companies had taken place. He had been
barred from Moravan’s premises, and he had requested police assistance in an effort to gain

access to the premises.”

On 13 September 2002, a general meeting of shareholders of LZ was held (“LZ General
Meeting”). Claimant was denied entry to the meeting. Consequently, Claimant filed a
shareholders’ protest with the official notary recording the minutes of the meeting, noting
that it was denied entry to the meeting and that LZ had failed to provide notice of the LZ
General Meeting to Claimant. On 9 October 2002, Claimant filed a second protest.” The
minutes of the LZ General Meeting showed MMT Plus, s.t.o. (“MMT”) as 51%
shareholder and MA as 49% shareholder in LZ. Soska was recorded as the principal and
ZLIN-LET America, Inc. was recorded as the 100% shareholder of MMT.” An application

for entry of changes in the Commercial Register was delivered on the same day.”

On 31 October 2002, Claimant wrote to the CKA requesting again that it take control of the

assets of MA and the LET Assets.” Claimant did not receive a response to this letter.”

resolutions adopted at the LZ General Meeting: (i) changing the Articles of Association of
LZ to increase the number of members of the board of directors of LZ from three to five;
and (ii) increasing the basic capital of LZ by CZK 298,000,000 through a monetary
contribution from Claimant (“Resolutions Claim”). Claimant also applied for an interim
injunction to prevent entry in the Commercial Register of the resolution increasing the

basic capital (“Injunctions Claim”).*°

On 4 December 2002, Claimant’s Injunctions Claim was denied on the grounds that
Claimant had applied to enjoin a third party, the Commercial Register, and only an

obligation relating to cooperation with the courts can be imposed on a third party."

On 20 November 2002, JUDr. Jitka Tutterova (“Tutterova”), counsel for Claimant in the
Czech Republic, filed a criminal complaint with the Supreme Public Prosecutor in Brno
against Soska, and his fellow LZ board members, Messrs. Toma’ Steffainek and Patrik

Joachimezyk (“Stefanek” and “Joachimezyk”). 8

On 10 December 2002, Sup delivered a motion to initiate the criminal prosecution of Soska
and Joachimezyk to the Police Presidium of the Czech Republic, Office for the Detection of
Corruption and Serious Economic Crime in Prague, with a copy to the Office of the
Municipal Prosecutor in Brno. The complaint alleged the crimes of fraud, breach of

obligations in the administration of property of others, breach of mandatory rules

of commercial conduct, and forging and altering of monetary instruments. On

20 March 2003, the crime of misappropriation of assets was added to the complaint.’

By inventory report dated 10 December 2002, Orbes included the entirety of the businesses
of MA and LZ (including all of the LET Assets) in the bankruptcy estate of Moravan.
Claimant received notification of this inclusion by letter from Orbes dated
12 December 2002.“ In this report, Orbes recognised the economic potential of Moravan’s
assets, but noted that certain assets had been withdrawn from Moravan illegally, leaving

significant liabilities in the company.*°

On 11 December 2002, Claimant sent a letter to the Zlin Financial Authority (copied to the
Brno Tax Directorate and the Ministry of Finance) to request supervisory activity to protect
the investment of FPS due to possible tax evasion by MA. The Ministry of Finance

confirmed that it had received Claimant's letter on 10 February 2003.*°

On 12 December 2002, Orbes sent a notice to subsidiary companies of Moravan (including
MA), the Regional Court, and Moravan’s largest creditors,” indicating that certain assets
owned by subsidiary companies were included in the bankruptcy estate of Moravan and
that the subsidiary companies “did not have a right to do anything with the assets of the
bankrupt Moravan corporation enlisted in a bankruptcy list without the trustee’s

approval.”**

On 14 January 2003, Claimant met again with Orbes to discuss the status of the bankruptcy
proceedings of Moravan and the fact that Orbes had included the LET Assets in the

bankruptcy estate of Moravan.”

According to Claimant, at this meeting, Orbes indicated
that he wanted to help but that he could not get control of the situation — apparently the
local police would not help him get through the plant gates and the local courts were of no

assistance.”

Orbes accepted documents presented by Claimant evidencing its ownership of
49% of the shares of LZ and accepted that Claimant would be the negotiating partner for
future acts taken by Orbes as bankruptcy trustee for Moravan. Orbes indicated that within
approximately one month, he expected to have assumed shareholder rights in the
subsidiaries of Moravan and that the Regional Court will have issued an interim injunction,

which would allow him to take steps with respect to the Moravan group of companies.”"

Following this meeting, Sup prepared a draft agreement for execution by Claimant and
LEGES which documented Orbes’ commitment on behalf of LEGES as bankruptcy trustee
for Moravan to honour the USA, and the contemplated cooperation between LEGES and
Claimant (“Draft Cooperation Agreement”).”” Claimant alleges that before Orbes could
execute the Draft Cooperation Agreement, he was removed from his position representing
LEGES as bankruptcy trustee for Moravan and was replaced by his estranged wife, JUDr.
Bronislava Orbesova (“Orbesova”), also of LEGES.”

By letter dated 24 January 2003, Claimant submitted information to the Regional Court
with regard to the entries in the Commercial Register pertaining to the legal status of MA
and LZ and requested that the Commercial Register correct the entries to comply with the

Commercial Code.*

Claimant notes that it met with Orbes several times between the initial meeting in September 2002
and January 2003 to address the status of the bankruptcy proceedings of Moravan. Claimant’s Post-

On 5 March 2003, the Commercial Register requested that MA provide within 30 days
information to show that Soska and Joachimczyk were executing their positions as directors
as prudent managers pursuant to Section 31(a)(4)(d) of the Commercial Code. MA did not

reply to this request. Claimant was not informed of this request.”*

On 20 March 2003, Claimant sent a letter to the Supreme Public Prosecutor to follow up
with respect to the complaint it had filed on 20 November 2002.°° On 1 April 2003, the
Supreme Public Prosecutor appeared to treat the 20 March 2003 letter as a motion for
supervision of the Regional Public Prosecutor’s Office in Brno and submitted Claimant’s

letter to the High Public Prosecutor's Office in Olomouc.”

On 2 April 2003, the Commercial Register requested that MA submit within 30 days the
decision of the relevant body of the company confirming the election or appointment of
Soska and Joachimezyk as board members pursuant to Section 31(a)(6) of the Commercial

Code (“2 April 2003 Request”).”*

On 15 April 2003, Claimant met with JUDr. Vojtech Filip (“Filip”), Vice-President of the
Czech Republic parliament to complain about the alleged delays by the courts and law
enforcement authorities. On 16 April 2003, Sup sent to Filip further information regarding

their discussions about the USA and the Commercial Code.”

On 16 April 2003, the Ministry of Justice wrote to the Regional Court requesting a report

Register as members of the board of directors of MA and LZ.'”

On 23 April 2003, JUDr. Petr Kovanié (““Kovanié’”), Vice-Chairman of the Regional Court,
in response to the 16 April 2003 request from the Ministry of Justice, reported on the steps
that had been taken pursuant to Claimant’s request, namely that a request had been sent to
MA “‘to document to the court that [Soska, Joachimezyk, and Stefanek] fulfil the mandatory
conditions for execution of their posts pursuant to Section 31(a) of the Commercial Code”
within 30 days, which the Regional Court reported had not elapsed at that time. Kovanié
noted that it took no action with respect to Claimant’s request regarding LZ because it was
satisfied by the minutes of the LZ General Meeting.'"' Kovanié explained that the effects
of the declaration of bankruptcy of Moravan on 21 August 2002 would not extend to “other
entities not affected by the bankruptcy”, that a resolution on the Moravan bankruptcy was
not yet enforceable because an appeal to the declaration of bankruptcy had been filed, and
that without an enforceable resolution, the termination of the posts described in Section
31(a) of the Commercial Code could not take place.'” Kovanié noted that Sup had visited
the Regional Court on | April 2003 to make the same request in person and that the above-

described position of the court had been explained to him at that time.'®

By letter dated 7 May 2003, Soska responded to the 2 April 2003 Request, informing the
Regional Court that there was “disagreement between registrations in the Commercial
Register and reality” as Moravan was no longer the sole shareholder of MA. Soska
enclosed two resolutions adopted by the West Indies Mercantile Corporation (“WIMCO”),
a Panamanian corporate body, purporting to act as the sole shareholder of MA and

confirming the appointments of Soska, Joachimezyk, and Stefanek as members of the

Secretary of the Czech Republic Government, Minister of Justice and Chairperson of the
Legislature. By letter dated 14 May 2003, Rychetsky responded to questions raised during

105

the 15 April 2003 meeting between Claimant and Filip.

On 15 May 2003, Claimant received a letter from the High Public Prosecutor’s office in
Olomouc confirming that it had initiated supervision of the Regional Public Prosecutor’s

On 4 June 2003, the Commercial Register requested that MA submit within 15 days
documents showing that it did not have a sole shareholder named Moravan. MA did not

respond. Claimant was not informed of this correspondence.'”

On 23 July 2003, Claimant initiated private arbitration proceedings in Stockholm against
MA and LZ for alleged breaches of the USA including (i) failure to deliver 49% of the LZ
shares to Claimant; (ii) failure to make payments on the loan; and (iii) the improper and

fraudulent disposition of the LET Assets (“Stockholm Arbitration”).!

On 18 September 2003, the Czech Republic Police dismissed Claimant’s

dismissal of its motion for criminal prosecution with the Police Force of the Czech

Republic, Corruption and Economic Crime Unit.''®

On 8 October 2003, the Czech Social Security Administration filed a petition for the
declaration of bankruptcy of LZ. At that point, it was owed over CZK 55,000,000 in

unpaid social security tax by LZ."

By letter dated 14 November 2003, Claimant inquired about the status of its application at
the Regional Court with respect to MA and LZ.''? On 25 November 2003, the Regional
Court responded that MA “produced the required evidence but had not produced other
necessary documents”. Claimant notes that the Regional Court did not mention LZ, the
purported shareholding of WIMCO, or that the deadline for MA to produce “other

” ae 3
necessary documents” had passed some five months earlier.''

As of November 2003, LZ had outstanding (unaudited) short-term obligations of
CZK 266,000,000, excluding the loan from Claimant, and had stopped paying salaries to its

employees.''*

improperly selling and disposing of the LET Assets acquired with Claimant’s funds. The

dispositif of the Interim Award provided:

IT IS HEREBY ORDERED AS FOLLOWS:

1. Subject only to the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Order and
to transfers to sales entirely within the ordinary course and

enclosed with the letter. By letter dated 20 May 2004, Cermak noted that bankruptcy
proceedings related to the assets of Moravan and Soska were ongoing, as were the
proceedings related to the Resolutions Claim. He indicated, inter alia, that the Ministry of
Justice would monitor the proceedings regarding the Resolutions Claim for speed and

fluency.'”°

In 2004, Claimant met with Pavel Vosalik, Ambassador of the Czech Republic to Canada,
who allegedly indicated to Claimant that he would look into Claimant’s case, but never
provided any information thereafter. Claimant also sought the assistance of other
diplomatic staff at the Czech Embassy in Ottawa and met with Stanislav Benes,
Commercial Counsellor, and Vladimir Bartl, Head of the Commercial and Economic

division (of the Embassy).'”!

Claimant wrote letters dated 27 February 2004 to the District Courts in Uherské Hradi&té

Courts terminate or interrupt all enforcements of judgments of third party creditors against
LZ and MA on the grounds that Claimant had an ongoing security interest and a first
secured charge on the assets of LZ and MA. The letters also enclosed a copy of the Interim

Award and the Promissory Note.'”

On 27 February 2004, Claimant also wrote to Mgr. Martin Bohaéek (“Bohdaéek”) the judge

encumber the assets of LZ.

Also on 27 February 2004, Claimant filed a motion at the Regional Court for appointment
of an interim receiver in respect of MA enclosing the Interim Award. Claimant also
requested that the Regional Court (i) enjoin all parties from any disposition of the assets of
MA, (ii) open proceedings on the nullity of sale contracts for assets of MA alienated in the
previous 6 months; and (iii) open proceedings on the nullity of any other acts that might

On 1 March 2004, Claimant delivered the Interim Award to the Cadastral Office in Uherské
Hradi&té with a request that the Cadastral Office “imprint a seal” in the real estate records
maintained by it in respect of LZ and MA so that all sale, mortgaging or encumbering of
the real property of the debtor would be banned. The Cadastral Office wrote to Claimant
on 11 March 2004 and 14 May 2004 to request additional specifications of the real property
in respect of which the registration was requested, and evidence that the Interim Award had
become final and enforceable. The Cadastral Office never received a response and so

returned the request to Claimant on 11 October 2004.'7

that the Interim Award was “binding and enforceable on the territory of Czech Republic” under the
New York Convention, that the arbitration was resolving the priority of satisfaction of Claimant’s
claims within the Promissory Note, and that the court was taking Claimant’s proposal “as an
initiation for the instalment of the Preliminary trustee”. The judge also noted that while Claimant
was not a part of the bankruptcy proceedings at that time, “the facts quoted by [Claimant were] very
serious.” Claimant’s Pre-Hearing Memorial, 71.

Between 15 June 2004 and 8 July 2004, the Police Commissioner conducted a further
investigation into the case arising from Claimant’s 10 December 2002 motion. This
investigation was ordered by the Chief State Prosecutor pursuant to a request from the

Ministry of Justice.'*?

On 18 June 2004, MA was declared bankrupt and Hajtmar was appointed as bankruptcy
trustee.'* As a result of the bankruptcy of MA, LZ was deprived of its rights over the LET

Assets (although it still retained their operational use).'™

When LZ and MA were declared bankrupt in March and June of 2004, Claimant requested
and was granted leave of the tribunal in the Stockholm Arbitration to continue the

arbitration proceedings against them on 3 June 2004 and 28 July 2004, respectively.'*

On 28 June 2004, Claimant applied for separate satisfaction in the bankruptcy proceedings
for MA."

MA, dated 18 June 2004 (Exhibit C-0089), which indicates that while the bankruptcy judge for MA,
Hanzlikova, referred to the Tora Group Petition, she refrained from investigating it because
substantiation of the facts underlying the Tora Group Petition would have exceeded the framework
of the bankruptcy proceedings.

In its reasons for granting Claimant’s motion to continue the Stockholm arbitration, the Stockholm
Tribunal noted that both Claimant and Respondent had relied upon Section 14(1)(c) of the Czech
Bankruptcy law when arguing the motion (but disagreed on how to interpret and apply that
provision). Notice of Arbitration, 454; Claimant’s Memorial, 13; Claimant’s Pre-Hearing

referred to Section 2(5) of the Arbitration Act of the Czech Republic (Act No. 216/1994 Coll., on
Arbitral Proceedings and Execution of Arbitral Awards (Czech Republic), as printed in International
Handbook on Commercial Arbitration, Supplement 60, July 2010 (publication forthcoming)

On 15 July 2004, the Police Commissioner who had been ordered to reopen the case arising
from Claimant’s motion of 10 December 2002 to initiate criminal prosecution of Soska and

Joachimezyk again dismissed Claimant’ s complaint.'*”

. On 19 July 2004, Claimant appealed the 15 July 2004 dismissal of its motion to initiate

criminal prosecution of Soska and Joachimcezyk. This appeal was dismissed on

18 August 2004 by the Office of the Regional Prosecutor for the following reasons:

The public prosecutor agrees with the police authority, stating that
the matter in hand is exclusively of a commercial-law nature and
that the criminal liability of the suspected persons cannot be
deduced in connection with the conduct described in the verdict
[...]. After assessing the above-mentioned circumstances, it can be
stated that the [USA] does not impose an obligation on [MA] to
transfer 49% of the shares in [LZ] to FPS free of charge. In a
situation where [MA] in accordance with the [USA], undertook to
repay the provided loan to FPS, including interest, such procedure
would appear to be illogical and completely commercially
disadvantageous for [MA]."*

. On 26 July 2004, Claimant applied for separate satisfaction in the bankruptcy proceedings

for LZ.'°

. Also on 26 July 2004, in response to a request from Claimant for information on the listing

of the LET Assets on the bankruptcy list of Moravan, Orbesova informed Claimant that she
was unable to provide the information due to the “complete lack of cooperation of the

statutory bodies of MA, a.s. and other subsidiaries of [Moravan]”.'*°

certificates for 49% of the shares of LZ to Burnet, Duckworth & Palmer LLP, which was
also acting as counsel for Claimant in the Stockholm Arbitration, in accordance with the

Final Award.“

By letters dated 28 February 2005, Claimant through Tutterova sent letters to JUDr.
Ludmila Hanzlikova, (“Hanzlikova”) and to Bohaéek, the judges overseeing the bankruptcy
proceedings of MA and LZ, respectively, at the Regional Court, requesting that they
exercise their authority and ensure that the Final Award be recognised, in particular, by the
bankruptcy trustee. Claimant also quoted the dispositif of the Final award, referred to
Article III of the New York Convention, and referred to the BIT.'? Claimant also wrote to
Hajtmar and Sladek, requesting with reference to the Final Award that they (i) pay
Claimant’s share of the costs of the Stockholm Arbitration and the damages awarded as
receivables claimed against the corresponding estate of MA or LZ; (ii) conclude contracts
of pledge for movable and immovable assets presently owned by MA; and (iii) submit an

accounting of the LET Assets.'”

On 22 March 2005, Claimant submitted the Final Award and an accompanying submission
to the Regional Court with respect to the Resolutions Claim, stating that the Final Award
showed (i) that it was already a 49% shareholder of LZ on the date of the LZ General
Meeting, and (ii) that the decisions adopted at the LZ General Meeting were not adopted as

required by law because Claimant’s shares were voted with by an unauthorised person.’

Claimant and LZ exchanged further submissions on the merits of the Resolutions Claim
between 22 March and 24 June 2005.'*

By letter dated 31 March 2005, Sladek informed Claimant that he refused to comply with
Claimant’s requests of 28 February 2005. He rejected Claimant’s receivable for a number
of reasons, including that the claim was based upon a legal relationship with MA, not LZ,

and that the Final Award contravened the public policy of the Czech Republic:

In [sic] Article V para (2) letter b) of the [New York Convention]
stipulates that the recognition (and enforcement) of a foreign arbitral
award shall be denied if the award would contravene public policy
of the country where the recognition (and enforcement) is supposed
to be executed. In terms of the subject arbitral award, I must state
that it indeed contradicts the public policy of the Czech Republic. I
see this contradiction in an apparent incompatibility with the Czech
mandatory legal regulations, in particular Act No. 328/1991 Coll.,
on bankruptcy and composition. Since bankruptcy proceedings
mean serious intervention in the legal status of a broad spectrum of
subjects, they are regulated by a [sic] strictly mandatory legislation
which must be unconditionally observed. [...] Since the Arbitral
Award fails to respect mandatory legislation regulating bankruptcy

and fund legal principles, it is le in
the Czech legal system. Therefore I cannot consider it in the
bankruptcy proceedings. (emphasis added)'**

147. On 7 April 2005, Mgr. Vladan Vala (“Wala”), legal advisor to Hajtmar, filed an action on

behalf of Hajtmar requesting that the Regional Court annul the Final Award in its entirety
on the basis of Section 31(a), (b) and (f) of the Arbitration Act,' alleging that it ordered
Hajtmar to “effect performance that is impossible or impermissible according to domestic
law”, and explaining that “in bankruptcy proceedings the bankruptcy trustee cannot be
ordered to secure a right for one of the creditors which would establish a more beneficial
position of this creditor as compared to the other bankruptcy creditors [and that] [s]uch
decision is in strict violation of the basic principles of the [Bankruptcy Act].” Vala also
noted that “once the bankruptcy order was adjudicated, the arbitral proceedings should have

been suspended”, with reference to Section 14(1)(c) of the Bankruptcy Act.'>

148. Similarly, by letter dated 8 April 2005, Vala advised Claimant that:

154

155

The Creditors Committee of [MA] discussed the Final Arbitral
Award issued by the Arbitral Tribunal on December 30, 2004. The
Creditors Committee concluded that this Final Award orders the
bankruptcy trustee _to_effect_performance_that_is impermissible
according to domestic law. Moreover, in our opinion the arbitration
proceeding should have been discontinued once the bankruptcy
adjudication order _was issued, since the Claimant’s alleged rights
should have been claimed in bankruptcy proceedings. Due to the
above, the Creditors Committee enjoined the bankruptcy trustee to
file an action requesting cancellation of the arbitral award. This
action was filed today. Since we request that the arbitral award be
cancelled in all its points, we are not willing at this time to

Section 31 of the Arbitration Act provides, in relevant part:
Upon a request by either party, the court shalll set aside an arbitral award if —

(a) it was rendered in a matter in which no arbitration agreement can be validly
concluded;

(b) the arbitration agreement is invalid for other reasons, or was cancelled, or does
not apply to the subject matter;

[ed

(f) the arbitral award requires a party to proceed with performance that was not
requested by the claimant or performance that is impossible or unlawful under
domestic law;

On 11 May 2005, a second review hearing was held at the Regional Court in respect of the
bankruptcy of MA, notice of which was published on the Regional Court’s Official Board
and in the Commercial Bulletin. Minutes from the meeting reflect that Claimant’s
receivable was not discussed and was transferred to the next review hearing “given the

seriousness of this case”.'”

On 17 May 2005, Claimant, through Tutterova, filed four motions with the Regional Court.
The first two motions requested that the Regional Court issue a resolution requiring (i) that
Hajtmar and Sladek each submit an accounting of the LET Assets pursuant to the Final
Award; (ii) that Hajtmar and Sladek each grant Claimant first secured charges against the
LET Assets pursuant to the Final Award; and (iii) that Hajtmar and Sladek cancel the
tender process over the assets of MA and LZ that they had jointly announced on or
sometime prior to 2 May 2005.'** The second two motions requested interim injunctions to
prevent Hajtmar and Sladek from disposing of the LET Assets until the Regional Court had

decided on the first two motions noted above.'”

On 19 May 2005, Hanzlikova denied Claimant’s motion for an interim injunction in respect
of the LET Assets in the bankruptcy estate of MA on the grounds that it was not necessary.
Hanzlikova explained that (i) the bankruptcy trustee needed court approval to realise any
sales of the objects, rights, or other assets used to run the company; (ii) that such court
approval had not yet been issued; and (iii) that the court would “carefully consider further

action in a way that the rights of either participant [would not] be violated”.'”

161

162

ow

the LET Assets in the bankruptcy estate of LZ. Bohaéek explained that court authorisation
was required for the monetisation of a bankruptcy estate through the sale of the bankrupt
party’s business. As no authorisation had been issued in this case, Bohdéek found that the
court had no grounds for ordering the interim injunction. Bohdéek also asserted that a
creditor’s charge based on the Final Award was unfounded under the New York Convention
because recognition and enforcement of an award should be denied “if the award is not

legally effective and enforceable pursuant to domestic law and the award would contravene

> 161

public policy’

On 1 June 2005, a meeting was held between Hanzlikova, Bohaéek, Sladek, Hajtmar, and
Vala, at the Regional Court. A legal opinion dated 25 May 2005 prepared by Vala (“Vala
Opinion”) was discussed at this meeting. The Vala Opinion expressed various views as to
why the Final Award and Claimant’s claim for a first secured charge over the LET Assets

should be rejected.' The Vala Opinion reads, in part:

According to the above-quoted Article V [New York Convention], a
Bankruptcy Trustee is entitled to raise his objections in a proceeding
against an application petition for recognition and enforcement of an
award. However, since the Creditor never initiated any such
proceeding (which is incomprehensible to the Bankruptcy Trustee, if
the Creditor believes that in the case of this Arbitral Award there are
no reasons why recognition and enforcement should be denied), then
the Bankruptcy Trustee clearly does not understand why, over a
period of more than 4 months, the Creditor was unable to file an
application for recognition and enforcement of the subject foreign
Arbitral Award.

[...] According to the Bankruptcy Trustee, the bankruptcy
adjudication has discontinued the arbitral proceeding. [...] [T]he
arbitral proceeding could not continue and that the receivables
would have had to be claimed in bankruptcy proceedings.

The Creditor did claim cash receivables, but unfortunately, he failed
to claim the secured charges pertaining to these receivables.
However, the Creditor did claim this right in the arbitration
proceeding, prior to claiming the receivables in this bankruptcy.

This means that it knew to claim the secured charges, which
generally afford the right to separate satisfaction.

The fact that the Arbitral Award ordered the Bankruptcy Trustee to
grant first secured charges to the Creditor is contrary to the
respective provisions of the Bankruptcy and Composition Act. It
fails to respect the equality of bankruptcy creditors to the extent that
after the bankruptcy adjudication, the Bankruptcy Trustee is not
entitled to perform acts aimed at securing receivables that arose
prior to the bankruptcy adjudication (i.e. receivables that must be
claimed). In this sense, the Arbitral Award is contrary to the public
policy of this country, which constitutes another reason why the
recognition and enforcement of the Arbitral Award must be rejected.

[...]

Until a decision is made with regard to the complaint requesting
nullification of the Arbitral Award or until the Creditor files an
application requesting recognition and enforcement of the subject
Arbitral Award and the respective decision is made, the Creditor is
not entitled to any secured charges against assets listed in the
bankruptcy estate.'°*

154. Minutes from the meeting recorded the following:

163

The Bankruptcy Trustee of [MA] filed a complaint with this court
requesting nullification of the [Final Award].

All parties present agree that the [Final Award] cannot be respected
in view of the provisions of § 39, letter b) and § 31, letter f) of Act
No. 216/1994 Coll. on bankruptcy proceedings and the enforcement
of arbitral awards, because it adjudicates the party to perform acts
that are impossible or illegal under domestic law and because,
according to Article V.2.B) and Decree No. 74/1959 Coll. on the
Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral
Awards, the recognition or enforcement of the Award would
contradict the public policy of the Czech Republic.

This means that in the course of the bankruptcy proceeding, the right
to separate satisfaction from the Bankrupt’s assets cannot be
established for a creditor and therefore the Bankruptcy Trustee can
neither conclude a contract of pledge to the benefit of the creditor
nor provide any other security for his receivable. Such approach
would be in gross violation of the Bankruptcy and Composition Act.
Apart from separate satisfaction based on a promissory note (see
above), the creditor did not claim any right to separate satisfaction in
either of the bankruptcy proceedings; therefore, such claim could

not have been reviewed in the review hearing and this creditor is not
a separate creditor.'*

155. On 2 June 2005, Hajtmar sent an e-mail to Sup reporting on the 1 June 2005 meeting, as

follows:

Yesterday there was a meeting at the court of Brno dealing with the
issue of allowing the sale of assets of MA/LZ in conjunction with
the application for injunction from the Frontier Company.

[...]

On this meeting was presented a legal opinion from MA side, the
analysis of present situation regarding to [Final Award] (and so the
answer to the courts prompt). From the analysis and the discussion
is clear that requested injunction against the assets has no ground.
And will be refused by both judges.

The sale of LZ was approved by the judge and sale of assets held by
MA will be approved also. Also MA facility in Otrokovice could be
prepared for sale as planned.

Also in discussion was a fact that steps taken by FPS, while taken to
protect their interest are not compatible with interest of remaining
creditors. (If FPS would be successful the rest of the creditors would
get nothing).

And so it is question for creditors of MA and specifically members
of Creditors Committee [sic][“CC”] if it is correct that FPS is a
member of CC. The question of removal FPS would be presented on
the next meeting of CC and it is preferable that members would
create their opinion about this.

Present situation is as follows; I am expecting delivery of the
inventory list from Leges specifically the assets Leges included first
(as per signed contract), based on that I will correct the inventory of
MA so all possible duplicity would be eliminated. This step has no
influence on ongoing process, on dividing of the proceedings from
the sale and which trustee would be selling what.'®

 

156. Also on 2 June 2005, the Regional Court denied Claimant’s 17 May 2005 motion for a

164

165

[...] an Award ordering the bankruptcy trustee to grant secured
charges against the bankrupt’s assets to the benefit of a creditor,
cannot be enforced because such act would contradict to the
Bankruptcy and Composition Act and as such it would be generally
illegal and in breach of the country’s public order.

On 6 June 2005, Claimant through Tutterova appealed Hanzlikova’s 19 May 2005 decision
denying Claimant’s motion for an interim injunction in respect of the LET Assets in the

bankruptcy estate of MA to the High Court in Olomouc.'”

By resolution dated 27 July
2005, the High Court in Olomouc rejected Claimant’s appeal, but observed that the
Regional Court had not addressed Claimant’s grounds for seeking an interim injunction in

its reasons, in particular Claimant’s submissions in respect of the Final Award.'*

On 6 June 2005, Claimant through Tutterova also appealed Bohdéek’s 23 May 2005
decision denying Claimant’s motion for an interim injunction in respect of the LET Assets
in the bankruptcy estate of LZ to the High Court of Olomouc.’ This appeal was rejected
on 4 August 2005.!”

On 9 June 2005, the Regional Court also denied Claimant’s 17 May 2005 motion for a
resolution cancelling the tender process and ordering Sladek to submit an accounting of
assets and grant a first secured charge to Claimant. In his reasons, Bohaéek stated that the
Final Award was contrary to the Bankruptcy Act and, in accordance with the Sections 31

and 39 of Arbitration Act could not be enforced.'7!

Final Award. The first motion was filed at the District Court in Uherské Hradisté and
requested that the court order execution of the Final Award against LZ. The second motion

Sladek appealed the 5 July 2005 order of the District Court of Uherské HradiSté to the
Regional Court, where the penalty was struck down and execution of the Final Award
pursuant to the District Court’s order was declared legally impermissible on 25 August
2006.' The enforcement was discontinued in its entirety by the District Court on
8 November 2006.'**

Also on 8 November 2006, the Regional Court recognised Claimant’s receivable with
respect to LZ on the basis of an acknowledgement of its existence by Sladek and on the

grounds of unjust enrichment and penalty interest in the amount of CZK 3,837,711.40.'*

By letter dated 23 November 2005, Sup submitted a complaint to the Prime Minister of the
Czech Republic, Jitf Paroubek, requesting the appointment of an authorised person to
review Claimant’s case, and indicating that unless financial compensation was provided,
the matter would become the subject of arbitration against the Czech Republic. By letter
dated 26 January 2006, JUDr. Petr PetrZilek of the Office of the Czech Government, Prime
Minister’s Expert Department, responded to Claimant, (i) explaining that the judge in
charge of the case had been on maternity leave; (ii) describing what steps were available to
Claimant to address the delay through the courts; and (iii) indicating that the Czech
government was not a party to the Stockholm Arbitration and therefore the Final Award

On 24 January 2006, a Joint Meeting of the creditors’ committees of Moravan and MA was
convened. Sup was present at this meeting and recorded Claimant’s disapproval of the sale
of MA. The Creditor’s Committees for MA and Moravan as well as Hajtmar and
Orbesova, agreed to proceed with the sale of MA to the sole interested party, Czech

Aircraft s.r.0.'*°

On 25 January 2006, the District Court in Zlin rejected Claimant’s motion requesting that
the court order execution of the Final Award against MA.'*” Claimant appealed to the
Regional Court, where the District Court in Zlin’s decision was upheld, in part, on
15 February 2007.'** The District Court’s decision was upheld to the extent that Claimant’s
request for an order of execution of the Final Award with regard to the obligation on the
bankruptcy trustees for MA and LZ to submit an accounting of the LET Assets and grant a
first secured charge in the LET Assets and other property of MA was denied. The Regional
Court modified the District Court’s decision with regard to (i) the obligation to pay interest
on the loan under the USA; (ii) the damages award in the amount of USD 600,000 for
Claimant’s lost business opportunity; (iii) the arbitration costs in the amount of USD
926,038.55; and (iv) Claimant’s share of the advance payments to cover the fees and costs
of the arbitrators in the amount of USD 245,124.53. On 28 May 2007, Claimant further

On | September 2006, Claimant notified Respondent of a dispute under the BIT. The
Parties engaged in consultations over the following year but were unable to arrive at an

amicable settlement.'*

On 28 November 2006, Claimant appealed the 8 November 2006 decision of the District
Court in Uherské Hradisté to discontinue execution of the Final Award to the Regional
Court."* On 30 March 2007, the Appellate Division of the Regional Court (“Appellate
Division”) upheld the parts of the Regional District Court’s decision that discontinued
execution of the orders under the Final Award directing the bankruptcy trustees of MA and
LZ to (i) provide Claimant with an accounting for the LET Assets, and (ii) grant Claimant
first secured charges against the LET Assets and all of the property of MA (in accordance
with the terms of the USA) (“Order on Security”). The Appellate Division struck down
parts of the Regional Court’s decision that discontinued execution of the monetary relief
claims, including (i) the obligation to pay interest on the loan under the USA, (ii) the
damages award in the amount of USD 600,000 for Claimant’s lost business opportunity,
(iii) the arbitration costs in the amount of USD 926,038.55, and (iii) Claimant’s share of the
advance payments to cover the fees and costs of the arbitrators in the amount of USD
245,124.53. The Appellate Division noted, however, that while there was no bar to the
issuance of an enforcement order, such order could not be executed during bankruptcy

proceedings. '

On 21 June 2007, Claimant appealed the 30 March 2007 decision of the Appellate Division
of the Regional Court, referring specifically to parts of that decision which upheld the
discontinuation of execution of the orders under the Final Award directing the bankruptcy
trustees of MA and LZ to (i) provide Claimant with an accounting for the LET Assets, and
(ii) grant Claimant first secured charges against the LET Assets and all of the property of
MA (in accordance with the terms of the USA). According to Respondent, as at 20 July
2009, this appeal was still pending.'”°

With respect to MA, on 28 May 2007, the Regional Court recognised Claimant’s receivable
in the amount of CZK 229,967,440.69 but rejected Claimant’s claim for separate
satisfaction. Hajtmar appeared but did not participate in the hearing. The Regional Court
agreed with Hajtmar’s decision to recognise Claimant’s receivable in the amount of CZK
229,967,440.69 but to reject Claimant’s request for separate satisfaction because security in
the form of a promissory note did not warrant separate satisfaction under the Bankruptcy
Act and because the assets for which separate satisfaction was claimed were not

specified.'””

By Notice of Arbitration dated 3 December 2007, Claimant commenced this arbitration

against Respondent pursuant to the BIT."

According to Claimant, the assets of MA were sold by the bankruptcy trustees for MA and
LZ to Czech Aircraft, s.r.0.'”

 

On 8 September 2008, the Regional Court terminated Hajtmar’s 7 April 2005 action to
annul the Final Award on the grounds that it had no jurisdiction to set aside a foreign

arbitral award.”

On 25 March 2009, Sladek confirmed that he had recognised Claimant’s receivable in the
full amount but classified it as a class 2 receivable without the right to separate satisfaction.
According to Claimant, this recognition is essentially pointless because the assets of LZ
were sold at considerably less than the value of the receivables.” By letter dated 28 April

2009, Sladek informed the Regional Court that he had recognised Claimant’s receivable.

In its Memorial, Claimant asserts that in mid-2009 a constitutional appellate court
vindicated Claimant’s position with respect to the 19 May 2005 and 23 May 2005
resolutions of the Regional Court denying its motions for interim injunctions in respect of
the LET Assets in the bankruptcy estates of MA and LZ.” Respondent notes that
Claimant has not provided a copy of or reference to this ruling and that it is unable to find

203

any basis for Claimant’s assertion. A copy of the constitutional appellate court’s

decision referred to by Claimant has not been submitted to the Tribunal.

Claimant’s Position

Claimant argues that Respondent is estopped from maintaining any objection to the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction on the basis that it (i) explicitly admitted the Tribunal’s jurisdiction
as recorded at paragraph 2 of Procedural Order No. 1: “it is agreed by the Respondent that
the Tribunal has the jurisdiction to hear and decide all the matters referred to arbitration by
the Claimant in its Notice of Arbitration dated 3 December 2007”; and (ii) failed to raise its
objections until long after it was permitted to do so pursuant to Article 21(3) of the
UNCITRAL Rules to the extent that Respondent’s Notice of Appointment of Arbitrator

constituted a statement of defence.”

Even if Respondent had not already explicitly admitted jurisdiction, Claimant asserts that it
would nonetheless be estopped from pursuing any of its jurisdictional objections because it

has waived any such right under applicable rules of international law by not bringing its

objections in a timely manner.”

Respondent's Position

Respondent contends that (i) Claimant's arguments regarding Respondent's alleged
acceptance of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction were first raised in its pre-hearing submissions and

are therefore out of time;””

(ii) from the documents relied on by Claimant, the Tribunal
cannot draw the inference that “a sovereign State would waive in advance of even seeing
Claimant’s pleading any jurisdictional objections in the future”;?'° and (iii) the Tribunal
joined Respondent's jurisdictional objections to the merits in paragraph 2.5 of Procedural
Order No. 5 after its objections were made; any conclusion that Respondent had waived its

jurisdictional objections would contradict that ruling of the Tribunal.”"'

Tribunal’s Analysis

It is helpful to recall the events and submissions relevant to the Parties’ dispute regarding

Respondent's alleged admission of jurisdiction and its jurisdictional objections.

Respondent received Claimant’s Notice of Arbitration on 13 December 2007 and on
14 January 2008 responded with its Notice of Appointment of Arbitrator. In it, Respondent
stated, inter alia, that “it [did] not consider the Notice of Arbitration a filing containing a
statement of claim pursuant to Article 3(4) letter c) of the UNCITRAL Rules of
Arbitration” and that it “[sought] the filing made hereby not to be considered a statement of
defence pursuant to Article 19 of the Rules.” Respondent also submitted that “it does not
believe that the ‘investment’ described in Claimant’s Notice of Arbitration represents an

9212

investment as defined in Article | letter a) of the Treaty.

In a letter to the Tribunal dated 4 July 2008, Respondent, in commenting on a draft version
of Procedural Order No. | that had been circulated to the Parties, reiterated its position that

Claimant had not filed a statement of claim and that its Notice of Appointment of Arbitrator

was not intended as a statement of defence in accordance with Article 19 of the
UNCITRAL Rules. In case the Tribunal considered Claimant’s Notice of Arbitration as a
statement of claim, Respondent requested that it be granted sufficient and reasonable time

to prepare a proper statement of defence.

By e-mail dated 22 July 2008, the Tribunal indicated to the Parties that it believed that the
Memorial and Counter-Memorials should contain at least all of the particulars that one
would usually find contained in statements of claim and defence, and that they could be
“regarded as a full statement of a party’s case [...]. [It] will usually draw attention to all
important aspects of law on which the party intends to rely, or upon which the opposing
party may be relying, and may often contain reasonably detailed submissions on the

application of relevant legal principles to the evidence and matters in issue.”

At paragraph 2 of Procedural Order No. | dated 26 September 2008, the Tribunal recorded
that “[iJt is agreed by the Respondent that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear and decide
all the matters referred to arbitration by the Claimant in its Notice of Arbitration dated

3 December 2007.”

On 4 February 2009, Procedural Order No. 4 was issued which contained a procedural
timetable for the written submissions of the Parties including Claimant’s Memorial and

Respondent’s Counter-Memorial.

On 16 May 2009, Claimant submitted its Memorial.

By letter dated 1 June 2009, Respondent advised that it had appointed new counsel, and on
20 July 2009 it submitted its Counter-Memorial in which it raised objections to the

jurisdiction of the Tribunal.?"?

On 7 August 2008, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 in which it joined
Respondent's jurisdictional objections to the merits to be decided in the Final Award, and

invited Claimant to address Respondent’s objections in its Reply.

Claimant did so, and also submitted that Respondent’s objections were made out of time
pursuant to Article 21(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules.” In its Pre-Hearing Memorial dated
25 September 2009, Claimant argued that Respondent had already admitted the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction as per paragraph 2 of Procedural Order No. 1,7'° and that “to the extent the
[Notice of Appointment of Arbitrator] constituted a statement of defence”, Respondent’s

jurisdictional arguments are out of time.

The Parties pleaded their cases on jurisdiction in all subsequent rounds of written

submissions and at the hearing.

The written submissions phase of this arbitration was designed such that the Parties’ first
opportunity to set forth their full claims and defences accompanied by factual evidence and
witness testimony was Claimant’s Memorial and Respondent’s Counter-Memorial
respectively. Respondent was never invited to file a statement of defence per se, and its
Notice of Appointment of Arbitrator was never deemed to be its statement of defence. As
such, Respondent’s Counter-Memorial was in effect the equivalent to what Article 19 of the

UNCITRAL Rules contemplates as the statement of defence.

It is true that, notwithstanding that Respondent appeared to raise a jurisdictional objection
in its Notice of Appointment of Arbitrator, it was later recorded in Procedural Order No. 1
that Respondent agreed that this Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear and decide all the matters
referred to arbitration by Claimant in its Notice of Arbitration. Be that as it may, and
bearing in mind that Respondent changed its legal representatives after Procedural Order

No. 1 was issued, it became clear from the earliest appropriate pleading in the procedural

timetable (ie. Respondent’s Counter-Memorial) that Respondent did have jurisdictional

objections.

At that time, the Tribunal did not consider that Respondent was precluded from raising
such objections by either paragraph 2 of Procedural Order No. | or Article 21(3) of the
UNCITRAL Rules, and allowed Respondent's jurisdictional objections to be included as

issues for determination in this arbitration pursuant to Article 21 of the UNCITRAL Rules.

The Tribunal also invited Claimant to respond to them, which Claimant did in all of its

subsequent submissions and at the hearing.

Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that Respondent raised its objections at the earliest
appropriate opportunity according to the procedural timetable established in this case under
the UNCITRAL Rules, and that Claimant cannot be said to have suffered prejudice as a
result of the timing of Respondent’s jurisdictional objections because it has had several

opportunities to plead its position both in writing and at the hearing.

Under Article 15(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules the Tribunal enjoys a broad discretion to
conduct the arbitration in such a manner as it considers appropriate, provided that the
Parties are treated with equality and that at any stage of the proceedings each Party is given
a full opportunity of presenting its case. It cannot be said that these two conditions are not

fulfilled here with respect to Respondent's jurisdictional objections.

Further, relevant commentary on Article 21(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides:

Although Article 21(3), taken alone, appears to place a mandatory
time limit on raising objections to jurisdiction, the drafters clearly
felt a tribunal in its discretion over procedure [Article 15(1)] or by
allowing amendments [Article 20] might permit such pleas to be
raised at a later date.”!°

In light of the foregoing, the Tribunal rejects Claimant’s argument that Respondent is
estopped from raising any objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction on the grounds that it
explicitly admitted that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the claim, and that it failed to

raise its objections in a timely manner under Article 21(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules.

With respect to S.D. Myers Fed. Cf'’ and CME,""* that Claimant has submitted as
support for its assertion that Respondent’s jurisdictional objections are untimely as a matter
of international law, the Tribunal considers that the factual matrix of these cases differ

significantly from the present case.

S.D. Myers Fed. Ct was a decision of the Federal Court of Canada denying Canada’s
application for judicial review of a series of awards. Canada referred to a general statement
in its statement of defence in which it denied the facts alleged in certain paragraphs of the
claimant’s statement of claim and put the claimant to the strict proof of every fact alleged

in those paragraphs.”"”

Canada argued that it had made a timely challenge to the
jurisdiction of the tribunal because a number of the paragraphs that it had referred to in the
statement of claim fell under the heading “Jurisdiction of the Tribunal”. The court ruled
that in accordance with Article 21(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules, an objection to jurisdiction
“must be raised clearly at the outset of the arbitration [and] Canada failed to do so in this
case.” This Tribunal finds that the pivotal issue in S.D. Myers Fed. Ct was whether
Canada’s jurisdictional objection was “raised clearly”, or, in the words of the court,
whether it was a “specific, express objection to jurisdiction”. In this case, the Tribunal
finds that Respondent’s jurisdictional objections have been “raised clearly” in its Counter-
Memorial, which represents its first opportunity to fully plead its case, and considers them

to be timely filed.

In CME,” the tribunal decided that, in accordance with Article 21(3) of the UNCITRAL
Rules, the respondent had waived its jurisdictional objection with respect to one of the
claimant’s investments by failing to raise it in its statement of defence. The tribunal
observed that given that the respondent had expressly raised other jurisdictional objections
in its statement of defence and not the later objection, the jurisdictional objection in
question was untimely.””' This case differs significantly because Respondent in the present
case fully argued all of its jurisdictional objections in its Counter-Memorial. In addition,
Respondent did not subsequently raise additional objections to those first raised in its

Counter-Memorial.

224

Has Arisen in Respect of a ‘Measure’
Respondent's Position

Respondent submits that Article IX of the BIT requires Claimant to establish that it has
made an investment in the Czech Republic, and that a dispute has arisen in respect of a
measure of the Czech Republic that has had an impact on the management, use, enjoyment
or disposal of that investment.” Respondent argues that the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione
materiae is limited to claims directly related to the host state’s interference with the
investor's bundle of ownership rights over the assets comprising the investment.’
Respondent asserts that Claimant has simply declared that its claims fall within Article
IN(1) without providing any analysis for such assertions,” and that it has failed to plead its

claims with anything like the precision required by the express terms of Article IX(1).”*

Respondent argues that what Claimant is asking the Tribunal to do is to ignore the express
terms of Article IX and replace them with the more common formulation of consent to
arbitration of the type “any dispute between an investor of one Contracting party and the
other Contracting Party in connection with an investment”.””° It is Respondent’s position
that there is no presumption in international law that obligations set out in a treaty must be

fully actionable before an arbitral tribunal.?””

Respondent contends that the only point made by Claimant in relation to the express terms
of Article IX is that “[w]hatever else Article IX may mean, it cannot be read so as to
diminish the protections promised to a Canadian investor under Articles II and III”;

Respondent argues that such an approach is incompatible with Article 31 of the VCLT.”*

With respect to Claimant’s “claim to money, in the form of the Final Award”,
Respondent submits that it could not have been part of Claimant’s investment until it came
into existence on 30 December 2004. Respondent questions how acts of the Czech
Republic before 30 December 2004 said to constitute a breach of the BIT impacted upon
Claimant’s management, use, enjoyment or disposal of Frontier’s claim to money in the

form of the Final Award.”*”

Respondent acknowledges that Claimant’s contribution of loan capital to LZ is capable of
constituting an investment under Article I of the BIT,”! but Respondent believes that
Claimant has been very careful not to characterise its investment as such because none of
its claims against the Czech Republic concern interference with this contribution of loan

capital.”

With respect to Claimant’s definition of its investment as set forth in its Pre-Hearing

Memorial, Respondent makes the following comments:

(i) With respect to Claimant’s alleged entitlements (a) “to a first secured charge over the
assets of LZ as security for its loan”; (b) “to acquire 49% of the shares of LZ for
nominal consideration”; and (c) “as a shareholder of LZ, to participate in the business
of the joint venture” these were asserted by Frontier under the USA and were the
subject of the private dispute between Claimant and LZ and MA over which the
Stockholm Tribunal had exclusive jurisdiction. Respondent submits that there is no
allegation in this arbitration that Respondent interfered in Claimant’s enforcement of
those aspects of the Final Award against MA and LZ.?** Nor is there any allegation
that the Czech Republic interfered with Claimant’s attempt to register a security

interest during the Stockholm Arbitration;™ and,

following the issuance of the Final Award (see infra section 8.3.4.).

oo

(ii) Concerning Claimant’s claim to (a) money in the form of the Final Award; and (b)
the “aircraft type certificates to be acquired by Frontier through the joint venture”,
Respondent submits that they are not the subject of any claim in these proceedings.
The claim to money in the Final Award has been recognised in the insolvency
proceedings related to MA and LZ, and the right to “aircraft type certificates” has

never been mentioned before in the context of any of Claimant’s claims.”*°

Respondent has not specifically contested whether the alleged acts or omissions of the

Czech Republic complained of fall within the meaning of the term “measure” and has

6

conceded that this term has been defined broadly.” Rather, Respondent argues that

Claimant has failed to identify measures which have “interfered with the management, use,
enjoyment, or disposal of [Claimant’s] investment”. Respondent submits that “whilst there
is probably jurisdiction in relation to some of the claims, there is certainly no causation on
99237

the basis of that provision in relation to a great number of the aspects of the investment.

In its closing statement at the hearing, Respondent submitted that:

[t]o be clear about the jurisdictional objections, it would be possible
to formulate claims based upon what happened, the money that was
spent in the Czech Republic, to be within this Tribunal’s
jurisdiction. Our jurisdictional objections have been designed to put
the Claimant to the discipline which it is obliged to be put to, to
plead its claims based upon the provision which gives this Tribunal
jurisdiction. It hasn’t done so, and it hasn’t done so because of the
way it would expose itself, as I had mentioned in the opening
submissions, to very obvious flaws in its causation arguments in
particular, but also in respect of other aspects of the Treaty which is
relied upon; in other words, the other obligations it’s relying
upon.”

Claimant’s Position

Claimant submits that the term “investment” found in Article I(a) of the BIT is satisfied in

this case, as follows:

(i) the payments made to MA and Davidova between 18 April 2001 and
14 August 2001 constitute an “asset held or invested” in the Czech aviation industry
in the Czech Republic;?”

(ii) _ the pledge in the USA whereby Claimant advanced the funds necessary to acquire the
LET Assets in exchange for a first secured charge constitutes an interest in
“moveable and immoveable property and any related property rights, such as
mortgages, liens or pledges”;

(iii) the agreement in the USA that after all of the LET Assets are transferred to LZ,
Claimant was to acquire 49% of the shares of LZ for nominal consideration
constitutes “shares, stock, bonds and debentures or any other form of participation in
a company, business enterprise or joint venture”;

(iv) Claimant’s claim to money in the form of the Final Award against both MA and LZ
constitutes “claims to money, and claims to performance under a contract having a
financial value”;

(v) _ the contract for the acquisition of the aircraft type certificates constitutes “intellectual
property rights, including rights with respect to copyrights, patents, trademarks as
well as trade names, industrial designs, good will, trade secrets and know-how”; and,

(vi) the agreement that both Claimant and MA as shareholders of LZ shall participate in
the business of LZ constitutes “rights, conferred by law or under contract, to

undertake any economic and commercial activity”."”

Article IX of the BIT provides that any dispute “between one Contracting Party and an
investor of the other Contracting Party relating to the effects of a measure taken by the
former Contracting Party on the management, use, enjoyment or disposal of an investment
made by the investor” that cannot be settled amicably shall be submitted to UNCITRAL

Rules arbitration.

Claimant submits that it has “made out a prima facie case demonstrating in considerable
detail how the myriad failings of the Czech legal regime, and of Czech officials, resulted in
the substantial deprivation of Claimant’s management, use, enjoyment and disposition of its
investments” and that the term “measure” refers broadly to any acts or omissions

attributable to a state party under an international trade or investment agreement.”

Claimant also asserts that, whatever else Article IX may mean, it cannot be read so as to
diminish the protections promised to a Canadian investor under Articles II and II of the

Bit.”

Claimant submits that the Tribunal should interpret the text of the BIT broadly, so as to

favour the protection of covered investments.“* Claimant contests Respondent's narrow

construction of Article IX as being inconsistent with the object and purpose of an

“management, use, enjoyment or disposal of an investment” should not be construed in
isolation from the standards the BIT accords to investors when Article 31 of the VCLT
requires these terms to be construed in context, taking into account how these standards are

fulfilled.“

Claimant contends that by arguing that only the loan Claimant made under the USA is
capable of being defined as an investment, Respondent is relying upon the outcome
suffered by Claimant as a result of Respondent’s failure to properly protect its investment
such that Claimant could not realise the fruits of its investment.“* Claimant argues that
Respondent has already admitted that Claimant is a protected “investor” and made a
protected “investment” under the BIT at paragraph 4 of its Notice of Appointment of

Arbitrator.”

Tribunal’s Analysis

There is little doubt that the term “measure” generally encompasses both actions and
omissions of a state in international law. The JLC Articles provide that an internationally
wrongful act of a state may arise by “conduct consisting of an action or omission.” The
Commentary to the ILC Articles explains that “[c]ases in which the international
responsibility of a State has been invoked on the basis of an omission are at least as
numerous as those based on positive acts, and no difference in principle exists between the

two”. The Commentary to the ILC Articles also sets out that “it may be difficult to isolate
an “omission” from the surrounding circumstances which are relevant to the determination
of responsibility” and that, in certain cases, it may be the combination of an action and an
omission which is the basis for responsibility.”“*

249)

In the Fisheries Case (Canada v. Spain), the ICJ upheld the proposition that “in its

ordinary sense the word [“measure”] is wide enough to cover any act, step or proceeding,

and imposes no particular limit on their material content or on the aim pursued thereby.”?*”

In Eureko v. Poland,*' the tribunal ruled that the term “measure” in a BIT provision

similar to the one before this Tribunal’** encompassed both actions and omissions by the
respondent state. The tribunal stated that “[i]t is obvious that the rights of an investor can

be violated as such by the failure of a Contracting State to act as by its actions”, referring to

similar findings by numerous other international arbitral tribunals.” Claimant also asserts
that the award in Saipem v. Bangladesh demonstrates how the failure of a state to ensure
that an international arbitration award is recognised and enforced may be characterised as a

“measure” subject to that state’s obligations under a BIT.”

Claimant argues that Oil Fields of Texas Inc. v. NIOC supports the proposition that various
judicial acts may be properly characterised as “measures affecting property rights”.?*°
However, the Oil Fields case specifically addressed the question of whether a judicial
decision could amount to a “measure of appropriation”. The tribunal in Oil Fields noted
that it took into account that it was impossible for Claimant to challenge the judicial
decision in question in Iran, and held that the order in question — issued by an Iranian court

— amounted to a permanent deprivation of Claimant's rights.

The claims asserted by Claimant in this case are, in broad terms,”” based upon (i) the
alleged failure of the Regional Court to respond to Claimant’s application to invalidate the
LZ Resolutions; (ii) the allegedly flawed decision-making process of the bankruptcy
judges; (iii) the alleged failure of various Czech officials to exercise their authority to
remedy the treatment being received by Claimant, and to assist it in preserving its
investment (referring specifically to the handling of the criminal complaint, the commercial
registry complaint, and the failure of the Ministry of Industry and Trade through the CKA
to enter into negotiations with Soska); and (iv) the failure of Respondent’s legal system to

comply with Respondent’s international obligations under the New York Convention to

maintain an effective means for enforcement of an international tribunal’s orders and

awards.

In light of the generally accepted rule that the ordinary meaning of the term “measure”
includes acts and omissions, it appears that there would be no difficulty in construing the
acts and omissions that form the basis of Claimant’s claims as “measures”. This is not

contested by Respondent.

Respondent does contest whether Claimant has satisfactorily established that this dispute
relates to the effects of a measure taken by Respondent on the management, use,
enjoyment, or disposal of an investment made by Claimant. Respondent's position is that
Claimant has not been able to identify measures taken by the Czech Republic that have
interfered with the management, use, enjoyment, or disposal of Claimant’s investment
under each and every one of its claims. Respondent sets out specifically in which instances
it believes Claimant has failed to establish such a connection (see supra paragraphs 216-
217). Claimant for its part, argues that “[i]t is abundantly clear [...] that the dispute
between the parties concerns an accumulation of acts of omission committed by the
Respondent that have permanently impaired Frontier’s ability to manage, use, enjoy or
dispose of its investment in the Czech Republic (from exercising its right to participate in
the joint venture to having its property interests in the LET Assets enforced). [...] While
under the control and direction of Soska, MA and LZ fundamentally breached the terms of
the USA [...]. It was the failings of the Czech legal regime, however, which prevented
Frontier from protecting its investment when it became apparent that its erstwhile joint
venture partner was acting fraudulently.”?**

The Tribunal considers that Claimant has stated in sufficiently clear terms what it alleges to
constitute measures taken by Respondent and what comprises its investment in the Czech
Republic. The question is then whether there exists the requisite nexus between the two to
establish the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione materiae under Article IX. Respondent
acknowledges that there is one “measure” taken by Respondent that may have a
conceivable connection to Claimant’s investment: “Claimant says that the Czech Republic
interfered with its entitlement to a first secured charge when the Czech courts declined to

register the security interest over LZ’s assets following the Final Award. [...] Save for [this

»

claim], none of the Claimant’s other claims have any conceivable connection to its

investment as belatedly described in its Pre-Hearing Submission.”?”

This Tribunal accepts that Claimant’s original investment consisted of the payments made
to MA and Davidova between 18 April 2001 and 14 August 2001, which were transformed
into an entitlement to a first secured charge in the Final Award. The Tribunal also notes
that Article 1(a) of the BIT provides that “[a]ny change in the form of an investment does
not affect its character as an investment”. Accordingly, by refusing to recognise and
enforce the Final Award in its entirety, the Tribunal accepts that Respondent could be said
to have affected the management, use, enjoyment, or disposal by Claimant of what
remained of its original investment. Further, Article IX refers to “a measure” in the
singular, such that this Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione materiae may be established over this
dispute if Claimant shows that it relates to the effects of at least one measure taken by

Respondent on the management, use, enjoyment, or disposal of its investment.

The issues that Respondent has raised under this jurisdictional objection overlap to a
significant extent with the merits of Claimant’s claims, particularly concerning questions of
attribution and causation. Respondent appears to acknowledge this as its argument that all
but one of Claimant’s claims have no conceivable connection to its investment is made
under the heading “The Significance of the Claimant’s Description of its Investment for the

+9 260

Merits of its Claims”. Accordingly, the Tribunal will address the issues raised in this

section as part of the merits, to the extent necessary.

In view of its findings in paragraphs 230 and 231 that an investment was made by Claimant
and that a dispute arose in respect of a measure it follows that Respondent’s jurisdictional
objections have not been established. The Tribunal therefore concludes that it has

jurisdiction to hear Claimant’s claims.

8.1.3 Article II(1) of the BIT — Existence of Enforceable Obligations Relating to Promotion

261

of Investment
Claimant’s Position

Claimant asserts that Article II(1) of the BIT imposes a positive obligation upon the Czech
Republic with respect to the establishment of favourable conditions for Canadian investors
to make investments in its territory, and, together with Article III(1), should be construed as
imposing an ongoing obligation upon the Czech Republic to ensure that it has taken the
necessary steps to create and maintain favourable investment conditions.”*' It is Claimant’s
position that this “obligation subsists on the part of the Host State, post-establishment,
because the investor relied upon the continuing promise of the Host State to maintain

favourable conditions when making the decision to establish its investment.”

Claimant further submits that if the Parties had actually intended for admission and

establishment measures to be excluded from the application of the BIT, or from dispute

3

settlement under the BIT, they would have expressly said so.” Claimant considers that

there is no indication in Article IX that a claim cannot be brought in respect of the host
state’s failure to honour its obligations under Article II(1), so long as the impugned

measure was neither a decision taken by a host state pursuant to a new, non-discriminatory

establishment measure, nor the measure itself.?*

At a minimum, Claimant argues, “favourable conditions” for foreign investment include (i)
a local court system in which criminal complaints are addressed fairly and efficaciously and
emergency petitions for relief do not languish before the courts for years before the
provision of a belated answer; (ii) a transparent, up-to-date and reliable local registry
system, both for corporate affairs and registration and for property registration; (iii)
bankruptcy trustees conducting themselves in accordance with accepted professional norms
and applicable international law; and (iv) a promise that the orders and awards of
international arbitral tribunals will be respected and enforced in compliance with a Party’s
international obligations, such as those included in the New York Convention. Claimant
asserts that each of these conditions make up the framework of a transparent, stable, and
secure investment environment, which is exactly what was promised to Claimant by
Respondent, through its agents, officials, and its promotional materials, when Claimant was
considering whether to invest in the Czech aircraft industry. Claimant asserts that it relied
upon the existence of such commitments and made its decision to invest with sufficient
prudence, after having been involved with Soska and MA in their original joint venture
with MA and addressing risks inherent in dealing with a local partner by including a

suitable arbitration clause in the USA.“

Claimant has stated its position with respect to how its claims under Article II of the BIT
relate to its claims under Article III of the BIT over the course of these proceedings as

follows:

In its Reply Memorial, Claimant submits that:

The two standards [referring to full protection and security and fair
and equitable treatment] are far from being mutually exclusive;
indeed, they can often overlap considerably. Similarly, as indicated
by Claimant in its Memorial, the protection contained within Article
IIl:1 of the Treaty need not serve as a basis for establishing an
independent breach (especially not in the circumstances of the
instant case). While the Claimant disagrees that this provision can
never be enforced against a Treaty party, in this case the primary
function of the provision is essentially to reinforce the scope and
content of the fair and equitable treatment standard.”

. Claimant also submits that “[w]ithin the context of this case, it was the obligation to

provide full protection and security which was supposed to have ensured that the
favourable conditions for investment that the Respondent was obliged to maintain, under

Article II:1, were indeed maintained.”””

In its Pre-Hearing Memorial, Claimant sets forth examples of “favourable conditions” that
it alleges that Respondent failed to provide in violation of Article II(1), which it repeats in

its Post-Hearing Memorial (see supra paragraph 236).”°*

In its opening submissions at the hearing, Claimant stated that “[t]he first protection we
have referred to in our submissions has been Article II(1) [...]. We say simply that it is
consistent with the preamble and other protections in Article III. They probably overlap.
We make no great to do about invoking Article II(1), although we say emphatically that
Article II(1) does extend a specific form of protection to investors: the creation of
favourable conditions.” In its closing statement at the hearing, Claimant did not discuss

Article II(1).

In its Post-Hearing Memorial, Claimant states that Article (1) of the Treaty can be
regarded as reinforcing — if not broadening — the scope of the fair and equitable treatment

standard owed by Respondent to Frontier.””

In its Reply to Respondent’s Post-Hearing Memorial, Claimant submits that “Canadian
investors are entitled to expect that all Czech officials involved in this case exercise their
delegated discretion in a manner consistent with these standards [referring to full protection
and security and fair and equitable treatment] as part and parcel of the promise of these
standards and of the favourable conditions for investment promised under Article II(1) of

the Treaty.

Respondent's Position

Respondent asserts that the obligations under Article II(1) are related to the admission of
investments and are not obligations of result that would be enforceable against the
Contracting Parties, and that this is made “abundantly clear” by the language of Articles
II(2) and (3). Respondent notes that Article IX defines the scope of the jurisdiction ratione

materiae of the Tribunal in terms of measures impacting upon existing investments, rather

 

than claims relating to the admission of investments. Therefore, Respondent submits, any

claim founded upon Article II(1) of the BIT is manifestly outside the jurisdiction of the

Tribunal.””

Respondent also notes that Claimant has clarified that its claim rests on two
grounds, one arising from the obligation to provide full protection and security and the
other arising from the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment, and that therefore
it is difficult to comprehend the relevance of Article II to the claims submitted by

Claimant.”

Tribunal’s Analysis

Articles II(1) and (2) refer to the admission of investments and Article II(3) refers to the
enactment of laws in connection with the establishment or acquisition of a business
enterprise. Article III outlines the protections that apply to investments that have already
been established. The jurisdiction ratione materiae of this Tribunal as defined by Article
IX(1) of the BIT refers to established investments, i.e. “an investment made by the
investor”. In light of this text, the Tribunal concludes that Article II(1) does not create an
obligation with respect to existing investments that would be enforceable against the
Contracting Parties. The wording of Article IX(1) — “an investment made by the investor”

— makes this clear.

In any event, the Tribunal considers that it is not necessary to determine whether Article II
of the BIT creates an enforceable obligation in light of the fact that Claimant does not
appear to raise independent claims under that provision. Claimant’s comment at paragraph
37 of its Reply Memorial is of note, i.e. that “the protection contained within Article II:1 of

the Treaty need not serve as a basis for establishing an independent breach (especially not

Operation of Most-Favoured Nation Provision
Claimant’s Position

Claimant submits that, should the Tribunal conclude that it lacks jurisdiction on the basis of
any of Respondent's objections, it should find that Claimant is entitled to benefit from the
broader terminology found in the dispute settlement provision of Article VI(1) of the Treaty
Between the Czech Republic and the United States of America for the Reciprocal
Encouragement and Protection of Investment (“US-Czech Republic BIT’) by operation of
the most-favoured nation (“MFN”) provision at Article III(2) and (3) of the BIT, as limited
by Article IV.2" Article VI of the US-Czech Republic BIT provides, in part:
1. For purposes of this Article, an investment dispute is a dispute
between a Party and a national or company of the other Party
arising out of or relating to (a) an investment agreement
between that Party and such national or company; (b) an
investment authorization granted by that Party’s foreign
investment authority to such national or company; or (c) an

alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty
with respect to an investment.

Respondent's Position

Respondent argues that its offer of consent to arbitration is contained in Article IX of the
BIT and the arbitration agreement between Respondent and Claimant was perfected upon
Claimant’s filing of its Notice of Arbitration on 3 December 2007. Respondent asserts that
Claimant cannot seek to modify the terms of the arbitration agreement unilaterally by

recourse to the MEN clause of the BIT.”

Further, Respondent contends that even if Claimant could rely on the MEN clause, the
terms of Article III(2) indicate that it cannot be invoked in respect of jurisdictional matters,
i.e. the treatment of investments in the Contracting Party’s territory cannot, in accordance
with the ordinary meaning of those terms pursuant to Article 31 of the VCLT,?”° encompass
matters relating to the jurisdiction of an international tribunal established under Article IX
of the BIT. Respondent notes that when contracting state parties wish to include

jurisdictional matters within the scope of an MEN clause, they do so expressly.7”

Respondent also submits that Claimant’s MFN arguments are made out of time; Claimant
could have articulated this basis for jurisdiction in its Notice of Arbitration and in its

Memorial, but did not do so.”

Finally, Respondent argues that Claimant’s reliance on the MFN clause of the BIT does not
rectify Claimant’s failure to identify the specific assets that are said to constitute an
investment pursuant to Article I(a) of the BIT and to demonstrate that acts attributable to

the Czech Republic have impaired those assets by reference to a demonstrable loss.””

Tribunal’s Analysis

Given that the Tribunal has not found its jurisdiction to be lacking on the basis of
Respondent’s objections, the Tribunal does not find it necessary to make a determination
with respect to the Parties’ arguments regarding the operation of the MEN provisions in

Articles I[[(2) and (3) of the BIT.
MERITS - INTERPRETATION OF THE BIT PROVISIONS

In assessing the Parties’ arguments on the interpretation of the relevant BIT provisions as

well as Claimant’s treaty violation claims, this Tribunal’s task is limited to applying the

23 May 1969, 1155 U.N.T.S. 331 (cited in Respondent’s Rejoinder Memorial, 124).

Respondent refers to Articles 3(3) and 8 of the United Kingdom Model BIT as an example of such

relevant provisions of the BIT as far as necessary in order to decide on the relief sought by

the Parties.

Article III(1) — Full Protection and Security
Claimant’s Position

Claimant submits that the obligation of full protection and security requires a host state to
maintain a regulatory and commercial framework that ensures full protection and security
for foreign investments at all cost. Claimant asserts that prima facie evidence of a host
state’s failure to provide full protection and security is manifested in the fact of insufficient

government action, combined with contemporaneous loss or damage to the investor’s

ability to manage, use, enjoy, or dispose of its investment.”*°

Claimant rejects Respondent’s argument that it is only obliged to provide police protection
on the ground that according to the BIT, Respondent is obliged to provide “full protection
and security” in accordance with principles of international law which is in no way
restricted to customary international law. Claimant notes that there is authority for its

position that full protection and security extends beyond protection from physical

1

violence.*! According to Claimant, the host state’s obligation is one of due diligence,

requiring its constant vigilance in ensuring that the regulatory and commercial legal

protections it has put in place function efficiently and effectively.” Failure to establish or

maintain such reasonable measures of protection can be justified on rare occasions, but only
on the basis of a pressing and reasonable public policy objective.** While this duty should
not be extended to become a de facto “all risks” insurance policy for investors, Claimant
also argues that it should not be confined to situations involving “a violent mob or

insurrection”.”**

Claimant asserts that pursuant to this obligation under the BIT, Respondent should have
ensured that its legal and political institutions operated as well as they had been advertised
as operating. As such, Respondent was obliged to maintain (i) a working registry system;
(ii) courts capable of providing urgent relief to a defrauded shareholder; (iii) police
inspectors prepared to fully and finally investigate allegations of commercial fraud, even
when made by a foreigner against a local businessman; and (iv) bankruptcy judges who do
not prejudge issues while partaking in ex parte communications with parties adverse in
interest to the primary (foreign) creditor’.** Claimant relies upon Lauder v. Czech
Republic for the proposition that the obligation to accord full protection and security to an
investment extends to the host state’s ability to furnish the investor with an effective and
efficient judicial system thereby enabling the investor to obtain a timely and proficient

adjudication of its rights, in keeping with international standards.”*°

law. At the same time, the clause on full protection and security is unusual in that it
contemplates protecting investment against private as well as public action, that is, the
clause requires that the host country should exercise reasonable care to protect
investment against injury by private parties.’ [...] It is inconsequential whether the
damage is caused by a member of the State forces or by a private party. In either case,
the State has a ‘primary obligation’ to exercise due diligence to provide adequate
protection. The State’s failure to comply with this objective obligation due to the mere
lack of diligence is sufficient, without any need to establish malice or negligence.

Respondent's Position

Respondent rejects Claimant’s assertion that the host state’s obligation is one of due
diligence, requiring its constant vigilance to ensure that the regulatory framework and
commercial legal protections it has put in place for the benefit of a foreign investor function
efficiently and effectively, noting that no tribunal has ever adopted this interpretation.”*’
Respondent also objects to the assertion that it is under an obligation to ensure that a
regulatory and commercial framework to ensure full protection and security for foreign
investments is maintained at all cost, noting the subjectivity of the level of protection and

security that might be expected by a particular investor.”

Respondent explains that the vast majority of investment treaty awards have limited the
obligation of full protection and security to ensuring the physical safety of the investment
property and personnel in the host state consistent with the resources available to the host
state, which Respondent notes is in line with the historical development of the standard in
customary international law.” Respondent asserts that it is only in this context that it is
correct to characterise the obligation as one of due diligence.’ While it is clear that this
obligation extends to third parties (in so far as states have an obligation of due diligence to

protect property and personnel from the violent acts of mobs or armed militias),

a host state in its particular circumstances. In practice, tribunals will likely consider the
state’s level of development and stability as relevant circumstance in determining
whether there has been due diligence. An investor investing in an area with endemic
civil strife and poor governance cannot have the same expectation of physical security
as one investing in London, New York or Tokyo.

Respondent contends that it cannot properly be said to extend to “other non violent acts by
third parties, such as commercial acts of the private business partners of the foreign

investor.”””!

Respondent contends that even if on the basis of Lauder, “full protection and security”
could be extended to the host state’s judicial system to allow assessment of its effectiveness
by reference to international standards, the decisions of the Czech Supreme Court and
Constitutional Court not to enforce the Order on Security in the Final Award is consistent
with the major legal systems of the world and with the Council of Ministers of the

292

European Union regulation on insolvency proceedings (“EC Regulation”).

Tribunal’s Analysis

Most bilateral or multilateral treaties dealing with the protection of investments contain
clauses with the same or similar wording as the full protection and security clause in Article
IN(1) of the BIT. Some omit the adjective “full”, others put “security” before
“protection” and some refer to “most constant protection and security”, but these variations

do not appear to carry any substantive significance.“

The wording of these full protection and security clauses suggests that the host state is

under an obligation to take active measures to protect the investment from adverse effects

5

that stem from private parties or from the host state and its organs.” The mere fact,

however, that the investor lost its investment is insufficient to demonstrate a breach of full

protection and security.

It is not disputed that the standard of full protection and security relates to the investor’s
physical safety, nor is it particularly relevant to the circumstances of this case.° In a
number of cases tribunals have suggested that the standard of full protection and security
applies exclusively or preponderantly to physical security and to the host state's duty to
protect the investor against violence directed at persons and property stemming from state

organs or private parties.”” For example, in Saluka, the Tribunal said:

The “full protection and security” standard applies essentially when
the foreign investment has been affected by civil strife and physical
violence. [...] [T]he “full security and protection” clause is not
meant to cover just any kind of impairment of an investor's
investment, but to protect more specifically the physical integrity of
an investment against interference by use of force.”*

But, there are also authorities which show that the principle of full protection and security

extends beyond protection against physical violence to legal protection for the investor.”

300

Contrary to Respondent’s assertions,” it is apparent that the duty of protection and security

extends to providing a legal framework that offers legal protection to investors — including
both substantive provisions to protect investments and appropriate procedures that enable

investors to vindicate their rights.

In the ELSI case™” before the ICJ, a treaty guarantee of “the most constant protection and
security” was applied to a complaint concerning the time taken (16 months) for a decision
on an appeal against an order requisitioning the factory at issue. While the ICJ’s Chamber

rejected the argument on factual grounds,”

this decision indicates that “protection and
security” is not restricted to physical protection but extends to legal protection through

domestic courts.

CME and Lauder both indicate that the principle of protection and security is relevant to the
protection of legal rights including the availability of a judicial system that protects the
investor’s interests. The tribunal in CME applied the full protection and security clause of a
BIT between the Czech Republic and the Netherlands and observed that:

The host State is obligated to ensure that neither by amendment of

its laws nor by actions of its administrative bodies is the agreed and

approved security and protection of the foreign investor’s
investment withdrawn or devalued."

pot

Similarly, in Lauder™ the tribunal found that:

The investment treaty created no duty of due diligence on the part of
the Czech Republic to intervene in the dispute between the two
companies over the nature of their legal relationships. The
Respondent’s only duty under the Treaty was to keep its judicial
system available for the Claimant and any entities he controls to
bring their claims[.°”

In Siemens*®

the tribunal derived additional authority for the proposition that “full
protection and security” extends beyond physical security from the fact that the applicable
BIT’s definition of investment applied also to intangible assets:

As a general matter and based on the definition of investment, which

includes tangible and intangible assets, the Tribunal considers that

the obligation to provide full protection and security is wider than

“physical” protection and security. It is difficult to understand how
the physical security of an intangible asset would be achieved.*””

On the basis of the wording of Article III(1) of the BIT, “full protection and security” and
general international law appear as two discrete standards. By contrast, the fair and
equitable treatment clause of Article III(1) is supplemented by the words “in accordance
with principles of international law”. Whatever the exact meaning of this reference, the
fact that it does not qualify the full protection and security standard is an argument against

the latter standard being regarded as equivalent to customary international law.

There is broad agreement that the obligation to provide protection and security does not

create an obligation of result or absolute liability, as noted in the ELST case:**

The reference [...] to the provision of “constant protection and
security” cannot be construed as the giving of a warranty that
property shall never in any circumstances be occupied or
disturbed.°”

Rather, as noted by Claimant,*"°

the standard is one of “due diligence”:

[T]he standard provides a general obligation for the host State to
exercise due diligence in the protection of foreign investment as
opposed to creating “strict liability’ which would render a host State
liable for any destruction of the investment even if caused by
persons whose acts could not be attributed to the State.*""

Siemens, supra note 281, 303. This trend was confirmed in Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd. v.
United Republic of Tanzania, ICSID Case No. ARB/0S/22, Award of 24 July 2008, {729 (Exhibit R-

need to, among other things, establish the state’s responsibility for not acting with due diligence. See
also TECMED, infra note 316, {177, in which the tribunal states that the guarantee of full protection
is not absolute and does not impose strict liability upon the state that grants it.

In Pantechniki, the tribunal applied a modified objective standard of due diligence in a
situation of public violence. It found that liability in a situation involving civil strife

depended on the host state’s resources.”

However, there are no authorities which indicate
that other situations, not involving violence, would warrant the application of a relative

standard.

The tribunal in Parkerings analysed the host state’s duty under the full protection and
security standard to make its judicial system available in the following terms:

The Respondent’s duty under the Treaty was, first, to keep its

judicial system available for the Claimant to bring its contractual

claims and, second, that the claims would be properly examined in

accordance with domestic and international law by an impartial and

fair court. There is no evidence — not even an allegation — that the
Respondent has violated this obligation.

The Claimant had the opportunity to raise the violation of the
Agreement and to ask for reparation before the Lithuanian Courts.
The Claimant failed to show that it was prevented to do so. As a
result, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that the Respondent did not
violate its obligation of protection and security under Article III of
the BIT.”

In this Tribunal’s view, where the acts of the host state’s judiciary are at stake, “full
protection and security” means that the state is under an obligation to make a functioning
system of courts and legal remedies available to the investor. On the other hand, not every
failure to obtain redress is a violation of the principle of full protection and security. Even
a decision that in the eyes of an outside observer, such as an international tribunal, is
“wrong” would not automatically lead to state responsibility as long as the courts have
acted in good faith and have reached decisions that are reasonably tenable. In particular,
the fact that protection could have been more effective, procedurally or substantively, does

not automatically mean that the full protection and security standard has been violated.

8.2.2 Articles II(1) and III(1) - Creation of Favourable Conditions and Fair and Equitable
Treatment

Claimant’s Position

274. As set forth above (see supra paragraphs 234-243), it is Claimant’s position that Article
II(1) can be regarded as reinforcing, if not broadening, the scope of the fair and equitable
treatment standard.*"* Claimant asserts that two fundamental obligations arise from the
application of Articles II(1) and III(1) to the facts of the present dispute: first, Respondent
must encourage the creation of favourable conditions for investment and honour any
legitimate expectation generated thereby; second, Respondent must exercise due diligence

in maintaining a transparent, stable and predictable investment climate.*'*

275. Claimant asserts that from the fair and equitable treatment standard flows a duty of fidelity
to the principle of good faith, which requires a state to ensure that its officials are
exercising their authority in a reasonable and fair-minded manner that is neither arbitrary
nor unjust.*'® Claimant asserts that there is consensus about the entitlement of a foreign
investor to hold a legitimate expectation that the state, in promoting investment, is prepared
to take reasonable steps to ensure that its officials exercise any discretion delegated to them
in good faith and in a reasonable and fair-minded manner. Claimant disagrees with
Respondent's position that it is unreasonable for an investor to form legitimate expectations
based solely on the promises made by a state by way of international agreement and that

such expectations may only be made upon specific assurances provided by state officials.*!”

276. Claimant argues that accordingly, it held legitimate expectations in 2001 and 2002 that

“favourable conditions” existed for it and its investments, including an effective and

internationally competitive legal regime.*"*

Claimant specifies that “it was entitled to
expect that the means existed for its reasonable requests for assistance (such as a serious
investigation of its criminal fraud complaints or good faith review of the interim measures
of protection it was never able to effectuate)”, and “that its requests and petitions would be
considered in a manner consistent with both the standards of fairness and protection set out
in the BIT, but also with general principles of international law, such as the principle of
good faith, and with other principles of international law, as required under Article III(1)
{of the BIT]”.*”

Claimant also advances that, as a signatory to the New York Convention, Respondent holds
itself out to foreign investors and traders as essentially being a “fully paid member” of the
modern regime for international arbitration whose business and regulatory climate are

. woe 30
conducive to successful foreign investment.*””

Claimant rejects Respondent’s position that the reference to “principles of international
law” in Article II[(1) refers only to customary international law. Claimant submits that the
sensible approach is to accord these words their plain and ordinary meaning in context, and
in light of the liberalising object and purpose of the BIT. Thus, Claimant concludes that
international arbitral law and practice, and the general principle of good faith, should be

. 3
considered.*”"

However, regardless of whether fair and equitable treatment is owed as a
matter of customary international law, or as part of an autonomous treaty standard,
Claimant argues that fair dealing, reasonableness, and fidelity are always “part and parcel”
of the good faith exercise of public authority owed by all states to foreign investors under

the fair and equitable treatment standard.*”

Claimant asserts that the fact that Respondent agreed in Article II(1) to ensure that such favourable
conditions would be maintained only added to the detriment that greeted the investor when its
reliance proved to be misplaced. Claimant’s Reply Memorial, {55.

Respondent's Position

Respondent posits that while Claimant has set out what it considers to be the content of

Articles II(1) and TI(1),

*°3 it has not explained how specific acts attributable to the Czech

Republic have breached those Articles and caused an injury to Claimant’s investment.‘
While Respondent acknowledges that the standards of the BIT can operate to protect
legitimate expectations founded upon the host state’s contractual commitments to the
investor, or other forms of binding promises recognised by the host state’s administrative
law, those standards cannot be invoked as the source of the legitimate expectations.
Respondent argues that Claimant disregards the high threshold for a finding of liability on
the basis of the obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment and pleads its claim on the
basis that any acts of state not meeting its own approval must be condemned as violations

legitimate expectations including observation of “fundamental standards [like] good faith, due
process, and non-discrimination”. Claimant notes that the Saluka tribunal also drew a sharp
distinction between an autonomous standard of fair and equitable treatment, such as Article III of the
BIT, and a standard whose terms refer explicitly to customary international law, such as NAFTA
Article 1105.

The obligations of the host State towards foreign investors derive from the terms of the
applicable investment treaty and not from any set of expectations investors may have
or claim to have. A tribunal which sought to generate from such expectations a set of
rights different from those contained in or enforceable under the BIT might well
exceed its powers, and if the difference were material might do so manifestly.

and

[T]he general threshold for finding a violation of the standard [...] is a high one, As
stated by the tribunal in Waste Management v. Mexico (No. 2): ‘[...] the minimum
standard of treatment of fair and equitable treatment is infringed by conduct
attributable to the State and harmful to the claimant if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly
unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant to sectional
or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which
offends judicial propriety-as might be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice
in judicial proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and candour in an
administrative process. In applying this standard it is relevant that the treatment is in
breach of representations made by the host State which were reasonably relied on by
the claimant.’ [...] [I]n Thunderbird v. Mexico [the Tribunal] held that: ‘acts that
would give rise to a breach of the minimum standard of treatment prescribed by the

281.

conduct that may generate a reasonable legitimate expectation as applied within the fair and
equitable treatment standard, which Respondent notes is consistent with comparative
jurisprudence on legitimate expectations in national and supranational legal systems:

[I]n order to evaluate the relevance of [the concept of reasonable

legitimate expectations] applied within Fair and Equitable Treatment

standard and whether a breach has occurred, relevant factors
include:

i) the specificity of the undertaking allegedly relied upon [...]
which is mostly absent here, considering moreover that political
statements have the least legal value, regrettably but notoriously so;

ii) general legislative statements engender reduced expectations,
especially with competent major international investors in a context
where the political risk is high. Their enactment is by nature subject
to subsequent modification, and possibly to withdrawal and
cancellation, within the limits of respect of fundamental human
rights and jus cogens;

iii) unilateral modification of contractual undertakings by
governments, notably when issued in conformity with a legislative
framework and aimed at obtaining financial resources from
investors deserve clearly more scrutiny, in the light of the context,
reasons, effects, since they generate as a rule legal rights and
therefore expectations of compliance[. pe

According to Respondent, Claimant provides little evidence of concrete expectations that
were generated by the acts or omissions of state officials in the Czech Republic;
Respondent submits that this is because there were none. Respondent explains that
Claimant had no contractual relationship with any state agent or entity and no state agent or
entity made a representation to Claimant upon which Claimant subsequently relied.
Respondent asserts that the closest Claimant comes to articulating the basis for its
expectations is the assertion in its Memorial that Jewitt perused the general promotional
literature on the Czech Republic as a place to do business. This alone, Respondent argues,

could never generate legitimate expectations capable of founding a cause of action based

NAFTA and customary international law [...] amount to a gross denial of justice or
manifest arbitrariness falling below acceptable international standards.

evidential basis for any such expectation has been discredited as Claimant did not even
produce the documents it purported to rely upon and, moreover, Jewitt testified that he had
no specific knowledge of the arbitration regime in the Czech Republic when he signed the

usa.

Respondent argues that the source of Claimant’s alleged expectations is not even akin to
legislation of general prescription which, unlike the general promotional literature on the
Czech Republic, contains norms that are binding. Respondent also notes that the principles
articulated by the tribunal in Continental are entirely consistent with comparative
jurisprudence on legitimate expectations in national and supranational legal systems.
Respondent also notes that the European Court of Justice has held that the state’s conduct
must amount to a “precise assurance”.*” Thus, Respondent concludes that Claimant’s case

on the frustration of legitimate expectations must fail.*”

Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal has already noted that Article II of the BIT does not create an enforceable
obligation and, in any event, is of little import as Claimant does not raise independent
claims under it.*' In addition, the Tribunal considers that there is no basis in the text of the
BIT to conclude that Article II(1) broadens the fair and equitable treatment clause of Article

md).

By examining arbitral practice and attempting to recognise typical situations to which the

concept of fair and equitable treatment has been applied by tribunals, it is possible to

identify some concrete principles.** The typical situations most relevant to the present
case are (i) protection of the investor’s legitimate expectations; (ii) procedural propriety and

due process; and (iii) action in good faith.

° Protection of the Investor’s Legitimate Expectations

The protection of the investor’s legitimate expectations is closely related to the concepts of
transparency and stability. Transparency means that the legal framework for the investor’s
operations is readily apparent and that any decisions of the host state affecting the investor
can be traced to that legal framework. Stability means that the investor’s legitimate
expectations based on this legal framework and on any undertakings and representations
made explicitly or implicitly by the host state will be protected. The investor may rely on
that legal framework as well as on representations and undertakings made by the host state
including those in legislation, treaties, decrees, licenses, and contracts. Consequently, an
arbitrary reversal of such undertakings will constitute a violation of fair and equitable
treatment. While the host state is entitled to determine its legal and economic order, the
investor also has a legitimate expectation in the system’s stability to facilitate rational

planning and decision making.

There are numerous examples of the protection of legitimate expectations in investment

333

cases. For example, in Metalclad v. Mexico” the investor was assured that it had all the

construction and operating permits it needed for its landfill project, but the municipality
refused to grant a construction permit. The Tribunal held that the investor was entitled to
rely on the representations of the federal officials and that the acts of the state and the
municipality were in violation of fair and equitable treatment under Article 1105 of

NAFTA.

Tribunals have stated consistently that protected expectations must rest on the conditions as
they exist at the time of the investment.** They have pointed out that a foreign investor has
to make its business decisions and shape its expectations on the basis of the law and the
factual situation prevailing in the country as it stands at the time of the investment. For

example, in TECMED,

expectations must be examined for each stage at which a decisive step is taken towards the

. . ae “ 3
creation, expansion, development, or reorganisation of the investment."

It follows from the above that any legitimate expectations, in order to be protected by the
fair and equitable treatment standard, must have existed at the time the investment was
made. Expectations created after that date, especially in the course of seeking remedies,
would not be covered by the notion of legitimate expectations as developed in the context

of the fair and equitable treatment standard.

¢ Procedural Propriety and Due Process

The Tribunal observes that in a number of cases, tribunals have held that an absence of fair
procedure or a finding of serious procedural shortcomings was an important element for a

[T]he mini standard of of fair and equitabl

is infringed by conduct attributable to the State and harmful to the
claimant if the conduct [...] involves a lack of due process leading to
an outcome which offends judicial propriety—as might be the case
with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a
complete lack of transparency and candour in an administrative
process.

 

In Petrobart v. Kyrgyz Republic, interference by the state in court proceedings was found to

violate the standard of fair and equitable treatment.**

In Thunderbird v. Mexico the tribunal held that the standards of due process and procedural
fairness applicable in administrative proceedings are lower than in a judicial process.
However, the tribunal found no violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard
because the claimant had been given a full opportunity to be heard and to present evidence

345

and that the proceedings were subject to a judicial review by the courts.“ However, in

other cases, serious administrative negligence and inconsistency,*° and denial of access to
a file in an administrative appeals process“”’ have been found to breach fair and equitable
treatment. While these situations are typically procedural in nature, the tribunal in Rumeli
ruled that where a court decision is so patently arbitrary, unjust or idiosyncratic that it

demonstrates bad faith, the fair and equitable treatment standard can be breached. M8

The fair and equitable treatment standard has been found on several occasions to

encompass the notion of a denial of justice which, in turn, implies the requirement to

No breach of fair and equitable treatment was found because the investor did have access to the
courts and because experts had confirmed that the courts were independent and levels of corruption
had declined significantly.

exhaust local remedies. In Jan de Nul,”

the claimants had complained about an excessive
duration of proceedings before the courts of Egypt, which lasted nearly ten years. The
tribunal said:

[...] there is no doubt that ten years to obtain a first instance

judgment is a long period of time. However, the Tribunal is mindful

that the issues were complex and highly technical, that two cases

were involved, that the parties were especially productive in terms

of submissions and filed extensive expert reports. For these reasons,

it concludes that, while the duration of the proceedings leading to

the Ismailia Judgment is certainly unsatisfactory in terms of efficient

administration of justice, it does not rise to the level of a denial of

eri 350

justice.

With respect to substantive denial of justice, the tribunal in Jan de Nul found that there was
no indication of any discrimination, bias or malicious application of the law based on
sectional prejudice.**!

352

In Toto,” the claimant sought to base its claim for violation of the fair and equitable

treatment standard on the slow progress of proceedings before the respondent’s Conseil

d’Etat since the proceedings had not progressed over six years.***

After examining the
practice under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (“ICCPR”), the
tribunal identified several factors that needed to be assessed when determining a denial of
justice claim, namely the complexity of the matter, the need for celerity of decision and the

diligence of claimant in prosecuting its case.**

This Tribunal notes that nearly all of the decisions dealing with procedural propriety and
due process in the context of fair and equitable treatment have concerned proceedings

involving disputes with the host state or with state entities. This may suggest that

complaints about lack of due process in disputes with private parties are better dealt with in
the context of the full protection and security standard. As noted above in paragraph 263,
full protection and security obliges the host state to provide a legal framework that grants
security and protects the investment against adverse action by private persons as well as
state organs, whereas fair and equitable treatment consists mainly of an obligation on the

host state’s part to desist from behaviour that is unfair and inequitable.

¢ Action in Good Faith

Good faith is a broad principle that is one of the foundations of international law and has

been confirmed as being inherent in fair and equitable treatment.**

In Saluka, the tribunal gave a central role to the requirement of good faith in its description

of fair and equitable treatment. The tribunal said:

A foreign investor protected by the Treaty may in any case properly
expect that the Czech Republic implements its policies bona fide by
conduct that is, as far as it affects the investors’ investment,
reasonably justifiable by public policies and that such conduct does
not ifestly violate the i of i 'y, transp y,
even-handedness and non-discrimination.*°°

 

Specifically, the tribunal found that the host state’s refusal to negotiate in good faith to

resolve the problem constituted a violation of the fair and equitable treatment guarantee.*””

Bad faith action by the host state includes the use of legal instruments for purposes other
than those for which they were created. It also includes a conspiracy by state organs to
inflict damage upon or to defeat the investment, the termination of the investment for

reasons other than the one put forth by the government,** and expulsion of an investment

See Genin and others v. Estonia, 1CSID Case No. ARB/99/2, Award of 25 June 2001, $367: “Acts
that would violate this minimum standard [of fair and equitable treatment] would include [...]
subjective bad faith.” See also TECMED, supra note 316, 1153, relying on I. Brownlie, PRINCIPLES
OF PUBLIC INTERNATIONAL LAW 19 (1989).

based on local favouritism.*” Reliance by a government on its internal structures to excuse

non-compliance with contractual obligations would also be contrary to good faith.

It follows from these authorities that action by the host state that is not in good faith is at
variance with the fair and equitable treatment promise. However, not every violation of the

standard of fair and equitable treatment requires bad faith. The fair and equitable treatment

standard may be violated, even if no mala fides is involved.*°

MERITS - CLAIMANT’S TREATY VIOLATION CLAIMS

Claimant asserts that the Czech Republic has violated its obligations under Articles I(1)

and III(1) of the BIT in the following ways:

(1) The Regional Court in Brno inexplicably took more than three
years to respond to Claimant’s application to invalidate the
decision that served to solidify Soska’s illegal control of LZ in
September 2002 and ongoing breaches of the USA;

(2) The bankruptcy judges for both MA and LZ jointly partook in a
fundamentally flawed decision-making process that both
deprived the Investor of any chance of rescuing LZ and the LET
Assets and its right to benefit from its position as a secured
creditor in both bankruptcies once the judges had permitted the
liquidation to be commenced;

 

(3) Czech officials could have exercised their authority to remedy
the treatment being received by Claimant but consistently failed
to do so; and

(4) Because Respondent’s legal system was manifestly inadequate
for the tasks required of it under applicable international law, it
failed to comply with Respondent’s international obligation to
maintain an effective means for the enforcement of an
international tribunal’s orders and award.**!

In its final submission to the Tribunal, Claimant set out the following as the key questions

for the Tribunal’s determination:

(a) whether the lack of transparency and ineffective operation of
Respondent’s Commercial Registry, coupled with the deficient
operation of its bankruptcy regime, fell below the standards
promised in Articles II or III of the Treaty;

(b) whether the LZ joint venture could have been protected in a
timely and effective manner if Claimant had received:

(i) access to an investment protection regime, whose operation
was consistent with the promise of full protection and
security; and

(ii) the assistance of the Czech state, once it offered its
assurance to use its position as the largest potential creditor
of Moravan to negotiate with Soska;

(c

whether the Czech bankruptcy trustees and bankruptcy judges
were required to exercise their discretion under the Czech
bankruptcy code and applicable law in a manner consistent with
the standard of fair and equitable treatment, the principle of
good faith, and otherwise in accord with the Czech state’s
international obligations.*”

Respondent asserts that by the end of its submissions, Claimant abandoned the formulation
described above (see supra paragraph 302), but never sought to amend its claims as
presented in its Memorial with reference to Article 20 of the UNCITRAL Rules.
Respondent submits that, in the event that Claimant seeks to amend the formulation of its
claims, Respondent reserves its right to request that the Tribunal decline to grant leave to
do so having regard to the delay and prejudice that would be caused to Respondent in

accordance with Article 20 of the UNCITRAL Rules.*”

Tribunal’s Comment

The Tribunal notes Respondent’s comments concerning the different formulation of
Claimant’s claims in its last submission. The Tribunal does not find that Claimant has
actually varied its claims, but rather has just expressed them in a different way. In the
Tribunal’s view, Claimant’s rephrasing of its claims does not justify an application to

amend.

Claimant’s Position

Claimant asserts that the 39-month time period during which the Regional Court failed to
determine Claimant’s Resolutions Claim breached international standards. Claimant
characterises the Regional Court’s failure to act as a denial of justice prohibited under the
customary international law minimum standard of treatment, which it asserts is also
encapsulated within the more substantively expansive and autonomous standard of “fair

and equitable treatment” under Article I[[(1) of the BIT’®

Claimant argues that the
Regional Court’s failure to act is also prohibited under the customary international law
version of the fair and equitable treatment standard which Claimant observes both Parties

agree is informed by the doctrine of denial of justice.*

Claimant notes that Respondent is a Party to the European Convention for the Protection of
Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (“ECHR”), Article 6(1) of which specifies that
states must ensure that all persons receive fair, transparent, and expeditious access to a
court. Claimant submits that this right, particularly when the nature of the dispute is urgent,

also stands as an obligation required under the minimum standard of treatment under

67

customary international law.*” Claimant argues that by operation of Articles III(3) and

III(4) of the BIT, Respondent was obliged to afford it the most favourable treatment it
otherwise would be obliged to provide to its own investors or to the investors of third

parties; thus, Claimant argues, it is entitled to the same right to expeditious proceedings

later reversed on appeal) provided a proper basis for invoking section 31(a) in relation to Soska,
Joachimezyk, and Stefinek. Claimant’ s Post-Hearing Memorial, 441.

Claimant’s Memorial, (73): “[Investors’ protection by the ‘fair and equitable treatment’ standard is
meant to be a guarantee providing a positive incentive for foreign investors. Consequently, in order
to violate the standard, it may be sufficient that States’ conduct displays a relatively lower degree of
inappropriateness.”

before a court in the Czech Republic as are those legal persons entitled to such treatment
368

under the ECHR.

Claimant denies that it took no steps to accelerate the court proceedings, explaining that it
contacted members of parliament with respect to the delays. Claimant argues that there
was no excuse for Czech government officials to do nothing to help Claimant when alerted

370

to this delay.

Claimant rejects Respondent’s suggestion that it contributed to the delay by failing to pay a
court fee and seeking a postponement of the court proceedings pending the Final Award.
Claimant notes that if a court fee is not paid when a motion is filed, the court is required by
the Court Fees Act to request payment,’”' and the Regional Court did not request payment
until 26 May 2004, following which the fee was paid immediately.” Claimant also states
that its request of 23 December 2004 for suspension of the proceedings in light of the
imminent release of the Final Award caused virtually no delay; following translation and
certification, the Final Award was filed with the Regional Court on 22 March 2005, a full

year before the Regional Court’s final decision.*”*

Claimant rejects Respondent’s characterisation of its claim as a “denial of justice” claim,
explaining that its claim has been framed in terms of breach of the fair and equitable
treatment standard and breach of the duty of full protection and security. Claimant also
asserts that Respondent cannot point to any authority for the proposition that claims under

autonomous treaty standards can be effectively “down-converted” to customary

international law claims on the sole basis of a theory of denial of justice.” Claimant notes
that the tribunal in Saipem determined that a claim for substantial impairment of an
investment need not be treated as a denial of justice case simply because judicial officials

were responsible for the offending measure.*”°

In response to Respondent’s argument that Claimant has failed to show that the delays
caused its loss, Claimant explains that if the Resolutions had been enjoined or annulled by
the Regional Court, Soska, Joachimezyk, and Stefanek could not have continued to control
LZ, and instead Orbes, as trustee for Moravan, would have been entitled to assume control
of MA and LZ and commence fulfilment of the USA pursuant to the Draft Cooperation
Agreement.*” Claimant also argues (i) that the Commercial Register should have
immediately terminated the offices of Soska, Stefanek, and Joachimezyk when Soska
submitted the WIMCO Resolutions by concluding that these Resolutions did not confirm
their election or appointment in accordance with Section 31(a)(6) of the Commercial Code;
and (ii) that if the putative transfer of all of MA’s shares to WIMCO had been disclosed by
the Commercial Register, either Claimant or Orbes could have legally challenged that
submission.*” Claimant disputes Respondent's assertion that Soska and his cohorts would
have ensured their reappointment even if the Resolutions Claim had been successful,
arguing that this overlooks the probability that any involvement by WIMCO was

unlawful.’

In response to Respondent’s allegation that Claimant misled Czech authorities by making
contradictory statements about the LZ share certificates in three different legal fora,

Claimant argues that it simply did what any sensible investor would have done.*”

Respondent's Position

Respondent asserts that Claimant’s claim with respect to court delays rests upon a
misrepresentation of the procedure before the Regional Court. Respondent argues that
there was a delay attributable to the Czech Republic of no more than 18 months at a time
when the responsible judge was on maternity leave during which Claimant (i) took no steps
to accelerate the proceedings as it was entitled to under Czech law; (ii) did not
communicate with the court; (iii) requested postponement of the proceedings pending the
Final Award; and (iv) did not pay the requisite court fee, which resulted in a delay of

A . «i 3k
issuance of the court’s decision.”

Respondent also asserts that the notion that an 18-month delay in court proceedings might
constitute a denial of justice in international law and rise to the level of a breach of Article
III of the BIT is “preposterous”; there would be few, if any, legal systems in the world that
would satisfy this unrealistic standard. Moreover, Respondent contends that the inaction of

Claimant during this period is fatal to its claim."

Respondent refers to a ruling of the English High Court concerning delay in the Czech
courts, which acknowledged that “delay may be so great as to amount to a denial of

substantial justice [and] breach of Art.6 of [the ECHR]”, but concluded that a five or six

year delay does not mean that substantial justice cannot be obtained.***

most that one can affirm with confidence is that the injurious delay must be abnormal or abusive,
and that the responsibility of the State can not be said to be engaged merely by the fact that the time

of the precedents analysed in Freeman’s text relate to criminal proceedings and notes the decisions
of El Oro Mining (British Mexican Claims Commission), cited in Freeman, supra, 259 (cited in

Respondent argues that Claimant has not provided the Tribunal with an objective test for
when judicial acts satisfy the threshold for a breach of the fair and equitable standard of
treatment or the standard of full protection and security. Without this, Respondent asserts,
adjudication of this claim would become a wholly subjective exercise and the Tribunal

would be wrongfully deciding the matter ex aequo et bono."

Respondent concludes
therefore that the cases dealing with denial of justice and forum non conveniens are
essential to the determination of whether there has been a breach of the international

standard encapsulated in Article II( ) 384

Respondent further asserts that international tribunals with jurisdiction to review the
decisions of national courts on the ground of procedural irregularity have, without

exception, insisted upon a high threshold for a breach of the international standard.**°

Respondent distinguishes Saipem as concerning the illegality of judicial interference with
an ICC arbitration. Respondent asserts that the tribunal correctly adapted the test for
liability under the relevant investment protection standards to account for the judicial nature
of the impugned acts by mirroring the high threshold for the international censure of

judicial acts found in cases of denial of justice.*°

Respondent submits that the conduct of Claimant over the relevant period is significant for

a denial of justice claim.*’ Respondent asserts that Claimant could have accelerated the

Court and, if not satisfied, to the Ministry of Justice or to the appellate court with a request
for the setting of a mandatory timetable for the case.*** Respondent maintains that although
Claimant’s failure to initially pay the fee did not cause substantial delays in the proceeding,

it was symptomatic of Claimant’s failure to prosecute its Resolutions Claim properly.**”

With regard to Claimant’s assertion that it used available legal remedies by lobbying
members of parliament,” Respondent submits that it would have been “outrageous” for the
Czech parliament to interfere with the Regional Court because the Czech Constitution is
based upon the separation of powers and the rule of law.”' Moreover, Respondent
observes that Claimant’s complaint to the Prime Minister occurred on 23 November 2005,

i.e. some three years after the Resolutions Claim was commenced.*””

Respondent also submits that Claimant has failed to establish a causal connection between
the alleged denial of justice before the Regional Court and the downfall of its investment.*”*
Respondent posits that even if the Regional Court had ruled immediately in Claimant’s

favour, it would have made no difference to the “fortunes of [Claimant’s] investment in

 

criminal cases, or whether they were directly traceable to the alien’s own laches in
civil proceedings.

LZ’. Respondent argues that all that Claimant could achieve with a decision in its favour
was the right to request the convening of a general meeting of LZ and exercising of its
minority shareholder rights at such meeting which could not assure a successful

restructuring of LZ.*°*

Respondent notes that there is no evidence for Claimant’s claim that Orbes would have
been willing to “commence fulfilment of the USA” and that, in any event, the absence of a
court decision about the resolutions was irrelevant for the actions which Claimant expected
him to take.” Moreover, according to Respondent, Orbes contemporaneously took steps

that directly contradicted the Draft Cooperation Agreement.*””

Respondent also argues that, if anything, it was a different resolution adopted at the LZ
General Meeting which confirmed Soska, Joachimezyk, and Stefanek as members of the
board of directors of LZ that could have been seen as perpetuating their membership on the
board of directors of LZ.** Respondent notes that Claimant did not contest this resolution

within the statutory deadline set so it became legally valid.*”

Respondent observes that Claimant appears to give little importance to this claim in its
Post-Hearing Memorial,’ which Respondent attributes to Jewitt’s admission under cross-
examination that he had pursued a course of conduct that was premised on the simultaneous
validity of Claimant’s share certificates in LZ (before the Regional Court) and their forgery

“° Claimant’s

that Claimant thus deliberately misled the Czech courts and the police.
positive statements of fact in three different judicial fora that are in direct contradiction of
each other and are therefore known to be false, Respondent argues, is reason enough for

this claim to be dismissed.“

Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal notes that while Claimant initially appeared to formulate this claim as a denial
of justice claim as well as a claim for breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard
under the BIT, it later clarified that this is a claim for breach of the fair and equitable
treatment and full protection and security protections under the BIT.“ This Tribunal will
analyse Claimant’s claims as they have been formulated by Claimant, i.e. as alleged

breaches of the BIT.

The Tribunal examines as a first matter the timing of the Injunctions and Resolutions
Claims before the Regional Court. There is some disagreement with regard to the filing
date of the Resolutions and Injunctions Claim with Claimant alleging that it filed these
claims on 22 November 2002 and Respondent alleging that Claimant filed these claims on
3 December 2002. The Regional Court rendered a decision on the Injunctions Claim on
4 December 2002. Given the Regional Court’s promptness here, the Tribunal does not
accept that Claimant has any basis to argue that the Regional Court was delayed with
respect to the Injunctions Claim. The Tribunal rejects Claimant’s claims in this regard and

turns now only to assess its claims vis-a-vis the Resolution Claims.

With regard to the Resolutions Claim, the first action by the Regional Court occurred on
5 May 2004, approximately 18 months after Claimant’s filing. The parties exchanged
submissions between June 2004 and June 2005, and a hearing was held on
27 February 2006 at which the Regional Court granted Claimant’s request (i) confirming
that Claimant was a shareholder in LZ and thus entitled to file a motion; (ii) finding that
the Resolutions were invalid; and (iii) ordering that the Resolutions not be entered in the
Commercial Register.” The Tribunal notes that there were delays in these proceedings —
notably the 18-month delay following Claimant’s initial filing — that could form the basis
of a complaint by Claimant. Whether such delays rise to the level of breaches of the BIT is

a different question that the Tribunal will turn to now.

As already discussed (see supra paragraphs 289 et seq.), the Tribunal is satisfied that
procedural propriety and due process are well-established principles under the standard of
fair and equitable treatment.“ In assessing whether the delays at the Regional Court were
such that they constituted a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard, the Tribunal

409)

finds the criteria set forth in Toto” useful:

To assess whether court delays are in breach of the requirement of a
fair hearing, the ICCPR Commission takes into account the
complexity of the matter, whether the Claimants availed themselves
of the possibilities of accelerating the proceedings, and whether the
Claimants suffered from the delay.""”

First, the Tribunal considers that the matters before the Regional Court were not unusually
complex. With respect to the Resolutions Claim, only three submissions were made prior
to the hearing (two by Claimant and one by LZ). The hearing itself only lasted
approximately one hour with the court declaring its decision within minutes of Claimant’s

aL

closing argument. The relatively short reasons provided at page 4 of the Regional

Court’s resolution of 27 February 2006 emphasises the fact that the court did not treat this

matter as if it were unusually complex.*””

In light of these considerations, the Tribunal
does not consider that the complexity of the claims was such that it justified protracted
proceedings. The fact that the Regional Court proceedings took over three years from
beginning to end to deal with what were ultimately not extraordinarily complex claims does
not, without more, satisfy this Tribunal that a breach of the fair and equitable treatment

standard occurred.

Second, with regard to the issue of whether Claimant availed itself of the possibilities of
accelerating the proceedings, the Tribunal finds that the evidence suggests that it did not.
The Tribunal does not find the fact that Claimant requested the suspension of these
proceedings to be dispositive of this issue because Claimant had legitimate reasons for
doing so. However, the Tribunal does find that there is no evidence that Claimant tried to
accelerate its claim in accordance with Czech law and court practice. Claimant’s counsel
confirmed at the hearing in this arbitration that there is nothing on the record to indicate
that Claimant contacted the Regional Court to inquire as to the status of the action during
the relevant period.‘'* Claimant also failed to pay the court fee at its earliest opportunity
and needed to be reminded to do so. It is difficult for this Tribunal to reconcile Claimant’s
assertion that it considered these proceedings to be urgent with its conduct at the actual

time which does not evidence that.

Third, it is not clear how Claimant suffered from this delay. While Claimant asserts that
the matter was urgent, it has not established to the Tribunal’s satisfaction that earlier action
on the part of the Regional Court would have made any difference to the purported effect of
the Resolutions on Claimant’s investment. As noted by Respondent, it is far from certain
that, had the Resolutions Claim been successful at an earlier stage, (i) Soska et al would not
have been able to control LZ; and (ii) Orbes (as trustee for Moravan which, according to
Claimant, remained the sole shareholder of MA at the time) could have stepped in to
control MA and LZ and fulfil the terms of MA’s agreement with Claimant. The Tribunal

finds that Claimant has failed to establish that Orbes would have taken control of MA if the

Resolution of Regional Court, dated 27 February 2006 (Exhibit C-0114).

Memorial, 89.

Commercial Register had terminated the offices of Soska, Stefanek, and Joachimezyk when

Soska submitted the WIMCO Resolutions.*"*

. The subject matter of the Resolutions Claims included a determination of the validity of

two resolutions that purported to (i) change the Articles of Association of LZ (approving an
increase of the number of the members of the board of directors of LZ from 3 to 5); and, (ii)
establish a CZK 298,000,000 capital increase to be effected through a monetary
contribution of Claimant. Even if the Regional Court had immediately declared these two
resolutions invalid, it would not have meant that Soska would not still have been able to
control LZ because these resolutions did not affect the ownership of shares of LZ. Under
the USA, Claimant had agreed to be a minority shareholder in LZ in which Mr. Soska was

to retain majority shareholder control.

. Nor would it have meant that Orbes would have taken control of MA and LZ and fulfilled

the terms of the USA. The unsigned Draft Cooperation Agreement between Claimant and
LEGES (prepared by Claimant) anticipated that LEGES, as the bankruptcy trustee of
Moravan, would (i) change the board of directors of MA; (ii) change the board of directors
of LZ; and, (iii) fulfil the terms of the USA.> There is no evidence to show that LEGES
ever agreed to this, and in fact the Draft Cooperation Agreement was never signed
(notwithstanding that there was nothing to prevent LEGES from signing it during the
pendency of the Resolutions Claims). By contrast, rather than sign the Draft Cooperation
Agreement, in December 2002, LEGES included all of the LET Assets in the bankruptcy
estate of Moravan of which LEGES was the trustee (see supra paragraph 91). By including
all of the assets held in the subsidiaries of Moravan into Moravan’s bankruptcy estate, it set
out to assert ownership rights of Moravan to these assets; this action was in contradiction to

what Claimant would have had LEGES do pursuant to the Draft Cooperation Agreement.

The Tribunal finds that the only undertaking clearly agreed to by Orbes was to exchange information
with Claimant with respect to the bankruptcy proceedings of Moravan:

The parties have agreed that they would mutually exchange information regarding all
facts relating to assets included in the bankruptcy estate of MORAVAN akciova
spolecnost and will continue to discuss future steps to ensure the legal certainty of the
parties and the rights and warranted interests of all creditors.

In the Tribunal’s view, while an inordinate delay can amount to a violation of the fair and
equitable treatment standard, the circumstances in the present case do not meet the required
threshold. The Tribunal notes that there is disagreement between the Parties as to the exact
amount of delay at the Regional Court that is attributable to Respondent, but, even on
Claimant’s case that the Regional Court was responsible for a total delay of 39 months, the
Tribunal is not satisfied that such a delay constitutes a breach of the fair and equitable
treatment standard of the BIT. As discussed above at paras. 293 and 295, in Jan de Nul"'®
and Toto,""" delays in court proceedings of ten and six years respectively did not amount to
a violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard. Even if this Tribunal were to
conclude that the entire delay was attributable to Respondent, it does not find that a delay
of just over 3 years amounts to a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard of the

BIT in the present circumstances.

To the extent that Claimant has pleaded this claim as a breach of full protection and
security, the Tribunal dismisses Claimant’s allegations. The judicial system of the Czech
Republic was available to Claimant and responsive to Claimant’s requests. The Injunctions
Claim was addressed promptly (within twelve days assuming Claimant's alleged filing date
of 22 November 2002). Also, once the Regional Court requested payment of the court fee,
and it was paid, the Regional Court’s response time between submissions never exceeded
ten days. For example, nine days after the fee was paid, the Court sent a request to LZ to
submit comments with regard to Claimant’s claim within ten days. Similarly, six days after

LZ submitted its comments, the Regional Court requested a reply from Claimant.*"*

The Tribunal notes that there was a delay of 18 months following Claimant’s initial filing
when the Regional Court took no action and this Tribunal acknowledges that such a delay
is not ideal. However, this Tribunal appreciates that at the time in question, the Czech
courts were experiencing at once a high volume of cases and a shortage of judges-""” This

helps to explain the delay, and although not an optimal situation for the efficient resolution

of claims, this Tribunal does not find that such a delay rises to the level of a breach of the

BIT.

. With respect to Claimant’s argument that government officials wrongfully failed to take

action when alerted to the delay at the Regional Court, the Tribunal considers that the
government officials were not under an obligation to intervene in court proceedings
between private parties, and therefore no right of Claimant had been breached by their
failure to act. On this point, the Tribunal finds it relevant that while Claimant complained
to government officials, it only did so well after the proceedings were concluded. Again,
there is no evidence that Claimant took active measures to accelerate the procedure at the

Regional Court during the actual processing of the Resolutions Claim.

. With respect to Claimant’s argument that by operation of Articles III(3) and II(4) of the

BIT, Claimant was entitled to the same right to expeditious proceedings before a court in
the Czech Republic as are persons entitled to such treatment under the ECHR, the Tribunal
notes that rights under the ECHR accrue to everyone, regardless of nationality. This
obviates Claimant’s need to rely on the BIT to invoke such rights. The Parties have not
pleaded the jurisprudence of the ECHR in these proceedings, therefore this Tribunal makes
no finding as to whether any standard set by the ECHR is applicable here and has been
breached.

Claim 2 - Actions of Bankruptcy Judges

Claimant’s Position

. Claimant contends that actions of the bankruptcy judges for MA and LZ breached the fair

and equitable treatment standard and the full protection and security standard, which
Claimant argues “must extend to the protection of foreign investors from private parties

when they act through the judicial organs of the State.”“’? Claimant asserts that they
arbitrarily exercised their discretion and demonstrated an unacceptable bias against

Claimant as a foreigner when they denied any interim relief or recognition and enforcement

of the Interim and Final Awards.*”' Claimant asserts that “all concerned were misguided in
thinking that an allegedly mandatory municipal law could deny recognition and
enforcement, or that the arbitration had not lawfully been pursued, or that there was a

>> 422

public policy reason not to recognise and enforce the Final Award”.

Claimant objects to the meeting between the two judges and the bankruptcy trustees on the
grounds that it was procedurally unfair to Claimant and “typifies the disposition of Czech
officials to adopt an arbitrary and parochial construction of their delegated authority in
order to justify, on a post hoc basis, their decision not to act in a fair and equitable manner

towards [Claimant].”"?°

Claimant also objects to Hanzlikova’s decision that “the fact that the arbitration proceeding
continued after the adjudication of a bankruptcy order constitutes a reason for the denial of
the Award’s recognition and enforcement pursuant to [Article V(2)(a) of the New York
Convention)”, asserting that this decision contravenes Claimant’s rights under Article III of
the BIT, Respondent's obligations under the New York Convention, and Article 15 of the
EC Regulation, which provides:

The effects of insolvency proceedings on a lawsuit pending

concerning an asset or a right of which the debtor has been divested

shall be governed solely by the law of the Member State in which
that lawsuit is pending.“**

Claimant contends that according to Article 4 of the EC Regulation, the law of Sweden

applies.“°°

Claimant submits that it is evident that when she was appointing Hajtmar as preliminary
trustee for MA, Hanzlikova recognised that (i) the Interim Award was binding and
enforceable in the Czech Republic; (ii) in the face of possible bankruptcy, the arbitration
proceedings would serve to resolve the priority of Claimant’s claims; and (iii) MA and LZ
were specifically prohibited by the terms of the Interim Award from any further sale,
transfer, encumbrance, or any other method of disposal of the LET Assets regardless of
whether the assets were in actual possession or control of MA or LZ."?7 Claimant disputes
Respondent’s contention that Hanzlikova was merely reciting Claimant’s position in her

decision.“*

Claimant argues that the Vala Opinion, upon which it alleges the bankruptcy judges based
their rulings, was wrong in several material respects, explaining that: (i) Claimant had
applied for separate satisfaction in the bankruptcy proceedings by filings dated
28 June 2004 in the case of MA and 26 July 2004 in the case of LZ; and (ii) its entitlement
to a first secured charge as of 15 August 2001 had been confirmed by the Stockholm
Tribunal, who did not purport to grant a first secured charge, but rather ordered the trustees

to grant it. Claimant also argues that, as explained above, the Vala Opinion was wrong

Article 4 reads as follows: “The law of the State of the opening of proceedings shall determine the
conditions for the opening of those proceedings, their conduct and their closure. It shall determine in
particular [...] the effects of the ins y ings on ings brought by indivi

law was never raised before the Stockholm Tribunal because that tribunal made clear at the outset
that Swedish procedural law applied to the Stockholm Arbitration. Claimant refers to the attestation

Claimant also refers to Hanzlikova’s finding that “an Award ordering the bankruptcy
trustee to grant secured charges against the bankrupt’s assets to the benefit of a creditor,
cannot be enforced because such an act would contradict to [sic] the Bankruptcy and
Composition Act and as such it would be generally illegal and in breach of this country’s
public order.“ Claimant asserts that merely because a Czech law is considered to be
mandatory does not render the law to the category of public policy. Public policy,
Claimant argues, contemplates exceptional considerations which transcend specific state

regulation, such as human rights and corruption, not the equality of bankruptcy creditors.**°

Claimant also disputes Respondent’s contention that a party must apply for recognition and
enforcement of an arbitral award and that Claimant had failed to do so. Claimant submits
that Section 40 of the Czech Law on International Private and Procedural Law states that

recognition of a foreign arbitral award does not require a separate ruling.“

Claimant disputes Respondent’s contention that the substance of Claimant’s request of the
trustees pursuant to the Interim Award was satisfied by their temporary freezing of the
disposition of the LET Assets controlled by MA or LZ until a declaration of bankruptcy.
Claimant suggests that the trustees could have stayed their processes until after issuance of
the Final Award because all transactions concerning the company are subject to the

Pas , 3
preliminary trustee’s consent. “*”

Claimant disputes Respondent’s assertion that the New York Convention does not require its
courts to honour interim measures of protection, noting that international jurisprudence

currently takes a “pro-enforcement” approach.***

Claimant asserts that, as the Czech Republic is an “avowedly proud” “Model Law
Country”, the 2006 amendments to the UNCITRAL Model Law, which apply to
preliminary and interim measures, should be used as a yardstick for measuring how

Respondent could have acted fairly and equitably in the circumstances.*”

Claimant submits that the actions of the bankruptcy trustees fall under two categories of

attribution to Respondent: (i) exercise of delegated legislative authority; and (ii) control by

Claimant’s Pre-Hearing Memorial, (84. Claimant notes that under section 40, the award in question
must comply with the conditions in section 39. Claimant refers to the Act of the Czech Republic No.

appears to be referring to the Arbitration Act (i.e. Act No. 216/1994 Coll., on Arbitral Proceedings
and Enforcement of Arbitral Awards), of which Section 40 sets out that the recognition of foreign
arbitral awards shall not be expressed by a special decision, and that foreign arbitral awards are
required to comply with the conditions provided by Section 39 (i.e. that the arbitral award must be
final and enforceable pursuant to the law of the state where it was issued, that it must not suffer a
defect under Section 31, and that the award must not be contrary to the public order).

an organ of the Czech state. Claimant also argues that it is not essential for the conduct of
the trustees to be attributed to the state in order to succeed in its claim because their

conduct is part and parcel of Respondents bankruptcy regime.”

Claimant explains that the trustees possessed the delegated legislative authority necessary
to act as “de facto gatekeepers for Respondent’s bankruptcy regime” in that they make
initial decisions about whether a creditor’s claim is valid on its face or should be
excluded.“ Claimant argues that the fact that the erroneous decision not to include
Claimant’s claim was not corrected by either bankruptcy judge confirms that the trustees’

decisions should be attributed to the Czech state.”

Claimant contends that it is not a controversial proposition in international law that such
delegated authority may serve as the source for attribution.“ Claimant also notes that the
Czech Constitutional Court has ruled that bankruptcy trustees exercise state authority in a

manner akin to a public body.“*

Resolution of Supreme Court, dated 25 June 2002 (Exhibit C-0363) (cited in Claimant’s Post-
Hearing Memorial, 106):

According to doctrine, the bankruptcy trustee is a special public law body whose task
is to ensure proper execution of the bankruptcy proceeding

[ed

The Constitutional Court agrees with the doctrine definition based on aspects defining
the term “public law body”. They include public purpose, the method of appointment
and authority. The public purpose of the institute of the bankruptcy trustee must be
seen in the acceptance of a limited public intervention in the resolution of property
relations that have run into a crisis, The method of appointment is the decision of a
state body (court). The bankruptcy trustee’s powers, which are laid down in a number
of Bankruptcy and Composition Act provisions (Section 14, Sections 17 through 20,
Section 24, Sections 26 through 29), given their heteronymous nature (since the
bankruptcy trustee is neither considered to be a representative of the bankruptcy
creditors nor the bankrupt) then represent the execution of authority (in contrast to the
heteronymous nature of public law acts, private law acts — legal acts — have an
autonomous nature).

Respondent's Position

Respondent argues that there was nothing objectionable about the meeting between the
bankruptcy judges and trustees and Vala because (i) Claimant’s requests for preliminary
injunctions had already been denied; (ii) Claimant's ex parte request calling on the judges
to exercise their supervisory discretion under Section 12 of the Bankruptcy Act did not
constitute an adversarial proceeding; and (iii) the bankruptcies of LZ and MA were
inextricably linked, requiring the involvement of all of the attendees in question.“
Respondent notes that Claimant was provided with a detailed account of the discussions the
following day and that Claimant was well aware of ongoing coordination between the
bankruptcy trustees and the creditors’ committees of MA and LZ, who met regularly in
joint meetings, because Sup was present at those meetings. While Claimant may not have
known the content of the Vala Opinion, Respondent argues that this is not attributable to

Respondent.“°

Respondent dismisses Claimant’s suggestion that there was a conspiracy to block
recognition and enforcement of the Final Award, noting that six different courts including

the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court subsequently upheld the ruling against

Claimant's application to enforce the Order on Security in the Final Award.“”

Respondent argues that the Interim Award was not enforceable under the New York

Convention* and that even if it was, one cannot enforce a judgment or award simply by

Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, 107; Respondent’s Pre-Hearing Memorial, 9158-59;
Respondent’s Post-Hearing Memorial, 460. Respondent notes that the bankruptcies became linked
when the bankruptcy trustee of MA successfully avoided the contribution of assets by MA into the
capital of LZ in October 2001. Respondent explains that this contribution of assets was ineffective
by operation of law against the bankruptcy creditors of MA because it occurred after the bankruptcy
petition had been lodged against MA on 14 August 2001 and that these assets had been physically
used and operated by LZ since 2001. Thus, Respondent observes, the coordination was essential for
any contemplated sale of those assets.

instructing an agent to write letters to various institutions; a judicial procedure must be

followed.”

Even though Claimant’s various applications with respect to the Interim Award actually

went beyond the relief granted by the Stockholm Tribunal,"

Respondent argues that all of
Claimant’s requests were reviewed and those that were in accordance with applicable law
were granted.**' Claimant’s request for appointment of an interim receiver in MA and an
injunction to prevent disposition of the assets of MA (to give effect to the Interim Award)
was upheld as no consent was given for any dispositions of assets by LZ during the
preliminary bankruptcy trusteeship of LZ (9 January 2004 to 30 March 2004), and a
preliminary bankruptcy trustee was installed in MA such that there were no dispositions
relating to MA’s property.*? Respondent also notes that the Cadastral Office was unable to
obtain Claimant’s cooperation in dealing with its request for a seal to be imprinted by
identifying the real property affected by the Interim Award and confirming the Interim

Award’s final and binding effect.**

Respondent disagrees with Claimant’s characterisation of the Czech Republic as an

“UNCITRAL Model Law” country, noting also that the Interim Award was issued on

to write letters to various institutions and judges, did not constitute the proper judicial procedure.

Transfin to Regional Court, dated 27 February 2004) contains an incorrect translation. Where the
letter requests that “all parties” be enjoined from any disposition with assets of MA, the Czech
original of the letter specifies that it is the preliminary bankruptcy trustee who should be enjoined.
Respondent refers to Letter from Transfin to Regional Court, dated 27 February 2004 (Exhibit
R-0155) as the correct translation of the letter.

30 January 2004, almost three years before the 2006 amendments to the UNCITRAL

Model Law regarding interim measures were adopted.**

In response to Claimant’s arguments under Article 15 of the EC Regulation, Respondent
posits that Article 15 only determined the procedural effects of bankruptcy proceedings
commenced in the Czech Republic on the Stockholm Arbitration,*® but does not determine
anything with respect to the enforceability of any ultimate judgment or award against the

litigant party subject to the bankruptcy proceedings.**°

Respondent rejects Claimant’s submission that the conduct of the bankruptcy trustees for
MA and LZ is attributable to the Czech state and submits that it is settled Czech law that
the Czech Republic is not liable for acts of the bankruptcy trustees.*"” Respondent explains
that under the Bankruptcy Act, the bankruptcy trustee is an independent procedural entity
and, although the trustee is selected by the bankruptcy court from a list of independent
private individuals or legal entities registered with the court, the trustee is not a court proxy
and is not acting on its behalf.’ Once appointed by the court, the bankruptcy trustee is
obliged to fulfil its obligations autonomously, with professional care and under personal
liability for damage caused by its acts.” The remuneration and expenses of the bankruptcy

trustee are borne by the creditors as they are paid out from the proceeds of the sale of the

Respondent also notes that, as explained at 192 of its Counter-Memorial, the EC Regulation stricto

bankruptcy assets.“ Respondent explains that the bankruptcy trustee does not possess the

authority to decide on the existence or priority of a claim in bankruptcy.“

Respondent dismisses Claimant’s reliance on the Constitutional Court’s statement that a
bankruptcy trustee exercises state authority in a manner akin to a public body, noting that
the decision in which the statement is found did not substantively deal with the position of
the bankruptcy trustee, but rather decided on the abolition of certain provisions of the

Bankruptcy Act relating to the process of remunerating a bankruptcy trustee, on the basis

462

that they violated the principle of equality.” Respondent notes that the decisions of other

Czech courts have dealt with the issue more directly and support its position.“

Respondent refers to Section 8(3) of the Bankruptcy Act, supra note 117:

(3) The trustee is entitled to remuneration and to reimbursement of his cash expenses.
Any other agreement on the trustee's remuneration or reimbursement of expenses
concluded by the trustee with the parties to the bankruptcy proceedings shall be null
and void. An account of such remuneration and reimbursement of expenses shall be
given by the bankruptcy trustee in his final report or, if there is none, on cancellation
of the bankruptcy proceedings; the court may approve the provision of advances to the
bankruptcy trustee. According to the circumstances of the case, the court may
adequately increase or reduce the remuneration calculated according to another act.
Creditors may provide the trustee, even repeatedly, with advances of his expenses on
the basis of a resolution made by the creditors’ committee, approved by the court;
when advances are provided, the purpose of the expenses and the conditions of
accounting for them may be determined. The bankruptcy trustee is entitled to entrust a
third person with duties which he is obliged to perform on account of the bankrupt’s
estate, only with consent of the creditors’ committee.

Respondent’s Post-Hearing Memorial, 157; Opinion of Supreme Court, dated 17 June 1998
(Exhibit C-0362, Exhibit R-0173) [“Opinion No. R 52/98”). Respondent explains that the
bankruptcy trustee is only one of the many stakeholders with the right to opine on a claim, and in the
event a claim is contested, the courts of the Czech Republic and not the trustee must decide.
Respondent submits its own translation of the relevant parts of Opinion No. R 52/98 as Exhibit R-
0173.

Opinion No. R 52/98, supra note 461.

Respondent’s Post-Hearing Memorial, 158. Respondent refers to Resolution of Supreme Court,
dated 26 November 2008 (Exhibit R-0190):

In judicial practice there is a uniform interpretation with regard to the fact that the
bankruptcy trustee is not a participant in the bankruptcy proceedings. As a special
procedural entity, the Trustee has a separate status both in relation to the bankrupt
entity and in relation to the bankruptcy creditors and the Trustee cannot be viewed as a
representative of the bankruptcy creditors and neither can he be viewed as the
bankrupt entity’s representative. [...] The Constitutional Court further added - with
regard to the status of a bankruptcy trustee - that such Trustee is a special public body.
A Trustee is not, however, a body of a State Agency or of a state organization (and it
is quite apparent that neither is he a body of a social organization) within the meaning
of Section 1(1) of the Act [Act No. 58/1969 Coll., on liability for damages caused by a
decision of a public body], and this can also be seen from the fact that (in contrast with
a State Agency), he bears personal liability for damages that arise due to a breach of

361.

362.

363.

Under international law, Respondent submits that the acts of a bankruptcy trustee do not
satisfy the test for attribution under Article 5 or Article 8 of the JLC Articles. Respondent
explains that a bankruptcy trustee is not a de jure or de facto public organ for the purposes
of Article 5, nor does a bankruptcy trustee act “on the instructions of, or under the direction

or control of” the Czech state for the purposes of Article 8.*

Respondent notes that the issue of responsibility of a state for a bankruptcy trustee acting
within a civilian legal framework similar to that of the Czech Republic has been discussed
in Plama v. Bulgaria where the tribunal decided that Bulgaria was not responsible for the

actions of its bankruptcy trustees.“

Tribunal’s Analysis

Given the significant degree of overlap between Claim 2 and Claim 4, only Claimant’s

Hajtmar, and Vala (the bankruptcy judges and trustees), and the treatment of the Vala

the duties imposed on him by the law or duties imposed by a court (Cf. Section 8(2) of
the Act on Bankruptcy and Composition). [...] A contrary interpretation would lead to
the conclusion that a bankruptcy trustee is not a party that has the capacity to be sued
in a legal action for compensation of damages caused by a breach of the bankruptcy
trustee’s duties during the performance of his post (this would mean that the only party
that could be sued would in all cases be - in its capacity as the entity responsible for
such ‘public body’ in its service - solely the Czech Republic, under the regime
stipulated in Act No. 58/1969 Coll., or - with regard to the period from 15 May 1998 -
under the regime stipulated in Act No 82/1998 Coll.). The settled interpretation seen in
judicial practice, however, does not support such a view, which can be documented by,
for example, the judgment of the Supreme Court published under number 88/2003 in
the Collection of Court Decisions and Opinions (which in fact indicates that a
bankruptcy trustee is a person that is independently liable pursuant to Section 420 (1)
of the Civil Code for damages sustained by participants in bankruptcy proceedings or
third parties in consequence of a breach of the duties imposed on the bankruptcy
trustee by the law or a court decision). [...] To the extent that the parties that filed the
extraordinary appeal have alleged that they sustained damages in consequence of,
among other things, or any wrongful action of the bankruptcy trustee, the conclusion
that can be stated is that the only party that they can be sued on the basis of such an
allegation is the relevant Trustee, not the Czech Republic - which bears no direct
liability for a wrongful action of a bankruptcy trustee.

Opinion will be dealt with under this section. Claimant’s claims relating to the substantive
decisions of the bankruptcy judges and trustees, as well as other Czech courts, with respect
to the recognition and enforcement of the Interim and Final Awards will be dealt with

under Claim 4.

Claimant alleges that the 1 June 2005 meeting was procedurally unfair and demonstrative
of Czech officials’ adopting an arbitrary and parochial construction of their delegated
authority in order to justify their decision not to act in a fair and equitable manner.‘
Claimant characterises this meeting as a “serious departure from basic principles of fairness
and due process”.“"” Claimant implies that it should have received notice of the 1 June

2005 meeting.“**

With respect to the Vala Opinion, Claimant implies that it should have been provided with
an opportunity to comment on the Vala Opinion.“ Claimant finds the Vala Opinion to be
both factually incorrect in that it wrongfully alleged that (i) Claimant had implied that the
Final Award was in the process of being nullified; (ii) Claimant had never initiated any
proceedings to recognise or enforce the award; and (iii) Claimant had never claimed
separate satisfaction for its security interest pursuant to the Final Award. Claimant also
asserts that the Vala Opinion was legally incorrect in that it wrongfully stated that (i) the
Stockholm Arbitration was not permitted to continue once bankruptcy had been declared;
(ii) the Arbitral Award contravened the public policy of the Czech Republic because it
ordered the trustees to grant secured charges contrary to the Bankruptcy Act and failed to
respect the equality of creditors in bankruptcy; and (iii) Claimant was not entitled to any
secured charges until the proceedings with respect to nullification of the Final Award had

been resolved, which Claimant notes did not occur until September 2008.”

As noted above (see supra paragraphs 289 to 296), in order to constitute a breach of fair
and equitable treatment on the grounds of procedural impropriety and a lack of due process

or bad faith, other tribunals have considered factors including a failure to hear the investor,

lack of proper notification, persistent appeals to local favouritism, and denial of access to

the courts.

In this case, it is necessary to consider the exact nature of the 1 June 2005 meeting and the
events which led up to it. These have already been described in outline in paragraphs 153
to 155 above, but a closer analysis is appropriate.

The Final Award in the Stockholm Arbitration was issued on 30 December 2004.47!

On 28 February 2005, Czech counsel for Claimant submitted the Final Award, including a
certified translation into the Czech language, to the judges seized with the bankruptcy
proceedings against MA and LZ and to the trustees in bankruptcy for MA and LZ, Hajtmar

472

and Sladek, respectively. The submission to the judge overseeing the bankruptcy

proceeding of MA expressly made the request that the Final Award be recognised:
Based on the above, I am herewith requesting you to exercise your

authority and ensure that the above Arbitral Award be recognized,
namely by the bankruptcy trustee.

Jewitt testified to his understanding that Claimant’s counsel made a similar submission to

3

the judge overseeing the LZ bankruptcy proceeding.” Respondent does not appear to

challenge this evidence.

On 31 March 2005, the trustee in bankruptcy for LZ, Sladek responded to Claimant’s
correspondence of 28 February 2005 and sent an almost identical letter to Sup, of Transfin

474 Tn these letters, the

International s.r.o., the agent of Claimant in the Czech Republic.
objection that recognition and enforcement of the Final Award could contravene public
policy was raised for the first time:

award shall be denied if the award would contravene public policy
of the country where the recognition (and enforcement) is supposed
to be executed. In terms of the subject arbitral award, I must state
that it indeed contradicts the public policy of the Czech Republic. I
see this contradiction in an apparent incompatibility with the Czech
mandatory legal regulations, in particular Act No. 328/19991 Coll.,
on bankruptcy and composition. Since bankruptcy proceedings
mean serious intervention in the legal status of a broad spectrum of
subjects, they are regulated by a strictly mandatory legislation which
must be unconditionally observed. [...] Since the Arbitral Award
fails to respect mandatory legislation regulating bankruptcy
proceedings and fundamental legal principles, it is unacceptable in
the Czech legal system. Therefore I cannot consider it in the
bankruptcy proceedings.

On 8 April 2005, Vala, counsel for the creditors’ committee of MA, informed Czech
counsel for Claimant that the creditors’ committee “concluded that this Final Award orders
the bankruptcy trustee to effect performance that is impermissible according to domestic

475
Ww.

lay He also indicated that the creditors’ committee filed an action requesting the

cancellation of the Final Award.

The statement of claim filed with the Regional Court in Brno in the action to nullify the
Final Award filed by Vala on behalf of Hajtmar, as trustee in bankruptcy of MA, alleges
that compliance with the Final Award would be impossible or impermissible under

476

domestic law.""” Likely due to the nature of the proceeding, the public policy ground for

477
Based

refusing the recognition and enforcement of an arbitral award was not invoked.
on the evidentiary record, it does not appear that any similar arguments were made by the
trustees in bankruptcy of either MA or LZ to the judges overseeing the respective

bankruptcy proceedings.

On 11 May 2005, a representative of Claimant participated in the second review hearing in
the bankruptcy proceeding for MA. Claimant’s claimed receivable was not discussed and

was transferred to the next review hearing “given the seriousness of this case”."”* Tt does

not appear that the Final Award or its potential impact on the bankruptcy proceeding was

discussed before the court.

On 17 May 2005, in response to a joint public tender for the assets of MA and LZ
announced by the respective trustees in bankruptcy, Claimant applied for interim
injunctions in both bankruptcy proceedings seeking to enjoin the trustees in bankruptcy
from disposing of the assets of MA and LZ. At the same time, Claimant filed parallel

motions to cancel the joint tender in each proceeding."””

On 19 May 2005, the court in the MA bankruptcy proceedings declined the application for
an interim injunction. The court did not analyse the Final Award. Rather, it dismissed the
injunction application with reference to its supervisory jurisdiction, which required the
court’s approval to any sale of the assets of MA. Since the approval had not been given,

Claimant remained legally protected. The court observed:

Such approval has not been issued yet and in the future decision-
making about the approval the court will take into consideration all
of the above mentioned facts and will carefully consider further
action in a way that the rights of either participant won’t be
violated.**?

Claimant’s appeal from the denial of the interim injunction was dismissed by the High
Court in Olomouc on 27 July 2005 for the reasons expressed by the bankruptcy court.

However, the appellate court also agreed with Claimant that its submissions in respect of

the Final Award had not been addressed by the lower court:**!

The appellate court agrees with the bankruptcy creditor’s objection
that the first instance court has not addressed the grounds for
seeking an interim injunction. In the petition for an interim
injunction, the Petitioner stated circumstances based on which he
concluded that the execution of rights pursuant to the final award of
December 30, 2004 had been frustrated. He explicitly stated that the
enforcement of this award had been jeopardized [...]

denied Claimant’s motion for an interim injunction. The decision rested on the same
reason as expressed in the 19 May 2005 decision in the MA proceeding. However, as
additional grounds, it concluded that recognition and enforcement of the Final Award
should be denied pursuant to section 39(a) and (c) of the Arbitration Act “if the award is not
legally effective and enforceable pursuant to domestic law and the award would contravene

public policy.”4*

On the record, the bankruptcy court’s decision in the LZ proceeding denying Claimant’s
application for an interim injunction was the first instance in which the incompatibility of
the Final Award with Czech public policy was raised in the proceedings before the
bankruptcy courts. At this point in time, Claimant’s motions to strike the joint tender were
still pending and it had not had an opportunity to make submissions on the public policy

objections to the recognition and enforcement of the Final Award.

On 1 June 2005, the supervising judges in the bankruptcy proceedings involving MA and
LZ held a joint meeting with the trustees in bankruptcy for the two companies, Hajtmar and
Sladek. Claimant did not participate in the meeting. Its main witness, Jewitt, has testified
that Claimant did not have notice of the meeting and only learned of the meeting the

following day, when Hajtmar sent a reporting e-mail to Sup.‘

At the 1 June 2005 meeting, the participants discussed the Final Award and Claimant’s

motions to cancel the joint tender. The minutes of this meeting report the following in
respect of the recognition and enforcement of the Final Award:***4
All parties present agree that the subject Arbitral Award cannot be
respected in view of the provisions of §39, letter b) and §31, letter f)
of Act No. 216/1994 Coll. on bankruptcy proceedings and the
enforcement of arbitral awards, because it adjudicates the party to
perform acts that are impossible or illegal under domestic law and

Arbitral Awards, the recognition or enforcement of the Award
would contradict the public policy of the Czech Republic.

This means that in the course of the bankruptcy proceeding, the right
to separate satisfaction from the Bankrupt’s assets cannot be
established for a creditor and therefore the Bankruptcy Trustee can
neither conclude a contract of pledge to the benefit of the creditor
nor provide any other security for his receivable. Such approach
would be in gross violation of the Bankruptcy and Composition Act.
Apart from separate satisfaction based on a promissory note [...],
the creditor did not claim any right to separate satisfaction in either
of the bankruptcy proceedings; therefore, such claim could not have
been reviewed in the review hearing and this creditor is not a
separate creditor. [...]

Both Judges agree that the standing of creditor Frontier and claims
raised by this creditor do not constitute an obstacle to the prepared
sale.

Mgr. Vala submits to the court a written statement regarding the
creditor's motion to proceed pursuant to §12 of the Bankruptcy and
Composition Act [the cancellation of the tender].

382. The written statement referred to in the last paragraph of the excerpt from the 1 June 2005

minutes is the Vala Opinion.” Claimant did not receive a copy of the Vala Opinion until

Respondent produced it in this arbitration.**°

383. In respect of the recognition and enforcement of the Final Award, the Vala Opinion had,

among other things, this to say:"*7

According to the above-mentioned Convention [the New York
Convention] (specifically its article V./2), there are the following
two reasons owing to which recognition and enforcement of an
arbitral award may be rejected:

a) the subject matter of the difference cannot be settled by
arbitration under the law of that country (Czech Republic in the
given case)

b) recognition or enforcement of the award would be contrary to the
public policy of that country. [...]

The fact that the Arbitral Award ordered the Bankruptcy Trustee to
grant first secured charges to the Creditor is contrary to the
respective provisions of the Bankruptcy and Composition Act. It

fails to respect the equality of bankruptcy creditors to the extent that
after the bankruptcy adjudication, the Bankruptcy Trustee is not
entitled to perform acts aimed at securing receivables that arose
prior to the bankruptcy adjudication (i.e. receivables that must be
claimed). In this sense, the Arbitral Award is contrary to the public
policy of this country, which constitutes another reason why the
recognition and enforcement of the Award must be rejected.

The Vala Opinion also asserted that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction to recognise
and enforce the Final Award and that Claimant had not yet made an application for

recognition and enforcement to the competent court.

As indicated above, on 2 June 2005, the trustee in bankruptcy for MA, Hajtmar, reported by
e-mail on the meeting with the bankruptcy judges to the creditors committee of MA. The
report makes it clear that the purpose of the 1 June 2005 meeting was “in conjunction with

the application for injunction [the motions to cancel the joint tender] from the Frontier

3488

Company. It also states clearly that the outcome of Claimant’s motions was decided, or

at least conveyed, at the meeting and that the sale of the assets of LZ and MA was

approved:

On [sic] this meeting was presented a legal opinion from MA side,
the analysis of present situation regarding to Arbitral decision from
Stockholm (and so the answer to the courts prompt) [sic]. From the
analysis and the discussion is clear that requested injunction against
the assets has no ground. And will be refused by both judges.

The sale of LZ was approved by the judge and sale of assets held by
MA will be approved also. Also, MA facility in Otrokovice could
be prepared for sale as planed [sic].(emphasis added)

Hajtmar then went on to convey the following from the meeting with the judges:

Also in discussion was a fact that steps taken by FPS, while taken to
protect their interest are not compatible with interest of remaining
creditors. (If FPS would be successful the rest of the creditors
would get nothing.)

And so it is a question for creditors of MA and specifically members
of Creditors Committee if it is correct that FPS is a member of CC
[the creditors committee]. The question of removal FPS [sic] would
be presented on the next meeting of CC and it is preferable that
members would create their opinion about this.

As anticipated in the MA trustee’s report, both bankruptcy courts subsequently denied
Claimant’s motion in respect of the joint tender. Already on 2 June 2005, the court in the
MA bankruptcy proceedings issued its reasons."* The decision reproduced at some length
passages from the Vala Opinion and concluded that:

[...] an Award ordering the bankruptcy trustee to grant secured

charges against the bankrupt’s assets to the benefit of a creditor,

cannot be enforced because such act would contradict to [sic] the

Bankruptcy and Composition Act and as such is would be generally
illegal and in breach of this country’s public order.

On 9 June 2005, the court in the LZ bankruptcy proceedings also denied Claimant’s
application to cancel the joint tender. The issue concerning the recognition and

enforcement of the Final Award was addressed in one paragraph, without detailed
analysis:"”°
Given the fact that the Arbitral Tribunal Award contradicts the
Bankruptcy and Composition Act and with reference to the
provisions of Section 39 of Act No. 39, letter (b) and Section 31
letter f) of Act No. 216/1994 Coll., the court has decided as stated
above.

On 16 June 2005, Claimant filed four motions requesting the recognition and enforcement

of the Final Award, one each in respect of MA, LZ, and Hajtmar and Sladek.*?!

After the creditor committees for LZ and MA accepted an offer by CZK to purchase the
assets of the two bankrupt companies on 27 June 2005, the court supervising the
bankruptcy proceedings involving MA approved the sale on 28 June 2005.4? Claimant's

constitutional complaint against the approval of the sale failed on the basis that the

constitutional rights of Claimant were not breached. The Constitutional Court reached

the same conclusion with respect to Claimant’s constitutional complaints against the

dismissals of 2 and 9 June 2005, of its application to cancel the joint tender.

The application for recognition and enforcement of the Final Award against Hajtmar was

denied and the outcome was affirmed on appeal and Claimant’s subsequent extra-ordinary

495

appeal to the Czech Supreme Court.” The court of first instance and the appellate court

both refused the recognition and enforcement of the Final Award on the basis of Article
V(2)(b) of the New York Convention as contrary to the public policy of the Czech

Republic, albeit for different reasons. The appellate court held in particular:*°°

It would be contrary to Czech laws as well as public policy in the
Czech Republic, and would be contrary to the Constitution as well
as all other rules in effect not only in the Czech Republic but also in
other signatory countries to the New York Convention, for an
obligation to be imposed on someone in contravention of his rights
and obligations and in contravention of the laws and public policy of
the country in which the enforcement (execution) is to be
implemented. It is not possible to demand that a bankruptcy trustee
breach the obligations imposed on him/her by the bankruptcy law.
Moreover, in view of the foregoing it is also not possible to order a
bankruptcy trustee to ensure a priority ranking for the entitled party
in bankruptcy proceedings.

[...]

In conclusion it can be stated that the submitted execution title
completely fails to respect the mandatory rules of Czech laws, has a
tendency to unacceptably interfere with the powers, authority and
independence of a bankruptcy court, attempts to force it to take steps
that are contrary to Czech laws, principle [sic] of justice and equal
status of parties in court proceedings. In the appellate court’s
opinion, in this case there are grounds for not recognizing the
submitted execution title as enforceable on the territory of the Czech
Republic when one applies Article V (2) (b) of the [New York
Convention].

The appellate court further concluded that, as a matter of Czech law, the Final Award was
not sufficiently specific and therefore not enforceable and that MA’s bankruptcy trustee,

Hajtmar, was the wrong respondent for Claimant’s petition to recognise and enforce the

497

award. Claimant’s extra-ordinary appeal from the appeal decision was denied as

inadmissible by the Supreme Court of the Czech Republic.*8

The application for recognition and enforcement of the Final Award against the trustee in

bankruptcy for LZ, Sladek, was also dismissed by the Municipal Court in Brno as contrary

to Czech public policy.”” The court’s reasoning is similar to the analysis adopted by the

court of first instance in the proceedings against Hajtmar. The decision of the Municipal

Court in the Hajtmar case was later upheld by the Regional Court of Brno and the Supreme

Court of the Czech Republic. Claimant did not appeal the Municipal Court’s decision

Following the dismissal of the enforcement proceedings, and an appeal by Claimant,®”* the

Appellate Division of the Regional Court in Bmo granted partial recognition of the Final

506

Award against LZ on 30 March 2007. However, the dismissal of the enforcement

proceedings in respect of the accounting for all the property of LZ and the dismissal of the
grant of a first secured charge against the LET Assets by entering into a pledge agreement
with Claimant, as ordered by the Final Award, were upheld. In its reasons, the court
referred to the public policy considerations in its 25 August 2006 decision in the same
matter. As of mid-2009, a further, extraordinary appeal by Claimant to the Supreme Court

of the Czech Republic, filed on 21 June 2007, was still pending.°°”

In the recognition and enforcement proceedings against MA, the District Court in Zlin
denied Claimant’s petition on 25 January 2006." The court considered the Final Award to

be not enforceable on procedural grounds. On appeal, the Regional Court in Brno partially

509

reversed the lower court decision in a decision dated 15 February 2007.””” In substance the

decision parallels the ruling of the same court in the enforcement proceedings against LZ.
The enforcement of the first three orders of the Final Award was denied; the enforcement
of the payment orders Nos. 4, 7, 8 and 10 was granted. In respect of the former, the court

held as follows:

In relation to the company [MA] [...] the principal question is how
specifically the holding of this Arbitral Award is to be incorporated
into proceedings pursuant to the provisions of Act 120/2001 Coll. in
compliance with the Czech legal order. Imposing an obligation on a
person that would violate such person’s rights and obligations and
contradict the legal and public order of the country in which such act
(an execution) is to be carried out would indeed contravene the legal
and public order of the Czech Republic, its Constitution and all legal
standards applicable not only for the Czech Republic but also for

other signatory states of the New York Convention. A bankruptcy

Pursuant to the provisions of § 14, para 1, letter e) of Act 328/1991
Coll., the Bankruptcy and Composition Act, as amended, it shall be
impossible to execute a judgment (execution order) relating to assets

Bankrupt to violate his obligations given the Bankruptcy Act. [...]

As the Appellate Court has already stated several times in the
rationale of its rulings, the submitted execution title fails in this part
to respect the mandatory standards of the Czech legal order; it tends
unduly to encroach on the authority, competence and independence
of the Bankruptcy Court and attempts to force it into taking steps
that contravene the Czech legal order and the principle of justice and
equality of the parties in judicial proceedings. Hence, in the
Appellate Court’s opinion, the discussed part of the execution title
provides reasons for non-executability of the submitted execution
title in the Czech Republic invoking Article V point 2, letter b) of
the [New York Convention].

¢ Procedural Fairness

The procedure followed by the Czech courts in addressing Claimant’s applications of
17 May 2005 in the bankruptcy proceedings against MA and LZ to cancel the joint tender
for the sale of MA’s and LZ’s assets raises concerns of procedural fairness and in
particular, whether Claimant should have been heard on the arguments against
enforceability of the Final Award raised by the trustees in bankruptcy for MA and LZ and
adopted by the courts.

403.

These concerns arise out of the meeting of the judges supervising the MA and LZ
bankruptcy proceedings with the responsible trustees and their counsel on | June 2005 and
the failure of the courts to ensure the participation of Claimant in this meeting or to give
Claimant an opportunity to respond to the submissions of the trustees in bankruptcy against
the recognition and enforcement of the Final Award as contrary to the mandatory law and

public policy of the Czech Republic.

While the trustee in bankruptcy first raised the public policy objection against the
recognition and enforcement of the Final Award in the application of 7 April 2005 to have
the award set aside, neither Hajtmar nor Sladek advanced this defence in the MA and LZ
bankruptcy proceedings in response to Claimant’s motion of 28 February 2005 to have the

Final Award recognised.

In the context of the bankruptcy proceedings, the issue of whether the Final Award was
enforceable was first referred to by the LZ bankruptcy court in rejecting Claimant’ s motion
for an interim injunction on 23 May 2005. In the LZ and the MA bankruptcy proceedings,
the main reason for rejecting the applications for interim measures was that the application
was premature. Before the trustees in bankruptcy could proceed with the sale of the MA
and LZ assets on the basis of the joint tender, approval of the court would be required. As
the court in the MA proceedings put it, “in the future decision-making about the approval
the court will take into consideration all of the above mentioned facts”, which included

Claimant’s requests to recognise and enforce the Final Award 53

From the perspective of Claimant, there is certainly an argument to the effect that it was
therefore reasonable to expect that not only would the sale of the LZ and MA assets require
further court approval, but also that Claimant would be given an opportunity to be heard in

respect of the sale and in respect of Claimant’s pending motions to cancel the joint tender.

In fact, however, Claimant’s motions to cancel were effectively dismissed — and the sale of
the assets effectively approved — at the 1 June 2005 meeting among the bankruptcy judges
and the trustees in bankruptcy and Vala: “From the analysis and the discussion is clear that

the requested injunction against the assets has no ground. And will be refused by both

a

judges. The sale of LZ was also approved by the judge and the sale of assets held by MA

will be approved also.”°!4

During the meeting, Hajtmar and Vala first presented the Vala Opinion to the bankruptcy
judges. The outcome of the meeting and the discussion between the bankruptcy judges and
the trustees was clearly recorded in the minutes: “All parties present agree that the subject
Arbitral Award cannot be respected [...] because it adjudicates the party to perform acts
that are impossible or illegal under domestic law and because [...] the recognition or

enforcement of the Award would contradict the public policy of the Czech Republic.”

Claimant did not have any notice or knowledge of the meeting. Claimant did not
participate in the meeting and it did not have an opportunity to attend the meeting and
present its case in respect of the objections that recognition and enforcement of the Final
Award would be illegal and contrary to Czech public policy. Rather, Claimant first learned

of the meeting and its outcome on the following day from Hajtmar.

That same day, 2 June 2005, the court in the MA bankruptcy proceeding issued its decision
dismissing Claimant’s motion to cancel the joint tender. Thus, Claimant was also denied
the opportunity to make submissions to the court on the objections against the recognition

and enforcement of the Final Award following the 1 June 2005 meeting.

The 2 June 2005 reasons for judgment of the MA bankruptcy court indicated that the Vala
Opinion was critical to the court’s analysis. As indicated in the introduction to the court’s
analysis, the “court leans towards the trustee’s argument” and then went on to adopt the

position expounded in the Vala Opinion.
However, there are several other important factors which need to be taken into account in

evaluating the claim of procedural unfairness. First, there is an important difference

between:

(i) | The court deciding on the basis of a legal theory of which a party was completely

unaware; and,

Letter from Hajtmar to Transfin, dated 2 June 2005 (Exhibit C-0098).

141

409.

410.

All.

412.

(ii) The court deciding on an issue raised by one or other party and of which both parties

were or should have been aware.

On 31 March 2005, Claimant and its Czech representative were advised by the bankruptcy
trustee for LZ that the recognition and enforcement of the Final Award could contravene
public policy. Further, it can be said that a reasonably well-informed observer would have
been alert to the public policy argument that to uphold and enforce the Final Award in the
context of ongoing bankruptcy proceedings would necessarily conflict with the
fundamental principle of equal pro rata sharing of assets of the bankrupt’s estate, except in
the case of secured creditors. That observer would also have appreciated that since a public
policy issue was involved, the courts would be obliged to examine it, irrespective of

whether the parties themselves pursued it.

Secondly, another important reason why the Tribunal cannot uphold the suggestion that
there was procedural unfairness and a denial of justice is that after the decision of the
bankruptcy courts on 2 and 9 June 2005, Claimant had the opportunity to appeal the
decisions to the Municipal Court and the Supreme Court and did so. There were no
complaints by Claimant in this case about the fairness of the appellate processes. Even if
there was any procedural unfairness in the decision-making of the bankruptcy courts the
Tribunal considers that availability of full rights of appeal has satisfactorily eliminated any

procedural imperfections in the process which occurred in the lower courts.

Thirdly, and importantly, from the perspective of causation, it is not likely that the
decisions of the bankruptcy courts would or could have been different as a matter of Czech
law, had Claimant been accorded an opportunity to be heard. Rather, the outcome of
Claimant’s subsequent four motions for recognition and enforcement of the Final Award
and the consistent judicial reasoning in support suggest that the 2 and 9 June 2005 decisions

of the bankruptcy courts generally reflect the public policy of the Czech Republic.

In particular, it is worth noting, that even though the Final Award was eventually partially
recognised by the Czech appellate courts both in relation to MA and LZ, such recognition
did not extend to the key first and second orders of the Stockholm Tribunal, which would

have granted Claimant a first secured charge against the LET Assets and all of the property

142

413.

414.

of MA. Without the first secured charge, Claimant did not rank as a preferred creditor and
could therefore not realise a right to separate satisfaction. Without the right to separate
satisfaction, Claimant did not have a legal basis, as a matter of Czech bankruptcy law, to

oppose the joint tender and eventual sale of the MA and LZ assets.

In short, the refusal of the bankruptcy courts to recognise and enforce the first and second
orders granted in the Final Award on the ground that doing so would be contrary to Czech
public policy appears consistent with Czech law. Hence it is open for this Tribunal to find
in light of all the evidence, and it does so find, that the courts would not have come to a
different conclusion had they given Claimant a hearing. This failure to provide a hearing

had no bearing on the final outcome.

Finally, as to the meeting on 1 June 2005, there is force in Respondent’s submission in
paragraph 107 of its Counter-Memorial and in paragraph 59 of its Pre-Hearing

Submissions:

“107. Frontier’s request for the exercise of discretion by the
court in a particular way was not an adversarial proceeding. In the
circumstances, there was nothing improper or objectionable in the
two judges jointly meeting with the bankruptcy trustees, who were
not parties of the process commenced by Frontier’s ex parte
application, but who could be nonetheless affected by it, and to
ascertain their views. The fact that Frontier was informed about the
contents of the discussion by the bankruptcy trustee of MA the very
next day speaks for itself.” (emphasis in original)

“59. This meeting occurred after Frontier’s requests for the
issuance of preliminary injunctions enjoining the trustees from
disposing of the assets of LZ and MA had been denied (on 19 and
23 May 2005, respectively) but before the two judges decided about
Frontier’s ex parte request calling on the judges to exercise their
supervisory discretion in the bankruptcy proceedings pursuant to
Section 12 of the Czech Bankruptcy Act. Given that Frontier’s
request for the exercise of discretion by the court in a particular way
was not an adversarial proceeding, there was nothing improper or
objectionable in the two judges jointly meeting with the bankruptcy
trustees, who were not parties of the process commenced by
Frontier’s ex parte application, but who could be nonetheless
affected by it, and in ascertaining their views.” (emphasis in
original)

143

415.

8.3.3

417.

The Tribunal considers that Claimant’s loss flows primarily from Claimant’s conduct from
the outset of its dealings with MA in relation to the USA. Claimant never retained Czech
counsel to advise it on the drafting of the USA. Claimant advanced two out of the four
payments foreseen under the USA to MA before the USA was even concluded. It advanced
the entirety of the funds to MA without acquiring any security over the LET Assets. At no
time did Claimant properly file the security interest which would have given it a right to a
first secured charge over the LET Assets. The Tribunal considers that this was the principal
cause of Claimant's ultimate loss. Claimant argues that it was prevented from filing a first
secured charge over the LET Assets because it was never provided with a complete listing
of the LET Assets by Soska. Notwithstanding this, Claimant still chose to advance funds to
MA. A more prudent approach would have been to advance the funds to Davidova, the
LET trustee, on behalf of MA, on the condition of contemporaneous filings for the
registration of security interests in the LET Assets and for the loan payments, or a similar
process as provided by Czech law. The Tribunal also recalls that Claimant was on notice
that MA’s parent company was facing bankruptcy proceedings prior to signing the USA.
Further, the USA was structured so that Claimant would only ever enjoy a minority
shareholding in LZ. The Tribunal considers that it must have been evident to Claimant
from the beginning that its dealings with MA held a significant level of risk. In the face of
such risk, one might have expected a party in Claimant’s position to take measures to

protect its investment.

In light of this finding, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to determine whether the

actions of the bankruptcy trustees are attributable to the state.
Claim 3 - Failure of Czech Officials to Assist Claimant

Claimant’s General Position

Claimant’s third claim is that Czech officials could have exercised their authority to remedy
the treatment being received by Claimant but consistently failed to do so. Claimant frames
this claim as a breach of the general international law principle of good faith and a breach
of Respondent’s obligations to ensure fair and equitable treatment and to provide full

protection and security to Claimant’s investment.*!°

418. Claimant submits that because Respondent failed to enforce its own laws, Soska was able

to engage in the fraudulent conduct that ultimately destroyed Claimant’s investment,
including using Czech bankruptcy laws and pliable bankruptcy trustees to prevent Claimant
from securing control over the LET Assets. Claimant submits that this failure was
egregious because Claimant had brought these issues to the attention of Czech political and

judicial officials on numerous occasions, to no avail.*!°

Respondent asserts that Claimant has failed to articulate a basis for reviewing the exercise
of discretion by the Czech officials that would even be cognisable in comparative
administrative law.*!” Respondent contends that Claimant’s claim is based on an erroneous
hypothesis that the Tribunal has broad jurisdiction to “second guess” the exercise of

discretion by public officials on the basis of Treaty obligations.”

Respondent asserts that it would only be possible for Czech officials acting in strict
conformity with Czech law, to violate the Canada-Czech Republic BIT, if the relevant
Czech laws in these circumstances constituted per se a violation of the BIT. Respondent

asserts that Claimant has failed to engage with the relevant provisions of Czech law at all

and has limited itself to a series of vague assertions about relying upon Czech officials “in

good faith” because “it was consistently encouraged to place its trust in these officials”.°!

(i) The Criminal Complaint
Claimant’s Position

On 10 December 2002, Claimant addressed a criminal complaint to the Police Presidium of
the Police of the Czech Republic (the highest organ of Czech Police) in which it requested
that the Police prosecute Soska, Stefanek, and Joachimezyk for (i) the crimes of fraud; (ii)
breach of obligations in the administration of property of others; (iii) breach of mandatory

522 and, ina

rules of commercial conduct; (iv) forging and altering of monetary instruments;
later amendment to its original application, (v) suspicion of misappropriation of assets.°”*
In its complaint, Claimant referred to MA’s failure to comply with the USA by contributing
less than all of the LET Assets into LZ, its receipt in April 2002 from Soska of two
aggregate share certificates bearing an issue date of 18 December 2002, and the barring

of Claimant from the LZ General Meeting.

According to Claimant, the Czech officials charged with investigating the criminal
complaints were negligent and did not proceed in an even-handed manner. Claimant notes
that they (i) failed to obtain a proper translation of the USA; (ii) persistently refused to
interview representatives of Claimant, while interviewing Soska, Stefanek, and
Joachimezyk on multiple occasions; and (iii) refused to obtain legal advice on the law of
Alberta.*”> It is Claimant’s view that the police in Brno and Prague arbitrarily exercised
their discretion so as to effectively destroy the residual value of Claimant’s investment

rather than safeguard it.”

Contrary to Respondent’s assertion, Claimant argues that it did not mislead the police
regarding the fraudulent nature of the share certificates because the police knew that the
shares delivered to Claimant in April 2002 were post-dated.°””

Claimant denies Respondent’s allegations that Claimant’s objective in filing the criminal
complaint was to obtain leverage in its commercial dispute with Soska.°** Claimant insists
that its request for police assistance was fully justified given the fundamental breach of the
USA by its partner, and that the failure of the Czech police to conduct a fair, impartial, and

competent investigation breached Article III of the BIT.”

Respondent's Position

It is Respondent’s position that there was nothing objectionable in the investigation of the
criminal complaint by the police. Respondent points out that following his investigation,
the police investigator concluded that this was a commercial dispute beyond his mandate
and that the criminal liability as alleged by Claimant had not been established.”
Respondent disagrees with Claimant that the Czech police were amiss by not consulting

Alberta law to determine the correct interpretation of the USA.™*!

Respondent notes that Czech criminal law does not give the complainant a right to be heard
at the preliminary stages of the proceedings, but rather only provides that a claim will be
investigated and the complainant informed of the reasoned results. In this regard,

Respondent notes that all of these rights were met.**”

Respondent alleges that by filing its criminal complaint, Claimant was improperly seeking

leverage in its commercial dispute with Soska.**

Respondent submits that the criminal complaint should be dismissed due to Claimant’s own
conduct in making contradictory statements in three different judicial fora with respect to
the validity of the share certificates that were at the heart of Claimant’s criminal

complaint.*

Respondent notes that Claimant attributes little importance to this claim in its Post-Hearing

Memorial.**

Tribunal’s Analysis

Under this claim, Claimant alleges that the conduct of the Czech police authorities was so
lacking that it constituted a breach of the international obligation of good faith and
ultimately the fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security standards of the

BIT. The Tribunal rejects Claimant’s claim for the reasons that follow.

First, the evidence shows that the police undertook a considerable number of steps with
respect to Claimant’s complaints. For example, in response to Claimant’s 10 December
2002 motion to initiate the criminal prosecution of Soska, Stefanek, Joachimezyk, the
police conducted an investigation, which included the questioning of Soska and Davidova
and the inspection of various public notary records. The police issued a resolution on the

matter on 18 September 2003.°°

Claimant also filed a criminal complaint with the
Supreme Public Prosecutor on 20 November 2002*” and objected to the treatment of its
complaint on 20 March 2003. The Supreme Public Prosecutor forwarded Claimant’s

complaint to the High Public Prosecutor’s office to initiate supervision of the Regional

 

C-0296), p. 4. Respondent argues that the purpose of the criminal complaint, as stated by Sup, was
to paralyse the leading figures of LZ and negotiate with Mr. Joachimezyk, whereas Claimant argues
that its objective in filing the complaint was “to get the benefit of his bargain”. Transcript of

Public Prosecutor’s investigation.**

When Claimant filed an appeal regarding the Regional
Public Prosecutor’s Resolution on 30 September 2003, the Office of the Regional
Prosecutor reviewed the investigation and found that it had been “performed in accordance
with the law and that, within the framework of the investigation, sufficient material
evidence was gathered for an objective decision”. The Office of the Regional Prosecutor
dismissed Claimant’s appeal with detailed reasoning. Of note, the Office of the Regional
Prosecutor informed Claimant that it would conduct a further investigation into why certain

property in Uherské Hradi&té had not been listed among the assets of LZ.”

The Tribunal notes that Claimant specifically complains about the fact that it was not
interviewed during the investigation. Claimant’s complaint appears to be based on the
mistaken perception that a police investigation is an adversarial process which would
accord Claimant with a right to be heard. But it is not. The process is an investigative one
prescribed by the procedural requirements of Czech law. Claimant has not indicated what
procedural requirements of Czech law, if any, the police authorities allegedly breached.
The Tribunal notes that Respondent asserts that the requirements of Czech law have been
met. The Tribunal rejects Claimant’s assertion that it was entitled to be interviewed by the

police authorities and that their failure to do so may form a basis for a breach of the BIT.

The Tribunal also notes that according to Claimant, the shortcomings of the police
investigation are evidenced by their failure to obtain a translation of the USA and to seek
advice on the law of Alberta. The Tribunal does not find that the police authorities’ failure
to do so is problematic. As above, Claimant has not pointed the Tribunal to any breach on
the part of the police under Czech law based on these allegations. The Tribunal does not
accept that the police were under any duty to obtain a translation of the USA or to seek
advice on Alberta law in their investigations. Respondent has argued that the police
investigated Claimant’s complaint to the extent of their mandate, and when they reached
the conclusion that the matter was more a commercial dispute than a criminal dispute, they
concluded their investigations. Again, the Tribunal does not consider that this was an

inappropriate course of action.

. The Tribunal concludes that Claimant’s case falls short of establishing that the police

authorities displayed negligence so as to justify a finding of bad faith on their part. The
Tribunal also determines that Claimant has failed to establish that the police conduct was so
flawed and deficient that it constitutes a breach of Respondent’s fair and equitable

treatment obligation under the BIT.

. The Tribunal finds that Claimant had access to the available resources of the Czech

criminal system and that appropriate action was taken in response to its complaint.
Therefore, the Tribunal rejects Claimant’s claim that the actions of the police authorities

could justify a claim for breach of the full protection and security standard of the BIT.

. The Tribunal also notes that in any event Claimant has not shown a sufficient causal link

between its desired outcome in the criminal proceedings and the loss of its investment.
Claimant simply alleges that had its requests been properly considered, Soska would have
“Jost control over the joint venture before its assets were looted and before its business

prospects had dimmed.”*””

. Finally, the Tribunal turns to Respondent’s submission that Claimant’s criminal complaint

should be dismissed due to its own fraudulent misconduct in making contradictory
statements in three different judicial fora with respect to the validity of the share
certificates. Although the Tribunal accepts that the statements made by Claimant appear to
be inconsistent, the Tribunal does not accept that Respondent has established that they

demonstrate fraudulent behaviour on Claimant's part.

(ii) The Commercial Register Complaint

Claimant’s Position

. On 24 January 2003, Claimant filed an ex parte submission with the Regional Court

requesting that it amend the registrations of MA and LZ in the Commercial Register to the
effect that Soska, Joachimezyk, and Stefainek be immediately deleted as members of the

board of directors of LZ and MA by the court.“

membership of these individuals automatically ceased when Moravan — on whose boards
these individuals served — was declared bankrupt on 21 August 2002. Claimant relies on
Section 31(a)(1) of the Commercial Code which provides that:

The statutory organ, a member of the statutory organ or another

organ of a legal entity carrying on business may not be a person who

performed any such office in a legal entity against which a

bankruptcy order was adjudged. The same shall apply if a

bankruptcy petition against the legal entity was dismissed due to a
lack of assets.”

Claimant rejects Respondent’s argument that Moravan’s appeal against its bankruptcy
rendered the statutory prohibition of a person performing an office in a bankrupt
corporation inapplicable; there is no provision in Section 31(a) that suspends this legal

impediment while an appeal is pending.“?

Claimant notes that the appeal was eventually
rejected and Moravan remained in bankruptcy at all relevant times, thus Soska, Stefanek,

and Joachimezyk were statutorily impeded from serving as directors of MA and LZ.

Claimant disputes Respondent’s argument that one of the resolutions adopted at the LZ
General Meeting confirmed all three individuals in their positions on the LZ board and
“was adopted by 100% of the shareholders of LZ and present at that general meeting”.
According to Claimant, the only way one could accept that the resolution passed at the LZ
General Meeting was adopted by 100% of the shareholders was if one accepted as

legitimate Soska’s allegedly unlawful conversion of Claimant’s shares for his own use.**

Claimant disagrees with Respondent’s view that the Regional Court required further
information about the shareholdings of LZ and MA before it could legitimately make the

deletions that Claimant was requesting.™“°

Claimant refutes Respondent’s contention that the Commercial Register acted properly
because, upon receipt of Claimant’s petition, it inquired as to the state of affairs with MA
and was informed that Soska, Joachimezyk, and Stefanek had been confirmed as directors

by the sole (alleged by P to be a P ian entity known as
WIMCO). Claimant submits that the letter from the Commercial Register inquiring about
the state of affairs with MA was never answered and notes that there is no reason to believe
that 100% of the shares of MA were lawfully transferred to WIMCO, particularly since
Moravan was not a party to such transfer and because Orbes challenged any such

transfer.”

In addition to the above, according to Claimant, the legitimacy of Soska’s membership on
the board of directors of LZ and MA was immediately imperilled as a result of his own
personal bankruptcy on 27 February 2002." Claimant disputes Respondent’s suggestion
that while Soska was declared bankrupt, he was still lawfully entitled to hold office in MA
or LZ. Claimant contends that the effects of the declaration of bankruptcy against Soska in
2002 did not expire until his successful appeal decision was posted on the official bulletin

board of the court of first instance.”

Respondent's Position

Respondent disputes that either the bankruptcy of Moravan or that of Soska provided a
proper basis for invoking Section 31(a) of the Commercial Code.” Respondent argues that
in accordance with Section 31(a) of the Commercial Code, the termination of existing
directorships (in cases where an individual contemporaneously served on the board of a

bankrupt entity) is not automatic and that it can be overruled by a two-third majority vote.

Respondent asserts that the personal bankruptcy of Soska was (i) never finally adjudicated

because he successfully appealed against his bankruptcy declaration;*”' and (ii) irrelevant to

the entry in the Commercial Register because it only applied if the person in question

simultaneously performed such office in a legal entity which had gone bankrupt.”

Respondent submits that the status of Moravan was only finally adjudicated when its appeal
against bankruptcy was rejected on 8 March 2005.*? According to Respondent, under
Section 31(a)(4)(a) of the Commercial Code, up until that date it was not certain whether an

impediment existed for Soska, Stefanek, and Joachimezyk to retain their positions.

Respondent notes that Claimant was advised twice of the correct meaning of Section 31(a)
of the Commercial Code and of the steps taken by the court on the basis of its application,
first at personal meetings with the judges of the Regional Court of Brno in April 2003 and
second by letter dated 14 May 2003 from the Minister of Justice.*

Respondent refers to the LZ General Meeting at which, it argues, among other things, all
three individuals were confirmed in their positions on the board of directors of LZ, and this
resolution was adopted by 100% of the shareholders of LZ present at the meeting.**° Thus,
on a prima facie basis, Respondent explains that they retained their positions. Respondent
asserts that according to the Code of Civil Procedure (Section 200d(1)), the court may
record (or delete) information in the Commercial Register only in accordance with the law.
As the Regional Court did not have complete information it could not lawfully make the

deletions requested by Claimant.°””

560

561

the Commercial Register did not inform Claimant and Orbes of the steps taken in pursuance
of Claimant’s petition of 24 January 2003 and the information that it had obtained from
MA. Respondent argues that Claimant has argued that both Claimant and Orbes were
prevented from legally challenging the alleged transfer of shares in MA from Moravan to
WIMCO.** In Respondent’s view, the Commercial Register followed the standard
procedure for the consideration of petitions for the disqualification of directors in respect of
Claimant’s petition of 24 January 2003 by verifying whether reasons for the suggested
disqualification existed. It reviewed the minutes of the LZ General Meeting which were
filed with the Commercial Register and which confirmed Soska, Joachimezyk, and

359)

Stefanek as directors of LZ.*° With respect to MA, Respondent notes that the Commercial

Register, upon receipt of Claimant's position, inquired as to the state of affairs with MA
and was informed that Soska, Joachimezyk, and Stefanek had been confirmed as directors
by the sole shareholder, WIMCO. Respondent also notes that MA was simultaneously
notified that Moravan had been replaced as sole shareholder of MA by WIMCO.°?
Further, Respondent asserts that Claimant was notified about the status of its petition on
several occasions and that it is not true that Orbes or Claimant would have been unaware of
the changed ownership of MA.°°' Thus, Respondent concludes that the record does not

support Claimant’s allegation that Claimant or Orbes could have legally challenged the

Commercial Register dated 25 November 2003 (Letter from Commercial Register to Tutterova,
dated 25 November 2003 (Exhibit C-0178)). Respondent also notes that there is evidence on the
record that Orbes was aware of the share transfer to WIMCO no later than in December 2002 and
disputed the legality of that transfer, using his prerogative as bankruptcy trustee for Moravan to
include the shares of MA in the estate of Moravan, whereupon WIMCO had to sue in the bankruptcy
proceedings to preserve title to the shares. Respondent’s Post-Hearing Memorial, (83. Respondent

change of ownership of MA in favour of WIMCO if the corresponding share transfer had

been disclosed by the Commercial Register.*?

Respondent finally notes that Claimant devotes little attention to this claim in its Post-

Hearing Memorial.**

Tribunal’s Analysis

Claimant’s allegations under this section involve highly technical issues of Czech
commercial and bankruptcy law. The Parties have not pleaded the application of such
Czech commercial and bankruptcy law to the extent that this Tribunal is in a position to
review the actions of the Commercial Register. On the basis of the evidence presented, the
alleged conduct or omissions by Respondent did not reflect such arbitrary or inadequate
conduct as to amount to a breach of the fair and equitable and full protection and security
standards. Even if this Tribunal were to find that the actions of the Commercial Register
were contrary to Czech law, such a finding would not necessarily equate to a determination

of a breach of the BIT with reference to the standards elucidated in Section 8.2 above.

Even if the Commercial Register had granted Claimant’s application and struck Soska,
Joachimezyk, and Stefanek from the records as members of the board of directors of LZ
and MA, the Tribunal finds it significant that, Claimant would still have remained a
minority shareholder. Accordingly, in order to achieve the desired outcome, Claimant
would still have needed the assistance of the bankruptcy trustees and there is no evidence
that they would have received such assistance. Therefore, even if a prima facie breach of
the BIT had occurred here, which the Tribunal does not find to be the case, the Claimant

would have failed to prove that it caused any loss.

(iii) State Agencies as Creditors
Claimant’s Position

Claimant alleges that the Czech officials of the state agencies which were the largest
creditors of both MA and LZ (other than Claimant) failed to “exert pressure” on the

bankruptcy trustees to properly protect the interests of Claimant.

Claimant relies on two letters from the Ministry of Industry and Trade dated 26 July 2002
and 8 August 2002 (supra paragraph 76), in which the Deputy Minister of Industry and
Trade (i) referred to the transfer of Moravan’s debt to the CKA and commented that “the
State will have the possibility to enter into negotiations with [Soska] from its position as a
creditor. We suppose that the solutions will be found allowing investments of your client to
serve further on the original purpose”; and (ii) confirmed that he was authorised by the
Minister to arrange “direct negotiation” of the transfer of debt related to Moravan from
CSOB to the CKA.** Claimant characterises the outcome of its interactions with the

Ministry of Industry and Trade as an implied undertaking from the state to assist.°®

Contrary to Respondent’s suggestion that this was a matter involving private business
relationships, Claimant avers that the Ministry saw a way to use its control of CKA to serve
the original purpose of Claimant’s investment, and that with this proposal, Respondent

made it clear that what it proposed was directly attributable to the Czech state.*””

Claimant claims that the fact that the Czech state promised so much and delivered so little
was a breach of its duty of reasonable due diligence in the protection of Claimant’s

investment, and thus a breach of the BIT’s full protection and security standard.

Claimant submits that liability for an international wrong will generally not be attributed to

a state organ whose acts or omissions were committed in the course of a purely commercial

it could to provide relief and assistance to Claimant in its dealings with Soska.

undertaking.“ In order to determine whether such an activity is purely commercial,
Claimant explains that it is necessary to understand the political economy of the state in
question.*”° The Czech Republic, Claimant asserts, had only recently emerged from decades

of marginal existence as a one-party, centrally planned state."

The LET Assets had been purchased from an organ of the Czech state at the time of the
privatisation of the state-owned plant in the early 1990s, but these assets were not fully
privatised until purchased by Ayres Corporation in 1998.°” Through the CKA and its
predecessors, Claimant notes that the Czech state had been intimately involved in a
massive-scale privatisation of whole sectors of the Czech economy. Given this context and
the fact that the CKA was by the summer of 2002 the largest single creditor of Moravan,
Claimant asserts that there was every reason to expect that the CKA could render some

assistance to Claimant in order to wrest practical control of the LET Assets from Soska.°”*

That being said, Claimant asserts that it is not its position that it is necessary for the
Tribunal to attribute responsibility to the CKA, as the largest creditor of Moravan, in order
for the claim to succeed. Claimant explains that it is sufficient that the CKA was in a
position to assist Claimant. Claimant refers to the statement of the Deputy Minister of
Industry and Trade, Srba, of his desire to “negotiate” with Soska once the assignments from
CSOB to CKA were complete. Claimant rejects Respondent’s argument that no CKA
official would dare intervene in such a manner, on threat of criminal liability. Rather,

meetings with the Senior Director of the Ministry of Industry and Trade, Jarabica, Claimant

an act normally viewed as commercial, such as investing in, or making a loan to, a commercial
enterprise, takes on the characteristics of an act of state (e.g. when the Governments of the United
States of America, Canada and the Province of Ontario recently purchased approximately 9/10 of the
shares of General Motors Corporation, effectively nationalising it on a cooperative basis, but with a
stated intent to reorganise the corporation and have it issue new shares so that it could eventually be
returned to private sector control).

was entitled to expect that an arrangement could be made through Respondent's de facto

influence over Moravan as its primary creditor.°™*

Respondent's Position

Respondent asserts that it is not clear how the Czech state agencies that were also creditors
of MA and LZ were to “exert pressure” on the bankruptcy trustees to protect the interests of

Claimant, without breaching key provisions of Czech law.*”°

The respective positions of
the bankruptcy trustees and creditors in bankruptcy were defined in Czech law and
accepted by Claimant when it embarked on its transaction under the USA, Respondent
states. Czech law does not allow any creditor to interfere with the independence of the

bankruptcy trustee in its favour.*”°

Respondent asserts that the letters from the Ministry of Industry and Trade state that it
could not intervene in a private commercial dispute and that no intention, or promise, to
enter into negotiations with Soska regarding the USA can be inferred from the

7

communications.” Respondent notes that Deputy Minister Srba in fact fulfilled the

assurances he did provide, by arranging a meeting between Claimant and Jarabica and later

arranging for a meeting between Claimant and Gréningerova."™*

In addition, Respondent
asserts that there is no evidence of detrimental reliance upon the letters by Claimant and

that the letters cannot possibly be a source of legitimate expectations.*”

Respondent submits that the acts of the CKA are not attributable to the Czech state in

international law as long as it acted in accordance with its rights and obligations as a

Tribunal’s Analysis

Under this claim, Claimant is requesting this Tribunal to attribute the acts of Czech officials
to the state, and to find that their failure to fulfil implied undertakings constitutes a breach
of the state’s duty of reasonable due diligence in the protection of Claimant’s investment,
and thus a breach of the full protection and security standard of the BIT. Leaving aside the
question of attribution for the moment, this Tribunal has already set forth what it considers
to be Respondent’s duties under the full protection and security standard (see supra
paragraph 273), i.e. that the state is under an obligation to make a functioning system of

courts and legal remedies available to the investor.

Claimant argues that in light of the implied undertakings from the state to assist, it was
owed assistance. The Tribunal disagrees with Claimant’s characterisation of the statements
in the two letters from the Ministry of Industry and Trade dated 26 July 2002 and 8 August
2002. An examination of the text of these letters reveals that (i) the Ministry of Trade
expressly stated that it was not a party to the dispute referred to by Claimant; and, notably
(ii) that as the dispute concerned private subjects, the Ministry had “no possibility to
intervene”. The Ministry merely indicated that the state would have the possibility to enter
into negotiations with Soska from its position as a creditor. This was not an undertaking.

This was a signal to Claimant that there was a possibility that the state could negotiate. The

Respondent’s Post-Hearing Memorial, 96. Respondent explains that the CKA was acting as a
private creditor in the insolvency proceedings. Respondent also notes that in accordance with Article
8 of the ILC Articles, supra note 464, the CKA’s conduct is not directed or controlled by the Czech
state so long as it is maintaining its statutory independence from the Czech government. Respondent
notes that if the CKA had entertained Claimant’s demands, it would have stepped outside the
statutory boundaries of its role in insolvency proceedings and its acts would thus be attributable to
the state because it would be exercising a power that the other creditors would not possess.

possibility that the state could negotiate with Soska did not provide an adequate basis for

the Claimant to rely on some form of representation or expectation.“

In the second letter, the Czech Official indicated that “[wJith respect to the new facts
concerning the debts transfer to the [CKA] and in order to meet your request I was
entrusted by the Minister for Industry and Trade [...] to arrange their direct negotiation.
Consequently, I have charged the Senior Director of our Ministry [...] to meet your clients
in this matter.”*** The Tribunal does not consider these statements to constitute an implied

undertaking to assist Claimant.

The Czech Republic made a functioning system of courts and legal remedies available to
Claimant. Claimant availed itself of this system with only limited success. However, not
every failure to obtain redress is a violation of the principle of full protection and security.
The Tribunal is satisfied that the grounds put forward by Claimant under this claim do not

substantiate a finding of breach of the full protection and security obligation of Respondent.

To the extent that Claimant relies on these statements as creating legitimate expectations
that it would be assisted in its dispute with Soska by the state, the Tribunal finds that the
relevant statements do not exhibit the level of specificity necessary to generate legitimate
expectations. More importantly, as the Tribunal has already noted (see supra paragraphs
287-288), legitimate expectations are temporally tied to the date of making the investment.
They must have been in place at the time Claimant’s original investment was made. These
statements were made after Claimant had already invested in the Czech Republic and
therefore could not have generated legitimate expectations by Claimant vis-a-vis the state’s

treatment of its investment.***

The Tribunal also notes that when the statements in question were made, Moravan may not have
been the sole shareholder of MA, subject to Claimant’s allegations that the transfer to WIMCO was
illegal (this point is not conclusively substantiated by the record). Accordingly, once the receivables
relating to Moravan had been transferred from CSOB to the CKA, and the CKA had become a
creditor of Moravan, the CKA may not in fact have had a commercial relationship with Soska.

8.3.4 Claim 4 - Failure to Provide Means to Enforce Arbitration Awards

Claimant’s Position

469. Claimant’s formulates its fourth claim as follows:

Because Respondent’s legal system was manifestly inadequate for
the tasks required of it under applicable international law, it failed to
comply with Respondent’s international obligation to maintain an
effective means for the enforcement of an international tribunal’s
orders and award.**°

470. Claimant impugns the failure of the Czech judiciary to honour the Interim Award, and to

471.

enforce and recognise the Order on Security of the Final Award by invoking the public

policy exception under Article V(2)(b) of the New York Convention.

Claimant frames its claim in several ways: (i) the “[fJailure to honour a validly-issued
arbitral order or award, under the terms of the New York Convention, constitutes a breach of
the international principle of good faith, which is [...] reflected in Article 26 of the VCLT.
The principle of good faith is activated in this case because Article III:1 of the [BIT]
explicitly provides that “fair and equitable treatment” shall be provided in accordance with
“the principles of international law”; (ii) “the decisions and inaction of the Czech
judiciary in this case have ‘reduced to pointlessness’ one of the fundamental ‘favourable
conditions’ for investment relied upon by [Claimant] when it made its investment decision:
the availability of a judicial means of giving effective and immediate force to the orders
and awards of an international arbitral tribunal’”;*** (iii) that Respondent’s conception of its
“obligation” under Article V(2)(b) of the New York Convention is not consistent with the
object and purpose of the BIT, which is supposed to foster and sustain the development of a
consistent and predictable investment climate (including the “favourable conditions”
referred to in Article II of the BIT); and (iv) that Respondent failed to offer full

protection and security to Claimant by acting inconsistently with its obligation to make

international arbitral orders and awards effective within the Czech Republic as per Article

IL of the New York Convention.”

It is Claimant’s position that Articles IV and V of the New York Convention provide only

1,°°! and that it would be an

limited exceptions to the general rule established by Article IL
abuse of right, contrary to the general international law principle of good faith, for a state
party to the New York Convention to facilitate, encourage, or condone decisions by its
designated “competent authority” (normally a municipal court) that do not comport with the

exceptions found in Articles IV and V.°”

According to Claimant, the construction of the exceptions to recognition and enforcement
does not fall within the discretion of a municipal court; rather such courts must steadfastly
observe the proper meaning of those exceptions in good faith.”* If a controversy arises as
to whether the decision of a competent authority is consistent with the provisions of
Articles IV and V of the New York Convention, it is for an international tribunal, not the

state party, to decide if the state party has complied with the New York Convention.”

Claimant notes that the decisions of Hanzlikova and Bohééek demonstrate that Respondent
is “championing the absolute autonomy of even its lower-rung judicial officials to declare
any perceived inconsistency between an international tribunal’s award and a local

39595

regulation as being contrary to the ‘public policy’ of the Czech State.””” Claimant argues

that under Article 27 of the VCLT, “[a] party may not invoke the provisions of its internal

law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty”.

Claimant’ s Reply to Respondent’s Post-Hearing Memorial, 49.

Claimant’s Pre-Hearing Memorial, 137. Claimant notes that a breach of the New York Convention
engages the Czech Republic’s international responsibility, citing Saipem, supra note 254, {165 for
the proposition that a state’s invocation of provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure
to perform a Treaty is not permissible because the characterisation of an internationally wrongful act
is governed by international law, regardless of whether it is lawful by internal law.

Claimant argues that the Tribunal should be informed by the broad consensus that has been
forming over the past five decades on the part of practitioners and states, about how the
discretion granted to municipal courts to entertain requests for recognition and enforcement
should be exercised. Claimant argues that the consensus is that “the discretion of municipal
courts to a determination of whether the international public policy of a country would be
breached, rather than the ‘public policy’ of that country writ large, demonstrates that the
balancing of values on this issue has definitively come down in favour of supporting the
object and purpose of the various instruments that compose the international commercial

arbitration regime.”*””

It is Claimant’s position that local courts should exercise their
discretion in a manner consistent with the preferred view that the “public policy” at issue is
the international public policy of the host state, and not solely from within the context of

applicable municipal law.°*

Claimant referred to a Global Arbitration Review article entitled “Polish Court finds
arbitration agreement valid despite bankruptcy” published on 21 December 2009.*” That
article concerned the decision of the Warsaw Court of Appeals in the ongoing Vivendi-
Elektrim dispute that an LCIA Award was enforceable despite Polish law stating that a
bankrupt enterprise was precluded from participating in arbitration. According to the article
produced by Claimant, the Court found that, contrary to the earlier decision of the Warsaw
District Court, Articles V(1)(a) and V(2)(b) of the New York Convention did not provide
grounds for refusing enforcement of the Award. The report noted that “[t]he result paves

the way for Vivendi to participate as a creditor in the upcoming bankruptcy proceedings.”

Claimant submits that Respondent wrongfully characterises this claim as a denial of justice

claim when it is based on a breach of the Czech Republic’s obligation under the New York

Claimant’s Reply to Respondent’s Post-Hearing Memorial, $47, Tab 7. The decision itself was
never produced, doubtless because, as stated in the Global Arbitration Review article, the decision
was not publicly available. As a result, the Tribunal is unable to accord much weight, if any, to the
Court’s ruling. In any event, judging from the contents of the article, the decision would not provide
support for Claimant’s case since Vivendi argued that it had “the same right to have its claim
recognised against the bankruptcy company as held by other creditors.” That situation is clearly
distinguishable from the present case where Claimant seeks a prior or superior right to those rights
held by the remaining creditors.

Convention to recognise and enforce international commercial arbitration awards according

to international legal standards.*”

According to Claimant, Article 15 of the EC Regulation expressly provides that the effects
of insolvency proceedings on pending arbitrations are to be governed by the law of the
member state, in this case Sweden, in which the arbitration was pending. Therefore, it says,
the rights between Claimant and MA and LZ respectively, were to be determined

exclusively by the Stockholm Tribunal.°”

Respondent has argued that by operation of Sections 14(1)(e)-(f) and 15(1)(b) of the
Bankruptcy Law, Claimant could never have acquired a right to a first secured charge over
the assets of MA, or any right to separate satisfaction, given that its payments to acquire the
LET Assets were made within two months of the first petition for bankruptcy filed by the
Tora Group on 14 August 2001 (i.e. in April, June, and August 2001), and that the transfer
of the LET Assets from MA to LZ in October 2001 was made within the six-month period

before the filing of the Tora Group Petition.”

In response, Claimant submits that it is
undisputed that the Tora Group Petition was never recorded in the Commercial Register,
that its existence was unknowable to Claimant, and that the information only became public

at a much later date.°”

Claimant adds that at that time the Commercial Register was a
focus of criticism for its lack of transparency, delays, and even alleged corruption.“
Claimant argues that it cannot be criticised for not verifying the Commercial Register or
instructing a Czech lawyer to do so when it executed the USA as that would have been
futile; the Czech legal profession knew that such information was not recorded in the

Commercial Register then.°*

Further, Claimant disputes the purported retroactive effect of the Tora Group Petition and

asserts that Respondent’s reliance on this “retroactive effect” is itself a breach of the fair

and equitable treatment standard and, more broadly, further evidence of Respondent’s

breach of Article III of the BIT.“

Claimant argues that these transactions cannot be “forfeit from inception” and that the
bankruptcy officials could and should have exercised their discretion in a fair and equitable
manner, consistent with both good faith and the principles of international bankruptcy

policy reflected in World Bank and UNCITRAL authorities.”

The lack of transparency in the Commercial Register and a strict interpretation of the

Bankruptcy Act, Claimant argues, deprived Claimant of its investment.

Respondent's Position

Respondent asserts that, by this fourth claim, Claimant is mounting a direct challenge to the
decision of the Czech courts not to recognise and enforce the Order on Security of the Final

Award.

Respondent asserts that the Czech courts declined to give effect to this Order on Security in
the Final Award because doing so would violate Czech public policy by compelling the
bankruptcy trustees to disregard mandatory provisions of Czech bankruptcy law, namely,

the prohibition on the creation of security interests in the property of the debtor after

2005, the Czech Constitutional Court confirmed the correctness of the lower Czech courts’

invocation of the public policy exception.°”

Respondent argues that Claimant’s claim is inadmissible because the Tribunal must, in
order to dispose of this claim, make a ruling on the correctness of the Czech courts’
reliance upon the public policy exception in Article V(2)(b) of the New York Convention."
This would mean that the Tribunal would be acting as a court of appeal in respect of a
decision of the Czech courts or as an international court with supervisory jurisdiction over
contracting states’ obligations under the New York Convention. Respondent observes that
the drafters of the New York Convention gave the final word to the national competent
authorities on the issue of public policy as a bar to recognition and enforcement.°”
Respondent observes that the BIT does not allow an appeal of a municipal court decision
on a question of municipal law and that something more than an error of law must be
established to constitute a cause of action founded under the fair and equitable treatment

«613
standard, or otherwise.°!

Respondent also asserts that while it is widely accepted that “public policy” in Article
V(2)(b) of the New York Convention refers to international public policy, it is nonetheless a
reference to the particular national conception of international public policy that is relevant,

rather than to a conception of public policy that is in some way detached from the legal

614

system of the place where recognition and enforcement is being sought;”” thus the concept

of public policy in Article V(2)(b) includes the mandatory rules of the forum.*!°

ILA Interim Report, supra note 612: “Article V(2)(b) refers to the public policy of that country.”
Respondent contends that the drafters of the 1958 Convention did not seek overtly to attempt to
harmonise public policy or to establish a common international standard.

Fundamental rules of insolvency laws, including the principle of equal treatment of
creditors, Respondent asserts, are properly to be considered mandatory rules of public
policy and serve “the essential political, social or economic interests of the State”.°'°
Respondent submits that it has demonstrated that the courts of leading jurisdictions such as
Germany, France, and the United States have refused to recognise and enforce foreign
arbitral awards by invoking the public policy exception under Article V(2)(b) where they
have conflicted with the principle of the equality of creditors, and that such an approach is

also consistent with the EC Regulation.°"”

If the Tribunal is prepared to consider the merits of the decisions of the Czech courts on the
application of Article V(2)(b) of the New York Convention in respect of the Order on
Security in the Final Award of the Stockholm Tribunal, Respondent argues that the
substance of the claim would still not give rise to liability under the investment protection
standards set out in Article III of the BIT. As Claimant is seeking to impeach the decisions
of the Czech courts, its claim must be properly characterised as a claim of denial of justice.
It is a cardinal rule of the international law on denial of justice that erroneous decisions of
national courts on questions of domestic law do not involve the international responsibility

immovable and movable property situated in the Czech Republic as the /ex situs;*! (ii) that
Claimant did not have perfected security interests when bankruptcy proceedings were

commenced in respect of MA and LZ;°™ (iii) that the mandatory rules of Czech law
prohibit the recognition of security interests over the debtor’s property after the

justified in giving effect to Czech mandatory rules (i.e. the Bankruptcy Act Section

thus subject to registration under section 396 of the Companies Act, 1985, c. 6 (Exhibit R-0105) (i.e.

title to all such property under the USA and Promissory Note since July 2001, but that at
the time of the commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings in relation to MA and LZ,
Frontier did not have a perfected security interest over such property.°?> The Stockholm
Tribunal recognised in the Final Award that it could not create such a security interest, and
that that could only be achieved through a subsequent execution of further contractual
documentation between Claimant, MA and LZ in accordance with Czech law and the future
perfection of the security interest so created. The Order on Security in the Final Award did

not in and of itself create or perfect Claimant’s security interest.°°°

Accordingly, Respondent submits, it might be said that there was no true conflict between
the Order on Security in the Final Award and the mandatory rules of Czech bankruptcy law
to the extent that the Stockholm Tribunal was ordering the bankruptcy trustees of MA and
LZ to perform certain acts to the extent possible under the applicable Czech law.” By
contrast, to the extent that the Stockholm Tribunal was purporting to order the bankruptcy
trustees of MA and LZ to perform certain acts regardless of the applicable Czech law on
bankruptcy and the EC Regulation, which Respondent contends is very unlikely, any aspect
of the Final Award in conflict with Czech mandatory rules and EU law cannot be
recognised and enforced in the Czech Republic by virtue of Article V(2)(b) of the New

«628
York Convention.

Respondent notes that under Section 15(1)(b) of the Bankruptcy Law, the fact that the Tora
Group filed a petition in mid-2001 caused the acts of MA in the 6 months prior to the filing
of that petition to become ineffective against the creditors. In other words, any undertakings
under the USA became unsecured claims in bankruptcy as they had not been executed by

the time the Tora Group Petition was filed.°”

In response to Claimant’s argument that the Tora Group Petition was not discoverable,
Respondent responds that (i) Claimant never verified the Commercial Register itself or
instructed a Czech lawyer to do so at the time it executed the USA or thereafter, so this
cannot be a case of detrimental reliance; (ii) Claimant never did register a security interest
over the LET Assets so it never had a security interest that could fall within the voidable
preference period; (iii) the existence of the Tora Group Petition could have been ascertained
by checking the court records at the corporate seat of MA in Brno, which would have been
standard due diligence for any Czech lawyer; (iv) Jewitt was on notice of the bankruptcy of
MA’s parent company, Moravan, prior to executing the USA; and (v) the fact that such
information was not recorded in the Commercial Register at the time was known to the
Czech legal profession.” Respondent further notes that Czech law, as well as other legal
systems, extends the prohibition back in time to make any dispositions relating to the
debtor’s property void or voidable if executed within a certain period before the

commencement of bankruptcy proceedings."

Respondent refutes Claimant’s characterisation of its reference to the Tora Group Petition
as an argument that Claimant’s entitlement to a first secured charge was destroyed ab initio
by operation of Czech law.*” Respondent explains that Claimant never had a first secured
charge and that it was only in a position to compel MA to register a secured charge when
the Final Award was released, by which time it was too late as LZ and MA were already

subject to bankruptcy proceedings.°*

In response to Claimant’s argument that when applying Article V(2)(b) of the New York
Convention, the “object and purpose” of the New York Convention must be taken into
account, i.e. the promotion of the use of international commercial arbitration and a means

of enhancing the security, predictability and growth of international commerce, Respondent

Respondent’s Post-Hearing Memorial, 138. Respondent notes that this was the system in place and
that it was applied without discrimination to all legal entities incorporated in the Czech Republic.
Respondent argues that it cannot be argued that the BIT requires a specific type of system for the
registration of bankruptcy petitions, otherwise the failure to adopt the type of registration system that
operates elsewhere (such as in Canada) would be a per se violation of the BIT.

argues that Claimant has ignored the reality that a functioning insolvency regime forms an

indispensable basis for a “secure, predictable and growing international commerce”.

With respect to Claimant's allegations concerning the failure of the Courts with respect to
the Interim Award, Respondent posits that the New York Convention does not extend to the
recognition and enforcement of injunctions and, as a matter of fact, Claimant never sought

enforcement of the Interim Award in the Czech Republic.°*

Respondent notes that the monetary relief claims against MA and LZ in the Final Award
were recognised and enforced by Czech courts under the New York Convention based on
Claimant’s applications, subject to the limitations applicable to them in bankruptcy.°” In
accordance with applicable Czech bankruptcy law Claimant registered those claims against
the bankruptcy estates of LZ and MA and they now await satisfaction from the proceeds of

the bankruptcy proceedings.°”

Respondent argues that proper consideration should be given to the EC Regulation which
applies in a formal sense to the bankruptcy of MA, and is a source of guidance in relation to
the international legality of the Czech legal system’s treatment of MA and LZ in
bankruptcy and to the proper interpretation of Article III of the BIT.°* Respondent submits
that it (i) represents a consensus among European states on the proper approach to

jurisdiction and choice of law in respect of bankruptcy, and (ii) forms part of the public

Respondent asserts that in accordance with the EC Regulation, the “centre of main
interests” of MA and LZ are in the Czech Republic and the Czech courts “shall have
jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings” pursuant to Article 3(1) of the EC Regulation.
Article 17(1) of the EC Regulation, as explained by Respondent, sets out that the moment
the bankruptcy proceedings were opened in relation to MA, the legal effects of those
bankruptcy proceedings under Czech law had to be recognised in Sweden and thus by the
Stockholm Tribunal. Further, Respondent notes that Articles 4 and 8 of the EC Regulation
make clear that Czech law applied exclusively to the question of whether the bankruptcy
trustees were entitled to register a security interest in favour of Claimant over the assets of
MA and LZ after bankruptcy proceedings had been commenced. Thus, Respondent
concludes, it was impossible for Respondent’s courts to give effect to the Order on Security

in the Final Award in respect of the assets of MA and LZ.”

Respondent also notes that the EC Regulation only applied ratione temporis to the
bankruptcy of MA but not to the bankruptcy of LZ.“' Respondent argues that the
attestation as to the legal effect and enforceability of the Final Award by the Chairman of
the Stockholm Tribunal is irrelevant because while the Chairman confirmed that the formal
requirements for the issuance of a binding award under Swedish law had been complied

with, he did not purport to give a legal opinion on a question that was never raised before

him.

Bankruptcy Act, supra note 117, but did not receive any submissions (from either side) on the
substantive effect of the insolvency proceedings on the matters in dispute as a matter of Czech law or
Swedish law or any other law. Respondent finds it significant that Claimant’s counsel drafted the
operative part of the Final Award and specifically requested a ‘declaration’ that it had a secured
charge. Ultimately, Respondent notes, the Tribunal amended the text to the effect that Claimant was

a

Respondent argues that in order to appear on the “short list” (or “separate creditors”, as
described in the Bankruptcy Act), a creditor must, no less than two months prior to the
filing of the bankruptcy petition, have registered its pledge as a right in rem in accordance

with Czech law.?

In order to have a claim so secured by a lien (a pledge) as a right in
rem, such pledge had at the time to be registered (perfected) in accordance with Czech law.
Respondent submits that Jewitt was aware that Claimant had to take steps in the Czech
Republic to register its security interest, but that no Czech lawyer had been instructed to
procure the registration of the security interest and that there is no evidence on the record
that Matu8ik or Jewitt requested the required documentation from Soska.“* Respondent
argues that the Czech Republic is in no way responsible for Claimant’s lack of diligence in
duly perfecting its security interest.“* Thus, without compliance with the relevant
provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, Respondent concludes that there can be no discretion on

the part of the bankruptcy trustees to accord Claimant preferred-creditor status.™°

Tribunal’s Analysis

At the crux of this claim is the refusal by the Czech courts to recognise and enforce all of

the orders contained in the Interim and Final Awards rendered by the Stockholm Tribunal.

As noted above at paragraph 363, Claimant has also raised this complaint with respect to
the failure of the bankruptcy judges and trustees to give effect to the Interim and Final
Awards when requested to do so. The Parties’ submissions in this regard are summarised at

paragraphs 339-358 and will be dealt with under this section.

First, it is useful to review the factual background leading to (i) the failure by the

bankruptcy trustees and the bankruptcy judges to give effect to the Interim and Final

“entitled” to a secured charge, but was careful to carve out any questions relating to the bankruptcy
of LZ or MA.

Respondent’s Post-Hearing Memorial, 129; Bankruptcy Act, supra note 117. Respondent notes that
Section 28 of the Bankruptcy Act provides that a creditor must have its claim secured “by lien and
the right to retain a thing, or by limitation of the right to transfer real estate, or by transfer of a right
under Section 553 of the Civil Code, or by assignment of a receivable under Section 554 of the Civil
Code.”

Awards, and (ii) refusal by the Czech courts to recognise and enforce the entirety of the

Final Award.

On 27 February 2004, Claimant submitted the Interim Award to the District Courts in
Uherské Hradisté and Zlin.“” In its letters, Claimant suggested that “any and all executions
of judgment held against [MA and LZ] be terminated or interrupted pursuant to §268 of the
Civil Procedure Code” and requested that it “be kept informed of such judgment executions
in order to be able to file the respective actions for exemption from judgment execution”.
Claimant did not receive a response from the District Courts in Uherské Hradi&té and Zlin

in this regard.

On 27 February 2004, Claimant also submitted the Interim Award to Bohaéek in respect of
the bankruptcy of LZ. Claimant requested that the Regional Court issue an interim
injunction requesting that Sladek prevent disposition of any assets of LZ and open

receive a response from Bohdéek in this regard. A preliminary bankruptcy trustee had

already been installed in LZ.”

Also on 27 February 2004, Claimant filed a motion at the Regional Court for appointment
of an interim receiver in respect of MA enclosing the Interim Award. As for LZ, Claimant
requested that the Regional Court enjoin all parties from any disposition of the assets of
MA and open proceedings on the nullity of certain sales contracts and other acts.*” On
19 April 2004, the Regional Court granted Claimant’s 27 February 2004 request for
appointment of an interim receiver, but did not address or mention Claimant’s request that
the Regional Court open proceedings on the nullity of certain sales contracts and other

acts. The Regional Court noted that Claimant was not part of the bankruptcy

proceedings at the time. In substantiating the need to appoint a preliminary trustee (interim

other creditors, in particular the Workers Union, in respect of which it was “clear that [MA

was] not fulfilling [its] obligations in the mater [sic] of workers compensation”.

On 28 February 2005, Claimant submitted the Final Award (including a certified translation

judge overseeing the MA bankruptcy proceedings, Claimant expressly requested that the
Final Award be recognised: “I am herewith requesting you to exercise your authority and
ensure that the above Arbitral Award be recognised, namely by the bankruptcy trustee.” A
similar request was made to the bankruptcy judge overseeing the LZ bankruptcy

proceedings.

On 31 March 2005, the bankruptcy trustee for LZ responded to Claimant’s correspondence
of 28 February 2005, stating that the recognition and enforcement of the Final Award could

contravene public policy.°*

On 8 April 2005, Vala informed Claimant that the creditors’ committee concluded that the
Final Award “orders the bankruptcy trustee to effect performance that is impermissible

according to domestic law.”°**

On 23 May 2005, the court supervising the bankruptcy proceedings involving LZ denied
Claimant’s motion for an interim injunction. In its decision, it added that recognition and
enforcement of the Final Award should be denied pursuant to s. 39(a) and (c) of the
Arbitration Act “if the award is not legally effective and enforceable pursuant to domestic

law and the award would contravene public policy.”

At the 1 June 2005 meeting, the bankruptcy trustees and judges agreed that the Final Award
“could not be respected in view of the provisions of §39, letter b) and §31, letter f) of Act
No. 216/1994 Coll. on bankruptcy proceedings and the enforcement of arbitral awards,
because it adjudicates the party to perform acts that are impossible or illegal under domestic
law and because, according to Article V.2B) and Decree No. 74/1959 Coll. on the
Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, the
recognition or enforcement of the Award would contradict the public policy of the Czech

Republic.”

On 2 June 2005, the court in the MA bankruptcy proceedings rejected Claimant’s motion to

cancel the joint tender, and stated, in part, that:

The court leans towards the trustee’s argument stating that according to
Article V.2. letter b) of Decree No. 74/1959 Coll. on the Convention on
the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Awards, Award
recognition and enforcement can also be denied if the respective body
of the country in which the award is to be enforced finds that award
enforcement would contradict that country’s law.

Pursuant to Act No. 216/1994 on arbitration proceedings and the
arbitration award enforcement, the court will cancel an award based on
a motion of each of the parties if the award orders the party to perform
an act which is impracticable or illegal pursuant to the domestic law
(see Section 31, letter (f)). For this reason, the recognition or
enforcement of a foreign award will be denied (see Section [39], letter

b)).

It is clear from the above that an Award ordering the bankruptcy trustee
to grant secured charges against the bankrupt’s assets to the benefit of a
creditor, cannot be enforced because such act would contradict to [sic]
the Bankruptcy and Composition Act and as such it would be generally
illegal and in breach of this country’s public order.°”

On 9 June 2005, the Regional Court also denied Claimant’s application to cancel the joint
tender in the LZ bankruptcy proceedings. The Regional Court addressed the issue of the

recognition and enforcement of the Final Award, without detailed analysis, stating:

Given the fact that the Arbitral Tribunal Award contradicts the
Bankruptcy and Composition Act and with reference to the provisions

of Section 39 of Act No. 39, letter (b) and Section 31 letter f) of Act
No. 216/1994 Coll., the court has decided as stated above.*

On 16 June 2005, Claimant filed four motions before two district courts and one municipal
court requesting the recognition and enforcement of the Final Award, one each in respect of

MA, LZ, and Hajtmar and Sladek, as set out below:
¢ Enforcement proceedings against bankruptcy trustee for MA

The application for recognition and enforcement of the Final Award against Hajtmar was
denied and the outcome was affirmed on appeal and Claimant’s subsequent extra-ordinary
appeal to the Czech Supreme Court was denied.’ The court of first instance and the
appellate court both refused the recognition and enforcement of the Final Award on the
basis of Article V(2)(b) of the New York Convention as contrary to the public policy of the
Czech Republic, albeit for different reasons. As noted earlier, the appellate court held in

particular:

It would be contrary to Czech laws as well as public policy in the Czech
Republic, and would be contrary to the Constitution as well as all other
rules in effect not only in the Czech Republic but also in other signatory
countries to the New York Convention, for an obligation to be imposed
on someone in contravention of his rights and obligations and in
contravention of the laws and public policy of the country in which the
enforcement (execution) is to be implemented. It is not possible to
demand that a bankruptcy trustee breach the obligations imposed on
him/her by the bankruptcy law. Moreover, in view of the foregoing it is
also not possible to order a bankruptcy trustee to ensure a priority ranking
for the entitled party in bankruptcy proceedings. [...]

In conclusion it can be stated that the submitted execution title
completely fails to respect the mandatory rules of Czech laws, has a
tendency to unacceptably interfere with the powers, authority and
independence of a bankruptcy court, attempts to force it to take steps that
are contrary to Czech laws, principle [sic] of justice and equal status of
parties in court proceedings. In the appellate court’s opinion, in this case
there are grounds for not recognizing the submitted execution title as
enforceable on the territory of the Czech Republic when one applies
Article V(2)(b) of the [New York Convention].“

The appellate court further concluded that, as a matter of Czech law, the Final Award was
not sufficiently specific and therefore not enforceable and that MA’s bankruptcy trustee,
Hajtmar, was the wrong respondent for Claimant’s petition to recognise and enforce the
award.’ Claimant’s extra-ordinary appeal from the appeal decision was denied as

inadmissible by the Supreme Court of the Czech Republic.*

¢ Enforcement proceedings against bankruptcy trustee for LZ

The application for recognition and enforcement of the Final Award against the bankruptcy
trustee for LZ, Sladek, was also dismissed by the Municipal Court in Brno as contrary to
Czech public policy. The court’s reasoning was similar to the analysis adopted by the court

3

of first instance in the proceedings against Hajtmar.°* Claimant did not appeal this

decision.

¢ Enforcement proceedings against LZ

In the proceedings against LZ for recognition and enforcement of the Final Award,
Claimant had initially obtained an execution order. This order was revoked on appeal on
25 August 2006.%° The Municipal Court in Brno rested its decision on the same public

policy grounds it had set out in its earlier decision dealing with the MA proceedings.

Following the dismissal of the enforcement proceedings in the lower court and an appeal by
Claimant, the Regional Court in Brno granted partial recognition of the Final Award against

LZ on 30 March 2007.’ However, the dismissal of the enforcement proceedings in

respect of the accounting for all the property of LZ and the grant of a first secured charge
against the LET Assets by entering into a pledge agreement with Claimant, as ordered by
the Final Award, were upheld. In its reasons, the court referred to the public policy
considerations in its 25 August 2006 decision in the same matter. According to
Respondent, as at 20 July 2009, a further extraordinary appeal filed by Claimant on
21 June 2007 to the Supreme Court of the Czech Republic was still pending.°*

¢ Enforcement proceedings against MA

As noted earlier, in the recognition and enforcement proceedings against MA, the District
Court in Zlin denied Claimant’s petition on 25 January 2006. The court considered the

Final Award not to be enforceable on procedural grounds.” On appeal, the Regional Court
in Brno partially reversed the lower court decision in a decision dated 15 February 2007.°"
In substance, the decision parallels the ruling of the same court in the enforcement
proceedings against LZ. The enforcement of the first three orders of the Final Award was
denied; the enforcement of the payment orders Nos. 4, 7, 8 and 10 was granted. In respect

of the former, the court held as follows:

In relation to the company [MA] [...] the principal question is how
specifically the holding of this Arbitral Award is to be incorporated
into proceedings pursuant to the provisions of Act 120/2001 Coll. in
compliance with the Czech legal order. Imposing an obligation on a
person that would violate such person’s rights and obligations and
contradict the legal and public order of the country in which such act
(an execution) is to be carried out would indeed contravene the legal
and public order of the Czech Republic, its Constitution and all legal
standards applicable not only for the Czech Republic but also for other
signatory states of the New York Convention. A bankruptcy order has
been adjudicated against the assets of [MA] [...] Pursuant to the
provisions of § 14, para 1, letter e) of Act 328/1991 Coll., the
Bankruptcy and Composition Act, as amended, it shall be impossible to
execute a judgment (execution order) relating to assets that are part of a
bankrupt’s estate and to acquire the right to separate satisfaction from
any such assets. We cannot ask the Bankrupt to violate his obligations
given the Bankruptcy Act.

As the Appellate Court has already stated several times in the rationale
of its rulings, the submitted execution title fails in this part to respect
the mandatory standards of the Czech legal order; it tends unduly to
encroach on the authority, competence and independence of the
Bankruptcy Court and attempts to force it into taking steps that
contravene the Czech legal order and the principle of justice and
equality of the parties in judicial proceedings.

Hence, in the Appellate Court’s opinion, the discussed part of the
execution title provides reasons for non-executability of the submitted
execution title in the Czech Republic invoking Article V point 2, letter
b) of the [New York Convention].

On 28 May 2007, Claimant filed an extraordinary appeal against the Regional Court of

Brno’s decision of 15 February 2007 to the Supreme Court.°”'

According to Jewitt, “a
ruling was issued on March 27, 2009, which again rejected the right to separate
(preferential) satisfaction”.°”” However, according to Respondent, as of 20 July 2009, the

Supreme Court’s decision was still pending.*”

The Order for Security in the Final Award directing the bankruptcy trustees to grant “a first
secured charge against the LET ASSETS and all of the property of [MA] of every nature
and kind wheresoever located”,°™ was found by the Czech Courts to be (i) contrary to the
Bankruptcy Act because it purported to accord to Claimant an exceptional status’ after
bankruptcy had been declared; and (ii) contrary to Czech public policy because it was in

+3676

disregard of the “equality of rights of the bankrupt’s creditors””’” such that the Courts were

justified in refusing its enforcement under Article V(2)(a) of the New York Convention.”

The Tribunal notes that the refusal to enforce the second specific performance obligation —

the accounting of assets — was based on more technical grounds, such as the impossibility

°8 and the lack of

of obliging the trustee to trace the assets of a third party (i.e. LET),
concordance between the wording of Claimant’s request and the Final Award.” With
regard to the orders of the Stockholm Tribunal relating to (i) the obligation to pay interest
on the loan under the USA; (ii) the damages award in the amount of USD 600,000 for
Claimant’s lost business opportunity, (iii) the arbitration costs in the amount of
USD 926,038.55; and (iii) Claimant’s share of the advance payments to cover the fees and
costs of the arbitrators in the amount of USD 245,124.53, these claims were ultimately

upheld.

The Tribunal observes that the Interim Award contained an order enjoining MA and LZ
from breaching the USA and the Promissory Note and from any further selling, trading,
pledging, encumbering, or otherwise disposing of the LET Assets. As noted above, a
preliminary trustee, whose authorisation is required for the disposition of the bankrupt’s

assets,°*°

was already installed in respect of LZ at the time Claimant submitted the Interim
Award to the Regional Court. A preliminary trustee was installed pursuant to Claimant’s
request in respect of MA, even if it was not part of the bankruptcy proceedings at that time.
The Tribunal considers that whether Claimant's requests that the Regional Court
immediately open proceedings in respect of any sales contracts or other acts of MA and LZ
were properly filed is a matter of Czech law. The Tribunal also considers that these
requests were not clearly connected to the terms of the Interim Award. With respect to
Claimant’s letters to the District Courts in Uherské Hradi8té and Zlin, the Tribunal
considers that Claimant merely suggested that all judgment executions be terminated and
requested that it be kept updated. Claimant had not indicated on what basis it would have a
right to be updated and, even if there was such a right, has not shown that the District
Courts neglected to keep it informed of judgment executions, if any. The Tribunal also
accepts Respondent’s point that the relief sought by Claimant with respect to the Interim
Award sought to enjoin third parties, whereas the Interim Award itself addressed only MA
and LZ.*' Accordingly, the Tribunal is unable to conclude that the alleged inaction of the
Regional Court and the District Courts in Uherské Hradisté and Zlin constituted a failure to

properly give effect to the Interim Award.

As to the Final Award, the Tribunal rejects Respondent’s argument that this Tribunal does
not have the power to review the decision of a national court’s conception of the public
policy exception under the New York Convention. The Tribunal’s role under this claim is to
determine whether the refusal of the Czech courts to recognise and enforce the Final Award
in full violates Article III(1) of the BIT. In order to answer this question, the Tribunal must
ask whether the Czech courts’ refusal amounts to an abuse of rights contrary to the
international principle of good faith, i.e. was the interpretation given by the Czech courts to
the public policy exception in Article V(2)(b) of the New York Convention made in an
arbitrary or discriminatory manner or did it otherwise amount to a breach of the fair and

equitable treatment standard.

Article V(2)(b) of the New York Convention gives a competent authority in the country
where recognition and enforcement is sought the discretion to refuse the recognition and
enforcement of an arbitral award if the competent authority finds that the recognition or
enforcement of the award would be “contrary to the public policy of that country”. In the
present case, this refers to the public policy of the Czech Republic. It is widely accepted
that while the reference to “public policy” in Article V(2)(b) of the New York Convention
refers to international public policy, it is nonetheless a reference to the particular national
conception of international public policy that is relevant rather than to a conception of
public policy that is in some way detached from the legal system at the place where

recognition and enforcement is sought.”

The Czech courts concluded that the full recognition and enforcement of the Final Award
would have been contrary to Czech public policy. In regard to this decision, it is not
necessary for this Tribunal to determine whether the findings of the Czech courts meet the
applicable standard of international public policy, or to determine the precise contents of
that standard. States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in determining what their own

683

conception of international public policy is.""’ This Tribunal determines that it is sufficient

to examine whether the conclusion reached by the Czech courts applied a plausible

Report on Public Policy as a Bar to Enforcement of International Arbitral Awards (London, 2000)

interpretation of the public policy ground in Article V(2)(b) of the New York Convention.
Put another way, was the decision by the Czech courts reasonably tenable and made in

good faith?

The Tribunal notes that other national courts and some academic writers have found that
the equality of creditors in bankruptcy proceedings and the equitable and orderly
distribution of assets are public policy principles sufficient to refuse the enforcement of
arbitral awards under the New York Convention. The Tribunal refers to decisions of the
French Cour de Cassation and the German Bundesgerichtshof where, in the context of
enforcement of an arbitral award, the equal treatment of creditors (or some variant of that
formulation) was determined to be an expression of public policy.“ In one of its decisions

of 20 December 2005, the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic noted that “legal

See e.g. Mandataires judiciaires associés v. International Company for Commercial Exchanges, 6
May 2009, Cour de Cassation, case no. 509 in B. Derains & Y. Derains, Digest by ITA Board of
Reporters (Kluwer Law International), in which an award rendered after a declaration of bankruptcy
ordering payment by the bankrupt breached international public policy (“ordre public international”)
— asserting that any award must be limited to a determination of the amount of debt; German Federal
Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof), 29 January 2009 in R.H. Kreindler, Digest by ITA Board of
Reporters, where the Bundesgerichtshof reversed the finding of the lower court that enforcement of
two arbitral awards ordering the payment of money that had been rendered while the respondent was
in bankruptcy would be contrary to German domestic public policy — the Bundesgerichtshof ruled
that the awards should have been interpreted as determining that the claims should be filed along
with other creditors’ claims but nonetheless asserted that the equitable and collective satisfaction of
creditors in an insolvency proceeding was part of public policy (Exhibit R-0170); Société SARET c/
SBBM, Cour de cassation (Ch. commerciale), 4 février 1992, Rev. Arb. (1992), p. 663, Commentary
J-H. Moitry, where the principle of equality among creditors was considered to be part of French
domestic and international public policy, and the violation of this principle was the reason for the
annulment of the arbitral award (as cited in P. Fouchard, Arbitrage et faillité [Arbitration and
Bankruptcy], 3 Revue de l'arbitrage 480, 481 (1998) (Exhibit R-0106) supra note 615); see also, e.g.
Lazic, Insolvency Proceedings and Commercial Arbitration (The Hague: Kluwer Law International,
1998), p. 305 [“Lazic”]: “some provisions of insolvency laws may have to be observed in order to
ensure validity of the award. These are provisions intended to preserve the basic principles of
insolvency law, such as the principle of ‘equal treatment of creditors’ [...], violation of which may
be considered as contrary to public policy.” (Lazic, also referred to in S. Kroll, Chapter 18:
Arbitration and Insolvency Proceedings - Selected Problems in L. MISTELIS & J. LEW (EDS.)
PERVASIVE PROBLEMS IN INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION 358, 359 (2006) (Exhibit R-0107)). It may
be noted that the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency of 1997, provides in
paragraph (1)(b) of Article 20, “Effects of recognition of a foreign main proceeding”, that following
the recognition of a foreign insolvency proceeding that is a foreign main proceeding, the execution
against the debtor’s assets is stayed (UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency of 1997,
listed as Appendix IV of I. FLETCHER, INSOLVENCY IN PRIVATE INTERNATIONAL LAW (2005)
(Exhibit R-0099)). The Legislative Guide on Insolvency Law, published by UNCITRAL in 2004,
Recommendation 46 (p. 101), only addresses arbitrations in the context of Article 20(1)(a),
recommending that arbitrations be included in the stay of “individual actions or individual
proceedings concerning the debtor’s assets, rights obligation and _ liabilities.” (Exhibit R-0157,
Exhibit C-0361).

685

authorities and jurisprudence in the United States likewise ruled on the public order
exclusion in relation to the basic principles of equality of creditors in bankruptcy

proceedings, i.e. for the same reasons applied in this case by the Czech ordinary court”.°**

While these authorities may be distinguished from the present case, and the question
generally has not yet received adequate treatment such that any firm conclusions can be
drawn, they do lend support to the integrity of the approach of the Czech courts. Thus, in
terms of the substantive law result, the interpretation of the international public policy of
the Czech Republic adopted by the Czech courts is reasonably tenable. As far as the
alleged violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard pursuant to Article III of the
BIT is concerned, this Tribunal concludes that there is no indication that the courts
determining Claimant’s requests for the recognition and enforcement of the Final Award
acted arbitrarily, discriminatorily, or in bad faith. Claimant’s requests were entertained by
four levels of courts and Claimant had several opportunities to submit legal arguments on
the proper interpretation and application of the exceptions to the recognition and

enforcement of the Final Award established under Article V of the New York Convention.

There is another reason why Claimant’s case in this area ought not to be sustained. In the
present case, Claimant’s central claim was that it should receive preferential treatment (a
first secured charge) on the strength of the Stockholm Award. This would have given it
preference over other creditors who had participated and complied with a broad scheme
which ensured the equal treatment of creditors. Inevitably, this would have worked to the
detriment of the other creditors in the bankruptcy proceedings. In fact, it would have
defeated the right of all the other creditors given the size of Claimant’s claim and the
limited assets available. The full enforcement of the Stockholm Award would have
seriously affected the position of the other creditors who had no part in the Stockholm

proceedings and had never consented to them. The Tribunal considers that this

Resolution of Constitutional Court, dated 20 December 2005 (Exhibit R-0018), 4. The Court refers
to S. Hutchinson, Nonrecognition of Post-Bankruptcy Arbitration: Victrix Steamship Co. v. Salen
Dry Cargo A.B., 22 Int'l L. 1183 (1988). In Victrix Steamship Co. v. Salen Dy Cargo A.B., 825 F.2d
709, 711 (2d Cir. 1987) (Exhibit R-0156), which involved the recognition and enforcement of a
foreign award (London), the Court of Appeals (Second Circuit) found that enforcement of both the
London arbitral award obtained after bankruptcy and the British judgment on the award would
conflict with the strong public policy of ensuring equitable and orderly distribution of local assets of
a foreign bankrupt (714). Accordingly, the Court refused enforcement of the London award (and the
British judgment on the award).

consideration helps to support the point that the Czech courts’ interpretation of the notion

of “public policy” under the New York Convention was not unreasonable or impossible.

Claimant also claims “such other Legal Costs and Arbitral Costs as Frontier may incur
between [October 30, 2009, in the case of legal fees, and November 10, 2009, in the case of

disbursements] and the Tribunal’s Award.°*°

Subsequent to the filing of its final
submission on costs on 22 December 2009, i.e., Claimant’s Reply to Respondent’s Post-
Hearing Memorial, Claimant has provided no information on any additional costs that it
may have incurred. The additional advance payments towards the deposit that Claimant
made on 18 February and 26 May 2010 of € 75,000.00 and € 42,500.00, respectively, have

been included in the above table.

. With respect to the apportionment of costs, Claimant submits that it is entitled to both its

legal and arbitral costs on a full indemnity basis, pursuant to Article 40(1) of the
UNCITRAL Rules, in order to protect the integrity of the award which would otherwise fail
to fully compensate Claimant for the losses it suffered as a result of the conduct of the
Czech Republic.” While acknowledging that the Tribunal has discretion to depart from the
basic principle that the unsuccessful party should bear the costs of arbitration, should
Claimant prevail, it submits that the Czech Republic should bear the legal costs because (i)
the conduct for which the Czech Republic may be found liable must be dissuaded; and (ii)

an award of costs is needed to make Claimant whole."

. Should Respondent prevail, Claimant argues that it should not have to bear its costs.

Claimant alludes to emerging tribunal practice with respect to costs in investor-state
arbitrations in which the state prevails to argue that it remains a rarity in investment treaty
arbitration for an unsuccessful claimant to be directed to pay for more than half of the
arbitration costs or any portion of the respondent’s legal fees. The exceptions, Claimant
notes, are cases where the tribunal determines that the claim was manifestly without merit
or that its prosecution by Claimant, or her counsel, fell below commonly understood

692

professional standards. Claimant also argues that any costs award in favour of

Respondent should be adjusted for certain burdensome costs that Claimant was required to

incur in the period leading up to the hearing.*

Claimant asserts that it commenced this arbitration in good faith, that its claim was not
frivolous, that it presented its case in an efficient manner, and that the arbitration raised
novel and difficult questions related to the interaction between bankruptcy and arbitration,
and state responsibility to ensure that bankruptcy proceedings are managed in a manner that

protects the interests of foreign investors.°™*

Thus, while as a matter of principle both
Parties are entitled to full indemnity, Claimant submits that in the event that Respondent is
successful in this arbitration, the Tribunal should order that each party bear its own costs
and that the arbitral costs be divided evenly between the parties, subject to certain

adjustments for the benefit of Claimant.®*

Addressing Respondent’s costs claims, Claimant submits that the fees of Rowan Legal
seem high in view of the fact that Rowan Legal did not apparently draft or submit any legal
argument for use at the hearing, nor attend the hearing itself. Claimant observes that the
strategy pursued by Rowan Legal appeared to change dramatically with the introduction of

the new legal team at the end of May 2009.”

With respect to Claimant’s assertion that it should not have to bear certain allegedly

legal representation of Respondent led to no delay in the arbitration.” Respondent further
argues that it submitted 141 exhibits with its Counter-Memorial — as opposed to the 359
exhibits accompanying Claimant’s Memorial — all of which were on time, in good order,
and with translations (where applicable), in printed and electronic form. Respondent notes
that Claimant’s exhibits were repeatedly submitted after the agreed deadline and without

translations or, in some cases, Czech originals.””

Respondent also objects to the amounts
claimed by Claimant for payments to Tutterovd, Blanka Owensova Translation Services,

Transfin (Sup), Matusik, and for the attendance of Jewitt and Sanford at the hearing.”

Tribunal’s Analysis

As noted by the Parties, Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that, in principle,
the costs of arbitration shall be borne by the unsuccessful party, however, the Tribunal may
apportion such costs between the Parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable,
taking into account the circumstances of the case. Pursuant to Article 40(2), with respect to
the costs of legal representation and assistance, the Tribunal, taking into account the
circumstances of the case, shall be free to determine which Party shall bear such costs or
may apportion such costs between the Parties if it determines that apportionment is

reasonable.

The Tribunal sees no reason to depart from the basic premise of Article 40(1) of the
UNCITRAL Rules which provides that, except in relation to the costs of legal
representation and assistance, the costs of arbitration shall in principle be borne by the
unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs
between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable taking into account the
circumstances of the case. The Tribunal orders that the costs of arbitration shall be borne

by Claimant as Claimant has not succeeded on any of its claims.

The Tribunal fixes the costs of arbitration and its fees in accordance with Articles 38 and 39

of the UNCITRAL Rules as follows:

As per Articles 38(a) and 39 of the UNCITRAL Rules, the fees of the Tribunal
members amount to € 268,110.00, i.e. Mr. Williams’ fees total € 94,500.00,
Mr. Alvarez’s fees total € 86,805.00, and Mr. Schreuer’s fees total € 86,805.00;

As per Article 38(b) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the travel and other expenses of the
Tribunal members amount to € 15,684.48, ie. Mr. Williams’ expenses total
€ 7,702.91, Mr. Alvarez’s expenses total € 5,844.54, and Mr. Schreuer’s expenses total
€ 2,137.03;

As per Article 38(c) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the cost of (i) expert advice required by
the Tribunal is nil; and (ii) other assistance required by the Tribunal, which is
comprised of PCA fees totalling € 63,700.00, and costs of catering, court reporting,
information technology services, courier fees, office supplies, PCA travel and
accommodation expenses, technical and secretarial staff at the Peace Palace,
transportation, award filing fee at The Hague District Court, and bank charges,
amounting to € 46,090.64;

With respect to Article 38(d) of the UNCITRAL Rules (the travel and other expenses
of witnesses to the extent such expenses are approved by the Tribunal), the Tribunal
notes that Claimant has not submitted sufficient detail for the Tribunal to determine
whether its costs should be approved or not. The Tribunal finds that the costs claimed
by Claimant in respect of witnesses are relatively high but the Tribunal takes the matter
no further because its ultimate ruling is that Claimant must bear the costs of the
arbitration so the Tribunal’s approval makes no practical difference. Accordingly, the
costs under Article 38(d) equal € 22,201.77 and are comprised of € 20,937.10
(CAD$ 30,000 for the attendance of Jewitt and Sanford at the hearing) and € 1,264.67
(travel costs of fact witness Gréningerova); and,

As per Article 38(f) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal notes that no costs have
been incurred by any appointing authority in this matter, nor by the Secretary-General

of the PCA.

544. With respect to the costs of legal representation under Article 38(e) of the UNCITRAL

Rules, the Tribunal considers that each party shall bear its own costs. The Tribunal finds

190

545.

546.

547.

that Claimant’s claim was not frivolous. Indeed, as noted in paragraphs 398 to 414 above,
the procedure followed by the Czech courts in addressing Claimant’s applications of
17 May 2005 and the bankruptcy proceedings against MA and LZ raised concerns of
procedural fairness although the actions of the bankruptcy judges and trustees in the end
were not causative and did not rise to the level of treaty breaches. Accordingly, for the
sake of Article 38(e) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the costs for legal representation and

assistance of the successful party are not included in the costs of arbitration.
The Tribunal fixes the costs of arbitration at € 415,786.89.
Claimant is ordered to pay over to Respondent € 198,057.23, i.e. one-half of the costs of

arbitration under Articles 38(a)-(c) plus Respondent’s witness costs approved under Article

38(d), within thirty days of receipt of this Final Award.

DECISIONS OF THE TRIBUNAL

The Tribunal hereby:

(1) Dismisses Respondent's objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.

(2) Declares that Respondent has not violated the BIT with respect to Claimant’s

investment.

(3) Dismisses all of Claimant’s claims.

(4) | Fixes the costs of arbitration at € 415,786.89.

(5) Orders Claimant to bear the costs of arbitration and pay over to Respondent its share

of the costs of arbitration in the amount of € 198,057.23.

(6) Orders each Party to bear its own costs for legal representation and assistance.
