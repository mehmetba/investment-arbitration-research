DECISION BY TRIBUNAL.
IN

NAFTA UNCITRAL INVESTOR-STATR CLAIM
POPE & TALBOT INC AND THE GOVERNMENT OF CANADA

Canada refuses w produce certsin documents upon the grounds that they relate to cxbinct

confidence, and to other documents upon the basis of solicitor-client privilege. The Tovestor

challenges both grounds of retusal, and asks the Tribunal to make certain orders upon that

basis, Canada invites the Trihunal to dismiss the Investor's motion with casts.

 

Cabinet Confidence

Canada refuses to produce 12 documents, identified to the ‘Tribunal as documents
numbered 1-12. It does so in purported reliance on 4.29 of the Canada Evidence Act.
$39(1) provides inter alia (1) “Where ... the Clerk of the Privy Council objects to the
disclosure of information before a court, person or body with jurisdiction to compel
the production of information by certifying in writing that the mformation constitutes
a contidence of the Queen’s Privy Council tor Canada, disclosure of the information
shall be refused without examination or hearing of the information by the Cour,

person or body.”

In support of its refusul Cunada relics on a letter, undated, bearing the heading of the
Clerk of the Privy Council and Scerctary to the Cabinet, and signed by Mcl Cappe to
the Chairman of the Tribunal. The accompanying fax from Counsel for Canada states
“Attached please find a copy of the certificate under 4.39 of the Canada Evidence Act
signed by the Clerk of the Privy Council in this matter.” The above mentioned letter
states that it is in response to requests for docurucats from Counsel for Pope & Talbot
Inc. dated February 15, 2000and parsuant to Procedural Orders No. 9 and 10, and
continues, “Soction 39 of the Canada Vvidenes Act creaccs an absolute prohibition on
the disclosure of documents which are or contain Cabinet confidences. I confirm that
the Govenment of Canada claims privilege at this time for twelve documents which
are confidences of the Qucen’s Privy Council for Canada us detailed in the aurachéd
Schedulu.” The Schedule fists 12 documents, identified by number only, and
including & propos cach that it contains information cither used for or Laken from
another document used for a pwrpose falling within 5.39(2)(aXc)(d) or (©). Having

regard to the views expressed by the Courts in Canada_.v, Central Cartage Ca 1990
2F.C, G41 and Smith Kline & French Laboratories Limited x. Attomey General of
Ganada 1983 IF.C, 917, and the fore. of certificate actually given by the Clerk in the
Central Carlage case at 649-650, end in Babcock v. Canada (A.G.)2000 BOCA. 348

at pages 20-24, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the Cappe document constitutes

 

 

“certifying in writing” in the terms required by 5.39.

 

However that may bs, the ‘Iribunal docs nut in any event consider thal $.39 of the
Canada Evidense Ast is applicable. ‘She Tribunal is not “a court, person or budy with.
jucisdiction to compel the prodection of information" is operating under the
UNCTITRAL Rules. While Article 243) of dose rules empowers to “require the
parties to produce documents, exhibits cr other evidence,” there is no power -tu
compel that production. Indocd, Article 24(3) characterises this requirement ‘to

produce as an invitation:

It one of the parties, duly invited to produce documentary evideace, fails ‘to
da so within the established periad of time, without showing sufficient cause
for such failure, the arbitral tribunal may make the award on the evidence
before il.

It is not in dispute that a ground that may justily refusal of a party to produce
dacuments to an international arbitral wibunal mzy be the protection of state secrets.
But any reasonable evaluation of the quality of ut justification must depend in large
part on having some idea of what those documents are. A determination by a
Tribunal that documents sufficiently identified deserve protection is a very different

matter from acquiescence to a simple assertion, without any identification, thal they

deserve protection IL is apposite tu state that Canada uppears to take the view that it |

has nat merely a right to withhold auch documents, but that 4.29 imposes a duty not to
produce them. But, as noted, by its terms 3.39 is not applicable here. Moreover, the
‘Tribunal observes that the language of 3.39 is worded on the basis that a Minister or
Clerk objects by duty certilying, and the recent decision in Rubcock v Cumada
Attorney General (June 6, 2000) makes it clear thal it is a privilege that can be

waived,

In the specific context of a NAFTA arhitration where the parties have agreed to
operate by UNCITRAL Rules, it is an overriding principle (Asticle 15) thal the
parties be teaued with equality, The other NAFIA Pantics du not, so far as the

‘Tribunal has been made aware, have domestic law that would permit or require them
to withhold documents from Chapter J1 tribunls without any justification beyond a
simple certification thal uhey sre some kind of state secrcl. In these circumstances,
Canada, if it could simply rely on 5.39, might bc in as unfairly advantaged position
under Chapter 11 by comparison with the United States and Mexico.

It is for Canada to determine whether it intends to adhere to its refusal. As matters
stand, the Tribunal has no means of knowing what sort of material is being withheld,
nor to what time scale the matcrial relates. In the Canidion Measure Affecting the
Export of Civilian Aircraft case, 14 April 1999, the WTO Panel stated that where a
alate is justitied in withholding information, it is to be expected that it should “explain
clearly the basis for the need to protect that information”, So too does this Triburiat
expect clarity. For example in paragraphs 72 and 79 of its Reply Canada hints that
there may have been discussion al cubinet level ubout the SLA ox its implementation.
As this case concems implementation of the SILA it may be that the documcats
refused are not germane to the issues in any event. But without further information

tho Tribunal has no means of knowing.

The Tribunal accordingly as a first step invites Canada wo furnish it with the dates of
cach of the documents 1-12 referred to, aa identification of cach document, and an
indication of the aspect of the disput if any to which each ducument relates. Ir would
be of valuc to the Tribunal if Canada were able to offer reasons why in conformity
with a general law relating to State secrets those particular documtents, or any of them
should be withheld. :

Any issue as to inferences lu be drawn in relation to production o¢ non-production of

documents will ultimately be disposed of in accordance with UNCITRAL Rule 283).
Saticitor-Cliem Relationship

‘The ‘Tribunal sccepts, in geners]. the contention by Canada that solicitor-clicnt
privilege extends to communication for the purposc of giving or sccking legal advice
yngs 1999 ISCR 455; Solosky..v. Canada 1980 JSCR 821; Descot-eaux
1982 1SCR 860). It rejects the contention on hehalf of the Investor

    
 

that the privilege is confined to legal advice given in contemplation af litigation.

Accordingly, the claim to privilege by Canadagn this basis is upheld gonetally eo far

as it sclates to the documents specified in Schedule B. However, certain of these
documents do not appear to be confined 1o the provision of legal advice, and it
appears to the ‘Lribunal that those parts of such documents as do constitul: such |.
advice (or summaries thereof) should be excised and the remaining material made ii
available. This ruling applies to B3; BO, B12; R24 and FOS.

In addition there are two documents B28(b) and B34 which appear to be simply
‘status’ reports and nol to fall under the head of legal advice. Accordingly Canada is ?

   

required to produce thess documents also (umder excision if nocessaty of any legal | }
advice contained therein). .

For the avoidance of doubt the cloim to privilege in relation to thy Dunohus case
documents is upheld. .
