Background and Procedure

The Notice of Arbitration with which these proceedings were initiated under
the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules was submitted on March 15, 2007. The
Tribunal was properly constituted on June 26, 2007, after the appointments of Mr.
R. Doak Bishop and Mr. Bernardo Cremades as arbitrators and the appointment on
that date of Professor Francisco Orrego Vicufia as the Presiding Arbitrator by
agreement of the two co-arbitrators.

The Claimant in this is case Société Générale, a company registered in France,
which claims in respect of DR Energy Holdings Limited (“DREH”), a company
organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands, and Empresa Distribuidora de
Electricidad del Este, S. A., (“EDE Este”) a joint venture created in the Dominican
Republic in 1999 between the Republic and the foreign investor AES Distribucién
Dominicana Limited, which later sold its interest to the Claimant. The Claimant
alleges to be an indirect owner of DREH, which in turns owns 50% of EDE Este.
The various relevant corporate arrangements will be explained further below. The
Claimant is represented by Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker LLP.

The Respondent in this case is the Dominican Republic and it is represented
by Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP. The Claimant lists several instrumentalities
of the Dominican Republic that are relevant in this case in their capacity ‘of
regulatory bodies of the electricity sector, in particular the Corporacién
Dominicana de Empresas Eléctricas Estatales (“CDEEE”) and the

The Claimant in this is case Société Générale, a company registered in France,
which claims in respect of DR Energy Holdings Limited (“DREH”), a company
organized under the laws of the Cayman Islands, and Empresa Distribuidora de

of the Dominican Republic on the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of
Investments, signed on January 14, 1999, and which entered into force on January
23, 2003 (“Treaty” or “BIT”).!

The Tribunal held a first meeting with the parties in New York City on
November 19, 2007. At this meeting various organizational aspects of the
arbitration were discussed, agreed and placed on record by the Tribunal at the end
of the meeting. It was decided in particular that the arbitration would be conducted
under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, that the language shal! be English and
that the place of arbitration shall be New York City, New York, United States of
America. It was also agreed that the administration of the case would be entrusted
to the London Court of International Arbitration, which assigned to it the
reference “Arbitration No. UN 7927”. The procedural timetable was also
established on this occasion.

Prior to this first meeting, the Tribunal issued on October 30, 2007, an Order
on Confidentiality regarding document production, which was previously agreed
by the parties. Document production also took place before the first meeting
during the period September-October 2007. Various other matters raised by the
parties were decided by the Tribunal by correspondence before the first meeting
took place, including a request from the Claimant to consolidate this arbitration
with other proceedings beginning at the time, which was not accepted.

The parties agreed that in accordance with Article 7(2) of the Treaty the law
governing this dispute “consists of the terms of the Treaty, the terms of any

specific avreements entered into in connection with the invectmant and the

arbitration were discussed, agreed and placed on record by the Tribunal at the end

The Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, the Answer to such Memorial, the
Reply and the Rejoinder were all submitted in compliance with the procedural
timetable noted. A hearing on jurisdiction took place in New York City on April
14-15, 2008. On this occasion the parties further explained their arguments to the
Tribunal and submitted documents in support thereof, a witness introduced by the
Claimant was examined and cross-examined, and the Tribunal addressed questions
to both the parties and the witness. It was also agreed that post-hearing briefs
would be prepared by the parties, which were submitted on May 30, 2008; each
party submitted a Reply to the post-hearing brief of the other on July 11, 2008, as
directed by the Tribunal. The Claimant submitted an Amended post-hearing
memorial on June 12, 2008, following the directions of the Tribunal after
submissions of the parties.

Following the hearing, the Tribunal deliberated on the jurisdictional
objections. This Award is concerned with the objections to jurisdiction raised by
the Respondent.

Notwithstanding the references that will be made below in respect of the
Claimant’s corporate structure, it is important for the sake of clarity to note at the
outset the main features of such structure. Société Générale (France), the
Claimant, is the majority owner of Trust Company of the West Group (“TCW”)
(Nevada). The percentages of this ownership have been increasing and eventually
will reach 100%. TCW is in turn the 100% owner of TAMCO (California), which

owns 50.1% of TCW Energy Advisors LLC (Delaware).? A company organized

TCW Energy Advisors LLC is in turn the General Partner of Dominican Energy
Holdings LP (Delaware), but as such owns no shares in the company. 100% of the
shares of Dominican Energy Holdings LP are held by a Limited Partner, Peste
LLC (Nevada), owned by a United States citizen. Dominican Energy Holdings LP
is a company different from DR Energy Holdings Ltd. (Cayman), which appears
further below in the corporate structure.

Dominican Energy Holdings LP owns 100% each of Dominican Distribution
Holdings LLC (Delaware) and Dominican Distribution Holdings Ltd. (Cayman).
Dominican Distribution Holdings LLC owns 10% of DREH. (Cayman), while
90% is owned by Dominican Distribution Holdings Ltd. DREH owns 50% of the
shares of EDE Este, which as noted was established in the Dominican Republic.
DR Energy Holdings Ltd. was formerly owned by AES, a United States company,
under a different corporate structure, wbich as noted sold its interest to the
Claimant.

The corporate structure is supplemented by an administration agreement
between EDE Este and DREH, a management agreement with TAMCO and an
operating agreement with AES, the former investor. As the reader of this Award
will no doubt be confused by the similarity of names and their interrelationships,
the Tribunal is including in Annex | a complete chart of the relevant corporate
structure.

for the claim do not constitute an expropriation and are not in breach of the Treaty
provisions. Third, it is alleged that in any event the events complained of took
place before the Treaty entered into force on January 23, 2003, and the Claimant
became a protected investor and such Treaty cannot be applied retroactively.
Fourth, it is argued that the alleged events took place before Société Générale
acquired the investment from AES and accordingly there was no investor of
French nationality affected.

The Tribunal will now address these various questions and the most interesting
legal issues they entail, not devoid on occasion of extraordinary complexity, all of
which have been argued with great competence by counsel for the parties.

The first objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction: the existence of an investment
(Jurisdiction ratione materiae)
The Respondent's views

Respondent’s first objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction concerns the claim
that in this case the Claimant has not made an investment and accordingly there
can be no dispute qualifying under the Treaty provisions. The Respondent argues
that while the Claimant alleges it made an investment as an indirect shareholder in
EDE Este, in the light of Article 1(1)(b) of the Treaty and also in terms of its
intercst in the concession granted by the Dominican Republic to this company
under the terms of Article 1(1)(e) of the Treaty, it not sufficient to look at these
articles in isolation but the Preamble to the Treaty also needs to be considered.

Article 1(1)(b) refers to “{sJhares, issue premiums and other forms of

participation, even if minority or indirect. in comnanies constifuted in the territary

acquired the investment from AES and accordingly there was no investor of
French nationality affected.

legal issues they entail, not devoid on occasion of extraordinary complexity, all of
which have been argued with great competence by counsel for the parties.

that the Claimant was both a shareholder in EDE Este and had an interest in the
concession under which this company operates in the Dominican Republic,> but a
more complex corporate structure and chain of interests was to become known
later. But even under the earlier assumption the Respondent believed that such
assets or interests do not make of the Claimant an investor because if the Preamble
is taken into account the issue of whether there has been a contribution made to
the parties’ economic development arises prominently. The Preamble indeed
refers to the protection of “investments” so as to “stimulate transfers of capital and
technology” between France and the Dominican Republic “in the interest of their
economic development”.

Under the corporate structure later explained, the Respondent believes that any
connection between the Claimant and an investment was even more remote.’ The
Respondent argues that the Claimant does not own any shares in EDE Este as
these are owned by Dominican Energy Holdings LP, which in tumed is
exclusively owned by Peste LLC as the sole limited partner in Dominican Energy
Holdings LP, a Delaware limited partnership in which TCW Energy Advisors
LLC is a general partner.* As such the Claimant and its affiliates are not entitled to
receive any distributions from the partnership but only a management fee to TCW
as the contractual manager; the Respondent asserts that the management fee is the
only interest TCW and its parent corporations have in this case, which is not a
protected investment under the Treaty. Moreover, the Respondent asserts that this
corporate structure was deliberately chosen to keep the Claimant out of the

ownership chain, thus enabling it to avoid any risk associated to tax. accounting or

the parties’ economic development arises prominently. The Preamble indeed
refers to the protection of “investments” so as to “stimulate transfers of capital and
technology” between France and the Dominican Republic “in the interest of their
economic development”.

connection between the Claimant and an investment was even more remote. The

legal matters. Neither does TCW Energy Advisors LLC have any unlimited
liability in connection with the partnership.

18. The Respondent further explains that the Claimant has no ownership of the
partnership under Delaware law and that the concept of an “indicia of ownership”
which the Claimant proposes is not found under such law. Neither could an
indirect holding of 50.1% that the Claimant has in TCW Energy Advisors LLC
through TCW be considered an investment under the Treaty as a management fee
does not qualify in this respect. The Respondent also explains that, moreover, the
mere exercise of control by the Claimant over the operation does not meet the
ownership test under the Treaty.”

19. The Respondent distinguishes this case from SGS v. The Philippines, in which
services were provided outside the country in question, but it was also held that a
substantial part of the relevant services were provided in the Philippines.
Similarly, in SGS v. Pakistan’ funds had been injected into the territory in
compliance with the investor’s obligations, just as in Fedax v. Venezuela'® it was
decided that the funds concerned had been made available to be used by the
Venezuelan Government as the beneficiary of the credit. In the Respondent’s
view, nothing of the sort happened in the instant case. As a result of the purported
remoteness that the Claimant has with the alleged investment the test applied by

the Tribunal in Enron v. Argentina'' to establish a “cut-off point” beyond which

the investment would be outside the scope of the protection granted by the treaty
and of the arbitration clause is not met in the instant case.

The Respondent further explains in support of this objection that TCW paid
only US$ 2 for the participation of AES in EDE Este, while AES had in turn
written down the value of its investment to US$ 0. There never was, the
Respondent asserts, any capital contribution to EDE Este nor an intention to make
such contribution. Neither has there been any transfer of technology or other
activities that could qualify as a contribution. In the Respondent’s view the whole
operation was speculative with the express intention of avoiding any risk
associated with losses of EDE Este, insulating TCW from any liability for this
operation, ensuring that EDE Este’s financials would not become consolidated
with TCW’s own balance sheets, and refusing any responsibility for EDE Este’s
operations, which were left in the hands of AES, the former investor. The various
exit strategies that the Claimant devised for this operation culminated in the effort
to recover in this arbitration USS 680 million for its US$ 2 outlay.

The Respondent’s legal argument in support of this objection emphasizes the
role of the Preamble in treaty interpretation under the Vienna Convention Article
31(1) and (2),!” as this will allow for the interpretation of the provisions of the
Treaty in their context and in the light of the Treaty’s purpose and objectives, thus
giving effect to the expressed intention of the parties. It is also argued that both the

The Claimant's views

In opposing this first objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, the Claimant
explains that the US$ 2 nominal amount paid to AES for its shareholding in EDE
Este is not the investment but a figure relating to the complex circumstances of
this case. The investment is represented by the 50% shareholding that the
Claimant acquired and thus became the beneficiary of all the legal rights
associated with those shares, including both contract rights and rights associated
with the concession. The total consideration was in the range of US$ 50-60
million because in addition to the purchase price AES obtained a right of first
refusal and a deferred purchase fee expressed in terms of the fee paid to AES for
its work under the management contract with EDE Este.

The Claimant further explains that AES was compelled to sell its assets in
EDE Este because the mounting debt the latter company was incurring as a result
of the adverse measures taken by the Respondent was reflected and consolidated
in AES’s own books, with the result that the value of its shares was also
affected.'® AES had already written-off these losses so as to prevent further
damages. The Claimant’s purchase allowed AES to increase its shareholder and
market value while retaining the managerial contro] of EDE Este, just as the
purchase had a beneficial effect for the Respondent as it ensured the continued

supply of electricity.

24. The Claimant also asserts that the whole operation amounted to a legitimate
transaction that had no speculative elements to it, particularly in light of the fact
that it was not buying a claim as the Respondent has argued.'” Neither was the
investment free from risk because the value of EDE Este was gradually being
destroyed, and the fact that the Claimant chose the options that would best
minimize risk is what any prudent investor would have done in the
circumstances.'* Moreover, the Claimant asserts that it was and still is also willing
and prepared to make capital contributions if the Respondent would meet its
obligations. The Claimant had simply identified a potential business opportunity
for benefiting from the investment in EDE Este if the Respondent was willing to
meet its obligations, as it had repeatedly promised. Exit strategies would also be
available in case the situation did not improve, but in any event this is irrelevant
for a jurisdictional determination.

25. The Claimant explained at the hearing that because of those very risks it chose
in the end a corporate structure that would shield Société Générale and TCW from
the dangers that had already affected AES, that is the possibility of having to
consolidate EDE Este’s losses into its own books.'? The investor would be
remunerated by means of the management contract with TAMCO in what has
been described as the upstream segment of the investment with all liabilities
remaining elsewhere in the corporate structure. The corporate structure would also
shield the Claimant from other adverse consequences relating to tax, accounting or
legal questions.

property, rights and interests of any nature”, including indirectly held shares, issue
premiums and other forms of participation, just as it includes concessions
accorded by law or by virtue of a contract and other claims and rights to any
benefit having an economic value (Art. 1(1)). The concept of the unity of the
investment as identified in Duke Energy? also supports the view that an
investment can be a multi faceted operation that does not refer just to the purchase
price but to other elements as well. The Claimant explains that in the instant case
it indirectly owns most of the assets protected under the Treaty, including shares,
the concession rights and other claims and rights with an economic value. It is
thus not relevant to take into consideration just the purchase price.

The Claimant also maintains that the Treaty is not restricted to the protection
of “ownership” but encompasses other interests as well, with particular reference
to “rights and interests of any nature” (Article Te) a As long as the investor
controls these interests there shall be a qualifying investment under this broad
scope of the Treaty, which is very much the situation in the instant case. It follows
that the corporate structure chosen does not break the chain of interests connected
to the investment and thus the Claimant is not remotely positioned in this respect.
The Claimant explains that under the Dominican Energy Holdings LP Agreement
it receives 90% of the profit stream originating in Ede Este, which results in a
protected form of participation whether it is called management fee. profits,
equity, revenues or an economic benefit.

The Claimant further maintains that the corporate structure chosen is entirely

within the scope of applicable Nelaware law and that TCW Enerov Advisors 1.0

investment can be a multi faceted operation that does not refer just to the purchase
price but to other elements as well. The Claimant explains that in the instant case
it indirectly owns most of the assets protected under the Treaty, including shares,

thus not relevant to take into consideration just the purchase price.

Limited Partnership Agreement the authority and discretion to manage the
operations and affairs of such partnership and makes its business decisions.” The
Agreement also broadly defines “interest” as the entire ownership interest that
might pertain to both general and limited partners. It follows that TCW Energy
Advisors LP has unlimited liability for the obligations of the partnership.”> The
interpretation of the Agreement also leads to the conclusion that the management
fee is a share of profits rather than a fixed expense incurred by the Partnership, a
view which is opposed by the Respondent in light of its own expert interpretation
of the Agreement.”*

The Claimant argues next that the parties did not intend to incorporate any
quantitative or qualitative thresholds in connection with the assets protected under
the Treaty, a proposition that has been rejected by several arbitral tribunals.”> In
any event, the Claimant asserts that if the Preamble as a whole is taken into
consideration and not just selected paragraphs as the Respondent has done, it will
be realized that the Claimant has indeed made an investment, including the
objective of creating “favourable conditions for reciprocal investments on a stable
basis and with due regard to fair and equitable treatment”. In this context, the
Preamble does not contain substantive requirements as to the definition of
investment, which is solely governed by the provisions of the Treaty, including
specifically the purchase of shares.

Tt is also explained that in spite of control not being a jurisdictional

requirement under the Treaty, the fact that AES manages the operations of EDE

interpretation of the Agreement also leads to the conclusion that the management
fee is a share of profits rather than a fixed expense incurred by the Partnership, a
view which is opposed by the Respondent in light of its own expert interpretation

of the Agreement.

Este does not detract from the Claimant’s control of the corporate and board
policies of the investment, making an important contribution to the economic
development of the Dominican Republic in terms of the supply of electricity,
improvement of distribution and employment.

The Tribunal’s findings on the existence of an investment

The Tribunal is in no doubt about the importance of the Preamble in matters of
treaty interpretation and in this respect the Respondent has correctly pointed to the
jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice in both the Rights of Nationals
of the United States of America in Morocco and the Asylum cases. The arbitral
decisions noted are also relevant to support this view. The Vienna Convention on
the Law of Treaties mandates an interpretation in good faith and in accordance
with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context
and in the light of its object and purpose (Article 31.1). It is also explicit in
identifying not only the text of the treaty but also its preamble and annexes as part
of the context in which interpretation is to take place (Article 31. 2).

In the instant case, the text of Article 1 of the Treaty broadly but non-
exhaustively”® defines the term investment in a detailed manner and therefore
expresses unequivocally the intent of the parties. If any restrictions had been
intended, they would have been embodied in that article. On occasions some
forms of investment are excluded from the protection of the treaty; this was done
for example in Article 1 (a) of the ASEAN Framework Agreement” when
excluding portfolio investments from protection under the Agreement, but this

was not done in the instant case. The Preamble sets out the oeneral nurnoses and

objectives of the Treaty but, as the Claimant has argued, cannot add substantive
requirements to the provisions of the Treaty. The Treaty articles and its Preamble
have different roles that should not be confused. Their confluence in the context of
treaty interpretation relates to a situation in which the ordinary meaning of the text
cannot be clearly established by the pertinent provisions themselves, which is not
the case here.

While the reference the Preamble makes to the parties being convinced “that
the promotion and protection of such investments are likely to stimulate transfers
of capital and technology between the two countries in the interest of their
economic development” sets out the general objective of the economic
relationship between France and the Dominican Republic, this does not detract
from the fact that every single form of investment listed under Article | qualifies
for protection. To the extent that shares, concessions under contract and claims
and rights to any benefit having an economic value are involved in this dispute,
they all qualify for such protection independently from the manner in which they
each contribute to stimulating the transfer of capital and technology. This transfer
is thus the overall objective but not a specific requirement for each individual
form of investment, which would be in any event most difficult to establish on a
case-by-case basis. The Tribunal in Saluka addressed a similar situation holding
that:

“The Tribunal does not believe that it would be correct to interpret Article |
as excluding from the definition of “investor” those who purchase shares as

way or another, the result will in due course be a degree of profit on the

transaction...”.8

34. It is quite evident that in this case the principal objective of the transaction was
the potential profitability of the investment in the hope that the electricity sector in
the Dominican Republic would become financially viable, particularly since
Société Générale is a financial services company and TCW an investment fund.
Following a question from the Tribunal at the hearing it was explained in greater
detail that the Respondent’s government and specifically the Superintendencia de
Electricidad were informed and well aware of the purchase of AES’ investment by
the Claimant.

35. The issue of the specific contribution made to the local economy by a
transaction of this kind might not be as easy to identify as if a factory was built,
but this of course does not disqualify financial investments from protection under
the Treaty. The Claimant has convincingly identified as part of such contribution
the continuing supply of electricity, the improvement of distribution and the
contribution to employment within the country. Moreover, the Claimant has also
expressed its intention to undertake the capitalization of EDE Este if the
obligations relating to the investment are met. Although corporate governance
tights might in some circumstances qualify as an investment, as the Claimant
recalls the tribunal held in in Eureko,° such a holding might not be as appropriate
in this case, but the important role of distribution of electricity in the overall

performance of a complex economy can be considered as one additional element

of the Claimant’s involvement in and contribution to the economy of the
Dominican Republic,

The parties have extensively discussed whether a US$ 2 purchase price can be
considered an investment. Lf this were the only element involved in such a
transaction doubts could legitimately arise about its meaning, but in fact the
transaction includes many other elements, such as the potential market value of
the shares purchased, contract rights related to the concession and other claims and
rights to benefits having an economic value. All such elements are specifically
listed in the definition of investment under Article | of the Treaty. The purchase
of property for a nominal price is a normal kind of transaction the world over
when there are other interests and risks entailed in the business. To the extent that
the purchase price might include a discounted value and hence entail a form of
compensation for the distressed state of a company, this is something that might
be discussed at the merits stage of a dispute, as the Claimant has explained in
connection with a question from the Tribunal at the hearing.”!

The fact that the Claimant has participated through various corporate vehicles
as a General Partner of Dominican Energy Holdings LP in the upstream segment
of the investment that has been explained, and as such holds no shares in the
general partnership, does not disqualify that operation as one related to the
Claimant's economic interest in the investment as a whole, which includes one set
of corporate arrangements in the upstream segment and the purchase of shares and
different arrangements downstream, The end result is that the Claimant is entitled

to the benefits of its investment in EDE Este through the chain of interests built

structures were considered at the time the investment was in the process of
planning,”? each reflecting different modalities and priorities, in the end the
structure finally chosen is the only one this Tribunal must take into account in
reaching its conclusions.

The Claimant has also convincingly argued that the transaction is not exempt
from business risks. The mere fact of taking over a business that had heavy losses,
which had significantly affected AES as the former investor is a risk the Claimant
undertook in the hope of seeing the value of those assets increase in the near
future. To see that objective frustrated or worse to see that the value kept
deteriorating is a risk associated with the transaction. This very risk explains why
the Claimant had to consider an exit strategy as any prudent investor would do,
but this strategy does not affect the existence of a protected investment under the
Treaty.

If in the end it is concluded that such losses were caused simply by bad
business judgment and are not attributable to any governmental interference in
breach of the treaty guarantees, then a damage recovery in this arbitration could
not be sustained because, as noted in Maffezzini,” investment treaties are not an
insurance policy against bad business judgments. But such a determination
belongs to the merits. In this context it can only be concluded that the transaction

Générale and TCW are financial service companies in any way affect the
protection to which the investment might be eventually entitled

40. The Claimant has also made the argument that the most-favored-nation
(“MFN”) clause contained in Article 4 of the Treaty entitles it to treatment not less
favorable than that accorded to investors of other nations that have entered into
treaties with the Dominican Republic. The Claimant believes in particular that the
definition of investment included in the Central American Free Trade Agreement-
Dominican Republic with the United States, which includes among other features
the “expectation of gain or profit”, extends to Société Générale as the beneficiary
of the clause under the Treaty here concerned.™* The Tribunal does not believe this
to be the case.

41. Each treaty defines what it considers a protected investment and who is entitled to
that protection, and definitions can change from treaty to treaty. In this situation,
resort to the specific text of the MFN Clause is unnecessary because it applies
only to the treatment accorded to such defined investment, but not to the definition
of “investment” itself.

42. The Tribunal was also informed at the hearing that proceedings had been
initiated by TCW under the CAFTA-DR Agreement.’® Moreover, the
Respondent’s argument to the effect that the clause in the CAFTA-DR Agreement
is expressly excluded in respect of privileges extended in the context of a free
trade area is persuasive as this is the very kind of free trade arrangement the

43.The Tribunal has noted above, however, that the Treaty’s definition of
“investment” is not exhaustive and that an expectation of profitability is naturally
related to that definition. Thus, resort to other treaties is unnecessary.

44. The question of transfers of investments has also been discussed in the instant
case. This has become a normal feature of a global economy and the transfers are
not as such disqualified from treaty protection. Several arbitral tribunals have

considered cases in which transfers have taken place,”

and when the treaty’s
jurisdictional requirements have been met, the claims have been judged on the
merits. The transfer of AES’s investment in EDE Este to the Claimant thus does
not preclude the existence of a protected asset, and there are no indications that
this case might have involved a strategy such as was the case in Mihaly°® and
Banro.®

45. The Tribunal must now address the contentious question of whether the complex
corporate structure chosen for this investment detracts from the nature of the
investment or in some way disqualifies the Claimant from invoking the
protections of the Treaty. While many arbitrations have been confronted with
complex corporate structures, which have become a normal feature of
international business,"? few have reached the complexity of this case. A first
aspect to consider in this respect is if the arrangements in question are both lawful

and legitimate. Nothing in this case suggests that they were not lawful or

legitimate, especially since in light of the dramatic experience of AES it was
reasonable for the Claimant to take as much care as possible in insulating itself
from potentially adverse tax, accounting and legal consequences that might
otherwise ensue.

The Tribunal has also examined with attention the arguments made by the
parties in connection with applicable Delaware law‘! and the manner in which this
could affect the Claimant’s protection as an investor under the Treaty. The
Tribunal accepts that Delaware law and the Partnership Agreement are broad
enough so as to include various forms of ownership or other interests within the
scope of the partnership"? TCW Energy Advisors LP controls the partnership by
means of its management and business decisions. Risk and liability are not in
principle absent from such arrangement. [t follows that the chain of interests
relating to the investment is not broken as a result of this corporate structure as it
will continue downstream through the other arrangements described and in the end
it will be remunerated by means of the management fee.

As noted above, the Respondent interprets Delaware law differently. It submits
that the only ownership interest in the partnership is that held by Peste LLC, with
the Claimant’s interest being restricted to its entitlement to a contractual
management fee, which does not qualify as an investment under the Treaty.” The
Tribunal is not persuaded, however, that not even if this view were correct would
it mean disqualifying the Claimant’s interest in the investment under the Treaty
given its broad definition of investment. Moreover, if the management fee were

the onlv interest the Claimant has in this transaction it would he difficult to

did not simply enter into a contract for management remunerated by means of a
fee. In this context, the very principle of freedom of contract the Respondent
invokes in connection with the partnership agreement under Delaware law” can
only be taken to mean that what the contract intended was the attainment of a
broader interest by means of that particular partnership.

The Tribunal is next persuaded that the definition of investment under the
Treaty Article | (1) relates protection not only to a formal ownership of shares or
other such usual kind of transaction but also to a broader category of rights and
interests of any nature. This allows for great flexibility in respect of the raanner in
which the investment is organized, and nothing suggests that the corporate
structure chosen is contrary to this objective. As long as the business undertaken
and the pertinent legal arrangements are lawful, as is the case here, there will be
no reason to refuse the protections of the Treaty. This in the end is the reason why
investment law has always searched for the economic interest underlying a given
transaction and if it is compatible with the terms of the law and the Treaty, such
interest is recognized as entitled to protection."®

A second aspect of the question to be considered is whether, as in Enron, there
might here be an argument to the effect that the Respondent cannot be bound by
an arbitration agreement extending indefinitely to a chain of investors because one
after the other might become claimants without the knowledge of the
Respondent’s government. In that case it was held that the Respondent was bound

by the arbitration agreement in respect of indirect investors that had been invited

investment through an intermediate company.

The Tribunal must note that in the instant case the Respondent did not invite
the Claimant to invest in EDE Este nor did it require that it follow any particular
corporate structure or the use of investment vehicles. Nevertheless, although
Respondent’s consent to undertake the transaction was not formally requested in
writing, there is convincing evid that the R dent was i d of the
Claimant's interest and that specific meetings took place between the officials of
the Claimant and the Respondent to consider this interest and the future prospects
of the regulatory framework of the electricity sector in the Dominican Republic.
Decisions were taken on this basis and when the purchase of the investment
materialized and the ion was d the arbi
embodied in the Treaty between France and the Dominican Republic became
applicable, subject to issues of nationality and questions relating to the date of
entry into force of the Treaty, which will be discussed further below.

The Tribunal also notes that the Treaty, in defining investment in the broad
manner explained, including minority or indirect forms of equity interest,
necessarily implies that there may be one or several layers of intermediate
companies or interests intervening between the claimant and the investmeat.

The Tribunal accordingly concludes on this first objection to jurisdiction that

The second objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction: the evidence on the alleged
facts amounting to expropriation for jurisdictional purposes (Jurisdiction ratione
materiae)
The Respondent's views

53. A second objection also relates to the consideration of jurisdiction ratione
materiae. It concerns the question whether the facts pleaded by the Claimant fall
within the scope of Article 5(2) of the Treaty governing expropriation. The
Respondent believes they do not. In the Respondent’s view there is thus no dispute
relating to an investment as required by the jurisprudence of international courts
and tribunals. Moreover, the Respondent argues that not any dispute wil! fall
under the protections of the Treaty, but the dispute has to relate to the main
purpose of the investment; many disputes might arise but some will be patently
outside the scope of the Treaty as they will not related to the protections granted.

54, The Respondent recalls that in the Oil! Platforms Case, the International Court
of Justice expressly indicated that it should ascertain whether “the dispute is one
which the Court has jurisdiction ratione materiae to entertain”.° Also a tribunal in
Bayindir held that it had to assess whether the facts alleged by the claimant “fall
within [the treaty] provisions or are capable, if proved, of constituting breaches of
the obligations they refer to”,"”

55. The Respondent argues in this respect that as there has been no transfer of title
to property, the facts alleged could not constitute a case of direct expropriation.“

Neither has there been a substantial impairment of the value of the investment or

materiae. It concerns the question whether the facts pleaded by the Claimant fall
within the scope of Article 5(2) of the Treaty governing expropriation. The
Respondent believes they do not. In the Respondent’s view there is thus no dispute
relating to an investment as required by the jurisprudence of international courts
and tribunals. Moreover, the Respondent argues that not any dispute will fall
under the protections of the Treaty, but the dispute has to relate to the main

purpose of the investment; many disputes might arise but some will be patently

other forms of deprivation that could amount to indirect expropriation. The
Respondent asserts that the investor has full ownership and control of the
investment made, its ability to operate has not been affected and there has been no
interference with management. The question whether profits are diminished does
not amount in the Respondent’s view to expropriation,” not even when the value
might have decreased substantially” or the customer base has been reduced,
independently of the discussion of whether such effects are attributable to the
Respondent. The Respondent also asserts that the Claimant has not indicated a
precise date for any such act of expropriation to have taken place as all such
allegations are based on speculation about eventual future events.

The Claimant’s view

56. The Claimant believes that the facts it has alleged amount to an expropriation
but that in accordance with legal standards governing jurisdiction the Tribunal
must only satisfy itself at this stage that such acts are capable of constituting a
breach of the ‘Treaty provisions and thus ascertain the existence of a dispute. Only
at the merits stage is a tribunal required to decide whether the facts have been
indeed proven and if so consider the questions of liability and remedies.

57. The Claimant also argues that the claim for expropriation must be accepted on
the basis of the facts invoked by the Claimant, which for jurisdictional purposes
must be taken to be true, In the Claimant’s view there has already been a transfer
of title to the property concerned as the imposition of a growing debt by the

regulatory bodies by way of forcing EDE Este to record agreed subsidies as

changing the threshold for non-regulated users and interfering in the management
of EDE Este results in an indirect expropriation even though day to day operations
have not been taken over and the company continues to operate, albeit on
uneconomic terms forced upon it. The Claimant also asserts that market share in
connection with the threshold of unregulated users that has been changed is a part
of the protected investment, as decided by arbitral tribunals in other disputes.°! In
the Claimant’s view, all such disputes relate to the substance of the investment and
are not peripheral questions, thus falling within the protection of the Treaty and
the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.
The Tribunal’s findings on whether the facts alleged fall within the protection of
the Treaty

The Tribunal must first address the Claimant’s argument that because the
Respondent might not have addressed each individual claim other than
expropriation this must be taken as an admission of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction
over them. It is first not quite evident that only expropriation has been addressed
by the Respondent as many issues have been discussed in connection with the
Claimant’s overall and specific arguments in support of its case. But even if that
were the case, barring an express statement to the effect of accepting jurisdiction
no presumption can be made in light of the Respondent’s opposition to all of the
jurisdictional arguments of the Claimant. Discussion of specific claims belongs to
the merits stage.

As with the first objection discussed, the Tribunal is in no doubt about the

principles governing a iurisdictional determination that it has been requested ta

of the protected investment, as decided by arbitral tribunals in other disputes.*! In
the Claimant’s view, all such disputes relate to the substance of the investment and
are not peripheral questions, thus falling within the protection of the Treaty and
the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.

of the International Court of Justice to the effect that the Court must satisfy itself
that “the dispute is one which the Court has jurisdiction ratione materiae to
entertain”,? as it would be a total loss of time to consider a dispute which it
believes falls outside its jurisdictional ambit. If such were the case summary
dismissal of the claim would be an appropriate decision. The Respondent is
equally correct in explaining that such a principle has been expressed in Bayindir
and a number of other decisions as the need for the tribunal to assess whether the
facts alleged by the claimant “fall within [the treaty] provisions or are capable, if
proved, of constituting breaches of the obligations they refer to?

The nature of this determination is of necessity a provisional one because the
actual evidence about whether the acts took place in fact and are attributable to the
Respondent is to be tested at the merits phase of a case. It is thus a prima facie
determination subject to the burden of proving that the claim finds support in both
fact and law. No tribunal could know the truth beforehand and any other approach
would lead to a prejudgment of the matter as the parties will not have had at that
time the opportunity to argue their views on the merits. If there is doubt about the
facts alleged amounting to a breach of the treaty the matter may be joined to the
merits. The Tribunal may also dismiss a claim at the outset as a question of
admissibility if it is abundantly clear that the claimant cannot prove the merits of
such claim. But these are of course exceptions to the Jogical order of a prima
Jacie determination that, if favorable to jurisdiction, will be followed by the
examination of the claim on the merits, which is the accepted legal standard in the
matter.

For upholding jurisdiction, a tribunal will have to convince itself merely that
the allegations of the claimant have some merit and are credible, which explains
why normally the facts as presented by the claimant will be relied upen, unless
they are shown to be entirely baseless at first sight. Although the parties have in
this case chosen to argue mainly whether the facts invoked by the Claimant do or
do not amount to expropriation, and thus whether they fall or not under the Treaty
provisions and can result in a dispute over which the Tribunal has jurisdiction, it is
necessary for reaching a prima facie determination to recal] that the Claimant has
argued in its Statement of Claim not only that expropriation in breach of Article 5
of the Treaty has taken place but also that the facts of the case result in other
breaches as well, including the failure to provide complete and total protection and
security as required also by Article 5, the violation of fair and equitable treatment
of Article 3 and a violation of the most favored nation treatment obligation of
Article 4, also arguing that the facts constitute a denial of justice contrary to both
the Trealy and customary international law!

The Tribunal must accordingly establish at this stage whether the facts as
alleged could constitute a breach of the Treaty, without necessarily identifying
precisely what is the breach that has taken place, a matter which again will pertain
to the merits. The same facts can result on close examination in different and
separate breaches if proven. The Respondent is right to argue in this respect that
not every dispute is capable of falling under the protection of the Treaty as there

may be disputes that relate to entirely different matters, as discussed in the Waste
Mannramant nace 5 Tha Triknnalc datorminatinn ic thie aanfinad tn whathar the

do not amount to expropriation, and thus whether they fall or not under the Treaty
provisions and can result in a dispute over which the Tribunal has jurisdiction, it is
necessary for reaching a prima facie determination to recall that the Claimant has
argued in its Statement of Claim not only that expropriation in breach of Article 5
of the Treaty has taken place but also that the facts of the case result in other
breaches as well, including the failure to provide complete and total! protection and

security as required also by Article 5, the violation of fair and equitable treatment

31

facts alleged relate to a dispute concerning the Treaty protection or some other
commitment undertaken in respect of the investment by the Respondent.

There can be no doubt about the fact that the business of EDE Este has been
doing badly in the Dominican Republic. The continuing and increasing losses of
this company evidence that something has gone very wrong. The measures the
Claimant alleges that have been at the root of this situation relate to the
Respondent’s regulatory framework governing the electricity sector and the
changes that it argues have taken place or other related aspects. This,
independently from the merits of the claim, establishes an inevitable link between
the facts complained of and the protections provided by the Treaty because the
electricity sector is a regulated business. Whether the measures taken are in fact
detrimental to the investment in breach of the Treaty and are to be attributable to
the Respondent is a matter for the merits but prima facie it is not difficult to
discern that if proven they could result in liability under the Treaty.

As it has been explained above, the precise nature of the eventual breach is
also something to be determined at the merits stage. The facts alleged could
amount to a form of direct expropriation if the requirements governing this form
of taking under the Treaty and international law are met, particularly if there has
been a transfer of title. Such facts could also result in a form of indirect or
creeping expropriation if there bas been substantial deprivation of the benefits or
value of the investment, if the investor has been deprived of the control,
management or operation of the investment or some other such form of sufficient

interference with the husiness has taken nlace. Fven if the facts da nat lead to a

65. The parties would have to discuss at the merits stage whether transfer of the
title to property has taken place and its date, whether there has been a situation
amounting to confiscation or creeping expropriation or whether the stability and
predictability of such and other requii i with fair and
equitable treatment have been dramatically altered so as to result in liability and
damages. All such precise characterizations, however, are also a matter for the
merits.

66. The Tribunal is prima facie persuaded at this jurisdictional stage that if proven
on the merits the facts alleged are capable of resulting in a breach of the Treaty
and eventually in a finding of liability. The Tribunal accordingly concludes that it
has jurisdiction ratione materiae over a dispute that arises from an investment and
that could eventually result in breach of the protections granted to the investor
under the Treaty.

The third objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction: retroactive application of the

Treaty (Jurisdiction ratione temporis)

67. | The Respondent has raised a third objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction
which concerns two issues of retroactive application, one in respect of the Treaty
and the other in respect of nationality. Both relate to the Claimant's argument that
its rights are protected as from when the acts and events took place, even if this
was before the Treaty had entered into force or the Claimant had acquired the

investment as a French national.

Retroactive application of the Treaty
The Respondent’s views

The Respondent also submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction on one
further point: as the acts and events complained of not only preceded the date on
which the investment was acquired by the Claimant as a French national, a
question discussed further below, but also preceded the date of entry into force of
the Treaty on January 23, 2003, the Treaty cannot be applied retroactively to such
acts and events. The Respondent relies to this effect on Article 28 of the Vienna
Convention and the rule on non-retroactivity also examined above, just as it relies
on Article 13 of the Articles on State Responsibility insofar as there can be no
breach of an international obligation “unless the State is bound by the obligation
in question at the time the act oceurs”.*®

Neither does the Respondent believe that Articles | and 7 of the Treaty in any
way alter its non-retroactive nature and scope. It is argued in this respect that
Article | only addresses the investments covered but not the retroactive
application of the Treaty and, as held in Salini v. Jordan in relation to a similar
article in the treaty there applicable, that article “does not give the substantive
provisions of the Treaty any retrospective effect”.*” Neither could Article 7 apply
to disputes that preceded its entry into force.

The same principle was upheld, it is recalled, in the Phosphates in Morocco
case in which it was decided that “the only situations or facts falling under the
compulsory jurisdiction are those which are subsequent to the ratification...”,*
question discussed further below, but also preceded the date of entry into force of
the Treaty on January 23, 2003, the Treaty cannot be applied retroactively to such

Convention and the rule on non-retroactivity also examined above, just as it relies
on Article 13 of the Articles on State Responsibility insofar as there can be no
breach of an international obligation “unless the State is bound by the obligation

in question at the time the act occurs”.*°

just as they were upheld again in Salini v. Jordan,” Feldman and Mondev."' The
Respondent asserts that no intention of allowing for retroactive effect can be found
in the Treaty and as decided in /mpregilo the legality of the acts in question must
be determined according to the law applicable at the time of their performance.™ It
is further maintained that, as held in MC] Power, there can be no breach of an
international obligation if there is no Treaty establishing such obligation, and even
if there were a breach of an obligation under customary internationa! law before
the treaty enters into force this would not allow to have recourse to the treaty’s
arbitral jurisdiction.

71. In the Respondent’s view all acts and events complained of had ceased to exist
before the Treaty came into force, and thus there could be no continuous :ourse of
conduct as the Claimant argues. They were all one-time acts. The Respondent
recalls the requirement contained in Article 14 (2) of the Articles on State
Responsibility for a continuing character extending over the entire pericd during
which the act continues and remains in breach of an international obligation; and
that as held in Jmpregilo although acts taking place before the treaty enters into
force could have consequences after that date this does not mean that they have a
continuing character as “they occurred at a certain moment and their legality must
be determined at that moment, and not by reference to a Treaty which entered into

force at a later date”.

The Respondent further explains in support of its views that all the acts were
completed at the time of their performance, even if the consequences or effects
may have continued. As noted in the Commentaries to the Articles on State
Responsibility, “An Act does not have continuing character merely because its
effects or consequences extend in time. It must be the wrongful act as such which
continues”.®* In any event, the Respondent asserts, even if an act continues after
the Treaty came into force there will be no breach of its obligations or access to its
jurisdiction unti! after the date when the obligation began to exist for the State,
which is the principle upheld in Feldman and MCI.°°

Because of the same reason, the Claimant cannot circumvent the jurisdictional
requirements by attempting to replead its case that the acts are not only continuing
but also composite. In the Respondent’s view, the acts were and remain one-time
acts occurring before the Treaty came into force and thus, are not a part of a series
that could result in composite acts.

The Claimant's view

The Claimant has opposed this objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction on the
basis that the acts are continuing in nature and thus, they mect the criteria defined
in Article 14 (2) of the Articles on State Responsibility noted. Not only does the
breach of the Respondent’s international obligations extend during the entire
period during which the act continues but also the acts remain not in conformity
with the international obligation. The Claimant’s understanding of the meaning of

the decisions in MCI Power, Feldman and Mondev is also different fromm that of

continues”.© In any event, the Respondent asserts, even if an act continues after
the Treaty came into force there will be no breach of its obligations or access to its
jurisdiction until! after the date when the obligation began to exist for the State,
which is the principle upheld in Feldman and MCz.°°

Because of the same reason, the Claimant cannot circumvent the jurisdictional
requirements by attempting to replead its case that the acts are not only continuing

but also composite. In the Respondent’s view, the acts were and remain one-time

such prior acts for “purposes of understanding the background, the causes, or
scope of the violations of the BIT that occurred after the entry into force’ or the
relevance of prior events to breaches taking place after the entry into force.°*

The Claimant asserts that moreover those acts are composite in nature and
scope and combine with the acts and omissions occurring after the entry into force
to constitute a violation, thus also meeting the requirement of them having an
aggregate effect as stated in Article 15 of the Articles on State Responsibility.
Those acts may also be taken into account as a factual basis or to provide evidence
of intent in respect of obligations coming into existence at a later point in time.””
The same approach was adopted in both Mondev and Tecmed in that they took into
consideration the factual basis of events that occurred before the entry into force
of the treaty.”

Thus, the acts complained of could not be considered individual acts as those
that were taken into consideration in /mpregilo for concluding that they had
occurred at a specific point in time;”’ the acts here have not ceased to exist and
continue to be in violation of the Treaty unti! now. The Claimant refers in
particular to those acts concerning the non-implementation of the tariff regime, the
failure to pay the indemnification promised and the failure to contribute the
promised capital, and other questions such as not enforcing measures against theft
or not extending treatment as favorable as that accorded to another electricity

company. The Claimant also recalls in this context that a tribunal has held that the

aggregate effect as stated in Article 15 of the Articles on State Responsibility.

failure to pay sums due under a contract constitutes continuing conduct actionable
under the treaty,”

The Claimant further argues in support of its views that Article | of the Treaty
protects assets invested in accordance with the legislation of the Contracting Party

in whose territory it is made “...before or after the entry into force of this

Agreement”, as Article 7(1) and (2) grants jurisdiction to decide “[a]ny dispute

relating to investments...” of the Contracting Parties. On this basis, it
distinguishes this Treaty from those considered in a number of other decisions that
have refused to accept retroactive effect. The Claimant also argues that this is the
position under Article 28 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties which
does not allow for the retroactive effect of treaties only when the treaty does not
address retroactivity and does not contain an expression of the intent of the parties
in this connection, which is not the case in the instant dispute. The Claimant
asserts that a number of arbitral decisions have directly or indirectly supported this
interpretation.”
The Tribunal’s findings on the retroactive application of the Treaty

The Treaty contains certain provisions concerning the applicaticn of the
principle of ratione temporis, particularly its Articles | and 7. While there are
other aspects of the principle of ratione ftemporis as applied to substantive
obligations or jurisdictional questions, the instant case is simpler from the point of
view that all conclusions will be governed by the rules on non-retroactivity and
the principle of intertemporal law. The concept of continuing and composite acts,

cumulative effects over time, must also be discussed in connection with these
basic principles of the law of treaties.

The Tribunal accordingly first notes that the basic principle in this matter is
the non-retroactivity of treaties, from which rights and obligations arise. Article 28
of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties sets this principle in unequivocal
terms, except if the intention of the parties indicates otherwise. Article 28 of that
Convention provides indeed that “Unless a different intention appears from the
treaty or is otherwise established, its provisions do not bind a party in relation to
any act or fact which took place or any situation which ceased to exist before the
date of the entry into force of the treaty with respect to that party”.

The principle of non-retroactivity is not in doubt in this case and the parties do
not appear to disagree about it.” It is accepted that the Treaty entered into force on
January 23, 2002, and that the Claimant became the investor on November 12,
2004. While the parties have provided their respective listings of dates aid events,
the discussion about specific dates of occurrence of such acts and events is
something that has to be undertaken in connection with the merits; the Tribunal
can accept, however, for jurisdictional purposes, that both parties are correct in
identifying situations that took place either before or after that date. While under
the general principle the Tribunal would lack jurisdiction over treaty violations in
respect of acts and events taking place before the Treaty entered into force, it
would clearly have jurisdiction for such acts and events occurring after the critical
date.

The issue here is thus whether the Treatv has provided for retroactive effect hv

terms, except if the intention of the parties indicates otherwise. Article 28 of that
Convention provides indeed that “Unless a different intention appears from the
treaty or is otherwise established, its provisions do not bind a party in relation to
any act or fact which took place or any situation which ceased to exist before the

date of the entry into force of the treaty with respect to that party”.

 

The principle of non-retroactivity is not in doubt in this case and the parties do

not appear to disagree about it.” It is accepted that the Treaty entered inty force on

The Claimant believes that both Article | and Article 7 (1) and (2) of the Treaty
do establish a different intention, the first by extending its application to assets
invested “before or after the entry into force of this Agreement” and the second by
granting jurisdiction over “any dispute relating to investments”. The Respondent
does not of course share this view.

The Tribunal is of the view that the Claimant's interpretation of the articles
noted is not the correct one in respect of retroactivity of the Treaty and that no
such intention can be identified in the Treaty or otherwise. Article | refers to
“assets that shall be or shall have been invested” before or after the date of entry
into force of the Treaty, but if the intention had been to allow for retroactivity one
would expect that it would require a clear and unequivocal expression of intention
to that effect, which is not found in the Treaty or elsewhere.

To infer that this might have been the result sought by the parties in the
absence of a clear expression of intention to that effect would upset the normal
meaning of the rules on retroactivity under both the Treaty and the Vienna
Convention,

The Tribunal concludes accordingly that it has jurisdiction for alleged treaty
violations over the acts and events that have taken place after the entry into force
of the Treaty on January 23, 2003, but not over those that have taken place before
this date.

A similar concept supporting this conclusion, rooted in the principle of
intertemporal law, is well supported by the /sland of Palmas award to the effect

Droit International concluded in respect of intertemporal law that “[uJnless
otherwise indicated, the temporal sphere of application of any norm of public
international law shall be determined in accordance with the general principle of
law by which any fact, action or situation must be assessed in the light of the rules
of law that are contemporaneous with it””®

Jmpregilo also well evidenced that retroactive effect is not a matter to be
welcomed and that the legality of the acts needs to be determined according to the
law applicable at the time of their performance.” The interpretation of the Treaty
suggested by the Claimant would lead to the opposite result, that is the acts and
omissions that took place before the Treaty became effective would be judged not
by the law contemporary with those acts and events but by the law as established
in a later treaty of which the Claimant is a beneficiary.

The Tribunal is persuaded, however, that there might be situations in which
the continuing nature of the acts and events questioned could result in a breach as
a result of acts commencing before the critical date but which only becorne legally
characterized as a wrongful act in violation of an international obligation when
such an obligation had come into existence after the effective date of the treaty

or the relevance of prior events to breaches taking place
after the treaty’s entry into force.”

Jn such a case, the act is indeed continuous but its legal materialization as a
breach occurs when the Treaty has come into force and the investor qualifies
under its requirements. Thus, there is no strict issue of retroactive application of
the treaty concerned, and Article 28 of the Vienna Convention is not implicated.
If it is merely the continuing effects of a one-time individual act that as such has
ceased to exist that is involved, then the non-retroactivity principle fully applies,*”
but when both the existence of the wrongful act and its effects continue both
before and after the critical date, then the non-retroactivity principle will not
exclude the application of the obligations of the treaty to the acts and omissions
that occur after its effective date.

At the hearing on jurisdiction, the Tribunal had the occasion to discuss with
the parties specific examples of acts, independent from those eventually involved
in this case, that might be considered continuing in nature in which the act and its
effects could be found to result in the breach of an international obligation after
the critical date.! The Tribunal is again grateful to counsel for the parties, which
most competently explained their respective points of view on this and other
matters and helped the Tribunal to better understand their arguments in this
respect.

It follows that the Tribunal must be satisfied that there could be a breach of

obligations under the Treaty for jurisdiction over treaty violations to be
established and this again can aniv hannen ance the ablioatinn has came inte

force. The actual determination of which acts specifically meet the continuing
requirement is a matter for the merits because it is only then that it can be decided
which acts amount to breaches and when this took place. At the jurisdictional
stage only the principle can be identified.

The same reasoning applies to composite acts. While normally acts will take
place at a given point in time independently of their continuing effects. and they
might at that point be wrongful or not, it is conceivable also that there might be
situations in which each act considered in isolation will not result in a breach of a
treaty obligation, but if considered as a part of a series of acts leading in the same
direction they could result in a breach at the end of the process of aggregation,
when the treaty obligation will have come into force. This is what normally wil!
happen in situations in which creeping or indirect expropriation is found, and
could also be the case with a denial of justice as a result of undue delays in
judging a case by a municipal court. As noted in Article 15 of the Articles on State
Responsibility, the series of actions or omissions must be defined in the aggregate
as wrongful and when taken together it ‘is ‘sufficient to constitute the wrongful
act”. But of course the latter determination can only be made when the obligation
is in force.

In situations of this kind, the preceding acts might be relevant as factual
background to the violation that takes place after the critical date, and this is the
meaning that the cases discussed above will have in considering that factual
background and its relevance to explain later breaches. As the Respondent has

rightly recalled this exnlains why in Tecemed while often helieved to have

place at a given point in time independently of their continuing effects, and they
might at that point be wrongful or not, it is conceivable also that there might be
situations in which each act considered in isolation will not result in a breach of a
treaty obligation, but if considered as a part of a series of acts leading in the same
direction they could result in a breach at the end of the process of aggregation,
when the treaty obligation will have come imto force. This is what normally will

happen in situations in which creeping or indirect expropriation is found, and

such acts represented “converging action towards the same result”. In such a

situation, the obligations of the treaty will not be applied retroactively but only to
acts that will be the final result of that convergence and which take place when the
treaty has come into force.

93. In none of these situations, as noted, is there a case of retroactive application
of the Treaty but one in which it shall only be applied at the time it has entered
into force and on the basis of the factual background of acts and events that have
preceded the critical date. On occasions the permanency of the act or its
continuing character— have led tribunals to consider that limitation periods extend
accordingly and start running on the date the breach ceased to exist, thus being
also continuously renewed. This is also the view that some courts have taken in
respect of human rights violations.™ This view, however, has been opposed by
some decisions of international tribunals not upholding interpretations that could
result in suspension or prolongation of limitation periods expressly introduced to
avoid such effect.’ While in some cases and in the light of thei: specific
circumstances this extension of the limitation period can be artificial, even then
the exercise is not the retroactive application of the treaty but an exercise in
bringing past and preceding acts under the time period in which the treaty does
apply. In any event, for an exception to the basic rule on non-retroactivity to be
accepted one would expect a clear intention of the parties to a treaty to that

effect,®® which is not the case here.

of the Treaty but one in which it shall only be applied at the time it has entered

preceded the critical date. On occasions the permanency of the act ~or its
continuing character— have led tribunals to consider that limitation periods extend

The Tribunal accordingly concludes that to the extent that on the consideration
of the merits an act is proved to have originated before the critical date but
continues as such to be in existence after that date, amounting to a breach of a
Treaty obligation in force at the time it occurs, it will come within the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction.” This will also be the case if a series of acts results in the aggregate
in such breach of an obligation in force at the time the accumulation culminates

after the critical date.

The fourth objection to the Tribunal's Jurisdiction: Nationality of the investor

(Jurisdiction nationality ratione temporis and nationality ratione personac)

The questions of nationality that the Respondent has raised as objections to
jurisdiction have two aspects that the Tribunal needs to consider separately. The
first issue relates to the question of the applicable rules and principles soverning
when the requirement of nationality needs to be met and thus poses a question of
jurisdiction ratione temporis .The second concerns whether the different entities
participating in the investment through the complex structure that has been
described qualify as a French protected investor. This is strictly an issue of
jurisdiction ratione personae and will be considered separately.

a) The rules and principles governing nationality ratione temporis
The Respondent's view

The Respondent also argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because the

Claimant fails to comply with the requirements of nationality under the Treaty and

international law as it only acquired the investment on November 12, 2004, while
in such breach of an obligation in force at the time the accumulation culminates

after the critical date.

The fourth objection to the Tribunal's Jurisdiction: Nationality of the investor

 

(Jurisdictic ionality ratione temporis and nationality ratione personae)

The questions of nationality that the Respondent has raised as objections to

jurisdiction have two aspects that the Tribunal needs to consider separately. The

97.

45

investment was owned by AES, a company registered in the United States, and if
any damage was caused it would have been caused to it, not to the later French
purchaser. AES, however, made no claim for damages.

The Respondent explains that the Treaty applies only in respect of French
investors and that the Claimant cannot claim for acts which took place before the
date it became the investor as there was then no bond of nationality. In addition,
the law of diplomatic protection requires nationality to be met at two critical dates,
the date of the injury and the date of bringing the claim. The implications that
might arise in this respect from the transfer of an investment were aiready
addressed with due caution in the Vivendi Annulment in which the Committee held
that “issues might well arise where there has been a transfer of control of a local
company from a shareholder of one nationality to a shareholder of another”,®® and
provided an example that resembles the case here: “For example, if Dycasa had a
Spanish treaty claim prior to March 1996, questions might arise as to how that
claim could be later transferred to a French company, or as to how CGE could
have acquired a French treaty claim in respect of conduct conceming an
investment which it did not hold at the time the conduct occurred and which at the
time did not have French nationality”.

The Respondent has provided a detailed list of the dates or periods in which
the alleged acts and events took place, ranging from 1999 through the summer of
2004, dates all that precede the acquisition of the investment by the Claimant on
November 12, 2004.

The Claimant's view

date it became the investor as there was then no bond of nationality. In addition,
the law of diplomatic protection requires nationality to be met at two critical dates,
the date of the injury and the date of bringing the claim. The implications that
might arise in this respect from the transfer of an investment were already
addressed with due caution in the Vivendi Annulment in which the Committee held
that “issues might well arise where there has been a transfer of control of a local

company from a shareholder of one nationality to a shareholder of another”,®* and

46

99. The Claimant submits an entirely different view, based on the argument that
the Treaty applies retroactively to acts and omissions having taken place before
the date of acquisition of the investment or the date of the Treaty’s entry into
force. The question of jurisdiction ratione ‘emporis in connection with the date of
entry into force of the Treaty has been discussed above. The Claimant explains
that all such acts and omissions are continuing and composite in nature and scope.
In any event, it is asserted that the Tribunal at a minimum has jurisdiction over the
acts of omissions having taken place after November 12, 2004, a list of which was
also provided.

100. The Claimant further argues that in accordance with the above provisions and
interpretations the Treaty does not require a bond of nationality at the date of the
breach, as the Respondent has maintained. Neither do the principles of diplomatic
protection apply to investment treaties that emerged precisely to overcome the
shortcomings of international law in this respect. In the Claimant’s view, it is not
unusual for tribunals to apply the protection of the treaty to events that have taken
place before the investment became the asset of an investor having a different
nationality, as happened in Fedax in which the obligation to pay arose before the
investment became Dutch, or in several cases based on legitimate expectations at
the time of the investment.” The Vivendi Annulment discussed some
considerations about the issue of transfer and nationality in dictum but ultimately
found that it did not need to address the issue.

The Tribunal’s findings on nationality ratione temporis

101. The Tribunal has examined above the parties’ arguments on the retroactive

that all such acts and omissions are continuing and composite in nature and scope.
In any event, it is asserted that the Tribunal at a minimum has jurisdiction over the
acts of omissions having taken place after November 12, 2004, a list of which was
also provided.

100. The Claimant further argues that in accordance with the above provisions and
interpretations the Treaty does not require a bond of nationality at the date of the

breach, as the Respondent has maintained. Neither do the principles of diplomatic

47

arguments are raised in connection with the question of nationality and wil! not be
repeatcd here. The same conclusions the Tribunal reached in respect of the
interpretation of those articles is applicable in this other context.

102. There are, however, additional questions the Tribunal needs to address
specifically in connection with nationality. To this end, the Tribunal will look
first to the express terms of the Treaty, and second, to the law of diplomatic
protection.

103. First, the Treaty is between the French Republic and the Dominican Republic.
The Treaty has as its goal the stimulation of “capital and technology transfers
between the two countries in the interest of their economic development.” The
term “companies” is expressly defined as “all legal entities incorporated in the
territory of one of the parties, in conformity with its legislation and where its
headquarters is located...” Article 2 refers to “investments made by the nationals
and companies of the other Party...” Throughout the Treaty, it continually refers
to the Contracting Parties and their “nationals and companies.” The dispute clause
in Article 7 applies by its express terms lo “Any dispute relating to investments
between one of the Contracting Parties and a national or company of the other
Contracting Party ...”.

104. As with the retroactive application of the Treaty, if the intention had been to
allow for claims relating to any investment, independently of whether the claimant
is eligible as a national of the other Contracting Party, one would have expected a

clear and unequivocal expression of intention to that effect, which is not the case.

first to the express terms of the Treaty, and second, to the law of diplomatic
protection.

103. First, the Treaty is between the French Republic and the Dominican Republic.
The Treaty has as its goal the stimulation of “capital and technology transfers
between the two countries in the interest of their economic development.” The
term “companies” is expressly defined as “all legal entities incorporated in the

territory of one of the parties, in conformity with its legislation and where its

48

contained in the Treaty, thus making evident that the investment will be that of
those qualifying under the requirements of nationality

105. Similarly, the fact that Article 7 extends jurisdiction to any dispute concerning
the investment does not mean that it could cover investments that are not eligible
in terms of nationality. That article specifically refers to disputes between a
“Contracting Party and a national or company of the other Contracting Party”. As
with most investment treaties, the meaning of this provision is that the investment
might have been made before or after the date of the Treaty, but that the treaty
violation falling under the Tribunal’s jurisdiction must have occurred after the
entry into force of the Treaty and the investor became its beneficiary as an eligible
national of the relevant Contracting Party. One would expect any derogation of
this principle to be express and not implied. The Treaty could thus not apply to
any acts or omissions that occurred before that date because the investor’s
nationality was different from that required by the treaty and did not permit it to
qualify as a protected investor under the Treaty.

106. All of these terms lead inevitably to the conclusion that the Treaty was
designed to protect only the nationals and companies of the Contracting Parties, in
this case France. The investment of AES, a company incorporated in the United
States, is not protected by the terms of this Treaty. Thus, the investment could not
be protected by this Treaty until both this Treaty entered into force and Claimant,
as a French company, acquired the investment and it became a French investment.

107. Accordingly, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over acts and events that took

“Contracting Party and a national or company of the other Contracting Party”. As
with most investment treaties, the meaning of this provision is that the investment
might have been made before or after the date of the Treaty, but that the treaty
violation falling under the Tribunal’s jurisdiction must have occurred after the
entry into force of the Treaty and the investor became its beneficiary as an eligible
national of the relevant Contracting Party. One would expect any derogation of

this principle to be express and not implied. The Treaty could thus not apply to

49

jurisdiction over acts and omissions that took place after November 12, 2004, at
which time both the Treaty had entered into force and the investor had become a
qualifying French national.

108. Second, the law of diplomatic protection also supports this conclusion. It is
necessary to keep in mind that while it is true that investment law has meant in
some respects a departure from the law governing diplomatic protection and the
traditional law of international claims, this is correct largely to the extent that
applicable treaties and conventions have so established by providing rules
different from those of diplomatic protection. While many such treaties, like the
one now before the Tribunal, provide for rules on the definition of who is a
national entitled to its protection, seldom do they provide for a rule establishing
the moment at which such nationality is required. The rules governing issues not
addressed by the specific language of the treaty may sometimes be provided by
the law of diplomatic protection, which apply as customary internationa! law, and
thus, provides for a residual role for at least some aspects of the law of diplomatic
protection. In the instant case, however, the Respondent has also persuasively
explained that the Treaty itself is consistent with such rules and principles.”!

109. The fact that such treaties have substituted for diplomatic protection and may
even prohibit its exercise by the States that are parties to them, does not mean that
the basic principles have also been automatically derogated as it is rather the
means for materializing an international claim that have changed but not in all

aspects its substantive requirements. It follows that the principle that a claimant
muct have the natianality af the relevant Contractino Party at the fire of the

some respects a departure from the law governing diplomatic protection and the
traditional law of international claims, this is correct largely to the extent that
applicable treaties and conventions have so established by providing rules
different from those of diplomatic protection. While many such treaties, like the
one now before the Tribunal, provide for rules on the definition of who is a
national entitled to its protection, seldom do they provide for a rule establishing

the moment at which such nationality is required. The rules governing issues not

50

claim is introduced directly by the individual or company concerned or by the
State of nationality on its behalf. Flexibility has been introduced in respect of
some rules of diplomatic protection, particularly on whether the nationality is
required also at the time of adjudicating the claim or at the time of its submission
— an issue which in any event is not relevant here, but this flexibility does not
extend to the need to have the nationality at the time of the breach.

110. This finding does not mean that transfers of rights eventually giving rise to
claims under a Treaty cannot take place, but questions of nationality, as discussed
in Vivendi, even if in dictum, set a limit to the application of investment treaties to
these transactions. One such limit is that the transaction in question must be a
bona fide transaction and not devised to allow a national of a State not qualifying
for protection under a treaty to obtain an inappropriate jurisdictional advantage
otherwise unavailable by transferring its rights after-the-fact to a qualifying
national, as occurred in Mihaly and Banro. While AES at the time did not have the
benefits of any treaty protection and the Claimant in this case has such benefits as
a French national under the Treaty, nothing suggests that the transaction that took
place here was designed to obtain an inappropriate jurisdictional advantage.

111. Another limit that has implications in this matter is the conseat of the
Respondent to the extension of the arbitration clause or agreement to a different
beneficiary. While in this case apparently no arbitration clause under a treaty
benefited AES, and thus, none could be transferred to the Claimant, there is a
question about the consent to the transaction and related information available to

the Respondent. Just as the Respondent cannot ignore that the Claimant became a

extend to the need to have the nationality at the time of the breach.

110. This finding does not mean that transfers of rights eventually giving rise to
claims under a Treaty cannot take place, but questions of nationality, as discussed
in Vivendi, even if in dictum, set a limit to the application of investment treaties to
these transactions. One such limit is that the transaction in question must be a
bona fide transaction and not devised to allow a national of a State not qualifying

for protection under a treaty to obtain an inappropriate jurisdictional advantage

51

acts and events that took place before it actually became eligible under the Treaty.
The principle upheld in Mihaly to the effect that no one can transfer a better title
than he actually has without the consent of the host State is equally applicable here
to a situation in which no one can claim without such consent a retroactive
application of treaty rights to acts that occurred before the Claimant became an
investor under the Treaty.

112. As noted above, the Claimant has also argued that the acts that took place
before it became the investor are continuing and composite and accordingly
transcend their own time extending to a later date on which it had become a
protected national. This argument has been discussed above in the context of the
date of entry into force of the Treaty and does not change the conclusions
explained in respect of nationality.

b) The situation concerning nationality ratione personae
The Respondent's views

113. The Respondent argues that the Tribunal! could only exercise jurisdiction in
this case if it is satisfied that EDE Este’s shares were owned by a French investor
at the time of the breach and at the time of submission of the claim. Quite
separately from the question of ratione temporis noted above, the essence of this
argument is that as the Claimant did not have any ownership interest in EDE Este
because in light of the corporate structure chosen there has never existed a bond of
nationality under the Treaty. Société Générale has been absent from the
transaction concerning the purchase of AES’s shares, which was envisioned,

orchestrated and executed exclusively by TCW. which is a United States entitv. It

investor under the Treaty.

112. As noted above, the Claimant has also argued that the acts that took place
before it became the investor are continuing and composite and accordingly
transcend their own time extending to a later date on which it had become a
protected national. This argument has been discussed above in the context of the
date of entry into force of the Treaty and does not change the conclusions

explained in respect of nationality.

contractual right to payment for services provided by a United States company to
a United States partnership for services to that partnership in the United States,
The “French connection” in respect of which the Tribunal expressed interest in the
hearing has accordingly not been proven or established.”
The Claimant's view

114. The Claimant believes that as it has satisfied the requirements of the Treaty in
connection with the existence of an investment and as it is a company registered in
France, and therefore, the Tribuna! has jurisdiction over its claims in the instant
dispute. In the Claimant’s view, nothing in Articles I or 7 of the Treaty require
that the Claimant be actively involved or approve the specific details of any given
investment. These were entrusted to its affiliate TCW and through it the Claimant
participates in the chain of interests giving expression to its investment. The
Claimant explains that decentralized decision making is common place in any
large group of companies.” To the extent that the Claimant is within the chain of
ownership or control, as is the case here, then it qualifies as an investor with
standing to bring a claim. It follows that in the Claimant’s view a sufficient
“French connection” exists to establish jurisdiction over such claims.”
The Tribunal’s findings on nationality and the corporate structure

115. The complex corporate structure that characterizes this case has implications
in terms of the nationality of the Claimant. At first it appeared that the Claimant
was the French shareholder of TCW and through it the indirect share owner of
50% of EDE Este, by passing the holdings in Dominican Energy Holdings LP and

Dominican Republic Enerev Holdings Ltd. a chain that extended from upstream to

the downstream segments of the investment. To that extent, the requirement of
nationality seemed to travel from top to bottom until resulting in the final 50%
ownership of EDE Este.

116. Two additional aspects relevant in this respect surfaced, however, during the
hearing on jurisdiction. The first is that Société Générale’s participation in TCW
has been in a percentage of ownership that has varied over time, which will
eventually attain 100% participation. As the Claimant is entitled to claim for its
participation, not for that of interests which are not protected under the Treaty
because of their different nationality, this will provide a different protected interest
as that participation changes. This issue might have relevance if in the end
damages are awarded on the merits, but the jurisdictional principle must be noted
at the outset.

117. The second issue brought to the attention of the Tribunal on that occasion, and
which was expressly addressed by the parties at the request of the Tribunal in their
post-hearing briefs, is the participation of other companies in the corporate
structure. Two are the companies that are of relevance in this regard. The first is
Sosa Partners LLC which, as explained, owns 49.9% of TCW Energy Advisors
LLC, with 50.1% owned by TAMCO, an affiliate of TCW. TCW Energy Advisors
LLC is the General Partner of Dominican Energy Holding LP.

118. The Respondent has convincingly argued that Sosa Partners is not a qualifying
French national under the Treaty. While it is owned by a group of TCW’s
employees and officials, it is a separate company registered in Delaware, and as

far as the Tribunal can determine it bas no cornorate linkage with TCW. whether

has been in a percentage of ownership that has varied over time, which will
eventually attain 100% participation.°® As the Claimant is entitled to claim for its
participation, not for that of interests which are not protected under the Treaty
because of their different nationality, this will provide a different protected interest
as that participation changes. This issue might have relevance if in the end
damages are awarded on the merits, but the jurisdictional principle must be noted

at the outset.

in terms of affiliation or participation.°® While the French nationality of the
shareholder can extend to TCW as an affiliate of Société Générale, it cannot
extend beyond to an unrelated company such as Sosa Partners. It has been argued
that Sosa was an arrangement related to the compensation of TCW’s executives as
it is normal within the industry,”” but not even this would transform that company
into an affiliate of TCW or even less into a qualifying investment. Sosa is not
owned directly or indirectly by Société Générale, a French company, and Sosa’s
ownership has not been revealed to have any French connection. It follows that the
Claimant’s entitlement will be limited first by its shareholding interest in TCW,
which has varied over time, and next by the participation of TAMCO in TCW
Energy Advisors LLC, which amounts to 50.1%.

119. The second relevant company that has surfaced in the context of the corporate
structure is Peste LLC, registered in Nevada, which owns as a Limited Partner
100% of the shares of Dominican Energy Holdings LP, the company to which
TCW Energy Advisors LLC is as noted the General Partner. Peste LLC also
cannot benefit from the French nationality of the Claimant. The issue is then how
the interest in Dominican Energy Holdings LP — the ultimate owner cf 50% of
EDE Este, is shared between a 100% shareholder (Peste LLC) and a General
Partner (TCW Energy Advisors LLC) in which the Claimant participates within
the limits indicated.

120. The distribution of benefits has followed an equally difficult arrangement in

the context of a strategy directed to prevent potential damages to the Claimant

 

into an affiliate of TCW or even less into a qualifying investment. Sosa is not
owned directly or indirectly by Société Générale, a French company, and Sosa’s
ownership has not been revealed to have any French connection. It follows that the
Claimant’s entitlement will be limited first by its shareholding interest in TCW,
which has varied over time, and next by the participation of TAMCO in TCW
Energy Advisors LLC, which amounts to 50.1%.

119. The second relevant company that has surfaced in the context of the corporate

55

expression of an indirect benefit-sharing arrangement. These arrangements consist
in the Limited Partner receiving a portion of the available cash amounting to US $
2.5 million less certain deductions, while the General Partner will be reinunerated
by means of a management fee “equal to 90% of the amount of Available Cash
available for distribution”.°* While the Tribunal accepts that this is the
remuneration of the Claimant’s investment, its interest will also be limited to the
amount of this remuneration.

121, It follows from the above that the Claimant’s nationality will indeed protect its
interest, but limited by three factors: its percentage of participation in TCW at a
given time; its percentage of TAMCO’s participation in TCW Energy Advisors
LLC (50.1%) and percentage of remuneration of the latter as the General Partner
in Dominican Energy Holdings LP (90% of available cash as calculated in the
Partnership Agreement). Interests beyond these participations are not protected
under the Treaty between France and the Dominican Republic on account of their
different nationalities.
