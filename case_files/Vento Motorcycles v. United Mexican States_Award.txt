INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

This case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”) on the basis of the North American Free
Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”), which entered into force for the United Mexican States and
the United States of America on 1 January 1994, and the Rules Governing the Additional
Facility for the Administration of Proceedings by the Secretariat of the International Centre

for Settlement of Investment Disputes (the “ICSID Additional Facility Rules”).

The claimant is Vento Motorcycles, Inc. (“Vento” or the “Claimant”) a corporation

incorporated under the laws of Texas with its registered office in Laredo, Texas.
The respondent is the United Mexican States (“Mexico” or the “Respondent”).

The Claimant and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the “Parties.” The Parties’

representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).

The dispute relates to Mexico’s denial of NAFTA preferential ad valorem import tariffs to
motorcycles assembled by the Claimant in the United States and exported to Mexico, which
allegedly culminated in the impairment and ultimate destruction of the Claimant’s business
under a joint venture agreement that it entered into with MotorBike, S.A. (“MotorBike”)
for the sale and marketing of motorcycles in Mexico on 1 October 2002 (the “Joint

Venture Agreement”).

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On 20 February 2017, pursuant to NAFTA Article 1119, Vento served a notice of its

intention to submit a claim to arbitration (the “Notice of Intent”) to the Respondent.!

On 8 August 2017, the Secretary-General of ICSID received a request for arbitration dated
7 August 2017 for the institution of proceedings under Article 2 of the ICSID Additional
Facility Rules, submitted by the Claimant against Mexico on its own behalf under NAFTA

' Exhibit 4 to the Request for Arbitration, Notice of Intent (20 February 2017).

4

Article 1116 and on behalf of MotorBike, S.A. and Mototransp, S.A., two Mexican
enterprises, under NAFTA Article 1117 (the “Request for Arbitration”). Simultaneously,
the Claimant submitted a request for approval of access to the Additional Facility under
Article 2(a) of the ICSID Additional Facility Rules. The Request for Arbitration was
supplemented by the Claimant’s letters of 24 August, 1, 8 and 12 September 2017.

On 15 September 2017, the Secretary-General of ICSID approved access to the Additional
Facility and registered the Request for Arbitration in accordance with Articles 4 of the
ICSID Additional Facility Rules. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General of
ICSID invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in

accordance with Chapter III of the ICSID Additional Facility Rules.

NAFTA Article 1123 provides that the Tribunal be comprise three arbitrators, one
arbitrator appointed by each of the Parties and the third, the presiding arbitrator, appointed

by agreement of the Parties.

On 3 November 2017, the Claimant appointed Prof. David Gantz, a national of the United
States of America, as arbitrator. Prof. Gantz accepted the appointment by letter of 10
November 2017. Together with his acceptance, Prof. Gantz provided the Parties with a

declaration of his independence and impartiality and a disclosure statement.

On 6 November 2017, pursuant to NAFTA Article 1124, the Claimant requested that the

Secretary-General of ICSID appoint the arbitrators not yet appointed.

On 17 November 2017, the Respondent appointed Mr. Hugo Perezcano, a national of
Mexico, as arbitrator. Mr. Perezcano accepted the appointment on 5 December 2017.
Together with his acceptance, Mr. Perezcano provided the Parties with a declaration of his

independence and impartiality and a disclosure statement.

On 28 November 2017, the Secretary-General of ICSID proposed that the appointment of
the third arbitrator and President of the Tribunal be made through a strike-and-rank list of
seven candidates. By communications of 29 November and 1 December 2017, the
Claimant and the Respondent, respectively, accepted the proposal from the Secretary-

General of ICSID.

On 5 January 2018, in accordance with the agreed procedure, the Secretary-General of
ICSID provided the Parties with a list of seven candidates. Each Party submitted its ranking

of candidates on 16 January 2018.

By letter of 17 January 2018, the Secretary-General of ICSID informed the Parties that the
overall most preferred candidate was Dr. Andres Rigo Sureda, a national of the Kingdom
of Spain, and that, in accordance with ICSID Additional Facility Article 11(2), the Centre
was going to seek his acceptance of the appointment as President of the Tribunal. Dr. Rigo
Sureda accepted his appointment on 18 January 2018 and provided the Parties with a

declaration of his independence and impartiality.

On 19 January 2018, in accordance with Article 6(3) of the ICSID Additional Facility
Rules, the Secretary-General of ICSID notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had
accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been
constituted on that date. Ms. Marisa Planells-Valero, ICSID Legal Counsel, was

designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.

In accordance with Article 9 of the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, the Tribunal held a

first session with the Parties on 12 March 2018, by telephone conference.

Following the first session, on 2 April 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1
recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters and the decision of the
Tribunal on disputed issues, including the procedural calendar for this arbitration.
Procedural Order No. | provided, inter alia, that the applicable ICSID Additional Facility
Rules were those in effect from 10 April 2006, except to the extent that they were modified
by Section B of NAFTA Chapter Eleven. It also indicated that the procedural languages
were English and Spanish and that the place of arbitration was Toronto (Canada). On the
same date, the Tribunal invited the Parties to file submissions by 11 April 2018 on the
matters of confidentiality, transparency, and publication of documents, which had been
discussed during the first session. On 1 May 2018, after various exchanges with the Parties,

the Tribunal issued a decision on Confidentiality, Transparency, and Publication.

by Mr. Isaac Calderén, Mr. César Niifiez-Cazares, Mr. Javier Sarro, Mr. Gabriel Arriaga,
and Mr. Guillermo Massieu; and expert reports by Mr. Gerardo Lozano, Mr. Edgar Garcia

and, on damages, by Mr. Rodrigo Gémez and Mr. Oscar SAnchez.

On 1 October 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 on the Respondent’s

On 28 December 2018, the Parties informed the Tribunal of their agreement to modify the

procedural calendar.

On 25 January 2019 the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 on the Claimant’s Second

Request for Production of Documents.

On 19 February 2019, after various exchanges with the Parties, the Tribunal issued an
amended procedural calendar extending to 15 July 2019 the time-limit for the Respondent
to submit its Rejoinder and confirming that the hearing would take place from 18 to 22

José Alberto Ortizar, Mr. Daniel Ortiz Nashiki, Mr. Michael Hu, Mr. Eduardo Gémez

damages, by Mr. Rodrigo Gomez and Mr. Oscar Sanchez; and additional expert reports by
Mr. Leonardo Giacchino, Mr. James Lloyd Loftis, and Mr. Eduardo Diaz Gavito. In its
Reply, the Claimant informed that it was withdrawing the claims made on behalf of

MotorBike and Mototransp under NAFTA Article 1117(1).

On 19 March 2018, the Claimant informed of certain discrepancies in the index of factual
exhibits and legal authorities attached to its Reply. The Claimant also transmitted the
witness statements of Ms. Sara Patricia Ortega Dominguez and Mr. Alan Eini and the
original Spanish version of the Second Expert report on damages by Mr. Rodrigo Gomez
and Mr. Oscar Sanchez, which it had accidentally omitted to submit with its Reply. The
Claimant undertook that these documents had been completed and executed by their

respective affiants on 14 March 2019.

On 20 March 2019, on the basis of the Claimant’s delay in completing the filing of its
Reply, the Respondent requested a one-week extension for the submission of its second

request for documents. On that same day, the Claimant agreed to the requested extension.

By a second communication of that same date, the Claimant informed that, together with
its Reply, it had also inadvertently submitted incorrect versions of Dr. Giacchino’s second
expert report and of Mr. César Ntifiez Cazares’s second witness statement. By this same
communication, the Claimant provided a corrected version of Dr. Giacchino’s report and
a third witness statement by Mr. César Ntifiez Cazares explaining how he intended his
second statement to read. On 22 March 2019, in view of the Parties’ agreement, the
Tribunal granted the one-week extension requested by the Respondent for the filing of its

second request for documents.

Also on 22 March 2019, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to strike from the record

deadline for its Reply. The Respondent also requested an order from the Tribunal holding
Vento, MotorBike and Mototransp jointly liable for any costs awarded to the Respondent.
On 29 March 2019, the Claimant submitted observations on the Respondent’s request. On
12 April 2019, the Tribunal decided to reserve its decision on the Claimant’s Alternative
TNLF Claim and to reject the Respondent’s request to strike documents from the record.
Nevertheless, the Tribunal granted an opportunity for the Respondent to request an

extension for the submission of its Rejoinder.

On 23 April 2019, the Tribunal and the Parties were informed that Ms. Planells-Valero
would be taking temporary leave, and that Ms. Alicia Martin Blanco, ICSID Legal Counsel,

would serve as Secretary of the Tribunal during her absence.

On 17 May 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 on the Respondent’s Second

Request for Production of Documents.

On 2 July 2019, the Respondent requested an extension to file its Rejoinder by 2 August
2019. On 8 July 2019, the Claimant opposed Respondent’s request and proposed a new
date for the submission of the Respondent’s Rejoinder or, in the alternative, permission to
submit an errata list pertaining to its Reply. On 9 July 2019, the Tribunal granted the
extension requested by the Respondent and the Claimant’s request to file an errata list. The

Claimant submitted the errata list on 12 July 2019.
On 26 June 2019, the Parties submitted an agreed procedural calendar to the Tribunal.

Pursuant to the agreed procedural calendar, on 2 August 2019, the Respondent filed its
Rejoinder (“Rejoinder”), accompanied by exhibits R-0085 to R-0148; legal authorities
RL-0035 to RL-045, witness statements by Ms. Itzel Ivén Martinez Hernandez, Mr. Juan
Diaz, and Ms. Georgina Estrada, second witness statements by Mr. Gabriel Oliver Garcia,
Mr. José Ramon Jaregui Tejeda, and Mr. Jorge Antonio Libreros Calder6én; an expert report
by Mr. Sébastien Pouliot, and second expert reports by Mr. Rafael Romo Corzo, and, on

co-counsel in this matter.

On 2 October 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Orders No. 7 and No. 8, respectively,
on the Claimant’s request of 28 August 2019 and the Respondent’s request of 11 September
2019 to strike certain information and documents from the record. In doing so, the Tribunal
invited the Claimant to submit a revised version of its observations on the non-disputing

State Parties’ submissions, which the Claimant did on 7 October 2019.

On 4 October 2019, the Parties submitted their agreements on the draft procedural order
for the organization of the hearing. On 9 October 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural

Order No. 9 on the organization of the hearing.

On 17 October 2019, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that Mr. Fausto Garcia, the

Respondent’s damages expert called for cross-examination by the Claimant, was unable to

attend the Hearing due to a health issue and indicated that Mr. José Pedro Gonzalez Rajme,
co-author of the expert report submitted by the Respondent, was available for cross-
examination by the Claimant. In view of this, the Claimant responded on October 23, 2019
with a proposal to modify the agenda for the Hearing. On that same date, the Respondent
provided a medical report issued by Mr. Garcia’s doctor and requested an opportunity to

reply to the Claimant’s comments.

Also on 23 October 2019, the Tribunal and the Parties were informed that Ms. Marisa

Planells-Valero was resuming her functions as Secretary of the Tribunal in this proceeding.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

On 10 January 2001, Esther Calderén Birch and Jorge Pastor Garcia Mares incorporated
MotorBike under the laws of Mexico, with a duration of 5 years, a clause of exclusion of
foreigners and a share capital of MX$50,000. Ms. Calderén Birch subscribed to 95.5% of
shares and Mr. Pastor Garcia, the remaining 4.5%. The company was not constituted with
variable capital, so any modification to its share capital required a reform of its by-laws by
notarized public deed (which did not happen). Its corporate purpose was limited to the
import and export of haberdashery, sporting goods, toys, children’s accessories, fantasy
jewelry and related items; as well as the import, export and sale of food, alcoholic

beverages and condiments.”

On 30 August 2001, Claudia Nujiez-Cazares (who also indistinctly used her maiden name,

Claudia E. Guerra) established Vento Motorcycles, Inc. under Texas law.*

On 1 October 2001, Vento and MotorBike set out in the Joint Venture Agreement the terms
and conditions of their joint venture for the sale and marketing of motorcycles in Mexico

(the “Joint Venture”).*

On or around the date on which Vento and MotorBike signed the Joint Venture Agreement,
Claudia Nuifiez-Cazares and Isaac Calderén Birch verbally agreed to reinvest the Joint

Venture profits in the Joint Venture.>

On 13 October 2001, Vento and MotorBike entered into a loan agreement under which
Vento was obliged to lend to MotorBike during the term of the Joint Venture Agreement
up to a cumulative amount of US$10,000,000.00, with an annual rate of interest of 5%.
MotorBike was obligated to repay the loan upon termination of the Joint Venture (the

“First Loan Agreement”).°

Aeromechanical and Electronic Design, Inc. (“AED”) was established on 15 October 2001

under the laws of Texas. Edward Treviiio was appointed as sole director.’

In November 2001, the Joint Venture began to operate. AED began importing motorcycle
parts from China into the United States. AED then assembled engines that it subsequently
sold to Vento along with the rest of the parts that make a motorcycle. Vento completed the
assembly and exported the finished motorcycles to Mexico. AED labeled the engines as

“Made in the USA.”®

Since the beginning of 2002, concerns relating to the importation into Mexico of Vento-
branded motorcycles arose. The Mexican press reported that earlier that year the Central
Customs Control Administration had seized “Vento-branded motorcycles of Chinese

origin” for failing to pay import duties.” (Tribunal’s Translation).

On 19 February 2002, MotorBike, through Eduardo Bucay as its sole director, applied to

the Secretaria de Economia for authorization to operate under a Programa de Promocién

Sectorial (“PROSEC”), a program which would permit MotorBike to import motorcycle

parts originating in China for the assembly of motorcycles in Mexico. !°

On 28 February 2002, the Secretaria de Economia conducted a verification visit to
MotorBike’s facilities to ensure that they were suitable to operate under the Decreto por el
que se Establecen Programas de Promocién Sectorial (the “PROSEC Decree”). Eduardo
Bucay informed the Secretaria de Economia that “currently the company only sells
motorcycles and scooters, as well as spare parts and provides mechanical services to the
final customer” (Tribunal’s Translation). He stated that MotorBike had 20 employees (6
administrative staff, 11 mechanics and 3 workers) and added that at that time it did not
have the necessary equipment to assemble motorcycles. The Secretaria noted that
MotorBike did not carry out any production process or activity, and that it was in the
process of reorganizing or adapting its facilities so that it would be able to carry out
assembly processes. Eduardo Bucay committed to demonstrate MotorBike’s readiness to

perform assembly activities within one month, by 26 March 2002.!!

On 4 March 2002, the Secretaria de Economia determined that, under the PROSEC
Decree, MotorBike could not be considered a producer because it did not manufacture the

goods in question. Consequently, it denied MotorBike’s PROSEC application. !?

On 27 June 2002, the Instituto Mexicano de la Propiedad Industrial registered the Vento
trademark in favor of Isaac Calder6n Birch effective from 4 March 2002 (the filing date of

the application). '>

By mid-2002, Mexico’s Servicio de Administracién Tributaria (“SAT”) had begun an

inquiry into the origin of Vento-branded motorcycles imported into Mexico. '4

According to statements from Vento executives reported by the Mexican press, these
inquiries were motivated by claims made by the Asociacién Mexicana de la Industria
Automotriz A.C. (“AMIA”) and some Japanese motorcycle manufacturers established in

Mexico. 5

On 11 July 2002, SAT requested the US customs authorities to investigate Vento’s
constitution and legal existence. SAT addressed the request to the Customs Attaché at the
U.S. Embassy in Mexico under the Agreement between the Government of Mexico and
the United States Government on Mutual Assistance between their Customs

Administrations, dated 20 June 2000.'°

On 22 July 2002, MotorBike filed a new application for PROSEC designation, changing
the description of the activities to be performed. MotorBike stated that it would carry out

the manufacture and assembly of motorcycles, bicycles and similar goods.'7

On 24 July 2002, the Secretaria de Economia made another verification visit to
MotorBike’s facilities. Eduardo Bucay again attended the visit. The Secretaria found that
MotorBike imported “from its U.S. affiliate” various semi-assembled parts, performed an
assembly process consisting of attaching wheels, handlebars and accessories, and provided
the final finishing process. MotorBike had 45 employees (17 administrative staff, 16

mechanics and 12 workers) for such purpose.!*

On 2 August 2002, the Secretaria de Economia once more denied MotorBike’s application
for PROSEC. Again, the Secretaria determined that the company did not manufacture the

goods, so it could not be considered a producer under the PROSEC Decree. '?

On 18 November 2002, AMIA members purchased a Vento all-terrain vehicle from a

department store in Mexico. The seller explained that it was a unit assembled in Laredo,

Texas, with parts imported from Taiwan. AMIA members disassembled the all-terrain
vehicle completely to check the origin of the parts. The all-terrain vehicle had a metal plate
indicating that it had been assembled by Vento at its assembly plant in Laredo, Texas.
Some pieces indicated that they had been manufactured in Taiwan, although most of the

parts had no indication of their origin.”

According to press reports, on 19 December 2002, at the invitation of Vento, SAT officials
visited Vento’s plant in Laredo, Texas. It was an informal visit and, therefore, SAT could
not make any official findings or determinations. The Central Administrator of Customs
Control, Mario Cordova Lépez, said in an interview that they looked at Vento’s offices and
assembly lines, and were able to observe goods that were coming in. He noted that Vento’s
executives had informed him that none of the motorcycle components were manufactured
in the United States. Mr. Cordova Lopez acknowledged that motorcycles sold in a Mexican
department store at that time were of better quality than those SAT had seized earlier that
year, but that he was not convinced that the motorcycles were NAFTA originating goods.

Therefore, SAT would continue with an inquiry that it had already initiated.!

On 7 January 2003, the Customs Attaché of the United States Embassy in Mexico
responded to the SAT’s July 2002 request for information. He informed that a U.S.
Customs Service agent had visited the establishment of a company called Matrix American
Group, Inc., where César Ntifiez-Cazares identified himself as the owner of Vento. The
agent noticed that Vento had about 20 employees. César Nuifiez-Cazares stated that Vento
acquired motorcycle parts in Asia, mainly in Hong Kong; imported them into the United
States, where it paid import tariffs, and transported them to the Laredo plant where the
motorcycles were assembled in 24 hours. He added that some of the components were
manufactured in the United States, but were then exported to Asian countries, where they

were incorporated into finished products. The Customs Associate informed that, based on

the observations of the Customs Service agent who visited Vento’s plant, less than 50% of

Vento’s assembly and manufacturing was carried out at the Laredo plant.”

In the same month, SAT contacted AMIA regarding Vento motorcycle imports “to learn
first-hand their concerns regarding the alleged transshipment of Vento’s motorcycles”
through the United States. (Tribunal’s translation). AMIA informed SAT that it had
purchased a Vento motorcycle in Mexico, disassembled it and concluded that all the parts
were of Chinese origin. José Alberto Orttizar requested AMIA to file a formal written
complaint.”

In early 2003, around February, after the informal visit to Vento’s plant in Laredo, Texas,
Mr. Cordova Lépez summoned Gabriel Oliver Garcia to a meeting to discuss the
importation into Mexico of Vento motorcycles. Gabriel Oliver attended together with José
Ramon Jauregui Tejeda, Administrator of International Legal Procedures, and José Alberto
Orttizar Carcova, International Audit Manager, both attached to the Central Administration

of International Tax Audit led by Gabriel Oliver.”*

In February 2003, AMIA filed a formal written complaint against the importation into
Mexico of Vento motorcycles with a NAFTA certificate of origin, as requested by José
Alberto Orttizar Caércova. AMIA filed its complaint in accordance with the guidelines of
the Audit Programming Committee of the General Administration of Large Taxpayers of

the SAT.”°

On 1 March 2003, Vento, through Claudia E. Nuifiez-Cazares, as registered agent of the
company, filed the Public Information Report for 2002 for purposes of the Texas Franchise

Tax. The Report identifies Claudia E. Nuifiez-Cazares as president and director of Vento.

Vento submitted similar reports for 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007. The 2006 and 2007 reports

identified César Nuifiez-Cazares as the corporation’s Secretary.”°

On 7 April 2003, SAT notified Vento that it would conduct a verification visit at Vento’s
facilities in Laredo, Texas starting on 2 June 2003, in order to verify the origin of goods
exported by Vento to Mexico from 1 January to 31 December 2002, under preferential
tariff treatment with NAFTA certificates of origin issued by Vento as the producer and/or
exporter of the goods. SAT sent a copy of the notification to the US customs authority.7”

On 16 March 2003, Vento consented to the verification visit.?°

Around June 2003, at the time the SAT carried out the verification visit to Vento in Laredo,
Texas, Isaac Calderén Birch introduced his nephew, Alan Eini, to César Ntifiez-Cazares.
The three of them held a telephone conversation regarding the possibility of entering the

U.S. market with Vento motorcycles and all-terrain vehicles imported from Mexico.”

On 2 June 2003, SAT officials, including José Alberto Orttizar Carcova, Gabriel Arriaga
Callejas and Daniel Ortiz Nashiki, initiated the verification visit at Vento’s plant in Laredo,

Texas.”

The verification visit ended on 6 June 2003. Minutes of the visit were drawn up. They
recorded the documents that Vento provided to SAT’s officials, including the detailed list
of parts used in the assembly of each motorcycle model, not including the engine. Vento
stated that all the engines were NAFTA originating goods and provided a letter where
Claudia Ntiiez-Cazares, as President of AED, so certified. Luis Felipe Aguilar Rico, in
his capacity as Vento’s legal representative during the verification visit, stated that Vento

considered the motorcycles to be NAFTA originating goods in accordance with the

applicable rules of origin: de minimis rule provided for in NAFTA Article 405 for all

models with the exception of one, for which Vento had used the transaction value tule.*!

On 1 July 2003, SAT notified AED of its intention to verify the origin of the engines that
it sold to Vento and that were used in motorcycles exported to Mexico during 2002 under

NAFTA preferential tariff treatment.*?

On 24 July 2003, Vento filed an “Application by Foreign Corporation for Authorization to
Transact Business in Florida” (i.e. as a company incorporated outside Florida). It identified
Alan M. Eini as Vento’s Treasurer and Chief Operating Officer, Claudia E. Nuifiez-Cazares
as Director and President, and César Nujfiez-Cazares as Secretary. Vento attached to both
applications a certificate from the State of Texas confirming that the company was

incorporated in Texas and was in good standing at that time.**

Vento submitted annual reports as a for profit company to the State of Florida for 2004,
2005 and 2006. In its 2004 report (submitted on 5 July 2004), Claudia E. Ntifiez-Cazares,
César Nuifiez-Cazares and Alan M. Eini were identified as directors or officers of Vento.
In its 2005 report (submitted on 24 January 2005), Isaac Calder6n Birch was included as
an officer or director of the company. Vento excluded Alan M. Eini from its 2006 report

(submitted on 27 January 2006).**

On 15 August 2003, two days before the origin verification visit, AED submitted a “Prior
Disclosure for Engine Kits” to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency (“CBP”)
in which it requested to retroactively change the tariff classification of imported parts of
motorcycle engines. AED explained that since 2001 it had been importing “engine
components” from China subject to a free rate of duty and classified them as “engine kits”
under General Rule of Interpretation 2(a) of the Harmonized Commodity Description and

Coding System (“Rule 2(a)”). However, from a recent review of Customs rulings

interpreting that Rule and in accordance with the advice of outside counsel, AED had
determined that Rule 2(a) was not applicable and that the imported components were not
“engine kits” but rather “bulk components destined for an assembly operation in Laredo.”
Accordingly, it determined that it had omitted the payment of import duties and attached a
check for more than US$70,000 for the duties owed. AED sent two follow-up submissions
to CBP and, on 22 January 2004, submitted another prior disclosure statement essentially
on the same terms, to which it attached another check of more than US$40,000 for omitted

duties.*°
The verification visit to AED took place on 18 August 2003.°°

On 11 September 2003, SAT determined that the engines AED assembled and that were
incorporated into Vento motorcycles exported to Mexico during 2002 did not comply with

NAFTA tules of origin.*”

On 25 September 2003, Alan M. Eini filed on behalf of Vento an application to do business
in California. Mr. Eini identified himself as Treasurer of Vento. This application was
accompanied by a certificate from the State of Texas certifying that the company was

incorporated in Texas and was in good standing on that date.**

On 7 October 2003, AED brought an administrative appeal (recurso de revocacion) action
against SAT’s 11 September 2003 determination that its engines did not comply with
NAFTA tules of origin.”

On 21 October 2003, Savia Ltd., a company incorporated in Hong Kong, registered
“Vento” in the United States as a trademark for “motorcycles, motorbikes, scooter and

structural parts thereof.”4!

On 12 November 2003, AED requested a ruling from CBP regarding the correct tariff
classification in the U.S. of “certain engine components” it imported from China that it
specifically described as “crankshaft and spark plugs used in the production of the

motorcycle engines.” It then described its operations as follows:

AED imports engine components from [China] for use in manufacturing
operations in the United States. The imported components are packaged in
bulk —e.g., plastic bags full of very large quantities of gaskets, bolts, nuts,
seals, grommets, etc., or cardboard boxes full of dozens of pistons rings,
valves, spark plugs, bearings, etc. In their condition as imported, the
components are not put up in individual kits containing all of the
components needed to make one engine or one motorcycle. Although the
invoice contains the phrase “engine kit” immediately preceding the listing
of all the engine components, this is for purposes of identifying the engine
parts. The components listed under the phrase “engine kits” are not
packaged in individual kits and all of the components are separately listed
under the “kit” description{...].”

AED clarified that it had initially classified the components as unassembled engine kits
under Rule 2(a), but on the recommendation of its lawyers, it had submitted a prior
disclosure statement to CBP and requested reclassification. The questions that AED posed
to CBP were: (1) whether the imported components, namely crankshafts and spark plugs,
should be classified as unassembled engines under Rule 2(a); or (2) if not, how should

“crankshafts and sparkplugs [sic] for engines be classified”?*°

On 15 December 2003, CBP responded to AED’s request for a tariff classification ruling
as follows: “Based on the facts that you have made available, we find that the imported
engine components [are described as spark plugs and crankshafts for internal combustion

engines for motorcycles] are not unassembled engines within the meaning of Note 2(a) of

+1 R-0082, Vento Trademark Registration by Savia Limited Corporation from Hong Kong.

On 13 January 2004, SAT notified Vento its conclusions from the origin verification, and
of its intention to deny NAFTA preferential tariff treatment to Vento’s imports of
motorcycles into Mexico during 2002. It gave Vento a deadline to respond and defend its

rights.*>
On 12 February 2004, Vento responded to SAT. It disagreed with its conclusions.*®

On 28 January 2004, SAT provided Vento with a questionnaire to verify the origin of
motorcycles exported by Vento to Mexico from 1 January to 24 August 2003, under
preferential tariff treatment with certificates of origin issued by Vento in its capacity as

producer. SAT sent a copy of the notification to the CBP.*”

On 26 April 2004, SAT issued its decision in which it determined that the certificates of
origin issued by Vento for motorcycles imported into Mexico during 2002 were invalid
and, therefore, denied NAFTA preferential tariff treatment to those imports. SAT provided

a copy of the resolution to all importers of such motorcycles.**

On 19 May 2004, SAT sent AED a questionnaire to verify the origin of the engines that
Vento acquired from AED and incorporated into the motorcycles it exported to Mexico

during 2003.*°

On 16 August 2004, CBP responded to AED’s prior disclosures concerning imports of
motorcycle engine parts from China. It determined that the loss of revenue arising from

AED’s negligence in importing such parts free of duty between 15 January 2002 and 23

April 2003 was in excess of US$114,000. CBP imposed a penalty of US$3,677.77,
equivalent to interest on the revenue loss from the date of liquidation of the imports for
customs purposes. CBP stated that, once the charges had been paid, it would accept AED’s

prior disclosure and consider the case closed.*°

108. On 19 August 2004, Vento initiated an administrative appeal against SAT’s determination
of 26 April 2004 whereby it denied NAFTA preferential tariff treatment to motorcycles
exported during 2002. On or about the same date, AED initiated a separate administrative

appeal against the same determination.*!

109. On 7 September 2004, CBP sent a letter to José Alberto Orttizar Carcova of SAT. CBP
stated that SAT’s decision regarding the origin of motorcycles exported by Vento was in
conflict with CBP’s interpretation of the Harmonized System and a ruling that it had issued
to AED for engine components that AED imported into the United States. Therefore, based
on its ruling issued to AED and the analysis by CBP personnel, it warned that a successful

claim could be made under Article 401(b) of the NAFTA.*?

110. On 2 November 2004, CBP sent a letter to United States Senator John Cornyn in response
to an inquiry he made on Vento’s behalf regarding eligibility of Vento’s motorcycles for
preferential tariff treatment under the NAFTA. CBP informed Senator Cornyn that its
position was that imported engine components are not unassembled engines within the
meaning of Rule 2(a); however, Mexican customs authorities held an opposite view on this
point and had informed AED that its motorcycle engines incorporated into Vento branded
motorcycles could not be considered to be NAFTA originating goods. According to the
letter, the customs authorities of both countries had been discussing this issue for around

one year, apparently in the context of the Vento origin verification. CBP assured Senator

Vento closed its assembly plant in Laredo and ceased to operate by the end of 2004.>4

On 3 January 2005, Claudia E. Ntifiez-Cazares on behalf of AED, replied to the origin
questionnaire sent by SAT regarding Vento motorcycles exported to Mexico during 2003.
However, she did not provide all the information requested, which prompted a new request

by SAT on 7 February 2005 to provide the missing information.>°

On 18 April 2005, Claudia E. Nufiez-Cazares on behalf of AED, responded to SAT’s
request for additional information. AED again failed to provide the complete information

requested.*°

On 30 May 2005, SAT notified AED that its engines did not comply with the specific
NAFTA tule of origin and, therefore, determined that they were not NAFTA originating
goods. At an unspecified date, but within the legal timeframe, AED initiated an

administrative appeal against SAT’s determination.*”

On | August 2005, SAT notified Vento its conclusions from the origin verification, and of
its intention to deny NAFTA preferential tariff treatment to imports of motorcycles into

Between May 2016 and April 2017, Isaac Calderén Birch and Luis Felipe Aguilar Rico
met at least a dozen times with various SAT officials and officials of the Registro Ptiblico
Vehicular (“REPUVE”) to complain about, and provide information on, imports into
Mexico of motorcycle parts from China by members of the Mexican motorcycle industry
for purposes of assembling and commercializing motorcycles in Mexico. During that
period, Isaac Calderén Birch exchanged various communications with those officials and
provided numerous documents and information to support an allegation that Chinese
motorcycles were being smuggled into Mexico. Mexican authorities requested additional

information and proceeded to investigate the complaint.””

On 17 May 2017, having paid franchise taxes owed, Vento applied to the Texas Secretary
of State for reinstatement and setting aside of the forfeiture. Vento was subsequently

returned to good standing corporate status, although it is not clear precisely on what date.”!

THE PARTIES’ REQUESTS FOR RELIEF

(dd) Claimant’s Request for Relief

The Claimant asserts that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over this dispute and that Mexico
has breached the NAFTA by violating its obligations under NAFTA Article 1102, 1103,
1104, and 1105.

In its Reply, the Claimant requests that the Tribunal issue an award:

a. declaring that the United Mexican States has violated its obligations under
the NAFTA, by taking the measures described in its Memorial against

Claimant’s investment;

MISSIBILITY

(dd) The Parties’ Positions

a. Respondent’s Position

The Respondent explains that Vento allowed its status as a corporation in Texas to forfeit
from 28 August 2009 until 17 March 2017, when it was able to restore it following payment
of the relevant taxes. Accordingly, the Respondent submits, this arbitration proceeding was
never properly initiated as Vento did not legally exist when it submitted the Notice of Intent

to Arbitrate on 20 February 2017.4

Pursuant to the Texas Business Organizations Code, Sec. 11.001 (4), “a ‘terminated entity’
means a domestic entity the existence of which has been [...] forfeited pursuant to the Tax
Code, unless the forfeiture has been set aside.” Sec 11.356 states that a “forfeited” entity
continues in existence for three years after termination, but only for the purpose of
prosecuting or defending claims and disposing of property, and “may not continue its
existence for the purpose of continuing the business or affairs for which the terminated
entity was formed unless the terminated filing entity is reinstated.” According to the
Respondent, the Texas courts have interpreted these provisions as a requirement to ignore
the measures taken after the entity was forfeited and before its reinstatement. In any event,
pursuant to these provisions, Vento was only permitted to prosecute a claim within the
three years following its termination in 2009, and thus the Notice of Intent could not have

been filed on its behalf on 20 February 2017. °°

158.

The Respondent also notes that the Notice of Intent was submitted by Luis Felipe Aguilar
Rico on behalf of Vento. The Respondent submits that the accompanying power of
attorney issued in favor of Luis Felipe Aguilar Rico was formally deficient because it only
granted him powers to represent Vento in Mexico and was issued in 2003 by César Niifiez-

CA4zares who, at the time, was not a member of Vento’s Board of Directors.”

In addition, the Respondent claims that Vento, through Claudia Nuijiez-Cazares, did not
properly authorize Luis Felipe Aguilar Rico to file the Request for Arbitration. In
particular, the Respondent explains that, in response to ICSID’s pre-registration questions,
the Claimant incorrectly stated that Claudia Niifiez-Cazares was the sole member of
Vento’s Board of Directors and had the power to authorize the filing of the Request for
Arbitration. However, documentary evidence later revealed that César Nuifiez-Cazares

became one of Vento’s directors in 2006.””

Furthermore, the Respondent notes, the signature of “Claudia E. Guerra” from one of her
prior corporate filings on behalf of Vento with the Texas state authority did not match the
signature of “Claudia E. Guerra” in the letter that the Claimant submitted to ICSID
purporting to be Vento’s consent to ICSID’s jurisdiction and confirmation that Vento had

taken the necessary internal actions to authorize the Request for Arbitration.**

Accordingly, the Respondent concludes, Vento failed to comply with the requirements of
ICSID Additional Facility Rule 3 and, thereby, it must be seen as having failed to consent
to the arbitration “in accordance with the procedures set out in this Agreement,” as per the

text of NAFTA Article 1121(1). ”

b. Claimant’s Position

According to the Claimant, tax forfeiture did not prevent Vento from submitting a Notice

of Intent under NAFTA Chapter 11. The Claimant and its expert on Texas law, Mr. James

Lloyd Loftis, explain that, when a Texas corporation files a Notice of Intent while in
forfeiture, and is subsequently reinstated, its reinstatement retroactively validates the act
under Texas law. Furthermore, the Claimant notes that Vento never surrendered its
“corporate existence.” As a result, following reinstatement, a Texas court would consider
Vento as having been, at all relevant times, a Texas corporation, and would consider acts
taken during the period of forfeiture to be valid acts of Vento. In conclusion, the Notice of
Intent would be treated by a Texas court as having been filed by an active corporation on

20 February 2017.!°°

The Claimant also explains that, even if the power of attorney submitted together with its
Notice of Intent could be considered as somehow formally deficient as a matter of Mexican
law, such fact had no bearing on the admissibility of Claimant’s claims, since “NAFTA
Article 1119 does not require a Claimant’s counsel to attach a power of attorney document
to its Notice of Intent, much less one that meets the formalities of any one NAFTA Party’s

laws.”!0!

The Claimant explains that its declaration during the pre-registration phase that Claudia

 

Nuifiez-Cazares was the sole member of Vento’s Board of Directors at the time of the filing
of the Request for Arbitration was “an innocent mistake.”!°? According to the Claimant,
the natural consequence of a failure to satisfy any particular term of the arbitral rules it
chose under NAFTA Article 1120(1) “is not a loss of NAFTA jurisdiction but rather a
functional impediment to proceeding with the claim until such terms have been
satisfied.”!°? The Claimant concludes noting that, in accordance with Article 4 of the
ICSID Additional Facility Rules, the Secretary General of ICSID was satisfied that the
Claimant complied with the requirements of Articles 3 of the ICSID Additional Facility

Rules and registered the Request for Arbitration. !*

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Respondent has raised two admissibility questions, namely, whether the Claimant
existed under Texas law while it was in a forfeited status and could cause a Notice of Intent
be delivered to the Respondent in accordance with NAFTA Article 1119, and whether the
Request for Arbitration was properly authorized by Vento in accordance with NAFTA
Article 1121. Before addressing them, the Tribunal considers it necessary to clarify the
respective roles of the Secretary-General of ICSID and the Tribunal in the context of the

registration of an arbitration request.

Article 4 of the ICSID Additional Facility Rules requires the Secretary-General of ICSID
to be satisfied that “the request conforms in form and substance to the provisions of Article
3.” This article sets forth the content requirements of the request, including, in the case of
juridical persons, a statement that “it has taken all necessary internal actions to authorize
the request.”!°° The review of the request by the Secretary-General of ICSID for
registration purposes is not conclusive as regards the competence of the Tribunal or the
merits of the request. The Secretary-General of ICSID reminds the Parties in the notice of
registration that, as provided in Article 5(d) of the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, “the
registration of the request is without prejudice to the powers and functions of the Arbitral

Tribunal in regard to competence and the merits.”

The first admissibility objection concerns the status of Vento as a forfeited company from
28 August 2009 until 17 May 2017. Under Texas law, a forfeited entity is terminated. The
term “termination” refers to the end of corporate privileges not to the end of the company’s
existence. A forfeited company continues to exist and termination may be set aside upon
payment of the franchise tax. According to the Claimant’s expert on Texas law, Mr. Loftis,
this is explained by the revenue collection nature of the measure. During the first three
years in forfeiture, a company may file claims or defend itself against claims and dispose
of property, but “may not continue its existence for the purpose of continuing the business

or affairs for which the terminated entity was formed unless the terminated filing entity is

05 Article 3(1)(e) of the ICSID Additional Facility Rules.

reinstated.”!°°. In a legal opinion attached to the Counter-Memorial, counsel for the
Respondent disagree and argue that Vento was prohibited under Texas Law from
submitting the Notice of Intent and “whether or not Vento was later reinstated is
irrelevant.”!°’ The Respondent cites two Texas court cases that determined on appeal that
the plaintiffs were barred from pursuing their respective claims because the claims had
been filed after the three-year period following forfeiture and the claims, therefore, were
extinguished under Texas Law.'°8. However, these cases are inapposite because the present
claim is not governed by the law of Texas, but rather by the NAFTA.!”? The Respondent
has raised an objection concerning the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione temporis (which the
Tribunal will address below), but, as will be seen, it is distinct from the present question of
admissibility. Consequently, the Claimant’s evidence that the acts that the company took
during the forfeited period were retroactively ratified at the end of the forfeited status stands

unrebutted and they have been subsequently validated as well.

As a matter of fact, a Notice of Intent was delivered to the Respondent by the Claimant on
20 February 2017. It is acknowledged to have been received on that date by the
Respondent’s Subsecretaria de Comercio Exterior. Therefore, the question is not whether
the Notice of Intent existed but whether Vento had the capacity to validly deliver such

notice while in forfeited status.

The Respondent has not disputed the assertion of the Claimant that, as follow up to the
Notice of Intent, the Parties met in Mexico City in May 2017 “where both satisfied the
NAFTA Article 1115 obligation to seek a mutually acceptable resolution of the dispute
identified in it.”!!° In fact the Respondent does not contend that Vento ceased to exist. The
Respondent’s counsel, Stephan E. Becker, concluded that “[u]nder Texas law, Vento is not

allowed to pursue its claim, and it was legally barred from engaging in business while its

charter was forfeited from 2009 to 2017,” but he does not question that Vento continued to

exist as a corporation. !!!

Indeed, the Respondent admits that Vento continued to exist,
although “only in theory, as a non-operative ghost company that was barred from doing

business.”!!? (Tribunal’s translation).

Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent has failed to prove that Vento
lacked the capacity to deliver its Notice of Intent to the Respondent in accordance with

NAFTA Article 1119.

The second admissibility question concerns whether the Request for Arbitration was
properly authorized by Vento and met the requirement of consenting to arbitration under
NAFTA Article 1121. The Respondent bases its objection on three grounds (i) Claudia
Nuifiez-Cazares did not sign herself the Request for Arbitration, (ii) she was not the sole
director of the Board of Directors of Vento as affirmed by counsel for the Claimant to the
Secretary-General of ICSID in the process of registration of the Request for Arbitration,
and (iii) there is no evidence that Luis Felipe Aguilar Rico was authorized to submit the

Request for Arbitration in the name of Vento.

As explained in detail below,!!° Claudia Nujiez-C4zares retained ownership and control of

Vento at all relevant times and was authorized to act on behalf of Vento.

The issue of the signature of Claudia Nufiez-Cazares in the letter accompanying the
Request for Arbitration arises because it is significantly different from the signature of

Claudia Nuifiez-Cazares at the time of incorporation of Vento 16 years earlier. The Tribunal

agrees with the Respondent that one does not need to be an expert in graphology to see
how different the two signatures are. But Claudia Nuiiez-Cazares has participated in this
proceeding from the beginning and she had ample opportunity to protest the use of her
name. She has not denied that she authorized filing the Request for Arbitration and there
is no question that she consented to submit the claim to arbitration on behalf of Vento. The
representation of Vento by Luis Felipe Aguilar Rico can be answered similarly. He has
been counsel to Vento throughout this proceeding. If there was a procedural defect it has
been cured by the fact that Claudia Ntifiez-Cazares, as sole shareholder and President of
Vento, has not informed this Tribunal that Luis Felipe Aguilar Rico does not properly

represent Vento.

Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the Request for Arbitration was properly
authorized by Vento and met the requirements of NAFTA Article 1121. The Tribunal,

therefore, rejects the Respondent’s second admissibility objection.

172. The term “enterprise” is defined by NAFTA Article 1139, which refers back to NAFTA
Article 201 that contains the definition applicable to the whole of the NAFTA as follows:

Article 1139: Definitions
For purposes of this Chapter:
[..]

enterprise means an “enterprise” as defined in Article 201 (Definitions of
General Application), and a branch of an enterprise [...].

Article 201: Definitions of General Application
Led

enterprise means any entity constituted or organized under applicable law,
whether or not for profit, and whether privately-owned or governmentally-

175.

owned, including any corporation, trust, partnership, sole proprietorship,

joint venture or other association [...].
Vento’s Joint Venture with MotorBike (and subsequently with Mototransp) for purposes
of commercializing in Mexico motorcycles assembled in Laredo, Texas, was the principal
investment that the Claimant identified. The Claimant also identified the following types

of investments:

a. an interest in an enterprise that entitles the owner to share in income or
profits of the enterprise because it was entitled to receive under the Joint
Venture Agreement 90% of the income from the sales of, and service to,

motorcycles in Mexico; 7

b. tangible and intangible property used for the purpose of economic activity
in Mexico in the form of approximately 10,000 motorcycles exported to

Mexico and the reinvestment of the Joint Venture’s profits;!!*

c. interests arising from the commitment of capital or other resources in

Mexico under the Joint Venture Agreement; and
d. two loans to MotorBike.'!

The investments referred to in subparagraphs (a)-(c) above are part of the Joint Venture.
The Claimant has not raised independent claims and it did not specify the loss or damage
incurred by reason of, or arising out of, the alleged breaches of the NAFTA in relation to

such purported investments. Therefore, the Tribunal will not treat them separately.

The Claimant also considered that the loans, in addition to being covered under
subparagraph (d) of the definition of “investment” in NAFTA Article 1139, are also
“property” in the form of capital contributions and, thus, covered under subparagraph (g)
as well. The Tribunal notes that the Claimant did not raise independent claims or specify

the loss or damage incurred with respect of either the loans as such under subparagraph (d)

or as property under subparagraph (g). Notably, the Claimant’s expert on quantum did not
make any reference to the loans in either of its reports. The Tribunal will not treat them

separately either.

(dd) The Joint Venture Agreement

a. The Parties’ Positions
(i) Respondent’s Position

The Respondent argues that Vento did not make an investment as that term is defined in
NAFTA Article 1139. Therefore, it is not an investor of a Party and consequently it lacks
standing to bring a claim under Section B of NAFTA Chapter 11. Thus, it argues, the

Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear Vento’s claims. !2°

There is no dispute between the Parties that Vento and MotorBike entered into the Joint
Venture Agreement. However, the Respondent contends that the Joint Venture Agreement
did not create an entity. Rather, it argues, it is “simply an informal joint venture,” merely
a “commercial contract” for the sale by MotorBike of motorcycles in Mexico and, as such,
it is expressly excluded from the definition of investment in NAFTA Article 1139 (i).!?!

(Tribunal’s translation).

According to the Respondent, the term “enterprise,” as defined in NAFTA Article 201,
must result in the creation of an entity. In its Rejoinder, the Respondent equated “entity”
with “juridical person.” In its view, therefore, an enterprise, as defined in NAFTA Article

201, must be a distinct legal person. !??

Hence, a joint venture — or, for that matter, any of
the other items included in that definition — that does not “involve the constitution or
creation of an entity” that is a juridical person, is neither an enterprise nor, for that reason,

an investment under NAFTA Article 1139(a).!?3 (Tribunal’s translation).

(ii) Claimant’s Position

According to the Claimant, the Respondent’s position is unsupported by the text of the
NAFTA Article 201 definition of “enterprise,” which includes entities that “are not
generally considered to be legal persons” such as trusts and partnerships, in addition to
joint ventures.'™* It argues that the treaty context does not support the Respondent’s
interpretation either. For instance, NAFTA Article 1117 specifically makes this
distinction. It provides that an investor of a party may submit to arbitration under Section
B a claim “on behalf of an enterprise of another Party that is a juridical person that the
investor owns or controls directly or indirectly [...].”!*> Thus, “‘entity’ must necessarily

mean something other than a ‘legal person.’”!7°

The Claimant also offered the evidence of its legal expert, Gerardo Lozano Alarcén, who
distinguished between reciprocal and associative contracts under Mexican law. He noted
that, while “the parties to a reciprocal contract, such as an ordinary contract for the sale of
goods, always remain essentially in apposition to each other, in the case of an associative
contract — such as a joint venture agreement — the parties’ interests converge in their
pursuit of a shared objective (here: the establishment and operation of a business enterprise
that markets, distributes, sells, and services small displacement motorcycles in

Mexico).”!?”

The Joint Venture was entered into pursuant to the laws of Mexico. Its purpose was to
“promote, sell and in general commercialize small displacement motorcycles in

Mexico.”!8 Thus, it was an investment in the territory of Mexico.

b. The Tribunal’s Analysis

182. As the Claimant correctly points out, Mexico’s position that an “enterprise,” as defined by
NAFTA Article 201, must be a legal person is unsupported by the plain text of that article.
The definition is quite broad: “enterprise means any entity [...]” provided that it is
“constituted or organized under applicable law.” In both English and Spanish “entity” is
as broad a term as can be used to refer to something that exists.'?” The Respondent focused
on narrower meanings of the word in support of its proposition that an enterprise must be
a legal person. However, similar to the approach taken by NAFTA Article 201, even the
definitions cited by the Respondent include different types of associations, some of which
would be legal persons (e.g. sociedades mercantiles or corporations) and others would not.
Indeed, in addition to qualifying “entity” with the indefinite adjective “any” and using the
phrase “constituted or organized,” which is obviously meant to widen the scope of the
definition, of the five concrete examples of enterprises contained in the definition of
“enterprise” in NAFTA Article 201, only one —corporation— would clearly be a distinct
legal person. As indicated by the Claimant, trusts and partnerships are not generally

considered to be legal persons and neither are sole proprietorships. !*°

183. The principle of effectiveness —ut res magis valeat quam pereat— also precludes the
Respondent’s narrow interpretation. Both Parties’ experts agree that a joint venture may or
may not result in the creation of a legal person. The distinction that Respondent’s legal
expert, Rafael Romo Corzo, draws between “informal” and “corporate” joint ventures does
not assist the Respondent because it does not inform in any way the scope of the definition
in question. In fact, it highlights the opposite view. If the Respondent were correct that

only “corporate” joint ventures are covered by the definition of “enterprise” in NAFTA

185.

Article 201, the inclusion of “joint venture” would be redundant because it would already

be covered by the term “corporation.”

Similarly, the Respondent’s reference to the use of the word “enterprise” in the definition
of “investment” in NAFTA Article 1139 is equally unhelpful to its position because it does
not inform the content of that term. While not directly relevant to the scope of the
definition, it does provide some context in the sense that, in addition to “real estate” and
“interests arising from the commitment of capital or other resources” to which the
Respondent refers, “investment” covers agreements, instruments, interests and property
that do not create a legal person (e.g. securities, loans, tangible and intangible property,

and interests of different types).

The Respondent also argues that the Joint Venture was nothing more than a commercial
contract for the sale of goods, namely motorcycles, in Mexico and, as such, it is expressly
excluded from the definition of “investment.”!?! However, the evidence demonstrates and
the Tribunal finds that the Joint Venture was much more than that. It involved joint efforts,
cooperation and the commitment of resources, skills and know-how by both contracting
parties (Vento and MotorBike) to the development of an economic activity in Mexico.
Indeed, even if not everything that the contracting parties committed to contribute to the
venture materialized (the Tribunal will return to the loans), Vento contributed resources in
the form of capital, facilities for the assembly of motorcycles as well as finished
motorcycles and motorcycle parts (for service and repairs); its skills and know-how in the
motorcycle assembly business and the exportation of goods; services, including client
development and administrative services (e.g. accounting); and the nexus with AED which
made possible the importation of parts from China for assembly of motorcycles in the
United States. Motorbike contributed resources in the form of facilities in Mexico for
storage and workshops; its client and distribution networks; skills and know-how of the
motorcycle market in Mexico; services, including distribution, marketing and repair
services; and the nexus with Mr. Calderé6n, who owned the Vento trademark. Both

cooperated throughout the life of the venture and contributed time and efforts to develop a

5! Counter-Memorial, {ff 213-218.

46

business and achieve its goals (even if they did not ultimately succeed). The Joint Venture
parties agreed to share in the profits, as opposed to engaging in transactions involving the

exchange of goods for money.

186. Thus, the Tribunal finds that the Joint Venture is an enterprise and, therefore, an investment
in accordance with NAFTA Chapter 11. Consequently, the Tribunal rejects Mexico’s

objection.

(2) Loans

187. The Joint Venture Agreement provides:

ARTICLE 6
CONDITION PRECEDENT FOR CLOSING
6.1 Upon the execution of this Agreement, Vento and Motorbike will enter
into a loan agreement, by means of which Vento will grant a loan in favor
of Motorbike, for a total amount up to US$10,000,000.00 (Ten million
dollars 00/100 Currency of the United States of America) (the “Loan
Agreement”). !3?

188. Pursuant to that provision, Vento and Motorbike entered into the First Loan Agreement on
13 October 2001. Vento agreed to “make loans to the Borrower [MotorBike] from time to
time during the term of this Agreement in an aggregate principle amount of
US10,000,000.00.”'*? The First Loan Agreement did not specify the term but set the
maturity date when MotorBike agreed to repay the borrowings “at the date of termination

of the JV Agreement.” !*4

189. On 1 March 2010, Vento and MotorBike entered into the Second Loan Agreement whereby
MotorBike could borrow up to US$3,200,000 during the following 6 months. MotorBike
agreed to repay the loan no later than the date when “the fiscal authorities, as well as the

courts and other relevant authorities” had resolved the “dispute concerning the certificate

of origin.” > The Second Loan Agreement is far from clear on such date, but presumably
it would be no later than when final decisions of the Mexican courts concerning SAT’s
determinations on the origin of Vento motorcycles imported in 2002 and 2003 became res

judicata. The last of such decisions was issued in May 2016.'°°

a. The Parties’ Positions
(i) Respondent’s Position

The Respondent denies that Vento made any loans to MotorBike and argues that the
Claimant did not submit any evidence that it did. According to Vento’s tax records, the
reported sales and cost of sales show that Vento was reimbursed “almost completely for
the motorcycles it exported to Mexico.”'37_ (Tribunal’s translation). It argues that “pro
forma invoices” are not the actual sales invoices and, in any event, they reveal numerous
inconsistencies with the Claimant’s argument, including MotorBike being invoiced
directly by Chinese suppliers of motorcycle parts delivered to Vento in Laredo; imports by
MotorBike of motorcycle parts directly from China; imports by MotorBike of fully
assembled motorcycles directly from China; imports of other types of goods such as
electric scooters and gasoline skateboards; and “paid” invoices for zero quantity of goods
and zero amount due.'** The Respondent also notes that, in response to the Tribunal’s order
that Vento produce documents related to the loan, the Claimant stated that “no documents

exist that could be responsive to Respondent’s request.” !*

With regard to the US$3.2 million loan, the Respondent noted that the deposits recorded
in the bank statements that the Claimant submitted as proof that it had transferred the

money to MotorBike do not show who transferred the money to MotorBike and, although

it requested from the Claimant documents that identified the source of such transfers, the

Claimant responded that it had found no such documents. !4°

(ii) Claimant’s Position

In its Memorial, the Claimant argued that Vento had “extended two loans to MotorBike,

the first in 2001, for US$10 million, and the second in 2010, for US$3.2 million.” !4!

The Claimant subsequently characterized the US$10 million loan as a “revolving credit
facility” or a “line of credit” and contends that, instead of advancing MotorBike sums of
money, as provided for in the First Loan Agreement and the Joint Venture Agreement,
Vento supplied it with motorcycles: “Vento’s contribution to the business of the JV
enterprise —its investment— consisted in Vento’s extension of a US$10 million credit
facility to MotorBike, the execution of which both JV partners knew would take the form
of advancements of inventory to MotorBike.”'“? The Claimant asserts that it provided the
Respondent with copies of importation records and matching “pro forma invoices” as proof
of “MotorBike’s everyday utilization of this credit facility” and that “[i]nstead of making
payment on each invoice within the 30-day period stipulated thereon, between June 2002
and July 2003 MotorBike exhausted $7.8 million of the $10 million available to it” but
“MotorBike never paid for approximately $1.8 million worth of inventory advance under
the facility,” which “has been recorded as a long-term debt obligation (to Vento) on

MotorBike’s books.”!3

The Claimant also argued that between March and July 2010, it transferred US$3.2 million
to MotorBike pursuant to the Second Loan Agreement, as shown in MotorBike’s bank
statements. '“* The Claimant added that that loan had an indefinite maturity date, it imposed

no interest and it is still outstanding. !45

b. The Tribunal’s Analysis

Vento and MotorBike entered into two loan agreements: one in 2001 '#° and another one in

2010.'47 The existence of the Loan Agreements is not in dispute.

A loan to an enterprise where the original maturity is at least three years is an investment
under NAFTA Article 1139. The original maturity stipulated in the First Loan Agreement
was five years: as noted, MotorBike agreed to repay the borrowings at the termination of
the Joint Venture Agreement, which was originally entered into for a five-year term. The
maturity of the Second Loan Agreement was contingent on the finality of domestic
administrative and judicial decisions involving the origin verifications of the goods that
Vento exported to Mexico in 2001 and 2002. There is no dispute either that such
proceedings concluded in 2016 with final decisions of the Mexican courts in 2015 and

2016, respectively. !48

The Loan Agreements, however, are not sufficient proof of an “investment.” The
Respondent denies that Vento actually loaned any money to MotorBike under the Loan

Agreements.

Despite the Claimant’s post hoc re-characterization of the first loan as a “credit facility”
involving inventory rather than money, the Tribunal finds that it was not. It is simply not
supported by the First Loan Agreement, and Patricia Ortega’s testimony, a MotorBike

employee since 2002,'”°

is contradicted by the Claimant’s original argument that the
10,000 motorcycles that it contributed to the Joint Venture are an investment in the form
of “tangible property [...] used for the purpose of economic activity in [the] territory [...]
[of Mexico].”!°° The motorcycles were to be sold by MotorBike in Mexico (and indeed

they were sold), while the US$10 million loan “was destined to fund the business

operations of the joint venture.”'>! Patricia Ortega’s testimony is also contradicted by that
of Claudia and César Nuifiez-Cazares. At the Hearing, Claudia Ntifiez-~Cazares confirmed
that “another essential element [of the Joint Venture Agreement] is that we [i.e. Vento]
would contribute with 10,000 motorcycles in a period of two years and up to $10 million
dollars.”'*? César Nuiiez-Cazares’s testimony is consistent with hers.!°? Claudia Nuijiez-
Cazares testified that “Vento never actually sent money to MotorBike or received interest
payments” from MotorBike.'** According to César Nuifiez-Cazares, the business grew
quickly and “became self-sufficient in a very fast manner.” > The Joint Venture partners’
initial estimate of 10,000 motorcycles in two years was quickly surpassed. By the end of
2003 the Joint Venture had sold 38,000 motorcycles “and what happened,” testified
Claudia Ntjiez-Cézares at the hearing, “is that we never really had to pay $10 million
dollars [...]. So, it was not necessary to send money because we generated that money by

the selling of the motorcycles.”!°°

The Claimant did not demonstrate that it transferred any funds to MotorBike under the
Second Loan Agreement either. As noted by the Respondent, MotorBike’s banking
records do not show who made the payments that were highlighted!>’ and the Claimant did
not provide any documents of its own. In its response to the Respondent’s document
request, the Claimant declared that it had no responsive documents other than MotorBike’s
banking records exhibited as evidence of the second loan.!°8 It surmised that “[t]o the
extent that such documents did once exist, it would appear that they were destroyed well

before the commencement of the arbitration.” °°

Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant did not make an investment in the form

of loans under NAFTA Chapter 11. It is therefore unnecessary to say more in respect of

the Claimant’s failure to have raised a claim in connection with the loans under NAFTA

Article 1116.

B. Jurisdiction Ratione Personae

NAFTA Article 1116(1) provides in pertinent part: “An investor of a Party may submit to
arbitration under this Section a claim that another Party has breached an obligation under:
(a) Section A [of Chapter 11] [...] and that the investor has incurred loss or damage by
reason of, or arising out of, that breach.” Vento has submitted a claim to arbitration under
that article. Initially, it also sought to bring claims under NAFTA Article 1117 on behalf

of MotorBike and Mototransp but subsequently withdrew those claims.!

(dd) The Parties’ Positions

a. Respondent’s Position

The Respondent has presented two objections. First, it argued that Isaac Calder6én Birch

161

financed Vento and is its “legitimate owner, either directly or through what it called “el

Grupo Calderén,” an indeterminate group of persons including Isaac Calderén Birch

himself, César Nuifiez-~Cazares and others. !?

The Respondent asserts that “the claim is Mr.
Calderén’s who, as a Mexican citizen, lacks standing” to submit it to arbitration under the

NAFTA. !® (Tribunal’s translation).

The Respondent also asserted that Vento forfeited its corporate status in August 2009 and
ceased to operate, at which time “the ownership and control over Vento had clearly shifted
to Mexico and Vento was no longer a United States citizen” (sic).' It added that “at least
since 2009 Vento has existed only theoretically and its Mexican owners reactivated it in

2017 only as a vehicle to submit this claim” to arbitration. '°> The Respondent argues that

the continuous nationality rule under customary international law requires that the claim
must continuously belong to an investor of a NAFTA Party other than Mexico but, since
“[Vento] is controlled by [Mexican] nationals and it does not have substantial business
activities in [Texas], and the seat of management and the financial control of the
corporation are both located in [Mexico] [...] the claimant’s nationality must be deemed to

be Mexican.”!® (Tribunal’s translation; brackets in original).

b. Claimant’s Position

The Claimant contends that Vento was incorporated by Claudia Nufiez-Cazares in August
2001 under the laws of Texas.'©” She was appointed as the sole director of the company
and subsequently identified as the company’s President in several corporate filings.'°
César Ntifiez-Cézares also became a director in 2006.'° Vento was at all times controlled

by Claudia Ntifiez-Cazares and her husband, César Niifiez-Cazares.'”°

Vento entered into the Joint Venture Agreement with MotorBike. Vento at all times legally
controlled the business operations of the Joint Venture under the Joint Venture Agreement
and it also exercised de facto control over the day-to-day operations.'”! The Claimant
denies that Isaac Calder6én owned or controlled Vento, AED or the Joint Venture and denies

the existence of the so-called Grupo Calderén.'”*

With respect to the continuous nationality rule, the Claimant argues that the Respondent
has confused Vento, a company constituted and organized under the laws of Texas, with
the Joint Venture, which is an enterprise constituted and organized under applicable
Mexican laws. The Claimant does not deny that it “endured a period of tax forfeiture in

Texas” that precluded it from performing “certain corporate functions” (although it

suggests that such corporate incapacity was limited to Texas). However, it denies that
ownership or control of Vento was transferred to Mexican entities or that Vento ceased to

exist. Therefore, Vento never had a nationality problem.'”

The Claimant also disputes that the continuous nationality rule applies at all. It argues that
it is contrary to the text of NAFTA Articles 1116 and 1117 because it would introduce “a
new restriction ratione personae on the rights of NAFTA investors [sic] to seek redress
under Chapter 11, Part B.”!”* In any event, it contends that the relevant date was 7 August
2017 when it submitted its Request for Arbitration “on which date it [Vento] was a U.S.
national, in good standing and full compliance with all of its obligations under Texas

law.?!75

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Respondent’s objections are contradictory and somewhat confusing. If Isaac Calderén
Birch owned and controlled Vento and this NAFTA Chapter 11 claim, then there was no
change of “nationality.” But if the claim changed from the hands of a US national to the
hands of a Mexican national, then Isaac Calder6n Birch was not initially the “owner” of
the claim or the one who owned or controlled Vento. One cannot prove one without
disproving the other. The Respondent has not really stated on which theory it stands and
what role —if any— the other theory would play. It would appear that it put forward
several arguments in the hope that one would stick, rather than presenting a more

considered view.

a. Ownership and Control of Vento

In its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent argued rather vaguely that Isaac Calder6n Birch
was the “legitimate owner” of Vento either directly or through a so-called Grupo

Calderén.'”° The Claimant vehemently denied it.

The Respondent later abandoned the Grupo Calderén argument. There was no further
discussion about it in the Respondent’s Rejoinder or its arguments at the Hearing. Beyond
a vague reference to an indeterminate group of people that included Isaac Calderén, César

Niifiez-Cazares, Alan Eini “y otros,”!7”

the Respondent did not provide any evidence of
who comprised it, how it operated or how it influenced Vento’s decisions regarding the

operation of the Joint Venture. The Tribunal finds that there was no such group.

The Respondent did not offer any evidence either that Isaac Calder6n owned Vento. There
is no dispute that Vento was incorporated by Claudia Ntifiez-Cazares.'"* There is no
evidence that she transferred the ownership of her stake in Vento or that, subsequent to
Vento’s incorporation, Isaac Calderén Birch or others acquired an ownership interest in the
company. At the Hearing, Claudia Ntiiez-Cazares confirmed she is still the owner of

179

Vento’ and the Tribunal so finds.

The Respondent’s arguments relate more to control over Vento at certain points in time.
Claudia Nuiiez-Cazares was appointed the sole director of Vento in 2001 upon
incorporation.'®° Corporate filings in Texas where Vento was incorporated and had its
place of business show that she remained Vento’s President up until 2008, the year before
Vento forfeited its corporate status and ceased further filings. In 2017, Claudia Nuiiez-

Cazares, again identified as Vento’s President, sought and obtained reinstatement of the

company and later filed the Public Information Report for that year. César Nuifiez-Cazares

was Vento’s Secretary during the same period.!*!

A few corporate filings in Florida and California register Alan Eini as an officer or director
(operations manager or treasurer) of Vento. However, those filed in Florida identify
Claudia Nijfiez-Cazares as “DP,” i.e. Director and President of Vento. Some of those
filings also identify Isaac Calder6n Birch as President of Vento.'*? Vento offered a rather
implausible story of how that came about (supported by witness statements of Isaac
Calderén Birch and Alan Eini). Nonetheless, it is of no consequence because the filings
also identify Claudia Nuifiez-Cazares as Director and President of Vento, except for the two
whereby Vento surrendered its right to do business in California and Florida,
respectively.'** Yet, these two notices of withdrawal from business hardly contradict

evidence that show that Claudia Nuifiez-Cazares remained in control of Vento throughout.

The testimony of Claudia and César Ntiiez-Cazares is consistent in that respect. They
were the ones who leased the facilities where the assembly plant was located, they hired
the workers, kept Vento’s accounting records, retained external consultants and, overall,

managed the day-to-day operations of Vento.

b. Nationality

of its inventory.'*> It completely ceased operations sometime in 2007 or 2008 and forfeited
its corporate status in 2009.'*° Other than its attempts to expand its business in California

US$3.2 million Second Loan Agreement with MotorBike in 2010, it appears that from
around 2007 on Vento focused almost exclusively on defending its NAFTA origin claim

in Mexico.

It is not at all clear if, in raising the continuous nationality rule objection, the Respondent
was referring to Vento, Vento’s owner, the investment or the claim. There is no dispute
that Vento forfeited its corporate status, although the Parties disagree on the effects that
such forfeiture had both in respect of what it could or could not do during the period of
forfeiture in Texas and, more broadly, in the United States and elsewhere, and in respect

188

of the present NAFTA Chapter 11 claim.'*” As explained above, '** the Claimant’s expert

on Texas law testified that “the forfeiture of its charter does not affect the existence of the

”189 and the Respondent did not contend that Vento ceased to exist.! In fact,

corporation’
Vento did not conduct any business after 2009.'°! To the extent that motorcycles with the
Vento brand were sold in Mexico after Vento ceased to operate in the United States, that
business was carried out by others and it was not subject to the Joint Venture Agreement. !*”
In fact, Vento filed its last tax return in the United States in 2007 or 2008.'9? As already
found by the Tribunal, after 2007 Vento focused on defending its origin claim in Mexico

and its ability to do so has not been questioned. !*

The Respondent argued that, at the time it forfeited its corporate status, somehow “the
ownership and control over Vento had clearly shifted to Mexico and Vento was no longer
a United States citizen” (sic). It offered no explanation or evidence as to how Vento lost
its U.S. nationality or acquired Mexican nationality, either de jure or de facto such that

essentially remained “non-operative” from mid-2009 onward.!°° Mexico did not provide
any explanation or evidence as to how control and ownership of Vento shifted to Mexico

and to whom. (Tribunal’s translation).

The Tribunal finds that Vento is a corporation constituted and organized under the laws of
the United States. It is a national of the United States for purposes of the NAFTA and has
remained so at all relevant times. Claudia Nufiez-Cazares, a U.S. national, retained
ownership and control of Vento at all relevant times. Therefore, the Tribunal rejects

Mexico’s objections.

c. Ownership and Control of the Investment

The Tribunal is satisfied that Vento controlled the investment, that is, the Joint Venture.

Because the Respondent argued that a contractual joint venture is not an enterprise in
accordance with NAFTA Article 201 and, therefore, it is not an investment for purposes of
NAFTA Chapter 11, the Respondent focused its arguments on Vento’s ownership or
control of MotorBike and Mototransp. Yet, the relevant question is whether Vento owned
or controlled the Joint Venture. The Respondent’s arguments, therefore, are mostly
inapposite and failed to refute the Claimant’s claim that it exercised control over the

investment.

Control is not limited to “corporate control” as exercised through voting rights. The

Tribunal agrees with the notion of control as formulated by the Thunderbird tribunal:

It is quite common in the international corporate world to control a business
activity without owning the majority voting rights in shareholders meetings.
Control can also be achieved by the power to effectively decide and
implement the key decisions of the business activity of an enterprise and,
under certain circumstances, control can be achieved by the existence of one
or more factors such as technology, access to supplies, access to markets,
access to capital, know how, and authoritative reputation. Ownership and
legal control may assure that the owner or legally controlling party has the
ultimate right to determine key decisions. However, if in practice a person
exercises that position with an expectation to receive an economic return

for its efforts and eventually be held responsible for improper decisions, one

can conceive the existence of a genuine link yielding the control of the

enterprise to that person. !°”
Under the Joint Venture Agreement and according to the witness statements of Claudia and
César Nuiiez-Cazares and Isaac Calder6n Birch, which are all consistent on this point, there
is no doubt that Vento exercised control over the Joint Venture and its business activities. °°
The whole purpose of the Joint Venture was to commercialize in Mexico motorcycles
assembled by Vento in the United States.'°? Thus, MotorBike’s participation in the Joint
Venture operations —and indeed, the Joint Venture as a whole— depended on Vento
assembling motorcycles and exporting them to Mexico. While the Joint Venture
Agreement established the initial contribution of 10,000 motorcycles in the first two years
of operation and provided that both contracting parties would thereafter define the number
of additional units and models to be contributed, it is clear that Vento controlled production
which, in turn, was the sole source of supply of the Joint Venture operations in Mexico.
Vento was responsible for procurement of motorcycle parts and components (including
engines). It was the owner of the assembly facilities, it hired and trained the workforce, it
controlled the plant’s processes and quality of the motorcycles. Vento was also responsible
under the Joint Venture Agreement for making capital contributions. As it turns out, the
Joint Venture quickly became self-supporting and there was no need for Vento to make
additional capital contributions, including through loans, but that does not detract from the
notion of control of the Joint Venture and its business activities. Under the Joint Venture
Agreement, Vento was to receive 90% of the profits which, evidently, gave it greater

weight in the decision-making process of the Joint Venture and its business activities.?°°

Vento did not own or control MotorBike or Mototransp. At the Hearing, Isaac Calderén

Birch testified without any hesitation that, regardless of who MotorBike’s shareholders of

record were, undoubtedly MotorBike was his company and he was the person managing
MotorBike; he incorporated both companies and all of their corporate records were in his
custody.?°! The Tribunal finds that this was the case for both MotorBike and Mototransp.
The Joint Venture Agreement did impose certain corporate limitations on MotorBike (and
on Mototransp after the assignment) but that is further proof that Vento controlled the Joint
Venture, not that Isaac Calderén Birch transferred control of his companies to Vento. The
Joint Venture Agreement provided that “Each Party is an independent entity and [...]
[nJothing contained herein [i.e. the Joint Venture Agreement] shall be construed to create

[...] [any] relationship other than that of independent Parties.”7°

The Tribunal therefore finds that Vento controlled the investment and rejects the

Respondent’s objection ratione personae.

Jurisdiction Ratione Temporis

The Claimant admits that “the losses suffered by the Claimant and its investment
enterprises began accruing in 2003.” However, it argues that “Vento would lack the
information necessary to attribute those losses to Mexico’s breaches of the NAFTA until
May 2016 for Articles 1102 and 1103 and May 2017 for Article 1105.” 7° The Respondent
contends that the claim has lapsed because more than three years have elapsed from the
date on which the investor first acquired knowledge, or should have first acquired

knowledge, of the alleged breach and that the investor incurred loss or damage.7™*

The principal facts of this dispute are inextricably linked to the merits and to the
Respondent’s objection. There is no effective way for the Tribunal to cleanly separate the
facts as they relate to the merits or to this jurisdictional objection in order to ascertain when

the Claimant first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach

Tribunal has decided to consider them together.

(dd) The Parties’ Positions

a. Claimant’s Position

The Claimant initially argued:

The Vento-MotorBike joint venture sourced its products from the Vento
manufacturing facility in Laredo, Texas. After the SAT decisions of 2003
and 2004 rendered this approach uneconomical, the joint venture continued
the business of Vento’s investment in Mexico using motorcycles sourced
directly from China. It was a stop-gap measure, adopted while Vento’s court
challenges to the SAT decisions were under consideration. It was only
because Vento’s challenges took far too long — twelve years — to resolve,
that this temporary solution became semi-permanent. That is why, as soon
as the first of two courts ruled, in May 2015, Vento and Mototransp started
looking for a new way to do business.”

The Claimant asserts that nine Mexican companies were “engaged in the marketing,
distribution, sales, and servicing of small displacement motorcycles in the territory of
Mexico at the same time as either the Vento-MotorBike or the Vento-Mototransp joint
venture.”?°° Six of those companies “were engaged in the importation of disassembled
motorcycles, as components, and thereby evading the higher duties they should have been
paying if SAT’s construction of LIGIE Rule 2(a) had been evenly applied.””°’ Two of the

latter are owned by nationals of Japan.?°

The Claimant contended disparate treatment in respect of:

a. the importation into Mexico of disassembled motorcycles and failure to

apply Rule 2(a), which would have resulted in a 30% import duty; and

b. allowing certain Mexican companies to label their motorcycles as “Made in
Mexico” and to use corresponding vehicle identification numbers, while
Vento branded motorcycles were required to be labelled as “Made in

China,” which placed them at a “reputational” disadvantage.”

The Claimant argued as well that in 2016 it brought to the attention of Mexican officials at
SAT, the Secretaria de Economia and the REPUVE the failure to enforce Rule 2(a) on
goods imported by its Mexican competitors but they did not take any action until after it
served its Request for Arbitration in this proceeding on Mexico. It asserts that some origin
verifications were initiated then but no action was taken regarding the use of the “Made in
Mexico” mark. In any event, it argues that the belated actions cannot redress the Joint

Venture’s losses, which it claims go back to 2002.7!°

Following the Respondent’s defense that all of the Claimant’s so-called comparators were
PROSEC holders, the Claimant raised an alternative claim that Mexico failed to accord
Vento and the Joint Venture treatment no less favorable than that accorded to Mexican (and
foreign-owned Mexican) PROSEC holders because it denied MotorBike’s application for
PROSEC twice in 2002.7!!

b. Respondent’s Position

The Respondent denies that Vento or the Joint Venture were in similar circumstances to
Vento’s so-called comparators. The Respondent contends that circumstances were
different in a number of important respects. AED imported motorcycle parts into the
United States, assembled the engines and then sold those engines as NAFTA originating
goods and the rest of the parts to Vento. Vento then assembled the motorcycles and

exported them to Mexico as NAFTA goods. MotorBike principally but also others, such

234.

as large department stores, imported those goods paying no duties under NAFTA
preferential tariff treatment. In contrast, Vento’s so-called comparators were all located in
Mexico. They imported motorcycle parts directly from China or India into Mexico,
assembled motorcycles and sold them directly in the Mexican market. The Respondent’s
main argument, however, is that all such comparators were beneficiaries of PROSEC, a
duty exemption program that among its benefits exempted program participants from the
application of Rule 2(a). Vento and the imports under the Joint Venture Agreement were
subject to an entirely different legal regime than the one that applied to Vento’s so-called

2
comparators. 212

The Respondent asserts that the Claimant confused the regulations that apply to the “Hecho
en México” trademark and vehicle identification numbers (which include a code that
identifies the country of origin of the vehicles) and the rules that govern preferential tariff
treatment under the NAFTA, including Rule 2(a). The Respondent explained in detail how

those rules operate.?!>

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

a. Scope of the Investment

The Claimant contends that Vento and the Vento-MotorBike and Vento-Mototransp Joint
Ventures have been accorded treatment less favorable than that accorded to its so-called

comparators, but it has failed to distinguish clearly between treatment accorded to:
a. Vento as an investor of another Party;

b. Vento, MotorBike or Mototransp in respect of activities that they carried

out pursuant to the Joint Venture Agreement; and

c. Vento, MotorBike or Mototransp in respect of activities that they carried

beyond the terms of the Joint Venture Agreement.

213 Counter-Memorial, {{[ 330-335.

63

235.

236.

The Claimant vigorously argued that the contractual Joint Venture is an investment in and
of itself in accordance with NAFTA Chapter 11 and that it did not necessarily have to
constitute or organize an entity with a separate legal personality —nor does it claim to have
done so. The Tribunal has determined that the Claimant is correct. Yet, one of the
consequences of having established a contractual joint venture is that, unlike corporations
or other types of juridical persons, the investment cannot take a life of its own and make
decisions for itself, for instance, to go into a new line of business. In this particular case,
the Joint Venture Agreement determines what Vento’s investment can do. Obviously, that
does not mean that Vento, MotorBike or Mototransp could not have engaged in other
activities that are not covered by the Joint Venture Agreement but, to the extent that they

did, those activities fall outside the scope of the investment.
The Joint Venture Agreement is quite specific regarding the scope of the investment:

ARTICLE 2

PURPOSE
2.1 The purpose of this Agreement is to (i) define the terms of participation
and cooperation by the Parties in order to promote, sell and in general
commercialize the Products in the Territory, on a first instance through
Motorbike, and afterwards, if the Parties consider it convenient, through a
JV Company to be incorporated pursuant to the laws of the Territory, which
capital stock shall be owned by the Parties on a proportion to be determined
(the “TV Company”); and (ii) share information, know-how and expertise
to engage in the development of a joint business plan to commercialize, with
exclusivity, the Products in the Territory.

ARTICLE 3
COMMERCIALIZATION OF THE PRODUCTS IN THE TERRITORY
3.1 The Parties agree to conduct joint efforts to commercialize the Products
in the Territory through Motorbike pursuant to the terms provided herein
and in any other commercial arrangements agreed by the Parties, and in a
future, if the Parties consider it convenient and/or more profitable, through
the JV Company, pursuant to the terms set forth herein.?!*

214 €.0003, Joint Venture Agreement, Arts. 2-3 (emphasis added).

64

237.

238.

239.

The contracting parties “memorialize[d] in this [Joint Venture] Agreement their
commercial arrangements in order to make optimum use of their respective resources
through a joint business for the commercialization of the Products within Mexico” by
MotorBike.”!> “Products” were defined as motorbikes manufactured by Vento in the US?!®

and “Territory,” as that of the United Mexican States.2!7

Vento and MotorBike (or
subsequently Mototransp) did not amend the terms of the Joint Venture Agreement, enter
into “other commercial arrangements” or incorporate a “JV Company” and the Claimant

did not purport to have modified the investment in any way.

In simple terms, in accordance with the Joint Venture Agreement, Vento would assemble
motorcycles in the United States and export them to Mexico to be commercialized there by
MotorBike. As already noted, Vento closed its assembly facilities at the end of 2004. It
satisfied any ongoing commitments toward its clients and otherwise disposed of its
inventory by 2007. Vento and the Joint Venture ceased all operations in 2007, so much so
that Vento surrendered its authority to do business in California and Florida, it filed its last
federal tax return in 2008 and it let its corporate status lapse in 2009. After 2007, there
were no more “Products,” as defined in the Joint Venture Agreement, to be exported to,
and commercialized in, Mexico and Vento did not commit any further capital or resources
to the Joint Venture. While it entered into the Second Loan Agreement with MotorBike in
2010, the Tribunal has found that it actually did not loan any money to MotorBike and, in
any event, MotorBike had assigned “all and each of its rights and obligations deriving from
the JV Agreement and the [First] Loan Agreement [to] Mototransp, S.A.” in 2006.?!* After
2009, Vento only continued to defend its claims before Mexican administrative and judicial
authorities, but the Claimant does not complain of a denial of national or most favored

nation treatment in the conduct of the administrative or judicial proceedings themselves.

Therefore, the relevant timeframe to assess treatment of both Vento as the investor of

another Party and its investment (i.e. economic activities carried out under the Joint

Venture Agreement) is from 1 October 2001 when Vento was incorporated to 28 August
2009 when it forfeited its corporate status. Activities carried out by MotorBike or
Mototransp to assemble motorcycles in Mexico, including MotorBike’s application for
PROSEC, as well as the importation in Mexico of motorcycles from China by such
companies and their commercialization there —whether or not Vento participated in the
decision-making processes— are beyond the scope of the investment and, therefore, they

are beyond the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.

b. NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1103

The Parties are generally in agreement regarding the elements that need to be considered
in assessing a denial of national treatment or of most-favored nation treatment claim. The
Claimant suggested that the analysis should begin by identifying the “domestic investors
and/or investments in a comparable position with the claimant investor/investments,”?!?
while the Respondent argued that “[f]irst, it must be shown that the Respondent State has
accorded to the foreign investor or its investments —treatment [...] with respect to the
establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation and sale or other

7220 However, given that national treatment and

disposition of the relevant investments.
most favored nation treatment are relative standards that compare the conduct of the host-
State toward certain investors or their investments with respect to the host-State’s conduct
toward other investors or their investments, there is no precise methodology to perform the
analysis. These are necessarily fact-specific enquiries and what may be an appropriate
starting point in one case may not be so in another. In any event, neither the treatment nor
the similarities or differences between the relevant circumstances can be considered in

isolation. What is important are the circumstances as they relate to the alleged treatment

accorded to the investors or investments in question.

In this case there is a more fundamental issue to resolve before engaging in the analysis of

the Respondent’s conduct. The Tribunal has established that Vento is the “investor of

29 Memorial, { 183.

242.

another Party” and the Joint Venture, the “investment” for purposes of NAFTA Chapter
11.7! Yet, it appears that none of the “comparators” identified by the Claimant “in the
marketing, distribution, sales, and servicing of small displacement motorcycles in the
territory of Mexico at the same time as either the Vento-MotorBike or the Vento-
Mototransp joint venture” operated in Mexico through joint venture arrangements.?7?
Thus, the Claimant has conflated the alleged treatment of the “investor/investment,” but it
has not identified to whom or to what Vento should be compared qua investor. All of the
so-called comparators that the Claimant identified are Mexican corporations that are either
Mexican-owned or Japanese-owned and, therefore, investments. The Claimant did not
identify any of the Mexican owners of such corporations as appropriate “comparators”
under NAFTA Article 1102 and, while it understood that two of the corporations “are

223 its denial of most-favored nation

owned by nationals of Japan: Honda and Yamaha,
treatment claim is limited to treatment of the two Japanese-owned Mexican investments.
Consequently, the Tribunal rejects all claims that the Respondent breached NAFTA
Articles 1102(1) or 1103(1) for failure to accord to Vento treatment no less favorable than

that it accorded to Mexican investors or to investors of a non-NAFTA Party.

The Claimant identified nine “enterprises which were engaged in the marketing,
distribution, sales, and servicing of small displacement motorcycles in the territory of
Mexico at the same time as either the Vento-MotorBike or the Vento-Mototransp joint

S.A. de C.V. (“Yamaha”), responsible for the Yamaha brand, and Veloci Motors S.A. de
C.V., responsible for the brand Veloci). However, only three of them, Honda, Yamaha and
Operadoras, were authorized to import motorcycle parts under PROSEC, an import duty
exemption program, between 2001 and 2009.”° The Claimant understood that Honda and
Yamaha were owned by nationals of Japan. The Respondent did not dispute it. Operadoras
was owned by Mexican nationals. Thus, Honda and Yamaha are the relevant investments
for purposes of the NAFTA Article 1103 claim and Operadoras is the relevant investment

for purposes of the NAFTA Article 1102 claim (the “Relevant Mexican Investments”).

According to the Respondent, “it is necessary to begin with a comparison between
domestic and foreign investors [in this case between the investments in question] operating
in the same business or economic sector [...],”°?’ but that is too broad a reference point.
(Tribunal’s translation). This case involves the management, conduct or operation of the
investments in question and the circumstances to consider will be given by the factual
context that is relevant to both, the Claimant’s investment on the one hand, and the
Relevant Mexican Investments on the other. All material circumstances need to be

considered and weighed.

The Claimant presents a rather simplistic argument: it asserts that the Relevant Mexican
Investments “were engaged in the importation of disassembled motorcycles, as

components”?

and those Investments as well as the Joint Venture were “engaged in the
business of [assembly,] marketing, distribution, sales, and servicing of small displacement
motorcycles (i.e. motorcycles with engines between 5O0cc and 250cc) [...] at the same
time.”?”? It concludes, therefore, that they were all “in like circumstances.” The Claimant
summarily dismissed as “nominal” a few of the differences pointed out by the Respondent:

the location of Vento’s assembly facilities in the United States; that motorcycle parts and

components were imported from China by AED; and that fully assembled motorcycles

were then imported into Mexico by MotorBike and others.?°°

The Claimant complains that SAT applied Rule 2(a) to “motorcycle components which
had been imported into the U.S. for production of Vento-branded motorcycles”
subsequently exported to Mexico on the one hand?*! but failed to apply that rule to imports
by the Relevant Mexican Investments of disassembled motorcycles into Mexico on the

other hand2*”, which resulted in:

a. Vento branded motorcycles being subject to a 30% ad valorem importation

duty, while the Relevant Mexican Investments paid an average 10%; and

b. motorcycles produced by the Relevant Mexican Investments having
“enjoyed the benefit of a “Made in Mexico” label, [while] Vento products

have been forced to bear a “Made in China” label instead.”?**

Rule 2(a) comes into play because Vento assembled motorcycles in the United States
exclusively from parts and components imported into the United States by AED from
China. AED assembled the engines and sold them along with the rest of the motorcycle
parts to Vento, who finished assembling the motorcycles. AED certified that the engines
were NAFTA originating goods which in turn allowed Vento to certify that the motorcycles
were NAFTA originating goods as well. MotorBike and other importers were then able to
claim preferential tariff treatment —in effect 0% tariffs— under the NAFTA upon
importation of the motorcycles into Mexico. As a result of the origin verifications, SAT
concluded that motorcycle engines assembled by AED were not produced in the United
States. Rather, the engine parts imported from China were disassembled engines and,
under Rule 2(a), they had to be classified as the finished or fully assembled engines. Thus,

the engines did not meet the change in tariff classification requirement under the applicable

NAFTA rules of origin and could not be certified as NAFTA originating goods. SAT then
moved on to the motorcycles and applied essentially the same reasoning. Since all of the
motorcycle parts and components (including the engine components) for each and every
model of motorcycles assembled by Vento and later exported to Mexico were originally
imported into the United States from China, they were disassembled motorcycles and,
under Rule 2(a), they had to be classified as finished or fully assembled motorcycles. SAT
concluded that the processes carried out by AED and Vento in the United States (and as
Claimant repeatedly emphasized during the Hearing) were simple assembly operations that
did not add any meaningful component in terms of a production process and the essence of
the goods exported to Mexico was not altered because they were disassembled when Vento
purchased them from AED. In other words, SAT found that AED imported motorcycles
from China which Vento subsequently exported to Mexico after carrying out simple
assembly operations. Vento’s motorcycles did not comply with the NAFTA rules of origin
and did not qualify as NAFTA originating goods. Therefore, SAT denied them preferential

tariff treatment and required importers to pay the corresponding import duties.?*>

In contrast, none of the Relevant Mexican Investments was based in the United States.
They were all based in Mexico and carried out all of their assembly, distribution,
marketing, sale and servicing operations there. They imported certain motorcycle parts
and components from China and India under PROSEC for further assembly into

motorcycles, which were then sold directly in the Mexican market.

There are certain similarities: Vento and the Relevant Mexican Investments imported parts
and components from China, they each used them in their respective assembly processes
to produce similar small displacement motorcycles, which were then marketed, distributed
and sold in the Mexican market, and they all offered post-sale servicing. However, many
differences are apparent from the above description. The Claimant dismissed them as

nominal but the Tribunal finds that they were not.

The Tribunal has already alluded to the first and, perhaps, most evident difference: the type
of investment. The Joint Venture was established by contract for a very specific and limited

purpose —and it was the only one of its type among all the investments in question.

The Joint Venture parties made a deliberate choice to establish the assembly plant in the
United States mainly for purposes of being able to label the motorcycles as “Made in the
USA” (or “Assembled in the USA,” as testified by César Nufiez-Cazares at the Hearing),”*°
and assuming they could take advantage of the NAFTA rules of origin. It was a strategic
business decision which figured prominently throughout the Claimant’s pleadings, the
Witness Statements of Claudia and César Niiiez-Cazares and Isaac Calderén Birch, as well
as in the Claimant’s expert reports on damages. Indeed, the Claimant asserted that this
gave it a “reputational advantage.”?*’ Both AED and Vento, respectively, labelled the
engines and motorcycles as “Made in the USA.”?°* The Claimant stated that “[t]he origin
of a motorcycle can have a significant impact on a customer’s purchase decision”:
consumers overwhelmingly believed that motorcycles “Made in USA” were better than
those made in Mexico or China; they would purchase a “Made in USA” motorcycle over
one “Made in China” for the same price and were actually prepared to pay more for
motorcycles “Made in the USA.”2°? One of the Claimant’s witnesses, Javier Sarro Cortina
who worked for Grupo Salinas, the owners of Elektra and Operadoras, testified that “[t]he
brand Vento was attractive for Elektra because the motorcycles were made in the United
States and because the Mexican consumer has admiration for several American brands.”
While the Joint Venture contemplated the possibility of Vento and MotorBike
incorporating a company in Mexico (the so-called JV Company), they obviously never
“consider[ed] it convenient,” even after SAT had determined that Vento’s assembly

process in the United States was insufficient to confer its motorcycles NAFTA origin.

Also, while MotorBike explored early on the possibility of establishing an assembly plant

in Mexico, the Joint Venture parties never really considered relocating to Mexico.

Vento and MotorBike also made a conscious decision to limit the Joint Venture’s industrial
processes to the assembly of motorcycles exclusively from parts and components imported
from China. At the Hearing, César Nuifiez-Cazares made it abundantly clear. He testified:
“The Joint Venture was begun first of all, Vento had the commitment of establishing an
assembly plant in Laredo, Texas.”?4! In response to a question by Respondent’s counsel
about the “idea” of “shifting production to Mexico,” César Ntiiez-Cazares clarified: “in
our work plan”? (i.e. the work plan that he discussed with Isaac Calder6n Birch in 2000
prior to setting up the Joint Venture) “and during our negotiations [of the Joint Venture
Agreement], well, we wanted to ultimately move production of motorcycles from the U.S.

to México that is to say, to shift the assembly plant to México [.. Pes

and in response to
a question from one of the arbitrators, César Ntifiez-Cazares testified: “Our model was
totally different because, I repeat, we have never thought of building motorcycles. We are
assemblers.”*+ At its peak, Vento produced around 38,000 motorcycles? in 2 assembly

lines™4¢

with around 20 employees (perhaps twice that many).?*’ On the sales and
distribution side, MotorBike had around 60 distributors in Mexico and employed around
100 persons who were responsible for market sales, distribution, spare parts and post-sale

services. 48

In contrast, the Relevant Mexican Investments were all corporations constituted in Mexico
that had broader industrial or business activities and significant investments in Mexico.
Honda and Yamaha are worldwide manufacturers of motorcycles (among many other

products), including in Mexico (in fact, Honda participates in the broader automotive

industry in Mexico) where they also have assembly operations. They mainly sold
motorcycles through their own dealerships. Both have had a strong presence in the

Mexican motorcycle sector since well before the Joint Venture was even conceived.”

Neither the Claimant nor the Respondent provided much evidence on the extent of
Operadoras’s industrial processes. The Tribunal has only been able to glean limited
information through indirect evidence. The Tribunal did not have access to the documents
whereby the Secretaria de Economia granted Operadoras its PROSEC authorization or the
minutes of official on-site visits to its facilities, similar to those concerning MotorBike’s

PROSEC applications in 2002.

The Respondent identified Operadoras as a manufacturer and assembler.” According to
Eduardo Diaz Gavito’s evidence, assembly processes are “minor operations” that do not
qualify as manufacturing.7*! PROSEC is only available to direct producers, namely those
who manufacture certain goods (including motorcycles, three and four-wheel motorcycles
and sidecars), and indirect producers who manufacture certain parts and components that
they then supply to direct producers.” He explained that in his more than 18 years of
professional experience, the Secretaria de Economia has only authorized PROSEC to
“those whose productive processes involve the physical or chemical transformation of
goods. That is when the components and inputs undergo a substantial change [...].”?°
(Tribunal’s translation). At the Hearing, he added: “It wouldn’t be enough just to assemble
it [a motorcycle] to be considered as a motorcycle producer; rather in other words, if the
parts were just put together.” However, based on C-0042 which the Claimant gave him
access to, Eduardo Diaz Gavito concluded: “I can observe that these [operations that

Operadoras performs in its plant] equally consist of assembly, in like circumstances, to

those performed by MotorBike.”?°> (Tribunal’s translation). His observation was based on
one sentence of a 24-page document where Operadoras stated that, although the majority
of the parts and components required to assemble Italika motorcycles are imported, it
procured goods in Mexico for over MX$128 million. At the Hearing, Eduardo Diaz Gavito
confirmed that he had never visited Operadoras’s or MotorBike’s facilities and the extent
of his knowledge of their respective industrial processes was, with regard to Operadoras,
that sentence in C-0042, and, for MotorBike, its PROSEC applications and the
corresponding determinations of the Secretaria de Economia.” In general, the Tribunal
found Eduardo Diaz Gavito’s legal opinion very helpful, but it found his conclusion on
Operadoras’s production or industrial processes wanting. It is at odds with what he has
observed in more than 18 years of professional experience. More importantly, the
document in question (C-0042) is a secondary document submitted in 2017; it is neither
Operadoras’s PROSEC application nor its authorization, while MotorBike’s documents
date back to 2002 and include its applications, the records of verification visits and the
ensuing determinations. In the paragraph that precedes the sentence where Operadoras
referred to the assembly of parts and components, it asserted that it had invested close to
MX$232 million in its industrial facilities, which included 4 assembly lines with a capacity
to produce 650,000 motorcycles and had created over 2,300 direct jobs and over 6,000
indirect jobs.”*” There is a monumental difference with MotorBike’s facilities which never
became operational, and even with Vento’s facilities in Laredo. Based on the limited
evidence, the Tribunal can only conclude that it is more likely than not that Operadoras
was a manufacturer as well as an assembler, although it cannot ascertain the extent of its
industrial processes. Yet, the Claimant bears the burden of establishing that Vento was in
similar circumstances to Operadoras. It has not satisfied that burden in respect of the

industrial processes that each of them performed.

The way Vento and MotorBike organized the Joint Venture had other important

implications.

AED imported into the United States the totality of the parts and components that Vento
would later assemble into finished motorcycles. Such imports were subject to U.S. customs
laws and regulations. AED initially imported those inputs from China subject to import
duty exemptions provided for in U.S. laws and regulations as evidenced by its 15 August
2003 and 22 January 2004 “Prior Disclosure[s] for Engine Kits,” whereby it advised CBP
that it had erroneously “imported engine components from China and classified them as
unassembled engines under subheading 8407.31.0080, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the
United States (HTSUS), [pursuant to General Rule of Interpretation (GRI) 2(a)] [...]
subject to a free rate of duty.” However, having “reviewed various [U.S.] Customs rulings
interpreting GRI 2(a)” it had determined that it did not apply to its imported engine kits.
Thus, AED requested that its “engine kits” be retroactively reclassified under the “HTSUS”
and paid CBP the duties it had omitted.?°*

In contrast, the Relevant Mexican Investments imported motorcycle parts and components
into Mexico. As such, they were subject to Mexican customs laws and regulations and,
because the Relevant Mexican Investments had PROSEC authorization, imports were
subject to Mexico’s PROSEC Decree. R-0035 identifies the legal framework applicable
to such imports by the Relevant Mexican Investments: the PROSEC Decree, the Customs
Law and its Regulations, the Federal Tax Code, the Federal Administrative Procedure Law,
two Acuerdos (administrative resolutions) of the Secretaria de Economia, one issuing
general foreign trade rules and criteria and another one concerning procedures conducted
by that agency, and Mexico’s Tariff Schedule under the Import and Export Duties Law.”

Obviously, none of these applied to AED’s imports into the United States.

Vento assembled its motorcycles in Laredo, Texas, and then exported the finished goods
to Mexico. It certified them as originating goods under the NAFTA, which allowed

Mexican importers to claim NAFTA preferential tariff treatment. Vento’s finished

motorcycles were thus subject to the NAFTA, and Mexican customs laws and regulations
upon importation into Mexico before they could enter the Mexican market. The Relevant
Mexican Investments assembled their motorcycles in Mexico and sold them directly in the
Mexican market so the foreign trade legal framework applicable to Vento’s motorcycles

was simply irrelevant.

And, because Vento’s motorcycles had claimed NAFTA tariff preferences, both the
finished goods and the parts and components of which they were comprised were subject
to the treaty’s origin verification procedures. The Mexican Relevant Investments’
motorcycles obviously were not subject to such procedures but neither were the imported
parts and components because their origin was not in question —indeed it was entirely
irrelevant whether they had been imported from China, India or any other country with
which Mexico did not have a free trade agreement— and preferential duties were expressly
authorized under PROSEC. Also, parts and components imported by the Mexican
Relevant Investments under PROSEC were expressly meant to be used in industrial
processes in Mexico to increase Mexican companies’ competitiveness in the Mexican
market and abroad.”° There was nothing to be verified in connection with the duty-free

importation of parts and components by the Relevant Mexican Investments.

Vento was not eligible for PROSEC authorization. Eduardo Diaz Gavito testified that only
juridical persons constituted in Mexico and registered in Mexico’s Federal Taxpayers
Registry were eligible to receive PROSEC authorization.”°! Unlike the NAFTA, which
provided for the elimination of tariffs on all goods, PROSEC was meant to stimulate
production in Mexico in certain industrial sectors. Therefore, it granted tariff preferences
to the importation of certain inputs (i.e. parts and components as well as machinery) listed
in Article 5 of the PROSEC Decree (although the list of inputs was subsequently expanded
through other regulations) in order to produce certain finished goods listed in Article 4 of
the same Decree, including motorcycles. It did not establish preferences for finished
goods. At the Hearing, Eduardo Diaz Gavito explained: “Specifically, if we read Article 4

of the Decree, it says that the goods to be manufactured are 22 tariff items, those listed on

the slide, but what [sic, i.e. that] refers to motorcycles, three-wheel motorcycles, four wheel
motorcycles and sidecars. The Mexican Government is interested in having this
merchandise produced in México, and the benefit accorded for producing motorcycles in

Mexico is to import certain inputs.”?°>

The Claimant complained that Rule 2(a) was not applied to imports of motorcycle parts
and components that the Relevant Mexican Investments made under PROSEC. The
Respondent argued that PROSEC is an exception to the application of Rule 2(a). The
Tribunal finds that it is. It makes no sense that a government program would provide tariff
preferences for the importation of inputs, only to render such preferences meaningless by
requiring that such inputs be classified as the finished good, which does not benefit from
such preferences. More importantly, in contrast to Vento’s assembly model, the Relevant
Mexican Investments were not importing the totality of the parts and components under
PROSEC. At the Hearing, Eduardo Diaz Gavito testified that for the production of
motorcycles, Article 5 of the PROSEC Decree only includes inputs classified under 19
tariff items. He explained that originally it contained many more but import duties have
been completely phased-out on a most-favored nation level over time.”°? Further, unlike
Vento that from 2001-2004 assembled motorcycles exclusively from parts and components
imported from China, the Claimant did not show that the Mexican Relevant Investments
operated in the same manner. Other than the testimony of Isaac Calderén Birch, who in
2016 —eight years after the Joint Venture had ceased to operate— surmised that the six
so-called comparators were importing all of the motorcycle parts and components from
India and China, there is little evidence that would allow the Tribunal to conclude that that
was in fact the case, especially in the relevant period (2001-2009). As noted, Honda and
Yamaha were manufacturing motorcycles in Mexico —albeit, apparently fewer small
displacement motorcycles— long before the Joint Venture came into being. Operadoras
appears to have been moving gradually toward importing more parts and components, but

even in 2017 it was not importing the totality of them? and there is no evidence as to what

might have been the mix of domestically sourced and imported inputs in 2008 (when it

obtained its PROSEC authorization) and 2009.

The Claimant also complained that even if it had relocated its assembly lines to Mexico it
would not have been able to obtain PROSEC authorization and a dispensation of Rule 2(a).
Yet, that was not a result of the discriminatory application of the PROSEC Decree, but
rather because of its business decision to operate exclusively as an assembler of

motorcycles and source all of its parts and components from China.

Finally, we address the “Made in [...]” labels. The Claimant complains that it faced

2 :
265 while

“overwhelming competition” from motorcycles bearing “Made in Mexico” labels,
SAT “deprived Vento of the ability to label its motorcycles as ‘Made in U.S.A.’”?®.
However, there is simply no evidence on the record that Mexican authorities prevented
Vento or MotorBike from labelling their motorcycles as “Made in USA.” That is a country
marking issue unrelated to the NAFTA Rules of Origin, which presumably is governed by
USS. laws and regulations over which Mexican authorities would have no jurisdiction, just
as the “Made in Mexico” mark is governed by Mexico’s laws and regulations. At the
Hearing, César Nuifiez-Cazares presented a novel view which shows that he, at least, clearly
understood the distinction between the NAFTA rules of origin and country of origin

labelling. In response to questions from the Tribunal, he explained:

[A]s far as I recall, unless there was a mistake, we never claimed that the
label said “Made in the USA.” Our product says “Assembled in the
USA."267

[J

Until our last few operations that we carried out in 2005, we never removed
our label that said “Assembled in the USA.”76°

“Assembled in the USA” is the process that we do. We performed an

assembly process. Originating does not determine that it is assembled in the

United States. The originating is only determined by a rule of origin that

specialists explained to us at the time how we had to determine it base on

the NAFTA. And that’s what determines the origin, not that I place a label

on a product because I would have no basis to do so. Labelling —anyone

can label a product and that does not mean that it’s originating. We place

our label based on our process [.. J? (Tribunal’s translation)
In light of César Ntifiez-Cazares’s testimony at the Hearing, the pleadings are simply wrong
on this point. According to his evidence, Vento never labeled its motorcycles (or engines)
as “Made in the USA”; it was neither prevented from labelling them as “Assembled in the
USA” by Mexican authorities nor did it stop attaching that label to its motorcycles until it
ceased production entirely. After Vento closed its Laredo assembly plant in 2004 and the
Joint Venture ceased to operate, MotorBike and later Mototransp imported fully assembled
motorcycles into Mexico, while the Relevant Mexican Investments imported motorcycle
parts and components. MotorBike and Mototransp were not “forced” to label their
products as “Made in China.” Naturally, motorcycles manufactured in China can only be
labelled as “Made in China.” In any event, neither MotorBike nor Mototransp imported
motorcycles from China pursuant to the Joint Venture Agreement and they are beyond the

Tribunal’s jurisdiction and the scope of this dispute.

In sum, the very strategic business choices that Vento and MotorBike made in structuring
the Joint Venture placed the Joint Venture in very different circumstances from those of
the Relevant Mexican Investments. Treatment accorded to the Joint Venture, including
treatment accorded to Vento (and MotorBike) as they operated pursuant to the Joint
Venture Agreement was simply not comparable. The Tribunal therefore finds that there
was no breach of NAFTA Articles 1102 or 1103 by the Respondent and rejects those claims
in their entirety. The Respondent’s objection ratione temporis as it relates to NAFTA

Articles 1102 and 1103 has consequently become moot.

c. NAFTA Article 1104

The Claimant’s NAFTA Article 1104 claim can be disposed of succinctly. The Claimant
merely referred to NAFTA Article 1104” but it provided no explanation as to how the
Respondent failed to accord Vento or the Joint Venture the better of the treatment required
by NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1103 and it did not identify any loss or damage by reason
of, or arising out of, a breach of that provision. Accordingly, the Tribunal dismisses that

claim in its entirety.

NAFTA Article 1105
(dd) The Parties’ Positions

a. Claimant’s Position

The Claimant argues that SAT officials, specifically those who conducted the origin
verification of Vento’s exports of motorcycles to Mexico in 2002 and 2003, including the
verification visits to Vento and AED in 2003 and 2004, “were not operating under the
normal rules of procedure known to Vento and MotorBike, but rather under a secret set of
“marching orders” which required them to come to a particular, discriminatory conclusion,
regardless of how they reached it,” namely “to find some reason to stop the joint venture
from being able to import U.S.A.-made, Vento-branded motorcycles into Mexico on the
duty-free basis to which they were legally entitled.” The Claimant contends that SAT
officials did so by interpreting and applying Rule 2(a) in a novel way, even though it
contradicted the interpretation of that rule by U.S. Customs Officials, and specifically
targeted Vento since Rule 2(a) was not applied to any of Vento’s competitors in Mexico
and none of them were subject to “verification reviews” despite the “normal SAT practice

[having been] to conduct verification reviews of an entire industry.”?7!

The Claimant is not challenging before this Tribunal SAT’s interpretation or application of
Rule 2(a) as a matter of Mexican law or international law. It accepts that under the

NAFTA, SAT had authority to practice origin verifications, including verification visits,

20 See Memorial, Section VI(A); Reply, Section V(A).
211 Memorial, {| 176-178.

80

269.

270.

 

“anywhere in the NAFTA Free Trade Zone [...] for the purpose of ensuring that all imports
into Mexico receive the correct tariff classification and determination of origin” and that it
also had the discretion to interpret and apply Rule 2(a). Moreover, it admits that
“Claimant’s objective is not to demonstrate that the SAT officials who cited Rule 2(a) when
stripping Vento-branded motorcycles of duty-free status were incorrect as a matter of
Mexican law.” However, it argues that SAT officials exercised their authority at the behest
of the incumbent motorcycle industry leaders and AMIA, the automotive industry
association, “for the improper purpose of damaging Vento’s business in Mexico.” The
Claimant also argues that some of the officials who were involved in the verification visit
to Vento and AED in 2003 and whose testimony it submitted in support of its claim have
now declared that, in their view, Vento appeared to be in compliance with its obligations
under Mexican law but that “the audit team members relented when faced with sustained

pressure from their superiors to follow the anti-Vento linea.”?”*

According to the Claimant, Vento’s competitors directly and through AMIA carried out a
smear campaign against the Vento brand publicly claiming that Vento-branded
motorcycles were of Chinese origin and lobbied the Mexican government for protection.
AMIA accused Vento of transshipping Chinese motorcycles in the United States, and

subsequently exporting them to Mexico as originating goods under NAFTA preferential

 

tariff treatment. Allegedly, SAT officials who conducted the verification visits were told
to expect to find transshipment operations and, in any event, instructed “to find the Vento
MotorBike joint venture non-compliant with Mexican customs law” and that motorcycles
assembled by Vento did not qualify as originating goods under the NAFTA for the purpose
of protecting “established motorcycle firms in Mexico from an unwanted U.S.

competition.”?”>

In sum, the Claimant argues that the Respondent’s conduct was arbitrary and
discriminatory because SAT officials, acting under express “marching orders,” specifically

targeted Vento and the Joint Venture operations, to the exclusion of Vento’s competitors

272.

in Mexico —indeed at the behest of such competitors— in order to reach a predetermined

outcome for the purpose of driving Vento out of the Mexican motorcycle market.

b. Respondent’s Position

The Respondent argues generally that the Claimant has not established a breach of the
customary international law minimum standard of treatment prescribed by NAFTA Article
1105. While it denies that “marching orders” were given, the Respondent argues that the
Claimant has failed to establish that a prohibition against such type of orders can be
characterized as a rule of customary international law. The Respondent asserts that the
Claimant in reality is complaining about Mexican authorities having conducted a
verification of origin and found a breach of the NAFTA’s origin provisions and of
Mexico’s Customs Law and that the Claimant wants the Tribunal to rule on the outcome
of the verification of origin, which has been decided by Mexican tribunals and would be

beyond the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.?”*

The Respondent denies that “marching orders” were issued to audit Vento for purposes of
establishing a specific outcome. It admits that the verification of origin was prompted by
the Mexican motorcycle industry acting through AMIA, but it explained in some detail the
procedure leading to a decision by SAT to carry out the audit. Early in 2003, AMIA
approached SAT’s Administracién Central de Auditoria Fiscal Internacional (“ACAFY”)
to complain that Vento-branded motorcycles were being imported into Mexico under
NAFTA preferential tariff treatment but did not qualify as NAFTA originating goods.
ACAFI requested that AMIA submit a formal complaint using an official form for that
purpose. AMIA filed the complaint and submitted supporting evidence. It argued that
Vento-branded motorcycles were manufactured and assembled in China except for the
wheels and the handlebar, which were assembled in Vento’s plant in Laredo and then

exported to Mexico as NAFTA originating goods.?”>

The Respondent noted that, although the Claimant submitted witness evidence that
“marching orders” were issued, none of the Claimant’s witnesses who allegedly received
such “marching orders” identified who had issued those orders to each of them or pressured
them to reach a predetermined outcome. The Respondent offered the witness statement of
two of the superiors of the SAT officials who were present during the verification visits to
Vento and AED — José Ramén Jaéuregui Tejeda who was Gabriel Arriaga Callejas’
immediate superior, and Gabriel Oliver Garcia who was the highest ranking official within
ACAFI at the time the verification visits were conducted. They denied having issued or
relayed any such “marching orders” and, in any event, they both left SAT before the final

decisions were issued.?”°

The Respondent argued that the decision to conduct an audit was not based exclusively on
a complaint filed by private parties nor was it taken by a single official within SAT. It
explained that SAT carried out its own preliminary investigation and gathered additional
information and evidence through several of its own departments and outside sources
including U.S. customs authorities. If ACAFI concluded that an audit was warranted, the
case was submitted to an internal committee comprised of senior officials of different areas
within SAT who would make a joint decision. The Respondent argues that this was the

procedure followed in Vento’s case.?””

The result of the verification of origin was the Respondent’s conclusion that motorcycles
assembled by Vento in the United States did not comply with the NAFTA rules of origin
and, therefore, they could not benefit from NAFTA’s preferential tariff treatment. The
Respondent argues that the views that certain persons who were involved in the origin
verifications have expressed in the present proceedings to the effect that Vento was in full
compliance with Mexican customs laws or regarding the application of Rule 2(a) are

irrelevant because SAT’s determination is correct as a matter of Mexican law since it has

been validated by Mexican courts, to which Vento had full access. Vento was able to fully

exercise its rights to challenge such measures and such remedies were exhausted.””°

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

a. The Minimum Standard of Treatment

The NAFTA Free Trade Commission has clarified that NAFTA Article 1105(1) prescribes
the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens (Joint Statement
by the NAFTA Free Trade Commission, 31 July 2001).?” There is no dispute between the
Parties about that. Both Parties endorse the minimum standard of treatment under

international law required by NAFTA Article 1105 as formulated by the ICSID tribunal in

280

Waste Management IT,”*” the infringement of which requires proof of conduct attributable

to the State and harmful to the claimant that:

[...] is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory
and exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack
of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety —as
might be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial
proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and candour in an
administrative process. In applying this standard it is relevant that the
treatment is in breach of representations made by the host State which were
reasonably relied on by the claimant.?*!
However, the Respondent argues that, whether or not “marching orders” were issued, the
Claimant must prove a rule of customary international law that prohibits the notion of
“marching orders” and provide evidence of the relevant state practice and the necessary
opinion iuris.?°* On the other hand, the Claimant accepts the Waste Management II
formulation as a good starting point, and expands it in respect of obligations for the state

to act transparently, to provide certainty and to refrain from affecting the basic expectations

of investors,?8?

although the Claimant’s main argument is that the conduct of SAT officials
lacked due process, and it was arbitrary and discriminatory. The Tribunal will address these

arguments in turn.

(i) “Marching orders” as a specific category of customary international law

The Respondent’s argument that the Claimant would need to prove that customary
international law specifically proscribes notions of so-called marching orders can be
disposed of summarily. The Claimant is correct that it does not need to prove the existence
of a discrete rule of customary international law that specifically prohibits particular
actions that states or state agents engage in. While these types of rules may emerge, it is
self-evident that this is not how international custom develops. Nor is there any process

that typifies a list of specific actions under the aegis of customary international law.

“Marching orders” is, after all, simply how this Claimant chose to characterize the
Respondent’s conduct about which it complains. Nevertheless, the Claimant has described
that conduct in sufficient detail and it contends that it breaches the customary international
law standard of treatment as articulated by the Waste Management I tribunal, with which
both Parties agree. As noted, the Claimant mainly argues that such conduct was arbitrary,

discriminatory and lacking in due process.?*+

(ii) Evolving nature of customary international law

The Claimant contends that customary international law was not “frozen in amber” at the
time of the Neer decision (by reference to how the Pope & Talbot tribunal characterized
Canada’s position regarding the fair and equitable treatment standard in that case) but,
rather, that it is evolutive. While Claimant acknowledges that the minimum standard of
treatment of aliens under customary international law goes back a long time, it argues that
the fair and equitable treatment standard is more novel, dating back only to 1951, and that

it was adopted to improve the minimum standard of treatment.7*°

283.

Even if the expression “fair and equitable treatment” only began to be used in the early
1950s (Paparinskis notes: “The precise language of ‘fair and equitable’ or very similar to
that was not unknown to the pre-Second World War international law” and he traces it as
far back as the 17th century through those or comparable terms7*°), the standard was not
created then, as suggested by the Claimant. Nor is there any support for the Claimant’s
proposition that that particular formulation was meant to improve a standard of customary
international law by way of its inclusion in a treaty, that is as a matter of conventional
international law. Evidently, custom is not created by decree, much less by inclusion of a

particular expression or formula in a treaty.

Rather, the content of the minimum standard of treatment, including that of the fair and
equitable treatment standard, must be found in customary international law. Certainly,
customary international law evolves, but it does so in the same manner in which it is
created: through international custom, that is from a general and consistent practice of
States that they follow from a sense of legal obligations. The NAFTA Free Trade
Commission has acknowledged that there is an international minimum standard of

treatment of aliens and the fair and equitable treatment standard is part of that minimum.

As already indicated above, the Parties have endorsed the formulation of the minimum
standard in Waste Management II. The Claimant even “recommends” that the Tribunal
apply the formulation in this case. The Respondent has noted that the standard set by Waste
Management II is high and has referred to Cargill, which it considers an amplification of
Waste Management II. The Cargill tribunal observed that the words used to describe
conduct in breach of the minimum standard, although imprecise, are significantly narrower
than the standard present in the Tecmed award. 287 On the other hand, the Claimant refers
to Waste Management II as a point of departure to expand the content of the minimum

standard by relying on principles of good faith and due process and drawing wide ranging

86

conclusions for which the Claimant finds support in Tecmed.*** The Parties’ arguments
for a standard higher or lower do not detract from Waste Management II, which, in the

view of the Tribunal, reflects a proper understanding of the minimum standard of treatment.

284. Accordingly, the Tribunal will analyze the claims that the Respondent’s actions breached
NAFTA Article 1105 against the minimum standard of treatment as formulated by the
Waste Management I tribunal that both Parties agree is a correct expression of NAFTA
Article 1105. In essence, the Claimant complains of a lack of due process, arbitrary and
discriminatory treatment in SAT’s administrative proceedings which led to the 26 April
2004 and 20 September 2005 determinations that denied NAFTA preferential tariff
treatment to motorcycles assembled by Vento in the United States and imported into

Mexico during 2002 and 2003.

 

b. SAT’s determinations are not i i with Mexican or international
law applicable to origin or customs procedures

285. The Claimant has stated that it does not seek “to demonstrate that the SAT officials who

cited Rule 2(a) [...] were incorrect as a matter of Mexican law”?®?

and “[flor the avoidance
of any doubt, [that] Vento is not asking the Tribunal to determine whether the construction

of LIGIE Rule 2(a) adopted by SAT offi

  

ials was plausible or otherwise justifiable as a

matter of municipal law.”?°°. However, it is not merely a question of whether different

°88 Tn arguing that the general principle of good faith informs the fair and equitable treatment standard, which therefore
requires a state to act transparently to provide certainty to foreign investors, and to refrain from affecting their basic
expectations, the Claimant misquoted from Bing Cheng for the proposition that, in the absence of good faith,
international law would be a mockery. Memorial, ff 149-150, referring to, Bin Cheng, General Principles of Law as
Applied by International Court and Tribunals (CUP: Cambridge, 2006) at 113. Bing Cheng, however, was referring
specifically to the principle of pacta sunt servanda. The text quoted by Bin Cheng comes from the Interlocutory
Decision on Jurisdiction in the Rudloff case of the United States — Venezuela Mixed Claims Commission (1903) where
Umpire Barge rejected Venezuela’s jurisdictional objections because the two nations had agreed in a Protocol of 17
February 1903 to submit to the Commission “[a]ll claims owned by citizens of the United States of America against
the Republic of Venezuela which have not been settled by diplomatic agreement or by arbitration between the two
Governments [...].” In his decision, Umpire Barge recalled “that the Commission, whose whole jurisdiction is only
founded on this agreement, has certainly above all to apply the great rule, “pact servanda,” without which international
as well as civil law would be a mere mockery [...].” Rudloff Case (Interlocutory), US-Venezuela Mixed Claims
Commission (1903-5) UNRIAA 255. The Claimant quoted Bin Cheng as follows: “Good faith ‘is [also] an
indisputable rule of international law, without which the very notion of international law itself would be a mockery.””
Memorial, { 149. The Tribunal disapproves of these tactics.

legal interpretations were plausible. It bears emphasizing at the outset that the evidence

before this Tribunal shows that:

SAT’s determinations that motorcycles assembled by Vento in the United
States and exported to Mexico in 2002 and 2003 were not originating goods
and could not benefit from NAFTA preferential treatment, including
through the application of Rule 2(a), stand as a correct application of

Mexican law;

in deciding the challenges that both Vento and AED brought against SAT’s
decisions, the Mexican courts interpreted —albeit for internal law
purposes— the relevant provisions of NAFTA Chapters 4 and 5 and they
are the only evidence before this Tribunal of the interpretation of those

provisions to the case at hand by a competent court; and

neither SAT’s determinations nor the Mexican courts’ decisions were
challenged by the United States as inconsistent with Mexico’s NAFTA
obligations, the United States being the only Party that could have raised a
claim under the appropriate dispute settlement provisions (i.e. NAFTA
Chapter 20) regarding the interpretation or application of NAFTA Chapters
4 and 5.

(i) SAT’s determinations are a correct application of Mexican law

The Claimant admits: “Vento exhausted its local remedies by challenging the final
decisions relating to the 2002 and 2003 audits before Mexican federal courts.””°! The same
holds true of AED. Indeed, Vento and AED resorted to SAT’s internal administrative
revocation proceedings and then separately challenged SAT’s determinations before
Mexico’s courts. Each of them first sought to annul SAT’s determinations before the
TFJFA, which confirmed them; and each of them subsequently challenged the

constitutionality of those judgments before Mexico’s federal amparo courts. Different

88

287.

288.

289.

courts with different compositions decided those challenges. The final determinations and

judgments in every case consistently upheld SAT’s decisions.

The Claimant has not raised a denial of justice claim. The most that it does is to assert

faintly that “Vento’s challenges took far too long — twelve years — to resolve”?°”,

, something
that “seemed like an inordinate period of time even for the Mexican court practice.”?” Yet,
it did not provide any details of how those proceedings unfolded or what may have delayed

a final decision.

The evidence shows that Vento specifically challenged SAT’s determinations on the
administrative appeal concerning the 2003 and 2004 origin verifications before the TFJFA
because SAT issued both of them long after the legal deadlines had passed. The TFJFA
rejected the claims because the law expressly gives private parties the option to either
challenge a government agency’s failure to issue a determination within the legal
timeframe, or to wait for the agency to issue the determination. The TFJFA found that
SAT had indeed exceeded the legal timeframe for issuing its respective decisions on the
administrative appeals. However, it noted that it was open for Vento at all times to
challenge SAT’s failure to issue a timely determination and reasoned that, having chosen

to wait, it was precluded from complaining about the delay.?**

As it turns out as well, the Respondent’s evidence shows that Vento in fact succeeded in
three separate amparo proceedings involving SAT’s 2004 and 2005 determinations,
respectively, twice in 2013 and once again in 2015 because, among other things, the TFJFA
had failed to consider Vento’s evidence that the U.S. customs authorities had allegedly
determined that Rule 2(a) did not apply to the subject goods —an allegation that the
Claimant has also made before this Tribunal. Both the Ninth Circuit Court in 2013 and
2015 and the Fourth Circuit Court in 2013 remanded the corresponding judgments to the
TFJFA which, accordingly, in each case revoked its judgment, duly considered the

evidence and otherwise complied with the amparo courts’ decisions and rendered new

291.

295

judgments again confirming SAT’s decisions. Vento again challenged each of those
judgments before the amparo courts. Thus, whilst the Claimant has provided no details of
how the domestic administrative and judicial proceedings unfolded following the issuance
by SAT of its 2004 and 2005 determinations, or even attempted to explain by what
standards they took long, the Claimant cannot complain that such proceedings took longer

because it exercised its rights even if only with partial success.”

The Claimant submitted the evidence of Gabriel Arriaga Callejas who testified that “the
determination made by SAT to Vento had no precedent, and it was a complete manipulation
of the regulations at hand in order to determine a breach in terms of Rule 2(a).”?°° In the
view of the Tribunal, there is very little credibility to be given to Gabriel Arriaga Callejas’s
testimony. For one thing, while he speaks of SAT as though it were a third person, he was
part of SAT himself, and he was personally and directly involved as a lawyer in drafting
and issuing the 2004 and 2005 determinations in question. Indeed, he initialed the 2004
determination before José Alberto Orttizar Carcova signed it and it was notified to Vento.
By April 2004, when the determination was issued, both Gabriel Oliver Garcia and José
Ramon Jauregui Tejeda, Gabriel Arriaga Callejas’s immediate superior, had left SAT and
neither of their positions had been filled. Thus, Gabriel Arriaga Callejas was at that time
the senior lawyer within ACAFI and the official who was ultimately responsible for

ensuring the legality of that determination.

Gabriel Arriaga Callejas also testified to the existence of the so-called marching orders.
Mr. Arriaga asserted that “[a]ny official who transgresses these informal rules will likely
lose any opportunity for promotions and in some cases could be regarded as disobeying an
order of a superior, which leads to the immediate dismissal from the position.””°’ At the
Hearing he testified that he considered that the situation surrounding issuance of the

determinations was absolutely irregular.?°* Yet, he not only failed to report it as such (he

testified that he had no one to report it to,“”” which the Tribunal finds very hard to believe),

but he continued to work at SAT for five more years and was promoted twice (while his

immediate superiors, as noted, had left SAT prior to the first determination being issued).*°°

The evidence before this Tribunal does not show anything irregular about the application
of Rule 2(a), but there is very little credibility to be given to the statement of a witness who
accepts that he committed an irregularity and, by his own admission, benefitted from that.
In any event, whatever Gabriel Arriaga Callejas may have believed then or now, even the
Claimant accepts that SAT’s determinations, and specifically its application of Rule 2(a),

were “plausible enough to survive judicial scrutiny”**!

and, more importantly, the
overwhelming and consistent evidence of Mexican administrative authorities on appeal,
and four —likely five— different Mexican federal courts (the TFJFA on separate cases
brought by Vento and AED, respectively, and three federal amparo courts, the Fourth and
Ninth Circuit Courts in amparo actions brought by Vento involving, respectively, SAT’s
2004 and 2005 determinations, as well as the Eighteenth Circuit Court (and likely another
circuit court in a different amparo proceeding brought by AED)) is that SAT’s

determinations of 2004 and 2005 are a correct application of Mexican law.

(ii) SAT’s determinations stand as a correct application of NAFTA for
purposes of Mexican law
The TFJFA reviewed the consistency of SAT’s 2004 and 2005 determinations with
NAFTA Chapters 4 and 5. The High Chamber of the TFJFA had such jurisdiction: “The
Second Section of the High Chamber of the Fiscal and Administrative Justice Federal
Tribunal is competent under section XIII of Article 14 and section VIII of Article 23 of its
Organic Law, because the claimant [Vento] argues that the North American Free Trade
Agreement was breached to its detriment [...].” Quoting relevant jurisprudence, the court
added “Sections of the High Chamber are competent to decide cases where the

determination that is challenged is based on an international trade treaty or agreement

entered into by Mexico or where the claimant submits that such treaties or agreements have
not been applied to its benefit.”*°? (Tribunal’s translation). As noted, the TFJFA judgments

were reviewed by Mexico’s federal amparo courts.

Mexican courts found SAT’s determinations to be consistent with Mexico’s obligations
under Chapters 4 and 5 of the NAFTA. To be sure, those decisions concern the
interpretation and application of the NAFTA within the realm of Mexico’s internal law.
Nevertheless, they are the only evidence before this Tribunal of the interpretation of those

provisions to the case at hand by a competent court.

c. Mexico’s administrative and judicial decisions have not been challenged as
a matter of international law
The Claimant argues that “U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency (“U.S. CBP”)
certified that imported engines and motorcycles components by AED are not subject to the
General Rules of Interpretation 2(a)” and that they “qualified as having been made in the
U.S.A. under the terms of NAFTA Article 401 and Annex 401.”°°3 Those statements are

not accurate. CBP never so certified.

As shown by the Respondent, AED itself began importing motorcycle parts and

components free of duty and classifying them as unassembled kits under Rule 2(a):

Since 2001, AED has imported engine components from China and
classified them as unassembled engines under subheading 8407.31.0080,
Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) subject to a free
rate of duty [...] [having] concluded that the components comprising the
engine kits should be classified as unassembled engines pursuant to General
Rule of Interpretation (GRI) 2(a).7"

Shortly after the first verification visit to Vento’s assembly plant in Laredo and only a few
days before the verification visit to AED’s plant, AED submitted to the CBP a “Prior
disclosure for Engine Kits Entered Under Subheading 8407.31.0080,” whereby it declared

that it had determined that Rule 2(a) did not apply to its imported “engine kits.” Instead,
they should be classified as “bulk components destined for an assembly operation in
Laredo.” AED assessed and paid the import duties that it had omitted.*°° AED later
requested a “Classification Ruling” from the CBP: “At issue is whether the engine
components in question must be classified as unassembled engines [...] pursuant to
General Rule of Interpretation (“GRI”) 2a.”°°° It specifically described such “engine
components in question” as only “crankshaft [sic] and spark plugs used in the production
of motorcycles” and asked: “If the engine components are not classified as unassembled
engines under heading 8407, under which subheadings should the crankshafts and
sparkplugs [sic] for engines be classified?”*°"’ The CBP replied: “The articles in question
are described as spark plugs and crankshafts for internal combustion engines for
motorcycles.”*°8 As a result, it found: “Based on the facts that you [AED] have made
available, we find that the imported engine components are not unassembled engines within
the meaning of Note 2(a) of the General Rules of Interpretation (GRI). Accordingly, the
subject spark plugs and crankshafts are to be separately classified.”*°? This letter is referred

to in later correspondence as “the New York Ruling.”

In September 2004, shortly after SAT issued its first determination concerning motorcycles
imported during 2002, the CBP sent a letter to José Alberto Orttizar Carcova (who was
present during the 2003 verification visit and who had just signed SAT’s 26 August 2004
determination). The letter stated that the New York Ruling had “classified AED’s
unassembled engines as individual components and not as a General Interpretative Rule
(GIR) 2(a) unassembled engine” and that, consequently, SAT’s determination “is in
conflict with our [i.e. CBP’s] interpretation of the Harmonized System and the ruling issued

to AED for the components that they import into the United States [i.e. the New York

Ruling].” Thus, it warned: “Based on our ruling and examination by CBP personnel, we

believe that a successful claim can be made under Article 401(b).”*!°

It is quite obvious that the CBP letter to José Alberto Ortizar Carcova misconstrued the
New York Ruling. Evidently, spark plugs and crankshafts —two of the approximately
2,000 parts that make up a motorcycle engine— are not motorcycle engines and should be

classified separately, which is what the New York Ruling determined.

This issue was analyzed in detail by the TFJFA on two separate occasions. Indeed, that
was the reason why the Fourth and Ninth Circuit Courts independently granted Vento
amparos and remanded the judgments. Both Circuit Courts instructed the TFJFA to
consider the New York Ruling and related evidence. The TFJFA did and arrived at the
conclusion that the New York Ruling said exactly what it says: spark plugs and crankshafts
are not unassembled motorcycle engines. Consequently, the New York Ruling had no
bearing on SAT’s application of Rule 2(a). The Circuit Courts found no fault with the

revised judgments, and ultimately denied Vento’s subsequent amparo actions.*!!

Although the author of the letter to José Alberto Orttizar Carcova expressed CBP’s belief
that a successful claim could be made against Mexico under NAFTA Chapter 4, the United
States never did so. This Tribunal does not need to speculate why the United States
customs authorities did not accurately describe the New York Ruling or why the United
States did not file a claim against Mexico. The fact is that it did not, and SAT’s
determinations stand unchallenged as a matter of the interpretation and application of

NAFTA Chapters 4 and 5.

(i) Alleged lack of due process

The Claimant complains of a lack of due process in the origin verifications that culminated
in SAT’s 2004 and 2005 determinations that denied NAFTA preferential treatment to
motorcycles that Vento exported to Mexico during 2002 and 2003. The Claimant’s main

argument is that SAT officials who were involved in those origin procedures were under

“secret ‘marching orders’ which compel[ed] them to arrive at a pre-determined result,
regardless of whether that result is objectively correct or appropriate” in order “to halt and

reverse Vento’s expansion into Mexico’s motorcycle market.”*!?. It argues:

[The] “secret practice of issuing and observing “marching orders” is
blatantly inconsistent with the rule of law” [and offends] “the principle of
due process, as it is impossible for a foreign investor whose enterprise has
become the target of a marching order to even know the case against him,
much less defend against it. Moreover, marching orders necessarily
constrain SAT officials from performing their statutory duties in a fair and
objective manner, forcing them to exercise their authority for an improper
purpose instead — viz. to reach a predetermined result dictated from
above.

The Claimant adds that implementation of such “marching orders” was necessarily non-
compliant with basic norms of due process because they were not known to Vento, which
rendered it impossible for it to obtain a fair administrative adjudication of its case and,

indeed, denied it “elementary due process” because, if an effective remedy was available

 

als had acted

  

from Mexico’s courts, it was deprived of it as it did not learn that SAT offi

under “marching orders” until after they had exhausted all avenues of review and appeal.?!*

The Claimant relies principally on the witness statements of Gabriel Arriaga Callejas and
Guillermo Massieu Urquiza. It also submitted the witness statements of José Alberto
Orttizar Carcova and Daniel Ortiz Nashiki. The latter two, along with Gabriel Arriaga
Callejas, were three of the four SAT officials who conducted the verification visits to
Vento’s and AED’s plants in Laredo, Texas in 2003. Notably, however, neither Mr.

Orttizar Carcova nor Mr. Ortiz Nashiki testified that they were under “marching orders.”

Guillermo Massieu Urquiza’s testimony is of no assistance to the Tribunal because he was
offered as a fact witness but he was not involved in, and has no personal or direct

knowledge of, any of the relevant facts of this case. He testifies that he “was not part of

the team that audited Vento” in 2003 and 2004.°!5 He joined SAT in 2009, shortly before
SAT decided the administrative appeals of its 2004 and 2005 determinations (revocation
proceedings) but he “did not serve in the revocations appeal area” while he worked for
SAT.2!® His only involvement was minimal, sometime between 2011 and 2013 (he does
not specify when) because the legal department in charge of defending SAT’s
determinations in the annulment proceedings brought by Vento (and AED) before the
TFJFA “requested a technical opinion” (presumably from him or from the area where he
worked) “to respond to arguments made by the taxpayer” (presumably Vento) “in his claim

for nullity,” although he was not personally involved in those proceedings either.*!”

As already noted, Gabriel Arriaga Callejas’s testimony is simply not credible. He testifies
that on three occasions, including in respect of Vento’s origin verification, he “personally
witnessed marching orders from higher-ranking officials being performed by public
servants which required them to deviate the legal criteria that should have been applied in
the circumstances” (sic).*!* He states specifically “[I was] told by my superior to make sure
that there were indeed transshipment operations to re-label the motorcycles” assembled by
Vento in Laredo and then exported to Mexico.*!? He explained: “I understood this aspect
of his direction to be a marching order and confirmed it with Mr. [José Ramon] Jauregui
[Tejeda]. We were directed to ensure that we found something against Vento’s operations

sold in Mexico and that it had to be stopped.”*?!_ Mr. Arriaga, however, did not identify
who actually gave him those “marching orders.” His immediate superior was José Ramon
Jauregui Tejeda. Mr. Arriaga initially declared that he confirmed with Mr. Jauregui the
“marching orders” that both of them allegedly received from an unidentified person. He

did not say that Mr. Jauregui Tejeda was the one who gave him such orders. Mr. Jauregui

Tejeda and Mr. Oliver Garcia, who was the head of ACAFI at the time the verification
visits took place, denied that either gave, received or confirmed such “marching orders.”
In his second witness statement, Mr. Arriaga Callejas declared: “specifically with respect
to the marching orders I was given in Vento’s particular case, it is important to add the
instructions I was given by my hierarchical superior upon ordering the verification visit to
Vento, who expressly stated that we should find, by whatever means possible, reasons to

disqualify said motorcycles as originating goods.”?”? (Tribunal’s translation).

It is telling, however, that even then, faced with Gabriel Oliver’s and José Ramon
Jauregui’s rebuttal, Mr. Arriaga Callejas appears to suggest that it might have been Mr.
Jaduregui Tejeda who gave him such orders —which meant he was changing his prior
testimony— but still failed to identify the person by name and to provide any details of the
circumstances in which such orders were given specifically to him. Furthermore, at the
Hearing, when Mr. Arriaga Callejas explained why he had not reported to his superiors at
SAT the 2004 determination as having been an “irregular situation” (by then both Mr.
Oliver Garcia and Mr. Jauregui Tejeda had left SAT), he responded that he had no access
to them: “No. There was no access. The general administrator did not grant anybody access.
So we did not have that possibility to go higher up.”???. (Tribunal’s translation). The
Claimant attempts to shrug-off the evident inconvenience of a nameless, unidentified
senior official: “Obviously, it is in the very nature of these marching orders that the official
at the other end of the line, i.e. the person called upon to implement it, is generally unaware
of who first requested it.”**+ But that does not dispose of the issue. Gabriel Arriaga
Callejas has testified that someone personally gave him specific orders. Yet, he has failed

to give any indication of who that person might have been.

That is not the only inconsistency in the Claimant’s argument and Mr. Arriaga Callejas’s
testimony. The Claimant argues that “by the time the first origin verification review was

conducted in June 2003, it appears that SAT officials were united in having already made

up their minds that Vento motorcycles were non-originating and that Vento was engaged
in the illegal transshipment of Chinese motorcycles through the U.S. into Mexico, falsely
claiming their products to have been made in the U.S.A.”??> Mr. Arriaga Callejas testified
that he was personally ordered to find that Vento was engaged in illegal transshipment
operations, as had been every other “member of the team who participated in Vento’s on-
site audit.” Yet, his testimony is at odds with that of José Alberto Orttizar Carcova who
testified that AMIA had expressed concern about Chinese motorcycles that were being
transshipped through the United States by Vento, competing unfairly with motorcycles
produced by the Mexican industry and had taken a significant share of the Mexican market
in a short time.*?° José Alberto Orttizar Carcova declared that, after internal meetings at
SAT and initial deliberations: “The first instructions I received then were to analyze the
information and verify it against the information in the authority’s [i.e. SAT’s] institutional
systems [...] [and] to contact the complainants to better understand the issues,” which he
did “in order to learn first-hand of the alleged transshipment of motorcycles by Vento.”*2”
(Tribunal’s translation). In fact, according to Daniel Ortiz Nashiki, Mr. Ortizar Carcova
relayed these instructions to him and it was Mr. Ortiz Nashiki who actually accessed SAT’s
databases and gathered all the information concerning imports of Vento motorcycles, as
well as information about other importers.*?® Having met with AMIA, Mr. Orttizar
Carcova requested that it file a formal written complaint in accordance with SAT’s
guidelines for such purposes, and to provide “the background, data and information that
would allow the area where I was working to better direct its analysis processes.”*7?
(Tribunal’s translation). Mr. Orttizar Carcova’s evidence shows that he led the initial
analysis of all that information and he concluded that an origin verification was warranted.
The matter was then submitted to the Audit Programming Committee comprised of senior
officials of different areas within SAT, which reviewed it and authorized initiating an

origin verification.*°° Mr. Orttzar Carcova was the highest-ranking official during, and

the one who led, the verification visits to Vento’s and AED’s plants. It appears that he,
himself, had formed the view that SAT needed to investigate whether Vento was engaged

in transshipment.

In any event, even if he or the other auditors who visited Vento’s and AED’s plants in 2003
were instructed to find that Vento was transshipping Chinese motorcycles, they plainly
disregarded any such instructions. The statements of both the Claimant’s and the
Respondent’s witnesses (even that of Mr. Arriaga Callejas) are consistent in this respect.
More importantly, there is no mention at all of transshipment or similar operations in any
of SAT’s decisions. SAT found that Vento was engaged in simple assembly operations**!
—Jjust as they have been described repeatedly by the Claimant in these proceedings. The
decisions turn on an entirely different issue that the Tribunal has already addressed and

will not repeat here.

Nor does the evidence support that the SAT auditors or other officials who were involved
in the origin verifications were compelled —or even predisposed— “to arrive at a pre-
determined result.” Quite the opposite. Other than the testimony of Mr. Arriaga Callejas,
that of the Claimant’s witnesses, José Alberto Ortizar Cércova and Daniel Ortiz Nashiki,
as well as that of the Respondent’s witnesses, Gabriel Oliver Garcia and José Ramén
Jauregui Tejeda, is largely consistent, but José Alberto Orttizar Carcova persuasively
articulates that the auditors’ modified and refined their thinking and reasoning as the
verification progressed. Preliminary conclusions were put to the test; more evidence was
gathered and analyzed; and officials met and deliberated regularly before reaching a final
decision in a collegiate manner. As noted, at the outset AMIA approached SAT to
complain about Vento’s operations. José Alberto Orttizar Carcova requested that it submit
a formal written complaint and to provide supporting evidence and information, which
AMIA did. The complaint was analyzed and submitted to a Committee which authorized
commencing an origin verification.**? A verification visit took place at Vento’s assembly

plant in Laredo where the auditors verified that Vento had an assembly plant with around

50 workers.*> Upon returning from the first verification visit, Mr. Orttzar Carcova

reported to Mr. Oliver Garcia that, in his view, “the exported goods under preferential tariff
treatment complied with the specific rule of origin and therefore qualified as originating
goods.”>*4 (Tribunal’s translation). Nonetheless, Mr. Orttizar Carcova declared that that
was only a preliminary conclusion that needed to be corroborated.**> Consequently, the
officials involved in the origin verification held numerous meetings, and analyzed all the
information that Vento had supplied, including invoices and declarations of origin issued
by AED.*°° Asa result, the group as a whole agreed to audit AED because the engine “was
an essential component and its value was decisive in the regional value content
calculation.”**’ (Tribunal’s translation). Following the verification visit to AED, the
documents gathered during both verification visits were comprehensively analyzed and
after deliberating over the results, the officials involved concluded as a group that Rule
2(a) was applicable and found that the subject motorcycles, in fact, did not qualify as

NAFTA originating goods.***

There was nothing “secretive” about the process either. The Claimant’s evidence shows
that AMIA had made its position publicly known and it was widely reported in the press.**?
In fact, that is what prompted the Claimant to invite Mr. Mario Cérdova L6pez, Central
Administrator of Customs Audits, to visit Vento’s plant in December 2002 and see first-
hand its assembly operations.*“° Mr. Cérdova Lépez is reported by one of Mexico’s leading
newspapers to have said then: “if there are reasonable doubts about the origin of the
vehicles, an international audit is undertaken” and added that SAT would likely visit

Vento’s plant but explained that the process leading to an international audit was difficult

deliberation and decision-making processes within SAT which, in fact, took several months
before SAT, in April 2003, informed the U.S. customs authorities that it would undertake
an origin verification of motorcycles exported by Vento in 2002, and later that same month

notified Vento commencement of the origin verification.*#?

In every hierarchical structure there is an inherent line of authority or command. The
executive branch of essentially all governments is organized in this manner. Instructions
are given, received and executed as a matter of course. To say that officials lower in the
hierarchy receive and execute instructions or orders given by higher-ranking officials is
nothing more than to describe one aspect of how governments —at least their executive
branches— operate. Nonetheless, it is not unusual for governments to introduce checks
and balances into these lines of authority or command. Both the Claimant’s and the
Respondent’s witnesses have shown that SAT operated in this manner. Some of the key
decisions were taken in a collegiate manner. For instance, the decision to initiate the origin
verifications was presented to, and authorized by, the Audit Programming Committee; and
the application of Rule 2(a) was the result of internal deliberations and agreed to jointly by
the officials involved in the verification proceedings, including Mr. Orttizar Carcova.
Private parties are generally not privy to government agencies’ internal deliberations and
decision-making processes, but that does not make them “secretive,” in the sense that they
are covert or deliberately concealed from interested persons and the public. And SAT’s
decisions were ultimately subject to scrutiny by independent tribunals. There was no

mysterious hand that rocked the cradle.

As regards the administrative process itself, once the decision to initiate the verification
was taken by the Audit Programming Committee, SAT informed the U.S. customs
authorities and a few days later notified Vento.*“? Vento consented to the verification visit

in May 2003.** The visit took place as planned from 2-6 June 2003. In July 2003, SAT

and no verification visits took place.**! The Tribunal has already referred to the

administrative appeal and the judicial processes that followed.

NAFTA’s provisions on administrative proceedings and judicial review and appeal
contained in NAFTA Articles 510, 1804 and 1805 require that persons of another Party
that are directly affected by administrative proceedings —in the present case Vento (but
also AED)— are provided notice when a proceeding is initiated, including a description of
the proceeding, a statement of the legal authority under which the proceeding is initiated
and a general description of any issues in controversy; that such persons are afforded a
reasonable opportunity to present facts and arguments in support of their positions prior to
any final administrative action; that procedures are in accordance with domestic law; that
judicial, quasi-judicial or administrative tribunals are available for the purpose of the
prompt review and, where warranted, correction of final administrative actions; that such
tribunals be impartial and independent of the office or authority entrusted with
administrative enforcement and they do not have any substantial interest in the outcome of
the matter; that Vento (as well as AED) had a reasonable opportunity to support or defend

their respective positions; and that decisions were based on the evidence and submissions

of record and the record compiled by the administrative authority. As a factual matter, the

Tribunal finds that Mexico’s legal processes in the present case met such requirements.

As a consequence of the foregoing, the Tribunal rejects the Claimant’s claim of breach of

NAFTA Article 1105 for lack of due process.

(ii) Alleged arbitrariness

There is some overlap between the claims of arbitrariness and lack of due process because
according to Claimant issuing the so-called marching orders was arbitrary in itself and also
because they were kept secret from the Claimant.**? The Tribunal has already addressed
these two issues and rejects the claim that the Respondent acted arbitrarily for the same
reasons already given. In its Reply, the Claimant raised an alternative claim that the
Respondent arbitrarily denied the Joint Venture the right to use PROSEC in a manner
similar to Mexican manufacturers. The Tribunal has also addressed this matter. The

Tribunal rejects this claim as well as it relates to NAFTA Article 1105.

Even though the Claimant accepts that SAT’s application of Rule 2(a) was “seemingly
justified, or at least justifiable” under Mexican law, it contends that it was also legally open
to SAT not to have applied the rule and to simply accepted that motorcycles assembled by

Vento were NAFTA originating goods.*>

However, according to the Claimant, SAT
abused its discretionary authority “for the improper purpose of damaging Vento’s business
in Mexico” to protect the Mexican-based motorcycle industry.*** The Claimant expressed
that its “legitimate expectations rested on SAT officials performing their duties without

preference, for a proper purpose, and in conformity with due process.”?°5

Firstly, as demonstrated by the Respondent, AED had concluded on its own that Rule 2(a)
applied to its imports of engine parts and components into the United States, which allowed

it to benefit from duty free treatment.**° Even if, on advice of counsel, it later rectified that

action, reclassified the affected imports and paid the additional duties owed, AED and
Vento can hardly complain that a similar application by SAT of the very same rule was

arbitrary.

International trade and investment agreements are not a shield against domestic
competition. Given Vento’s penetration of the market, it is not surprising in the least that
its Mexican competitors would react and complain to the authorities. Foreigners are
entitled to due process, but international agreements are no safe-passage against domestic
legal actions, even if they are instigated by local competitors. The fact that authorities
respond to complaints filed by local businesses does not establish complicity and, as noted
in the preceding section, the Tribunal finds that in this case there was none. As noted, the
statements of the Respondent’s witnesses, Gabriel Oliver Garcia and José Ramon Jauregui
Tejeda, and the Claimant’s witness, José Alberto Orttizar Carcova, show that there was
nothing arbitrary in the decision to verify the origin of the imported motorcycles. Vento’s
motorcycles were comprised exclusively of Chinese parts and components. That was its
business model. When, according to Mr. Orttizar Carcova, members of the Mexican
industry acquired a Vento-branded motorcycle and took it apart, that is exactly what they
found. Their doubts about whether the motorcycles qualified as originating goods and
could properly benefit from NAFTA’s preferential tariff treatment were entirely
reasonable. This was sufficiently obvious that Mr. Orttizar Carcova asked AMIA officials
to submit a formal written complaint along with all the background, data and

information.**”

In fact, that the Joint Venture operations would be audited was by no means unexpected
either by the Joint Venture partners. The Joint Venture was a carefully planned strategy
and the Joint Venture partners assessed the potential benefits as well as the potential risks.
For instance, MotorBike was incorporated in a completely unconventional manner. For one
thing, its corporate life was limited to five years. A member of the Tribunal pointed this

out at the Hearing to witness Isaac Calder6n Birch. It is worth quoting the exchange:

357 Witness Statement of José Alberto Orttizar Carcova (5 March 2019), 4¥f 17-19.

104

321.

322.

First, something that really surprises me is that MotorBike was incorporated
for a five-year period, and I wanted to know why was the company created
for a period of five years. For a number of years I have worked in the field
of Corporate Law, and I have never seen a corporation like this. I have
incorporated many companies. I have been on boards of directors. I've been
a member of a board, and I have never seen a company that lasts less than
99 years. But I have never seen a company that was created to last five years.

THE WITNESS: That’s a question that I remember perfectly well from my

accountant. He said, and excuse me to all that are present, is that “nobody

reviews the dead” [...].°°8
The business was structured in the United States by splitting operations between Vento and
AED and keeping them legally and physically separate. All imports from China were in
the upstream company, AED, and all exports to Mexico in the downstream company,
Vento. The engines, after assembly from imported parts by AED were then sold
downstream to Vento as NAFTA originating goods. Because of the value of the engines as
compared to the rest of the motorcycle, the engines would basically be expected to confer
NAFTA origin to the whole motorcycle (meeting the 50% or 60% regional value content
depending on the methodology used), assuming that the assembled engines were accepted
to be NAFTA originating goods. This was clearly a management strategy that carried some

risks in the event of an origin verification by Mexican officials.

The Joint Venture partners may well have believed that Vento-branded motorcycles met
the NAFTA rules of origin,**? but under NAFTA Chapter 5 and applicable Mexican law,
that determination ultimately lies with SAT, the Mexican “customs administration”
referred to in NAFTA Article 506, which is subject to administrative and judicial review,
and it was indeed reviewed. As noted earlier, it has been definitively established in this
case that SAT’s application of Rule 2(a) was legally correct. The Claimant argues that the
opposite interpretation and result were also legally possible, but there is no evidence that
they were, beyond Gabriel Arriaga Calleja’s opinion, to which the Tribunal has already
referred. The United States could have challenged SAT’s application of Rule 2(a) under
the NAFTA, but it did not.

For these reasons, the Tribunal rejects the claim that the Respondent acted arbitrarily in

breach of NAFTA Article 1105.

 

Alleged discriminatory treatment

Finally, again based mainly on the witness statement of Gabriel Arriaga Callejas (and
Guillermo Massieu Urquiza, to which the Tribunal has already referred) the Claimant
argues that SAT’s conduct of the origin verifications and application of Rule 2(a) was
discriminatory because they targeted Vento. To the extent that the Claimant’s claim is
about nationality-based discrimination, the Tribunal has already dealt with it in the context

of NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1103.

Beyond that, Mr. Arriaga Callejas testified: “As far as I know, from the motorcycle
industry, Vento was the only enterprise audited at that time. From the previous audits in
which I intervened I have no knowledge that there has been any other audit to enterprises
with similar processes to Vento’s, whether they were foreign companies or companies in
Mexico. There were no audits to similar enterprises of the automotive or the motorcycle
industry that could be Vento’s competitors.”° Mr. Arriaga Callejas explained: “Usually,
audits were performed on different enterprises within the same industry usually on a
simultaneous basis. Thus, whenever one company was audited other enterprises of the
same industry were audited too [...] audits were always performed on a certain industry,

not on a specific enterprise.”*°!

However, NAFTA rules of origin and origin verification procedures evidently only apply
to imports that are claimed to be NAFTA originating goods. The evidence before this
Tribunal is that between 2001, when the Claimant began exporting motorcycles to Mexico,
and 2005, when both origin verifications had concluded, there were no other “enterprises
with similar processes to Vento’s.” César Nuifiez-Cazares was unaware of any other
producers or exporters in the United States that had the same or a similar business model.>

At the Hearing, Mr. Arriaga Callejas declared that prior to initiating an origin verification,

328.

SAT analyzed all imports of the goods in question, identified the main importers, obtained
a copy of the corresponding certificates of origin and determined who the producers and
exporters of the goods were. Asked how many other enterprises SAT had found that
assembled motorcycles in the United States and then exported them to Mexico during the
relevant period, he replied categorically that SAT never conducted that analysis but rather
focused exclusively on Vento.**? However, his testimony is contradicted by those of José
Alberto Orttizar Carcova and Daniel Ortiz Nashiki. Mr. Ortiz Nashiki testifies that,

instructed by Mr. Orttizar CArcova, he personally undertook that analysis.*

Even if Mexican manufacturers began importing motorcycle parts and components from
China, India or elsewhere later in time, their origin was not in question and, in any event,
it was irrelevant because they operated under PROSEC, a duty waiver program which was
available (if authorized) for imports from anywhere in the world, except from countries
with which Mexico had entered free trade agreements, such as the United States and
Canada under NAFTA. Obviously, the NAFTA origin rules and procedures were
inapplicable to companies based elsewhere than in the United States (or Canada). At the
Hearing, Mr. Arriaga Callejas admitted that, of course, Mexican producers were not
audited because they manufactured motorcycles in Mexico and therefore their origin was
not even at issue for customs purposes. In response to questions from the Tribunal, he
clarified that he did not mean to suggest that once an origin verification was launched, SAT
then verified all exporters, importers and all domestic and foreign producers. Rather, if the
origin verification involved imports from the United States, SAT focused only on

producers and exporters of the same type of goods in the United States.**

Regarding the application of Rule 2(a), the evidence shows that there were no other U.S.-
based assemblers or exporters, which is dispositive. Exports of goods assembled
exclusively from imported non-originating materials overall do not appear to have been

very common either. At the Hearing, Mr. Arriaga Callejas referred to centrifugal pumps

and certain textile products*°

—although the Tribunal doubts that cutting, gluing and
similar operations with fabrics would qualify as assembly— and the Claimant referred to
a case involving flat screen TVs in 2015 (which, given the timeframe, is probably not that
relevant).*°’ Finally, the Tribunal has already addressed the non-application of Rule 2(a)

to the Mexican manufacturers in the context of the NAFTA Article 1102 and 1103 claims.

For these reasons, the Tribunal rejects the claim that the Respondent’s actions were

discriminatory in breach of NAFTA Article 1105.

The Tribunal rejects all other claims of breach of NAFTA Article 1105. In light of this, it
has become unnecessary to resolve the Respondent’s objection to jurisdiction ratione

temporis.

COSTS

Claimant’s Cost Submissions

In its submission on costs of 13 March 2019, the Claimant argues that the Respondent
should bear the total arbitration costs incurred by Claimant, including legal fees and
expenses totaling US$8,540,996.00, broken down as follows (i) legal fees
(US$7,48 1,238.00), (ii) Expert witnesses’ and consultants’ fees (US$556,215.00), (iii)
other expenses (US$103,543.00), and (iv) advances toward the Tribunal’s fees and
expenses, and ICSID’s administrative fees (US$400,000). *%

The Claimant argues that such costs are justified and appropriate given the scope and

complexity of issues put in dispute by Respondent and add that the Respondent’s “various
obstructionist tactics” and “its procedural misconduct throughout this proceeding also

provides an additional basis to award Claimant its costs.”

In its submission on costs of 13 March 2019, the Respondent submits that the Claimant
should bear all the costs and expenses of these proceedings, including the Respondent’s
legal fees and expenses totaling US$1,587,580.56, broken down as follows: (i) legal fees
and expenses of external legal counsel (US$1,057,459.58), (ii) internal legal expenses

advances toward the Tribunal’s fees and expenses, and ICSID’s administrative fees

(US$375,000).3”

The Respondent argues that the Claimant’s abusive conduct in the context of this dispute,
“increased the complexity of this arbitration and the burden imposed on the
Respondent.”*?! (Tribunal’s translation). In particular, the Respondent states that the
Claimant made a series of allegations that it knew, or should have known, were incorrect,
presented contradictory claims, introduced new claims in its Reply Memorial, abandoned
its claims on behalf of MotorBike and Mototransp and tried to present new evidence during

2

the Hearing.*”? The Respondent requests an order from the Tribunal holding Vento,

Unless the Parties otherwise agree, under Article 58 of the ICSID Additional Facility Rules,
the Tribunal has discretion in deciding “how and by whom the expenses and charges of the
Secretariat and the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceeding shall
be borne.” This provision gives the Tribunal discretion to allocate all costs of the
arbitration, including attorney’s fees and other costs, between the Parties as it deems

appropriate.

The costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, ICSID’s

administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in US$):

Arbitrators’ fees and expenses

Andrés Rigo Sureda 97,735.00
David Gantz 66,028.65
Hugo Perezcano 205,559.73
ICSID’s administrative fees 126,000.00
Direct expenses 132,457.20
Total 627,780.58

The above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in equal parts.”

As a result, each Party’s share of the costs of arbitration amounts to US$313,890.29.

In determining the allocation of costs, the Tribunal has considered all of the circumstances
of the present arbitration. The Respondent has prevailed but not entirely. The Respondent
raised objections to admissibility and jurisdiction and only prevailed in the objection
related to loans. In respect of the Respondent’s objection ratione temporis, the Tribunal
has ultimately decided on the merits and dismissed the claims. Based on these
considerations, the Tribunal awards the Respondent 50% of its legal fees and expenses and
60% of the arbitration costs. Accordingly, the Tribunal orders the Claimant to pay the
Respondent the amount of US$188,334.17 for the expended portion of the Respondent’s
advances to ICSID and US$793,790.28 to cover Respondent’s legal and expert fees and

administrative expenses.

Since the Tribunal awards to the Respondent part of its costs, it remains for the Tribunal to
address the Respondent’s request that the Tribunal hold Vento, MotorBike and Mototransp
jointly liable for the Respondent’ s costs. In this respect, the Tribunal recalls that MotorBike

and Mototransp are not parties to these proceedings, and under NAFTA Article 1136, this

34 The remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.

Award has binding force only between “the disputing parties and in respect of the particular

case.” Therefore, the Tribunal denies the request.

AWARD

For the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides as follows:

a.

To dismiss the objections to admissibility.

. To reject the jurisdictional objection ratione materiae in respect of the Joint

Venture and declare that the Joint Venture qualified as an investment.

To declare that no investment was made in the form of loans under NAFTA
Chapter 11 and uphold the jurisdictional objection ratione materiae in this

respect.

. To reject the jurisdictional objection ratione personae.

To declare that the Respondent did not breach its obligations under NAFTA and

dismiss the claims on the merits.

To award the Respondent US$982,124.45 representing 50% of its legal fees and
expenses and 60% of the arbitration costs. Such amount shall be payable by the

Claimant no later than 30 days after the date of issuance of this Award.

. To deny the Respondent’s request that the Tribunal hold Vento, MotorBike and

Mototransp jointly liable for the Respondent’s arbitration costs.

. To dismiss all other claims.
