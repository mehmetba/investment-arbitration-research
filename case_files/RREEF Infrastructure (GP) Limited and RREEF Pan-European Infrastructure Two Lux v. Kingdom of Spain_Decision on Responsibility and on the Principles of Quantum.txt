VIII. THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION 192

I. INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

This case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”) on the basis of the Energy Charter Treaty
which entered into force on 16 April 1998 (the “ECT” or “Treaty”) and the Convention on
the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States of 18

March 1965, which entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the “ICSID Convention”).

The Claimants are RREEF Infrastructure (G.P.) Limited (“RREEF Infra” or the “First
Claimant”) and RREEF Pan-European Infrastructure Two Lux S.a r.l. (“RREEF Pan-

European Two” or the “Second Claimant’), jointly referred as “the Claimants” or “RREEF.”

RREEF Infra is a private limited liability company incorporated in 2005 under the laws of
Jersey. RREEF Pan-European Two is a private limited liability company (Société a

responsabilité limitée) incorporated in 2006 under the laws of Luxembourg.

As set forth under the Tribunal’s Decision on Jurisdiction, RREEF specialises in
infrastructure investments, with experience across different sectors, including the power
generation sector. RREEF is a member of the Deutsche Bank Group, and in 2013, RREEF
was re-branded and now operates together with Deutsche Bank’s asset and wealth

management divisions, under the unified name Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management.

The First Claimant is the general partner of RREEF Pan-European Infrastructure Fund L.P.
(“PEIF”). PEIF holds 100% of the share capital in RREEF Pan-European Infrastructure Lux
§.a rl. (SRREEF Pan-European”) and an indirect 100% equity stake, through RREEF Pan-

European, in the Second Claimant.

The Respondent is the Kingdom of Spain (“‘Spain” or “the Respondent”).

The Claimants and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the “Parties”. The Parties’

representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).

This dispute relates to renewable energy generation installations in Spain.

IL. OVERVIEW OF THE DISPUTE AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF

At its core, the dispute concerns allegations by the Claimants that the Respondent, through
acts and omissions of its organs, agencies and entities, has caused substantial losses to the
Claimants’ investment in the Spanish Electricity System (“SES”) and violated its
international obligations under the ECT. The SES comprises power generations,
transportation, distribution and marketing of electrical energy. This case relates to power

generation through renewable energy, and in particular, wind and CSP.

According to the Claimants, they invested in Spain’s Renewable Energy power generation
sector (“RE”) attracted by the stable economic regime available to investors, governed,
among others, by Royal Decree 661/2007, Royal Decree Law 6/2009 and Royal Decree
1614/2010. Thereafter, Spain modified the regulatory framework for the SES, by adopting a
series of measures that changed the conditions for the investors’ remuneration of their
investments in the wind and Concentrated Solar Power (“CSP”) sectors. These measures
included Law 15/2012, RDL 2/2013, RDL 9/2013, Law 24/2013, RD 413/2014 and the
Ministerial Order IET/1882/2014 of 14 October 2014, jointly referred to hereinafter as the

“disputed measures”.

According to the Claimants, such modifications constitute breaches of the Respondent’s
obligations under Article 10(1) of the ECT to provide Fair and Equitable Treatment and to
guarantee its commitments under the umbrella clause embodied in the last subparagraph of
Article 10(1) of the ECT, entitling the Claimants to full restitution under the Treaty and
international law. They further claim compensation for all losses suffered as a result of the

Respondent’s breaches. In particular, the Claimants request that the Tribunal:
“ (a) Declar[e] that Spain has breached Article 10(1) of the ECT; and
(b) Order{] that Spain:
(i) provide full restitution to the Claimants by re-establishing the
situation which existed prior to Spain’s breaches of the ECT,

together with compensation for all losses suffered before restitution;
or

12. The Respondent in turn holds that the modifications to the SES were adopted in compliance
with its international obligations, including the Treaty. For the Respondent, the regulatory
changes were necessary to correct situations of over remunerations, and ensure the economic
sustainability of the SES, affected among others, by the Tariff Deficit. The disputed measures
sought to guarantee a reasonable rate of return in the context of a sustainable SEE. The
Respondent also ascertains that the Spanish regulatory framework did not incorporate a
stabilization “clause” guaranteeing the non-modification of the regime. Instead, the

Claimants were aware that their investments’ remuneration method was subject to regulatory

(ii) pay the Claimants compensation for all losses suffered as a result
of Spain’s breaches of the ECT; and

in any event:

(iii) pay the Claimants pre-award interest at a rate of 2.07%
compounded monthly; and

(iv)pay post-award interest, compounded monthly at a rate to be
determined by the Tribunal on the amounts awarded until full
payment thereof; and

(v) pay the Claimants the costs of this arbitration on a full-indemnity
basis, including all expenses that the Claimants have incurred or will
incur in respect of the fees and expenses of the arbitrators, ICSID,
legal counsel, experts and consultants; and

(vi) any such other and further relief that the Tribunal shall deem just
and proper. !

and that:
The Tribunal [] dismiss (i) Spain’s claim concerning the installed capacity

of the CSP Plants; and (ii) the remaining objection as to jurisdiction (the
Tax Objection).””

changes.

' CM, para. 584; CR, para. 816.

2CR, para. 816.

13. On this basis, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal:

“a) Declare its lack of jurisdiction to hear the claim concerning an alleged
infringement by the Kingdom of Spain of Article 10 (1) of the EC Treaty
by introducing the Tax on the Value of Electric Power Production (IVPEE)
By Act 15/2012.

b) Dismiss all the claims of the Claimant regarding the other contested
measures, since the Kingdom of Spain has not in any way failed to comply
with the ECT, in accordance with what is stated in Sections (A) y (B) of
section II and III of this Statement.

c) Subsidiarily, all claims for compensation of the Claimant should be
dismissed as they are not entitled to compensation in accordance with
Section IV of this Statement and

d) Order that the Claimant pays all costs and expenses arising from this
arbitration, including administrative expenses and the fees of the Court’s
Arbitrators, as well as the fees of the legal representation of the Kingdom
of Spain, its experts and advisers, and any other costs or expenses that may
have incurred, all of which include a reasonable interest rate from the date
these costs are incurred until the date of their actual payment.”*

III. | PROCEDURAL HISTORY

14. On 22 October 2013, ICSID received a request for arbitration from RREEF Infrastructure
(G.P.) Limited and RREEF Pan-European Infrastructure Two Lux S.a r.l. against the
Kingdom of Spain.

15. The Request was filed on the basis of Article 26(4)(a)(i) of the Energy Charter Treaty (the
“ECT”) dated 17 December 1994, which entered into force on 16 April 1998 for
Luxembourg, the United Kingdom and the Kingdom of Spain, Article 36 of the ICSID
Convention, and Article 1 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation

and Arbitration Proceeding (the “ICSID Institution Rules”).

16. On 22 November 2013, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance
with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration.

23.

In the absence of an agreement between the Parties on the method of constituting the
Tribunal, the Tribunal was constituted in accordance with Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID

Convention.

The Tribunal is composed of Professor Alain Pellet, a national of France, President,
appointed by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council in accordance with Article
38 of the ICSID Convention; Professor Robert Volterra, a national of Canada, appointed by
the Claimants; and Professor Pedro Nikken, a national of Venezuela, appointed by the

Respondent.

On 31 July 2014, the Secretary-General notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had
accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been
constituted on that date in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for
Arbitration Proceedings (“Arbitration Rules”). Ms. Natalf Sequeira, ICSID Legal Counsel,

was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.

In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session with the

Parties on 29 September 2014 in Paris.

On 21 October 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. | setting forth the matters
discussed at the first session, including the procedural timetable and the agreement that the
proceedings were to be conducted in accordance with the ICSID Arbitration Rules in force

as of April 10, 2006.

On 14 November 2014, the European Commission filed an Application for leave to intervene

as non-disputing party pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2).

On 21 November 2014, the Claimants filed their Memorial on the Merits, accompanied by

= Witness Statements of:
- Mauricio Bolajia dated 20 November 2014,
- Harold D’Hauteville dated 19 November 2014,

= Legal Authorities CL-0001 to CL-0090;

= Appendix 1 — Table of Defined Terms,
= Appendix 2 — Dramatis Personae.
On 9 January 2015, the Respondent filed a request to bifurcate the proceedings. On 23

January 2015, the Claimants filed observations on the Respondent’s request.

On 5 February 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 concerning the European
Commission’s Application to file a written submission as a non-disputing party pursuant to
ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2), after giving each party an opportunity to file observations.
The Tribunal found that “that the European Commission’s Application for leave to intervene

[was] inadmissible”.

On 7 February 2015, the Tribunal granted the Respondent’s request for bifurcation of the
proceedings. Accordingly, the Respondent’s objections to jurisdiction would be addressed as

a preliminary question and suspended the proceedings on the merits.

On 18 February 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, setting forth the reasoning

for its decision on bifurcation.

On 4 March 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 establishing a new procedural

calendar to address the Respondent’s objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.

On 19 June 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 deciding on the Parties’

requests for document production.

On 7 July 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 concerning a request for

confidentiality of certain documents to be produced by the Parties.

31.

32.

33.

34.

On 14 January 2016, after receiving the Parties’ observations, the Tribunal issued Procedural
Order No. 7 rejecting the European Commission’s second application to intervene as a non-

disputing party, which had been filed on 9 December 2015.

On 7 March 2016, the Tribunal issued a decision on the Respondent’s jurisdictional

objections.

On 24 March 2016, the Tribunal fixed the procedural calendar for the merits phase.

On 6 June 2016, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Jurisdiction setting forth the reasoning
for its determination of 7 March 2016 (the “Decision on Jurisdiction”). The Decision on
Jurisdiction is incorporated to this Decision and constitutes integral part hereof. In its

Decision, the Tribunal decided that:

“(1) The Tribunal takes note of the Claimants’ abandonment of their claim
concerning the modification of the Excise Duties Act of 28 December 1992
(“Excise Duties Act’) by Article 28 of Act 15/2012.

(2) The Respondent’s objection based on Article 21 ECT is joined to the
merits. This decision does not prejudge any position of the Tribunal as to
the admissibility of this objection as a preliminary issue or a question of
substance.

(3) The questions of the composition and value of the compensable rights
allegedly breached by the Respondent are joined to the merits.

(4) All other objections are rejected and the Tribunal has jurisdiction for
deciding on the dispute submitted by RREEF Infrastructure (G.P.) Limited
and RREEF Pan-European Infrastructure Two Lux S.a r.l. on 18 October
2013, subject to paragraph 232 (1) above.

(5) The submissions of the Claimants concerning the measures adopted
after their Request for Arbitration are admissible and the Tribunal can
exercise jurisdiction over them.

(6) The Tribunal will take the necessary steps for the continuation of the
proceedings toward the merits phase.

(7) The decision regarding the costs of arbitration is deferred to the second
phase of the arbitration on the merits.”

On 29 July 2016, the Parties filed a request for production of documents. On 12 August 2016,
the Parties filed responses and objections to the request for production of documents. On 2
September 2016, the Parties filed applications to the Tribunal to decide on the production of

documents.

On 21 September 2016, ICSID informed the Parties and the Tribunal that, due to a
reorganization of the Centre’s workload, Ms. Mairée Uran Bidegain, ICSID Team

Leader/Legal Counsel, would act as Secretary of the Tribunal.

IV. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

The Tribunal provides below a general overview of the factual background that has led to
this dispute, to the extent it is substantiated and is material for the determinations in this
Decision. In doing so, it will adopt a chronological timeline when possible, referring to the
evidence presented by the Parties and describing the Parties’ positions with regard to disputed

facts.

This section is not intended to be an exhaustive description of all facts underlying this
dispute. Some facts will also be addressed, to the extent relevant or useful, in the context of
the Tribunal’s legal analysis of the issues in dispute. The Tribunal has nonetheless considered

the evidence in full, as adduced by the Parties in this arbitration.

On the basis of the materials adduced by the Parties, the Tribunal describes below: (A) the
SES and the applicable regulatory framework, and (B) the Claimants’ investments in the

Respondent.

A. THE SPANISH ELECTRICITY SYSTEM
(a) Spain’s Energy Policy and the Relevant International Framework

87. In 1992, Spain signed the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(“UNFCCC’”).° In 1998 the European Union and Spain, as a Member State, signed the 1997
Kyoto Protocol, an international instrument negotiated to implement the UNFCCC.’ Under
this international framework, Spain, with many other nations, committed to a reduction of
greenhouse emissions, through among others, the allocation of important resources to that

effect.

88. To participate fully in this international effort to reduce greenhouse emissions, the European
Union (“EU”) adopted Directive 2001/77/EC “on the promotion of electricity produced from
renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market” (“2001 Directive”).’ The 2001
Directive set obligations for the EU Member States, including the obligation to set indicative
targets for future consumption of electricity produced from renewable energy sources.’ The
Respondent’s national indicative targets “for the contribution of electricity produced from
renewable energy sources to gross electricity consumption by 2010” was 29.4%.'° The

Directive also recognized that Member States may use support schemes to contribute to the

© United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, 1771 United Nations Treaty Series 107; 31 International
Legal Materials 849 (1992), 9 May 1992 (entered into force on 9 May 1992, and for Spain in 1994) (UNFCCC) (C-18).
7 Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, United Nations Document
FCCC/CP/1997/7/Add.1, Dec. 10, 1997; (entered into force on 16 February 2005 for the EU and Spain) (C-19). In the
context of the negotiations of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the EU presented a White Paper. (See Communication from the
Commission, “Energy for the Future: Renewable Sources of Energy”, White Paper for a Community Strategy and Action
Plan, COM (97) 26 November 1997 (“EU 1997 White Paper”) (C-50).

8 The 2001 Directive reflected global indicative targets of 12% of gross national energy consumption by 2010 and of
22,1% indicative share of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in total Community electricity
consumption by 2010, that had been recorded in the EU 1997 White Paper. Directive 2001/77/EC of the European
Parliament and of the Council, on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal
electricity market, 27 September 2001 (published on 27 October 2001) (“Directive 2001/77/EC”) (C-20) (R-45), Art.

achievement of national indicative targets and promote the use of renewable energy

resources. !!

It is undisputed between the Parties that, compared to conventional power generation
technologies, RE projects are not cost-competitive, at either the whole sale or retail level.!*
Moreover, renewable energy investments are, at the outset capital-intensive, and the ongoing

operating costs are relatively low.'

For this and other reasons, to attract investments, many States put in place regulatory
incentives to level the playing field amongst energy investors in the conventional and the
renewable energy sector. This includes for example, the Feed-in-Tariff (“FIT”) mechanism,
implemented in Spain to, among others, achieve the “indicative targets” referred to in
paragraph 88 above and at issue in this arbitration. The FIT can take the form of a fixed tariff
(set at a rate above normal electricity market prices) or a premium (paid on top of market
prices for the sale of each unit, or kilowatt hour (kWh) of energy produced and fed into the

power grid).'*

In August 2005, and considering, among others, its obligations under the international
instruments mentioned above, Spain approved its 2005-2010 the Plan de Energias
Renovables (“PER” by its Spanish acronym) (Renewable Energy Plan).'° The PER was
prepared by the Instituto para la Diversificacién y Ahorro de la Energia (“IDAE”) and
constituted an amendment to the 2000-2010 Renewable Energy Promotion Plan (““PFER” by

its Spanish acronym).'© Like the PFER, the PER established a series of targets by
technological area, to promote the use of renewable energy sources and were an indication
of the future development of the different renewable technologies. Thus, the PER contained
the underlying economic data used by the government to determine its regulatory framework.
The purpose of the renewable planning documents and their place in the Respondent’s
regulatory process is explained as follows by one of the Claimants’ advisors at the time of

the making of the investments:

“In order to comply with the Kyoto target and the EU 202020 scheme, the
Spanish Government drafts medium to long term planning documents (5 to
10 years) aimed at identifying the technologies that have the potential (both
technical and economic) to contribute significantly to achieving the
aforementioned targets. The renewable energy planning documents - Plan
de Energias Renovables (PER) - set out the specific growth projections for
each technology and breaks it down by autonomous region. Based on the
documents, the Government sets a tariff (published in the form of a Royal
Decree) for each technology depending on the level of growth that is
required from each technology.

Renewable energy planning documents are the best indicators of the future
development of the different renewable technologies”. !”

92. The PER indicated that there had been an important growth on energy consumption, “a
significant increase, although insufficient to achieve the ambitious targets that had been set.
At end-2004, an accumulated fulfilment of 28.4% had been achieved on the global target of

increasing renewable sources, anticipated for 2010.” '*

‘© The PER was a revision to the 2000-2010 Renewable Energy Promotion Plan (“PFER”) approved in Spain on 30
December 1999. The PFER established a series of targets by technological area that would enable renewable energy
sources help Spain meet at least 12% of total primary energy demand by 2010 (i.e., the global indicative target) and
assessed the public funds needed to implement the required promotion plan Spain. Under the PFER, Spain appears to
have envisaged that to reach its targets for CSP, 10% of the investment would come from subsidies, 20% would come
from promoters and 70% from “outside financing”. Plan for the Promotion of Renewable Energies 2000-2010, December

The PER further acknowledged that to boost investments in RE, economic profitability of
the investments and access to finance, were important components.'? With regard to the
profitability or return on investments of the “project types” the PER estimated a “Internal
Rate of Return (IRR), measured in current currency values and for every project type” at

“around 7%, with own resources (prior to funding) and post-tax.”

With regard to the access to finance, the PER estimated that 77.1 % of the overall financing
required for its implementation would be debt finance (18.198 billion), while public aid and
equity investment would be the source for the remaining 2.9% (680,939) and 20% (4.720
billion), respectively.” The financing needs were calculated taking into consideration the
different technologies, as well as “the technical and economic parameters for each one of
them, giving rise to the formulation of corresponding project types by technologies.”?! In

addition, with regard to the project types, the PER indicated that:

“4.5 Project types by technology

Starting from the proposed energy goals, we have determined the funding
needs for every technology based on its profitability, defining a number of
project types for our calculation model.

These project types are characterised by technical parameters related to their
size, equivalent working hours, cost per unit, periods of operation, service
life, operating and maintenance costs and final sale prices per unit of energy.
Furthermore, we have applied a number of assumptions on funding and a
series of financial aids or measures designed according to the requirements
of every technology.

Below are the files for each one of the project types considered in the
different technological sectors and whose figures have served as the basis
for the financial and economic calculations of the Plan for the 2005-2010
period.”

95. Against this background, Spain made efforts to encourage investments in RE by promoting
itself as an attractive destination for renewable energy investments.”* These efforts appear to
have been carried out by the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Commerce (the “Ministry’’),
in conjunction with a State-owned company for the Promotion and Attraction of Foreign

Investment, known as InvestInSpain.”*

96. On 23 April 2009, the EU approved Directive 2009/28/EC on the promotion of the use of
energy from renewable sources (the “2009 Directive”).”> Articles 3(1) and (3)(4) of the 2009
Directive set a new target whereby by 2020 the European Community would seek to obtain
20% (instead of 12%) of its total gross final energy consumption requirements from
renewable sources and a minimum target of 10% for each Member State. Under Article 4 of
the 2009 Directive, each Member State was required to adopt a National Action Plan for the

implementation of the Directive and its targets (or PANER for its Spanish acronym).

97. On 30 June 2010, Spain adopted its PANER and confirmed a target of 20% of gross final
energy demand being generated through renewable sources by 2020.7° The PANER

indicated, in relevant part:

“The economic framework, currently implemented by Royal Decree
661/2007 of 25 May 2007 regulating electrical energy production under the
Special Regime, and Order ITC/3519/2009 of 28 December 2009 reviewing
access fees as from 01 January 2010 along with the tariffs and premiums
corresponding to special regime installations, provide for electricity
generation remuneration levels that afford a reasonable return on
investment. In determining those levels, account is taken of the specific
technical and economic aspects of each technology, installed capacity and

Review of remuneration

Royal Decree 661/2007 provides for reviews of remuneration amounts
every four years, which may be modified on the basis of technological
developments within the sectors, market behaviour, degree of compliance
with renewable energy targets, percentage of demand covered by special
regime facilities and their effect on the technical and economic management
of the system, while always guaranteeing reasonable rates of return. In any
event, these reviews take account of cost trends associated with each
technology with three objectives in mind: to see that renewable
technologies become as competitive as possible with Ordinary Regime
generation, to foster a technological development balance and to see that
the remunerative scheme moves in the direction of minimising socio-
economic and environmental costs.

[J

Future developments in support schemes for electricity generation
from renewable energies

Electrical energy production under the special procedure is founded on
three basic principles, namely legal certainty, feasibility and regulatory
stability.

Any present or future economic remuneration system to support the
generation of electricity from renewable sources will be based on the
aforementioned principles, and the necessary mechanisms will be devised
to dovetail technological improvements and market developments with
incentives for electricity generation from renewable sources in order to
meet the targets and objectives by the established deadlines.

Technical parameters and investment costs incurred will be considered in
determining remuneration with a view to providing a reasonable rate of
return referenced to the cost of money on the capital market in accordance
with the provisions of the Electricity Sector Act.

Also, effective administrative supervision is required to assure that gains
from the development of these technologies in terms of relative cost
competitiveness are passed on to society, thus minimising the speculative
tisks posed in the past by excessive rates of return, which not only hurts
consumers but is also damaging to the industry in general in terms of the
perception people have of it. Therefore, it will be necessary to devise
sufficiently flexible and transparent systems that permit the issue and

reception of economic and market signals so as to minimise the risks
associated with investment and its remuneration and those caused by
fluctuations in the energy markets.”?”

98. From 2010 onwards, there was a drop in electricity demand.”8 According to the Respondent,
SEE revenues at that time came exclusively from the Spanish consumer. Accordingly, the
reduction in demand resulted in a substantial reduction in income available to the SEE to
address its costs, including the remunerations regimes provided under the FIT model, as

subsidies.”

99. By the end of 2011, the electricity deficit represented over EUR 3,000 million and an
accumulated tariff debt of more than USD 22 billion and electricity tariff for consumers were

some of the highest in Europe.*? That amount had reached 26 billion by 2013.7!

100. According to the Respondent, relying on sources unverified by the Tribunal but uncontested
by Claimants, the price of electric bills for consumers has increased considerably in the past
10-15 years: a consumer paid on their electric bill EUR 370 per year in 2003 and went on to
pay in 2012 a total of EUR 669. Between 2007 and 2014, the electricity in a household in
Spain has increased by 61.55% while the increase in price for the European Union reached
21.99%.”

On 7 March 2012, the CNE issued report 2/2012, recommending certain measures to address
the evolution of the tariff deficit and ensure the economic and financial stability of the

Electricity System, at the request of the Ministry of Energy.

On 20 July 2012, Spain signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the European Union,
regarding among others, Spain’s 2012-2015 financial stability and the adoption of certain
measures of macroeconomic control. Under this MoU Spain committed to “address the

electricity tariff deficit in a comprehensive way.”**

(b) The National Legal and Regulatory Framework

In light of Spain’s Energy policy and the international framework set forth above, the
Respondent adopted a series of measures, applicable to the RE sector in Spain. Some of those
measures are at issue in this proceeding and thus will be described in some detail below in
two parts. First, the Tribunal provides a non-exhaustive list of the regulatory measures
adopted by the Respondent prior to the enactment of the disputed measures (i). Second, the
Tribunal provides a short description of the disputed measures, to the extent relevant to its

analysis (ii).

Before doing so, the Tribunal describes herein its understanding of the hierarchical
relationship between the norms described below, as this may prove relevant to its analysis of
the Claimants’ claims, in Section VI below.

- Under the Spanish Legal System, the 1978 Spanish Constitution is supreme.

- Subordinated to the Constitution are the Laws, which are either Organic (approved by
Congress by absolute majority and concern certain matters set forth in the Constitution
not relevant for this dispute) or Ordinary (approved by simple majority and relating to all

other matters). Of the same rank as the Laws are Royal-Decree-Laws (“RDL”). These

National Energy Commission of 2012 states that the debt of the system amounted on 6 March 2012 to EUR 21,812
million. National Energy Commission, “Report on the Spanish energy sector”, 7 March 2012 (R-147), p. 8.

are regulations that may be enacted by the executive branch in situations of extraordinary

need or urgency, and are subject to parliamentary validation.

- Subordinated to the Laws and RDLs, are the Royal-Decrees (“RD”). RD implement
matters regulated by Law (or by RDL). They emanate from the executive power, are
inferior in rank to Laws and may not contravene the terms of the Law they seek to

implement, and must be interpreted within the context of the Law being implemented.

- Finally, the Spanish legal system includes Ministerial Orders, emanating from one or
more ministries, and further below are Resolutions, emanating from lower administrative

bodies, relating to technical issues.*°
I. The Initial Measures

105. ©On27 November 1997, Spain adopted Law 54/1997 (the “1997 Electricity Law’), reforming
the framework of the electricity sector in Spain, which had been, until that point, a
government priced-controlled regulated system.*© The 1997 Electricity Law deregulated the
transmission, distribution, generation and supply of electricity, introducing competition in

some of these activities with the aim of enhancing the efficiency of the SEE.

106. With respect to electricity generation, a 1994 Law had established a distinction between two
regulatory remuneration regimes. First, the Ordinary Regime, applicable to conventional
power generators, such as coal-fired power plants. Second, a Special Regime applicable to
generators producing energy from other sources.*” The 1997 Electricity Law continued with

this distinction and determined that all generators “with an installed power capacity that does

Claimants.

36 Law 54/1997, on the Electric Power Sector, 27 November 1997 (published on 28 November 1997) (‘1997 Electricity
Law”) (C-35) (R-9). Claimants also exhibited a 2008 version of the 1997 Electricity Law (version as of 1 January 2008)
(C-36).

57 Law 40/1994, on regulation of the National Electricity System, 30 December 1994 (published on 31 December 1994)
(R-92), Art. 21 (Ordinary Regime) and Art. 26 (Special Regime). See also Royal Decree 2366/1994, on the production
of electrical energy by hydraulic and cogeneration facilities, and other facilities supplied by resources or sources of
renewable energy, 9 December 1994 (R-237), regulating the Special Regime.

26

not exceed SOMW,” producing electricity from “the non-consumable renewable energy”
shall be subject to the Special Regime.** Under the Ordinary Regime, remuneration derived
from the wholesale market price of electricity. Under the Special Regime, generators were
subsidized with a premium above the wholesale market price. Article 30(4) of the 1997

Electricity Law read:

“In order to establish premium quotas the following factors shall be
considered: the tension level of delivery to the grid, the actual contribution
to the improvement of the environment, the saving on primary energy and
energy efficiency as well as the costs incurred from investment, in order
that reasonable remunerative tariffs may be established related to the cost
in assets on the capital market.”*?

107. The 1997 Electricity Law, also determined that all energy generators, under both the
Ordinary and the Special Regime, needed to be registered before a Registro Administrativo
de Instalaciones de Produccién de Energia Eléctrica (“RAIPRE”), created under Article
21(4) of the Law. In addition, the application of the Special Regime was subject to the

approval of the authorities of the relevant Autonomous Region in Spain.

108. The 1997 Electricity Law was implemented through a series of Royal Decrees, including

Royal Decree 2818/1998 of 23 December 1998 (“RD 2818/1998”), Royal Decree 436/2004

of 12 March 2004 (“RD 436/2004”), and Royal Decree 661/2007 (“RD 661/2007”) of 25

May 2007, which further defined the remuneration scheme for generators qualifying for the
Special Regime under Article 27 of the 1997 Electricity Law. In particular:

e RD 2818/1998, recognized that generators qualifying under the Special Regime had the

right to be connected to and to supply electricity to the national grid.“° It also fixed the

mechanism to calculate the premium*! which was subject to revisions every four years.*”

Special Regime generators, including reporting obligations (Art. 30(1)), and recognized certain rights, including priority
of dispatch of energy produced from renewable energy (Art. 30(2)(a)).

27

This Royal Decree also confirmed that renewables needed to register on a subsection of

the administrative register created by the 1997 Electricity Law.

e RD 436/2004, further defined the FIT Regime by repealing RD 2818/1998 and setting
forth a new methodology to calculate the economic regime for electric power generation
under the Special Regime. Pursuant to RD 436/2004, qualifying installations could
choose between a regulated fix tariff or a premium payment per kWh of energy produced
over and above the wholesale market price.*? The values of the fixed tariff and the
premium were calculated by reference to a percentage of the tarifa eléctrica media o de
referencia (average rate or reference rate) fixed by the government, subject to change on
an annual basis and tied to market fluctuations.“ Moreover, the levels of the regulated
tariff and premium varied depending on the type of technology (i.e., renewable energies,
biomass or other kind of bio fuel). Pursuant to RD 436/2004 all incentives and
supplements provided under Section 3 of RD 436/2004, “shall apply solely to the plants
that commence operating subsequent to the date of the entry into force referred to in the
paragraph above and shall not have a backdated effect on any previous tariffs and

premiums.”45

e RD 661/2007, superseded RD 436/2004, and implemented the amendments to the 1997
Electricity Law, ordered by Royal Decree Law 7/2006 (as explained below). In
accordance with PER 2005-2010, RD 661/2007 provided for increased installed capacity
targets for the different technologies, including a target of 500 MW for CSP and 20,155

for wind technologies.*° The Preamble underscored certain goals:

“Tn view of the behaviour of the prices in the market, where certain variables
which were not considered in the cited compensation system for the special
regime have, over recent times, acquired greater importance, the economic
circumstances established by Royal Decree 436/2004, of 12 March, make

it necessary to modify the compensation system and de-link it from the
Mean Electricity Tariff, or Reference Tariff, which has been used to date.
[..]

The economic framework established in the present Royal Decree develops
the principles provided in Law 54/1997, of 27 November, on the Electricity
Sector, guaranteeing the owners of facilities under the special regime a
reasonable return on their investments, and the consumers of electricity an
assignment of the costs attributable to the electricity system which is also
reasonable, although incentives are provided to playing a part in this market
since it is considered that in this manner lower government intervention will
be achieved in the setting of prices, together with better, more efficient,
attribution of the costs of the system, particularly in respect of the handling
of diversions and the provisions of supplementary services.”*”

Given the importance of this Royal Decree to the issue here at stake, paragraphs 109 to 114

below further explain the content of this regulation.

109. With regard to the incentives, RD 661/2007, maintained the generators’ option of choosing
between a Fixed Tariff and a Premium on an annual basis,** but it also established limits on
the maximums and minimums for such Premiums (cap and floor),*? and expressed the tariffs
in actual amounts per kWh, adjusted for inflation on a yearly basis in accordance with the
consumer price index.°° According to the Respondent, the level of these tariffs and
remunerations schemes were set forth on the basis of the calculations set forth on the PER

2005-2010.°!

110. In addition, RD 661/2007, provided for the possibility to combine solar energy and fossil
fuels, by permitting qualifying CSP installations subject to the Special Regime to employ
equipment which uses natural gas. It set a limit on the percentage of fuel that could be used,

whether under the Fixed-tariff option (up to 12% of the annual production could be electricity

generated with fuel) or the Premium option (limit set to 15%).*?

Articles 4 to 15 further defined the administrative requirements to be included in the Special
Regime and confirmed the obligation to be registered under the RAIPRE before the
authorities of the Autonomous Communities where the plant was located. The RAIPRE

registration, consisted of two phases: an initial registration and a final registration.**

Article 17 enunciated the rights of producers under the Special Regime to receive either fixed
tariffs or premiums, depending on their choice, subject to obtaining a final RAPIRE

registration before the final dates set forth in Article 22.

For its part, Article 22 indicated that once certain RE technologies, including CSP and wind
technologies, reached 85% of Spain’s target capacity, a time limit of at least 12 months would
be fixed within which installations would need to obtain its RAIPRE registration to enjoy the
benefit of RD 661/2007’s economic regime. Thereafter, new installations would be unable

to access the tariffs and incentives established under RD 661/2007.
Article 44(3) regulated the updates and reviews of tariffs as follows:

“During the year 2010, on sight of the results of the monitoring reports on
the degree of fulfilment of the Renewable Energies Plan (PER) 2005-2010,
and of the Energy Efficiency and Savings Strategy in Spain (E4), together
with such new targets as may be included in the subsequent Renewable
Energies Plan 2011-2020, there shall be a review of the tariffs, premiums,
supplements and lower and upper limits defined in this Royal Decree with
regard to the costs associated with each of these technologies, the degree of
participation of the special regime in covering the demand and its impact
upon the technical and economic management of the system, and a
reasonable rate of profitability shall always be guaranteed with reference to
the cost of money in the capital markets. Subsequently a further review shall
be performed every four years, maintaining the same criteria as previously.

The revisions to the regulated tariff and the upper and lower limits indicated
in this paragraph shall not affect facilities for which the deed of
commissioning shall have been granted prior to 1 January of the second year
following the year in which the revision shall have been performed.”

53 RD 661/2007 (C-24) (R-118), Arts. 11, 12, RAIPRE registration had been composed of these two phases since
RD 2818/1998.

115. On 23 June 2006 (i.e., before the adoption of RD 661/2007), Royal Decree Law 7/2006 had
set forth “urgent measures for the energy sector” (“RDL 7/2006”). “Article 1. Twelve” of:
RDL 7/2007, amended Article 30 of Law 54/1997, by affording qualifying installations
receiving remuneration under the Special Regime, priority of access to the transmission and

distribution networks.* Its second transitory provision also specified that:

“Application of previous dispositions and of the review of the average rate.

Until that which is foreseen in sections one to twelve of article 1 can be
developed, in accordance with that established in the penultimate
dispositions of this Royal Decree-law:

1. Electrical energy production installations with an installed power that is
equal to or less than SOMW, that when Act 54/1997 entered in force, on
November 27, were accepted by the scheme foreseen by Royal Decree
2366/1994 on December [9], on production of electrical energy by
hydraulic installations, of cogeneration and others stored by renewable
sources or resources, as well as those referred to in the second additional
disposition to the mentioned Royal Decree, shall maintain the mentioned
scheme.

2. The review of the average rate made by the Government shall not be
applied to the prices, bonuses, incentives and rates that are part of the
compensation for the electrical energy production activity in the special
scheme.”

116. By 2009, Spain had enhanced the development of renewal energy investments.*> The system
had also created a Tariff Deficit which exceeded EUR 20 billion by 2009. The Tariff Deficit
is a shortfall of revenues in the electricity system which arises when the income generated

by the SEE is insufficient to cover the costs associated to the system.*°

Consulting, “[t]his situation was caused by the reluctance of the Spanish Government to increase end user tariffs which

31

Against this background, on 30 April 2009, Spain adopted Royal Decree Law 6/2009 (“RDL
6/2009”) further amending certain provision of the 1997 Electricity Law.*” RDL 6/2009, was
aimed primarily at tackling Spain’s tariff deficit and sought to establish a path to eliminate
the tariff deficit by 1 January 2013.°8 Pursuant to Article 1 of RDL 6/2009, the government
set up a “securitisation fund”, known as the Fondo de Titulizacién del Déficit del Sistema
Eléctrico (Fund for the Securitisation of the Electricity System Deficit), in charge of
financing payments made to satisfy collection rights (invoices) arising from unpaid
electricity settlements, and addresses thereby the tariff deficit. Article 4 of RDL 6/2009,
established a “Pre-Assignment Registration” requirement, for all installations intending to
qualify for the RD 661/2007 economic regime and that fulfilled certain conditions. Once
registered in the Pre-Assignment Registration, the installation had 36 months to obtain its
final RAIPRE registration and start selling electricity in accordance with Article 4(8).° RDL

6/2009 did not modify the economic and regulatory regime put in place by RD 661/2007.

RDL 6/2009 authorized the State to introduce annual restrictions on the number of registered

installations that could start operating if Spain’s RE targets were exceeded:

“If to the contrary, the power associated with the registered projects were
to be greater than the envisaged objective, the economic regime established
in the aforementioned Royal Decree 661/2007, of 25 May shall apply and
shall be extinguished with the registered facilities. In this case, by
agreement of the Council of Ministers, at the behest of the Minister of
Industry, Tourism and Trade, annual restrictions may be established to the
execution and entry-into-service of the registered facilities and the
prioritisation thereof so as not to compromise the technical and economic
sustainability of the system, conveniently extending, as the case may be, the
maximum deadline established in article 4.8 of this Royal Decree-Law.

would compensate the additional generation costs. These higher than expected generation costs came from different
sources, being the increase in gas prices linked to Brent and the increasing penetration of renewable energy, namely
wind and Solar PV (although only in 2008 and 2009), the key drivers.” Péyry Energy Consulting, “Spanish Bespoke

2. A new legal-economic framework shall be approved by Royal Decree for
facilities registered in the Remuneration Pre-assignment Administrative
Registry, once the remunerative regime currently in force is exhausted. The
objectives of this new Royal Decree will be to establish a sufficient and
adequate economic regime to encourage the entry-into-service of this type
of facility, promoting research and development in the industry which make
it possible to reduce the costs of the facilities, improve their operations and
contribute to the increase of the industry’s competitiveness.”

119. Such restrictions were introduced on 19 November 2009 by a Resolution of the Secretary of
State for Energy (“November 2009 Resolution”).°' The November 2009 Resolution
provided, among others, a staggering timeline for the entry into operation of wind and CSP
facilities that were pre-registered and thus a staggering connection of the installations to the
electricity grid on an annual basis. The installations would be given access to the grid on a
deferred basis, in January 2011, January 2012, and January 2014, depending on the date at
which they had obtained the final RAIPRE registration.

120. The November 2009 Resolution indicated that, at that point, the power generated by RE
facilities registered by RAIPRE under RDL 6/2009, far exceeded the objectives delineated
in the PER 2005-2010 and reflected in Articles 37 and 38 of RD 661/2007. In particular, 104
applications were submitted for thermoelectric solar technology for a total power of 4,499
MW (compared to the 500 MW objective), and 536 applications for wind technology, for a
power of 13,462 MW (compared to the 20,155 MW objective).™ Thus, the power requested
for the thermoelectric solar and wind technologies, added to the already installed power,

exceeds the power targets contained in RD 661/2007.

installations by:

e Limiting the number of hours per year, during which wind and CSP were entitled to
receive payment subject to the FIT. All electricity produced above the operating hour
limit would not benefit from the subsidy but instead could sell the electricity at market
price (Article 2).

e Specifying that for CSP plants, the Premium option was only available after the first 12
months of operation (with fixed-tariff becoming the only available during that year), and
requiring operating plans under the premium regime to switch to a fixed tariff for 12
months (Article 3).

e Confirming that CSP and wind installations that had obtained the definitive registration
in the RAIPRE on or before 7 May 2009, and CSP and wind installations that at the time
of entry into force of RDL 6/2009 met the requirements for registration in the Pre-
Assignment Register, shall not be affected by the revisions of tariffs, premiums and upper
and lower limits referred to in Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007. (Article 4 (CSP), Article
5(3) (wind)).°”

123. On 23 December 2010, Spain adopted Royal Decree Law 14/2010 (“RDL 14/2010”),
establishing certain urgent measures to correct the tariff deficit.** The Parties are in dispute
as to whether wind and CSP plants were also covered by this measure. The Respondent
alleges that this RDL meant a reduction of the remuneration to be received by all generators,
including CSP and wind, as they were all obliged to contribute to address the tariff deficit

through a toll for access to the transmission and distribution networks. This, according to

® Royal Decree 1565/2010, which regulates and modifies certain aspects pertaining to the electrical energy production
activity under a special regime, 19 November 2010 (published on 23 November 2010) (R-121).

the Respondent, meant a reduction in the profitability or return on investments of CSP
plants.’ The Claimants allege that this regulation affected mainly photovoltaic generators”!

and in any case, even if it affected CSP and wind technology, the impact was minimal.’

124. On4 March 2011, the government issued Law 2/2011 on Sustainable Economy, confirming
among others its 20% national goal for participation of renewable energies in gross energy
consumption for the year 2020. The text (issued the same year the Claimants invested in
Spain) describes some of the underlying policies and actions to be taken by the government

to reform the energy sector as a whole, including the Special Regime.”

125. On 27 January 2012, Spain enacted Royal Decree Law 1/2012, eliminating the economic

incentives for new power generators plants, including those using renewable energy sources

and suspending the “remuneration pre-assignment procedures”.”*

126. The Spanish Supreme Court has rejected the assumption “that the legal situation outlined by
Royal Decree 661/2007 must remain virtually unmodified or unchanged over the 30
following years”.”° Moreover, the judges “do not consider, in effect, that the above Royal
Decree considers a tariff regime for ever, nor that the Government, when exercising their
legal power of authority, or the legislator, using their legislative authority, may not adapt or
modify this regime to new circumstances (economic, productive, technological or of any
other nature) that may arise in such an extended period of time”.”° The Constitutional Court

of Spain endorsed the case-law from the Supreme Court.””

2. The Disputed Measures

127. On 27 December 2012, Spain enacted Law 15/2012 on Tax Measures for Energy
Sustainability (“Law 15/2012”). This legislation imposed a 7% levy on all income obtained
by all generators, renewable or otherwise.’ The “nature” of this “Tax on the Value of the

Production of Electric Energy” (““TVPEE”), was described in Article 1, as follows:

“The tax on the value of the production of electricity is a levy of a direct
and real nature which taxes the production of electricity and its
incorporation into the electricity system, measured at the power station bus
bars, through each of the facilities featured in article 4 of this Law”.”?

128. Law 15/2012 also modified Article 30 of Law 54/1997, by suppressing the premium for

electricity produced by CSP plants using fossil fuel such as natural gas, as follows:

“The electricity that is attributable to the use of a fuel in a generation facility
that uses as its primary energy any of the non-consumable renewable
energies shall not be subject to the premium economic regime, other than
in the case of hybrid facilities which use non-consumable and consumable
sources of renewable energy, in which case the electricity attributable to the
use of the consumable source of renewable energy is subject to the bonified
[sic] economic regime.

To this end, by order of the Minister of Industry, Energy and Tourism, the
methodology for calculating the electricity attributable to the fuels used
shall be published.”*°

129. Finally, Law 15/2012, introduced measures to enlarge the source of financing of the SEE.

Thus, thereafter, those sources included not only the revenue from the access fees and other

78 Law 15/2012, concerning tax measures to ensure energy sustainability, 27 December 2012 (published on 28 December
2012) (“Law 15/2012”) (C-26) (R-06), Arts. 1-11.

” Law 15/2012 (C-26) (see also R-06), Art. 1. Of note, Article 4 defines the “taxable event” for the TVPEE, as the
generation and incorporation of electrical energy into the Spanish electricity system. Article 6 specified that the levy
was to be calculated on the basis of “the total amount that corresponds to the tax payer for the production of electricity
and its incorporation into the electricity system, measured at power station bus bars, for each facility” during the
corresponding taxable period. In addition, Art. 28 of Law 15/2012 introduced modifications on the Tax on Hydrocarbons
that affect, among other products, electricity produced by CSP plants using natural gas.

regulated prices paid by consumers, but also certain earmarks of the Respondent’s National

Budget.

On | February 2013, the government adopted Royal Decree Law 2/2013 (the “RDL 2/2013”)
concerning “urgent measures within the electricity system and the financial sector”. *! The

Preamble explained the background of this Decree Law as follows:

“Data made public by the National Energy Commission in its report
35/2012, of 20 December, [...] made manifest the appearance of new
deviations in the cost and revenue estimates caused by different factors,
both for the closure of 2012 and for 2013 which, in the current economic
context, would make it almost unfeasible to fund such costs with the
electricity fees and the elements expected to derive from the General State
Budget.

To a great extent these deviations are due to a greater increase in the cost of
the special regime on account of an increase in operating hours which was
greater than expected, to an increase in remuneration values due to their
being indexed to the Brent price, and to a decrease in revenue from fees due
to a very marked fall in demand which was consolidated during this tax
year.

The alternative that was raised would be a new increase in the access fees
paid by consumers of electricity. This measure would directly affect
household economies and company competitiveness, both in a delicate
situation given the current economic situation.”

Articles 1 to 3 of RDL 2/2013 further scaled back the FIT available to RE generators. In
particular, Article 1 reduced the inflation adjustments for the FIT by delinking the
adjustments to the consumer price index, and instead linking it to the “Consumer Price Index
(CPI) at constant taxes excluding unprocessed foods or energy products.” Article 2 reduced
to “O” the value of the Premium set forth under RD 661/2007, and Article 3 left current and
new CSP and wind plants with the possibility to sell the electricity either at the wholesale

market price or subject to the Fixed Tariff option.

132. On 12 July 2013, Royal Decree Law 9/2013 on the adoption of urgent measures to “guarantee
the financial stability of the electricity system” was enacted (“RDL 9/2013”). * RDL 9/2013,
expressly derogated RD 661/2007.* It also eliminated the FIT available under the Special
Regime and provided instead a specific remuneration (“Special Payment”) calculated in
accordance with certain criteria, measured from the perspective of allowing a “standard
installation” to obtain a “reasonable return”. Moreover, RDL 9/2013 changed the
remuneration regime which was previously calculated on the basis of production (rate per
kW produced) to a regime based on efficiency criteria (investment costs, operating costs,
revenues). Article 1 of RDL 9/2013 amended Article 30(4) of the 1997 Electricity Law, as

follows:

“Additionally, subject to the terms that the Council of Ministers might adopt
pursuant to Royal Decrees, in relation to the remuneration for the generation
of electricity calculated according to market price, installations may receive
a specific remuneration [‘the Special Payment’] composed of an amount per
unit of installed capacity. Such amount shall cover, as appropriate, the
investment costs of a standard installation that cannot be recovered through
the sale of energy, as well as an amount for the operation of the installation
to cover, as the case may be, the difference between exploitation costs and
the revenues obtained from the participation of such a standard installation
in the market.

For the calculation of that specific remuneration, the following elements
shall be considered, based on the installation’s regulatory operational life
and by reference to the activities carried out by an efficient and well
administered business:

a) The standard revenues for the sale of generated energy valued at market
price of production;

b) The standard exploitation costs;
c) The standard value of the initial investment.

To that effect, the costs or investments determined by laws or administrative
regulations that do not apply to the Spanish territory shall not be considered

in any case. In the same manner, only those costs and investments related
to the activity of electric energy generation can be taken into account.

[..]

This remuneration regime shall not exceed the minimum required level to
cover the costs that are necessary for installations to compete on an equal
footing with the rest of the technologies in the market in order to allow those
installations to obtain a reasonable return, by reference to the standard
installation, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the above, exceptionally
the remuneration regime might also include an incentive to investments and
timely execution of an installation, if this was going to result in a significant
cost reduction for the Spanish islands or the extra-peninsular territories’
electricity systems.

Such reasonable return will be based on, before taxes, the average returns
in the secondary market of the State's ten-year bonds plus the adequate
differential.

The parameters of the remuneration regime can be revised every six years.”
133. With regard to the “reasonable return” the First Additional Provision, also stated:

“For the purposes of that which is envisaged in the penultimate paragraph
of article 30.4 of Law 54/1997, of 27 November, for installations which on
the date on which this Royal Decree-Law were to be entitled to a premium
economic regime, the reasonable return shall be referenced, before tax, to
the average yield during the ten years prior to this Royal Decree-Law
coming into effect from ten-year Government Bonds in the secondary
market, increased by 300 base points. All of which is without prejudice to
the review envisaged in the last paragraph of the aforementioned article.”

134. On 17 October 2013, Spain adopted Law 15/2013, charging to the General State Budget
certain costs of the SES, including those resulting from the economic incentives put in place
to promote electrical energy production from renewable energy sources. On this basis, an
extraordinary credit was granted for the sum of EUR 2,200,000,000 in the budget of the
Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism.* This is not one of the measures that form the
basis of the Claimants’ claim, and thus is not covered under the definition of “disputed

measures.” It is included herein in chronological order, for the sake of completeness.

* See Law 24/2013 (C-32) (R-38), Preamble.

135.

39

On 26 December 2013, Law 24/2013 (“Law 24/2013”) was enacted as the new electricity
law, superseding Law 54/1997. The principle of economic and financial sustainability of the
electricity system was described as being “a guiding principle in the action of the public
administrations” under this law. Law 24/2013 eliminated the distinction between the
Ordinary and Special Regimes, deciding instead that given the level of penetration of
electricity generated from renewable technologies in the SES, renewables producers were on
the same footing as conventional power generators, save to the extent that express provision

was made. The Preamble explained as follows the reasons for adopting a new electricity law:

“The causes of this imbalance lie in the excessive growth of certain costs’
items owing to energy policy decisions without ensuring their correlative
income from the system. This has all been exacerbated by the lack of growth
in electrical demand, essentially the consequence of the economic crisis.

Despite the fact that tolling increased by [one hundred and] twenty two
percent between 2004 and 2012, positioning the electricity price in Spain
well above the European Union average, this was not enough to cover the
system’s costs. This imbalance has reached the point where the accumulated
debt of the electrical system is currently in excess of twenty six billion
Euros, the structural deficit of the system stands at ten billion per annum
and the failure to correct the imbalance has introduced the risk of the
bankruptcy of the electrical system.

Law 54 enacted on November 27th 1997 has proven insufficient to ensure
the financial balance of the system, amongst other reasons because the
remuneration system for regulated activities has lacked the flexibility
required for its adaptation to major changes in the electrical system or in the
evolution of the economy.

Hence, the experience of the last decade has made it clear that the economic
and financial instability of the electrical system, brought about by the tariff
deficit, has prevented the assurance of a stable regulatory framework which
is necessary for the smooth carrying out of an activity like the electrical
business which is very capital intensive.

The widespread awareness of the tariff deficit situation and the consequent
threat to the very feasibility of the electrical system has led to the need to
make major changes to the remuneration regime for regulated activities. In
view of the progressive deterioration in the sustainability of the electrical
system, the legal entities in the latter could no longer legitimately trust the

40

maintenance of the parameters which had degenerated into the situation
described and any diligent operator could anticipate the need for these
changes.

For activities with regulated remuneration, the Law reinforces and clarifies
the principles and criteria for establishing the remuneration regimes to
which end the necessary costs will be considered to carry out activity by an
efficient, well-managed company through the application of homogeneous
criteria throughout Spain. These economic regimes will allow appropriate
returns to be obtained with regard to the activity risk.”

136. In addition, the law confirmed and further developed the principles set out in RDL 9/2013,
including the Special Payment remuneration scheme subject to revisions every six years, with
the base line predictions reviewed every three years.*> Law 24/2013 also provided renewable
installations priority of dispatch over non-renewable generators where electricity was offered
at the same price “without prejudice to the requirements pertaining to the maintenance of
system reliability and safety, under the terms determined in the regulations by the

Government”.*°

137. On 6 June 2014, Spain adopted Royal Decree 413/2014 (the “RD 413/2014”),*”
implementing the regime adopted under RDL 9/2013 and confirmed by Law 24/2013. Thus,
this decree developed the mechanism to implement the priority of dispatch for renewable
sources generators** as well as the Special Payment, among other features.*? In particular,
Article 11 of RD 413/2014 describes some of the characteristics of this Special Payment as

follows:

“2. This remuneration regime shall apply to the production installations that
use renewable energy sources, high-efficiency cogeneration and wastes that
do not reach the minimum level necessary to cover the costs which would
allow them to compete at an equal level with the rest of the technologies in
the market and to obtain a reasonable return regarding the standard
installations applicable for each case.

3. The granting of this specific remuneration regime shall be established
through procedures of competitive concurrence which will be adjusted to
the principles of transparency, objectivity and non-discrimination.

4. For the determination of the specific remuneration regime applicable for
each case, every installation, depending on its characteristics, shall be
assigned a standard installation.

5. The specific remuneration for each installation shall be obtained from the
remuneration parameters of the standard installation that corresponds to it
and the characteristics of the installation itself. [...].”

138. Moreover, the specific remuneration regime is set considering a standard installation with an
operational life of 25 years, being “efficient” and “well-managed”, as already indicated in
RD 413/2014.% Each installation was assigned a corresponding standard installation
according to its characteristics.°! Furthermore, tariff payments received prior to the inception
of the new regime are counted towards the total remuneration that an installation might
receive over its deemed operational life, to determine whether the plant has received a
reasonable return. If the installation has surpassed the “reasonable return” marker (i.e.,
7.398%), it will not receive further subsidies. Its owner will not be asked to return the funds

surpassing this marker either.°? Article 19 reads in relevant part:

“1. The value on which the reasonable return of the standard installation
shall hinge will be calculated as the average yield of ten-year Treasury
Bonds in the secondary market of the 24 months prior to the month of May
of the year prior to the start of the regulatory period increased in a
differential.

The reviews of the value on which reasonable return shall hinge will be
applicable in what is left of the regulatory useful life of the standard
installation.

2. Before 1 January of the last year of the corresponding regulatory
period, the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism shall present to the
Council of Ministers a draft bill that will include a proposal for the value

RD 413/2014 (C-33) (see also R-127), Art. 13.2-3. The regime is reviewed every six years, with the income estimates
of income resulting from electricity sale, reviewed every three years (Art. 15).

of the differential indicated in the previous section during the next
regulatory period, pursuant to the criteria established in Article 14.4 of
Act 24/2013 dated 26 December. [...].”

139. A few days later, on 16 June 2014, Ministerial order IET/1045/2014 (the “June 2014 Order’),
approved the remuneration parameters for “standard installations” engaged in the production

of electricity from renewable energy sources.*? The Preamble explained:

“This order finalizes the changes to the remuneration model for renewable
energy, co-generation and wastes, granting financial stability to the system
in a definitive manner, at the same time as it guarantees a reasonable return
on the installations. These installations will continue to receive additional
revenue over and above what they receive from the market until the end of
their operational life, as long as they have not obtained this level of return.
Furthermore, the importance of this order resides in the fact that it concerns
the determination of useful operational life and the quantification of the
initial value of the investment, insofar as it concerns parameters that may
not be revised.”

140. On 16 October 2014, Ministerial Order IET/1882/2014 dated 14 October 2014 entered into
effect. It established the methodology for calculating the electrical energy attributable to the
use of fuels in solar thermoelectric power plants and confirmed the obligation to repay the
remuneration that had resulted from the production of energy with natural gas, between 1
January 2013 and 12 July 2013 (i.e., date of entry into force of RDL 9/2013), as already set

forth under RD 413/2013.°*

141. The new regime provides revenues which are no longer correlated only to the actual
production of the installation. It becomes less profitable for significant installations like the
Claimants’ CSP plants but can sometimes generate more revenue stream in certain

conditions.°>

B. THE CLAIMANTS’ INVESTMENT IN SPAIN

142. RREEF first invested in Spain in February 2011, in a project known as the “Dédalo Project”
by indirectly acquiring an equity interest in three project companies with activities in the
wind power sector. Subsequently, in July 2011, RREEF indirectly invested in a project for
the development of a 49.9 MW CSP Plant, in Andalucia, known as the “Arenales Plant.”
Also in June 2011, RREEF indirectly invested in two other CSP plants, also in the south of
Spain. The plants, referred to by the Claimants as the “Andasol Plants” were already

operational at the time of the investment.

143. The Tribunal briefly describes below the due diligence and information gathering processes
for the making of the investments (1), to then describe the particulars of each investment, to

the extent relevant for the Tribunal’s Decision (2).

(a) Pre-Investment Phase and Due Diligence

144. In 2007, RREEF was approached for the first time by Deutsche Bank Madrid, in connection
with the Dédalo Project, as identified below.” The project was put on hold in 2008 due to
lack of financing available and considering the financial crisis.” Negotiations resumed in
March 2010, and RREEF started looking again at potential business opportunities in the

renewable energy sector in Spain.

145. In mid-2010, RREEF assessed again its possibility of investing in the Dédalo Project and the
Arenales Plants,?® and engaged in discussions with financial advisors, investment bankers
and developers.” According to the Claimants, “although RREEF was engaged in three
different projects, with three different project teams and different advisors running them,
essentially the information was all pooled.”!° They are thus described here below together

in chronological order.

One of these advisors was Péyry Energy Consulting (“Péyry”), a global consulting and
engineering company, who issued a report in July 2010, commissioned by the Claimants.
The focal point of the report was the “forecasts of wholesale electricity and gas prices, and
individual capture price projections for Arenales and Casablanca projects for the period up
to 2035 under the existing RD 661/2007 tariffs structure.”!°! The report contains a brief
analysis of Spain’s PER 2005-2010 and the PANER 2011-2020, as well as the regulatory
framework under RD 661/2007 and RDL 6/2009.!°? Péyry considered that while the global
financial crisis had created some uncertainty in the industry, the FIT remuneration scheme
provided “sound project economics.”!° It also acknowledged the difficulties arising from
Spain’s Tariff Deficit, which it described as “one of the major problems that has haunted the

Spanish energy industry since 2001 [...].”!°

In 2010, prior to the issuance of RD 1614/2010, the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and
Commerce (the “Ministry”) held consultations with the CSP and wind industry associations
in which it discussed potential regulatory changes. The Parties disagree on the
characterization of these consultations. According to the Claimants, the discussions were
negotiations that meant to appease CSP and wind technology investors, after important
regulatory changes had affected the photovoltaic industry.!°° For the Respondent, these
consultations were part of the mandatory process for the enactment of regulations set forth
under Law 50/1997, where different stakeholders, including industry associations, are invited

to give their views before the regulation is issued in final form.'°° The Respondent further

alleges that the Claimants are not part of either of the two associations which concluded the

agreement and thus it is unclear why they believe to be bound by it.!°”

148. On 2 July 2010, the Government issued a press release reflecting the outcome of the

discussions (the “July 2010 Agreement”).!°8 The document reads in relevant part:

“The wind power technology subsidies prescribed in RD 661/2007 will be
reduced by 35% until 1 January 2013. On their part, solar thermal plants
will be deprived of access to the market price + subsidy option for one year
of operation, in which they can only access the regulated rate as prescribed
in RD 661/2007, whichever is smaller.

It has also been agreed to delay the entrance into operation of the solar
thermal plants with regards to the date foreseen in the ordination of the
projects presented as of the pre-registration of Royal Decree Law 6/2009.

Furthermore, the number of hours to which they have the right to
compensation over the market price is limited for wind power and solar
thermal plants, taking into account the different technologies and the
provisions of the Renewable Energies Plan 2005-2010 for the calculation
of the profitability of the facilities.

[..]

This agreement furthermore assumes the reinforcement of the visibility and
stability of the regulation of these technologies in the future, guaranteeing
the current incentives and rates of RD 661/2007 for the facilities in
operation (and for those included in the pre-registration) starting in
2013.”

149. On 27 July 2010, SJ Berwin LLP (“SJB”) rendered a “preliminary due diligence report”
regarding RREEF’s potential investment in the Arenales Project, in which it made a brief

summary of the applicable regulatory regime, considering the pre-assignment register under

17 Ty, Day 2 (Moraleda), 76:1-6.
108 Government of Spain, Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Commerce, Press Release: The Ministry of Industry,
Tourism and Trade Reaches an Agreement with the Solar Thermal and Wind Power Sectors to Revise their
Remuneration Frameworks, 2 July 2010 (“July 2010 Agreement”) (C-23). The Parties are in dispute as to the nature of
this document. While the Claimants allege that it reflected an “agreement” between the RE industry associations, the
Respondent alleges that it simply reflects the consensus reached during negotiations held during the application of a
mandatory consultation process for the issuance of all royal decrees provided for under Article 24 of Law 50/1997. See
CM, paras. 178-181; and RCM, paras. 369-372.

RDL 6/2009, as well as the terms of the July 2010 Agreement.!!° SJB issued a second report
on 16 November 2010 (“Second SJB Report”), assessing, among others, the regulatory
regime for wind-generated energy from the viewpoint of the Dédalo project.!!! With regard
to the “developments of the legal regulatory framework” the Second SJB Report stated the

following:

“In 2009, the Spanish Government started a restructuring process of the
renewable energy sector, with the objective of the preservation of the
technical and economic stability of the system. This process, which has not
been completed yet, has resulted in restrictions on the development of new
projects as well as in a reduction of economic rights (tariffs).

[...] Said draft legislation may make it possible to get an idea of what the
outcome of amendments to current legislation will be, though, it is difficult
to provide an accurate picture of how the regulatory regime for renewable
energies is going to finally look due to the strong lobbying that is taking
place on this issue.

[...] Further to the report from the CNE, even though is not binding, the
MITYC may make additional amendments to the draft. As such, it could be
possible that any change as regards the reductions of the subsidies to wind
and solar thermoelectric energy, as well as to the limitation of the number
of hours of energy produced that will have access to the current economic
regime of Royal Decree 661/2007, will not be included in this draft and will
be processed afterwards by the MITYC.”

150. Sometime before the issuance of the Second SJB Report, the Government of Spain made
available — first to Deutsche Bank Madrid (“DBM”) '!? (RREEF’s holding entity) and then
to the public at large — a draft of a Royal Decree, which mirrored some of the agreements
reflected in the July 2010 Agreement. Subject to very few modifications, the draft, became

Royal Decree 1614/2010, discussed in detail in Section IV(A)(b)(1), above.

151. On 25 March 2011, at RREEF’s request, Herbert Smith LLP produced a memorandum
analysing the “potential impact on the legal certainty (seguridad juridicay’! of “the
regulatory framework for CSP Projects in Spain.” !'4 The HS memorandum further confirmed
that the economic regime would remain stable during the operational life of those

installations already registered in the RAIPRE.!!> It stated:

“Therefore, the provision [Article 44.3 of RD 661/2007] establishes the
untouchability of the regulated tariff and the caps and floors, whereby the
review thereof cannot affect — according to the provision itself — the sites
placed into operation before 1 January of the second year after the year of
the review, i.e., before 1 January 2012.

(E) However, that provision only mentions the tariff and the caps and floors
not the premium. Therefore, in principle, by not mentioning premiums, the
Ministry of Industry has interpreted that RD 661/2007 does not protect the
premiums enjoyed by installations, whereby future legislation could alter
and reduce them (without touching the tariff or caps and floors).”!!

152. When assessing the potential regulatory risks, Herbert Smith acknowledges that Spanish
legislation “contains a precedent whereby RD 661/2007 retroactively changed (reduced) the
remunerative regime established in Royal Decree 436/2004, and this modification was
allowed by the Supreme Court” but considered that RD 1614/2010 “strongly protects the
current remuneration and the cap of operating hours for the installations mentioned and
installations have a document from the Ministry that indicates the remuneration.” HS
concluded that “[i]n theory, the Government could (although highly improbable) in the future
approve a new provision having the same (Royal Decree) or a higher rank (Act) to modify

the protection currently afforded in RD 1614/2010.”!!7

153. In March 2011, Péyry provided an additional report on “Current State and Future Trends of
Solar Power in Spain.” In the section analysing the sustainability of the SES, Péyry

concludes:

“In 2007 the Government changed RD436/2004, which involved the
Special Regime, with the introduction of RD 661/2007. At that time the
retroactivity measure was also a matter of debate. Despite the fact that some
feel that RD 661/2007 already introduced retroactivity, we feel that this
Royal Decree also complied with the need to provide a stable framework.
It is true that the new scheme affected existing plants (i.e., Wind farms), but
it is also true that the actual impact of the retroactivity was left to the
generators’ will. Due to the fact that RD 661/2007 provided the right to
remain under the fixed tariff set in the prior RD 436/2004 for the rest of the
operating life of the project, the Government again showed its commitment
to keep the legal framework, providing stability and fair play towards
investor's past decisions.

It should be noted that the subsequent legal changes that occurred to the
Spanish renewable industry have not changed the fact that the Government
has always declared that one of the key parameters to change the premium
would be the cost incurred by investors.

The recently approved Royal Decrees introduce for the first time retroactive
changes to the legal framework clearly reducing the investor confidence.

[J

Péyry is of the opinion that [...] the zero tariff deficit target is unlikely to
be met by the end of 2012. We foresee that a more realistic scenario is the
one in which this target is be met by 2014-2015 through yearly TPA
increases in the range of 10%.

If the zero tariff deficit target by end of 2012 is postponed, it will open up
the opportunity to more deficit generation. Considering the Government
behaviour, it is likely that future changes might be implemented if
considered needed. RDL 14/2010 is aimed at tackling the lack of funds in
the electricity system, reducing the revenue of renewable generators as well
as introducing additional revenue sources (i.e., grid tolls). We feel that the
Government is in a position to continue with the same energy policy, if
considered a requirement, including implementation of further reductions
in remuneration to renewables and non-renewable technologies. ”!!*

154. On 11 May 2011, Poyry issued an additional report, this time analysing the question of the
Tariff Deficit, at RREEF’s request.!!? The document noted, inter alia, that “it is interesting
to realise that the electricity system has allowed a lot of different subsidies to influence the
market but what it seems clear is that the trend is for these subsidies to be reduced or

disappear.”

155. The Parties’ disagree generally on whether the due diligence reports mentioned in the above-
referenced confirmed the stability of the FIT regime put in place thorough RD 661/2007
(Claimants) or whether they demonstrated that changes to the regulatory changes were
foreseeable and should have been foreseen by the Claimants among others in light of the

situation of the Respondent’s Tariff Deficit (Respondent)!?!.

156. In May 2011, representatives of DBM, RREEF and Antin (a separate investor, who was

considering investing in the Andasol Plants, alongside RREEF), met with an official of the

122

Ministry’s legal department, Mr. Miguel Vizcaino,'~~ as well as with various government

officials of the Comisién Nacional de Energia (“National Energy Commission”) (the

“CNE”), seeking information regarding the regulatory regime applicable to RE.!%

158. According to this evidence, the government official had provided “[c]onfirmation that the
current decree provides a long term, stable regulatory framework [...] [although], this has to

be taken with some caution, (‘nothing is written in marble’) but any changes/adjustments in

the future would not be to the detriment of current investors.” !27

(b) The Claimants’ Investments in Renewable Energy
1. The Dédalo Wind Project

159. RREEF Pan-European Two, the second claimant in this case, acquired — through its wholly
owned subsidiary, Plateau Green Energy B.V.— a 49% equity interest in 3 project companies
(the “Dédalo companies’), for a total consideration of EUR 96.8 million.'?* The Dédalo

companies developed five wind power parks with a total installed capacity of 216 MW.!??

160. On 11 December 2009, before RREEF’s investment in this project and before the parks’
construction work was finalized, the Dédalo wind parks got registered in the Pre-Assignment
Register. '*° The Dédalo wind parks achieved final registration with the RAIPRE on 28
December 2010'7!.

The documents produced for RREEF’s Investment Committee to make its final decision
suggest that it might have been RREEF’s intention to sell its investment in the wind farms

by 2017.!2
2. The Arenales CSP Plant

In July 2011, the Claimants invested in a project for the development and final construction
of an installation located in Morén de la Frontera, Sevilla, Andalucia. The installations were

not yet operational at the time of the investment.!**

RREEP’s indirect investment in the Arenales project consisted of the acquisition through the
Second Claimant’s wholly-owned Dutch subsidiary, Fronterasol B.V., of a 49% equity stake
in Arenales Solar. The other 51% was owned by OHL Industrial, S.L., a Spanish contractor,
and by Solar Millennium AG, which would retain 25% and 26% shareholdings in Arenales
Solar, respectively.'*4 The cost of the acquisition was EUR 12.9 million (with an associated
commitment to invest up to EUR 56.1 million to fund the construction of the Arenales

Plant). !°

Before RREEF’s investment, the Arenales Project had gone through the required steps in the

registration process.

First, the Arenales Project was listed in the Pre-Assignment Register from 11 December

2009.16

Second, on 2 December 2010, before the Government passed RD 1614/2010, Arenales Solar
addressed a communication to the Directorate General of Energy Policy and Mines: (i)
waiving its right to commence to supply electricity into the grid before 1 April 2013; (ii)
accepting the hour-based limitation under the Draft decree that became RD 1614/2010; and
(iii) requesting confirmation of the economic regime that would be applying during the
installations’ “operational lifetime.” !*”

Third, on 1 March 2011, the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Commerce issued a
Resolution accepting the waiver mentioned in the preceding paragraph in respect of the

Arenales Plant (the “March 2011 Resolution”). !8

Pursuant to the Pre-Registration resolution, and the assigned classification, the Arenales
Plant could not start operations until 2013 and had to be registered with RAIPRE by 31
December 2013 to qualify for the RD 661/2007 economic regime.

On 25 September 2013, the Arenales Plant obtained definitive registration with RAIPRE.!*”

It became operational in October 2013.

The installed capacity of the Arenales Plant is in dispute between the Parties. In particular,
the Respondent contends that the Arenales Plant has an installed capacity that is higher than
50 MW (in particular, it claims a nominal installed capacity of 55 MW),'4° which the
Claimants reject.'*! Only plants with an installed capacity of 50 MW could be awarded the
Special Regime under RD 661/2007.'*7

The Parties are also in dispute as to the reasonability of the investments costs of the Arenales
Plants. The Respondent points out that they exceed the costs of the Andasol Plants by EUR
80 million, even though they were built much later in time, and are thus unreasonable. 183 The
Claimants argue that they were reasonable and caused by factors that led to higher fixed costs
than the Andasol Plants, such as the need to find costly water and gas provision solutions,

complicated civil works and so on.'##

3. The Andasol CSP Plants

The Andasol Plants are two CSP plants located in Granada, Andalucia in the south of Spain.
Each has an installed capacity of 49.9 MW (Andasol-1 and Andasol-2). They were already
operational at the time of the Claimants’ investments and according to Mr. Hauteville, one
of the Claimants’ witnesses, they are able to supply solar electricity for up to 170,000

people. !45

The Andasol Plants were planned, and their financing secured, under the scheme of RD

436/2004.'4° They became operational in 2008.'4”

On 30 June 2011, REEFF executed a Share Purchase Agreement for a 45% equity stake of
Andasol-1 and Andasol-2 through RREEF’s wholly own subsidiary, Guadisol B.V..
RREEF’s purchase price for the shares was EUR 86 million. Antin also acquired another
45% of the Andasol Plants. In addition, RREEF agreed a purchase price for the subordinated

shareholders’ loans of EUR 49 million. '4*

The Andasol Plants were duly registered with RAIPRE by December 2009, before the
Claimants’ investment in the project. In particular, Andasol-1 was registered with RAIPRE
on 24 April 2009.'4 Given the timing of the registration, it needed not fulfil any pre-
registration requirements. Andasol-2 was registered with the Pre-Assignment Register on 15

October 2009!°° and with RAIPRE on 22 December 2009.!*!

RREEF undertook a due diligence process, including on the technical, financial, tax,
accounting, legal and regulatory aspects, of both the Arenales and the Andasol Projects. This
was conducted in parallel. The information acquired in one project was applied to the

other. !°?

RREEF planned to sell'** and did sell its stake in the Andasol Plants on 26 July 2017 for

Vv. JURISDICTION: THE TAX OBJECTION

On 27 December 2012, Spain adopted Act 15/2012 “on taxation measures for energy
sustainability”, creating a new tax on the value of the production of electric energy

(“TVPEE”).

In the jurisdictional phase of these proceedings, the Parties debated at length whether the
TVPEE may be considered a taxation measure, and as such, excluded from the scope of
Article 10 of the ECT by application of Article 21(1) of the Treaty. As the Tribunal put it,
what is in dispute between the Parties is whether the measures included in Law 15/2012 are

bona fide taxes; if not “the tax carve-out does not apply”.

180. In its Decision on Jurisdiction the Tribunal decided to join the Respondent’s objections based
on ECT Article 21, to the merits. The Tribunal will thus rule on this objection in the present

Decision.

a. The Decision on Jurisdiction
181. In its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal held the following:

“195. [...] The consequence of a finding by the Tribunal that the measures
included in Act 15/2012 have not been taken bona fide could have two
consequences:

"either the Tribunal would decide that the Respondent cannot’ avail
itself of the exemption provided for in Article 21(1) [of the ECT]
and find the Application [of the taxation carveout] inadmissible in
this respect;

= or it could consider that the institution of the new tax is in violation
of the standards guaranteed to the investors under Article 10 of the
ECT calling for reparation, as is expressly requested in the
Claimants’ Memorial.

196. In both cases, a careful investigation of the circumstances and of the
effects of the challenged measures is needed. Such investigation cannot be
made at the present preliminary stage.”/*7

b. The Parties’ Positions

182. The Tribunal lists below the main arguments raised by the Parties with regard to the Tax
Objection. The Parties’ arguments have been summarized in detailed in Section VII of the

Tribunal’s Decision on Jurisdiction, which constitutes an integral part of this Decision.

'56 The text of the Decision on Jurisdiction sent to the Parties inadvertently reads “cannot”; this obviously is a typing
mistake which, if maintained, would make the alternative envisaged by the Tribunal irrelevant.

The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent considers that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear the Claimants’ claims

arising out of the “Taxation Measures” adopted under Law 15/2012 because the Respondent

has not consented to dispute relating to taxation measures being arbitrated. In particular, the

Respondent contends that:

The consent of the Kingdom of Spain is limited to potential violations arising from its
obligations under Part III of the ECT. Since Part III does not impose any obligations with
respect to Tax Measures adopted by Contracting Parties, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction

ratione voluntatis to decide the claim arising out of Law 15/2012.

The ECT does not create rights nor impose obligations regarding Tax Measures, except
for particular circumstances defined in Article 21 of the ECT. Article 10 of the ECT, on

which the Claimants seek to base their allegations, is not concerned by the exceptions.

The TVPEE is a “Tax Measure” for the purposes of the ECT.

Tax Measures have to be presumed bona fide.

TVPEE is a bona fide Tax Measure of general application.

The Claimants’ Position

For their part, the Claimants consider that the measures implemented through Law 15/2012

are not “Tax Measures” under Article 21. In particular:

The 7% levy was “a backdoor tariff cut” formed as a tax to strip away and eventually
abolish the incentives provided under RD 661/2007. This is because “[a]lthough on its
face the 7% levy applied to both the ordinary regime producers, the conventional
producers, and the special regime renewable energy producers, the effect of the measure
was not equal between them. The ordinary regime producers could pass that additional
7% \evy cost on to consumers by raising electricity prices. The special regime producers

couldn’t, and the reason they couldn’t is because they were largely dependent upon

s7

payments that were independent of the market price [...] those were fixed amounts; they
9158

could not be adjusted to effectively pass on the 7% levy.

e Since the 7% levy was not a tax implemented in good faith, the ECT tax carve-out does

not apply.

e Taxation Measures have to be bona fide and may not be presumed bona fide. Moreover,
if there is prima facie evidence that the tax measure is not bona fide, the burden of proof

switches to the other party.

e 7% levy is not a bona fide measure but a tariff cut intended to deprive the Claimants of

their rights under the ECT.

c. The Tribunal’s Analysis on the Tax Objection

185. In the view of the Tribunal, there can be no doubt that the 7% levy is clearly a tax. This is
true, whether taking account of the definition given in Article 21, paragraph 7, of the ECT or
giving it the usual meaning of the word in domestic laws. In this respect, the Tribunal shares

the view expressed by the Novenergia tribunal:

“519. For the Tribunal there is no doubt that the provisions of Law 15/2012
are provisions relating to a tax of the domestic law of a Contracting Party
as set out by Article 21, section (7)(a)(i) of the ECT. Consequently, the
Tribunal is convinced that Law 15/2012 is indeed a taxation measure in its
nature, which on its face is subject to the carve-out from the protection of
the ECT.”!°

186. The Tribunal accepts that, as explained by the /solux tribunal, “the presumption that the

IVPEE can be contemplated within the ‘carve out’ provided by ECT Article 21(1) would

'58 Tr, Day 1 (Gill), 116:19-117:9; see also CR, para. 556; RR, para. 351.

58

remain destroyed if the tax measure was not promulgated in good faith.”!© However, as

noted by the Novenergia tribunal:

“the starting point, or the assumption, should always be that the taxation
measure was in fact adopted in good faith.'®! The consequence of this
assumption is that the Claimant bears the burden of proving to the Tribunal
that Law 15/2012 was not enacted for the purpose of raising general revenue
for the state, but for a different purpose, i.e. that the measure therefore was
enacted mala fide.”'

187. It is generally accepted that in international, litigation including in investment disputes:

“the applicant must establish its case and that a party asserting a fact must
establish it; as the [International] Court [of Justice] observed in the case of
Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (Nicaragua
v. United States of America), ‘it is the litigant seeking to establish a fact who
bears the burden of proving it’ (Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judgment,
LC.J. Reports 1984, p. 437, para. 101)”.!%

188. Therefore, the question is not whether there exists a presumption that a tax is or is not
promulgated bona fide but whether this precise tax was or not established bona fide. After
having examined the arguments exchanged by the Parties in this respect, the Tribunal sees
no reason to assume that, in the circumstances, the 7% levy is not a bona fide tax. The 7%
levy is part of Spain’s global policy concerning the protection of the environment. As

explained in paragraph 3 of the Preamble of Act 15/2012, “[o]ne of the bases of this tax

reform [is] the internalization of environmental costs arising from the production of electric
energy [...]” and, in effect, besides the “tax on the value of the production of electrical
energy” levied in Title I, the “tax measures for energy sustainability” provided for in Law
15/2012 concern the regulation of two other new taxes respectively on production and on
storage of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste (Title II) and Title III modifies Law

38/1992 on special taxes concerning natural gas supplies.'™ Moreover, as provided for in

Article 4, the tax applies indiscriminately to all electricity producers.'®

189. Finally, the Respondent submits that the Government of Andalucfa’s unconstitutionality
appeal against the TVPEE and the relevant inquiry by the European Commission with respect
to the compatibility of the said tax with EU law do not cast doubts as to the tax nature of the
measure. In particular, the Respondent submits that the Spanish Constitutional Court and the

European Commission have ratified the taxation nature and the legality of the TVPEE.!°

190. It might be true that the Respondent could have used other means than a fixed tax levy to
achieve its policy objective. But it is not for the Arbitral Tribunal to substitute itself to the

Government of Spain in this respect. As noted by the Eiser tribunal:

“The power to tax is a core sovereign power that should not be questioned
lightly. The ECT Article 21(1) tax ‘carve-out’ and the corresponding
provisions in many other bilateral and multilateral investment treaties
reflect States’ determination that tax matters not become a subject of
investor-State arbitration, save perhaps in carefully limited circumstances.
(ECT Article 21(5)(a) thus allows claims for expropriation effected through
taxation, but subject to limiting procedures requiring consideration of the
claim by national tax authorities.) The present case does not on the facts
reach a situation where the tax enforcement measures are found to have
been used as part of a pattern of behavior aimed at destroying Claimants

164 Title IV modifies the text of the Water Law of 20 July 2001.

165 Article 4 expressly refers to Law 54/1997 which defines both the general and the special regimes.

and therefore the Tribunal does not reach a view on the availability of such
an exception, were such a case to be made out.” 167
191. The Tribunal recognizes that Article 21(1) is a carve-out from the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.
The Tribunal does not, therefore, take a decision over the legality of the levy, in the
framework of the ECT, as such. However, this Tribunal considers that the levy is a cost
impacting the return to the Claimants, in relation to their investments, and so it must be taken
into consideration for the global assessment of the reasonable return to which the Claimants

are entitled.
VI. RESPONSIBILITY

192. The Claimants assert that the measures taken by the Kingdom of Spain resulted in several
breaches of its obligation under the ECT, including: (a) the obligation to accord to the
Claimants’ investments fair and equitable treatment; (b) the obligation not to impair by
unreasonable or discriminatory measures the use, enjoyment or disposal of the Claimants’
investment; and (c) the obligation to respect the obligations previously entered into with
respect to the Claimants’ investments. The Tribunal examines, in turn, each of the Claimants’
claims. To do so, it will examine in general the law applicable to the dispute and the general
framework of the dispute (namely the object and purpose of the ECT, the State’s regulatory
power and the applicability of a margin of appreciation). It will then examine the applicable
standard of each of the substantive protections allegedly infringed by the Respondent’s

measures, before examining the merits of each claim.
A. APPLICABLE LAW

1. Article 42 of the ICSID Convention

193. The relevant provisions for determining the law applicable to the merits of this dispute are

Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention and Article 26(6) of the ECT.

194. Article 42 of the ICSID Convention provides:

Article 42

(1) The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law
as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the
Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute
(including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international
law as may be applicable.

(2) The Tribunal may not bring in a finding of non liquet on the ground of
silence or obscurity of the law.

(3) The provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not prejudice the power
of the Tribunal to decide a dispute ex aequo et bono if the parties so agree.

195. Article 26(6) of the ECT provides that a tribunal shall “decide the issues in dispute in

accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and principles of international law”.

196. In the present case, the Parties have not authorized the Tribunal to decide ex aequo et bono.
The Tribunal is therefore bound to decide on the basis of Articles 42 of the ICSID Convention
and 26(6) of the ECT and of relevant “rules and principles of international law” when treaty

tules are silent.

197. The Tribunal has been made aware by the Parties of awards given in cases with similarities
with the present case.'°* While according them due attention, the Tribunal has formed its
own opinion on the legal issues before it and has applied the applicable legal rules in light of
the particular circumstances of the present case without feeling bound by any of the decisions

of previous tribunals.

2. Relevance of EU Law

198. As noted above,'!® on 29 January and 22 March 2018,'”° the Parties, with leave granted by
the Tribunal, have produced five new documents on which they have offered further
comments.!7! All of these comments mainly relate to the degree of relevance of EU law in

the present case.
a. The Parties’ position
i. The Respondent’s Position
199. The Respondent notably bases itself on the State Aid Decision!” and the Achmea Judgment.

200. In its Comments on the State Aid Decision, the Respondent’s main arguments are as follows:
- The State Aid Decision is binding on Spain;
- EU law prevails over general international law rules;
- In particular, as stated in paragraph 164 of the State Aid Decision, “the principle of fair and

equitable treatment cannot have a broader scope than the Union law notions of legal certainty

and legitimate expectations in the context of a State aid scheme”. !

- The new regime must be considered as a State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1)
TFEU;!74

- According to the Decision, referring to the case law of the CJEU, “a recipient of State aid

cannot, in principle, have legitimate expectations in the lawfulness of aid that has not been

expectation stemming from illegal State aid”; !7>

Therefore, the Claimants’ alleged expectations in the present case are not legitimate, and “no
investor could have objective and reasonable expectations to [the] preservation [of the

Spanish support scheme] or to have an acquired right to an ummodifiable [sic] FIT over time,

all along 40 years.”!7°

In essence, the Respondent’s position in respect to the Achmea Judgment was submitted in

its letter of 9 March 2017 requesting the introduction of that Judgment into the record:

“The Ruling of the EUCJ on the C-284/16 (Achmea Case) constitutes a
decisive factor in the present Arbitral Procedure to be assessed and applied
by the Arbitral Tribunal, as it affects not only to a Jurisdictional objection
raised by the Respondent, already decided by the Tribunal, but also to the
grounds of the present Case. In this regard, as the Kingdom of Spain has
argued, international Law to be applied by the Arbitral Tribunal includes
the appropriate Rules of International Treaties applicable either in
Netherlands [sic] and Spain, as the Treaty on the Functioning of the
European Union. This applicable International Law is interpreted by the
Court of Justice of the European Union (hereinafter “CJEU”), whose Case
Law is binding on Netherlands [sic] and Spain (Article 267 TFEU).”!””

Commenting on all the new documents put into the record by the Parties on 26 March
2018,'78 the Respondent first explains that “European Union Law and principles constitute

International Law that shall be applied by the Tribunal to decide all the issues in dispute in

this proceeding” “with preference over any other international or national Law” since it “is

179

an Intra-EU dispute’ in accordance with the case-law, notably the Achmea Judgment and

the Electrabel, Blusun and Wirtgen Awards.'*® According to the Respondent, it is all the

institutions,'*! in the present case that the dispute affects “a key institution of EU Law”

regulated by EU Directive 2001/77/CE and Community guidelines on State Aid for
environmental protection 2001/C 837/03. '**

Returning to the alleged incompetence of the Tribunal, the Respondent contends that “the
application of EU Law and principles to the present dispute determines the lack of

"183 since the ECT is an

jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal to hear the present dispute’
“{nternational agreement concluded between Member States”,'*+ disputes over which can

only be settled by the CJEU under Articles 267 and 344 TFEU.

On the substance, the Respondent maintains that it “is also important to determine the
Legitimate Expectations of Investors who claim that a specific amount of State Aid is

maintained immutable more than 30 years” !*5

and that “EU Law shall be applied to assess
the proportionality and reasonability of the disputed measures precisely because the
Respondent had to respect the limits established by EU Law”.'®° Moreover, referring, e.g.,

187

to Total v. Argentina, °’ the Respondent states that EU Law cannot be ignored by the Tribunal

since it “reflects the common tradition of 28 States”. !88

li. The Claimants’ Position

In their response to Spain’s Comments on the State Aid Decision, the Claimants’ position is

'89 Claimants’ Response to Spain’s Comments on State Aid Decision.

65

- The jurisdiction objection is irrelevant since the Tribunal already decided on jurisdiction;
- In any case, EU Law does not impose on Spain to repeal the original regime;
- The State Aid Decision has no bearing on the Claimants’ legitimate expectations and is not

relevant to proportionality or transparency issues.
206. As for the Achmea Judgment, the Claimants consider that it is irrelevant since:

“(a) the judgment makes it clear that it applies only to a treaty where the EU
is not itself a Contracting Party, which is not the case of the ECT; !

(b) there can be no incompatibility between the ECT (a treaty to which the
EU is a Contracting Party) and EU law. As this Tribunal has already
decided, should there ever be an inconsistency, the ECT would prevail; 191

(c) the ECT is binding on the EU and provides for arbitration of disputes
concerning violations of the ECT as a result of EU measures that EU
institutions might adopt. In other words, if a treaty claim can be brought
against the EU under the ECT, and that is by definition not incompatible
with EU law, it follows that the investor-State arbitration mechanism under
the ECT is also not incompatible with EU law; and

(d) unlike the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT, the ECT provides that investor-
State disputes shall be decided in accordance with this Treaty (the ECT) and
public international law, not the law of the host State (and EU law).”!°?

207. Furthermore, the Claimants criticize the Achmea Judgment on the ground that:

“the ECJ draws an erroneous distinction between commercial and
investment-treaty arbitration to explain that commercial arbitrations
‘originate in the freely expressed wishes of the parties’ while the latter
‘derive from a treaty by which Member States agree to remove from the
jurisdiction of their own courts disputes which may concern the application
or interpretation of EU law’ {'°*] This is clearly wrong. It reveals a serious
lack of understanding of the very principle on which arbitration is grounded:
the parties’ consent to submit their disputes to individuals whose judgment
they are prepared to trust. Arbitration clauses in investment treaties are as

freely entered into as they are in commercial arbitration. The source of the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction in investment-treaty arbitration is, as in commercial
arbitration, based on the consent of all parties to the disputes, claimant-
investor and respondent-State.”!**

b. The Tribunal’s Analysis

Decision that:

“74. However, this Tribunal has been established by a specific treaty, the
ECT, which binds both the EU and its Member States on the one hand and
non-EU States on the other hand. As for the latter, EU law is res inter alios
acta and it cannot be upheld that, by ratifying the ECT, those non-EU States
have accepted the EU law as prevailing over the ECT. The ECT is the
‘constitution’ of the Tribunal and, to use the terminology of the
UNCITRAL tribunal in PV Investors v. Spain, ‘Article 26 of the ECT [...]
sets out the parameters of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction’ [°°] This is what the
Parties to the ECT agreed amongst themselves; it is not within the
jurisdiction of the Tribunal to alter this.

75. Therefore, in case of any contradiction between the ECT and EU law,
the Tribunal would have to insure the full application of its ‘constitutional’
instrument, upon which its jurisdiction is founded. This conclusion is all the
more compelling given that Article 16 of the ECT expressly stipulates the
relationship between the ECT and other agreements — from which there is
no reason to distinguish EU law. It follows from this that, if there must be
a ‘hierarchy’ between the norms to be applied by the Tribunal, it must be
determined from the perspective of public international law, not of EU law.
Therefore, the ECT prevails over any other norm (apart from those of ius
cogens — but this is not an issue in the present case). In this respect, this
Tribunal fully agrees with the position of the tribunal in Electrabel.'°”

66

The Tribunal notes that it has already dealt at some length with the issues raised again by the
Respondent in respect with the relevance of EU law, when commenting on the documents
brought into the record on 30 January and 22 March 2018. These issues were dealt with in

the Tribunal’s Decision on jurisdiction of 6 June 2016. Most notably, it considered in that

209.

210.

211.

67

Although these findings do not appear in the operative part of the Decision on Jurisdiction,
they constitute the necessary support for it and are therefore res judicata.'°’ The Tribunal
therefore considers that, as regards the relevance of EU law with regard to its jurisdiction,

the discussion is closed and the relating issues will not be reopened at this stage. !°*

The Tribunal’s reasoning on jurisdiction also has consequences in respect of the merits of the
case itself: if there is an incompatibility or discrepancy between the ECT on the one hand
and EU law on the other hand, the former must prevail.!°° This being said, the Tribunal also
noted in its Decision on Jurisdiction that “to the extent possible, in case two treaties are,
equally or unequally, applicable, they must be interpreted in such a way as not to contradict
each other.” Moreover, the present Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that “EU Law
reflects the common understanding of 28 countries in such an important matters as legitimate
expectations [and, more generally, the interpretation of the ECT], that cannot be disregarded

by the Tribunal [...]”22!

With this in mind, the Tribunal notes that the Achmea Judgment, which is at the centre of the
debate between the Parties concerning the role and relevance of EU law, is inapposite in the
present case: the applicable law in that case was the bilateral investment treaty concluded in
1991 between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Federative
Republic, that is an intra-EU instrument exclusively concluded between two EU Member
States. This is not the case of the ECT which, as recalled above, “binds both the EU and its

Member States on the one hand and non-EU States on the other hand”?°”. It would be highly

improper to impose a sweeping modification of the ECT on EU non-member States using the

pretext that it was eventually considered as being incompatible with EU law.

The Tribunal also recalls that when States (or, for that matter, international organisations)
enter into incompatible commitments, the law of treaties does not offer any solution in terms
of hierarchy between the treaties at stake: the issue must be dealt with on the ground of the
law of State (and international organisation) responsibility”. Such an issue is beyond the
jurisdiction of this Tribunal and could only been settled by means of negotiations or other
means of peaceful settlement of dispute. If the EU or any of its Member States have violated
the laws of State responsibility because it is a party to treaties that contain incompatible

commitments, that is a matter for it to resolve.

To finish with this discussion concerning the relevance of EU law in the present case, the
Tribunal feels obliged to disagree with the assertion of the CJEU concerning the alleged
distinction between commercial and investment-treaty arbitration? In both cases, the source
of the obligation to arbitrate is based on the consent of the parties to the dispute, whether
States or private persons. As this Tribunal’s decision in its Decision on jurisdiction made
clear, both of the Parties in the present case gave their consent to arbitrate under the relevant
documents, for the Respondent that being the ECT. No post-hoc decision of the CJEU can
somehow undo that consent once given. If the European Commission considers that an EU
Member State has violated EU law in relation to such consent, then that is an internal matter
for EU law that does not affect the application of international law by the Tribunal instituted

on the basis of the ECT.

B. GENERAL FRAMEWORK: THE OBJECT AND PURPOSE OF THE ECT, THE STATE’S
REGULATORY POWER AND THE APPLICABILITY OF A MARGIN OF APPRECIATION

a. The Parties’ Positions
i. The Claimants’ Position

214. The Claimants assert that, as required by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties
(*VCLT”), the Tribunal must interpret the ECT in good faith and in accordance with the

ordinary meaning given to its terms.?°>

215. In particular, the Respondent must act in accordance with the ECT’s object and purpose, as

presented in its Article 2 which states, in relevant part, that the Treaty:

“establishes a legal framework in order to promote long-term co-operation
in the energy field, based on complementarities and mutual benefits, in
accordance with the objectives and principles of the [European Energy]
Charter”.

216. The Claimants contend that the fundamental objective of the ECT is to facilitate transactions
and investments in the energy sector by reducing political and regulatory risks.?°° The
Claimants further identify the following “sub-objectives” which namely provide for: (a)
operation of energy investments within a stable and equitable legal framework; (b) provision
at national level for a transparent legal framework; and (c) minimisation of non-commercial
risks for energy investments in so far as possible.”

217. Energy investments differ from other types of investments, in the sense that they “tend to
involve high-value and long-term financial commitments in projects that cannot adapt their

cost and financing structures to short-term changes in investment conditions and that are,

205 CR, para. 40, CPHB, para. 26.

therefore, particularly sensitive to legal and political changes and other associated risks.”?°*
Accordingly, the Claimants continue, in order to address the specific sectoral needs and
achieve its goals, the ECT offers a “higher” or more robust level of protection than most
bilateral treaties, and thus one “cannot equate the provisions of the ECT with just any other

investment treaty or investment chapter in a free trade agreement.”?°”

In response to Spain’s argument that the ECT is not an insurance policy, the Claimants allege
that “[i]t is precisely because the energy sector is strategic [...] and highly regulated,
precisely because the contracting parties knew that states may want to interfere or use their

regulatory powers, that the ECT had to provide very extensive protections indeed.”?!°

The ECT provides additional legal protections — at the international level — which would
reduce, to the greatest extent possible, “non-commercial risks” of political and regulatory
natures, thereby ensuring that legal frameworks remain stable for investors.?!! This
interpretation, they allege, is supported by multilateral organisations and fora, as well as by

the Energy Charter Secretariat’s Reader’s Guide to the ECT.?!?

The Claimants’ further contend that the particular needs of the energy sector also justify that
the latitude of regulatory action accorded to the States under the ECT is extremely limited,
and much narrower than under BITs. This is reflected, they contend, in the very few express
exceptions to the application of the treaty, in general, and to the substantive investment

protections, in particular, that the text of the ECT itself recognizes.*!*
On the question of the State’s right to regulate, the Claimants submit the following:

“The ‘right’ to regulate refers to the extent to which a state can take
decisions (including passing laws) without incurring international liability

and the obligation to pay damages. A state does not renounce its right to

regulate by becoming a Contracting Party to ECT. Rather, a state is free to

regulate, even in violation of its international obligations, but it must pay

any affected investors compensation for those violations. The question for

the Tribunal, therefore, is whether the ECT contains any exceptions which

allow Spain to avoid liability (and the obligation to pay compensation for

adverse regulatory actions).”?!+
The Claimants further contend that the ECT contains no exceptions applicable to this case
since (a) Article 10 of the ECT, unlike Article 13 (Expropriation) does not provide for the
so-called police powers defence and (b) the Contracting Parties to the ECT deliberately
restricted their ability to regulate in the public interest without incurring liability. On this
latter question, the Claimants points to Article 24(2)(b)(i) where it is specified that measures
“necessary to protect human, animal, or plant life or health” will nevertheless incur an
obligation to pay compensation, when those changes violate inter-alia Article 10 of the
ECT.?"* In particular, it is the Claimants’ position that “the contracting parties to the ECT
decided that investor protections would trump the need to protect human, animal or plant life

or health.”?!¢

Thus, the Claimants conclude that the Contracting States to the ECT “deliberately chose to
restrict significantly the regulatory space preserved for signatories.” and carefully
circumscribed their right to regulate, save for six express exceptions to the application of the

Treaty found in Article 24 of the ECT.?!”
With regard to the applicability of the “margin of appreciation” the Claimants posit that:

“The MOA [Margin of Appreciation] relates to the appropriate standard of
deference to be given, or the level of scrutiny to be applied, to a state’s
decisions. It is a concept that has been developed primarily in the context
of applying the protections found in the European Convention on Human
Rights. It may be relevant when a tribunal or court is scrutinising a decision

over which the state has particular technical or constitutional competence.
The MOA comprises a spectrum, with high deference (low scrutiny) at one
end, and low deference (high scrutiny) at the other end. The MOA is not a
legal standard, but an analytical tool that can be adapted to the particular
circumstances.”?/*

The Claimants further contend that “the ECT does not expressly provide for a [Margin of
Appreciation] analysis and neither party has suggested that it falls within an applicable rule
of international law.” On this basis, they conclude that “applying the [Margin of

Appreciation] as an additional standard of review is neither ‘necessary nor appropriate”?!

Finally, referring to a question posed by one of the Members of the Tribunal, the Claimants
note that Spain not only failed to raise a necessity defence, but they also failed to prove that
the disputed measures responded to a “pressing social need” or that “Spain amended its laws

and regulation to serve ‘basic governance requirements for the public interest”. In addition,

the Claimants contend that even assuming arguendo that the Tariff Deficit could be

considered a “pressing social need”, this is not sufficient to avoid liability.?”°

li. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent agrees with the Claimants that in order to interpret the substantive
protections of the ECT, the Tribunal must rely on Article 31 of the VCLT and thus analyse
the ECT in accordance with the common meaning of its terms in their context, and in light
of the objective and aim of the Treaty.7?!

According to the Respondent, the context refers to the moment the ECT was negotiated and
signed, and its aim was and remains to liberalize and promote a free energy market between

Western countries and the countries of the so-called “Eastern bloc” after the fall of the Berlin

Wall, based on the principle of non-discrimination and market-oriented price formation.?””
Consequently, the Respondent contends, “the principal objective of the ECT regarding
investor protection is to attain the implementation of a free market to be able to perform
energy activities without discrimination on the grounds of the investor’s nationality.”?”> The
Respondent rejects the Claimants’ characterization of the ECT, as a treaty seeking to mainly

protect investments. Only 7 of 50 articles are devoted to investment, and the protection of

 

investments is simply a means to achieve the overall goal of an efficient energy market

throughout Europe, based on market rules and non-discrimination.?”*4
According to the Respondent:

“The reluctance of states to limit their regulatory power in a sector as
strategically important as energy leads the signatories of the ECT to
differentiate between two moments: 1) the so-called ‘making-investment
process’ (paragraphs (2) and (3) of article 10 of the ECT), in which the
conditions for guaranteeing the objective of national treatment and most-
favoured nation treatment were reserved for the signing of a ‘supplementary
treaty’, that has still not been signed and 2) the moment after the realization
of the investment, in which the guarantee of national treatment and the
most-favoured nation clause apply to the foreign investor, albeit with
certain limitations.”??5

The Respondent thus argues that once the investment is made, the best protection granted by
the ECT to the investor and to the foreign investment is “national treatment” since the
Treaty’s ambition, as reflected in Article 2 of the Treaty, is to remove barriers to non-
discrimination.” This is not to say however, that the Respondent is alleging that the Fair
and Equitable Treatment (“FET”) clause only protects investors against non-discrimination.
It only alleges that this is one of the ECT’s primary objectives, together with favouring

market-led pricing.?”’

74

Moreover, for the Respondent, considering the context also entails a consideration of the
subject matter. In this case, the subject matter of the ECT is investments in the energy sector,
which is a highly strategic and well-regulated sector. As such, it would be unreasonable to
consider that, by signing the ECT, the Contracting Parties accepted to provide investors with
a kind of “insurance policy” that would prevent them from taking regulatory reforms in a
strategic sector, and that would provide international investors better protection than national
investors.”7* On this question, they reject the Claimants’ allegations that the ECT offers a
higher level of protection in comparison for example of BITs because of the nature of the
investments being protected.?”?

In addition, the Respondent states that the guarantee of national treatment to investments
reflected in Article 10(7) of the ECT is subject to a significant exception, embodied in ECT
Article 10(8) of the Treaty, in the case of subsidies or public aid. This exception reads as

follows:

“The modalities of application of paragraph (7) in relation to programmes
under which a Contracting Party provides grants or other financial
assistance or enters into contracts, for energy technology research and
development, shall be reserved for the supplementary treaty referred to
in paragraph (4).”?°

According to the Respondent, this exception applies to the case since the Claimants claim
the payment of subsidies or State aid for the production of electricity. Since the
supplementary treaty referred to in the paragraph has not been signed yet, the Respondent
concludes that there is still no obligation by the signatory States of the ECT to grant the
investor “national treatment” for programs related to grants or financial assistance from the

host State to the investor.”?!

The Respondent further contends that the “ECT does not set out any limits on the regulatory
power of the States other than the minimum standards of international law, with an objective
of non-discrimination. And it is even reiterated that such treatment does not prevail in matters
of subsidies or public aid.”?*? Accordingly, while the ECT establishes limits on the regulatory
power to achieve the aforementioned level of protection for investments and for investors, it

does not annul or even limit its regulatory authority.?*7

To the contrary, the Respondent contends, the State maintains its power to amend the relevant
regulatory framework and exercise its power of macroeconomic control for reasons of public
interest. This has been specifically recognized in the Guide to the Energy Charter Treaty,
which is part of the official version of the ECT in Spain.?*4

The Respondent also asserts that the State retains “a certain margin of discretion” to modify
both the remuneration system for renewables and the amount of the subsidy. This has been
confirmed by judgments of the Supreme Court of Spain handed down between 2005 and

2009, on record in these proceedings.”°>
b. The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal takes note of the Parties’ agreement on the applicability of the “General Rule
of Interpretation” embodied in Article 31 VCLT. It will apply this “general rule” in the

present Decision when appropriate.

The “Purpose of the Treaty” is exposed in Article 2 which refers to “the objectives and
principles of the [European Energy Charter adopted in the Concluding Document of The

Hague Conference on the European Energy Charter signed at The Hague on 17 December

1991]. The object and purpose of the ECT must therefore be assessed in light of this
instrument which is part of its context since it was made by the Parties in connection with
the conclusion of the Treaty and accepted by them as an instrument related to the treaty.?*°
The objectives of the Charter are expressed in Title 1 which articulates the following

principles:

“Within the framework of State sovereignty and sovereign rights over
energy resources and in a spirit of political and economic co-operation, [the
signatories] undertake to promote the development of an efficient energy
market throughout Europe, and a better functioning global market, in both
cases based on the principle of non-discrimination and on market-oriented
price formation, taking due account of environmental concerns. They are
determined to create a climate favourable to the operation of enterprises and
to the flow of investments and technologies by implementing market
principles in the field of energy.”
In the opinion of the Tribunal, the Parties to the ECT were aiming at realizing a balance
between the sovereign rights of the State over energy resources and the creation of a climate

favourable to the flow of investments on the basis of market principles in this field.

Although the Tribunal recognizes energy investments are special as a matter of fact, in that
they have commonalities and differences with other investments and in that there are
economic, commercial, infrastructural, financial, market and other particularities that
distinguish energy investments from other investments, the Tribunal is of the view that these
peculiarities are taken into consideration and reflected in the relevant treaties in so far as is
deemed appropriate by the negotiators. In the present case, the Tribunal must interpret the
ECT by taking stock of the particular rules the Parties have deemed necessary to include into

the Treaty in view of the specificity of the energy market.

This does not mean, however, that the ECT regulates fully and integrally all matters which
can be relevant in the present case. As recalled above,”*” in conformity with Article 26(6)

ECT and Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, in case the Treaty is mute, the Tribunal

236 Cf, VCLT (CL-90), Article 31(2)(b).
237 See supra para. 195.

242.

243.

244.

77

must decide the issues in dispute in accordance with other applicable rules and principles of
international law as may be applicable. Hence, it is indeed not because the ECT does not
expressly provide for the States’ right to regulate, or because it does not formally recognize
a margin of appreciation in their favour, that it must, nor can, be interpreted as excluding

them.

In this respect, there can be no doubt that States enjoy a margin of appreciation in public
international law and the exercise of such a power of appreciation must be more particularly
recognized when States apply the ECT, whose common purpose is “to promote the
development of an efficient energy market throughout Europe” in view of creating “a climate
favourable to the operation of enterprises” and “to the flow of investments and technologies
by implementing market principles in the field of energy.” Such common goal may be

reached by different ways, depending on the circumstances as appreciated by each State.

However, such a margin of appreciation is not without limits. In the first place, it can only
be exercised in so far as the State Party does not violate the special legal regime, established

by the ECT itself, that applies to the energy sector in and amongst the member States.

Moreover, as firmly established in the case-law, an international obligation imposing on the
State to waive or decline to exercise its regulatory power cannot be presumed, given “the
high measure of deference that international law generally extends to the right of domestic
authorities to regulate matters within their own borders.”?** The regulatory power is essential
to the achievement of the goals of the State, so to renounce to exercise it is an extraordinary
act that must emerge from an unequivocal commitment; more so when it faces a serious
crisis. As stated by the Continental tribunal, “it would be unconscionable for a country to
promise not to change its legislation as time and needs change, or even more to tie its hands
by such a kind of stipulation in case a crisis of any type or origin arose.” Such a
commitment would touch on core competences of the State, to which it is inconceivable the

State would implicitly renounce. A treaty obligation, whereby the State guarantees the

and cannot be assumed through an implicit declaration, diluted in general expressions.

The Blusun tribunal gave a clear and complete assessment of the issue:

“[T]ribunals have so far declined to sanctify laws as promises. For example,
[...] the tribunal in Charanne was clear:

under international law ... in the absence of a specific commitment toward
stability, an investor cannot have a legitimate expectation that a regulatory
framework such as that at issue in this arbitration is to not be modified at
any time to adapt to the needs of the market and to the public interest.””4”

The El Paso tribunal made a similar distinction, as follows:

“Under a FET clause, a foreign investor can expect that the rules will not
be changed without justification of an economic, social or other nature.
Conversely, it is unthinkable that a State could make a general commitment
to all foreign investors never to change its legislation whatever the
circumstances, and it would be unreasonable for an investor to rely on such
a freeze.”*4!

the various questions in dispute between the Parties.

last preliminary point must be dealt with.

Article 10(7) ECT provides that:

“Each Contracting Party shall accord to Investments in its Area of Investors
of other Contracting Parties, and their related activities including
management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal, treatment no less
favourable than that which it accords to Investments of its own Investors or
of the Investors of any other Contracting Party or any third state and their
related activities including management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or
disposal, whichever is the most favourable.”

However, with regard to “programmes under which a Contracting Party provides grants or
other financial assistance”, Article 10(8) reserves the modalities of application of this special
treatment for the supplementary treaty to be concluded between the Parties in accordance

with paragraph 4 of Article 10.

In the view of the Tribunal, there can be no doubt that the present case bears, at least in part,
upon the payment of subsidies or State aid. Therefore, in the view of the Tribunal, Article
10(8) ECT applies in principle — or, more exactly, it would apply, had the “supplementary
treaty” envisaged in paragraph 4 of Article 10 been concluded. But this is not the case. The
Respondent draws from the non-conclusion of the “supplementary treaty” the radical
conclusion that “there is still no obligation by the signatory States of the ECT to grant the
foreign investor the ‘national treatment’ in the matter of programmes” concerned by such

242

payments.“*~ The Tribunal disagrees: absent modalities expressly regulated by a treaty,

general international law applies.

C. LEGAL STANDARDS OF PROTECTION

(THE FET AND THE UMBRELLA CLAUSE)

It is the Claimants’ position that, by taking various wrongful measures, the Respondent has
caused substantial losses to their investments in Spain in violation of Article 10(1) of the
ECT regarding FET. In particular, the Claimants allege that by enacting Law 15/2012, RDL
2/2013, RDL 9/2013, Law 24/ 2013, RD 413/2014 and the June 2014 Order, the Respondent
has fundamentally altered the applicable legal and regulatory regime encompassed in RD

661/2007, upon which the Claimants relied on when investing in the Spanish RE sector.***

According to the Respondent, the Kingdom of Spain has always fulfilled its obligations and
has not violated the standard of FET under the ECT. It is the Respondent’s view that the new

regulatory economic framework has been adjusted in compliance with Spanish law.

22 RCM, para. 763.
23 CM, paras. 419-421.

252.

80

Moreover, the new legal and economic frameworks have been enacted in a predictable,
reasonable and proportionate manner in accordance with Spanish law in order to serve the
public interest and through the use of the State’s regulatory power.“ It also states that the
Claimants’ full restitution claim fails since the new measures respect the principle of

reasonable return?4>

of renewable energy plants. The primary objectives of the measures are
the sustainability and balance of the Spanish Electricity System, to the extent that they
guarantee no over-remuneration of investors in the form of State subsidies, after the drop of
electricity demand in 2010. Finally, the Respondent highlights that it never committed to

freeze a particular remuneration model in the favour of the Claimants.”4°
(a) The Legal Standard
1. Scope of the FET
a. The Parties’ positions

i. The Claimants’ Position

According to the Claimants, the FET standard is an autonomous and independent standard.
In particular, they consider that it is “additional” to the minimum standard of protection to
be found under customary international law. They consider this interpretation to be consistent
with the wording of Article 10 of the ECT, as well as with the ECT travaux préparatoires.
In support of this latter statement, they note that an earlier draft of the ECT stated that FET
shall be “in accordance with the principles of international law and the relevant international

obligations” but the italicised words were removed in the final version.?4”

244 CR, paras. 33-35.

245

It should be noted that both Parties use indistinctly in their pleadings the English expressions “reasonable return”,

“reasonable rentability” or * 'y” and Spanish “retorno ” and
razonable”.

253.

254.

255.

81

This becomes evident, so the Claimants contend, by applying the maxims of treaty
interpretation contained in Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT. If we look at the ordinary
meaning of “fair” this is defined as “just, unbiased, equitable, impartial, legitimate,” while
“equity” is defined as “fairness; impartiality; even-handed dealing”.*** With regard to the
context of the provision, the FET standard, when compared to other provisions, is an absolute
standard that provides a fixed reference point regardless of the treatment others receive. The
Claimants assert, that therefore “the FET standard in the ECT is violated even if the
Claimants have received the same treatment as companies of Spanish nationality or from
third-party States.”*4? They rely for this proposition on the interpretations put forward by the
tribunals in Tecmed v. Mexico, Saluka v. Czech Republic, Azurix v. Argentina and

Kardassopoulos v. Georgia.?”

The Claimants further submit that even if, arguendo, FET is equated to the minimum
standard of treatment, Spain has still breached the FET, as the minimum standard has been
said to require a “reasonably well-organised modern state” committed to “good
governance.”*>! According to the Claimants, the disputed measures fail to satisfy the levels
of good governance to be expected of a reasonably well-organised modern State because the
disputed measures were (a) unannounced, abrupt, retroactive, unprecedented in nature;
(b) contrary to EU and international regulatory practice and good governance principles; and

(c) were not the least harmful measures available to Spain.?>>

ii. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent rejects the Claimants’ assertion that the ECT’s FET standard goes beyond

the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law.7>

82

The Respondent further explains that since the main objective of the ECT is to guarantee
non-discrimination of foreign investors, if a State’s national treatment does not respect the
minimum standard of treatment, then it is at this point that the protections of the Treaty

pursuant to international law, kick-in.?>+

The Respondent further rejects the Claimants’ contention that the ECT guarantees a higher

level of protection and that the ECT contains an autonomous FET standard.”°>

b. The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Parties have discussed at length the relationship between the FET, the minimum standard
of protection and national treatment. Interesting as it may be, this discussion remains rather
academic. Concretely, the Tribunal’s position must be based primarily on Article 10 of the
ECT. This provision guarantees FET to foreign investors, with the precision that this
treatment will not be “less favourable than that required by international law” (an expression
which can be assimilated to imposing the minimum standard of protection) (paragraph 1)
together with national treatment (paragraph 3). In other words, the minimum standard as
applied traditionally in international law is included in the FET which adds to it in favour of

the investor.

Therefore, the Tribunal considers that the removal of the precision that the FET shall be “in
accordance with the principles of international law and the relevant international obligations”
from the final version?*® has no special significance: in any case: (1) the wording of the
Treaty prevails on general principles and (2) the ECT being a treaty is anchored into

international law and must be interpreted in accordance with that law.

The Tribunal is convinced that it is of no avail to cite the long litany of the case-law in which
investment tribunals have tried to define the FET standard. Suffice it to say that there can be

no doubt that (i) transparency, (ii) constant protection and security, (iii) non-impairment

284 Tr, Day 2 (Moraleda), 36:1-7.
285 Tr, Day 2 (Moraleda), 41:17-42:1.
286 See supra para. 252.

261.

262.

83

including (iv) non-discrimination and (v) proportionality and reasonableness, are elements
of the FET — and certainly so under the ECT. Therefore, in any case, whether these
requirements are generally included in the FET or not, they must be complied with by the
Respondent as parts of it express treaty obligations under the ECT. Similarly, and while it is
not expressly mentioned in Article 10(1), the Tribunal is of the opinion that respect for the
legitimate expectations of the investor is implied by this provision and is part of the FET

standard.

However, not all expectations of a foreign investor are “legitimate” and only legitimate
expectations are protected under the FET principle. Therefore, all the investors’ expectations
do not imply an immutability of the conditions of the investment. Whilst an “expectation” is
subjective, whether or not it is “legitimate” must be objectively assessed. To evaluate a claim
to a legitimate expectation, it is necessary, therefore, to assess, first, what are the expectations
of an investor and, second, whether those expectations are legitimate. The frustration of a
legitimate expectation establishes a wrongful act by the State. The frustration of a non-

legitimate expectation does not establish a wrongful act by the State.

Just because an investor may have an expectation of immutability of the conditions of an
investment does not necessarily mean that such an expectation is objectively legitimate in
any given circumstance. In order to appreciate the legitimacy (or illegitimacy) of the
Claimants’ expectations in the present case, it must be kept in mind that it is generally
recognized that States are in charge of the general interest and, as such, enjoy a margin of
appreciation in the field of economic regulations. As a result, the threshold of proof as to the
legitimacy of any expectation is high and only measures taken in clear violation of the FET

will be declared unlawful and entail the responsibility of the State.

84

263. To summarize, the Tribunal considers that:
- The FET principle includes, but goes beyond, the traditional “minimum standard”
as conceived in the Neer Case;2>"
- It also includes the protection of the legitimate expectations of the investor at the
time of the investment;
- An investor cannot legitimately expect that the conditions of its investment will
necessarily be maintained immutable;
- As will be seen below,”** the main criterion to be applied for the interpretation of
the FET standard is that of reasonableness.
2. The Umbrella Clause
264. Article 10(1) of the ECT provides that:
“Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligations it has entered into
with an Investor or an Investment of an Investor of any other Contracting
Party.”
265. The Parties disagree on the purpose and scope of protection of the umbrella clause as
encompassed in Article 10(1) of the ECT.?*
a. The Parties’ Positions
266. According to the Claimants, the purpose of an umbrella clause is to bring the host State’s
compliance with commitments assumed vis-a-vis investors under the protective “umbrella”
of the ECT.
257 L.F.H. Neer and Pauline Neer v. Mexican United States, RIAA, 15 October 1926, Vol. IV, pp. 61-62: “[...] the

treatment of an alien, in order to constitute an international delinquency, should amount to an outrage, to bad faith, to
wilful [sic] neglect of duty, or to an insufficiency of governmental action so far short of international standards that
every reasonable and impartial man would readily recognize its insufficiency”.

258 See infra paras. 460-472.

259 RCM, para. 975.

267.

268.

269.

85

While the Claimants argue that the umbrella clause covers not only contractual obligations
but also obligations that the host State assumes through unilateral acts such as legislative or
regulatory undertakings as well as any Spanish laws or regulations relating to the Claimants’

investments,?2~

the Respondent asserts that the umbrella clause covers obligations arising out
of a contractual basis only and does not extend to other forms of commitments between the
investors and the host State, except investment authorizations, licenses and permits. The
Respondent further underlines that there are no specific commitments between the Kingdom

of Spain and the Claimants or their investments.”°!

The Claimants disagree with the interpretation of arbitral cases and authorities cited by the
Respondent regarding the fundamental meaning of the umbrella clause and consider them as

misinterpretations and misleading analyses.

According to the Claimants, even if the
umbrella clause were limited in its scope to encompass only contractual commitments, which
they reject, the Claimants did obtain a bilateral administrative licence through the RAIPRE
registrations issued to each plant by Spain.”°? The Claimants contend that, through the
RAIPRE, Spain entered into a specific and binding bilateral contract vis-a-vis the Claimants

and has clear obligations with regard to each of their investments.7

Conversely, the Respondent relies on a more restricted interpretation of the umbrella clause
of Article 10(1) of the ECT in order to deny the existence of its violation vis-a-vis the

Claimants’ investment. In its submission, the Respondent invokes three different arguments

260 CR, para. 507; CM, paras. 494-499, citing the following rulings for the proposition that unilateral undertakings and
legislative acts taken by States, may constitute obligations in relation to the particular investor-claimant: LG&E Energy
Corp., LG&E Capital Corp. and LG&E International Inc. v. Argentine Republic (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1), Decision

to deny that it has breached the umbrella clause of the ECT.*® First, the interpretation made
by the Claimants contradicts the literal sense of Article 10(1) of the ECT and the
interpretation thereof by doctrine and arbitral case-law.® Second, the Respondent is not
bound “vis-a-vis” the Claimants or their investment through unilateral acts. And finally, the
obligations the Claimants claim to be protected by the umbrella clause do not exist under

Spanish law.

i. The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants submit that by enacting RD 661/2007 (and in particular Article 44(3)), RD
1614/2010 (in particular Articles 4 and 5(3)), issuing the RAIPRE certificates to each and all
of the Project Companies and rendering the March 2011 Resolution addressed to Arenales
Solar, the Respondent entered into binding obligations towards Claimants’ investments,

which it must now honour.767

In particular, pursuant to Article 17 of RD 661/2007, by signing, stamping and issuing the
RAIPRE, the Respondent was qualifying the Andasol and Arenales Plants, and the Dédalo
Wind Parks installations, for the Special Regime and confirming thereby that the Claimants
had the right to those tariffs. The Claimants stress that the RAIPRE “is a favourable
administrative act that contains an obligation on the [Kingdom of Spain] that is more binding
than an obligation contained in a bilateral contract between an investor and the State”. These
are, so the Claimants contend, clear obligations with regard to each of its investments.2°°

Moreover, the Claimants highlight that the obligations of the Respondent towards the Project
Companies can be traced back to RD 661/2007, which contained strong stabilisation

commitments.” While the Claimants concede that RD 661/2007 contemplated adjustments

to the FIT every four years, the measure had nevertheless expressly provided that such
changes would not affect duly registered existing facilities.2”” The Claimants further note
that, in the March 2011 Resolution, the Ministry reiterated its commitment to the Arenales
Solar by recognizing that the RD 661/2007 regime would be applied for the operational

lifetime of the plant.?”!

While the Respondent argues that the March 2011 Resolution was a mere communication,
the Claimants contend that it was a “favourable administrative act” binding on the

government and subject to revocation under limited circumstances.?”

As a result, the Claimants assert that by disregarding the obligations it entered into through
inter alia RD 661/2007 (and in particular Article 44(3)), the July 2010 Agreement, RD
1614/2010 (in particular Articles 4 and 5(3)), the RAIPRE certificates and the March 2011

Resolution addressed to Arenales Solar, the Respondent breached the Umbrella Clause.
ii. The Respondent’s Position

Citing various authorities and arbitral precedents to support its argument, the Respondent
advances a more restrictive interpretation of the umbrella clause of the ECT. It considers that
the umbrella clause covers merely contractual obligations or specific commitments
undertaken by the State with the investor or investment, within the framework of a contract
or similar bilateral instruments (administrative contract, concession or licence).?” This is

confirmed by the cases quoted by the Claimants.?”*

The Respondent denies that, in the present case, an obligation between the host State and the
investor exists, since no direct contractual relationship exists between the Claimants and the

Respondent via a contract, concession or licence. In addition, the Respondent considers that

277.

278.

279.

88

any alleged commitment (including the July 2010 Agreement, the RAIPRE registration or
the March 2011 Resolution), should have been entered into with the Plants and not with the
Claimants, as RREEF only has an indirect equity interest participation in the Plants.*”> The

Respondent’s rebuttal of the Claimants’ umbrella clause allegations are threefold.

First, neither RD 661/2007 nor RD 1614/2010 created a “commitment” or “relationship” or
“specific obligation” between the Respondent and the Claimants or with respect to any other
foreign investors or investments. The Respondent relies for this proposition on the Charanne
v. Spain and Isolux v. Spain awards.?’° Moreover there was no obligation to freeze the RD
661/2007 economic regime, a fact that was confirmed in the Charanne Award and which

was not altered by Articles 4 and 5 of RD 1614/2010.?””

Second, the July 2010 Agreement has no bearing on the interpretation of RD 1614/2010 and
the Asociacién Empresarial Eolica (the Spanish Wind Energy Association, AEE) and
Protermosolar (CSP Association) did not consider RD 1614/2010 as providing for an
immutable regime for existing installations. Moreover, the July 2010 Agreement was not

breached with regard to either the Claimants or their investment.?”*

Third, for the Respondent, the so-called obligations under Spanish law, as alleged by the
Claimants, do not exist.?”? The Respondent contends that the measures on which the
Claimants rely are merely acts of information or communications; they cannot generate
“petrification” of obligations over the remuneration regime.?*° As a result, the Respondent
concludes that since no obligations arise from domestic law they cannot be covered by

international law.7*!

In particular, they deny that the registry in RAIPRE could be considered a “license”,
reiterating that the RAIPRE is a mere administrative manifestation that does not generate

commitments, as already declared by the Charanne v. Spain case.?*?

The Respondent
emphasizes that all facilities, including those under the Ordinary and the Special Regime, are
registered in the Administrative Registry and the RAIPRE is simply a section of that
Administrative Register.’*? RE installations have been registered under the RAIPRE’s
special section since RD 2818/1998 and this did not preclude subsequent decrees from being
applicable to those installations; they have been subject to all regulatory changes since

then,?84

As to the March 2011 Resolution, the Respondent contends that it is not an administrative
act but a mere communication to the Arenales Plant, confirming the application of the
regulatory regime in force in its entirety (not only to two regulations as the Claimants assert),

at that point in time.78°

Neither the March 2011 Resolution nor the alleged statements from government employees
could unilaterally generate the specific “obligations” or “commitments” referred to under the

umbrella clause in Article 10(1). Thus, all the Claimants claim should be dismissed.
b. The Tribunal’s Analysis

Here again the Tribunal will not enter in the intellectually interesting but practically fruitless
discussion concerning the definition and scope of an umbrella clause in the abstract. Two

things are clear in the present case and result directly from the terms of the ECT itself:

- the Respondent has a duty to comply with Article 10(1) ECT;

- this duty relates to the “any obligations it has entered into with an Investor”.

282 RR, paras. 1030-1032.

°83 RR, paras. 480-481. The Respondent also contends that the Supreme Court of Spain has confirmed that there is no
link between the right to receive subsidies and registration in RAIPRE, which is compulsory even for those facilities for
which the special regime has been revoked. RR, para. 489, citing Supreme Court Ruling of 30 March 2012 (R-345). On
this issue, see also Tr. Day 2 (Moraleda), 106:22-108:9.

285 Tr, Day 2 (Moraleda), 108:10-109:18.

284.

285.

90

On the one hand, the expression “any obligations” calls for a broad interpretation but, on the
other hand, the phrase “it has entered into” seems to refer exclusively to bilateral relationships
existing between the Respondent and the Claimants, to the exclusion of general rules; and
the Spanish (“las obligaciones que haya contraido con los inversores”) or French (“les
obligations qu'elle a contractées vis-a-vis d’un investisseur”) lead to the conclusion that the
last sentence of Article 10(1) ECT only applies to contractual obligations. As noted in the
award of 12 October 2005 in Noble Ventures, Inc. v. Romania, in respect to a very similar
clause in Article II(c) of the Bilateral Treaty between the United States and Romania dated

28 May 1992:

“TC]onsidering the wording of Art. II (2)(c) which speaks of ‘any obligation

[a party] may have entered into with regard to investments’, it is difficult

not to regard this as a clear reference to investment contracts. In fact, one

may ask what other obligations can the parties have had in mind as having

been ‘entered into’ by a host State with regard to an investment. The

employment of the notion ‘entered into’ indicates that specific

commitments are referred to and not general commitments, for example by

way of legislative acts.”?°°
In the present case, the Tribunal accepts the Respondent’s view according to which the
RAIPRE do not add anything to the contractual relations entered by the Spanish Government
with each of them; as accepted by the Respondent itself, these certificates “only manifest the
registry of the installations in an administrative register that does not generate specific
commitments”.”*’ As provided for in Article 14(1) of RD 661/2007, “the final registration of
the facility in the Public Authority Register of production facilities under the special regime
shall be a necessary requirement for the application of the economic regime regulated under
this Royal Decree to such facility.” However, this “requirement” does not constitute a
commitment falling under the umbrella clause. It certainly implies that the investment is

regulated by RD 661/2007 but not that the Respondent has entered into the obligations

contained therein with the Claimants. Mutatis mutandis the same reasoning applies to RD

1614/2010.

But this is not the end of the question. Even if the rules enunciated in RD 661/2007 and
RD 1614/2010 are not covered by the umbrella clause under the last sentence of Article 10(1)
ECT, they are essential components of the domestic legal environment of the investment and
the Claimants could legitimately expect the State would observe and enforce them in

conformity with general rules of international law.

By way of conclusion on this point, the Tribunal is of the view that the umbrella clause
contained in the last sentence of Article 10(1) ECT has no particular role to play in the present
case but that the Respondent was expected nonetheless to observe and enforce domestic law

as a part of the FET standard and basis for legitimate expectations.

(b) The Alleged Violations of the Claimants’ Rights
1. Stability and Predictability
Article 10(1) of the ECT, first sentence, provides in relevant part:

“Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this
Treaty, encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent
conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments
in its Area.”

a. The Parties’ Positions

i. The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants contend that, in addition to a State’s obligation to provide a stable and
predictable legal framework for investments, the first sentence of Article 10(1) of the ECT
provides an independent and autonomous free-standing obligation to provide investments

and investors stable conditions. In particular, the Claimants contend that there is an obligation

290.

291.

292.

92

to maintain a stable legal framework once the investment is made. This obligation sits
288

independently of the FET standard.
The Claimants explain that their argument is based on the ordinary meaning of Article 10(1)
while noting that no tribunal has determined before whether the stability commitment is

freestanding.

The Claimants contend that:

- The New Regime represented a complete overhaul of the regulatory regime that was
in place at the time the Claimants made their investments.”

- The Respondent’s allegation that the New Regime complies with the principle of
reasonable return, in and of itself confirms that Spain has not respected the stability and
predictability of the legal framework, representing a breach of Spain’s obligations to provide
transparent conditions, as the Claimants did not base their investments on the notion of
reasonable return.?””

- The New Regime was not only implemented abruptly, through a lengthy and opaque
transition, but it was also applied retroactively. This means that the New Regime applies to
existing installations for the remainder of their useful life. Even if the regime did not affect
the results or activities resulting from the pre-existing situation, which it does, (i.e., the
electricity already produced and sold on the market), the regulation would still be considered
“retroactive” in accordance with the ordinary meaning of the word, and as provided under
Spanish law.??!

The Claimants reject the interpretation of “retroactivity” advanced by the Respondent. In
particular, they contend that the New Regime “applies to existing installations and removes

the right for the Installations to receive the RD661/2007 FIT for their operational lifetime in

288 CPHB, paras. 72-77.

20 CR, paras. 470-471.
291 CR, paras. 472-484.

293.

93

breach of Spain’s promises.” They further contend that “[t]he New Regime is also retroactive
because it seeks to claw-back past remuneration: it takes into account past earnings to
calculate an investor’s remuneration going-forward” and retroactively reduces the project-
level return.?°? Thus, the Claimants’ conclude, the disputed measures affect the Claimants
“acquired rights” given the existence of the claw-back under the New Regime, thereby
violating its international law obligations.” The Claimants further state that even if the New
Regime did not affect the energy it had already sold, it affected the energy that was projected
to be sold in the future and thus it affected the Claimants expectations as recognized by the

Respondent in a report from the CNE.?”

The Claimants’ position is that the changes made to the original legal framework resulting
in an on-going uncertainty constitute a breach of the Respondent’s obligations under the ECT
and must be assessed in light of Spain’s stabilization guarantees under Article 44(3) of RD
661/2007 and Articles 4 and 5.3 of RD 1614/2010, as the decision to invest is in large part
based on assessments of the state of the law and the overall business environment.?%>

According to the Claimants’ submissions, the Respondent not only made continuous changes
to the legal framework on which they relied on when making the investments, but it also left
them not knowing what regime they will be subject to.2°° The uncertainty the Claimants
experienced results from a shift from the stable regime they relied on to an ambiguous

regime, which impacts have not been fully measured yet.”°”

282 CPHB, paras. 145-146.

23 CPHB, para. 149. According to the Claimants, “that's how the new regime works. They flatten the return at 7.398%
for the lifetime of the investments; they look backwards. If you’ ve earned above that in the past, you get lower than that
in the future. [...] That is a technical way to say it’s not retroactive, when in fact it is.” Tr. Day 2 (Sullivan), 145:12-25.

In particular, the Respondent wrongfully subjected the Claimants to a “‘roller-coaster’ of
constant and drastic changes in the applicable legal and regulatory framework” by modifying
the RD 661/2007 in the first place and then by applying the changes retroactively to the
Claimants’ investments in 2012 and 2013, ultimately wiping out the RD 661/2007 economic

regime in its entirety in July 2013.7" This constitutes a breach of the FET standard.
Finally, the Claimants distinguish their case from the Wirtgen case:

“in JSW Solar, Article 2(1) of the Germany-Czech Republic BIT merely
obliges the contracting parties to ‘accord investment fair and equitable
treatment’. It does not contain the same provision as in the ECT expressly
requiring the Contracting Parties to encourage and create ‘stable’ conditions
for Investors”?

ii. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent asserts that Article 10(1) does not contain a free-standing standard.*
Relying on the award in Plama v. Bulgaria, the Respondent submits that the stable and
predictable conditions must be assessed within the FET standard of the ECT.**! The
Respondent further considers Claimants arguments inapposite as they are based on seven

awards that do not apply the ECT standard.*

Moreover, the Respondent relies on the Jsolux v. Spain award to support its conclusion that

the Article 10(1) of the ECT does not contain an autonomous standard.*°

The Respondent alleges that the disputed measures were macroeconomic control measures
adopted in compliance with international commitments and for legitimate reasons, including

(a) preventing over-remuneration of investors consistent with the principle of a reasonable

rate of return; (b) ensuring the sustainability of the SES; (c) preventing that consumers

assume the burden of paying higher prices to compensate for economic imbalances.*°*

Furthermore, the Respondent contends that the contested measures are not retroactive, since
they do not affect acquired rights and only have effects towards the future. The Respondent
alleges that “the contested measures are not retroactive (1) neither according to International
arbitral Case Law, neither for the European Commission, (2) nor in accordance to Spanish
Case Law, nor according to scientific doctrine, (3) nor according to the criteria the RE sector
Associations nor for other investors, like Iberdrola, whose criterion is invoked by the
Claimant[s].”°

According to the Respondent, for a regulation to be retroactive under international law, it
must affect acquired rights. It further contends that the Claimants have no acquired rights to
a future remuneration*” because “under no circumstances do [the measures] require RE

producers to return the subsidies previously received.”*”’ Instead, the New Regime:

“allows taking into account the remuneration already received from the
beginning of the operation of the facility, for the purpose of calculating the
future subsidies to receive, apart from the incomes of the market, without
therefore incurring retroactivity. With that it avoids the perception of over-
retribution that could (i) distort the energy market and (ii) constitute State
Aids contrary to European Union Legislation.”*°

The Respondent’s position is that the only certainty a diligent investor could have is that the
Respondent would take necessary measures to ensure the sustainability of the SEE and avoid

over-remuneration situations, while respecting the principle of a reasonable rate of return.*”

The Respondent further contends that the “reasonable rate of return” is a two-way mandate:
the remuneration for the investor must be reasonable but the cost allocation that the said
return represents for the consumer must also be reasonable, as set forth in the Preamble to

RD 661/2007.

In this regard, the Respondent explains that the reasonable rate of return “cannot be infinite
as its aim is to guarantee a level playing field for renewable energy producers but it cannot
place them in a more competitive position than non-subsidised producers.” Therefore, the
Government’s discretional power was in fact limited by the 1997 Electricity Law. This is “a
tule with the force of law that allowed the Government to adapt the remuneration to changing
circumstances by means of hierarchically inferior measures that are easily amended: the
regulations.”?!°

The Respondent further affirms that the disputed measures were adopted respecting the
principles set forth in the 1997 Electricity Law, including the need to ensure sustainability
and balance of the SES. Since the essential nature of the regulatory framework in which the
Claimants invested has been maintained, the Respondent argues that it has not breached its

obligation to provide “stable conditions” for the Claimants’ investments.*!!

In this regard, the Respondent points to the reform of 2013, which maintained “the subsidies
and the priority of dispatch, by allowing the following investments in RE to be recovered,
[for] ‘standard installations’ [based on]: (i) investment costs, (ii) operation costs and also,
(iii) to be obtained according to the cost of money on capital markets.”?!”

Comparing the remuneration model established by the current regulation and the model in
force when the Claimants made their investment, the Respondent concludes that the measures

maintain the essential elements of the previous system and cover the investment costs of all

0 RPHB, paras. 57, 59.

32 RCM, para. 880; RPHB, para. 98.

97

the Claimants’ investments, except for the Arenales plant, where the deviation in investment

costs is due to the fact that the plant was “blatantly cost-inefficient.

313

307. The Respondent further concludes the following:

a.

“Tt has maintained the concept of efficiency pursued by the SEE since
1997, which consists of providing electricity to Spanish consumers at
the lowest possible cost.

It has maintained the subsidies to renewable energies as a cost of the
SEE and, therefore, linked to its economic sustainability.

It has maintained and improved the priority of access and dispatch for
REs [installations].

It has maintained the basic structure of the Spanish remuneration model,
consisting of allowing RE plants to reach a Reasonable Return by
combining two elements: market price (pool) and a subsidy.

It has maintained the characteristic attributes of the principle of
Reasonable Return: its equilibrium and dynamism.

It has restored the equilibrium of the SEE by eliminating situations that
generated unjustifiable remunerations, such as the indexation of all the
elements that integrate the subsidy or CPI or the adjustments arising
from the pool plus premium option.

It has maintained the dynamic character of Reasonable Return [which
makes it possible to protect the value of the investment over time,
consequently endowing it with greater stability]. Therefore, the
reasonability of the return continues to be assessed in accordance with
the price of money on the capital market (the price of the Spanish ten-
year bond). [...]

 

It has maintained and improved the methodology historically followed
by the SEE to establish the Reasonable Return, consisting of the
determination of types of facilities and standards.

It continues to provide RE plants with Reasonable Return. The return
provided by the Spanish remuneration model is better than the discount

313 RPHB, paras. 76-78.

98

rate (opportunity cost) of the sector and, specifically, better than the
discount rate (opportunity cost) of the Claimant. Consequently, the
return that continues to be provided by the Spanish system is
reasonable.”>!4
308. The Respondent then examines, and rejects, the Claimants’ allegations regarding the
purported retroactivity of the measures.*!> In this sense, the Respondent distinguishes
between the immediate application of a regulation and its retroactive application affecting
acquired rights. The Respondent submits that for a regulation to be retroactive it must affect
acquired rights. This differs from regulations that apply to future events “in relation to legal
situations under way” but that do not affect rights already acquired, as any remuneration

previously received is intangible and not susceptible to any claim.

309. To advance its interpretation of “retroactivity”, the Respondent relies on the cases Nations
Energy v. Panama, Charanne v. Spain and Isolux v. Spain, as well as decisions from the
Spanish Supreme Court.*!© The Respondent further refers to rulings of the Spanish Supreme
Court handed in 2015 and 2016 declaring that the measures adopted on the basis of RD Law

9/2013 are not retroactive.>!”

310. In further support of this submission, the Respondent points to decisions of the Spanish
Supreme Court on the legality of RD 413/2014 and Order IET/1045/2014 which analysed
the possible infringement of the ECT. The decision claims that the new legal regime retains

the essential lines of the previous legal regime.*!*

311. The Respondent asserts that the Claimants have never had an acquired right to a future

remuneration by means of a fixed and unchanging FIT. In particular, the Respondent submits

that it “had the discretional power, pursuant to [Law] 54/1997, to modify the economic
regime of RE producers in order to adapt it to the changing economic and technical
circumstances. Therefore, the RE producers could not have had an acquired right to the
maintenance of the economic regime contained in a specific regulation.”*!° In addition, “[t]he
inexistence of an acquired right to the maintenance of the economic regime under RD
661/2007 was already discussed by the Supreme Court prior to the time the Claimants made
their investment, and all the operators in the SES knew this.”°2°

Thus, in the Respondent’s view, no retroactive measures in relation to the framework of the
RD 661/2007 have been adopted.*?! Moreover, the Respondent contends that taking into
consideration Claimants’ investments past cash flows to determine the project’s reasonable
return does not render the New Regime retroactive. The Respondent explains that to
determine a project’s total return one must consider all the present and future cash flows
throughout the entire regulatory lifespan of the assets. Thus, even if past cash flows must be
taken into account, it is “only for the purposes of calculating all the cash flows accrued and,
under no circumstances, to require that income earned in the past be returned or to necessarily
reduce income for the future.”*??

For that reason, the Respondent has not violated the duty of creating stable and predictable

conditions.*73

With regard to the autonomous character of the stability principle, once more, the Tribunal
considers that the Parties have embarked in a lengthy discussion of an artificial issue (at least
in the circumstances of this case): Spain, by virtue of Article 10(1) ECT, is under the
obligation to “encourage and create stable [...] conditions for Investors of other Contracting
Parties to make Investments in its Area”, whether this obligation is part of the FET or is
autonomous.?”4 And such an obligation cannot be read in isolation. In this respect, the present

Tribunal fully concurs with the Eiser Award:

“Taking account of the context and of the ECT’s object and purpose, the
Tribunal concludes that Article 10(1)’s obligation to accord fair and
equitable treatment necessarily embraces an obligation to provide
fundamental stability in the essential characteristics of the legal regime
relied upon by investors in making long-term investments.”*?°

Stability is not an absolute concept; absent a clear stabilization clause, it does not equate with
immutability. In this respect the Tribunal notes that the Claimants do not take such an
extreme view.**° However, the obligation to create a stable environment certainly excludes
any unpredictable radical transformation in the conditions of the investments. The question
therefore is whether the obligation of stability thus defined has been violated by the

Respondent to the detriment of the Claimants.*2”

The Arbitral Tribunal accepts the general finding made by the tribunal in the Eiser case in

this respect:

“This does not mean that regulatory regimes cannot evolve. Surely they can.
‘[T]he legitimate expectations of any investor [...] [have] to include the real
possibility of reasonable changes and amendments in the legal framework,
made by the competent authorities within the limits of the powers conferred

on them by the law.’ However, the Article 10(1) obligation to accord fair
and equitable treatment means that regulatory regimes cannot be radically
altered as applied to existing investments in ways that deprive investors who
invested in reliance on those regimes of their investment’s value.”?7*

317. As the ICSID tribunal in Blusun aptly noted:

“362. A breach of an obligation to ‘encourage and create stable, equitable,
favourable and transparent conditions for Investors’ including ‘to accord at
all times ... fair and equitable treatment’ could be breached by a single
transformative act aimed at an investment, or by a program of more minor
measures, or by a series of measures taken without plan or coordination but
having the prohibited effect.

363. But the fair and equitable treatment standard which, by virtue of the
second sentence [of Article 10(1) ECT], is at the core of the obligation of
stability under the first sentence has a relatively high threshold. The E/ Paso
tribunal spoke of ‘a total alteration of the entire legal setup for foreign
investments’, and added that ‘all the different elements and guarantees just
mentioned can be analysed as a special commitment of Argentina that such
a total alteration would not take place.’*2? The tribunal in LG&E spoke of
‘completely dismantling the very legal framework constructed to attract
investors.’**° The emphasis is on the subversion of the legal regime.”**!

318. The crucial regulation in the present case, the legal text essentially invoked by the Claimants,
is RD 661/2007. No more than the ECT itself, this document contains a stability clause
guaranteeing the immutability of the conditions of the investments. Article 44(3) of RD
661/2007 provides as follows:

“During the year 2010, on sight of the results of the monitoring reports on
the degree of fulfilment of the Renewable Energies Plan (PER) 2005-2010,
and of the Energy Efficiency and Savings Strategy in Spain (E4), together
with such new targets as may be included in the subsequent Renewable
Energies Plan 2011-2020, there shall be a review of the tariffs, premiums,
supplements and lower and upper limits defined in this Royal Decree with
regard to the costs associated with each of these technologies, the degree of
participation of the special regime in covering the demand and its impact
upon the technical and economic management of the system, and a

reasonable rate of profitability shall always be guaranteed with reference to

the cost of money in the capital markets. Subsequently a further review shall

be performed every four years, maintaining the same criteria as previously.”
These provisions as well as those of Articles 4 and 5 of RD 1614/2010 show that adjustments
were to be envisaged. The same holds true regarding the indications given in the name of the

Respondent.

The Tribunal acknowledges that undertakings or assurances given by the State can be explicit
or implicit.*** However, as noted in Blusun, “informal representations can present
difficulties, which is why tribunals have increasingly insisted on clarity and the appropriate
authority to give undertakings binding on the state.”**

In the present case, the Tribunal is of the view that none of the representations invoked by
the Claimants can be considered as firm pledges not to change the conditions of the
investments in such a way as to neutralize the clear possibility of modification resulting from
Articles 4 and 5 of RD 1614/2010. Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal agrees with the Charanne
Award that, “in the absence of a specific commitment an investor cannot have the legitimate
expectation that the regulation in place is going to remain unchanged.” As a consequence, it
is incumbent on this Tribunal to determine whether the changes in the regulations equate to

a substantial change to the legal framework applicable to investors.

This calls for a general remark: in the view of the Tribunal, in the present case, the Claimants
can prevail themselves of an acquired right to a general regime guaranteeing the essential
advantages they could reasonably expect when they made their investments. The importance
of the extent of the alterations suffered by the Claimants to the conditions of their investments

must therefore be assessed taking into account the global balance of costs and benefits which

103

they could reasonably expect compared with that which can be expected on the basis of the

ulterior modifications.
323. In acase similar to the present, an arbitral tribunal stated:

“Claimants could not reasonably expect that there would be no change
whatsoever in the RD 661/2007 regime over three or four decades. As with
any regulated investment, some changes had to be expected over time.*™4
However, Article 10(1) of the ECT entitled them to expect that Spain would
not drastically and abruptly revise the regime, on which their investment
depended, in a way that destroyed its value. But this was the result of RDL
9/2013, Law 24/2013, RD 413/2014 and implementation of the new regime
through Ministry implementing Order IET/1045/2014.*** As it was put in
Parkerings: ‘any businessman or investor knows that laws will evolve over
time. What is prohibited however is for a State to act unfairly, unreasonably
or inequitably in the exercise of its legislative power.’**°.”3°7

324. In the opinion of this Tribunal, the question whether or not the Respondent exercised its
legislative power unfairly, unreasonably or inequitably in the present case cannot be
answered at this stage of the reasoning: the answer depends (i) on the scope and content of
the legitimate expectations of the Claimants when they made their investments and (ii) on

whether or not the changes can be held as being reasonable and proportionate.
ii. On the retroactivity of the challenged measures

325. There is, however, one aspect of the case, on which the Arbitral Tribunal has no hesitation

to find that the Respondent acted in breach of its obligation to respect the principle of stability

which, as recalled above,>** is a required obligation under the ECT, in that the challenged

measures are partly retroactive.

326. Although the new rules apply for the future, there is nevertheless an obvious element of

retroactivity in the new regime. As recalled in Mondev v. USA:

“The basic principle is that a State can only be internationally responsible
for breach of a treaty obligation if the obligation is in force for that State at
the time of the alleged breach. The principle is stated both in the Vienna
Convention on the Law of Treaties**? and in the ILC’s Articles on State
Responsibility,*#° and has been repeatedly affirmed by international
tribunals.”3!

327. The Respondent relies on Charanne and Nations Energy to claim that there can be no
retroactivity when a norm only applies to the future effects of past events. These awards do
not help its case. In Charanne, the Tribunal did not specifically address the issue of the claw-
back under the New Regime. Considering the 2010 measures, it refused to see any
retroactivity since “the 2010 regulations applied immediately, from their entry into force, to
the plants already in operation, and that they did not apply retroactively to previous time

periods.”*4? Even more specifically, the Tribunal in Nations Energy explained that:

“644. Such requirements only apply to the future and cannot have the effect
of nullifying or revoking retroactively reduce deductions already made from
income tax for previous years.

647. Law 6 would have been retroactive, and therefore contrary to the

deductions previously made, or if it had cancelled such deductions due to

lack of the expected declaration, or if it had deducted existing credits. This

is not the case since Law 6 only affects the way in which appropriations are

used in the future.”*3
The present case is different. Indeed, the Respondent’s New Regime applies only for future
remuneration, but it subtracts past remuneration (remuneration that was due under the
previous regime) from the future remunerations. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that

this measure has the effect of clawing-back past remuneration that is shareholders’ acquired

rights when this remuneration was realised.

In commercial practice, dividends are distributed periodically to shareholders. Once
distributed, they are autonomous income, belonging to each shareholder as a consolidated
profit and separate and distinct from the investment that generates them. They are the objects
of autonomous rights to property of the shareholders. Shareholders have an acquired right
over the dividends paid to them. The same holds true in the present case: the Claimants’
profits are reduced by part of the benefits already realised before 14 July 2013 in order to
contribute to funding future plants. In effect, the rights of the investors must be preserved not
only in the past but also for the future. In the present case, this implicates the questions both
of the extent to which the stability principle applies and of the content of the legitimate

expectations of the Claimants.

However, and in any case, to the full extent that the contested measures have been applied
retroactively, such retroactive application, contrary to the Respondent’s obligations, must

result in an appropriate compensation for the damage that breach caused to the Claimants.

2. The Claimants’ alleged legitimate expectations
a. The Parties’ Positions

i. The Claimants’ Position

Claimants contend that even if the ECT does not contain a stabilization clause, and Spain
was permitted to make changes to its regime under the ECT, those changes must have been

predictable and in line with investor’s expectations.*+

Moreover, the Claimants clarify that they do not consider that the obligation to accord FET
means that a host State must completely freeze its regulatory regime. Instead, they consider
that, pursuant to its obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment, the State accepts certain
limitations on its power to alter the regulatory framework applicable to investments. This
includes, inter alia, not enacting measures that would be unfair, unreasonable, and
inequitable, or that would undermine an investor’ s legitimate expectations.*#° The Claimants
rely on the findings by the tribunals in CMS v. Argentina, Occidental v. Ecuador, LG&E v.
Argentina and PSEG v. Turkey, for the proposition that “one particularly important element
of legitimate expectations is the protection from State action that threatens the stability of the
legal and business framework upon which an investor reasonably relied on making its
investment.” 4°

For the Claimants, that legal framework typically consists of legislation, treaties and
assurances contained in decrees or licenses, even if there is no specific undertaking to
individual investors.*4” Accordingly, the Claimants submit that legitimate expectations may
be based on general rules and host-State’s laws can give rise to legitimate expectations, even

absent a specific commitment.**

In the Claimants’ view, “Spain’s responsibility for its violation of the FET standard arises
regardless of its motives, and irrespective of any showing of bad faith” and conversely “a
showing of good faith or legitimate cause on Spain’s part does not excuse a violation of the

FET standard.”*4°
Moreover, the Claimants submit that:

“[I]t is not disputed that a State can change its laws if it chooses to. The
question is whether it was reasonable for RREEF to expect that Spain would
not make severe and harmful changes to the FIT for existing investments in
breach of the clear and repeated promises it made to RREEF. This is the
notion of could versus would, which Spain has failed to address in this
arbitration.”>°°

According to the Claimants, the analysis of legitimate expectations is a “fact specific
enquiry,” which comports determining the following questions: first, whether the State’s
conduct and representation gave rise to expectations; second, whether the expectations are
legitimate and reasonable; third, the investor must show that it relied on the State’s conduct

and representations; and, fourth, its expectations were frustrated by the measures in dispute.

First, with regard to their expectations, the Claimants allege that they were twofold and relate
to: (a) the nature, amount and duration of the FIT offered under RD 661/2007 and RD
1614/2010; and (b) with respect to the stability of the RD 661/2007 economic regime.**!

Regarding the nature, amount and duration of the FIT, the Claimants expected to be subject
to the FIT regime at the time they made their investments, since the installations complied
with the registration requirements. For Arenales Solar, their expectations that the FIT would

apply for the operational lifetime of the installation was even confirmed, so the Claimants

“9 CM, para. 436.

351 CM, para. 447.

339.

108

352

contend, by a direct resolution from the Ministry.”°” Accordingly, the Claimants allege to

have expected that:***

- The Project Companies would have a choice between selling electricity at a Fixed
Tariff or at the Premium;

- The FIT would apply to all of the electricity produced, without any limitations on
production;

- The FIT would apply for the entire operational life of the Installations;

- The CSP Plants would be able to employ equipment that uses natural gas to produce
electricity and the electricity using natural gas would be subject to the FIT, with the
threshold limitations set out in RD 661/2007;

- The CSP Plants would have priority of dispatch; and

- The FIT would be subject to inflation adjustments in accordance with the CPI.

On the stability of the regime, the Claimants expected that any changes to RD 661/2007
would only apply prospectively, i.e., to the new installations, while existing installations
would remain unaffected. They further assert that RD 661/2007 guaranteed that any review
of the Fixed Tariff would not apply to existing installations and that in the case of the
Premium option, although the amount of the Premium could change, the minimum revenue
would not change, as any modification of the cap and floor would not apply to existing

installations.**4

Second, the Claimants consider that the legitimacy of their expectations is proved by

355

international practice on FITs,** as well as by Spain’s own internal documentation,*~°

In-person meetings between senior Spanish government officials and RREEF (and

Claimants, at the time of the investments Spain’s public officials provided specific
assurances that the regime would remain unchanged for existing CSP and wind
installations. In the course of several meetings, officials also stated that any future
changes or adjustments “would not be to the detriment of current investors” and
that the “protection given under Article 4 is unique in Spanish regulatory history”

and only the CSP and wind technologies would benefit from this support.*”

in the Spanish RE sector.**!

expected potential changes to the RD 661/2007, on the basis of a so-called concept of
“dynamic” reasonable return on the investments. This would have required accepting that
Spain could make changes if it determined that the installations profits were unreasonable as

362 Moreover, the Claimants

a result of changes in the cost of money on capital markets.
clarify that they “don’t deny that in setting tariffs in a feed-in-tariff regime, a regulator has
in mind a standard installation and a reasonable return. What [they] do deny is that if the cost
of money in the capital markets goes down, you can change the remuneration for the new
projects.”3

The Claimants also submit that even if the concept of “reasonable profitability” is
incorporated in the 1997 Electricity Law, this is not a concept directed to the investors but to
the regulator when setting the specific tariffs. This stems from the preamble of RD 661/2007,
which was the legal instrument setting forth the economic framework that guarantees a

reasonable return.*°4

To the contrary, the Claimants consider “legitimate” and “reasonable” their expectations on
the application of the RD 661/2007 economic regime to the entirety of the production and
the lifetime of the CSP plants and wind parks, for various reasons, including that: (a) the FIT
regime had been offered under a “royal decree’; (b) the RD 661/2007 economic regime was
part of a wider international and domestic policy to develop RE power generation
infrastructure; (c) the expectations that such regime would apply for the remaining of the
lifetime of the investment was further confirmed with Spain’s own conduct in 2008, 2009,
2010 (with the July 2010 Agreement and RD 1614/2010) and 2011 (specific oral and written
commitments to RREEF); (d) RREEF conducted a thorough due diligence process
confirming the applicability of the economic regime under RD 661/2007, for the operational

lifetime of the installations.*°

The Claimants contend that not only would the Claimants not invest in such circumstances
but also that Spain has failed to prove that (a) Spain’s “dynamic” reasonable return theory
has evidential basis, (b) that RREEFs earnings were unreasonable, thus justifying a change
in remuneration, or (c) that the cost of money on capital markets had changed between 2007

and 2013.5

Fourth, it is also the Claimants’ positions that their expectations were frustrated through a

process extending over two years and comprising several measures, including:

Spain’s withdrawal of the FIT for electricity production using natural gas under Law
15/2012 frustrate the expectations that the Project Companies would be entitled to

payment under the FIT for all the electricity produced.

The 7% levy measure constitutes a disguised cut to the FIT and is in contradiction with

the level of FIT the Project Companies would be entitled to under RD 661/2007.

The elimination of the Premium under RDL 2/2013 frustrates the Claimants’
expectations to have a choice between selling at Fixed Tariff or at the market prices

plus Premium.

The replacement by the CPI-linked updated mechanism for the FIT by a lower index,
via RDL 2/2013 frustrates the expectations that the FIT would be updated during the

life of the FIT as to reflect variations of the general CPI.**”

As a result, according to the Claimants, the Respondent has eviscerated the key
characteristics of RD 661/2007 and the legal framework it had previously guaranteed,
entitling Claimants to reparation for breach of its obligation to respect Claimants legitimate

expectations and provide FET.**

In opposition to the Respondent’s submissions, the Claimants further allege that “exhaustive
due diligence” is not necessary to make a claim of legitimate expectations and such a standard
is not supported by the Charanne v. Spain or Isolux v. Spain awards. They further consider
that, even if a particular standard of due diligence were part of the analysis, RREEF would
satisfy a high standard of due diligence, which included face-to-face meetings with high level

officials who confirmed that RREEFs due diligence was correct.*”

ii. |The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent relies on findings by the tribunals in Plama v. Bulgaria, AES v. Hungary,
Electrabel vy. Hungary and Charanne v. Spain to assert that “in the absence of a specific
commitment to stability, an [i]nvestor cannot have an expectation that a regulatory framework

such as the one discussed in this arbitration will not be amended.”3”°

The Respondent, however, agrees with the Claimants that to establish a FET violation, the
investors must demonstrate that the expectations allegedly frustrated are legitimate, by
showing that they are reasonable and objective as regards the existing regulatory
framework.*”! The Parties also agree that such legitimate expectations must be assessed at

the time the investment is made, and thus limited to the period of February to August 2011.77

According to the Respondent, the Arbitral Tribunal needs to analyse whether the foreign
investors had knowledge about the general regulatory framework at the time of the
investment, i.e., the regulatory framework per se, how it is applied and then how it affects its
investment. These expectations are to be reasonable, justified and objective following the

appropriate due diligence by the investors. In addition, the investors must be aware of

371 RPHB, para. 54; RR, para. 883; CR, para. 485.

3” RR, para. 883; CR, para. 485. In support of its position, the Respondent further relies on Investmart v. Czech Republic,
as an authority determine what circumstances must be considered by a tribunal when analysing the Claimants’ legitimate
expectations. See RR, para. 895, citing Investmart, B.V. v. Czech Republic, UNCITRAL, Award, 26 June 2009, paras.
250-258 (RL-74). See also Tr. Day 2 (Moraleda), 48:6-12.

potential risks with respect to their investments.*”? The Respondent relies on the award of
Charanne v. Spain to indicate that an investor’s legitimate expectations must be assessed via
an objective standard or analysis and that “[a] mere subjective belief that the investor could

have had at the time of making the investment does not suffice”.*”

352. Hence, for the Respondent, all investors that invest in Spain have an inexcusable obligation
to know about the general regulatory framework which governs investments and includes the

standards and case-law applicable to their investments.

353. The Respondent considers that the Claimants’ expectations, as expressed during the
proceedings, consist of (a) the immutability of the economic rights and the remuneration
regime established by RD 661/2007 for existing installations and (b) a right to receive future
regulated tariffs over the whole useful life of the Plants.*”°

354. With regard to the CSP sector, the Respondent posits that the expectations are based on the
Claimants’ incorrect and cursory analysis of the Spanish legal framework and the erroneous
interpretation of the disputed measures. In support of this position, it relies on several reports
issued by legal and financial advisors to the Claimants during the pre-investment phase,

including the Péyry and SJB reports and the Herbert Smith Memorandum.*”°

355. With regard to the Claimants’ investment in the wind farm, the Respondent asserts that the
Claimants failed to perform the necessary due diligence after significant changes to the
regulatory framework took place in 2009 and 2010. The lack of due diligence means that the

expectation alleged by the Claimants cannot be deemed real and objective or legitimate.*””

356. Accordingly, in the Respondent’s view, the Claimants’ lack of understanding of the legal

framework setting forth the remuneration regime and the regulated tariffs, or the absence of

a comprehensive analysis thereof, justify characterizing the Claimants’ expectations as
“unreasonable” and thus the Claimants’ claim must be dismissed. The Respondent further
clarifies that investors in a highly-regulated sector, such as the energy one, are expected to
perform a “high level” of due diligence, including a diligent analysis of the applicable legal

framework.”

357. Even if, arguendo, the Claimants performed a proper due diligence, the Respondent insists
that the disputed measures do not violate the objective legitimate expectations of the
Claimants. Relying on prior cases, including Plama v. Bulgaria and Charanne v. Spain, the
Respondent states that to have valid legitimate expectations, it would be necessary for it to
have made specific commitments to the investors, guaranteeing an immutable regulation.

Only such commitments could give rise to reasonable and justified expectations.*””

358. The Respondent insists that RD 661/2007 did not contain any promise or specific
commitment to the Claimants and their investments, regarding the future immutability of the
framework. The Respondent further asserts that neither RD 436/2004, RD Law 6/2009 nor
RD 1614/2010 contain any guarantee or promise to “petrify” the remuneration conditions
contained in RD 611/2007, or in the aforementioned regulations.**° According to the
Respondent, no diligently informed investor could expect these regimes to be the petrified in
their favour only because they fulfilled the regulatory requirements to obtain subsidies.**!
Nor could they expect that these conditions would be maintained indefinitely or improved at

any rate.>%

359. Further developing this statement, the Respondent considers that “it is impossible that any

investor could see in article 44.3 of RD 661/2007 or in articles 4 and 5.3 of RD 1614/2010 a

of their facilities”. See also RR, paras. 900-904, relying on Isolux (RL-95), and Charanne (RL-69).

stabilising clause, when all of them were mere copies of article 40.3 of RD 436/2004,
derogated years earlier by the same RD 661/2007.” The Respondent further provides a chart

comparing the provisions to prove its point.>**

In addition, the Respondent argues that in the absence of specific petrification commitments,
the Claimants’ alleged expectations must be considered unreasonable and unjustified. The
Tribunal should further consider the regulatory framework that was actually in place,
including the Supreme Court case-law, which further asserts that no investor could have had
a legitimate expectation of freezing the regulatory framework.**4 The Respondent also points
to myriad statements by the relevant business associations, including APPA and AAE, for
CSP and wind, indicating their understanding that the economic regime of the installations
operating under the Special Regime, including the premiums, could be modified, and had
actually suffered detrimental modifications for existing installations when RD 436/2004 was
derogated by RD 661/2007.**° The Respondent further underlines that during the transitional
period offered by RD 661/2007, where they could pick between the 436 and 661 regimes,
none of the wind farms switched, demonstrating thereby that the economic regime of RD

436/2004 was more beneficial and profitable.

The Respondent then asserts that there are eight essential principles governing the Spanish

regulatory framework:?°°

1. The regulatory system is governed by the principle of regulatory hierarchy and this
results in specific procedures, legally stipulated, to draft and implement regulations.

2. The regulatory framework is not limited to RD 661/2007 and RD 1614/2010 as claimed
by the Claimants. It is configured on the basis of Law 54/1997 and any regulatory
standards that have implemented it, including RD 2818/1998, RD 436/2004, RD
1578/2008, RD 1565/2010, RD 1614/2010 as interpreted by Case-law.

3. The fundamental principle that RE subsidies are a cost of the SES, subject to the principle

of economic sustainability of the same.

Right to priority of access and dispatch of electricity production.

The remuneration of the RE consists of a subsidy which, once added to the market price,
provides RE Plants with reasonable rate of return, in the context of its useful life,
according to capital markets, which has a dynamic and balanced nature within the SES.
This profitability was linked exclusively to the cost made in the construction and
operation of the plants.

The subsidies were determined according to developments in demand and other basic
economic data, expressed in the Renewable Energy Plans (including to investment and
operational costs of standard installations), to ensure that these installations are able to
reach a reasonable rate of return during their useful lives.

The regulatory changes to the remuneration regime of the RE have been motivated since
2004 (i) to correct situations of over-remuneration, or (ii) by the strong variation in the
economic data that served as the basis for the estimation of subsidies.

Neither RD 661/2007, nor RD 1614/2010, which apparently created the expectations of
the Claimants, contain any guarantee or promise to petrify their regime in favour of the

Claimants.

It is the Respondent’s position that the above principles constitute objective legitimate
expectations of a diligent investor. On the contrary, expectations that the Respondent would
not adopt measures to resolve any deficit or economic imbalance that affected the
sustainability of the SES, and rectify a situation of over-remuneration, are unreasonable.*°7
In addition, expectations that go against the understanding of renewable energy producers’
associations in Spain, *** or contrary to consolidated interpretations of the law by the Spanish

courts, cannot be considered reasonable either.**?

Additionally, the Respondent affirms that the expectations that the Claimants alleged to have

had, based on purported statements of the Respondent’s authorities are unreasonable. The

disputed statements are (i) a presentation created by InvestInspain in November 2008; (ii)
the alleged agreement of July 2010 and a related press release; (iii) various verbal and written

statement of the Respondent; and (iv) the RAIPRE registrations.*””

First, it is the Respondent’s position that the InvestInspain presentation is not relevant since

the Claimants did not see it before their investment — as they recognized.*?!

Second, the press release is said by the Respondent to merely report the consultation
procedure prior to RD 1614/2010 which does not contain petrification commitment of RD
661/2007. It only demonstrated that the situation required changes to the economic regime
established by RD 661/2007, that both the Government and system operators were aware of
that requirement and that nothing could have prevented the adoption of new adjustment
measures in 2013.59? Moreover, neither the Claimants’ advisors, nor the RE sector

associations, granted the alleged agreement a binding character.*”?

Third, regarding a series of verbal and written statements which supposedly led to legitimate
expectations, the Respondent states: (a) as to the emails with several investors summarizing
meetings held at the Ministry of Industry, they expressly stated that “nothing is written in
marble” in relation to the possibility of making regulatory changes, and constitute accounts
of a meeting by a third party and not statements attributable to the Kingdom of Spain**; (b)
regarding the alleged statements by the National Energy Commission (CNE), these are
reflected in a power point presentation which can hardly be attributed to the CNE and cannot
be said to have been reviewed by the Claimants; (c) as to the Andasol Plant Assessment

Memorandum, it summarizes contacts between the Claimants and officials of the Spanish

Government, at a time where the investment was already made and thus could hardly
constitute the basis of expectations leading to invest, *°° and (d) the March 2011 Resolution
2011, cannot be considered a commitment or even an administrative act, but instead a mere

act informing Arenales Solar of the remunerations conditions “currently” in force.*°”

In this respect, the Respondent also contends that “neither CNE, nor State lawyers in the
Ministry of Industry, nor the IDAE nor InvestSpain have authority to commit the regulatory
framework of the Kingdom of Spain. This authority exclusively corresponds to Parliament
(that legislates) and to the Spanish Government (that approves regulations).”*?*

Thus, the Claimants could not have based their legitimate expectations on the statements
from any of the aforementioned authorities, since (a) none of them constituted binding
commitments vis-d-vis the Claimants, and (b) none of them had the authority to bind the
Respondent.*”

Fourth, as it pertains to the RAIPRE registrations, the Respondent denies that this may
constitute a commitment guaranteeing the immovability of the RD 661/2007 economic
regime.*” In this sense, the Respondent asserts that the Supreme Court and the CNE, as well
as the associations of producers, have maintained that the registration in the RAIPRE is a

mere administrative requirement.**! The Respondent also explains:

“The registration in a special registry is imposed on all producers of
electricity, both renewable and conventional. The RAIPRE is the sub-
section of this registry in which the more than 60,000 owners of renewable
installations are registered.”

The Respondent further explains that:

“The Claimant has seen how the installations registered in the registry

created by RD 2818/1998 were affected by all the reforms of the retribution

regime operated since RD 436/2006, without the inclusion in the registry

being an obstacle to the application of the successive revisions to the

registered installations. Likewise, it has seen how the preregistered

photovoltaic installations under coverage of RD 1578/2008 have been

affected by RD 1565/2010 and RD-Act 14/2010.4
Last, the Respondent asserts that even documentation prepared for the Claimants in view of
their impending investment, do not support the legitimate expectations presented to the
Arbitral Tribunal.“ These include legal reports prepared by SJB and Herbert Smith or the

report of the consultant firm Péyry.*°>

With regard to the latter, the Respondent highlights that the Claimants’ consultants even
warned them that “future changes might be implemented” and that “in response to certain
economic circumstances such as a failure to eliminate the tariff deficit in 2012, the regulator
would exercise its discretional power to attempt to rebalance the Spanish electricity
system.’ Similarly, the other reports do not confirm the immutability of the remuneration
conditions established in the regulatory framework. The legal reports drafted for the
Claimants address that point, and even one of them informed the Claimants that the
Government had the possibility of approving a regulation of equal or superior rank in the

future to modify RD 1614/2010.4””

The Respondent contends that, before making their investments, the Claimants knew that the
Government would continue to adopt measures to guarantee the sustainability of the SEE or

to bring an end to any detected situations of over remuneration.*°° The Respondent alleges

that the best evidence of this statement are clauses contained in financing contracts for the
plants in which the Claimants invested. Those clauses expressly addressed the potential risk

of regulatory change.*°°

The Parties are, in particular, in dispute as to the depth of the Claimants’ due diligence on
the Dédalo Project, and in particular, of SJB’s second report mentioned above. The Claimants
allege that before making its investment in 2011, RREEF conducted due diligence on the
Dédalo Project covering a variety of areas, including technical, financial, tax, insurance and
legal.*!° The Respondent alleges that it was a limited “confirmatory due diligence”, which
only sought to confirm certain information provided to RREEF’s Investment Committee
already in 2008, when RREEF had first thought of investing in the project. In particular, it
alleges that even though it failed to include a thorough study of the changes undergone by
the applicable legal framework, it had warned the Claimants that further amendments could

be foreseen. *"!

The Respondent contends that “Claimant cannot have the legitimate expectation that if the
Arenales solar thermal plant has an installed capacity higher than 50 MW, it can receive for

forty years the subsidies established by article 36 of RD 661/2007.”*!?

3

Furthermore, the Respondent relies on the State Aid Decision*!? according to which “a

recipient of State aid cannot, in principle, have legitimate expectations in the lawfulness of
aid that has not been notified to the Commission.”4!4

To conclude, the Respondent states that the legal, regulatory and market frameworks
available at the time the Claimants made their investments prove that they could not have
legitimate expectations of immutability of the remuneration regime and that, even if they had

such expectations, those expectations were unfounded and unreasonable.*!>

b. The Tribunal’s Analysis

378. The Arbitral Tribunal takes note of the Parties’ agreement that it is for the investors to
demonstrate that their expectations allegedly frustrated are legitimate, by showing that they

are reasonable and objective in the circumstances.

“Finally, legitimate expectations are more than the investor’s subjective
expectations. Their recognition is the result of a balancing operation of the
different interests at stake, taking into account all circumstances, including
the political and socioeconomic conditions prevailing in the host State.”4!°

379. The Tribunal has already ruled that the Claimants had no legitimate expectation that the
regime provided for in RD 661/2007 would remain unchanged throughout the term of the
investment.*!? The only — but crucial — question is therefore whether the challenged
modifications introduced after 2012 constitute “a drastic and radical change” — as the

Claimants put it — affecting unexpectedly the conditions of the investments.
380. This Tribunal shares the view expressed in the Charanne Award according to which

“The determination of whether the investor’s legitimate expectations have
been defeated must be based on an objective standard or analysis. The mere
subjective belief that the investor could have had at the time of making the
investment does not suffice. Similarly, the application of this principle
depends on whether the expectation has been reasonable or not in the
specific case. In this regard, the representations that may have been
presented by the host State to encourage the investment are relevant.”+!8

381. One of the core issues dividing the Parties in respect to the content of the legitimate
expectations of the Claimants when they made their investments concerns the question of
“reasonable return”. The Respondent seems to make this question the exclusive criterion for

assessing the respect for the stability and predictability requirements. According to this

122

Tribunal, a reasonable return or profitability was, no doubt, part of the guarantees given to

the Claimants — and, more generally, to all investors in the Spain’s RE.
382. Thus, Article 30(4) of Law 54/1997 provided:

“4. The remuneration arrangements for electric power generation
installations operating under the special regime shall be supplemented by
the payment of a premium under statutory terms set out in regulations [...]

‘To work out the premiums, the voltage level on delivery of the
power to the network, the effective contribution to environmental
improvement, to primary energy saving and energy efficiency, the
generation of economically justifiable useful heat and the investment
costs incurred shall all be taken into account so as to achieve
reasonable profitability rates with reference to the cost of money on

capital markets’.” (emphasis added).

383. And the preamble of RD 661/2007 itself guaranteed to “the owners of facilities under the
special regime a reasonable return on their investments” while the Renewable Energy Plan
2011-2020, adopted some months before the date when the Claimants made their
investments, recalls that “premiums corresponding to special regime installations, provide
for electricity generation remuneration levels that afford a reasonable return on

investment.”*!? More precisely this document indicates:

“Review of remuneration: [...] [The] remuneration amounts [...] may be
modified on the basis of technological developments within the sectors,
market behaviour, [...], while always guaranteeing reasonable rates of
return.”40

384. Thus, the Tribunal concludes that the guarantee of “reasonable return” or “reasonable

profitability” was the main specific commitment of Spain vis-a-vis the investors in the

Special Regime.

20 Ibid., p. 115 (emphasis added).

385.

386.

387.

123

Tt must, however, be noted that, in all the relevant texts, this assurance of a reasonable return
or profitability is systematically intertwined with other considerations. Thus RD 661/2007
also enunciates the complementary principle according to which electricity consumers are
ensured “an equally fair allocation [...] of the costs that can be attributed to the electricity
system.”4?! For its part, the Renewable Energy Plan 2011-2020 provides that “these reviews
take account of cost trends associated with each technology with three objectives in mind: to
see that renewable technologies become as competitive as possible with Ordinary Regime
generation, to foster a technological development balance and to see that the remunerative
scheme moves in the direction of minimising socio-economic and environmental costs”.*?2
In other words, the reasonable return ensured to the investors — which guarantees them at a
minimum against any financial loss — must be assessed keeping in mind the Respondent’s
concern about the cost of electricity and the competitiveness with other means of production

of energy.

On the applicable legal standard, the Tribunal concludes that the only legitimate expectation
of the Claimants was to receive a reasonable return for its investment.*2> However, this aim
was achieved through particular means designed at attracting investments in a sector which
was unattractive at market prices; hence the various advantages granted to the producers
under the special regime (including the Claimants), notably the FIT that generated important
revenue streams and other advantages like the unconditional right of priority of grid access

and priority of dispatch.

The Claimants cannot prevail themselves of a fixed rate of return for their investment.
However, the Arbitral Tribunal is of the view that, whatever the means chosen by the
Respondent, the Claimants could legitimately expect a return for their investment at a

reasonable rate which implies significantly above a mere absence of financial loss, the precise

#21 See also RD 436/2004 (C-64) (R-116), Preamble: “the Royal Decree guarantees operators of special regime
installations fair remuneration for their investments and an equally fair allocation to electricity consumers of the costs
that can be attributed to the electricity system” (emphasis added).

124

average rate taking into account the actual cost of money on capital markets for such

investments as well as other objectives.*7*

With regard to the method for assessing the existence and extent of the potential violation of
the legitimate expectation of the Claimants, the Arbitral Tribunal agrees with the Claimants’
position according to which the analysis of legitimate expectations is a “fact specific enquiry”
which requires determining the following questions: first, whether the State’s “conduct and
representations gave rise to expectations”; second, whether the expectations are legitimate
and reasonable; third, the investor must show that it relied on the State’s conduct or
representations; and, fourth, its “expectations were frustrated by the Disputed Measures”.4?°
The Tribunal also accepts the compatible and complementary remark by the Respondent
according to which these expectations “must be assessed objectively and reasonably’”*”°.

Although these questions are crucial, the Tribunal can deal with them rather briefly since
parts of the answers directly or indirectly result from previous rulings already made by the

Tribunal in previous paragraphs of this Decision.

It can certainly be said in the present case that the State’s conduct and representation gave
rise to legitimate expectations,*?’ regardless of the “umbrella clause” in the last sentence of
Article 10(1) ECT,*?* insofar as the Claimants were entitled to expect that the Respondent
would not significantly modify the legal framework applicable to the investors as provided

for in its domestic law at the time when the investments were made.*”?

In this respect, the Tribunal agrees with the Novenergia tribunal when it stated that:

“The legitimate expectations of an investor has generally been considered
to be grounded in the legal order of the host State as it stands at the time the

“24 See supra para. 385.

investor acquires or makes the investment. Arbitral tribunals seized with the
task of determining the relevant timing of the legitimate expectations of an
investor have stressed that the legal framework of the host State as it existed
at the time of making the investment is decisive for any legitimate
expectations.”4°°
392. The Novenergia tribunal made a careful comparison of the Charanne, Isolux and Eiser cases
and highlighted the differences between the three cases (all opposing investors in the energy
sector to Spain) according to the date on which the investment was made.**! After
distinguishing Charanne in which “the arbitral tribunal was only confronted with the
legislation enacted by the Kingdom of Spain until 2010 (namely RD 1565/2010 and RDL
14/2010)"4*, that tribunal concluded that it was in order to make a distinction between
investments made in 2007 (which was the case in Eiser and Novenergia) on the one hand and
those of 2012 (/solux) on the other hand. In the latter case, the tribunal noted that the

investment had been made:

“at a stage when it must have been clear to the investor that changes were
being made to the Special Regime. Even if such changes may not have
reached the level of a breach of the FET standard, they certainly must have
been an indication to the investor in /solux that significant changes were
being made to the Special Regime as set out in RD 661/2007.”43

This holds true as well in the present case where the Claimants’ investments were made

between February and August 2011.44

393. The Claimants insist on the importance of RD 1614/2010 in their decision to invest in Spain
without distinguishing clearly their case from /solux and without explaining which new
elements would have changed the legitimate expectations of investors between July 2011 and

October 2012.4

394. At that time, the Respondent cannot be held as having given an assurance that the Claimants’
“Ti]nstallations, once qualified in the RAIPRE, would receive the RD661/2007 FIT regime
for their operational lifetimes, with future changes to apply only to new installations.”4*°

Indeed, the Tribunal notes that RD 661/2007 only anticipated changes in the RE with the

limitation provided for in Article 44(3) according to which:

“The revisions to the regulated tariff and the upper and lower limits
indicated in this paragraph shall not affect facilities for which the deed of
commissioning shall have been granted prior to 1 January of the second year
following the year in which the revision shall have been performed.”

395. However, as with all other advantages recognized in the Royal Decree, this did not imply an
everlasting exemption of any revision of the regulated tariff. Simply (but importantly) the
changes to be adopted in the future could not significantly modify the legal framework
applicable to investors**” — including the pledge not to put into question the commitment
concerning the reasonable return, a criterion which must be assessed globally, taking into
account the object and purpose of RD 661/2007 as expressed in its Preamble.*** The same
reasoning applies with regard to RD 436/2004 (Article 40) and RD 1614/2010 (Articles 4

439

and 5). Moreover, as recalled above,*”” there is no international obligation on a State to waive

or to decline to exercise its regulatory power.

396. Besides the general policy exposed in RD 661/2007 and RD 1614/2010, the Tribunal is not
convinced that any other document could have generated stronger or different expectations

to the benefit of the Claimants:

+440

- The “international practice for FITs' are merely a contextual element that cannot

generate legitimate expectations that the Respondent will not change its regulatory

framework;

127

- The preparatory documents of RD 661/2007 invoked by the Claimants only confirm the
content of RD 661/2007 but do not contain any specific commitment. Furthermore, it is
revealing that the Claimants mainly rely on documents issued in 2007, four years before their

investment in 2011,*4! when the Spanish economic context was quite different.

- Indeed InvestInSpain, a publicly-owned company, conducted a campaign to support
investment in RE in Spain and the documents from this organization praised the stability of
the premium system*? but these were very informal documents which can hardly be
considered as commitments of the State, especially vis-a-vis the Claimants which appear not

to have known them before their investments;

- The Press Release of the Spanish Government issued on 2 July 2010 does no more than

reiterating the content of RD 1614/2010;443

- The documents concerning the Claimants’ meetings with representatives of the Ministry
are mainly internal Claimants’ documents: the emails exchanged between RREEF, Antin,
Lazard and Deutsche Bank Madrid bear upon a meeting with the Ministry of Industry,
Tourism and Commerce, established by the Claimants;““4 the PowerPoint presentation on
Project Guadisol is made by RREEF itself** all these documents have a limited probative
value and do not go beyond confirming the general pledge for stability contained in RD
661/2007 (see, e.g., the warning in the email dated 20 May 2011: “this has to be taken with

some caution (‘nothing is written in marble’)”;

- The Claimants rely heavily on the Resolution of the Directorate-General for Energy and

Mining Policy.*° The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that it is merely an informative

document which lists the various texts in force but does not provide that the regime would

be maintained.

- The same can be said of the RAIPRE certificates issued for the Claimants’ installations’.

As the tribunal in Electrabel v. Hungary stated:

“Fairness and consistency must be assessed against the background of

information that the investor knew and should reasonably have known at

the time of the investment and of the conduct of the host State.”“48
In this respect, the Parties have had lengthy discussions on the “due diligence” performed (or
not) by the Claimants.“? In the Tribunal’s view, this is not relevant, when characterised as a
discussion of diligence. The Claimants’ diligence might have been due. However, due or not,
the Claimants were made aware that the Respondent’s legal regime was subject to possible
changes in the future.**° This is evidence of the fact that any expectation of the Claimants
that the applicable legal regime was never subject to any change whatsoever was not

legitimate.

To summarize: the Claimants had, when they made their investments, a legitimate
expectation to get a reasonable return on their investments. Such expectation did not include
a guarantee to have the legal regime in place unchanged until the end of the operation of the
plants, but it did include to have any modifications reasonable and equitable. Whether such
a legitimate expectation was violated can only be assessed by way of a global view of the
situation that resulted from the modifications introduced by the Respondent after the date of
the investment. It is only in case the answer to this question is in the affirmative that

compensation is due to the Claimants under this head of claim.

3. Transparency
a. The Parties’ Positions

i. The Claimants’ Position

Relying on the Tecmed v. Mexico, Electrabel v. Hungary and Plama v. Bulgaria cases, the
Claimants allege that the State’s conduct toward investors and the legal environment must
be free from ambiguity and uncertainty, for it not to be in breach of the FET standard.**!
Moreover, “when changes in policy are being contemplated that may ‘significantly affect
investments’, a State should be forthcoming with information about those changes to enable
an investor to plan.”4°? This, however, was not the case here, as RD 661/2007 economic

regime was dismantled in a non-transparent manner for the reasons explained below.

Concerning the facts of the case, first, according to the Claimants, RDL 9/2013 wiped out
the investment regime for the Claimants’ investments and was followed by an 11-month
Transitory Regime where plants were unable to forecast future cash flows and calculate the
precise remunerations that the plant would be entitled to.*?

Second, neither the June 2014 Order nor RD 413/2014 provided the underlying criteria or
any transparent analysis explaining the calculations behind the Special Payment and did not
offer guidelines on the various aspects of the New Regime set forth 11 months before, when

RDL 9/2013 was introduced.‘

Third, the fact that the Special Payment is calculated by reference to a Standard Installation
(i.e., not an actual plant but what the Respondent considers to be standard), creates further

uncertainties since the Respondent may alter part of the parameters of the Standard

451 CM, para. 468-470, referring to Técnicas Medioambientales Tecmed S. A. v. United Mexican States (ICSID Case

Installation every three or six years. And as a result, there is no clear visibility of the regime

that will apply later on.*°>

Fourth, the lack of visibility and predictability is further aggravated by the fact that under the
New Regime, the Respondent retains the right to review the Special Payment in order to
make sure that a “reasonable return” continues to apply to the investments. The Claimants
affirm that the Respondent has not established a methodology for adjusting the Special

Payment over the following Regulatory Periods.**°

Finally, the Respondent’s conduct was not transparent because the timeframe during which
the remuneration per MW of installed capacity will continue to apply under the Special
Payment is unclear (i.e., whether it will continue even if the Respondent considers that the
Standard Installation would have already earned a “reasonable return”). In addition, the
Respondent has failed to provide a transparent methodology for determining whether a plant

has earned reasonable profit.*°”

The Claimants also oppose the Respondent’s claims that the State Aid Decision would

welcome the transparency of the regime:

“The Decision merely recalls that Spain has agreed to publish ‘certain
information on a comprehensive State aid website’ .*°* There is no finding
with respect to the transparency of the Disputed Measures, let alone with
that of the process that led to their adoption.”4°?

ii. |The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent rejects the Claimants’ allegation that it failed to encourage and create

transparent conditions in violation of Article 10 of the ECT, for the reasons set forth below.*

The Respondent considers that the Claimants “once again makes the mistake of considering
that the ECT guarantees complete predictability of the regulatory framework of a State
during the time the entire investment remains valid, even if there is no commitment to
maintain it”*°'. The Respondent underlines that the Annulment Committee of the MTD v.
Chile case* questioned the interpretation of the foreign investor’s expectations by the
Tecmed v. Mexico tribunal. It further relies on the decision of the AES Summit tribunal to
conclude that a State doesn’t violate transparent conditions if it acts “within the acceptable

range of legislative and regulatory conduct.”*

Concerning the facts of the case, the Respondent’s arguments are threefold.

First, the Respondent followed all procedures established by law, without undue delays and
involving the legitimate stakeholders in the process. Statements by actors in the RE sector on
the drafts of RD 413/2014 and Ministry Order 1045/2014, contradict the Claimants’
statements that investors had been left in the “dark” for 11 months.***

Second, the Respondent announced the need to introduce reforms since 2009 following the
international economic crisis and the necessity to make the system sustainable. According to
the Respondent, the need for reform had been alluded to in the Preambles of RDL 6/2009,
the Report on RD 1614/2010 and RDL 14/2010, which referred to the decline in electricity

demand and the urgent rebalancing required for the SEE.“ The Respondent further points

to a declaration before Congress made by the Minister of Industry in January 2011, before
the Claimants’ investments, and then to Law 2/2011 of March 2011, as well as statements

from the newly elected President in late 2011, all announcing the need to reform the SES.*%°

Third, prior to adopting the measures under dispute, in February 2012, and then in 2014, and
in accordance with Spanish law procedures, interested parties and stakeholders of the SEE
were invited to participate in the process. In particular, they were invited to present
observations on the potential modifications through a number of hearing procedures, open
consultations processes, as well as invitations to comment on the drafts, which commenced
four months after the publication of RDL 9/2013. Neither the Claimants nor the installations
in which they invested presented claims. Industry associations such as the APPA and AEE
submitted numerous comments and claims on drafts of RD 413/2014 and the June 2014
Order, before it was enacted and comments were addressed and considered by the

regulator.*7

The Respondent submits that the aforementioned arguments show that Spain “fulfilled its
obligation to warn the foreign investor about the reasons that would justify regulatory
changes. It also fulfilled its obligation to announce the limits of these regulatory changes.”4%
The Respondent further contends that “[t]he possibility that the Respondent could modify the
regulatory framework to adapt it to the changing circumstances in Spain was also known by
all the operators in the system.”*©? Moreover, the measures were foreseeable by any diligent

investor, as recognized by the Spanish Supreme Court.*””

Thus, according to the Respondent, it has adopted a predictable and dynamic regulatory
system. In particular, the Respondent explains that Law 24/2013 and RD 413/2014 contain
rules that ensure that investors, at all times, receive a reasonable return on their facilities and

that the economic equilibrium of the RE projects is respected over time. Contrary to what is

stated by the Claimants, the Respondent highlights that the regulatory periods in the New
Regime are not discretionary. Instead, they are predictable periods regulated by Law, instead
of by decree. Consequently, the establishment of regulatory periods offers security to
investors and guarantees that a reasonable return would be maintained along with recovery
of the investment value. Thus, this constitutes an added element of security for investors that
confirms the Respondent’s respect of its obligation to promote transparent conditions.*”! The
Respondent also relies on the State Aid Decision which welcomes the transparency of the

regime*”.
b. The Tribunal’s Analysis

As explained above, the Arbitral Tribunal does not consider that lack of transparency would
constitute an autonomous breach of the FET standard embodied in Article 10(1) ECT.*”
However, even if it were the case, the practical consequence in law would be the same, in
that a lack of transparency would constitute a breach of Article 10(1). And, in any case, as

the Novenergia tribunal, this Tribunal considers that;

“With respect to the element of transparency, and in line with the tribunal in Plama!4™4),

the Tribunal considers this condition to be a significant element for ‘the protection of
both the legitimate expectations of the Investor and the stability of the legal
framework.’”
Having made these points, the Tribunal has not been persuaded by the Claimants’ argument
that there has been a breach of the principle of transparency: the possibility of an adjustment
of the applicable conditions is present in the relevant instruments and the changes have been

publicized and explained by the Respondent with sufficient care.

4. The Alleged Discriminatory Character of the Disputed Measures
a. The Parties’ Positions

i. The Claimants’ Position

According to the Claimants, Article 10(1) prohibits impairment measures that are either
unreasonable or discriminatory and it would suffice to show that Spain’s adverse measures

are either unreasonable or discriminatory to establish a breach of Article 10(1) of the ECT.*”°

Relying on the Saluka case, the Claimants further contend that to comply with the standard
of reasonableness the Respondent must show that its measures were (1) taken in pursuance

of a rational policy goal; and (2) they were carefully tailored to achieve that goal.*””

The Claimants posit that the same reasons that demonstrate the Respondent’s violation of the
FET standard (see paras. 336-338 above), are sufficient for the Tribunal to conclude that the
Respondent violated the Non-Impairment Clause. The Claimants also submit that a breach
of the Non-Impairment Clause, results in a simultaneous breach of the FET standard “as no
action of the host State can be fair or equitable if it is unreasonable or discriminatory.”*7

The Claimants note that by setting up a 7% levy on RE generators but not on installations
subject to the Ordinary Regime, the Respondent has applied discriminatory measures and

thus breached the Non-Impairment Clause.*”

The Claimants reject the interpretation of the series of tests set out in EDF v. Romania case
exposed by the Respondent in its submission for the same reasons expressed regarding the

reasonableness and proportionality standard, as explained further below.**°

ii. |The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent relies on several arbitral precedents to address both the non-discriminatory
and reasonable aspects of the measures as to match the compliance test with the Non-

Impairment Clause.**!

Citing three cases, namely EDF v. Romania, AES Summit Test v. Hungary and Total v.
Argentina, the Respondent states that it has passed the tests formulated under each case to
assess whether the measures adopted by a State are discriminatory and irrational in

contradiction to the objectives and purpose of the ECT.‘

In particular, it considers that the macroeconomic control measures were “reasonably related
to a rational policy” and thus complied with the standards formulated by the AES v. Hungary

tribunal and further confirmed by the Electrabel v. Hungary tribunal.***

Furthermore, the Respondent states that the discrimination alleged by the Claimants (between
renewable and conventional energy producers) has nothing to do with “the type of
discrimination (of the foreign investor compared to the domestic investor) that the ECT tries

to avoid.”**4

Spain also rejects the Claimants’ argument that the TVPEE is discriminatory because the
renewable energy producers cannot “pass on” the taxes to the consumers. The Respondent
emphasizes that the TVPEE does not discriminate between conventional and RE generators,
as Law 15/2012 grants the same treatment to those subject to it, irrespective of whether they
are RE or not. The Respondent contends that the economic impact of the TVPEE for these
renewable producers is neutralised as a result of the regulated retribution regime applicable

to the same. “85

136

For the Respondent, since the disputed measures’ aim is to resolve an unsustainable situation
of imbalance and avoid that consumers be excessively burdened by over-compensation, they
are justified as a rational policy adopted with the aim of addressing an issue of public interest.
Moreover, since the challenged reform is of a general scope and is applicable to all the
operators and sectors involved in the energy market, it does not discriminate against any
particular investor, whether domestic or foreign.**° Hence, the Respondent concludes that

these measures were not discriminatory. **’
b. The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal considers that FET encompasses the principle of non-discrimination and it will
analyse it as such for purposes of this case. However, had the ECT not contained an express
provision on FET or protecting investors against non-discrimination, this principle would

still be applicable on the basis of customary international law.

Therefore, there is no doubt that, whether as part of the FET or because of the express
mention in Article 10(1) ECT,*** the Claimants are entitled to be immune from
discriminatory measures. This principle is clarified in paragraph 3 of Article 10 of the ECT
which covers discrimination as against both national investors and those from any other State,

whether party to the ECT or not:

“For the purposes of this Article, ‘Treatment’ means treatment accorded by
a Contracting Party which is no less favourable than that which it accords
to its own Investors or to Investors of any other Contracting Party or any
third state, whichever is the most favourable.”

As noted in Parkerings v. Lithuania:

“Discrimination is to be ascertained by looking at the circumstances of the
individual cases. Discrimination involves either issues of law, such as
legislation affording different treatments in function of citizenship, or issues

486 RCM, para. 940.

487 RCM, paras. 940-941.

488 This Tribunal considers that it is indeed part of the FET standard as conceived by the ECT (see above para. 260) but
this has no concrete consequence in the present case.

431.

432.

489 Parkeri

137

of fact where a State unduly treats differently investors who are in similar

circumstances. Whether discrimination is objectionable does not in the

opinion of this Tribunal depend on subjective requirements such as the bad

faith or the malicious intent of the State: at least, Article IV of the Treaty

does not include such requirements. However, to violate international law,

discrimination must be unreasonable or lacking proportionality, for

instance, it must be inapposite or excessive to achieve an otherwise

legitimate objective of the State. An objective justification may justify

differentiated treatments of similar cases. It would be necessary, in each

case, to evaluate the exact circumstances and the context.” 489
The principle of non-discrimination requires a State to treat equally what is equal but it does
not require a State to treat equally that which is different. “Treating different categories of
subjects differently is not unequal treatment. The principle of equality only applies between
equal subjects, not between unequal subjects”*°°. This is also the reason why it is legally
acceptable to provide for positive discrimination or reverse discrimination, which departs of
the principle of formal equality in order to redress the situation of persons or groups when

they deserve special protection through a reasonable preferential treatment.

The Arbitral Tribunal notes that the Claimants consider that Law 15/2012 is discriminatory
in that the 7% levy (TVPEE) is targeted at New Regime generators which, contrary to
Ordinary Regime installations, cannot pass the levy to the final consumer.**! The Respondent
replies that “the impact of TVPEE in renewable energy produces [...] has been neutralised,
since the TVPEE is one of the costs repaid to such producers by the specific remuneration
they receive” according to Order IET/1045/2014 “to recover certain costs which, unlike with
the conventional technologies, they cannot recover on the market. The TVPEE, precisely, is
included in these costs”.4°? The Claimants argue, however, that they “have still suffered

damages as a result of this measure.”*

In the present case, imposing the same 7% tax to all electrical installations, regardless their
ability to pass the levy to consumers entails prima facie an unfavourable treatment for RE
installations. To avoid that outcome, Law 15/2012 could either have exempted the companies
in charge of RE from the 7% tax or have authorized them to transfer the burden of the levy
on the consumers. However, Law 15/2012 has not retained any of those options. Instead, the
Respondent has decided to include the amount of the levy in the calculation of the
remuneration of the RE producers to assure them reasonable profitability. This allows them
to recover the amounts paid, as, contrary to the traditional producers, they cannot pass them
on consumers. This is a positive discrimination in favour of the RE facilities aimed at
reversing the unfavourable treatment that follows from the tax established in Law 15/2012.
In other words, the Respondent has adopted specific corrective measures to avoid the
discriminatory effect of Law 15/2012 through a legitimate reverse discrimination in favour
of the investors adversely affected by that Law. Therefore, the Claimants’ complaint on

discrimination must be dismissed.

Moreover, as established above,***

the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to decide on the tax.
Since, concretely, the discussion between the Parties on the discrimination entirely bears
upon the tax, it cannot decide on this aspect of the respective claims of the Parties in this

respect.

This being said, the Tribunal accepts the Claimants’ claim according to which the 7% levy
is subsumed within the overall damage caused and would have to be taken into consideration

in the assessment of the violation of the FET by the Respondent.

In line with this last finding, it is interesting to note that both Parties mix the discussion of
the principle of non-discrimination with that of reasonableness, thus confirming that this

question also cannot be dealt with in isolation.*”°

5. Proportionality and Reasonableness
a. The Parties’ Positions
i. The Claimants’ Position

In the Claimants’ view, the Respondent did not satisfy the proportionality test, consisting in
assessing whether a State measure is proportionate by comparing the relationship between
the burden imposed on the foreign investor and the aim sought by the State measure, with
due consideration of the other alternatives available.4”°

Relying on the Saluka v. Czech Republic and Micula v. Romania cases, the Claimants specify
that, to be reasonable, a State’s conduct requires demonstration that the conduct “bears a
reasonable relationship to some rational policy” and that “it is also necessary that [...] the
state’s acts have been appropriately tailored to the pursuit of that rational policy with due
regard for the consequences imposed on investors.” For the Claimants, the Respondent’s

measures do not satisfy this test.4°”

Since the FIT was not the source of the Tariff Deficit and the FIT for wind and CSP only
played a limited role in the accumulation of the Tariff Deficit, curtailing the FIT for CSP and
wind while gravely affecting foreign investors was not a suitable and proportional measure
to achieve the aim sought.**

The Claimants submits that other less harmful measures could have been adopted, including:
(a) raising electricity prices; (b) introducing a fuel tax; (c) adopting a tax on CO2 emissions;

(d) profiling of FITs.*”

The Claimants further contend that “a State measure is not proportionate unless it is necessary
to achieve the goals pursued.” Since alternative solutions less harmful to investors were
available, the Respondent unreasonably decided to enact measures that dramatically altered
the investment framework it had promised to CSP investors. The measures cannot therefore

be considered as a proportionate answer to the Tariff Deficit.>°°

It is also the Claimants’ position that, since the Respondent’s actions have caused damages
to their investments in a substantial amount, this aftermath equals to a violation of its
obligations under the ECT to refrain from impairing RREEF’s investments through

unreasonable measures.*”!

According to the Claimants, the Respondent’s defences to justify the regime change, namely
the overcapacity of RE infrastructure and the Tariff Deficit, are the result of Spain’s own
regulatory decisions and misjudgement. The Claimants state that it is not foreign investors

who should be made responsible for fixing those matters.*°

It is the Claimants’ position that the “overcapacity” of the RE sector is due to Spain’s failure
to locate sole central control over access to the economic benefits of RD 661/2007 in the
Ministry. Monitoring of investment and capacity levels could have been carried out more
effectively and efficiently. RD 661/2007 permitted to access its economic regime through
registration with the RAIPRE and also allowed Autonomous Communities to authorise the
construction and registration of installations presented to them in time of economic crisis.
According to the Claimants, since the RE projects were sources of revenue and job creation,

they were all accepted as long as the applications qualified.

Additionally, the Claimants deny that the measures were a valid excuse to solve the

Respondent’s Tariff Deficit on three grounds.**

First, the Claimants assert that tackling the Tariff Deficit, by adopting sudden and drastic
changes to the regulatory regime for renewables, cannot be said to be correlated to a rational
policy goal.°° According to the Claimants, the Tariff Deficit existed long before the RE
sector developed in Spain and developed due to Respondent's failure to raise regulated tariffs
to the level necessary to cover the costs of the Electricity System.°°° However, wind and CSP
provide limited contribution to solve the Tariff Deficit, while the regime is causing
substantial harm to the Claimants’ investments.*°”

Second, relying on BG v. Argentina, the Claimants state that the Respondent has
unreasonably stripped them of key elements of the regulatory regime upon which their
investments were made, after creating and fueling legitimate expectations, and such

unilateral withdrawal is “by definition unreasonable”.*°*

Third, the Claimants insist that the Tariff Deficit was not created by the RD 661/2007
economic regime but by the failure of the Respondent to abide by the income-sufficiency
principle and comply with its own laws. The Respondent is criticised hence for having failed
to set efficient regulated tariffs, i.e., retail tariffs, at levels that are sufficient to cover the costs
of all regulated activities, including the costs of the Special Regime. Thus, the removal of

RD 661/2007 is an unreasonable answer to address the Tariff Deficit.

Finally, the Claimants considers that the State Aid Decision is irrelevant since the decision

only verifies that the New Regime does not result in an “overcompensation”*!”:

“Consequently, it is perfectly possible that an incentive scheme found
compatible by the Commission undercompensates investors. On any view,
there has been no finding that the Claimants were overcompensated under
the Original Regime and no evidence has been provided of this.”°!!

ii. |The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent addresses together the discriminatory, reasonable and proportionate aspects

512

of the contested measures”’~ and considers that the burden of proving the disproportionality

falls on the Claimants.>!

The Respondent further rejects the Claimants’ allegations that to show the proportionality
and reasonableness of the measure, it is the Respondent who must show that the measures
were necessary in light of the alternatives available, as being unsupported by international
law or prior arbitral decisions.>"* It considers that instead of asking to justify that the adopted
measures are the only possible ones, it is for the Claimants to prove the irrationality and

disproportionality of the adopted measures.*!5

Regarding the affirmation by the Claimants that measures are disproportionate, the
Respondent stresses that the Claimants have omitted that the measures were imposed on the
entire System, to rebalance the SEE, not only on the Wind Power and CSP Sector.>!® The
Respondent underlines that the proportionate nature of the measures has to be appreciated as

a whole not just within a specific sector.

The Respondent adopted reasonable and proportionate macroeconomic control measures for
justified reasons, including (a) “[t]he legal obligation of maintaining the economic system in
accordance with the reasonable rate of return principle at all times for the investors, avoiding

the over-remuneration that would be contrary to EU law;” (b) “the existence of a public

interest in the sustainability of the SEE, in a context of serious international crisis and with a
severe reduction in energy demand encountered by the RE Sector, which reduced revenues
in the SEE and brought economic imbalance to the SEE, together with increased costs in
REs”; and (c) “[t]he impossibility of transferring all the burden of the economic imbalance
onto consumers.”>!7
The Respondent contends that, to determine that the measures are not proportional or
rational, the Claimants have the burden of proving, based on reliable information, that the
Respondent could have adopted other measures compatible with the commitments
undertaken with the EU in the MoU of July 2012 in exchange of the financial rescue to
rebalance the sustainability of the SES without transferring all the costs to the Spanish
consumers. The Claimants have not fulfilled this duty.*!*

In particular, the Respondent affirms that it is not for the Respondent to justify that the
adopted measures are the only possible ones, and in any case, the Claimants failed to
demonstrate the legal, financial and budgetary validity of the “alternative measures” that the
Claimants allege could have rebalanced the SEE and guaranteed its sustainability in the
future. It points to one of the solutions proposed by the Claimants’ quantum expert, which
involve, among others, burdening electricity consumers with more than EUR 27 billion in
deficit or making up a tax to defray that amount.>!° These are ill-conceived measures,
according to the Respondent, since the Claimants “do not explain how, by increasing tariffs,
a shrinking number of electricity consumers could have put an end to the SES deficit without
hampering the competitiveness of the Spanish economy during an economic recession.” On
this issue, the Respondent notes that “the tariffs increased by 81% to the consumers between

the years 2003 and 2012.”52°

The Respondent also considers that some of the Claimants-suggested measures are contrary
to EU law*! and that the subsidies for the production of renewable energies should comply
with the limits of the community regulations concerning State Aid.*”? The Respondent points
out that the State Aid Decision “ratifies the proportionality and rationality of the disputed
measures, since they meet the purpose of the State Aids and are aligned with the regulation

39523

of other European Members (Italy, France, Estonia, Latvia and Czech Republic) and

considers that “[t]he Claimant[s] could not legitimately expect that the Kingdom of Spain
would not respect the limits provided by EU Law.”°”4

The Respondent further posits that the measures proposed by the Claimants, reflect an
ignorance over Spain’s taxation and budget relations, as well as over its obligations under
the Memorandum of Understanding signed with the EU.°*> The EU MoU required the
Respondent to “address the electricity tariff deficit in a comprehensive way.” To do so, apart
from the disputed measures, the Respondent also took a series of other measures of taxation

or reductions of costs of the SES.°”

Furthermore, the Respondent asserts that the Claimants have omitted two key points: that the
supply of electricity in the Respondent is to be carried out at the lowest possible cost for the
consumer and that the Respondent is obliged to correct over-remuneration situations pursuant

to the Competition Law of the European Union.*?”

The Respondent concludes that the disproportionality of the measures has not been
demonstrated by the Claimants.*”8 The Respondent notes that the Claimants are earning 27%

more than what their wind farm costs and “much more than what their Andasol plants cost.”

The Arenales Solar is not able to recoup its investment costs (and cover the operation costs)

due to inefficiencies of the plant and not due to the applicable regulatory regime.*”?
b. The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Arbitral Tribunal considers that the proportionality requirement is fulfilled inasmuch as
the modifications are not random, unnecessary or arbitrary, that is, provided that they do not

significantly modify the legal framework applicable to the investors.**°

Arbitrary, as established by the ICJ in the ELSI case, is “an act which shocks, or at least
surprises, a sense of juridical propriety”**!. Arbitrariness may be assessed mutatis mutandis
through the criteria set up by the ILC in the Guiding Principles applicable to unilateral

declarations of States capable of creating legal obligations:

“consideration should be given to:

(a) Any specific terms of the declaration relating to revocation;

(b) The extent to which those to whom the obligations are owed have

relied on such obligations;

(c) The extent to which there has been a fundamental change in the

circumstances”>.
Once again, the Arbitral Tribunal must recall that the discussion on the burden of proof is
somewhat idle: it is for each party which advances a claim to prove its case.>*? This of course
holds true concerning the respect — or not — of the reasonableness and proportionality

standards.

Although intellectually different, both concepts, which both Parties in a large part discuss
together, are closely linked, because the breach of one of them normally entails the breach of

the other one. It can even be admitted that proportionality is the main test for reasonableness.

146

The concepts of reasonableness and proportionality necessarily include having the minimum
negative effect on the States’ other international obligations, in the present case, including

those resulting from the ECT and customary international law.

In the view of the Tribunal, reasonableness in the exercise of regulatory power includes:

e Legitimacy of purpose, inasmuch as it represents interests of the society as a whole and
does not alter the substance of the rights affected by the regulation.

e Necessity, which implies the existence of a pressing social need. The threshold for
“necessary” is more demanding than the one for “useful” or “desirable”.

e Suitability, in that it must make it possible to achieve the legitimate objective pursued.

Proportionality for its part is a weighing mechanism that seeks a fair balance between
competing interests and/or principles affected by the regulation, taking into account all
relevant circumstances. The regulation must be closely adjusted to the attainment of its
legitimate objective, interfering as little as possible with the effective exercise of the affected

rights.

In this respect, the Arbitral Tribunal shares the views expressed by the Novenergia tribunal,

which cites relevant case law and deserves being cited at some length:

657. [...A]n assessment of the Respondent’s actions under the FET standard
allows for a balancing exercise. As quoted by the Respondent, the arbitral
tribunal in Electrabel, set out a basic principle for application of the ECT
FET standard in this respect:

‘[T]he Tribunal considers that the application of the ECT’s FET
standard allows for a balancing exercise by the host State in
appropriate circumstances. The host State is not required to elevate
unconditionally the interests of the foreign investor above all other
considerations in every circumstance. As was decided by the tribunals
in Saluka v Czech Republic and Arif v Moldova, [a] FET standard may
legitimately involve a balancing or weighing exercise by the host
State.’

‘That requires a balancing or weighing exercise so as to ensure that
the effects of the intended measure remain proportionate in regard to
the affected rights and interests. Provided that there is an appropriate
correlation between the policy sought by the State and the measure,

467.

468.

147

the decision by a State may be reasonable under the ECT’s FET
standard even if others can disagree with that decision. A State can
thus be mistaken without being unreasonable.’>*+

658. In Saluka, the arbitral tribunal also applied the balancing exercise:

‘[T]he scope of the Treaty’s protection of foreign investment against unfair and
inequitable treatment cannot exclusively be determined by foreign investors’
subjective motivations and considerations. Their expectations, in order for them
to be protected, must rise to the level of legitimacy and reasonableness in light
of the circumstances.

[J

No investor may reasonably expect that the circumstances prevailing at the time
the investment is made remain totally unchanged. In order to determine whether
frustration of the foreign investor’s expectations was justified and reasonable,
the host State’s legitimate right subsequently to regulate domestic matters in the
public interest must be taken into consideration as well.

[Lo]

The determination of a breach of [the FET standard] by the Czech Republic
therefore requires a weighing of the Claimant’s legitimate and reasonable
expectations on the one hand and the Respondent’s legitimate regulatory
interests on the other.’*35759°

In the previous sections of this Decision, the Tribunal has undertaken to study and discuss
individually the various arguments put forward by each party. The Tribunal’s conclusions on
the issue of the proportionality and reasonableness of the challenged measures is the right
place to assemble the various aspects of the case since only a global view of the situation

permits the respect (or disrespect) by the Respondent of its obligations under the ECT to be

Three preliminary (and complementary) remarks are in order before deciding on the
reasonableness and proportionality of the challenged measures:
- First, the Tribunal is of the opinion that the Respondent enjoys a margin of appreciation in

conducting its economic policy; therefore, it will not substitute its own views either on the

148

appropriateness of the measures at stake or on the characterization of the situation which
prompted them; in particular, the Tribunal will abstain to take any position on the issue of

the existence of other or more appropriate possible measures to face this situation;

- Second, it is also quite obvious that the Respondent’s margin of appreciation cannot be
unlimited: otherwise there would be nothing to arbitrate and the Respondent’s decisions
would be unchallengeable; “discretionary” cannot be equated with “arbitrary”; margin of
appreciation is different from unfettered discretion; the FET (and its components), as defined
in the previous paragraphs of this Decision, constitute, in the present case the clearest limits

of the Respondent’s discretion; and

- Third, it cannot be sustained that the measures taken by the Respondent could only result
in the maintenance of the initial situation of the investors; to support such an argument would
amount to asserting the immutability of the conditions applying to the investors; as the

Tribunal has shown earlier, this is not a tenable position.*°”

Notwithstanding the first point above, the Tribunal notes that the disputed measures are part
of a comprehensive plan aimed at addressing the situation created by a “tariff deficit for a
decade, which, over the passage of time, has adopted a structural nature, due to the fact that
the actual costs related to regulated activities and the operation of the electricity sector are
higher than the collection of the tolls set by the Government, which are paid by

consumers.”°38

Taking into consideration the Respondent’s margin of appreciation, the Tribunal considers
that, for appreciating the reasonableness of the disputed measures, it is necessary to start by
recalling that the only established legitimate expectation of the Claimants is the guarantee of
areasonable return of their investments. With this in mind, the Tribunal must assess whether
such an expectation has been frustrated in violation of the FET standard and its components

as detailed in Article 10(1) ECT.

538 RDL 9/2013 (R-37) (See also C-31), Preamble.

472.

149

The very expression legitimate expectation of a reasonable return of investments can leave
no doubt as to the unavoidable part of subjectivity in such an assessment. Neither the word
‘legitimacy’ nor the word ‘reasonable’ lend themselves to a purely objective assessment. In
the view of this Tribunal, the best way to limit as far as possible the interpreter’s share of
subjectivity — in this case that of the arbitrators - is to cross a series of varied indicia. In this
regard, the following elements in particular seem to the Tribunal to need to be taken into
consideration, and, first of all, of course, the various calculations, based on different methods,
made by the experts selected by the Parties, notably their findings concerning:

- the valuation date taken into account in order to determine the fair market value and,

- to that same purpose, the risk of unsustainability;

- the rentability of the investment, conducted both in abstracto and in concreto, taking
into consideration the particular operating costs of each installation and the price paid for
their acquisition;

- the predictable lifetime of the plants; and

- the cost of money on the capital market.

Such an empirical assessment cannot be made in the abstract. In other words, the Tribunal
will be in the position to determine whether the measures taken by the Respondent have
adversely affected the Claimants’ legitimate expectation for a reasonable return only when it
has evaluated the loss sustained by them, taking into account all the relevant elements. In
other words, the determination of a violation of the principles of proportionality and
reasonableness is inseparable from an assessment of the damages — if any — endured by the

Claimants as a consequence of the measures taken by the Respondent.

VII. THE PRINCIPLE OF DAMAGES

The Claimants assert to be entitled to full reparation in accordance with principles of
customary international law, as codified in the ILC Articles.>*? With basis on ILC Articles 1,
28, 34-36,°° the Claimants contend that the Respondent is under the obligation to make
restitution or, alternatively, compensate the Claimants, putting them, as far as possible, in the
position that they would have been in but for the Respondent’s wrongdoing.*“! The Tribunal
agrees with these assumptions although it has some doubts that, in a case like this, implying

repealing laws and regulations as requested by the Claimants, >

restitutio in integrum would
be an appropriate remedy. In this respect, the Tribunal is of the same mind as the ICSID

tribunal in LG&E v. Argentina:

“The judicial restitution required in this case would imply modification of
the current legal situation by annulling or enacting legislative and
administrative measures that make over the effect of the legislation in
breach. The Tribunal cannot compel Argentina to do so without a sentiment
of undue interference with its sovereignty. Consequently, the Tribunal
arrives at the same conclusion: the need to order and quantify
compensation.”>3

However, compensation is due if, but only if, an injury has been caused by an internationally
wrongful act.*“ In the previous sections of this Decision, the Tribunal has concluded that the
Respondent was not in breach of its obligations concerning the transparency> and the non-

discriminatory™* nature of the challenged measures. It has also found that the principle of

stability and predictability had been complied with by the Respondent, except to the extent
that the challenged measures have been applied retroactively:**” this being contrary to both
the FET standard embodied in Article 10(1) ECT and a well-established general principle of
law,>4* the Respondent must compensate the Claimants for the ensuing losses it incurred as

a consequence of this breach (A).

Besides the findings summarized in the above paragraph, the Arbitral Tribunal has also
considered that the Claimants could not legitimately expect that the rules applicable to their
investments would remain unchanged for the entire duration but that they had a legitimate
expectation to get a reasonable return on their investments.*#? Such expectation implies that
the modifications brought to the previous regime would be made in conformity with the
principles of reasonableness and proportionality, failing which the losses incurred by the
Claimants must be compensated. However, the Tribunal has left open the question of the
infringement of the legitimate expectations of the Claimants, since it considers that the
reasonableness and proportionality of the measures adopted by the Respondent can only be

assessed in view of the extent of the losses suffered by the Claimants.

It therefore falls to the Tribunal to assess the loss of profits suffered by the Claimants as a
consequence of the new regime, on the basis of the positions of the Parties and, in particular,
the expert opinions they have commissioned, as well as their answers to the questions put by
the Tribunal in its Request for Additional Information dated 16 January 2018, confirmed by
its letters of 12 and 28 February 2018 (B).

A. THE LOSSES CAUSED BY THE RETROACTIVE APPLICATION OF
THE CHALLENGED MEASURES

a. The Parties’ Positions

i. The Claimants’ Position

In their Rebuttal Regulatory Report, the Claimants’ experts explain that the New Regime’s
retroactivity has the effect of clawing-back previous remuneration which is higher than
7.398% — this percentage representing the “reasonable return” under the New Regime.
According to the Claimants, the damage they have suffered corresponds to the difference
between the remuneration received before 14 July 2013 and the new financial incentives

introduced by the Respondent at this date.

Brattle illustrates this damage with the following Figure, in which the blue shaded area “A”

indicates the alleged “windfall profits”:

Following the Tribunal’s invitation to provide a breakdown of the valuation including the

550

alleged retroactivity of the new regime,°”’ the Claimants further stated that:

“Tt would be possible to update the Alternative Claim to separately identify the impact
of each element of retroactivity in the methodology of the New Regulatory Regime.

However, as Brattle explains ‘it would require the Tribunal to direct the parties to

prepare a new (and extensive) analysis’.”>>!

li. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent disagrees that the new regime applies retroactively and gives no information

concerning the valuation of the damages caused by its alleged retroactivity.

b. The Tribunal’s Analysis

As recalled above, >>”

the Respondent has decided, in its own words, to take into account “the
remuneration already received from the beginning of the operation of the facility, for the
purpose of calculating the future subsidies to receive [...].”°°? The Tribunal has already

concluded that such a means of calculation was in contradiction with the principle of non-

554 555

retroactivity’”” and entailed a right to compensation for the Claimants.

This being said, four further remarks are in order:

- first, the compensation due in this regard has a distinct character from the one which could
be due for the global compensable losses possibly sustained by the Claimants as the result of
the challenged measures;

- second, as apparent from Brattle’s figure reproduced in para. 478 above, the damage must
be calculated in view of the lifetime of the investment that the Tribunal considers to be 25

years;>°6

154

- third, calculation of the damage suffered as a consequence of the retroactive application of
the new regime must bear upon the erroneous taking into account of the past gains of the
Claimants above the target return of 7.398% from the time of the investment until July 2013;
and

- fourth, the Arbitral Tribunal observes that the Claimants note that Brattle, their own
valuation experts, consider that it would be complicated, but not impossible, to determine
the impact of the unlawful retroactive application of the new regime in isolation but that this
would imply new expert investigations, while the Respondent has failed to answer the

Tribunal’s question in this respect.

The Claimants are entitled to compensation as a consequence of the Respondent’s breach of
the principle of non-retroactivity, whatever the conclusion of the Tribunal would be
concerning the alleged breach of the Claimants’ legitimate expectations concerning a
reasonable return. The resulting harm endured by the Claimants must, therefore, be evaluated
autonomously. However — but this is a different issue — the assessment of the actual return
must be done taking into consideration the retroactive application of the new regime. If not,

compensation would be granted twice for one same wrongful act.**”

B. THE LossEs SUFFERED BY THE CLAIMANTS AS A RESULT
OF THE DECREASE OF THEIR RETURN ON INVESTMENT

(a) Standard of damages and method of valuation

a. The Parties’ Positions

i. The Claimants’ Position

The ECT is silent on the standard of compensation of damages for a breach of the obligations
under its Article 10. The Claimants assert that the standard of compensation for a breach of
Article 10 of the ECT should be the difference in the fair market value of the investments

with and without the disputed measures.***

588 CM, para. 518.

485.

486.

487.

488.

155

The Claimants refer to the standard of compensation due for lawful expropriation under
Article 13 of the ECT, which is the fair market value of the investment immediately prior to
the taking.*? Relying on the awards in CMS v. Argentina, Enron v. Argentina, Sempra v.
Argentina, and Azurix vy. Argentina, the Claimants state that in the absence of an express
requirement, the standard of the fair market value of the investment also applies to breaches
other than expropriation, such as breach of FET.*° The Claimants also rely on the award in
Anatolie Statie v. The Republic of Kazakhstan, where the tribunal held that the standard of
compensation for a breach of Article 10(1) of the ECT, should not be lower than the fair

market value standard prescribed under Article 13 of the ECT.

The Claimants assert that a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) analysis is the appropriate method
for measuring the fair market value of the investments. Brattle, Claimants’ valuation experts,
explain that a DCF method is appropriate because CSP and wind plants have a relatively
simple business model, whose demand of electricity and long run value can be analysed and
modelled in detail based on available data; it is a method that dominates the valuations of
power stations, used by lenders providing project finance and even by the Respondent; and
can be used to explore the impact of different scenarios on the Claimants’ cash flows,
enabling a proper accounting to be taken of regulatory risk by modifying the revenues that

the Claimants will earn under the disputed measures.*°!

Further, the Claimants argue that contrary to the Respondent’s assertion, the DCF method is
not speculative. Investment treaty arbitration jurisprudence generally favours a DCF
approach, recognizing its main advantage of establishing a fair market value in a conceptually
correct manner as the present worth of future benefits.°°

The Claimants argue that Khan Resources B.V. v. Mongolia illustrates when the DCF is not

appropriate, such as when there are additional uncertainties like how a project would be

financed, whether the claimant can bring the project into production by itself or if it needs a
strategic partner, etc.°°? But here, the Andasol Plants and the Wind parks have sufficient
operational history. They were established and operative producing energy since 2008 (but
for Arenales, due to a turbine failure). Besides, the Claimants reference a number of decisions
in which tribunals have used the DCF method despite little or no operational history. Also,
the Claimants argue that the installations were fully financed at the date of assessing damages
and without the disputed measures the plants would not have had difficulties servicing their
loans.*® In any case, few tribunals have considered the financial state of a claimant as being

relevant to assessing the future prospect of the investment.*©

Also, the Claimants reject the Respondent’s argument that the volatility of pool prices makes
the DCF method uncertain. Brattle explains that the volatility of pool prices is a reason to
implement a FIT regime. Under a regime with fixed tariffs as under RD 661/2007, cash flows
are independent from the pool price, so electricity prices play a limited, if any, role in the

remuneration obtained under such regimes.**”

The Claimants also address the Respondent’s criticism that the DCF is inappropriate due to
the disproportion between the investment and the amount claimed. The Claimants distinguish
this case from those of Wena Hotels v. Egypt and Tecmed v. Mexico, where the disproportion
was determined by the tribunals to be a relevant factor to reject DCF. In those cases, the
amounts claimed were more than seven times the amount invested, while here it is 1.53
times.*® Brattle also explains that, given the time elapsed between the investment and the
valuation date, damages would naturally be higher than the amounts invested by the

Claimants, so as to earn a reasonable return.

The Claimants argue that the valuation date to determine the fair market value should be 20
June 2014. Relying on International Technical Products Corporation v. Iran, Azurix v.
Argentina and Enron v. Argentina, the Claimants assert that, in cases of indirect expropriation
resulting from a series of measures, tribunals have found that the appropriate date for
determining liability and valuing damages should be the culmination of all events, when the
deprivation was irreparable or when the most serious damage arose in connection with a
certain measure. Further, the Claimants argue that tribunals have adopted those tests for
breaches other than expropriation.*”” Similarly here, the Claimants maintain that the
valuation date to determine the fair market value of their assets should be 20 June 2014,
which is the date of publication of the Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014, marking the final
act of Respondent’s measures that, according to the Claimants, caused irreversible
deprivation and most serious damage to their investments.°7!

The Claimants assert that the Respondent must compensate them for the lost fair market value
of their investments, comprised of historical losses and losses relating to future cash flows.>””
The DCF analysis compares a “But for” scenario, which assumes that the disputed measures
were never implemented, to an “Actual” scenario, which considers the full effect of the
disputed measures on the investments. According to Brattle’s valuation, the damages due is
the difference in the net present value between the Claimants’ cash flows with and without

the disputed measures.*7*

For lost historic cash flows, Brattle compared the cash flows between the period of 27
December 2012 (Law 15/2012) and 20 June 2014 (Order IET/1045/2014). Over that period,
Brattle compared the cash flows that the Claimants would have accrued but-for the disputed
measures to the Claimants’ actual accrued cash flows, resulting from the disputed

measures.*”* The Claimants summarize the steps taken by Brattle to measure the lost historic

cash flows. The Claimants explain that Brattle adopted seven assumptions to define the but-
for scenario for the period of December 2012 and June 2014.5 In addition, Brattle
considered that due to the disputed measures, Arenales Solar and Dédalo needed equity
injections that would not have been required in the but-for scenario.*”° Finally, Brattle
considered that for Arenales there is a performance guarantee payment, which in the but-for
scenario would have reflected a payment subject to the Special Regime and that now reflects
payments based on the New Regime.*”” Applying all those assumptions, Brattle quantified
the Claimants’ lost historical cash flows at EUR 45 million, later updated in Brattle’s Rebuttal
Report to EUR 48.3 million.*”*

For lost future cash flows, Brattle compared the net present value as at 20 June 2014 of what
Claimants’ cash flows would have been but for the disputed measures to what those cash
flows are projected to be resulting from the disputed measures.*”? The Claimants summarize

the four steps taken by Brattle to quantify the lost future cash flows.

First, Brattle calculated the base net present value of the reasonably expected cash flows of
the Claimants’ CSP plants and wind farms, in both the but-for and the actual scenarios.
Brattle quantified lost net present value of Claimants’ equity in the CSP plants and wind
farms at EUR 810 million.**° Second, Brattle calculated the adjusted net present value, by
accounting the positive side effects of holding debts and having tax benefits in both, the but-
for and the actual scenarios. According to Brattle, the financing side effects increase the
impact of the disputed measures from EUR 10 million, to EUR 820 million.>*! Third, Brattle
subtracted from the adjusted net present value of the but-for and of the actual scenarios, the
net present value of the debt, swap obligations and impact of any debt restructuring of the

Project Companies. Brattle quantified that the Disputed Measures reduced the final equity

value to EUR 735 million.**? Fourth, Brattle attributed to the Claimants a percentage of the
final equity value that is in proportion to the Claimants’ individual shareholding in the Project
Companies; accounted for RREEF’s preferential share in Arenales Solar; and applied an
illiquidity discount of 18% since the Claimants’ CSP plants and wind farms are difficult to

trade.>8

In total, Brattle quantified the lost future cash flows at 20 June 2014 at EUR 252 million,
which together with lost historical cash flows amounts to damages of EUR 297 million,
excluding interest and tax gross-up.*** In their Reply, the Claimants adjusted that amount to

EUR 265 million, excluding interest and tax gross-up.>*°

The Claimants argue that they have met the standard of proof used to establish the certainty
of future cash flows and that Respondent’s claim that Brattle’s calculations are speculative
is baseless. The Claimants note a distinction between the standard of proof for quantification
of loss and for existence of loss. Relying on Lemire v. Ukraine, the Claimants argue that a
more relaxed test applies to calculation of damages, once the existence of the damages is
attributed to the conduct of the State.°*° The Claimants maintain that the future cash flows in
the but-for and in the actual scenarios can be reliably be estimated to a high degree of
certainty, since Brattle’s calculation is mostly based on objective data. For example, Brattle
calculated the base net present value relying on the Claimants’ production forecasts in the
normal course of business, adjusted that value accounting for financing side-effects based on
objective and actual data, calculated the final equity value by looking at the market value of
the debt, which is calculated on objective third-party data.°*”

Further, the Claimants argue that an asset-based method, such as the one suggested by the

Respondent, is inappropriate. According to Brattle, the method proposed by the Respondent

is not a recognized valuation method for renewable energy generation assets. Instead, it is
used in the context of transmission and distribution monopolies.*** The Claimants point out
that BDO, Respondent’s valuation experts, compared the enterprise value of an investment
to that investment’s regulatory asset base, without accounting for the switch in regime, as the
method assumes that a different regime was in place when the Claimants invested.**° The
Claimants maintain that such method is a way for Respondent to deny liability and to assert
that no damage was suffered, because the method assumes that both the original and the new

regime offered a reasonable return on efficient investment.>”

Subsidiarily, the Respondents also presented an alternative valuation based on the DCF
method. In their Rebuttal Report, Brattle offered an alternative valuation for CSP plants and
wind farms said to address Respondent’s alternative valuation based on a reasonable return
allegedly implicit in the FIT originally offered before the New Regime. The Claimants
explain that such methodology still leads to substantial damages.*”!

In short, Brattle offered an alternative valuation that removed all retroactive effects of the
New Regime and assumed that a 9.5% after-tax return was reasonable for CSP plants and
wind farms and also levelized the cost targets for each CSP plant and wind farm at a
“marginal plant level”, which is understood as the most expensive plant on the system that is
nevertheless efficient.°°? Also, Brattle’s alternative valuation involved some adjustments,
including, among others, that the Respondent should have calculated levelized costs

assuming an average useful life of 40 years for CSP plants and 25 years for wind farms.°*?

Brattle applied the above assumptions to alternative scenarios, each with different cost
targets, but with the same 9.5% after-tax return. Brattle calculated the Claimants’ damages

in three alternative scenarios for CSP plants and in two alternative scenarios for the wind

farms.** In CSP scenario 1, the “marginal plant” is the most expensive type of efficient CSP
plant on the system, that is, according to Brattle, the tower system. With this methodology,
Brattle calculated that damages amount to EUR 254 million. In CSP scenario 2, Brattle
abandoned the single cost target associated to a “marginal plant” and assumed that the
Respondent was allowed to change the FITs under RD 661/2007 and discriminate between
CSP technologies once construction costs were understood and the date that operations were
approved. Brattle calculated damages at about EUR 115 million. Under CSP scenario 3,
Brattle computed damages on the basis of the actual costs of the construction of CSP plants
and also assumed that the Respondent was allowed to discriminate between CSP plants.

Brattle calculated damages in CSP scenario 3 at about EUR 141 million.*°>

For the wind farms, Brattle calculated the Claimants’ damages under two scenarios. Under
Wind scenario 1, Brattle assumed that the “marginal plant” is the most expensive type of
wind plant entering the system after the issuance of RD 661/2007, and calculated damages
at EUR 26 million. For Wind scenario 2, Brattle computed the FIT with reference to the
actual costs of construction of Claimants’ own wind farms and assumed that the Respondent
was allowed to set different FITs for each wind farm, but should not have changed the target
rate of return. Brattle calculated damages at EUR 10 million. This, according to Brattle,
reflects that the Claimants’ wind farms are among the most efficient installations in the
Spanish wind sector, their construction costs are low, so an alternative valuation on those

costs results in positive damages.*”®
li. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent argues that the legal and regulatory regime from 1997 to present day has
always granted the same reasonable profitability. Therefore, the Claimants have not been

deprived of anything nor have they endured any prejudice.*”” Also, the Respondent has not

breached the ECT and it is under no obligation to indemnify the Claimants.*** But, even if
the Tribunal were to find that the Respondent is liable for breaching the ECT, the alleged

damages are not entitled to compensation.*””

504. In relation to the compensation standard, the Respondent considers that the “Tribunal just
cannot apply standards or criteria thought for cases of expropriation or cases when the
property has been taken, or cases where the investor has not been able to sell the
investment.”°°

505. The Respondent considers 20 June 2014 as an irrelevant and arbitrary date to evaluate
Claimants’ investment and maintains that the sale of the plants is a relevant event for

valuation purposes. °°!

506. The Respondent asserts that the alleged damages are speculative and therefore not
compensable and that the DCF method is not appropriate in these circumstances. The
Respondent maintains that the Claimants’ distinction between lost historic and lost future
cash flows fails to consider the concept of regulatory useful life and omits the overall
consideration of cash flows, past and future, to guarantee a reasonable return on the
investments made. °°?

507. The Respondent asserts that by law wind farms and solar power plants are guaranteed a
reasonable return, protected from market uncertainness and fluctuations.** The Respondent
contends that the Claimants’ projection is illusory since the claims assume that the “actual”
scenario will be maintained over the coming decades, ignoring that the guarantee of

reasonable return is the guiding principle of the system.°™ Relying on a judgment by the

Supreme Court of the Kingdom of Spain, the Respondent argues that the damages have not
been substantiated, since their calculation is based on a long-time horizon and nothing
guarantees that the remuneration shall remain unchanged in the current form. Further, the
Respondent maintains that the Claimants have not met their burden of proof to establish the

loss of value of their plants.°°

The Respondent maintains that, in the circumstances of this case, the DCF method is not
appropriate because it is an excessively speculative method that may lead to overvaluation.%”
The circumstances to which the Respondent refers are: the lack of sufficient financial history
to maintain a solid future cash flow projection; the significant tangible asset base, without
relevant intangible assets to analyse; the cash flows’ high dependency on external, volatile
and unpredictable elements; the financial weakness of the project finance structure; the long-
term forecasts; the contradiction between the long-time horizon and the plants’ declared
useful life; and the disproportion between the alleged investment and the amount claimed.°*
The Respondent refers to the tribunal’s findings in Tenaris v. Venezuela, to support its
argument that a DCF method is inappropriate when a company has a limited operation history
and when a country’s general economic conditions make it unlikely that a company’s cash
flows be projected with reasonable certainty.°?

Relying on Rusoro v. Venezuela, the Respondent argues that small adjustments in the
estimates can lead to significant divergences and that the Claimants’ sanity check of their
DCE valuation is fictitious.°!° The Respondents maintains that BDO, its valuation expert,
offered instead a more credible reality check, looking at public information provided by two
yieldcos stating that, following the disputed measures, renewable energy plants in the

Respondent which provide a reasonable rate of returns are active, not deteriorated.°!!

Relying on doctrine, the Respondent asserts that the Tribunal should instead evaluate the
existence of damages using a method that is easier, less speculative and that looks to the past,
based on the cost of assets, examining whether the costs are recovered and if there is
reasonable return on the costs. Such method considers normal rates of return, since
extraordinarily high or low rates are rare, and is appropriate when the investment is recent
and lacks a history of profitability.°!?

Relying on the report of BDO, the Respondent argues that the DCF method provides
abnormal results and that Claimants’ valuation of their investment in the “but-for” scenario
(EUR 363 million for CSP plants and EUR 85 million for wind farms) implies that, if the
Claimants obtained the requested compensation, a disproportionate internal rate of return
(“IRR”) of 30% and 39% for the CSP plants and wind farms, respectively.°'* Instead, BDO
calculated the IRR before taxes for the CSP plants at 7.2% and for the wind farms at 13.0%.°!*

The Respondent offered an alternative valuation based on Brattle’s outline to highlight the
volatility of the DCF method. In its first report, BDO presented two alternative scenarios. In
a first alternative, the actual scenario is compared with the but-for scenario, which was
created based on the tariff calculated under RD 436/2004 for Andasol | and Andasol 2 and
under RD 661/2007 for the other plants. A second alternative, involved a rate for the but-for
scenario under RD 661/2007 for all plants. In its second report, BDO updated those two
alternatives with new information obtained from the Claimants, namely, that the Arenales
plant is over-powered with a capacity higher than 50 MW. Thereby, in a “but for” scenario,
the subsidy in Article 36 of RD 661/2007 would not be applicable, instead the subsidy of
Article 45 of RD 661/2007 would apply, which is a lower subsidy.°!

Under the first alternative and considering the over-powering of Arenales plants, the

Respondent maintains that Claimants’ investment increased in value by EUR 32 million

under the new measures instead of suffering damages.°!° Under the second alternative and
considering the over-powering, the Respondent argues that even if the rate for but-for
scenario under RD 661/2007 was erroneously applied to all plants, Brattle calculated a
negative financial impact of EUR 297 million, while BDO calculated a negative impact 90%
lower, of EUR 31 million.°!’ The Respondent explains that the discrepancies between
Brattle’s and BDO’s DCFs derive from the different parameters used. Further, the
Respondent argues that the alternative valuation offered by Brattle in its Rebuttal Report
lacks any economic basis and makes a misguided interpretation of reasonable rate of

return.°!8

b. The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal faces very lengthy and fundamentally irreconcilable expert assessments of the
damages (or absence of damages) incurred by the Claimants as a consequence of the

challenged measures. Exactly as the ICJ in the Pulp Mills case, this Tribunal:

“does not find it necessary in order to adjudicate the present case to enter
into a general discussion on the relative merits, reliability and authority of
the documents and studies prepared by the experts and consultants of the
Parties. It needs only to be mindful of the fact that, despite the volume and
complexity of the factual information submitted to it, it is the responsibility
of the [Tribunal], after having given careful consideration to all the evidence
placed before it by the Parties, to determine which facts must be considered
relevant, to assess their probative value, and to draw conclusions from them
as appropriate. Thus, [... the Tribunal] will make its own determination of
the facts, on the basis of the evidence presented to it [...].”°!

The Tribunal notes that all the other tribunals which have, up to now, made a decision on
similar cases in already published (and produced by the Parties) awards have adopted an
“either/or” posture when deciding on the damages. Either they have found that the

Respondent was not in breach of its obligations under the ECT and they have, logically,

166

decided that it had no obligation to compensate any losses suffered by the Claimant; this has
been the position taken in the Charanne, Isolux and Blusun cases. Or the tribunals have
considered that, since the Respondent had been found in breach of Article 10 of the ECT, it
was obliged to make full reparation for the losses suffered; this has been the position taken
by the Eiser and Novenergia®™ tribunals. This last position would be illogical in the present
case since the Tribunal accepted that the Claimants were not immune from reasonable
changes in the regime applicable to its investment; therefore, it is only to the extent that the
modifications would have exceeded the limits of what is reasonable that compensation would

be due and should be calculated.
In effect, as noted by the Blusun tribunal (in a different but similar Italian context):

“In the absence of a specific commitment, the state has no obligation to

grant subsidies such as feed-in tariffs, or to maintain them unchanged once

granted. But if they are lawfully granted, and if it becomes necessary to

modify them, this should be done in a manner which is not disproportionate

to the aim of the legislative amendment, and should have due regard to the

reasonable reliance interests of recipients who may have committed

substantial resources on the basis of the earlier regime. These considerations

apply even more strongly when the context is subsidies or the payment of

special benefits for particular economic sectors.”°>!
In deciding whether the Claimants has obtained a reasonable return for their investments,
account must be taken of the finding of the Tribunal that the Claimants can avail themselves
of no commitment given by the Respondent as for the immutability of the applicable
regime.°” Since this Tribunal does not consider that Spain had an obligation to maintain the
initial regime integrally, the modification of such regime does not entail per se a breach of
the ECT, even if it entails a lesser return for the Claimants, unless the new regime deprives
the Claimants of a reasonable return according to the cost of money in the capital market

which is the only established legitimate expectation of the Claimants, as the Tribunal has

60 In Novenergia, the tribunal deducted the damages caused by the 7% levy, considering that it had no jurisdiction on
that tax and the measures taken by the respondent before 2013, considering they did not violate the FET.

already ruled. In this respect, the Tribunal cannot concur with the Eiser tribunal which, while

admitting that the “Claimants could not reasonably expect that there would be no change

> 623

whatsoever in the RD 661/2007 regime over three or four decades nevertheless decided

that the Respondent ought to be integrally compensated for the losses caused by the new

624

regime. And, with all due respect, as will be shown more precisely below,°™ it seems very

exaggerated to contend that “[t]he new system put into effect in 2014 by Ministerial Order
IET/1045/2014 deprived Claimants of substantially the total value of their investment.”
The Claimants in the present case, while asking for the integral compensation of their alleged
losses, do not go that far. In fact, they were able to sell their shares in the Andasol plants for

EUR 77.7 million.©°

In reality, the situation in the present case is much more similar to the situation in the LG&E

v. Argentina or Lemire v. Ukraine cases in which the tribunals decided that:

“Tt]he BIT establishes the rule that compensation for expropriation is to be
based on ‘fair market value’ of the investment; this principle, however, is
of little use in the present arbitration, because the breach does not amount
to the total loss or deprivation of an asset. Gala Radio still exists and
Claimant still owns it: compensation thus cannot be based on fair market
value of assets expropriated.”®’

The Tribunal further remarks that both Parties’ experts have used several methods of
calculation and achieve fundamentally different results regardless of the chosen method. The
reason is that their calculations are based on fundamentally different assumptions or criteria.
Without taking any position on the relevance of the DCF method to compare the assets value

9 this Tribunal does not find it useful to assess the reasonableness of the

criticized by others,
Claimants’ return under both regimes. Comparing the income or asset valuation in the two
scenarios makes it possible to calculate a difference but gives no indication as to whether the

two remunerations are reasonable or not.

Conversely, the internal rate of return is an indicator of a project’s profitability. As explained

by BDO:

“the reasonable return provided by the Spanish State corresponds to what is

economically known as the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of a project. The

internal rate of return (IRR) of a project measures the average annual returns

of said project, based on the updated cash flows generated by the project

over its entire lifespan.”°°°
Since the Tribunal has determined that the only legitimate expectation of which the
Claimants could prevail themselves was that of a “reasonable return”, it is appropriate to
compare both regimes depending on the IRR that the Claimants can get under each of them.
As the Novenergia Tribunal put it, “the internal rates of return is a relevant measurement for
what the Claimant was expecting to get from its investment in the Kingdom of Spain at the

time of making the investment.”°?!

(b) Does the new regime provide for a reasonable return?
With regard to the other possible head of damage suffered by the Claimants — the alleged

absence of a reasonable return, the Tribunal has already amply shown that:

- the Claimants could not legitimately expect that their return under the previous regime

would remain unchanged for the entire duration of their investment;

- besides the unlawful partial retroactive application of the new regime, the only breach by
the Respondent of its obligations to the Claimants resulted from the absence of a differential
between the return on investment and the cost of money in the capital market; and

- for the rest, the contested measures did not infringe the rights of the Claimants under the
ECT, while

- the new regime, although indeed less advantageous for the Claimants than the previous one,
offers them other elements guaranteeing the stability in the return on their investment; and,
- concerning more specifically Arenales, the question debated between the Parties as to its
installed capacity®? has no consequence in the Tribunal’s reasoning since the compensation
awarded to the Claimants is based on an assessment of the reasonableness of the actual return,
not on that resulting from the special regime under RD 661/2007 which was limited to plants

of an installed capacity of 50 MW and below.

As a result, the Tribunal considers that, while entitled to compensation for unreasonable
return on their investments — if established -, the Claimants cannot claim full compensation
for the total decrease in their profits as a result of the adoption of the new regime by the
Respondent; they can only get compensation to the extent that such decrease is below the

threshold of a reasonable return.

The Claimants rightly note that Article 30(4) “[does] not define [a] reasonable return”®*?.

The “reasonable return” has sometimes been described as a general principle according to
which “investors should be entitled to make a reasonable return on and of their
investment”®*. The Arbitral Tribunal does not take any position as to the existence of such
general principle; it simply notes that, in the present case, this rule must be applied since it is

consecrated in the relevant applicable texts. Moreover, the Tribunal agrees with Charanne®**

and Jsolux®*® tribunals that this principle should be defined according to Spanish law and

mainly to Law 54/1997. Therefore, the Tribunal shares the Respondent’s view that:

“the concept of ‘reasonable return’ has its own meaning: (i) it means, first,
that producers in the special regime are entitled to a ‘return’. That is, the
remuneration they receive allows them to recover both the amounts invested
(CAPEX) and the operating costs of these assets (OPEX) and, in addition,
obtain an industrial benefit. (ii) It means, secondly, that the industrial
benefit guaranteed to producers must be ‘reasonable’™". Therefore, that
benefit cannot be disproportionate or ‘irrational’. (iii) Third, the judgment
of reasonableness must be made on the basis of an element that is objective
and variable: ‘with reference to the cost of money in the capital market’ .”°*

525. Before evaluating whether the IRR is reasonable, according to the cost of money on the

capital markets at the relevant date, the Tribunal has to decide on how the IRR should be

calculated.
I. How should the reasonable return be calculated?
a. The Parties’ Positions
i. The Claimants’ Position

526. The Claimants contend that the ECT protects their equity interests and that the IRRs
associated with those investments are shareholders IRRs which are calculated by taking into

consideration “the price paid for the shares as the initial investments and the actual and

projected cashflows to the Claimants, over the lifetime of the assets.”°°?

527. The Claimants also recognize that while shareholders IRRs can be a source of information

and an important contextual element, they

“cannot, however, serve as a benchmark against the level of return that the
regulator considered reasonable when establishing the RD 661/2007 regime
(or the New Regime). The reason for this is that RD 661/2007 offered a FIT
to the installation,“°? regardless of who the ultimate owner of the installation
may have been or what they paid for their equity interest. The New Regime
takes the same approach. As Brattle explains, the ‘regulatory focus on
project IRRs was logical in part to avoid the need to anticipate and choose
among the many and varied financing structures adopted by individual
renewable investors’.**! The regulator never considered what shareholder
returns the regulations were seeking to provide but instead assessed the
target returns at asset level.°?"

528. The Claimants consider that the shareholders’ IRRs calculated by the Respondent for
Andasol are irrelevant since they do not take into account the premium paid by the Claimants
to acquire their investment.“ In reality, their actual equity IRR is much lower than what the
Respondent argues. The Claimants position is that they paid this expensive price because,

under the previous regime, the project IRR was much higher.

529. The Claimants agree“ with the Respondent’s expert Carlos Montoya that:

“30. The decision to obtain a loan or credit to undertake the investment is a
financial decision based merely on the interests of the promoter. The credit

69 Tbid., para. 11, n. 7: “As the Tribunal will recall, that return was not communicated to investors at the time but was
set out in the Ministry's internal report on RD 661/2007 (Exhibit C-0225). The investors were provided with (and
promised) a remuneration in €c/kWh for every kWh of electricity produced (see Exhibit C-0024, RD 661/2007, Article
36). They were also told that this remuneration would yield a reasonable return (Exhibit C-0024, RD 661/2007,
Preamble: "The economic framework established in the present Royal Decree develops the principles provided in Law
54/1997, of 27 November, on the Electricity Sector, guaranteeing the owners of facilities under the special regime a

conditions depend therefore on both the decisions taken by the promoter
regarding his own funds and of the agreements reached with other partners
or with banking entities.

31. These aspects are unrelated to regulation in renewable energies and it is
not possible to incorporate them into the parameters of remuneration, since
there are infinite possibilities in the financing of plants that could not be
reflected in the parameters of remuneration: the percentages of financed
capital are different in each plant, since each partner may have different
financing conditions, and such conditions may vary over time or may be
altered by a change in the distribution of partners in a particular plant or
sale, etc.”°4°

The Claimants calculate all IRRs on a pre-tax basis in order to make them comparable with

the 7.398% pre-tax target used by the regulator in the new regime.”

The Claimants make a distinction between holding and exit IRRs. They consider the former
more reliable since it is less affected by macroeconomic effects and find it consistent with

both regulator’s approach and Tribunal’s request for additional information.**

The Claimants’ experts assert that the useful life of the plants is 25 years for the Wind Parks
and 40 years for the CSP Plants (except for the storage components).“? The Claimants
particularly rely on RD 661/2007 that provides a tariff rate for 25 years which implies that
Respondent considered itself that the useful life was at least 25 years.°° The Claimants also
contend the Respondent’s assertion that the shorter useful lives (20 to 25 years) set out in
accounts of the Project Companies should be used, since those correspond to accounting
standards used for depreciation purposes which should not determine whether they are
reasonable assumptions for calculating the fair market value of the Claimants’ investments

under the ECT.®!

Concerning the recent disposal of Andasol for EUR 173 million (with EUR 77.7 million for

the Claimants which owned 45% of the shares), the Claimants consider that this amount is

consistent with their valuation made in 2014: 67 million. Brattle explains the 10 million

differences by:

“(i) the passage of time, (ii) the repayment of debt, (iii) a reduction in the
Spanish corporate tax rate and (iv) changes in macroeconomic variables,
including a drop in interest rates between June 2014 and July 2017, which
prompts a reduction in the relevant discount rate. These changes have the
net effect of increasing the value of future cash flows and the equity value
of the Andasol Plants in July 2017.”
534. The Claimants’ experts also point out the difference between the original regime that allows
investors to earn more than the reasonable return if they operate efficiently and the new

regime which:

“has adopted new, stricter cost targets that consider reductions in costs that
investors achieved only after the establishment of the Original Regulatory
Regime and before the introduction of the New Regulatory Regime. In
effect, the New Regulatory Regime has used hindsight to shift the target.
The result is to appropriate the benefits that existing investors previously
earned by beating the initial target of the Original Regulatory Regime.”*?

535. The Claimants state that they invested a large amount of money in order to have efficient
plants since the previous regime allocated a remuneration which was function on the reality
of the production. They claim that given these important investments the new remuneration
scheme deprives them from receiving a reasonable return since it is not based on the reality

and the efficiency of the production and therefore does not promote anymore the efficient

installations.4

536. The Claimants further assert that the Respondent’s target rates of return are set by reference

to “standard facilities”, with defined costs and production parameters. The differences

between these targets and the IRR in reality “result from the differences in costs and

production between the Claimants’ plants and the relevant standard installation.”®°>

ii. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent considers that the rate of return has always been per project. It asserts that
the regulatory framework ensures a reasonable project IRR since its very purpose is to make
renewables projects competitive compared to conventional producers.’ The Respondent
denies the relevance of shareholders IRRs but considers that they are, in this case, higher
than project IRRs.°*

Considering the sale of Andasol, the Respondent asserts that, if the previous investors had
kept the project, their shareholders’ IRR would have been 10% post-tax.®° The Respondent
recognizes that the Claimants’ return has been much lower because they paid an important
premium when they acquired Andasol. The Respondent’s position is that the weight of this
decision must be borne only by Claimants and cannot in any way be attributed to the

Respondent.°@

The Respondent considers that the distinction between holding and exit IRRs is not relevant
for the resolution of the dispute and does not strip out macroeconomic effects as the
Claimants assert. Furthermore, according to the Respondent, both calculations lead to the
same result.°!

The Respondent argues that Claimants’ valuation is erroneous because it artificially extends
the hypothetical financial impact of the measures. In its calculations, Brattle assumed a useful

life of 40 years for solar thermal plants and 25 years for wind farms, in circumstances that

175

their useful life is at most 25 and 20 years, respectively. The Respondent notes that such
shorter useful life was declared in the companies’ official accounting, was envisioned in the
banking files for financing the projects of the solar thermal plants, was estimated in the
operation and maintenance contracts for the installations of the wind farms, and in the project
report on RD 661/2007 and PER 2005-2010. In the view of the Respondent taking into
account a useful life comprised between 20 and 25 years is further supported by reports by
engineering experts on solar thermal plants.°™

The Respondent also contends that Brattle’s calculations failed to consider the costs of
necessary renovations for the solar thermal plants; that their storage system will probably
become inoperative in 25 years, reducing the number of hours of operation; and that a
substantial change in the components of the plant would cause under RD 661/2007 a “new
date of entry into service” making inapplicable the subsidy of RD 661/2007.% The
Respondent clarifies that for the purposes of simplifying comparisons with Brattle’s DCF
calculation, BDO’s alternative valuation did not consider any of these factors related to the
useful life of the technical components of solar thermal plants, but still led to a positive

financial impact. Had they been considered; the positive impact would be even greater.

The Respondent denies that the profitability under the previous regime was calculated taking

into account the particular costs of each investor:

“The premiums established in RD 661/2007 were set with the objective of
providing a typical facility with a return of approximately 7%, in
accordance with the standards set in PER 2005-2010: the CAPEX of a
typical facility, the OPEX of a typical facility, equivalent operating hours,
unit costs, execution periods, useful life and sales prices of the final energy
unit.

This methodology was not a novelty introduced in PER 2005-2010. In
December 1999, PFER 2000-2010%° was approved in execution of LSE
54/1997. PFER 2000-2010 set the implementation objectives for renewable
energies to a yearly upwards trend of electrical demand equal to 2%. Like
its successor (PER 2005-2010), the PFER 2000-2010 followed a
methodology consisting in defining, within the scope of each technology
and according to the state of the art at the time, different typical facilities.
Once said typical facilities have been determined, different standards shall
be established for each one (investment costs, operating costs, useful life of
the plant, primed production hours, market price) which would allow said
plant to reach, within a certain amount of time (useful life) a reasonable
return according to the cost of money in the capital market®’. The
profitability of typical projects was estimated at ‘7 % with company
resources, before financing and after taxes’ °°”.
The Respondent denies that the new regime would discriminate against efficient and
expensive installations like the Claimants’ ones since the Claimants can still reduce their

operation costs in order to be more efficient and obtain a higher remuneration.°”
b. The Tribunal’s Analysis

First of all, the Tribunal has to decide if the reasonable return protected by the Tribunal is the

project IRR or the Shareholders IRR.

There can be no doubt that the ECT protects shareholder interests. As such, it ensures to them
the right to a fair and equitable treatment, including the respect of their legitimate
expectations. As the Tribunal already explained, the only legitimate expectations the
Claimants had in this case was to obtain the reasonable return that the Respondent was
committed to. It is therefore necessary to look precisely at the Respondent’s commitment.
Both the Claimants and the Respondent agree that the reasonable return targeted by the

Spanish law is a project IRR. The Tribunal see no reason to decide otherwise.

177

Consequently, the premium paid by the Claimants to acquire Andasol has no impact on the
calculation of the reasonable return provided by the Respondent to Andasol as a project. The
Spanish energy regulatory framework has been conceived in order to have a general scope
and to apply to projects of all kinds. It was not the objective of the regulator to take into
account the particularities of each installation and of the various modes of financing. The
Tribunal considers that there is no objection in principle to this approach whether it concerns

the definition of standard financing costs or operating costs.

However, the Tribunal agrees with the Blusun tribunal that regulatory evolutions can be

modified by the regulator on the condition that it is done:

“in a manner which is not disproportionate to the aim of the legislative
amendment, and should have due regard to the reasonable reliance interests
of recipients who may have committed substantial resources on the basis of
the earlier regime.”°”!
In assessing the reasonableness of the return earned by the Claimants, the Tribunal will

therefore take into consideration the actual IRR that their projects have received and not only

the target fixed by the Respondent.

The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the distinction made between the exit IRR and
the holding IRR does not have a major impact on the calculation. As the IRR determined to
be applicable in this case by the Tribunal is the project IRR,°” it is assumed that the
profitability will be calculated during the whole life of the investment, that is the lifetime of

the plant.

Consequently, the lifetime of the plants has a major impact on these calculations. Future cash
flows are not infinite and are limited in time by this lifetime. The Tribunal has paid due
attention to counsel’s presentations and experts’ reports and to the decisions of other tribunals

in similar cases. The tribunal in the Charanne case considered that the lifetime of the plants

178

would be in average, 27.5 years. ° The Eiser tribunal, before which the same experts
intervened, found Dr Servert’s evidences much more reliable than Dr Mancini’s opinion and
retained a service life of 25 years.°’* The Tribunal agrees that the useful lifetime of CSP
Plants should be considered to be 25 years, which corresponds to the Claimants’ assessment

in several occasions prior to the referral of the case to the Tribunal.°”°

Concerning the disposal of Andasol by the Claimants, the Tribunal considers it as a factual
element which can be useful to assess the market value of the investment and the
reasonableness of the return.°”° Nevertheless, this event does not have a direct impact on the
calculation of the IRR since it is a project IRR calculated for the whole life of the plants; in

such a case, the sale of the investment is irrelevant.

2. Is the Claimants’ return under the new regime reasonable with reference
to the cost of money on the capital market?

a. The Parties’ Positions
i. The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants consider that the reasonable return is a target used by Spain to set the FIT.°””
Responding to the Tribunal’s request for additional information, the Claimants explain that
regulator’s target dropped from a pre-tax 12.2% (Andasol), 11.6% (Arenales), 8% (Wind),
to 7.398% for all.°”* To calculate these targets on the previous regime, the Claimants rely on
the internal report of the Ministry of Industry Tourism and Commerce on RD 661/2007 which

envisaged a reasonable return post-tax around 9.5% for CSP and 7% for wind farms.°”?

According to Brattle, the pre-tax IRRs of the projects under the new regime are respectively:
7.4% (Andasol 1), 6.9% (Andasol 2), 6.7% (Arenales), 13.6% (San Lorenzo C), 13.2% (San
Lorenzo D), 13% (Esquilvent).°*°

Contrary to RD 661/2007, the new regime fixes the reasonable return in abstracto, without
taking into consideration the specific investment and operating costs. It has the effect of
reducing the reasonable return from 9.5% on average after-tax for CSP and 7% for wind to
5.8% and 6.5% after-tax respectively.**!

The Claimants reject the Respondent’s calculation which claims that they made a 10% equity
IRR after the sale of Andasol. Their own calculation — taking into consideration their paid

premium -— leads to a 2.7% equity IRR.°**

The Claimants assert that the Respondent’s justification that it had to amend the scheme to
keep the return reasonable considering the cost of money on capital market is not credible.
They argue that (1) the reasonable return is not a dynamic concept; (2) the return under the
previous regime was not considered as unreasonable by the Respondent in 2007; and (3) the

cost of money on capital market has not changed between 2007 and 2013.°°>

Brattle challenges BDO’s calculation of the “cost of money”. Their own calculation of the
weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is 8.148% post-tax.°** To calculate this cost, they
based themselves on a risk-free rate of 4.398% which corresponds to the average yield on
ten-year Spanish government bonds.®*° They add a market risk premium of 5.5%, an
unleveraged beta of 0.5 and a 1% premium that represents what the Respondent used to
attract foreign investors. According to them, the WACC post-tax would be 8.148% and the

pre-tax 11.640%, considering a 30% corporate tax rate.

The Claimants’ experts challenge the Respondent’s claim that there was a higher regulatory
risk under the previous regime since they consider that the continuous changes in the regime

have increased the risk.°*°

The Claimants rely on their experts who explain that considering that Arenales production is
higher than the Andasol Plants, the shift from a production-based FIT (EUR per MWh) to a
capacity-based incentive payment (EUR per MW) had an additional adverse impact on this
plant.°*” The Claimants disagree with the Respondent’s experts that claim that Arenales has

an installed capacity of more than SOMW.%*

The Claimants’ experts have performed the disaggregation of their valuation, with five heads
of claim corresponding to the five disputed measures: (a) the 7% Levy; (b) removal of the
Pool + Premium Option; (c) change of inflation indexation; (d) removal of premiums for
production with natural gas; and (e) ultimate switch to the New Regulatory Regime.
Considering that all these measures are interlinked, they calculated various scenarios

represented in the following table:°°°

ii. The Respondent’s Position

560. Answering the Tribunal’s request for additional information, the Respondent states that the
actual pre-tax project IRRs are 8.2% (Andasol 1), 7.5% (Andasol 2), 5.7% (Arenales), 13.1%
(San Lorenzo C), 12.6% (San Lorenzo D), 12.9% (Esquilvent).®” It considers that these

returms are consistent with the target 7.398% and that therefore the Claimants have suffered

182

no damage.®! Furthermore, the Respondent claims that the actual equity IRRs that the

investors are obtaining are even higher, between 7.4% and 51.8%”.

The Respondent disagrees with the Claimants’ appreciation of the targets under the previous

regime. According to the Respondent, which relies on the REPs,*?

the regulator targets were
a 7% post-tax and not a 9.5% post-tax for the CSP plants.°* The Respondent questions as
well the rates used by the Claimants to convert the IRRs from post-tax to pre-tax, considering
that they imagine taxes that are never paid by plants thanks to a large number of tax

deductions.

The Respondent considers that the reasonable return is dynamic: “the cost of money on the
capital market is not simply a ‘programme criterion’. Far from it, it is a comparison criterion
imposed by law that allows the regulator to determine whether profitability at a given time is
reasonable or not.”°°

The Respondent considers that the projected IRR under the new regime is reasonable, since
it covers standard investment and operation costs and allows a return higher than the cost of
money.®” The Respondent’ s experts calculated this cost of money by reference to the WACC
for the renewable sector in Spain as of June 2014.°8 To calculate the WACC, BDO uses the
average return of Germany’s ten-year bonds of the month of June 2014 as a risk-free rate,
then adds a country risk premium of 1.41%, a market risk premium of 5.5% and a levered
beta of 0.84 (calculated on the basis of an unleveraged beta of 0.41%). The result is a 7.43%

post-tax shareholders’ cost. Considering that the cost of the debt is 3.21% (calculated with

the average return of the 10-year Euribor swap plus a debt spread of 3.01% and a tax rates of
30%) and that the financial structure of the plants is 60% equity / 40% debt, BDO concludes
that the WACC post-tax was 4.90% in June 2014.7° The Respondent’s experts did the same

calculations for each year from 1998 to 2038.7°!

The Respondent’s experts explain that the “reasonable return is closely linked to the risk of

‘ 9702
an investment.”7

BDO considers that under the but-for scenario, the revenue would be
subject to greater risk and greater uncertainty than in the current scenario, where, the
Respondent argues, there is a stable, more predictable framework with less risk.7°? The
Respondent considers that, in view of the important deficit of the previous regime, there was
a risk of collapse which has to be taken into consideration in the assessment of the

reasonableness of the Claimants’ return.

The Respondent has made the breakdown of damages requested by the Tribunal and draws

the following conclusions from those new calculations:

“i. Law 15/2012 (gas+tax) amounts for more than half the damages
calculated by Brattle.

ii. RDL 9/2013 and subsequent disputed measures amount to no damage
whatsoever (it improves the cash-flows and the value of the investment).

iii. Particularly, if Tribunal finds that its jurisdiction does not cover the 7%
tax, damages must be reduced between € 53M and € 67M, depending on the
assumption on useful life.””*

b. The Tribunal’s Analysis

567. It is an undisputed fact between the Parties that the actual return targeted by the new regime
is a 7.398% pre-tax project IRR. However, they do not agree on the targeted return under the
previous regime. The Claimants consider that the pre-tax project IRR under the previous
regime was between 12% and 8% and the Respondent recognizes at least a 7% post-tax IRR.
The Tribunal does not find it necessary to determine the precise IRR under the previous

regime. It must only be noted that, indisputably, the IRR under the new regime is lower than

568.

569.

705

185

under the previous one. This does not give any indication on the reasonableness of the return
under the new regime. As the Tribunal already stressed, the Respondent has the possibility
to modify this return as long as it remains reasonable. The Tribunal then considers that this
return is not fixed and may evolve, depending on the cost of money in the capital market. In
other words: (1) what could have been considered as reasonable in 2007 might not be
reasonable anymore in 2012 or 2014; and (2) “reasonable” is not an absolute notion and a
reasonable return does not correspond, even at a given date to a fix number, but rather to a

range of possible numbers.

As the Tribunal considers that the reality of the actual IRR must be assessed, it is in order to
look at the numbers put forward by both Parties. The following table represents their

calculation of the actual IRR under the new regime:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Claimants Respondent
Andasol I 74% 8.2%
Andasol II 6.9% 7.5%
Arenales Solar 6.7% 5.7%
CSP Assets 7.0% 71.2%
San Lorenzo C 13.6% 13.1%
San Lorenzo D 13.2% 12.6%
Esquilvent 13.0% 12.9%
Wind Assets 13.1% 13.0%

 

 

 

 

As shown in this table, the Parties agree on the order of magnitude of the pre-tax IRR under
the new regime. For the wind assets, the return is around 13%, well above the 7.398% target
provided by the regulator as well as well above the cost of money in the capital market”.
The Tribunal is conscious that these figures are pre-tax figures; however, whatever the impact
of the taxes on the returns on the Claimants’ investment, these returns are obviously

reasonable when referenced to the cost of money in the capital market. Therefore, concerning

572.

186

the Wind Assets, the Respondent has not breached its obligation to insure a reasonable return

to the Claimants.

The Tribunal will focus now its analysis on CSP assets for which calculations of both Parties
are also similar. According to Brattle, the difference between the respective experts of the
Parties concerning Andasol and Arenales is explained by the use of higher capital costs and
production levels.”°°

To assess the reasonability of these returns, the Tribunal has to calculate post-tax figures.
The Tribunal considers that taxes are costs impacting the return of the Claimants’
investments. Therefore, taxes must be taken into consideration for the global assessment of
the reasonable return to which the Claimants are entitled and the IRR should be evaluated
post-tax. This applies in particular to the 7% levy. The Tribunal recognizes that Article 21(1)
of the ECT is a carve-out from the Tribunal’s jurisdiction and, therefore, it does not take a
decision over the legality of the levy. But this does not change the fact that the levy has an
impact on the return. In this respect, the Tribunal recalls that it has decided that the 7% levy

has to be taken into account in this calculation.”°”

The Parties disagree on the targeted post-tax project under the new regime. The Claimants
consider that 7.398% IRR pre-tax is equivalent to an average 5.8% IRR post-tax for CSP
plants; for its part, the Respondent denies these rates but without giving its own numbers.
More precisely and still according to Claimants, the tax rates are 18.3% for Arenales and
21.8% for Andasol I and II, depending on the particular profile of depreciation of each asset.
Absent any indication by any of the Parties concerning the origin and nature of the applicable
taxes, the Tribunal will take for granted that these rates are accurate and include the 7% levy.

The table below reflects the post-tax IRRs based on the figures given by the Parties.

Concerning the shareholders’ IRRs after the disposal of Andasol, the Tribunal notes that the
numbers are not disputed by the Parties. They seem to agree that the greenfield investors
made a 10% IRR and that the Claimants’ made a return much lower considering the premium
they paid to acquire Andasol. The Claimants evaluate this IRR at 2.7%. These data can
inform the Tribunal on the reality of the return for Claimants but do not have a direct impact
on the assessment of the reasonableness of the return provided by the Respondent to the
plants. Indeed, as the Tribunal has already explained,”°* the Respondent’s legal framework

guarantees a project reasonable return and not a shareholders’ reasonable return.

According to Act 54/1997, the reasonable return should be assessed “with reference to the
cost of money in the capital market”. The Tribunal understands this reference to the cost of
money in the capital market as a guideline to assess the reasonableness of the return generated
by the plants. Under this cost of money, a project is likely to be seen as being not profitable,
and no investor would likely invest in it. A reasonable return has therefore to be superior to
this cost of money. To calculate this cost of money, both Parties calculated the WACC, which
“reflects the cost of raising funds from shareholders and lenders for a typical company
operating in a given industry.””°°

The cost of money should be calculated at a particular date, taking into consideration the

economic factors at this date. Considering that this Tribunal calculates a WACC for the sole

188

purpose of comparing it to the remuneration defined in RDL 9/2013, the date should be the

same that the one retained in the law: June 2013.

Both Parties have calculated a post-tax WACC for renewable energy companies. They differ
significantly in their results. The Respondent calculates a WACC of 4.9% while the
Claimants’ calculation comes to about 8.148%. This difference lies mainly in the fact that
the Claimants have only calculated a cost of equity, using Capital Asset Pricing Model
(CAPM), while the Respondent calculated both a cost of equity and a cost of debts, taking

into consideration the common financial structure of the projects.

The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent approach. Considering that the reasonable return
provided by the Respondent is allocated to the project, it seems logical to take into
consideration the financial structure of the whole project. The return obtained by the projects
will be used to remunerate both equity and debt. The Tribunal follows the Respondent
calculation on this point and accepts the following financial structure: debt 60% / equity 40%.
Consequently, it will be necessary to leverage the beta, that is the “company’s systematic

risk”,”!° in the calculation of the cost of equity, as does the Respondent.

The remaining difference comes from the fact that the Claimants use the average yield on
ten-year Spanish government bonds as the risk-free rate (4.98%) while the Respondent uses
the ten-year German government bonds (1.38%) as a risk-free rate to which it adds a “country
risk premium” of 1.41%. Furthermore, the Claimants add a 1% premium since it represents

what the Government agreed to add in 2007 in order to attract more investments.

The Tribunal recalls that it is common to use a country risk premium to calculate the CAPM.

As the tribunal in the Tidewater v. Venezuela case put it:

“Rather the country risk premium quantifies the general risks, including
political risks, of doing business in the particular country, as they applied
on that date and as they might then reasonably have been expected to affect

the prospects, and thus the value to be ascribed to the likely cash flow of
the business going forward.

tribunals’ calculations of compensation, since, as one tribunal observed ‘the
fundamental issue of country risk [is] obvious to the least sophisticated
businessman.””7!!

be considered “reasonable”.

by the Novenergia tribunal, which considered that:

“it cannot be correct to assume a higher risk in a scenario where the
regulatory framework of the RE sector would have remained stable and RD
661/2007 would have continued to remain in force as originally
implemented. The facts of the case show that under the Special Regime, the
Respondent managed to attract numerous investors to the tune of billions of
euros, indicating that the risk was considered low. Conversely, under the
Specific Regime, it is not reasonable to conclude that the risk is lower,
especially considering that the current remuneration system is subject to
periodic reviews and the turmoil that they have caused.”7!*

189

Concerning an investment in Spain, the Tribunal is more convinced by the Claimants
approach to use the average yield on ten-year Spanish government bonds as the relevant free-
risk rate. All the more so that RDL 9/2013 itself provides that “[s]uch reasonable return will

be based on, before taxes, the average returns in the secondary market of the State’s ten-year

The difference between the cost of money and the reasonable return has to be evaluated

according to the risk for the investor. The higher the risk, the higher the return should be to

There is a risk that the regulatory framework may change and this is part of the risk that the

investors should assume. In this respect, the Tribunal cannot concur with the analysis made

First of all, a low risk itself has never attracted any investor. The risk has a meaning only
regarding the potential remuneration. If the investors were attracted by the Respondent
previous regime, it is because they have considered the remuneration attractive enough,
considering the risk. Furthermore, the Novenergia Tribunal seems to confuse the risk which
is a potential fact and the realisation of this risk itself. If the previous regime would have
remained stable, the risk would not be realised, but it does not make it higher or lower. The

fact is that the risk happened, the regime changed.

In certain respects, the risk is lower under the new regime considering that the Respondent
ensured a better sustainability of the whole system. It is only by considering that the
Respondent could not lawfully modify the previous regime that the risk under the previous
regime could be considered lower than under the new regime, but the Tribunal already
explained this assumption is wrong.’'+ Moreover, a return of 7.398 % pre-tax is guaranteed

5

under the new regime which provides for strict time limits for its revision,’!> while the

previous regime gave no guarantee of fixed return on investment.

Considering the calculation of the market and systemic risks, both Parties agree that the
market risk premium is 5.5%! but differ on the beta to apply. Claimants retains a 0.5% beta
while Respondent chose a 0.41% beta. This difference results from the Parties’ divergence
in risk assessment under the new regime. The Tribunal considers that both demonstrations

are equally sustainable and therefore retains a 0.455% beta.

In summary, the WACC should be calculated in June 2013, taking into consideration the
Spanish 10 years bond as the risk-free rate that is 4.398%, a market risk premium of 5.5%, a
beta of 0.455%, a ratio debt/equity of 60/40 and a cost of debt of 3.43% in 2013 (as calculated
by the Respondent and taking into consideration that both Parties use the 30% corporate tax

rates”). The WACC calculated by the Tribunal on this basis is 5.86%.

191

The Tribunal considers that a return would not be reasonable if the project IRR is lower than
the WACC thus calculated. Moreover, the Tribunal also considers that, in the particular
circumstances of the case, the Claimants had legitimate expectations that the return on their
investment would be above the mere level of the WACC since the Respondent attracted

investments in the renewable energy sector by raising hope of above-average profits.

According to Brattle, the Respondent’s regulator seems to have retained a 1% supplementary
“premium to induce additional investment”’!*. This figure has not been challenged by the
Respondent, which considers that nothing should be added, and represents, in the view of the
Tribunal, a fair addition to the WACC calculated as indicated above in order to assess

whether the actual return obtained by the Claimants is reasonable.

Consequently, the Tribunal considers that the reasonable return must not be below 6.86%
post-tax. In this respect, the Tribunal notes that according to the calculations of both

Parties,’!?

the IRR of each CSP plant is lower than 6.86%. The actual return earned by
Claimants for their CSP plants thus does not fulfil the legitimate expectation of the Claimants
in the special circumstances of the case. Consequently, the Respondent must be held
responsible for a breach of its obligation to insure a reasonable return to the Claimants
investment and it must pay to them a compensation amounting to the difference between

their actual return and the reasonable return as calculated above by the Tribunal: 6.86%.

As explained above, ””° since the retroactive application of the new regime is duly taken into
account for assessing the reasonableness of the return, there is no reason to compensate
specifically for the retroactivity imposed by the Respondent since it is found in breach of its
obligation to insure a reasonable return of the Claimants. Otherwise: this would result in

compensating twice for the same damage.

720 See supra para. 483.

591.

592.

593.

594.

192

However, a separate compensation for the breach of the non-retroactivity principle is due
with respect to the wind plants for which the Tribunal has already accepted that the new

regime ensures a reasonable return of the Claimants’ investment.7?!

VIII. THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION

The Tribunal is unable to make the calculations necessary to determine both the actual IRR
per project and the partially retroactive application of the Respondent’s measures on the basis
of the data provided by the Parties. The Respondent stands by its position that it has fully
complied with its obligations and cannot be held responsible for any breach and, therefore,
that no compensation is due. For their part, the Claimants have offered rather detailed
indication on the calculation of the compensation allegedly due to them as a consequence of
the Respondent’s responsibility, but they base themselves on premises partly different from

those adopted by the Tribunal.

In such conditions, to use the pictorial words reported in a previous ICSID tribunal interim
decision, given the present state of the evidence the Tribunal should not “take as its task
picking and choosing between the experts on each issue one by one, cafeteria-style” and,
exactly like that tribunal, the present Tribunal considers that it “does not possess the requisite
technical expertise to decide between experts’ disagreements over highly technical issues —
it is equally uncomfortable with simply picking one set of experts’ conclusions over the
other.”7”?

In the opinion of this Tribunal, the similarities with the case of Perenco Ecuador go further.

Like the tribunal in that case, this Tribunal:

“well understands that the onus of proof is on a party who makes an
allegation and it could be said that because of the doubt in which the
Tribunal finds itself Ecuador [in the present case Spain] could be said to
have failed in tipping the burden in its favour. However, as the Tribunal is
satisfied that there has been some damage for which it seems likely that

721 See supra para. 569.
2 Perenco Ecuador Limited v. Republic of Ecuador (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6), Interim Decision on the
Environmental Counterclaim, 11 August 2015, para. 585.

595.

596.

597.

193

Perenco [the Respondent in the present case] is liable, the Tribunal is not
disposed to dismiss the counterclaim [the claim concerning the reasonable
return] in limine. [...]

586. Accordingly, the Tribunal has concluded that it must require an
additional phase of factfinding in order to arrive at a proper and just
conclusion. It is not content to issue a final determination on the extent of
Perenco’s [Spain’s in the present case] liability on the basis of the current
expert reports.

587. As already intimated, the Tribunal intends to appoint its own
independent environmental expert who will be instructed to apply the
Tribunal’s findings set out above and work with the Tribunal and the Parties
to enable the Tribunal to determine the extent of contamination in the
Blocks for which compensation is owed.”73
In such circumstances, a choice is open to the Tribunal: either it could appoint its own expert
to enable it to determine the actual return on their investments received by the Claimants and
the losses they have suffered as a result of the breach of the principle of non-retroactivity by

the Respondent; or it could ask the Parties to settle their differences in these respects in view

of the precise Tribunal’s findings exposed above.

The Tribunal is satisfied that the Parties’ experts are highly qualified and have a thorough
knowledge of the case and that the different results obtained by them are the consequences
of the different premises on which their calculations (when effected) are made. In these
circumstances, the Tribunal is persuaded that, with the assistance of their respective experts,
the Parties could reach an agreement on the impact of the wrongful retroactive application of
the new regime concerning the wind plants belonging to the Claimants, as well as the actual

return on the Claimants’ investments evaluated according with the indication given above.

Therefore the Tribunal considers it appropriate and more economical to invite the Parties to
attempt to seek agreement on the two points mentioned above — based on the findings
contained in the present decision.’*4 Failing agreement reached between the Parties within a

period on which they are invited to agree within ten days from the notification of this

decision, the Tribunal will, following consultation with the Parties, fix a calendar for

submissions of the Parties on the remaining data to be decided. In case at the end of the

specified period — or if the Parties inform the Tribunal that they are unable to reach an

agreement on these two issues any time before the expiry of this period — the Tribunal will

appoint its own expert to that end.

On the basis of the agreement of the Parties or assisted by its own expert, the Tribunal will

decide on the amount of the compensation due to the Claimants.

The Tribunal also reserves its decision concerning interest and tax on the one hand and the

costs on the other hand.

For the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides as follows:

(6)

2)

Unanimously: The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to decide on the 7% levy;
Unanimously: The Respondent is in breach of its obligations under the ECT for the
retroactive application of the new regime; this breach concerns both the Wind plants
and the CSP plants belonging to the Claimants;

By majority: With respect to each of the CSP Plants, the Respondent is in breach of
its obligation to insure a reasonable return to the Claimants’ investment insofar as
this return per plant is lower than the WACC + 1% as defined by the Tribunal;

By majority: All other claims and requests of the Parties are dismissed;

By majority: The Parties are directed to attempt to reach an agreement on the amount
of compensation to be paid by the Respondent to the Claimants in respect of its
breaches of its obligations as defined in paragraphs (3) an (4) above, in accordance
with the Tribunal’s findings;

By majority: Absent an agreement within the period specified in conformity with
paragraph (7) below, the Tribunal will proceed to the nomination of an independent
expert to assist it in the calculation of the final amount of damages;

By majority: The Parties are directed to find an agreement within ten days following

the notification of the present decision on a reasonable schedule for the

implementation of paragraph (5) above; failing an agreement on this point, the
Tribunal will fix a schedule to this end;
(8) By majority: The decisions on interest, tax and costs are reserved and will be fixed in

the final Award.
