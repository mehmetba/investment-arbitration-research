DECISION 719

INTRODUCTION
1. On 22 May 2008, Latvia and the Kyrgyz Republic entered into an
A for the P ‘ion and P of I lin doing so,

 

both countries made public commitments to improving bilateral relations
and ensuring that investors would be treated fairly and equitably and in
accordance with international law.

2. This bilateral investment treaty (the “BIT”) came in the wake of the
signature by the Latvian and Kyrgyz Governments of an Agreement on
Economic, Industrial, Scientific and Technical Cooperation in the fall of
2007.” At this time, Mr. Valeri Belokon, a Latvian banker who owned the
Baltic International Bank, had been developing an interest in the Kyrgyz
banking sector.’

3. Acting on this interest, Mr. Belokon in 2007 acquired a Kyrgyz
bank, Insan, which he renamed Manas Bank. Drawing on the knowhow and
human resources of the Baltic International Bank, Manas Bank enjoyed
initial success.

4, That early success did not long endure. Although the previous
national elections (held in 2005) had been internationally acknowledged as
fair and free, by the spring of 2010 acute political tension had arisen in the
Kyrgyz capital, Bishkek. Widespread protests erupted in the streets against
the perceived financial misfeasance of the President, Kurmanbek Bakiev.
Ultimately, he was made to abandon the Presidency.

5. During this period of turmoil, on 8 April 2010, the Kyrgyz National
Bank issued Decree No 10/1 suspending the powers of the Boards and
managing bodies of five Kyrgyz Banks, including Manas Bank.*

6. Although the turbulence of regime change abated rather quickly, the
National Bank has not revoked the emergency measures. More than four
years later, Manas Bank remains under government control.

7. Asserting that this control was and remains justified, the Kyrgyz
Republic has made grave allegations against Manas Bank, Mr. Belokon, and
his employees, to the effect that they were guilty of money laundering and
other serious criminal activities. The Claimant retorts that the accusations
are baseless, and that his investment was despoiled in a manner that
breached the BIT and entitles him to compensation from the Respondent.

THE PARTIES

8. The Claimant, Mr. Valeri Belokon, is a citizen of Latvia.’ He is the
sole shareholder of Manas Bank, which is the entity embodying his
investment in the Kyrgyz Republic.® He is also the owner of Baltic
International Bank in Latvia, in addition to various other business ventures
and philanthropic projects.

9. The Respondent is the Kyrgyz Republic. The Claimant has alleged
wrongdoing by the Kyrgyz National Bank and the state prosecutor. The
Respondent has not disputed that responsibility of actions by these entities
are attributable to the Kyrgyz Republic.’

THE PROCEDURE

10. The Claimant submitted a Request for Arbitration dated 2 August
2011, in which he nominated Mr. Kaj Hobér as co-arbitrator. On 5
September 2011, the Respondent nominated Mr. Niels Schiersing as co-
arbitrator. On 30 September 2011, Mr. Jan Paulsson informed the Parties of
his acceptance of the co-arbitrators’ request that he preside over these
proceedings.

11. The Tribunal was constituted on 30 September 2011.

quantum report and to a witness statement, that is to say 12 days prior to the
originally scheduled December 2012 hearing start which had not yet been
vacated.

 

22. Additional submissions were made in the lead up to the December
2013 hearing and are discussed in more detail below.

Gii) Requests for Stays of Proceedings

23. When submitting its 30 March 2012 Statement of Defense, the
Respondent requested a stay of proceedings, of unspecified duration, due to
alleged ongoing criminal investigations in the Kyrgyz Republic relating to
the Claimant and Manas Bank. After considering submissions from the
Parties, the Tribunal decided on 15 May 2012 that no stay of proceedings
was warranted, but acknowledged that the Respondent was at liberty to
resubmit a similar request in the future if “there are concrete indications that
the criminal proceedings are likely to provide imminent, specific, and
relevant evidence.”'*

24, On 8 December 2012, the Tribunal dismissed an application for a
stay of proceedings brought by Respondent on 30 November 2012 on
account of information obtained regarding criminal investigations in New
York against the former President’s son, Maxim Bakiev.'® The Tribunal
found that there was not “a sufficient nexus established between the
materials adduced in support of the application and the issues that arise in
the arbitration.” However, the Tribunal reserved the possibility of

duction of further evidenc ding criminal p dings should they
come to light.

25. On 9 December 2012, the Tribunal issued a Procedural Order
affirming its decision not to stay the proceedings and laying out the
procedure of the forthcoming scheduled hearing.'? The schedule was
thereafter modified as explained in Paragraph 14 above.

(ivy) Supplemental Submissions

26. On 27 September 2013, the Claimant filed two supplemental witness
statements and a reply expert report in response to the quantum evaluation
of East Star Capital of 20 November 2012.!° The hard copies and exhibits
were received by the Respondent on 9 October 2013.1

27. | On1 November 2013, the Claimant filed a supplemental submission,
including new witness statements and an updated quantum report.

28. On 14 November 2013, the Respondent objected to the Claimant’s
new witness statements, expert reports, and supplemental submission.”! The
following day, the Claimant explained that:

(a) The Respondent had previously indicated that it intended to
amend its existing East Star Capital quantum report and that
the Claimant should wait before submitting an updated
report. The Claimant had understood that the Parties were in
agreement that the Claimant would file an updated quantum
report. When no update was received from Respondent, the
Claimant decided to submit its reply quantum report on
September 27, two and a half months prior to the hearing.

(b) With regard to the factual witness statements, these merely
updated the Tribunal on developing circumstances, and could
have alternatively been included during oral submissions.

(c) | The supplemental submissions withdrew a claim, provided
an update on criminal proceedings that could have been
included in the skeleton argument, and further explained
claims of harassment discussed in the 27 September 2013
witness statement of Mr. Belokon.

29, The Claimant noted that the Respondent suffered no prejudice from
its submissions as these submissions were provided two and a half months
prior to the hearing.”

30. On 18 November 2013, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that
by e-mail of 21 May 2013, they had indeed invited the Claimant to file an
updated quantum report.”? The Respondent indicated that it was “entitled to
be granted a fair amount of time to submit its own submissions addressing
the additional submissions of the Claimant.”

31, On 21 November 2013, the Tribunal noted that “procedural
dispensation can be made, as necessary, with respect to any of the issues of
timeliness of communications that have been raised, so as to avoid prejudice
to either side.”

32. On 26 November 2013, the Respondent indicated that the procedural
issues it had raised, regarding timing of submissions, had not been
adequately resolved.” The Respondent however did not raise any particular
issues with the substance of the additional materials submitted or its ability
to consider and respond to these materials adequately in time for the
hearing.

33. | On 26 November 2013, the Tribunal decided to admit the Claimant’s
jatest witness submissions and expert report. As for the Supplemental
Submission of 1 November 2013, the Tribunal decided that it was admitted,
subject to any specific difficulty Respondent may have had considering

particular exhibits.” No  particularized issues were raised by the
Respondent.

34, On 1 December 2013, the Claimant notified the Tribunal that it had
received some 110 pages of additional materials from the Respondent on 27
November 2013. These included a second report by East Star Capital, a
third witness statement by Ms. Mulkubatova, a second witness statement by
Rakhat Aiylchieva, and expert opinions on banking regulations as well as
criminal law procedures in the Kyrgyz Republic.

35. These materials were received some 8 days prior to the
commencement of the hearing.

(@® = The challenges to two members of the Tribunal

36. On 18 November 2013, the Respondent indicated that it would be
taising a challenge to Mr. Paulsson on account of his published academic

views and authorship of arbitral awards concerning the legal concept of
denial of justice.

37. On 21 November 2013, the Tribunal decided that the challenge to
Mr. Paulsson would not suspend the arbitration.”

38. The next day, the Respondent indicated that it would also be
bringing a challenge against Mr. Hobér, the co-arbitrator appointed by the
Claimant, for his alleged failure to provide a disclosure of his impartiality.?”

39. On 22 November 2013, the Respondent purported to submit these
two challenges to the “Secretary General” of UNCITRAL.”* On 28
November 2013, UNCITRAL informed the Respondent that it was not an
arbitral institution and did not deal with such matters. That same day, the
Respondent sought to submit its challenges to the Secretary-General of the
Permanent Court of Arbitration [“PCA”]. On 2 December 2013, the PCA

informed the Respondent of the relevant procedure for the challenges to be
considered.

40. On9 July 2014, the PCA gave notice that each Party had confirmed
its agreement that the Secretary-General of the PCA would act as appointing
authority for the purpose of deciding the challenges, and gave the parties as
well as the challenged arbitrators the opportunity to comment on the merits
of the challenges.

41. On 6 October 2014, after having considered the materials put before
him, the Secretary General of the PCA dismissed the challenges brought
against Professor Hobér and Professor Paulsson. Having considered it
prudent to keep it in abeyance pending the resolution of the challenges, the
Tribunal now issues this Award.

@i) = Attendance of Witnesses

42. On 22 November 2013, the Claimant notified the Respondent as to
which of the Respondent’s witnesses it intended to examine.

43. On 25 November, the Respondent indicated that it was awaiting the
resolution of the issues it had raised as to the timeliness of the Claimant’s
submissions and challenges to the Tribunal prior to indicating which
witnesses it wished to examine.”?

44. On 6 December 2013, the Respondent stated that only three of its
witnesses could make themselves available at the hearing due to visa issues,
and the others might be available by videoconference. The Tribunal
requested an explanation of the efforts made to obtain such visas.

45. During the hearing, the Respondent provided a letter of November
2013 which counsel had sent to the Kyrgyz National Bank informing them
that the testimony of certain individuals were requested and visas should be
obtained.

46. During oral examination, by videoconference, one witness noted that
she was unaware that her presence was requested in Paris and she had
therefore never taken any steps to obtain a visa. The Respondent indicated
this was an error by counsel.

(vii) Hearing and Post-Hearing Briefs

48. The hearing was conducted in Paris from 9-13 December 2013. The
procedural order for the hearing called for both Parties to have equal access
to the time available to present their case. Both Parties made full and equal
use of the allocated 27.5 hours of hearing time and were granted additional
time on 13 December 2013 to complete their examination of expert
witnesses.

49. Post-hearing briefs were received from both sides on 21 February
2014,

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

50. The Respondent has justified its actions against Manas Bank on the
grounds that it was engaged in money laundering operations and other
criminal activities. These were some of the grounds upon which a
Temporary Administrator was appointed to replace the board and
management of the Bank. These criminal allegations were also invoked as
grounds for repeatedly renewed sequestration orders against Manas Bank.

51. In the same way as with other Kyrgyz banks, the activities of Manas
Bank were subject to regular auditing and regulatory review. They had thus
been under an obligation to comply with requirements for regular reporting
and audits during its operations in 2008 and 2009. In no instance were
serious irregularities identified by the Kyrgyz National Bank [“the NBKR”].

52. Following the imposition of various administration regimes upon
Manas Bank, it has been subject to repeated investigations. It has been
investigated by the NBKR, and its activity has been reviewed by
administrators assigned by the NBKR. It has been investigated by the State
Prosecutor’s office and the Bishkek Prosecutor’s office. It has been subject
to administrative proceedings before the Kyrgyz Financial Intelligence
Service. It is said to have been subject to investigations, alluded to by the
Respondent as ongoing, by the State Service for Combating Economic
Crimes. It has been the subject of investigation by the Respondent’s experts,
East Star Capital.

53. The activities of Manas Bank were also subject to regular
verification prior to April 2010, In the course of the hearing, the arbitrators

BZ

were shows regular transaction reports provided by Manas Bank to the
NBKR with respect to possibly suspicious transactions, in accordance with
NBKR reporting requirements.

54. Be this as it may, the Respondent’s case appears to have as its focal
point that Manas Bank engaged in criminal activities, most notably money
laundering.

55. In addition, the Respondent has alleged that the Claimant acquired
Manas Bank through improper means. The Respondent suggests that the
Claimant may have rigged the bid for the acquisition of the pre-cursor of
Manas Bank, Insan Bank, stating that the only other bid was submitted by a
Kyrgyz lawyer in the banking industry who had previously given advice in
connection with the Claimant’s interest in investing in the Kyrgyz Republic.

56. — It seems useful at this stage first to review the facts surrounding the
acquisition of Manas Bank, before proceeding to consider the evidence
regarding its allegedly wrongful operations.

@ The Acquisition of Manas Bank

57. The Claimant developed an interest in the Kyrgyz Republic during
the mid-2000s.*° In early 2007, this interest crystallised into a desire to open
a commercial bank in the Kyrgyz Republic. In the summer of 2007 the
Kyrgyz National Bank published a call to tender for the acquisition and
rehabilitation of Insan Bank. A deadline of 27 August 2007 was set for
bids.*? Two bids for Insan Bank were reviewed by a committee for its
rehabilitation on 28 August 2007. The Committee unanimously decided to
accept the Claimant’s bid on the strength of Mr. Belokon’s business plan,
which called for paying off the bank’s existing debts, and his experience in
the Latvian banking sector.*”

58. The Insan Bank Rehabilitation Committee was required to have
received at least two bids for consideration before one could be accepted.
The Respondent has alleged that the bid for Insan Bank was rigged, as the

only other individual to bid for the bank, Mr. Eliseev, was a banking lawyer
who had previously advised the Claimant.

59, The Respondent affirms that had there not been a second bid, the
tender for Insan Bank would have been cancelled.** However, the Claimant
has argued that a new call to tender would have been issued as Insan Bank’s
creditors would have continued to seek recovery by selling the Bank.”

60. The Tribunal finds it likely that had no second bidder shown interest
in Insan Bank then further calls for tender would have ensued. However,
even if the Tribunal is wrong in this conclusion, it accepts that the Claimant
could have applied for a new banking license.

61. The Respondent’s evidence of the alleged bid rigging consists of the
fact that the second bidder for Insan Bank was a banking lawyer who had
previously worked with the Claimant and his associates. The Claimant does
not deny that a prior attorney-client relationship had existed, and that there
were subsequent contacts between Mr. Eliseev and individuals associated
with Manas Bank. The Claimant has stated that Mr. Eliseev also
unsuccessfully tried to acquire a separate bank, Akilinvestbank, in 2008.3*
The Respondent has not challenged this assertion.

62. The Tribunal is in no position to make a positive determination as to
the Respondent’s allegati since no borati id has been
placed before it. The mere relationship between the Claimant and Mr.
Eliseev is insufficient to prove fraud in connection with the investment. The
Tribunal particularly notes that the Insan Bank committee appeared quite
impressed with the bid by the Claimant for Insan Bank. Also, the Tribunal
accepts that even in the absence of a bid by Mr. Eliseev, the Claimant may
well have acquired a banking license in the Kyrgyz Republic.

63. — In addition, the Respondent has suggested that there was something
improper about the Claimant’s investment in the Kyrgyz Republic as the
Claimant was acquainted with the son of Kurmanbek Bakiev, the deposed
Kyrgyz leader.

64. Again, the Tribunal is in no position to make a positive
determination that there was anything improper in the Claimant’s
acquaintance with Mr. Bakiev’s son, Maxim Bakiev, which was not shown
to have been more than superficial.

65. The Tribunal concludes that insufficient evidence has been placed
before it of any wrongdoing in the acquisition and establishment of Manas
Bank.

Gi) ‘Imposition of Temporary Administration of Manas
Bank and Seizures by Kyrgyz Authorities

66. In April 2010, as noted, the Kyrgyz Republic underwent a regime
change and removed President Bakiev. A key concern of the National Bank
during the transition was to ensure stability in the banking sector.” As
further explained below, protection of the Kyrgyz banking system took two
prongs, the imposition of temporary administration regimes over banks and
investigations into those banks by prosecutors and other agencies.

67. This section of the Award sets out (a) the events of April 2010, (b)
the consequences of temporary administration on Manas Bank, (c) efforts by
Manas Bank and the Claimant to challenge the temporary administration
order and its effects, and (d) the extension of temporary administration
beyond the six months permitted under Kyrgyz law.

a. The Events of April 2010

68. On 8 April 2010, the NBKR issued Decree No 10/1, establishing
temporary administration of five major Kyrgyz Banks, including Manas
Bank, for a term of no longer than 6 months. 8 The stated purpose of the
temporary administration was to:

..control the flow of capital and retain assets in the
interests of depositors and other bank creditors and in
consideration of the system's significance and
interrelation, as well as the circumstances of theft and
threat of theft?

 

37 Decree no. 10/1, supran 4.
>® Ibid.
* Tid.

 

 

 

 

69. The Claimant does not dispute that there was an urgent need for
temporary stabilising actions during the disruptions that led to the regime

change.“

70. The Tribunal notes that it is possible that Decree No 10/1 was not
imposed in strict accordance with Kyrgyz law. This may have been because
certain individual NBKR officials were not available to provide formal
approvals. Regardless of any procedural defects that may have existed,
those have no bearing on this arbitration as the Decree was enforced as if it
had full force of law.

71. In accordance with Decree No 10/1 the NBKR appointed one of its
employees, Ms. Alisherova, as Temporary Administrator. The Temporary
Administrator was designated in order to “assume the authority of the Board
of Directors and of the Executive Boards of the Bank.”*!

72. On 9 April 2010 the Kyrgyz Federal Prosecutor’s office seized the
assets of Manas Bank, based as it appears principally upon suspicions of
illegality at an unrelated bank — Asia Universal Bank :

Various suspicious money transfer operations, whose
origin raises doubts of their legality, were concluded on an
especially large scale during the period from 2006 to 2010
through Asia Universal Bank, Issyk- Kul. Invest, Manas,
KyrgyzCredit and Akylinvest banks.

Thus, an inspection of only one client upon the incoming
and outgoing transfers for several months of LLC
Investment Company Tabylga in 2009 showed that its
turnover on credit accounts are the following: 3 972
million dollars and 580 million euros, and this turnover
exceeds the real gross domestic product of Kyrgyz
Republic.

Basically, the monetary funds come from the companies,
which are registered in offshore zones, the received sums
of money are converted into another currency and are
transferred inside the bank to the accounts of other
companies ~ the clients of Asia Universal Bank in divided

amounts as for the Agency Agreement and etc., and then

 

“ Claimant’s Post-Hearing Brief, 24 February 2013, § 131.
“1 Decree no, 10/1, supran 4.

are transferred back to the accounts of the same companies
— non-resident offshore companies. (Emphasis added.)

73. Nothing in the record indicates that Manas Bank had the Tabylga
entity as a client. Indeed East Star Capital's identification of Manas Bank’s
top 20 clients does not list Tabylga.”? At any rate, as part of its general
investigation of the above mentioned Asia Universal Bank the Prosecutor’s
Office ordered that the “the property of the bank Manas, whatever it is
expressed, including realty, cars, funds and other property” be seized.*

74, On 17 April 2010, as part of the ongoing investigation, the State
Prosecutor took the further measure of seizing the shares of a number of
Banks, including Manas Bank:

In order to open a civil case and ensure the compensation
of damages, as well as the execution of the sentence as
related to the confiscation of property, it is necessary to
seize all of the shares of the following banks: OAO Asia
Universal Bank, OAO Investment Bank Yssyk-Kul, ZAO
Manas Bank, OAO Kyrgyz Credit Bank, OAO Investment
Joint-stock Commercial Bank Akyl, OAO Dos Credo Bank,
and OAO Bank Bakai. (Emphasis added.)**

 

78. While the criminal investigations of various banks began, the
National Bank took steps to gain control over the administration of Manas
Bank in accordance with Decree 10/1.

76. On 13 April 2010, the Temporary Administrator dismissed the
management and board of Manas Bank.** The next day, the Claimant and
the management of Manas Bank wrote to the National Bank objecting to the

imposition of the temporary administration regime and the dismissal of
Manas Bank’s managers.”

77. On 21 April 2010, the Kyrgyz State Financial Intelligence Service
ordered the seizure of the building in which Manas Bank was operating.

78. In response to objections from Manas Bank over the imposition of
temporary administration, on 28 April 2010 the National Bank justified its
decision as follows:

It is widely known that in Bishkek on the night from 7 April
to 8 April ATM machines and payment and trading
terminals of several bank, including Manas Bank CJSC,
were damaged, destroyed and robbed, and one ATM was
destroyed and looted. In addition, on 8 April the
management of Manas Bank CJSC contacted the National
Bank with a request to provide assistance and protection
and to provide security against an armed penetration into
bank buildings and against the threat of a forced, armed
bank robbery. Thus, Manas Bank CJSC was facing a true
threat against the safety of its assets.

Based on the above, we believe that in order to protect
state assets and protect the interests of depositors, the
introduction of temporary administration and Manas Bank
CJSC was a necessary measure. (Emphasis added.)”

The Tribunal notes the lack of evident connection between
the physical threats and the decision to appoint a
temporary administrator, as opposed to other possible
actions, such as sending police officers or guards. At any
rate, the Temporary Administrator set about managing the
affairs of Manas Bank. 1

b. Temporary Administration of Manas Bank

79. According to Kyrgyz regulations on the temporary administration of
banks, the mandate of temporary administration is the provision of “proper
operation of the bank’s management in order to safeguard the assets and the
financial health of the bank in the interests of depositors and other creditors
of the ae 2950 _ Those regulations also state that “the purpose of the

- is to imp the for the
conservation / restoration of bank management, improvement of its financial
position and the elimination of violations of legislation and the NBRK’
requirements.”*! From this, the Tribunal understands that it is the role of a
temporary administrator to further the interests of the bank and bring it back
into compliance by addressing the deficiencies which triggered the decision
of the National Bank to impose temporary administration in the first place.”

80. While the objective of temporary administration of a bank is to
“4mprove its financial position” and act in the interests of the bank and its
clients, what happened during the administration of Ms. Alisherova does not
appear compliant with these objectives.

81. Prior to the imposition of temporary administration, Manas Bank
had set strategic expansion goals which included the establishment of
further branches within the Kyrgyz Republic. Under the temporary
administration, Manas Bank’s expansion plans were not continued.

82. Under temporary administration, following the directive of Decree
10/1 of 8 April 2010, the financial activities of Manas Bank were severely
curtailed. The NBKR forbade foreign currency conversions and restricted
clients from transferring their funds to foreign banks. The Tribunal has no
evidence of Ms. Alisherova lobbying the NBKR in the interests of the
clients of Manas Bank to allow them to remove their foreign funds, or to the
contrary explaining why she did not feel it appropriate to support their
freedom to repatriate their funds.

z

2008; CL-7, R.11.13, art 1.2, Bundle F.35 (Emphasis added).

$1 Ibid, art 1.3 (emphasis added).

* This understanding appears consistent with the Respondent's Expert witness on Kyrgyz
Banking law, Expert Report of Maksat Ishenbaev, 27 November 2013, 4] 4-5. This is
also the opinion of the Claimant’s expert, Expert Report of Ulan Tilenbaev, 15 October
2013, section 3.4 [“This means that the main objective/duty of the temporary manager
in relation to the bank is to implement measures to preserve/restore the system for
managing the bank, to effect a recovery of the bank’s financial position and to
eliminate violations of the legislation and normative acts of the National Bank.”}.

83. One of the most consequential and significant decisions taken by
Ms. Alisherova involved two of Manas Bank’s largest depositors; The
Kyrgyz Republic Social Fund and the Kyrgyz Development Fund. These
were indirectly owned state funds of the Kyrgyz Republic. According to the
Chairman of the Board of Manas Bank, Mr. Verbickis, as of 1 April 2010
the Social Fund had on deposit 320 million soms (7.1 million USD) and the
Development Fund 362 million soms (8 million USD).** These represented
a considerable portion of the nearly 1.5 billion soms on deposit in Manas
ank.

84. On 19 April 2010, the Kyrgyz Social Fund met with Ms. Alisherova
to negotiate an extension of its deposit agreement. According to the Deputy
Chairman of the Fund, Ms. Alisherova refused to sign an extension of its
deposit agreements. The Social Fund thereupon cancelled its agreements
and transferred its accounts to another Kyrgyz Bank.*®

é
&

85. The new Provisional Government of the Kyrgyz Republic decided to
liquidate the Development Fund, by a decree of 30 April 2010.°° Although a
one year term deposit agreement had been signed between Manas Bank and
the Development Fund on 26 March 2010, Ms. Alisherova proposed that the
agreement be terminated.*”

86. In effect, during the temporary administration Manas Bank’s
financial position was severely weakened. In her witness statement, Ms.
Alisherova asserts that she made significant efforts to return the deposits of
the Social Fund and the Development Fund “without violating the norms of
liquidity.”** The least one can say, based on the record, was that she was not
successful in maintaining the solvency of Manas Bank. Nor is it clear why
she apparently gave little thought to the advantages of retaining these
deposits.

i. PENSIONAT VITYAZ

87. The Parties devoted considerable attention to Manas Bank’s
involvement in a commercial construction project with a borrower called
Pensionat Vityaz, The details of this involvement are set forth below.

88. In a letter of 15 June 2010, Ms. Alisherova informed the Claimant
that Manas Bank was in violation of “Norm K 1.1” relating to the maximum
tisks allowed in relation to a borrower, Pensionat Vityaz, and two entities
allegedly connected with it. This was not the first time that Ms. Alisherova
had the opportunity to consider the risks associated with this client. As
acting Banking Supervision Department Chief in 2009, Ms. Alisherova had
previously signed off on an inspection report of Manas Bank after the
banking relationship with Pensionat Vityaz had been flagged as worthy of
close attention.

89. During cross-examination, Ms. Alisherova testified that at the time
before she became involved in the inspection of Manas Bank she had signed
off on the inspection report and had no concerns regarding its content.*!

90. The 2009 inspection report highlighted, as one of the key
conclusions, that these three entities were connected to a construction
project in ways that exposed Manas Bank to certain risks should the project
fail. Still, the report did not identify the Pensionat Vityaz loan as being in
violation of norm “K 1.1” or otherwise. Instead, the report recommended
the “diversification of [Manas Bank’s] credit portfolio by sectors of
economy and to regularly monitor the financial status of [its] borrowers.”

91. On 20 May 2010, the Provisional Government of the Kyrgyz
Republic nationalised the construction project being undertaken by
Pensionat Vityaz.® The Respondent has submitted that they are still
attempting to “resolve the problems associated with this nationalised
property.” Be that as it may, and despite assertions by Ms. Alisherova that

she took steps towards seeking compensation for Manas Bank,® the
nationalisation had a significant effect; the asset underpinning very
significant loans had been expropriated without compensation.

92, In a letter of 4 September 2012 from the Vice-Chairman of the
National Bank, Mr. Chokoev, to the Vice Prime Minister of the Kyrgyz
Republic, the former stated that one of two “main reasons for the
unprofitability” of Manas Bank was the nationalisation of Pensionat
Vityaz.® The letter goes on to note that this issue had been raised on at least
four prior occasions.

93. Beyond writing letters, Manas Bank appears not to have sought
recourse within the judicial system of the Kyrgyz Republic to seek just
compensation for the loss of its collateral. To the contrary, following the
nationalisation, Manas Bank reclassified the loans to Pensionat Vityaz and
the other companies involved in the construction of the Vityaz project as
“doubtful assets” unlikely to be recovered, resulting in Manas Bank also
being in violation of Kyrgyz banking Norm K 4.1.7

94, As mentioned, in an action that would have great further
significance, on 15 June 2010, Ms. Alisherova decided that loans to
Pensionat Vityaz and other companies involved in the Vityaz construction
project should never have been granted as they represented too high of a risk
to Manas Bank that they would lead to violation of Kyrgyz banking norms.
Ms. Alisherova concludes in her letter that having granted these loans,
Manas Bank had engaged in “unsound and unsafe banking practices.”

95. On account of these “unsafe and unsound” practices, the temporary
administrator and the NBKR found that the management and board of
Manas Bank included persons unsuitable to administer Manas Bank and
should be replaced. In effect, the conclusions of June 2010 served as
justification of the prior decision of May 2010 to dismiss Manas Bank’s top
officials.

96. As will be explained further, this resulted in the continuation of the
Temporary Administration Regime imposed on Manas Bank.

c Attempted Challenge to Temporary
Administration Regime

97. The Claimant does not dispute the right of the Respondent to take
emergency temporary measures to secure its banking sector over a few days
of unrest in April 2010 during which the Bakiev regime was deposed.

98. | When that temporary administration was not terminated following
the installation of the provisional government, the Board of Manas Bank
sought to challenge the decision to impose temporary administration. On 14
April 2010, the Claimant, and the evicted Manas Bank management, wrote
to the NBKR contesting the legal basis for the imposition of temporary
management and affirming that Decree No 10/1 was harming the business
of Manas Bank.

99. Lawyers from the NBRK provided an opinion dated 27 April 2010
to the effect that NBKR Decree No 10/1 was valid. They noted the
physical violence perpetrated against the banking sector on April 7-8 2010.
They also noted the importance of preserving the state assets on deposit at
Manas Bank and the opinion of the State Prosecutor’s office that from 2006-
2010 there had been suspicious transactions in the Kyrgyz banking sector.
The legal opinion was affirmed by the management of the NBKR in a
decision of 28 April 2010.”

100. The unseated Manas Bank managers sought clarification and
justifications from the temporary administrator through a series of letters
beginning in April 2010. On 18 June 2010, the former Manas Bank
managers turned to the Kyrgyz courts to challenge the temporary
administration that had been imposed on it.”!

101. Unfortunately for Manas Bank, it appears that Kyrgyz law restricted
standing to challenge measures affecting Manas Bank in court:

the Kyrgyz Republic No. 10/1 dated 8 April 2010, 14 April 2010; C-282 Bundle E.106.

Bank's written objections pursuant to the pre-trial dispute resolution procedure, 27

“Application by CJSC Manas Bank to appeal against Resolutions of the Board of the

3.1 At the appointment of the temporary administration,
only temporary administration shall be entitled to act on
behalf of the bank as a legal entity.”

102. On 9 August 2010, the Inter-District Court of Bishkek found that
the deposed Board and management of Manas Bank were unable to
challenge the imposition of temporary administration as only the Temporary
Administrator, or her delegate, could challenge the decision of the NBKR.”

103. On 9 September 2010, the Appellate Division of the Court affirmed
this decision.

104. Finally, on 21 February 2011, the Supreme Court of the Kyrgyz
Republic affirmed both lower court decisions:

However, in accordance with Article 3.1 of the Resolution
of the NBRK dated 30.09.208 No 36/5 only temporary
administrators of the Bank are authorised to represent it as
a legal entity in case temporary administration regime is
imposed,”

105. In sum, as interpreted by the highest court, Kyrgyz law does not
permit the challenge of Decree No 10/1 imposing the temporary
administration regime by the deposed board and managers of Manas Bank.

106. While the Respondent, in its post-hearing brief, has suggested that
perhaps the Claimant himself could have had standing to pursue a remedy,
they note this would require a demonstration that his rights as shareholder
had been infringed. The fact is however that the State Prosecutor had
ordered the seizure of the Claimant’s shares on 17 April 2010. On 1
September 2010, the Temporary Administrator notified the Claimant that
she had petitioned for the removal of the attachment that had been placed on
the shares of Manas Bank.”© On 20 January 2011, a decision from the
Kyrgyz Attorney General’s office was issued that partially removed the

sequestration of the shares of the Claimant to allow for “capitalization of
Manas Bank” but continued to prohibit the “disposal of the mentioned
shares (sale, pledge or any other type of alienation).””’ The Tribunal notes
that it is unknown how the Kyrgyz Courts would have reacted to a suit by
the Claimant in these circumstances. In any event, the Claimant was not
required to exhaust all possible remedies as a pre-condition to pursuing his
claim in arbitration.

da. Extension of Temporary Administration

107. According to Kyrgyz banking law, temporary administration can “be
introduced in the bank for a term of up to six months.”” This is consistent
with the stated purpose of temporary administration: the improvement of a
bank’s situation.” Under this six month time limitation, the temporary
administration instituted on 8 April 2010 could last until 8 October 2010.

108. Nearing the end of this six month period of temporary
administration, the NBKR did not cease their administration of Manas Bank
but instead took measures to prolong it. The stated reasons for imposing
temporary management this second time were that Mr. Belokon had failed
to replace his management team as requested on 30 September 2010,

109. On Thursday, 30 September 2010, the NBKR issued decree No 76/2
which instructed Mr. Belokon to replace the members of the Board and
senior management of Manas Bank within ten days.®° It appears that this
decree was faxed to Manas Bank, for forwarding to Mr. Belokon, on 4
October 2011.5!

110. Even before this ten day deadline had elapsed, on Monday 4 October
2010 the National Bank prepared two resolutions to ensure that Manas Bank
was kept under temporary administration. Resolution No 77/2 would put an
end to the temporary administration as of eight a.m. on October 8 while
Resolution No 77/6 imposed temporary administration anew as of that same

date and time.” The Tribunal notes that it may well have been impossible
for the Claimant to comply with the NBKR’s instructions within the short
time frame provided and that the NBKR clearly prepared for this failure in
advance.

111. This second temporary administration regime would however not
last long. It was replaced in January 2011 by a “‘sequestration” regime.

Git) ~The Sequestration Regime

112. In “connection with the institution of criminal proceedings” against
the management and board of Manas Bank, on 28 January 2011 the National
Bank issued a decree for the temporary closure of Manas Bank.* That
decree ended the temporary administration regime and appointed a
Conservator, Ms. Nazgul Mulkubatova, to supervise a temporary shutdown
of Manas Bank for 18 months, until 31 July 2012. The sequestration regime
was imposed on account of the institution of criminal proceedings against
the management and board of Manas Bank by reference to suspicious
transactions at the bank, and the existence of “unhealthy and unsafe banking
practices.”

113. It is worth recalling that the management and Board of Manas Bank
had been removed by the temporary administrator on 13 April 2010.
Further, the Supreme Court of the Kyrgyz Republic affirmed that these
individuals had no standing to take actions on behalf of the Bank. In
addition, the second temporary administration regime was, apparently,
imposed because the Claimant had refused to appoint a new management
team for Manas Bank, The Tribunal notes the lack of connection between
the stated rationale of the NBKR and the facts on the ground.

114. On 9 February 2011, the Conservator of Manas Bank wrote to the
Claimant and informed him that Kyrgyz law required the submission of a
recommendation to the NBKR within 30 days of a plan for Manas Bank
which would recommend one of three options:

¢ A detailed plan for the rehabilitation of Manas Bank
¢ A detailed plan for the sale of Manas Bank

115. No such plan, dated ex hypothesi prior to 27 February 2011, appears
to have been exhibited in this arbitrati Ms. Mulkubatova has

three witness statements. None of them appears to address whether such a

plan was made, as required by Kyrgyz law, let alone what it may have

recommended,

116. Kyrgyz law allows for a nine month extension of a sequestration
regime. On 25 July 2012, the National Bank issued a second decree
extending the shutdown for a further 9 months, until 30 April 2013."° The
stated grounds for the continued sequestration were that the criminal
proceedings against Manas Bank directors and officers were still pending
and that Manas Bank was in violation of the minimum bank capital
requirements.

117. The sequestration has continued well beyond the nine month
extension permitted under the laws of the Kyrgyz Republic. In July 2013,
the National Bank again appointed a new sequestration administrator for
Manas Bank.®° The Tribunal understands that to this date, Manas Bank is
still under sequestration administration.

118. The Tribunal has received no adequate explanation as to how the
sequestration regime had been so extended a second time, let alone on a
continuing basis, in apparent violation of the Kyrgyz law concerning
sequestration.®” Notably, the Respondent’s Expert on Banking Law in the
Kyrgyz Republic did not address this issue in his Report nor during
examination at the hearing.**

119. The Tribunal directed the parties to elaborate in their post-hearing
briefs on how the sequestration regime has continued to be in effect by
answering the following questions:

Bank were timely available to the Respondent prior to
April 2010? What, if any, is the significance of the time
limits (18 and 9 months respectively) mentioned in Article
9(2) of Law No 14 of 15 February 2004 On Sequestration,
Liquidation and Bankruptcy of Banks (Bundle F2, tab 20)?
Jn particular, did these statutory time limits preclude the
National Bank from re-introducing or imposing a new
sequestration regime on the same bank after the lapse of
the aggregate number, i.e. 27, of months mentioned in the
provision?

120. The Respondent has answered that the continued regime was
justified on account of the “existence of a friendship and close business
interest between Maxim Bakiev and Mr. Belokon.”*° The Respondent also
justifies the sequestration regime on account of “the involvement of Manas
Banks officials in unsafe and unhealthy banking practice.”®! The Tribunal
recalls that these officials were removed in April 2010.

121. The Claimant contends that “the extension of the sequestration over
Manas Bank beyond 27 months has no lawful basis.””

(iv) The Administrative and Criminal Allegations
against Manas Bank

122. The Respondent has justified the ongoing public administration of
Manas Bank on what it alleges are “suspicious” transactions that took place
at Manas Bank. These have been investigated by officials at the NBKR, by
Kyrgyz prosecutors and agencies, and by the Respondent’s experts for this
arbitration.

a. Administrative Proceedings

123. Following a request of the NBKR, administrative proceedings were
commenced against Manas Bank on 23 March 2011 on account of alleged
violations of Kyrgyz banking laws relating to the issuance of credit cards.”
On 25 March 2011, a Conservator of Manas Bank wrote to the State

Financial Intelligence Service to explain that no credit cards were issued by
Manas Bank, but rather by, Baltic International Bank. Manas Bank simply
assisted with applications.” It appears that the NBKR Conservator did not
believe that Manas Bank had violated Kyrgyz banking !aw in this regard.

124. On 7 April 2011, the Chairman of the Kyrgyz Financial
Investigations Service issued a decision dismissing the charges of
wrongdoing against Manas Bank.*

125. The Tribunal understands that the Conservator’s letter of 25 March
2011 was “withdrawn” on 29 December 2011%° because the Respondent
states the Conservator made a “mistake” in sending it.*” No particulars as to
the circumstances and reasons why nine months following the Conservator’s
letter it was deemed to be a mistake have been provided to this Tribunal.
The Tribunal notes that the letter, clearly favourable to the Claimant in this
case, was withdrawn on the same day as the filing of the Statement of
Claim.

b. Criminal Proceedings before the Kyrgyz
Courts

126. As previously noted, in April 2010 the Kyrgyz prosecutors started
criminal investigations into the banking system. On 19 January 2011
Kyrgyz prosecutors issued charges against the Claimant and his associates
at Manas Bank.

127, On 18 April 2011, a Kyrgyz Court reviewed charges brought against
32 persons, including the Claimant, of:

Organisation of a criminal group, corruption, legalisation
of financial means obtained by criminal activities, fraud
used for obtaining securities of the Russian issuers etc, and
other charges according to various articles of the criminal
code of the republic of Kyrgyzstan.

128. The Kyrgyz Court ordered the case to be returned to the prosecutor’s
office on account of serious deficiencies in how it had been handled. The
Court noted, for example, that there was no indication that 23 of the
individuals charged were even aware of the case being brought against
them. The Court also noted what appeared to it to be the complete lack of
organisation in the evidence supporting the criminal accusations.

129. On 10 November 2011, a Kyrgyz Court invalidated decrees of the
NBER against the Chief Accountant of Manas Bank which had found her to
be involved in “unfit and unsafe banking practices”.®? While that decision of
the Kyrgyz Court only has affect as to that particular former Manas Bank
employee, it is of relevance for the similar proceedings against the Claimant
and others. In reviewing the decisions of the NBKR, the Court noted that:

Thus, the issue of violation of laws of the Kyrgyz Republic
on counteraction against financing of terrorism and
legalisation (Money Laundering) of the proceeds acquired
in an illegal way by CJSC Manas Bank has been
considered by the authorised state body — the Financial
Intelligence Service of the Kyrgyz Republic and no reason
has been found for application of any enforcement actions
due to this.’

130. That Court also considered the previous audits of Manas Bank (prior
to the introduction of temporary administration) and found there to be no
reason to doubt their findings or veracity:

Further on, the court demanded provision of Reports of
independent auditors CJSC Top-Audit KG dated 23 March
2010 and 13 March 2009, According to the aforementioned
reports, the financial statements ISC_ Manas Bi as
of 31 De ber 2008 and 31 De ber 2009, are credible
in all significant aspects and are in_conformity with the

ional ial reporting standards. Up to_now.
these reports have not been acknowledged 1

inter
as unk or
invalid by anyone, i.e, the court has no reasons to doubt
their credibility.

The court was also provided the NBKR Reports on the
results of the complex inspection of operation of CJSC
Manas Bank for the years 2008 (the inspection headed by

 

» Judgment of the Interdistrict Court of the City of Bishkek in case AD-463/11mbs2, 10

E. Karabechelova (Kapabexenosa 3.)) and 2009 (the
inspection headed by A. Dolubaev (Jony6aes A.)),
according to which the inspectors did not establish any
violations in the operation of CJSC Manas Bank and E. K.
Kyshtobaeva, which fall under the activities classified as
unfit and unsafe banking practice. As a consequence,
according to the results of the aforementioned inspections,
neither E. K. Kyshtobaeva, nor_other officials of CJSC
Manas Bank were applied any measures or sanctions on
the part of NBKR.

Therefore, the court cannot agree to the NBKR objections
that the Report on checking the CJSC Manas Bank
operation during the period of introduction of temporary
administration in 2010 fully proves the fault of officials of
the bank in committing actions which are determined as
unfit and unsafe banking practice, as, according to the
aforementioned, the defendant has not provided evidences
of the fact that previous Reports on the results of the
complex inspection by NBKR of operation of CJSC Manas
Bank for the years 2008 and 2009 are invalid. Similarly,
the defendant has not provided documents certifying on the
lack of objectivity or lawlessness of the conclusions of the
NBER inspectors who performed the complex inspections
in 2008-2008, as well as evidences of applying measures
and sanctions established by the law with regard to them.

Moreover, in accordance with Clause 5.6 of the NBKR
Instructions “On Performance of Inspections In-Situ”,
assessment of a banks operation performed in the course of
an inspection is final. (Emphasis added.)'*!

While the overturning of an administrative action of the NBKR is of
no direct effect on the parallel criminal prosecution, it could hardly fail to
raise doubts with respect to the case against the Claimant and other

individuals related to Manas Bank.

132,

On 28 December 2011, a Kyrgyz Court once again considered the
criminal allegations against the Claimant and his associates at Manas Bank.
After a review of the case to date, in which the Court noted that for some
charges there was “no evidence in the criminal case in support of these

accusations”, the Court stated:

Summing up the above mentioned facts, it should be noted
that the criminal case has been investigated superficially,

1! ibid, at 12.

 

 

with accusatory bias, while the criminal case should be
investigated fully, objectively and comprehensively, it is
desirable that the case should be investigated for each of
the defined banks separately, since it would facilitate either
criminal investigations or the proceedings.’

133. The Kyrgyz Court again returned the criminal case to the
prosecutor’s office for further investigation.

134. From the evidence presented in this arbitration, it does not appear
that the Kyrgyz Courts have, in the intervening years since December 2011,
rendered a verdict (or resumed a hearing) in the criminal case against the
Claimant and other individuals associated with Manas Bank. .

c. Allegations by Respondent’s Witnesses of
criminal behaviour

135. On 9 April 2010, one day following the institution of temporary
administration, the Bishkek Public Prosecutor issued a decree freezing the
assets of Manas Bank.' According to the Prosecutor, an investigation into
“only one client” of Asia Universal Bank led to a conclusion that there was
a “suspicious money transfer Operations” on account of very significant
currency conversion activity.“ The Prosecutor believed that similar
transactions were perhaps taking place at other Banks in the Kyrgyz
Republic, and therefore seized the assets of Manas Bank.!° No evidence or
accusations relating to the activities of Manas Bank appear to have been
mentioned in the decree of the Prosecutor.'®

136. The Respondent’s witnesses have provided repeated commentary on
the allegedly illegal activities of Manas Bank. However, their assertions
have not referred to evidence or coherent inferences concerning the alleged
wrongful conduct, nor have particulars of such conduct been provided. Nor
do the Respondent’s subsequent submissions appear to have rectified or
provided an adequate explanation for this evidentiary lacuna.

137. Thus, a Deputy Chairman of the National Bank, Mr. Suerkul
Abdybaly Tegin, in his witness statement of 25 September 2012, stated that:

This witness statement of Deputy Chairman Abdybaly does not
contain any references to exhibits or further elaboration on the nature of the
impugned conduct. Notably, the “results of the examination” have not been

accounted for in this arbitration.

139.

As for the second witness statement of Deputy Chairman Zair

Chokoey, it noted:

140,

8. The reasons, that caused the financial difficulties of the
bank and subsequent appropriate action by the supervisory
authorities, are the actions of the bank's former
management ~ Management Board and the Board of
Directors which allowed the acceptance by the bank

unreasonably high credit risk gnd. other serious violations
of the law, (Emphasis added. %

Similarly, however, this second witness statement of Deputy
Chairman Chokoev does not contain any references to exhibits or further

elaboration of the “other serious violations of the law”.

141,

Another Deputy Chairman of the National Bank, Ms. Baktygul

Djeenbaeva, in her witness statement of 25 September 2012 stated that:

12, As the results of checks, numerous violations of
economic standards observance, banking legislation and
normative-legal acts of the National Bank were

by the [Manas] Bank, a lot of questionable conduct and
suspicious transactions took place in the bank, bank
officials committed significant violations up to a conceal

upon the record of guarantee bonds.

13. Accordingly, the question of the involvement of
government officials in the conduct of unsafe and
unhealthy banking practice was rendered to the Oversight
Committee. The Committee approved the proposal for the
oversight involvement. Because officials of Manas Bank
appeal, the matter was considered by the Board of
National Bank. NBKR’s Board carefully enough studied
the documents provided by the banking supervision Office.
I, like other members of the Board, voted in favour of the
proposal for the involvement since provided materials
convincingly demonstrated numerous violations, and
conduct of shady and ich (Emphasi

142. The first witness statement of Ms, Djeenbaeva does not contain any
references to exhibits or further elaboration on the nature of the impugned
conduct. Notably, the “documents provided by the banking supervision
Office” do not appear to have been exhibited.

143. Inher second witness statement, Ms. Djeenbaeva adds:

6. The officers of banking supervision have provided me
with the information on non-resident companies, serviced
in Manas Bank, as well as on non-resident companies
drawn through Baltic International Bank. Also I
Jamiliarised myself with the information on founders,
owners, directors, managers and information on conducted
transaction. The majority of the information seemed
suspicious to me, and in my opinion, the employees in
charge of Combating the terrorism financing/Money
laundering, did not perform their job duties in dull and did
not carry out the audit properly. (Emphasis added.)'"°

144. Once again, this second witness statement of Ms. Djeenbaeva dves
not contain any references to exhibits or further elaboration on the nature of
the impugned conduct.

“145. — The first Sequestration Administrator, Ms. Nazgul Mulkubatova,

made the following observations in her first witness statement:

27. I paid attention to the fact that when issuing a bank
guarantee, the decision of the Credit Committee was

missing (violation of Article 35.2 of the Law “On bank and
banking activity”), internal procedures on the issue and

of guarantee had not been lied with,
unreliable financial statements had been provided since
2008, and, accordingly, from 2008 to 2010 Manas Bank
showed no guarantee in reports to the national Bank, i.e.

deliberately concealed it,

62. In pursuit of profit and attraction of new Manas Bank,
in the absence of the development of appropriate
maintenance procedures of VIP-customers, former
management of Manas Bank, in violation of the Law on
Banks and the Law “Qn Combating against Financing of
Terrorism/Me laundering”, held the service of so-
called VIP-customers and_ their identification in Mr.
Verbitsky’s [the Chairperson’s] office, contracts for their

services were signed here.

63. ... Mr Verbitsky personally engaged in identification of
la VIP ]_and_some_ non-resident

Although as a Chairman of Manas Bank, he did not have
such authority to do so. Special authorized person,
compliance-officer had to deal with the identification,
verification of Mans Bank customers, and their compliance
with requirements of the Kyrgyz Law “On Combating
against Financing of Terrorism/Money Laundering”.

65. In the first instance of the court, NBKR proved
infringements with respect of suspicious transactions upon
MasterCard Payment system by Mans Bank. The fact to
attract customers who are citizens of Latvia to the service
through the Kyrgyz Mans Bank looks very strange in terms
of economic efficiency.

66. Violations revealed in Manas Bank and attributed to
Mr. Sheytelman by the National Bank were confirmed by
the Court’s decision and were fully proved by the NBKR.
These violations are reflected in the Report of the National
Bank in 2010 upon the verifications by Manas Bank.
(Emphasis added.)'"?

146. The witness statement of the Sequestretion Administrator does not
contain any references to exhibits or further elaboration on the nature of the
impugned conduct. The Tribunal notes that where VIP clients were known
to the Chairman of Manas Bank, services may have been provided without
following the protocols for identification of such personally known clients

 

"Ms. Nazgul Mulkubatova, First Witness Statement, 25 September 2012; Bundle C.9.

 

REY

 

in apparent technical violation of the rules in the Kyrgyz Republic on
money laundering and financing of terrorism, Such technical breaches are
similar to those identified in a January 2010 Inspection Report of Manas
Bank where it was noted that some client identification data was not
updated annually as required." In that Report, the recommendation was
further to assess the scope of the problem, and Manas Bank agreed to
introduce better auditing of internal controls for combating the financing of
terrorism and money laundering in 2010.

147, The first Sequestration Administrator, Ms. Nazgul Mulkubatova,
made the following observations in her second witness statement:

25, The national Bank... have an irrefutable evidence of
the activity of Manas Bank and its officers in violation of
the Kyrgyz law and in violation of the principle of the
implementation of healthy and unsafe banking practices by
Manas Bank and its officers.

37. In conclusion, I would like to note that the very nature
of the relationships and conducting transactions of Mans
Bank and [a VIP] (and others, as well holding Manas Bank

erations with customers on the work with the
international payment cards of Mastercard International
through JSC “Baltic International Bank”) are_ suspicious
and do not make any economic sense. (Emphasis added.)'

148. This statement does not exhibit the “irrefutable evidence” of
activities in violation of Kyrgyz law. It is unclear how a foreign banking
customer wanting to obtain a MasterCard, or otherwise deposit funds in a
Kyrgyz Bank, is in violation of Kyrgyz law or how his or her application
does “not make any economic sense.” Further, the Tribunal recalls that the
Kyrgyz authorities investigated the MasterCard issue. Indeed, as mentioned,
prior to the determination that it had been in error, the conservator was of
the opinion that there was nothing improper with the issuing of the credit
cards. Mr, Verbickis notes in his second witness statement that foreign
customers were attracted to the high interest rates offered by Manas Bank
on foreign deposits.!"* At any rate, it has not been shown that registering
non-Kyrgyz clients or processing credit card applications breaches criminal
law.

' Mr, Jevgenijs Verbickis, Second Witness Statement, 15 October 2012, Bundle B.11.

149. Ms. Mulkubatova made the following observations in her third
witness statement:

43. A letter to the General Prosecutor's Office of the
Kyrgyz Republic No 9/07-10 of 20.01.2011, in which it was
stated that according to the results of criminal
investigation No 150-10-94 the officials and shareholder of
“Manas Bank” CJSC were criminally liable
committing. crimes related to pal cia (laundering) of

btained funds, corruption and for participating
in_a criminal organization served as a prerequisite for
imposition of the sequestration regime in “Manas Bank”
CISC.

52. Furthermore, the violations set forth in the NBKR’s
Report have been confirmed by the sequestrator’s Report
on the results of the activity of “Mans Bank” OJSC in the
field of the sequestrator on the results of audit of Manas
Bank’s activity in the field of combating the financing of
terrorism / money laundering on 01.07.2011 (on the bank
transactions conducted in 2008, 2009), which
independently confirms the NBKR’s findings on inefficient
identification and verification of Manas Bank's clients. In
particular, the Sequestrator’s Report (page 5) states that
“These facts suggest that identification of clients was
carried out (on clients who opened accounts in Manas
Bank in 2008, 2009, our clarification) improperly, as well
as that on the side of the Compliance Control Department
— Heads of Department on work with corporate non-
resident clients — lax controls over identification of the
bank’s clients and end beneficiaries on their operations.”
(Emphasis added.)'"

150. This third witness statement exhibited 17 documents, but not the
above referenced letter of 20 January 2011 authored by the prosecutor and
explaining the purported criminal activities of the Claimant and Manas
Bank. Nor does one find the sequestrator’s report concluding that there was
wrongdoing. The included exhibits do not elaborate on the facts pertaining
to the alleged money laundering or financing of terrorism.!

151. While it may well be that the Respondent’s witnesses, as well as
perhaps other citizens in the Kyrgyz Republic, believe that Manas Bank or
the Claimant were involved in criminal activities, the Tribunal has not been
presented with evidence that substantiates, supports, or corroborates such
beliefs.

d. Allegations of Criminal Behaviour Made by
Respondent’s Experts

152. On 26 November 2013, i.e. a few days before the Witness Hearing in
Paris, the Respondent submitted a second expert report to the Tribunal,
prepared by Mr. Andrew Howson and Mr, Paul Devine of East Star Capital
(this Award refers to the Respondent’s experts collectively as ESC). This
Report was prepared in the course of two and a half weeks. ESC’s primary
conclusion was that further investigation would be warranted with respect to
the activities of Manas Bank:

During the course of the investigation East Star Capital
has, in its opinion, found a number of trading and
operational complexities that it believes warrant further
investigation and or deliberation by international and
Kyrgyz professional and judicial bodies. We clearly state
that we are not qualified to offer an opinion on what those
outcomes might be from any investigation, that that the
facts point to a need to engage further qualified bodies
going forward who can determine those matters. We do
offer the opinion that evidence provided in this document
does, from our understanding of the relevant international
standards on money laundering and fraudulent behavior,
raise a number of red flags that on the surface provide

significant reason to believe that there were transactions

 

Certain officers of ZAO Manas Bank were responsible for
violations of articles 24, 25, 27, 35, 27, 39.1, 53, 58.3 and
60 of the Kyrgyz Republic Law "On Banks and Banking
Activities"; articles 3.1 and 4.1 of the Kyrgyz Republic Law
"On Combating the Financing of Terrorism and Money
Laundering"; paragraphs 5.5, 5.6 and 5.7 of the
Regulation on Minimum Requirements for Organizing
Internal Controls at Commercial! Banks and other
Financial/Credit Institutions Licensed by the NBKR. to
Combat Financing of Terrorism and Money Laundering.

and organizations that would be of interest to international
judicial authorities. (Emphasis added.)'"7

153. As stated by the Financial Action Task Force (FAFT), which is an
intergovernmental organization comprising, inter alia, the major economies
in the world dedicated to combatting economic crimes, including corruption
and money laundering:

“Money laundering ts the processing of these criminal
proceeds to disguise their illegal origin. This process is of
critical importance, as it enables the criminal to enjoy
these profits without jeopardizing their source”™'*

154. There are three acknowledged sequential phases to money
laundering, namely (i) placement, (ii) layering, and (iii) integration.'"® The
placement phase covers the time from the cash generated by crime is placed
in the financial system. The layering phase is meant to obscure their origins
by passing the money through - often complex — transactions. Finally, the
integration part entails the obscured criminal funds to “resurface” as
legitimate funds or assets.'”°

155. In practice, a plethora of ways is available to a culprit when
considering how to Jaunder the criminal proceeds. Financial institutions
play, willingly or inadvertently, an integral part of most money laundering
schemes.

156. This Tribunal is cognizant of the currency transaction patterns and
significant amounts seemingly involved in these transactions mentioned in
the second experts’ reports by East Star Capital. In this context, the Tribunal
is further mindful of the definitions and characteristics of a typical money
laundering scheme,

157. Moreover, the Tribunal acknowledges that some of these
transactions, could, on their face, warrant further investigations into whether
activities adequately labelled as money laundering may have been carried
out by or through Manas Bank.

158. If probative and substantial evidence of Manas Bank having being
actively involved in money laundering had been produced and presented to
the Tribunal, the claim under the BIT may have been defeated, It scarcely
needs to be said that investment protection is not intended to benefit
criminals or investments based on or pursued by criminal activities.

159. Money laundering is a serious problem. Any adjudicator
encountering allegations of money laundering must examine the evidence
with punctiliousness. Still, the seriousness of the alleged offence does not
entail that fundamental principles of due process or burden of proof can, or
should, be relaxed when dealing with such claims.

160. In its post-hearing brief, the Respondent suggested that suspicions
are enough:

This is an important distinction that must be made, in the
cases of money laundering: the bank must act, not on proof
of illegality, but on suspicion. This duty to act and report
suspicion is usually legal obligation and failure to report
can be a criminal offence in itself.”

161. True enough, suspicion of money laundering alone may be enough
to justify interlocutory measures by a host state in order to provide time for
a thorough investigation of the allegedly suspicious activities. Nevertheless,
it ultimately remains for the host state to prove that money laundering was
actually carried out by the institution in question, in casu Manas Bank, and
that the measures taken were in accordance with its international
obligations.

162. It may of course be the case that state authorities are in a much better
position that an international body to investigate allegedly criminal
activities, including money laundering, by a subject of that state. But if state
authorities, having thus been in a position to deploy their considerable
powers into investigating criminal activities, come up empty handed to the
extent that the local courts more than once have squashed the evidence and
remanded the case for a further and more careful investigation, it is difficult
to see how an international tribunal, in the absence of concrete evidence,
could reach a different conclusion.

163. In the eyes of this Tribunal the position must necessarily be this: If
the host state, notwithstanding its resources and powers, is unable to
discharge the burden of proof before a municipal court, an international

 

'2t Respondent’s Post-Hearing Brief, at 38.

tribunal will find itself in a situation where it cannot, in the absence of
concrete and decisive evidence, consider identical allegations as proven by
the host state. Anything else would fly in the face of any notion of due
process.

164. In this light, the ESC Report is of quite limited value to the Tribunal.
The question that requires answering is whether in April 2010 the Kyrgyz
authorities had reasonable and legitimate reasons to take control of Manas
Bank and had justifiable reasons for later actions such as dismissing the
Board of Directors and launching an international police search for Mr.
Belokon and his colleagues at Manas Bank. That some nearly four years
later ESC, in the person of two Western consultants having spent a few
weeks to prepare a report, concludes that a closer look at certain transactions
is warranted does little to justify the prior actions by Kyrgyz prosecutors
and the Kyrgyz National Bank.

165. The Report itself does not purport to contain evidence but merely
alludes to facts that are said to merit further investigation. The Tribunal
reiterates that the Respondent’s application to stay or suspend the
proceedings was said to have been justified by reference, inter alia, to
money laundering. The Tribunal declined to grant the application with the
explicit proviso that the Respondent is free to submit a similar request at a
later stage if there is concrete indications that the criminal proceedings are
likely to provide imminent, specific, and relevant evidence.” No further
application in this regard was submitted by the Respondent. Furthermore,
with the consent of both Parties, the evidentiary records were closed after
the witness hearings in December 2013. No application for a reopening of
the evidence phase has been lodged by either party. This arbitration,
consequently, has reached finis litium and the Tribunal must give its award
based on the evidence before it.

166. The Tribunal moreover notes that a possible explanation for flagged
and allegedly suspicious currency transactions, including the amounts
seemingly involved, was provided by Mr. Verbickis. His explanation was in
principle open for possible rebuttal by the Respondent but none was
attempted.

167. It should be recalled that the Kyrgyz prosecutors have had access to
the records at Manas Bank from April 2010, but have failed successfully to
mount a criminal case in the Kyrgyz Republic. Nor was documentary
evidence of wrongdoing presented at the December 2013 hearing.

168. Without relevant and material evidence, the Tribunal is in no better
position than the Respondent’s experts, or the prosecutors in the Kyrgyz

 

 

 

Republic, to determine if there were money laundering transactions or other
criminal wrongdoings committed by the Claimant or Manas Bank. The lack
of evidence presented, combined with the repeated negative findings by
courts and tribunals in the Kyrgyz Republic, if anything suggests the
contrary.

169. The question then arises whether the second report from East Star
Capital, without further substantiation, is enough for Tribunal to support the
Respondent’s contention that violations of the legal order of the Kyrgyz
Republic has been established to an extent where investment protection
must, or should, be denied the Claimant.

170. The answer to this question is, and must be, negative. From the
evidence presented to it, the Tribunal is unable to deduce or infer that the
Respondent state has proved that Manas Bank was involved in money
laundering activities, Consequently, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant is
entitled to avail himself of the remedies of the BIT.

171. The ESC Report purported to serve a second function: to cast doubt
on the value of Manas Bank by suggesting that its profits were derived from
illegal deposits and activities committed by a variety of clients.

172. ESC pointed to various New Zealand companies who are alleged to
be shipping “arms to North Korea and launder[ing] drug money”, to a
South African company that engages in significant currency conversions
through Manas Bank, to a Ukrainian company that “has been accused of
being a shell company used in money laundering and fraud involving the
sale of an oil rig to the Ukrainian government”, to a connection to a
London branch of Wachovia and “Mexican drug cartels,”!* to
investigations by Moldova against a Latvian company.'?°

173. In addition, the ESC Report, using Google Street View, provided
pictures of various buildings and houses which Manas Bank clients may
have as listed offices with corporate registrars." The ESC Report noted
that some of these buildings are the corporate address for numerous
corporations.

174. ESC also asserted that the auditors appointed for Manas Bank were
allegedly “close to the Bakiev family” and that this “raises the question of
involvement in money laundering by the auditors.”!?”

175. The arbitrators infer from the second ESC Report that its authors
suggest that the Tribunal should conclude on such anecdotal “evidence” that
Manas Bank was at the center of a global conspiracy involving everything
from arms sales to North Korea to oil extraction to Mexican drug cartels and
involved hundreds of shell companies registered from New Zealand to
South Africa and was assisted by corrupt auditors. At the same time, the
authors of the ESC Report acknowledged that they are not “specialists in
banking and/or anti-money laundering activities’!”* and “don't claim to be
experts in certain parts of how transactions are conducted inside banks.”!”°

176. During the cross-examination of the authors of the East Star Capital
Report, a number of deficiencies in their work were identified. The authors
acknowledged that a number of calculation mistakes were made.'*° The
authors also noted that it is not the role of their report to say whether
transactions of Manas Bank were or were not evidence of money
laundering."*! The authors also agreed that it was an “error” on their part to
conclude that there had been money laundering in Mr. Belokon’s banks in
Kyrgyz or Latvia.'"* They conceded furthermore that there were errors in
reversing debits and credits in their report on banking operations and errors
in labeling transactions properly.'*3

177. In the period of less than two weeks between the submission of the
Second ESC Report on 26 November 2013 and the December 2013 hearing,
the Claimant endeavoured to respond to these accusations. With regard to a
South African client of Manas Bank which the second Report suggested was
engaged in money laundering, the cross-examination demonstrated that
transactions were so labeled because “one of the red flags of the US Federal
Financial Institutions Examining Council is funds transfer sent and received

from the same person in a different account” and therefore currency trading
in significant volumes may be evidence of money laundering.

178. During examination, ESC admitted that they did not look at the
documents underlying these currency transactions effected in Manas Bank,
nor had they sought to ask anyone at Manas Bank about these transactions
or to secure any assistance from the Manas Bank government appointed
administrators, nor indeed from the National Bank of the Kyrgyz
Republic.'> In effect, the ESC representatives identified transactions they
thought were suspicious but apparently failed to follow up by asking for
supporting documentation, such as contracts justifying client transactions —
unless they did so ask, but were refused evidence presumably under the
control of their own client. They seem content to elude doubts as to their
methods by stating they would be “happy if other authorities who have
greater expertise in [money laundering] than us would make that very
investigation and a substantial investigation.” This, however, has the
effect of confirming the fragility of their conclusions, which remain little
more than suppositions.

THE CLAIMS

179. The Claimant's final formulation of its request for relief is for:

a. A declaration that the Respondent has breached the BIT.

b. A monetary award to compensate the Claimant for harm

a. Dismiss the reliefs sought by the Claimant under points
3), Y and 2) of the Statement of Claim as being
inadmissible.”

b. Dismiss all reliefs sought by the Claimant in the
Statement of Claim as being not founded.

ce. Condemn the Claimant to the payment of the expenses
associated with this claim and arbitration in the amount of
750 000 USD as well as all arbitration costs.

JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY

182. Pursuant to Article 9(2)d) of the BIT, the Claimant availed himself
of the opportunity to submit the dispute to:

An ad hoc arbitral tribunal constituted under the
Arbitration rules of [UNCITRAL], unless otherwise
specified by the parties to the dispute.

183. The Claimant used this option to initiate these proceedings.

184. The Parties subsequently confirmed that the 1976 version of the
UNCITRAL Anrbitration rules apply to this case.

185. The BIT does not identify a seat of arbitration. Article 16(1) of the
UNCITRAL Rules provides that unless the parties have agreed where the
arbitration is to be held, “such place shall be determined by the Arbitral
Tribunal”. After consulting!** with the Parties, the Tribunal selected Paris as
the seat of arbitration.

186. The Respondent has not challenged the Tribunal’s jurisdiction in
general, but has argued that three elements of the relief sought by the

 

137 These are (3) an order that the Respondent terminate all outstanding criminal and civil
ini: ive i igati an i and not ture it igati
in relations to prior events, (4) an order that the Respondent shall inform Interpol that
ali Red Notices against persons affiliated with Manas Bank be withdrawn, (5) an order
that the Respondent shall publish a statement in the leading newspapers of the Kyrgyz
Republic to rehabilitate the Claimant by indicating that the charges and allegations
against him had been withdrawn,

that this was acceptable, Bundle H.60 [“We are pleased to confirm the agreement of
our client to hold the hearings in the offices of Clifford Chance.”].

 

Claimant “are not within the competence of the arbitration Tribunal and are
therefore inadmissible”. The basis for this objection is that certain of the
actions of which the Claimant complains are not attributable to the
Respondent, or that the relief so requested is not available under the terms
of the BIT. These objections essentially pertain to the merits of the dispute
and will be examined as such.

SUBSTANTIVE CLAIMS

187. The Claimant’s claims of breach of the BIT are examined under
each of the substantive protections invoked.

@ Expropriation

188. The Claimant alleges that the Respondent's administration of Manas
Bank, and the restrictions placed on the operations of the investment,
amount to an expropriation in violation of Article 5 of the BIT. The
Respondent counters that no expropriation has taken place since the
Claimant is still in possession of his shares in Manas Bank, and argues that
the administration of Manas Bank is a temporary measure permitted as a
regulatory exercise of the police powers of the Kyrgyz Republic.

a. Legal standard

189. Article 5 of the BIT sets forth the applicable expropriation standard:

"I. The Contracting Parties shall not directly or indirectly
apply measures to expropriate or nationalise the
investments of investors of the other Contracting Party or
measures having effect equivalent to nationalization or
expropriation (hereinafter referred to as "expropriation"),
except for expropriation:

(a) for public purposes;

(b) on anon-discriminatory basis; or

(c) in accordance with national laws; and

(2) with prompt, effective and adequate payment of
compensation, in accordance with paragraph 2 of this

Article.

2. Compensation shall:

(a) be made without delay. In the event of a delay, costs
caused by fluctuations in the exchange rate that flow from
the delay in payment shall be borne by the Contracting
Party in whose territory the investment was made;

(b) amount to the current market value of the
expropriated investment immediately before expropriation.
The determination of current market value shall disregard
any changes caused by the expropriation becoming public
knowledge before it took place;

(c) _ be effectively realizable and freely transferable; and
(@)__ include interest at the commercial market rate for the

currency for which the compensation will be paid, from the
date of expropriation to date of actual payment."

 

190, The Parties appear to be in agreement that the question before the
Tribunal is whether the actions of the Respondent amount to an indirect
expropriation of Manas Bank. Elaborating on the standard, the Claimant has
referred to the writings of Professor Schreuer:

An expropriation occurs if the interference is substantial
and deprives the investor of all or most of the benefits of
the investment. The deprivation would have to be
permanent or for a substantial period of time.'*

191. And further:

 

An indirect expropriation leaves the investor's title
untouched but deprives him of the possibility to utilize the
investment in a meaningful way’?

192, The Respondent defends the treatment directed towards Manas
Bank as constituting “general regulatory measures”.*! The Respondent
submits that “a state is not responsible for loss of property or for other
economic disadvantage resulting from the bona fide general” regulation

Investment Protection Treaties’, in C. Ribeiro (ed.), Investment Arbitration and the Energy
Charter Treaty, 2006, p. 37.

under the “police power of the states, if not discriminatory”.'? Citing to
Feldman v Mexico, Respondent notes that “government must be free to act
in the broader public interest.”"? Invoking Methanex v USA, it insists that
“as a matter of general international law, a non-discriminatory regulation for
a public purpose, which is enacted in accordance with due process and,
which affects, inter alios, a foreign investor or investment is not deemed
exptopriatory and compensable”.!“* Lastly, the Respondent notes the
observation in Saluka v The Czech Republic that “a State does not commit
an expropriation and is thus not liable to pay compensation to a
dispossessed alien investor when it adopts general regulations that are
‘commonly accepted as within the police power of States.’ ”’*°

193. The Claimant appears in general agreement with the legal principles
relied upon by the Respondent, but points out that as “the tribunals in Tza
Yap Shum v Peru and El Paso v Argentina recently held, the deference paid
to a State in exercising its police powers is limited where the exercise of that
police power is arbitrary, discriminatory and/or disproportionate.”"*

b. Determination of an Internationally
Wrongful Act

194. The Rejoinder appears to submit that for the Claimant to prove that
an internationally wrongful act has occurred, he must prove that the
Respondent breached its internal laws. In addition, the Respondent appears
to suggest that so long as a continuing criminal or regulatory investigation is

pending against the Claimant, a de facto expropriation cannot be found to
have occurred.

195. The Claimant invokes the familiar principle set down in Article 3 of
the ILC Articles on State Responsibility to the effect that determination of
an internally wrongful act is not affected by the characterisation of the same
act as lawful by internal law.'*” Whether an internal law has or has not been
respected is a question of fact that the Tribunal can consider in determining
whether there has been a breach of the BIT.

196. As for the ongoing investigations against Manas Bank, the Claimant,
and related individuals, the Tribunal understands that if the Kyrgyz
prosecutors abandon those investigations then the impetus for maintaining
the sequestration regime on Manas Bank may terminate. However, should
that occur, in which case control of Manas Bank may revert to the Claimant,
the value of that Bank would be gravely affected, and perhaps irreversibly
so, on account of its owner’s being deprived of the property for more than
four years, and of the ability to be present in an evolving market.

197. The Tribunal also understands that if prosecutors or other
investigators finally, after years of no indications of progress or even
systematic investigations, report that they have discovered evidence of
wrongdoing by Manas Bank, then the Respondent may consider that its
actions were justified. This Tribunal is charged with evaluating the facts
invoked by the Respondent to justify the measures it took when they were
taken, and what evidence was presented during the proceedings. There is
always a risk in any adjudicative proceeding that, years after it has
completed, new evidence may be said to arise that could affect the reasoning
of the adjudicator. However, the possibility of new evidence being found
does not mean that no determinations can ever be made. As always, a
balance must be struck. In this case, the Kyrgyz courts twice denied the
Kyrgyz prosecutor’s efforts to move forward, The process before this
Tribunal has given the Respondent four years to make its case.

c. Kyrgyz Authorities Abused their General
Regulatory Powers

198, The Tribunal naturally accepts that the application of general
regulatory powers, such as taxation or determination of bank capitalisation
standards, does not in and of itself amount to indirect expropriation. States
have considerable policy space to enact the laws and regulations they
believe are appropriate. The NBKR is not just empowered, but required to
regulate and inspect the activities of Manas Bank. Kyrgyz prosecutors are
equally charged with responsibility for conducting investigations when they
believe there may have been criminal wrongdoing.

 

47 ILC Article 3: The characterisation of an act of State as internationally wrongful is
governed by international law. Such characterisation is not affected by the
characterisation of the same act as lawful by internal law.

Lh

 

199, However, the measures challenged, while perhaps being based on
Kyrgyz law, are challenged as having been abusive and arbitrary
applications of that law given the factual reality as it was known. The
Claimant alleges that five measures amount to an abuse of the Respondent’s
authority to the degree that they resulted in an indirect expropriation.

200. The first measure at issue is the initial imposition of temporary
administration on 10 April 2010. While the Claimant does not dispute the
authority of the Respondent to take necessary emergency measures, as were
required immediately following 10 April 2010, the Claimant has
convincingly argued that in so far as the threats to the banking system were
physical threats, the imposition of temporary administration was a measure
that went beyond what was required to provide physical security to Manas
Bank.

201. The second measure at issue is the ongoing imposition of the
temporary administration by the NBKR, given the inadequate justifications
provided at their meeting of 28 April 2010, as described at Paragraph 78
above.'#® The NBKR continued the temporary administration because they
are empowered to “defend the interests of depositors and creditors and/or
maintain the stability of the republic’s financial and banking system.”
While the Bank is empowered to take such actions, which are general
regulatory measures, they must not be arbitrary, discriminatory or
disproportionate. As explained below, the actions of the NBKR failed to
respect that dividing line.

202. The third measure is the re-imposition of a temporary administration
regime from October 2010 to January 2011. The NBKR purportedly
justified this action on account of the failure of the Claimant to put in place
anew management team within a deadline of ten days. Yet the Bank had re-
imposed temporary administration even prior to the expiry of this deadline.
The Tribunal considers this re-imposition as non-compliant with Kyrgyz
law.

203. The fourth measure at issue is the imposition of the sequestration
regime. This was said to be justified by the criminal proceedings against
Manas Bank. These proceedings have continued for years, achieving very
little save two dismissals by the Kyrgyz courts — and the undeniable and
effective destruction of the Claimant’s investment. It is impossible to resist
the impression, given the way the matter has been handled, that they are
most unlikely to produce evidence of any wrongdoing by the Claimant or

 

M48 Supra n. 49.
Ibid.

 

 

Manas Bank, and in fact have been pursued in an abusive and
discriminatory fashion.

204. The fifth measure is the unjustified extension of the sequestration
regime. A state cannot be said to be acting in the public interest and
exercising its police powers when it takes actions that are not authorised by
its internal laws. As discussed, the Tribunal has received no satisfactory
answer justifying the extension of the sequestration regime beyond its
maximum permitted duration. The explanation offered, namely the fact that
Maxim Bakiev and the Claimant are acquaintances, itself seems so thin as to
give credence to the inference of arbitrary and discriminatory practices. The
Tribunal considers the extension as a clear violation of Kyrgyz law.

205, The Claimant has also described the above measures as being a
violation of the FET standard and in violation of other provisions of the
BIT. The Tribunal consider a number of these measures further in the
sections of this Award addressing those standards, However, the Tribunal
presently considers whether the measures in question amounted to a taking
of Manas Bank.

d. Measures Equivalent to a Taking

206. Whether there has been a measure equivalent to a taking depends on
whether there has been a substantial deprivation of the benefits of property
ownership, and that deprivation is permanent or imposed for a substantial
period of time.

207. Manas Bank has been under the “temporary” administration of the
NBKR since April 2010. Critically, Manas Bank has been under
sequestration administration for longer than is permitted under Kyrgyz law.
The Tribunal has been provided no assurances by the Respondent that this
temporary administration will soon be at an end. To the contrary, the
Tribunal understands that the temporary administration must be imposed
while there is an ongoing investigation against the Claimant and the
personnel of Manas bank.

208. While Kyrgyz law places limits on how long the NBKR can impose
temporary administration or sequestration administration, the NBKR has
extended both forms of administration in apparent contradiction with these
limits. As previously noted, the Respondent has been unable to explain the
legal basis for the continuing application of the sequestration regime to
Manas Bank. In effect, there is no reason to expect that the sequestration
administration of Manas Bank will terminate in a foreseeable future.

 

 

 

209. The Tribunal accepts that during the administration by the NBKR,
Manas Bank’s profitability and operations have been severely affected to
the point that even if it were returned to the Claimant’s control it has little or
no residual value,

210. The Tribunal concludes that in so far as the Respondent, in violation
of the maximum time limits prescribed by its own law, placed Manas Bank
under its administrative control and deprived the Claimant of all input into
its operations, the Respondent has indirectly expropriated the investment.

e. Public Purpose

211. Article 5(1)(a) of the BIT requires that expropriation be for public
purpose. While the initial imposition of the temporary administration regime
in mid-April 2010 may have been undertaken for a public purpose, the
administration of the temporary regime does not appear to have been
pursued with that goal. Rather, continued administration of Manas Bank
appears to have been undertaken because of suspicions of wrongdoing on
account of a connection between the Claimant and the Bakiev regime.
Further, the administration of Manas Bank permitted the return of funds to
state coffers despite contractual obligations to keep deposits with Manas
Bank. In addition, the administration allowed the expropriation of assets
secured by Manas Bank and prevented Manas Bank from taking legal
actions to claim compensation for the expropriation of these secured assets.

212. On the whole the actions of the Kyrgyz Republic do not appear to
have been taken in the interests of the public but to promote the narrower
interests of the government in obtaining by seizure of Manas Bank what
could not otherwise be achieved under the law.

f. Discriminatory Application

213. The Tribunal notes that actions were taken not just against Manas
Bank but also additional banks in the Kyrgyz Republic. While it may be that
the actions against the particular banks are related, perhaps because they all
are suspected of having connections with the Bakiev regime, there is
insufficient evidence before this Tribunal to make a determination that the
actions were discriminatory in the sense of the BIT (by which the Tribunal
means comprehensive discrimination susceptible to destroying an entire
investment, as opposed to incidental discriminatory acts).

 

 

 

Be In Accordance with Kyrgyz Law and for
Adequate Compensation

214. Neither aspect of Article 5(1) of the BIT is at issue as the
Respondent engaged in an indirect expropriation.

bh Conclusion

215. The Tribunal concludes that the ongoing imposition of an
administrative and sequestration regime on Manas Bank, with no end in
sight, for a period of at least four years amounts to a disguised taking and
expropriation of Manas Bank, The taking has not been for public purpose
but rather serves the narrower interests of the Government. The Respondent
has not compensated the Claimant for his lost property.

@) Fair and Equitable treatment

216. The Claimant has identified, inter alia, the imposition of temporary
administration, the administration itself, the imposition of sequestration
administration, and the criminal proceedings as being measures that breach
the Fair and Equitable Treatment standard.

a. The Respondent’s Defence

217. The Respondent has offered limited observations with regards to the
alleged breaches of the FET standard of protection. In the Statement of
Defence, the Respondent’s entire submission on FET consists of an
affirmation that the Claimant has been treated in accordance with Kyrgyz
law:

287. It has been explained above that the measures taken
were a part of the internal regulation norms of the Kyrgyz
Republic and it has not been established by the Claimant
that these internal regulation norms (the banking laws, the
Criminal Procedural Code and the Criminal Code of the
Kyrgyz Republic) would constitute a violation in one way
or another of the interests of investment of the Claimant.

288. It has to be reminded that these laws and Codes were
already in place at the moment that the investment initially
was made.

UF

289, The regulatory measures that were an execution of
this legislation were totally in accordance with this
legislation.

290. Therefore, the Claimant was given a fair and equal
treatment and the said standard was not violated.

218, The Respondent’s Rejoinder further states that “the Claimant argues
that [actions taken by the NBKR] constitute breaches of the Fair and Equal
Treatment” but that the Claimant has not proven that the actions “can be
considered as internationally wrongful acts” as the Claimant has not proven
that the actions of the “Public Prosecutor and the NBKR would have been
unlawful.”

219, Elaboration of the Respondent’s defence to the alleged breaches of
FET were only particularised in a Supplemental Rejoinder dated Wednesday
4 December 2013 — only a matter of days before the witness hearing started
on 9 December. In that fuller discussion, the Respondent stated that the
NBKR had no choice but to institute the administration and sequestration
regimes as it was its statutory duty to protect the Kyrgyz banking system.
The Respondent notes that a number of Manas Bank employees have
withdrawn their domestic legal challenges, sometimes after winning at first
instance, and suggest that these cases were withdrawn “when the NBKR
was ready to provide the court with concrete evidence of the plaintiffs’ — the
a] officials of Manas Bank CJSC -- violations of the legislation of the KR,
inter alia the Law On AML /CFT, and when the court began to consider the
filed claims on the merits”. The Respondent also notes that some of the civil
challenges were stayed pending the (stalled) criminal case. The Tribunal
understands that the Respondent may have been suggesting that an inference
against liability under the BIT be drawn from the discontinuance of the
challenges by Manas Bank employees.

220. The Respondent also noted that the length of the criminal
ih proceedings does not constitute a denial of justice as the case against the
Claimant and Manas Bank officials is complex and has been frustrated by
the refusal of individuals to return to the Kyrgyz Republic to face
questioning on the allegations against them. The Tribunal was also
reminded that it is suspicious that Manas Bank had significant foreign
i currency exchange operations.

221. Finally, in its post-hearing brief, the Respondent submitted that the
FET standard was not breached as the “Respondent did not deprive the
Claimant of his investments because the Claimant was and still is the sole
owner of the shares” of Manas Bank. The Respondent further submitted that
the temporary administration regime was imposed in accordance with

 

 

 

 

Kyrgyz law such that all requirements of procedural propriety and due
process were met.

222. The submissions of the Respondent are considered against the
Claimant’s contentions of breach of the FET standard.

db The Legal Standard

223. The BIT provides, at Article 2, that:

Investments and returns of investors of either Contracting
Party shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable
treatment and shall enjoy full protection and security in the
territory of the other Contracting Party.

224, One notes the absence of qualifying language, such as “in
accordance with customary international law”. No point has been taken as to
supposed consequences of the particular wording. Nevertheless, it is right to
bear in mind that the words appear in a type of treaty which became
commonplace in the second half of the 20" Century, and due consideration
should be given to construing them in a way that is consonant with those
treaties in general and thus to give effect to legitimate expectations. .

225, The Claimant, in reliance on Professors Dolzer and Schreuer, has
submitted that “the FET standard encompasses several legal principles,
including:

a. Transparency, stability and protection of the Investor's
legitimate expectations;

b. Compliance with contractual obligations;

ce. Procedural propriety and due process;

@. Good faith; and

7,150

e. Freedom from coercion and harassmeni

226. The Claimant further notes that “the prohibition of arbitrary
treatment has also been held to be encompassed by the FET standard” and
that “breach of any of these principles entails a breach of the FET standard.”
In his Supplemental Submission, the Claimant also explained why he

 

150 Supra n. 140 at Chapter VIL1.

 

 

 

 

considers that his treatment at the hands of the Respondent constituted a
denial of justice.

227. The Claimant’s Supplemental Submission also referred to a number
of recent awards that discuss the FET standard in a manner relevant to the
facts of this present dispute. Determination of whether the FET standard has
been breached in a given case is inherently fact specific. Nevertheless, its
tenets seem broadly well established and have not been disputed by the
Respondent:

29. The Respondent agrees with the Claimant’s opinion
that according to the BIT “investment and returns of
investor of either Contracting party shall at all times be
accorded fair and equitable treatment “ and that FET
standard should include the following principles:

a, Transparency, stability and protection of the investor’s
legitimate expectations;

b. Procedural propriety and due process.'*!

228. Although the Respondent in this passage did not also confirm other
often-repeated features of FET — such as compliance with contractual
obligations, good faith, freedom from coercion and harassment, prohibition
of arbitrary treatment, and denial of justice — they are in fact subcategories

or particularisations of the broader wording rather than different elements of
the undertaking.

229. The Claimant’s Reply particularised the breach of the FET standard
into eleven distinct episodes (to which their Supplemental Reply added a
violation of the denial of justice standard):

1. Imposition of Temporary Administrator without valid
legal grounds

2. Reinterpretation of legal standards

3. Mismanagement of Manas Bank

4. Unreasonable rejection of Mr. Belokon's good faith
efforts to resolve the situation surrounding Manas Bank

5. Imposition of Sequestration Administrator without valid
legal grounds

5! Respondent’s Post-Hearing Brief, 129.

 

6. Initiation of vexatious Criminal Trial

7. Resubmission of criminal case, notwithstanding
continued grave procedural defects

8. Request for Red Notices
9. Harassment and coercion and illegality
a. Requests for bribes

b, Demands for injection of share capital without
reciprocal return of shareholder control over Manas Bank

10. Procedural propriety and due process
a. Denial of standing to challenge Decree No. 10/1

b. Failure to seek explanations prior to initiation of
criminal trial.

c. Failure duly to serve process in respect of criminal trial

11. Lack of proportionality.‘
230. The Respondent did not present a particularised defence to the
breaches in the manner they were cast by the Claimant.

c Imposition of Temporary Administration

231. The imposition of temporary administration was defended as
necessary in order to prevent capital flight and to address the chaos in the
streets (which included attacks on ATMs).

232. States have considerable leeway in their policy actions, especially
when faced with emergency situations such as the overthrow of a regime.
As mentioned, the NBKR had an obligation to protect the Kyrgyz banking
sector. Although States are often said to enjoy margins of discretion with
respect to such matters, the Respondent’s actions must still be rationally
connected to their objectives. The lack of a rational connection is a strong
indication of manifestly arbitrary treatment. This does not mean that a
breach of the FET standard occurs where the State fails to pursue the most
rational means, or the best means to accomplish their objectives. However,
where there is no evident connection between the means and the objective, a
breach of the FET standard has likely occurred.

 

182 Claimant’s Reply, at ii.

 

 

 

233. As mentioned, the 28 April 2010 Decree of the NBKR identified the
imposition of the temporary administration regime as a “necessary measure”
on account of physical violence carried out against installations of the
Kyrgyz banking sector. A rational response to physical violence would have
been to employ the State’s security apparatus — not sending in a temporary
administration,

234. The Tribunal also notes that the NBKR was concerned to prevent
“unsafe, ill-advised or unscrupulous banking activities”, While the Tribunal
acknowledges that the imposition of temporary administration, under
Kyrgyz law, may be justified when such activities are identified, to avoid a
breach of the FET standard the NBKR must be aware of those activities
prior to the imposition of temporary administration. Decree No 10/1 of 8
April 2010 identified no such violations by Manas Bank. It is manifestly
arbitrary to impose sequestration and then identify alleged evidence a
posteriori to justify this decision.

235. The Tribunal further notes that had the NBKR imposed temporary
administration on Manas Bank and then lifted that administration in a few
days, once the chaos of the revolution had worn off, then the Respondent’s
actions may have been justified. However, no such defences have been
pleaded by the Respondent, nor would they be relevant at this stage given
that the temporary administration regime was continued.

da. Treatment during the Temporary
Administration Regime

236. The Claimant has identified a number of measures during the
temporary administration regime which he contends amounted to a breach
of the FET standard.

237. The first of such alleged breaches is the reinterpretation of Kyrgyz
banking norms regarding Pensionat Vityaz such that Manas Bank was in
breach of Kyrgyz law despite a prior audit not having found these loans to
be noncompliant. States are entitled to reverse prior determinations when
they are presented with new information or identify that they had previously
made an error. As mentioned, however, the Tribunal has been presented
with no basis on which the temporary administrator reversed her prior
determination with regard to the very same loans. While the Respondent has
alleged that perhaps there was impropriety with respect to the previous
NBKR audits, the temporary administrator, who testified before the
Tribunal, has not identified any pressure put on her to improperly sign off
on the 2009 audit of Manas Bank. The Tribunal thus finds the behaviour in
question to be manifestly arbitrary and the decision making of the NBKR to
be lacking in transparency.

 

238. The temporary administrator’s actions led to the withdrawal from
Manas Bank of deposits by the Kyrgyz Social Fund and the Development
Fund. While the Tribunal finds that the Temporary Administrator failed to
act in good faith in carrying out her duties and may have been in a situation
of conflict of interest, these activities do not amount to a breach of the FET
standard. The FET standard is not a remedy to every adverse action by a
government agent. The Tribunal notes that these depositors may well have
terminated their deposit agreements, albeit at a future date, even had Manas
Bank not been under temporary administration.

239. The Claimant, and former Manas Bank officials, attempted to
resolve the concerns of the NBKR through discussions with the temporary
administrator. The NBKR and the temporary administrator did not accept
these settlement offers, nor, it is alleged, did they act in good faith to resolve
the situation. On the fact of this case, the Tribunal does not find that failure
to reach a negotiated solution is sufficiently egregious to amount to a breach
of the FET standard.

e& Imposition of Sequestration Administration

240, The NBKR imposed a sequestration administration on Manas Bank
on account of the institution of criminal proceedings against officials of
Manas Bank by virtue of Article 8(3)(5) of the Kyrgyz Law on Banks and
Banking:

Article 8. Grounds for conservative appointment

3. The National Bank is obliged to introduce the
conservation and to appoint the conservative in the bank if
any of the following reasons has occurred:

5) the criminal case has been brought against bank's
persons in charge (being accused for offence of economical
and professional crimes) in accordance with
implementation of his/her duties; in addition, the term
“bank’s persons in charge” shall mean the persons having
the authority to participate or factually participating in
basic operations of the bank, forming the policy of the
bank, apart of the fact whether official title has been
assigned to him/her or not or whether the remuneration
has gained or not. The Chairman of the Board, Members of
the Board, the top persons in charge for financial matters

 

 

and credits are to be treated as executive persons in
charge.

241. However, it is to be recalled that the first temporary administrator
had removed the management and board of Manas Bank on 13 April 2010.
The criminally charged individuals were no longer persons in charge of
Manas Bank. Indeed, by Decree No 10/1, the temporary administrator had
“assume[d] the authority of the Board of Directors and of the Executive
Board of the Bank.” That these individuals had no power to act for Manas
Bank was even affirmed by the Kyrgyz Supreme Court, who found they had
no legal standing to take actions on behalf of Manas Bank.

242. It does not appear that the fact that proceedings were brought against
the Claimant, as a shareholder, would justify sequestration under Article
8(3)(5). In its post-hearing brief, the Respondent made significant efforts to
identify Mr. Belokon as the “supreme governing body” of Manas Bank.'™
The Respondent suggests that as the sole shareholder, the Claimant was to
approve large scale transactions of Manas Bank, such as granting of loans or
approving the large foreign currency trades undertaken by Manas Bank. In
support of this, it identifies Articles 37 and 38 of the Kyrgyz law on Joint
Stock Companies. While Article 37 of that law does identify the shareholder
as the supreme governing body, the type of transactions that are approved
by a shareholder do not include the day to day banking transactions (i.e.
currency conversions or loans) put forward by the Respondent. Article 38(7)
requires that shareholders “decide on major transaction in accordance with
Article 73 of this Act”. Article 73(2) of that law identifies that shareholder
approval is required for transactions which involve 50% or more of the book
value of the company. The Tribunal does not find that this type of
shareholder decision making is one for which Article 8(3)(5) of the Kyrgyz
law on banking and banks requires the imposition of sequestration
administration. The Claimant has denied involvement or knowledge of the
individual transactions that were undertaken by Manas Bank. He is not a
person with “authority to participate” nor was he “factually participating in
basic operations of the bank” as required by Article 8(3)(5).

243. The Tribunal therefore concludes that the imposition of
sequestration administration with the justification that it was required on
account of criminal proceedings brought against former officials or the
Claimant was arbitrary. There is no rational basis in appointing a
sequestration administrator on account of the alleged criminal activities of
former bank officials.

f. Criminal Proceedings

244. The Tribunal has noted the various criminal proceedings brought
against the Claimant and former Manas Bank officials. The Tribunal also
notes that these individuals plausibly contend that they were severely
affected by restrictions placed upon them through Interpol “Red Flags” and
notices within the Commonwealth of Independent States; those notices were
improper and should never have been issued, the Claimant insists.

245. The BIT however only requires FET in accordance with
“investments of investors of either contracting party”. Investments is a
defined term of the BIT and does not encompass the former directors and
management of Manas Bank. The Tribunal therefore does not consider it
has authority to consider the criminal proceedings, however abusive they
may be, in its analysis under the FET standard of this particular BIT, except
insofar as they form a pattern which may be relevant in assessing the
context as a whole.

246. The Tribunal does note however that the Respondent’s actions may
be considered a violation of Article 2(3) of the BIT:

3. Neither Contracting party shall in any way impair by
unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management,
maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of investments in
its territory of investors of the other Contracting Party.

247, The Tribunal shall consider the factual aspects at issue later in this
Award,

g. Requests for Further Capital

248. The Tribunal notes that the Claimant was requested by Manas Bank
administrators to provide additional capital to Manas Bank to keep it afloat.

249. While the Tribunal notes the challenges that these requests have
presented to the Claimant, they do not, on their face, appear to be a violation
of the FET standard absent additional actions by the Respondent.

h, Procedural Propriety and Due Process

250. The Claimant has alleged three measures by the Respondent as
constituting a denial of justice and a breach of the FET standard:

 

 

(a) The denial of standing to challenge Decree No 10/1;

(b) Failure to seek explanations from Manas Bank affiliated
individuals prior to instituting criminal proceedings against
them in alleged violation of Kyrgyz criminal law;

(©) Failure to serve Manas Bank individuals with notice of the
criminal proceedings against them in alleged violation of
Kyrgyz criminal law.

251. The latter of these two allegations, while understandably grave,
cannot be considered under this BIT as a breach of the FET standard as they
do not relate to the investment in Manas Bank. Again, they may be
considered under Article 2(3) of the BIT. The Tribunal notes that in the
Loewen decision, relied upon by the Claimant, the investment itself was the
subject of judicial proceedings.

252. The Tribunal acknowledges that the distinction between providing
FET to the directors and employees of an investment as opposed to the
investment itself may in certain contexts be artificial. However, given the
presence in this BIT of Article 2(3) the Tribunal considers it more
appropriate for such considerations to be analysed under that treaty
obligation.

253. As for the inability to challenge the imposition of temporary
administration and the dismissal of the board of Manas Bank, the Tribunal
also considers it more appropriate to undertake the analysis of whether the
measures in question are a violation of Article 2(3) of the BIT.

254. In addition, the Claimant appears to have alleged that the Respondent’s
“lack of proportionality” in its actions is a breach of the BIT. The Tribunal
does not consider that lack of proportionality can be considered in the
abstract as a violation of the FET standard but, as it has done in this Award,
as an element to be considered when determining whether measures amount
to a breach of the FET standard.

Gij) Full Protection and Security

254. The Claimant has alleged that the above measures are equally (or
alternatively) a breach of the Full Protection and Security standard defined
by Article 2(2) of the BIT. Given the Tribunal’s determinations under the
FET standard, the Tribunal does not believe it is necessary to address this
issue.

 

(iv) Unreasonable Interference with the Management,
Maintenance, Use, Enjoyment and Disposal of the
Investment

255. Article 2.3 of the BIT states that:

Neither Contracting party shall in any way impair by
unreasonable, discriminatory or arbitrary measures the
management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of
investments in its territory of investors of the other
Contracting Party.

256. The Claimant has provided a definition of arbitrary treatment by
Professor Schreuer:

a. a measure that inflicts damage on the investor without
serving any apparent legitimate purpose;

b. a measure that is not based on legal standards but on
discretion, prejudice or personal preference;

¢, a measure taken for reasons that are different from those
put forward by the decision maker;

d. a measure taken in wilful disregard of due process and
proper procedure."

257. The Tribunal notes that there is a considerable overlap between the
provision of protections under the FET standard and the prohibition against
unreasonable or discriminatory measures enshrined in Article 2(3) of the
BIT.

258. The Tribunal finds that where it has identified a breach of the FET
standard on account of arbitrary measures those measures are likely to
constitute overlapping violations of Article 2(3).

259. In its Statement of Defence, the Respondent has insisted that Article
2(3) of the BIT was not breached since the measures taken were in
accordance with the legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic.

260. The Tribunal considers that unreasonable and arbitrary measures
may well be taken pursuant to legislation and regulatory actions when there

 

55 EDF (Services) Ltd v Romania, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/13, Award, 8 October 2009
(Bemardini, Rovine, Derains) §. 303 [Citing to expert opinion of Professor Schreuer].

 

 

 

is a lack of a rational basis between the authority of the state to do
something and the facts supporting the use of that authority. It is not enough
for the Respondent to identify a source of local legal authority to justify an
action, but it must also overcome the Claimant’s contention that the
authority was exercised in an unreasonable and arbitrary fashion.

261. The Tribunal will in due course consider whether the refusal to grant
ding to chall the i ition of temporary inistration on Manas

Bank, as well as the criminal proceedings against the Claimant and Manas
Bank associated individuals, violated Article 2(3) of the BIT.

 

262. In the sections immediately below, the Tribunal considers (a) the
issue of standing to challenge Decree No 1-/1, (b) the criminal proceedings
against Manas Bank officials, and (c) the criminal proceedings against the
Claimant.

a No Standing to Challenge Decree No 10/1

263. The imposition of temporary administration restricted the
Claimant’s rights to manage Manas Bank and provide the strategic direction
he would have preferred. The Kyrgyz courts, as said, found that only the
temporary administrator herself had legal standing to challenge Decree No
10/1.

264, This is an unreasonable limitation on an investment. For a state to be
able to seize control of a foreign investment and provide no remedy for
access to the courts to challenge that seizure is a violation of Article 2(3) of
the BIT.

265. The Respondent has suggested that the Claimant himself might have
challenged Decree No 10/1, However, a corporate entity must be entitled to
have its day in court; it is no answer to say that one of its shareholders (even
a 100% shareholder) may raise the entity’s grievance on his own behalf as
an indirectly affected person. Certainly it is not the answer given by the
Kyrgyz Supreme Court, which focussed solely on the formal issue of
standing to act in the name of the entity:

However, in accordance with Article 3.1 of the Resolution
of the NBRK dated 30.09.208 No 36/5 only temporary
administrators of the Bank are authorised to represent it as

   
   
 
   
  
   
 
 
 
 
  
   
   
  
   
   
 
   
  
  

a legal entity in case temporary administration regime is
imposed.

266. The Tribunal concludes that the failure to provide for a practicable
means to challenge the imposition of temporary administration was an
unreasonable impairment of the right to develop and manage Manas Bank,
and to enjoy the fruits of its legitimate stakeholding, as the investor was
encouraged to do by the BIT.

b. The Criminal Proceedings against Manas
Bank Officials

267. The Tribunal considers the criminal proceedings to have had a
profound effect on the Claimant and the individuals associated with Manas
Bank. The Tribunal’s powers under the BIT are however limited. The
Tribunal cannot order the Respondent to cease investigating the Claimant or
former Manas Bank officials. Nor can the Tribunal award damages to
individuals who are not investors who have an investment in the Kyrgyz
Republic.

268. The Tribunal does however note that the treatment by the NBKR of
former Manas Bank officials likely rendered it nearly impossible for the
Claimant to identify new board members, as he was directed to do in the
days prior to the imposition of the second temporary administrator. These
actions thus constituted an interference with the management of Manas
Bank.

c The Criminal Proceedings against the
Claimant

269. The criminal proceedings against the Claimant were brought on
charges that he, with the Bakiev family and former NBKR officials, was
engaged in money laundering.'*”

| 270. Criminal allegations pursued against the Claimant in the absence of
evidentiary support (or even cogent explanations) infringe on his rights to
enjoy the benefits of his investment. A particular enjoyment of property is
the right to be associated with that investment. Where that association is
} improperly characterised as criminal, the impairment is evident. The

of Marat Alapaev, 14 January 2011; R-1.11, Bundle E.190.

 

 

 

perfunctory but persistent allegations against the Claimant have curtailed his
ability to manage his investment.

271. The Respondent is of course entitled to charge the Claimant with a
violation of any crime they have the evidence to support. The BIT does not
protect foreigners from criminal prosecution. However where that
prosecution is used meretriciously to impose a sequestration administration
and prohibit the management of property then the protections of the BIT
must come to the fore.

272. Where such criminal proceedings have consequences of depriving
the investor of the management, use, and enjoyment of property, then the
BIT requires that the underlying charges not be “unreasonable,
discriminatory or arbitrary”. The Tribunal recalls that Kyrgyz courts have
twice remanded the case against the Claimant back to the Kyrgyz
prosecutor. Further, the Respondent has not provided evidence to this
tribunal of money laundering committed by Mr. Belokon, nor has it
provided the reasoning of the prosecutor’s office that justified the criminal
proceedings. Whether under Kyrgyz law or under international law, Mr.
Belokon has a right to know the case against him. The conclusion in light of
the record is inescapable, to the effect that his investment was arbitrarily
destroyed and that compensation is accordingly due.

OTHER REQUESTED RELIEF

273. The Claimant has also put forward requests for:

an order that the Respondent shall terminate all
outstanding criminal and civil administrative investigations
and proceedings against the Claimant and any persons
affiliated with Manas Bank and shall not commence any
such proceedings in the future in relation to events that
occurred prior to the date of the award;

an order that the Respondent shall publish a statement in
the leading newspapers of the KR, by which it rehabilitates
the Claimant's name and indicates that all previous
allegations raised against him and persons affiliated with
Manas Bank have been withdrawn;

an order that the Respondent shall procure the withdrawal
of all police search warrants and equivalent search notices
issued by any international and/or Kyrgyz police authority
against Mr Belokon, Mr Verbickis, Mr Kacnovs and Ms
Matisone;

 
 
  
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
  
 
 
   
  
 
   

an order that the Respondent shall inform the relevant
authorities of the European Union, the UK and any other
Jurisdiction to whom the General Prosecutor has sent
defamatory statements about the Claimant / Manas Bank /

Baltic International Bank, that these statements are
withdrawn;

in the alternative to a monetary award of the amounts
loaned to depositors and paid to Ms Mirska, an order that
the KR procure that all the monies in the accounts at
Manas Bank of the depositors listed at paragraph 89 of the
Claimant's Statement of Claim be returned to those
depositors or their authorised representatives with accrued
interest and the monies in the account of Ms Mirska
referred to at paragraph 92 of the Statement of Claim be
paid to the Claimant with accrued interest.

274, Respondent asserts that “these claims are inadmissible” as under
Kyrgyz domestic law, it would be unconstitutional for the Kyrgyz

Republic’s executive branch to direct that the judicial branch do or not do
anything.’**

275, The Tribunal has not been provided with sufficient pertinent legal
authorities on the scope of its powers under the BIT or international law to
grant the above requested relief. Notably, while the Tribunal has been
directed to the ILC Articles on State Responsibility with regards to
questions of attribution (Articles 4 and 8), no reference appears to have been
made to this Tribunal’s authority to grant Satisfaction (Article 11) or
Assurances (Article 30) of the form requested. Nor is it clear that the
Tribunal can order restitution of moneys held by foreign Manas Bank
depositors who are not party to this arbitration.

276, The authority of this Tribunal to grant the above requested relief
under international Jaw or the BIT has not been sufficiently established in
these proceedings. The Tribunal declines to grant the requested relief.

QUANTUM

277. The Claimant’s damage experts, Chris Osborne and Stephen
Kingsley of FTI Consulting, state that Mr. Belokon has invested some
10.358 million US dollars into Manas Bank.'®? In their second expert report,

" Rejoinder, 164.

E 2012 at 8.6; Bundle D.2 [“First FTI Report”).

FTI valued Manas Bank at around 30 million US dollars, a decline from the
33 million US dollars calculated in their initial report.

278. During the hearing, FTI identified an alternate evaluation of 12
million US dollars based upon the assumption that the NBKR validly
restricted the type of banking activities that could be engaged in.

279. The Respondent’s experts, Andrew Howson and Paul Devine, of
East Star Capital, (“ESC”] valued Manas Bank as worth between USD
60,000 and 1.3 million.'*!

@ Valuation Date

280. FTI has selected a valuation date of December 2012. They did not
put forward a valuation as of the date of expropriation.

281. ESC does not appear to have identified a specific valuation date in
their reports. During the hearing, they were unable to identify a specific date
in response to questioning from the Tribunal, but Mr. Howson said the
evaluation date was what Manas Bank was “worth now”.! Following this,
Mr. Devine suggested that the report presented a valuation as “at the time of
sequestration of the bank”, but Mr. Howson then, in apparent contradiction,
stated that valuation dated “from the time of the report.”

Gi) ~~ Framework

282. FTI assessed the value of Manas Bank by reference to several
indicators and market comparators. They determined that Manas Bank was a
start-up retail bank with an aggressive but achievable growth plan.

283. ESC’s ultimate endorsement of a nil value for Manas Bank focused
on their assessment that Manas Bank was engaged in criminal operations.
ESC opined that:

Manas Bank, as a Bank trading in Kyrgyzstan, had no real
value because of a number of breaches advised to Manas

Bank by NBKR the license would in all likelihood have
been suspended or withdrawn at some stage.’
284. As noted, the Respondent has simply failed to substantiate the
allegations of unlawfulness and money laundering made by its officials and

experts. No Kyrgyz court has rendered a guilty verdict against Manas Bank,
the Claimant, or related individuals.

285. During the course of his examination, Mr. Devine stated that he and

Mr. Howson “are not experts in anything to do with anti-money laundering
or anything else.”! Despite their self-professed lack of expertise, and

indeed unfamiliarity with the national language, they completed their
second report very quickly indeed:

At the end, I would say that we had two and a half weeks,
of which one and a half weeks was trying to gather data
and information and talk to as many people as we possibly
could, One week was trying to put the report together. 166
286. FTI’s second report identified mathematical errors in ESC’s
analysis. During the hearing, ESC first acknowledged a number of these

errors, and when questioned admitted to a number of additional errors, some
minor and others more significant.

287. ESC has done little to reassure the Tribunal as to the accuracy of
their analysis. FTI had requested that they be provided with the underlying
calculations used by ESC. During their examination, Mr. Howson and Mr.
Devine noted that they had not provided the underlying Excel sheets they
used in their calculations because, as they said rather blithely, they did not
think the FTI still wanted these calculations,’ They admitted knowing that
FTI wanted this dataset for review and that they wanted to wait to give it
until after their second report was circulated. When that moment came in the

wake of the December 2013 hearing, ESC did not in fact circulate their
worksheets,

(iii) ~~ Bank Valuation Methodology

288. Incase of expropriation, Article 4(1) of the BIT provides that:

'®" Hearing Transcript, Day 5, pp 43-44,

 

 

 

 

Compensation shall amount to the market value of the
investment expropriated immediately before expropriation
or before impending expropriation became public
knowledge.

289. As is generally the case, the BIT provides no detailed guidance in
case of a violation of the FET standard. Still, the test of putting the injured
party in the same position that it would have been in had the breach not
occurred is one of general application in the context of State responsibility.
In the case of the destruction of a going business, in the absence of the
breach the investor would still be in possession of the going business and
the quantum is thus simply the answer to the question: what would it be
worth under this hypothesis?

290. In determining the market value of Manas Bank, FTI proposed using
a “multiple applied to the bank’s assets”, which they opined is the generally
used approach for bank valuation.'®* They also adopted a “price to book”
method [“P/B”]. FTI further stated that a DCF value is inappropriate as
Manas Bank had only 3 years of detailed forecasts, too few for a DCF
model. In their second report, FTI added:

... in the case of banks, valuations are not typically carried
out on a DCF basis, but rather on the basis of a P/B
multiple. We can find no third party support for the
proposition that discounted cash flow valuations are either
popular or widely used for the purposes of valuing banks.
Jn our own experience, the reverse is in fact true."®

291. ESC were less definitive in the selection of an evaluation
methodology. During examination, they noted that they used three methods
of evaluation, including P/B and DCF.'” ESC however appeared to prefer
the DCF method.!”

292. The reason why ESC selected the DCF method is ultimately unclear.
During examination, they suggested that they used that method “largely
because we wanted to stay roughly within the same parameters as FTI on
the valuation.” Yet FTI adopted a price to book method. Further, it
appears, regrettably, that ESC reproduced without attribution significant

portions of a text by a Professor Aswarth Damodaran, who has written about
bank valuations. Having done so, ESC concluded:

the discounted cashflow valuation is a popular and the
most widely used valuation approach not only to banks but
to many companies and projects."

293. No sources are cited. During examination, Mr. Howson was unable
to explain why his report so concluded.'* A review of Professor
Damodaran’s cited article does not obviously suggest that he prefers a DCF
methodology for bank valuation. It may well be that the error in the ESC
report is not attributable directly to Mr. Howson and Mr. Devine, and that
one of their staff members independently decided to plagiarise and modify
the conclusions of Professor Damodaran, ” but it certainly does not
encourage the Tribunal to give much weight to their opinions. The value of
expert reports depends upon the Tribunal’s trust in the expertise and earnest
analysis which is manifest in them. The Respondent’s experts have not
established the reliability of their conclusions.

294. The Tribunal accepts the Claimant’s proposal for using a “Price to
Book” method for determining the value of Manas Bank as one which is
favoured in the context of bank valuation.

a. Manas Bank’s Business Model

295. ESC opines that Manas Bank is not a bank engaged in retail
operations, but rather a private wealth bank. The Tribunal understands that
if Manas Bank were a private bank, providing personalised services to high
net worth individuals, its market value would be considerably reduced given
the risks of maintaining the goodwill of such a limited market segment in
the environment of a small nation located far from the major international
banking centres.

296. FTI disagrees that Manas Bank is a private wealth bank. While they
accept that there was a high concentration of banking activities serving a
limited number of clients, they identify that Manas Bank’s goals and
activities were consistent with retail banking. For example, they note that
services were in place for customers to pay utility bills.

(‘First BSC Report”).

1™ Hearing Transcript, Day 5, p 103.
5 Hearing Transcript, Day 5, p 102.

297, ESC identified numerous aspects in support of their conclusion that
Manas Bank is a private wealth bank:

1. Branches: with only 5 branches Manas was one of the
smallest banks in the KR again its main business was
conducted through the main branch in Bishkek.

2. Customers: total of 4454 accounts were opened during
the trading period of Manas. A number of these were
closed during the period. There are also a great number of
these accounts that have the same name and repeat. Also
most were ELCARD users so not traditional opened
accounts.

3. It was difficult to estimate usage rates by clients and
services given the limited time and data available.

4, ATMs are an increasingly important part of banking.

5. Systems: as at April 2010 the key platform of the system
was not installed, until it was installed it was not possible
to expand the bank to retail operation. The IT section was
not developed sufficiently to operate a high transaction
system such that is typical in a retail bank.

6. Customer service structure: Manas bank had no retail
bank structure such as customer services specialists,
branches and structure,

7. The depositors and the loan book of Manas Bank were
highly concentrated into corporate accounts with large
state owned organization. To reiterate 80.4% of deposits
were with 12 clients, and 89.2% of loans with 10 clients in
addition these 10 clients generated little of all transactions
in the bank. In effect the bank depended on these clients.
Behind this the control of the state industries was held by
CADII which was controlled by Maksim Bakiev. Such a
i concentration suggests that Manas Bank was focused on
i servicing the needs of a small group of largely corporate
il clients. This suggests that the bank was more akin to a
r specialist corporate financing organization. As stated by
i Mr Verbickis he had made a point of visiting his main
: customers personally,

income and 57% from fees and services. This was planned
to continue in subsequent years,

ESC further contended that

© The depositors and the loan book of Manas Bank were
highly concentrated into corporate accounts with large
state owned organization. To reiterate 80.4% of deposits
were with 12 clients and 89.2% of loans with 12 clients in
addition these 12 clients generated a minimal number of all
transactions in the bank. In effect the bank depended on
this small number of clients.

e Such a concentration suggests that Manas Bank was
focused on servicing the needs of a small group of largely
corporate or foreign clients. This suggests that the bank
was more akin to an specialist corporate financing
organization

© Given the style and nature of many depositors and
borrowers, a great number of whom were not Kyrgyz
residence, but foreign nationals, it would appear that the
bank was used primarily for the movement of monies
across jurisdictions,

e The lack of service infrastructure and systems to support
large scale financial transactions by multiple users.

@ Manas bank was dependent on fees Sor service for
revenue rather than interest earned.'

In response, FTI’s second report noted:

2.6 In our experience, a private wealth bank would have:

* senior relationship management professionals well-
networked in the high net worth and ultra-high net worth
community;

* an investment management and investment origination
capability of its own or, alternatively, access to third party
investment products;

 

176 First ESC Report, at 49,
17 First ESC Report, at $1.

 

+ an infrastructure of processes, systems and people which
responds to the requirements of private banking and
private wealth management needs; and

* a business plan that supports a private wealth bank
business.

2.7 Manas Bank did not have any of these features, and we
understand that it did not plan to have them. Contrary to
the ESC statements, Manas Bank’s high non-interest
income relative to interest income is not an indication that
Manas Bank was a private wealth bank.

Furthermore, a central feature of a private wealth bank is
that it should be incorporated and operating in a
Jurisdiction which is politically stable, with relatively
certain legal and fiscal outcomes. We do not believe that
the Kyrgyz Republic would likely meet these requirements
in the eyes of potential private banking clients. m

300. After considering the criteria put forward by the experts on both
sides, the Tribunal concludes that the factors identified by ESC are
consistent with Manas Bank being a new bank. The Tribunal notes that the
second ESC report accepts that Manas Bank had plans for expanding its
network into new branches and had, for example, taken steps to acquire
further ATMs."

301. The Tribunal finds that Manas Bank was a new retail bank and not a
private wealth bank limited to the market of high net worth individuals. This
does not, of course, imply acceptance that its future was secure and
predictable as a matter of market risks wholly independent of whether the
terms of the BIT were respected. As the Claimant was no doubt aware,
doing business in the Kyrgyz Republic, given the then current state of its

(iv) ~—- Valuation According to the Price to Book Method

302. Evaluations using the price to book method are undertaken by
dividing the market capitalisation by the book value of equity.'®° To
determine a valuation ratio, FTI examined comparable transactions and
initially determined that the market was paying 1.57-1.67 times the book

value of similarly situated banks. Their first report concluded that Manas
Bank would have a value of 36 million US dollars. From this figure, 2.7
million US dollars were removed to account for the fact that the Claimant
did not make a further investment in Manas Bank of that amount in May
2010, as had been expected prior to the events of April 2010. The first FTI
report assessed the Claimant’s loss at 33 million US dollars.

303. The second FTI report reduced the P/B ratio to 1.51. This reduction
reflected more recent data for the valuation period up to December 2012.
The second FTI report accordingly found a value of Manas Bank of 30
million US dollars. The second FTI Report alternatively provided a figure of
29.2 million, which is reached on assumption that the new Kyrgyz
government could have removed funds belonging to the Kyrgyz
Development Fund from Manas Bank even absent institution of temporary
administration.

304, The first ESC report identified a P/B ratio for Manas Bank of 0.49
which would lead to a 4.5 million US dollar figure.!*!

305. FTI’s identification of comparable banks was undertaken by
searching for banks which had a majority shareholding acquired from
January 2010 to June 2012 in Central and Eastern Europe and for which
sufficient data was available to calculate historical P/B ratios. FTI identified
banks in Belarus, Poland, the Russian Federation, Estonia and Ukraine.'®
However, they rejected outliers with P/B multiples of less than 0.6 and
greater than 3.0.8

306. ESC looked to other banks in the Kyrgyz Republic. They excluded
data for a Kyrgyz bank known as Demirbank, notwithstanding their own
identification of Demirbank as one that “fits the model of a western style
retail bank operating in the [Kyrgyz Republic].”"™*

307. The second FTI Report opines that the P/B values used by the ESC
are doubtful as they are from banks that were not publicly traded.’®* Indeed,
they further note that the ESC figures exactly match the nominal capital of
the Kyrgyz banks studied. FTI considers Demirbank as having been
comparably situated to Manas Bank in May 2010 and for 2012 projections.

308. The Tribunal accepts FTI’s conclusion that comparably situated
banks have a P/B value reasonably assessed at 1.51. The methodology
adopted by ESC does not appear reliable for the reasons identified by FTI.

@® ~~ Adjustments

309. As mentioned, the BIT envisages valuation as of the date of
expropriation. While this is not necessarily applicable in the context of illicit
expropriation, the Tribunal, when evaluating a business which in effect no
longer exists, and having regard to the way this case has been pleaded,
retains this date and declines to adopt the December 2012 valuation date
proposed by FTI.

310. FTI estimates the equity book value of Manas Bank as of 31 Dec
2010 at 563,267,000 Kyrgyz soms,'®* As of 31 December 2009, this value
was at 394,668,000 Kyrgyz soms. ESC has adopted the same figures.’®”
Applying the P/B value of 1.51 and an exchange rate of 1 US dollar to 45
KGS, this provides a valuation between approximately 13.2 million US
dollars and 18.9 million dollars.

311. The Tribunal determines that the value of Manas Bank as of roughly
three months prior to the date of expropriation was $13,243,304.'%* The
Tribunal does not consider it necessary to update the 31 December 2009
value to April 2010. There is insufficient evidence that the value of Manas
Bank changed significantly in the intervening three months.

312. The Tribunal is conscious that its approach to the issue of
compensation for damage suffered is in some respects mechanistic, and
unlikely to be wholly consonant, one way or the other, with the uncertainties
of business in the Kyrgyz Republic as they have revealed themselves in the
record of this case. The final numbers reflect what the arbitrators believe to
be prudent approximations derived from the best information available to
them rather than transaction-by-transaction verifications which have not
been possible in the circumstances. In sum, the circumstances are not free
from difficulty or doubt. It remains that the deserving party, when it has
satisfied the fact-finder of the reality of damages suffered, is not to be
frustrated by the fact that the quantum of its loss cannot be assessed to
scientific certainty.

(i) — Cost of Loans to Depositors

313. The Claimant has identified an additional head of damage resulting
from the Respondent’s actions, namely his liability under indemnity
undertakings, through Belokon Holdings, provided to certain customers of
Manas Bank whose assets at Manas Bank have been frozen by the
Respondent. These indemnities amount to USD 3,765,039 and EUR
1,527,142.77.

314. The Respondent’s Statement of Defence contested the arbitrability
of these claims, as the loans were made by Belokon Holdings.’ In the
Claimant’s Reply, counsel explained that the Claimant is also the majority
shareholder of Belokon Holdings and that he had issued a personal
guarantee in respect of the loans themselves.

315. While Mr, Belokon, through Belokon Holdings, may be exposed to
significant losses on account of these liabilities, he has not given sufficient
particulars to satisfy the Tribunal that the BIT considers the transactions
entered into as generating interests that meet the BIT’s definition of
“investment in the territory” of the Kyrgyz Republic. For the Claimant as a
foreign banker to have provided guarantees of foreigners’ deposits in the
Manas Bank may have been useful in building up the Bank’s capital base,
but the implications raised have not been adequately developed in this case
to permit at extension of the BIT to his claims in relation thereto.

316, The Tribunal notes that the funds in question are still held with
Manas Bank and the account holders are presumably at liberty to take
recourse against Manas Bank or the Kyrgyz Republic for return of their
property, including (conceivably) under instruments of international law.

(ii) ~Reputational Harm

317. In the pre-hearing skeleton, the Claimant has in addition requested
monetary compensation, as satisfaction, for the reputational harm he has
suffered. '®° No particular quantum has been suggested.

318. The Tribunal considers that the conclusions reached in this Award
should adequately restore the reputational harm suffered by the Claimant.

(viii) Interest

319. The Claimant has requested pre-Award interest “at the rate for
deposits in US dollars in Latvia.”"*! The requested rates are at 4.6% for
2010, 3% for 2011, 2.7% for 2012, and 2.2% for 2013.’ The Claimant has
requested that interest be compounded daily and has requested that post-
Award interest be awarded at 5%, compounded monthly. The Claimant has,
in the lead up to the December 2013 hearing, requested interest at a rate of
10% annually, compounded.'

320. The Respondent has noted the (initial) requested rates, without
further comment.'™*

321. The BIT provides that, in case of expropriation, compensation shall
“include interest at the commercial market rate for the currency for which
the compensation will be paid, from the date of expropriation to date of
actual payment.” This criterion is of course applicable to lawful
expropriation, whereas in this case the limitation does not apply to the
extent that the Claimant has established that in the absence of breach of the
BJT he would have had higher earnings. The Tribunal does not find that
compensation in this case justifies more than interest at a commercial
market rate for the US dollar.

322. The Tribunal determines that the date of expropriation is as of 8
April 2010.

323. Given that the Respondent has not contested the Claimant’s
proposed rates, and their commercial reasonableness, the Tribunal
concludes that an appropriate commercial market rate is the rate for deposits
in US dollars in Latvia, compounded annually:

Interest on

4.

 

Total Interest: $1,784,959.49

324, The Tribunal thus awards interest in the amount of $1,784,959.49, as
of 30 August 2014. The total amount is rounded downward in favour of the
debtor to US$ 15,020,000.00.

325. Post-Award interest should run as a matter of commercial realism at
a rate that is unlikely to reward postponed payment. The Tribunal considers
it fair to fix the post-Award rate at 4.5 % per annum, compounded annually,
representing in the arbitrators view a rate which broadly conforms to current
corporate debt instruments offered to the public. The Tribunal cannot
predict the future, and therefore chooses this rate as its best estimate,
prudently lower than the highest yields available.

SHARES

326. While the Respondent has made no specific request for a share
transfer, the Tribunal considers an order to this effect a natural consequence
of the determination that compensation is due on account of expropriation.

327. The Tribunal, having found that the Kyrgyz Republic has
expropriated Manas Bank, as of April 2010, deems it necessary that Mr.
Belokon transfer his shares in Manas Bank to the Kyrgyz Republic
following full payment of all damages, costs, and interest ordered payable in
this Award.

COSTS

328. In the Post-hearing Procedural Order, the Tribunal requested that the
Parties provide submissions on costs. This request is made pursuant to
Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules 1976:

 

‘SS Rates are applied pro-rata to the number of months at issue: for 2010 nine months, and
2014 eight months.

 

"The arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in
its award."

329. Article 40(1) of those Rules provides the “that costs of arbitration
shall in principle be bome by the unsuccessful party”.

330. Each Party has contributed EUR 250,000 to the fees and expenses
of the Tribunal. The arbitrators’ fees and expenses have, in total, somewhat
exceeded the amount of the advances, but each of them has agreed to waive
the overrun. The arbitrators consider that, as the prevailing party, the
Claimant is entitled to recover its contribution from the Respondent.

331. The Respondent has requested that the Tribunal:

Condemn the Claimant to the payment of the expenses
associated with his claim and arbitration in the amount of
750 000 USD as well as all arbitration costs.

332. The Respondent has not elaborated on what is meant by “all
arbitration costs,” but the Tribunal understands they refer to the costs that
are generally associated with an arbitration as submitted by the Claimant.
The Parties therefore appear in agreement that costs are to be allocated to
the unsuccessful party.

333. The Claimant has asserted a particularised claim for reimbursement
of its legal costs and disbursements in the amount of EUR 1,958,430.08,
plus its portion of the advances on account of the Tribunal’s costs. He is in a
broad sense the prevailing party, and was undoubtedly put to additional
expense by unwarranted applications by the Respondent. On the other hand,
a number of his claims were denied or reduced, and moreover the Tribunal
is conscious that the reasonability of fees includes a measure of
proportionality, In the circumstances, the Tribunal determines it just and
proper that the Respondent contribute to 50% of the Claimant’s costs of
presenting its case.

334. Costs are thus awarded in favour of the Claimant in the amount of
EUR 979,215.04, rounded downward in favour of the debtor to EUR
970,000.00. Unpaid costs shall incur interest at the same rate as that of the
Award, 4.5% compounded annually.
