Overview of the Dispute

The Tribunal has considered all of the Parties’ submissions and the arguments and evidence
presented by them in these proceedings. This Award will focus on the materials determinative
to its decisions and the resolution of this dispute. All issues have been considered. Any request

for relief not expressly granted in this Award is hereby denied.

A. Summary of Facts

The facts giving rise to this dispute on the merits are largely uncontested. The main differences
between the Parties reside in the legal qualification of these events and in whether Respondent
bears culpability or liability for them. The Tribunal adopts the “Overview of the Dispute”
contained in its Decision on Preliminary Objections. Below, the Tribunal summarizes the
factual submissions that were most relevant to the Tribunal’s decisions. The Tribunal’s factual
findings as they relate to the arguments submitted and the claims raised are presented within

the Tribunal’s analysis.

Nigeria is among the world’s largest producers of oil and its oil assets are managed by the
state-owned authority, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (“NNPC”).! This dispute
centers on Claimants’ investment in the oil and gas industry in Nigeria, which resulted in the
joint venture, ownership, and operation of Nigerian Oil Mining Lease 98 (“OML 98”) and Oil
Prospecting License 275 (“OPL 275”) through a Nigerian corporate entity, Pan Ocean Oil
Company (“POOC” or “Pan Ocean”).

This joint venture is known as the “NNPC/POOC Joint Venture.” Pan Ocean is the operator
of OML 98 and holder of OPL 275. The current lease output is approximately 50,000 bpd of
crude oil.? Until 1998, Claimants were the 100% beneficial owner of the 40% participating
interest in OML 98 and related assets (as Pan Ocean) and Respondent was the owner of 60%
of the participating interest (as NNPC).> The subject of this arbitration is Claimants’ 40%

participating interest in OML 98 and OPL 275, created by the joint venture.*

Claimants allege that they alone invested capital in the Asaboro and Ogharefe fields to make
OML 98 profitable. Since July 1998, Claimants made further investments by discharging the
40% of the contributed operational costs to the production of OML 98 and all other operations

of Pan Ocean, including the acquisition of a second rig and the purchase of another oil block

OPL 275, in 2007 or 2008. OPL 275 is co-extensive of Claimants’ original investment in OML
98.°

Dr. Vittorio Fabbri was the beneficial owner of Impex Limited, which had been the legal owner

of both Claimant companies since 1983.°

Impex owned Claimants, which owned Pan Ocean.’ Claimants allege that the authorized share
capital of Pan Ocean is Naira 10,000 divided into Ten Thousand Ordinary Shares of Naira 1.00
each.* Claimants hold 1,250 shares each (2,500 shares total) in Pan Ocean and allege that these

are the only shares of Pan Ocean that have been validly issued and allotted.?

In the mid-1980s, the Board of Pan Ocean consisted of three directors: Dr. Fabbri, Dr. Festus
Fadeyi, and Mr. Herbert Rooks, with Dr. Fabbri acting as Managing Director.'° Dr. Fadeyi
later became Managing Director of Pan Ocean. He performed executive duties but held no

ownership rights in the company.!!

According to Respondent, on 9 October 1984, Pan Ocean and NNPC concluded a Crude Oil
Sales Contract. Respondent alleges that, three years later in 1987, Pan Ocean lifted certain

cargoes of crude oil without payment, in violation of the Crude Oil Sales Contract. '*

In July 1987, Mr. Rooks was in Nigeria with a power of Attorney from Dr. Fabbri to relieve
Dr. Fadeyi of his duties.!? According to Claimants, Mr. Rooks and two others were detained
without charges and were finally released from detention in Nigeria on 23 December 1987,

after 5 months.'* Claimants allege that this was part of an effort by Respondent to enforce its

proceeds of Pan Ocean’s 40% participating interest in OML 98 in specified amounts over a period starting in 2002
and ending in 2012.

rights as a joint venture partner.'> From 1987 onward, Dr. Fadeyi was the only Director of Pan

Ocean who remained physically present in Nigeria. '°

In May 1989, Pan Ocean and NNPC signed a Settlement Agreement following a commercial
arbitration, pursuant to which a debt related to the 1987 dispute was to be repaid from Pan
Ocean to NNPC.'? Pan Ocean agreed to pay NNPC the sum of $371,991,279, comprising the
principal sum of US$ 135,610,140, plus interest, in relation to crude oil purchases of 4,928,880
barrels.'* Pursuant to this agreement, payment would commence in 2002, with the balance

fully paid in 2012."
In December 1997, Dr. Fabbri was diagnosed with terminal liver cancer.”

Claimants allege that Dr. Fabbri transferred 100% of the beneficial interest in Impex to his ex-
wife, Mrs. Annabella Timolini, via stock transfer agreement on 13 January 1998, in the

presence of his eldest son, Mr. Patrizio Fabbri.7!

Respondent states that on 17 June 1998, Dr. Fabbri, as Chairman of Pan Ocean, acknowledged
the outstanding debt to the NNPC and proposed a debt repayment plan, pursuant to which the
debt owed to NNPC would be repaid from 2002 — 2009, with the balance fully paid in 2012.77

The letter makes no mention of any change in the ownership of Impex.

On 20 or 24 July 1998, at a Board Meeting of Pan Ocean, there was an allotment of shares
purportedly made by Mr. Rooks to Mr. Jacob Tomisin.?> Mr. Rooks in an affidavit of 26

August 2003 stated that he did not do this transaction.”*

Months after contracting a terminal cancer, Dr. Fabbri died intestate on 1 September 1998.7°

On 28 September 1998, on the invitation of Mrs. Timolini, Dr. Fadeyi attended a meeting in
Geneva where Claimants allege that they informed Dr. Fadeyi and Justice Duro Adebiyi (Legal
Secretary of Pan Ocean) of Mrs. Timolini’s status as shareholder and Chairman of the Board

of Impex.?°

Claimants allege that, since September 1998, Claimants have been denied information about
or access to joint venture meetings or joint operating committee deliberations and the

accounting, financial, and business affairs or production status of the joint venture operations.””

Claimants’ representatives Mr. John Brunner and Mr. Richard Evans made plans for late 1998
to travel to Nigeria to review Pan Ocean’s accounts on Mrs. Timolini’s behalf, but these were
cancelled by Dr. Fadeyi.?* Dr. Fadeyi directed all communication through his lawyers, the
Law Union, who refused to accept the validity of the Deed of Transfer that Dr. Fabbri allegedly

executed before his death.”

On 15 October 1998, Dr. Fadeyi called a meeting where he removed Mr. Rooks as Director
and appointed two of his associates in his place: Mr. Alhaji Muhammed Dikko Yusufu and
Justice Duro Adebiyi. This was later declared irregular by the Corporate Affairs Commission

(“CAC”).*°

On 21 October 1998, the Law Union wrote to Mrs. Timolini’s attorney, Mr. Jacques Jones,
stating that the consent of the NNPC was required before any transfer of the interest of Pan

Ocean could be valid.*!

It is unclear whether Dr. Fabbri’s ex-wife, Mrs. Timolini, ever held the beneficial interest in
Claimants. Dr. Fabbri and Mrs. Timolini divorced prior to his death. While the Parties agree
that Mrs. Timolini yielded whatever interest she may have had to the estate of Dr. Fabbri in
2010, her alleged ownership of Impex, which owns Claimant companies, may have been an
intervening factor with respect to Respondent’s refusal to acknowledge communications from
Mrs. Timolini regarding the ownership of the shares.** Claimants have alleged that the
beneficial interest of Claimants was owned by Dr. Fabbri until his death.*> Claimants have
also alleged that, prior to his death, Dr. Fabbri transferred 100% of the beneficial interest in
Impex to his ex-wife via stock transfer agreement on 13 January 1998, in the presence of his
eldest son, Mr. Patrizio Fabbri.** Respondent never recognized the validity of this transfer,
and the transfer was declared invalid by Justice Olomojobi of the Federal High Court of

Nigeria.*>

In March 2000, Chief Sena Anthony, Legal Advisor to the NNPC, wrote a letter in response to
an inquiry by Mrs. Timolini and confirmed that the NNPC’s consent was not required in case
of change of Pan Ocean’s ultimate beneficial ownership.*° Chief Anthony advised, however,
that they seek the consent of the Government and of the other shareholders. Claimants allege
that this is how they discovered the first irregular issuance of shares by Dr. Fadeyi to a third
person, Mr. Tomisin. Respondent submits that the communications sent to the NNPC on behalf
of Mrs. Timolini were only aimed at obtaining an acknowledgment or confirmation of her

asserted beneficial ownership of Pan Ocean.*”

In May 2002, Pan Ocean and NNPC entered into a Joint Operating Agreement.**

On 16 December 2002, Claimants initiated a claim against Dr. Fadeyi and others, seeking
declarations that Claimants were the beneficial owners of Pan Ocean and seeking to nullify all
purported general and board meetings following September 1998, among other actions
occurring after that date. The action was withdrawn by notice of discontinuance on 11 March

2004.

On 3 February 2003, Claimants petitioned the CAC to conduct an investigation into the affairs

of Pan Ocean.*”

On 29 March 2004, Pan Ocean (under the leadership of Dr. Fadeyi) filed an action against Mrs.
Timolini, alleging that neither Mrs. Timolini nor Mr. Patrizio Fabbri were shareholders or

directors of Pan Ocean (“2004 Fraud Case”).*!

The Parties dispute whether, in 2004, Claimants’ representatives scheduled a meeting with the
then-Presidential Advisor to the President Nigeria on Petroleum and Energy Matters to seek a
settlement of the dispute. According to Claimants, the Presidential Advisor subsequently
refused to meet with Claimants’ representatives, who had traveled from Geneva to Abuja for
the meeting.*? Respondent disputes that in 2004 representatives of the Estate of Dr. Fabbri

secured an appointment with the then-Presidential Advisor on Petroleum and Energy in an

attempt to settle the case.+? Respondent states that there is no evidence that any meeting was

planned.“

In 2005, at Claimants’ insistence while the 2004 Fraud Case was pending, the CAC
investigated the affairs of Pan Ocean, pursuant to its statutory powers under Respondent’s
company law.*> The CAC issued its report, which confirmed Dr. Fabbri as the sole owner of
the beneficial interest in Pan Ocean and, consequently, Claimants’ 40% participating interest
in the OML 98.*° As noted above, OML 98 serves as a focus for this dispute, given Claimants’
investment in Nigeria having been effected through ownership and operation of Nigerian Oil
Mining Lease 98 and Oil Prospecting License 275 through the Nigerian corporate entity, Pan
Ocean Oil Company.

The 2004 Fraud Case was concluded on 10 November 2005, when a Nigerian Court judgment
dated 10 November 2005 declared Dr. Fabbri as the sole and beneficial owner of all the
undertaking in Pan Ocean.*” The case was, thus, resolved in Claimants’ favor, finding that Dr.

Fabbri and Claimants were the only owners of the beneficial interest in Pan Ocean.

The “2005 Board Meeting Case” began on 21 November 2005, when Dr. Fadeyi applied for
the Court’s leave to hold a Board Meeting of Pan Ocean, and supported the same with an
affidavit stating that the absence of directors of Pan Ocean made it impossible to uphold normal
business operations in the Country.** The affidavit stated that Mr. Rooks “departed Nigeria

and had since never returned to the country” and “his efforts to locate him had proven

abortive.”*? This application was granted on 24 November 2005.*° Claimants filed an appeal
on the same day.*! The requested Board Meeting was held on 29 November 2005, and
resolutions were passed allotting the remaining 7,500 unissued shares of Pan Ocean to
Dr. Fadeyi and his associates.*? On 1 and 28 December 2005, Dr. Fadeyi sought to give notice
of an Extraordinary General Meeting of Pan Ocean, where he would validate the allotment of
shares made on 29 November 2005.** Claimants submit that no shareholders were present at
that meeting and that “there is no evidence that they were even notified of it.”°+ Dr. Fadeyi
claimed that he attempted to serve notice of the meeting to Claimants, while in fact he only
sent those notices to the Swiss address of Panoco SA, Swiss subsidiary of Pan Ocean that was
liquidated in 1995, and did not attempt to serve them at the registered offices of Claimants or
their counsel’s address, both known to him from other litigations.*° Respondent states that the
court was entitled to rely on Dr. Fadeyi’s statement that the notices were returned and points
out that the address of the notice was the same address as listed on the annual returns of Pan

Ocean, attached to the CAC Report of April 2005.°°

On 19 January 2006, again in the absence of Claimants, an ordinary resolution was passed
through which Dr. Fadeyi appointed his associates Justice Duro Adebiyi and Alhaji

Muhammed Dikko Yusuf as Directors and the share allocation was effected.*”

The decision of 8 February 2006 of the Federal High Court of Abuja validated the resolutions
passed by Dr. Fadeyi.** On 8 February 2006, the CAC accepted and endorsed the registered
filing of new shares purporting to represent 75% of the participating interest in OML 98 to Dr.
Fadeyi, thus effecting the surrender of Pan Ocean shares and thus an alienation of the majority
part of Claimants’ 40% interest in the joint venture, based on the false assertion that Claimants
were nowhere to be found, were non-responsive, or were not interested in the General Meeting
of Pan Ocean.*? Claimants state that, unlike in the prior transfer, Respondent did not provide
the required written consent to this transfer as required under Nigerian Law, but continues to
give legal effect to it.’ Claimants filed an appeal on 4 April 2006, which the Court of Appeal

of Abuja dismissed as untimely.*!

Mrs. Timolini waived her interest in Impex in 2010 in order to facilitate her children’s

obtaining Letters of Administration. A Letter of Administration of the Estate of Vittorio Fabbri

1,2

was granted on 23 August 201 She resigned as Director and President of Claimant

companies on 31 January 2013.%

On 9 October 2012, 29 October 2012, and 21 March 2013, Claimants wrote to Respondent
seeking a resolution of their claims and demands. Respondent did not reply to these letters and

disputes whether they were even delivered.

Although Claimants have lost control of their investment, that loss does not in itself give rise
to international liability. Accepting the facts as pleaded by Claimants, one sees a story of

someone (Dr. Fabbri) who gave his ex-wife a company in January 1998, but told no one else

except one of their children. Dr. Fabbri continued to act as if this exchange had not occurred
and then, months later, even made an agreement with the Nigerian government to the effect

that the very same company would pay a nearly half billion dollar debt, starting in 2002.°°

When Dr. Fabbri died intestate weeks later, his children and ex-wife would be forced to spend
over two decades trying to establish their ownership of the company and to wrest control of

the company back from Dr. Fadeyi.®

B. Summary of Relief Requested

In their Memorial on the Merits,°’ Claimants made the following request for relief, which

amended and supplemented their prior request contained in their Request for Arbitration:

Claimants under Nigerian law and/or international law;

purported transfer or acquisition of the 100% interest of the
Claimants, or any part thereof in 40% of OML 98/OPL 275 or
any other asset, or its accumulated proceeds howsoever
executed through the Respondent’s instrumentalities without
the consent of the Claimants and in breach of Nigerian law, is
an indirect expropriation of its participating interest in the
leases in violation of NIPCA and Nigerian Law;

4. Finding that as matter of Nigerian and/or international law, the
acts and/or omissions of the Respondent (as particularised
above) amount to a breach of the Respondent’s duty to ensure

Til. Procedural History

A. Introduction

45. This arbitration is between Interocean Oil Development Company and Interocean Oil
Exploration Company as Claimants and Federal Republic of Nigeria as Respondent. Their
dispute is brought before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes
(“ICSID”), under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and
Nationals of Other States dated 18 March 1965 (“ICSID Convention”) and the Nigerian

Investment Promotion Commission Act (“NIPC Act”).

46. Claimants filed their RfA, dated 30 July 2013, with ICSID pursuant to Article 36 of the ICSID
Convention in electronic copy on 31 July 2013 and in hard copy on 5 August 2013. In the RfA,

Claimants requested that the Tribunal render an award:

“a) Declaring that Respondent has breached its obligations to the
Claimants under NIPC [Act];

b) Directing the Respondent to restore only the nominees of the Claimants
as representatives in the 40 % participating interest under the operations of
all Joint Venture Agreements and in particular OML 98 and OPL 275;

c) Finding that any purported transfer or acquisition of the 100% interest
of the Claimants or any part thereof in 40% of OML 98/OPL 275 or any
other asset including its accumulated proceeds howsoever without the
consent of the Claimants is an indirect expropriation of its participating
interest in the leases;

14

wo

d) Directing the Respondent, its relevant privies and instrumentalities to
pay damages in an amount to be proven at the hearing but which the
Claimants presently estimate to be in excess of $500,000,000 (Five
Hundred Million United States Dollars);

e) Directing the Respondent, its relevant privies and instrumentalities to
pay aggravated damages in the sum of $150,000,000 (One Hundred and
Fifty Million United States Dollars) or such amount as may be proven by
the Claimants at the hearing;

f) Restitution of the undiluted 40% participating interest in OML 98 and
OPL 275 and all monies accruing thereto, by receiving the proceeds of
unjust enrichment controlled in trust for the Claimants to date;

g) Directing that the Claimants be reinstated as the beneficial owner of the
40% participating interest in OML 98;

h) Directing the Respondent to pay the Claimants’ interest and taxes on all
sums awarded;

i) Directing the Respondents to pay the Claimants’ costs associated with
these proceedings including professional fees and disbursements on a full
indemnity basis; and

j) Ordering such further or other relief(s) as the Tribunal deems
appropriate in the circumstances.”

On 12 August 2013, the ICSID Secretariat responded to Claimants and asked that Claimants

answer several questions prior to registration of the RfA.
On 19 August 2013, Claimants responded to the Secretariat.

On 9 September 2013, the Secretary-General of the Centre registered the RfA pursuant to
Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention.

. Constitution of Tribunal

On 11 November 2013, Claimants requested that the Arbitral Tribunal be constituted pursuant
to the formula provided by Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. On 9 December 2013,

Professor Julian D. M. Lew, a national of the United Kingdom, accepted his appointment as

15

Sl.

52.

53.

arbitrator appointed by Claimants, and Justice Edward Torgbor, a national of the United

Kingdom and Ghana, accepted his appointment as arbitrator appointed by Respondent.

On 11 December 2013, Professor William W. Park, a national of the United States and
Switzerland, accepted his appointment as President of the Tribunal appointed by the Parties.
The Tribunal in ICSID Case No. ARB/13/20 was constituted on 11 December 2013 in
accordance with Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.

C.. First Session and Initial Order

On 13 February 2014, the Tribunal and the Parties held a first session at the World Bank office
in Paris. During that session, the Parties agreed on procedural issues and addressed outstanding

issues that are outlined in more detail below.

On 27 February 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 containing a schedule of
submissions on the following preliminary objections raised by Respondent, as set forth in its

Section 14:

“14.1.1. Respondent did not consent to submit this dispute to arbitration
by ICSID [“Objection 1”);

14.1.2. Section 26 of the Nigerian Investment Protection Commission Act
(“NIPC”) does not provide a basis for finding consent on the part of
Respondent as it merely provides that disputes should be conducted in
accordance with the ICSID Rules [“Objection 2”);

14.1.3. Claimants are not registered with the NIPC and therefore cannot
rely on Section 26(3) of the NIPC Act to invoke the jurisdiction of ICSID,
and Claimants misled the Secretariat of ICSID to register their Request for
Arbitration when they falsely claimed that their enterprise was registered
with the NIPC. Pleadings on this objection shall be limited to whether
Claimants are registered and the bearing of registration on the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction [Objection 3”);

14.1.4. Respondent is not a competent party to this arbitration. Claimants’
pleadings on this objection should identify the law and legal authorities on
which they intend to rely and the corresponding liability of Respondent
[Objection 4”];

54.

55.

56.

57.

58.

14.1.5. Claimants’ claims are barred by statute [“Objection 5”]; and

14.1.6. The request is premature in that Claimants failed to explore local
remedies/conditions precedent contained in the NIPC Act [“Objection 6”).

On 29 October 2014, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Preliminary Objections, deciding

that:

Objection 1 (Consent) is rejected insofar as it calls into question whether
Section 26 of the NIPC Act constitutes a standing offer to arbitrate. The
Tribunal finds that Section 26 does indeed constitute such a standing offer.
However, questions related to the adequacy of the Claimants’ acceptance
of that offer are joined to the merits;

Objections 2 (Role of the ICSID Rules), 4 (Proper Party) and 5 (Time
Bars) are rejected; and

Objections 3 (Registration) and 6 (Premature Filing) are joined to the
merits.

Jurisdiction

A. Overview

The Tribunal recalls that Claimants invoked the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, pursuant to the ICSID

Rules, based upon Section 26 of the NIPC Act, set forth as follows:

Dispute settlement procedures

25

(1) Where a dispute arises between an investor an any Government of the

Federation in respect of an enterprise, all efforts shall be made through mutual

discussion to reach an amicable settlement.

(2) Any dispute between an investor and any Government of the Federation in

respect of an enterprise to which this Act applies which is not amicably settled

through mutual discussions, may be submitted at the option of the aggrieved party

to arbitration as follows—

(a) In the case of a Nigerian investor, in accordance with the rules of procedure
for arbitration as specified in the Arbitration and Conciliation Act; or

(b) In the case of a foreign investor, within the framework of any bilateral or
multilateral agreement on investment protection to which the Federal
Government and the country of which the investor is a national are parties;
or

(c) In accordance with any other national or international machinery for the
settlement of investment disputes agreed on by the parties.

(3) Where in respect of a dispute, there is disagreement between the investor and

the Federal Government as to the method of dispute settlement to be adopted, the

International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes Rules shall apply.

100. With respect to its jurisdictional determination, the Tribunal’s Decision on Preliminary
Objections of 29 October 2014 rejected three of Respondent’s preliminary jurisdictional

objections, summarized in Section 14 of Procedural Order No. | as follows:

“14.1.1. Respondent did not consent to submit this dispute to arbitration
by ICSID [Objection 1 (Consent)];

14.1.2. Section 26 of the Nigerian Investment Protection Commission Act
(“NIPC”) does not provide a basis for finding consent on the part of
Respondent as it merely provides that disputes should be conducted in
accordance with the ICSID Rules [Objection 2 (Role of the ICSID
Rules)];

14.1.3. Claimants are not registered with the NIPC and therefore cannot
rely on Section 26(3) of the NIPC Act to invoke the jurisdiction of ICISD,
and Claimants misled the Secretariat of ICSID to register their Request for
Arbitration when they falsely claimed that their enterprise was registered
with the NIPC. Pleadings on this objection shall be limited to whether
Claimants are registered and the bearing of registration on the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction [Objection 3 (Registration)];

14.1.4. Respondent is not a competent party to this arbitration. Claimants’
pleadings on this objection should identify the law and legal authorities on
which they intend to rely and the corresponding liability of Respondent
[Objection 4 (Proper Party)];

26

101.

102.

103.

104.

14.1.5. Claimants’ claims are barred by statute [Objection 5 (Time Bars)];
and

14.1.6. The request is premature in that Claimants failed to explore local
remedies/conditions precedent contained in the NIPC Act [Objection 6
(Premature Filing)].

Objection 1 (Consent) was rejected insofar as it called into question whether Section 26 of the
NIPC Act constituted a standing offer to arbitrate. The Tribunal recalls that Section 26(3) of
the NIPC Act provides that where disagreement exists between the investor and the Federal
Government as to the method of dispute settlement, the ICSID Rules shall apply. The Tribunal
found that Section 26 did indeed constitute such a standing offer to arbitrate under the ICSID
Rules.

Questions related to the adequacy of Claimants’ acceptance of that offer were joined to the
merits. In this connection, the Tribunal notes that the adequacy of Claimants’ acceptance of
Respondent’s offer to arbitrate under the ICSID Rules (such as to meet the conditions set by
the NIPC Act) intertwines with questions of registration and premature filing,’! each of which

formed an independently articulated objection to jurisdiction, as noted below.

The Tribunal joined to the merits of the case two other objections: Objection No. 3 related to

Registration under the NIPC Act and Objection No. 6 related to Premature Filing of the Claims.

Consequently, following the 2014 Jurisdictional Decision,” the Tribunal was left with
jurisdictional objections related to: (i) the adequacy of Claimants’ acceptance of Respondent’s
standing offer to arbitrate under the NIPC Act (Objection 1), (ii) registration requirements for
an enterprise under the NIPC Act (Objection 3), and (iii) premature filing of Claims (Objection
6),”> with the first objection (adequacy of acceptance) implicating both registration and

timeliness of filing.

The Tribunal has noted Respondent’s objections related to the Decision on Preliminary
Objections” and responds that each Party presented further arguments and provided additional

evidence related to the remaining objections in their subsequent pleadings.

The jurisdictional landscape became more complex after Respondent’s Counter-Memorial (17
November 2015), which raised jurisdictional objections related to: (i) whether some of
Claimants’ claims fall outside the scope of the NIPC Act and, therefore, are not covered by
any consent to arbitration contained in Section 26 of the NIPC Act;”° and (ii) whether claims
in respect of the actions of private individuals, and their alleged violations of Claimants’ rights,

are attributable to Respondent.”

Subject to the comments below on “Further Jurisdictional Objections” (infra) the Tribunal has
grouped Respondent’s challenges to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction into five (5) bases, some of
which overlap: (i) the adequacy of acceptance of Respondent’s offer to arbitrate under the
NIPC Act, which implicates registration and premature filing; (ii) Pan Ocean’s lack of
registration under the NIPC Act; (iii) the premature nature of the filing of claims, due to
Claimants’ alleged failure to seek amicable settlement; (iv) whether the scope of consent to
ICSID arbitration under the NIPC Act includes expropriation claims and claims based on

customary international law, and (v) attribution to Respondent of actions of private individuals.

. Jurisdictional Objections
(1) Existence of Dispute

Respondent has alleged that none of the three preconditions to the applicability of the ICSID
Convention and the ICSID Rules apply and, thus, the Tribunal cannot have jurisdiction. The
three conditions are: (i) there must be a dispute, (ii) the Parties were unable to settle the dispute
by way of mutual discussion, and (iii) there must be disagreement between the investor and
Respondent regarding the method of dispute resolution. As to points (ii) and (iii) (and other

aspects of the adequacy of Claimants’ acceptance of the offer to arbitrate) the Tribunal

addresses the relevant contentions through its separate analysis of Registration and Premature

Filing.”

109. In this section, the Tribunal explores the existence of a dispute. The Parties agree that Section

26 of the NIPC Act places upon Claimants the burden of establishing, at the outset, that there
is a legal dispute between Respondent and the alleged investor, here, Claimants.”* Respondent

has argued that there was no legal dispute between Claimants and Respondent.”

110. Claimants have responded that they are in a dispute with Respondent involving the protection

111.

112.

of their investment in Nigeria.*° The Tribunal noted in its Decision on Jurisdiction that it has
jurisdiction over the dispute, so long as that is in relation to Claimants’ allegations of a
violation of international law.*! Insofar as Claimants complain to have had their rights violated
by Respondent and Respondent denies this, there is a dispute between the Parties that can

support a claim.*?

The Tribunal has found that it does not have jurisdiction over Claimants’ contractual claims,
although they might form part of the factual matrix to be considered in relation to Claimants’
arguments about violations of international law.*? The Tribunal affirms its findings in
paragraphs 112 and 115 of the Decision on Preliminary Objections, that this dispute involves
Claimants’ allegation that Respondent conspired to seize ownership and control of Pan Ocean

from Claimants.

To the extent that Respondent has alleged that Claimants’ failure to exhaust domestic remedies
precludes this Tribunal’s jurisdiction, the Tribunal notes that a jurisdictional requirement of

exhaustion need not be implied into Article 26 of the NIPC.

(2) Registration of Pan Ocean as a Jurisdictional Pre-Requisite
a. The Parties’ Positions

i. Respondent’s Objection

Respondent asserts that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over this dispute because
neither Claimants nor their purported investment vehicle, Pan Ocean, are registered with the
NIPC as required by the NIPC Act, and therefore cannot rely on Section 26(3) of the NIPC
Act.*4 In Respondent’s words, “Pan Ocean’s lack of registration under the NIPC Act prevents

the Claimants from properly accepting any offer to arbitrate under the Act.”*>

Section 26 of the NIPC Act allows investors to submit to arbitration only disputes “in respect
of an enterprise” to which the Act applies,*® and the definition of “enterprise” under Section
31 “establishes that ‘where there is foreign participation’ only industries, projects,
undertakings or businesses that are ‘duly registered with the [NIPC]’ may qualify as an
‘enterprise’ under the NIPC Act.”*” Thus, since Pan Ocean is not duly registered with the
NIPC, it does not qualify as an “enterprise” under the NIPC Act. Therefore, the “remedies and
standards of treatment offered in the NIPC Act do not apply to Pan Ocean and cannot be
invoked by Claimants.”** Further, since Section 31 of the NIPC Act requires local companies
with foreign participation to be registered with the NIPC, Pan Ocean’s lack of registration
would entail that it cannot be considered as a national of another Contracting State, including

for the purpose of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.”

116. Respondent contends that the registration requirement applies to entities existing before the

entry into force of the NIPC Act. Respondent rejects the interpretation of Sections 19 and 20
of the NIPC Act proposed by Claimants. First, Respondent distinguishes between the
requirements that companies must meet to carry on business, governed by Sections 19 and 20,
and the possibility to resort to arbitration provided for in Section 26 of the NIPC Act, to which
the definition of “enterprise” contained in Section 31 of the NIPC Act applies.®” Second,
Respondent argues that, even if Section 20 of the NIPC Act was considered to apply only to
companies commencing business after its enactment, such pre-existing companies wishing to
benefit from provisions of the NIPC Act must still register with the NIPC.°! As for the
“grandfather clause” in Section 29 of the NIPC Act, Respondent contends that the provision
only applies to approvals granted and not to registration. In any case, there is no evidence that
Pan Ocean was granted any approval under previous statutes.°* Moreover, if the registration
requirement does not apply to pre-existing companies, “that must necessarily entail that the

NIPC Act is not applicable to those entities.”*

117. Respondent argues that Claimants have failed to provide evidence that the registers were

118.

unreliable. In any case, “the reliability of the registry is irrelevant because the Claimants have
not proven that they ever requested that Pan Ocean be registered.”** The procedure to register
a company is straightforward and Claimants bear the burden of proving any shortcoming on
the part of the NIPC. Here, Claimants have failed to prove that they attempted to file an

application or even communicate about the issue with Pan Ocean.°°

Respondent further argues that Claimants have failed to demonstrate how any act attributable

to Respondent would have prevented them from fulfilling the registration requirement” or that

they ever instructed Pan Ocean’s management to comply with the requirement.*” Claimants

bore the responsibility of ensuring that Pan Ocean, the purported vehicle of their investment in
Nigeria, was duly registered with the NIPC.°* According to Respondent, the registration
requirement arose in 1995 when the NIPC Act was enacted, and even if Claimants lost control
of Pan Ocean in 1998 as they claim, they should have ensured that Pan Ocean was registered

in the intervening period between 1995 and 1998.°°

119. In these proceedings, Respondent contends that Claimants falsely represented that Pan Ocean

was registered and have since admitted that Pan Ocean was not registered.!°’ Claimants’
alternative argument that they genuinely believed that Pan Ocean would have complied with
the registration requirements “confirms that the Claimants themselves undertook no measures

to ensure that Pan Ocean was registered since the entry into force of the NIPC Act.”!!

120. At the Continued Hearing of 19 July 2017, the Tribunal admitted into the record, without any

121.

determination as to its probative value, a letter from the NIPC to the firm Ajumogobia & Okeke
dated 26 September 2016, which confirmed that Pan Ocean is not registered, and
acknowledged receipt of two letters of 2012 and 2013 inquiring about the status of the
company.!°? At most, the letter shows that Claimants made inquiries about whether Pan Ocean
was registered. These inquiries, however, do not satisfy the registration requirement.!°
Moreover, any delay in responding to that inquiry is irrelevant, because Claimants could have
verified their registration status by sending one of their representatives to the relevant

registry.!%

Finally, Respondent submits that the concepts of estoppel and acquiescence cannot be used to

broaden the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.!°° Claimants failed to demonstrate how the joint venture

operations between NNPC and Pan Ocean would amount to acquiescence, and did not establish
how NNPC’s actions would have caused Claimants’ alleged detrimental reliance. !°° Moreover,
Respondent contends that NNPC’s alleged acts or omissions do not constitute “acts of State

by the Respondent.”!°”

122. Respondent has also submitted that Claimants misled the Secretariat of ICSID to register the

123.

Request for Arbitration by falsely claiming that the enterprise was registered with the NIPC.

It has urged the Tribunal to refuse jurisdiction on that basis.!°*
ii. | Claimants’ Position

Claimants reject Respondent’s contention that an enterprise with foreign participation must be
registered to benefit from protection under the NIPC Act in all cases. The stated purpose of the
NIPC Act is to encourage and assist investment in Nigeria and to create a conducive
environment for the same.!°° These aims would be undermined if foreign investors were denied

protections under the NIPC Act simply because they failed to register their “enterprise.”

124. Claimants observe that the definition of “enterprise” as being “duly registered with the

Commission” in Section 31 of the NIPC Act is subject to the qualification “[iJ]n this Act, unless
the context otherwise requires.”!!° The relevant “context” here is that Claimants made a long-
standing, significant, and successful investment in Nigeria in partnership with Respondent and
that this investment benefitted Respondent.'!' Claimants, thus, should not be automatically
deprived of the protections of the NIPC Act for the simple reason that the enterprise was not

registered. By insisting on registration, Respondent is relying on an artificial technicality, while

Pan Ocean complied “in every way with any reasonable categorisation of an investment.”!!?

In any event, Pan Ocean is exempt from the registration requirement because the NIPC Act
does not state that enterprises existing before its enactment, including Pan Ocean, must be
registered. '!> Other investment instruments entered into by Nigeria contain language providing
for retroactive application, and this suggests that Nigeria would have done the same in the
NIPC Acct if that was its intention.''* In the alternative, the absence of such language presents
an ambiguity that should be resolved in favor of foreign investors, in light of the stated purpose

of the NIPC Act.!!5

Several provisions of the NIPC Act confirm that enterprises operating in Nigeria prior to 1995,
like Pan Ocean, were not required to register with the NIPC to be “enterprises” within the
meaning of NIPC Act and entitled to investment protections and guarantees.'!® The wording
of Sections 19 and 20 of the NIPC Act confirms that the duty to register does not apply to pre-
existing companies, as these sections provide that an enterprise in which “foreign participation
is permitted” shall not “commence” business unless it is incorporated or registered under the
Companies and Allied Matters Act 1990 (“CAMA”) (Section 19), and shall “before
commencing business, apply to the Commission for registration (Section 20).”!!7 This
interpretation “is reinforced by the documents required for registration which by their nature
relate to new businesses.”!!* Moreover, the “grandfather clause” contained in Section 29(2) of
the NIPC Act made registration unnecessary for existing businesses, which could continue to
rely on previous approvals obtained under the repealed legislation. !!° Finally, Claimants point

out that the NIPC Acct is unclear as to the legal effects of registration with the NIPC.!7°

Claimants also challenge the “reliability” or “comprehensiveness” of the registers produced by
Respondent.'?! Respondent provided two versions of the list of registered companies that are
inconsistent and contain errors and discrepancies. '*” The entries of one of the lists only started
in 2006, eleven years after the NIPC Act.!?3 Moreover, “missing from the register(s) are five
of the six other (Pan Ocean being the seventh) Joint Venture Partners (foreign investors) with
NNPC in Nigeria namely Shell, Mobil, Chevron, Elf and Texaco (in their own rights and/or
through their subsidiaries)”, which invested Nigeria prior to the establishment of the NIPC.!*
Respondent’s suggestion that all these entities could not claim the NIPC Act’s protections is
“jllusionary.”!?°

Claimants did not seek to mislead the ICSID Secretariat by stating that Pan Ocean had been
registered with the NIPC. They state that their requests for proof of registration from the NIPC
went unanswered and that they “genuinely believed that Pan Ocean would have registered its
undertaking with the Commission.”!”° Respondent, however, has an obligation under NIPC
Act to keep records of the companies to which it applies and to assist enterprises and foreign
investors. The failure to answer to Claimants’ inquiries as to registration confirms the
uncooperative attitude of Respondent and its instrumentalities.'*? Furthermore, Claimants

highlight that they have lost control over Pan Ocean and this left gaps in their knowledge. !7

Finally, Claimants argue that even if the Tribunal concluded that registration is a precondition
of consent, Respondent is estopped from raising that objection to jurisdiction. Respondent, by
operating as a joint venture partner with Pan Ocean, has not insisted that Pan Ocean be
registered even though Respondent’s own instrumentality “possesses and controls the

register.”!?° Since Respondent collaborated with those who control Pan Ocean and failed to

raise the lack of registration, it should be considered to have waived the registration

requirement or, as a matter of fairness, be estopped from relying on it.'°°

b. The Tribunal’s Analysis

There is no dispute as to whether Pan Ocean exists, although some uncertainty may exist
concerning whether Pan Ocean was registered pursuant to the NIPC Act, and what the legal

effect registration might be on Claimants’ claims.

In its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal found that the following matters were so

intertwined with the merits that they must be considered during the merits phase:
+ “The definition of ‘enterprise’;

+ Applicability of the registration requirement to entities existing before
enactment of the NIPC Act;

+ Reliability of the NIPC business register filed by the Respondent;

* The Claimants [sic] inability to register Pan Ocean, such inability
allegedly deriving in part from the Respondent’s actions, as well as the
fact that the Claimants are outside the management of the company; and

+ Estoppel based on the Respondent’s alleged lack of complaint about
registration during prior cooperation with the Claimants.” !*!

The issue before the Tribunal is not whether Pan Ocean was authorized to do business in
Nigeria or whether registration for that purpose was validly waived at the latest when NNPC
and Pan Ocean renewed the Joint Operating Agreement (“JOA”) in 2002. Rather, the first
jurisdictional issue is whether and how Nigeria limited its consent to arbitrate to those
enterprises that were registered and whether Pan Ocean’s lack of registration under the NIPC
Act robs this Tribunal of jurisdiction. Below, the Tribunal dismisses these objections because,

as envisioned within Section 31 of the NIPC Act’s definition of “enterprise” to which the NIPC

130 Claimants’ Reply 38.
'3! Decision on Preliminary Objections § 102.

133.

134.

Act applies, the context requires it. Sections 31 and 20 of the NIPC Act states in relevant

part: 132

31. Interpretation

In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires —

“enterprise” means an industry, project, undertaking or business to which
this Act applies or an expansion of that industry, undertaking, project or
business or any part of that industry, undertaking, project or business and,
where there is foreign participation, means such an enterprise duly
registered with the Commission; [...]

20. Registration of enterprise with the Commission

qd) An enterprise in which foreign participation is permitted under
section 17 of this Act shall, before commencing business, apply to the
Commission for registration. [...]

Respondent argues that Sections 20 and 31 of the NIPC Act, which evidence the obligation to
register, limit the consent to arbitration under Section 26 of the NIPC Act to those enterprises
with foreign participation that have been registered with the NIPC. Respondent states that Pan
Ocean is not registered with the NIPC and is, therefore, not “qualified for protection” under
the NIPC Act.'*3 Respondent argues that Claimants bore the responsibility of ensuring that Pan
Ocean was registered during the 3-year registration period, from 1995 — 1998 (during Dr.

Fabbri’s lifetime). '*+

According to Claimants, even if there had been no registration, Dr. Fabbri or the owners could
have applied to register Pan Ocean during the three-year grandfathering period. Had they done

so the business would have been registered. '*°

In the context of the present dispute, a lack of registration would not necessarily preclude the
Tribunal’s exercise of jurisdiction. The current claims relate to Respondent’s alleged failure
to protect Claimants’ investment in Nigeria in the circumstances of attempts by Dr. Fadeyi,

Managing Director of Pan Ocean, to wrest control of that company from its rightful owners.'°

In this context, it would be both unfair and illogical to decline jurisdiction on the basis of a
lack of registration. Here, the person responsible for failure of registration remains the same
person accused of orchestrating an expropriation.'*” An alleged wrongdoer’s behavior would

not normally nullify arbitral jurisdiction.

The Tribunal, therefore, dismisses this objection to jurisdiction related to a lack of registration,

and all claims and sub-claims related thereto, listed above in this section, are also dismissed. '**

The Tribunal has considered Respondent’s argument that Claimants’ case should be dismissed,
as a punitive measure, for Claimants’ alleged intentional misleading of the ICSID Secretariat

into registering the RfA.'*°

Respondent has provided no basis in law for such sanction. Further, there is no evidence of

any intent on the part of Claimants to mislead the ICSID Secretariat concerning Claimants’

'36 Decision on Preliminary Objections § 124.

137 Justice Torgbor does not share this finding for dismissing Respondent’s objection to jurisdiction in the context of
circumstances relating to Dr. Fadeyi’s attempts to wrest control of Pan Ocean from Claimants for the following
reasons:
(i) This restatement of the Parties’ dispute in paragraph 135 differs from its accurate statement in paragraphs
130 and 132 above.
(ii) The jurisdictional objection is raised not by Dr. Fadeyi the alleged wrongdoer but by Respondent exculpated
from wrong doing (paragraphs 296, 297, 310, 315, 323 and 332 below).
(iii) As the factual context in paragraphs 135 and 136 of the award for dismissing the objection relates to
Dr. Fadeyi and not Respondent, and Respondent was neither responsible for Fadeyi’s wrongdoing nor for
registering Pan Ocean or Claimants, the factual context for dismissing this jurisdictional objection with
reference to Dr. Fadeyi’s wrongdoing is not the statutory context envisaged by section 31 NIPC Act for
determining the legal effect of non-registration of Pan Ocean.

 

(iv) The Claimants’ admission of lack of registration under Section 26(3) NIPC Act disables them from properly
accepting the offer to arbitrate under the Act (Respondent’s Submission para 108 and Counter-memorial para
179).
138 Justice Torgbor differs from this conclusion for same reasons stated in footnote 135 above.

registration with NIPC. The Tribunal, therefore, declines to refuse jurisdiction on that basis

and makes no finding on whether Claimants have intentionally misled the ICSID Secretariat.

a. The Parties’ Positions

i. Respondent’s Objection

Respondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because Claimants did not comply with
the preconditions to arbitration contained in in Section 26 of the NIPC Act, which prevents

them from commencing arbitration in accordance with Section 26(3) of the NIPC Act.

First, contrary to what Claimants allege, there is no evidence of a scheduled meeting with the
Managing Director of the NNPC in November 2004. Regardless, such a meeting would not
be relevant because the purported purpose of the meeting was not to settle a dispute with
Respondent. '*° Respondent rejects Claimants’ contention that Respondent refused to meet with

Claimants’ representatives about the dispute in 2004.'4!

Respondent urges the Tribunal to reject tracking reports purportedly evidencing delivery
because those documents were not timely filed, and Claimants did not seek leave to introduce
them into evidence. '*? Respondent also argues that (i) there is no evidence that the Minister of
Petroleum Resources received the letters, (ii) Claimants have not evidenced that the recipients
identified in the tracking reports were officials of the Ministry of Petroleum Resources, and
(iii) there is no record of the tracking reports on the websites of the corresponding courier
companies. '*? Moreover, the letters allegedly sent between 9 October 2012 and 3 May 2013

were never received by the Ministry of Petroleum Resources and, regardless, should have been

addressed to the Attorney-General. These letters cannot evidence Claimants’ fulfilment of the

requirement to seek amicable settlement. '44

Second, Section 26(3) also imposes a separate requirement that the investor is only entitled to
resort to ICSID arbitration and the applicability of the ICSID Rules as a default position, in the
event of a dispute as to the method of dispute settlement to be adopted.'** As recognized by
Claimants as a condition precedent in their Points of Claim, there was no such disagreement

in this case.'*°

Third, Claimants made no attempt to amicably settle the dispute with Respondent as required
by Section 26(1) of the NIPC Act. The requirement to attempt to reach an amicable settlement
constitutes a condition precedent to the institution of arbitration proceedings. '*” Section 26(2)
should be interpreted as establishing that disputes may be submitted to arbitration only when
the obligation set out in Section 26(1) has been fulfilled.'** The purpose of this precondition
would be to give the parties the opportunity to address the dispute, engage in good faith
negotiations, and implement the internal processes to do so.'#? Respondent urges the Tribunal
to reject Claimants’ contention that the requirement should not be interpreted as mandatory
because, unlike other preconditions, it does not textually impose a “cooling-off’ or waiting

period. !*°
ii. | Claimants’ Position

Claimants argue that they have fully complied with the requirements under Section 26 and

were within their rights to commence this arbitration.

Respondent had knowledge of the dispute, and Claimants notified Respondent of the dispute

orally and in writing on numerous occasions. Claimants refer to four letters from Claimants’

evidence.!*! To evidence that these letters were received by Respondent, Claimants rely on the

formal tracking reports from the associated courier companies.
delivery invoices issued by the courier companies! as well as evidence refuting Respondent’s
argument that there is no record of the tracking reports on the websites of the courier

companies. '**

Concerning the requirement to seek amicable settlement, Section 26 of the NIPC Act should
not be interpreted as a mandatory jurisdictional precondition.'*> Unlike other statutes, this
provision does not contain preconditions such as “cooling-off’ or waiting periods for
commencing arbitration, which are commonly imposed in the event a settlement is not reached.
Moreover, even when these preconditions are imposed, they are interpreted by tribunals as

“procedural and directory [rather than] mandatory and jurisdictional.”!*°

Claimants contend that, since they lost control over Pan Ocean, they made genuine attempts to
reach an amicable settlement with Respondent.'*’ They allege that in 2004 representatives of
their interests scheduled a meeting with an advisor on petroleum matters to the then-President
of Nigeria to seek a settlement of the dispute. According to Claimants, the Presidential advisor
subsequently refused to meet with Claimants’ representatives, who had traveled from Geneva
to Abuja for the meeting.'** Furthermore, Claimants’ attorneys wrote two letters in October
2012 and one in March 2013 to the Minister for Petroleum Resources, exposing the issues
encountered in relation to their investment and demanding resolution of their claims, which
remained unanswered. '*? Claimants state that they had requested inter alia the statement of
affairs of the NNPC / Pan Ocean joint venture, including the volume of production for the

preceding ten years, and had demanded that Respondent (through NNPC) desist from dealing

with Dr. Fadeyi and his associates and refuse to give assent to any interest(s) other than that of

Claimants in relation to the 40% participating interest in OML 98.'°

b. The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Parties dispute whether amicable settlement discussions are a pre-condition to bringing

arbitration proceedings under Section 26(1) of the NIPC Act.

The factual record indicates that Claimants did seek amicable settlement of this dispute in 2012
and 2013, after Mrs. Timolini yielded her interest to Dr. Fabbri’s estate. Claimants cannot be

faulted for Respondent having ignored these communications. Thus, to the extent that any

requirement may exist, Claimants have fulfilled it.!°!

The dispute had been ongoing for years prior to Claimants’ filing of this claim in July 2013,

and the Parties have had every opportunity to attempt to resolve this dispute. !

Given the history of this matter, including the procedural history in this arbitration, it is
unlikely that further attempts at amicable settlement would have succeeded. Respondent’s
failure to reply to Claimants’ correspondence forms part of the disputed merits in this
arbitration. Claimants alleged that Respondent failed to protect their investment and/or
conspired to deprive Claimants of their investment.'®> The Tribunal cannot deny jurisdiction
in circumstances where one party appears to have been unwilling to entertain settlement or

where further attempts may have been futile. '*

160 Claimants’ Memorial § 14.2.

161 Justice Torgbor is persuaded by the uncontroverted factual evidence that the dispute had been ongoing for years
prior to the filing of this claim in July 2013 (paragraph 151 below), but with no clear evidence of the opportunities
offered by one Party and rejected by the other for amicable settlement, if that “Other Party” is the Respondent, as
distinct from Dr. Fadeyi.

16 Justice Torgbor accepts the evidence that the Claimants have litigated the dispute and activated sub-judice
principles that prevented the NNPC and the Minister of Petroleum to act as the Claimants wished. Professor
Omorogbe, Claimants’ expert witness evidence was that court actions would bar executive intervention and out of
court interventions (paragraph 329 below, and Continued Hearing Transcript Day 1, 301:19-22).

163 See infra paragraphs 323-332.
164 Justice Torgbor is persuaded by the uncontroverted evidence that Claimants themselves prevented their cases from
proceeding by discontinuing one, withdrawing an appeal, serially amending their filings and making an incompetent
application (paragraph 330 below). There is no evidence of a meeting in November 2004, between Claimants and
Respondent or of the Respondent’s refusal to negotiate an amicable settlement. Claimants’ invocation of the NNPC
Act and ICSID Rules is therefore not supported by their non-fulfillment of the requirements of those instruments.

42

153.

155.

Next, the Tribunal considers whether there must be disagreement between the investor and
Respondent over the mode of dispute resolution in order for the ICSID Rules to become

applicable under Article 26(3) of the NIPC Act.'®> This text is provided below:

(3) Where in respect of a dispute, there is disagreement between the
investor and the Federal Government as to the method of dispute
settlement to be adopted, the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes Rules shall apply.

In Claimants’ RfA, Claimants inserted the text “or inability to agree” in parentheses following
“disagreement”, to reflect the de facto position at the time of filing the RfA, referring to a lack
of consensus.'°° Respondent has argued that these two terms connote different factual
situations and that, owing to the absence of a disagreement (based on there having been no
opportunity to disagree), the ICSID Rules cannot apply.'®’ The Tribunal does not regard this
as an attempt to mislead ICSID into registering the RfA.'®* Further, having found that the
filing of the RfA was not premature, Claimants cannot be faulted for any alleged failure to
“attempt to agree on a dispute resolution mechanism”, as argued by Respondent. The Tribunal

agrees that this invocation of the ICSID Rules was proper. '©?

(4) Scope of the NIPC Act
a. The Parties’ Positions
i. Respondent’s Objections

Respondent contends that even if the Tribunal were to find that Claimants had accepted the
standing offer to arbitrate, their claims for indirect expropriation and violations of customary

international law fall outside the scope of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction because they are not

encompassed by Respondent’s consent to arbitration contained in Section 26 of the NIPC

‘Act.!7

Tribunals must verify whether the scope of consent is restricted in any way. In the present case,
consent is limited to the protections offered by the NIPC Act, which are exhaustively listed in
its Sections 24 and 25.'7! Section 25 of the NIPC Act does not provide protection against both
direct and indirect expropriation.'> According to Respondent, “Section 25 provides for
protection against direct expropriation only. The provision does not expressly refer to indirect
expropriation. Nor does it contain any of the language normally interpreted as implicitly
covering indirect expropriation. In particular, it does not refer to ‘measures equivalent to
expropriation’, a term which tribunals commonly understand to denote indirect
expropriation.” !7> Section 25(1)(b) of the NIPC Act does not refer to indirect expropriation,

174 Which would not be relevant

but rather to “circumstances of compelled transfer of assets
in the present case because Claimants remain in full possession of their original shareholding

in Pan Ocean.!75

The alleged violations of customary international law are excluded from the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction because they cannot be considered as claims under the NIPC Act. According to
Respondent, “[t]here is neither explicit nor implicit language in the NIPC Act that expands the
Act’s protection or its dispute resolution clause to breaches of customary international law.”!’°
Respondent rejects any interpretation of consent under the NIPC Act as including disputes
related to all breaches of Nigerian law, and states that, in any event, it was not established that
customary international law is part of Nigerian law.'’’ Moreover, there are no applicable
bilateral or multilateral agreements to which Nigeria and the United States are parties that

would contain other substantive protections.'’® Respondent also contends that Claimants

cannot rely on Article 42 of ICSID Convention to broaden the scope of the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction to include claims based on customary international law, because Article 42 only

concerns the rules applicable to the decision on the merits.!”

In addition, Claimants’ points of claim referring to the alleged unlawful detention of Mr. Rooks
and others would fall outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction both ratione materiae and ratione
temporis because the alleged events took place in 1987, and thus pre-date the enactment of the

NIPC Act.!8°

ii. | Claimants’ Position

Claimants urge the Tribunal to decline to hear this belated jurisdictional objection and, in the
alternative, request that the Tribunal join its discussion and consideration to the merits

phase. '*!

Claimants contend that the allegations of indirect expropriation fall within the jurisdiction of
the Tribunal. Section 25(1)(b) of the NIPC Act, establishing that no person owning a capital
of an enterprise should be compelled “by law” to surrender his interest in the capital to “any
other person”, provides for protection against indirect expropriation. '** They also contend that
it would be possible to rely on Section 25(1)(a) of the Act.'** Protections against expropriation
would be frustrated if forms of indirect expropriation were excluded from the prohibition on

such acts, !*4

Claimants assert that through inter alia the decisions of Respondent’s judiciary, they were

indeed compelled to surrender their interest in Pan Ocean to Dr. Fadeyi and his associates. '*>

The Tribunal has jurisdiction over claims based on international customary law. First,

according to Claimants, the present case should be distinguished from Tradex v. Albania, on

which Respondent relies, because Section 26 of the NIPC Act is not as narrowly phrased as
the dispute resolution clause examined in Tradex.'*® Second, the broad formulation of Section
26 of the NIPC Act, which also makes reference to disputes based on bilateral and multilateral
agreements, would imply that “breaches of international law are admissible.”'*” Moreover, “by
their very nature, the allegations against the State of denial of justice as a result of the actions
of the State’s courts give rise to a liability / State responsibility in customary international
law.”!*8 Finally, customary international law is part of Nigerian law, because Section 32 of the
Interpretation Act integrated into the Nigerian legal system the English common law, and the

latter includes customary international law.'*

b. The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal rejects Respondent’s contention that indirect expropriation and protections
afforded under customary international law are excluded from the protection offered under the
NIPC Act. As indicated in Professor Oditah’s report, there is nothing in the NIPC Act to
indicate that indirect or creeping expropriation is excluded from its scope, and such a narrow
and limited interpretation is unwarranted. Indeed, as argued, “it cannot have been the intention
of the Respondent to accord the investor important safeguards with the one hand but then take
them away with the other by permitting the same catastrophic state of affairs to be

accomplished indirectly [...].”!°°

Respondent’s contention that, pursuant to Section 26(1) of the NIPC Act, the Tribunal lacks
jurisdiction over claims based on customary international law must be rejected. The broadly
drafted language in Section 26 of the NIPC Act includes claims under customary international

law.

Where a dispute arises between an investor an any Government of
the Federation in respect of an enterprise, all efforts shall be made
through mutual discussion to reach an amicable settlement.

Any dispute between an investor and any Government of the
Federation in respect of an enterprise to which this Act applies
which is not amicably settled through mutual discussions, may be
submitted at the option of the aggrieved party to arbitration as
follows—

(a) In the case of a Nigerian investor, in accordance with the
tules of procedure for arbitration as specified in the
Arbitration and Conciliation Act; or

(b) In the case of a foreign investor, within the framework of
any bilateral or multilateral agreement on investment
protection to which the Federal Government and the
country of which the investor is a national are parties; or

(c) In accordance with any other national or international
machinery for the settlement of investment disputes agreed
on by the parties.

Where in respect of a dispute, there is disagreement between the
investor and the Federal Government as to the method of dispute
settlement to be adopted, the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes Rules shall apply.”

The Tribunal further notes that customary international law is part of the English common law
and that common law has been incorporated into Nigerian law by Section 32 of the Nigerian
Interpretation Act.'°! Thus customary international law has become part of Nigerian law,
applicable by Nigerian courts to the same extent as is common law. In this context, Claimants’

claims under international law are properly before this Tribunal.

191 See Second Expert Report of Professor Fidelis Oditah in § 33, opining English law was accepted into Nigerian
law by Section 32 of the Nigerian Interpretation Act 1964, to the extent that it is not inconsistent with Nigeria
legislation, as confirmed in the Nigerian Supreme Court decision in Ibidapo v. Lufthansa Airlines. The Second Expert
Report of Justice Emmanuel Ayoola (at {| 150-156) appears less forceful on this point, accepting that English law
becomes part of Nigerian law until changed by Nigerian legislation, but questioning whether that principle extends to
customary international law until the Nigerian Supreme Court so decides.

(5) Attribution to Respondent of Harm-Causing Acts
a. The Parties’ Positions
i. Respondent’s Position

Respondent contends that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to the extent that the alleged acts of

Dr. Fadeyi, even if causing damage to Claimants, were not attributable to Respondent. '°?

Section 25 of the NIPC Act does not protect against expropriation “by any person”, as
suggested by Claimants, but rather “by any Government of the Federation.”!*? Thus, in order

to apply the provision, the acts of private individuals must be attributable to the State. !°*

Claimants failed to prove that Dr. Fadeyi’s actions are “attributable to Respondent” within the
meaning of international law on state responsibility,!> nor have they shown that they were
victims of “miscarriage of justice or denial of due process” in relation to the court proceedings
in which they challenged Dr. Fadeyi’s actions. '°° Furthermore, several acts that allegedly
caused damages to Claimants only could have been undertaken by Pan Ocean’s

representatives, and not by Respondent’s representatives. !°”

Simply put, Dr. Fadeyi’s acts are not attributable to Respondent and Claimants have not shown
that he acted as an agent of Respondent.'** None of the principles codified in the International
Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts (“ILC
Articles”) would be applicable in this case.!°? First, Dr. Fadeyi was not an “organ” of
Respondent nor was he part of the “organization” of Respondent, as required by ILC Article
4.2 Second, his actions were not “related to the exercise of governmental authority”, nor was

he empowered by Nigerian law to exercise elements of governmental authority within the

meaning of ILC Article 5.7°! Finally, Claimants failed to prove that Dr. Fadeyi was acting as
an agent or “on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of’ Respondent, as required

by ILC Article 8.7

Pan Ocean’s role as “Operator” of the joint venture in charge of the day-to-day conduct of
operation does not entail that Dr. Fadeyi represented Respondent in the joint venture.?°° Even
assuming that it was the case, the representation would not go beyond the scope of Pan Ocean’s
role as Operator, and thus would not extend to the private dispute over Pan Ocean’s
management and control, which involves acts that do not pertain to the joint venture’s
authority.2°* Moreover, the joint venture exercises a commercial activity, which cannot be

considered an exercise of “governmental authority.”

In principle, state-controlled entities are considered as separate from the state, unless they
exercise elements of governmental authority within the meaning of ILC Article 5.7°° The
NNPC’s operation and its role and powers as described in the Nigerian legislation confirm that
the NNPC is a commercial entity that only engages in “private or commercial” activities.?°”
The alleged violations of Claimants’ rights by the NNPC would, therefore, not be attributable

to Respondent.”

ii. | Claimants’ Position

Claimants contend that relevant alleged acts were indeed attributable to Respondent.

First, the expression “by law” in Section 25(1)(b) of the NIPC Act refers to both legislative
acts and decisions by national courts.”°? Courts are organs of the state within the meaning of

ILC Article 4, and their acts are attributable to the state even when unlawful or contrary to

instructions (according to ILC Article 7).7!° The decision of the Federal High Court of Abuja
in the “2005 case” is therefore attributable to Respondent.7!!

Second, Claimants contend that certain actions of Dr. Fadeyi are attributable to Respondent

and engage its responsibility.7!”

According to Claimants, since Pan Ocean is the “Operator” of
OML 98, Dr. Fadeyi, as representative of Pan Ocean, also acted as a representative of the
NNPC/POOC joint venture.*!* For Claimants, “Dr. Festu Fadeyi’s refusal to respond to the
Claimants’ demands to restore control of the operator company [and] to provide joint operation

financial information to Claimants was an act attributable to the State.”?!4

Finally, both the NNPC and Ministry of Petroleum Resources failed to protect Claimants’
rights, thus triggering State responsibility.7!5 The NNPC is not merely a private entity or
commercial partner, as argued by Respondent, but rather a representative of Respondent in the
petroleum sector.?!° The NNPC is a statutory entity that is owned and controlled by
Respondent, and has the Minister of Petroleum as Chairman of the Board.?!’ The long title of
the NNPC Act states that the NNPC is “empowered to engage in all commercial activities
relating to the petroleum industry and to enforce all regulatory measure[s] to the general control
of the petroleum sector through its petroleum inspectorate department.”*!* Claimants contend
that the NNPC acted as an organ of the State, which had the duty to protect Claimants,!? and
for the purpose of attribution, it is irrelevant whether the conduct of an organ of the State is

b. The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal can have no jurisdiction over harms that are not attributable to Respondent. As
the Parties have also recognized, however, that analysis is based on the context of each event.
In the section on liability infra, the Tribunal’s presents its analysis of whether the alleged harms

should be considered attributable to Respondent.

(6) Further Jurisdictional Objections
a. The Tribunal’s Invitation for a List of Issues

On 14 May 2018, in Procedural Order No. 8, the Tribunal invited the Parties to consider
submitting a joint list of issues, with each side submitting its own list if agreement proved
elusive. Following an exchange which included exchanges between the Parties on 13 June
2018, an email to ICSID from Claimants on 19 June 2018, and a letter to ICSID from
Respondent on 29 June 2018, no lists were submitted until 18 January 2019, when Claimants

submitted a list.

The Tribunal renewed its invitation to Respondent to provide a list of its own, or to at least
comment on the list of issues submitted by Claimants. On 4 February 2019, Respondent
(through its representatives at the firm of Afe Babalola & Co, in a letter signed by Oluwasina
Ogungbade, Esq.) declined to comment on Claimants’ list of issues, or to provide any list of
issues from Respondent itself. That letter of 4 February 2019 stated inter alia that “it is not
for the Respondent to undertake the work of the Tribunal.” The letter continued with citation
to Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention (providing for awards to deal with every question
submitted to the Tribunal) and an admonition to the Tribunal on how its failures to consider
all issues might result in an “annullable error” under Article 52(1) which relates inter alia to

corruption, fundamental rules of procedure, and failure for an award to state reasons.

For the sake of good order, the Tribunal on 3 June 2019 confirmed through the Tribunal
Secretary that it had given Respondent an invitation to confirm its list of issues, and continued
that the Tribunal “would welcome a List from the Respondent should it now decide to submit

one.” No list was forthcoming.

184.

The Tribunal has been cautious to ascertain that no jurisdictional objection has been
overlooked. In reviewing the Parties’ submissions for additional matters that might be
characterized as jurisdictional objections, the Tribunal has identified the following two items
that arguably contained jurisdictional arguments, addressed below: one related to Mr. Rooks
and the other related to the nature of international law. For the avoidance of doubt, these will

be addressed here in connection with jurisdiction.

b. The Alleged Detention of Mr. Rooks

Claimants have submitted that the alleged unlawful detention of Mr. Rooks is an event that

t.°?! Claimants have

formed part of the alleged “creeping expropriation” of their investment
stated that the arrest and detention was a breach of the duty to provide full protection and

security under customary law to the foreign investor and its employees.”

Respondent does not admit that Mr. Rooks was detained in 1987. Respondent has alleged that
Claimants’ allegations in connection with the detention of Mr. Rooks and others fall outside
of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione temporis (taking place in 1987, 8 years before the NIPC
Act).?> Those actions, even if established, could not constitute a breach of the NIPC Act,
which was not in force at the time. Further, the alleged detention appears to be irrelevant to

Claimants’ claims in this arbitration.?”4

Respondent further states that Claimants have not requested that the Tribunal provide a
declaration that Respondent failed to provide full protection and security to Claimants’
investments. Claimants never provided any rebuttal to Respondent’s objection to the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction over Claimants’ claim regarding Mr. Rooks’s detention. Claimants’

customary law claims are, therefore, beyond the scope of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.?7>

The Tribunal found that it has jurisdiction over Claimants’ international law claims against

Respondent, without temporal restriction. The alleged detention of Mr. Rooks formed part of

Claimants’ allegations against Respondent. As indicated infra, the Tribunal has found that
Respondent bears no liability in respect of Claimants’ allegations. The Tribunal, therefore,
need not further delineate what jurisdiction, if any, it would have to resolve other claims

regarding Mr. Rooks.??°

c. Nature of International Law

In addition to Respondent’s objections to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over Claimants’ claims
based on customary international law, which the Tribunal has addressed supra, Respondent
has asked whether (i) fair and equitable treatment, (ii) full protection and security, and (iii)
denial of justice are standalone protections under customary international law.” Respondent
has asked whether Claimants’ claims under customary international law must be limited to the

minimum standard of treatment.”

The Tribunal has determined that under either interpretation of the scope and extent of that
customary law, the result of this award would be the same. The Tribunal does not find a breach
of customary international law. The alleged wrongdoings are not attributable to Respondent
or do not form part of a concerted effort involving Respondent to deprive Claimants of their
investment. This is true regardless of whether one examines the cited standards as protections
which standalone under customary international law. Consequently, the Tribunal need not
speculate in the form of dictum on the matter, given that Claimants’ claims fail under either

interpretation of scope of international law, as discussed infra.

Liability and Damages

A. Overview

Claimants allege that their investment in Nigeria has suffered difficulties since at least 1987,
when Respondent detained Mr. Rooks, one of their employees, for 5 months for reasons

disputed by the Parties. In 1998, the ultimate owner of Claimants’ investment, Dr. Fabbri, died

intestate and, according to Claimants, Dr. Fadeyi, the manager of Pan Ocean, seized on the

opportunity to steal the company. This alleged theft was later validated by Nigerian Courts.

188. Claimants allege that entities and individuals whose acts are attributable to Respondent

contributed to the illegal dilution and seizure of Claimants’ shareholding and control over Pan
Ocean, and thus of the 40% participating interest in OML 98 and OPL 275, through a series of
acts and omissions in violation of Claimants’ rights.?? As a consequence of this conduct,
Claimants have suffered a total loss of their investment and have been unable to receive profits

and dividends, which has resulted in in a total loss of their investment.?°°

189. Claimants contend that these acts and omissions are attributable to Respondent, which failed

190.

191.

to protect Claimants from adverse control of its 40% interest in OML 98 and OPL 275. They
argue that this failure constitutes violations of the provisions of the NIPC Act providing for
protections for foreign investors. Further or in the alternative, Claimants contend that

Respondent violated its duties and obligations under customary international law.”*!

Respondent argues that Claimants failed to demonstrate any violation of Respondent’s
obligations under the NIPC Act or under customary international law, as matters of fact and

law.232

Below, the Tribunal accepts that Claimants have been deprived of their investment in Nigeria
and of Pan Ocean. This loss alone, however, does not implicate international responsibility.
Rather, in order for this Tribunal to find that an expropriation has occurred, the actions alleged
must be attributable to Respondent. As indicated in the Decision on Preliminary Objections
(29 October 2014), if the alleged conspiracy involving Respondent is not established,
Claimants will be found to have filed unfounded claims.”** The determinative factual element

for whether Claimants’ loss is attributable to Respondent is the existence or extent of

cooperation and coordination between Respondent, its representatives and agencies, and Dr.

Fadeyi in respect of his actions in relation to Pan Ocean.

The Tribunal is not persuaded that Claimants’ loss is due to breaches of Nigerian law
(including customary international law) for which Respondent is responsible. Claimants have
presented insufficient evidence to show that Respondent coordinated with Dr. Fadeyi to
deprive Claimants of their investment. While the Tribunal can accept that Dr. Fadeyi, a long-
time employee of Pan Ocean, was the beneficiary and perhaps even the architect of an alleged
plan to deprive Claimants of their investment, it is Claimants’ own case that it was Dr. Fadeyi
who orchestrated the removal of directors and appointed new ones, including himself. He
issued new shares to new shareholders, including himself, and so has reduced Claimants from
sole to peripheral shareholders. No evidence demonstrates that Respondent cooperated or
coordinated with Dr. Fadeyi to achieve this result. Every role that Respondent has played in
Claimants’ story has been independent of Dr. Fadeyi. Accordingly, the Tribunal does not find

that there has been an expropriation.

. Legal Foundations to Expropriation Claims: The NIPC Act

This case is not based on a treaty, but rather on a domestic investment statute, the NIPC Act.
Below, the relevant provisions of the NIPC Act are summarized, followed by the Parties

arguments related to the interpretation the Tribunal should give to each provision.

(1) Statutory Provisions

“24. Investment guarantees, transfer of capital, profits and dividends

Subject to this section, a foreign investor in an enterprise to which this Act
applies shall be guaranteed unconditional transferability of funds through
an authorized dealer, in freely convertible currency, of —

(a) Dividends or profits (net of taxes) attributable to the investment

(b) Payments in respect of loan servicing where a foreign loan has
been obtained; and

55

(c) The remittance of proceeds (net of all taxes), and other obligations
in the event of a sale or liquidation of the enterprise or any interest
attributable to the investment

25. Guarantees against expropriation
(1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3) of this section —

(a) no enterprise shall be nationalized or expropriated by any
Government of the Federation; and

(b) no person who owns, whether wholly or in part, the capital of any
enterprise shall be compelled by law to surrender his interest in the
capital to any other person.

(2) There shall be no acquisition of an enterprise to which this Act applies
by the Federal Government, unless the acquisition is in the national
interest or for a public purpose and under a law which makes provision
for—

(a) payment of fair and adequate compensation; and

(b) a right of access to the courts for the determination of the investor’s
interest or right and the amount of compensation to which he is entitled.

(3) Any compensation payable under this section shall be paid without
undue delay, and authorization for its repatriation is convertible currency
shall where applicable, be issued.”

(2) The Parties’ Positions
a. Claimants’ Position

194. Claimants submit that the alleged Respondent’s acts and omissions amount to violations of the

investors’ protections provided for in Sections 24 and 25 of the NIPC Act.

i. Section 25(1)(a) of the NIPC Act

56

195.

196.

197.

198.

Claimants argue that the acts and omissions attributable to Respondent “have led to a state of
affairs tantamount to expropriation, in breach of the guarantee enshrined in Section 25(1)(a) of

the Act.”24

Pursuant to Section 25(1)(a) of the NIPC Act “no enterprise shall be nationalised or
expropriated by any Government of the Federation.”?** Section 25(1)(a) encompasses forms
of both direct and indirect expropriation. According to Claimants, this is confirmed by the
NIPC Act’s failure to expressly distinguish between the two categories, which would have
been done if the intention of the Legislator was to restrict its application.*° Moreover, this
broader interpretation is in line with the nature and purpose of the NIPC Act, as Respondent’s
intention could not have been to protect investors from direct expropriation, while permitting

indirect expropriation.?*”

Claimants define indirect expropriation as not involving “physical takings”, but “takings [...]
that [...] permanently destroy the economic value of the investment or deprive the owner of its

ability to manage, use or control its property in a meaningful way.”?°*

Claimants’ losses fall within the notion of “creeping expropriation”, a subcategory of
expropriation that “results in a deprivation of property or a loss of control but which occurs

gradually or in stages... it encapsulates the situation whereby a series of acts attributable to the

State over a period of time culminate in the expropriatory taking of such property.”?°?

Claimants also rely on the definition provided in Metalclad v. Mexico, which includes “[...]

covert or incidental interference with the use of property which has the effect of depriving the

owner, in whole or significant part, of the use or reasonably to be expected economic benefit

of property even if not necessarily to the obvious benefit of the host State.””4°

Claimants conclude that these definitions describe the gradual erosion or deprivation of their
legal rights and the losses suffered. >! The fact that there was not an actual “seizure”, and that
the investment was not transferred to the State but to a third party, is irrelevant.?*? Contrary to
what Respondent argues, Claimants’ claims are not simply about a dispute between private
parties, because the loss of Claimants’ investment would have not occurred without

Respondent’s acts and omissions, which have thus caused the loss or contributed to it.?“7

ii. Section 25(1)(b) of the NIPC Act

Section 25(1)(b) of the NIPC Act provides that “no person who owns, whether wholly or in
part, the capital of any enterprise shall be compelled by law to surrender his interest in the
capital to any other person.”*“+ According to Claimants, this provision encompasses “judicial
expropriation”, and would therefore be triggered by the 2005 and 2006 decisions of the Federal
High Court of Abuja.745

Claimants, relying on Rumeli v. Kazakhstan, argue that a court decision may amount to
expropriation attributable to the State, and that “it is a characteristic of judicial expropriation
that it is usually instigated by a private party for his own benefit, and not that of the State
[...]-’?4° According to Claimants, “it is irrelevant that the State itself in the 2005 case did not
actually take possession of Pan Ocean or the Claimants’ interests in it or otherwise benefit

from the taking. It lent itself to the taking by providing an unlawful and perverse mechanism

by which those interests were taken thereby depriving the Claimants of their investment as if
by decree. Consequently, this action by the Respondent qualifies as expropriation contrary to

section 25 of NIPC Act.”747

Claimants also contend that, once judicial expropriation is proven in circumstances such as the
one at issue, it is not necessary to establish that it amounts to a “denial of justice.”*4* This
would also entail that “exhaustion of local remedies does not constitute a substantive
requirement for a finding of expropriation by a court.” In any event, Claimants suggest that
the requirement of exhaustion of local remedies is not a rigid rule, and has been interpreted as
including balancing considerations as to whether the local remedy is reasonably incapable to
produce satisfactory reparation.*°° They also allege that there was no other realistic remedy for

them under Nigerian law.?°!

Claimants further submit that, without prejudice to their primary contention that judicial

expropriation does not need to be accompanied by denial of justice, the present case would

252

satisfy the latter test as well.*°* Denial of justice would include “‘a denial, unwarranted delay

or obstruction of access to courts, gross deficiency in the administration of judicial or remedial

process, failure to provide those guarantees which are generally considered indispensable in

the proper administration of justice, or a manifestly unjust judgment.”?>?

Claimants argue that the circumstances in which the issuance of shares was validated show
that the decision of Respondent’s court was “seriously defective procedurally and in breach of
the most basic tenets of fairness and natural justice.”*°+ According to Claimants, “[t]he court

could and should have protected the Claimants[’] investment by taking the simple step of

ensuring that they were on notice of the hearing and represented, or by insisting on the
participation of the CAC at any point in the process. It ought to have picked up the serious
defect in the procedure, namely that the Applicant who sought to have the shares allotment

validated, was also running the company on his own.”?°°

iii. Section 24 of the NIPC Act

Claimants argue that the deprivation of their rights also constitutes, a fortiori, a violation of
Section 24 of the NIPC Act, which provides for the unconditional transferability of funds,
including dividends or profits attributable to the investment.?*° According to Claimants, the
expropriation of their investment “has led directly to the inability to receive any dividends,

profits or other proceeds from their asset.”?>7

b. Respondent’s Position

Respondent argues that, even assuming that the Tribunal had jurisdiction over the
expropriation claim, Claimants failed to establish that Respondent expropriated Claimants’

investment, either directly or indirectly.**

To establish a violation of Section 25 of the NIPC Act, Claimants should prove that
Respondent: (i) “nationalised or expropriated Pan Ocean”, as required by Section 25(1)(a) of
the Act; or (ii) “compelled [the Claimants] by law to surrender [their] interest in [Pan Ocean]

to any another person”, as required by Section 25(1)(b) of the Act.

i. Section 25(1)(a) of the NIPC Act

Respondent argues that Pan Ocean was neither nationalized nor expropriated. First,
Respondent’s alleged conduct clearly do not amount to nationalization, which can be defined
as “large-scale takings of private property in all economic sectors, in an industry or on a sector-

specific basis” generally motivated by policy considerations, nor did Claimants attempt to

suggest that.?6° Second, Respondent states that expropriations, as “property-specific or

enterprise-specific takings”, can be divided in two categories: direct and indirect.7°!

209. As mentioned above, Respondent argues that only direct expropriation is covered by the NIPC

Act.?° However, Respondent submits that, in any event, Claimants’ claims based on either
direct or indirect expropriation, as well as their arguments on “judicial expropriation”, are

meritless.?%

210. With respect to direct expropriation, Respondent argues that it is well established in the

211.

jurisprudence of international arbitration tribunals that direct expropriation requires
“mandatory legal transfer of the title to the property or its outright physical seizure by the State
itself or by a State entity.”2°* Respondent contends that it is undisputed that it has not legally
or physically seized Claimants’ investment, as it did not take possession of Pan Ocean.?°
Moreover, it states that Claimants: (i) did not lose legal title of their investment, as they still
own the shares in Pan Ocean; (ii) did not hold a direct interest in the Joint Venture or its assets;
and (iii) cannot claim that they were deprived of a right to 100% of Pan Ocean’s participating
interest because “they never assumed more than 25% of the exposure or financial risk in Pan
Ocean.”?66

Respondent stresses that Claimants themselves and their expert admitted that Respondent’s
alleged acts and omissions cannot constitute direct expropriation.°’ Although the Reply
seemed to suggest the contrary, they did not provide any decision or legal authority supporting

their contention.?%

212. Regarding indirect expropriation, Respondent argues that Claimants failed to establish how the

213.

alleged measures would constitute indirect expropriation and to provide a rigorous analysis on
269

the applicable legal standards.
Indirect expropriation can be defined as “a measure or series of measures taken by a State that
have an effect equivalent to direct expropriation without formal transfer of title or outright
seizure.”?”° The guiding factors for determining its existence include the degree of interference
with the property right, the purpose and the context of the governmental measure, and its

interference with reasonable and investment-backed expectations.2”! According to

Respondent, this confirms that an essential feature of indirect expropriation is that it also

requires a substantial deprivation attributable to the State.”

214. Respondent argues that the general interpretation is that “only acts attributable to the host State

215.

acting in its sovereign capacity can amount to indirect expropriation”,”” and that “claimants
bear the burden of proving that there is a direct causal link between the State measures
complained of and the damages allegedly suffered.”?”* According to Respondent, Claimants

failed to prove these elements.

Respondent stresses that Claimants mostly complain about the conduct of Dr. Fadeyi, a private
actor whose actions are not attributable to Respondent.?’> Respondent further contends that

Claimants failed to establish a causal link between the alleged acts and omissions of

Respondent and Claimants’ alleged loss.”°

First, Respondent rejects Claimants’ contention that Respondent or the NNPC had a duty to
protect them, and argues that, even if such a duty was affirmed, the State’s failure to protect

from the behavior of a private party would not amount to indirect expropriation.?””

Second, Respondent submits that Claimants did not provide any evidence of the alleged

conspiracy between Dr. Fadeyi and Respondent.?”*

Third, Respondent denies that its liability for expropriation can be engaged because the NNPC
continued to deal with Dr. Fadeyi.2”? According to Respondent, the NNPC “was [only]
fulfilling its contractual obligations under the joint venture.”?*° Moreover, Respondent’s expert
Professor Atsegbua argues that: (i) nothing in the JOA imposed a duty or obligation on the
NNPC to make inquiries into Pan Ocean, (ii) “the NNPC was entitled under Nigerian law to
assume that Dr. Fadeyi was Pan Ocean’s legitimate representative”, and (iii) it would have

been inappropriate for the Nigerian government and the NNPC to intervene into a private

dispute that was pending before Nigerian courts or to meet Claimants’ demands.?*!

Furthermore, Respondent contends that, even assuming that the NNPC breached its obligations
by dealing with Dr. Fadeyi, “it is well established in investment treaty jurisprudence that

violations of contractual rights by a State or a State agency do not constitute an indirect

99282

expropriation unless procured by sovereign conduct. Claimants failed to argue and prove

that, in dealing with Pan Ocean, the NNPC was ever exercising sovereign authority, rather than

acting as a mere contractual party.”*>

Finally, Respondent argues that Claimants failed to point to any action of Respondent that

would amount to a “substantial deprivation” of their investment (nor could the notion of

284

“creeping expropriation” assist them).“°* According to Respondent, neither the Government

nor the other entities involved had the power or the right to intervene in a private dispute or to
set aside the court decisions on the matter. Moreover, Respondent argues that Claimants were
simply unable to defend their claims in a private dispute, but did not provide evidence of any
measure that would amount to an indirect “taking” of their rights, for the purpose of

establishing indirect expropriation.?°>

Regarding the allegations of “judicial expropriation”, Respondent contends that, since
Claimants were unable to substantiate their claims based on the notion of indirect
expropriation, they relied on the “unsound notion” of “judicial expropriation.”?°°

Respondent argues that, under both domestic law and international law, decisions of domestic
courts on allocation of rights cannot qualify as “takings” amounting to expropriation.?*” At the
international level, a sanction against a domestic judicial decision could only be obtained if it
amounts to a “denial of justice”, i.e. to a “[mJanifest injustice in the sense of a lack of due
process leading to an outcome which offends a sense of judicial propriety.”?** Otherwise,
international tribunals would become courts of appeal for domestic decisions that claimants
disagree with.?°°

According to Respondent, Claimants themselves acknowledged that the notion of “judicial
expropriation” is controversial. Respondent suggests that they relied on this theory because
they did not exhaust local remedies, which is required to establish a claim of denial of justice,
and because the NIPC Act only provides for protection against direct expropriation and free
transfer of capital, and does not extend to violations of customary international law, including

“denial of justice.”?°°

Respondent argues that the court’s decisions in 2005 and 2006, which authorized Pan Ocean’s
board meeting and the subsequent allotment of shares, were “procedurally just and reasonable
in the circumstances” and that, in any event, Claimants failed to pursue the available judicial
recourses to challenge them.”! Moreover, it stresses that those decisions did not extinguish

any of their rights.?°*

Finally, Respondent argues that Claimants relied on Saipem and other decisions that can be
characterized as “disguised denial of justice decisions.”*°? Moreover, according to Respondent,
some of the decisions mentioned by Claimants, such as Rumeli v. Kazakhstan and Sistem v.
Kyrgyz Republic, should be distinguished from the present case because they “involved
seriously egregious conduct on the part of the State that manifested itself in a Court decision.
In this sense, they are less about expropriation by the judiciary than expropriation by the
executive.””*4 Respondent contends that there is no evidence of such “egregious conduct” by
the executive, as the court’s decisions were independent and taken in good faith, and

Respondent did not even play a part in bringing the matter before the court.??°

ii. Section 25(1)(b) of the NIPC Act

Respondent contends that it did not operate any transfer of shares within the meaning of
Section 25(1)(b) of the NIPC Act, nor did it acquiesce or participate in the alleged dilution of

shares or surrender of interest operated by Dr. Fadeyi, a private individual.?°°

Moreover, Respondent argues that it cannot be held responsible for Claimants’ lack of success
in this dispute, which has been litigated for over a decade before Nigerian courts, given that
Respondent was never a party to the proceedings (except for the incidental naming of the

CAC), and it would have been inappropriate for it to interfere with those proceedings.?””

Finally, according to Respondent, Claimants failed to prove that they were treated unfairly by

Nigerian courts.7°°

Respondent concludes that Claimants failed to establish any violation of Section 25 of the
NIPC Act.” Furthermore, if they wanted to establish their expropriation claim, Claimants
would have also had to prove that the alleged measures failed to comply with Section 25(2) of
the NIPC Act, which provides for rights to adequate compensation and access to courts in case
of expropriation for national interest or for a public purpose.*° However, Claimants did not

present arguments on this point.*°!

Respondent rejects Claimants’ argument that the decisions of the Federal High Court of Abuja
in the “2005 Board Meeting Case” would also constitute a denial of justice. According to
Respondent, this claim should be dismissed because: (i) Claimants failed to “demonstrate that
the decisions they complain of were criticisable either from a procedural or a substantive point
of view, let alone that they amount to an outrage, bad faith or wilful neglect of duty”, thus
failing to meet the threshold for a finding of denial of justice; and (ii) Claimants failed to

exhaust local remedies in Nigeria.*°?

First, Respondent contends that the standard of proof to establish a denial of justice is high.
Respondent refers to different case-law definitions according to which a finding of denial of
justice requires evidence of an act of the judiciary “bereft of a basis in law”, or amounting to
“an outrage, bad faith, wilful neglect of duty, or insufficiency of actions apparent to any
unbiased man”, or to a “[m]anifest injustice in the sense of a lack of due process leading to an
outcome which offends a sense of judicial propriety.”*°> Moreover, Respondent states that the

possibility that courts of another jurisdiction would have held otherwise is irrelevant to this

kind of claim.*** Respondent stresses that, as Claimants seem to be aware of, “a finding of
denial of justice can only be established once the judicial system as a whole has been provided

the opportunity to correct any deficiencies but has failed to do so.”>°>

Claimants’ arguments on denial of justice were not substantiated by evidence. On the contrary,
the decisions at issue were procedurally fair and constituted reasonable applications of
Nigerian law, which is also confirmed by Respondent’s expert Justice Ayoola.*°° Claimants
thus failed to meet the high threshold for a finding of denial of justice, as they did not show
evidence that Nigerian courts breached any specific law nor that the decisions at issue would

amount to “outrage, bad faith or wilful neglect of duty.”>°”

Second, Claimants did not exhaust local remedies in relation to the decisions they complain
of, which is a prerequisite to a finding of denial of justice.*°* According to Respondent, “over
the course of the domestic proceedings, they repeatedly abandoned proceedings, failed to take
advantage of available remedies or failed to pursue avenues of appeal.”*” In particular, there
were multiple avenues available to attempt to reverse the decisions at issue, but Claimants
failed to pursue some of these avenues and, in the others, failed to comply with the applicable
procedural requirements.*!°

Furthermore, Respondent contends that Claimants failed to submit evidence to support their
argument that it would have been futile to pursue the remedies available to them.*!! Claimants’
expert Professor Oditah suggested that Claimants could not pursue certain remedies because

they did not comply with some procedural requirements, though “it should have been open to

However, according to
Respondent, Professor Oditah did not point to provisions or judicial precedents that would
have allowed Nigerian courts to do so.*!? Moreover, it stresses that these procedural rules are
“essential to the adequate functioning of any judicial system’, and reflect important due
process guarantees.*!+ Respondent insists that, even if Nigerian courts were particularly
formalistic, this would not amount to a denial of justice.*!> Finally, Respondent argues that, as
affirmed in Limited Liability Company Amto: “[t]he investor that fails to exercise his rights
within a legal system, or exercises its rights unwisely, cannot pass his own responsibility for
the outcome to the administration of justice, and from there to the host State in international

law.7316

iii, Section 24 of the NIPC Act

Respondent rejects Claimants’ interpretation of Section 24 of the NIPC Act. Based on Section
24 of the NIPC Act and on the definition of “authorized dealer” in Section 41 of the Act, it is
clear that Section 24 of the Act only provides for protection against eventual capital control
measures Respondent may impose, by guaranteeing “unconditional transferability of funds

through an authorised dealer.”*!”

234. Respondent submits that Claimants’ argument that Respondent was under an obligation to

guarantee the payment of “profits and dividends” by Pan Ocean is a misconstruction of Section
24 of the NIPC Act, which cannot be used to intervene in payment disputes between two

private parties.*!*

(3) The Tribunal’s Analysis

Claimants’ case is not that Respondent itself seized their investment. Rather, Claimants
contend “that acts or omissions attributable to [Respondent] have led to a state of affairs
tantamount to expropriation” and that this was in breach of the guarantee enshrined in Section
25 (1)(a) of the NIPC Act.*!? Respondent denies that there was any conspiracy and that it
played any role in the activities of Dr. Fadeyi designed to wrongly deprive Claimants of the
benefits of its ownership and to wrest control of Pan Ocean from Claimants. In the absence of
complicity by Respondent in the actions of Dr. Fadeyi or anyone else in any plan to deprive
the Fabbri family of its investment in Pan Ocean, this Tribunal cannot find Respondent liable

for an expropriation in violation of Section 25 of the NIPC Act.

Below, the Tribunal explains why the events giving rise to Claimants’ claims do not constitute
a violation of Section 24 or 25 of the NIPC Act and, accordingly, do not constitute direct or
indirect expropriations. The Tribunal considers allegations of violations of customary

international law separately, as necessary.

C. Events Giving Rise to Claim

In this section, the Tribunal summarizes the respective positions of the Parties as to the events
that led to this claim and, where in dispute, whether these events or activities are attributable
to Respondent and whether they amount to a violation of Respondent’s obligations. The
Tribunal’s findings as they relate to the arguments submitted and the claims raised, are

presented within the Tribunal’s analysis.
(1) The Parties’ Positions

a. Claimants’ Position

Claimants allege that several acts and omissions attributable to Respondent have caused or
have contributed to cause the “creeping expropriation” of their investment.*”° This conduct is

summarized as follows.

i. Alleged Arrest and Unlawful Detention of Claimants’ Representative

In 1987, Dr. Fabbri gave special powers of attorney to Mr. Rooks to review Pan Ocean’s affairs
and remove Dr. Fadeyi.*?! However, when Mr. Rooks went to Nigeria in 1987, he and his two
bodyguards were arrested by Nigerian State Security operatives and detained for at least 103

days or as much as five months.*”?

Charges were never filed and these individuals were never
informed of the reasons of their detention.*?? Mr. Rooks never again returned to Nigeria,
though he was a Director of Pan Ocean. Dr. Fabbri and his son also refrained to go back,
because Dr. Fadeyi convinced them that they would have been arrested too, while Dr. Fadeyi

himself never faced the same issues.**4

This unlawful detention was “oppressive, arbitrary and a serious breach of the most basic of

human rights”,>?°

and constituted a violation of Respondent’s duty to provide full protection
and security to foreign investors and their employees.*?° This intervention by Respondent

supported Dr. Fadeyi’s gradual gain of control over Pan Ocean.*?”

ii, NNPC’s Alleged Failure to Assist Claimants or Investigate

Claimants allege that their representatives made several attempts, most of which without
success, to contact the NNPC and receive guidance in relation to the change in Pan Ocean’s
beneficial ownership.*** At first, their inquiries were triggered by Dr. Fadeyi’s claim that they
had to seek the NNPC’s approval for the transfer of the beneficial ownership in Pan Ocean to
Mrs. Timolini.*?? Claimants finally received a short answer from the NNPC (signed by Chief.
Sena Anthony), affirming that they did not need NNPC’s consent, but advising that they seek

the consent of the Government and of the other shareholders.>*° This is how Claimants

discovered the first irregular issuance of shares by Dr. Fadeyi to a third person, Mr. Tomisin.**!
Further, in 2004, Mrs. Timolini and her son travelled to Nigeria to meet the Managing Director

of the NNPC, but the meeting never took place.?°”

Given the issues Claimants were raising, “it would have been obvious to the NNPC that there
was the real possibility that either it was dealing with the wrong people altogether, or at the
very least it was not dealing with everyone it ought to be in relation to the company”, with
potentially serious implications for both Claimants and the NNPC;?? and yet, “Respondent
produced no notes, memoranda, minutes, report, or record of enquiry showing that NNPC has

discussed, considered, or at least even enquired into this important issue [...].”>°4

Claimants’ expert Professor Omorogbe asserts that the correct approach by the NNPC would
have been to initiate an independent investigation.**> The NNPC should have at least searched
the company at the CAC. In March 2000, this search would have shown the irregular
distribution of shares to Mr. Tomisin and removal of Mr. Rooks as Director, and, in 2005, “the

fraud at the heart of the company, (including the forgery of [Mr.] Rooks’s signature).”>°°

iii. | Respondent’s Renewal of the Joint Operating Agreement (“JOA”)

Claimants allege that “notwithstanding the continuing enquiry and protestations on behalf of
the Claimants, in June 2002, the Respondent, (via NNPC), concluded a debt repayment
agreement with Dr Fadeyi without the consent of .Timolini or the Claimants, and on 28th May
2003 renewed the JOA with Pan Ocean.”**” The agreement, concluded without Claimants’
knowledge or consent, “imposed an obligation on the Claimants to pay the sum of US$

497,694,921 to the Respondent.”***

Claimants point to the witness statement of Mr. John Brunner, who declared that one of
NNPC’s legal officers told him that he had recommended that the NNPC not sign the JOA
because Dr. Fadeyi had not furnished a valid Pan Ocean’s board resolution authorizing him to
execute the agreement.**? This shows “internal tensions and precariousness of the NNPC’s
own position even whilst it was executing acts which directly interfered with and undermined

the rights of the true owners of Pan Ocean and 40% in OML98.”34°

iv. Respondent’s Alleged Failure to Scrutinize Pan Ocean Change of Control

Claimants submit that the new issuance and allotment of shares in 2005/06 by Dr. Fadeyi

required both ministerial and the NNPC’s consent.*"!

First, they contend that the requirement of the Minister’s consent is imposed by paragraph 14
of the First Schedule of the Petroleum Act, stating that “[w]ithout the prior written consent of
the Minister, the holder of an Oil Prospecting License shall not assign his license or lease or
any right power or interest therein or thereunder.”*4? Respondent’s expert’s contention that the
requirement did not apply to the allotment of shares at issue is incorrect.*#* The provision
includes changes of control in the company that holds the license or lease, and this has always
been the common interpretation and practice.*+ This is confirmed by the broad wording of
paragraph 14, by the policy rationale behind it (i.e. to allow the government to know and
approve its joint venture partners), and by paragraph 16 of the First Schedule of the Petroleum
Act, which sets out acceptability criteria for the potential assignees and gives the Minister wide

4345

discretion in this regar Moreover, the “Guidelines and Procedure for obtaining Minister’s

Consent” confirm that the term “assignment” includes “any transaction that may alter the

ownership, equity rights or interest of the assigning company in question.”*4° The requirement
of the government’s consent was also mentioned in the letter from Chief Sena Anthony of the

NNPC.347

As confirmed by a decision of the Federal High Court in the case Moni Pulo v. Brass
Exploration Nigeria Unlimited, the “statutory requirement makes any alienation of such right
or interest without the Minister’s consent void.”*4* According to Claimants, Respondent

“ought to have known that the purported alienation of a portion of the Claimants’ 40%

participating interest in OML 98 was unlawful and ought not to have been recognised.”*?

Second, Claimants contend that the NNPC’s consent was also required, given the formulation
of section 19.1.1. of the JOA between NNPC and Pan Ocean, which mirrors the requirement
of ministerial consent and states that: “no Party may assign or transfer its Participating Interests
or any part thereof or any right, power or interest therein or thereunder without the prior written

consent and approval of the other Party [...].”**° According to Claimants, if the NNPC had

scrutinized Pan Ocean’s situation, it would have denied its consent.**!

v. Federal High Court of Abuja 2005 and 2006 Decisions

Claimants contend that wrongful decisions of Respondent’s courts allowed Dr. Fadeyi to gain

control over Pan Ocean through an irregular issuance of shares and the consequent dilution of

the shares of Claimants.>>

On 24 November 2005, the Federal High Court of Abuja granted Dr. Fadeyi’s request
(presented on 21 November 2005) to hold a Board Meeting of Pan Ocean.**? Dr. Fadeyi’s

affidavit in support of the application stated that he remained the only Director given the
unavailability of Mr. Rooks, but failed to mention that the latter had left Nigeria after having
been freed from detention (in the circumstances described supra).*** Claimants submit that the
only parties to the application were Dr. Fadeyi and Pan Ocean, also represented by Dr.
Fadeyi.**> The interests of the shareholders were thus not represented, nor did they receive
notification of the application (which was, therefore, made ex parte).**° The CAC, which
months before had issued a report finding irregularities in Pan Ocean’s management, was not

joined as a party nor notified of the application.*°’

Claimants allege that the Board Meeting was held on 29 November 2005 and Dr. Fadeyi passed
resolutions “allotting the remaining 7,500 unissued shared of Pan Ocean to himself and his
associates.”*°* The shareholders were not present at the meeting, and there is no evidence they
were notified.*? According to Claimants, this allotment of shares was invalid.*° On 19
January 2006, Dr. Fadeyi passed an ordinary resolution ratifying the share allocation and
appointing his associates, Justice Duro Adebiyi and Alhaji Muhammed Dikko Yusuf, as
Directors.*°! Dr. Fadeyi claimed that he attempted to serve notice of the meeting to Claimants,
while in fact he only sent those notices to the Swiss address of Panoco SA, a Swiss subsidiary
of Pan Ocean that was liquidated in 1995. He did not attempt to serve them to the registered

offices of Claimants or their counsel’s address, both known to him from other litigations.*

Claimants argue that the decision of 8 February 2006 of the Federal High Court of Abuja,
which validated the resolutions passed by Dr. Fadeyi, “endorsed a fraudulent usurpation of
shareholders’ authority by the complete misapplication of section 123 of CAMA.°

validate improperly issued shares and that the Court did not have a duty to “dig deep for
facts.”>°* According to Claimants’ expert, Professor Oditah, Section 123 of the CAMA is only
meant to remedy procedural defects, such as failure to give notice to a shareholder, but “does
not enable a court to override substantive provisions such as division of powers between the

board and shareholders as reflected in section 124 of the same Act.”>°5

Claimants rely on Professor Oditah’s conclusion that “[i]t is difficult to see how the Judge
could have been ‘satisfied that in all the circumstances it is just and equitable’ to deprive the
Claimants of their ownership of Pan Ocean and turn them into a 25% minority on an application
of Dr Fadeyi, an employee of Pan Ocean, and to do so without asking for the CAC to be joined
as a Respondent and for the Claimants to be put on notice. The court in effect made sections
223 and 123 of CAMA substantive expropriatory provisions rather than purely procedural
provisions.”°°° According to Professor Oditah, “the decision in the 2005 Case is neither
procedurally fair, nor a reasonable application of Nigerian law”, and “falls far short of what
can be regarded, under any circumstances, as an acceptable standard of civil justice

administration.”>°7

vi. Failure to Act Upon CAC Findings or Investigate Alleged Criminal Acts Within Pan Ocean

Claimants submit that Respondent is responsible for the acts and omission of the CAC, which
is a State organ and statutory agency for regulating and administering companies.*** According
to Claimants, the CAC acted in an inconsistent, arbitrary, and non-transparent manner.*” The
CAC did not follow-up on its report that contained serious findings about Pan Ocean’s
management, nor did it impose penalties.*”° Moreover, despite its findings, the CAC registered

Pan Ocean’s new issue of shares to Dr. Fadeyi and his associates.*”!

Despite Claimants’ repeated grievances and the CAC’s serious findings, no criminal
investigation into Dr. Fadeyi’s conduct was ever initiated.*”” Claimants reject Respondent’s
argument that it was prevented from investigating because there were pending court

proceedings on the matter.>”°

vii. | Respondent’s Alleged Inaction or Facilitation of Dr. Fadeyi’s Actions

First, the fact that the numerous letters sent by Claimants to Respondent’s instrumentalities
remained unanswered and/or went missing, suggests a “deliberate and systematic cover-up”
that benefitted Dr. Fadeyi.*” In particular, Claimants draw the Tribunal’s attention to the letter
they received from the NIPC on 26 September 2016°”° regarding Pan Ocean’s registration
status, and which acknowledges the receipt of two letters, three and four years prior.*”°
Claimants also argue that the cross-examination of Mr. Khalid “exposed the fact that NNPC’s
register of correspondence received was not especially reliable [...]”, notably because it did

not include a letter Chief Sena Anthony admitted she received.*””

Second, Claimants allege that Dr. Fadeyi continued to present himself as representative of
Claimants in the operating committee of the Pan Ocean/NNPC Joint Venture and, despite their

numerous requests, Respondent did not desist from dealing with Dr. Fadeyi.*”

Finally, Claimants submit that: “[a]s the Respondent is 60% joint venture partners and host-
economy operators, it remains within the Respondents’ exclusive preserve to give effect to and
restore the Claimants’ access to and control of such information that is necessary to enjoy the
transfer of the proceeds of their investments. Since 1998 and to date, the Claimants have
continuously been denied information about or access to joint venture meetings or joint
operating committee deliberations and the accounting, financial, and business affairs or

production status of the joint venture operations; all of which constitute prerequisites of any

foreign investment decision to be made by the Claimants. No revenue, income, proceeds, or
profits whatsoever have been paid to the Claimants for their investments as a result of the

Respondent’s conduct from September 1998 and on-going to date.”>”

As mentioned above, Claimants argue that, as Dr. Fadeyi represented Pan Ocean, which is the
“Operator” of OML 98, he also acted as a representative of the NNPC/POOC joint venture.°*°
Consequently, some of his conduct would be attributable to Respondent and engage its
responsibility.**! In particular, according to Claimants, “[...] Fadeyi’s refusal to respond to the
Claimants’ demands to restore control of the operator company; to provide joint operation

financial information to Claimants was an act attributable to the state.”**?

b. Respondent’s Position

Respondent rejects the characterization of the facts put forward by Claimants. As a preliminary
remark, Respondent states that: “The Claimants filed this case on the basis of an alleged
collusion or conspiracy between the Respondent and Dr. Fadeyi to deprive the Claimants of
control over their investment. Having failed to obtain any evidence to support their false
accusation of collusion, the Claimants have presented an entirely new case in their Reply.”>*
Respondent also insists that Claimants’ dispute was always with Dr. Fadeyi, a private
individual, and that this was confirmed by Claimants’ witnesses at the hearing.*** In particular,
Respondent notes that the accusations presented at the hearing focused on Dr. Fadeyi gaining
control of the company and subsequently obstructing, retaining information and fraudulently
issuing shares; the “2004 Meeting” concerned Dr. Fadeyi’s actions, and not Respondent; and

“the Respondent never instituted an action against the Claimants.”**>

Respondent contends that it “did not have any responsibility under domestic or international

law to intervene in Pan Ocean’s internal dispute for control”, even more so because the same

264.

dispute was still being litigated before Nigerian courts.**° The main arguments in relation to

the conduct allegedly attributable to Respondent can be summarized as follows.

i. Alleged Arrest and Unlawful Detention of Claimants’ Representative

Claimants “failed to present any reliable evidence to support their accusations of unlawful
detention.”**” According to Respondent, they solely rely on a self-serving affidavit of Mr.
Rooks, which has limited probative value because Respondent did not have the opportunity to

cross-examine him.*88

Claimants failed to demonstrate any causal link between Mr. Rooks’s alleged unlawful
detention and Claimants’ loss of control over their investment (or their alleged damages).>*
Respondent stresses that, according to the affidavit of Mr. Rooks, he worked for the PANOCO
Group from 1985 to 1993 and, during the time of his employment, Dr. Fadeyi would regularly
meet with Mr. Fabbri in Switzerland to discuss Pan Ocean’s business affairs. The
correspondence between Dr. Fadeyi and representatives of the Fabbri family submitted by
Claimants would confirm that that family was in contact (and on apparent good terms) with
Dr. Fadeyi long after 1987, which means that Dr. Fabbri and/or Claimants’ representatives
“could have relieved Dr Fadeyi of his functions, either in person or through correspondence,

long after Mr Rooks’s alleged detention.”>°°

ii, NNPC’s Alleged Failure to Assist Claimants or Investigate

265.

consent was not required in case of change of Pan Ocean’s ultimate beneficial ownership.**
Moreover, according to Respondent, the NNPC was “under no obligation to acknowledge Ms
Timolini’s ownership”, as this recognition would have only served private purposes.*°? As
affirmed in his witness statement by Mr. Khalid, Deputy Manager of the NNPC’s Legal
Division, “the NNPC could not and would not interfere in a private dispute over control of Pan

Ocean since it has no power to do so under the JOA.”?

The fact that the NNPC continued to deal with the acknowledged representative of Pan Ocean’s
is not evidence of a “conspiracy.”*> To the contrary, “these continuing interactions between
the NNPC and existing Pan Ocean representatives were consistent with Nigerian law and the

NNPC’s general practice.”*°° According to Respondent, this was also confirmed by Claimants’

expert, Professor Omorogbe.**”

Under Nigerian company law, shareholders cannot purport to represent a company unless
specifically designated to do so. If issues arise in relation to the appointment of representatives,
the shareholders can exercise their powers under the company memorandum and articles of
association or, if they suspect improprieties, bring the dispute before domestic courts.*** Third
parties to a company, such as the NNPC in relation to Pan Ocean, can only validly interact
with the appointed representatives.*”? Moreover, they are entitled to assume that the
memorandum and articles of the company have been complied with, and that the company
representatives have been duly appointed and have the authority to perform their duties.*°° As

a practical matter, it is common practice for the NNPC to engage with the same people

representing its joint venture’s partners on a regular basis. The NNPC thus continued to deal
with Dr. Fadeyi in good faith and in accordance with this practice because, to its knowledge

and absent a court decision to the contrary, he was Pan Ocean’s legitimate representative.*”!

iii. | Respondent’s Renewal of the Joint Operating Agreement (“JOA”)

268. Respondent rejects Claimants’ contention that it was inappropriate for the NNPC to negotiate

with Dr. Fadeyi the agreement for the joint venture’s renewal.‘ On the contrary, the NNPC

concluded the 2002 JOA with Pan Ocean’s designated representative.*°

269. The division of roles contained in the 2002 JOA confirms that the NNPC should not be

considered as an agent of Respondent.*”* The JOA provides that Pan Ocean would represent
the joint venture in its relations with the government.**> This would not have been necessary

if the NNPC had been acting on behalf of the government.*°°

270. Finally, Respondent rejects Claimants’ argument that the clause of the JOA regarding

repayment of Pan Ocean’s debt would be evidence of either NNPC’s “self-dealing” or its
collusion with Dr. Fadeyi. As even Claimants have acknowledged in these proceedings,*”’ the
sum at issue reflected Pan Ocean’s outstanding debt arising out of the dispute over the 1984

Crude Oil Sales Contract and represents the initial principal amount and the interest agreed

upon in the 1989 Settlement Agreement.*°*

Contrary to Claimants’ contentions, neither the Ministry of Petroleum Resources nor the
NNPC had the statutory mandate to intervene in the matter of the allotment of Pan Ocean’s

shares made in November 2005, or more generally in the private dispute around Pan Ocean.*°°

With regard to the alleged role of the Ministry, Claimants’ arguments should fail because: (i)
the Minister had no regulatory basis for intervening in a private dispute that was being litigated
before Nigerian courts; (ii) the Ministry’s consent was not required; and (iii) in any event, the

Ministry had no reason to cease its interactions with Pan Ocean’s management.*!°

First, relying on the expert reports of Justice Ayoola, the Petroleum Act only attributes to the
Ministry general supervisory powers over the operations carried out under oil mining licenses,
and does not give the Ministry any power or authority to intervene in a private dispute
regarding control of a company.*!! A Minister’s intervention would have been inappropriate
because the dispute over shareholding in Pan Ocean was litigated before Nigerian courts, and

the Ministry ought to respect the constitutional principle of independence of the judiciary.*!*

Second, Claimants failed to establish that the Minister’s consent was required to give effect to
the 29 November 2005 allotment of shares.*!? As of 2005, “it was unsettled in Nigerian law
whether an allotment of shares in a company holding rights in an oil mining lease was to be
regarded as an ‘assignment’ of a participating interest in the underlying oil mining lease,
requiring the consent of the Minister for Petroleum Resources under paragraph 14 of the First
Schedule to the Petroleum Act 1979.”4'4 Moreover, at that time, there were no judicial
precedents confirming that an allotment of shares could be regarded as an “assignment.”4!°
The case on which Claimants’ expert Professor Omorogbe relied (Moni Pulo v. Brass) does
not solve the issue because (i) the case was only decided in 2012 and is currently under appeal

and (ii) it concerned a transfer of shares. It did not address the key issue of what amounts to

an “assignment.”4!° The 2012-2014 Department of Petroleum Resources amendments to the
legislative framework, such that they expressly include “allotments”, confirms the absence of
aclear rule prior to those amendments.*!”

There is no evidence that the Minister was aware of the allotment or that Claimants raised the
issue following the 2005 Board Meeting Case, which also means that the Minister was in no

position to grant or refuse its consent.*!*

276. Finally, “[t]he Minister would have had no basis for unilaterally ceasing to regard the long-

time Managing Director as the legitimate representative of Pan Ocean.”4!? As acknowledged
by Claimants’ expert Professor Omorogbe, Dr. Fadeyi is his capacity as Managing Director

has been “the face of Pan Ocean for several decades.”*”°

277. With regard to the alleged role of the NNPC, Respondent submits that Claimants’ experts failed

to identify “a credible statutory or contractual basis on which the NNPC could or should have
intervened.”*?! Respondent argues that the NNPC can only exercise powers that are expressly
conferred on it by the NNPC Act and nothing in this Act suggests that the NNPC could interfere
in an internal dispute over shareholding of a private company.*?? In particular, contrary to
Claimants’ suggestion, “Section 5(1)(h) of the NNPC Act in no way allows the NNPC validly
to interfere in the internal management of a Joint Venture Partner.”*> Moreover, Respondent
submits that such a duty to intervene could not be based on the 2002 JOA either: under the
2002 JOA, the NNPC is a mere contracting party in the joint venture, which would not be

required to conduct enquiries into (or interfere with) the other party’s internal disputes over

shareholding.**+ Respondent argues that it would have been even less appropriate for the

NNPC to intervene since the matter was pending before Nigerian courts.*”5

The Tribunal should reject Claimants’ argument that the allotment of shares amounted to a
transfer of their interest in OML 98 and OPL 275, and would have thus required the NNPC’s
consent in accordance with Article 19.1.1 of the 2002 JOA.*”° Respondent’s expert Professor
Atsegbua argues that this provision did not apply in the present case: since Pan Ocean
(corporate entity with separate legal personality) held the same participating interest in the
joint venture and remained the operator of OML 98, an allotment of shares in the upstream
companies, even if it led to a change of control in Pan Ocean, did not amount to a transfer of
the participating interest requiring NNPC’s consent.*”’ Moreover, even if Article 19.1.1 of the
2002 JOA applied to the transfer of shares, “it would have been up to Pan Ocean to seek the
consent of the NNPC under the clause.”*?* However, Respondent alleges that nothing on the
record suggests that either Pan Ocean or Claimants attempted to raise the issue of consent with

the NNPC in relation to the 2005 allotment of shares.‘??

Finally, absent a court decision to the contrary, the NNPC was entitled to assume that Dr.
Fadeyi was the legitimate representative of Pan Ocean.**? Moreover, “the NNPC would not

have been in a position to take account of any alleged notices of a change in the ownership and

management of Pan Ocean.”*?!

Contrary to Claimants’ submissions, the decisions rendered by the Federal High Court of
Abuja in November 2005 and February 2006 were a reasonable and procedurally fair

application of Nigerian law.*?

With regard to the 2005 decision, Respondent submits that, first, Dr. Fadeyi’s application was
based on Sections 223(1) and 223(2) of the CAMA. These provisions have a pragmatic
purpose: they can be used to validate a general meeting or a meeting of the board of the
company that would normally be invalid under Section 221(1) of the CAMA because it was
not notified to those entitled to receive notification. “As the sole active and Managing Director
of Pan Ocean, Dr Fadeyi was eligible to make the application to the court to derogate from the

quorum requirement.”**>

The broad formulation used in Section 223 of the CAMA suggests that courts should be
provided some discretion when they establish whether it was indeed “impracticable” to call or

conduct a meeting following the ordinary procedures.**+

It was not unreasonable for the Federal High Court of Abuja to find that the requirements under
Section 223 of the CAMA were met, based on, inter alia, the affidavit provided by Dr. Fadeyi
with the application.** Dr. Fadeyi alleged that it had become impracticable to manage the
affairs of Pan Ocean, because the company’s quorum required two directors. He alleged that
he was unable to locate Mr. Rooks and that, after the death of Dr. Fabbri, he needed to be able
to appoint new directors to make sure that the company was not paralyzed. He stated that Pan
Ocean was a “going concern with several duties, obligations and liabilities”, and filed an
“Affidavit of Urgency”, claiming that it was also impossible to comply with the statutory

required filing of documentation.**°

Finally, Claimants’ criticism of the Court’s decision should be rejected. In particular, (i) the

Court had no reason to doubt that Dr. Fadeyi was unable to locate Mr. Rooks who, as of

November 2005, was deceased;**” (ii) the Court had no reason to require the presence of
Claimants at the hearing, because Dr. Fadeyi was not seeking an order against them, nor were
they entitled to receive notice of the Board of Directors meetings;*** (iii) the fact that the court
addressed the application as a matter of urgency is not surprising, given the uncontested nature

1:89

of the application and the evidence before the cour and (iv) the decision merely authorized

the holding of a meeting without getting involved in the content.+°

The 2006 decision validated the allotment of shares decided by the Board of Directors of Pan
Ocean on 29 November 2005. Dr. Fadeyi requested that the Court validate the allotment of
unissued shares on the basis of Section 123 of the CAMA. This provision gives some discretion
to courts to decide whether validation would be “just and equitable” in the circumstances.**!
Contrary to Claimants’ suggestion that the decision was incompatible with the division of roles
enshrined in Section 124 of the CAMA, Section 123 of the CAMA expressly grants the

authority to validate decisions that would have been otherwise regarded as invalid.“

Second, Claimants allege that Dr. Fadeyi served the notices to the wrong addresses on purpose.
Even if this were the case, Respondent could not be held responsible for Dr. Fadeyi’s actions,
and the court was entitled to rely on Dr. Fadeyi’s statement that the notices were returned.
Moreover, the address of the notice was the same address of Claimants as listed in the annual

returns of Pan Ocean, attached to the CAC Report of April 2005.47

Third, the evidence before the Court suggested that Claimants could not be contacted. Thus, it
would have been contrary to the purpose of Section 123 of the CAMA to require their presence

at the hearing, since the provision allows courts to validate directors’ decisions precisely under

such circumstances.*“+ Moreover, Claimants do not explain in what capacity the CAC could

have taken part in proceedings concerning the allotment of shares of a private company.“

288. Finally, the evidence before the Court suggested that the issuance of shares was necessary,

because of Pan Ocean’s financial needs. The decision relied on the affidavit of a Mr. Wole
Aladedoye, who submitted that Pan Ocean had substantial debt. The allotment of shares was
motivated by the need to raise capital to continue its operations. Respondent also notes that the
quantum expert reports submitted by both Parties confirm that in 2006, Pan Ocean was

undergoing financial difficulties.*°

289. Respondent concludes that “the court’s finding was reasonable, based on the evidence before

290.

it.” Moreover, it argues, Claimants did not point to any “red flag” that could have led the Court
to depart from the ordinary principles for evaluation of evidence. Respondent further submits
that, if Claimants were convinced that the evidence before the Court was factually incorrect or
misleading, they could have filed an appeal, but “they failed to do so within the time allowed

and effectively mismanaged their right to seek redress of the court’s decision.”*4”

vi. Failure to Act Upon CAC Findings or Investigate Alleged Criminal Acts Within Pan Ocean

Respondent rejects Claimants’ contention the CAC acted in an “inconsistent and arbitrary
manner.”““* First, Respondent agrees that the “CAC Report” of April 2005 was in favor of
Claimants: it confirmed that Claimants were the only two shareholders of Pan Ocean, and that
Dr. Fadeyi had committed two irregularities in 1998, when he attempted to issue shares to a
Mr. Tomisin and to appoint other two directors without the quorum.” However, Respondent
also stresses that the CAC is a statutory body established by the CAMA, which has the

authority to investigate the affairs of companies and to report on the results of its investigations,

but is “not empowered to order companies to undertake certain actions following from its

report.”45°

Second, when the CAC later registered the allotment of shares made on 29 November 2005, it
was merely following the order of the Federal High Court of Abuja of 8 February 2006, which
validated the allotment.**! According to Respondent, Claimants’ expert Professor Oditah
confirmed that the CAC did not have the authority to override the decision of the Court and,
in any event, there were no sufficient reasons for it to conclude that the allotment was irregular

or that the decision of the Court was unsound.‘

Claimants’ vilification of Respondent’s law enforcement agencies is unwarranted. According
to Respondent, “the fact that the Respondent’s Police or the [Economic and Financial Crimes
Commission] did not act as the Claimants would have wished does not mean that there was no
investigation or that they did not fulfil their duties.”**> Moreover, Claimants themselves had
initiated judicial proceedings on the same issues. Contrary to Claimants’ argument that the
principle of sub-judice does not apply to crimes, “it would have been impossible for law
enforcement to secure a conviction of Dr Fadeyi when the main act being denounced as a crime
had been validated by a court order and was subject to appeal or set-aside proceedings in other

civil suits.”4*4

the actions of private parties that, according to the Claimants, sought to sever them from their
interest in and control over Pan Ocean.”**> According to Respondent, the NNPC, the Ministry

of Petroleum Resources, and the CAC did not have “a statutory mandate to intervene in a

private shareholding dispute, even if relating to a partner in a Joint Venture. Nor could they

second-guess the outcome of proceedings before the Nigerian courts.”**°

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis
i. Alleged Arrest and Unlawful Detention of Claimants’ Representative

Although this has been presented in an inconsistent manner, the Tribunal accepts that, in 1987,
Respondent detained Mr. Rooks. This Tribunal, however, has been unable to find any

relationship between this detention and Claimants’ claim for expropriation.

The Tribunal notes that even if the purpose of Mr. Rooks’s 1987 trip to Nigeria had been to
terminate Dr. Fadeyi, Claimants have not shown that there was any connection between Dr.
Fadeyi and his potential concerns about his termination and Respondent’s detention of Mr.
Rooks. Claimants have stated that this detention was “in connection with a disagreement over
termination of a crude oil lifting contract and to enforce its [Respondent’s] rights as a joint

venture partner.”4°7

Claimants have not proven Dr. Fadeyi’s knowledge of Mr. Rooks’s
intention to terminate Dr. Fadeyi’s employment. Nor have they demonstrated that if such
knowledge existed, it caused Dr. Fadeyi to engineer the arrest and detention of Mr. Rooks,

which could have been entirely independent of Dr. Fadeyi’s concerns, if such concerns existed.

Nor do further actions alleged by Claimants, as related to Dr. Fadeyi, show a concerted effort
by Respondent to destroy Claimants’ investment in Nigeria. No evidence demonstrates
attribution to Respondent of any actions that might have been taken by Dr. Fadeyi to reduce
Dr. Fabbri’s salary, or to authorize cash calls Dr. Fadeyi made on NNPC on behalf of Pan

Ocean.

ii. NNPC’s Alleged Failure to Provide Guidance and Investigate Claims

Claimants argue that the (in)actions of the NNPC are imputable to Respondent, as
Respondent’s national oil company. They claim that the NNPC’s failure to investigate their

claims to be shareholders in 2000 and 2005 is further evidence of a creeping expropriation.

456 Respondent’s Rejoinder § 90.

“57 Claimants’ Memorial § 4.3.

88

Respondent’s and its agencies’ failures to intervene in the events involving Pan Ocean,
however, do not lead directly to culpability on the part of Respondent. In principle, State-
controlled entities are considered as separate from the State, unless they exercise elements of
governmental authority within the meaning of ILC Article 5.4°* The NNPC’s operation and its
role and powers as described in the Nigerian legislation confirm that the NNPC is a commercial
entity that only engages in “private or commercial” activities.? The alleged violations of

Claimants’ rights by the NNPC would, therefore, not be attributable to Respondent.*°

298. While it was perhaps rude for Respondent or NNPC to fail to respond to correspondence from

Claimants in 2000, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the NNPC would have had a duty to
investigate the validity and circumstances of any changes to the shareholdings of Pan Ocean.
There is no statutory, contractual or regulatory basis on which consent is required from the

NNPC or the Minister for the allotment of shares in a private company, like Pan Ocean.

299. The NNPC’s regulatory mandate is set out in the NNPC Act.*°! The NNPC cannot directly or

300.

indirectly exercise any power not expressly conferred upon it by the Act, and nothing in its
mandate allows it to interfere in the internal shareholding disputes of a private company.*?
Further, should a duty have existed, Claimants have not met their burden of proving that what
the NNPC did was orchestrated for or on behalf of Respondent with the ultimate intent of
depriving Claimants of their investment in Nigeria. Even if Respondent had had the authority
to intervene, in 2005 Claimants’ shareholding was a matter pending before Nigerian Courts

and the NNPC does not have the power to doubt the decisions of the Nigerian courts.

In this context, it must be recalled that Mrs. Timolini’s standing in Pan Ocean could have been

questioned and was finally abandoned in 2010 when, for reasons that have not been disclosed

to the Tribunal, Mrs. Timolini yielded her interest in Impex to Dr. Fabbri’s estate.**

303.

Against this context, it is understandable that the NNPC would have hesitated to communicate
with the alleged representatives of Claimants. While Respondent has not offered an adequate
explanation for the failure to answer and deal with correspondence or to meet and speak with
these individuals, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the NNPC’s inaction was orchestrated for
or on behalf of Respondent, or with the ultimate goal of depriving Claimants of their

investment in Nigeria.

Claimants also allege that Respondent’s failure to respond to their correspondence is further
indication of the creeping expropriation. The issue for the Tribunal is whether Respondent’s
failure to address Claimants’ correspondence, whether through incompetence or malevolence,
was intended to deprive Claimants of their investment in Nigeria. The effect of not responding
to the correspondence allowed the situation to further develop, resulting in this arbitration.
There is, however, no indication that Dr. Fadeyi interfered with any of the correspondence
received or sent by the Ministry or the NNPC or that there was a concerted effort to remove
Claimants as shareholders. Even if Respondent was aware that there was a dispute between
Claimants and Dr. Fadeyi, as indicated above, neither NNPC or Respondent had a duty to

intervene.

iii. | Respondent’s Renewal of the Joint Operating Agreement (“JOA”)

While Claimants characterize the extension of the JOA as self-dealing and a breach of
Respondent’s and NNPC’s responsibilities to ensure that NNPC was participating with the
proper partner, the context is key. In 2002, the JOA was due for renewal and was expressly
anticipated and welcomed in the debt repayment plan penned by Dr. Fabbri on 17 June 1998,

prior to his death.**

Pursuant to that letter, repayment would begin in 2002 and would last
seven years.*°> Extending the JOA was important. It was a valuable asset for NNPC and
Respondent, and for Pan Ocean. It was only natural that the JOA would be negotiated through
Pan Ocean’s representative at the time, Dr. Fadeyi. The Tribunal cannot see a link between the

extension of the JOA and the debt repayment agreement on the one hand, and NNPC allegedly

44 Letter from Dr. Vittorio Fabbri to the NNPC Managing Director, 17 June 1998, Exhibit R-28 (“We look forward
to executing a Joint Operating Agreement with NNPC which shall incorporate the fore-going terms and conditions”),
making no mention of a change in ownership.

working towards or engineering that Claimants would lose the beneficial ownership and

control of Pan Ocean, on the other.

The JOA did not give the NNPC authority to intervene in the internal disputes of Pan Ocean’s
shareholders.*°° The JOA set out the NNPC’s mandate and role within the Joint Venture,**’
which is contractual in nature. No evidence demonstrates that such a regulatory agency has a

right to intervene in internal disputes among shareholders.*°*

Finally, no evidence demonstrates that the NNPC had a duty to verify Dr. Fadeyi’s authority
to enter into the JOA. Given the inconsistencies involved with respect to Mrs. Timolini’s
position and participation in the company, it may have been reasonable to believe that he was
fully authorized to engage in an anticipated renewal transaction. Accordingly, the Tribunal

finds no breach with respect to the renewal of the JOA.

iv. Respondent’s Failure to Scrutinize the Change of Control

Here, the Tribunal is again tasked to examine whether, in the context of change in control of
Pan Ocean, NNPC’s inaction can be attributed to Respondent or whether this inaction was
wrongful under Nigerian law. The Tribunal recalls its decision, above, regarding the

attributability of the NNPC’s actions to Respondent.

The regulatory mandate of the NNPC derives from the enabling statute, the NNPC Act.*® The
NNPC cannot directly or indirectly exercise any power not expressly conferred on it by that
Act. Nothing in the NNPC’s regulatory mandate allows the NNPC to interfere in internal
shareholding disputes of a private company.*”” NNPC’s general power to regulate companies
does not “translate into a general power to intervene in the private disputes of Joint Venture

partners.”47! As indicated above, this was not changed through the JOA, which sets out the

4 As noted elsewhere in this

NNPC’s contractual mandate and role within the Joint Venture.
Award, no evidence demonstrates that the NNPC as regulatory agency has received power to

intervene in an internal dispute among Pan Ocean’s shareholders.*”>

308. Even if NNPC had had authority to intervene, it simply could not have done so because the

dispute was a pending matter before the Nigerian courts. The NNPC does not have the power

to doubt the decisions of the Nigerian Courts,*”

nor would it have been appropriate for any
Minister to intervene while the matter was pending. Of course, this is independent of the fact
that, even if Dr. Fadeyi was able to manipulate or direct the NNPC to ignore or overlook his
abuses or fraudulent actions, that would not be attributable to Respondent. If the NNPC
misused its authority and power, the remedy would be through the Nigerian Courts — at least
at first instance. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds no treaty breach in any alleged failure of

Respondent to scrutinize change of control in Pan Ocean.

309. Claimants argue that the deprivation of their rights also constitutes, a fortiori, a violation of

Section 24 of the NIPC Act, which provides for the unconditional transferability of funds,
including dividends or profits attributable to the investment.*”> According to Claimants, the
expropriation of their investment “has led directly to the inability to receive any dividends,
profits or other proceeds from their asset.”4”° The Tribunal agrees with Respondent’s position
that Section 24 of the NIPC Act cannot be used to enable or require Respondent intervene into
payment disputes between two private parties.4”’ Thus, Claimants have not suffered a violation

of Section 24 of the NIPC Act.

While Respondent’s actions and the actions of their courts are attributable to Respondent,
Claimants have again not met their burden of proving that Respondent had any involvement in
Dr. Fadeyi’s actions. Dr. Fadeyi’s failure to notify Claimants is, therefore, not attributable to
Respondent. The court did not breach its obligations in relying on Dr. Fadeyi’s statement that
the notices were returned, as the address of the notice was the same address of Claimants as

listed in the annual returns of Pan Ocean, attached to the CAC Report of April 2005.47

The circumstances leading to the 2005 and 2006 decisions are largely undisputed, leaving it
for the Tribunal to determine whether these cases were (part of) a judicial expropriation of
Claimants’ asset or, alternatively, whether the cases were legally incorrect and a miscarriage

of justice.

While the 2005 Board Meeting Case appears to have been legally wrong and unjust, it was not
a judicial expropriation. The Tribunal is not persuaded that Respondent was responsible for
the 2005 Board Meeting Case Decision, or for the Courts’ actions that enabled Dr. Fadeyi to
take over Pan Ocean and deprive Claimants of their ownership thereof. Rather, that case
appears to have been a miscarriage of justice. Claimants’ remedy would have been to challenge
it in courts, before the Nigerian Court of Appeal. Rather than do so and exhaust their domestic

remedies, however, Claimants abandoned proceedings.

The following actions resulted in the 2005 Board Meeting Case. On 21 November 2005, Dr.
Fadeyi applied to the Federal Court of Abuja for leave to hold a Board Meeting of Pan Ocean,
attaching an affidavit in support of his application which, among other things, stated that Mr.
Rooks “departed Nigeria and had since never returned to the country” and “his efforts to locate
him had proven abortive.”*” Three days later, the Federal Court of Abuja granted Dr. Fadeyi’s
application. Shortly thereafter the Board Meeting took place during which resolutions were

passed allotting the remaining 7,500 unissued shares of Pan Ocean to Dr. Fadeyi and his

associates.**° Claimants submit that no shareholders were present at that meeting and that

“there is no evidence that they were even notified of it.”4*!

In order to validate the allotment of those shares, Dr. Fadeyi had to hold an Extraordinary
General Meeting of Pan Ocean shareholders; at that same meeting he would also seek to
appoint Justice Duro Adebiyi and Alhaji Muhammed Dikko Yusuf as Directors of the
company.**? On 19 January 2006, again in the absence of the shareholders of Pan Ocean, an
ordinary resolution was passed through which Dr. Fadeyi appointed his associates Justice Duro
Adebiyi and Alhaji Muhammed Dikko Yusuf as Directors and the share allocation was
effected.**? Claimants allege that the 8 February 2006 decision of the Federal High Court of
Abuja, which validated the resolutions passed by Dr. Fadeyi, qualifies as an expropriation

under Section 25 of the NIPC Act or a denial of justice.***

As indicated in the previous section, the JOA did not give the NNPC the authority to intervene
in the internal disputes of Pan Ocean’s shareholders. In this case, Claimants’ remedy would
have been to challenge the decision in the courts. Initially, this is what happened. It is, however,
unclear why the case was withdrawn and did not go on appeal. In principle, this case and its
merits could have been presented before the Nigerian Court of Appeal. Even if Dr. Fadeyi and
NNPC raised procedural issues such that the case could never proceed, as alleged, the Tribunal
is not persuaded that Respondent was responsible for any action that was taken in the courts
as part of an alleged intention to enable Dr. Fadeyi to take over Pan Ocean and deprive

Claimants of their ownership of Pan Ocean.

This issue concerns whether the alleged actions or omissions of the CAC, which Claimants
submit is a State organ and statutory agency regulating and administering companies, are treaty

breaches that are attributable to Respondent.**>

The CAC investigation occurred while the proceedings in the 2004 Fraud Case were pending
before the Federal High Court of Lagos, when Claimants asked the CAC to conduct a separate

investigation of Pan Ocean, in parallel with that Court proceeding.**°

The CAC found, in April 2005, that (i) the only two shareholders of Pan Ocean were Claimants,
(ii) Mrs. Timolini owned beneficial stocks in Claimants and the ownership of Pan Ocean was,
therefore, vested in her, (iii) the affairs of Pan Ocean were conducted in a manner prejudicial
to the interests of the shareholders, and (iv) that the shareholders had been excluded from
running the affairs of Pan Ocean since 1 September 1998. The CAC Report blamed

irregularities on Dr. Fadeyi’s having acted without sufficient quorum.

The Court in concluding the 2004 Fraud Case on 10 November 2005, however, found the CAC
Report to be inadmissible hearsay information, and did not allow it to be submitted as evidence.
As a result, and given the findings of the 2004 Fraud Case, no government institution could

have relied on that report.

CAC looked at the bigger picture and expressed serious concerns about Pan Ocean. The fact
that it was disregarded by a court for procedural irregularity does not mean that the various
findings of the CAC report had no merit. As these issues were in the air, one would have
expected at least some investigation or enquiry into Pan Ocean, its shareholders, and
management. Respondent’s failure to investigate the Pan Ocean situation further may have
been due to incompetence or irresponsibility, or as suggested by Claimants, greater intrigue.
Either way, there was a failure on the part of Respondent to act prudently when looking at the

relationship of Pan Ocean with NNPC and the Ministry of Petroleum.

As indicated above, the NNPC would not have had a duty or authority to intervene. Even if

Respondent and its agencies failed to intervene when they could have, this alone does not

485 Claimants’ Reply § 134(x); Claimants’ Post-Hearing Brief 4 35.

directly lead to culpability on the part of Respondent. Granted, if Respondent had nonetheless
conducted a further investigation into the matter, it may have determined that Dr. Fadeyi did
not have proper authority for his actions on behalf of Pan Ocean and/or that he was exceeding
his authority. Respondent argues that it did not have the authority to “secure a conviction of
Dr Fadeyi when the main act being denounced as a crime had been validated by a court order

and was subject to appeal or set-aside proceedings in other civil suits.”4°”

322. The question here is whether Respondent appreciated, or should have appreciated, that the

323.

likely effect of the management of Pan Ocean by Dr. Fadeyi and Respondent’s non-
intervention into the case, would be to deprive Claimants of their investment in Nigeria.
Respondent’s inaction could be indicative of wrongdoing, but the Tribunal is not persuaded
that Respondent could have anticipated that the combined effect of Dr. Fadeyi’s management
of Pan Ocean and Respondent’s non-intervention would deprive Claimants of their investment.
The Tribunal is not persuaded that Respondent was the complicit or driving force in Dr.
Fadeyi’s plan. Given the facts as they were at the time, Claimants have not established that
Respondent was privy to or had reason to question the purpose and intent of Dr. Fadeyi’s plans.

The Tribunal, therefore, finds no breach of Respondent’s obligations.

vii. | Respondent’s inaction, lack of cooperation, and facilitation of Dr. Fadeyi’s actions

Consistent with the decisions above, the Tribunal does not find that Dr. Fadeyi, while acting
as a representative of the NNPC/POOC joint venture was also engaging in conduct attributable
to Respondent and thus, engaging its responsibility. *** Claimants’ contention that Dr. Fadeyi’s
“refusal to respond to the Claimants’ demands to restore control of the operator company; to
provide joint operation financial information to Claimants was an act attributable to the state”

is rejected.**?

The Tribunal considers the allegations related to (i) the failure of Respondent to investigate
criminal acts within Pan Ocean and (ii) the fallacy of Respondent’s excuses for action,

together.

Claimants contend that there was no basis for Respondent’s failure to investigate the criminal
acts within Pan Ocean uncovered in the CAC report, “The inescapable conclusion point to
collusion and cover-up.” Claimants reject Respondent’s “afterthought” explanation that it
could not intervene because issues were sub judice.*?' Respondent’s further explanations also
do not justify or support its inaction because the complaints began well before any court action,
investigation of Claimants’ grievances were not prevented by court action, and there was no

contemporaneous correspondence giving such explanations.

Respondent denies Claimants’ assertions that its law enforcement agencies did not do anything.
Respondent explains that the Police and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission
simply do not have the power to “secure a conviction of Dr. Fadeyi when the main act being
denounced as a crime had been validated by a court order and was subject to appeal or set-

aside proceedings in other civil suits.” 4°?

Furthermore, Respondent asserts that Mrs. Timolini’s standing in Pan Ocean had been called
into question by the decision in the 2004 Fraud Case. All of the petitions that Claimants accuse
Respondent’s law enforcement of neglecting to investigate were signed solely, jointly or on

behalf of Mrs. Timolini.*”>

With respect to the NNPC and the Minister of Petroleum’s alleged failure to act as argued by
Claimants, as explained above, Respondent submits that the NNPC does not have the authority

to intervene in shareholding disputes of its JV partners. In support of its assertion, Respondent

refers to Mr. Jones’s words at the hearing where he admitted that he had not seen any precedent

for such intervention in other instances.*”* This was also confirmed by Professor Omorogbe.*”

Lastly, Respondent argues the fact that Claimants have litigated the dispute and activated sub-
judice principles has prevented the NNPC and the Minister from acting as Claimants wished.
Professor Omorogbe recognized that court actions could bar executive intervention and that

out-of-court intervention “depends on the facts.” 4°

With regard to the judicial system of Nigeria and the national courts’ actions, Respondent
argues that (i) there is no evidence of a pattern of scandalous decisions against Claimants, (ii)
the very first decision (2002 Ownership case) was decided in favour of Claimants, (iii)
Claimants did not lose at every turn and not all decisions against them have been condemned
by their experts.*°’ In fact, Respondent argues that Claimants themselves “prevented their
cases from going ahead, including by discontinuing one, withdrawing an appeal, serially

amending filings and making an incompetent application.”4*

This behavior of Respondent may give rise to suspicions that there was something more than
incompetence or bad practice. Following the CAC Report, Respondent might have launched
an investigation to determine whether Dr. Fadeyi had proper authority for his actions on behalf
of Pan Ocean, or was exceeding his role at Pan Ocean. Respondent might have investigated

whether concerns expressed by Claimants and the Fabbri family had any merit.

Respondent took no action and did not get involved. Nonetheless, the fact that Respondent
and its agencies failed to intervene when they could and perhaps should have to determine the
merits of complaints received and suspicions of what was happening at Pan Ocean, itself does

not lead directly to culpability on the part of Respondent.

D. Legal Foundations for Claims under Customary International Law

(1) Statutory Provisions

Above, the Tribunal found that the following broadly drafted language of Section 26 of the

NIPC Act includes claims under customary international law, incorporated into Nigerian Law

through Article 32 of the Interpretation Act (1964).*°

“26. Dispute settlement procedures

qd

(2)

(3)

Where a dispute arises between an investor an any Government of
the Federation in respect of an enterprise, all efforts shall be made
through mutual discussion to reach an amicable settlement.

Any dispute between an investor and any Government of the
Federation in respect of an enterprise to which this Act applies
which is not amicably settled through mutual discussions, may be
submitted at the option of the aggrieved party to arbitration as
follows—

(a) In the case of a Nigerian investor, in accordance with the
rules of procedure for arbitration as specified in the
Arbitration and Conciliation Act; or

(b) In the case of a foreign investor, within the framework of
any bilateral or multilateral agreement on investment
protection to which the Federal Government and the
country of which the investor is a national are parties; or

(c) In accordance with any other national or international
machinery for the settlement of investment disputes agreed
on by the parties.

Where in respect of a dispute, there is disagreement between the
investor and the Federal Government as to the method of dispute
settlement to be adopted, the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes Rules shall apply.”

Article 32 of the Interpretation Act states as follows in relevant part:

4°9 Interpretation Act 1964, Legal Authority CL-92.

99

335.

336.

“32. Law in force with respect to Federal matters

Subject to the provisions of this section and except in so far as other
provision is made by any Federal law, the common law of England and the
doctrines of equity, together with the statutes of general application that
were in force in England on the 1* day of January, 1900, shall, in so far as
they relate to any matter within the legislative competence of the Federal
legislature, be in force in Nigeria.”

(2) The Parties’ Positions
a. Claimants’ Position

Claimants contend that the alleged acts and omissions summarized above also constitute
violations of Respondent’s duties and obligations under customary international law, including
“a responsibility to ensure that (i) the treatment of a foreign investor does not fall below
recognized international minimum standards, and/or (ii) that the foreign investor receives fair
and equitable treatment, and/or (iii) is not subject to arbitrary, unreasonable and/or unfair
treatment which has the effect of failing to protect his economic rights, interests and/or

security.”5°°

According to Claimants, Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention allows the Tribunal to apply
“such rules of international law as may be applicable”, which includes customary international
law.*°! Moreover, Claimants argue that the rules of customary international law are integrated
into Nigerian law because they are part of the common law of England and Wales, which was
received into the Nigerian legal system according to Section 32(1) of the Interpretation Act of
1964.°°? Claimants reject Respondent’s expert Justice Ayoola’s suggestion that only the
Supreme Court of Nigeria can establish whether customary international law applies, because
that would mean that parties should wait until the case goes to the Supreme Court to have a

decision on this point.>°

i. Minimum Standard

337. First, Claimants state that under customary international law, Respondent has the duty to
respect a minimum standard of treatment, as established in Neer v. Mexico.*™ For this standard
to be violated, “[...] an act must be sufficiently egregious and shocking — gross denial of
justice, manifest arbitrariness, blatant unfairness, a complete lack of due process, evident
discrimination, or a manifest lack of reasons.”°°> Claimants argue that “if a reasonable observer
was apprised of the totality of the acts or omissions of the Respondent in its treatment of the
Claimants, over this period of time, he would readily conclude that it was ‘blatantly unfair’,
‘manifestly arbitrary’, ‘evidently discriminatory’ and ‘shocking.””°°° In particular, Claimants
allege that the decision of the Federal High Court in the 2005 case was a “gross miscarriage of
justice” and constituted a clear violation of the minimum standard of treatment of foreign

investors.°°7

ii. Fair and Equitable Treatment and Full Protection and Security

338. Second, Claimants argue that the Fair and Equitable Treatment is a standalone standard in
international customary law.°°* According to Claimants, this is confirmed by the “plethora of

BITs which contain FET clauses”, which evidence the “level of acceptance amongst States” as

to FET’s status as customary principle.*°

339. According to Claimants, “the Respondent has violated the basic standards of transparency,
good faith, fairness, procedural proprietary and due process which ought to have been accorded
a foreign investor.”*!° In particular, Claimants mention Respondent’s failure to address the
several investor-related grievances presented by Claimants, to deal with them fairly and to

provide information in a transparent way, as well as its failure to protect (and refusal to give

effect to) Claimants’ enjoyment of their rights and the benefits deriving from their

investment.*!!

In the alternative, Claimants argue that, even if the Tribunal accepts Respondent’s argument
that only the minimum standard is a principle of customary international law, the alleged
actions and omissions by Respondent’s instrumentalities also constitute a violation of the
standard as formulated in Waste Management, which refers to a state behavior that is
“arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant
to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which
offends judicial propriety.”*!?

Finally, Claimants argue that Respondent has not accorded Claimants full protection and
security in Nigeria, stating that “[i]nstead, its Directors and representatives have been
unlawfully detained and refused access to government instrumentalities or entry into

Nigeria.”>'>

b. Respondent’s Position

Without prejudice to its objections to jurisdiction (summarized supra), Respondent contends
that Claimants failed to meet their burden of proof as to the existence of the alleged rules of
customary international law and their binding effect, which would require evidence of both a
consistent State practice and of the opinio iuris.*'* As a consequence, it concludes that “[i]n
the absence of any proven rule of customary international law beyond this, the Respondent’s
obligations under international law are limited to the customary international law minimum

standard of protection.”*!>

According to Respondent, “Claimants have failed both to: (i) rebut the Respondent’s

arguments regarding the applicable legal standard; and (ii) discharge their burden of proving

that any of the Respondent’s actions constitutes a violation of the international minimum

standard.”*!°

i. International Minimum Standard

Respondent states that international tribunals’ interpretation of the minimum standard has not
departed significantly from the high threshold established in Neer v. Mexico (which was very
close to concepts of denial of justice, due process and physical protection), and that the
customary minimum standard of treatment of investors “continues to be limited to the ‘gross
denial of justice’, ‘manifest arbitrariness’ or a ‘complete lack of due process’, and similarly
‘egregious and shocking’ treatment.”*!’ Moreover, claims in relation to arbitrary and
unreasonable measures are also subsumed under this customary standard, and are thus limited
to “a wilful disregard of due process of law” or “an act which shocks [...] a sense of juridical

propriety.”>!8

According to Respondent, none of the acts and omissions alleged by Claimants amounts to a
violation of the customary minimum standard.>" First, since they developed their argument in
the alternative, Claimants failed to point to specific measures that would constitute violations
of the minimum standard.**° Second, Claimants’ allegations, based on a series of supposed
acts and omissions by Respondent, are misleading because, as a matter of both domestic and
international law, Respondent’s executive branch could not intervene in a dispute between
private parties or interfere with management of a private entity.**! Finally, even if these
allegations were substantiated, the high threshold for finding violations of the minimum

standard was not reached. Indeed, Claimants did not even allege that Respondent’s acts and

omissions would constitute a violation of domestic law.°** Moreover, to the extent that

Claimants allege that Respondent is responsible for arbitrary and unreasonable measures, they

also failed to meet the required standard of “manifest arbitrariness.”°”>

Respondent stresses that, by not interfering in a private dispute, the various state entities
allegedly involved acted within their constitutional roles and limitations.**+ Moreover,
according to Respondent, international tribunals cannot act as courts of appeal: the mere fact
that national decisions contain mistakes of fact or of law (or a fortiori, that a party is not
satisfied about the outcome) will not attract international liability unless the claimant shows a
gross “denial of justice” or “manifest arbitrariness.”°*> Respondent highlights that its expert,
former Supreme Court Justice Ayoola, confirmed that the decisions in question were taken
after fair hearings, where parties where duly heard, there were no allegations of bias, and the
court considered all the issues and addressed all the submissions.*”° According to Respondent,
Claimants had an opportunity to be heard and present evidence before national courts, which
normally excludes a violations of the minimum standard.*”’ Moreover, Respondent contends
that Claimants failed to exhaust the available local remedies, which is required to prove denial

of justice claims, since they discontinued a suit and failed to appeal the other, while another

appeal is still pending.***

ii. Fair and Equitable Treatment and Full Protection and Security

Respondent contends that the “fair and equitable treatment standard is not a standalone
protection under customary international law.”**? Respondent’s arguments can be summarized
as follows: (i) Claimants failed to point to decisions, commentaries or legal authorities

supporting their position;**° (ii) the mere fact that the fair and equitable treatment is a common

provision in carefully negotiated BITs and other investment treaties (which are “compromises
between investment protection and sovereign control over foreign investment”) does not
amount to the required State practice and opinio iuris, and is therefore not sufficient to establish
the existence of a rule of customary international law;>*! (iii) “where tribunals have adopted a
more expansive interpretation of the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment, they
have done so explicitly on the basis that they are interpreting an autonomous treaty standard,
as opposed to the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law”, and thus
the decisions interpreting these treaty provisions are of no assistance in the present case;** (iv)

standard of treatment under customary international law, such tribunals have done so without

reference to evidence of State practice or opinio juris;”°*° and (v) arbitral decisions may assist

in summarizing the content of customary international law, if they do so expressly, but do not

constitute state practice themselves, and cannot create or prove customary international law.***

348. Respondent further argues that “it is one thing for tribunals to ‘read down’ the term of ‘fair and

equitable treatment’ to ensure that it conforms to the minimum standard of treatment at
customary international law”, but quite another to spontaneously “ascribe content to a
customary international law standard, without any evidence that States have agreed to this.”**5

Respondent concludes that it “cannot be held to a standard of protection that it has purposefully

not agreed to by refraining from entering into a BIT with the United States.”>*°

According to Respondent “to the extent that a fair and equitable treatment standard exists under
customary international law in relation to foreign investments, it is limited to those protections
provided by the minimum standard of treatment.”**” Moreover, Respondent contends that the
threshold for finding a violation of the fair and equitable treatment as customary minimum

> 538

standard is high, and limited to the “most egregious offences including “... acts showing

a wilful neglect of duty, an insufficiency of action falling far below international standards, or

even subjective bad faith.”°°°

Respondent concludes that none of its alleged acts and omissions would meet the threshold for
finding violations of any reading of the fair and equitable treatment standard.*“° As mentioned
above, Respondent stresses that: (i) Respondent and its agencies had no right or obligation to
intervene in Pan Ocean’s internal dispute; (ii) Claimants failed to show that they were treated
unfairly by Nigerian courts; (iii) the CAC merely recognized the issuance of shares further to
an order of a Nigerian court on the same matter; (iv) Respondent only engaged with Dr. Fadeyi
through the NNPC, in the context of its contractual relationship with Pan Ocean, and it was
entitled to assume that Dr. Fadeyi was the company’s legitimate representative; and (v) even
if Respondent had gotten the ability to meet with Claimants and respond to their letters and
requests, the alleged failure to do so could not possibly constitute a violation of the fair and
equitable treatment standard, either under customary international law or under any treaty-

based interpretation of the standard.**!

Respondent submits that Claimants did not provide sufficient explanations as to the alleged
violation of an obligation to provide full protection and security, nor did they request “that the
Tribunal declare that the Respondent has failed to provide full protection and security to the
Claimants’ [investments].”*4? However, it argues that, “to the extent that the Claimants are
making a claim pursuant to full protection and security under customary international law, [that

claim] must also be dismissed.”*4?

According to Respondent, the obligation to provide full protection and security under
customary international law is subsumed within the international minimum standard of
treatment and is limited to serious threats to physical security.*“4 Without prejudice to its
jurisdictional objections, Respondent further contends that, although Claimants seem to allege
that the 1987 detention of their representative amounts to such a violation, they “do not clarify
why this event is relevant to the present claim, do not present any evidence of this detention
and there is no record of the Claimants or Mr Rooks ever pursuing any remedy in relation to

these alleged events.”*45

(3) The Tribunal’s Analysis

Above, the Tribunal found that Claimants’ claims under international law are properly before
this Tribunal. Having found above that Claimants have not suffered an expropriation, the
Tribunal now amplifies its views on the alleged violation of key legal standards, including (i)
the minimum standard of treatment, and (ii) the fair and equitable treatment standard (including
the full protection and security standard). The Tribunal declines to evaluate whether the
actions alleged could constitute a denial of justice — a term used by each Party in its pleadings.
Initially, Claimants argued extensively on whether Respondent’s alleged actions constituted a
“denial of justice” in the sense of a judicial expropriation and in the sense of a violation of
customary international law. In their post-hearing submission, however, Claimants expressly

indicated that they are not advancing their case under that theory, but rather on the theory of

54 Respondent’s Counter-Memorial § 461.

356.

indirect expropriation.**°

The Tribunal, therefore, refers to its conclusions regarding acts
allegedly constituting an indirect expropriation, above, and ends its discussion of “denial of

justice.”

Claimants invite the Tribunal to assess this case pursuant to the minimum standard of treatment
established in the Neer v. Mexico case. Under those criteria, action violates international law
when it is “[...] sufficiently egregious and shocking — gross denial of justice, manifest
arbitrariness, blatant unfairness, a complete lack of due process, evident discrimination, or a

manifest lack of reasons.”°47

Even if the Tribunal were to accept Claimants’ position regarding the international minimum
standard and its applicability, however, the Tribunal has concluded that Dr. Fadeyi’s actions
are not attributable to Respondent.*48 Moreover, the Tribunal has concluded that neither the
NNPC nor Respondent have breached their duties toward Claimants with respect to the alleged
failures to investigate. The Tribunal has also found that the decisions of the Federal High
Court of Abuja from 2005 and 2006 do not create liability for Respondent. Thus, accepting
this standard and in light of the above, the Tribunal would need only consider whether the
detention of Mr. Rooks violated the minimum standard of treatment or the fair and equitable

treatment and full protection and security standards.

Here, Claimants have not presented arguments or evidence to support their claim that the
detention of Mr. Rooks was a violation, separate from their allegation that this 1987 arrest set
into motion a chain of events that led to Claimants ultimately losing control of their company.
Above, Claimants did not establish the relevance of the detention of Mr. Rooks, which pre-
date the enactment of the NIPC Act, to their expropriation claim. Contrary to their submission
that their “Directors and representatives have been unlawfully detained and refused access to
government instrumentalities or entry into Nigeria”,*“? Claimants have not established the
unlawfulness of the detention of Mr. Rooks. Likewise, Claimants have not shown that this

“set into motion a chain of events”, as they have not shown that they were denied entry into

Nigeria or that they were refused access to government instrumentalities. Instead, the record
demonstrates that in 2004, Mrs. Timolini and her son travelled to Nigeria to meet the Managing
Director of the NNPC. No reason is given for why, between 1998 and 2004, there was no
travel to Nigeria.*°° As Claimants have not established the key elements for a claim under the
international minimum standard, the Tribunal cannot find a violation of the minimum standard

of treatment.

The Tribunal, likewise, cannot find a violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard,
including a duty to provide full protection and security. Claimants have not shown that there
was any connection between Respondent’s detention of Mr. Rooks (which Claimants have also
stated was “in connection with a disagreement over termination of a crude oil lifting contract
and to enforce its rights as a joint venture partner”°>') and Dr. Fadeyi or his potential concerns
of termination. Claimants have likewise not met their burden of establishing the elements of

a fair and equitable treatment or full protection and security claim.

E, Damages
The Tribunal cannot find that Respondent has any responsibility for losses suffered by

Claimants as alleged in these proceedings.

Having found no liability on the part of Respondent, the Tribunal need not proceed to discuss

damages other than in relation to costs, as set forth below.

Costs

A. The Parties’ Positions
(1) Claimants’ Position

In their Post-Hearing Brief, , Claimants request that the Tribunal order Respondent to pay the

costs associated with the present proceedings, including professional fees and disbursements,

“on a full indemnity basis.”*°? According to Claimants, the Tribunal is empowered by ICSID
Rule 28(1)(b), and the principle that succumbing parties pay should apply in international

arbitration. Claimants contend that their request is in line with the principle of full

 

compensation.

In their Observations on allocation of costs, Claimants invoke four principles established by
ICSID tribunals that ought to guide the present Tribunal: (i) tribunals have broad discretion to
allocate costs; (ii) the “costs follow the event” principle is almost universally accepted and
may be viewed as a general principle of international law; (iii) the conduct of the parties during
the proceeding may be taken into consideration in the costs allocation; and (iv) the costs must

be considered reasonable.***

Claimants also submit that the Respondent’s conduct caused the proceeding to be lengthy,

which further justifies an order by the Tribunal that Respondent should bear the Claimants’

reasonable costs.**°

Claimants further contend that their costs — i.e. legal fees, arbitration costs, and expenses— are
4.555

reasonable and justifie

Lastly, Claimants explain that Respondent is not entitled to recover its costs since the
representation of the Republic of Nigeria was offered “at no cost to Respondent” by its

counsel.°°7

(2) Respondent’s position

and order that they bear the entirety of the costs incurred in the present arbitration.***

In its Observations on Costs Allocation, Respondent submits that, should it prevail, it is entitled

to receive reimbursement of its expenses and costs on a full indemnity basis.°°°

Respondent explains that tribunals consider a number of factors when exercising their
discretion to allocate costs, such as the relative success of the parties, the quality of the claims,
the complexity of the issues, the reasonableness of the parties’ expenses, and the parties’
conduct during the proceeding. Respondent adds that “[a]// of these factors support an award
to the Respondent of all of its costs in this arbitration because the Federal Republic of Nigeria
has been forced to go through the arbitral proceedings in order to achieve success, and should

not be penalized by having to pay for the process itself.”°°

Respondent further contends that not only should Claimants’ claims fail, whether for want of
jurisdiction or on the merits, but they should never have been brought before ICSID and have
been registered by the Centre on the basis of Claimants’ misrepresentation with respect to the

registration of their investment under the NIPC Act.>°!

Respondent also submits that Claimants’ misconduct throughout the proceeding warrant an
allocation of costs in favour of Respondent, including because such conduct increased the costs

of the arbitration.*°

Respondent then explains that it is entitled to recover all of its costs notwithstanding the fact
that it has been represented by the law firm Afe Babalola & Co at no cost throughout the

proceeding.

Respondent submits that its costs, comprised of arbitration costs, legal costs, witness costs,

travelling and accommodation expenses, and disbursements, are entirely reasonable, and that,

B. The Tribunal’s Decision on Costs

374. Article

61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:

“Tn the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the
parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in
connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those

115

 

 

375.

376.

377.

378.

379.

380.

381.

expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the

charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such

decision shall form part of the award.”
This provision gives the Tribunal discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration, including
attorney’s fees and other costs, such as arbitration costs, expenses and disbursements, between

the Parties as it deems appropriate.

The Tribunal has carefully considered the Parties’ respective submissions, filed by both sides
first on 8 June 2020 and then again by both sides on 30 June 2020. The Tribunal will first

address legal costs, and then all other costs.

The Tribunal accepts that Respondent has prevailed, and that a “costs follow the event”

principle might normally lead to recuperation of legal fees.

Under the circumstances of this case, however, no legal costs have been incurred by

Respondent. Thus no legal costs can be awarded to Respondent.

Respondent was represented pro bono by Aare Afe Babalola & Co, which confirmed having
served in this matter without compensation. The firm of Volterra Fietta, and Ms. Rose Rameau,

were supporting counsel in the legal team lead by Afe Babalola & Co.**

This pro bono representation has been acknowledged by the Respondent and its counsel, as
has the supporting role of Volterra Fietta and Ms. Rose Rameau. In this connection, the
Tribunal notes communications received by Mr. Garel at ICSID, sent by the Nigerian Attorney-

General on 27 October 2016 and by the Afe Babalola & Co firm on 29 October 2016.

The Attorney General on 27 October 2016 confirmed that “Afe Babalola & Co offered their
services to the Respondent in relation to this present proceedings at no cost for the Respondent.
[...] As earlier stated in my letter of 4 August 2016, in proffering a robust defence to the
Respondent, Are Afe Babalola of Afe Babalola & Co has also engaged the firm of Volterra

Fietta and Ms. Rameau at no cost to the Respondent.”

116

382.

383.

386.

Two days later, Afe Babalola & Co. stated as follows: “As confirmed in the letter of the
Attorney General of 27th October, 2016 my firm's representation of the Federal Republic of

Nigeria in these proceedings is at absolutely no cost to the government.”

On this basis, the Tribunal cannot but acknowledge that the Republic of Nigeria, Respondent
in these proceedings, has not incurred any legal costs, and, consequently, cannot order the

reimbursement to the Respondent of legal costs that it has not incurred.

With respect to all other costs, the Tribunal considers, in principle, that the “costs follow the
event” approach applies and that, consequently, Claimants would have to reimburse to
Respondent all other costs it incurred in defending Claimants’ claims. However, the amounts
claimed by the Respondent under the Witness Costs, Travelling and Accommodations
Expenses, and Disbursements categories have given rise to much doubt among the Tribunal
members about their genuineness and accuracy, as explained below. The Tribunal finds itself

therefore unable to order the reimbursement of these costs by Claimants to Respondent.

The Tribunal finds the amount claimed under the Travelling and Accommodations Expenses
category, i.e. USD 1,270,000.00, to be unreasonably high. The Tribunal understands that a
Nigerian delegation had to travel to and stay in London on four different occasions, and that
the resulting costs would necessarily be higher than that of Claimants, but the amount claimed
is over 10 times higher than Claimants’ and seems to reflect opulent, if not sumptuous choices
made by Respondent. The Tribunal considers that it would be unfair to order Claimants to bear
the financial consequences of the travelling and accommodation choices made by Respondent

when such choices have driven the costs to over a million dollars.

The Tribunal finds the amounts claimed under the Witness Costs category to be odd. Not only
are the costs claimed for Engr. Bello and Prof. Atsegbua identical, i.e. USD 50,986.59 each,
which seems highly unlikely, but they each are exactly half of the costs claimed with respect
to Justice Ayoola, i.e. USD 101,973.18. It is as if the Respondent has divided by two the costs
of Justice Ayoola to establish and claim the costs of Engr. Bello and Prof. Atsegbua. In
addition, the fact that the costs claimed with respect to Daniel Harris is a round figure of
USD 400,000 seems artificial and therefore unlikely to reflect reality. The Tribunal is unable

to order the reimbursement of these costs when the amounts claimed are so obviously odd.

117

387.

388.

389.

566

The Tribunal also finds the amounts claimed under the Disbursements category to be odd.
First, they all are round figures, which seems artificial and therefore unlikely to reflect reality.
Second, the amount claimed as “Hyperlink of processes and documents”, i.e. USD 30,000
seems greatly exaggerated, especially when it does not appear than any of the Respondent’s
submissions or even lists of supporting documents were hyperlinked at all. The Tribunal is
unable to order the reimbursement of these costs when the amounts claimed are so obviously

odd.

The Tribunal will apply the “costs follows the event” principle to the arbitration costs. The
costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal ICSID’s administrative

fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):

Arbitrators’ fees and expenses
Professor William W. Park USD 369,949.75
Professor Julian D.M. Lew USD 122,379.18

Justice Edward Torgbor USD 443,062.37
ICSID’s administrative fees USD 254,000.00
Direct expenses USD 130,868.44
Total USD 1,320,259.74

The above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in equal parts.*°° As
a result, each Party’s share of the costs of arbitration amounts to USD 660,129.87. Claimants
shall therefore reimburse USD 660,129.87 to Respondent with respect to costs of the

arbitration.

‘The remaining balance will be reimbursed to each side in proportion to payments advanced to ICSID.

Award
For the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides as follows:
(1) Jurisdiction

The Tribunal confirms its 29 October 2014 Decision on Preliminary Objections, deciding at
paragraph 147 that Objection No. | related to Consent would be rejected insofar as it calls into
question whether Section 26 of the NIPC Act constitutes a standing offer to arbitrate. The

Tribunal found that Section 26 did indeed constitute such a standing offer.

The Tribunal also confirms its Decision to reject Objections No. 2 (Role of the ICSID Rules),
No. 4 (Proper Party) and No. 5 (Time Bars).

With respect to the other jurisdictional objections, the Tribunal in this Award rejects the
Objection related to the adequacy of the Claimants’ acceptance of that offer to arbitrate and

the existence of a dispute.
The Tribunal also rejects Objections No. 3 (Registration) and No. 6 (Premature Filing).
(2) Liability

The Tribunal finds no liability on the part of Respondent in connection with Claimants’ loss

of control over their investment, Pan Ocean.

The Tribunal finds that Respondent has not breached its obligations toward Claimants under

Nigerian law or under international law.
The Tribunal hereby dismisses Claimants’ claims for damages and for restitution.

The Tribunal hereby dismisses Claimants’ claim to be reinstated as the beneficial owner of the

40% participating interest in OML 98.

The Tribunal hereby orders Claimants to pay USD 660,129.87 to Respondent as

reimbursement of its share of the arbitration costs incurred in these proceedings.

All other claims are dismissed.
