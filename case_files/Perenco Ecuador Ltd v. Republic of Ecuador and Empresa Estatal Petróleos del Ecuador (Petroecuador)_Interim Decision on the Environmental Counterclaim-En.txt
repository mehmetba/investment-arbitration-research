L INTRODUCTION

A. Parties

1. The Claimant is Perenco Ecuador Limited, and is hereinafter referred to as “Perenco” or
the “Claimant.”

2. The Respondent is the Republic of Ecuador and is hereinafter referred to as “Ecuador”
or the “Respondent.”

3. The Claimant and the Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Parties.”
The Parties’ respective representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).

B. Dispute

4. The dispute arises out of a series of measures adopted by the Respondent which,
according to Perenco, were in breach of Ecuador’s obligations under the Agreement between the
Government of the French Republic and the Government of the Republic of Ecuador on the
Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments (the “Treaty” or the “BIT”) and two
participation contracts for the exploration and exploitation of Blocks 7 and 21 (the “Blocks”)
situated in the Ecuadorian Amazonian region. The Tribunal ruled on these claims in its Decision
on Remaining Issues of Jurisdiction and on Liability, dispatched to the Parties on 12 September
2014.

5. During the course of the written submissions phase of the prior proceedings, on 5
December 2011, Ecuador presented two counterclaims pursuant to Rule 40 of the ICSID Rules
of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the “Arbitration Rules”).! These related to
allegations that Perenco is liable for environmental and infrastructural damage in Blocks 7 and
21. This interim decision will only address the environmental counterclaim.

! Ecuador’s Counter-Memorial on Liability and Counterclaims dated 5 December 2011 (“Ecuador’s Counter-

Memorial”), paragraph 26.

IL. PROCEDURAL HISTORY

6. On 13 July 2011, Ecuador informed the Tribunal that “it may submit various
counterclaims with its counter-memorial [on liability],” including those brought against
Perenco’s partner in Blocks 7 and 21, Burlington Resources (“Burlington”).”

7. On 28 July 2011, the Tribunal, in consultation with the Parties, fixed the procedural
calendar for the counterclaims.

8. On 17 November 2011, Ecuador requested a 10-day extension in which to file its
Counter-Memorial and its Counterclaims, due on 25 November 2011. Ecuador also confirmed
that “while further work is ongoing in Ecuador regarding the extent of the environmental damage
caused by Perenco, Ecuador will file on 5 December its counterclaim save as to quantum.”

9. On 21 November 2011, Perenco confirmed that “in principle, it had no objection to
reasonable schedule accommodations,”* but it sought assurances from Ecuador that it would file
its entire counterclaim on the proposed amended date.

10. On 24 November 2011, the Tribunal granted Ecuador’s request of 17 November and
amended the procedural calendar, providing Claimant’s with a similar extension of time. The
Tribunal also drew the Parties’ attention to ICSID Arbitration Rule 40(2)° and requested the
Respondent to “inform it at the time of the filing of its counter-claim precisely what additional
steps it needs to undertake in order complete its counter-claim, so that the Claimant is able to
respond thereto having regard to the procedural schedule as amended.”°

11. On 5 December 2011, Ecuador filed a Counter-Memorial on Liability and Counterclaims
(“Ecuador’s Counter-Memorial”). It was accompanied by the witness statements of Dr. Galo
Chiriboga Zambrano, Mr. Pablo Luna, Mr. Diego Montenegro, Mr. Derlis Palacios, Mr. Wilson
Pastor Morris, Mr. Germdnico Pinto, Mr. Marco Puente, Mr. Manuel Solis, the third witness
statement of Dr. Christian Davalos, and the expert reports of Integrated Environmental
Management Services S.A. de C.V. (IEMS), Mr. Brian Moree QC, RPS Energy, Fair Links, Mr.
Ricardo Crespo Plaza and Professor Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade (third).

12. On the same date, Ecuador answered the Tribunal’s request of 24 November by noting
that its environmenrtal expert IEMS “is currently undertaking the final stage of its three-stage
environmental audit of areas within Blocks 7 and 21 of the Ecuadorian Amazon Region. The

 

2 Ecuador also advanced similar counterclaims against Perenco’s consortium partner, Burlington Resources
Inc. (“Burlington”) ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5. After consultation with the parties, the Burlington tribunal chose to
confine the hearing on liability in March 2011 to the claims advanced by Burlington and to have a separate hearing
on the counterclaims. The tribunal’s Decision on Liability on Burlington’s claims was dispatched to the parties on
14 December 2012. See Burlington Resources, Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Decision on
Liability (14 December 2012) [hereinafter Burlington v. Ecuador].
See Ecuador’s letter to the Tribunal dated 17 November 2011.
4 See Perenco’s letter to the Tribunal dated 21 November 2011.

5 Rule 40(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provides that “a counter-claim [shall be presented] no later than

in the counter-memorial, unless the Tribunal, upon justification by the party presenting the ancillary claim and upon
considering any objection of the other party, authorizes the presentation of the claim at a later stage in the
proceeding.”

See Tribunal’s letter to the Parties dated 24 November 2011.

purpose of this final stage is twofold: (i) to quantify the volume of contaminated soil and
underground water pollution in some of the locations that IEMS has already determined, through
laboratory analysis, are significantly contaminated; and (ii) to confirm the existence of
contamination in other areas identified in its report where IEMS’ investigation has led to indicia
of pollution.”

13. On 4 January 2012, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it intended to hold a telephone
conference on 13 January 2012 to “consider the further procedural calendar covering not only
Perenco's claim (including the remaining jurisdictional issues) and Ecuador's counterclaims, but
also the issues of the quantum in relation to the main claim and the counterclaim.”*

14. On 13 January 2012, the Tribunal held a telephone conference with the Parties and
invited them to reach agreements on the procedural calendar.

15. On 19 January 2012, the Parties confirmed to the Tribunal that: “Ecuador has no
objection to releasing Perenco from the 12 April 2012 date for the filing of its Counter-Memorial
on Counterclaims. This is premised on the understanding that Perenco has no objection to
Ecuador submitting a supplemental memorial on its counterclaims (including a supplemental
report by IEMS) (i) before Perenco submits its Counter-Memorial on Counterclaims and (ii), in
any event, not earlier than 30 April 2012.”°

16. On 3 February 2012, the Parties informed the Tribunal of their agreement regarding the
procedural calendar for the counterclaims. '°

17. On 13 February 2012, the Tribunal fixed a new procedural calendar in light of the
agreement reached by the Parties. '!

18. On 27 April 2012, the Respondent filed a Supplemental Memorial on Counterclaims (the
“Supplemental Memorial”). It was accompanied by the second witness statements of Mr. Pablo
Luna and Mr. Diego Montenegro, and the second expert report of IEMS.

19. On September 28, 2012, Perenco filed a Counter-memorial on Counterclaims
(“Claimant’s Counter-Memorial”). It was accompanied by the witness statements of
Mr. Wilfrido Saltos, Mr. Eric d'Argentré (third), and Mr. Alex Martinez, and the expert reports
of GSI Environmental, Intertek APTECH, and Prof. René Bedén.

20. On 9 January 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 concerning Ecuador’s
request for production of documents regarding its counterclaims. '*

21. On 5 February 2013, the Parties agreed to extend the deadline for Ecuador to submit its
Reply on Counterclaims, with a corresponding extension to Claimant’s deadline to submit its
Rejoinder on Counterclaims.

22. On 12 February 2013, the Tribunal adopted the procedural calendar as modified by the
Parties.

Ill. ENVIRONMENTAL COUNTERCLAIM
A. Introduction

34. Ecuador presented the environmental counterclaim on the basis that its experts had
determined the existence of an “environmental catastrophe” in the two oil blocks situated in the
country's Amazonian rainforest that had been worked by the consortium under Perenco's
operatorship.'? Ecuador viewed this as an extremely serious matter deserving the most careful
consideration by the Tribunal.'* On this point, the Tribunal cannot but agree. Proper
environmental stewardship has assumed great importance in today’s world. The Tribunal agrees
that if a legal relationship between an investor and the State permits the filing of a claim by the
State for environmental damage caused by the investor’s activities and such a claim is
substantiated, the State is entitled to full reparation in accordance with the requirements of the
applicable law.

35. The Tribunal further recognises that a State has wide latitude under international law to
prescribe and adjust its environmental laws, standards and policies in response to changing views
and a deeper understanding of the risks posed by various activities, including those of extractive
industries such as oilfields. All of this is beyond any serious dispute and the Tribunal enters into
this phase of the proceeding mindful of the fundamental imperatives of the protection of the
environment in Ecuador.

(wD Summary of the Parties’ Submissions

36. Ecuador has requested the Tribunal to find Perenco liable for the costs of remedying
environmental damage in Blocks 7 and 21, quantified at US$ 2,279,544,559 for soil clean-up
costs, US$ 265,601,700 for groundwater remediation costs and US$ 3,380,000 for further
groundwater studies (subject to payment of compound interest from the date of the Award until
the date of full payment).!> It asserted that Perenco “abandoned Blocks 7 and 21 in a state which
makes a mockery of the nowadays universal, well-established legal principles aimed at

conclusion, IEMS confirm its original findings and conclusions. Some minor adjustments are warranted to the
volumes of the contaminated soil and estimated costs for soil remediation, which is estimated at $2,279,544,559
USD (considering exceedances of background levels) or $831,125,954 USD (if remediation is limited to
concentrations exceeding regulatory criteria). Groundwater remediation will cost and between [sic] $41,277,600 and

9, 416, 418-419, 425; Ecuador’s Reply Memorial on Counterclaims dated 22 February 2013 (“Reply”), paragraphs
542, 544-545. In its Counter-Memorial, Ecuador’s request was for Perenco to be found liable to remedy any and all
environmental damage in Blocks 7 and 21 and in lieu of this be made to pay the full costs of remedying said
damage. Ecuador submitted that since Perenco has left the Blocks and the Participation Contracts terminated, it is no
longer in a position to itself go about remedying the damage and is thus required to bear the burden of the costs of
Ecuador being made to do so in its stead. See Ecuador’s Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 692-696.

   

 

protecting the environment.”!® Such principles are said to be reflected in both Ecuadorian law
and in the Consortium’s obligations under the Participation Contracts.'’ In particular, the 2008
Constitution expressly prescribes a regime of strict liability (“responsabilidad objetiva’) for
environmental damage and establishes that the Ecuadorian people have the fundamental right to
a healthy environment.'® The strict liability regime reflects the “polluter-payer principle”,
defined by Ecuador as the proposition that “[h]Je who causes pollution must, under all
circumstances, assume the costs of repairing it.”!? Ecuador submitted that under this regime it
“need only establish the existence of environmental damage and that such damage is found in
Blocks 7 and 21, where Perenco operated, that is, where it performed petroleum activities, for
Perenco to be strictly liable to the State.””° It asserted this was the case both before and after the
2008 Constitution’s entry into force, since the Ecuadorian courts have since 2002 applied a strict
liability regime to claims of environmental damage resulting from hazardous activities.”!

37. Ecuador maintained that it was “common ground between the Parties” that petroleum
exploration and exploitation activities are hazardous activities that “inherently put the
environment at risk.”?? Accordingly, oil operators in Ecuador must exercise “a very high
standard of care in their operations, especially where, as here, Perenco operated within highly
environmentally fragile areas in the Amazon rainforest.”?* Ecuador alleged that Perenco failed to
operate Blocks 7 and 21 in accordance with the requisite degree of care, “knowing perfectly well
the significant environmental impact its operations were having”, because it was “more
concerned with running its operations at very low cost” and, further, that it had “failed to take
proper steps to prevent such damage or [to] repair the damage.”**

38. Indeed, quite apart from its alleged failure to adhere to its duty of care, Perenco was
alleged to have exercised a “strategy of deceit and concealment towards the Ecuadorian
authorities” in “systematically [seeking] to mislead the Ecuadorian authorities as to the existence
and extent of the environmental damage” in the Blocks.” Ecuador contended that documents

produced by Perenco in this arbitration demonstrated that Perenco chose not to notify Ecuador of
at least 41 spills that occurred in the Blocks during its operatorship.°

39. It alleged further that Perenco has sought to evade its liability for environmental damage
in the Blocks by relying on a set of environmental audits of Blocks 7 and 21 commissioned by
the Consortium in 2008 and submitted to the Ministry of Energy and Mines, later the Ministry of
Non-Renewable Natural Resources (“the Ministry”), for approval.2”? While the 2008 audits
found several minor non-compliances with regulatory requirements in Block 7, they ultimately
concluded that the Consortium’s operations in the Blocks complied with Ecuadorian
environmental regulations.”*

40. Ecuador submitted that this was false as a matter of fact and law, and pointed to different,
and in its view more credible, results of a technical inspection that it commissioned in August
2009, shortly after the government intervened to take possession of the Blocks when the
Consortium suspended operations.?? Ecuador characterised the 2008 audits as flawed, and
rejected Perenco’s claim that they had been approved by the Ministry.*” Even if they had been
approved, Ecuador contends, such ministerial approvals could not constitute a full defence under
its law in a subsequent proceeding for environmental liability such as the present one.*!

Al. In seeking to prove its environmental claim, Ecuador relied on the evidence of its experts,
Integrated Environmental Management Services S.A. de C.V. (“ITEMS”) of Monterrey, Mexico,
to submit that there was “significant environmental damage to soil and underground water in
Blocks 7 and 21.”>? IEMS found that the soil in 94% of the 74 locations it tested in Blocks 7 and
21 were contaminated as a result of petroleum activities, as were all of the 18 sites it tested for
groundwater contamination.**

42. Ecuador also submitted three reports by the Energy Division of RPS Group (“RPS”), an
international consultancy that provides advice on the development of natural resources, land and
property, and the management of the environment.*+ RPS’s reports initially addressed the risk
and existence of damage to the wells and reservoirs in Blocks 7 and 21 as a result of the shut-in

of wells in July 2009,*° and, as the expert evidence was sequentially developed in the
counterclaim, on what RPS considered to be the “flaws in [Perenco’s environmental experts,
GST’s] site investigation program.”*° Ecuador relied on the first two RPS reports chiefly for the
purposes of the claims brought by Perenco that were the subject of the Decision on Remaining
Issues of Jurisdiction and on Liability. RPS’s third report, of February 2013, sought to rebut
GSI’s expert report, concluding that GSI’s “opinion...[was] not correct” and that RPS’s review
of record evidence contradicted GSI’s conclusion that Perenco’s operations in the Blocks
complied with applicable regulations and industry practices.*”

43. For its part, Perenco submitted that the Tribunal should dismiss Ecuador’s environmental
claim in its entirety and award costs in its favour and such other and further relief as the Tribunal
deemed just and proper.** Perenco emphatically rejected Ecuador’s depiction of the condition of
Blocks 7 and 21 as an “environmental catastrophe.”*° It submitted that, to the contrary, Perenco
was a “responsible manager that focused on, preserved, and even improved the environmental
and infrastructural integrity of the Blocks” and the environmental counterclaim was a transparent
attempt by Ecuador to create a counterweight to, and divert attention from, the serious breaches
of contract and Treaty that formed the basis of Perenco’s claim.*”

44, Perenco also contended that Ecuador’s environmental claim was deficient as a matter of
law.*! Under the applicable Ecuadorian law, the claim, which concerned alleged contamination
from activities Perenco undertook in the Blocks from 2002 to July 2009, was governed by a
fault-based, not strict liability, regime, “since any changes made by the 2008 Constitution (which
entered into force in October 2008) [could not] have any retroactive effect.”*? Perenco observed
it would be inconsistent with the Constitution’s proscription against the retroactive application of
law to hold it to a regime that did not apply for most of the time that it operated the Blocks.**

45. Under the regime applicable prior to the 2008 Constitution’s entry into force, an operator
could not be found liable for environmental damage if it had complied with its duty of care to act
as a responsible operator.“ Since Perenco could prove it had satisfied its duty of care, there

Perenco in its Rejoinder submitted that Ecuador had acknowledged that “it would be improper for Ecuador to obtain
double recovery as a result of having asserted the same counterclaims against both Perenco and Burlington” cf.
Reply, paragraphs 551-553. Perenco further submitted that if the Tribunal “were to find that liability exists for
environmental conditions created by Ecuador’s State-owned oil companies, it should order Ecuador to provide an
indemnity against third-party claims arising from those conditions.” (Rejoinder, paragraph 435).

could be no finding of liability.*° Even if a strict liability regime did apply (which was not
conceded), Ecuador still bore the burden of proving that “the Consortium caused environmental
harm — i.e. an environmental effect that exceed[ed] applicable regulatory limits.”*°

46. Ultimately, Perenco submitted that Ecuador must “cumulatively establish for each site
[claimed to be contaminated] that: (/) the Consortium engaged in a wrongful (negligent or
malicious) act in breach of its duty of care; (2) Ecuador suffered harm (i.e. environmental
damage consisting of a regulatory exceedance); and (3) a causal nexus [that] exist[ed] between
the wrongful act and Ecuador’s alleged harm.”*’ If it succeeded in proving the foregoing,
Ecuador then bore the burden of proving “the quantum of the loss suffered as a consequence of
the harm.”**

47. Perenco argued further that quite apart from the foregoing legal requirements for
establishing liability, the environmental counterclaim was subject to temporal limits.*? At one
end of the events in question, i.e., in relation to damage caused after the government’s July 2009
takeover of the two Blocks, Perenco obviously could not be held liable for damage caused by the
operator which succeeded it, namely, Petroamazonas.°° As for the other end of the events in
question, Perenco argued that it could not be liable for any damage that predated January 2007,
the maximum permissible period for claiming damage under the four-year statute of limitations
prescribed by Ecuadorian law.*!

48. Putting the legal issues aside, on the matter of the evidence submitted by Ecuador in
support of its claim, Perenco submitted there were “systematic” and “fundamental” flaws in the
methodology employed by IEMS when investigating the Blocks, with the result that its findings
were invalid.** As for the RPS report, it was a “hypothetical assessment” of risks and did not
lend further credence to IEMS’ findings.* In Perenco’s view, rather than a US$2.4 billion cost

45 Claimant's Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 498-504. Perenco does not accept that it bears the burden of
proof to demonstrate that it had satisfied its duty of care; its submission is that Ecuador must establish for each site
that the Consortium engaged in wrongful (negligent or malicious) conduct in breach of its duty of care: s

of remediation, the more realistic cost was “under US$10 million.”*4 This related to “minor
regulatory exceedances” posing no “threat to human health or the environment.”>°

49, Having investigated the blocks, Perenco’s expert, GSI Environmental, Inc. (“GSI”),
opined that there were “no widespread environmental impacts, no impacts to groundwater and
only limited impacts to soil, no risk to human health and livestock, and no impacts to surface
water, air quality or ecological resources.”*° GSI analysed sampling results from its own and
TEMS’ field investigation, visiting 58 sites, most of which were sites at which IEMS had found
exceedances.*”

50. In both Perenco’s and GSI’s view, the exceedances resulted mainly from Ecuador’s (and
its experts’) insistence on employing so-called “background values” (Perenco’s preferred
translation of the relevant provision of TULAS) or “base values” (Ecuador’s preferred
translation), rather than the regulatory criteria prescribed by Ecuadorian law.** IEMS had in the
first instance compared its soil samples to the alleged background values (i.e., the normally
occurring incidences of certain elements in the natural environment) and where such values had
been exceeded, IEMS had concluded that the samples were contaminated by oilfield activities.
Perenco argued that Ecuadorian law recognised that oilfield activities inevitably result in a
measure of contamination, but that law prescribed acceptable levels of contaminants resulting
from permitted activities. The only relevant question, in Perenco’s view, was whether the
Consortium had exceeded the limits of the regulations applicable to its operations.°!

51. Perenco, GSI and its expert on geostatistical analysis, Dr. Shahrokh Rouhani, an
environmental scientist and founder of NewFields Companies, LLC, also strongly criticised
TEMS’ plotting of the alleged contamination in the two Blocks. IEMS employed a computer
software programme called ArcView GIS 10.0 to graphically map the extent of contamination

ss Claimant’s Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 18-21; Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 8, p 2270

(“limited pockets of areas potentially warranting remediation in Ecuador...scattered around at 17 si . They pose
no risk to human health, even on extraordinarily tough standards. ..all of them could be remediated for less than $11
million”) (Closing Statement of Mark Friedman).

Claimant’s Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 18-21. Perenco submitted in this regard that GSI had
demonstrated that these “minor exceedances” did not pose any threat to human health or the environment
(Claimant 's Counter-Memorial, paragraph 21).

See, for e.g., Claimant’s Counter-Memorial, paragraph 9. Perenco referred to it as the “average background
values” or “‘valores de fondo’ — i.e., the average level of substances naturally occurring in the environment in the
absence of any human intervention” (Claimant’s Counter-Memorial, paragraph 9 [Italics in original]). Ecuador used
the term “base values”, defining it is the “levels of concentration of contaminants naturally present in Blocks 7 and
21”: see Reply, paragraph 82. See also, Expert Opinion of Shahrokh Rouhani, Ph.D., P.E. Regarding Calculation of

which it said pervaded the Blocks.° GSI considered that this was inconsistent with the accepted
practice in the industry of employing site delineation, whereby a site that is considered to be
contaminated is delineated by taking samples in the immediate vicinity of the contaminated
sample and then working outwards from that point until the sampling no longer reveals any
contamination. For his part, Dr. Rouhani opined that IEMS’ use of the ArcView GIS 10.0
software was flawed and had led to a vast exaggeration of the contamination alleged to exist in
the two Blocks.

52. Perenco acknowledged that there was some minor evidence of contamination in the
Blocks, but submitted that once Ecuador’s use of background values rather than the regulatory
criteria that were actually applicable under Ecuadorian law was rejected as being legally
unsustainable, and once the proper land-use criteria were applied and the errors and inaccuracies
in IEMS’ methodology and findings were corrected, the volume of contaminated soil for which
Ecuador could possibly claim damages dropped from nearly 2 billion cubic metres of soil to only
33,415 cubic meters of soil, with the quantum of damages dropping commensurately. To be
specific, in Perenco’s submission, the potentially awardable damages dropped from
approximately US$2.4 billion to US$9.1 million.

53. In Perenco’s view, therefore, Ecuador’s counterclaims were “opportunistic” and had been
brought in “retaliation” for Perenco’s having seised the Tribunal with its contract and Treaty
claims.® Perenco asserted that from the time that the Government took over the Blocks on 16
July 2009 until 5 December 2011 (the date on which Ecuador first advanced its Counterclaim)
Ecuador gave “no prior indication that it had encountered environmental or infrastructural issues
or that it would make any such claims.”®” In fact, since the State’s taking over the Blocks,
Petroamazonas had not only operated the Blocks at their full capacity, it had expanded
operations.°*

54. For these and other reasons elaborated in its pleadings, Perenco requested the Tribunal to
dismiss the counterclaims and, amongst other relief, order Ecuador to reimburse it for all of its
costs on an indemnity basis.”

and outside Block 7’s boundaries; that field was then separately operated by Petroproduccién.”
At the time, the Coca and Payamino fields were thought to constitute different oil reservoirs and
it was only in 1987, when CEPE drilled the Payamino 2 well, that it was discovered that they
produced from a single reservoir.*° When Oryx acquired BP’s interest in September 1990, it also
entered into a joint operating agreement with Petroecuador for the Coca and Payamino fields.*!
The area was thereafter known as the Coca-Payamino Unified Field, with Oryx and
Petroproduccion taking turns acting as the operator.** Perenco emphasised that according to
TEMS’ data, this area (which had been worked for some time before Perenco appeared on the
scene) “accounts for 52% of Ecuador’s total soil contamination claims and 44% of its total
groundwater claims.”*?

59. In March 2000, the Block 7 Services Contract was terminated and replaced by the Block
7 Participation Contract.** This contract included the right to operate the Coca-Payamino Unified
Field.*° In May 2002, Perenco and Burlington began to acquire their respective interests in the

of the Yuralpa-Puerto Napo pipeline.°> When the Consortium assumed operations of Block 21 in
2002, the block had not been developed to the same extent as Block 7 and the Coca-Payamino
Unified Field. It contained a small number of wells and no operational CPF.*°

63. Ecuador submitted that in July 2009, Block 21 counted within it the Yuralpa field, the
Chonta, Waponi-Ocatoe and Dayuno platforms, two injection wells (Sumino and Nemoca), one
camp, one CPF, one waste management area and one pipeline (Yuralpa-Puerto Napo).°” Perenco
submitted that the producing field in Block 21, Yuralpa, “was largely developed by the
Consortium”, and by July 2009 it had “increased the number of wells in Yuralpa field from three
to 31.”

64. Perenco emphasised that in contrast to Block 7, which had been operated more
extensively for a longer period of time, Block 21 accounted for “only 8.3% of Ecuador’s soil
remediation claims and 16.7% of the total cost for groundwater remediation.”*? The inference to
be drawn, it appears, was that the lesser amount of contamination in Block 21 alleged by
Ecuador when compared to that alleged in respect of Block 7 indicated that any Block 7
contamination was most likely attributable to the actions of the Consortium’s predecessors rather
than to the Consortium itself.

B. The Framework of the Applicable Law

65. Ecuador began to develop an environmental regulatory regime for oilfield activities in the
1970s.!°° In 1971, it enacted the Hydrocarbons Law (Ley de Hidrocarburos); this was amended
in 1982 to oblige Petroecuador and its contractors to comply with national environmental laws
and regulations. !°! In its 1984 Constitution, Ecuador recognised the individual’s right to live in
an environment free from pollution and, in this connection, specified that the law should
necessarily establish “restrictions to the exercise of certain rights or liberties for the sake of
environmental protection.” !°?

66. In 1995 Ecuador promulgated the Environmental Regulations for Hydrocarbon
Operations in Ecuador (Reglamento Ambiental para las Operaciones Hidrocarburiferas en el

Ecuador (“RAOHE”') to regulate the exploration, development and production of crude oil,
oil derivatives and natural gas. It designated the Undersecretariat for Environmental Protection
and the National Directorate of Environmental Protection as the competent authority in
environmental matters. !°

67. From 1995 to 2001, the principles of prevention, rehabilitation and prevention of
environmental harm were introduced by Ecuador into its Constitution, and the 1999
Environmental Management Law (Ley de Gestién Ambiental) was enacted.'® In 2001, the
RAOHE was amended by Decree 1215 which introduced contaminant limits for soil. 106 Tn 2002,
the Regulation of Hydrocarbon Operations (Reglamento de Operaciones Hidrocarburiferas
(“ROH”)) was promulgated.'°’ ROH differed from RAOHE in that it did not address
contaminant limits or regulatory requirements relating to audits and reporting to the Ministry;
rather it addressed specific steps in the hydrocarbon production process, such as in the drilling or
sealing of a well, and how they should be carried out by the operator in such a way as to be

protective of the environment.!*

68. In 2003, Ecuador promulgated the Unified Text of Secondary Environmental Legislation
(Texto Unificado de Legislacién Ambiental Secundaria (“TULAS”)), which sets out rules for the
evaluation of the environmental impact of oilfield activities from a technical perspective to the
extent they are not addressed in environmental regulation specific to the type of activity in
question.'°? TULAS is of general application to all manner of activities that may cause an impact
on the environment.!!°

69. On 20 October 2008, Ecuador amended its Constitution.!!! The 2008 Constitution’s
relevance and significance for the counterclaim is an important matter and will be addressed in
further detail in the Tribunal’s decision below.

end of developments in environmental regulation in Ecuador. For instance, on 23 March 2009 the Ministry of the
Environment issued Ministerial Agreement No. 14 which established the procedure for environmental licensing of
hydrocarbon operations in Ecuador (see 1* Expert Report of René Bedén, Appendix B).

70. As a result of these developments, the legal regime in Ecuador recognises the protection
of the environment as a fundamental constitutional imperative. The 2008 Constitution is the
culmination of forty years of evolving Ecuadorian Constitutions and laws which have
systematically included major environmental legal protections. It recognises nature itself as the
subject of rights,!!? this realised through the enshrinement of environmental principles of
prevention and precaution,''? the right of the Ecuadorian people to a healthy environment,!'* a
broad notion of environmental harm, the doctrine of strict liability and the State’s obligation to
take prompt policies and measures to prevent environmental damage. !!>

71. For its part, Perenco characterises the regime as “a stringent and comprehensive system
of evaluation, permissible limits, remediation, monitoring, and reporting designed to limit
environmental impacts and keep the environmental authorities apprised of all developments and
incidents that occur in the course of hydrocarbon operations.”!!® It requires the submission and
approval of annual environmental audits and specifically-targeted environmental impact studies,
including environmental management plans for a proposed activity. It extends to the requirement
to notify the State of any spills of more than five barrels of oil,''” the submission of remediation
plans and the regular monitoring of air, water and soil quality against specific regulatory
standards. !!8

reproduced and occurs, has the right to integral respect for its existence and for the maintenance and regeneration of
its life cycles, structure, functions and evolutionary processes. All persons, communities, peoples and nations can
call upon public authorities to enforce the rights of nature. To enforce and interpret these rights, the principles set
forth in the Constitution shall be observed, as appropriate. [...].”

13 See, for e.g., Article 73 of Exhibit EL-89, 2008 Constitution: “The State shall apply preventive and
restrictive measures on activities that might lead to the extinction of species, the destruction of ecosystems and the
permanent alteration of natural cycles. The introduction of organisms and organic and inorganic material that might
definitively alter the nation’s genetic assets is forbidden.” And Article 90 of the 1978 Hydrocarbons Law: “Fixing

2008 Ecuadorian Constitution, !7! below which stands the Environmental Management Law, |
RAOHE!? and, where applicable, TULAS.!*4

74. Chapter Two of the Constitution, entitled ‘Biodiversity and Natural Resources’, addresses
the powers and duties of the State with respect to the environment and the environmental
protection imperatives upon which they are based.'*° In Section One (Nature and the
Environment), the principles of sustainable development, strict liability for environmental
damage, and the State’s obligation to act to ensure the “health and restoration of ecosystems” are
recognised.'?° Section Two (Biodiversity) declares the conservation of biodiversity to be a
matter of public interest, and Section Three (Natural Assets and Ecosystems) recognises the

76. As noted above, Ecuador submitted that under the 2008 Ecuadorian Constitution oil
operators in Ecuador are subject to a regime of strict liability for environmental harm and are
required to undertake the costs of remediation in full.!*! Ecuador directed the Tribunal’s
attention to Articles 395 and 396 of the Constitution which provide as follows:

Article 395.- The Constitution recognizes the following environmental
principles:

1. The State shall guarantee a sustainable model of development, one that
is environmentally balanced and respectful of cultural diversity,
conserves biodiversity and the natural regeneration capacity of
ecosystems, and ensures meeting the needs of present and future
generations.

2. Environmental management policies shall be applied and shall be of
mandatory enforcement by the State at all of its levels and by all
individuals or legal entities in this country’s territory.

3. The State shall guarantee the active and standing participation of
affected persons, communities, peoples and nations in the planning,
implementation and monitoring of all activities causing environmental
impacts.

4. In the event of doubt concerning the scope of the legal provisions as
regards environmental issues, their most favorable interpretation for the
protection of nature shall obtain. !**

Article 396.- The State shall adopt timely policies and measures to avoid
adverse environmental impacts where there is certainty about the
damage. Should there be any doubt regarding the environmental impact
stemming from an action or omission, although there is no scientific
evidence of the damage, the State shall adopt effective and timely
measures of protection.

Liability for environmental damage is strict. Any harm to the
environment, in addition to the corresponding penalties, shall also give
rise to an obligation to fully restore the ecosystems and compensate the
individuals and communities affected.

Each of the participants in the production, distribution,
commercialization and usage processes of goods and services shall be
directly liable for preventing any environmental impact, mitigating and

130 Exhibit EL-89, 2008 Constitution, p 126 of PDF. For water, the relevant provision is Article 411 of the
2008 Constitution: “The State shall guarantee the conservation, recovery and complete management of water
resources and ecological flows associated with the water cycle. Any activity that may affect the quality and amount
of water and the equilibrium of ecosystems shall be regulated, particularly in water replenishment sources and
zones.” (unofficial translation).

repairing the damages it has caused, and for maintaining a permanent
environmental monitoring system.

The legal proceedings to prosecute and punish those responsible for
environmental damages shall be imprescriptible.'*

77. Ecuador submitted that Article 396, in particular paragraph 3 thereof, established a strict
liability regime which placed the burden on the operator to prove that any environmental harm
was caused by another person in order for the operator be exonerated from its own
responsibility.'*4 Ecuador asserted that the operator was required to prove that the harm was
caused “exclusively” by another person. !*°

78. The import of these provisions and the Parties’ submissions relating thereto will be
examined in greater detail below. It suffices to note for present purposes that with regard to the
remedy sought by Ecuador in this proceeding, its submission is that since Perenco has left the
Blocks and is as such no longer in a position to “restore [its] ecosystems” as required by Article

396, paragraph 2, Ecuador is entitled to claim monetary damages in lieu from Perenco. !*°
(2) The Environmental Management Law
79. The Environmental Management Law (Ley de Gestién Ambiental) was enacted on 30

July 1999 to implement certain environmental principles adopted by the 1998 Constitution, such
as sustainable development!*” and the liability of State agencies and concessionaries for
environmental harm. '*

80. Article 1 of the Law explains that it “establishes the principles and guidelines of
environmental policy, determines the obligations, responsibilities, levels of participation of the
public and private sectors in environmental management and indicates the permissible limits,
controls and sanctions in this matter.”'*? Chapter I refers to sustainable development and the
obligations of State institutions in environmental protection and regulation.'4° Chapter II

33 EL-89, 2008 Constitution, p 123 of PDF. Ecuador further relied on Article 11(3) of the Constitution,
ising that it provided that its provisions were of “direct and immediate application”. “The rights and
s set forth in the Constitution and in human rights international instruments shall be of direct and
immediate application by and before any public servant, administrative or judicial, ex officio or upon request by a
party.” (Unofficial translation from Spanish original: “[l]os derechos y garantias establecidos en la Constitucién y

addresses generally the regulation of environmental management systems in Ecuador,'*! for
example, “requir[ing] environmental impact studies” as a prerequisite for issuing an
environmental license. '¥? It also includes a glossary of definitions. '4? “Contamination” is defined
as “[t]he presence in the environment of substances, elements or energies or a combination of
them, in concentrations and duration superior or inferior to those established in the legislation in
force.”'“4 The Law’s definitions of “environmental harm” and “environmental impact” are
discussed below.

81. One of Ecuador’s legal experts, Professor Ricardo Crespo Plaza, explained that the
Environmental Management Law was inspired by the content of international instruments
relating to environmental protection, such as the Rio Declaration, which, according to Article 3
of the Law, is a “guiding instrument for Ecuador’s environmental policy.”!*> Ecuador relied on
the Environmental Management Law in its submissions in support of a broad definition of the
term “environmental harm” (addressed below). !#° Perenco’s legal expert, Dr. René Bedén,
asserted that “[t]he regulations and ministerial accords issued in order to regulate the
Environmental Management Law, together with other previously issued regulations, were
compiled in TULAS.”!7

82. The precise relationship between RAOHE, TULAS and the Environmental Management
Law is a matter of dispute between the Parties. For present purposes, the Tribunal notes that two
provisions of the Environmental Management Law lie at the heart of this disagreement.'® They
appear in its glossary and define the terms “environmental harm” and “environmental impact”:

Environmental Harm. — Any significant loss, diminution, detriment or
impairment of the preexisting conditions in the environment or one of its
components. It affects the functioning of the ecosystem or the
renewability of its resources.

Environmental Impact. — The positive or negative alteration of the
environment, provoked directly or indirectly by a project or an activity in
a given area.'?

83. The crux of the Parties’ dispute is whether: (i) an operator which stays within the limits
prescribed by the regulations may create an impact upon the environment which leaves it in a
different state from that which existed prior to the commencement of hydrocarbon operations,
but such impact is nevertheless considered to be a permissible change and is not to be equated

Ma Exhibit CA-CC-33, Environmental Management Law, defined in its glossary as “[t]he body of closely

linked policies, norms, operative and administrative activities of planning, financing and control that must be carried
out by the State and society to guarantee sustainable development and the optimal quality of life.” (p 18 of PDF).

with an environmental harm and need not be remediated because it is an accepted and
sustainable environmental cost of exploiting hydrocarbons (Perenco’s position); or (ii) an
operator that stays within the limits prescribed by the regulations may still create an impact on
the environment which can also constitute an environmental harm which must be remediated
(Ecuador’s position). The Tribunal will revert to this disagreement in the course of its analysi:

(3) RAOHE

84. RAOHE contains 14 chapters and 6 annexes addressing many aspects of oil operations
that could have an impact on the environment.'*° It obliges operators to submit environmental
programmes and audits to the relevant Ministry (initially the Ministry of Energy and Mines, and
subsequently, the Ministry of Non-Renewable Natural Resources, and more recently, the
Ministry of the Environment), to undertake regular internal environmental monitoring and to
identify and report environmental incidents and propose remediation programmes. In so doing,
operators are required to apply “parameters, maximum benchmark values and permissible limits”
as set out in detail in RAOHE’s Annex II.'*! Article 86 of RAOHE provides “[flor liquid
discharges, atmospheric emissions and disposal of soil waste to the environment, the subjects of
control and their operators and related parties in the implementation of their operations shall
comply with the permissible limits specified in Annexes Nos. 1, 2 and 3 to this
Regulation...Should a permissible limit established in the annexes be exceeded, this must be
reported immediately to the Undersecretariat of Environmental Protection, and the corrective
actions taken must be justified.” !>?

 

85. Annex II comprises six tables (Tables 3 to 8) spelling out permissible limits or
benchmark values, such as for “atmospheric emissions” (Table 3), for “waters and liquids
discharges” in the exploration and production process (Table 4), for “discharges of black and
gray waters” (Table 5), for the “identification and remediation of contaminated soils in all phases
of the hydrocarbon industry” (Table 6), for leachates “for the final diposal of drilling muds and
cuttings on the surface” (Table 7), and finally, specifying the criteria for the classification of
waste from hydrocarbon operations and recommendations for their treatment and disposal (Table
8). 153

86. RAOHE’s Table 6 establishes different applicable criteria according to three types of
land use: industrial, agricultural and sensitive ecosystems.'** Its logic is that the limits of
permissible contamination are most stringent for sensitive ecosystems, Jeast stringent for
industrial areas, and agricultural lands fall in the middle. Footnotes to each of the different type
of land use state that the “agricultural land” use criteria is “focused on the protection of soils and
crops”, “industrial land” use criteria is intended “for industrial sites (buildings, etc.)” and
“sensitive ecosystems” criteria is for “the protection of sensitive ecosystems such as the National
Heritage of Natural Areas and others identified in the corresponding Environmental Study.”!°°

87. Table 6 states that the “permissible limits to be applied in a determined project depend on
the subsequent use (uso posterior) to be given to the remediated soil.”!°° The Parties dispute the
meaning of the word “posterior” in the context of RAOHE.

88. As Chart I below shows, depending upon the classification of the land in question,
different parameters relating to total hydrocarbons, polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons, cadmium,
nickel and lead are to be used in order to determine whether soil is contaminated:

 

CHART I
RAOHE Table 61°”

 

89. The classification of land usage is not the only possible criterion for judging which
parameter applies. Certain substances generated in oilfield activities may also be naturally
present in the soil of the area being exploited. For that reason, in the second introductory
paragraph to RAOHE’s Table 6 it is stated that “[i]f natural (non-contaminated) soils in the area
present concentrations higher than the established limits, the values of the respective parameter
may be increased to this level, so long as this phenomenon has been statistically verified through
monitoring of undisturbed and uninfluenced soils in the same area.” !8

90. RAOHE’s Table 7 establishes the permissible limits for the “final disposal on the
surface” of “drilling muds and cuttings” that contain “leachates.”!°? Its introductory paragraph
explains that the permissible limits “depen[d] on whether or not the final disposal site has
impermeabilization of the base.”!©° For example, the maximum permissible limit for barium is 5
mg/l where the storage site lacks bottom sealing, but 10 mg/l if the site has a sealed bottom.!°!
This differential treatment depends on whether the operator laid a proper containment barrier in
the bottom of the mud pit prior to disposing of drilling muds in the pit. It also requires that any
sampling that is carried out in this respect to be conducted “so as to obtain representative

160 Ibid. (partial translation resubmitted on 10-18-2013) Ecuador contended in this regard that Table 7 seeks to

determine whether there is a significant risk of the contaminants within a pit leaching and infiltrating the
surrounding area but that it must be applied together with Table 6 which determines whether the internal soil content
of the pits is in fact contaminated: Reply, section 3.1.5.

further mandates that the operator must comply with specific operational procedures and
requirements in disposing of drilling muds and test crude.'® The contents of any mud pit must
be treated until it complies with the permissible limits of Table 7 and a follow-up by means of
periodic sampling is required within seven days, three months and six months of storage. '*

91. Annex 5 of RAOHE, entitled “Analytical Method”, contains a table setting out, as its title
suggests, the analytical testing methods to be applied when investigating water quality (also, soil
and atmospheric emissions).'® It has three columns, the first identifying the parameter (electrical
conductivity, potential hydrogen, etc.); the second indicating the method (i.e., determination of
electrical conductivity by calibration at two electrode points); and the third noting the relevant
reference material (i.e., publications). 166 For example, testing whether barium, chromium, lead or
vanadium exceeds the applicable parameter requires filtration and acidification using Atomic
Absorption Spectroscopy.'©”

92. RAOHE further requires that operators must undertake certain environmental
programmes and audits. Article 10 requires operators to submit annual environmental
programmes and budgets to the Ministry.'°* An operator is also required to commission an
environmental impact study before the commencement of any new project, such study to be
submitted to and approved by the Ministry.'? Operators are required to submit annual
environmental reports that “describe and evaluate the budgeted environmental activities that
have been performed.”!”° The Ministry is empowered to request at any time additional reports on
specific activities undertaken by the operator.!’! Article 12 requires regular internal
environmental monitoring of emissions, liquid and solid discharges, and soils undergoing
remediation, the sampling points and results of which are to be submitted to the Ministry on a
monthly basis when the operator is in the process of drilling a well, and otherwise on a quarterly
basis.!”? Article 16 of RAOHE obliges operators to report spills of more than five barrels of

93. In addition, all operators are also required to commission a comprehensive environmental
audit at least once every two years, such audit to be conducted by an auditor and on such terms
as approved by the Ministry: '+

ART. 42. - Environmental Audit. - The Undersecretariat of
Environmental Protection, through the National Environmental
Protection Directorate, shall audit, at least every two years, or whenever
the Undersecretariat of Environmental Protection so orders upon
detecting noncompliance with the Environmental Management Plan, the
environmental aspects of the various hydrocarbons activities conducted
by the subjects of control [sic].

The Undersecretariat of Environmental Protection, through the National
Environmental Protection Directorate (DINAPA), shall determine the
type and scope of the Environmental Audit for the operations of the
subjects of control based on compliance with the Environmental
Management Plan.

At least every two years, the subjects of control shall conduct an
Environmental Audit of their activities, following approval of the
corresponding Terms of Reference by the Undersecretariat of
Environmental Protection, and they shall submit the respective audit
report to the Undersecretariat of Environmental Protection.

Additionally, the parties, upon the termination of hydrocarbons
exploration and exploitation, or in the event of a change of operator, shall
conduct the audit referenced in Art. 11 of the Regulation to Law 44,
amending the Hydrocarbons Law..

For purposes of the aforementioned audits, the subjects of control shall
select an environmental auditor qualified by the Undersecretariat of
Environmental Protection to carry out the monitoring and verification of
compliance with the Environmental Management Plan, in accordance
with the Terms of Reference previously approved by the
Undersecretariat of Environmental Protection, in which the documentary
framework is determined against which the audit shall be conducted.

3 Exhibit EL-147, RAOHE, Article 16. Article 16 uses the phrase “five barrels”. The interpretation of this
requirement was a matter of dispute between the Parties. Ecuador submitted that the operator was required to report
all spills, and not just spills of more than five barrels (Reply, paragraph 49). Perenco submitted that “the
Consortium’s practice was to report even more minor spills whenever those spills left the immediate confines of the
platform. In fact, over 40% of all the spills reported to the Ministry during the Consortium’s operatorship —
specifically, nine out of 22 total — consisted of volumes under five barrels.” (Claimant’s Counter-Memorial,
paragraph 134 cf. Rejoinder, paragraphs 299-302).
Exhibit EL-147, RAOHE, Article 42. (partial translation resubmitted on 10-18-2013).

94. Perenco submitted that it “consistently complied with government regulations’,
“obtain[ing] both prior and often ex post approvals for all activities that could potentially affect
the environment or alter the infrastructure of the Blocks” and performing all necessary
environmental audits.'> Moreover, “whenever an incident occurred that affected the
environment, the Consortium promptly notified the State, performed all required repairs,
remediation and cleanup, and obtained the State’s approval of the remediation.”!’° Notably,
Perenco relied on the Consortium’s practice of producing remediation plans and reports that
applied the criteria in Tables 6 and 7 of RAOHE to support its submission that those tables
provided the relevant remediation criteria that should be applied in this claim.'7”

95. In Ecuador’s view, Perenco’s position is “flatly contradicted” by the discovery of
“widespread, undisclosed and non-remediated contamination throughout the oilfield facilities
operated by the Consortium up to July 2009.”!”8 There were, in Ecuador’s view, “numerous and
significant failures by the Consortium to comply with the applicable Ecuadorian regulations”,
this made out on the basis of the documents on record in this arbitration, such as the
environmental audit reports commissioned by the Consortium in 2002, 2006 and 2008,
correspondence with the Ministry, and internal documents prepared by the Consortium.!”
Ecuador went so far as to assert that there was evidence that the “Consortium actively sought to
conceal environmental incidents from the Ecuadorian authorities.” !*°

96. Finally, it asserted that the criteria in RAOHE were not comprehensive; there were other
chemical indicators and heavy metals associated with hydrocarbons exploration and exploitation
that were not covered by RAOHE, such as electrical conductivity, pH, barium and vanadium, '*!
and the Consortium’s past interpretation of the applicable regulatory criteria cannot determine
conclusively the criteria that Ecuadorian law mandates be applied in an action for remediation of

environmental damage. '*?
(4) TULAS
97. Ecuador submitted that TULAS is relevant to the analysis of soil and groundwater

remediation under Ecuadorian law.'* It supported the basis for its Base Values case and was to
be applied together with RAOHE.'* This was because it addresses chemical indicators and

heavy metals associated with hydrocarbon operations that are not included in RAOHE, such as
electrical conductivity, pH, barium and vanadium.!*° It also provided that environmental audits
could not be used to exonerate an operator in an action for environmental damage.'**

98. For his part, Perenco’s expert, Dr. René Bedon, asserted that TULAS is applied in a
“general manner to all of those activities that may cause an impact that requires environmental
authorisation”, adding that “activities that have a specific regulation due to their subject matter,
such as those for hydrocarbons, mining or telecommunications, must be carried out pursuant to
said specific regulation and resort to the regulations of TULAS only in the absence of a specific
regulation, in which case TULAS will be applied in a supplementary manner.” '*7

99. TULAS also created a Single Environmental Management System which “contains the
guidelines for the environmental impact evaluation procedure and implementation of the
Decentralized Environmental Management System” and established the “State’s obligation to
perform environmental oversight of the regulated entities in order to ensure compliance with the
environmental management plans pursuant to what is established in the environmental license or
permit.” !88

100. As with other issues of law, there is a difference of opinion between the Parties as to the
precise relationship of TULAS to RAOHE. Ecuador considered that TULAS set forth “the rules
for the evaluation of environmental impact from a technical perspective. '*? Perenco did not share
this view; it submitted that RAOHE’s requirements and parameters trumped “more general
regulations such as [TULAS], except where the [RAOHE] is silent.”!°° In short, Ecuador gives
greater prominence to TULAS then Perenco does; for Perenco, RAOHE is the primary source of
regulation, with TULAS applying only in a backup or gap-filling manner.

101. Table 2, Annex 2, Book VI of TULAS, entitled ‘Soil Quality Standards’, sets out non-site
specific standards for the background values of 36 different elements that may be present in soil.
Article 4.2.1 explains that Table 2 sets out the quality criteria for soil, defining this as
“approximate background values or analytical detection limits for pollutants in the soil’,
“reflect[ing] the natural geological variations of undeveloped areas or areas free of the influence
of generalized industrial or urban activities.”'?! Ecuador relied on Table 2 in its alternative

102. Perenco observed that these values “can vary significantly from the actual properties of

criteria. Rather, Table 3, Annex 2, Book VI of TULAS was the rightful source of the applicable
regulatory criteria.!°> Table 3, entitled “Criteria for Remediation and Restoration of Soils” is
defined as “[s]tandards for Remediation or Restoration...established in accordance with the use

103. In this connection, the significance of Article 2.38 of Annex 2, Volume VI (Criteria for
Contaminated Soil Remediation) of TULAS was also a matter of dispute between the Parties. It
provides:

2.38 Background level

Denotes the prevailing environmental conditions, prior to any

disturbance. That is to say, it signifies the conditions that would have

predominated in the absence of anthropogenic activities, with only

natural processes being active.!”

104. Article 2.38 is located in the ‘definitions’ section of Annex 2 (i.e., “For purposes of the
application of this Standard, the following definitions apply:...”).?°° Ecuador asserted that this
was an example of TULAS’s express acknowledgment of Base Values: it “defines ‘quality
criteria’ of the soil as its ‘background values’, i.e., the chemical concentration levels prior to any
contamination.”?°! Ecuador added that according to TULAS, “any soils where concentrations of

contaminants exceed three times the Base Value must be ‘immediately’ remediated” and
“restored back to 1.5 times the Base Value.”

105. Perenco responded that this ignored the point that Article 2.38 was expressly predicated
on the absence of any human activities or development. It did not require remediation to the
untouched state of a site, and to interpret it as implicitly requiring the same would render
obsolete “the detailed regulatory regime setting forth permissible impacts from different types of
activity in different circumstances [...].”?°? Pertinently, the opening section to Annex 2 explains
that its purpose is to provide the technical standards (‘...issued under the umbrella of the
Environmental Management Law and the Regulation to the Environmental Management Law for
the Prevention and Control of Environmental Contamination and is subject to their provisions, is
of mandatory application, and is binding throughout the national territory”) that should be used
to “determine or establish” the “[s]tandards of general application for soils with different uses”,
etc.? The objective of Annex 2 is identified as establishing the “Environmental Standards” that
must be used by the State and its agencies in its “actions intended to preserve, conserve, or
recover the quality of soil resources.”?°°

 

106. Turning to the matter of groundwater remediation, Table 5, Annex 1, Book VI of TULAS
provides the “reference quality criteria for groundwater, considering a soil with clay content
between (0-25.0)% and organic material content between (0 -10.0)%.”? Article 4.1.3.6
introduces Table 5 and states that any alteration of the quality of groundwater triggers an
obligation to remedy the “contaminated groundwater and soil affected.”?°”

107. Ecuador’s environmental expert, IEMS, relied on Table 5 of TULAS to provide the
reference criteria that it applied to evaluate the concentration of TPH (Total Petroleum
Hydrocarbons) and heavy metals (zinc, lead, mercury, cadmium, arsenic, barium, cobalt, copper,
chromium, molybdenum and nickel) in the samples it collected.2? Perenco’s expert, GSI, took
issue with the filtration method adopted by IEMS and IEMS’ assertion that it was required to do
so by Table 5, Annex | of TULAS. In GSI’s view, IEMS should have used Annex 5 of RAOHE
instead.°

(5) The Participation Contracts

108. Having described in general terms the public law framework applicable to the claim, the
Tribunal now turns to the obligations Perenco undertook in the Participation Contracts for
Blocks 7 and 21.7!!

109. First, Perenco agreed to comply with all laws and regulations in Ecuador applicable to the
Participation Contracts.*!? Clause 5.1.18 of the Block 7 Contract, for example, provided:

Obligations of the Contractor: Without prejudice to the other
obligations contained in this Contract, the Contractor is obliged to:

5.1.18 Comply with and require that its subcontractors comply with all
laws, regulations and other provisions applicable to this Contract in the
Republic of Ecuador.”

110. Second, Perenco agreed to preserve the existing ecological equilibrium in the Blocks and
would clean up the area to allow the potential return to environmental conditions similar to those
encountered at the beginning of operations. But it would not be liable for pre-existing
“environmental conditions” (for Block 7, this referred to conditions that pre-existed the Service
Contract; for Block 21, this referred to conditions that pre-existed the Participation Contract).
Clause 5.1.20, opening paragraph, subsections (9), (10) and 5.1.21 of the Block 7 Contract and
Clause 5.1.19 and 5.1.20 of the Block 21 Contract provided:

[Block 7] Obligations of the Contractor: Without prejudice to the other
obligations contained in this Contract, the Contractor is obliged to:

5.1.20 Preserve the existing ecological equilibrium in the Contract Area,
to which end keeping all its activities within the pertinent standards in
force in the country and on the basis of the Environmental Impact
Studies, as stated in Annex No. XL...

5.1.20.9 Employ qualified personnel, equipment, machinery, materials,
operational procedures and, in general, technology which complies with
environmental protection standards and practices used in the
international hydrocarbons industry, without prejudice to compliance
with existing standards in the country.

5.1.20.10 Take responsibility for the cleanup and reforestation of the area
with species similar to those originally found at the site, in order to, with
time, allow the potential return to environmental conditions similar to
those encountered at the beginning of the operations; also take
responsibility for the abandonment of wells and installations for which
the Contractor has been responsible as a consequence of the execution of
this Contract. Said cleanup, reforestation and return to similar conditions
and abandonment activities shall be performed in accordance with the
Environmental Regulation for Hydrocarbon Operations and the
Environmental Impact Study. The Contractor shall not be liable for
environmental conditions preexisting at the beginning of operations
under the Services Contract. In cases in which the competent authorities
order the remediation of the environment in the Contract Area, due to
preexisting conditions, the costs and contracting [for this purpose] shall
not be the responsibility of the Contractor.

5.1.21 Cooperate with state entities responsible for control of
colonization in the Contract Area; however, the Contractor shall not be

damages caused by third parties within the Contract Area.7!4

[Block 21] 5.1 Obligations of the Contractor: Without prejudice to any
other obligations specific in the Contract, the Contractor undertakes to:

L..]

5.1.19 While conducting the operations, the Contractor shall take every
necessary measure to ensure the preservation and safety of lives and
properties and preserve the environment. The above notwithstanding, the
Contractor shall not be responsible for changes to the ecosystem caused
by third parties within the Contract Area.

5.1.20 The Contractor shall be responsible for the clean-up, reforestation,
and abandonment of non-productive wells and facilities as a result of this
Contract. These activities shall be carried out in accordance with the
legislation in effect in Ecuador at the time that such clean-up,
reforestation, or abandonment is carried out and as contemplated in the
Environmental Impact Study.

The Contractor shall not be responsible for pre-existing environmental
conditions at the start of the operations under the Contract.

In such cases where the competent authorities order mitigation of the
environment in the Contract Area due to pre-existing conditions, any
costs incurred in connection with such activities shall be assumed by the
Ecuadorian State.

Nor shall the Contractor be responsible for environmental conditions
resulting from operations by PETROECUADOR or third parties after the
Contract Area is returned by the Contractor.?!>

111. Third, the Contracts set out numerous reporting and audit requirements for Perenco;
specifically, it was obliged to prepare and submit to the appropriate Ministry the information and
audits commissioned in accordance with applicable regulations such as the Environmental
Management Law, RAOHE and TULAS.

112. These were provided for in the Block 7 Participation Contract in Clause 5.1.4 (“Carry out
the Environmental Impact Studies which may be necessary...”); 5.1.10 (“Provide the Ministry of
Energy and Mines with the original, and PETROECUADOR with one (1) copy, of all technical,
environmental and research information related to the Contractor’s activities...”); 5.1.11
(“Provide the Ministry of Energy and Mines with the originals of the Environmental Impact
Studies as well as their supporting documentation...”); 5.1.20.4 (“Any Environmental Studies
which may be required in the future for additional exploration or exploitation activities shall be
submitted in accordance with the Environmental Regulation for Hydrocarbon Operations in
Ecuador and with the Terms of Reference formulated by the relevant Ministry...”); 5.1.20.6

(‘Environmental Impact Studies shall serve as a base reference for socio-environmental audits
that must be conducted periodically by the relevant Ministry...”); and 5.1.20.7 (pre-termination
audit).7!¢

113. Similar obligations could be found in the Block 21 Contract, but they were expressed in
somewhat different terms given the Block’s green-field nature and the state of its development.
Clause 5.1.9 required Perenco to “provide the Ministry of Energy and Mines with the original
and PETROECUADOR with copies of all technical information...including those of a scientific,
environmental and technical nature...”.7!7 Clause 5.1.18 required the company to “perform an
Environmental Impact Study for the seismic prospection phase within the first six months
following the Effective Date. Therefore, prior to drilling the first exploratory well, an
Environmental Impact Study for the first phase of exploratory drilling must be submitted and,
finally, an Environmental Impact Study together with the Development Plan must be presented
before continuing on to the Exploitation Period... These studies shall be the basis for socio-
environmental audits that must be conducted periodically by the Ministry of Energy and Mines
to ensure that the Contractor’s operations are being carried out with the least impact on human
residential populations and the environment.”?!® Clause 5.5.5 referred to a comprehensive
environmental audit that had to be commissioned two years before the expiry of the Block 21
Contract.7!°

114. | The Block 7 Contract included a reference to an environmental impact study that the first
contractor was required to complete and submit to SPA for approval as a pre-condition for entry
into the Contract. Clause 5.1.20.3 stated that “[a]s of the Effective Date of this Contract, the
Contractor has completed the Environmental Impact Studies described in Annex Number XI, and
these studies have been submitted and approved by the Undersecretary of the Environment of the
relevant Ministry.”??° This provision does not appear in the Block 21 Contract.

Cc. The Parties’ Submissions on the Legal Issues

115. There was sharp divergence between the Parties on several areas regarding the
application of Ecuadorian law and Perenco's obligations under the Participation Contracts.

(wD Strict Versus Fault-based Liability

116. The Parties diverged on whether the regime that governed the counterclaim was fault or
strict liability based. They also disagreed on the precise way in which the regime that pre-dated
the 2008 Constitution operated, and the circumstances in which the regime of the 2008
Constitution would apply.

117. Ecuador submitted that for a claim brought after the Constitution’s entry into force, an oil
operator was liable under the strict liability regime if the State established that environmental

harm! existed in the areas in which the operator undertook hydrocarbon activities.?”” The

burden then shifted to the operator to prove that the environmental damage was
“insignificant.”*?> Ecuador noted in this respect that the Constituent Assembly of Ecuador,
during the drafting of the 2008 Constitution, referred to:

“A presumption of innocence [that] should be established in favor of the

environment. From. this perspective, the burden of proof must be shifted
to the defendant.

 

118. Accordingly, relying on the expert evidence of Professors Ricardo Crespo Plaza and
Fabian Andrade Narvéez, Ecuador contended that pursuant to Article 396 of the 2008
Constitution it was required to “only establish the existence of the environmental damage in
Blocks 7 and 21, where Perenco operated” for Perenco to be held liable.??> The State was not
required to demonstrate fault or that “there [was] a causal link between such a fault and the
environmental harm found on the areas where the oil operator conducted operations.”??° Ecuador
submitted that this was because certain activities, especially those in the hydrocarbons sector,
“inherently generate[d] risks” to the environment” and, in this way, liability “[did] not derive
from a single nefarious act, but, rather, from the decision to undertake a risky activity.”??7

119. Professor Crespo added that the rationale behind this approach to environmental claims
was that the protection of the environment had become a core philosophy of the 2008
Constitution?”* and its drafters recognised that in claims for environmental damage “it [was]
impossible or very difficult for the victim to establish that an environmental harm was caused by
a fault.”?2

 

22 A note on nomenclature: in the course of submissions the terms used ranged from “damage” or “impact” or

“alteration” or “harm” (for e.g., see Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, p 27 (Opening Statement of Pierre

120. For this reason, Ecuador submitted that the 2008 Constitution relating to the environment
applied to “all environmental damage discovered after its entry into force” and was not limited
only to damage that occurred after October 2008.7*° This was consistent with the Constitution’ s
Article 11(3), which stipulated that it was of “immediate application.”**! Relying on the
evidence of Professors Crespo and Andrade, Ecuador submitted the relevant date for determining
Perenco’s liability was November 2011 when IEMS undertook its first inspection of the Blocks
and concluded there was “widespread contamination.”?*? Alternatively, Ecuador relied on the
principle of “continuing torts” in Ecuadorian law, contending that even if the relevant date for
liability was the date that the damage was caused, the strict liability regime of the 2008
Constitution would still apply because the “cause of the damage” continued beyond the
Constitution’s entry into force and in those circumstances the principle mandates that the damage
is treated as having been caused at the moment the wrongful causative conduct ceases.?*

121. Professor Crespo explained that the basis of the strict liability regime in Ecuador is that
Nature (“pacha mama’) has rights, including the right to remediation,** and the theory of risk,
ie., that “the burden should go hand in hand with the economic benefit of an activity (ubi
emolumentum ibi onus)” such that “whoever creates risk in his or her benefit must also suffer its
harmful consequences.”?*> He referred in this latter respect to a 2002 ruling of the Ecuadorian
Supreme Court, in Delfina Torres v. Petroecuador, which found that “the production,
industrialization, transportation and operation of hydrocarbon substances [were], undoubtedly,
high-risk or high-dangerouness activities.”?*° He also relied on a report prepared by the Working

of the damage did not cease until after its enactment (i.e. Perenco was operating in the Blocks after the Constitution
entered into force in November 2008).

Group on Natural Resources and Biodiversity in Ecuador, a committee of the Constituent
Assembly that contributed to the drafting of the 2008 Constitution, which observed that:

“A presumption of innocence should be established in favor of the
environment. From this perspective, the burden of proof must be shifted
to the defendant (literal b of Article 1), that is, departing from the ancient
principle according to which innocence is presumed until proven
otherwise because, in environmental matters, strict liability would be the
exception. The plaintiff will not be required to prove the causality link,
which will fall on the defendant. This principle eliminates one of the
barriers hindering access to environmental justice as is the cost of
evidence and the technical requirement of proving environmental
harm.”?*7

122. Professors Crespo and Andrade also asserted that the Delfina Torres case showed that
even before the 2008 Constitution’s entry into force, Ecuadorian law contemplated a
presumption of causation in environmental liability claims which operated in favour of the
environment (relying also on the 1998 Constitution). Professor Crespo explained that in
Delfina Torres, “the theory of risk and the shifting of the burden of proof...allowed liability to
be placed on Petroecuador and its affiliates for environmental harm and damages to the health of
the inhabitants of a neighbourhood in the city of Esmeraldas”, the Court’s having adopted a
“theory of extra contractual civil liability for risky or dangerous activities” by holding that:

“fault is presumed, which relieves the victim from having to provide
evidence of negligence, carelessness or lack of expertise...[it is]
sufficient that the damages are a direct consequence of the events where
they originated. It is merely strict liability.”?”

123. In either case, Ecuador submitted that the only exceptions that the Constitution
contemplated were where the operator could establish: “(i) the lack of harm; or that the harm
result[ed] (ii) from force majeure; (iii) from actions or omissions of the victim of the harm; or
(iv) from actions or omissions of a third party.”?4? The experts asserted that this has been upheld
by Ecuador’s former Supreme Court of Justice in Delfina Torres and in Andrade Medina v.

foregoing exceptions naturally fell on the party that invoked it, i.e., Perenco in the instant case.?*7

124. In this respect, Ecuador submitted that Perenco could not meet any of the exceptions.” It

could not, for that matter, rely on the 2008 environmental audits of Blocks 7 and 21,74 because
they were not approved by the competent ministry and even if they had been approved,
Ecuadorian law, specifically Article 11(6) of the Constitution and Article 70 of TULAS, did not
permit the findings of any audit report to excuse Perenco from environmental liability.74>

125. The 2008 audits were audits of Blocks 7 and 21 that Perenco was obliged contractually
and by operation of Ecuadorian law to commission.*4° They were submitted to SPA, part of
Ecuador’s Ministry of Mines and Petroleum, on 16 December 2008.74” In February and March

environmental aspects of hydrocarbon operations.“” The Undersecretary of Environmental
Quality (“Subsecretaria de Calidad Ambiental’) of the Ministry of Environment was designated
as the new authority in charge of approving the 2008 audits and it had not concluded their review
when Perenco left the Blocks in July 2009.7°° The review process continued with the Ministry of
Environment sending a technical commission to perform an inspection of the Blocks from 29 to
31 July 2009 in order to “verify the results of Perenco’s Environmental Audits.”?>!

126. The Block 7 audit found that there were several instances of non-compliance with
regulatory requirements, namely, the improper disposal of contaminated soil from the Coca CPF
and in the management of the discharge of black and grey waters from the Jaguar and Payamino
camps.?* These were ostensibly addressed in an Action Plan subsequently carried out by
Perenco.”*> The audit did not identify contaminated soil or water requiring remediation. The
Block 21 audit concluded that Perenco’s activities complied with regulatory requirements and
there were no indications of an impact on the environment detected in the Block and adjacent to
areas of activities that would require remediation by Perenco.”*

127. In contrast, the technical inspection conducted by the Ministry in July 2009 resulted in a
report released in August 2009 recommending that Perenco be sanctioned for pervasive and
“major non-conformities” with applicable Ecuadorian environmental regulations and technical
requirements in Blocks 7 and 21.*°° The “major non-conformities” in Block 7 referred (amongst
others) to Perenco’s failure to comply with the plan for dismantling works when it left in July
2009, resulting in damage to the Gacela 2, Gacela 3, Lobo 4, Condor Norte, Jaguar 7 and 8,
Jaguar 2, Jaguar 9, and Jaguar 1 wells, Perenco’s “repeate[d] fail[ure]” to comply with the
approved limits for the treatment of black and grey water at the Payamino station, its “inadequate
handling of the areas and soils contaminated with hydrocarbons” in the Coca and Payamino
stations and failure to abide by permissible emission limits in its management of combustion
engines in the Gacela, Payamino and Oso stations.” In Block 21, the Ministry identified
inadequate maintenance of the facilities and the lack of treatment and monitoring reports related
to the residual waters and pit leachates.”** In addition to the sanctions it proposed, the Ministry
recommended that Perenco should be required to cure the defects in its 2008 audits.?°”

128. Ecuador thus contended that the July 2009 technical inspection demonstrated that the
2008 audits did not prove that Perenco had complied with its environmental obligations under
Ecuadorian law. They had not been approved by the Ministry, and even if they had been,

Article 70 of TULAS provided that this could not exonerate Perenco because the State was not
capable of waiving an environmental action based on strict liability. Article 70 states that “[t]he
approval of environmental management plans and other environmental studies shall not be used
as exonerating evidence in environmental contamination incidents or accidents attributable to
any activity, project or construction[...]”.2°' Ecuador also relied on Article 11(6), paragraph 1 of
the 2008 Constitution which states that “{aJll [its] principles and rights are inalienable,
unwaivable, indivisible, interdependent...”.?° Moreover, the technical inspection was held out
by Ecuador as “no less than the 2008 Environmental Audits review process itself’ and it
determined that ‘approval’ would not be forthcoming because “none of the [audits] complied
with the Consortium’s obligations.”

 

129. Ecuador submitted that, in any event, the 2008 audits were unreliable because they
examined whether the Consortium complied with permissible limits under RAOHE and TULAS
but as discussed in detail below, these limits did not amount to the extent of recoverable
environmental harm for which Perenco may now be held liable.2*4 Furthermore, Perenco
selectively sampled areas of the Blocks that it knew would be less likely to display
contamination, taking far fewer samples than that reasonably required for a credible and
representative sampling program.?®

130. Ecuador contended that Perenco’s culpability was compounded by its efforts to
“systematically [...] mislead the Ecuadorian authorities as to the existence and extent of the
environmental damages.” For example, it referred to an internal memorandum within Perenco
regarding a February 2010 complaint by a local landowner about contamination in the Payamino
2-8 area.”°” Perenco’s memorandum discussed the extent to which different individuals or
organisations connected to the investigation were aware of the contamination and the “possible
solutions” available to the company (for example, submitting an action plan to remedy the
damage and compensate; “confine the problem and leave the site as is”, and finally, to contest
liability). Ecuador emphasised the disparity between the results of an initial study of the site

in Payamino 2-8 (Caracterizacién de Pendientes Ambientales Payamino 2-8) in May 2010; Counter-Memorial,
paragraphs 744-749. In its Counter-Memorial, Ecuador characterises the subsequent statement prepared by Perenco
and submitted to the Minister of Environment on 11 June 2010, and a technical study it commissioned by Walsh
Environmental Scientists and Engineers as part of a pattern of conduct to conceal information and disclaim liability

conducted by Griintech laboratory, which concluded that the oil spill that caused the
contamination occurred during the time Perenco was the operator, and that of a technical study
conducted by Walsh Environmental Scientists and Engineers which reached a conclusion similar
to that put forward by Perenco to the Ministry, namely, that the contamination resulted from the
disposal of waste coming from the drilling of the Payamino 2 well by CEPE in April 1987, and
toa lesser extent, an oil spill that occurred in January 1998 when Petroproducci6n operated the
field.~

131. Ecuador adverted to other examples of similar behavior, such as Perenco’s representation
to the Ecuadorian Ministry of Environment in 2010 that no oil spills had ever been reported on or
near the Payamino 2 and 8 wells while Block 7 was under Perenco’s operatorship?”, an assertion
that was contradicted in its report to DINAPA in 2004 that 9 oil spills in Blocks 7 and 21 had
occurred between 2000 and 2003.27! Ecuador alleged that Perenco had failed to report at least 42
spills that occurred during its operatorship that now appeared on the record in this proceeding.”

132. Ecuador similarly raised instances where DINAPA, after having reviewed evidence of
site-testing by Perenco in areas where oil spills had been reported by local communities,
concluded that the company’s inspections were deliberately conducted in areas located a
considerable distance from the sites in question, and for that reason, were unrepresentative of the
conditions of the site of concern.?” It further raised examples of what it characterised as
deliberate omissions by Perenco in its regular reporting to the DINAPA.?”* It relied on RPS’
expert report which concluded that based on the documents on record it could “‘identif[y]
numerous and significant failures by the Consortium to comply with Ecuadorian regulations.”””>

notes that while Perenco in its letter does represent that it “carried out an exhaustive review of its archives and

appeared to be an “old oil spill” and inferred that it must have occurred during the time of Kerr McGee or

133. Finally, Ecuador submitted that the notion of harm covered by the Constitution’s strict
liability regime was broad, “covering as many types of environmental harm as possible”
including “affectation to hydric sources”, “loss of vegetation”, “loss of air quality”, “affectation
to health of local populations”, “impact to the local economy”, “‘socio-environmental conflicts”
and “affectation to tangible and intangible cultural heritage.”?’° This contributed to the specific
evaluative criteria that Ecuador submitted its environmental experts were required to apply when
evaluating the state of Blocks 7 and 21 (discussed in further detail below in Section III.C(5)).

134. Perenco’s position was that fault-based liability, nor strict liability, governed Ecuador’s
environmental claim.?”” In its view, strict liability was not the standard applicable under
Ecuadorian law until the 2008 Constitution was adopted and to apply it to the Consortium’s
operations would be contrary to the principles of non-retroactivity and legal security.?”
Ecuador’s Civil Code applied to the Consortium’s operations prior to October 2008, and the code
provided that “he who has committed a tort”, defined elsewhere as constituting an illegal action
committed “with the intention to cause harm’, which “has caused harm to another”, is “obligated
to indemnify”.?” This required a “breach of a duty of care which result[ed] in harm.”?*° Thus,
Perenco’s contention was that Ecuador’s claims were deficient because it had failed to establish
in IEMS’ experts reports that the Consortium “deliberately or negligently breached its duty of
care”,8! and that it “caused the alleged contamination.”?8?

135. Relying on its own Ecuadorian law expert, Dr. René Bed6n, Perenco rejected Professor
Crespo’s reliance on obiter dicta from Delfina Torres?* to assert that in any event strict liability
for environmental claims existed in Ecuador before October 2008, arguing that he had
misinterpreted the decision.”** Dr. Bed6n stated that even as the Court in Delfina Torres shifted
the burden of proof to the defendant, requiring it to prove that it had adopted appropriate
measures to prevent the damage alleged by the claimant, it still required a finding of fault, albeit
“presumed fault.”?* He asserted that:

 

prohibition on the use of water to dilute effluents was not in force at the time of the closure of the Coca 18 and
Payamino 24 pits about which Ecuador complains).

“Tn that ruling, after reaffirming that ‘it is considered necessary to have a
requirement of fault for the sake of justice of those responsible’, the
Court made the following statement:

‘However, since the burden of proof of such fault is almost
impossible or very difficult to be borne by the victim, shifting the
burden of proof was considered necessary...In other words, the
presumption of the fault of the person using and taking
advantage of the risky thing causing the harm was established.
This theory has increasingly gained acceptance, particularly in
case law...We fully agree with this position and such is the
reason why we adopt it as foundation for this ruling...’.”"8°

136. Dr. Bed6n also adverted to a subsequent decision of the Supreme Court of Justice in
Medardo Luna v. AECA.*’ This “clarified” the Delfina Torres ruling by confirming that it “had
been issued based on the fault-based liability regime”, shifting “only the burden of proof with
respect to the element of negligence or intent”, and quoted the following statement from the
decision: “This ruling [Delfina Torres] categorically state[d] that the respondents incurred in
fault-based liability and, on this basis, were ordered to pay damages...”.

137. Perenco submitted that the Supreme Court of Ecuador (now the National Court of
Justice) has recognised in three cases — Delfina Torres, Medardo Luna? and Andrade
Medina?” — that before the 2008 Constitution entered into force the Ecuadorian legal regime for
liability for hazardous activities like oilfield operations was fault-based with a rebuttable
presumption of fault or a rebuttable presumption that there had been a breach of the duty of
care.”°! These decisions confirmed that “proof of compliance with the operator’s duty of care
rebut[ted] the presumption of fault and thereby exonerate[d] the operator from liability.”?°”

138. Perenco further argued that:

[...] Ecuador does not explain why Articles 20 and 91 of the 1998
Constitution, which concern the vicarious liability of the State for the

“irrebuttable’ presumption of fault.”).

acts of its public servants or agents or for the defective provisions of a
public service, are applicable to the Consortium’s activities. Both the
express text of those provisions and the very decision cited by Ecuador,
Andrade Medina, confirm that this administrative liability regime
applie[d] only to harm caused by the State or its public servants or
agents.”>

139. Thus, Perenco submitted it is able to prove that it satisfied its duty of care, comprising the
standard of care expected of a reasonably prudent operator,”** because it consistently complied
with contractual and regulatory requirements to report, audit and remediate.”

140. In the alternative, should the Tribunal consider that the counterclaim was governed by a
strict liability regime, Perenco submitted that Ecuador still had to prove that Perenco had caused
environmental harm (consisting of regulatory exceedances of contaminants) by engaging in
“wrongful (negligent or malicious)” conduct, and not just that there was environmental damage

in Blocks 7 and 21 (the very existence of which, to a large extent, Perenco disputed).”°°

141. Perenco submitted that it was insufficient for Ecuador to allege there has been an impact
in the environment of Blocks 7 and 21 in order to shift the burden to Perenco to offer proof of its
insignificance.?”” In its view, in the course of its submissions Ecuador had conceded that the
burden rested on the claimant in an action for environmental liability in a strict liability regime to
establish the existence of environmental harm.?** Referring to the testimony of Professor Crespo,
as set out above, Ecuador’s case at its highest is that it was required to “only establish the
existence of the environmental damage in Blocks 7 and 21, where Perenco operated” for Perenco
to be held liable.?°? In its written pleadings, Ecuador contended it “need only establish the
existence of the environmental damage” or “that environmental harm exists.”*°° Ecuador could
not retreat from this by claiming that Article 397(1) of the 2008 Constitution shifted the burden
of proof to the Perenco to prove the inexistence of harm in such a way that it relieved Ecuador of
the duty to first establish that harm actually exists.*°!

142. Finally, on the issue of temporality, relying on Dr. Bed6n’s report, Perenco maintained
that the law which applied in an environmental claim was the law in force at the date of the
occurrence of the act alleged to have caused harm, rather than the law in force at the point of
time that the harm was purportedly discovered.*° Dr. Bed6n responded in this respect to
Professor Crespo’s view that the relevant date for determining Perenco’s liability was November

2011, the time of IEMS’ first inspection of the Blocks, and that since this followed the 2008
Constitution’s entry into force, the Constitution’s strict liability regime was engaged.*°

143. Dr. Bedén asserted that the principle on which he relied, namely, that “the fact that
determines the applicable law is the date of the occurrence of the act”, was validated by the
statute of limitations rules governing torts in Ecuador, “which establishe[d] that the statute of
limitations is counted from the date on which the allegedly harmful act occurred.”**4 He referred
in this respect to Article 2235 of Ecuador’s Civil Code which provides for a “statute of
limitations of four years, counted from the perpetration of the act.”?°°

144. Any other approach, Perenco contended, would be contrary to the basic principle of non-
retroactivity that exists under Ecuadorian law as accepted by Ecuador in the course of its
submissions in this arbitration.*” It rejects any suggestion that an exception should be made on
the basis that claims for environmental liability are advanced in the “general interest of nature
and the Ecuadorian general public.”**” This is not a position provided for in Ecuador’s 2008
Constitution or in any decisions of its courts.*”8 There is “no basis on which to derogate from the
express constitutional principle of non-retroactivity.”*°? Consequently, the strict liability regime
of the 2008 Constitution should not be applied to conduct occurring prior to its entry into force
on 20 October 2008.3!°

145. In sum, Perenco argued that it could not be held liable for any damage occurring after the
July 2009 takeover or before January 2007 (the furthest back in time that Ecuador’s four-year
statute of limitations permitted a claim to be made).*!!

(2) Burden of Proof in Relation to Causation

146. The Parties also diverged on the matter of causation. In light of Ecuador’s position that
the 2008 Constitution continued a strict liability regime that was already in force since 2002, it
argued that while it bore the burden of presenting evidence of environmental “impact” in the
Blocks, it was not, either prior to or after the 2008 Constitution, required to demonstrate that the
defendant had caused the exceedances claimed in order for it to be found liable.*!”

147. Perenco disagreed. It maintained that whether before or after the 2008 Constitution, the
State was required to demonstrate causation. It acknowledged that under the post-2008 strict

liability regime, it sufficed if the State demonstrated the incidence of “wrongful (negligent or
malicious)” conduct coupled with proof of the existence of environmental damage; this would
trigger the operation of a presumption of causation.

148. Ecuador submitted that “both under the 2008 Ecuadorian Constitution and under the prior
environmental liability regime, it may be presumed that operators of inherently dangerous
activities caused any environmental harm found in the area of their operations of the kind that
potentially result from such activities.”*'> It relied on the evidence of Professors Crespo and
Andrade. The latter asserted that “the presumption of fault in the Delfina Torres decision, which
accepted the theory of risk, implies in fact two distinct presumptions: one irrebuttable
presumption of the existence of fault regarding hazardous activities and another rebuttable
presumption with regards to causation, pursuant to which one may be exempted from one’s
environmental liability by proving that the harm was caused by another.”>'*

149. As for Professor Crespo, his expert evidence was that under a strict liability regime,
causation is presumed. He cited the drafting history of the 2008 Convention, where the Working
Group on Natural Resources and Biodiversity referred to a “presumption of innocence...in favour
of the environment” and explained that, consequently, the “plaintiff will not be required to prove
the causality link, which will fall on the defendant.”*!5 On cross-examination, he clarified that it
was not the case that causation has been done away with. Instead, it was that Ecuador had to
prove that there was environmental harm (“an alteration; that is, a modification with a negative
impact of the environment”)*!® and that an operator had been operating in the area where the
harm was found in order to trigger the presumption that that operator was responsible for the
harm created.*!’ Professor Crespo was pressed further on the issue of burden of proof in the
course of his oral evidence. He testified that the victim of the harm “should show that there is a
negative environmental impact in the area of operation” and “with the indication of a negative
environmental impact, the other Party has to prove that that damage does not exist or doesn’t
have causation” on the basis of the exceptions discussed.*!

150. Ecuador further submitted that this approach to the burden of proof in relation to
causation of environmental harm is consistent with what was provided for under the Participation
Contracts. Clause 5.1.20.10 of the Block 7 Participation Contract provided that “[t]he Contractor
shall not be liable for environmental conditions preexisting at the beginning of operations under

in the event that the existence of liability is conceded, but the cost of remediation is disputed, Professor Crespo’s
position was that the burden rested on the operator who has been found liable to prove the non-existence of the full
extent of damage claimed.

the Services Contract”,?!? and Clause 5.1.20, second paragraph, of the Block 21 Participation

Contract similarly provided “[t]he Contractor shall not be responsible for pre-existing
environmental conditions at the beginning of operations under the Services Contract.”*”° In its
view, this suggested, first, that the Contracts intended that the Contractor shall be held liable for
any and all environmental conditions in the Blocks for the duration of the Contracts. Second,
since this is a limitation on the Contractor’s liability, and whether prior to or after the 2008
Constitution’s entry into force, the burden rested on the operator to establish any exception or
limitation in its favour: “while the Contractor’s liability for environmental damage under the
Participation Contracts [did] not extend to conditions existing prior to the execution of the Block
7 Services Contract (18 December 1985) and Block 21 Participation Contract (20 March 1995),
it is for the Contractor to prove that such limitations apply in the instant case.”>7!

151. Turning to the evidence, Ecuador submitted that IEMS’ evidence demonstrated that the
hydrocarbons operations had a significant impact on the environment in Blocks 7 and 21. This
triggered the presumption that Perenco was liable, and Perenco had not discharged its burden of
disproving that it had caused the harm (or that another available defence could be made out).
Ecuador contended that Perenco did not dispute that the oil operations it conducted were
hazardous or high-risk and likely to cause contamination of the environment, only that all the
contamination found in Blocks 7 and 21 might not necessarily be associated with oilfield
operations.*2?

152. Ecuador further contended that Perenco’s expert, GSI, applied “indicator parameters” so
as to distinguish between exceedances that could be attributed to hydrocarbon operations as
opposed to those which could not be linked to hydrocarbon operations, and in doing so used the
indicia of Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (“TPH”) and barium only, while excluding testing for
heavy metals.*?? Ecuador asserted that this approach flew in the face of Ecuador’s environmental
regulations for hydrocarbon operations (such as RAOHE) which included permissible
contamination limits for all other heavy metals: lead, nickel, cadmium and vanadium etc.*4

153. For its part, Perenco submitted that regardless of whether the applicable legal regime was
a fault-based or a strict liability regime, Ecuador had conceded that it bore the burden of
establishing that it had “suffered harm.”*?> Under the pre-2008 regime, the existence of harm
was a “separate and necessary predicate to tortious liability.”**° The claimant in a tortious action

was required to demonstrate a “causal nexus between the tortfeasor’s actions and the harm for an
action in tortious liability to succeed.”*?

154. Even under the post-2008 regime, causation remained a critical element.*?* Perenco
contended Ecuador and its legal experts acknowledged this in the course of their submissions,
with Professor Andrade stating that “the causal link, as a condition for liability, does not
disappear in environmental matters, either under the strict liability regime of the 2008
Constitution or under the previous regime.” >”? Perenco emphasised that Article 396 of the 2008
Constitution provides that “[e]ach of the participants...shall be directly liable for...repairing the
damages it has caused{.|”?°°

155. Rather than a rebuttable presumption of causation in favour of the environment, the
burden being on the operator to challenge the presumption, Perenco submitted that the burden,
first and foremost, remained on Ecuador to “affirmatively prove the existence of a causal
link.”**! Perenco’s legal expert challenged the applicability of the Ecuadorian judicial decisions
relied upon by Ecuador to argue that a strict liability regime existed prior to the 2008
Constitution, submitting instead that they stood for the proposition that in order for a
presumption to arise, the State is required to establish causation.**? Ecuador could not retract
from its position that this regime then carried over to the 2008 Constitution.

156. In the Medardo Luna case, Ecuador’s Supreme Court stated “the harmed party
must...demonstrate: the fact, the damage, and the relationship of causal link among them{.J”>*?
In Delfina Torres, the Court held that “[t]he claimant had to prove: a) the harm of which it
claims it is a victim; b) its amount or quantum; and c) the events that caused such harm.”>**
Professor Crespo concluded that a claim for environmental damage is made out where “the State
has proven: the occurrence of environmental damage, and [t]hat the operator/defendant
performed any of the activities described in Articles 397 or 408 of the Constitution [..].”>>>

157. Perenco interpreted the use of the word “occurrence” as an affirmation of the requirement
that the State must prove causation. Dr. Bed6én opined that this burden required Ecuador to
prove, both in law and in fact that there was an impact on the environment that exceeded the

specific activities (see above where the provision is quoted). Article 408 states “non-renewable natural resources
and, in general, the products of the subsoil, mineral deposits and hydrocarbo: ervoirs, substances with a nature
other than that of soil, even those found in areas covered by waters of the territorial seas and maritime zones, as well
as the biodiversity and its genetic patrimony and the radioelectric spectrum, are of the State‘s inalienable,
imprescriptible and unseizable property. These goods may only be exploited in strict compliance with the
environmental principles set forth in the Constitution.”

permissible regulatory limits, and that this could be attributed to the operator.**° He claimed that
Ecuador’s argument, that there was a presumption of causation that Perenco was required to
rebut, was based on a misreading of Delfina Torres.>*" The court, in his view, “established a
presumption of breach of the duty of care, and not of causation”*** and he cited the following
passage from the decision in Delfina Torres in support of this view:

Harm, as a factual phenomenon, is different from legal damage. The
latter arises only when certain essential features are met, which must
concur to the detriment or impairment of the harmed party. The harm is
legal and, as such, shall be able to be redressed when certain. Certainty
of its existence is an essential assumption, as harm, for the purposes of
liability, is anywhere its existence has been scientifically proven.
Hypothetical or future harm cannot be compensated. In these matters,
claiming harm in the abstract or its mere possibility is not enough, real
and effectively suffered harm must be proven; harm that has not been
demonstrated procedurally, with evidentiary elements which externalize
a harm, does not legally exist.*”

158. This was consistent with the provisions of the Participation Contracts which, in Perenco’s
view, “exonerate the Claimant from responsibility for harm caused by others.”*4° They provided
that the operator would not be “responsible for pre-existing environmental conditions” preceding
the start of the participation contract in the case of Block 21 and the service contract in the case
of Block 7.*4! Moreover, Clause 5.1.19 of the Block 21 Contract provided that the “Contractor
shall not be responsible for changes to the ecosystem caused by third parties within the Contract
Area.”>4? Clause 5.7.3 of the Block 7 Contract stated that “[i]n performing this Contract, neither
party shall be liable for damages...unless the damage...was caused by the Party’s own acts.”*44

159. Perenco submitted that Ecuador had failed to discharge its burden of demonstrating that
the harm that it alleged existed in the Blocks could be traced back to the Consortium’s

for the point that “[f]rom a legal standpoint, the concept of ‘environmental damage’ is a key component in the

activities.*4 Moreover, it contended that “[e]ven though it [was] not Claimant’s burden to
disprove causation, historical records demonstrate that Ecuador’s own State oil companies
caused much of the damage of which it now complains — either in the period prior to assumption
of operations by private contractors or in the period since July 2009, when it took over operation
of the Blocks.”*#5 It stated that GSI had located and provided to the Tribunal “substantial
evidence — not mere allegations, as Ecuador assert[ed] — that Ecuador or other operators caused a
significant portion of the damages about which it now complains”, providing as examples the
Payamino 2-8 contamination which it contended could be traced back to CEPE™®, and to
Petroecuador in the case of the Chald swamp in Coca CPF.*4”

(3) Liability of operators inter se

160. Ecuador submitted that under its law “all the authors of a tort [...] are jointly liable to its
victim.”*4* Thus, it was entitled to proceed against Perenco or Burlington “or any author of the
environmental harm caused” and “[h]ow the different authors of the environmental harm should
ultimately share liability and pay money back to each other [was] a matter of no concern to
Ecuador.”*4? (It also rejected any attempt to lay blame on CEPE (now Petroecuador) or
Petroproduccion for this reason, adding that in any event since they possessed “their own legal
personality” they were “therefore third parties to the instant dispute, as different entities from the
Ecuadorian State.”*>°)

 

161. Ecuador referred to Article 396, paragraph 3, of the 2008 Constitution, which provides in
relevant part that “[e]ach of the participants in the processes of production, distribution,
commercialization and usage of goods and services shall be directly liable for preventing any
environmental impact, for mitigating and repairing the harm that it has caused [...].”*! This
indicated that the operator shall be held liable “for the damages it has caused and will not be
liable for the damages another participant has caused.” However, “since there is a presumption of
causation that links each element of damage to each participant, it follows that it is for each
participant, for the [Claimant] to prove that a certain damage was caused, not by [it], but
exclusively by another participant.” *>*

162. Perenco responded that joint and several liability applied only where the actors at issue
had contributed to the same act for which their liability had otherwise been established. It did not
apply to successive operators whose actions were factually distinguishable from each other.*>?
Perenco could not be held liable for harm that had been caused exclusively by other operators

and especially by prior operators as this has been specifically excluded by operation of clauses
5.1.20 (Block 21) and 5.1.20.10 (Block 7) of the Participation Contracts.***

163. Perenco further contended “if [Ecuador’s] conception of joint and several liability is
accepted, Ecuador’s State-owned oil companies would be jointly and severally liable for all of
the environmental harm that allegedly exists in the Blocks.”*°> It submitted that this was the
result in principle regardless of whether the Tribunal could in fact act on the principle and
pronounce upon that liability by exercising jurisdiction over them.**°

164. Recalling Article 396, paragraph 3, of the Constitution, the experts disagreed on the
significance of this provision in the context of oil blocks that have been worked by different
operators over their life-span.

165. Professor Andrade explained that under Ecuadorian law, where the environmental harm
may be attributed to several polluters, each of them is jointly liable for the full amount of the
relevant harm.**” In this regard, he cited Article 2217 of the Civil Code which states that “[i]f a
willful or negligent tort has been committed by two or more people, each one of them shall be
jointly and severally liable for any loss resulting from said willful or negligent tort.”*°* This
principle existed in Ecuadorian law prior to the 2008 Constitution.>?

166. Professor Andrade further asserted that tribunals possessed a broad discretion to establish
the proportion of liability of each of the participants in causing the contamination, applying
criteria such as the length of time of their operations and their intensity, but that this required the
tribunal to exercise jurisdiction over the participants and that was not the case in this instance.*
This related to Perenco’s submission that State-linked or owned oil companies bore some extent
of liability in several instances of alleged contamination in Blocks 7 and 21.°°' Ecuador
submitted that Perenco’s contention ignored the fact that CEPE, Petroproduccién and
Petroamazonas were entities that were distinct and independent from the Ecuadorian State and as
such their conduct could not be attributed to it.°° In any event, the Tribunal has determined that
it does not have jurisdiction over these entities in this arbitration °°

167. During the course of his examination, Professor Crespo testified that in the instance
where there have been successive operators managing the Blocks, their liability is governed by
the principle of joint and several liability. The State was entitled to proceed against one of the
operators, and then “he can go to the others and ask for their portion.”*** He added that this was

throughout the time of [its] stewardship of the resource.”**
(4) Imprescriptibility

168. Ecuador submitted in the first instance that under the 2008 Constitution environmental
claims were deemed imprescriptible i.e., not subject to limitation periods.*® In the alternative,
Ecuador submitted that the 2008 Constitution applied to any harm discovered after its entry into
force (the “discovery rule”) and it was the date of discovery of environmental harm that mattered
for statute of limitation purposes.*°7

169. Ecuador noted that Article 396, paragraph 4, of the Constitution provides that “[l]egal
actions to prosecute and sanction environmental harm shall be imprescriptible.”** It also
adverted to the decisions of the Ecuadorian Supreme Court of Justice in Nelson Alcivar*® and
Delfina Torres*” to suggest that environmental tort claims cannot expire and that even if there
were a statute of limitations, the limitation period would begin to run only as of the date that the
harm was discovered.*”! In Nelson Alcivar, the Provincial Court of Justice of Sucumbios
declared that Article 396, paragraph 4, of the Constitution (on imprescriptibility) applied despite
the fact that the relevant conduct occurred before the 2008 Constitution entered into force.*”* In
Delfina Torres, the Supreme Court of Justice of Ecuador recognised that the statute of limitations
began to run not from the date on which the damage was perpetrated but the date on which it

368 Exhibit EL-89, 2008 Constitution, (partial translation resubmitted on 10-18-2013). Ecuador further relied
on Article 11(3) of the Constitution, emphasising that it provided that its provisions were of “direct and immediate
application”. “The rights and guarantees set forth in the Constitution and in international human rights instruments
shall be of direct and immediate application by and before any public, administrative or judicial servant, ex officio or
upon request by a party.” (Unofficial translation from Spanish original: “[I]os derechos y garantias establecidos en

Ecuador submitted this approach had been recognised by Ecuadorian courts, relying on the decision in Nelson
Alcivar which it claimed stood for the proposition that the 2008 Constitution applied “to all claims filed after its
entry into force and not just to harm discovered after that date.” Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, pp
44-46 (Opening Statement of Eduardo Silva Romero). Dr. Silva Romero quoted from the decision, that “[t]he
environmental action protects a common good that is essential to humanity’s existence, and, therefore, it is logical
that the current Constitution does not contemplate a term for a statute of limitations for this type of action...”.

manifestation of the damage.”

could be discerned.*” It emphasised that any doubts regarding the interpretation of the
applicability of the 2008 Constitution and its provision on imprescriptibility should be resolved
“in favour of environmental protection,’*” relying on the following passage from Nelson
Alcivar:

“Tt must be emphasized that, on account of the constitutional principle

that states that in doubt the rule that most favours environmental

protection shall apply, because it is a norm that generates ample

protectionfor the environment it always falls to apply what is foreseen in

the current Constitution, over and above the provisions of the

Environmental Management Law or the 1998 Constitution. In addition,

the provisions of the current Constitution in all that relates to

environmental issues and environmental protection should be preferably

applied, given that, in procedural matters, the rules in force at the time of

filing the action apply, and not those in force when the legal

situationarose.”*7>

170. In this regard, Ecuador’s experts, Professors Crespo and Andrade, submitted that it was
the date of discovery or the “verification” of environmental harm that mattered for limitation
purposes.*7° It was the “very nature of environmental harm require[d] that this be so:”377

“unlike traditional, simple figures of torts, the effects of soil and
groundwater pollution are not immediately manifest. Instead, they
surface progressively over a long period of time. Verification requires
extensive tests and scientific analyses. Without these, the environmental
damage remains for the most part invisible. Thus, if the relevant date for
limitation purposes were the moment the damaging act occurred, in most
occasions environmental liability would simply become unenforceable.”

171. Since in this case the harm was discovered in 2011 after the 2008 Constitution and its
provision regarding imprescriptibility entered into force, Perenco’s submission that the 4-year
limitation under Article 2235 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code applied to bar claims for damage
occurring over 4 years before the counterclaim was filed could carry no weight.*”* In any event,
less than 4 years elapsed between the discovery of the environmental harm and the filing of the
present counterclaim.*””

172. Ecuador submitted in the further alternative that environmental harm is susceptible to the
“general principle of tort law” that recognises “continuing torts”, defined as “civil wrongs
committed not at a specific point in time but continuously throughout a certain period” and
which are thus considered “to have occurred at the moment when the wrongful conduct
ceases.”**° The limitation period can only start to run from the date that the wrongful conduct is

deemed to have ceased.**! As a result, since the harm in this case is “not the result of an
individual act...but rather the accumulated result of the entirety of the low-cost oil operation”
conducted by Perenco from 2002 to 2009, the wrong is deemed to have been committed as of
2009, when Perenco left the Blocks, and a year after the 2008 Constitution’s entry into force.°8?

173. Ecuador also invoked Article 11(3) of the 2008 Constitution, namely, that “[t]he rights
and guarantees set forth in the Constitution...shall be of direct and immediate application by and
before any public, administrative or judicial servant, ex officio or upon request by a party.”>* It
used this to contend in the alternative that the relevant point of time was the time the claim was
filed rather than the time the claim was said to have arisen (i.e., discovered).**4

174. In other words, the 2008 Constitution and its provision on imprescriptibility applied
without limitation to the claims advanced in this arbitration because they were filed after it
entered into force in October 2008.**° Ecuador further contended that the strict liability regime
put into place by Article 396 of the Constitution indicated, by the choice of strict as opposed to a
fault-based liability, that the intention was to home in on the existence of harm rather than the
chain of causation leading to the harm.**°

175. Also in the alternative, Ecuador argued that if the Tribunal was not convinced by the
‘discovery rule’, the principle of ‘continuing torts’ or the consequence of Article 11(3), with the
result that the imprescriptibility of the strict liability regime only took effect in 2008, the
Constitution’s prohibition on retroactive application did not apply to laws aimed at a public
interest, such as laws “issued to protect broad sectors of the public which are considered to be in
a vulnerable situation, vis-a-vis other sectors of society.”°87 In its submission, the 2008

Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaim, Day 1, pp 41-43 (Opening Statement of Eduardo Silva Romero):
“First, from the perspective of the conditions for liability, fault-based liability requires, as its name indicates, proof
of fault. For strict liability, fault is indifferent. Second...from the perspective this time of the object of the rule of
liability, fault-based liability regulates conduct; whereas, strict liability is addressed at harm...from the perspective
of the function, fault-based liability seeks to prevent faulty or illegal conduct. Strict liability seeks to guarantee the
reparation of the harm under all circumstances.” Ecuador submitted this approach had been recognised by
Ecuadorian courts, relying on the decision in Nelson Alcivar (Expert Report of Fabian Andrade Narvaez, Annex 29)

387 Reply, section 3.2.3; Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, pp 47-48 (Opening Statement of

Shulton, 25 September 2003 (Exhibit CA-CC-29): “It is true that the majority of the laws of public order are applied
with a retroactive effect because they affect the general interest of the collective public...those laws that were issued
to protect broad sectors of the public, which are considered to be in a vulnerable situation vis-a-vis other sectors of
society.”

Constitution’s provisions relating to the protection of the environment naturally fell within the
exception to retroactivity.°***

176. In response to this series of arguments, Perenco responded that the Tribunal should
“apply the law that was actually in force in Ecuador at the times the alleged environmental
conditions were created — all of which predate[d] the 2008 Constitution.”**? This was tied to its
position that prior to the 2008 Constitution’s entry into force, the operative regime was fault-
based and therefore an operator could not be found liable if it could demonstrate it had been
operating in accordance with its duty of care at all relevant times and consistently with
applicable regulations.**° Perenco contended that this was an attempt by Ecuador to escape its
burden of proving that the Consortium was at fault, and to accept it would be to condone a
violation of Ecuador’ s “own constitutional principle of legal certainty.”*?!

177. Perenco further submitted that the Consortium cannot be held liable for harm that may
have occurred “after Ecuador’s July 2009 takeover of the Blocks, or before January 2007, which
is when the four-year statute of limitations window since Ecuador first asserted its counterclaims
ends.”**? Ecuador’s statute of limitation for tort claims runs for four years from the date when
the allegedly damaging act occurred.*” This is provided for expressly in Article 2235 of the
Ecuadorian Civil Code.*°! Perenco contended that since “Ecuador filed its first set of
counterclaims in January 2011 in the Burlington case, any claims for incidents [that occurred]
before January 2007 [were] time-barred.”*%°

178. Perenco also challenged Ecuador’s reliance on the 2008 Constitution’s provision on
imprescriptibility, asserting it was inapplicable to this claim and thus did not affect the statute of
limitation analysis.*°° Professor Crespo’s opinion that the new constitutional provisions relating
to the protection of the environment were of immediate application because they were a matter
of public policy could not mean that they applied retroactively; the proscription against the
retroactive application of law remained part of Ecuadorian law and the 2008 Constitution.*%”

Perenco also rejected Professor Crespo’s use of a ‘verification’ approach, contending he could
not provide any authority under Ecuadorian law to support the theory.**

179. Perenco further submitted that the “discovery rule” and “continuing torts” theories
advanced by Ecuador did not exist in Ecuadorian law.*”? Ecuador and Professor Andrade did not
provide any authority to support these rules and their acceptance would undermine the express
words of Article 2235 of the Civil Code.*”° Perenco contended that Ecuador accepts that Article
2235 expressly provides that the statute of limitation runs from the date on which the allegedly
harmful act was perpetrated*”' and Professor Andrade cited no Ecuadorian judicial authority in
support of the proposition that a derogation from Article 2235 can occur in environmental
cases. #0?

180. Perenco further claimed that Ecuador did not understand the concept of the “discovery
tule” (while simultaneously maintaining its position that the rule did not exist in Ecuadorian law)
which enabled the suspension of the limitations period “for so long as the claimant could not
reasonably have discovered the alleged harm.”4°? Such a rule “[did] not allow a tribunal to
suspend the limitations period when the claimant knew of, or could reasonably have discovered,
the alleged harm and yet failed to act.”4™ In this case, Ecuador was on “constant notice” of the
environmental condition of the Blocks through the “regular reporting, audit, inspection and
verification process” and thus cannot claim to have not been in a position to advance the claims
if it saw fit to do so.*5

181. Perenco similarly rejected the applicability of a “continuing torts” theory, contending that
the exceedances (whether of background values or of regulatory criteria) were not, using
Ecuador’s pleaded language, “the result of an individual act that took place at a specific point in
time”.*° Incidents that may have caused contamination were not “a continuous and undefined
act” or one “aggregate act.”407

182. Perenco maintained that the only period for which claims would be imprescriptible
“would be between October 20, 2008 (when the Constitution entered into effect) and July 16,

398 Claimant’s Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 492-495; cf. Reply, paragraph 336: Ecuador submitted that

Perenco’s position is contradicted “by the very case-law that it cites. The Baquerizo judgment, cited erroneously in
its support, only states that “laws normally do not apply retroactively” (emphasis added). However, the judgment
continues to say, “most public law regulations apply retroactively because they affect the general interest of
society”. The Ecuadorian Supreme Court then considers for instance that all regulations that seek to protect a
vulnerable sector of society have retroactive effect. (Exhibit CA-CC-29, Supreme Court of Justice, Third Civil and

(5) Remediation criteria

183. As noted above, Perenco submitted that Ecuador had conceded that a predicate of a
tortious claim for liability in an environmental claim is proof of environmental harm.*!° Perenco
contended that environmental harm under Ecuadorian law did not encompass “any impact to the
environment, but [rather] an impermissible impact to the environment.”*!! It made this point in
response to Ecuador’s and IEMS’ use of “background values”, which was in turn premised on
Ecuador’s position that any presence in the environment of petroleum hydrocarbons or certain
metals associated with hydrocarbon operations above the average background values (“valores
de fondo”*") was legally impermissible. For this reason, IEMS compared its test samples against
the “level of contaminants naturally present in the area under study” or “Base Values” rather
than against the level of exceedances permitted by the Ecuadorian regime governing
hydrocarbon resources exploitation.*+!?

184. Perenco emphasised that when IEMS submitted its report to the Burlington tribunal about
10 months before its first submission to this Tribunal,*"* in selecting its criteria for evaluating the
Consortium’s compliance with environmental standards, TEMS referred to the notion of
“tolerable” levels of contaminants.*!> IEMS had stated that “on properties that are used for
productive purposes related with petroleum activities, we tolerate certain concentrations of
contaminants”, because they represented “an alteration of little relevance.”*!° It concluded that
this was represented by RAOHE and TULAS, the permissible limits of which “ma[de] it possible
to establish whether the presence of contaminants at certain levels and components of the
environment (soil, surface water and underground water) [was] tolerable”, and added it was “not
necessary to consider international comparison criteria considering that the environmental

regulations in Ecuador specify precise criteria for all these parameters or contaminants [...].”4!7

185. ITEMS’ report in Burlington further characterised RAOHE and TULAS as the criteria that
“establish[ed] the obligation to carry out the clean up and/or restoration of the environment
[...]/4!8 It added that “permissible limits specified in the environmental regulations of a country
foster the performance of productive activities that avoid the accumulation of contaminants in
the environment at levels that cause damage to the productive activities itself, human health, or
the environment.”*!

186. It was not until the filing of its second report in Burlington that IEMS introduced its
“background values” hypothesis.*?° Perenco noted that in its proposal to the Office of the
Attorney General of Ecuador (Procuraduria General del Estado) on 25 July 2011 on the matter
of its expert evidence in these arbitrations, IEMS referred to the fact that in its initial
environmental assessment 29 out of the 93 facilities inspected “had contaminated areas
exceeding the clean-up criteria established in Ecuadorian environmental regulations.”**! The
proposal referred to a request that IEMS had received to undertake a more detailed investigation
“with the object of:...2. Strengthening the prior soil and groundwater sampling results via the
determination and evaluation of background levels for those contaminants whose presence may
be attributable to natural conditions or other causes.”*” (In its supplemental report in this
arbitration, in the course of responding to the evidence of its former employee, Mr. Gilberto
Martinez, who, amongst other things, challenged IEMS’ decision to employ background
values,*?* IEMS stated “[wl]e also find it very strange that Mr. Martinez should criticize us for
assessing the presence of contamination against the background values of the Blocks. This issue
was never discussed, especially since the instruction to employ this criterion came from our
lawyers.” *4)

187. In Perenco’s view, IEMS had changed its evaluative criteria not because of its own views
as to how to properly evaluate the Blocks’ conditions, but rather because it was instructed to do
so by its client. In acceding to that instruction, it had abandoned its prior (correct) position that
only contaminants that exceeded the applicable regulatory criteria (so-called “regulatory
exceedances”) amounted to contamination under Ecuadorian law. On its prior approach,
environmental harm was determined by whether contamination in a specific case exceeded the
permitted levels, not by measuring soil samples against “background values.” This was the
approach which Perenco itself employed.

188. Ecuador responded to Perenco’s criticism in defence of IEMS’ use of the ‘background
values’ approach on the ground that “Ecuadorian regulatory criteria [did] not provide for full
remediation of the contamination and, therefore, [did] not fully protect the environment or

also raised the example of IEMS’ report in the case of City Oriente Limited v. Republic of Ecuador and Empresa
Estatal Petréleos del Ecuador (Petroecuador), ICSID Case No. ARB/06/21 [hereinafter City Oriente v. Ecuador]

human health.”“?> It considered that since there could be no expectation that hydrocarbons-
related substances occur naturally in the environment of Blocks 7 and 21, the Base Value
employed should be 0 mg/Kg.*”° It further contended that this was in line with the import of the
Consortium’s contractual obligations to require the complete restoration of the environment in
the Blocks (relying on Clause 5.1.20.10 of the Block 7 Contract*?’ and Clause 5.1.20 of the
Block 21 Contract).*”8

189. Against that backdrop, Ecuador submitted that the “notion of repairable harm is not in
fact defined in TULAS and RAOHE through ‘permissible limits’, but rather in the
[Environmental Management Law].”*?? It relied on the Law’s definition of the term
‘environmental harm’ and asserted that the Constitutional Court has confirmed that this is the
operative definition under Ecuadorian law and it defines the extent of the obligation to repair:

Environmental Harm. — Any significant loss, diminution, detriment or
impairment of the preexisting conditions in the environment or one of its
components. It affects the functioning of the ecosystem or the
renewability of its resources.*°

190. Ecuador also pointed to Ministerial Decree 169 on the “Principles and Definitions of
Environmental Public Policy”, Article 1 of which defines “environmental damage” as follows:

“[It is] the negative environmental impact to the environmental
conditions present in a given space, caused by the development of
development projects, which lead to an imbalance in the ecosystems’
functions and that alter the supply of the services that such ecosystems
contribute to society.”**!

191. Ecuador also relied on the evidence of Professor Andrade who asserted that RAOHE and
TULAS were confined to setting the thresholds within which hydrocarbon activities could be
undertaken in Ecuador and, in that connection, while administrative sanctions may be imposed
on the operators for illicit hydrocarbon activities, they did not purport to define the notion of

environmental harm for the purpose of the constitutional requirement to remedy any and all
environmental harm.**?

192. Ecuador contended that Perenco’s position in effect contradicted the reference to “full
restoration” in Article 396 of the Constitution and Clause 5.1.20.10 of the Block 7 Participation
Contract, and to background values and the requirement to restore contaminated soil to its “prior
condition” in Article 4.1 of TULAS.** Furthermore:

“The fact that an activity is lawfully conducted does not mean, in
environmental law, that the harm caused need not be repaired. That is
precisely the point of a regime of strict liability, to guarantee that the
harm is always repaired no matter whether the activity that caused that
harm was lawful or not.”3*

193. Ecuador also referred to the preparatory material of the 2008 Constitution in support of
its position; for example, the view of one assembly member, Mr. Sergio Chac6n Padilla, in a
minority report on the “rights of nature”, in which he states that “instead of speaking of
reparation we should use the notion of restoration or re-composition, given that reparation could
be understood in the simple sense of ‘compensating’, while the re-composition or restoration
would imply bringing things back to their original state or place, without prejudice to the
obligation to compensate for the harms or damages caused to those affected directly.”47° Ecuador
submitted that to accept Perenco’s position would be to “render part of Ecuadorian regulations
obsolete.”

194. In short, Ecuador’s position was that Ecuadorian administrative law contemplated a
separation between the notions of reparable harm and unlawful conduct. This meant that, “with
regards to TULAS and RAOHE, an operator that complies entirely with its obligations under
both regulations, including the obligation to abide by the permissible limits, will nevertheless be

Register Supplement No. 1, 18 August 2009, (Expert Report of Fabian Andrade Narvdez, Annex 4); Transcript,
Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, pp 62-63 (Opening Statement of Eduardo Silva Romero). See, in particular,
Expert Report of Fabién Andrade Narvaez, paragraphs 18, 21, 26(c) and 27: “Perenco and Burlington claim that this
interpretation of the concept of environmental harm causes the permi le limits contained in the TULAS and the
RAOHE to lose all effect. As I explained, this is not true: these limits mark the boundaries from which a given
activity is operating in a lawful manner, regardless of the general duty to repair the damage actually caused.
Moreover, it is Prof. Bedén who actually commits the error eviscerating the technical rules invoked, because,
according to his interpretation, the “baseline values” or “quality criteria”, also set by the TULAS would be
irrelevant. The only interpretation that preserves the coherence of the system is as follows: while baseline values
determine the scope of the obligation to repair the environmental harm, the permissible limits define the activities
that can be carried out lawfully.”

433 Reply, paragraph 252: referring to Article 397 of the 2008 Constitution (Exhibit EL-89) and Article 4.1 of
Volume VI Annex 2 of TULAS (Exhibit EL-146). It also submitted that Perenco’s position was incompatible with
two fundamental principles of environmental law: “that operators should internalize the environmental costs of their
economic activities” and the “principle of nature as a bearer of rights.”

obliged to repair the contamination it has caused.”*3” Recoverable environmental harm was “any
significant negative impact, particularly if it affects the functioning of the ecosystem or the
renewal of its resources.”*** The burden was on Perenco to demonstrate that the damage suffered
by the environment in Blocks 7 and 21 was “insignificant.”

195. In the alternative, Ecuador submitted that even considering the regulatory thresholds in
RAOHE and TULAS, 92% of the areas IEMS tested were polluted with hydrocarbons and/or
heavy metals, and 100% of the 18 sites tested for water pollution similarly yielded
concentrations of contaminants above the regulatory values.*4°

196. In reply to this submission, Perenco argued that Ecuador had “failed cogently to rebut the
point that not every impact on the environment gives rise to recoverable environmental harm
under Ecuadorian law.”““! First, when invoking Perenco’s contractual obligations Ecuador
omitted the reference in the same provisions to the requirement that the Contractor should carry
out its obligations in accordance with RAOHE or more generally, the applicable “legislation in
effect in Ecuador at the time that such clean-up, reforestation, or abandonment is carried out.”"442

197. Perenco submitted that, in any event, these obligations were concerned with
decommissioning at the end of the useful life of a well or field and did not apply to ongoing
operations. Blocks 7 and 21, however, were “decades away from being decommissioned, as
evidenced by Ecuador’s current expansion.” Therefore, these obligations could not be invoked
by Ecuador.**

198. Second, Perenco did not deny that the definition of environmental law in the
Environmental Management Law was relevant; its position was rather that the permissible limits
in RAOHE and TULAS implemented the “significant harm” standard.4°

199. Ecuador replied that this could not be the relationship between the definition and
RAOHE/TULAS, because the “two [would then be] essentially contradictory”, explaining that
TULAS and RAOHE “seek to impose limits on economic activities that are potentially
dangerous to the environment, whereas the ‘significant damage’ standard define[d] recoverable

environmental harm.”““7 The ‘significant harm’ standard [was] perfectly operational without the
need for numerical standards”, the Environmental Management Law’s definition providing “two
operational criteria, by qualifying [significant harm] as all impact that ‘affect[ed] the functioning
of the ecosystem or renewal of its resources’.”##8

200. Perenco countered that this ignored the distinction that the Environmental Management
Law must have intended when it stipulated two separate definitions for “environmental harm”
and “environmental impact.”*#° It followed that “‘environmental harm’ [was] not a mere impact
above background values, but [rather] an impact that [was] a ‘significant’ loss, such that it
‘affects the functioning of the ecosystem or renewal of its resources’.”*°° The permissible limits
in RAOHE and TULAS must be a reflection of this distinction in the Law and if their purpose
was to prevent, using Ecuador’s words, “inasmuch as possible that any such harm [to the
environment] should occur” then “an impact that is permitted [by them] cannot constitute
harm.”45! RAOHE and TULAS provided operators with legal certainty about what kind of
‘impacts’ were ‘significant’ and triggered the requirement to remediate.*>* In fact, Ecuador’s
reliance on the Environmental Management Law exposed a flaw in its ‘background values’ case:
it was premised on proving a “mere ‘alteration of the environment’” which the Environmental
Management Law classified as an "impact” rather than the indicator of “environmental harm”.*°*

201. Ecuador also relied on Professor Crespo’s evidence to support the basis of its
“background values” approach. Professor Crespo’s testimony was that RAOHE and TULAS’s
criteria for remediation must to be understood in light of constitutional provisions, namely, the
obligation to “fully restore” the environment in the event of environmental damage required by
Article 396, paragraph 2, and the reference to “complete reparation” in Article 397 which
concerned duties of the State in the event of environmental damage in proceeding against the
operator(s) of the harmful activity.4* His evidence was that “[b]ackground values are the ones
that are — that allow for the comprehensive reparation; that is to say, for the reparation — for the
remediation back to the original level. That is the way that we should understand background
values; that is to say, as stated in the comprehensive remediation.”*°>

Professor Crespo responded: “Yes. Yes. Agreed. But the concept of full remediation or reparation should prevail;

202. Perenco’s expert, Dr. Bed6n, expressed a different view, stating that there were three
kinds of ways in which human activity could have a negative impact on the environment: (i)
through “tolerable impacts” (activities carried out in the normal course of affairs without the
need for an environmental permit and unregulated by the State), (ii) through “authorized
impacts” (activities carried out in compliance with an environmental permit or license and within
permissible limits) and (iii) through “environmental damage or harm”.*°° In his opinion,
Professor Crespo “fail[ed] to distinguish [between] these concepts, and erroneously treated them
as equivalent categories.”*7

203. Dr. Bed6n considered that Professor Crespo erred in arriving at his conclusion because in
citing Articles 396 and 397 of the 2008 Constitution he was suggesting “without any grounds
that environmental impact and environmental damage [were] equivalent terms.”*°* In Dr.
Bed6n’s view, Articles 396 and 397 referred to the duty of the State to adopt legislation to
address “negative environmental impacts”, not just any impact on the environment, and
established a strict liability regime for environmental matters and reiterated the duty of the State
to take action to safeguard human health and restore ecosystems.**? However, there was no
reference to the necessity of adopting background values in substitution of regulatory criteria
such as that provided by RAOHE and TULAS.

204. Dr. Bed6n referred in this regard to an academic authority cited by Professor Crespo, that
of the author Mario Pejia Chacon, in a work titled Dajio, responsabilidad y reparacién ambiental
[“Environmental Damage, Liability and Reparation”] which distinguished between “legally
relevant environmental damage” and “acts or omissions [that] are considered legal”:

The legality or illegality of conduct that damages the environment
depends on its conformity or nonconformity with the legal order. Acts or
omissions are considered legal if they accord with the body of laws in
force and, thus, it has the approval or permit of the relevant authorities...

 

Legally relevant environmental damage is that damage that falls within
the category of intolerable, thus it is not every type of damage that
interests environmental law.*°°

205. Perenco further relied on the work of Andrés Betancor, “one of only two academic
sources quoted in [Ecuador’s] Constituent Assembly[’s] report on strict liability for the 2008

 

that is to say, without prejudice of the standard values in RAOHE, full restoration is the original state, the original
condition of the harmed ecosystems. So, we work with background values based on the original values in the
harmed ecosystem.” On re-examination, Professor Crespo reiterated this but added with respect to interpreting
RAOHE cot ently with the principles of the 2008 Constitution that “in case of doubt, the Constitution prevails.”

Constitution”, and who in a text entitled /nstituciones de Derecho Ambiental [Institutions for
Environmental Law] opined:

If the licit act causes damages in accordance with the Law...there would
be no sanction or reparation.The legal problem refers to when the
damage is licit: licit damage is damage which is not covered by any legal
duty to repair, because the law tolerates or allows it to because it is not
significant or important, according to the social value legally
formalized...Consequently the acts covered by the standards and the
authorizations, and that cause damages [sic] do not constitute an
environmental violation and there is no duty to repair them.**!

206. Replying on Dr. Bed6én’s evidence, Perenco submitted that the “very purpose” of
RAOHE and TULAS was to “define what constitute[d] impermissible harm to the environment
under Ecuadorian law.”*? The opening lines of Table 6 of RAOHE confirmed this in providing
that RAOHE established “[p]Jermissible limits for the identification and remediation of
contaminated soils in all phases of the hydrocarbon industry.”“° These limits were constructed
with the specific purpose “of encouraging sustainable development.”*** “By employing specific
regulatory limits instead of background values, states such as Ecuador [made] it possible for
industry to operate within clearly defined parameters while still preserving human health and the
environment.”4°

207. Perenco argued that this did not change after the making of the 2008 Constitution and the
introduction of a strict liability regime for environmental liability.*% Article 396 of the
Constitution provides that the obligation to restore the ecosystem is triggered by evidence of
environmental “harm”, which in turn remains defined by Ecuador’s environmental regulations
relating to permissible limits for contaminant and remediation criteria, namely, RAOHE and (to
the extent that RAOHE was inapplicable) TULAS.*”

208. Perenco submitted that this had been accepted by IEMS as far as its evaluative criteria in
the Burlington and the City Oriente proceedings were concerned.** It contended that IEMS then
changed its position in this case without basis*® and that “Ecuador fail[ed] to provide even one
example in which an Ecuadorian court, legal authority, or scholar ha[d] adopted more restrictive
‘background values’ as the test for environmental harm in place of the regulatory criteria.”4”°

Consortium and Petroamazonas consistently tested for compliance with permissible limits rather
than background values.*”

209. Also central to Ecuador’s case that background values must be applied in order to
establish the full extent of environmental remediation was its reliance on the 2008 Constitution’s
recognition that Nature (“pacha mama”) was itself the subject of rights as well as the
codification of the principles of sustainable development and the right of the human being to live
in an environment free from contamination.4”

210. Perenco responded that these principles have been part of Ecuadorian law since the
1970s, particularly in the 1984 and 1998 Constitutions, and during this time RAOHE and
TULAS were promulgated and applied. In this regard, at the hearing, counsel for Perenco took
Professor Crespo through a chronological review of various instruments applicable in Ecuador in
the 1970s, 80s and 90s, to demonstrate that while strict liability became a feature of the 2008
Constitution, many of the environmental principles recognised in the Constitution, from which
RAOHE and TULAS derived their content and approach, were in fact carried over from
Ecuadorian legal rules that pre-dated the 2008 Constitution.*7*

211. For example, Professor Crespo acknowledged that the Hydrocarbons Law, promulgated
in 1971, manifested the “obligation of sustainability for operators”, that “Ecuador [had
recognised] a constitutional duty for the State to protect the environment since 1983”,4” that the
“1978 Constitution was amended in 1983 to recognize a right of the human being to live in an
environment free of contamination”,*”> and this carried over to the 1998 Constitution (Article 86)
and then to the 2008 Constitution.‘”° These were not novel principles that in turn caused a
fundamental shift in the scope of environmental harm.

212. Thus, Perenco submitted that the “background values” approach had “no basis in law or
accepted scientific practice.”*7’ It would require “operators to explore and produce oil without
making any impact on the environment whatsoever”, and would render “obsolete” Ecuador’s
“detailed regulatory regime governing permissible impacts.”*”* It would require oilfields to be
remediated to a “pristine state of nature, as they existed before any human activity ever took
place on the land in question, even when the fields continue to be in operation”, a reference to the

fact that since July 2009 when the Consortium suspended operations, Ecuador has sustained and
in some instances expanded oil production in the Blocks.*”

213. Perenco contended that the real reason why background values had been employed in this
case was the “obvious tactical purpose” of inflating the remediation costs by over US$1.3 billion,
this accounting for “more than half’ of Ecuador’s claim.**°

214. Perenco also challenged Ecuador’s alternative case, based on RAOHE and TULAS. In its
view, Ecuador “misapplie[d] these regulations by mischaracterizing areas that are almost entirely
‘industrial’ or ‘agricultural zones’ — with permissible threshold limits suitable to such areas — as
more demanding ‘sensitive ecosystems’.”**! The “vast majority” of the areas in Blocks 7 and 21
are not “sensitive ecosystems”.**? It submitted that “[s]uch a mistaken characterization defies the
actual use of the land that is plainly apparent to any observer — areas that with Ecuador’s prior
approval include wells, pits, flares, tanks, cement berms, and roads” and stood in stark contrast to
“Ecuador’s own longstanding practice prior to the onset of the present dispute...[i]n countless
environmental impact studies, requests for approval, environmental audits and other
documents...that the areas in the Blocks where the Consortium’s operations took place are
industrial zones.”**

215. Mr. Wilfrido Saltos, Perenco’s Quality, Safety, Health and Environment supervisor for
Blocks 7 and 21, testified that in his experience, the Consortium and Ecuador routinely applied
the industrial and agricultural land-use criteria in Blocks 7 and 21, particularly with respect to
well pads and CPFs that were consistently characterised as being subject to industrial soils
criteria.“*4 Much of the land surrounding Blocks 7 and 21 platforms and facilities are cultivated
with African palm trees, plantains and cocoa trees.*** Mr. Saltos affirmed that areas bordering
Coca CPF, Coca 6, Coca 8, Gacela 2, Gacela CPF, Lobo 1, Lobo 3 and Oso 9, among others,

than “sensitive ecosystems” criteria.**°

216. Perenco asserted that two-thirds of the samples tested by IEMS (and included in its report
submitted with Ecuador’s Counter-Memorial) would have been found compliant had the proper
land use criteria been applied.**’ This accounted for over US$885 million of Ecuador’s US$2.4
billion claim.*** (This will be examined in further detail below in the discussion of the expert
evidence presented by GSI and IEMS.)

D. Introduction to the expert evidence on the state of the Blocks

217. The Parties’ experts referred to a number of key concepts when defining an impact on the
environment. The most important such concept is the notion of a “regulatory exceedance.” This
occurs “when the concentration of a particular contaminant in a given sample of soil or water
exceed[ed] the legal limit.”4*°

218. Turning to the experts’ evaluation of the environmental conditions of the Blocks,
Ecuador submitted that IEMS’ evidence demonstrated that the contamination left behind in the
Blocks posed a health risk and has affected, and is continuing to affect, “the functioning of the
ecosystem and the renewability of natural resources”, a phrase taken from the definition of
“environmental harm” in the Environmental Management Law and relied upon by Ecuador as
triggering Perenco’s obligation to “fully restore” the Blocks in accordance with Article 396 of
Ecuador’s Constitution.*”°

219. TEMS undertook a series of site investigation and sampling programmes in Blocks 7 and
21.°! It conducted four rounds of on-field investigation, collecting and testing soil and
groundwater samples for hydrocarbon compounds and heavy metals.*” In total, IEMS took some
2,786 soil samples and 92 groundwater samples from Blocks 7 and 21.4%

220. Ecuador contended that applying Base Values to the results of the samples tested was the
“only methodology that accord[ed] with the strict liability regime of the 2008 Ecuadorian
Constitution...and the mandate to fully restore the ecosystems.” It submitted that both
RAOHE and TULAS “expressly acknowledge[d]” Base Values, and in some cases that this
exceeded the regulatory thresholds.*?> Thus, where the level of an oilfield-related element
revealed by the sample exceeded the values at which it naturally appeared, as discerned from
samples taken in areas of the Blocks untouched by hydrocarbon activities (the “Base Values”
case), IEMS concluded there was soil contamination that required remediation.*°° IEMS also

prepared an alternative case, its “regulatory exceedances” case, in which it measured its
sampling results against the standards stipulated by RAOHE, and where applicable, TULAS.*%”

221. TEMS asserted that it had found significant volumes of contaminated soil in the Blocks,
around 1,867,835 m? above background levels or 691,444 m? above regulatory criteria and
ground water pollution by hydrocarbons and/or heavy metals in all locations that it tested.4%
TEMS’ and Ecuador’s criticism of the analysis performed by Perenco’s expert, GSI, was that they
did not undertake a proper analysis of the environmental condition of the Blocks in accordance
with the principles of the 2008 Constitution because they failed to apply Base Values, whether in
Perenco’s 2008 audits or in the studies GSI prepared for the purpose of this arbitration.*°? In the
alternative, Ecuador submitted that if the regulatory criteria of RAOHE applied, GSI had failed
to apply the correct criteria when investigating the Blocks.*” In its view, the stricter standards
prescribed by RAOHE for a “sensitive ecosystem” ought to have been used, rather than the less
stringent industrial and agricultural area standards.”°°!

E. First round of expert reports of IEMS and GSI

222. IEMS submitted its first expert report in December of 2011.°°? Its stated objective was to
“determine whether the operations of the Block 7 and Block 21 Consortium ha[d] resulted in soil
and groundwater pollution in its respective areas of operation.”°°? It asserted that its
methodology was based on the “general guidelines of the standards of the American Society of
Testing Materials.”>°*

223. Its study was undertaken in three stages: a preliminary assessment of the blocks to
identify sites that were likely to evince contamination (otherwise referred to as “Recognized
Environmental Conditions” or “RECs”), testing of samples taken from the sites and a further
examination of the blocks and information that it was provided in order to identify other
potentially contaminated sites.*° In its first stage, IEMS identified 29 sites, and in its second
stage confirmed that 27 of the 29 sites were contaminated by hydrocarbons, heavy metals or a

Oso, Mono, Jaguar and Condor fields of Block 7, and the Yuralpa, Waponi, Sumino and Nemoca
fields of Block 21.5%”

224. In determining whether the sites were contaminated, IEMS advocated for the application
of Base Values. It asserted that in “its expert opinion...the criteria provided for in Ecuadorian
legislation ... should not, as a rule, be used to determine the environmental liability of operators
of hydrocarbon activities.”°° It reasoned that since everyone possessed the right to an
“environment in optimum conditions for human development”, any release of contaminants that
caused an “unacceptable risk to the health of the surrounding population must be mitigated.”>
TEMS concluded that the regulatory limits should not be applied because they “/did] not appear
to be based on the protection of the health of the ecosystem or of the people who live in the
impacted areas.”*'° For this purpose, IEMS collected and tested 12 soil samples in areas with no
industrial activity in Blocks 7 and 21 “in order to determine the concentrations of contaminants
naturally existing in the environment.”>!! These formed its Base Values.*!? It applied these
values to the classification of any impact caused by heavy metals (nickel, cadmium, lead, barium
and vanadium).>!? Where heavy metal concentration was above the “analytical detection limit”
but below the base value, it was classified a “low impact”.>'+ IEMS did not apply this analysis to
the classification of Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons because it considered that “in view of the
characteristics of the area of study, this element is not expected to naturally exist in the soil”.>!°
It concluded that a Base Value of 0 mg/kg would apply.*!® IEMS also included in its analysis
parameters that were not set by RAOHE; namely, pH (an indication of acidity or alkalinity),
electrical conductivity, barium and vanadium.>!7

225. ITEMS also prepared an alternative case based on the regulatory criteria that it considered
applied: RAOHE Annex 2 of Table 6 (TPH, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, cadmium, nickel
and lead) and TULAS Book 6, Annex 2, Table 2 (barium and vanadium).°!* It stated that “due to
the fragility of the environment and the importance of preserving environmental resources in the
area, [it] decided, based on its expert criteria, to apply the permissible limits for sensitive
ecosystems” in Table 6, Annex 2, of RAOHE.®!?

226. IEMS reported that “over 93% of the areas [it] tested...yielded concentrations of
hydrocarbons and/or heavy metal contaminants above” Base Values, this translating to 96,908
m? of soil requiring remediation.*”° In its alternative regulatory thresholds case, IEMS reported
that some 89% of the areas tested exceeded the permitted exceedances standards, this translating
to 63,169 m* of soil requiring remediation.**! In determining the quantity of soil requiring
remediation, IEMS utilised ArcView GIS 10.0 geostatistical modeling software.*7

227. IEMS also collected 61 groundwater samples from seven sites in the Blocks*** and

reported that 50 samples evinced contamination by heavy metals (such as zinc, barium, copper,
chrome, nickel) in concentrations exceeding the regulatory limits.°*+ (In testing the groundwater,
TEMS did not use Base Values because that would have “required complex, lengthy and costly
hydrological studies of Blocks 7 and 21.”**> Instead, as noted in its second report, it compared its
sampling results to the values set forth in Table 5, Annex 1, Book VI, of TULAS.**°)

228. IEMS informed the Tribunal in its first report that since its investigation was ongoing it
would present its overall estimation of remediation costs at a later date.*?’ Its preliminary
estimate was US$ 405 million to remediate contaminated soil (Base Values) or US$ 243 million
(regulatory limits), and a range of US$ 12 million to US$ 79 million for groundwater
remediation.*7*

229. As noted above, the third stage of ITEMS’ investigation was identifying additional
potentially contaminated sites based on recognised environmental conditions (“RECs”). In its
first report IEMS reported that this stage was ongoing, but it had identified 44 more sites in
addition to the 27 it had already concluded exhibited contamination that merited an
assessment.°”? These sites were located in the Coca, Gacela, Jaguar, Lobo, Oso, Mono,
Payamino and Punino fields in Block 7, and the Yuralpa field in Block 21.°°°

treatment used (IEMS ER I, p 69). IEMS named other sites it intended to investigate for groundwater contamination;

230. These sites were the subject of IEMS’ second report, which was produced in April 2012
and stood as a more comprehensive evaluation of the information it had collected from the 74
operational sites in Blocks 7 and 21.3! The results reflected “more than 2,900 soil and
underground water samples [collected] at different depths” by IEMS.>*? IEMS reported that it
confirmed soil contamination in 70 out of the 74 sites studied (94% of the sites investigated).>*?
The sites were located in the Coca, Gacela, Céndor Norte, Gacela, Jaguar, Lobo, Mono, Oso,
Payamimo, Punino, Yuralpa, Chonta, Dayuno, Nemoca and Sumino fields.>*4 The volume of soil
that IEMS quantified as requiring remediation was 1,086,883 m (Base Values) or 1,012,245 m
(regulatory limits).°*° As for groundwater contamination, it reported that 100% of the 18 sites it
had tested yielded concentrations above the thresholds set by Ecuadorian regulations: in the
Payamino, Coca, Oso, Gacela, Jaguar and Mono fields of Block 7 and the Yuralpa, Dayuno and
Waponi fields of Block 21.°*° It identified a further 52 sites that it intended to investigate for
possible groundwater contamination.>*”

231. In quantifying the volume of soil to be remediated, IEMS utilised ArcView GIS 10.0
software.°** IEMS drew a 10-meter radius around each sample (“the buffer”) and defined the
boundary of the area (‘the bounds”) by connecting the outer limits of the outermost buffers
within a platform.>*? It then added calculations for the volume to be estimated, modeling 6
different layers of depth (from 0 to 1 meter deep, 1.01-2 meters and so on).*#° It assessed each
layer separately, determining whether it contained contaminated soil on the basis of whether it
contained at least 3 samples displaying contamination.**! If it contained less than 3 samples,
“these samples were not considered in the quantification model.” IEMS then divided the area
within each boundary into cells of 1 square meter each, categorised them (as either non-
contaminated, contaminated with concentrations above Base Values but below the regulatory
thresholds, or contaminated with concentrations above regulatory levels), and then applied the
‘inverse distance weighed” method of interpolation within ArcView GIS.* This method
estimated cell values “by averaging the values of sample data points in the area surrounding each
cell”, meaning that the closer a sampling point was to the centre of the cell being estimated, the
more influence or weight it had in the average.>*

232. In total, IEMS determined that its estimated cost of remediation amounted to US$
2,200,480,958 (base values case) or US$ 895,553,066 (regulatory case) for soil remediation,

adding to this water remediation at a range of US$ 41,277,600 (best case scenario) to US$
265,601,700 (worst case scenario).**> These costs were premised on ex-situ remediation™® (with
the exception of the best case scenario method for groundwater remediation), based on “the
treatment costs suggested by the Federal Remediation Technologies Roundtable (FRTR) and
other international bibliographical sources.”**” Its breakdown of estimated cost according to the
kind of contamination was as follows:

(i) Soil contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons: US $280 per cubic metre of soil.
This is “between the ranges of costs for the remediation of similar contaminated
soils by treatments of the same type that IEMS ha[d] recently used.”*8

(ii) Soils contaminated with heavy metals: US$ 320 per cubic metre of soil. This was
arrived at on the “basis of the works conducted by IEMS and its commercial
partners in various projects in Latin America (particularly in Mexico) during the
last 5 years.”>*?

(iii) Soil contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons and heavy metals: US$ 240 per
cubic metre of soil. This was based “partially” “on information provided orally by
providers of remediation work in the area.”*°°

(iv) | Contamination of groundwater: The best and worst case scenario related to two
different methods for the treatment of underground water, using cost estimates
taken from studies conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency of the
United States of America.*>! The worst case scenario was based on the Pump and
Treat System, which consists of extracting contaminated underground water for
ex situ treatment, and quantified at an average yearly cost of US$ 9,870,000.°°?
The best case scenario was based on the Permeable Reactive Interceptive Barriers
method, an in-situ treatment requiring, as its name suggests, installation below the

of the locations it tested for underground water contamination was positive, it was of the view that all the remaining
production facili of Blocks 7 and 21 should be tested. It identified the cost of undertaking such a comprehensive
evaluation as a further US$ 3,380, 000. (Supplemental Memorial, paragraph 311.) Finally, aside from soil and water
pollution in the Blocks, IEMS noted environmental damage in the form of deforestation, reduction in air quality and
noise pollution were also likely effects of oilfield operations but were difficult to quantify (IEMS ER II, p 3).

235. GSI explained that its investigation began with a review of IEMS’ first and second
reports in order to “identify locations where soil impacts may be present based on applicable
Ecuador criteria and to characterize apparent data gaps, errors and deficiencies” in TEMS’
work.*°8 This was followed by a “detailed visual and physical inspection” of 58 facilities, this
including “54 of the 55 facilities for which IEMS had made claims regarding soil remediation
costs per their ‘regulatory’ criteria (i.e., all 55 sites except the Dayuno well site, due to access
restrictions).”°°’ GSI used this information for its sampling and testing campaign, undertaking
field investigations in the Blocks from March through to June 2012, collecting soil samples at 24
sites and groundwater samples at 16 sites. GSI analysed sampling results both from its own
and IEMS’ fieldwork, amounting to a total of 3,194 soil samples and 113 groundwater
samples.**! It screened IEMS’ test results in the first instance by using the “primary indicators of
oilfield materials”*°?: TPH (or Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons), barium, electrical conductance or
chloride.* It used the sampling results it considered relevant to delineate those areas where

“chemicals related to oilfield activities are present in soil or groundwater at concentrations in
excess of applicable Ecuador regulatory criteria.”**

236. GSI concluded there was “no evidence of widespread adverse environmental or
ecological effects in the Blocks”, and what environmental impact there was in the Blocks was
minimal and in volumes and intensity that posed no danger to human health or the
environment.°® In this connection, it asserted that Ecuadorian regulatory criteria were “more
stringent than internationally accepted health-based screening levels.”*° It reported that 53 of
the 74 facilities investigated by IEMS were in fact “free of environmental impacts, as defined
based upon applicable regulations and health-based screening levels.”°°’ In the remaining sites,
GSI discovered some incidence of concentrations of oilfield related chemicals in excess of
regulatory limits: “[f]ive principal facilities (Payamino 2-8, Payamino 1, Mono CPF, Gacela 1-8
and Coca 18-19) present[ed] impacted soil volumes of 1000 cubic meters (m*) or more, while
smaller soil volumes are present at an additional 11 sites, corresponding to a total soil volume of
approximately 33,415 m° for all sites combined.”>° Its preliminary estimate for the cost of
remediating the soil at these sites was US$ 9.1 million,*© based on “the actual costs for
engineering, labor, equipment, and related remediation services in Ecuador’ and reflecting on-
site containment and remediation procedures.*”°

237. GSI qualified this estimate in asserting that remediation may not be necessary because
“no risk is posed to human health at any of these locations and the majority of the soil impacts
(95% of cost) are related to causes that pre-date current regulatory standards, as well as
Consortium operations.”°’! GSI further submitted that approximately 76% of the total soil
remediation costs were related to events that occurred “prior to October 1990.”>7? In addition,
GSI reported that it had found no groundwater impacts in the 18 sites identified by IEMS, and
asserted that IEMS’ findings resulted from “incorrect sampling methods.”°>”7

238. GSI employed a delineation approach to estimate the volume of soil that required
remediation.*” It explained that this method included linear interpolation amongst sampling
points, rather than applying the “inverse distance weighted” method as IEMS did, and all the

limits may be present; however, in the time available for our field program, GSI did not conduct sampling and
testing to confirm or delineate the extent of impacted soils at these 5 locations.”

“starting with any sample point that show[ed] an exceedance and then taking more samples
surrounding that point, continuing to step outwards until clean soil [was] found.”°”° GSI said that
it performed this for each of the 1 metre depths that IEMS considered and which GSI identified
depicted sampling results that merited an assessment.*”’ GSI submitted that in contrast to IEMS’
“hypothetical projections” in its inverse distance weighted interpolation, its method was based on
“abundant actual data”, making “use of all the samples — including all of IEMS’ own data — as
well as real topographic and other features particular to each site.”>7*

239. A significant portion of GSI’s report was devoted to its review of IEMS’ expert evidence
in its first and second reports.*”? GSI asserted that the methodology that IEMS had adopted to
locate, investigate and model samples in the Blocks were marked by “pervasive and systematic
flaws.”

240. First, GSI asserted that its use of “indicator parameters” was to be preferred to the
approach taken by IEMS.**! It identified three primary sources of potential environmental effects
in the oil production process.**” These were drilling muds, crude oil and formation water.**?

241. Drilling muds were used to lubricate and loosen the earth through which the drill bit must
pass, and once that has been achieved are pulled back up to the surface along with chunks of soil,
crushed rock and small traces of crude.**4 GSI observed that in the early 1990s, the then-practice
in Ecuador of discharging the mud cuttings into the surrounding environment was suspended,
and operators were required to contain the substances in specially prepared “mud pits” in order
for them to be re-vegetated.**° Drilling mud can be water-based (generally consisting of water,
bentonite and barite) or oil-based (diesel).**° Water-based muds, which are commonly used in
Ecuador, can contain large quantities of barium sulphate or barite.**’ Thus, it is natural to find
quantities of barium in mud pits.***

242. Turning to the second possible source of contamination, when a well is initially drilled, it
produces “test crude”, which is crude used to determine the well’s production capacity and the
quality of the oil.**? In GSI’s opinion, the only relevant measurement for detecting the presence

591),

As a basis for design of our field sampling program, the IEMS soil test
results were carefully reviewed to identify locations where soil impacts
are present or absent, based upon consideration of applicable Ecuador
regulatory criteria. For characterization of oilfield-related soil impacts,
the IEMS soil test results for the primary indicators of oilfield materials
(i.e. barium for drilling mud; TPH for crude oil; soil electrical
conductance for produced water) were compared to Ecuador regulatory
criteria for the relevant land use. The presence of other chemicals in the
soil, in the absence of a primary indicator (e.g., nickel in the absence of
elevated barium or TPH), cannot be caused by an oilfield material and
was therefore not retained for further investigation. Similarly, soil test
results from within closed mud/ cuttings pits were not considered
evidence of soil impacts, as these closed pits are specifically authorized
and required under applicable Ecuador regulations (Acuerdo 621, Decree
2982, and RAOH Decree 1215) and the government-approved
Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) for oilfield operations in the
Consortium area.

Evaluation of the full IEMS database of soil tests results provides the
following information regarding the nature of potential soil impacts
among the 1243 soil sample locations collected outside of closed mud/
cuttings pits (excluding the 192 clean soil samples used by IEMS for
characterization of background soil conditions):

* No Evidence of Soil Impact by Oilfield Materials: 91% of soil sample
locations

* Apparent Drilling Mud Impact: 6% of soil sample locations (elevated
barium, outside of proper mud/ cuttings pit)

+ Apparent Crude Oil Impact: 4% of soil sample locations (elevated
TPH)

¢ Apparent Drilling Mud and Crude Oil Impact at Same Location: 0.7%
of soil sample locations

+ Apparent Produced Water Salinity Impact: 0.1% of soil sample
locations (elevated electrical conductance)

These data show that, at the vast majority of the IEMS soil sample
locations (91%), there is no evidence of impact by oilfield materials.”**?

In arguing that the only relevant indicators of contamination from oilfield operations was

TPH, barium (for drilling mud) and soil electrical conductance (for produced water),° GSI
differed from IEMS, which considered that the presence of heavy metals in the soil could also

result from drilling operations.°°* GSI disagreed with IEMS on this, arguing that crude oil was
not a significant source of heavy metals and, asserting that in fact “the crude produced in Blocks
7 and 21 contain[ed] far less heavy metal content than the area’s soils.”*** It asserted that IEMS’
allegations of contamination by heavy metals could not be correct because none of these metals
other than barium exist in any oilfield materials (crude, produced water, or drilling muds) in
concentrations above the naturally occurring levels found in local soils.*”°

244. GSI noted further that there were other types of naturally occurring hydrocarbons in the

environment that were unrelated to petroleum exploitation.°°’ A certain level of TPH may be

naturally present in the environment due to the presence of decaying carbon, such as rotting plant
598

matter.

245. Thirdly, a fluid known as “formation water” or “production water” is produced by wells
throughout their operational lives.*°? The presence of formation water in soil is marked by high
concentrations of chloride and high electrical conductivity. Formation water was at one time
discharged into the environment, but in the late 1990s, operators began re-injecting it into
wells.©! GSI explained that Oryx began using this method “near the end of its operatorship of
Block 7 in 1997” and the Consortium “subsequently implemented a comprehensive reinjection
program, repurposing or drilling multiple wells as injection wells.”©? Thus, throughout Perenco's
operation of the blocks, formation water was not being discharged but rather was being re-
injected into the wells. In any event, GSI asserted that the formation water produced in Blocks 7
and 21 did not contain significant amounts of heavy metals.

246. Aside from the alleged conceptual flaw in IEMS’ even employing a “background values”
case, GSI challenged IEMS’ method for calculating the “background values”, stating “because
[it] calculates these supposed ‘background values’ as the average level at which the particular
compounds occur in soil samples taken from unaffected areas, Ecuador is effectively contending
that even some of the admittedly unaffected natural soil is actually ‘contaminated’ and requires
remediation simply because it contains ‘above average’ levels of naturally occurring
compounds.”®* Instead of using the upper range of the observed sampling results from its “clean

finding is consistent with many prior investigations of crude oil composition, which demonstrate that metals are not
a significant component of crude oils.” Claimant’s Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 238 and 270; cf. IEMS ER II, p 3.

soil samples”, IEMS had calculated the 99% upper confidence limit which “represents a small
margin of uncertainty added onto the mean concentration, resulting in an adjusted mean
concentration that is slightly above the average, but far below the upper range of concentrations
observed in clean samples.” As a result, IEMS “erroneously declared” 80% of the “clean soils
at all sites to be ‘contaminated.””°°

247. GST also asserted that IEMS mischaracterised areas that were “almost entirely ‘industrial’
or ‘agricultural’ zones — with permissible threshold limits suitable to such areas — as more
demanding ‘sensitive ecosystems’.””’ “Approximately two-thirds of the samples that Ecuador
claimed show[ed] ‘contamination’ under these incorrect criteria (‘sensitive ecosystems’) were in
fact fully compliant under proper land use criteria (‘industrial’ or ‘agricultural’)”, this accounting
for over US$885 million of Ecuador’s US$2.4 billion claim.°*

248. As previously noted, RAOHE Table 6 and TULAS Table 3 present multiple sets of
criteria, and the permissible limits for industrial land use are more permissive than those for
agricultural land use, and in turn for ‘sensitive ecosystems’. Perenco contended that the land in
and around the oilfield sites in Blocks 7 and 21 were either used for an industrial or an
agricultural purpose.” This was said to be consistent with RAOHE, Table 6, which pointed to
the “posterior use that will be given to the remediated soil”, and referred specifically to the
Heritage of State Natural Areas (Patrimonio de Areas Naturales del Estado), and Ecuador’s own
practice.°!° Examples of Ecuadorian authorities’ having accepted the application of industrial

Waponi-Ocatoe and Nemoca.*! The Payamino sites were examples of sites that intersected with
a protected area but which in fact were used for industry and agriculture.

252. GSI applied sensitive ecosystems criteria to “the small amount of land that f[ell] within a
designated protected area, despite the fact that the actual land use [did] not accord with the
designation”, correlating to 89 of IEMS’ 1243 sampling locations.°? It otherwise applied
agricultural or industrial land-use criteria in its analysis.°**

253. GSI asserted further that IEMS had “systematically manipulated laboratory data” by
assigning positive values to samples that in fact reported no detectable presence of target
compound. For example, “if the detection limit for Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (“TPH”)
[was] 200 mg/kg, and the laboratory actually found no detectable presence of TPH, IEMS
nevertheless identified the sample as containing a contamination of 199.99 mg/kg of TPH”.°°
GSI asserted that this was in breach of accepted protocols, which in the event that a laboratory
reports “non-detectable”, requires the sample to be labeled as “clean.”°?” GSI contended that this
“infected 79% of the results” or 2082 of the 2620 soil samples represented in its first and second
reports.©* In this connection, GSI challenged IEMS’ classification of samples as presenting
concentrations above the detection limit but below “background values” as a “low impact”,
stating that under common use of the term “soil would only be considered ‘impacted’ if the
concentration exceeded both the regulatory limit and natural background”, this corresponding to
the “final ‘highly impacted’ tier of the IEMS classification system.”°”?

254. TEMS was also alleged to have “systematically” treated the contents of “clearly defined
‘pits’”, which are “areas specially constructed — with Ecuador’s approval — to hold oil drilling
byproducts, especially so-called ‘drilling muds’ that contain heavy metals like barium”, as if they
were “regular soil.”©° It took samples from inside closed mud pits, applied the testing
methodology for regular soil instead of that applicable to mud pits, namely leachate testing, and
compared the results to the permissible levels for regular soil in RAOHE Table 6 rather than for

Consortium attempted to drill three additional wells on the platform. It provided the Ministry with the coordinates

leachates from mud pits in Table 7.°! The significance of this is that IEMS came to the
“conclusion that the areas [were] ‘contaminated’ when in fact they simply contain[ed] the very
compounds that they [were] supposed to contain under Ecuadorian law.”°? This invalidated any
samples IEMS took from inside closed pits, that is, pits that had already been converted with
Ministry approval into containment areas to prevent migration of contaminants, this representing
“22% of the 2,629 samples” in question.°*

255. This also invalidated sampling results that were evaluated against Table 6 of RAOHE,
rather than Table 7. In Perenco’s view, mud pits are to be tested using a different methodology
and criteria under RAOHE, Table 7, rather than Table 6, because they are designed to contain the
discharge of industrial substances stemming from the drilling process, and naturally contain
concentrations of barium higher than that found in the surrounding soil.°*4 Thus, Table 7 permits
higher levels of an environmental impact than Table 6 permits. Perenco submitted that
Ecuadorian authorities had historically acknowledged this and applied the Table 7 regulatory
criteria to the investigation of mud pits, such as in the case of the 2008 environmental audit of
Block 7.°° IEMS did likewise in its expert report in the City Oriente proceeding.*°

 

256. Table 7 also employed a different methodology for testing because, in line with a mud
pit’s function, it is concerned not with contaminants in the material contained within the pit but
“whether the contents ‘leach’ impermissible amounts of various substances into underground
water sources.”°7 This explains why RAOHE Table 6 sets out concentrations in mg/kg,
compared to Table 7, which provides concentration limits in mg/1.°* It is also evidenced in how
Table 7 distinguished between the limits applicable to pits which have an impermeable liner and
those which do not, and imposes stricter limits for the latter.©°?

257. Perenco submitted that this was the methodology endorsed by the State up until this
proceeding, relying in this regard on a 2003 environmental report on specific sites in Block 21
(Yuralpa Centro | pit) and the 2008 audit of Block 7, where leachate testing was used and its

results submitted to the Ministry.“ IEMS did not employ the leachate testing method in
collecting its 624 samples.*!

258. For its part, GSI submitted that its analysis of the 624 soil samples “confirm[ed] that the
concentrations of cadmium, lead, nickel, and vanadium in these drilling materials [were] actually
below the background levels that exist{ed] naturally in area soils” and barium, which was
detected in some areas at levels higher than those found in natural soils, appeared in a non-toxic
form; barium sulfate — “the only source of barium in oilfield operations” — rather than barium
chloride, and for that reason posed no harm to human health or the environment.®4?

259. GSI also contended that IEMS’ estimation of the volume of allegedly contaminated soil
was exaggerated and significantly in error as a result of the misuse of the ArcView GIS Spatial
Analyst software.“ The software is designed to “interpolate between two points” but “IEMS
programmed it to extrapolate from a given point outwards without any constraining boundary”,
and as a result “falsely depict[ed] vast and sweeping areas of contamination” which included
areas in which no soil sampling had been taken that demonstrated an exceedance or which defied
sampling results that depicted no contamination, and all the while ignoring the actual topography
of the area which would influence how the contamination might naturally spread.

260. GSI explained that the mapping algorithm of the software, the “Inverse-Distance
Weighted Averaging” or IDW, is intended for use “in interpolation between measured data
position, with very limited extrapolation beyond the immediate area of the sample locations.”*°
It added that IDW was “very poor” at extrapolation, but that is precisely what IEMS used it
towards with the result that their modeling was “extrapolation to extreme distances beyond the
footprint of their data points.”°

261. Thus, the manner in which the bounds of each site within the model are drawn stood to
have a compounding impact on the extent of the contamination marked by the software.
Examining IEMS’ method, GSI reported that they assumed that each soil sample represented
concentrations within a 10-meter radius ‘buffer area” surrounding the data point, which it
represented by circles inscribed around each sampling location.“” This despite the fact that
“many of the soil samples collected by IEMS within 10 m of each other display[ed] very
different chemical concentrations.”™* IEMS then drew a ‘boundary’ “corresponding to a
rectangular area drawn tangential to the outermost buffer areas” within a site, and programmed

the software to extrapolate and fill in the area.“? In programming the software, IEMS input
parameters which resulted in its extrapolating and filling in the boundary area with model soil
“impacts” which in many cases ignored the fact that there was no data or the data showed no
such condition.°°

262. GSI claimed that this method was “novel and unique to IEMS and [was] not supported by
either publications or common standards of practice for geostatistical mapping.”®! This led
Perenco to assert that this erroneous approach, coupled with other errors discussed in this
section, “invalidate[d] every single one of ITEMS’ soil volume calculations.”°? Proper
delineation, incorporating the topography and using compliant samples to define the boundaries
of the contaminated area, would produce results which, in GSI’s opinion, established volumes of
contamination that at best amounted to 1% or 2% of the volumes presented by IEMS for the
same sites.

263. GSI then asserted that IEMS had “systematically failed to properly filter groundwater
samples”, resulting in the laboratory results’ reflecting particulates of which were essentially soil
and, as such, producing values which were “scientifically impossible”, thereby “invalidat[ing] all
of IEMS’ groundwater samples.”°** When GSI sampled groundwater using the correct filtration
methods, all of those samples were fully compliant.®>

264. In order to properly sample groundwater, technical guidelines require that the samples be
clear of soil particles. Annex 5 of RAOHE provides that the methodology for testing the
presence of heavy metals in water shall include filtration.*’ GSI inspected the monitoring wells
left in place by IEMS and “confirm[ed] that they [did] not conform to industry standards for
groundwater sampling.”°** This gave rise to unreliable sampling results because when IEMS
added nitric acid preservative in order to stabilise dissolved metal concentrations prior to testing,
the acid dissolved the solid sediment particles that had been trapped, thereby exponentially
elevating the metal concentrations to levels that could not be naturally present in water. For
example, IEMS reported barium levels in its groundwater results as high as 8.28 mg/L, when in
fact the maximum solubility limit for barium sulfate in groundwater is 3.1 mg/L.°°

265. Moreover, IEMS failed to apply the correct regulatory criteria to the results of its
groundwater tests.©! It used the reference criteria of TULAS, Book VI, Annex 1, Table 5, which
GSI explained applied only to water obtained from soil with a clay content of less than 25% and

an organic material content less than 10%.°? IEMS applied Table 5 to all of its samples
regardless of the type of soil from which the sample was obtained: “Review of geologic logs
from locations at or near the groundwater monitoring wells (available for 49 IEMS groundwater
sample points) shows that, at 56% of the IEMS groundwater sampling locations, the soil
composition [was] primarily clay.”°?

266. GSI sampled 15 of the locations identified by ITEMS, and reported that their tests
confirmed that the presence of metal compounds above the Ecuadorian regulatory standards
occurred “entirely as a result of extraneous soil particles.”* For these reasons, Perenco
submitted that Ecuador’s claim for remediation of contaminated groundwater lacked any
foundation.

267. Finally, GSI challenged IEMS’ remediation cost estimates as wholly unsupported,
asserting IEMS had failed to “cite a single source for remediation cost estimates in Ecuador, or
justify the enormous percentages added for alleged planning and contingency.”°°° IEMS ignored
actual cost data for the clean-up of sites by companies operating within Ecuador.” GSI
submitted that a reasonable and justifiable estimate was “in fact below US$100 per cubic meter”,
but IEMS’ average remediation unit price was US$280 per cubic meter, this in turn inflating its
claim “by over 400%.”

KF. Third expert report of IEMS and second expert report of RPS

268. ITEMS’ third report, submitted in February 2013, responded to GSI’s criticisms and
confirmed the reliability of its modeling and the results it produced as reported in its first and
second reports (with the exception of three errors). IEMS explained that it undertook a fourth
site inspection following the receipt of GSI’s report, and collected additional soil samples at 22
sites.” It asserted that, as a result, “[w]ith the exception of a few spreadsheet errors, GSI’s
contentions are without merit and IEMS’ conclusions as to the extent of contamination and the
costs of remediation are correct.”®”! In its view, GSI had relied upon a “false and misleading
methodology and, hence, reached incorrect conclusions in their misplaced attempts to downplay
the full extent of the environmental damage” in Blocks 7 and 21.97

269. Ecuador also challenged GSI’s credibility and in particular that of its President, Mr. John
Connor.*’? It alleged that: throughout “his career, Mr. Connor has been at the service of private
oil companies, systematically testifying in their favour and refusing to allocate liability for
environmental harm” and pointed specifically to work that Mr. Connor and GSI had done in the
well-known dispute between Ecuador and Chevron which suggested that GSI had engaged in a
results-driven exercise of looking only at clean samples in order to exonerate the party which had
retained it.”

270. Turning to IEMS’ third report, IEMS first asserted that the list of contaminants that it
examined in the samples it collected were elements “properly associated with oilfield activities”
and, in any event, represented the chemicals that the regulations were concerned with and “set
forth action levels for...without any requirement that these chemicals be associated with
hydrocarbons, produced water or barium sulfate in order to call for remediation.”°”> In its view,
GSI’s approach rendered “null and void” key elements of RAOHE and TULAS.*’® GSI’s
approach was said to be further contradicted by Perenco’s own prior practice, as evidenced in an
‘Environmental Protection Guide’ it had produced during the course of its operatorship in which
Perenco listed a total of 19 indicators including TPH, barium, cadmium, chromium, lead, and
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.°””

271. Second, IEMS defended its use of the upper end of the confidence interval of the mean
concentrations of the 189 ‘clean’ soil samples it had tested in order to arrive at its background
values.°’* It asserted that its approach was consistent with RAOHE and TULAS, stating that it
“believes that the intent of the regulations is not merely to estimate the sample mean but also the
true population mean.”°”? In order to arrive at a true population mean, the traditional approach
would have been to collect and test all clean soil in the Blocks, but since IEMS could not
practically perform such an exercise, the next best alternative was to apply confidence
intervals.®*° It asserted that by applying the upper end of the confidence interval, it was selecting
a higher concentration and in so doing acting conservatively in the circumstances.™! It further
argued that GSI’s proposed method of arriving at background values was inconsistent with
regulatory requirements in Ecuador.°*?

 

272. ITEMS also responded to GSI’s statement that Ecuadorian regulatory criteria were in fact
more stringent than health-based screening levels, asserting the “risk assessment performed by
GSI is unacceptably flawed and biased”; “[i]t did not include ecological risk” and it
“consider[ed] only one of several human exposure pathways necessary to fully evaluate the
potential risk to human health.”*?

273. Third, IEMS asserted that, contrary to GSI’s claims that drilling mud and the contents of
mud pits were relatively innocuous and posed no significant health risk: “[a]lthough barium
sulfate is relatively insoluble under oxidizing conditions, it is fairly soluble in acidic and
anaerobic conditions, which means that, variations in pH conditions could result in the
dissolution of barium from barium sulfate; thereby, barium would be released to water and soil
during the disposal of drilling wastes.”°** Moreover, the relevant reference criteria were to be
found in Table 6, not Table 7, of RAOHE because Table 7 applied only during the pit closure
process and for a short period thereafter.°*> IEMS challenged GSI’s testing method, submitting
that it collected “samples of the clean soil covers that had been placed over the mud pits at the
time of closure, which implie[d] that: 1) GSI samples represent only the quality of the clean soil
surface; 2) GSI did not identify and therefore, did not know the toxicity of the waste disposed
within pits, and 3) GSI misinterpreted their results equating the concentration of the cover soil to
the fill material of the pits.”°*°

274. ITEMS further challenged GSI’s use of Table 7(b) of RAOHE (criteria governing lined
pits) rather than the more stringent limits established in Table 7(a) (governing unlined pits). It
stated that the choice was “unfounded, as there [was] no evidence of intact impermeable liners
beneath [the] pits” examined in Blocks 7 and 21, but there was evidence that the pits were not
lined, or that their liners had seriously deteriorated.

275. RPS, Ecuador’s other expert, noted in this regard that GSI’s use of Table 7(b) of RAOHE
(criteria governing lined pits) ran afoul of the Consortium’s own practice of applying Table 7(a).
RPS cited examples of pit closure documents for Jaguar 9 from November 2000 and Coca 19
from October 2004 which referred to Table 7(a).°*’ RPS asserted that if GSI had applied Table
7(a) limits, it would have concluded that four of the seven pits that GSI had tested should be
remediated.°*

276. ITEMS submitted in addition that GSI ignored “significant shortcomings” in the
Consortium’s management of mud pits, inconsistent with their obligations under RAOHE and
TULAS.*° The pits were constructed in disregard of applicable regulations, they were not
monitored timeously, they were not tested timeously upon their closure (7 days, 3 months and 6
months after), and their contents were allegedly mixed with clean soil or water in order to dilute
the contamination, a practice that TULAS prohibited.”! The consequences of such omissions by

 

oes IEMS ER III, section 3.2.2, p 25. IEMS added that GSI’s statement that oil-based muds were rarely used in
the blocks was a bald-faced assertion which it could not verify because “the Consortium does not present the drilling
records of the wells, or any other records demonstrating which pits are likely to contain the oil-based wastes, it is not
reasonable to assert that the contents of the pits are similar to normal soils and benign.” (p 25).

the Consortium had not been identified by GSI because of the unreliability of its method of
investigating the pits in Blocks 7 and 21.°

277. TEMS asserted that GSI also incorrectly delineated the size of the pits and the areas that
needed to be tested for leachates. Proper delineation was required to determine whether the pit
was leaking contaminants. IEMS argued that GSI either presented the pits as being “larger than
they really are so as to give the impression that they [were] not leaking and that the pits and their
surrounding areas accordingly require[d] no remediation” or failed to act on evidence of
contamination in area surrounding mud pits such as in the case of the Coca 8 pit where IEMS
had proved exhibited serious contamination but GSI “failed to meaningfully assess the source of
the contamination.”©>

278. Fourth, IEMS asserted that the GSI misinterpreted and misapplied the regulatory criteria
applicable to the environment in the Blocks.®+ “GSI considered that the regulatory levels to be
used were based on the current land use of the areas, completely ignoring the express provisions
of Table 6 of the RAOHE (referring to the future land use).”°> IEMS defended its use of the
sensitive ecosystems criteria,” stating that while areas in the Blocks may not be designated
protected areas, their ecological studies suggested that most displayed characteristics “similar to
those of a National Natural Area.”®’ The fact that several sites are currently being operated or
have been used for industrial purposes in the past is “of no relevance to future land use.”°°®

 

279. Ecuador submitted that the significance of classifying the land based on future use was so
as to “facilitate site reuse”, a term taken from the lexicon of the US Environmental Protection
Agency.” Since the oilfields are “carved out in the middle of the Amazonian jungle”, “entirely
surrounded by rainforest” and their present use for oilfield operations will “inevitably run out”
they are destined to be re-absorbed by the rainforest and can reasonably be anticipated to revert
back to their natural, sensitive ecosystem state. 7°

280. Fifth, IEMS defended its treatment of non-detect analytical results, criticising GSI for
“attempting to obfuscate IEMS’ use of a conservative yet standard technique for handling non-
detect data.””°! It asserted that its method was “a reasonable way to deal with the uncertainty of
laboratory results when these results are reported at below the detection limit, but when field

approach that has been “strongly recommend[ed]” by the US EPA which has opined that “non-
detect samples [are] never [to] be considered to be zero or omitted from the data set (USEPA,
1989).”702

281. In this regard, IEMS cited instances in which GSI itself had substituted non-detect or
other results in its sampling. For example, it used a substitution of 50% of the detection limit for
non-detects on samples for determining background values.’

282. Sixth, IEMS responded to GSI’s criticisms of its modeling technique using the ArcGIS
software.’ It submitted that its choice and use of the IDW algorithm was sound.” It
characterised the parameters that it employed in its geo-mapping software as conservative.’
IEMS explained that its buffer was limited to a 10-meter radius around each sample,””’ and in
assessing whether one of the layers should be mapped it required at least 3 samples exhibiting
contamination.’ If it contained less than 3 samples, “these samples were not considered in the
quantification model.””” It defended the use of the inverse distance weighted method of ArcGIS
as “appropriate and [...] generally accepted by the international scientific community.””!° It
challenged the modeling method adopted by GSI as unrealistically stopping at the position of the
sample that establishes contamination if there are no additional samples further in that direction,
ignoring the factual likelihood that there is further contamination in the area.”!!

283. IEMS contested each of the so-called “key errors” that GSI had identified, asserting they
were “falsely alleged.”’!? For example, the location and the extension of the bounds did not have
a significant impact on the modeling, which is influenced in large part by the algorithm and the
parameters inputted.’!> In any event, “[i]n light of the fact that there was no information about
the environmental liabilities left by the operators of the oilfields prior to 2009, and that complete
records of spills, mud pits, and other environmental incidents were not available, the evaluation
of large bounds was a reasonable and prudent approach.”’"* Its main criticism of GSI’s approach
was that it assumed that the dispersion of contaminants was uniform and predictable’!> when in

TEMS used a variable search radius set to 12 samples but in an attempt to keep its results

concentration sample on the samples in its vicinity) of 3 which tended to decrease the size of the
“hot spot” in the modeling: “If the power is higher, the size of the hotspot will decrease, as the
effect of the high concentration sample will be limited to the nearest cells.”’!7 IEMS reasoned
that a higher power took into account the topography of the area.7!*

284. TEMS added that it used an internal cross-validation option of the software to ensure that
its results were sound,’!? and while it did identify a number of errors, it largely confirmed the
results of its first and second reports.’”° It collected a further 157 soil samples in 22 different
sites to determine whether the estimations produced by the ArcGIS model matched the actual
conditions on site.’! The result of this exercise confirmed “(i) the predictions of IEMS’
modeling, showing contamination not only within the area modeled by IEMS (pursuant to the
predicted level, i.e., above background values and regulatory limits) but also outside the bounds
used (confirming the conservative approach adopted by IEMS) and (ii) that sites GSI completely
ignored in its purported attempt to confirm and delineate the contamination demonstrated by
IEMS [were] in fact highly contaminated.””** IEMS reported that the cross-validation exercise
confirmed its estimation of contamination in the following 22 sites: Mono CPF, Mono 10-12,
Jaguar 2, Jaguar 3, Jaguar 7-8, Payamino | and CPF, Payamino 3, Payamino 4, Payamino 16,
Payamino 21, Payamino 23, Coca 1, Coca 4, Coca 8, Coca 9, Coca 12, Coca 18-19, Gacela 4,
Gacela 6-9, Céndor Norte, Lobo 1 and Lobo 2.”

285. Seventh, IEMS asserted that GSI’s treatment of the testing of groundwater and its results
was contrary to Ecuadorian regulations and accepted scientific practice.’”*+ It submitted that the
applicable regulation was TULAS (Book VI, Annex 1, Section 4.1.3), not RAOHE (Annex 5),
because the latter regulated water quality for superficial bodies and wastewater discharges, not
groundwater. > Annex 5 of RAOHE referred to filtration, but TULAS did not.’° In fact,
TULAS mandates analysis of the total concentration of heavy metals, and is not restricted to the
dissolved concentration: “The difference between the two criteria is that the total concentration
includes the dissolved, colloidal and suspended fractions of the contaminants within the sample,
while the dissolved concentration does not include the colloidal and suspended fractions.”””” For
this reason and on the basis of standards promulgated by the Ecuadorian Standardization Institute

(INEN 2169:98 and 276:98)’*, IEMS submitted that GSI’s method of filtering samples with
0.45 um filters (micrometers) was incorrect and invalidated its groundwater sampling
conclusion.’2° Moreover, it asserted that GSI did not measure the TPH in the groundwater, as
required by TULAS, but instead chose to test three other different parameters: Gasoline Range
Organics, Diesel Range Organics and Oil Range Organics and compared them individually to the
criteria in TULAS.”*° This compounded its error in filtering its samples.”*!

286. TEMS’ rebuttal to GSI’s criticism that TULAS cannot be applied to soil located in areas
with a content of clay greater than 25% was that it “recognize[d] that a number of monitoring
wells may be located in [such] areas”, but “[g]iven the conditions of the area, and if it is
demonstrated that the TULAS regulation does not apply, then the correct standard for
remediation in these areas is the background levels...which would in all likelihood be even
stricter than the TULAS permissible levels.”’*? For the purpose of its third report, IEMS
undertook two rounds of confirmation tests, taking filtered and unfiltered samples: installing six
monitoring wells and performing sampling from 17-19 December 2012, and a further re-
sampling of the same wells from 22-24 January 2014. Its conclusion was that there was a “very
small difference between the filtered and unfiltered samples”, and in the instances that the
concentration of contaminants did decrease between filtered and unfiltered samples from the
same monitoring well, IEMS submitted that “[t]his reduction could have been the result of
dilution due to heavy rains happening during the days when the sampling process was
performed.”7*

287. Eighth, on the matter of remediation, IEMS asserted that the experts were together on the
issue of whether hydrocarbon-impacted soils should be sent off-site for treatment: GSI proposed
that such soil be sent to an officially-approved soil remediation facility in the city of Coca for
treatment while IEMS proposed that it is sent to an unspecified offsite bio-treatment facility.”
Where they diverged was on the treatment of soils contaminated by heavy metals; GSI proposed
an on-site lined landfill, while IEMS proposed an off-site landfill.”

288. TEMS asserted that since the operations in the Blocks are located in a sensitive ecosystem
and “given that it is expected that the oilfield areas will return to their original condition at the
completion of petroleum operations, the presence of several landfills scattered throughout the
Blocks containing contaminated material is not compatible with the future use of the areas.”7*°
GSI’s approach to estimating the unit costs of remediation were also said to be unrealistic,
contrary to industry practice and ignored the “specificities of the jungle environment” in Blocks
7 and 21.”*” For example, IEMS contended that “GSI’s figure of US$80/m? is based on a very
limited scope of work that [did] not take into account the challenges of performing these

remediation works in the Amazon region and does not include the costs for excavation and cross-
country transportation.””** It also responded to GSI’s criticism of its basis for the cost of
remediating groundwater (i.e., using a US EPA survey of costs for groundwater remediation in
the United States) by asserting that what GSI ignored was that “local remediation providers in
Ecuador do not have the necessary expertise to perform these remediation works” and GST itself
did not put forward “any alternative quantification based on local costs.””? IEMS’ costs, in
contrast, were said to be “in line with common practice for these types of remediation projects in
Ecuador as is confirmed by a recent economic price quotation from a local company
(GPower).”74°

289. Accounting for corrected estimated contaminated soil volumes for Coca 8, Coca CPF,
Payamino CPF/Payamino 1, Dayuno and Pad A, IEMS reported that its updated total estimated
contaminated soil volumes was 1,867,835 m?* (background values case) and 691,444 mm
(regulatory reference criteria).”*! It asserted its remediation cost estimate remained reasonable
and that GSI’s proposed cost estimate was based on the use of site landfills which was
inappropriate for the Blocks and “failed to account for the enormous difficulty (and significant
cost) of working safely and protectively in the Amazon.” Its revised estimated cost of
remediation of contaminated soil was US$ 2,279,544,559 (background values) and US$
831,125,954 (regulatory reference criteria).”° It maintained the same estimate cost of
groundwater remediation as in its second report.”+

290. As noted above, IEMS’ third expert report was submitted together with an expert report
from RPS which reviewed and responded specifically to GSI’s first report.“° RPS submitted that
significant flaws in GSI’s site investigation method “fundamentally undermine[d] the resulting
conclusions reached by GSI on the environmental conditions in the CPUF, Block 7 and Block 21
and the risk they pose to human health.””4° RPS opined that there were significant flaws in GSI’s
testing and sampling methodology, in the choice and application of regulatory criteria, and in the
modeling that GSI adopted. 4”

291. The first such flaw was that GSI’s investigation was deliberately narrow in scope, in that
GSI conducted inspections at only 58 of the 74 sites investigated by IEMS, and collected
samples from a “mere 24 of the 74 sites studied by IEMS (85% of them being collected from

only 18 sites)” for soil contamination testing.“* In the case of alleged groundwater
contamination, GSI similarly collected samples at only 15 out of the 18 sites identified.”4” This
was because GSI restricted itself to investigating only reports of soil contamination that
surpassed regulatory or risk-based thresholds (i.e., it did not investigate reports of soil
contamination above base values but below regulatory or risk-based limits).”° Even so, there
were five sites where IEMS had reported the presence of contamination above the regulatory
criteria employed by GSI which the latter ignored without explanation; “GSI also ignored other
sites for which IEMS had collected soil samples showing environmental impacts within platform
areas, even though platforms are not exempted from remediation for environmental damage.””*!

292. Second, the selective use of “indicator parameters” invalidated GSI’s approach to the
investigation of the Blocks.’*” It resulted in their excluding sites in the face of clear evidence of
possible contamination. RPS cited the example of an area near Payamino | that GSI had
identified as exhibiting “oil residue associated with a former produced water surface
impoundment” but which it then excluded on the basis that samples from the site did not indicate
impacts based on electrical conductance.”** GSI’s approach also resulted in its excluding all
heavy metal contamination found in Blocks 7 and 21; in RPS’s view, this was an “absurd
consequence [that] render[ed] the Ecuadorian regulations that provide[d] for acceptable limits of
certain heavy metals wholly pointless.””* Finally, RPS submitted that this approach was
inconsistent with the Consortium’s own practice, referring to an Environmental Protection Guide
that Perenco had developed while it operated the Blocks which identified 16 chemical substances
that should be monitored and did not condition them on whether they were associated with
hydrocarbon, barium or any other indicator substance.’°>

293. Third, RPS responded to GSI’s criticism of IEMS’ calculation of background values,
contending that GSI had misrepresented IEMS’ approach and had ignored applicable Ecuadorian
regulations. Recalling that TEMS had arrived at Base Values by calculating the mean
concentration of ‘clean samples’ and GSI had countered that the appropriate methodology should
be the upper range of concentrations exhibited, Ecuador submitted that GSI’s approach was “not
consistent with Ecuadorian regulations” and “neither GSI nor [Perenco] [were] capable of
pointing to a single legal authority for calculating Base Values” in this manner.’°° In contrast,
TEMS’ approach was validated by TULAS which specified that Base Values should be
determined as the “mean” concentration.’”*’? TULAS further specified that the maximum
permissible limits were defined by multiplying the mean concentration obtained by three, but
that this was not the standard applicable to remediation which TULAS stipulated was back to 1.5
times the Base Value.”**

294. Ecuador asserted that, in any event, GSI misrepresented the results of IEMS’ calculation
of Base Values using the mean of clean samples when it alleged that this resulted in 80% of the
clean samples to be deemed contaminated.”? GSI assumed that IEMS had concluded a sample
was contaminated if a single element exceeded Base Values, but IEMS’ approach was in fact to
examine the eight criteria identified in RAOHE and TULAS (TPH, barium, cadmium, nickel,
lead, vanadium, electrical conductivity and pH) before making such determination.”

295. Fourth, GSI was alleged to have failed to properly test for groundwater contamination in
the Blocks, by employing the wrong sampling technique and discarding samples which exhibited
contamination by classifying them as “false positives.””°! RPS responded to GSI’s submission
that Annex 5 of RAOHE required IEMS to apply proper filtration methods in its groundwater
sampling.” RAOHE, however, “d[id] not apply to groundwater, but only to surface water and
wastewater”, and the regulation that governed groundwater sampling was instead TULAS, which
did not require the filtration of groundwater samples.’

296. RPS asserted that the use of field filters could lead to biased analytical results that report
lower concentrations of contaminants than are actually present in groundwater.”*+ IEMS had
taken both filtered and unfiltered samples on two separate occasions in December 2012 and
January 2013, the results of which demonstrated that “the levels of contaminants found in the
groundwater samples were not affected by solid particles.”” This was in contrast to GSI’s
investigation which IEMS asserted selectively addressed samples exhibiting contamination (such
as in Coca CPF and Mono CPF), proceeding to “discard these troublesome samples (at least from
the Consortium’s perspective) by classifying those as ‘false positive’ and performing further
sampling.”’© Moreover, RPS submitted that IEMS’ procedures, which applied TULAS, were
consistent with those employed by the Consortium’s predecessor, Oryx.’

297. Fifth, Ecuador challenged any attempt by Perenco and GSI in the case of 5 sites which it
had admitted contained contaminated volumes of soil in excess of 1,000 cubic meters (the
Payamino 2 & 8 platform, Mono CPF, Payamino 1, Gacela 1 & 8 and the CPF, and Coca 18 &
19) to avoid its liability by pointing at events that occurred before it acquired its interests in
Blocks 7 and 21 or after the State took over the Blocks in July 2009.7

298. For instance, in the case of the Payamino 2 and 8 platform, in particular the swamp
northeast of the platform in lands owned by Mr. Jungal, which Perenco admitted exhibited
contamination by crude or heavy metal, Perenco had alleged that the cause of contamination

could likely be traced back to a pre-1992 rupture of test pits built for the drilling of the Payamino
2 well by CEPE in 1987.7°

299. This, however, in Ecuador’s submission, stood at stark contrast with the evidence of
environmental audits of the site since 1992 which proved that the area had been remediated and
did not show any significant contamination (the audits in question were performed in March
1992 by Oryx’”, in May 1994 by Oryx,””! in March 1996 by Oryx,’” in January 1999 by
Oryx,’”? in September 2000 by Kerr-McGee,’”* and Perenco’s own audit in December 200277.

300. | Perenco had also ignored the evidence of a complaint in early 2007 to the Provincial
Council of Orellana of the “presence of large volumes of crude oil adjacent to Payamino 2 & 8”,
and the results of a subsequent inspection which confirmed that a “large area of approximately
20,000 m? was found containing crude oil residues in large quantities.”””° Ecuador found it
significant that “Payamino 2 & 8 was not even tested by the Consortium’s auditors during the
purportedly comprehensive 2008 Environmental Audit of Block 7.”7”7

301. Seventh, GSI’s risk assessment approach was said to be incomplete and “strewn with
errors, over-simplifications, shortcuts, and omissions that utterly undermine GSI’s resulting
conclusion that ‘[o]ilfield-related environmental conditions in the CPUF, Block 7, and Block 21
area pose no measurable risk to human health’.”’”* RPS opined that:

GSI’s risk assessment approach has ‘cherry picked’ elements from two
standardized procedures that have been adopted worldwide for human
health and ecological risk assessment, the ASTM (American Society for
Testing and Materials) International risk-based corrective action (RBCA)
process and the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s
(USEPA’s) baseline risk assessment (BLRA) process. [...] The BLRA is

G. Second expert report of GSI and Dr. Rouhani’s analysis of IEMS’ modelling

302. In its Rejoinder, Perenco filed a second expert report by GSI together with a report
prepared by an expert on geostatistics and spatial modeling, Dr. Shahrokh Rouhani, a professor
at the Georgia Institute of Technology and CEO of NewFields Companies, LLC. Dr. Rouhani
analysed IEMS’ use of ArcGIS modeling as compared to GSI’s delineation method and
concluded that IEMS’ modeling “suffer[ed] from a number of fundamental deficiencies” that
rendered its results statistically unreliable and liable to contradiction by actual soil sampling
results.’8° GSI’s delineation approach was, in contrast, conducted “in an effective manner” and
passed a reliability test using probability plot analyses.7*!

303. Dr. Rouhani concluded that setting aside the errors and assumptions that IEMS had
inputted into the ArcGIS software and the latter’s failure to use the tools available within the
software to confirm the validity and reliability of its model,’** the critical flaw in IEMS’ analysis
is that it chose an “inverse distance weighting” (IDW) interpolation approach from a number of
the approaches available in the ArcGIS software rather than a site-specific field delineation
approach.’*? The IDW interpolation approach, in his view, was not an appropriate method for
modeling soil contamination because “it cannot make predictions within any acceptable range of
reliability.”78+

304. Dr. Rouhani opined that the methodology that GSI employed, known as “hand-
contouring” and premised on delineation from actual data points, was the comparatively more
reliable method for measuring the extent of contamination in a given area.’*> To reiterate GSI’s
approach, this involved “sampling known or suspected areas of contamination and then
‘delineating’ these areas by taking additional samples until clean soil is reached” and working
with the topographical features to create the contours of the contaminated area.”*° This led

Perenco to submit that “GSI’s delineation results have not only been confirmed by GSI’s latest
field visit and sampling campaign, but were also verified by IEMS’ additional testing at 22 sites
in December 2012.”787

305. For its part, GSI defended its use of indicator parameters as “entirely rational” and based
on scientific practice.”** The parameters (i.e., TPH, barium and electrical conductivity) had been
selected by GSI on the basis of a sampling of crude, produced water and drilling muds from the
Blocks.’*? GSI “properly concluded that exceedances of ‘non-indicator’ analytes were not related
to releases from oil operations unless they were found in combination with the ‘indicator’ of
TPH or barium.””° In any event, Perenco submitted that the use of indicator parameters
concerned at most 39 off-platform soil samples — “1% of the approximately 3,500 soil samples
taken in the Blocks — because only those 39 samples [were] located outside of GSI’s remediation
areas and show[ed] an exceedance of non-indicator analytes without an accompanying presence
of TPH or barium.””"!

306. GSI also reiterated its criticism of the use of background values. Recalling that Ecuador,
IEMS and RPS contended that Article 4.1.3.3 of TULAS mandated this approach,’ it asserted
that this was contradictory since the premise of Ecuador’s background values case was the
claimed inability to rely on its existing regulatory parameters and it ignored the fact that Article
4.1.3.3 of TULAS was triggered only in the event of “the inapplicability of any parameter
established in the present regulation in a specific case or the absence in the regulation of a
parameter relevant to the soil under study”.’? For example, the TULAS parameters cannot be
used if the naturally-occurring levels are higher than the TULAS limits.’ This is consistent with
RAOHE Table 6 which provides that “[i]f the natural (non-contaminated) soils in the area
present concentrations higher than the established limits, the values of the respective parameter
may be increased to this level.”7°

307. In connection with the background values debate, Dr. Rouhani opined that using the
mean as the ‘background threshold value’ was unacceptable and produced scientifically
unreliable results.””° GSI and Dr. Rouhani maintained the position that the correct approach was
to employ the upper range of the background concentrations that presented.’””’ This was the
recommended scientific practice and is referred to in the United States EPA’s 2010 technical
guidelines on the subject.’*

308. As to the treatment of mud pits, GSI characterised IEMS’ rebuttal as based on a selective
reading of Article 59, the opening line of which indicated it addressed “pits that contain[ed]
weathered crude or that have been poorly managed.””* Pits left in such a state understandably
required more stringent remediation action compared to pits closed according to regular
industrial practice in the ordinary course of operations — dehydrated, compacted and covered
with clean soil and new vegetation — in accordance with Article 52(d)(2) of RAOHE.*” It
reiterated its view that mud pits are not inherently harmful to the environment; “their contents
are stable and non-toxic.”®°!

309. On the question of groundwater contamination, GSI submitted that IEMS’ testing method
was a misconstruction of Ecuadorian regulations and credible scientific practice.*°? First,
RAOHE Annex 5 made no distinction between different water types or sources; its section on
water was labelled only “Aguas” and referred to groundwater in its text (including groundwater
in the list of media to be identified for remediation in Article 16).8° As was the case with soil
parameters, Ecuador was required to apply the specific provisions of RAOHE in this instance
instead of the general provisions of TULAS.*” In any event, TULAS did not prohibit filtration;
for example, it states that “material in suspension, sediments, algae and other microorganisms
must be removed at the time the sample is taken or immediately afterward by filtration” with the
exception of the substances or concentrations subject to analysis.* The filtration employed by
GSI “remove[d] only sediment particles — and not concentrations in the water itself”.
Moreover, Perenco contended that “Ecuador’s complaints about filtration do not resolve that,
when IEMS conducted further groundwater testing in January 2013, it obtained lower results
than its prior field visits.”*°’ GSI maintained that it was IEMS’ groundwater claim, amounting to
US $265 million in damages, that was “unreliable and unsound.”8°

H. IEMS’ response to Dr. Rouhani’s analysis

310. The Respondent sought and was granted leave to file a response to Dr. Rouhani’s expert
evidence filed with the Rejoinder and did so in the form of a Supplemental Expert Report from
IEMS dated 4 September 2013.8 IEMS described Dr. Rouhani’s conclusions as “misleading”
and flawed, and failing to “address the overall approach that [IEMS] took in estimating the level
of contamination at Blocks 7 and 21.”8!° It characterised its model as “not designed to predict
exact concentrations as the final outcome, but rather whether concentrations were likely to be in

the range requiring remediation.”*"! In contrast, Dr. Rouhani’s critique was premised on taking
“each estimated data point” and assessing its statistical reliability in depicting the precise level of
contamination that actually existed at that point.*!?

311. TEMS further contended that Dr. Rouhani’s analysis proceeded on the assumption that the
ArcGIS variogram tools were “adequate to review data sets that were not designed for use with
variograms and were not compiled on an incremental basis using the variogram (and kriging)
techniques in mind.”*!? It added that IEMS had chosen the IDW interpolation technique
precisely because it “[did] not require or anticipate the use of variograms and kriging.”*!*
Moreover, the variogram and kriging methods used in Dr. Rouhani’s analysis were “modeled
using an algorithm for uniform characteristics” and in this way were unsuited to the anisotropic
character of the contamination that presented in the Blocks. In this connection, in contrast to Dr.
Rouhani’s criticism that the IDW method that IEMS employed failed to take into account the
topography and other site specific characteristics, Annexes A.1, A.3 and A.12 of IEMS’ April
2012 report showed that in designing its sampling program IEMS exhaustively studied and took
“full account of the physical and geographic features of each site.”*!> IEMS submitted that its
investigations confirmed that the contamination at each site was “generally of an anisotopic
nature (the contamination was ‘directional’ rather than uniform and equally distributed in all
directions)” and that the IDW method “performs better to represent contamination of differential
and directional characteristics.”*!°

312. In any event, IEMS submitted that when it repeated the ArcGIS modeling exercise using
the data it collected in December 2012 within the bounds of 15 sites it had inspected for the
purpose of its 2013 report,*!” the results demonstrated that its modeling was reliable although it
revealed they “had underestimated the volumes to be remediated under background values in
Blocks 7 and 21 by 8.29% (and overestimated volumes to be remediated under regulatory criteria
by 7%).”*!8 This translated to an increase of nearly US$ 320 million in Ecuador’s ‘background
values’ case.

L Contemporaneous Evidence Noted by the Experts and the Parties

313. The Tribunal notes that in addition to the expert reports filed by both Parties, there is
contemporaneous evidence pertaining to the Blocks’ conditions during the Consortium’s
operatorship and at and around the time of the takeover in July 2009 which was submitted by
each party.

314. Perenco submitted that studies and audits of Blocks 7 and 21 conducted “before and after
July 2009 show that the Blocks were in exemplary condition.”*!? It relied, amongst other things,

conformed “with environmental legislation”*”!, the biannual audits conducted in 2008, which in
its submission, revealed that, in Block 7, “soil samples taken in 13 locations revealed exceedance
of regulatory standards in the Payamino Sanitary Landfill...[but all] other samples were

the six ex post environmental impact studies commissioned by Petroamazonas and reported in
July 2010, which identified only a selected number of major non-conformities and did not
identify any groundwater contamination.*+

315. Ecuador attacked the credibility of the audits commissioned by Perenco, relying on
IEMS’ evidence*”> and on the technical report issued by the Ministry in August 2009 (noted
above). To reiterate, the technical report recorded the Ministry’s recommendation that Perenco
should be sanctioned and made to cure defects in its 2008 audits because the Ministry’s team had
identified major non-compliances with Ecuadorian environmental regulations.*?° Ecuador
contended that the State had not, and it in fact could not have, approved the results of the 2008
audits.*?” Ecuador also pointed out that such audits were supposed to be conducted every two
years and Perenco had failed to comply with its obligation to conduct the audits in 2004 (with a
resulting gap in audits from 2002 to 2006).*”8

316. Perenco’s response was that the non-conformities identified by the Ministry resulted
either from Ecuador’s mismanagement of the Blocks after the Consortium left the Blocks, or else
were very minor.*”? It contended further that regardless of whether Ecuador ultimately approved

was “unclear how IEMS could possibly make such a determination, or how Ecuador could
comfortably rely on it, given that the 2008 audits were based on terms of reference that the

Iv. FINDINGS
A. The Tribunal’s Approach to the Counterclaim as it Currently Stands

317. Having reviewed the Parties’ written submissions, expert reports and the oral testimony
and submissions of counsel at the hearing, and after extensive deliberation, the Tribunal has
arrived at a number of conclusions as to the manner in which the counterclaim was put and the
state of evidence after the written and oral phase of the current proceeding was completed. These
conclusions will be set out over the course of this Findings section of the Decision.

318. In particular, the Tribunal will make certain findings of fact and law which shall be
applied to ascertain the extent of damage for which Perenco will be held liable. Such findings
can be grouped under two sets of questions: (i) what can be called the major questions of law and
fact, the resolution of which will narrow the claim’s analysis; and (ii) certain subsidiary issues
concerning the interpretation of RAOHE, TULAS and the Environmental Management Law.
During the course of its analysis, the Tribunal will also decide on the reliability of the mapping
exercise employed by IEMS.

B. The Tribunal’s Findings on the Legal Framework Governing the Dispute
() The Constitution and the Applicable Regulatory Regime

319. The first and foremost legal question presented to the Tribunal concerns the impact of the
2008 Ecuadorian Constitution on the legal framework governing the Tribunal’s consideration of
the counterclaim. The Constitution’s objective of full restoration and the protection of nature
itself as a subject of environmental rights, its rule on the imprescriptibility of environmental
torts, its potential impact on the burden of proof and causation issues (i.e., through its creation of
a strict liability regime) and the Constitution’s temporal application has given rise to a number of
issues that have divided the Parties.

320. In the Tribunal’s view, the two most important issues in this regard are: (i) the
relationship between the Constitution’s emphasis on full restoration, on the one hand, and the
environmental impact that oilfield operations are permitted to have under RAOHE and TULAS,
on the other; and (ii) whether the Constitution’s establishment of a strict liability regime can be
applied to all of Perenco’s activities, given that most of them (i.e., until 20 October 2008) took
place when the 1998 Constitution was in effect.

(2) The Relationship Between the Constitution and the Hydrocarbons
Environmental Regulations

321. After carefully considering the arguments and the evidence, the Tribunal does not accept
Ecuador’s arguments that its hydrocarbons regulatory regime does not sufficiently protect the
environment and therefore should give way to the “background values” or “base values”
methodology employed by IEMS as its primary means of evaluating the Blocks.*** The Tribunal

a4 In its Counter-Memorial, Ecuador referred to IEMS’ analysis of the regime and asserted: “IEMS explains

that the Ecuadorian regulatory criteria, when compared to the Base Values for Blocks 7 and 21, do not provide for
full remediation of the contamination and, therefore, do not fully protect the environment or the health of the
population. Thus, according to IEMS, a proper environmental audit must not stop at the regulatory thresholds, but
must evaluate the level of contaminants in comparison with the [b]ase [vJalues. This is what IEMS did in its Expert
Report.” [Footnote omitted.] (Ecuador’s Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 797-799); see also, IEMS ER I, p 19.

103

found Ecuador’s (and IEMS’) arguments on this point to be counter-intuitive and after due
consideration finds that it must apply the detailed statutory and regulatory provisions of
Ecuadorian law rather than use a “background values” approach.*** The Ecuadorian system
might perhaps not be as rigorous as Perenco has sought to portray it, but it is, to the Tribunal, a
considered regulatory regime that has been developed by Ecuador over the years and it has been
administered in a generally consistent manner by regulators and operators alike.

322. The Tribunal can well appreciate the novelty of certain legal questions presented in this
counterclaim when the generally worded prescriptions of Ecuador’s highest law are considered.
It can also appreciate the basic logic of the “background values” thesis employed by IEMS,
given the Constitution’s focus on full restoration. There is no doubt that the Constitution attaches
great importance to the protection of the environment and to the restoration of environmentally
disturbed ecosystems. As shall be seen, the Tribunal considers that the Constitution’s focus on
environmental protection means that when choosing between certain disputed (but reasonable)
interpretations of the Ecuadorian regulatory regime, the interpretation which most favours the
protection of the environment is to be preferred.

323. Having carefully considered the Parties’ submissions and the expert reports, however, the
Tribunal considers that although the 2008 Constitution contains important provisions dealing
with the protection of the environment and has effect as a set of foundational legal rules, it does
not purport to prescribe the environmental regulatory regime governing hydrocarbon operations.
Rather, the specific rules governing the environmental aspects of hydrocarbon exploitation are to
be found within RAOHE, TULAS, and the Environmental Management Law, all of which
preceded the 2008 Constitution’s making but which have continued to remain in force since its
entry into force.*°

324. Had the 2008 Constitution effected a significant alteration of the normative regime in
which the State’s environmental regulations were to be made and applied, the Tribunal believes
that Congress and the Executive would have enacted new laws and/or promulgated new
regulations in order to implement the new environmental edicts. Yet this has not been done. No
evidence was given to the Tribunal to show that after the 2008 Constitution’s entry into force the
Congress or the Executive decided to replace RAOHE, TULAS and the Environmental
Management Law with more stringent rules. To the contrary, all have continued in force since
2008 and have been applied in a more or less consistent fashion by the responsible authorities
vis-a-vis Blocks 7 and 21 and, as far as the evidence shows, to other oilfields as well.

325. The Tribunal starts with the relationship between the Environmental Management Law
with RAOHE and TULAS, and the thrust of TULAS itself, which supports the view that, even
though those instruments preceded the Constitution’s making, they continue to provide

835 ITEMS’ witness, Mr. Alfaro, observed that their “own initial instinct was to apply the regulatory limits.”

Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 4, pp 1081-1082 (Testimony of IEMS).

As Perenco noted in its Post-Hearing Submission, at paragraph 10, guidelines issued Joint! ly by the Ministry
of the Environment and the Ministry of N after the Cons! "s (as to
which Professor René Bedén was not cross-examined) stated that: “in the event that ... any event (accident) occurs
or is detected where, regarding key components of the social and natural environment, the reported parameters are
outside of the permissible limits established by the environmental norms in force, the contingency plan shall be put
into place, and the damage to the envi Land social c shall then be c ised and

regulatory limits for remediation of soil and groundwater contamination that are consistent with
the Constitution’s environmental precepts.

326. In defending the use of “background values”, the Respondent and its legal expert,
Professor Andrade, referred to the definition of the term “environmental harm” in the
Environmental Management Law. The Tribunal recalls that the Law refers to “[a]ny significant
loss, diminution, detriment or impairment of the preexisting conditions in the environment or one
of its components. It affects the functioning of the ecosystem or the renewability of its
resources.”*37 Ecuador contended that the definition provided the notion of “repairable
environmental harm” which was consistent with the constitutional imperative to remedy any and
all environmental harm (i.e., “full restoration”).*** It submitted further that RAOHE and TULAS
are confined to setting the thresholds within which hydrocarbon activities could be undertaken in
a lawful fashion and in that connection, when administrative sanctions could be imposed on
operators for illicit hydrocarbon activities, but they did not purport to define the notion of
repairable harm.**°

327. This, in the Tribunal’s view, did not fully reflect the situation. The Environmental
Management Law preceded RAOHE by two years, and TULAS by four years.**° It refers to
sustainable development in its first chapter and its objective of establishing the “principles and
guidelines” of environmental policy and management in Ecuador in Article 1.5! In its glossary
of definitions, in addition to defining “Environmental Harm” as noted above, the Law provides
definitions for the terms “Contamination” and “Environmental Impact’. “Contamination” refers
to “concentrations ... superior or inferior to those established in the legislation in force.”
“Environment Harm” refers not just to ‘any loss, diminution, detriment or impairment” but
“[a]ny significant loss, diminution, detriment or impairment...”.*** The Law thus contemplates
degrees of disturbance ascertainable by reference to law, not the equation of “environmental
impact” with “environmental harm’. Ecuador has not demonstrated how RAOHE and TULAS
interacted with these provisions of the Environmental Management Law in any way other than in
their logical role as more detailed regulations governing all or virtually all environmental issues
that can arise out of hydrocarbons exploitation in furtherance of the Environmental Management
Law’s general framework.

840 The Environmental Management Law (Ley de Gestion Ambiental) was first enacted on 30 July 1999; see

Environmental Laws and 1“ Expert Report of René Bed6n, paragraph 15. The document on record in this arbitration
is Exhibit CA-CC-33/Annex 12 to 1 Expert Report of Ricardo Crespo Plaza. It is dated as having been published in
Official Gazette No. 418 on 10 September 2004 and is titled Codification of the Environmental Management Act
(term used by Professor Ricardo Crespo Plaza in footnote 23 of his 1“ Expert Report). RAOHE was published in the
Official Register on 13 February 2001 (EL-147), TULAS was published in the Official Register on 21 March 2003
(EL-146).

328. RAOHE and TULAS articulate in detail the “parameters, maximum reference values and
permissible limits” that operators are required to observe when complying with their
environmental obligations.“ RAQHE, in particular, as the instrument of more specific
application to hydrocarbon activities, provides expressly in its Article 86 that, as regards their
operations, operators are required to comply with the permissible limits set forth in its Annexes,
such as in Table 6, entitled, “identification and remediation of contaminated soils in all phases of
the hydrocarbons industry.”

329. TULAS likewise recognises the distinction between environmental impact and
environmental harm, and in this way it accepts that Ecuadorian environmental law gives meaning
and effect to the principle of sustainable development by accepting that the development of the
Nation’s physical resources will inevitably have an environmental impact and therefore a balance
must be struck between what is an acceptable anthropogenic disturbance of the natural
environment and what is unacceptable environmental damage triggering the obligation to
remediate.

330. The distinction is discernable in Tables 2 and 3 in Annex 2 of TULAS. Table 2 (“Soil
Quality Standards”), establishes non site-specific standards for the background values of 36
different elements that may be present in soil. Its values are lower than those set out in Table 3,
entitled (significantly, in the Tribunal’s view), “Criteria for Remediation and Restoration of
Soils”, which provides site-specific standards (four different types of land use) that establish the
“maximum levels of concentration of contaminants in soil under remediation or restoration.”*4°
This is further bolstered by the definition proffered by TULAS of the term “Baseline
(background)” which: “Denotes the prevailing environmental conditions, prior to any
disturbance. That is to say, it signifies the conditions that would have predominated in the
absence of anthropogenic activities...”.**7 The Respondent relies on TULAS to support its
“background values” approach and to provide, in the form of Table 2, its alternative regulatory
criteria for the remediation of soil.**® The framework within TULAS, however, suggests that this
is not exactly what it provides. The Tribunal will revert to this below.

331. Moreover, RAOHE and TULAS are consistent with the supreme law’s embrace of the
principle of sustainable development.* On this the experts agreed; in tracing the development
of environmental laws in Ecuador from the 1970s and the influence of the Rio Declaration in

Claimant’s proferred translation of Article 2.38 of Annex 2, Volume VI (Criteria for Contaminated Soil
Remediation), the relevant parts are: “prevailing environmental conditions prior to any disturbance...i.e, conditions
that would have prevailed in the absence of anthropogenic activities, and as a consequence of natural processes
only.” (Claimant’s Counter-Memorial, paragraph 253, footnote 306). See above at paragraphs 103-105.

1992, they indicated that ‘sustainable development’ informed the precepts of the Environmental
Management Law, RAOHE, TULAS and other Ecuadorian regulatory instruments.**° The
Tribunal considers that this is relevant to the distinction drawn by the Environmental
Management Law between the definitions of “environmental harm” and “environmental impact.”
The Tribunal will return to this when examining RAOHE’s and TULAS’s role in the regulation
of hydrocarbon operations.

332. The Tribunal also notes that Ecuador and its state-owned entity, Petroamazonas, have
over the years consistently treated RAOHE and TULAS as providing the regulatory limits
applicable to the evaluation of the environmental condition of lands on which hydrocarbon
operations have been permitted to take place. It was also RAOHE, and not background values,
that was identified in the terms of reference proposed by Kerr-McGee to be used as the basis for
its audits of Blocks 7 and 21 during its operatorship and, as required by Ecuadorian law, this was
subject to the review and approval of Ecuadorian authorities.**! This carried over to the 2002
biennial audits provided to DINAPA around the time that the operatorship was transferred from
Kerr-McGee to Perenco (in December 2002).%? RAOHE and TULAS were also applied
consistently by the authorities (in some instances on their own initiative rather than at the
operator’s prompting) in environmental audits and remediation proposals resulting from
hydrocarbon operations.

333. There are numerous examples on the record, but the Tribunal has chosen a few to
illustrate the point. For example, in September 2007, the National Environmental Protection
Directorate (DINAPA) dismissed a complaint filed by the Orellana Human Rights Permanent
Committee related to the operation of the Punino 1 well.**? Its explanation to the Committee was
that Perenco had provided DINAPA with physico-chemical analyses of samples it had taken
during an inspection of the area, and the “values obtained compl[ied] with the permissible limits
established in Tables 4a, 4b and 6 of [RAOHE], which show[ed] that there is no contamination
as a result of the hydrocarbons activities that are carried out on the mentioned platform.”***

334. This approach continued while the Constitution was being finalised during the course of
2008. In January 2008, for example, the Consortium presented to the National Director for
Environmental Protection and the Minister of Mines and Petroleum laboratory results of samples
taken from an area where a remediation programme had been carried out for a crude-oil spill that
occurred on 26 May 2007 from the flow line of the Oso 2 well.*°> The sampling results were

examination, Professor Crespo conceded that even after the 2008 Constitution, “the way that
remediation is carried out under RAOHE is by applying the permissible limits” and this was consistent with
Nature’s right to full restoration under the Constitution: see Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 4, pp 922-
924 (Testimony of Ricardo Crespo Plaza).

evaluated pursuant to Table 6 of Annex 2 of RAOHE and this was accepted, without objection,
by the Ministry.*°°

335. In another instance, following a complaint in February 2008 from landowners in the
Parish of Nuevo Paraiso regarding contamination said to have resulted from the operation of the
Coca 7, 11, 12, 13 and 15 wells, Ecuador’s Undersecretary for Environmental Protection ordered
a technical environmental inspection to be carried out in coordination with the Regional Delegate
of Environmental Protection of the Amazon.**’ This included the physico-chemical analysis of
water and soil samples. On 25 June 2008, the Undersecretary informed the complainants that the
results obtained “compl[ied] with the allowable limits established in Tables 4a, 4b and 6 of
Annex 2 of [RAOHE]’, demonstrating “that there is no evidence of contamination from
hydrocarbons due to activities carried out by [Perenco] on the Platform of wells Coca 7, 11, 12,
13 and 15,88

336. On 28 August 2008, the Undersecretary for Environmental Protection wrote to Perenco’s
General Manager regarding an environmental remediation programme that the company was
carrying out in the Province of Orellana stemming from a cut in the Gacela Payamino gas
pipeline on 6 October 2007.*° A representative of the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum was sent
to investigate whether the remediation programme was carried out effectively, and this was
performed under the supervision of Ecuador’s Regional Department of Environmental Protection
for the Amazon-Orellana province on 5 May 2008. The inspection concluded that the physico-
chemical analysis of water and soil samples submitted by Perenco in June 2008 “compl[ied] with
the allowable limits established in Tables 4a, 4b and 6 of the Annex to [RAOHE].”*® It ordered
the original complaint to be archived since it considered that the remediation was properly
done.**!

337. In essence, the Undersecretary’s determinations mirrored Perenco’s submissions in the
present case that oilfield activities that result in the emission of certain controlled substances that
disturb background values but do not exceed the permitted levels stipulated by RAOHE or
TULAS, as the case may be, do not create an environmental harm of such significance as to
require remediation. That is, an activity that has an effect on the environment below the levels

Other examples before the 2008 Constitution entered into force: Petroproduccién’s remediation of
Cuyabeno 8 in 2007 (Exhibit CE-CC-139, Letter of September 10, 2007 from Petroproduccién to DINAPA,
attaching the Report on the Treatment of Materials Contaminated with Hydrocarbons as a Result of the Cuyabeno 8

prescribed by law does not, as a matter of Ecuadorian law, constitute an environmental harm for
which the operator is legally responsible.

338. This legal situation continued, evidently without change, after the 2008 Constitution
entered into force on 20 October 2008. There are numerous instances of the authorities deeming
the presence of permitted substances associated with hydrocarbons activities within the limits
prescribed by RAOHE and TULAS, as the case may be, to be legally permissible.

339. From June to August 2009, Ecuambiente Consulting Group was commissioned by the
OCP to carry out remediation of soil contaminated by a spill from the OCP pipeline in the Santa
Rosa district.** In a section of its report entitled, “Legal Framework”, it stated “[t]he project to
remediate the contaminated soils created in the OCP spill must comply with the provisions of the
Substitute Regulations of the Regulations for Hydrocarbon Operations in Ecuador (RAOHE)
published in Official Registry No. 265 dated February 13, 2001, through Ministerial Agreement
1215, Table 6, which determines the parameters and permissible limits that must be controlled in
the remediation of soils contaminated in all phases of the Hydrocarbons industry.”*®® It added
that “[i]n addition, the provisions of the United Text of Secondary Environmental Legislation,
Book VI, Annex 2, must be taken into account, specifically Table 3, which stipulates the
Remediation or Restoration criteria set according to the use of the soil.” Nevertheless, “[g]iven
that the limits for Agricultural soil use in both Table 3 from TULAS and Table 6 from the
RAOHE are similar for all the parameters being studied, those of Table 6 of the RAOHE 1213
will be taken as the officially stipulated ones.”**

340. There is also the example of an ex post EIS for Coca-Payamino commissioned by
Petroamazonas and conducted by ENTRIX in July 2010 in which it consistently compared the
results of its samples to RAOHE and TULAS.*® Similarly, there is evidence that the Ministry
routinely employed not just one land-use classification (i.e., sensitive ecosystems) from Table 6
of RAOHE, but all three of its land-use classifications.°

341. This continued, and notably, in March 2011, a manual was developed with the
involvement of PRAS (“Programa de Remediacion Ambiental y Social”), an agency within the
Ecuadorian Ministry of Environment (and one with which one of the Ecuador’s experts,
Professor Crespo, was affiliated).*°7 The manual described the procedures used “during the
environmental remediation works carried out on the pits and flow lines of the Atacapi 2 oil well,
in the Liberatador field” between July 2009 and August 2010.

342. During cross-examination, all the while noting that the “document is not a regulation or
standard, [it was] drafted in order to provide future manual users with guidelines in terms of
environmental remediation techniques”,*® Professor Crespo was taken to relevant pages of the
Manual which recorded that the criteria employed were “based on [RAOHE] ..., in its table
6...which deals with the permissible limits for the identification and remediation of contaminated
soils."°® Tt followed on stating that in the case in question the parameters relating to
“agricultural land” use would be applied.*”° Professor Crespo acknowledged that in proposing to
carry out its remediation program using the criteria in RAOHE, the agency was acting
consistently with the 2008 Constitution.*”!

343. Perenco further pointed to statements of Minister Germanico Pinto and IEMS which, in
its view, established that the permissible limits in RAOHE and TULAS continued to be the
applicable standards after the 2008 Constitution’s promulgation. Minister Pinto, who became the
Minister of Non-renewable Resources in June 2009, described his Ministry as the “principal
regulator of the hydrocarbons industry.”*’? He was also Petroecuador’s Chairman of the Board
and a member of Petroamazonas’ Board at the time. On cross-examination, Minister Pinto
agreed that Petroecuador and Petroamazonas were bound to apply RAOHE and the other
applicable regulations in force in the performance of their functions.*”*

344. The Tribunal also notes that IEMS’ first expert report in Burlington characterised
RAOHE and TULAS as representing the limits below which the Ecuadorian State had
determined that “on properties that are used for productive purposes related with petroleum
activities, we tolerate certain concentrations of contaminants.”*’* TEMS did not use “background
values” or “[b]ase [v]alues”, but rather referred to the notion of “tolerable” levels of
contaminants. It applied RAOHE and TULAS “to establish whether the presence of
contaminants at certain levels and components of the environment (soil, surface water and
underground water) [was] tolerable.”*”>

345. It was not until the filing of its second report in the Burlington proceeding that IEMS
introduced the notion of “background values” or “[b]ase [vJalues” into its investigation of the
Blocks, and there is an indication that this hypothesis was prompted by the instruction of the
Office of the Attorney-General of Ecuador to “[s]trengthe[n] the prior soil and groundwater

results via the determination and evaluation of background levels for those contaminants whose
presence may be attributable to natural conditions or other causes.”°”°

346. The Tribunal does not see this instruction as nefarious; one can reasonably ask whether
Articles 396 and 397 of the 2008 Constitution required a shift in the content and enforcement of
Ecuadorian environmental law such as to incorporate background values as the regulatory
regime’s dominant criteria. But the evidence does not show that the 2008 Constitution prompted
the Executive or the Congress to make significant changes to Ecuador’s then-extant
hydrocarbons environmental regulatory regime.

347. Nothing precludes Ecuador from promulgating new regulations that hold oilfield
operators to more stringent environmental standards (or indeed to prohibit such activities
altogether in areas which it considers to be ecologically sensitive), provided that this is done
consistently with the Constitution’s requirements and any international legal obligations
voluntarily assumed by the State. Had the Tribunal been presented with evidence that all oilfield
operators were being held to background values remediation standards after October 2008, it
would have been bound to recognise that as a matter of Ecuadorian law a fundamental change in
environmental law enforcement had been effected and that Perenco, like all other operators, was
obliged to meet the higher standard that the State had seen fit to elaborate. Indeed, the Tribunal
will do precisely that for the period in time in which the 2008 Constitution governed Perenco’s
operatorship.

348. But Perenco has shown that the Constitution did not change the substantive
environmental standards to be applied to oilfield operations and seeking to hold an operator to
“background values” standards said to be applicable as a matter of law in an international
arbitration when the evidence points to less stringent standards that have been applied on a
regular basis by the State — including to State-owned operators — outside of the arbitration,
cannot be right as a matter of Ecuadorian law or international law. The Tribunal is concerned
with Ecuadorian law and regulation as written and as applied.

349. It follows from the foregoing that Ecuador’s primary case based on background values
cannot be accepted in substitution for the applicable standards — both prior to and after the 2008
Constitution’s entry into force. Accordingly, it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to determine the
many disputed issues pertaining to the background values methodology employed by IEMS and
adopted by Ecuador.

350. This is not to say that as Ecuador’s foundational governing law, the 2008 Constitution
has no role to play in answering the questions presented to the Tribunal. It constitutes the State’s
supreme legal framework within which the Environmental Management Law, RAOHE, TULAS
and other regulations specific to hydrocarbon activities within Ecuador must operate.*””

876 As shall be seen, when it responded to the witness statement of Mr. Gilberto Martinez filed with Perenco’s
Rejoinder, IEMS itself adverted to an instruction from the client to consider background values (see IEMS ER IV, p
8). Perenco also raised the example of IEMS’ report in the ICSID case of City Oriente v Ecuador (Exhibit CE-CC-
169), where IEMS referred to remediating affected areas up to the permissible limits set forth in RAOHE
(Rejoinder, paragraph 73). See above at paragraph 208.

Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, p 209 (Opening Statement of Mark Friedman) (“the basic
structure of environmental protection’).

111

Accordingly, where the Constitution has effected a change in the law, it must be given effect,
although the Tribunal must ensure that the Constitution as a whole must be applied.*”®

351. Finally, the Tribunal notes that IEMS prepared an alternative valuation approach based
upon the criteria in RAOHE, Table 6, Annex 2, specifically, that applicable to sensitive
ecosystems. For chemical indicators other than TPH, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,
cadmium, nickel and lead, such as “electrical conductivity, pH, barium and vanadium” it relied
on Table 2 of TULAS.*” The situation with respect to the results of its groundwater sampling
was different, IEMS explaining that while it similarly took the view that Base Values should be
applied this was not feasible in the circumstances and relied on the values in Table 5, Annex 1,
Book VI of TULAS.**°

(3) Conclusion on the Relationship Between the Constitution and the
Hydrocarbons Environmental Regulations

352. In sum, the Tribunal does not accept that the 2008 Constitution per se establishes the
applicable technical standards governing the environmental conditions in the Blocks. The
Constitution’s provisions might have relevance to providing answers to specific issues that arise
in this counterclaim. However, insofar as the environmental aspects of hydrocarbons operations
are concerned, the Tribunal must look at the Ecuadorian technical standards as promulgated by
the relevant bodies of the Ecuadorian State and as applied “on the ground” both before and after
the 2008 Constitution’s promulgation. Subject to the Tribunal’s further findings on the
applicable regulatory criteria, this is the case that Perenco must meet.

(4) Does the Constitution’s Strict Liability Regime Apply to Perenco’s
Activities Conducted Prior to 20 October 2008?

353. With respect to the temporal application of the 2008 Constitution, given that Article 13.1
holds that the constitutional rights and guarantees are of “immediate application”, the Tribunal is
bound to hold that for any contamination in excess of regulatory standards shown to have
occurred after 20 October 2008 up until the Consortium suspended operations on 16 July 2009,
in accordance with the Constitution, Perenco is strictly liable.

354. Ecuador has gone further to argue that the promulgation of the 2008 Constitution means
that since the counterclaim was filed after the new Constitution’s entry into force, and since the
Constitution created strict liability for environmental claims, all of Perenco’s activities and any
contamination occurring prior to 20 October 2008 are to be evaluated within that new legal
framework with the result that Ecuador is relieved of the need to prove any fault, even though a
fault-based regime governed Perenco’s oilfield activities (and those of its predecessors) prior to

878 Article 11(6) of the 2008 Constitution provides that all constitutional rights are "interdependent and hold
equal stature." Article 427 provides that: "Constitutional provisions shall be interpreted by the literal meaning of
their wording that is most closely in line with the Constitution as a whole. In the event of any doubt, [constitutional
provisions] shall be interpreted in the manner most favourable to the full force and effect of rights and that best
respects the will of the constituent, in accordance with the general principles of constitutional interpretation."

20 October 2008.°*! According to Ecuador, as of 20 October 2008, fault became irrelevant to
establishing Perenco’s liability.

355. The Tribunal observes that even on Ecuador’s appraisal of the strict liability regime, it is
not so strict as to admit of no exceptions. In Ecuador’s view, there was a “presumption of
causation” and “Perenco can only escape liability by establishing that the contamination was
caused by force majeure, Ecuador or a third party.”**?At another point in its post-hearing
submissions, Ecuador repeated this point in similar terms: “As a result of the presumption of
causation established by the 2008 Constitution, the entity responsible for operations in an
adversely impacted area bears the burden of demonstrating that such an impact was not caused
by its own operations.”

356. With respect to Ecuador’s contention that the entirety of Perenco’s operatorship is to be
adjudged under the 2008 Constitution’s strict liability regime, the Tribunal does not read the
“immediate application” text of the Constitution to have retroactive effect. The general rule
under Ecuadorian law is that laws may not in principle be given retroactive effect and that rule
has been continued in the 2008 Constitution.** The Tribunal is aware of the “public order”
exception to the Constitution’s prohibition against the retroactive application of law, but it has
not been satisfactorily shown that this has occurred in Ecuadorian legal practice.**> The Tribunal
therefore does not agree with Ecuador’s arguments in favour of giving the Constitution’s regime
of strict liability an application which to the Tribunal appears to be retroactive.**° Based on its
understanding of the Ecuadorian case law that the Parties put before the Tribunal in their
pleadings and reviewed with the legal experts at the hearing, a distinction must be drawn
between the pre-and post-2008 constitutional regimes.

357. The Tribunal considers that where a particular regime that can give rise to damages
claims has governed the conduct of a complex activity such as hydrocarbons exploitation,
although the standards can be made more stringent with respect to activities engaged in after
their entry into force, in respect of attempts to impose tortious liability after the fact, an operator
can in general be held only to the legal standards that applied to its conduct at the time.

8s Implicit in the Tribunal's description of the issue above is a finding that the 1998 Constitution did not itself

create a strict liability regime and the Tribunal's rejection of Ecuador’s argument based on Article 20 of the 1998

Constitution. On the Tribunal's reading, the phrase "... shall be obligated to compensate individuals for the damages

caused as a consequence of the defective provision of public services or of the acts of their public servants and

employees, in the performance of their duties” does not amount to a strict liability regime. However, the Tribunal is

of the view that decisions of the Ecuadorian courts have strengthened the presumptions in favour of a finding of

Kability i in the case of damage caused through hazardous activities.

Accordingly, for the period commencing 4 September 2002,°*? when Perenco acquired its

interests in the Blocks from Kerr-McGee, through to 19 October 2008,*** the Tribunal must
apply the fault-based regime. This does not mean that certain issues cannot be affected by
subsequent constitutional action, but it does mean that the basic legal standards against which
Perenco was to conduct itself cannot later be changed and applied retroactively to impose
liability where none existed under the then-applicable standard.

358. All of this said, the Tribunal adds that having regard to the way in which Ecuadorian case
law has developed, it does not see major differences between the two regimes given that: (i) it
appears that ultimately all of the experts agreed that even under the strict liability regime there
are still questions of causation;**° and (ii) Ecuadorian law prior to 2008 presumed that the party
engaged in a harmful activity was responsible for any environmental damage and the burden
shifted to that party to demonstrate that some other party was responsible. As the Tribunal
understands the law, prior to 2008 Ecuadorian law created a strong presumption that the operator
was responsible for the damage and this presumption could only be rebutted by demonstrating
that some other party was responsible.

(5) Conclusion on the Strict Liability Regime’s Application

359. In sum, the 2008 Constitution applies to any post-20 October 2008 damage resulting from
regulatory exceedances. For any damage occurring during this period up to its being succeeded
by Ecuador in operating the Blocks, Perenco is strictly liable. Perenco has asserted that no such
damage occurred during this period, so if that is correct, the strict liability regime does not have
any application to this dispute in practical terms; whether Perenco is correct that no damage
occurred after the Constitution’s entry in force remains to be seen.®” In cases of doubt, where it
appears that the damage might have occurred prior to that time, the fault-based liability regime
which applied to Perenco from the date of its acquiring its interests in the Blocks until 20
October 2008 must apply.

(6) The Time Bar Defence

360. Turning to Perenco’s contention that the claim is partly time-barred by virtue of the
application of Article 2235 of the Civil Code, Ecuador has responded that that rule can only
apply to a fault-based regime and since 2008 the regime has been one of strict liability based on
the imprescriptibility of environmental claims.*®! As for claims relating to events occurring

890 During his cross-examination, Mr. Wilfrido Saltos testified that on 11 July 2009 (ie., after the 2008
Constitution entered into force), there was an 11 barrel spill in Block 7 which was “reported by an association of
farmers that are within the operational area of the Payamino Field. This group is called Los Vencedores.” He
indicated that the spill had been cleaned up. Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 5, pp 1438-1439 (Testimony
of Wilfrido Saltos). Perenco observed in its Post-Hearing Reply Brief that in a lawsuit (the Los Vencedores case) the
Court of Appeals of the Orellana District upheld the lower court's dismissal of the claim on the basis that the
Ministry of Environment had certified that Perenco had complied with the environmental remediation plan.
(Perenco's Reply Post Hearing Brief, paragraph 13.)
Ecuador’s Post-Hearing Submission, paragraph 24;

before that date, Ecuador argued that even if it was wrong that the 2008 Constitution could have
retroactive effect, when it came to a limitation period issue, in the Nelson Alcivar case the court
applied Article 396.4 (pursuant to which environmental claims cannot expire).

361. There is no time bar for the claim insofar as it relates to events occurring after the 2008
Constitution’s entry into force. As for claims arising out of the prior fault-based regime and
outside of the Civil Code’s four year period, the imprescriptibility provision of the 2008
Constitution does have an impact on Perenco’s limitations period defence. Statutes of limitation
are of a procedural nature and since the claim as a whole was brought after October 2008, the
Civil Code’s rule gives way to Article 396.

362. At the hearing, Professor Andrade testified against the strict application of a four-year
limitation period where the harm may not be discoverable within that period after the act has
occurred. In his opinion, “not even in the system of general liability has this norm been applied
in that way.”*°? Ecuador found support for this view in the “generally accepted maxim agere non
valentem non currit praescriptio (that is, the period of statute of limitation does not run for he
who cannot assert a claim).”*** Ecuador argued that otherwise a claim for an environmental harm
would expire every time the harm was neither disclosed by the perpetrator nor readily apparent
(as in the present case).°?>

363. The Tribunal observes that Perenco’s expert, Dr Bed6n, appeared to hold the same view
in one of his prior writings where he asserted that “continued environmental harm should be
subject to the normal statutory limitation relating to torts of four years, but starting from the
discovery of the harm.”**° Perenco conceded that Dr Bed6én made such a comment, but argued
that this was his view de lege ferenda.*””

892 Annex No. 29 to Expert Report of Fabién Andrade Narvaez (“TWELFTH. — Regarding the substantive
matter, this Chamber has considered, and believes pertinent to note in this case, that the environmental action to
request redress for harm, cannot be cl: ‘ied as equal, in any way, to the civil action for damages. Both protect legal
assets of a completely different relevance. The environmental action protects a common good that is essential to
humanity’s existence, and therefore, it is logical that the current Constitution does not contemplate a term for a
statute of limitations for this type of action, as noted by Art. 396 of the Supreme State Rule. The action that is only
Civil for damages, instead, protects other legal assets, related to the property of the individual that, although they are
important, do not have relevance to the collective right to the environment. For this reason, for example the statute
of limitations for actions for damages that are only civil is limited, as per Art. 2235 of the Civil Code. It is important
that we highlight that the constitutional principle that states that in doubt, the rule that most favors environmental
protection shall apply, as it is a standard that generates ample protection, the matters contemplated by the current
Constitution will apply, as it is a standard that creates a broad protection to the environment, above the matters
outlined by the Environmental Management Law or the 1998 Constitution. The provisions of the current
Constitution as it relates to environmental issues and its protection is also preferably applied, since, in procedural
matters, the rules in force at the time of filing the action apply, and not those that were in force when the legal
situation was created. In this case, we observe the moment on which the appeal was filed for application of
constitutional rules in procedural matters, related to the environmental case, in application of the provisions of Art.

(7) Conclusion on the Time Bar Defence

364. The Tribunal concludes that because of the peremptory wording of Article 396, the four-
year limitation period defence is to be rejected. Its view of this effect of Article 396 is supported
by certain additional factors, namely: (i) the court in the Nelson Alcivar case applied Article
396.4 after the Constitution’s entry into force to a case where the damage occurred prior to that
date; (ii) Ecuadorian law does not give preclusive effect to any audit performed at the request
of an operator even if approved by state agencies (although this does not exclude an audit’s use
as evidence in discharging its burden of proof);*°? (iii) the administration of the environmental
laws depends upon the operator’s self-reporting; and (iv) as Perenco’s witness, Mr. Wilfrido
Saltos himself acknowledged (see below), it is sometimes difficult to ascertain exactly when and
where oilfield environmental contamination has occurred. These factors, considered in light of
Article 396, argue in favour of an interpretation of Ecuadorian law which is to be resolved in
favour of the protection of the environment. Thus, a four-year limitation period which is said to
admit of no discovery exception must yield to Article 396 of the 2008 Constitution.

(8) The Legal Effect of Petroamazonas’ Succeeding Perenco in Blocks 7
and 21

365. Ecuador has argued that the combined effect of the 2008 Constitution’s emphasis on “full
restoration” as well as various provisions of the Participation Contracts means that Perenco must
put the two Blocks back into their pre-existing condition, that is, their state prior to the
commencement of hydrocarbons exploitation. The Tribunal considers this to be impossible given
the fact that the Blocks continue to be used for oil production.

366. Perenco adduced extensive evidence showing that when Petroamazonas took over Blocks
7 and 21, it proceeded to undertake a significant expansion of the operational capacity of the
Blocks, and in so doing has drilled 78 new wells, has built new mud pits and is estimated to be
producing about twice the amount of oil that Perenco was producing in July 2009. A new
pipeline is being constructed by Petroamazonas in areas where IEMS considered that Perenco is
liable to remediate the land.°°' Perenco argued that it cannot be under a legal obligation to pay
the cost of removing platforms, piplines, and other appurtenances of oilfield operations that are
still being used or even expanded upon by the succeeding operator. Perenco noted, for example,
that some areas alleged to be contaminated such as the new pipeline’s right of way, where
contamination was detected by IEMS, are said to be covered by the environmental claim.?”

   

398 st-Hearing Brief, Perenco argued that the Nelson Alcivar case was wrongly decided. This may be

so, but as found in the Tribunal’s earlier Decision on the Remaining Issues of Jurisdiction and on Liability, the
i ek to apply Ecuadorian law as the Ecuadorian courts have applied it. See Decision, paragraph 331.

367. The Tribunal agrees that it makes little sense to assume away the existence of
Petroamazonas’ activities and posit a remediation target which would imagine that the Blocks
are no longer used for the production of oil at all. The Participation Contracts have been brought
to an end. Petroamazonas has taken over the Blocks and continues to operate them and has
expanded production thereon. The Tribunal cannot ignore this significant fact.

368. The Tribunal recognises that with the passage of time, in the course of conducting oilfield
operations, Petroamazonas might have caused spills and other contamination. The key period of
time was that falling between July 2009 and the time in which the Parties’ experts conducted
their sampling activities. During this period, it is possible that the condition of the Blocks could
have been adversely affected by the succeeding operator and this must be borne in mind. To the
extent that there is any evidence of environmental harm occurring in the Blocks during the post-
16 July 2009 period, Perenco bears no liability. Under the 2008 Constitution, Petroamazonas is
strictly liable for any such contamination.

369. It can reasonably be asked why a company whose ownership interests in the Blocks have
been brought to an end is nevertheless to be held responsible for any contamination in excess of
regulatory standards which occurred while it was the operator. The Tribunal considers that this
question is answered by the fact that it has already been established in the Decision on
Remaining Issues of Jurisdiction and on Liability that Ecuador was in breach of its contractual
and Treaty obligations. As a result, Perenco has the right to the payment of compensation in
accordance with the applicable legal standards governing quantum as if it had continued to
perform the Participation Contracts in the absence of the breaches. In circumstances where the
State’s breaches are appropriately compensated, and at the end of its contracts’ terms, the
contractor is obliged to return the Blocks in a suitable condition, the assumption must be that the
private contractor itself would act consistently with its public and private law obligations.? In
light of the foregoing analysis, it need hardly be said that the Tribunal rejects Perenco’s
alternative argument (based on the 2008 Constitution) that it bears no responsibility for the
Blocks on the ground that since Petroamazonas is now the operator, it has substituted for Perenco
as the succeeding operator.°™*

(9) Conclusion on the Succession of the Operatorship

370. The Tribunal finds that the only remediation obligation that Perenco can have is for
regulatory exceedances that predate Petroamazonas’ activities and which themselves have not
been overtaken by Petroamazonas’ new works.

908 Under the Participation Contracts Perenco is responsible for any environmental damage resulting from its
operatorship, as well as its positive obligations to “[t]ake responsibility for the cleanup and reforestation of the area
with species similar to those originally found at the site, in order to, with time, allow the potential return to
ions similar to those d at the ing of the ions”, Perenco must bear the
cost of remediating the damage and for those areas in which its oilfield activities were retired by taking the
appropriate cleanup and reforestation measures. (See Exhibit CE-17/CE-CC-28, Block 7 Participation Contract
(translation resubmitted on 04-12-12), PER 04764, 04768, 04769 ; Exhibit CE-10/CE-CC-13, Block 21 Participation
Contract (translation resubmitted on 04-12-12), PER 04659. Above at paragraph 81.)
Claimant’ s Post-Hearing Brief, paragraph 32.

(10) The Tribunal’s Approach to the Fault-based Regime

371. In the Tribunal’s view, having regard to the Ecuadorian case law, the approach taken by
the Ecuadorian courts prior to 2008 was to employ a relatively stringent burden of proof rule
which presumed that the operator engaged in a hazardous activity and benefiting therefrom was
responsible for any resulting damage.” This, however, is a rebuttable presumption.

372. In considering the burden of proof, the Tribunal is mindful of the problems of proof when
an oilfield is operated over a period of years by a single operator or, to make matters more
complicated, by successive operators. The problem here is that the environmental claim is not
based on a single event but rather on an accumulation of discrete events occurring at different
sites at different times (and in circumstances where the operator is itself responsible for reporting
any spills or other contamination). How, for example, does a tribunal differentiate between the
acts of successive operators or even differentiate between the cumulative effect of the acts of the
same operator on a particular platform? While it agrees with Perenco that it cannot presume that
Perenco is the author of all harm that has been detected, once a regulatory exceedance resulting
from a potentially hazardous activity is shown, Perenco is prima facie responsible therefor.

373. Proof of causation in relation to an environmental tort raises very difficult issues. How is
the Tribunal to determine whether the operator fell below its duty of care in every specific
instance of contamination? The Delfina Torres case speaks of the “events that caused the harm”;
this could be taken to refer to specifically identified acts of negligence; equally it could refer to
the carrying on of a particular hazardous activity that is likely to cause harm. If the latter
conception is to be applied, the oil industry would seem to be such an activity.

374. Given the special difficulties attendant in proving the commission of an environmental
tort, it appears to the Tribunal to be wrong in principle that an operator can simply plead that a
spill occurred in the ordinary course of business and it is not liable therefor unless it is proved to
have acted negligently. The Tribunal is thus inclined to employ a strong rebuttable presumption
that if there is a regulatory exceedance, that in itself is evidence of fault. Any alternative
approach would make it too onerous for a claimant because it would likely lack sufficient
evidence to demonstrate that the operator failed in its duty of care in many if not most instances
in which regulatory exceedances have occurred. The Tribunal considers that regulatory
exceedances are indicative of operational failures and therefore should be taken as falling below
the standard of care.

375. In the Tribunal’s view, this approach is also consonant with industry practice. The
Participation Contracts excluded environmental damage caused by the State before the start of
the Contracts’ terms (in Block 7’s case, before the start of the term of the original Service
Contract, and in the case of Block 21, before the start of the term of the Participation Contract).
This of course required a succeeding operator to evaluate the state of the Blocks in order to avoid
the possibility of its later being held liable for the acts of its predecessor. If it did not take steps
905 In Delfina Torres, the court held that: “The claimant had to prove: a) the harm of which it claims it is a
victim; b) its amount or quantum; and c) the events that caused the harm.” Exhibit EL-145, Delfina Torres, p 32.

906 Referring to the Delfina Torres, Medardo Luna and Andrade Medina cases, at paragraph 39, Perenco’s
Post-Hearing Brief puts the matter thus: “All of these cases confirm that prior to the 2008 Constitution the liability
of an operator of a hazardous activity requires fault as a constitutive element, but that fault is rebuttably presumed.”

118

to ascertain the Blocks’ condition, it ran the risk that it could be held liable for the acts of its
predecessor due to the challenge of proving that the predecessor caused the environmental
contamination.

376. Thereafter, the Participation Contracts left it to the contractor to ensure that the
environmental conditions were preserved. They are clear that the contractor was responsible to
ensure that no environmental harm was caused by its activities, and a failure to do so would
entail its liability. To the extent that one operator was succeeded by another operator, the
industry practice was that the succeeding operator would conduct its own audit with a view to
ensuring that it did not inherit an environmental liability for which it might be held
responsible.” In this respect, the Tribunal agrees with Ecuador that it was for the contractors to
allocate the risks inter se to determine where liability for environmental damage arising during
the course of the Participation Contracts would land. This was not a matter for the State to
determine.°°°

377. Turning to the terms of the Participation Contracts, the way in which Clause 5.1.20.10
was framed indicated that as between Petroecuador and the private contractor, there was a clear
and general imposition of responsibility on the State for the Blocks’ condition at the time of the
first private contractor’s commencement of operations. Likewise, the contractor bore
responsibility for their return to their original environmental condition. This suggests that the
contractual regime was broadly consistent with the fault-based regime, and even with the strict
liability regime later established by the 2008 Constitution. (The Tribunal recalls Ecuador’s
disclaiming that its claim in the current proceeding sounded in contract. For the Tribunal, the
Participation Contracts’ relevance to the present case lies in their general approach to
environmental stewardship and the Blocks’ conditions at the time of their surrender.)

378. Given the problems of proof when seeking to shift responsibility for tortious claims, it is
possible that an operator might end up being found liable for an act of contamination possibly
caused by its predecessor. The best way for the contractor to protect its legal interests was for it
to comprehensively document the environmental condition of the Blocks at the time that it
assumed responsibility for them.

Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 6, pp 1592-1594 (Testimony of Alex Martinez): “Q: In this
case you just happened to acquire a company that had an interest in Ecuador, so you were essentially buying
whatever they had. But is it my understanding, then, that if - is this the practice in the oil industry that buying a
specific asset, so going into a specific operation you would want to know what - whether there was contamination in
the oil fields that has been caused by the previous operator for the purposes of allocating responsibility? A: That's
correct. That's the normal process. We go and do due diligence on that particular asset to the best of our capability. I
mean, that's--you know, we'd do as much as we could to figure out what was there. And we will do that. I mean,
other properties that we've, you know, we've gone through an acquisition, we'll go in and make sure our agency
folks go and review all of that. So, yes. That's a normal practice, except in this case I was telling--at least for
ConocoPhillips.”

908 Ecuador contends that this was accepted by Perenco, which in practice and in its evidence in this arbitration
demonstrates it as remediating contamination left behind by the previous operator in the Blocks (referring to the
evidence of Mr. Saltos, in particular). Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, p 77 (Opening Statement of
Eduardo Silva Romero).

119

(11) Conclusion on the Fault-based Regime

379. In sum, if a regulatory exceedance occurred, Perenco is to be taken to have fallen below
the requisite duty of care and will be held liable unless it can prove on a preponderance of
evidence: (i) an occurrence of a force majeure event; (ii) that it did not fall below the standard of
care in respect of that specific instance of contamination; or (iii) that some other person caused
the harm.

(12) Determining the State of Blocks 7 and 21 at the Time of Perenco’s
Acquisition of its Interests

380. In both the Parties’ written pleadings and in their experts’ reports, there was considerable
debate over whether certain instances of contamination were attributable to the actions of
Perenco or to other parties who carried on operations in what became Blocks 7 and 21 before
Perenco arrived on the scene. In view of the Tribunal’s finding that under the fault-based regime
Perenco can avoid liability if it can demonstrate that a particular instance of contamination
resulted from the acts of another person, this necessarily requires the Tribunal to consider the
environmental condition of the two Blocks at the time that Perenco acquired its interests from
Kerr-McGee.

381. In response to a question from the Tribunal, Mr. Alexis Martinez, a witness for Perenco,
explained the general practice of oil companies when it comes to acquiring interests in ongoing
operations. Mr. Martinez testified that: (i) an incoming operator seeks to ascertain the extent of
any existing environmental liabilities by conducting some form of audit prior to or immediately
upon acquiring its interest (as in fact Oryx did when it became involved with the Blocks*”
ConocoPhillips did when it acquired Burlington’s assets in Ecuador?!® and, as Mr. Saltos
appeared to recall, Perenco did when it acquired its interests in the Blocks);?!! (ii) incoming
operators typically obtain representations and warranties from their predecessor-in-interest on the
block’s environmental condition as at the time of its sale;°!? and (iii) purchasers typically require
the inclusion of indemnification provisions in the Sale and Purchase Agreement (SPA) so that

they may be indemnified for any liability for contamination which is attributable to their
predecessor. ?!

382. This sort of appraisal was performed by Oryx when it took over operations in the Coca-
Payamino Field in 1994. The introduction to its May 1994 Environmental Assessment stated in
this regard that, “[t]he objective of this assessment was to determine the current environmental
status of all sites and facilities to support the take over of operations by Oryx on February 12,
1994.”°'4 The 141-page document contained appendices which included a file of the
correspondence between Oryx and Petroproduccién and the daily production reports that the
latter sent to Oryx, a database compiled from site summary sheets and site status tables, and a
copy of the completed inspection checklists.?'* Although in some respects the report was quite
comprehensive, regrettably for the purposes of the present proceeding, the consultants did not
perform sampling. The report notes in this regard:

Based on the visual inspection of the sites and the spills identified the
level of contamination is deemed to be minimal. However, as this study
did not include sampling and analysis, no confirmation of contamination
levels can be made.”!°

383. One other fact emerges from the report. It noted the absence of an incident reporting
system on Petroproduccion’s part:

There is presently no reporting or written procedures within
PetroProduccién [sic] for environmental pollution or spill incident
reporting. An incident reporting system should be put in place as soon as
possible.?!7

384. Thus, the 1994 report is not of much assistance other than it shows how Oryx sought to
evaluate what it was taking on, that at the time of its entry into the field, the level of
contamination was deemed to be minimal, and Petroproduccién’s environmental monitoring
practices were considered to be rudimentary.

385. There are other such studies on the record. For example, when Oryx was negotiating to
resume the operatorship of the Coca-Payamino Field (it evidently had been operated by
Petroproduccion for some eighteen months), a Mr. Patrick Grizzle (who appears to have been an
Oryx employee!*) conducted an inspection from 12 to 14 January 1998. Mr. Grizzle’s view was
that environmental conditions had deteriorated in the period during which the field was being
operated by Petroproduccion and he was critical of its operatorship. Oryx had operated the field

from 1995 to 1997 and Mr. Grizzle recorded what he viewed as backsliding from many of
Oryx’s better practices. He appears to have reached this conclusion entirely on visual inspections
(many photographs are attached to the report). Once again, according to the report, no sampling
of soils, surface water or groundwater were taken.°!9

386. The question naturally arises as to what Perenco did when it succeeded Kerr-McGee. Mr.
Saltos was questioned about this and his exchange with counsel went as follows:

Q. Now, in 1994, Oryx assumed operations for the Coca-Payamino
Field; correct?

A. Yes. Within the context of the Unified Operation Agreement.

Q. Okay, sir. And if you could look to Tab 15, this is an environmental
assessment of the Coca-Payamino Field; correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Which was undertaken by--or conducted by or on behalf of Oryx after
it took over this field; correct?

A. Can you repeat, please.

Q. And this environmental assessment was undertaken on behalf of Oryx
in February 1994, as it was taking over the Coca-Payamino Field;
correct?

A. Yes. Specifically here, it says May 1994. That is to say, after they
took over the operations area.°”°

387. Mr. Saltos was asked whether the same sort of exercise was conducted by Perenco:

A. Yes, an assessment was conducted also.

Q. And to be clear, you're not referring to the biannual audit that was
submitted or conducted on behalf of Perenco for the purposes of the--of
its regulatory requirements. You're talking about an internal Perenco
assessment audit; is that correct?

A. No. The biannual audit was not internal in nature. It was a compliance
audit, and this was done under the environmental regulations and
because it was requested of us by DINAPA.

Q. Okay. But set aside the biannual audit for a moment. Perenco also
undertook an internal audit when it took over the works in or around
2002; correct?

A. Yes. That was the usual practice of Perenco up to McGee [sic] and
also Oryx.

Q. (Overlapping translation)—to understake internal assessments or
audits when they took over the works--responsibility for the works;
correct?

A. Yes. When there was a change in the operatorship or--also, well,
yearly to assess the conditions of the environmental management in the
Blocks.”°?!

388. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Tribunal requested Perenco to conduct a search for
the evaluation that Mr. Saltos recalled having been conducted. Counsel for Perenco subsequently
advised that: “Regarding the Tribunal’s request for a 2002 study ‘done of the state of the Blocks’
at the time of Perenco’s acquisition thereof ... no written report was ever prepared of the
inspection made at that time.”???

389. The Tribunal takes from this response that Perenco’s position is that an inspection was
conducted, but unlike Oryx/Kerr-McGee and Burlington, Perenco did not have it reduced to
writing. The Tribunal finds this to be surprising because it seems obvious that a prudent operator
would conduct a reasonably comprehensive written study of the condition of the blocks that it
was taking over.°”> Thus, a contemporaneous written appraisal of the Blocks’ conditions in 2002
from Perenco’s point of view — the party who presumably would be most interested in ensuring
that it was not taking on the possibility of being held liable for the acts of its predecessor — was
not prepared.

390. The absence of such a study assumes further significance when one considers that
although a third party audit of both blocks was performed in 2002 (evidently initiated when
Kerr-McGee was the operator but concluded at around the time that Perenco acquired its
interests), Perenco inexplicably did not have the 2004 audits performed as required by the
Ecuadorian regime. The absence of a study at the time of acquisition combined with the failure
to perform the 2004 audit after it assumed control of the Blocks suggests a less than complete
concern about ascertaining the environmental conditions.

391. Reasoning that the parties to the Purchase and Sale Agreement (PSA) would likely have
allocated risks between them with respect to environmental liabilities, the Tribunal requested a
copy of Perenco’s Purchase and Sale Agreement with Kerr-McGee. This was produced by

Perenco after the hearing. Section 9 of the agreement indicates that Perenco had recourse against
Kerr-McGee for any damage that occurred as a result of its operations prior to 13 December
2001 by means of an indemnification action for monetary loss.

392. The Kerr-McGee/Perenco Purchase and Sale Agreement PSA provides an indication of
the Blocks’ condition at the time of Perenco’s acquisition because the vendor represented and
warranted that it had complied with all applicable Ecuadorian Laws relating to the environment,
with the exception of certain matters listed in two schedules to the Contracts.

393. The Tribunal finds it helpful to quote the relevant provision of the PSA in full:

Section 3.9 Environmental Laws. KMEEC [Kerr-McGee] has complied
with, and, to KMEEC’s knowledge (after making an investigation of
Seller’s records and an inquiry to KMEEC’s personnel), operations
related to the Assets have been in compliance with, all applicable
Ecuadorian Laws relating to the environment, including without
limitation, Ecuadorian Laws relating to (a) the control of any potential
pollutant, or protection of the air, water or land, (b) solid, gaseous or
liquid waste generation, handling, treatment, storage, disposal,
transportation or remediation, (c) exposure to hazardous or toxic
substances, and (d) protection of wildlife or indigenous people or historic
resources (“Environmental Laws”). Except_as_set forth in Schedule
3.9(a), to KMEEC’s knowledge (after_making an_investigation of
KMEEC’s records and an inquiry to KMEEC’s personnel), all hazardous
materials generated from the use, construction or operation of the Assets
have been _handled_and_disposed_of_in accordance with applicable
Environmental Laws. To KMEEC’s knowledge (after making an
investigation of KMEEC’s records and an inquiry to KMEEC’s
personnel), there has been no contamination of, or releases into,
groundwater, surface water, or soil on the Contract Areas resulting from
activities related to the Assets, which require remediation under
applicable Environmental Laws (or would require remediation, were all
facts known to applicable Governmental Authorities). Schedule 3.9(b)
sets forth a list provided by KMEEC of all wells that have been drilled
on the Contract Areas and the current status of each such well. To
KMEEC’s knowledge (after making an investigation of KMEEC’s
records and an inquiry to KMEEC’s personnel), KMEEC is not aware of
any wells on the Contract Areas where any different status of the wells
on the Contract Areas, except as listed on Schedule 3.9(b). To KMEEC’s
knowledge (after making an investigation of KMEEC’s records and an
inquiry to KMEEC’s personnel), all wells identified on Schedule 3.9(b)
as having been abandoned have been properly plugged and abandoned in
accordance with applicable Ecuadorian Laws. °*

394. Clause 3.9 thus records Kerr-McGee’s representation that it had complied with all
applicable Ecuadorian environmental laws and that there were no exceedances except for those
listed in Schedule 3.9(a). Reference to that schedule in turn shows the following steps that still

and 21, December 13, 2001, p 17 in document [Emphasis added.].

124

had to be taken in order for Block 21 to be brought into compliance. Once again, the Tribunal
quotes the schedule in full:

SCHEDULE 3.9(a)
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

1. Letter, referenced DINAPA-CSA-160-2001-20001697, dated
September 4, 2001 from DINAPA (Direccién Nacional de Proteccién
Ambiental) to Operator regarding an environmental inspection
completed by DINAPA of Block 21 and setting forth the following
requirements:

e Carry out maintenance of the drainage system around existing wells
in the Yuralpa Field;

e Recondition the site for classification of solid waste;

e Relocate scrap existing in Operator’s temporary camp;

e Recondition the grease trap existing at the end of the diesel tank that
supplies diesel to the power generator;

¢ Remove soil contaminated with lubricant oil in the generator area;

e Add the existing incinerator to the air monitoring plan;

e Provide DINAPA with black water analyses of gray and black waters
being discharged at the Operator’s temporary camp;

e Provide DINAPA with blackwater analyses of gray and black waters
being injected underground by the seismic contractor and the
stratographic profile of the respective wells; and

e Conduct maintenance of existing slopes of roads that connect with
the platforms in order to avoid landslides within the field.°>

395. According to the vendor and evidently after an inspection by DINAPA, these were the
issues of non- or further compliance that needed to be addressed.

396. Schedule 3.9(a) assumes some importance for the current proceeding. In the Tribunal’s
view, it has two consequences: First, Perenco cannot be held liable for exceedances or other
environmental compliance measures listed in the Schedule since, by definition, they preceded its
operatorship. Second (and conversely), if IEMS and/or GSI have found contamination in sites
not listed in Schedule 3.9(a), it might well be that such contamination occurred after Perenco
took possession.

397. In the next phase of this proceeding, it will be helpful to examine DINAPA-CSA-160-
2001-20001697 if a copy of that letter can be located, because it sets out the authority’s view of
what needed to be done at the time in order to bring the Operator into compliance with its legal
obligations. The Tribunal will call upon both Parties to conduct a diligent search of their
respective files to determine whether they have in their possession any other such evaluations of

92s Exhibit CE-CC 414, Purchase and Sale Agreement between Kerr McGee and Perenco regarding Blocks 7

and 21, December 13, 2001, p 48 of PDF.

125

the Blocks, whether performed by themselves or by another party such as Oryx/Kerr-McGee at
around the time of Perenco’s arrival at the scene.

398. For present purposes, while the Tribunal considers that Schedule 3.9(a) provides a helpful
contemporaneous assessment of the Blocks, it cannot be considered to be a definitive and
exhaustive analysis of their environmental condition. There might have been contamination of
which Kerr-McGee was unaware or which it might have failed to disclose.°”° There is no
indication that Perenco challenged Kerr-McGee’s list of noncompliant issues by informing it of
contamination or other regulatory problems which had not been disclosed to it under Schedule
3.9(a) nor is there any evidence of Perenco’s having ever complained to Kerr McGee that it had
made anything other than an accurate disclosure.*”’ Schedule 3.9 (a) thus provides a starting
point for distinguishing between any contamination that might have occurred prior to Perenco’s
acquisition of its interests and any contamination which occurred thereafter.

399. Before leaving the PSA, the Tribunal notes that Section 3.9 referred to a second schedule,
Schedule 3.9(b), which was a list of all wells in the Contract Area and a description of their
status. This schedule was not included in Perenco’s redacted version of the Purchase and Sale
Agreement and should be produced in the next phase of this proceeding because it might shed
additional light on the scope of Perenco’s duty to remediate.

400. This takes the Tribunal to the third source of guidance. As Mr. Saltos noted in the
testimony quoted above, a distinction is to be made between Perenco’s evaluation of the Blocks
for the purposes of acquiring its interests, and its statutory duty, as operator, to have an
independent third party conduct a biennial audit.

401. Ecuador has characterised Perenco’s position as being that “because the audits that it
conducted didn't show evidence of contamination, the Tribunal should be convinced that the
Blocks are, in fact, clean”, a position, that counsel for Ecuador described as “nonsense”, but to
which he added:

. I should like to point out that this position is contradictory with
Perenco’s allegations that all of the environmental harm was already
there when it began operations. In fact, if that was the case, then the
pollution should obviously have surfaced at the start of Perenco’s
operations, and Perenco should have made the necessary reservations to
make sure that it would not be made liable for the harm.”°”*

926 The Grizzle report of January 1999 noted above shows that there were spills in the Coca-Payamino Field

well before Perenco arrived on the scene: see Exhibit CE-CC-21, Environmental Audit of Petroproduccién’s
Operation of the Coca-Payamino Field, January 1999, PER_CC0001020-PER_CC0001022.

An example of this occurring in the case of Oryx can be seen at Exhibit CE-CC-9 (Letter of March 9, 1992
from Luis Cobos (Oryx) to Petroproduccién), where on 9 March 1992, an Oryx Operations Manager wrote to the
Senior Engineer of Petroproduccién informing him that when clearing access to the Payamino-8 well, Oryx found a
spill of crude oil in an area of approximately 50 x 100 metres which seemed to have been caused in the past by a
defect in the test pit wall at the Payamino 2 well. The letter requested Petroproduccidn “as the operator of the
Unified Coca-Payamino Field” to take “the necessary measures and actions to resolve this situation as quickly as
possible.” (PER_CC-0000304).

402. There is a logic to Ecuador’s position. The 2002 environmental audits for Blocks 7 and
21 showed little in the way of contamination.*” A review of the Block 7 audit shows that in
general terms, the Blocks did not exhibit major nonconformities. Of 14 groundwater samples
noted at Table 4-7 of the Audit, only one (at Payamino Camp) showed an exceedance above
Table 4(a) of RAOHE.**” There were certain other nonconformities in other areas. For example,
on infrastructure, the Audit noted:

IV.8.1.1 Infrastructure

e¢ Nonconformity with drainage systems is minor, given that there
is a partial and inefficient system available.

¢ Major nonconformity is caused by poor functionality of concrete
areas of retention near the drill hole in all platforms.

¢ Protection structure (buckets) show conformity in most stations
and platforms, except for Payamino 2, Oso 1, Lobo 3 and 4
which present major nonconformity de [sic] to their absence or
poor condition. (See photographs 18 through 22 under
Infrastructure and Drainage, Annex 6.)°"!

403. In terms of waste management, in general there was “conformity with environment
management of solid and liquid waste in most Fields”, but there was a “major nonconformity in
Oso Field, Oso | platform because there is not an appropriate disposal of solid waste, let alone of
liquid waste (black and gray waters) which are directly discharged to the neighboring estuary
(see Photographs 1, 6 to 12, Waste Management, Annex 6.).79 The evaluation matrix at the end
of the Block 7 Audit listed major non-conformities only for “retention” in the “Payamino Sector”
and otherwise the Block was described as “in conformity” with applicable regulations with a few
“low nonconformities” listed in the matrix.

404. As for Block 21, as Ecuador has correctly noted, the 2002 audit “‘did not record a single
site as being contaminated.”°** Perenco did not take issue with this assertion in its Reply Post-
Hearing Brief.

(13) Conclusion on the State of the Blocks at the Time of Their Acquisition

405. The Tribunal considers that the record evidence indicates some problems with the Coca-
Payamino Field and the Oso | platform which predated Perenco’s operatorship’*, but otherwise,
the PSA’s disclosures and the 2002 Audit do not suggest major environmental problems.

Program for Block 7, including Coca-Payamino field, PER_CC0002831. It refers to a letter dated 28 January 2003
(ie., just after Perenco commenced operations) which referred to a DINAPA letter of 22 January 2003 requesting
the submission of a remediation programme for contaminated areas in Block 7, including the Coca-Payomina Field.
Perenco’s letter noted that the “material requiring remediation is that resulting from recollecting hydrocarbon-
contaminated soils from several Block 7 sites including the Coca-Payomina field.”

127

(14) Observations on Perenco’s Environmental Management Practices in
Blocks 7 and 21

406. The Tribunal considers it necessary to set out some observations on the way in which
Perenco conducted itself in relation to these Blocks under Ecuadorian environmental laws.
Perenco has held itself out as having been a “responsible manager that focused on, preserved,
and even improved the environmental and infrastructural integrity of the Blocks.”°*> On the basis
of certain contemporaneous documents, some of Perenco’s own making, as well as witness
testimony, the Tribunal is not convinced of this assertion. For example, a “Health, Safety,
Environment and Sustainable Development Assessment” performed by ConocoPhillips in
October 2006 (in relation to its acquisition of Burlington), noted that Perenco “does not have an
HSE [Health, Safety Environment] management system in place” although it was “currently in
the process of developing one.”°*° This observation was made four years after Perenco started
operating the Blocks.

407. Given the Tribunal’s view of Perenco’s conduct, as discussed further below, it has
decided not to dispose of this claim on a simple burden of proof approach.

408. The Tribunal also accepts Ecuador’s submission that it might be difficult to have an
accurate picture of the environmental condition of oil blocks situated in a rapidly changing
environment such as the Amazonian rainforest. The combined effect of the hot, humid climate
and rapid growth of vegetation of the Amazonian rainforest zone is of such a nature as to quickly
obscure spills. Indeed, the point was made by Perenco’s Mr. Saltos, who observed:

In one month, a whole area could be revegetated, even though the area
was deforested. There is so much rain, so much humidity, that, well,
plants proliferate. We've had many cases, and_oftentimes this has
happened, that areas that were impaired by a spill, well, you go there the
next month, and there are no vestiges of it [sic] this spill. You can be
walking over this spill and not realize there was a spill.”*

409. This is the view of a representative of the operator who — unlike the environmental
authorities — was closer to the day-to-day operations in the oilfield and therefore comparatively
more knowledgeable as to the occurrence and extent of spills and other forms of contamination.
The Tribunal agrees with Ecuador that the fact that rapid growth of vegetation might obscure a
visual inspection of contaminants, does not mean that they disappear for remediation
purposes.*’* Hence, while as GSI emphasised, visual inspections are an important part of
conducting a thorough assessment, they are hardly adequate to the task of ascertaining the extent
of contamination and the Tribunal is not content to rely upon an expert’s visual evaluation.

410. Perenco failed in its duty to conduct the 2004 audit, with the result that there was a gap in
environmental monitoring from 2002 to 2006. The 2006 audits showed an increase in non-

oas Claimant’s Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 2, 4-6; Rejoinder, paragraphs 2, 289-297.

936 Exhibit CE-CC-126, HSE & SD Assessment and Other Technical Services, Assets in Ecuador, Report
prepared by ERM for Conoco-Phillips, dated November 2006, PER_CC0004420.

Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 6, p 1514 (Testimony of Wilfrido Saltos) [Emphasis added. ].
Ecuador's Post-Hearing Submission, paragraph 11. Ecuador argues further that "a significant number of the
samples showing exceedances were found at depths of one meter or more. Obviously, contamination at the
subsurface depths [is] not readily apparent.”

938

 

128

conformities, which counsel for Ecuador characterised as “a fairly bleak picture of Perenco’s
first four years of operations contrary to the impression Perenco has sought to convey in this
arbitration.”° Ecuador asserted that the 2006 audits show that, contrary to Perenco’s
submission, the increase in incidence of contamination occurred after the year 2000.%° Perenco
took exception to this characterisation, responding that: “...the 2006 audit revealed no major
problems and was approved.”*"!

411. The Tribunal notes that RPS’s third expert report contains a comprehensive summary of
the 2006 and 2008 audits. The number of non-conformities, including major non-conformities, is
striking and tends to weaken Perenco’s claim of strong environmental stewardship. The Tribunal
considers it helpful to summarise RPS’s findings (in a somewhat summary fashion) because they
are quite thorough.

a) Failure to Conduct Biennial Environmental Audits“

 

412. It has already been noted that a biennial environmental audit was not conducted in either
Block 7 (including CPUF) or Block 21 in 2004. This was recorded in the 2006 audits.

413. Excerpts of Ecuambiente’s November 2006 environmental audit findings noted the lack
of 2004 biennial audits:

2006 Block 7 Audit. “Environmental Audit of Block 7,” prepared by Ecuambiente
Consulting Group (November 2006) for Perenco Ecuador, Limited: Ecuambiente stated
that the last environmental audit was in 2002 (Finding 47 — Nonconformance: No
biennial audit in 2004 for Block 7 activities.). The auditor compared findings from the
November 2006 audit with the 2002 audit and listed six areas of repeated noncompliance,
two of which included management of drainage and contaminated soil management.

2006 Block 21 Audit. “Environmental Audit of Block 21” prepared by Ecuambiente
Consulting Group (January 2007 and 2007a) for Perenco Ecuador Limited: Finding No.
— Nonconformance: Biennial audit was not conducted in 2004 for Block 21.

 
 

s, Day 1, pp 122-123 (Opening Statement of Philip Dunham). This
position is taken in the alternative, Ecuador's primarily proceeding on the basis that the audits commissioned by the
Consortium in 2000, 2006 and 2008 were inadequate because of the small number of samples examined: Transcript,
Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, pp 123-124 (Opening Statement of Philip Dunham) (“...if you add up the totality
of the soil samples taken for auditing purposes between 2002 and 2008, the total amounts to 29 soil samples only.”).
See also, Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, p 126 (Opening Statement of Philip Dunham) “...out of a
total of 29 soil and pit leachate samples taken for the 2006 audit—audits, one finds nine nonconforming results. This
is a significant failure rate of some 30 percent.” Perenco relies on, amongst other things, the 2008 audits which it
submits revealed general compliance with only minor regulatory deviations. Ecuador challenges reliance on this
audit because it was rejected by Ecuadorian Ministry of Environment as not representative of the condition of the
Blocks, and because it is significant that Mr. Puente (former employee who worked on “community relations within
Block 7”) who provided evidence of the limited scope of the audit and that it avoided some contaminated areas) was
not called to testify at the hearing in The Hague. (Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, pp 128-129).

129

b) Lack of Environmental Management Plan (Plan _de Manejo
Ambiental)”

414. RPS described a “vital component” of the audit process as_ evaluating
compliance/conformance not only with applicable environmental regulations but also with the
(facility’s or site’s) Environmental Management Plan. An Environmental Management Plan is
used in tandem with an Environmental Impact Study and Monitoring Plan to control and mitigate
impacts that could have a deleterious effect on the environment. RAOHE, Article 41, Section 7A
describes the components of the Environmental Management Plan. RPS noted that GSI
acknowledged the importance of the Environmental Management Plan in their first expert
report.°“4

415. The auditor, Ecuambiente, noted the lack of an Environmental Management Plan for
Block 7 in 2006. The Consortium sought to minimise the significance of this in a letter to the
Undersecretary of Environmental Protection (SPA) within the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum.
The SPA responded stating that this was a serious breach of RAOHE.

2006 Block 7 Audit. Finding 30 — Nonconformance: No Management Plan (Plan de
Manejo) establishing control criteria for development and operations phase in Block 7.
No updated, documented procedures. Obsolete procedures are maintained (Oryx
Manuals, HSE manual dated November 1997, procedures in English).*4

c) Lack of Environmental Licence

416. The Environmental Management Law (Ley de Gestidn Ambiental), Article 20 (1999)
states, “For the initiation of all activities that pose an environmental risk, one must have the
license granted by the corresponding Ministry.” The requirement for Environmental Licences is
stipulated in TULAS Book VI Articles 3, 18, and 25. In the 2008 environmental audits for
Blocks 7 and 21, the following was noted::

2008 Block 7 Audit. Observation 6: Coca-Payamino, Jaguar, Mono, and Gacela fields
lack environmental licenses in accordance with the legal requirement.

2008 Block 21 Audit. Consortium correspondence (Oficio: PER-1350-07) dated 17
December 2007 to the Subsecretary of Environmental Protection (SPA) requesting a
prompt response from the government because the Consortium needed to submit
paperwork in order to obtain Environmental Licenses. (Abrus 2008, page 264 of 510).

“8 RPS ER III, section 6.2.1.

om GSI ER I, Section 5.3.7, paragraphs 205 and 206, pp 82-83.

See also, correspondence between General Manager of the Consortium and SPA dated 19 September 2007
(Oficio No. 645-SPA-DINAPA-CDS): “With respect to your affirmation that the inexistence of an environmental
management Plan for Campo Coca Payamino and Block 7 consists in a slight noncompliance of management plans
and applicable laws according to the applicable scheme of minor non-conformances, I inform you that this
Department considers the finding a serious breach of the Environmental Regulation for Petroleum Operations in
Ecuador and must be categorized as a Major Nonconformance.” (As quoted at RPS ER III, p 88).

130

d) Outdated Environmental Impact Study”

417. The audit noted that when requested to produce an Environmental Impact Study for the
CPUF, the Consortium relied on an outdated EIS that was prepared by another operator some 14
years earlier:

An excerpt from one of the Consortium’s internal weekly reports, Perenco Ecuador
Limited Weekly Report, Period Covering: April 7 through 13, 2007, Section 2 Q.H.S.E.
(Perenco Ecuador Limited 2007 - PERPROD0007596, page 2 of 6) follows: “DINAPA
made a petition with penalty regarding the non-submission of EIS Coca-Payamino Field.
Perenco responded with the copy of the EIS presented in year 1993 and submitted a
communication regarding the no application (sic) of the penalty.

e) Irregularities in Management of Drill Cuttings and Mud Pits’

418. RPS noted that the audits found irregularities in mud pit management in Block 7 and
Block 21 in 2006 and in 2008:

2006 Block 7 Audit: Section 4.4.5 “Table 4-15 Monitoring Results of Drill Cuttings in
Pits in Block 7” (Ecuambiente 2006) contains two tables:-

947

1. Table 4-15 Pits with Impermeable Base (page 51): It compared the results of a
sampling event conducted during the audit at Coca 18-19 with RAOHE Table 7b (i.e., pit
with impermeable base or liner) and did not show exceedances in the analytical results.

2. Table 4-15 Pits Without Impermeable Base (page 52): It showed exceedances in
leachate concentrations at three sites (Oso 3-RLP, Lobo 3 Taladro and Jaguar 9)

RAOHE Table 7a
(i.e., Pit impermeable

Parameter Oso 3- Lobo 3

RLP Taladro | Jasuar®

 

2008 Block 7 Audit: Closed mud pit does not conform with grade (accumulation of
water) (Observation 15).

2006 Block 21 Audit: Monitoring of soil quality in drilling mud pits was not performed
in a timely manner (6 of 16 pits without complete monitoring). Monitoring that was
complete (at time of audit) was within regulatory limits (Finding 12). Areas where drill
cuttings and drilling mud are treated lack appropriate surface drainage systems (Finding
19). Platform soil where mud treatment pits are located is not reconformed [sic]
(presumably not regraded) to similar conditions as the rest of the platform (Finding 20).
Use of area for Perenco activities [auxiliary covering [sic] (presumably capping or
closure) of drilling mud and drill cuttings] without authorization (Finding 28). Lack of
revegetation/reforestation of areas used for drilling muds (Finding 48).

946 RPS ER III, section 6.2.3.
OAT RPS ER III, section 6.3

  

131

2008 Block 21 Audit: As of 31 October, there is no impact evaluation or management
plan for mud pits. This will be a nonconformance in the audit if it is not presented before
the indicated date (Abrus 2008, page 7-2, pdf page 153 of 510, Observation No. 2).

 

f) Irregularities in Wastewater _Treatment_and Impact_to Receiving
Bodies™*

419. The audits noted that RAOHE Table 4 requires liquid discharges to comply with the
maximum permissible limits at two control points:

1. RAOHE Annex 2, Table 4a: Wastewater discharge control point; and

2. RAOHE Annex 2, Table 4b: Receiving body (e.g., creek) immission point. The term
immission point is the point the discharge enters the creek or receiving body.

420. Examples of inadequately treated wastewater were identified during the environmental
audits:°

In 2002, untreated waters from grease and oil traps were discharged directly to a seasonal
creek. The auditor defined “grey waters” (aguas grises) as wastewaters conveyed to
grease and oil traps and discharged directly to the soil.?°°

2002 audit: The drainage systems (ditches, secondary containment) are inefficient and do
not comply with what is stipulated in the environmental impact study and RAOHE.
Major nonconformance in Oso | platform (“Adequate disposal of solid waste does not
exist and even worse is liquid waste (sewage and grey waters),” which is directly
discharged to the adjacent estero (i.e., seasonal creek).

The 2006 Block 7 audit compared the analytical results of samples collected during the
audit with the regulatory limits established in RAOHE, Annex 2 Table 4a. It showed
exceedances at the process wastewater discharge control point (Table 4a) at three sites:

The 2006 Block 7 audit also noted that “Perenco’s activities” may result in the
“possibility of impacting groundwater by injection of saline waters and sanitary
wastewater (i.e., sewage) in old injection wells that do not have environmental studies, in
accordance with RAOHE.” It recommended that “Perenco must establish geologic studies
that ensure injection of formation waters and sewage in old wells (Payamino 3, Punino,
Jaguar CPF, Mono 12) do not provoke environmental risk.”

The 2006 Block 21 audit observed inadequate “grease traps”, identified the
nonconformity that natural drainage was not respected when constructing a “grease trap”
over an estero at control point 2, and observed noncompliance of maximum permissible
limit for the parameter, barium, in internal monitoring of API discharge in March 2006
(subsequent monitoring found that the condition had been corrected).

RPS cited examples where the Consortium’s auditors noted that the water quality of

receiving bodies, such as creeks, was negatively affected by inadequately treated wastewater
and/or by polluted storm water runoff.°°! The concentrations exceeded the maximum permissible
limits in RAOHE, Annex 2, Table 4b.

g) Audit Findings — Contaminated Soils

422. RPS noted that in 2002, the Consortium’s auditor, Efficdcitas, concluded that improper
treatment of contaminated soils had a direct impact on the environment.

2002 Block 7 Audit: “The management and treatment of contaminated soils is partial and
produces direct impacts.”

423. Soil samples collected during the 2006 audit by Ecuambiente showed concentrations of
cadmium and lead above the maximum permissible limits in the regulations.

h) Irregular Waste Management and Chemical Management

2002 Block 7 Audit: The management of the Payamino Sanitary Landfill only partially
complied with what is stipulated in RAOHE and the EIA (i.e., environmental impact
study). It identified a major non conformance in the inadequacy of the disposal of
contaminated soils within the Landfill, and a minor nonconformance in the storage of
chemical containers which were exposed to inclement weather.

2006 Block 7 Audit: The auditor noted that hazardous waste was stored directly on the
soil (finding 37). It cites Photo PA.45, which was not included in Annex B of the 2006

952 RPS ER III, section 6.5.1.
953 RPS ER III, section 6.6

  

134

report provided for review. In general, storage of hazardous waste directly on soil over
multiple years and exposed to inclement weather will exacerbate contamination.

2008 Block 7 Audit: The auditor identified a minor nonconformance in that soil disposed
in the Landfill lacked containment to prevent migration of hydrocarbons (finding 11).

2006 Block 21 Audit: Lack of secondary containment or lack of retention valve for
chemical and fuel tank or equipment (finding 10). A nonconformity in hazardous waste
(batteries, chemical product containers) being given to the organization, La Selva, who is
not permitted to treat this type of waste (finding 31). Auditor identified that chemical
products were found in storm water drainage and outside of drainage trench (finding 36),
and chemical products not protected from rain (finding 38).

2008 Block 21 Audit: Chemical storage containment for Pad A and CPF have openings
and plants growing in them. The containment lacks integrity in the event of a spill
(finding 2).

424. In sum, the audits did not, in the Tribunal’s view, resoundingly endorse Perenco’s
operatorship.
425. In its reply expert report, in response to RPS’s summary of the audits’ findings, GSI

sought to downplay the audits’ significance. It asserted firstly that, “environmental audits are not
intended to prove that the operations are flawless, but, rather, serve to facilitate the continuous
improvement of the operations with regard to environmental, health, and safety concerns” °**, the
implication that the process of complying with environmental regulations is an on-going work in
progress.

426.

954

GSI then devoted three paragraphs to the audits, which the Tribunal quotes in full:

190. The biennial audits completed for the Consortium operations did not
identify significant impacts to soil, and minor issues of this nature were
subsequently resolved. In addition, none of the biennial audits reported
groundwater impacts. In sum, these audit findings do not support the
current claims by IEMS of extensive damage to soil and groundwater.

191. The biennial audits do identify other issues that are unrelated to soil
or groundwater impacts. Many of the issues listed by RPS are
administrative in nature, such as the absence of a required document or
license. In addition, RPS discusses “irregularities” in the management of
drill cuttings and mud pits, which generally reflect minor excursions of
monitoring parameters such as pH and electrical conductance, or failure
to perform testing within a specific timeframe. However, none of the
audit findings identified by RPS are related to any specific claim of
environmental damage now alleged by Ecuador.

192. RPS also discusses soil impacts within the Payamino field,
particularly at the locations of Payamino 02 y 08 and Payamino CPF.

These sites have been thoroughly investigated by IEMS and GSI, and our
findings regarding environmental impacts and related remediation costs

GSI ER Il, paragraph 188.

135

are discussed in detail in this report and our prior report. As discussed in
Section 5 of this report, the soil impacts delineated at these and other
sites are principally related to operations prior to 1990, and are therefore
unrelated to Consortium operations after 2002.°*

427. The Tribunal considers that this does not adequately respond to the list of non-
conformities found by the audits and summarised by RPS. Contrary to the description of many of
the issues as being “administrative in nature”, as the list of non-conformities shows, in addition
to irregularities in treating and confining contaminated soils, wastewater treatment, monitoring
and ensuring proper grading for mud pits and the like, there were basic failings such as: (i)
failing to even conduct an audit in 2004; (ii) not having the Environmental Management Plan
required by RAOHE for the Payamino Camp and Block 7 at all and instead relying on Oryx’s
outdated November 1997 plan;?° (iii) using an Environmental Impact Study for the Coca-
Payamino Field that was prepared by Oryx years before;°” (iv) not having the Environmental
Licences required by the Environmental Management Law and TULAS Book VI Articles 3, 18,
and 25 for certain fields in the Blocks.

428. As for GSI’s attempt to minimise the contamination issues identified in the audits and its
contention that the “biennial audits do identify other issues that are unrelated to soil or
groundwater impacts”, this takes the Tribunal to a third and related point in connection to the
biennial audits. The Tribunal is not convinced that the issues identified were “minor.” The entire
system relies upon compliance with licencing obligations, full and timely reporting, and the
retention of independent auditors in order to conduct thorough audits. The system assumes that
the operator will work with the auditing company in good faith to objectively report the
environmental condition of the Blocks in their entirety.

429. In this respect, the Tribunal was struck by the evidence of one witness who provided a
written statement for Ecuador, but who was not called for cross-examination by Perenco. Mr.
Marco Puente was a former Perenco employee responsible for Community Relations in the
northern section of Block 7 where the Coca-Payamino, Gacela and Lobo fields are located.9°8
Mr. Puente testified as to certain commitments made by Perenco to the local communities, which
are not relevant for present purposes, but more importantly, he testified that:

As Block 7 Community Relations liaison, I intervened as a negotiator or
intermediary with the operator whenever complaints against Perenco

955 GSI ER II, paragraphs 190-192.

956 GSI in its first expert report noted, at paragraph 19, that an Environmental Impact Study (EIS), an
Environmental Management Plan (EMP), and a Monitoring Plan is required for every oilfield development project:
“As specified under the Ecuador [RAOHE] regulation, effective since February 2001, for every oilfield development
project, an Environmental Impact Study (EIS), an Environmental Management Plan (EMP), and a Monitoring Plan
are required to assess the potential risks posed to the environment and design and implement measures to mitigate
such risks. In practical terms, environmental management for the oilfield industry entails minimizing the footprint of
the oilfield facilities; controlling and containing the materials used and generated during drilling and production
operations (mud/ cuttings, crude oil, produced water); and implementing effective response actions if and when
spills of these materials do occur. Specific considerations regarding the use of earthen pits, oil spill prevention and
response, and the use of gas flares, which are relevant to certain allegations made by IEMS or the Republic of
Ecuador in this case, are addressed in further detail below.”

As RPS noted in its third expert report, at paragraph 6.2.3.

Witness Statement of Marco Puente, paragraph 4.

arose from the residents. Most complaints were related to damages to the
natural environment (whether spills of crude or water formations,
overflow of sludge ponds, etc.) or damages caused to local populations
(for example, we received complaints about noise in those areas with
homes close to the platforms as well as complaints regarding damages to
crops). The Coca, Gacela and Payamino fields were the most problematic
in this regard.?°

430. When such incidents occurred, he testified, Perenco would negotiate agreements with the
affected local inhabitants. However:

While in many cases, agreements were reached, the communities
complained to Perenco that an adequate and full environmental
remediation was not made. The communities often complained that the
cleaning of contaminated areas _was_ highly superficial _and_did_not
completely eliminate the contamination. I recall, for example, that we
received a complaint in 2008 regarding the spill of water formation (very
corrosive water produced alongside with crude oil) in a swamp near the
Lobo 3 well. We reached an agreement with about 7 owners of affected
areas _but not any diation of the i d_water was made. In
another case, an oil spill occurred from Payamino | into River Afango
and_the river was never cleaned because Perenco declared that_the
material falling into the river consisted of leaching debris from the coffee
fields, even though the Ci Rel. liaison was present when

the spill occurred and confirmed that_such_ spill consisted_of crude
indeed.°©

431. Mr. Puente also testified as to how the 2008 biennial audit for Block 7, which took place
when he was in the Block, was conducted. As the Community Relations liaison, his role “was to
contact the communities where the auditors should go to collect samples, to inform them of what
was to occur and request permission for the auditors to enter areas of their property.” He testified
further:

As I recall, the Block 7 audit did not last for more than a week and very
few people, from a private Ecuadorian consultant hired by Perenco,
intervened. Given the great extension of Block 7 and the few mobilized
personnel, the scope of the audit was very limited. The auditors were
only able to review certain sites where Perenco employees had expressl:
taken them and which had been previously cleaned, to verify, in
particular, the fulfillment of a_previous audit conducted in 2006. In
addition, auditors arrived with very simple equipment_which only
allowed them to take samples at a depth of between 50 and 60 cm. This
depth is insufficient_to detect _all_the possible contamination _by

hydrocarbons. I do not recall that they were taken to sites where highly
contaminated areas had been detected.”°

Witness Statement of Marco Puente, paragraph 17 [Emphasis added.].

961 Witness statement of Marco Puente, paragraph 19 [Emphasis added.].

137

432. The Tribunal notes that Mr. Puente’s testimony is consistent with IEMS’ critique of the
2008 Block 7 audit. IEMS noted that only 12 sites were sampled by the auditors and only 1
sample was taken at each site, except for Coca CPF, where 2 samples were taken.%°? IEMS
asserted further that the sampling evidently did not take place at different depths, but rather close
to the ground surface.** In such circumstances, it is unsurprising that GSI asserted that the
audits “did not identify significant impacts to soil, and minor issues of this nature were
subsequently resolved.” +

433. Mr. Puente’s testimony was not directly challenged by Perenco and it is troubling. If it is
to be credited — and there is no reason to doubt it — the 2008 audit must be viewed with
skepticism.

434. This takes the Tribunal to a consideration of Perenco’s attitude as operator. In addition to
Mr. Puente’s testimony, the Tribunal was directed to certain documents that portray a disquieting
approach to dealing with incidents of contamination.

435. The first document which has given the Tribunal pause is a memorandum of May 2010
prepared by Perenco regarding the characterisation of the environmental issues in Payamino 2-8.
It concerned an area of soil saturated with crude oil to an average depth of 80 cm and covering
approximately half a hectare. The document acknowledged that this was “contamination caused
by crude oil for which it is not been possible to establish the exact date of occurrence” but which
Perenco assumed occurred prior to its operations (“assuming that it must have occurred during
the time of the operations of the State Oil Company Petroproproduccién (1997-2000)”).°°> The

962 Annex P to IEMS ER I! at pp 2-3: “In relation to the quantity of samples, the auditors of Perenco collected

only 13 samples to evaluate the operations in an area of 2,033,000,000 square meters. This means that each sample
represented an area of approximately 156,000,000 square meters. Even if it is true that, through the use of some
criteria, the studied areas should be reduced and focused exclusively on those areas with potential contamination,
such criteria are not explained in the report examined. Moreover, the fact that 13 samples were taken in an area with
operations presenting a high risk of impact to soil in 62 sites, and with a large number of complaints presented by
the residents of the areas, is, obviously, an insufficient process. In addition, the criteria that were used for the
location of soil samples are not explained. Therefore, it is not clear if these samples were aimed at detecting
contamination.”

Annex P to IEMS ER I! at p 3: “In regards to the quality of the samples, the 13 soil samples were taken by
the auditors of Perenco in a superficial manner. This is so, notwithstanding the fact that these complaints from
residents of the area near the contaminated soil which is buried and covered with layers of non-contaminated soil,
according to the information obtained by IEMS. Therefore, the sampling process should have included samples at
different depths. For this reason, IEMS investigation has included, precisely, samples at different depths (up to
depths superior to 5 meters). As the auditors of Perenco collected the samples from the surface, they did not detect
the contamination covered with layers of non-contaminated soil, as they only studied the layer of clean soil. This
situation does not demonstrate an intention to evaluate these areas claimed as contaminated by the residents of the
communities within Block 7.”

In this respect, the auditor’s shallow soil sampling echoes GSI’s sampling techniques in the present arbitration; RPS
noted that while IEMS collected samples at up to depths of 5.5 metres, GSI limited their investigation of surface
soils to 0.3 metres below ground surface. RPS ER III, p 8, “The results for the risk characterization samples are not
expected to be of the of in i soils, and do not correctly represent
the potential for exposure, since only 1) surface soils 0 to 0.3 meters below ground surface were collected, while
RBCA [Risk-Based Corrective Action] protocol for surface soils is 0 to 1.0 meters below ground surface...” and p
50, where the point is repeated.

964 GSI ER II, paragraph 190.

965 Exhibit E-170, Memorandum prepared by Perenco on the characterization of the environmental issues in
Payamino 2-8 (Caracterizacién de Pendientes Ambientales Payamino 2-8) dated May 2010, p 1.

  

   

  

 

138

contamination was discovered by the owner of the lands, Mr. Daniel Jungal, when he was
hunting.°°

436. The memorandum recounted the fact that the “knowledge of the existence of this issue is
limited to the following people and organizations”:

PERENCO-QUITO: we know the true extent of the problem

DANIEL JUNGAL - Owner: knows exactly the extent and impacts of
the problem, as well as the consequences and effects of its spreading out

PETROAMAZONAS-MANAGEMENT QSHE-DEPARTMENT
BLOCK 7: only knows of the existence of ‘contamination behind the
Payamino 2-8 platform’ but does not know the exact location nor of its
extent

OMBUDSMAN - DIOCLES ZAMBRANA: knows the exact location of
the problem, but not its true extent

VENCEDORES - ZIGIFREDO CEVALLOS: knows that the
environmental damage exists and that it is near Payamino 2-8 but not the
exact place nor extent.”

437. The memorandum noted further that Mr. Jungal had “orally offered not to allow
claimants or judicial officers to access his land, at least where we consider that it is not in our
interest that it be visited.”°®* Even accounting for the fact that at the time of its writing Perenco
and Ecuador were locked in the current adversarial process, this is a disquieting statement.

438. The memorandum then set out “possible solutions” to the problem including,
“conventional remediation” of the location, “confine the problem and justify leaving the area as
it is”, “dismiss the issue” (which it was noted could lead to a lawsuit and “multimillion dollars
compensation” as well as lead the State to “force us to remedy the site under their conditions” in
a situation where “the cost will reach amounts very difficult to estimate now” and “the
reputational cost to Perenco will also be very high”).°”

439. The final passage of the Memorandum which is relevant for present purposes noted:

“The State will probably assume that_we are hiding many more
environmental] damages and will scrutinize the operations area in
search for more damages and it will probably find them.”°”

440. Perenco settled with Mr. Jungal without admitting liability. Only after it was notified on
22 May 2010 by a Civil Judge from Pinchincha that there would be a judicial inspection on 11
June 2010 did it inform the Minister of Environment of the contamination by letter of the same
date. In the letter, it attributed the damage to a prior operator and disclaimed any responsibility
for any of the damages and remedial costs arising from the event.?”!

441. Prior to informing the Ministry of the contamination, however, Perenco retained a
laboratory to take samples with a view to determining when the spill occurred. As Ecuador noted
in its Counter-Memorial on Liability and the Counterclaims:

Perenco sent several samples, taken by its own employee, Mr. Wilfrido
Saltos, to be analyzed by a laboratory named Griintech.*”* On 2 June
2010, this laboratory concluded that the sample received was highly
contaminated with hydrocarbons and estimated that the contamination
occurred 4 to 7 years earlier, i.e., during the time Perenco was acting as
operator.°”?

442. The laboratory’s finding, which it noted was not conclusive, was inconsistent with
Perenco’s contention that the contamination predated its involvement in the Blocks. When
writing to the Ministry eight days later, however, and without adverting to Griintech’s findings,
Perenco maintained its position that someone else was responsible for this major spill without
disclosing the possibility that Perenco itself might be:°”*

om Exhibit E-161, Letter from Perenco to the Minister of Environment dated 11 June 2010. The confidential

settlement agreement was concluded between Perenco and Mr. Jungal and Ms. Nancy Cecelia Cardenas Hernandez
on 11 May 2010 (Exhibit CE-CC-235, Settlement Agreement with Jose Daniel Jungal, May 11, 2010 (Confidential),
PER_CC007439). The settlement agreement records the statement that: “An inspection was done by a company
expert, and everything indicates that the most important impacts occurred more than 10 years ago, that is to say, they
occurred when Perenco was not the operator.” A further recital recorded that Perenco “as an act of good faith agrees
to enter into this agreement in order to end all controversies that have arisen between the Parties to cover all of these
years.” There were prior complaints made by Mr Jungal. Annex E to IEMS ER II, contains minutes of a meeting
held on 15 September 2005 between the Ombudsman Office of Orellana and Mr. Jungal and Dr. Gabriella Rumazo
representing Perenco along with Engineer David Trujullo. Exhibit E-269 (“Informe de inspeccién N° 07-07, H.
Consejo Provincial de Orellana — Departamento del Ambiente,” dated 10 April 2007) is a report of an inspection of
Mr. Jungal’s farm conducted by the Orellana Department of the Environment on 10 April 2007.

on Exhibits E-171, Griintech’s Analysis Report dated 2 June 2010; E-161, Letter from Perenco to the Minister
of Environment dated 11 June 2010

973 Ecuador’s Counter-Memorial, paragraph 745.

There is conflicting evidence on this point. Exhibit E-269 is a report of an inspection of Mr. Jungal’s farm
conducted by the Orellana Department of the Environment on 10 April 2007. Among other areas, the inspection
looked at the Payamino 4, 2-8, 20-24-14, 18 and 22 platforms. It found, “On the #02-08 platform (point 4) and to the
side of it, a large area of approximately 20,000 m? was found containing crude oil residues in large quantities.”
During his cross-examination, Mr. Saltos stated that he was unaware of this inspection report until it was entered
into the record of the arbitration. Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 6, pp 1517-1518 (Testimony of
Wilfrido Saltos). The transcript then records the following exchange between counsel and Mr. Saltos:

on4

Q. But according to this inspection, sir, in April 2007, crude could still be found on the platform itself:
correct?

A. Well, in the platform itself, there must have been--or there could have been crude oil because this is an
operational platform and occasionally there are some sprays--there is some spraying or there is the
spreading of hydrocarbons or diesel. So, certainly there must have been some on the platform.

140

“In effect, the spill seems to have been caused by prior events not solely
to the [sic] presence of Perenco and Kerr McGee in Block 7 and the Coca
Payamino field, but also to the execution of the Participation Contract for
the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons in Block 7 of the
Amazon Region and the Unified Coca-Payamino Field (“Block 7
Contract’). CEPE — The Ecuadorian State Oil Corporation (which years
later was replaced by Petroecuador and recently by EP
PETROECUADOR) drilled Payamino well number 2 in 1987; and Oryx
Ecuador Energy Company drilled Payamino well number 8 in 1992.

These facts strongly suggest that the alleged environmental incident, if
existed, occurred prior to Perenco or its predecessors having any kind of
control over the Payamino 2 and 8 wells. Consequently, Perenco is not
responsible for any of the damages or remedial costs arising from any
leakage from the Coca-Payamino field.”°”>

443. Another document exhibits the same attitude. In an email of 19 December 2008 to the
Block 7 HES Supervisor, Mr. Saltos referred to an upcoming inspection of the Block 7 Jaguar
Field in the following terms:

Please, closely read the initial soap opera documents listed below and
apply immediate corrective action so that, when the inspection date
comes, we will not have to regret unfavorable reports. We must
especially update:

 

Discharge of served waters from a plant ... We have to clean the banks
of the canal, about 100 meters below the discharge, clean the grease trap,
confirm parameters; we have to take into account that we already have
NC _+ [ie., a major non-conformity®] included in the 2008 audit,
precisely due to this finding, and that Dinapah [sic] has sentenced us
with an ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD and FINE which we have yet to
know who will pay (?) or who we will impose it on (?).”

 

 

Q. Well, sir, this delegation goes to the platform in April 2007 and finds both on the platform and to the
side of it some 20,000 cubic meters—square meters, sorry, of contamination, and you were not aware,
Perenco was not aware, had not observed this contamination. That is your testimony, sir; correct?

A. That's correct. This Report that was drafted there was not made aware to me, and I wasn't aware of it.
And in addition to that, we are not aware of the conditions under which the samples were taken or what
samples were taken. We don't know.

Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 6, pp 1519-1520 (Testimony of Wilfrido Saltos).

After receiving the results of the Griintech report, in October 2010, Perenco retained Walsh Environmental
Scientists and Engineers to conduct an evaluation of the Jungal swamp. It issued a report concurring with Perenco’s
belief that a preceding operator was responsible. Exhibit E-163, Informe Técnico: Caracterizacién del Pasivo
Ambiental Adyacente a la Plataforma Payamino 2-8 — Campo Unificado Coca-Payamino, dated October 2010.
Ecuador alleged that the Walsh report was intended to find another operator responsible in the hopes of avoiding
liability.

76 At the hearing, Mr. Saltos acknowledged that the term “NC +” in the 2008 Audit referred to a major non-
compliance: see Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 5, pp 1491-1492 (Testimony of Wilfrido Saltos).

 

141

The site destined to treatment of contaminated soil... we must review
that the i ditches and grease traps are operating well (if not.

we have to construct them immediately).

It is necessary that we verify, and ensure compliance with the
recommended works since, due to the distance, this will surely be
assigned to the coordinators of south, which, to me, has a "reserved
prognosis”, until the contrary is demonstrated.

L especially recommend not creating too much attention around these
works (military?), so that there is no resistance, and so that it cannot be
documented, (be careful with pictures) that we are doing this, because
the referenced inspection is approaching; it will be very appropriate for
us to do this on holidays and without using Manguilla workers."°”

444. When cross-examined, Mr. Saltos downplayed any suggestion that he was trying to
mislead the authorities or avoid having the problem documented, and sought to put his views in a
better light as follows: “We have a word that has to do with the wheeling and dealing, and the
things that may cause more problems than the ones with that we want to solve.”°78

So that's why I say ‘military’ in between parentheses because we had a
group of military personnel that gave us some physical security and
protection, and they were there on the field. But their role is--they don't
have much to do during the day. So as soon as they saw that someone
was moving or doing some sort of activity, they took pictures and they
sent the pictures to their supervisors. So the pictures and the reports
made their way to the authorities of the company, and even outside the
company, and they caused unnecessary problems and sometimes serious
problems that were unfounded. So I wanted to avoid that so that the
military were not in the area. That's what I was referring to.°”

445. The Tribunal is not satisfied that this testimony cleared up the document’s infelicities.

446. It might be that these documents are not representative of Perenco’s general approach to
the stewardship of the Blocks.**° But combined with Mr. Puente’s unchallenged testimony that
the 2008 Block 7 audit was organised to focus on areas that were previously cleaned up — the
same thing that Mr. Saltos was urging the Block 7 HES Supervisor to do before the inspection
took place — and the limited sampling performed in the 2008 audit of Block 7, the documentary
evidence casts doubt on Perenco’s claim that “whenever an incident occurred that affected the
environment, the Consortium promptly notified the State, performed all required repairs,
remediation and cleanup and obtained the State’s approval of the remediation.”®*! It also
underscores the Tribunal’s belief that with operations in a rainforest environment and the self-

reporting nature of the regulatory regime, the environmental regime is only as good as the
information that is discoverable, reported and acted on.

(15) Conclusion on Perenco’s Environmental Management Practices in
Blocks 7 and 21

447. In sum, the Tribunal considers that Perenco’s claims of strong environmental law
compliance are not made out. While the Tribunal is not prepared to find that Perenco consistently
sought to conceal instances of contamination, there is some evidence that it was less than
forthcoming in some instances. The 2010 memorandum’s comment on the Payamino 2-8
contamination that the “State will probably assume that we are hiding many more
[environmental] damages and will scrutinize the operations area in search for more damages and
it will probably find them” is very troubling. This evidence, combined with the company’s
failure to document the environmental condition of the two Blocks at the time of the acquisition
of its interests, its failure to conduct the statutorily required audits in 2004, its use of outdated
environmental documents during the course of the operations, its failure to obtain necessary
licenses, the increase in the incidence of nonconformities detected in the 2006 and 2008 audits,
and Mr. Puente’s unchallenged testimony as to the approach taken in the 2008 Block 7 audit do
not paint a picture of a responsible environmental steward.

448. With these observations in mind, the Tribunal now turns to the expert evidence on the
environmental condition of the two Blocks.

Cc. Modelling versus Delineation

449. Turning to the modelling versus delineation method of mapping the extent of the
contamination, this can be determined summarily. Although the evidence relating to modelling
versus delineation took up a substantial amount of time at the hearing, the Tribunal believes it
can express its views simply without going into great detail about this evidence. °**

450. The Tribunal has no hesitation in coming down squarely in favour of delineation. The
reasons are manifold, but the principal ones are the following.

451. First, the Tribunal was convinced that the maps resulting from the use of the ArcGIS
software which sought to model the extent of the contamination in the two Blocks did not
adequately reflect their topography. The “spilled coffee on the crumpled paper” demonstrative
exhibit employed by TEMS’ Mr. Chaves during the course of direct examination did not
convince the Tribunal that the model sufficiently accounted for topography and therefore was
more accurate than delineation measurements taken around areas of the Blocks which showed
regulatory exceedances.

452. Second, although the Tribunal has no reason to doubt IEMS’ environmental credentials in
general and considers the witneses to be serious professionals, it found that its representatives’
attempts to explain how they had employed the software program and their responses to
questions posed during cross-examination did not exhibit either a sufficient degree of precision
and clarity or show an adequate use of the software’s internal validation methods to be able to

982

 

contentions in respect of this particular issue are set out in detail at paragraphs 197 to 283 of
this Decision and it is unnecessary of the Tribunal to repeat the points in order to explain its reasoning.

143

engender the Tribunal’s confidence in the mapping exercise, particularly given the very large
areas of purported contamination that were generated by the software’s use.°**

453. By contrast, the Tribunal considered that Dr. Rouhani persuasively demonstrated that the
Arc-GIS software modelling conducted by IEMS was not performed to a sufficient standard of
reliability. For example, Mr. Chaves and Dr. Rouhani agreed that ArcGIS contained a means of
testing results known as “cross-validation.”°** On cross-examination, Mr. Chaves testified that
he ran a cross-validation analysis for only one map out of the hundreds that he created.°** It was
then shown that the error demonstrated in this cross-validation was substantial.°*°

454. Third, Dr. Rouhani described delineation as the “standard conventional approach” when
seeking to characterise and quantify contamination.**” In this respect, Ecuador’s other
environmental experts, RPS, also acknowledged on cross-examination that “delineation is a
standard approach to defining the edges of contamination” and that they did not fault GSI for
using that method.?**

455. Fourth, the Tribunal notes GSI’s evidence that in some areas that had been represented as
contaminated in IEMS’ map, GSI had found clean delineation samples and indeed IEMS itself
found clean samples, yet the model had predicted contamination.”*

(wD Conclusion on Modelling versus Delineation

456. In sum, the general use of delineation in the industry when seeking to determine the
existence and extent of contamination, the difficulty exhibited by IEMS when seeking to explain
what they had done in the modelling exercise, Dr. Rouhani’s contrasting testimony which was
clear and convincing, considered together with the demonstrative exhibits employed by the
Parties, has created such strong doubt in the Tribunal’s mind that it is compelled to reject the
mapping exercise in its entirety. Given its view as to the frailties of IEMS’ mapping exercise, the
Tribunal considers that delineation of contaminated sites is the appropriate means of ascertaining
the volume of soil that requires remediation.

D. The Tribunal’s Findings on the Regulatory Standards That Should be
Applied

457. Given that it now has before it a “regulatory exceedances case” as opposed to a
“background values case”, the Tribunal turns to the question of which regulatory standards
apply.

458. The principal issues, as the Tribunal sees them, are the following: (i) whether RAOHE
Annex 2, Table 6 represents the comprehensive list of contaminants when testing for
93 See Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 4, pp 1121-1128 (Testimony of IEMS); Transcript, Hearing

environmental damage as a result of hydrocarbon operations or whether TULAS Tables 2 or 3
provide additional remediation criteria that should be applied; (ii) whether the regulatory criteria
in Ecuador requires the use of “indicator parameters” when testing for contamination of the
environment by hydrocarbon activities; (iii) which land-use classification should be applied

459. Each will be addressed in turn.

(wD Whether RAOHE Annex 2, Table 6 represents the comprehensive list
of contaminants when testing for environmental damage as a result of
hydrocarbon operations or whether TULAS Tables 2 or 3 provide
additional remediation criteria that should be applied

460. The Parties and their experts diverged on whether the proper regulatory criteria to be
applied were confined to the contaminants listed in Table 6, Annex 2, of RAOHE or whether
they also included the contaminants listed in Tables 2 or 3 of Annex 2, Book VI of TULAS.°”°

461. Perenco and GSI proceeded on the basis that Table 6, Annex 2, of RAOHE provided the
sum total of what should be tested for in the case of remediation of soil contamination resulting
from hydrocarbon operations. Ecuador and IEMS, in formulating the alternative regulatory case,
disagreed. In preparing its alternative case, IEMS measured its sampling results against the
standards stipulated by RAOHE and, it submitted, where applicable, TULAS Table 2. In its first
expert report, IEMS identified the parameters it had tested for as TPH, polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons, nickel, cadmium, lead, barium and vanadium.°”! Barium and vanadium are not
elements regulated by RAOHE Table 6, but they are listed in Tables 2 and 3, Annex 2 of Book
VI of TULAS.°”?

462. By the time of its second expert report, IEMS added chromium, potential hydrogen (pH)
and electrical conductivity to its list of elements.°?? These elements are similarly governed only
by Tables 2 and 3, Annex 2 of Book VI of TULAS. In its third expert report, IEMS excluded
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and chromium because it stated they had not been identified in
their field sampling at “concentrations greater than the regulatory reference criteria.”°** Thus, in
addition to the RAOHE, Table 6 elements, IEMS continued to apply Table 2, Annex 2 of Book
VI of TULAS to two remaining elements: barium and vanadium.°”

463. Ecuador contended that Ecuadorian law requires TULAS to be applied to the analysis of
soil (and groundwater) remediation.*”° In its view, TULAS addressed chemical indicators and

heavy metals associated with hydrocarbon operations that are not considered in RAOHE, namely
electrical conductivity, pH, barium and vanadium.?””

464. Perenco’s response was that TULAS was intended to generally govern activities that may
cause an impact on the environment, but that the legal regime in Ecuador operated such that as
regards activities that were more likely to require environmental authorisations and had a greater
potential of impact on the environment, specific regulation is promulgated in accordance with the
technical standards established in TULAS. This was the case with hydrocarbon operations.
Moreover, it was Table 3, not Table 2, of Annex 2 of Book VI of TULAS that stood to provide
any additional contaminant criteria for the identification and remediation of contaminated soil.°*

465. The Tribunal begins with a consideration of TULAS’s objective, as articulated in the
opening section to Annex 2 (which contains Tables 2 and 3). Its purpose is to provide general
technical standards, as authorised by two other instruments of general application: the
Environmental Management Act and the Regulations to the Environmental Management Act for
the Prevention and Control of Environmental Pollution. These standards are to be used to
“determine or set” the “rules of general application for different soil uses” across a range of
industries and activities.’ Its reach insofar as the industries and activities it governs is
concerned is limited only by whether they require environmental authorisations in connection
with their activities. The technical standards are intended for use by the State and its agencies in
its administration of powers or actions to “preserve, conserve or recover the quality of soil
resources.” !° In other words, in administering the rules that govern areas of industry or activity
that affect the environment, the onus is on the competent authority to ensure that it acts
consistently with TULAS.

466. In the Tribunal’s view, it is Table 3, rather than Table 2, of Annex 2 of Book VI of
TULAS that addresses the identification and remediation of contaminated soil. As noted above,
Table 3 accepts that there is an activity that may affect the environment and reflects the balance
that has been struck by the regulator between activity and a tolerable impact on the environment.

Notably, unlike Table 2, Table 3 offers separate criteria according to four different land-use
classifications: agricultural, residential, commercial and industrial.

467. By contrast, Table 2, entitled “Soil Quality Standards”, sets out non-site specific
standards for the background values of 36 different elements that may be present in soil. Article
4.2.1 explains that Table 2 sets out background values or analytical detection limits that reflect
the “natural geological variations of undeveloped or areas free of the influence of generalized
industrial or urban activities.”!°°'! The definition of “[b]aseline (background)” in TULAS
(Article 2.38) refers to “conditions which prevailed in the absence of anthropogenic activities,
only natural processes in activity.”!°°* Table 3 is titled “Soil Remediation or Restoration
Criteria” and its opening paragraph defines it as “[t]he Remediation or Restoration criteria are
established in accordance with the use of soil”, said to comprise the “maximum contaminant
concentration levels for of soil in the process of remediation or restoration.” !°°

468. The Tribunal considers that there has been a conscious and intentional demarcation
between baseline values and contamination limits in Tables 2 and 3 of Annex 2 of Book VI of
TULAS. It would be counterintuitive to ignore the fact that Table 3 expressly describes itself as
stipulating the criteria for the remediation and restoration of soil and to proceed on the basis that
while Table 2 is used to identify whether a site should be remediated, Table 3 provides the limits
that should be observed by the party remediating the site such that the remediation should bring
the concentration of contaminants to below those limits. Moreover, similar to RAOHE, Table 6,
Table 3 offers criteria which are specific to land-uses such that, for example, in the case of land
that is put to residential use, its limits of permitted disturbances are lower than those stipulated
for industrial land. !°

469. With this in mind, the Tribunal turns to consider the issue of the relationship between
Table 6, Annex 2 of RAOHE and Table 3 of Annex 2, Book VI of TULAS.

470. The Tribunal is conscious of the imperative in Ecuadorian constitutional law to proceed
in a manner most protective of the environment, and considers that to exclude TULAS’s
treatment of soil contamination and remediation entirely would undermine this goal and it would
contradict the objective and purpose of Annex 2 of Book VI of TULAS. Moreover, it notes that

TEMS and Ecuador’s approach in this arbitration has not been to advocate testing for every single
contaminant listed in Table 3, but rather to home in on barium and vanadium in addition to the
contaminants in RAOHE, Annex 2, Table 6, because they are elements that they contend can be
found in the by-products of the hydrocarbon exploitation process. !°°> Perenco, for its part, has in
its experts’ selection of “indicator parameters” included barium as an indicator of the effect of
hydrocarbon operations in soil.!°°° Barium, as noted before, is not a parameter that is addressed
in RAOHE, Annex 2, Table 6. That would suggest that Perenco accepts that there may be a need
to look outside of RAOHE, Annex 2, Table 6, for permissible values.

471. The Tribunal considers that this is a reasonable approach to adopt and further notes that
TULAS was included in the 2002 and 2008 audits of Blocks 7 and 21, though not consistently
with regard to the analysis of soil contamination.!”” It finds it pertinent, in particular, to note a
conclusion in the 2008 audit of Block 7 conducted by Ecuambiente that TULAS had “not been
taken into account in PERENCO’s environmental management. While the RAOHE does
describe applicable criteria for the hydrocarbon industry, it does not contain all of the
requirements PERENCO must observe.” !°°8

472. The Tribunal makes this finding of TULAS’s applicability to certain substances that
might be associated with oilfield contamination mindful that an examination of the
environmental audits and assessments performed from 1999 to 2010 seems to show inconsistent
treatment of choice of regulatory criteria. RAOHE Table 6 is a constant for soil contamination,
but otherwise with respect to whether Table 2, Table 3 or Table 5 of Annex 2, Book VI of
TULAS should be applied, it is difficult to pinpoint a consistent practice. For example, the May
2010 assessment done by ENTRIX, as commissioned by Petramazonas, refers to Table 3 of
TULAS for water quality (when the table is entitled soil remediation).!° In principle, the
Tribunal considers it appropriate to consult TULAS where RAOHE is silent.

(1.1) Conclusion on whether RAOHE Annex 2, Table 6 represents
the comprehensive list of contaminants or whether TULAS Tables
2 or 3 provide additional remediation criteria that should be
applied

473. In the Tribunal’s view, Table 6, Annex 2 of RAOHE applies to the identification and
remediation of contaminated soil, but to the extent that it is silent, for example, on two soil
contaminants, barium and vanadium, at issue in this case, TULAS Book VI, Annex 2, Table 3,
applies. Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that it is permissible to look at TULAS, Book VI,
Annex 2, Table 3 for those substances that may be generated in hydrocarbon operations that are
not addressed in RAOHE, Annex 2, Table 6.

(2) The use of “indicator parameters”

474. Another area in which the experts diverged on how to apply the regulatory criteria was
with respect to GSI’s use of “indicator parameters” to screen its sampling results and, in its
submission, isolate results that depicted contaminants associated with hydrocarbon operations as
opposed to those that more likely resulted from other activities in the Blocks or in their vicinity.

475. One of the first steps in GSI’s investigation was to combine its sampling results and those
collected by IEMS in its first two expert reports in this arbitration. In reviewing IEMS’ sampling
results, and based on its view of what sort of pollutants might be generated in the Blocks, GSI
employed what it termed were the “primary indicators of oilfield materials”; namely, TPH,!°!°
barium, electrical conductance or chloride. !°!! It excluded samples that did not exhibit at least
one of these ‘primary indicators’: “[t]he presence of other chemicals in the soil, in the absence of
a primary indicator (e.g., nickel in the absence of elevated barium or TPH), cannot be caused by
an oilfield material and was therefore not retained for further investigation.”!°'* GSI submitted
that this was tied to the three primary sources of potential environmental effects produced in the
process of extracting oil: use and disposal of drilling mud (barium), extraction of crude oil
(TPH), and production of formation water (soil electrical conductance).'°'? As a result, it
concluded that 91% of the 1243 soil samples collected by IEMS did not evidence “soil impact by
oilfield materials.” !0!4

476. IEMS responded that this approach was contrary to Ecuadorian regulations and rendered
meaningless key elements of RAOHE Table 6 and TULAS (irrespective of whether Table 2 or
Table 3 applied). RPS concurred, contending that GSI’s approach resulted in excluding all heavy
metal contamination found in Blocks 7 and 21, rendering Ecuadorian regulations which
specifically identified and regulated heavy metals “wholly pointless.” !°'5

477. Ecuador’s experts further submitted that GSI’s position was contradicted by Perenco’s
own prior practice, as evidenced in an ‘Environmental Protection Guide’ it had developed during
the course of its operatorship in which it listed a total of 16 indicators that should be monitored.
This list included TPH, barium, cadmium, chromium, lead, and polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons, and was not conditioned on whether they presented themselves in association with
hydrocarbon, barium or any other indicator substance. !°!

478. RPS was particularly critical of GSI’s decision to use indicator parameters, which RPS
considered unduly narrowed the scope of GSI’s investigation. RPS noted that while GSI had

TPH or Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons refers to hydrocarbon compounds derived from petroleum. It can be
used to detect the presence of test crude, which is crude used to determine the well’s production capacity and the
quality of the oil at the start of the drilling process of a well. GSI ER I, paragraphs 36, 225; Claimant’s Counter-
Memorial, paragraph 76.

ton GSI ER I, section 2.4.3, paragraphs 36-38. It defined indicator parameters as “chemicals or groups of
chemicals that are present at significant concentrations in the source material and are readily detectable by field or
laboratory analysis.”; see Claimant’s Counter-Memorial, paragraph 60.

stated that its objective was to “provide an objective evaluation of the work conducted by IEMS
and, at the same time, achieve a comprehensive assessment of current environmental conditions
for each of the 74 oilfield facilities investigated by IEMS in the CPUF, Block 7 and Block
217'°!7, it conducted visual site inspections at only 58 of the 74 oilfield facilities investigated by
TEMS and then actually investigated only 24 of the 74 facilities with the collection and analysis
of soil and/or groundwater samples.

479. When it came to analysing the majority of such samples, GSI used the short list of
indicator parameters. This, in RPS’s view, “severely limits their ability to understand the full
nature of impacts from historical oilfield operations and can accordingly lead to certain
contaminants not being detected contrary to GSI’s stated objective of achieving a comprehensive
assessment of the environmental conditions” in the Blocks. '°!8

480. RPS devoted four pages of its report to a discussion of indicator parameters’ potential for
generating a misleading picture of the Blocks’ environmental conditions. In its view, GSI
performed a subset of soil sampling which it described as “risk characterization” samples, the
stated objective in using such samples being “to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the
potential risks posed to human health.”!°!? Whereas 333 “confirmation and delineation” soil
samples were tested only for the following analytes: Gasoline Range Organics, Diesel Range
Organics, Oil Range Organics, Barium, Cadmium, Chromium, Lead, and Nickel, only 57 “risk
characterization” soil samples were tested for the foregoing and an additional 49 other potential
contaminants. !07°

481. GSI defended its use of indicator parameters as follows:

The validity of the “primary indicator approach” is illustrated by the fact
that, among the 3,561 soil samples collected and analyzed by GSI,
Walsh, and IEMS, only 39 soil samples (1%) exceeded a regulatory
criterion for a non-indicator parameter (i.e., cadmium, chromium, lead,
vanadium, and nickel) outside of an area otherwise designated for
remediation of primary indicators (i.e., barium or TPH) and outside the
paved platform area. Of the total 249 soil samples exceeding an
applicable regulatory criterion outside the paved platform area, the
primary indicator compounds (210 samples) represent 84% of the total
exceedances, while the non-indicator compounds (39 samples) represent
only 16% of the total exceedances. Consequently, for these oilfield sites,
the primary indicators are clearly effective for identification of impacts,
while the other nonindicator chemicals generally serve as additional
criteria to be applied for remediation within the impacted areas. '*!

482. GSI’s defence has not assuaged the Tribunal’s doubts about its use of indicator
parameters. The Tribunal was particularly struck by RPS’s assertion that less than 15% of GSI’s
soil samples were analysed for the full set of individual contaminants that are associated with the

1017 RPS ER III, p 2 quoting from GSI ER I, p 1.

018 RPS ER III, p 5.

019 GSI ER I, pp 70-72, 107-108.

impact of oil field operations on the environment.'°” Given the narrowness of the samples’
testing, RPS concluded that GSI’s conclusion that, “at no location do environmental conditions
pose a risk to human health, nor are their impacts to groundwater resources at any investigated
site” could not be reasonably made: “GSI’s reliance upon indicator parameters that exclude
chemical compounds harmful to human health for the majority of the soil samples it collected
(greater than 85%) prevents them from being able to support their claim of no risk to human
health.”

483. The Tribunal is not persuaded that using indicator parameters was the correct way to
proceed. Neither RAOHE nor TULAS refer to soil sampling and analysis that screens its results
based on whether it presents a particular permutation or combination of elements. RAOHE,
Annex 2, Table 6, which in Perenco’s own submission is the regulation specific to the testing for
soil contamination that occurs as a result of and in the process of exploiting hydrocarbons,
reflects a prior determination by the Ecuadorian authorities of the kinds of elements in the soil
that should be tested for as likely to be attributable to hydrocarbon activities. It is an act of
regulatory power and discretion that would be undermined by restricting sample testing to
“indicator parameters.” The Tribunal is also mindful of RPS’s examples, such as an area near
Payamino 1, which GSI had identified as exhibiting “oil residue associated with a former
produced water surface impoundment” but which it then excluded on the basis that samples from
the site did not indicate any environmental harm based on electrical conductance (one of its
“indicator parameters”). !0°+

484. Finally, the Tribunal agrees with IEMS and RPS that GSI’s use of “indicator parameters”
is inconsistent with Perenco’s own environmental audits, assessments and reports in relation to
Blocks 7 and 21. The 2002 audit that was carried out relatively soon after Perenco took over the
Blocks does not refer to “indicator parameters”; it tested for the full list of contaminants in
RAOHE, Annex 2, Table 6.!°5 Similarly, in the 2008 audit, on which Perenco placed
considerable emphasis in these proceedings, the samples were tested against each parameter in
RAOHE, Annex 2, Table 6.!°76

(2.1) Conclusion on the use of indicator parameters

485. In sum, the Tribunal finds that Ecuadorian regulation does not dictate the use of
“indicator parameters” and using such parameters has the potential to unduly narrow the
sampling tests with the likely result being that fewer instances of contamination are yielded. The
Tribunal is also mindful of Ecuador’s view that it does not have a sufficient level of confidence
as to a comprehensive list of what chemicals were used by Perenco throughout its

122s RPS ER III, p16.

operatorship.!°”” If that is the case, the argument for dismissing the use of “indicator parameters”
is perforce stronger.

(3) Land-use classification

486. Another major point of difference between the Parties, once that the “background values”
case is put to one side and the focus is on the regulatory regime, concerns the choice of land-use
classifications applicable to different locations within the Blocks. Ecuador asserted that more
than 50% of what it considers to be the contaminated area falls within the Amazonian rainforest
and therefore in its view qualifies under the sensitive ecosystem land-use criterion.'°?* Perenco
disagrees. !

487. Ecuador submitted that amongst its different land-use criteria, it was the “sensitive
ecosystems” criteria that should be applied to the Blocks in light of their location in the
Ecuadorian Amazon and the 2008 Constitution’s emphasis on full restoration and protection of
the environment.!°*° Moreover, it submitted that Table 6 of RAOHE referred to “posterior use”
which, in its view, was meant to facilitate site re-use and should be interpreted to refer to the
future land use to which the site will reasonably be put.!°7!

488. IEMS criticised GSI’s approach because, in its view, it should have applied the stricter
standards prescribed by RAOHE for a “sensitive ecosystem” rather than the more relaxed
industrial and agricultural area standards.'°* It contended that while the Blocks were not a
designated protected area under Ecuadorian law, its ecological studies confirmed that most areas
displayed characteristics “similar to those of a National Natural Area.” !>

489. GSI, for its part, asserted that IEMS had mischaracterised the applicable land-use criteria
and as a result this had invalidated two-thirds of its samples, accounting for over US$ 885
million of its US$ 2.4 billion claim.'°** GSI applied sensitive ecosystems criteria to “the small
amount of land that f[ell] within a designated protected area”, correlating to 89 of IEMS’ 1243
sampling locations.!'°*> It otherwise applied agricultural or industrial land-use criteria in its
analysis. !°°°

1027 Ecuador noted in its Post-Hearing Brief, paragraph 66, that: “Perenco further failed to provide evidence that

the presence of such contaminants did not result from oilfield operations and refused to disclose the list of chemicals
it used in these operations [Procedural Order No. 4, Request 9].” Perenco did not reply to this particular allegation in
its Reply Post-Hearing Brief.

of its operations in Blocks 7 and 21 would result in the classification of the land-use as industrial (Claimant’s

 

152

490. In the Tribunal’s view, a number of factors bear upon this issue. First, the 2008
Constitution’s imperative in favour of the protection of the environment should, in any case of
doubt, militate in favour of applying the most stringent land-use designation. But this does not
mean that an area that has clearly become an industrial or agricultural area and is reasonably
expected to remain as such for the foreseeable future should be re-designated as a sensitive
ecosystem, particularly where oilfield operations continue to be conducted. The Tribunal
recognises that the posterior use of the land is the central concern, but there is the practical
consideration that the Blocks are expected to be operated for many years to come and that it
would be unjust to require Perenco to bear the cost of restoration for land and platforms that are
now being used by Petroamazonas and are still distant from any “posterior use.”

491. Second, and related to the first point, the Tribunal considers that the treatment of this
issue should be guided by the Ecuadorian authorities’ practice in relation to the Blocks. The
evidence shows that the authorities accepted the application of industrial land-use criteria in
certain parts of Blocks 7 and 21, in particular, in the January 2003 Remediation Plan relating to
the Payamino Sanitary Landfill, Payamino 22, Payamino CPF, Coca CPF and Jaguar CPF as
approved by the Ministry,'*’ the report of a clean-up of a spill at Payamino 19 in June 2009,!0
the Consortium’s EIS for the construction of the Oso A and Oso B platforms and the Yuralpa
Norte platform in April and October 2006,'°*? and, most significantly, in the environmental

impact studies commissioned by Ecuador in 2010.!°#°

 

492. Ecuadorian authorities similarly accepted the application of agricultural land-use criteria
in areas surrounding platforms in Blocks 7 and 21 such as in the Ministry-approved remediation
plan for the May 2007 spill from the Oso 2 flow line,!™*! the January 2008 Ministry-approved
remediation plan for a spill in the Gacela-Payamino flow line in October 2007,'°? and in the

 

Counter-Memorial, paragraph 289). Examples of practice of Ecuadorian authorities applying industrial criteria at

environmental impact studies commissioned by Ecuador in 2010.'°% In the present proceeding,
IEMS itself accepted that the areas surrounding Coca 6, Coca 8, Lobo 3, Lobo 1, Oso 9, Mono
CPF, and Payamino CPF were primarily used for agricultural purposes. !°+

493. This is not to say that, once selected, the land-use criteria are irrevocable and the decision
cannot be changed. However, there is significant probative value to be derived from the
authorities’ acceptance of a particular land-use criterion with respect to the same area for the
purpose of measuring soil remediation.

494. It is also clear to the Tribunal that the sensitive ecosystem designation is not limited to
designated protected zones. RAOHE makes clear that the designation applies in areas “‘such as
the National Heritage of Natural Areas! and others identified in the corresponding
Environmental Study.”!°!° GSI’s initial approach was to restrict the use of the sensitive
ecosystem criterion to those areas alone.!°47 The Tribunal notes that GSI itself accepted that the
“sensitive ecosystems criteria” might apply to a number of sites in the Blocks which intersected
with State-designated sensitive ecosystem areas: Payamino CPF, Payamino 1, Payamino 2-8,
Payamino 19, Waponi-Ocatoe and Nemoca.!™°

(3.1) Conclusion on land-use criteria

495. The Tribunal concludes that that in view of the 2008 Constitution’s imperative in favour
of the protection of the environment, in any case of doubt where a site could be considered to fall
under either of two designations, the more stringent land-use designation should be applied. In
the Tribunal’s view, where a posterior land use has not been designated, Article 395.4 of the
2008 Constitution’s focus on full restoration should guide in determining the appropriate land
use and it should be in favour of the most environmentally-protective designation that is
reasonable in the circumstances of the particular case. At the same time, the prior determinations
of the Ecuadorian authorities have significant probative value.

496. For present purposes, the Tribunal reserves its position on the posterior land use question
with respect to any oil well or drilling platform (or other installation) that was retired during
Perenco’s operatorship. This is discussed in further detail below.

(4) The approach to the testing and evaluation of mud pits

497. The investigation of mud pits was fraught with a number of divisive issues. The first
issue was whether to exclude soil samples that were taken from inside closed mud pits when
measuring soil contamination in the Blocks. The second issue, which bears some relation to the
first, is whether the leachate testing method should be used and, in that connection, whether the

appropriate regulatory criteria to be applied are found in Table 7 of Annex 2 of RAOHE (GSI’s
approach) which governs leachates, rather than Table 6 of Annex 2 of RAOHE (IEMS’
approach) which governs soil contamination generally. The third issue is the approach to
determining whether Table 7(a), which provides the regulatory limits for pits that are not bottom
sealed, or Table 7(b), which provides more generous regulatory limits for sealed pits, is more
properly applied in a specific instance. !°?

498. The issue is an important one because mud pits can constitute an important transport
mechanism for groundwater contamination.'!° In its expert report, RPS included a schematic
drawing that illustrates the potential problem.

1049 Generally, see above at paragraphs 90, 255-257, 274-277.

1050 RPS in its third expert report criticised GSI for what it considered to be a generally inadequate treatment of
exposure pathways of contaminants. In specific regard to mud pits, RPS noted: “Indications that migration of
chemicals of concern from primary sources (e.g., mud pits) to surface soil, subsurface soil, groundwater and surface
water at the CPUF, Block 7, and Block 21 sites are of concern include 1) historical spills, 2) TCLP Test Results
obtained by GSI indicating the potential for migration of chemicals from closed mud pits, 3) detection of TPH and
inorganic chemicals in groundwater adjacent to mud pits and other waste management units, and 4) reported
contamination of water supplies in these areas (IEMS Expert Report). There are examples where primary sources
and contamination (secondary sources) are located adjacent to drainage areas, creeks, streams, swamps and other
surface waters, with the potential for migration of chemicals to surface water and sediments and to adjacent land.”
RPS ER III, p 63. To this, GSI responded, in its second expert report, paragraph 155, that: “We do not agree that a
more extensive list of chemical analyses or a more complex analysis of potential future exposure pathways is
necessary to determine whether current site conditions pose an unsafe risk to human health or livestock. IEMS and
RPS have presented their criticisms of the GSI risk assessment, but they have not conducted their own risk
assessment nor have they found that current conditions at the oilfield facilities actually pose an unsafe risk.” The
Tribunal did not find this persuasive. RPS was retained to review and critique GSI’s analysis and it was GSI that
described its exposure pathways analysis in its first report (pp 4, 107-108, Appendix E) and concluded that soil
exposure was the only such pathway. IEMS’ report was predicated upon a different mode of mapping
contaimination and it appears to the Tribunal that this reduced the perceived need to develop an exposure pathways
analysis.

   

 

155

499. The Tribunal considers that it must follow the practice in Ecuador on this important issue.
It notes that the disposal of drilling muds and cuttings in Ecuador has both before and since the
2008 Constitution been effected through the construction of in situ mud pits. It has not been
directed to any evidence showing that at the end of operations of a particular platform, the
operator has been required to dig up and either completely remediate the dessicated mud and
cuttings in situ or remove that material for off-site remediation or storage. This is not what the
Ecuadorian authorities have required.

500. Although it recognises that Ecuador’s primary case was premised principally on the full
restoration objective, the Tribunal considers that drilling muds and cuttings are properly disposed
of under the current regime if: (i) they are placed in properly constructed and graded pits as
required by law; (ii) the operator properly treated the contents of the pits so as to ensure that it
did not deposit muds and cuttings that contained analytes in quantities in excess of the applicable
regulations; (iii) the pits have been properly covered and closed; and (iv) soil sampling at places
around the pits shows no sign of leaching. !°5!

501. One of the problems faced in this particular aspect of the counterclaim concerns the
uncertainty of the information surrounding the pits’ construction. During the documents
production phase, Perenco was requested to produce documents pertaining to the design and
construction of mud pits.'°°? In its response, Perenco stated that it: “...does not have a specific
written policy for the construction, cleaning, monitoring, testing, and closing of pits.”!°° It did
however advert to Mr. Saltos’ testimony that the company used liners as well as to interview
notes in an annex to IEMS’ third expert report in which certain former employees discussed the
laying down of liners before depositing drilling muds therein.'°* However, reference to the
notes shows that the evidence on the point was mixed and not fully supportive of Perenco’s
position because one former employee stated that undue care was taken in depositing drilling
muds such that the liners cracked under the high termparatures. !°°°

502. The Schedule of Closed Mud Pits attached as Appendix A to the Claimant’s Post-Hearing
Brief on Counterclaims, which was prepared with both Parties’ involvement and for which the
Tribunal is grateful, regrettably shows that there are substantial disagreements as to whether
many pits were lined or unlined. The ‘Master List’ records disagreement in at least 26 of 79
cases; the ‘Pits Constructed by Perenco’ list shows an even higher percentage of disagreement
(14 of 18). The ‘Pits Constructed by Prior Operators’ shows 12 disagreements (of 63 entries) and
many (36) unknowns.

 

1051 In its third expert report, RPS critically reviewed GSI’s mud pits sampling at p 39. It also observed at p 44
that: “... about 50% of the samples [taken by GSI] were collected from cover soils on top of closed mud pits. These
cover soils are expected to be clean and analytical results do not represent potential concentrations in contaminated

media.”

105 As discussed in IEMS 3" Report page 28 (referring to Attachment 17).

503. There also appears to be a disagreement on whether a pit which might have been built in
clay soil is to be considered to be “sealed”; GSI’s Mr. Connor believed so, while IEMS did not.
The Tribunal is not prepared to equate what have been assumed to be impermeable clay-based
pits with those that have been lined within an impermeable synthetic barrier. This would first
require the Tribunal to assume that the bottom of an unlined pit was in fact clay. IEMS adduced
evidence that this was not necessarily the case; in some instances sandy soil is located near the
pits.'°>° During cross-examination, Mr. Connor admitted that, for example, when looking at a
Coca 8 pit, GSI did not do any geotechnical testing and assumed that the bottom of the pit was
lined with clay. !°°7

504. In addition, GSI appears to have assumed that the contents of all pits were cuttings and
water-based muds and that the only key substance of possible concern was barium sulfate.!°°*
This does not appear to have always been the case because there appear to be some pits that
contained oil-based muds.'°? Moreover, the evidence suggests that there are other substances
associated with water-based drilling muds and these were not checked by GSI. During cross-
examination, Mr. Connor was shown a 4 October 2006 inspection report prepared by the
Orellana Department of the Environment which recorded the results of an inspection made after
the complaint of a local landowner, Mr. Alberto Tanguila. The report noted that:

1056 See Ecuador’s Closing Presentation, Slides 111, 112 and 113.
1057 Mr. Connor was cross examined on this point:

“Q. Mr. Connor, have you assumed that all the pits in Blocks 7 and 21 are properly lined? Yes or no?

A. I believe that all the pits in Blocks 7 and 21 have some form of liner, whether it be natural soils or synthetic, and
that would be consistent with the lithology of that region. So, in that regard, I've assumed that they do have either
earthen or synthetic liners...”

He was then asked:

“Q. Now, did you perform any geotechnical studies or tests to actually confirm whether, beneath those pits, you
have clay soil? Yes or no?

A. On the specific locations of the pits, I did not conduct a geotechnical test beneath that pit. I did not.”

(See Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 6, pp 1786-1787 (Testimony of GSI).)

1058 RPS disagreed with this in its third expert report, p 43: “Although barium sulfate ‘is the major component
of drilling muds used for drilling oil and gas wells’ (GSI Expert Report, Section E.3.2, page E-14 [Emphasis of
RPS)), barium sulfate is not the only component of drilling mud and the presence of additional constituents was not
discussed by GSI. Water-based muds contain a number of additives that improve the properties of the mud. For
example asphaltene (also called gilsonite) is listed as a primary additive in drilling muds in Perenco documents and
is considered to be toxic (Entrix 2003, Tabla 3-4, pages 238 and 247; Entrix 2003, Tabla 4.1-2 pg. 4-4; Abrus 2005,
Table 4-5, pages 4-13; and Martrex 2009). Asphaltene is a mixture, consisting primarily of high molecular weight
hydrocarbons, sulfur, and trace amounts of vanadium and nickel. In addition to barium, other metals that are
commonly found in water-based drilling mud are arsenic, chromium, cadmium, copper, mercury, lead, nickel,
vanadium, and zinc; and caustic is added for pH control (Neff 2005, page 12). GSI did not adequately discuss the
chemicals that could be present in drilling mud at the oilfield sites. The initial investigations of contamination
should not be limited to barium sulfate and TPH and should at a minimum include the constituents listed on GSI
Table E.1.”

1059 As Ecuador noted in its Post-Hearing Brief, paragraph 86: “GSI’s testing of pits was limited to taking
leachate samples at 7 sites, none of which included pits known to contain oil-based mud [GSI 1*, Table D.12.A].
But GSI only tested the samples for Table 7B of RAOHE, i-e., the most permissive criteria for lined pits. Had GSI
compared its results against Table 7A (for unlined pits), it would have concluded that three out of seven locations
(i.e., 43%) failed the test. Given the available evidence, including Perenco’s own prior practice (e.g., at Jaguar 9 and
Coca 19 [IEMS 3rd, Attachment 11 and GSI 2nd, Appendix B.3.1]), GSI should have applied Table 7A of
RAOHE.”

157

In one of the sides of the Coca #8 platform, there is a closed pits [sic]
from where crude oil is coming out to the surface, (10:15h) a sample of
superficial soil 0 to 20 cm was taken. (Coor.: X 027-0617 -Y: 995-5102)
... Finally, when the drilling was finished, the tillable layer was moved
from a nearby large extension of agricultural soil, in order to close the
pits that were filled with oil in the pits that contain water were left open
and filled with water. With time, oil has started to come out in the slopes
near the platforms. Before the drilling, the slopes had clear water and the
soil was hard rock, but now has been turned into swamps that cannot be
used. Since at that time, it wasn’t know (sic) that oil could cause
illnesses, we weren’t worried, but we now see that things are different
and that we can’t even find animals for hunting.'°°

505. It may be that this particular pit was closed prior to Perenco’s assuming its operatorship
and therefore Perenco bears no responsibility for it under the then-applicable fault-based regime.
The Tribunal refers to the document simply to underscore the point that the evidence appears to
indicate that some of the mud pits in Blocks 7 and 21 contain more than water-based drilling
muds and cuttings. This point was explored with Mr. Connor during his cross-examination:

Q. Okay. Now, if you go to--if you stay on the first page, do you see that
this is an Inspection Report; correct?

A. Yes, it is.
Q. Dated 4 October 2006; correct?
A. Yes.

Q. And so--I mean, we can understand that this is the same complaint
that IEMS was referring to when it identified the REC relating to Coca 8;
right?

A. It's part of "Consejo Provincial de Orellana."
Q. And it's dated 4 October 2006, which—

A. Is that the same--I don't recall--oh, yes, that was date that was in the
other one. Yes. I would presume it's the same.

Q. Okay. Now, if you look at the last paragraph--or second-to-the-last
paragraph, it says that "On 21 September 2006 at 10:00 a.m., people"—
and you have the people who attended are identified earlier went to Coca
8, and you see at the platform of Coca 8 there is a closed pit from where
crude oil is coming out of the surface, 10:15 a.m. Now, we agree, just so
that there is no confusion, Coca 8--the only closed pits in Coca 8 were to
the south of the platform; correct?

090 Annex E to IEMS ER Il, Inspecting Report No. 06-037, Provincial Council of Orellana, Environment

Department [Emphasis added].

158

A. That's correct.

Q. Okay. So we're talking about a southern pit here. So as of 21
September 2006, there is an inspection reporting that crude oil is coming
out to the surface of a closed pit on Coca 8; correct?

A. That's right. That's what it says here, yes.

Q. And now when you turn the page ...--will get to a page where we
have a table with lab results. So, I'd like you to first look at the paragraph
immediately above that table. And I will try my best for the translation. It
says, "Finally, when the drilling was finished, the clean layer was moved
from a nearby large extension of agricultural soil in order to close the
pits that were filled with oil, and the pits that contained water were left
open and filled with water. With time, oil has started to come out in the
slopes near the platforms. Before the drilling, the slopes had clear water
and the soil was hard rock, but has now been turned into swamps that
cannot be used."

A. Isee that.

Q. Okay. So, all of this is after the drilling was done and the pits were
closed; correct?

A. This record that's been put here by an inspector is after the pits have
been closed.

Q. So, there's at least an indication here that, gee, maybe the pit is
actually leaking; correct?

A. That's what the person says. It's not--I don't think that's consistent
with the true conditions of that pit.

Q. Okay. We're going to see that. Now, as part of your First Expert
Report, you eliminated several RECs that were identified by IEMS,
including all of those relating to pits because you considered that pits
were "accepted and appropriate practices for operations.” Correct?

A. Yes, that's because they are.!°!

506. Having made these observations about general questions arising out of the mud pits, the
Tribunal turns to the applicable standards.

507. Pits without bottom sealing are governed by RAOHE Table 7(a), while sealed pits are
governed by the less stringent RAHOE Table 7(b). The limits of permissible contents differ. For
ease of reference, the Tribunal sets out an image of the translated Table 7, Annex 2, of RAOHE
as provided by Ecuador:

508. GSI excluded from its investigation samples taken by IEMS from within closed pits for
the purpose of determining the existence of soil contamination because their closure was
“specifically authorized and required under applicable Ecuador regulations (Acuerdo 621,
Decree 2982, and RAOHE Decree 1215) and the government-approved Environmental
Management Plans (EMPs) for oilfield operations in the Consortium area.” !°° In its view, IEMS

treated these samples, and by extension the contents of closed pits, which are areas specially
construed to hold the by-products of the drilling process, as if they were regular soil.!0%+
According to Perenco, this represented 22% of the 22,629 samples IEMS collected in its first
sampling campaign. !°°

509. An examination of Tables 6 and 7 of Annex 2 of RAOHE suggests that there was a
deliberate decision by the regulator to separate the treatment of “leachates for the final storage of
surface drilling muds and rubbles” from the treatment more generally of soil that may have been
affected during the course of the hydrocarbon production process. As noted above, a mud-pit is a
specific containment method for these by-products of the drilling process, which tend to take the
form of a combination of drilling muds and formation water which is dried and treated (using
substances such as aluminium sulfate and calcium hydroxide), mixed with solids, and then
compacted and stored in the pits. In this light, it is understandable that RAOHE should treat the
one separately from the other, and would contemplate contaminant levels greater than that
applied more generally to soil which is not as directly affected by the hydrocarbon production
process as a mud pit.

510. The significance of the difference in treatment is confirmed, for example, by the fact that
drilling muds commonly contain heavy metals such as barium, which is addressed in Table 7,
Annex 2, of RAOHE along with chromium and vanadium, but is not identified as a contaminant
of concern in Table 6, Annex 2, of RAOHE. The Tribunal notes that Table 7 of RAOHE in fact
addresses a number of elements that are not addressed in Table 6 of RAOHE: hydrogen,
electrical conductivity, total chromium, vanadium and barium, and in this way it is more
comprehensive in addressing the kinds of chemicals that might be produced in the by-products of
the drilling process and stored in a mud pit.

511. Moreover, RAOHE Table 6 sets out concentrations in mg/kg, compared to Table 7,
which provides concentration limits in mg/1.!°° Again, this reflects the concern with mud pits,
which is not with contaminants in the material contained within the pit because that is a given at
some concentration, but rather with the potential for their contents to leach such contaminants
into surrounding soil and underground water sources in concentrations that pose a threat to the
environment.!°*’ This explains the choice to provide a higher set of permitted substances for
sealed pits in Table 7(b) as opposed to that for unsealed pits. The latter pose a greater risk for
discharges of substances that contain contaminants at environmentally damaging concentrations.

512. The Tribunal has considered and takes into account the evidence of the use of the Table 7
criteria in the investigation of the mud pits in Blocks 7 and 21, whether initiated by the operator
and not objected to by the Ecuadorian authorities when brought to their attention, or by IEMS in
its report in the City Oriente proceedings. The 2002 pit closure report for pits in Payamino 24
describes leachates analysis of samples having regard to Table 7 of RAOHE.'°® They confirmed
that the fluid inside the pits complied with the permissible limits for barium, chromium,

cadmium, vanadium and TPH set forth in Table 7.!° The 2006 and 2008 environmental audits
applied Table 7 of RAOHE.!°”° The 2003 environmental report on specific sites in Block 21
(such as Yuralpa Centro 1 pit) applied Table 7 of RAOHE. '®7!

513. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that some of the evidence of the application of Table 7
of RAOHE to pits in the Blocks is in the form of pit closure reports produced by the operator. As
noted above, one of Ecuador’s objections to the applicability of Table 7, Annex 2, of RAOHE
was its submission that Table 7 applied strictly to the sealing of a pit and to investigate whether it
has been properly sealed (hence, the periodic sampling seven days, three months, and six months
after storage). It was limited to a specific context and period of time.

514. In sum, the Tribunal finds that Ecuador has not made this aspect of its case out. Two
factors militate in favour of the finding that Table 7 remains the applicable regulatory criteria to
testing the environmental compliance of mud pits. The first is that there is no indication in Table
7 that at the six-month mark, some other set of regulatory criteria supersedes Table 7. A review
of the sections and other annexes of RAOHE similarly does not offer a clear and suitable
alternative. Ecuador’s position is that this would be RAOHE, Annex 2, Table 6.'°72 However, as
set out above, the nature of the contaminants that may ‘leach’ from the material compacted and
stored in mud pits has been addressed in Table 7, and it does not appear that the same can be said
for Table 6. In this sense, Table 7 presents the regulatory standard that is more specifically aimed
at the protection of the environment in the case of mud pits.

515. The second point is that Table 7 requires periodic sampling precisely because the effect
of ‘leaching’ presents itself over time and it is concerned with catching the development and
accumulation of seeping substances. To turn the six-month mark into a six-month cut-off would
seem to undercut this imperative. In the absence of a regulatory prescription to apply a different
set of criteria after six months, the Tribunal is of the view that it accords with the purpose of
Table 7 to continue to apply it to determine the regulatory compliance of the mud pits in the
Blocks.

516. As regards the question of the appropriate testing method, the Tribunal considers that this
is addressed in the title and opening paragraphs of RAOHE Table 7. The title refers to
permissible limits for leachates for the “final disposal of drilling muds and cuttings on the
surface”.!°73 It does not state that it prescribes the permissible limits for the content of the
storage of surface drilling muds and rubbles. Its opening paragraph states that “[t]he sampling
shall be performed so as to obtain representative composite samples as a function of total volume
disposed of at the respective site.”'!°’* Thus, any “leachate testing” should take into account this
directive in the regulation and ensure it is representative of the bounds and underlying surface
area of the pit, that is, the area from which leaching may occur.

517. Thus, the Tribunal finds that the appropriate regulatory criteria and leachate testing
methodology that should be applied to the testing of mud pits is contained in Table 7, Annex 2,
of RAOHE.

518. As to the mechanics of sampling for leachates, the Tribunal notes that one of IEMS’
objections to GSI’s approach to testing was its allegedly ‘convenient’ delineation of the size and
bounds of the pits in order to avoid finding contamination. IEMS alleged that GSI presented the
pits as being larger than they actually are so as to give the impression they were not leaking.!°’°
The logic was that leachates were unlikely be detected around the pit if one sampled soil well
away from the pit’s actual perimeter. This is not something that the Tribunal is in a position to
decide at present, but if GSI’s sampling did not occur at a su ently close proximity to the pits,
that would undermine the validity of its findings.

 

  

519. For its part, GSI challenged IEMS for treating closed mud pits, and in particular their
contents, as subject to the criteria and the testing methodology applicable in RAOHE, Annex 2,
Table 6, rather than that which applies to the testing of leachates in RAOHE, Annex 2, Table
7.'°76 As already noted, Ecuador submitted that Table 7 was intended to apply only in the
immediate aftermath of sealing the contents of a pit.'°’” Perenco responded to this assertion that
there was nothing in Table 7 or otherwise in RAOHE that supports such a reading of the
approach under Ecuadorian law.

520. The Tribunal has already disposed of Ecuador’s view that soil samples taken from within
mud pits should be treated as if they were taken from soil from the Blocks’ general terrain that
may or may have been affected by hydrocarbon operations. However, the Tribunal does not see
anything wrong with testing the contents of mud pits to see if the operator deposited substances
that should not have been deposited in them. The contents of such pits will by definition differ
from the surrounding environment. So long as they do not contain substances that should not
have been deposited in the first place, they are properly constructed, and their contents meet the
relevant Ecuadorian standard, mud pits are deemed to be an acceptable by-product of oilfield
operations in Ecuador.

521. Turning to the third and last issue in relation to the investigation of mud pits, as noted
above, Table 7 distinguishes between the criteria that should apply to sealed and unsealed pits.
This refers to whether the bottom of the pit is ‘sealed’, a term that is used in Tables 7(a) and 7(b).
In Perenco’s view, Table 7(b) applied to the pits constructed by it in Blocks 7 and 21.!°78 In
Ecuador’s view, IEMS’ evidence demonstrates that there is “no evidence of intact permeable
liners beneath [the] pits” in Blocks 7 and 21.!°7

522. There is some evidence that the bottoms of some of the pits were not lined or their liners
had seriously deteriorated. '°*° RPS submitted that four of the seven pits that GSI tested should

Ecuador noted in its Post-Hearing Brief (paragraph 92): “The statements from Perenco’s former field
employees in relation to pits are telling. For example, when asked whether pits could be leaking, Perenco’s Block 7
Maintenance Supervisor and Superintendent (Marco Ramirez) explained that “(t/he lyner (sic) lacked maintenance.
Cracked by the high temperatures of formation water and [was] damaged by the chemical products [...] The lyner

1079

more properly be subjected to Table 7(a) limits and it raised instances where the operator applied
Table 7(a) limits of its own volition rather than Table 7(b) in pit closure procedures, such as in
Jaguar 9 in November 2000 and in Coca 19 in October 2004 (when Perenco was operator).!°*!
RPS also noted that the TCLP analyses of materials buried at certain closed pits that GSI tested
“show concentrations of barium above the applicable standards for pit closure at three of the
seven pits investigated [by GSI]. A fourth pit also fails to meet the applicable closure criteria
based on a soil pH that is out of the allowable range.” !°*

523. On the Tribunal’s instruction, in their post-hearing briefs the Parties attached tables they
had prepared summarising the evidence of their respective experts on each pit and their
observations on whether Table 7(a) or Table 7(b) should more appropriately be applied in
specific instances.'°? It notes pit closure reports on the record which present examples of
Perenco’s use of Table 7(a) with regard to specific pits: Oso 4-5 in November 2004, Coca 19 in
October 2004 and one pit in Jaguar 9 in the 2008 audit.!°*4 There are similarly instances where it
applied Table 7(b): Condor Norte 1 in November 2005, two pits in Yuralpa Pad A closed in June
2003 and May 2004.!°8> The Tribunal notes Perenco’s submission that where Table 7(a) was
applied it does not necessarily denote that the pit was unlined because “Table 7A was at times
used out of an abundance of caution even in cases of pits that were very clearly lined.” !°°

524. Be that as it may, the Tribunal agrees with RPS that GSI’s use of Table 7(b) is
inconsistent with the Consortium’s own practice of applying Table 7(a) in some instances. RPS
submitted that if GSI had applied Table 7(a) limits, it would have concluded that 4 of the 7 pits
that GSI had tested should be remediated.'°*”

525. The Tribunal considers that there is a need to proceed cautiously with respect to the
approach that should be adopted in order to determine whether Table 7(a) or 7(b) should apply in
the analysis of leachate samples. It considers that because of the risk that an unlined pit or a pit
whose lining has deteriorated over time poses to the environment, where there is any doubt as to
whether a pit is sealed, or where there may have been a deterioration of the lining, the more
environmentally protective standard in Table 7(a) should be used.

(4.1) Conclusion on the Mud Pits Issues

526. In light of the above, the Tribunal’s conclusions on the mud-pit issues are as follows:

 

cristalizes [sic] and leaks. The pits never received maintenance [...]” (IEMS 3rd, Attachment 17]. Similarly,
Perenco’s Roads and Platforms Construction Supervisor (César Andrade) explained that prior to construction of pits
“[g]eological and hydrological studies were not performed” [IEMS 3rd, Attachment 17]. Both reported that they
know of people affected by leaks in pits at Coca 4, Payamino 1, Oso A, and Gacela 2. GSI had this information and
yet did not sample any of the pits at these locations.”

(a) Table 7 of Annex 2 of RAOHE provides the applicable technical standard.

(b) Perenco has no obligation to dig up and remediate properly constructed and
confined mud pits whose contents do not exceed the applicable regulatory
standard.

(c) At the same time, it was not improper for IEMS to sample the contents of closed
mud pits to determine whether or not they exceeded the permissible tolerances
contained in Table 7 of Annex 2 of RAOHE or contained substances that should
not have been deposited in the first place. '°**

(d) Drilling muds and cuttings are properly disposed of under the current regime if: (i)
they are placed in proper pits as required by law; (ii) the operator properly treated
the contents of the pits so as to ensure that it did not deposit muds and cuttings
that contained analytes in quantities in excess of the applicable regulations or
other substances that should not have been desposited therein; (iii) the pits have
been properly covered and closed; (iv) such pits are constructed with proper
berms and at grade; and (v) that soil sampling at places around the pits shows no
sign of leaching.

(e) As to whether regard should be had to Table 7(a) or 7(b), if a pit has an
impermeable liner, Table 7(b) applies. Conversely, if there is no impermeable
liner, Table 7(a) applies. The Appendix A to Claimant’s Reply Post-Hearing Brief
on Counterclaims, Schedule of Closed Pits in Blocks 7 and 21 as of 2009, shows
that the Parties continue to have substantial disagreements as to whether or not
certain pits have been closed with impermeable liners. This will be the subject of
further investigation (as to which see below). In any case of doubt, the more
environmentally protective standard set out in Table 7(a) shall be applied.

(5) Groundwater remediation

527. The Parties and their experts were also deeply divided on the matter of testing
groundwater contamination, disagreeing on the applicable regulatory criteria and the proper
testing methods.

528. In addition, the groundwater issue became subsumed in a dispute over certain evidence
beginning with Perenco’s filing with its Rejoinder a statement from Mr. Gilberto Martinez, a
former employee of IEMS who left the company on poor terms.

529. After he left IEMS’ employ on 6 September 2011, Mr. Martinez contacted the Claimant’s
counsel and volunteered to assist Perenco.'*? His witness statement spurred considerable
correspondence and the filing of further evidence leading up the oral hearing.

1088 It has already been determined that it is not relevant to the disposition of this claim to test the content of

mud pits against background values (see above at paragraphs 292-323).

089 Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 7, pp 2044-2045 (Testimony of Gilberto Martinez). Mr.
Martinez initially stated that he submitted his resumé to Debevoise & Plimpton “when I had just left the company,
TEMS.” He then amended his answer. “Q. But, sir, you have just told me that you submitted that CV to Debevoise as
soon as you left IEMS; isn’t that the case? A. Well, it wasn’t the following day. It was a few months after that.”
Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 7, p 2046 (Testimony of Gilberto Martinez).

  

165

530. Mr. Martinez testified that he worked on the Ecuador project starting with a visit from 25
October to 26 November 2010. He led one of IEMS’ sampling brigades which collected soil,
surface water and groundwater samples.!° He also interviewed local inhabitants about any
environmental problems, met with Environment Ministry officials who informed IEMS about
potential contamination, and directed his brigade to sample in locations where they thought they
might find environmental harm.!°°! Mr. Martinez testified that when he arrived in the oilfields,
he “immediately noticed that the fields were in good shape” and “in comparison to other fields
that I have visited, Blocks 7 and 21 looked clean and healthy to me.” !092

531. Mr. Martinez visited Ecuador again, this time from 1 to 22 August 2011 to resample
certain areas based on the first field campaign’s results. He asserted that he was demoted for the
second visit because he had told his supervisors that he disagreed with the way in which samples
were being taken. Rather than running a brigade, his role was to take data on the physical
characteristics of the soil, i.e., colour, smell, texture, grain size, moisture and presence of
hydrocarbon per sample and depth. !°

532. He described IEMS’ work as “being conducted in a rushed and chaotic way” and beyond
TEMS’ capacity. He said that he became increasingly concerned about the company’s motives
and alleged that management seemed to be making obtaining favourable results more important
than maintaining integrity and professionalism. He claimed that IEMS’ Mr. Rubén Villanueva
said that they would be rewarded with a trip to the Galapagos Islands and to good restaurants in
Quito “for our good work, provided we reach the goal” of finding pollution. In Coca, at an
IEMS-only meeting, Mr. Villanueva was alleged to have called José Francisco Alfaro, Eric
Torres and Gilberto Martinez and to have told them that “IEMS had to continue receiving this
type of assignment from Ecuador” and further that “the main objective of the Blocks 7 and 21
project was to find — at all costs — hydrocarbons in the soil, surface water and groundwater.” !°%

533. Mr. Martinez said that they were instructed to take samples from mud pits and to treat the
area as if it was normal soil, which “seemed absurd” to him. 1095 He added that IEMS “did not use
proper equipment or procedures for sampling groundwater” and that groundwater monitoring
wells were installed using a hand-threaded pipe rather than a machine-threaded pipe which
would have prevented the clogging of filters. He said that his recommendation to use machine-
threaded pipes was ignored. He added that because of the defective way in which the monitoring
wells were put together, they did not capture any groundwater and came out dry and this led to
the “rather astonishing practice”, which he said one of his colleagues told him about, whereby
IEMS employees poured river water into the pipes to take the sample. He said that he saw this
with his own eyes during his second visit and considered this to be a “scandalous breach of the
sampling protocol” which he reported to Mr. Alfaro who, he said, told him that if he wanted to
keep his job he should not ask questions or make such comments. °°

534. Mr. Martinez also described IEMS’ failure to take the necessary steps to adequately
define areas of contamination and its errors in analysing laboratory results. He said that he
proposed that they follow ASTM protocols for sampling in order to be impartial and to avoid any
possible problems for the company or future complaints about its integrity, but that Mr.
Villanueva explained “that the purpose of the project was to find contamination so that the
operator would lose its case against Ecuador.” He recounted Mr. Villanueva’s saying that “that
was why IEMS was hired and why I should not ask questions.” !7

535. These were serious allegations and called for a response. Ecuador was granted leave to
file responsive evidence. IEMS therefore filed a “Supplemental Expert Report” (which also
responded to Dr. Rouhani’s report also filed with the Rejoinder). The Report described Mr.
Martinez’s account of his work with the company as “for the most part fictitious”, described him
as an “unreliable employee” who “engaged in unacceptable conduct” which led to his
dismissal.! It cited an 8 August 2011 email of complaint from Mr. Villanueva. Mr. Martinez
was said to have habitually arrived late at work, “often in an unsuitable state” and to have slept
on the job whilst in Ecuador.!°°? IEMS added that whilst the second sampling campaign was
underway in August 2011 it was decided to terminate his employment. He was so informed upon
his return to Mexico. He refused to accept the sum fixed by the company for a justified
termination. A settlement was concluded on 6 September 2011.'! TEMS asserted that his
account of his leaving the company was “wholly fabricated.”!!°!

536. According to IEMS, Mr. Martinez never mentioned any of the preoccupations contained
in his witness statement and any claims to the contrary were false. IEMS denied that its
instructions were to find evidence of contamination at all costs. The alleged promise of a trip to
the Galapagos Islands if contamination was found was a “particularly absurd fabrication.”!!°?
The allegations concerning the use of certain equipment were incorrect. In particular, the
allegation that water was poured into the monitoring wells to pass it off as groundwater samples
was “mendacious” and was never approved.''!> The problem of dry wells was solved not by
pouring water into the wells, but rather by “digging deeper, as shown by the email
correspondence with Gilberto Martinez himself.”!!°

1103 IEMS ER IV, p 7. This last point was said to have been corroborated by Mr. Mauricio Naranjo, a local
professional who coordinated a group of local experts, some of whom participated in groundwater sampling. IEMS
filed in this regard an email from Mr. Naranjo, the Ecuadorian contractor who d IEMS in the groundwater
sampling campaign, to Mr. Alfaro, who said that with respect to: “...the water samples from the monitoring wells, I
must tell you that neither the workers not my personnel have mentioned that samples were taken from the river.
However, they have been monitoring wells that were placed near the watercourses and in the flood zones, which
were lost because it was impossible to sample them, making it necessary to drill more wells, and in some cases the
well was lost.” Exhibit E-354, Email dated 9 August 2013 from Mauricio Fernando Naranjo Viscarra to José

the August 2011 campaign showing that this was a topic of discussion between them.).

537. TEMS questioned how Mr. Martinez would be in a position to be able to “immediately”
determine whether an oilfield was “in good shape” or whether it looked “clean and healthy”
because the verification and characterisation of contamination “cannot be done without a careful
process of sampling and laboratory analysis.”!'°> His experience was “at best, extremely
limited”; he had joined the company from university and “he had never worked on an oilfield
before. In all probability, the first time he ever visited one was in Ecuador.” !!°

538. Finally, IEMS considered it strange to be criticised for employing the background values
criteria when the instruction to do so came from counsel. In any case, Mr. Martinez had already
left IEMS before its second expert report (in which background values were applied) was
presented. TEMS also recalled that Mr. Martinez had specifically suggested applying the
“sensitive ecosystem” criteria since most of the area belonged to the Amazonian forest. !!”

539. The more serious issue from the Tribunal’s perspective stemmed from the fact that
TEMS’ response to Mr. Martinez’s statement also included the filing of documents which
Perenco’s experts assert were manipulated.

540. The first such document was a Confidentiality Agreement which was said to have been
found in IEMS’ employment records. This prompted an assertion by Perenco that the document
was a forgery.!!°8 Mr. Martinez denied ever signing the document and asserted that his signature
was cut and pasted from his actual employment contract.!!® His evidence that his signature had
been cut and pasted on the Confidentiality Agreement was supported by the expert report of Mr.
Joseph Parker.!!!°

541. TEMS responded with a witness statement from its Material and Human Resources
Administrator, Ms. Laura Diaz de la Garza, who explained what she had done both when Mr.
Martinez had been hired and when she was asked to gather information pertaining to his
employment at IEMS in order to respond to his witness statement. She said that she sent copies of
the confidentiality agreement and code of ethics that comprised Exhibit E-355.!!'' She noted further:

I understand that two electronic files containing Gilberto Martinez’s
confidentiality agreement, one dating from July 2008, and the second one
from July 2009, were found in the draft confidentiality agreement folder,
among the electronic files kept by IEMS. These Word documents show
that Gilberto Martinez’s signature is indeed electronic. I understand that
these documents have been analyzed by an IT expert in order to verify
their date. It is usual for IEMS engineers and technical personnel to use
electronic signatures in the reports sent to clients or various authorities
throughout the Republic, which is why it is possible that Mr. Martinez
proceeded this way when signing his confidentiality agreement.

Unfortunately, I do no keep [sic] emails from 2008 or 2009 in order to
confirm this last statement. '!!?

542. The expert to whom Ms. Diaz referred was Dr. Jean-Louis Courteaud, an expert retained by
Ecuador to respond to the document modification allegations. Dr. Courteaud examined the two Word
documents and concluded that there was no inconsistency in the metadata of the Word
documents. !!!3

543. This did not resolve the problems associated with the electronic documents that IEMS
had produced. Perenco was given access to the electronic files and shortly thereafter filed an
expert report from Mr. Rich Hoffman on the meta-data associated with the signature on the
documents to support the view that those documents had been manipulated as well.'!'+ Mr.
Hoffman observed that although Dr. Courteaud had looked at the metadata associated with the
‘Word documents, he had not looked at the separate metadata associated with the embedded JPG
files. “That metadata shows the creation date and the software used to make or modify the image.
In this case some of the potentially relevant metadata is: Adobe Photoshop elements 8.0
Windows 2013:08:27 10:55:36 CST.”!!'5 This led him to opine that “...the images of the
signatures appearing in the two documents were created very recently, on August 27, 2013. That
is just one day before Mr. Courteaud, according to his letter, accessed these documents.”!!!6 Mr.
Hoffman noted further that “the signatures were created in Adobe Photoshop Elements 8.0. That
version of the software was released on September 23, 2009 — which was 14 months after the
first document’s ‘date last saved’ that appears in the document metadata.” Documents that were
genuinely “last saved” in 2008 and 2009 “cannot include images that were created on software
that did not exist at that time, much less images that were in fact created over four years later in
August 2013 according to the image metadata of the JPG files.”!''” He concluded that the ‘last
saved’ dates that appeared in the metadata that Mr. Courteaud examined were “false.”!!!8

544. At the oral hearing, Dr. Courteaud made a short presentation, but due to Ecuador’s failure
to submit additional expert evidence by 4 September 2013 as contemplated in its correspondence
with the Tribunal, as well as Perenco’s objection to Dr. Courteaud’s introducing new evidence
responsive to Mr. Hoffman’s report based on tests performed on a disc that was delivered to him
prior to the hearing but not disclosed to Perenco, the Tribunal ruled that he could address Mr.
Hoffman’s expert report but could not introduce any new evidence based on more recent studies
of the data.!!°

545. Dr. Courteaud did not take issue with much of Mr. Hoffman’s opinion, but he described
his view as being “more nuanced” as regards the conclusions and the analysis. In view of the

Tibunal’s ruling, he did not elaborate upon the point.'!?° The Tribunal was thus left with a hint of
an explanation from Ecuador’s expert, but no further explication due to its ruling as to the
propriety of adducing new expert evidence on direct examination. There is little more to be said
on this particular point.

546. At the hearing, Ms. Didz denied any involvement in manipulating the documents or
knowing who might have done so.'!?! Her testimony did not rule out the possibility that someone
else did alter the electronic files.!!2? When the IEMS experts testified, each denied having
instructed anyone to alter the documents or otherwise having anything to do with such an act.!!?
Neither they, nor Dr. Courteaud, shed any light on the events leading up to the documents’ use in
this arbitration.

547. The Tribunal’s view is that the weight of the evidence shows that someone at IEMS cut
and pasted the signature on to the Confidentiality Agreement. If this is what was done, it was
unacceptable.

548. The question is what to do about it. It is clear that Ecuador’s counsel had no involvement
in this and were taken by surprise. They have conducted this proceeding in good faith and in a
professional manner and no imputation of wrongdoing can be made against them for having
received documents and submitted them as evidence. The Tribunal is reluctant to find that the
IEMS witnesses who appeared before it and denied any knowledge of the handling of the
electronic files were untruthful. They too seemed confused by this turn of events. But the
Tribunal must record its view that the evidence strongly points in the direction of misconduct by
a person or persons affiliated with IEMS.

549. The question is whether this taints the whole of IEMS’ evidence. The Tribunal considers
that it does not. IEMS has made some important points and it would be unfair to Ecuador to
dismiss the totality of expert evidence prepared over the course of three years on the basis of
what appears to be an unethical act of perhaps a single individual.

550. The Tribunal was invited to find that the evidence as a whole corroborates Mr.
Martinez’s testimony. The Tribunal does not agree. It found him to be a non-responsive witness
who clearly bears a strong animus towards his former employer. He provided details as to the
number of times that he met with counsel and the amount he estimated that he was paid by
Perenco to appear as a witness only when pressed by the Tribunal’s President and even then he
was vague. These aspects of the witness’ demeanour, his seeking out Perenco’s counsel to
provide evidence against his former employer soon after arriving at a settlement with it, and the
animus between him and JEMS leads the Tribunal to treat his evidence with caution.

Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 3, pp 872-875, 877-885 (Testimony of Laura Diaz de la Garza).
Perenco’s Post-Hearing Brief described its view of the situation as follows (at paragraph 92): “Perenco
confronted Ms. Laura Dfaz with the direct question of whether she put the electronic signature on the Word
documents. She timidly answered, “[i]t wasn’t me.” Counsel to Perenco asked Ms. Diaz whether there was ‘anybody
else who knew about the forgery allegation that first arose on August 26, knew that a metadata expert would be
hired and provided with data on August 28, and had access to the computer system’ besides Mr. Alfaro and Mr.
Villanueva, and she conceded: ‘No one else, based on my knowledge.””

1s Counsel properly put the allegations directly to the witnesses; the Tran:
Day 5, pp 1269-1278 (Testimony of IEMS), records their exchanges. Both witnes:
in manipulating the documents or knowing how they might have been altered.

551. Of particular note, while he claimed that Mr. Villanueva told him and two other
colleagues that “the main objective of the Blocks 7 and 21 project was to find — at all cos
hydrocarbons in the soil, surface water and groundwater”, and that he raised his concerns first in
mid-November 2010 and then while the August 2011 sampling campaign was underway, the
contemporaneous email exchanges during the midst of the latter campaign do not corroborate
this. Exhibits E-347 to E-351 contain no evidence of reservations on Mr. Martinez’s part as to
the conduct of the campaign. To the contrary, he was seeking to explain why his team had been
so slow in drilling wells. There is an email from Mr. Villenueva expressing his unhappiness with
the lack of progress, but nothing in it suggests that he was driving the team to act
unprofessionally. Rather, it supports TEMS’ present account of its disillusionment with Mr.
Martinez’s work. In an 8 August 2012 email to Mr. Martinez, Mr. Villenueva noted:

 

“T have just learned that we have not done any wells, and this did not
make me at all happy. According to what I had discussed with you, this
was one of your priorities, I suggest that you establish the leadership that
I expect from someone with your experience, and support the team in
order to perform the work...”.

552. Mr. Martinez replied four days later:

“T thank you for your trust and the expectations placed on me, and please

know that what has been asked of me has been carried out, within my

status of engineer, but not of project director. However, for the success

of this great project (which is one of the most important as you have let

me know earlier), you have 100% of my commitment as a professional

and_as a person, and that is how it has been since my arrival, as my

sampling team is most energetic, and has done the furthest and heaviest

platforms, without diminishing the good work of all my colleagues who

have fought on a daily basis in order for everything to come out well for

the benefit of our company.” !!*4
553. The respectful and complimentary tone and content of this statement, invoking “100%”
of Mr. Martinez’s “commitment as a professional and as a person” was made nine months after
the first campaign (during which time, he testified, he first expressed reservations to his
superiors) and two-thirds through the second campaign. Mr. Martinez now says both campaigns
were marred by intentionally misleading sampling and analyses. But his email to Mr. Villenueva,
written when his time with IEMS was soon to come to an end, stands at odds with Mr.
Martinez’s subsequent account of what Mr. Villanueva had allegedly instructed him to.

 

554. In sum, the Tribunal is not persuaded by Mr. Martinez’s allegations that TEMS
deliberately falsified various findings in its soil and groundwater sampling campaigns.

555. No more need be said of this part of the proceeding other than to record the Tribunal’s
view that it was not a “side show” in the hopeful words of Ecuador’s counsel.!!?> International

arbitration cannot operate effectively without all parties acting in good faith; the duty is owed by
each disputing party to the other and by each party to the Tribunal.!!?°

556. Leaving the Martinez matter to one side, the Tribunal turns to the other differences
between the Parties on the important issue of alleged groundwater contamination. IEMS
collected groundwater samples from 18 sites in the Blocks.!!?7 It reported that all of the samples
collected from these sites exhibited contamination by heavy metals (such as zinc, barium,
copper, chrome, nickel) in concentrations that exceeded the regulatory limits. It compared its
results to values in Table 5, Annex 1, Book VI of TULAS.'!?8 Ecuador submitted that TULAS
obliged the operator to remedy the underground water source (and not just the groundwater in
the immediate vicinity or its run-off) as well as the correspondingly affected soil if contaminants
were found in concentrations above the thresholds in Table 5.!'”°

 

557. GSI criticised IEMS’ sampling methods, asserting that they invalidated its findings. !!°° In
GSI’s view, IEMS’ monitoring wells did not conform to industry standards and IEMS failed to
properly filter its groundwater samples, and as a result it produced values that were
“scientifically impossible.”''*! This included the addition of nitric acid preservative to the
samples in order to stabilise the dissolved metal concentrations prior to testing, which GSI
submitted exponentially elevated the metal concentrations.''*? GSI also criticised IEMS for
evaluating its samples under Table 5, Annex 1, Book VI of TULAS when it should have
employed Annex 5 of RAOHE. As for its own samples, GSI submitted that they had been taken
with proper equipment, using the correct filtration method, and the results showed that they were
fully compliant with applicable regulatory limits.!!*3

558. The Tribunal has found the whole question of filtering to be problematic. On the question
of the applicable technical standards, reference to RAOHE, Article 86, shows that it applies to
the following specific matters:!!*+

559. Perenco views the foregoing as being the only relevant set of standards, while Ecuador
argues that the RAOHE standards are concerned with the hydrocarbon exploitation process and
in respect to evaluating groundwater, TULAS applies.!!?°

560. A review of RAOHE shows that it contains specific instances of the regulatory treatment
of “Aguas” (water) and they are of limited purview to the general question of water quality.
Table 4 of Annex 2 prescribes limits for the discharge of “water and liquid” in the hydrocarbon
production process.'!*° Annex 3 sets out the parameters to be determined in the development of
base studies for the testing of “surface waters.” Table 5 provides the permissible limits for the
discharge of sewage and “grey water.”!'37 Annex 5, as described above and the regulation that
Perenco invokes, is a table with three columns identifying the parameter, method of testing, and
reference material with respect to water.''** It is notable for the manner it chooses not to
prescribe limits. It is more likely that its purpose is to provide the testing method for the
135 Reply, paragraph 166; Rejoinder, paragraph 150. Perenco also argued that if it was wrong in arguing that
RAOHE alone applied, properly tested, the groundwater samples still met TULAS’s standards. Rejoinder, paragraph
151.

parameters identified in other parts of RAOHE that do prescribe limits in the analysis of water,
whether it is water discharged in the production process in Table 4 or grey water in Table 5.

561. In the Tribunal’s view, the particularity of RAOHE’s rules shows that they clearly govern
how an operator must conduct itself in relation to specific matters, for example, discharging
black and grey waters, but TULAS does have a role to play in terms of evaluating the overall
quality of the groundwaters that may be affected by oilfield operations as a whole. With that in
mind, the purpose of Table 5, Annex 1, Book VI of TULAS, which was promulgated two years
after RAOHE came into effect, is more apparent. Unlike RAOHE, TULAS identifies
groundwater contamination as a regulatory concern and proceeds to prescribe the obligation to
remedy contaminated groundwater and the criteria that should be applied in determining whether
this obligation has been triggered.

562. The Tribunal wishes to emphasise that it recognises the concern with the quality and
safety of groundwater in this overarching regulation which, in the words of Perenco’s expert, Dr.
Bed6n, “applie[s] in a general manner to all of those activities that may cause an impact” on the
environment.''? The imperative of environmental protection and restoration in the 1998 and
2008 Constitutions similarly compels giving effect to this regulation. The Tribunal further notes
that Article 4.1.3.6 of TULAS, which introduces Table 5, states that any alteration of the quality
of groundwater triggers an obligation to remedy the “‘subterrdneas contaminadas y el suelo
afectado.”'"*° This would suggest that its objective is to restore the quality of the groundwater
but also to ensure that there is little risk of a resurgence of the problem because of seepage. This,
in the Tribunal’s view, is the most environmentally protective approach to take to a difficult
question of interpretation.

563. Turning to the equally contested issues of groundwater well construction and filtering.
The Tribunal has reservations about both Parties’ approaches to this.

564. On one hand, the Tribunal is concerned that IEMS’ wells may not have been constructed
to ‘best practices’ standards.''*! The variability of IEMS’ sampling results from its various
campaigns raises concerns in the Tribunal’s mind about the reliability of its results and Perenco
has persuasively pointed out both the variability of results and weaknesses in IEMS’ attempts to
explain those variations.''*? It appears that neither set of experts did the requisite field work to
ascertain the clay content at all of the groundwater wells so as to be able to determine whether
TULAS’s Table 5 could be used. ''*

1139 1 Expert Report of René Bed6n, Appendix B, paragraph 5(a).
1140 Exhibit EL-146, TULAS (translation resubmitted on 10-18-2013).

tat On this point, the Tribunal takes note of GSI’s and Mr. Martinez’s comments about the use of machine
rather than hand-threaded pipes.

naz Rejoinder, paragraphs 154-156. Perenco’s Post-hearing Brief (at paragraph 69) commented that “Mr.
Alfaro admitted that IEMS’ most recent results, from January 2013, showed no exceedances at all in the filtered
samples, and only one ‘estimated’ borderline exceedance — about which even IEMS was ‘not certain’ — in the
unfiltered samples. Mr. Alfaro agreed that he could not tell from IEMS’ most recent samples whether there were any
exceedances, and conceded that IEMS ‘haven’t been able to find an explanation’ for either their December 2012 or
their January 2013 results.” [Footnotes omitted.]

14s On the matter of clay content of the soil, IEMS acknowledged that a number of its monitoring wells “may”
be located in areas where the clay content was greater than 25%, but otherwise maintained that TULAS applied to
its gi samples (or, ively, more envii ly protective t values applied). (IEMS III,

 

174

565. On the other hand, the Tribunal has reservations about GSI’s narrowing of testing and
whether that led to underreporting of contaminants. As for its use of filters, if for a particular
type of testing the water is not supposed to be filtered, using field filters could lead to results that
report lower concentrations of contaminants than are actually present in the groundwater. The
Tribunal is mindful in this regard of Ecuador’s point that many local inhabitants in the Blocks
consume surface water or water drawn from shallow wells. A debate about colloidal suspension
skewing test results seems disconnected from reality if the combined effect of consuming
unfiltered groundwater and oilfield-related colloids is to push the combined impact over tolerable
and acceptable levels.''## Even where filtering might be proper, the Tribunal is not entirely
comfortable with GSI’s initially sampling groundwater using a 5 micron filter and then switching
to a much smaller 0.45 micron filter.''*> It is unclear to the Tribunal why GSI chose to switch to
a finer filter and the concern is that employing a 0.45 um filter might have been too restrictive.

566. The sensitivity of the issue is illustrated in the following positions of the Parties. Ecuador
argued that:

“[RPS’] Mr. Crouch also demonstrated how GSI’s use of 0.45 micron
filters was completely inappropriate and biased their groundwater results.
If a filter were to be used (and it should be noted that the local population
does not have special filtration systems to remove contaminants from
their drinking water), the appropriate filter would be much larger than the
ones used by GSI. GSI initially used a 5 micron filter, which was already
excessively small, and later changed it to a 0.45 micron filter
[D5:P1351:L7-P1352:L2]. Hence, while GSI’s own samples taken in the
Mono CPF, for example, with the 5 micron filter showed the presence of
barium concentrations higher than the regulatory standards, when_re-

 

p 77). Perenco criticised IEMS for not conducting this testing (Perenco’s Post-Hearing Brief, paragraphs 64, 68);
Ecuador retorted that GSI itself had not done so either (Ecuador’s Reply Post-hearing Brief, paragraph 46).

tas RPS opined that the use of field filters when collecting groundwater samples for the analysis of metals such
as arsenic, barium and lead can result in analytical results that are biased low and should not be used as a substitute
for proper sampling techniques. The concern is that colloidal-sized particles which may have contaminants absorbed
onto the particles can act as transport contaminants in the groundwater. RPS pointed out that the use of filters of less
than 10 um will remove such mobile colloids down to approximately the pore size of the filter in the observed
contaminants will also be removed from the groundwater samples, “thus producing analytical results that are not
truly representative of groundwater conditions.” (RPS ER III, section 3.4).

14s RPS’s Figure 3-1 in its third expert report (p 24) showed the difference in results as between using a 5 pm
filter as compared to a 0.45 um filter, using, for example, arsenic and barium. GSI argued that some of the
substances for which unfiltered samples are required pertain to substances that do not result from oilfield operations.
(GSI ER II, section 6.3). Likewise, Perenco’s response was that “none of these compound: even associated with
oilfield operations...” (Rejoinder, paragraph 152). But this seems not to accord with the evidence that barium is
associated with such operations. RPS holds a different view (ER II, section 3.4, pp 24-25): “The effect of using the
0.45 micron filter is profound when as g the risk to human health. The concentration report for arsenic dropped
from 0.023 mg/l (collected with a 5.0 micron filter), to being not detected at the detection level of 0.0033 mg/l
(collected with a 0.45 micron filter). .. The concentration of barium also dropped from a reported value of 0.35 mg/l
using the 5.0 micron filter to 0.32 mg/l with the 0.45 micron filter.

On the question of whether arsenic, for example, is potentially associated with Perenco’s operations, the Tribunal is
not in a position to decide who is correct. It will therefore defer making a final determination. The technical issue,
on which the Tribunal will, if necessary, seek additional guidance on, is whether filtering is required for all relevant
tests in order to determine whether oilfield activities have caused damage to groundwater supplies in the Blocks and
where it is proper to do so, what type of filter is appropriate.

 

 

 

 

175

testing the same location using the 0.45 micron filter GSI concluded that
there were no impacts [D5S:P1353:L11-P1354:L1]. GSI again gives no

explanation as to why the initial results were disregarded.”''"°
567. To this, Perenco replied that:

...-Ecuador’s argument regarding the supposed bias introduced by the use
of a 0.45 micron filter has no merit. As GSI explained, these filters were
specifically designed for groundwater sampling to ensure the lab will test
groundwater and not excess mud suspended in it. The Ecuadorian
technical guidelines promulgated by INEN and referenced in TULAS
even define dissolved concentrations in water as those that will pass
through a 0.45 micron filter.!'“7

568. The conflict between the experts demonstrates why the Tribunal considers that it must
have its own expert. The importance of uncontaminated water (even if not necessarily potable
without treatment!'**) cannot be overstated and the Tribunal is uncomfortable with the prospect
that it might err in deciding the appropriate groundwater testing protocol. This will be referred to
the Tribunal’s expert to examine in light of the Tribunal’s determination of the appropriate
technical standard.

569. Having regard to the foregoing, the Tribunal will instruct an independent expert to redo
the groundwater sampling in accordance with the following directions. Given that both Parties’
experts had ample opportunity to test for groundwater exceedances, the Tribunal’s expert’s
sampling shall be:

(i) | Confined to the sampling locations identified by IEMS/GSI.
(ii) At each location, new wells must be drilled in accordance with best practices.

(iii) For substances covered by TULAS, Annex 1, Table 5, which the expert considers
to be associated with hydrocarbon exploitation, the expert shall use the appropriate
sampling technique (whether filtration or no filtration) as reflected in NTE INEN
2169:98 produced by the Ecuadorian Standardisation Institute and referred to in
Section 5 of Annex 1 of TULAS.

(iv) If the expert determines whether filtration is appropriate for the substances being
tested, he/she shall determine what size of filter pore is appropriate.

(v) The expert shall also address GSI’s separation of the TPH parameter into three
different parameters: Gasoline Range Organics, Diesel Range Organics and Oil
Range Organics. In case of doubt as to whether a substance could be associated
with oilfield operations, the expert shall test for that substance.

(vi) Given the effluxion of time, in the event that the resampling results in findings of
contamination in excess of applicable standards, it might be necessary to allocate
responsibility for remediation as between Perenco and Petroamazonas.

It might be that water drawn from the surface or from shallow wells is not potable for reasons having
nothing to do with oilfield operations.

E. Cost of remediation

570. Another key issue which has divided the Parties and which has an important impact on
the quantum of damages concerns the estimated costs of remediation.

571. Ecuador submitted that once found liable Perenco is required to “fully restore the
ecosystems in Blocks 7 and 21 or pay damages to allow the State to proceed with the restoration
process.” Article 396, paragraph 2, of the 2008 Constitution is said to provide that any harm to
the environment “give[s] rise to an obligation to fully restore the ecosystems and compensate the
individuals and communities affected.”''4? Ecuador’s position was that since Perenco has
“refused” to take responsibility for restoration, it must be ordered to pay damages in lieu.!!°° As
the Tribunal has already found, as a matter of Ecuadorian law, an impact on the environment
resulting from oilfield operations is not to be equated with an environmental harm; the harm
exists in cases of regulatory exceedances, unremediated spills, poorly constructed mud pits, etc.
Moreover, production in the Blocks has increased. Perenco is therefore not obliged to incur the
costs of returning the Blocks to a pre-anthropogenic pristine state of nature. It must, however,
pay for any remediation for which it is legally responsible, such cost of remediation to be
calculated having regard to market pricing.

572. In view of the fact that the Tribunal intends to appoint an independent expert to assist in
ascertaining the environmental condition of the Blocks in accordance with the legal and factual
findings made in this Decision, the Tribunal leaves to one side the extent of remediation which
might be required. That depends upon the expert’s resampling results. The Tribunal does
consider it important to set out its views on the remediation costs issue.

573. The Parties differ on: (i) the type of remediation technology; (ii) the costs for off-site
treatment; (iii) whether off-site remediation is even necessary; and (iv) the costs of transportation
and backfilling and contingency and other factors.

574. The Parties and their experts differ on whether all adversely affected soils should be
treated off-site.''*! GSI proposed that such soil be sent to an officially-approved soil remediation
facility in the city of Coca for treatment while IEMS proposed that it is sent to an unspecified
offsite bio-treatment facility.!'!*? They also disagreed on the treatment of soils contaminated by
heavy metals; GSI proposed an on-site lined landfill, while IEMS proposed an off-site
landfill"!

575. Since the Tribunal has rejected IEMS’ principal means of mapping contamination and
has held that properly contained drilling muds need not be dug up and transferred to other sites
for disposal, the volume of soil requiring remediation will be considerably smaller than the high
volumes estimated by IEMS. With respect to what might require remediation, the Tribunal’s
views are as follows.

576. In the event that the expert considers that certain mud pits do not meet the requisite
standards, they shall be remediated. Consistent with the Tribunal’s findings, this would involve

149 Exhibit EL-89, 2008 Constitution.

451 See above at paragraphs 232-233, 267, 287-288.

177

in-situ disposal in properly constructed and sealed pits. In such circumstances, it is unlikely that
there would be much in the way of transportation costs associated with the relocation and
confinement of such soils.

577. In the case of other soils that are found to be contaminated, the determination of whether
such soils can be properly treated and disposed of in the Blocks is not something that the
Tribunal can decide in the abstract. If the expert finds that a particular volume of soil requires
special treatment due to the nature of the contamination and that that treatment is better provided
off-site, it follows that the soil must be treated in the most environmentally protective manner
possible and transportation as well as remediation costs will be incurred.

 

578. If there is any soil that cannot be treated and instead needs to be confined in a hazardous
waste landfill, then the Tribunal considers that it must be confined in a properly constructed and
licenced hazardous waste landfill. If there is such a facility located within an industrial area
situated in the Blocks, such soil could be deposited there. If there is any doubt as to whether such
a landfill is suitable, any contaminated soil that must be landfilled should not be kept in the
Amazonian rainforest area of Ecuador, but rather disposed of in a less environmentally sensitive
area of the country. For this reason, the Tribunal is not attracted to GSI’s suggestion of the
construction of an on-site landfill in either of the Blocks.!!™4

 

579. As for the costs associated with the treatment and, if necessary, transport of contaminated
soil, the Tribunal considers that the expert must be guided by in-country price quotations that
realistically reflect the conditions in which the work will be performed.''°> The Tribunal’s sense
is that the estimates employed by IEMS were too far removed from Ecuador and not tied to
actual in-country remediations (such as those conducted at the behest of Petroamazonas and
Petroecuador) to be considered to be reliable.''*° The Tribunal also has doubts that there is not
sufficient in-country expertise to deal with such remediation as might be required.''>’ If the
Tribunal’s expert is persuaded otherwise and the matter returns to the Tribunal for final
determination, the Tribunal will revisit its present assumption in that regard.

580. Therefore, when estimating costs of any remediation for which Perenco is liable, the
expert shall be guided by Ecuadorian costs. These are expected to be much closer to the ‘per
unit’ costs estimated by GSI (the Tribunal noting however the qualification that the work
required may be more substantial than that estimated by GSI) than to those employed by IEMS.

M154 GSI ER I, paragraph 246, Appendix H.

1155 ITEMS used, for example, unit costs for remediation of abandoned hazardous waste landfills in the United
States as published by the Federal Roundtable on Remediation Technologies and the US EPA’s “Cleaning

two Ecuadorian contractors, but this was limited. See the “economical quotation” for another site given by GPower
and submitted with the Reply. IEMS ER III, Attachment 34.3. In contrast, GSI looked at prior remediation projects
in the Oriente area, costs published by the Pit Remediation Project of the Ecuadorian Oriente Region, and quotes
from private contractors (GSI ER I, Appendix G.2.).

1156 The Tribunal agrees with Perenco that actual costs are the best guide for estimating comparagraphble
remediation works (Rejoinder, paragraph 14). Perenco argued that IEMS’ costs estimates were some 400% higher
than actual, verified costs in Ecuador for the relevant remediation work (Rejoinder, paragraph 25).
1ST As Perenco observed, a number of local contractors are licences by the Ministry of Environment and
perform work for oil including Stat. d ( r h 212).

 

178

F. Validation of the Experts’ Conflicting Contamination Determinations and
Delineations Thereof

581. The Tribunal has now arrived at the point where it has narrowed the counterclaim on the
principal issues of law and fact. The Tribunal has set out the main issues of fact and law which
have divided the experts. However, with regard to many of the IEMS/GSI differences, the
Tribunal does not feel able to prefer one above the other. It seems to the Tribunal that each was
attempting to achieve the best result for the party by whom they were instructed, and that they
crossed the boundary between professional objective analysis and party representation. It is clear
to the Tribunal that the experts were effectively shooting at different targets and this has made
the work of this Tribunal most difficult.

582. After reviewing the evidence, the Tribunal is satisfied that there is some contamination in
the Blocks for which it is likely that Perenco will be held liable. Even GSI was prepared to
accept that there was contamination in the two Blocks (although Perenco argued that such
contamination resulted from the acts of other parties).

583. The Tribunal has carefully considered the evidence and has found that there are certain
issues of fact on which it is extremely difficult for it to make proper determinations. As has been
seen, the Tribunal has completely rejected the IEMS’ mapping exercise based on background
values and has found that the appropriate means for establishing the volume of contaminated
soils is delineation. In addition, the Tribunal has rejected certain interpretations of the
Ecuadorian regulatory standards applied by IEMS. In applying the proper regulatory standards,
the Tribunal finds that the expert evidence from both sides does not provide a sufficient degree
of confidence as to the actual conditions in the Blocks. The Tribunal considers that there are too
many gaps and conflicts between IEMS’ and GSI’s evidence on these key issues. For example,
GSI did not take samples at all of the sites that IEMS tested; for certain sites where IEMS found
contamination, GSI also tested the soil but took samples at different depths, and GSI used
“indicator parameters” rather than testing comprehensively for all possible oilfield related
contaminants. The Tribunal considers that these gaps must be filled and the technical conflicts
must be resolved in order to arrive at a fair and proper disposition of Ecuador’s counterclaim.

584. In its post-hearing submission, Perenco essentially posited that the Tribunal faces an ‘all
or nothing’ decision:

The various technical issues on which GSI and IEMS so fundamentally
disagree are relevant not because the Tribunal should take as its task
picking and choosing between the experts on each issue one by one,
cafeteria-style, to arrive at some hybrid approach. There is too much
interrelationship between the issues to make that kind of exercise
productive. Instead, those technical issues are relevant because they
provide the basis on which the Tribunal can assess the two approaches,
and the basis on which the Tribunal should conclude that GSI’s approach
is far more reliable and trustworthy than IEMS’ approach. !!°*

585. While the Tribunal agrees with Perenco that given the present state of the evidence it
should not “take as its task picking and choosing between the experts on each issue one by one,
cafeteria-style” — because the Tribunal does not possess the requisite technical expertise to

4188 Perenco’s Post-Hearing Brief, paragraph 50.

179

decide between experts’ disagreements over highly technical issues — it is equally uncomfortable
with simply picking one set of experts’ conclusions over the other. The Tribunal well
understands that the onus of proof is on a party who makes an allegation and it could be said that
because of the doubt in which the Tribunal finds itself Ecuador could be said to have failed in
tipping the burden in its favour. However, as the Tribunal is satisfied that there has been some
damage for which it seems likely that Perenco is liable, the Tribunal is not disposed to dismiss
the counterclaim in limine. Given the Constitution’s embrace of the importance of the protection
of the environment, the most accurate picture of the environmental condition of the Blocks
possible — based on the prior sampling locations of both IEMS and GSI — must inform the
Tribunal’s decision on the counterclaim.

586. Accordingly, the Tribunal has concluded that it must require an additional phase of fact-
finding in order to arrive at a proper and just conclusion. It is not content to issue a final
determination on the extent of Perenco’s liability on the basis of the current expert reports.

587. As already intimated, the Tribunal intends to appoint its own independent environmental
expert who will be instructed to apply the Tribunal’s findings set out above and work with the
Tribunal and the Parties to enable the Tribunal to determine the extent of contamination in the
Blocks for which compensation is owed.

588. The Tribunal wishes to underscore the fact that the expert chosen to conduct this
investigation (after consultation with the Parties to ensure complete independence and
impartiality) will be the Tribunal’s expert and will be solely answerable to the Tribunal. In due
course, the Tribunal will provide a protocol for the expert, setting out the precise questions to be
answered in line with the findings made in this Decision. The Parties will be permitted to attend
when the expert and his/her team carries out the necessary investigations and the Parties will
receive a copy of the expert’s report and will be permitted to comment thereon in due course.
Naturally, the costs involved in this exercise will initially be borne by the Parties in equal shares
with any subsequent allocation of costs to be determined by the Tribunal at the appropriate time.

589. The Tribunal wishes to emphasise that with the effluxion of time it will be necessary to
consider what impact Petroamazonas has had on the environmental conditions in Blocks 7 and
21. It intends to deal with this issue as follows.

590. First, in the Tribunal’s view, IEMS and GSI had ample opportunity to take samples in
whatever parts of the Blocks either considered necessary. The Tribunal’s expert will therefore
confine his/her work to the specific sites at which soil samples were taken and groundwater
sampling wells were drilled. Although, due to the differences between IEMS and GSI’s sampling
practices, it will be necessary for the expert to re-sample at those sites where contamination was
detected by one or the other party’s experts and to delineate the extent of any such
contamination, the Tribunal’s expert will not sample other sites that the Parties’ experts did not
sample.

591. Second, the Tribunal recognises that the conditions likely to exist in 2015 might have
been affected by the actions of Petroamazonas. It might therefore be necessary for the Tribunal
to determine Perenco’s share of any responsibility for contamination in order to ensure that it is
not made responsible for the acts of Petroamazonas.

592. Third, the Tribunal wishes to make clear that this course of action is not intended to
provide any opportunity for the Parties to provide new evidence (except that called for by the

180

Tribunal in aid of its expert). They have had ample opportunity to present their cases. The
purpose of the next phase is for the Tribunal’s expert to validate one approach or the other in
respect of the remaining technical issues.

593. That said, the Tribunal considers it highly desirable for the Parties to take time to
properly digest the contents of this Decision and its implications in the overall scheme of things,
and they may wish to consider embarking on a mediation process or some other consensual
procedure to assist in arriving at a mutually acceptable figure. Having regard to the Tribunal’s
findings in relation to: (i) background values; (ii) the temporal application of the 2008
Constitution to the facts of this case; (iii) the applicable standards under Ecuadorian law; (iv) the
2008 Constitution’s variation of the limitations period; (v) the Tribunal’s criticism of the
narrowness of GSI’s sampling practices; (vi) the Tribunal’s rejection of IEMS’ mapping and unit
costs for remediation; and (vii) the fact the Tribunal will not permit the sampling of areas in the
Blocks which were not previously sampled by either party’s experts, the Tribunal believes that
the remaining issues are most unlikely to lead to an award of damages anywhere near the amount
claimed by Ecuador. The Parties will doubtless take all this into account as well as the
considerable cost of the further enquiry which the Tribunal considers is absolutely necessary to
arrive at a just result in the circumstances of this case in deciding whether it is possible for them
to arrive at a mutually satisfactory resolution of this aspect of the dispute.

594. The Tribunal’s strong preference and hope is that after receiving this Decision and
considering the Tribunal’s findings, the legal aspects of the counterclaim will have been
sufficiently clarified so as to enable the Parties to agree on a suitable amount of compensation
with or without the assistance of an independent expert or a final Tribunal determination. In the
event that such an agreement is reached, it will be recorded and included in the Tribunal’s
Award. If an agreement is not reached, the Tribunal will await the results of its expert’s work
and make a final decision which will be included in the Award.

595. The Tribunal is mindful that it is almost certain that the sampling performed by both
experts did not adequately capture all of the contamination. Indeed, notwithstanding its initial
declaration that its intention was to “achieve a comprehensive assessment of current
environmental conditions for each of the 74 oilfield facilities investigated by IEMS in the CPUF,
Block 7, and Block 21 area”, this is not what GSI did.''°° As Ecuador pointed out, GSI accepted
that it confined its investigation to seeking to invalidate RECs identified by IEMS.!!© Mr.
Connor further confirmed that GSI did not attempt to comprehensively estimate the amount of
contamination in the Blocks, separately from its review of IEMS’ work, and acknowledged that
both experts could have missed instances of contamination.'!®! Be this as it may, the present
exercise is concerned with an accurate and impartial analysis of the work that was done by the
experts — who had ample opportunity to examine the Blocks. Their work must now be evaluated
by the expert in accordance with the Tribunal’s findings.

596. It need hardly be said that every attempt must be made to base the determination of
damages owed on the situation existing at the time of the Consortium’s departure in July 2009.

461 See, for e.g., Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 6, p 1709- 1716, 1723-1725, 1729, 1733
(Testimony of GSI).

181

597. Turning to certain sampling issues, the Tribunal notes that GSI excluded platforms and
CPFs from its investigation, because it took the position that they are “operating industrial
facilities”, a position which Ecuador rejects as an unjustified basis on which to exclude what it
says in effect amounts to some 26% of the contamination beyond regulatory levels identified by
IEMS in Block 7, this figure rising to 50% in Block 21.'!©? Given the fact that platforms and
CPFs have been taken over and employed by Petroamazonas, it is difficult to apportion
responsibility for any contamination therein. The Tribunal is also mindful of Mr. Connor’s
cautionary words about Ecuador’s proposed approach to remediation of operating platforms:

  

Basically at facilities where operations are ongoing, it doesn't force you
to remediate. It says, "You must manage that impact." And the
management could include a remediation component, but certainly it
doesn't obligate it, and the practice is it doesn't happen. And the reason it
doesn't happen is because you don't want to go with very large machines,
start digging a platform that has high-pressure pipes, that has a well head
under pressure, where you're conducting risky operations. It doesn't make
sense.'1

598. The Tribunal considers that the only equitable solution in relation to exceedances that
were detected on operating platforms is to have the expert examine the exceedances samples
taken by IEMS, consider their significance in light of all relevant circumstances, and if they are
deemed to warrant remediation, Perenco is prima facie liable for the costs thereof (having regard
to the Tribunal’s findings on the operation of Ecuadorian law made above), and subject to the
expert’s examining Petroamazonas’ post-16 July 2009 spill reporting records to ensure that
Perenco is not being held liable for the acts of its successor. In the event of any overlapping
contamination, it will be necessary to apportion responsibility between the two.

599. If there are any platforms in the Blocks that were operated by Perenco and are no longer
operated, Mr. Connor’s concern is no longer relevant. Consistent with the 2008 Constitution’s
emphasis on full restoration, such platforms must be remediated to the full extent of industry best
practice under Ecuadorian law. The same applies to any wells that were retired by Perenco. The
objective should be to remediate to the fullest extent possible, consistent with the Constitution’s
objective of full restoration (and the Participation Contracts’ objective of returning those areas to
their natural state). !!°*

1162 See Transcript, Hearing on Counterclaims, Day 1, pp 141-142 (Opening Statement of Philip Dunham). GSI
accepts that it excluded from its investigation platforms and CPFs, otherwise referred to as “operating industrial
facilities”, because it took the position that remediation was not required within the limits of platforms (GSI ER I,
Appendix D: “exceedances in soil were within an operating industrial facility”). RPS challenged this position (RPS
ER II, p 12). Ecuador submits that this is an unjustified and significant omission because IEMS identified 20
platforms which exhibited contamination beyond regulatory levels.

tos As, for example, stated in the Block 21 Contract at clause 5.1.20.10, which requires the contractor to:
“Take responsibility for the cleanup and reforestation of the area with speci milar to those originally found at the
site, in order to, with time, allow the potential return to environmental conditions similar to those encountered at the
inning of the rations; also take ibility for the of wells and 1 for which the
Contractor has been responsible as a consequence of the execution of this Contract. Said cleanup, reforestation and
return to s imilar conditions and abandonment activities shall be performed in accordance with the Environmental
for Hydi bon O ions and the Envi Impact Study. The Contractor shall not be liable for
di ing at the begi of i s under the Services Contract. In cases in which

 

 

 

182

600. In addition to platforms and retired wells, the Tribunal’s expert must examine all sites in
which regulatory exceedances have been identified by either or both of the Parties’ experts. If,
because the Parties’ experts sampled at different levels, it is necessary to take new samples, that
shall be done, and such sampling shall, under the direction of the Tribunal’s expert, be
comprehensive and designed to determine whether exceedances do or do not exist at each
previously identified site. Any resampling must occur only at the specific sites already identified
in the IEMS and GSI reports.

601. To the extent that the areas surrounding those points of contamination were not
delineated, for example, because IEMS did not delineate them due to its reliance upon the
ArcGIS software or because GSI did not delineate certain sites because they did not pass its
“indicator parameter” screen or for other reasons, that process of delineation must now occur,
and it must be conducted properly, under the direction of the Tribunal’s expert.

602. If there is any evidence that any area which remains to be delineated has since been
contaminated by Petroamazonas, that evidence must be taken into account and the amount of
damages payable must be reduced appropriately. In the event of any dispute about a particular
site, Ecuador shall be required to provide all relevant documentation pertaining to the
environmental condition of that site since 19 July 2009.

603. The sampling review and any additional delineation must check every instance of
contamination identified by IEMS and GSI and determine whether it is established in light of the
Tribunal’s foregoing determinations of the applicable regulatory rule. Where there are sites that
were sampled by IEMS but not by GSI and/or the samples were tested for substances by IEMS
but not tested by GSI, the focus will necessarily have to be based on IEMS’ samples unless the
independent expert concludes that there is a need to take new samples.

604. The same exercise must be performed in relation to the mud pits used by Perenco up to
16 July 2009. Perenco cannot be held liable for pits constructed by prior operators which it itself
did not use, because by definition it would be able to show that any damage caused from
leachates escaping from such pits cannot be attributed to it. It can only be held liable for damage
resulting from the pits which it used or built. It is necessary to ascertain whether the drilling
muds were disposed of in a properly constructed sealed pit or disposed of in an unsealed pit or
one that was improperly constructed and which therefore may be more susceptible to leaching.

605. Unless visual or other testing clearly demonstrates that a pit was lined, then the more
conservative and environmentally protective remediation criteria set out in RAOHE Table 7(a)
shall be applied to ensure that any leaching which might have taken place is contained and
remediated and that there is no further prospect of contamination. In this respect, mindful of
TEMS’ allegation that GSI took samples too far away from the pits, which the Tribunal is not in a
position to determine, the Tribunal’s expert shall ensure that any new samples are taken at the
appropriate spots situated around the perimeters of the pits.

 

the competent authorities order the remediation of the environment in the Contract Area, due to preexisting
conditions, the costs and contracting [for this purpose] shall not be the responsibility of the Contractor.” (Exhibit
CE-17/CE-CC-28, Block 7 Participation Contract (translation resubmitted on 04-12-12), PER 04764, 04768, 04769.)

183

606. As for pits that Perenco constructed and that have been since used by Petroamazonas,
again it will be necessary to apportion responsibility between the two companies in the event of
any exceedances.

607. The groundwater issue presents particular difficulties because the Tribunal is
uncomfortable with both side’s sampling: IEMS’ because it appeared to be compromised by the
wells and the materials used to take samples, and GSI’s because of its filtering of all samples
which had the effect of reducing the possibility of detecting certain contaminants that should be
looked for without filtering.

608. This issue is complicated by the effluxion of time. The Tribunal considers that the only
equitable solution is for a new, proper groundwater campaign to be conducted under its expert’s
supervision and then an allocation of any remediation costs (if remediation is required) to be
made as between Perenco and Petroamazonas. Such sampling shall be taken at the same sites at
which the experts took samples. Since Perenco ran the Blocks from late 2002 until mid-July
2009 (roughly six and a half years) and Petroamazonas has operated them from mid-July 2009 to
the present day (roughly five and a half years) the allocation will be based on the amount of time
in which the Blocks have been under the stewardship of the two operators (e.g. 55/45%).

609. Once this exercise has been completed, it will be possible to arrive either at a negotiated
settlement of the damages owed by Perenco to Ecuador, or the Tribunal will be in a position to
make a final determination.

610. Finally, the Tribunal has evaluated the infrastructure counterclaim. It has decided that it
is most expedient and constructive for this Decision on the principal counterclaim to be issued so
as to permit the expert to be selected, appointed, instructed on his/her mandate and to then
engage in the work that needs to be done. The infrastructure counterclaim, although important, is
for a significantly lesser sum. In addition, the Tribunal considers that it might profit from the
evidence pertaining to Perenco’s operatorship that will be adduced in the quantum phase and
feels that it would be best to leave this claim to be addressed in the overall quantum.

DECISION

For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal decides as follows:

qd)

(2)

G)

(4)

(5)

(6)

7)

(8)

(9)

Ecuadorian law, in the form of Ecuador’s Constitution, and specific
regulatory provisions within RAOHE, TULAS and the Environmental
Management Law, provides the standards governing the Tribunal’s
evaluation of the environmental condition of Blocks 7 and 21. It does not
require the Tribunal to generally apply a “background values” or “base
values” approach.

RAOHE and TULAS provide the regulatory limits applicable to the
evaluation of the environmental condition of lands on which hydrocarbon
operations have been permitted to take place in furtherance of the
Environmental Management Law’s general framework.

For the period commencing 4 September 2002, when Perenco first
acquired its interests in the Blocks, through to 19 October 2008, the 1998
Constitution’s fault-based regime applies.

For any contamination in excess of regulatory standards shown to have
occurred after 20 October 2008 up until the Consortium suspended
operations on 16 July 2009, Perenco is strictly liable in accordance with
the 2008 Constitution’s strict-liability regime for environmental damage.
With regard to any environmental harm occurring in the Blocks from 16
July 2009, when Petromazonas took over the Blocks, Perenco bears no
liability. Its remediation obligation extends only to regulatory exceedances
that predate Petroamazonas’s activities and which themselves have not
been overtaken by Petroamazonas’s new works.

The four-year limitation period of Article 2235 of the Ecuadorian Civil
Code does not bar Ecuador’s counterclaim.

Perenco’s submission that it bears no responsibility for the Blocks on the
basis that Petroamazonas is now the operator and its ownership interests in
the Blocks have been brought to an end is rejected.

The Tribunal shall appoint an independent environmental expert to assist
the Tribunal in ascertaining the environmental condition of the Blocks in
accordance with the legal and factual findings made by the Tribunal in this
Decision. The Tribunal will consult the Parties with regard to the
appointment of the Tribunal’s expert and will take their views into account
but the decision as to the identity of and scope of work of the expert will
be that of the Tribunal alone.

The Tribunal anticipates that the process of appointing an expert will take
some two months; during this period, the Parties are instructed to review
the findings made in this Decision and to consult with each other with a
view to discussing whether it would be possible to arrive at a settlement of
this counterclaim in a manner consistent with this Decision. Any
communications or documents exchanged by the Parties in connection

with such discussions shall be on a without prejudice basis and shall not
be disclosed to the Tribunal or to the Tribunal’s expert in the event that no
settlement is reached.

The expert will be instructed to apply the Tribunal’s findings and work
with the Tribunal and the Parties to enable the Tribunal to determine the
extent of contamination in the Blocks for which remediation is required.
At all times the expert will be solely answerable to the Tribunal.

The expert will be required to perform its work in accordance with the
directions set out in this Decision and as set out in any protocol that might
be issued by the Tribunal after consultation with the Parties.

Delineation, instead of modelling, shall be employed to determine the
volume of any soil that requires remediation.

Table 6, Annex 2 of RAOHE applies to the identification and remediation
of contaminated soil, but to the extent that it is silent, TULAS Book VI,
Annex 2, Table 3, applies.

Ecuadorian law relevant to evaluation of the environmental effect of
hydrocarbon operations on land does not require the use of indicator
parameters.

In any case of doubt as to the applicable land-use criteria, subject to prior
determinations of Ecuadorian authorities which have significant probative
value, the more stringent land-use designation applies.

On the matter of mud-pits, Table 7 of Annex 2 of RAOHE provides the
applicable technical standard, and Perenco has no obligation to dig up and
remediate properly constructed and confined mud pits whose contents do
not exceed the applicable regulatory standard. If a pit has an impermeable
liner, Table 7(b) applies. If there is no impermeable liner, Table 7(a)
applies. In any case of doubt, the more environmentally protective
standard in Table 7(a) applies.

On the matter of groundwater testing, the expert shall undertake
groundwater sampling in accordance with the Tribunal’s determination of
the appropriate technical standard under Ecuadorian law and industry
practice as set out in this Decision. Its sampling shall be confined to to the
sampling locations identified by IEMS and GSI. Given the effluxion of
time, it might be necessary to allocate responsibility for remediation as
between Perenco and Petroamazonas. The Tribunal will await the expert’s
report in this regard.

Questions of remediation method and cost are to be resolved in
accordance with the Tribunal’s directions in that respect as set out in this
Decision.

The Parties shall be entitled to send a representative to witness the expert’s
sampling activities.

The Tribunal will instruct the expert to move with all deliberate dispatch
in order for the expert to be in a position to report back to it in a timely
fashion. The Parties shall be given an opportunity to comment on the
expert’s report prior to the Tribunal’s rendering a decision or award on
this phase of the proceeding.

186

(21)

(22)

(23)

The costs of the expert’s work will initially be borne by the Parties in
equal shares with any subsequent allocation of costs to be determined by
the Tribunal at the appropriate time.

The Tribunal reserves its decision on the infrastructure counterclaim with
which it will deal either in its quantum Decision or thereafter.

The Tribunal reserves its decision as to costs and expenses of the
arbitration as claimed by the Parties.
