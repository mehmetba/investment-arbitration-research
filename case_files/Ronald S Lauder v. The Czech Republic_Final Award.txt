Introduction

In 1989, the Czech and Slovak people overthrew the communist regime and adopted a
democratic governance system embracing market economy. New laws had to be

adopted, foreign investment was encouraged.

Various Bilateral Investment Treaties were concluded to create the necessary legal
protection for new investments, among them the Treaty between the United States of
America and the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic Concerning the Reciprocal
Encouragement and Protection of Investment, entered into on 22 October 1991 (the

Treaty).

On 30 October 1991, a new Act on Operating Radio and Television Broadcasting (the
Media Law) was adopted. It provided for the creation of the Council of the Czech
Republic for Radio and Television Broadcasting (the Media Council) to ensure the
observance of the Media Law, the development of plurality in broadcasting, and the
development of domestic and European audio-visual work. The Media Council was

also competent to grant operating licences.

In 1992, the Media Council commenced the necessary licensing procedures for nation-
wide private television broadcasting, and, on 9 February 1993, it granted License No
001/1993 to Central European Television 21, CET 21 spol. s r.o. (hereafter ,,CET

21"), a company founded by a small number of Czech citizens.

During the license application proceedings, CET 21 had worked closely with a foreign
group, Central European Development Corporation GmbH (hereafter “CEDC”), in
which Mr. Ronald S. Lauder (hereafter the “Claimant” or “Mr. Lauder’), an American
citizen, had an important interest. At that time and since then, Mr. Lauder has among
other activities been an important player in the audio-visual media in the former

communist States of Central and Eastern Europe.

The formula which was finally adopted envisaged the formation of a new joint

company, Ceské nezvislé televizni spolecnost , spol. s r.0. (hereafter"CNTS”), with

the participation of CET 21, a Czech bank and, as a majority shareholder, a company

representing the foreign investors.

The key person was Dr. Vladimir Zelemy, a Czech citizen with a long experience in
the media field, also a scriptwriter, etc. Mr. Zelezny became at the same time what
amounted to the Chief Operating Officer of both CET 21 and CNTS. The new
television station, TV Nova, immediately became very popular and very profitable.

The successful venture came to an end in 1999 when CNTS, on April 19, fired
Mr. Zelezny from his functions with CNTS and when CET 21, on 5 August 1999,
terminated its contractual relations with CNTS, after CNTS, on 4 August 4 1999, had
not submitted the so-called Daily Log regarding the broadcasting for the following
day.

During all this period the Media Council of the Czech Republic played an important
role, especially during three periods. First, at the end of 1992 and the beginning of
1993, when it granted the License. Then, at the end of 1995 and in 1996, when a new
Media Law became effective and the Media Council commenced administrative
proceedings against CNTS, whereupon the agreements between CNTS and CET 21
were modified. Finally, during the Spring and Summer of 1999, when the final breach
between CET 21 and CNTS occurred.

On 19 August 1999, Mr. Lauder commenced arbitration proceedings against the Czech
Republic (hereafter the “Defendant”) under the Treaty, claiming that the Czech
Republic, through its Media Council, had violated the Treaty. This Award examines
the claims brought forward by Mr. Lauder.

Procedural History

On 19 August 1999, Ronald S. Lauder initiated these arbitration proceedings by giving
Notice _of Arbitration to the Czech Republic. The Notice submitted that the dispute is
subject to arbitration pursuant to Articles VI(2) and (3) of the Treaty and should be

heard by a panel of three arbitrators pursuant to Article 5 of the UNCITRAL Rules.
The Notice of Arbitration also stated that the Czech Republic had consented to submit
the dispute to arbitration pursuant to Article VI(3)(b) of the Treaty. The Claimant

sought the following relief:

“{An] order [to] the Czech Republic to take such actions as are necessary to restore

the contractual and legal rights associated with the claimant’s investments. Among

other things, the Czech Republic should:

a) be ordered to impose conditions on the License that adequately reflect and secure
CNTS's exclusive right to provide broadcast services and its right to obtain all
corresponding income in connection with the operation of TV Nova;

b) be required to enforce such conditions, including by revoking the License and

reissuing it to CNTS or to such other entity and under such other circumstances as
would restore the initial economic underpinnings of Mr. Lauder’s investment; and

be held liable for the damages Mr. Lauder has incurred to date, in an amount to be

2

determined by the Tribunal, taking into account, among other factors, the fair

market value of Mr. Lauder’s investment prior to the breaches of the Treaty”.

The Claimant appointed Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler as co-arbitrator. The Respondent
appointed Mr. Bohuslav Klein as co-arbitrator. Both co-arbitrators chose Mr. Robert
Briner as Chairman of the Arbitral Tribunal.

On 5 November 1999, the Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 1
provisionally fixing Geneva, Switzerland, as the place of arbitration, and determining

English as the language of arbitration.

On 13 December 1999, the Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 2 taking note

of the agreement of the Parties proposing London as the place of arbitration.

On 31 January 2000, the Czech Republic submitted a Statement of Defence in which it
requested that reference to arbitration by Mr. Lauder be dismissed on the grounds that
the Arbitral Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the claim; and/or no investment dispute
contemplated by the Treaty exists; and/or Mr. Lauder’s Notice of Arbitration was

premature or otherwise formally defective.

On 17 March 2000, a Procedural Hearing was held in London. The Arbitral Tribunal
(i) decided that the issue of jurisdiction would be joined to the merits and that no
separate decision on jurisdiction would be taken unless the Arbitral Tribunal would
hold that a separate determination would shorten the proceedings; (ii) took note of the
agreement of the Parties that they would make good faith efforts to agree by 30 April
2000 on a solution to the issue of the scope and timing of the production of documents
required from the Respondent; (iii) took note of the agreement of the Parties that in
general the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Commercial
Arbitration would be used; (iv) took note of the agreement of the Parties on the
schedule for the submission of further briefs; (v) considered that a bifurcation of
liability and remedy would not be helpful; (vi) took note of the agreement of the
Parties with respect to the issues of confidentiality of the proceedings; (vii) took note
of the absence of an agreement between the Parties to consolidate or coordinate the
parallel UNCITRAL arbitration between CME and the Czech Republic; and (viii)

addressed some other minor issues.

On 10 May 2000, the Claimant sent a letter to the Arbitral Tribunal regarding the
production of further documents. The 14 March 2000 Declaration of Mr. Richard

BaGek was attached to this letter.

On 17 May 2000, the Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 3 pursuant to
which the Respondent was given a time limit until 23 May 2000 to answer the

Claimant’s request for production of further documents.

On 31 May 2000, after receipt of the Claimant’s letter of 10 May 2000 requesting the
production of further files, documents, minutes and other records in the possession of
the Media Council, and of the Respondent’s letter of 23 May 2000 requesting that the
application be rejected, the Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 4 rejecting
the Claimant’s request for production of further documents on the ground that it first

needed to receive the Claimant’s Memorial and the Respondent’s Response.

On 30 June 2000, the Claimant filed his Memorial of Claimant. The following Witness

Declarations were made in support of the Memorial:

On 17 November 2000, the Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order No 7 pursuant to
which it decided that the Claimant’s request for production of general categories of
documents was inappropriate, but that the Respondent was ordered to submit to the
Claimant and to the Arbitral Tribunal copies of those documents which the Claimant

had previously been able to inspect but had not been allowed to copy.

Facts

The 19992-1993 events

On 30 October 1991, the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic adopted the Act on
Operating Radio and Television Broadcasting (hereinafter: the “Media Law”). The
Media Law empowered the Federal Council for Radio and Television Broadcasting
(hereinafter: “the Media Council”) to grant a license to broadcast radio and television

programs (Exhibit R2).

Pursuant to the Act on the Czech Republic Council for Radio and Television
Broadcasting of 21 February 1992, one of the duties of the Media Council is to
supervise the observance of legal regulations governing radio and _ television

broadcasting (Exhibit R6).

In 1992, the Media Council invited interested candidates to apply for a license for a
new radio and television broadcasting on the third channel (hereinafter: “the License”)

(Exhibit R53).

On 27 August 1992, CET 21, a Czech company originally owned by some individuals
(hereinafter: “the Founders”), and whose General Director was Mr. Zelezny, a Czech

citizen, filed an application for the License (Exhibit C63).

Prior to the filing of the application, CET 21 had held discussions with the CEDC, a
German company over which Mr. Ronald S. Lauder (hereinafter: “Mr. Lauder” or “the

Claimant”), an American citizen, had indirect voting control.

The original idea was that CEDC would participate in the broadcasting operation by
acquiring stock of CET 21 (Exhibit C134). Such a participation would comply with
the requirements of the Media Law, which expressly envisaged in Article 10.6 the
applications for license "from companies with foreign equity participation” (Exhibit

R2).

50.

on
we

On 31 August 1992, CEDC and the Founders of CET 21 agreed on a draft document
named “Terms of Agreement”. This document provided that CEDC would invest a
sum of at least USD 10,000,000 in the establishment of a commercial television
station in Prague “through an equity investment in CET21” in the form of redeemable
"preferred stock or equivalent equal to 49% ownership of CET 21” and of "an equal
amount of common stock”. The Founders would be entitled to 2% of CET 21 each, i.e.
14% in total. The remaining 37% of CET 21 would be held by the Founders in reserve
for additional investors (Exhibit C139).

On 28 September 1992, CET 21 prepared a document named “Project of an
Independent Television Station”. This document stated that CEDC “is a direct

participant in CET 21's application for the license” (Exhibit C9).

On 21 December 1992, the Media Council held preliminary hearings for the granting
of the License. Messrs. Mark Palmer, President of CEDC, and Len Fertig, then
consultant with CEDC, were present at the portion of the hearings on CET 21’s
application. The record of this portion of the hearings, drafted by the Media Council,
speaks of “‘extensive share reserved for foreign capital” and “direct capital share, not
credit”. It also states that “they [CEDC] see themselves as a predominantly passive
investor, we want a station independent of foreign influence and political influence"

(Exhibit R58).

On 5 January 1993, CEDC and the Founders of CET 21 signed a document named
“Terms of Agreement”. This document provided for the same participation of CEDC
in CET 21 as the above mentioned draft agreement dated 31 August 1992, ic. 49% of

redeemable preferred stock and of common stock (Exhibit C61).

The same day, the Media Council held a hearing which was attended by
Messrs. Palmer, Fertig and Zelezny. The participants addressed the issues of other
possible partners besides CEDC in the CET 21 investments, mainly Ceské spofitelna,
a.s., the Czech Savings Bank (hereinafter: “CSB”), the scope of CEDC’s investments

in the project, and the programming (Exhibit C141).

55.

56.

58.

59.

On 22 January 1993, the Media Council held further preliminary hearings. The record
of the portion of the hearings on CET 21 expressly referred to CEDC. It stated that

“the participation of foreign capital is expected” and “the combination of domestic and
foreign capital is important, necessity of safeguard - diversification of the investments

sources” (Exhibit C64).

On 30 January 1993, the Media Council held a session on the issuance of the License.
It was decided that CET 21 was awarded the License. The following statements were
made by some members of the Media Council at this session: “(...) it is very
significant that this is a business which can not be financed only by credit” (Mr. Broz);
“considers the Czech and foreign capital in CET 21 positive” (Mr. Broz); "positive in
that there is a stabilisation factor, as far as foreign capital and its involvement is

concerned” (Mr. Pycha) (Exhibit R54).

The same day, the Media Council issued a press release announcing that CET 21 had
been awarded the License. The press release stated that “A direct participant in the

application is the international corporation CEDC (...)" (Exhibit C11).

The same day, the Media Council sent a letter to CET 21 informing them of its
decision on the award of the License. This document also referred to "(...) a direct

party to the application being the international corporation CEDC (...)". (Exhibit R9).

The Media Council’s decision to award the License to CET 21 raised strong
opposition, mainly from the political party ODS. The ODS blamed the Media Council
for having hastily chosen a company, CET 21, whose representatives were bankrupt

politicians and in which foreign capital prevailed (Exhibits R83, C144, and C145).

On 3 February 1993, CET 21 and CEDC submitted to the Media Council a document
named “Overall Structure of a New Czech Commercial Television Entity”. This
document stated that CET 21 and CEDC would jointly create a new Czech company,
which would have the exclusive use of the License "(...) as long as CET 21 and
CEDC have such a license”. The shareholders of the new company would be CET 21,
CEDC and CSB, the last two of them providing the necessary funds (Exhibits Cl4 and
C149).

At the oral request of Mr. Jakobec, director of the Programming and Monitoring
Section of the Media Council, the above mentioned document of 3 February 1993, was
significantly modified, mainly to reflect the fact that the License would be granted to
CET 21 only, and not to CET 21 and CEDC jointly. The modified document was
issued on 5 February 1993 (Exhibit C150; declaration of Mrs. Landova of 5 December
2000, p. 8).

The same day, the Media Council held a meeting to which representatives of CET 21
were invited. The latter submitted to the Media Council the modified version of the
above mentioned document named “Overall Structure of a New Czech Commercial

Television Entity” (Exhibit R55).

On 9 February 1993, CET 21 issued a document stating that its general assembly,
which had met the previous day, approved the conditions of the Media Council for the

legal confirmation of the License (Exhibit R78).

The same day, the Media Council rendered the decision to award the License to CET
21. This decision referred to CEDC as CET 21's “contractual partner" (Exhibits R10
and C16).

The same day, the Media Council issued the License for a period of 12 years, expiring
on 30 January 2005. The Appendix to the License set forth 31 conditions (hereinafter:
“the Conditions”) that CET 21 had to observe. Condition 17 required among other
matters that CET 21, CEDC and CSB submit a business agreement to the Media
Council for approval within 90 days (Exhibit RS).

The same day, CET 21 accepted without reservation the License, including the

Conditions (Exhibits RIl and R77).

The same day, CSB confirmed its intention to participate in the broadcasting company

to be set up together with CET 21 and CEDC (Exhibit R81).

On 8 April 1993, Mr. Zelemy acquired a 16.66% participation in CET 21.

3.2

On 21 April 1993, after having held several sessions to discuss the draft business
agreements between CET 21, CEDC and CSB, and after having had several contacts
in this matter with the representatives of these companies, the Media Council issued a

letter approving the last version of the business agreement (Exhibit C19).

On 4 May 1993, CET 21, CEDC and CSB signed the final version of the business
agreement, named “Memorandum of Association and Investment Agreement”
(hereinafter: “the MOA”). The MOA provided for the formation of the CNTS, a Czech
company which would manage the television station. CEDC would contribute 75% of
CNTS’s capital and obtain a 66% ownership interest (Article 1.4.3), CSB would
contribute 25% of the capital and obtain a 22% ownership interest (Article 1.4.2). and
CET 21 would contribute “the right to use, benefit from, and maintain the License (...)

on an unconditional, irrevocable and exclusive basis” and obtain a 12% ownership

interest (Article 1.4.1) (Exhibit R12).
On 12 May 1993, the Media Council rendered a decision amending and clarifying the
License issued on 9 February 1993. The main amendment regarded Condition 17,

which stated that the MOA was "an integral part ofthe license terms” (Exhibit C20).

On 8 July 1993, CNTS was incorporated in the Commercial Register administered by
the District Court for Prague (Exhibit C89).

Mr. Zelezny was appointed General Director of the company.

CNTS then launched a television station named TV Nova, which soon became very
successful.

The 1994-1997 events

On 12 May 1994, the Czech Parliament’s Committee for Science, Education, Culture,
Youth, and Physical Training PSP issued a statement that the Media Council had

allowed television broadcasting by an unauthorized entity, ie. CNTS.

17

76.

71.

In an undated opinion, the Media Council answered that CET 21 was the holder of the
License, and CNTS was authorized by the former to perform all acts related to the
development and operation of TV Nova. However, the License “as such has not been
contributed to CNTS and is separate from all other activities of CNTS”. The Media
Council added that, after having consulted “with a number of leading legal experts,
both Czech and foreign”, this “standard business procedure” was discussed and

approved, and did not violate any effective legal regulations (Exhibit C21).

On 4 July 1994, CNTS and CSB acquired 1.25% each of CET 21’s stock (Exhibit
R107). As a result, the participation in CET 21 was as follows:

+ Mr. Zelemy: 16,66%
* The remaining Founders: 80.84%
* CEDC: 1.25%
* CSB: 1.25%.

On 28 July 1994, CEDC assigned all its capital interest in CNTS to CME Media
Entreprises B.V. (hereinafter: “CME”), a Dutch company over which the Claimant

also exercised control (Exhibit C128).

In the summer of 1994, the Czech Parliament replaced some members of the Media

Council.

On 8 December 1995, the Czech Parliament amended the Media Law, effective
1 January 1996. Among the most relevant modification was the deletion of Article
12(3) of the original Media Law, which stated that “In addition to conditions stated in
paragraph 2, the decision to grant a license also includes conditions which the
license-granting body will set for the broadcasting operator”. The Media Law in
Article 3 also contained a much narrower definition of the term “broadcaster” as the
person to whom a license had been granted (see also the memorandum of
Mrs. DeBruce of CME of 15 May 1996; Exhibit C111) (Exhibit R3).

On 2 January 1996, CET 21 applied to the Media Council for the cancellation of most

of the Conditions set in the License (Exhibit R31).

On 18 January 1996, the Media Council asked the District Court for Prague 1, acting
as authority for the Commercial Register, to re-examine CET 21’s and CNTS’s
registrations and to submit a report thereon, being noted that such request had already
been made on 2 February 1995, and was later repeated on 11 April 1996 (Exhibits
R30, R32 and R33).

On 12 February 1996, the Media Council requested Mr. Barta, at the State and Law
Institute of the Academy of Science of the Czech Republic, to provide an expert

opinion on CNTS’s authority to operate television broadcasting (Exhibit C27).

On 19 February 1996, Mr. Barta issued the requested expert opinion on the letterhead
of the State and Law Institute of the Academy of Science of the Czech Republic.
Based on the assumption that television broadcasting of TV Nova was operated by
CNTS, the author came to the conclusion that administrative proceedings could be
initiated to impose a fine for unauthorized broadcasting against CNTS. In addition, the

Media Council could decide to cancel the License of CET 21 (Exhibit R14).

On 13 March 1996, a meeting was held between the Media Council and CET 21.
Several issues were discussed, among them the relationship between CET 21 and
CNTS regarding the operation of television broadcasting. The Media Council was
concerned with the fact that CNTS was operating television broadcasting without
being the holder - or the co-holder - of the License. Mr. Zelezny, acting on behalf of
CET 21, argued that the current situation had been approved by the Media Council. At
the Media Council’s request, it was eventually agreed that a contract on the provision
of performances and services between CET 21 and CNTS would be drafted and
further discussed. It was also agreed that CET 21 would not require, in its application
for cancellation of license conditions dated 2 January 1996, the cancellation of
Condition 17. The application for cancellation of this specific condition would be the

subject of further administrative proceedings (Exhibit (C84).

On 21 March 1996, CET 21 applied for cancellation of Condition 17 (Exhibit R62).

19

91.

At some time in April 1996 and as requested at the meeting of 13 March CET 21 and
CNTS submitted to the Media Council two draft agreements setting forth their legal

relationships (Exhibit RIS).

On 2 May 1996, the State and Law Institute of the Academy of Science of the Czech
Republic provided the Media Council with a legal opinion on the two above
mentioned draft agreements between CET 21 and CNTS. It concluded that the
situation of CET 21 was correctly resolved, the key point being that CET 21, and not
CNTS, actually operated broadcasting on its own account (Exhibit R16).

On 15 May 1996, CME expressed its concern to Messrs. Zelezny and Fertig with
respect to the contemplated changes to the MOA resulting from the above mentioned
draft agreements. CME specifically referred to CET 21’s envisaged power to withdraw

CNTS’s use of the License if CNTS allegedly breached the agreement (Exhibit Cl11).

On 23 May 1996, after two additional meetings between the Media Council and CET
21 (Exhibits R105 and C85), CNTS and CET 21 entered into a new agreement
(hereinafter: “the May 1996 Agreement”) setting forth their legal relationships. The
Agreement stated in preamble that the MOA was not changed. In substance, it set forth
that CET 21 was the holder of the License and the operator of television broadcasting,
that the License was non-transferable, and was not the subject of a contribution from
CET 21 to CNTS. CNTS’s role was to arrange the television broadcasting (Exhibit
R17).

On 4 June 1996, the Media Council informed CET 21 that the latter had breached the
License by failing to timely announce changes in the registered capital, in the signing
process, and in the company’s registered office. It directed CET 21 and CNTS to
change their registrations with the Commercial Registry, in particular to modify

CNTS’s business activity with respect to “television broadcasting" (Exhibit R95).

In June 1996, the Supreme State Attorney Office requested the Media Council to
enable it to consult the files relating to the issue of the License to CET 21 and to

CNTS’s rights as the administrator of TV Nova. On this occasion, the Media Council

20

94.

95.

was informed that criminal investigations were pending with respect to CET 21’s and

CNTS’s rights to administer TV Nova (Exhibit R89).

On 28 and 29 June 1996, the Media Council held a meeting during which it decided to
cancel most of the Conditions to the License. The cancellation of Condition 17 was
postponed in light of the court proceedings with respect to the registration in the

Commercial Registry and the criminal investigation (Exhibit R56).

On 17 July 1996, CME purchased the 22% interest in CNTS held by CSB for a
consideration in excess of USD 36,000,000 (declaration of Mrs. DeBruce of 30 June
2000, p. 5; declaration of Mr. Radvan of 30 June 2000, p. 5). As a result, CME held
88% of CNTS’s stock, and CET 21 maintained its participation of 12% in CNTS.

On 22 July 1996, as its previous requests of 2 February 1995, 18 January and 11 April
1996, had been ignored, the Media Council asked the Regional Commercial Court in
Prague to start proceedings on compliance of CET 21’s and CNTS’s registrations in the

Commercial Register (Exhibit R36).

On 26 July 1996, the Media Council issued a decision regarding the cancellation of
most of the Conditions to the License, as per its above mentioned meeting of 28 and

29 June (Exhibit R35).

The same day, the Media Council issued a decision to interrupt the administrative
proceedings with respect to the envisaged cancellation of Condition 17 to the License

because of the pending criminal investigation (Exhibit R34).

On 23 July 1996, the Media Council decided to commence administrative proceedings
against CNTS for operating television broadcasting without authorization. CNTS was

informed of said decision the same day (Exhibits R37 and R18).

On 1 August 1996, CME and Mr. Zelezny entered into a loan agreement pursuant to
which the former would provide the latter with a loan of USD 4°700°000 for acquiring
from the other individual shareholders 47% of CET 21’s stock. The agreement

provided for Mr. Zelezny to exercise all his voting rights as directed by CME until full

21

100

102.

103.

repayment of the loan (Exhibit R38). As a result, the participation in CET 21 was as

follows:

* Mr. Zelemy: 60%

* The four remaining Founders: 37.5%
* CME: 1.25%
* CSB: 1.25%.

The Media Council was not informed of the change in CET 21’s ownership.

On 13 August 1996, the Institute of the State and Law of the Academy of Sciences of
the Czech Republic issued a legal opinion to CNTS pursuant to which the Media
Council was obliged to meet CET 21’s application to cancel the Conditions to the

Licence (Exhibit C28).

On 21 August 1996, CET 21 requested the Media Council to cancel Condition 17 to
the Licence (Exhibit R63).

On 4 October 1996, CET 21 and CNTS made proposals to the Media Council aimed at
resolving the differences with respect to the legal relationships between the two
companies. CET 21 and CNTS would enter into a new agreement providing that CET
21 is the operator of television broadcasting and is entirely responsible before the
Media Council. Both companies would request that their registrations with the
Commercial Register be modified. The Media Council, in turn, would continue the
administrative proceedings on the cancellation of Condition 17 to the License, and
would confirm that the arrangements between the two companies are in compliance
with legal regulations. However, there was no mention of the administrative
proceedings initiated by the Media Council against CNTS for unauthorized conducting

of television broadcasting (Exhibit R19).

The same day, CNTS provided the Media Council with its position with respect to the
initiation of the administrative proceedings against it. It denied the allegation of

unauthorized television broadcasting (Exhibit C26).

109.

The same day, CET 21 and CNTS signed an agreement (hereinafter: “the October
1996 Agreement”) specifying their legal relationships as set forth in the amended
MOA. The October 1996 Agreement was similar to the May 1996 Agreement. The
main difference was in the October 1996 Agreement’s statement that such agreement

did not affect CET 21’s exclusive liability for the programming (Exhibit R21).

On 6 November 1996, the Media Council’s legal department issued an internal
memorandum on the legal aspects of the October 1996 Agreement. It stated that said
agreement “undoubtedly reacts to the commencement of administrative proceedings
against CNTS for illegal broadcasting with the aim of making it seem that CNTS has
not been committing such illegal acts”. The memorandum nevertheless expressed
some doubts if the October 1996 Agreement fully achieved this purpose (Exhibit
R96).

On 14 November 1996, CME issued a memorandum expressing its concern about the
contemplated amendment of Article 1.4.1 of the MOA. CME’s main fear was that the
draft amendment would allow CET 21 to chose another party to benefit from the

License (Exhibit C112).

The same day, a meeting was held between CNTS’s shareholders, ie. CME, CSB and
CET 21. Article 1.4.1(a) of the MOA was amended and replaced as follows: “the
Company is granted the unconditional, irrevocable, and exclusive right to use and
maintain the know-how and make it the subject of profit to the Company, in connection
with the License, its maintenance, and protection”. In addition CNTS was granted the
right to acquire the License from CET 21 "ijn the case of change in the legal

regulation and in the prevailing interpretation of the legal community" (Exhibit C59).

On 20 November 1996, the Media Council expressed to the Police of the Czech
Republic its opinion that none of the Media Council’s members could be criminally

liable with respect to CNTS’s alleged illegal television broadcasting (Exhibit R66).

On 13 December 1996, the October 1996 Agreement was slightly amended (Exhibit
R21).

On 17 December 1996, the Media Council decided to cancel Condition 17 to the
Licence (Exhibits R57 and C30).

In December 1996, CME acquired from CET 21 a 52% participation in CNTS for a
consideration of about USD 5,300,000. During the same period, the Founders of CET
21 transferred an additional 5,8% interest to Nova Consulting a.s. (hereinafter: “Nova
Consulting”), a Czech company owned by Mr. Zelezny (declaration of Mrs. DeBruce
of 30 June 2000, p. 5; declaration of Mr. Radvan of 30 June 2000, p. 5). As a result,
the participation in CNTS was as follows:

* CME: 93.2%

« Nova Consulting: 5,8%

* The Founders: 1%.

On 29 January 1997, the Media Council, which had become aware of the loan
agreement between CME and Mr. Zelezny, held a meeting with CET 21 for the

purpose of obtaining information thereon from Mr. Zelezny (Exhibit R123).

On 5 February 1997, the October 1996 Agreement was amended to replace all
previous agreements between CET 21 and CNTS with respect to their legal

relationships (see Exhibit R21).

On 12 February 1997, CNTS’s registration in the Commercial Registry was modified
as to delete, under the company’s business, the sentence “operating television

broadcasting under license no. 001/93” (Exhibit R25).

On 21 April 1997, Mr. Radvan, counsel for CME, issued an affidavit stating that the
loan agreement between CME and Mr. Zelezny had been terminated pursuant to an

agreement entered into by the parties on 24 February 1997 (Exhibit C91).

On 15 May 1997, the criminal investigation against CNTS for alleged illegal operation

of television broadcasting was suspended (Exhibit R25).

On 21 May 1997, CNTS and CET 21 entered into an agreement named “Contract on

cooperation in ensuring service for television broadcasting,” together with a

24

119.

121.

3.3

supplement to this agreement (hereinafter: “the 1997 Agreement”), replacing all
previous agreements between the parties. The 1997 Agreement confirmed that CET 21
was the holder of the License and the operator of television broadcasting and had the
exclusive responsibility for programming. CNTS had the exclusive rights and

obligations to arrange services for television broadcasting (Exhibits C29 and R22).

The same day, CME transferred all its interests in CNTS to CME Czech Republic
B.V. (hereinafter: also “CME”), a Dutch company, for a consideration of

USD 52,723,613 (Exhibit C130).

On 1 July 1997, the Czech Parliament passed the Act on the Czech Republic Council
for Radio and Television Broadcasting, which represented a consolidated version of

the statute (Exhibit R7).

In August 1997, CME purchased Nova Consulting, which owned a 5.8% participation
in CNTS, from Mr. Zelezny for a consideration of USD 28,500,000. As a result, CME
held 99% of CNTS’s stock and the founders of CET 21 were left with a 1%
participation in CNTS (declaration of Mrs. DeBruce of 30 June 2000, p. 5; declaration
of Mr. Radvan of 30 June 2000, p. 5).

On 16 September 1997, the Media Council decided to stop the administrative
proceedings against CNTS for illegal operation of television broadcasting. The Media
Council’s main reasoning was that CNTS had "removed the inadequacies” by
modifying its registration with the Commercial Registry and by proceeding to

“amendments to the contractual relationship” with CET 21 (Exhibit R25).

The 1998-2000 events

On 31 January 1998, the Media Council issued its 1997 Report to the Czech
Parliament. The report contained a long statement of the Media Council’s relationship
with CNTS and CET 21. The Media Council explained that the legal relationship set

up at the time the License was granted complied with the law as it then was in force

we

124.

125.

and the Conditions to the License, mainly Conditions 17 and 18 had been issued in
accordance with the Law. When the Media Law was amended and provided for the
cancellation of all the Conditions, the Media Council protested on the ground that it
"practically lost every possibility of checking on CNTS and its relationship to CET2I.
(...) The situation changed fundamentally when the amendment of the broadcasting
law became effective. The licensing conditions that in principle guaranteed the legal
character of the existing links between the license holder and the servicing firms were
annulled and the Council had to solve the issue about how to attend, in the newly
formed situation, to the sharp loosening up of the regulatory possibilities. The Council
had an expertise made concerning the related issues and on the basis of it, initiated
gradually negotiations with the affected Companies and opened up administrative
proceedings in the subject of unauthorized broadcasting (...)". CET 21 and CNTS
took the necessary steps to carry out the necessary adjustments, by changing their
registrations in the Commercial Registry and the agreements setting forth their legal
relationships. These actions led to the termination of the administrative proceedings
for unauthorized television broadcasting. However, the Media Council’s decision was
not unanimous (5 in favor, 3 against and 1 abstention), and even reflected “the big

difference of opinions over this case” (Exhibit C12).

On 21 June 1998, Mr. Radvan, counsel for CME, had lunch with Mrs. Hulovaé, Vice
Chairman of the Media Council. According to Mr. Radvan, Mrs. Hulova said during
lunch that CNTS had become “the target for a group of disgruntled persons" (Exhibit
R102).

On 1 July 1998, the Media Council informed CET 21 that it was opening
administrative proceedings against the latter to revoke the License on the ground that
the television station was not providing information “in an objective and balanced

manner” (Exhibit R124).

On 17 November 1998, the Media Council decided to stop the above mentioned
administrative proceedings against CET 21, due to the fact that appropriate actions had

been taken (Exhibit R125).

129.

On 15 December 1998, CME and CET 21 amended the MOA so that all prior changes

were incorporated (Exhibit C60).

On 24 February 1999, a Meeting of the Board of Representatives of CNTS took place
during which the relationships between CET 21 and CME were discussed. The
Minutes of the meeting indicate that Mr. Zelezny reported that at least one member of
the Media Council had claimed that the actual situation contravened the law, and that
"the Council wants to change its original decision and to write a letter with the
statement that the present relationship between CET 21 and CNTS is not correct”.
Mr. Zelezny asserted that in his view, which he claimed was confirmed by his lawyers,
the 1997 Agreement was not exclusive and CET 21 could request any services then
provided by CNTS from any other company. He informed CNTS that, based on this
assertion, CET 21 would hire another advertising agency. He added that, “in case he
would be asked”, he would resign from his function of executive as well as General
Director of CNTS. He stated that “his proposal was an ultimatum, which meant that

CME could either accept or not” (Exhibit C31).

On 2 March 1999, the Media Council held a meeting to which Mr. Zelezny was
invited. According to the Minutes, CME’s alleged financial difficulties were discussed.
Mr. Zelezny, acting on behalf of CET 21, asked the Media Council to repeat some of
its previous statements about exclusivity and the withdrawal of the License “in
relation to all steps within the logic of the development of the relationships between
CET and the Council”. It was then stated that "[I]f Zelezny wants to affect the interests
of CNTS, he will need to be supported by a formal or informal letter” (Exhibit R97).

On 3 March 1999, Mr. Zelezny, on the letterhead of CET 21, sent a letter to the Media
Council requesting that the latter issue an opinion defining the relationship between
CET 21 and CNTS, to be used by CET 21"for discussions with our contractual
partners”. The opinion was to assert that "[rjelations between the operator of
broadcasting [CET 21] and its service organisations must be established on an
nonexclusive basis”. CET 21 “should order services from service organizations at
regular prices so as to respect rules of equal competition. (...) the licensed subject
must have the ability to select relevant services anytime and anywhere at will”

(Exhibit C33).

130

132.

133.

134

135.

136.

On 15 March 1999, the Media Council issued a letter to CET 21 laying out, inter alia,
the non-exclusive basis of the relations between the operator of broadcasting and the
service organizations, the operator’s responsibility for structuring and composing the
program, and the allocation to the operator of the revenues from advertising (Exhibit

34),

In March 1999, CME set up an action plan to deal with the tense situation with CET

21 (Exhibit R132).

On 19 April 1999, Mr. Zelezny was dismissed from his position as General Director

and Chief Executive of CNTS (Exhibit C68).

On 24 June 1999, CNTS requested the Media Council to give its position or to take
measures aimed at resolving the current dispute between CNTS, CME and CET 21,
resulting, among other reasons, from CET 21 entering into contracts with third parties,

which “were granted rights to trade benefits from the License” (Exhibit C39).

On 28 June 1999, after CNTS had positioned two commercial spots into television
broadcasting despite CET 21’s disapproval, the Regional Commercial Court in Prague
rendered a preliminary measure ordering CNTS to refrain from any interference with

television broadcasting operated by CET 21 (Exhibit C13).

On 13 July 1999, in the context of the Media Council’s opinion to the Permanent
Media Commission of the Parliament of the Czech Republic, CNTS provided the
Media Council with an analysis of its legal relationship with CET 21 (Exhibit C40).

On 26 July 1999, the Media Council sent a letter to CNTS calling it to stop its media
campaign in connection with its dispute with CET 21. CNTS was also to inform the
Media Council on the steps taken to minimize the risks described in its opinion to the
above-mentioned Commission, mainly the risks of breaches of the Media Law, and on
the actions taken to come to a final settlement of the dispute. Enclosed with this letter
were Sections 7 and 8 of the Media Council’s opinion to the Permanent Media

Committee with respect to the dispute between CET 21 and CNTS (Exhibit C44).

137.

143.

On 2 August 1999, CNTS and CME sent a letter to the Permanent Media Committee
of the House of Representatives of the Parliament of the Czech Republic in response
to Sections 7 and 8 of the Media Council’s opinion to the Permanent Media
Committee, a copy of which had been provided to CNTS with the Media Council’s
letter of 26 July 1999 (Exhibit C41), raising the question that the acts of the Media

Council might constitute violations of the Treaty.

On 5 August 1999, Mr. Rozehnal, counsel for CET 21, informed CNTS that CET 21
"hereby withdraws from the Agreement on Cooperation in Provision of Services for
Television Broadcasting, as amended, concluded on May 21, 1997”. This decision was
based on CNTS’s failure on 4 August 1999 to submit to CET 21 within the usual
deadline the Daily Log, which contains the daily programming, regarding the

broadcasting for the following day (Exhibit C35).

On 6 August 1999, CNTS filed a request with the Media Council for the withdrawal of
the License to CET 21 (Exhibit C42).

On 13 August 1999, CNTS informed the Media Council of its willingness to conduct
negotiations with CET 21 to resolve their dispute, and requested that CNTS and CME
be invited to the Media Council’s ordinary session to be held on 17 August 1999

(Exhibit C43).

On 16 August 1999, CET 21 sent a letter to CME Ltd. detailing the business
relationship between CET 21 and CNTS (Exhibit C13).

On 19 August 1999, Mr. Lauder initiated the present arbitration proceedings.

Numerous other court and arbitration proceedings opposing CNTS, CME, CET 21,

Mr. Lauder and/or Mr. Zelezny were commenced in the context of the disputes

between CNTS, CME and Mr. Lauder, on the one side, and CET 21 and Mr. Zelezny,

on the other side. In particular:

* CME initiated parallel UNCITRAL arbitration proceedings against the Czech
Republic on the basis of the bilateral investment treaty between the Netherlands

and the Czech Republic;

144

145.

146.

147.

148

149

* CME brought ICC arbitration proceedings against Mr. Zelemy (Exhibit R46);
* Numerous civil actions were commenced before the Czech courts, most of them

opposing CNTS and CET 21 (Exhibit R49).

On 19 September 1999, the Media Council issued a written opinion for the Permanent
Media Commission of the House of Deputies of the Parliament with respect to the
dispute between CET 21 and CNTS. It was qualified as a “typical commercial dispute”
related to the assessment of the real value of CME in the context of its merger with
Scandinavian Broadcasting Services. Generally, this dispute could be identified as an
issue of relations between the broadcaster, investors and service organizations,
resulting from insufficiently transparent arrangements and leading to a _ dual
broadcasting system. Similar problems were encountered with almost all nationwide

broadcasters (Exhibit C68).

On 30 September 1999, the Standing Committee for Mass Media of the House of
Representatives of the Czech Republic issued a resolution stating its serious
dissatisfaction with the work of the Media Council in the context of the dispute

between CNTS and CET 21 (Exhibit C108).

On 15 November 1999, the Media Council provided the Permanent Commission for
the Media of the House of Representatives of the Czech Republic with a supplement to

its position on the situation of TV Nova (Exhibit R126).

On 21 December 1999, the Media Council rendered a decision pursuant to which
CME could be a party to the administrative proceedings regarding changes in the
License at CET 21’s request (increase in the registered capital, changes in the

participants and values of their capital contributions) (Exhibit C50).

As a result of the end of the relationships between CET 21 and CNTS, the latter had to
take drastic measures to cut its spending, e.g. to lay off many employees (Exhibit

C38).

On 4 May 2000, the Regional Commercial Court in Prague decided that CET 21 was

obligated to procure all services for television broadcasting exclusively through

30

150.

41

153.

154.

CNTS. However, the Court refused to decide that CET 21’s withdrawal from the 1997
Agreement was invalid, nor to confirm the existence of CNTS’s exclusive right on the

basis of the 1997 Agreement (Exhibit C54).

On | June 2000, CET 21 filed an appeal against the above mentioned judgment with
the High Court in Prague (Exhibit C55).

On 14 December 2000, the High Court in Prague granted CET 21’s appeal and decided
that CET 21 was not obligated to procure all services for television broadcasting

exclusively through CNTS (Exhibit R134).

The case is now pending before the Czech Supreme Court.

Jurisdiction and Admissibility

Introduction

At various stages of the proceedings, the Respondent challenged the Arbitral

Tribunal’s jurisdiction on several grounds:

a) The Claimant has failed to prove that he owns or controls an investment within the
Czech Republic;

b) The Claimants claim is not an investment dispute under the Treaty;

c) The Claimant already submitted the same dispute to the courts of the Czech
Republic and to other arbitral tribunals (Article VI(3)(a) of the Treaty);

d) The Claimant may not concurrently pursue the same remedies in different fora;

e) The Claimant’s claim constitutes an abuse of process;

f) The Claimant did not comply with the six-month waiting period (Article VI(2)(a)
of the Treaty) (see Statement of Defence, p. 12-13; Response, p. 40-49; Sur-Reply,
p. 14-17).

In the Written Closing Submissions of 30 March 2001, the Respondent stated that it

did not dispute that:

31

155.

4.2

156.

157

158

e The Treaty is prima facie applicable to events occurring after 19 December 1992;

e Mr. Lauder is a national of the United States;

e CEDC’s (and later CME’s) shareholding in CNTS is an investment;

e The Claimant’s allegations constitute an investment dispute for the purpose of the
Treaty;

e For jurisdictional purpose only, the Claimant controlled the investment (see

Written Closing Submissions, p. 4-5).

The Arbitral Tribunal therefore takes note that the Respondent has withdrawn the two
grounds under a) and b) above. The Arbitral Tribunal will therefore only address the

four remaining grounds under c), d), e) and f) above.

The same dispute is submitted to state courts and to other arbitral tribunals

The Respondent argues that Article VI(3)(a) of the Treaty precludes the Arbitral
Tribunal from exercising jurisdiction on the ground that the same dispute was
submitted to Czech courts and to another arbitral tribunal before the present
proceedings were initiated. Those proceedings arise from the same circumstances and
seek the same substantive remedy, so that the issue in dispute is the same in all cases.
As a result, Mr. Lauder has removed the dispute from any arbitral tribunal under the

Treaty (Response, p. 47-48).

The Claimant argues that the present proceeding is the only one in which he claims
that the Czech Republic violated obligations under the Treaty. Article VI(3)(a)
actually sets forth a limited form of the principle of lis alibi pendens, whose elements

are not met (Reply Memorial, p. 50-62).
Article VI(3)(a) of the Treaty reads as follows:

"(...) Once the national or company concerned has so consented, either party to the

dispute may institute such proceeding provided:

159

160.

161

(i) the dispute has not been submitted by the national or the company for
resolution in accordance with any applicable previously agreed dispute-
settlement procedures; and

(ii) the national of company concerned has not brought the dispute before the
courts of justice or administrative tribunals or agencies of competent

jurisdiction of the Party that is a party to the dispute. (...)"

The Arbitral Tribunal considers that the word “dispute” in Article VI(3)(a) of the
Treaty has the same meaning as the words “investment dispute” in Article VI(1),

which reads as follows:

“For the purposes of this Article, an investment dispute is defined as a dispute
involving (a) the interpretation or application of an investment agreement between a
Party and a national or company of the other Party; (b) the interpretation or

application of any investment authorization granted by a Party's foreign investment
authority to such national or company; or (c) an alleged breach of any right conferred

or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment".

It is undisputed that the Claimant’s allegations concern an investment dispute under
Article VI(1)(c) of the Treaty, ie. “an alleged breach of any right conferred or created

by this Treaty with respect to an investment”.

The purpose of Article VI(3)(a) of the Treaty is to avoid a situation where the same
investment dispute (“the dispute”) is brought by the same the claimant (“the national
or the company”) against the same respondent (a Party to the Treaty) for resolution
before different arbitral tribunals and/or different state courts of the Party to the Treaty

that is also a party to the dispute.

The resolution of the investment dispute under the Treaty between Mr. Lauder and the
Czech Republic was not brought before any other arbitral tribunal or Czech court
before - or after - the present proceedings was initiated. All other arbitration or court
proceedings referred to by the Respondent involve different parties, and deal with

different — disputes.

168.

In particular, neither Mr. Lauder nor the Czech Republic is a party to any of the
numerous proceedings before the Czech courts, which opposed or are opposing CNTS
or the various CME entities, on the one side, and CET 2.1 or Mr. Zelezny, on the other
side. The Respondent has not alleged - let alone shown - that any of these courts

would decide the dispute on the basis of the Treaty.

The ICC arbitration proceeding was between CME and Mr. Zelezny, and dealt with
the latter’s alleged breach of the 11 August 1997 Share Purchase Agreement pursuant
to which CME acquired a 5.8% participation in CNTS held by Nova Consulting, as.

an entity owned by Mr. Zelezny.

The parallel UNCITRAL arbitration proceeding (hereinafter: “the Stockholm
Proceedings”) is between CME and the Czech Republic, and is based on the bilateral

investment treaty between the Netherlands and the Czech Republic.

Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal holds that Article VI(3)(a) of the Treaty does not

preclude it from having jurisdiction in the present proceedings.

The same remedies are sought in different fora

The Respondent argues that, independently of Article VI(3)(a) of the Treaty, the

Claimant cannot seek the same remedies in multiple parallel actions.

At first the Respondent asserted that if the Claimant chooses to pursue a contractual
remedy in the local courts or in an arbitral tribunal, he should not be allowed to
concurrently pursue a remedy under the Treaty. The Claimant could indeed not
complain of any mistreatment of his investment by the State until that State’s courts
had finally disposed of the case. In addition, by initiating proceedings under the
Treaty, the Claimant deprives the other party to the court proceedings of the
opportunity to argue its case before the Treaty tribunal. Here, the existence of multiple
proceedings creates a risk of incompatible decisions, a prospect of disorder "that the

principle of lis alibi pendens is designed to avert” (Response, p. 46-47).

34

69

170.

Later the Respondent indicated that it was not seeking “to rely upon technical
doctrines of lis alibi pendens or res judicata”, but on a new “important issue of
principle, not yet tested (...) in previous court or arbitral proceedings”. The
multiplicity of proceedings involving, directly or indirectly, the State "amounts to an
abuse of process”, in that no court or arbitral tribunal would be in a position to ensure
that justice is done and that its authority is effectively upheld. The Respondent added

that there is “an obvious risk of conflicting findings between the two Treaty tribunals”

(Sur-Reply, p. 14-15).

The Claimant argues that no principles of lis alibi pendens are applicable here. Should
such principles apply, it would not deprive the Arbitral Tribunal of jurisdiction, since
the other court and arbitration proceedings involve different parties, different claims,
and different causes of action. However, if CNTS could obtain any recovery from the
Czech courts, this may reduce the amount of damage claimed in the present

proceedings (Reply Memorial, p. 50-62).

The Arbitral Tribunal considers that the Respondent’s recourse to the principle of lis
alibi pendens to be of no use, since all the other court and arbitration proceedings
involve different parties and different causes of action (see 4.2 above). Therefore, no
possibility exists that any other court or arbitral tribunal can render a decision similar
to or inconsistent with the award which will be issued by this Arbitral Tribunal, i.e.
that the Czech Republic breached or did not breach the Treaty, and is or is not liable

for damages towards Mr. Lauder.

It is to be noted that the risk of conflicting findings is even less possible since the
Claimant withdrew his two reliefs on the imposition of conditions to the License and
the enforcement of such conditions, and only maintained its relief for damages.
Assuming that the Arbitral Tribunal would decide that the Respondent breached the
Treaty and that the Claimant is entitled to damages, such findings could not be
contradicted by any other court or arbitral decision. The damages which could be
granted in the parallel proceedings could only be based on the breach by CET 21
and/or Mr. Zelezny of their contractual obligations towards CNTS or any CME entity
(decision by Czech courts or the ICC arbitral tribunal) or on the breach by the Czech

Republic of its obligations towards CME pursuant to the Dutch/Czech bilateral

35

173.

174

175

4.4

176

investment treaty (decision by the parallel UNICTRAL arbitral tribunal). The only
risk, as argued by the Claimant, is that damages be concurrently granted by more than
one court or arbitral tribunal, in which case the amount of damages granted by the
second deciding court or arbitral tribunal could take this fact into consideration when

assessing the final damage.

There might exist the possibility of contradictory findings of this Arbitral Tribunal and
the one set up to examine the claims of CME against the Czech Republic under the
Dutch-Czech Bilateral Investment treaty. Obviously, the claimants in the two
proceedings are not identical. However, this Arbitral Tribunal understands that the
claim of Mr. Lauder giving rise to the present proceeding was commenced before the
claims of CME was raised and, especially, the Respondent itself did not agree to a de
facto consolidation of the two proceedings by insisting on a different arbitral tribunal

to hear CME’s case.

Finally, there is no abuse of process in the multiplicity of proceedings initiated by
Mr. Lauder and the entities he controls. Even assuming that the doctrine of abuse of
process could find application here, the Arbitral Tribunal is the only forum with
jurisdiction to hear Mr. Lauder’s claims based on the Treaty. The existence of
numerous parallel proceedings does in no way affect the Arbitral Tribunal’s authority
and effectiveness, and does not undermine the Parties’ rights. On the contrary, the
present proceedings are the only place where the Parties’ rights under the Treaty can be

protected.

Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal holds that the seeking of the same remedies in a

different fora does not preclude it from having jurisdiction in the present proceedings.

The abuse of process

Besides the already addressed issue of alleged abuse of process in connection with the
fact that the same remedies are sought in different fora (see 4.3 above), the

Respondent argues that the Claimant commits an abuse of process (i) in pursuing his

36

177

178

179.

180.

claim in the present proceedings under the Treaty whereas it is alleged in the parallel
arbitration proceedings that CME has a better claim, and (ii) in not disclosing a prima

facie case that the Respondent has breached the Treaty (Response, p. 48-49).

The Arbitral Tribunal does not see any abuse of process by the Claimant’s pursuit of
his claim in the present proceedings and by CME’s pursuit of its claim in the parallel
arbitration proceedings. As already stated (see 4.3 above), the claimants and the causes
of action are not the same in the two cases. Only this Arbitral Tribunal can decide
whether the Czech Republic breached the Treaty towards Mr. Lauder, and only the
arbitral tribunal in the parallel Stockholm Proceedings can decide whether the Czech
Republic breached the Dutch/Czech bilateral investment treaty in relation to CME. As
a result, CME has neither a better - nor a worse - claim in the parallel arbitration
proceedings than Mr. Lauder’s claim in the present arbitration proceedings. It only has

a different claim.

It should furthermore be noted that the Respondent refused to allow the constitution of
identical arbitral tribunals to hear both treaty cases. If the same tribunal would have
been appointed in both cases the procedure could have been co-ordinated with the
corresponding reduction in work and time and of cost to the Parties. The possibility of

conflicting decisions would also have been greatly reduced.

There is also no abuse of process by the Claimant’s alleged non-disclosure of a prima
facie case that the Respondent has breached the Treaty. No such obligation derives
from the Treaty or from the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. Even less would the
absence of such disclosure result in the Arbitral Tribunal lacking jurisdiction.
Furthermore, as stated hereunder, the Claimant actually disclosed more than just a

prima facie case against the Respondent.

Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal holds that there is no abuse of process on the part of
the Claimant which would preclude it from having jurisdiction in the present

proceedings.

181

183.

184

The six-month waiting period

The Respondent argues that the Claimant did not comply with the waiting period set
forth in Article VI(3)(a) of the Treaty pursuant to which arbitration can be initiated
only six months after the dispute arose. For the purpose of this provision, the dispute
arises when the State is advised that a dispute exists. Here, the Czech Republic was
first advised of Mr. Lauder’s complaints under the Treaty by CNTS’s and CME’s letter
to the Media Committee of the Czech Parliament of 2 August 1999. Therefore, the
Notice of Arbitration served only 17 days later is defective, and the Arbitral Tribunal

lacks jurisdiction (Statement of Defence, p. 13; Written Closing Submissions, p. 5).

The Claimant argues that the Respondent has waived or abandoned this objection by
not having advanced it between its Statement of Defence of 31 January 2000 and its
Written Closing Submissions of 30 March 2001 (Rebuttal to The Respondent’s Written
Closing Submission, p. 4-5).

Article VI(3)(a) of the Treaty reads as follows:

"At any time after six months from the date on which the dispute arose, the national or
company concerned may choose to consent in writing to the submission of the dispute

for settlement by conciliation or binding arbitration (...)

The Arbitral Tribunal considers that, as stated above with respect to the Respondent’s
other objection based on Article VI(3)(a) of the Treaty (see 4.2 above), the word
“dispute” in the context of the six-month waiting period shall have the same meaning
as the words “investment dispute” in Article VI(I), ie. in this case “an alleged breach

of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment”.

However, the waiting period does not run from the date at which the alleged breach
occurred, but from the date at which the State is advised that said breach has occurred.
This results from the purpose of the waiting period, which is to allow the parties to

enter into good-faith negotiations before initiating arbitration.

186.

187.

188.

189.

Here, the Respondent’s alleged violations of the Claimant’s rights under the Treaty
occurred during the period from February 1993, when the License was granted, until
15 March 1999, when the Media Council sent a letter to CET 21 expressing its opinion
on the requirements of television broadcasting (see Summary of Summation, p. 1-9).
No evidence was, however, put forward that the Czech Republic was advised of said
alleged Treaty violations before CNTS’s and CME’s 2 August 1999 letter to the Media
Committee of the Czech Parliament. Only 17 days lie between said letter and the filing
of the Notice of Arbitration on 19 August 1999.

However, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that this requirement of a six-month waiting
period of Article VI(3)(a) of the Treaty is not a jurisdictional provision, i.e. a limit set
to the authority of the Arbitral Tribunal to decide on the merits of the dispute, but a
procedural rule that must be satisfied by the Claimant (Ethyl Corp. v. Canada,
UNCITRAL June 24, 1998, 38 LL.M. 708 (1999), paragraphs 74-88). As stated above,
the purpose of this rule is to allow the parties to engage in good-faith negotiations

before initiating arbitration.

Here, although there were only 17 days between CNTS’s and CME’s letter to the
Media Committee of the Czech Parliament of 2 August 1999 and the filing of the
Notice of Arbitration on 19 August 1999, there is no evidence that the Respondent
would have accepted to enter into negotiation with Mr. Lauder or with any of the
entities he controlled and which were involved in the dispute during the waiting
period. On the contrary, the Media Council did not react at all to CNTS’s letter of 13
August 1999 requesting that CNTS and CET 21 be invited to the Media Council’s
ordinary session to be held on 17 August 1999 in order to try to find a solution to their

dispute (Exhibit C43).

Furthermore, the Respondent did not propose to engage in negotiations with the
Claimant following the latter’s statement in his Notice of Consent of 19 August 1999,
filed together with the Notice of Arbitration, that he remained “open to any good faith
efforts by the Czech Republic to remedy this situation”. Had the Respondent been
willing to engage in negotiations with the Claimant, in the spirit of Article VI(3)(a) of
the Treaty, it would have had plenty of opportunities to do so during the six months

after the 19 August 1999 Notice of Arbitration.

39

190

191

193.

194.

To insist that the arbitration proceedings cannot be commenced until 6 months after
the 19 August 1999 Notice of Arbitration would, in the circumstances of this case,
amount to an unnecessary, overly formalistic approach which would not serve to

protect any legitimate interests of the Parties.

Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal holds that the requirement of the six-month waiting
period in Article VI(3)(a) of the Treaty does not preclude it from having jurisdiction in

the present proceedings.

Findings

Introduction

The Claimant alleges that the Respondent, through the Media Council actions, has
breached five independent obligations under the Treaty within three separate time

periods.

The five obligations are the followings:

a) the prohibition against arbitrary and discriminatory measures;

b) the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment;

c) the obligation to provide full protection and security;

d) the obligation of treatment in accordance with general principles of international
law;

e) the obligation not to expropriate unlawfully (Reply Memorial, p. 62; Summary of

Summation, p. 13-14).

The three time periods are the followings:

a) the 1993-1994 period;

b) the 1996-1997 period;

c) the 1998-1999 period (see Mr. Kiernan’s oral opening submission, 5 March 2001,
p. 18).

40

195.

5.2

196.

197.

The Arbitral Tribunal feels it appropriate to address the issues in the following order:
a) the obligation not to expropriate unlawfully with respect to all time periods;
b) the obligation of treatment in accordance with the general principles of international
law with respect to all time periods;
c) all remaining alleged violations of the Treaty within the 1992-1993 time period;
d) all remaining alleged violations of the Treaty within the 1994-1997 and 1998-1999

time periods.

The obligation not to expropriate unlawfully (all time periods,

The Claimant alleges that the Media Council committed unlawful expropriation by
instituting administrative proceedings against CNTS in 1996 and by other actions that
forced CNTS to amend the MOA, as well as by the accumulation of actions and
inactions over the period from 1996 through 1999 to which the Claimant never
consented voluntarily or otherwise. The Claimant precisely referred to (i) the 1996
administrative and criminal proceedings, (ii) the indication by the Media Council in
1998 and thereafter that it did not accept an exclusive business relationship between
CET 21 and CNTS, coupled with the Media Council’s continued pressures to
restructure said relationship, (iii) the Media Council’s 15 March 1999 letter to CET 21,
and (iv) the Media Council’s refusal to take action against CET 21 when the latter
severed all dealings with CNTS (Reply Memorial, p. 73-77).

The Claimant argues that the Treaty protects foreign investors from direct and indirect
expropriation, i.e. not only from the taking of tangible property, but also from
measures tantamount to expropriation. Expropriation includes interference by the State
in the use of property or with the enjoyment of its benefits, even if legal title to the
property is not affected. There is even heightened protection against deprivations
resulting from regulatory actions when the acquired rights have obtained legal
approval on which investors justifiably rely. The intent of the State to deprive the
investor of property is not a necessary element of expropriation. There is no regulatory

exception (Memorial, p. 50-52; Reply Memorial, p. 63-73).

41

198.

199.

200.

The Respondent argues that, although the Treaty includes both direct and indirect
forms of expropriation, interference with property rights has to be so complete as to
amount to a taking of those rights. Detrimental effect on the economic value of
property is not sufficient. Parties to the Treaty are not liable for economic injury that is
the consequence of bona fide regulation within the accepted police powers of the
State. The Respondent asserts that the lawful commencement of administrative
proceedings against CNTS in 1996 in respect of a suspected violation of the law did
not constitute expropriation. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the Media Council
threatened to revoke the License. In addition, CNTS and/or Mr. Lauder made no
mention of expropriation before the Notice of Arbitration was filed on 19 August
1999. Finally, Mr. Lauder failed to prove that the Czech Republic caused CET 21 to
withdraw from its contractual relationship with CNTS, the acts of the latter’s
contractual counter-party not constituting expropriation by the State (Response, p. 50-

55; Written Closing Submissions, p. 9-10).
Article TII(1) of the Treaty provides:

"Investments shall not be expropriated or nationalized either directly or indirectly
through measures tantamount to expropriation or nationalization ("expropriation")
except for a public purpose; in accordance with due process of law; in a
nondiscriminatory manner; upon payment of prompt, adequate and_ effective
compensation; and in accordance with the general principles or treatment provided for

in Article IN(2)"

The Bilateral Investment Treaties (hereinafter: "BITs") generally do not define the
term of expropriation and nationalization, or any of the other terms denoting similar
measures of forced dispossession (“dispossession”, “taking”, “deprivation”, or
“privation”). Furthermore, the practice shows that although the various terms may be
used either alone or in combination, most often no distinctions have been attempted
between the general concept of dispossession and the specific forms thereof. In
general, expropriation means the coercive appropriation by the State of private
property, usually by means of individual administrative measures. Nationalization

involves large-scale takings on the basis of an executive or legislative act for the

42

201

wD

Ss

purpose of transferring property or interests into the public domain. The concept of
indirect (or “de facto”, or “creeping”) expropriation is not clearly defined. Indirect
expropriation or nationalization is a measure that does not involve an overt taking, but
that effectively neutralizes the enjoyment of the property. It is generally accepted that
a wide variety of measures are susceptible to lead to indirect expropriation, and each
case is therefore to be decided on the basis of its attending circumstances (Rudolf
Dolzer & Margrete Stevens, Bilateral Investment Treaties, p. 98-100 (1995); Georgio
Sacerdoti, Bilateral Treaties and Multilateral Instruments on Investment Protection,
379-382 (1997)). The European Court of Human Rights in Mellacher and Others v.
Austria (1989 Eur.Ct.H.R. (ser. A, No. 169)), held that a "formal" expropriation is a
measure aimed at a “transfer of property", while a “de facto” expropriation occurs

when a State deprives the owner of his “right to use, let or sell (his) property”.

The Arbitral Tribunal holds that the Respondent did not take any measure of, or
tantamount to, expropriation of the Claimant’s property rights within any of the time
periods, since there was no direct or indirect interference by the Czech Republic in the

use of Mr. Lauder’s property or with the enjoyment of its benefits.

The Claimant has indeed not brought sufficient evidence that any measure or action
taken by the Czech Republic would have had the effect of transferring his property or
of depriving him of his rights to use his property or even of interfering with his
property rights. All property rights of the Claimant were actually fully maintained
until the contractual relationship between CET 21 and CNTS was terminated by the
former. It is at that time, and at that time only, that Mr. Lauder’s property rights, ie.
the use of the benefits of the License by CNTS, were affected. Up to that time, CNTS
had been in a position to fully enjoy the economic benefits of the License granted to
CET 21, even if the nature of the legal relationships between the two companies had
changed over the time. Because the Claimant has not alleged - and even less proved -
that the action which seriously interfered with the Claimants property rights, ie. CET
21’s decision to withdraw from the 1997 Agreement on 5 August 1999, was one of the
State, and not one of a private entity completely independent of the State, there can be

no expropriation under the Treaty.

53

In addition, even assuming that the actions taken by the Media Council in the period
from 1996 trough 1999 had the effect of depriving the Claimant of his property rights,
such actions would not amount to an appropriation - or the equivalent - by the State,
since it did not benefit the Czech Republic or any person or entity related thereto, and
was not taken for any public purpose. It only benefited CET 21, a independent private

entity owned by private individuals.

Finally, the Claimant, directly or through CNTS or any other entity controlled by
himself, did not complain of any action taken by the Media Council and which
allegedly constituted an expropriation, or a measure tantamount to expropriation,
before CME’s and CNTS’s letter to the Czech Parliament of 2 August 1999, after
Mr. Zelezny had been dismissed of his functions with CNTS and at a time of great
tensions between CNTS and CET 21. This failure by the Claimant to invoke the
Treaty or to advance any violation of the obligations of the Czech Republic when the
now disputed actions were taken, tends to show that no violations of his property

rights were committed at that time.

The obligation of treatment in accordance with general principles of international
law (all time periods)

The Claimant alleges that the Media Council violated its obligations arising under
international law when it withdrew its prior approval of CNTS’s activities, and by
committing "the same wrongs that establish its breach of other individual protections
under the Treaty” (Reply Memorial, p. 89; Mr. Kiernan’s oral closing submissions, p.

177-178).

The Claimant argues that the general principles of international law include, among
others, a variant of pacta sunt servanda, the protection of acquired rights, the
treatment of foreign investment in good faith, the principle of estoppel, and recognized
standards relating to the protection of property. These general standards refer
exclusively to international law, to the exclusion of domestic law (Reply Memorial, p.

88-89; Mr. Kiernan’s oral closing submissions, p. 177-178).

44

209

210

54

5.4.1

The Respondent argues that the Claimant has not identified any obligation of
treatment in accordance with general principles of international law which is distinct

to the other obligations (Written Closing Submissions, p. 14).

Article II(2)(a) of the Treaty provides that "/iJnvestment (...) shall in no case be

accorded treatment less than that which conforms to principles of international law”.

The Arbitral Tribunal considers that the Claimant has not identified any specific
obligation of international law which would provide the foreign investor with a
broader protection than the other four Treaty obligations on which he otherwise relies.
In particular, the Claimant does not allege that either the variant of the principle pacta
sunt servanda, which would create under certain circumstances a sui generis investor-
state relationship, or the general obligation of good faith goes further in the protection
of the foreign investor than the Respondent’s obligation to provide fair and equitable
treatment (see below 5.5.3) or the Respondent’s obligation to provide full protection
and security (see below 5.5.4). On the contrary, by stating that the Respondent’s
alleged “breach of the obligation to adhere to general international law arises from
the same wrongs that establish its breach of other individual protections under the
Treaty”, the Claimant himself recognizes that there is no action or inaction by the
Czech Republic which could amount exclusively to a violation of the obligation of
treatment in accordance with general principles of international law, without also

constituting a violation of other obligations under the Treaty.

Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal will refer to the developments made in the other

sections of the present award.

The 1992-1993 time period

Introduction

Because the Claimant, in his more general statement about the “sotality of other

actions and inactions by the Media Council”, expressly refers to the rights provided to

45

CNTS, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that his allegation of unfair and inequitable
treatment does not cover the events leading to the creation of CNTS and the
replacement of the Media Council, ic. the first time period in 1993-1994, but includes

only the second and third time periods in 1996-1997 and 1998-1999.

212. With respect to the separate obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment, the
Claimant alleged that the Respondent breached said obligation through the Media
Council’s reversal of critical prior approvals, ie. when the Media Council directed in
1996 the removal in the MOA of the provision giving CNTS the exclusive right to use,
benefit from and maintain the License, and through its hostile conduct towards CNTS,
ie. the totality of other actions and inactions by the Media Council that undermined
the rights which had been provided to CNTS (Reply Memorial, p. 77-83; Summary of

Summation, p. 13).

213 The only identified alleged violation of specific Treaty obligations within the 1992-
1994 time period concerns the prohibition against arbitrary and discriminatory
measures. Such measures occurred when the Media Council insisted on CEDC not
becoming a direct shareholder of CET 21 in 1993 (Reply Memorial, p. 87;
Mr. Kiernan’s oral closing submissions, 12 March 2001, p. 175).

5.4.2 The prohibition against arbitrary and discriminatory measures

214. The Claimant alleges that the Respondent took arbitrary and discriminatory measures
when the Media Council insisted in 1993 on CEDC not becoming a direct shareholder
of CET 21. The Claimant argues that the prohibition against arbitrary and
discriminatory measures must be inferred from the circumstances. It is not necessary
that a measure be founded on a violation of domestic law for such a measure to be
arbitrary and/or discriminatory. Arbitrary action may actually include regulatory
actions without good-faith governmental purpose (Memorial, p. 54; Reply Memorial,
p. 85-88; Mr. Kiernan’s closing submissions, Transcript of 12 March 2001, p. 175-176;

Summary of Summation, p. 14).

The Respondent argues that Article II(2)(b) of the Treaty, in comparison with Article
TI(1), requires the Claimant to prove that the Respondent’s conduct was both arbitrary
and discriminatory. Only an illegal act under domestic law can be - but is not
necessarily - arbitrary, and the Claimant did not even prove that the Czech Republic
behaved unlawfully. For an act to constitute discrimination, it must first result in
actual injury and, second, it must be done with the intention to harm the aggrieved
party. In particular, there is no discrimination in the requirement that foreign investors
invest in the State through the medium of a locally-incorporated company, since it is
only a regulation on how foreign investment is to be organized. Here, the Media
Council awarded the License on the precise terms of CET 21’s application, pursuant to
which CEDC would become a minor shareholder in CET 21. The CNTS structure was
proposed by CEDC (Response, p. 56-57; Written Closing Submissions, p. 12-13).

Article II(2)(b) of the Treaty provides:

“Neither Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary and discriminatory measures the
management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition, expansion, or
disposal of investment. For the purpose of dispute resolution under Articles VI and VII,
a measure may be arbitrary and discriminatory notwithstanding the fact that a party
has had or has exercised the opportunity to review such measure in the courts or

administrative tribunals of a Party”.
Article II(1) of the Treaty reads as follows:

“Each Party shall permit and treat investment, and activities associated therewith, on a
nondiscriminatory basis, subject to the right of each Party to make or maintain

exceptions falling within one of the sectors or matters listed in the Annex to this Treaty.

(.)"
Clause 3 of the Annex to the Treaty provides:

“Consistent with Article II, paragraph 1, the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic
reserves the right to make or maintain limited exceptions to national treatment in the

sectors or matters it has indicated below:

47

219

we

we

ownership of real property; and insurance”.

The Arbitral Tribunal considers that a violation of Article II(2)(b) of the Treaty
requires both an arbitrary and a discriminatory measure by the State. It first results
from the plain wording of the provision, which uses the word “and” instead of the
word “or”. It then results from the existence of Article II(1) of the Treaty, which sets
forth the prohibition of any discriminatory treatment of investment, except in the
sectors or matters expressly listed in the Annex to the Treaty. If Article II(2)(b)
prohibited only arbitrary or discriminatory measures, it would be partially redundant

to the prohibition of discriminatory measure set forth in Article II(1).

A discriminatory measure is defined in Article II(1) and the Clause 3 of the Annex to
the Treaty. It is one that fails to provide the foreign investment with treatment at least
as favorable as the treatment of domestic investment (“national treatment”: see Annex
3 to the Treaty). For a measure to be discriminatory, it does not need to violate
domestic law, since domestic law can contain a provision that is discriminatory
towards foreign investment, or can lack a provision prohibiting the discrimination of
foreign investment. It is only in the sectors or matters for which it has reserved the
right to make or maintain an exception in the Annex to the Treaty that the State may
treat foreign investment less favorably than domestic investment. Due to the fact that
the Czech Republic has not made any reserve in the matter of broadcasting television,
contrary to the reserve made by the United States of America in the matter of
“ownership and operation of broadcast or common carrier radio and _ television
stations” (Clause 1 of the Annex to the Treaty; Exhibits Rl and Cl), the Czech
Republic is bound to provide U.S. investment in the field of broadcasting with a

treatment at least as favorable as Czech investment.

The Treaty does not define an arbitrary measure. According to Black’s Law
Dictionary, arbitrary means "depending on individual discretion; (...) founded on
prejudice or preference rather than on reason or fact” (Black’s Law Dictionary 100

(7th ed. 1999).

5.4.2.1 CEDC not becoming a shareholder in CET 21

we

we

we

The Arbitral Tribunal holds that the Czech Republic took a discriminatory and
arbitrary measure against Mr. Lauder in violation of Article II(2)(b) of the Treaty
when the Media Council, after having accepted the idea of a direct investment in
CET 21 by CEDC , a company which Mr. Lauder controlled, eventually did not allow

such investment, and required that a third company, CNTS, be created.

There is clear evidence that CEDC intended to acquire a direct participation in CET
21, should the latter be awarded the License. The draft “Terms of Agreement”
prepared by CEDC and CET 21 in August 1992 (Exhibit C139) as well as the final
version of this document signed by both companies in January 1993 (Exhibit C61)
expressly referred to "an equity investment in CET 21" from CEDC. The document
named “Project of an Independent Television Station” drafted by CET 21 in
September 1992 stated that CEDC is “a direct participant in CET 21's application for
the license" (Exhibit C9).

There is also clear evidence that the Media Council was aware of such intention. The
Minutes of the preliminary hearings held on 21 December 1992 by the Media Council
with the various bidders for TV Nova stated, as regards CET 21, that “extensive share
[is] reserved for foreign capital; (...) direct capital share, not credit”(Exhibit R58).
The Minutes of the further preliminary hearings held on 22 January 1993 provided that
"[t]he participation of foreign capital is expected” and that “the combination of
domestic and foreign capital is important, necessity of safeguard - diversification of
the investments sources” (Exhibit C64). The Minutes of the session of the Media
Council of 30 January 1993, where the decision to award the License to CET 21 was
made, stated some member’s of the Media Council’s words that “(...) it is very
significant that this is a business which can not be financed only by credit”, “the Czech
and foreign capital in CET 21 [is] positive’, and it is “positive in that there is a
stabilisation factor, as far as foreign capital and its involvement is concerned”

(statements of Messrs. Broz and Pycha; Exhibit R54).

The above mentioned statements also clearly indicate that the Media Council had
accepted, and even was satisfied with, the fact that CEDC would be a shareholder of
CET 21. As a result, this Tribunal Arbitral considers that there can be no doubt that
when the Media Council informed CET 21 in its letter of 30 January 1993 (Exhibit
R9) and the public in its press release of the same day (Exhibit C11) that the License
had been granted to CET 21 and that "faj] direct participant in the application is the
international corporation CEDC”, the Media Council agreed and approved meant that

CEDC would be a shareholder of CET 21.

Even assuming that the Media Council thought of another form of participation of
CEDC at the time it made the decision to award the License to CET 21, CEDC could
reasonably believe that its project of becoming a shareholder in CET 21 had been
properly understood and accepted by the Media Council. At no time until the decision
was made did the Media Council express any misunderstanding or dissatisfaction with

such project.

The various statements of the members and staff of the Media Council in the
beginning of 1993 submitted in the present proceedings, the immediate rising of strong
political opposition to the Media Council’s choice in favor of CET 21, and the overall
circumstances of the case show that the Media Council realized immediately after the
decision on the award of the License had been made that it had to bring some
modifications to the project of CET 21 and CEDC. In particular, the Media Council
could no longer accept CEDC as a shareholder of CET 21, as it became clear from the
political reactions to the recent decision to award the License to CET 21 that even
stronger political opposition would arise, opening the way for an attack on the entire
selection process. The Media Council therefore gave CET 21 and CEDC the task of
proposing an acceptable structure (declaration of Mrs. Landova of 5 December 2000,
p. 6-7; declaration of Mr. Broz of 5 December 2000, p. 2-3; declaration of Mr. Pycha
of 21 December 2000, p. 1-3; Exhibits R83, C144 and C145).

As a result, CET 21 and CEDC prepared a document named “Overall Structure of a
New Czech Commercial Television Entity” pursuant to which CET 21 and CEDC
would jointly create a new Czech company which would have the exclusive use of the

License. The shareholders of the new company would be CET 21, CEDC and CSB,

50

we
3S
S

the last two of them providing the necessary funds. There was no mention anymore of
any direct participation of CEDC in CET 21 (Exhibits Cl4 and C149). After some
modifications were made at the request of the director of the Programming and
Monitoring Section of the Media Council, the final version of the document was
submitted to the Media Council on February 5, 1993 (Exhibits C150 and R55). On the
basis of this document, the Media Council rendered its decision to award the License
to CET 21, which stated that CEDC was a "contractual partner" of CET 21 (Exhibits
R10 and C16).

The 1997 Report of the Media Council to the Czech Parliament actually provides a
good summary of the actions and their motivations which took place between
30 January and 9 February 1993: “When granting the license to the Company CET 21,

for fear that a majority share of foreign capital in the license holder's Company might
impact the independence of full-format broadcasts, the Council assumed a
configuration that separates the investor from the license holder himself. That is how
an agreement came into existence (upon a series of remarks from the Council) by
which the Company CNTS was established the majority owner of which is
CEDC/CME".

The Arbitral Tribunal holds that the Media Council decision to move from a direct
participation by CEDC, a German company controlled by Mr. Lauder, an American
citizen, to a contractual relationship providing for the creation of a third company

amounted to an arbitrary and discriminatory measure.

The measure was discriminatory because it provided the foreign investment with a
treatment less favorable than domestic investment. It indeed results from the above
mentioned circumstances that the Media Council changed its mind because of its fear
that the strong and rising political opposition to the granting of the License to an entity
with significant foreign capital could lead to an attack on the entire selection process.
It is probable that if CEDC had been a Czech investor, there would have been no
political outcry, and the original plan of becoming a shareholder in CET 21 could have

been carried out.

wm
6

The measure was arbitrary because it was not founded on reason or fact, nor on the
law which expressly accepted “applications from companies with foreign equity

participation” (Exhibit R2), but on mere fear reflecting national preference.

However, there is no single piece of evidence that CEDC opposed, or protested
against, or even less fought against, this measure. On the contrary, it results from the
circumstances that CEDC immediately proposed a new structure in which it would
become a contractual partner of, rather than a shareholder in, CET 21. CEDC and its
successor CME actually accepted the measure without reservation for the next six
years, as long as it was able to conduct the joint venture profitably. It is only in the
context of the present proceedings, after CET 21 had terminated the contractual
relationship with CNTS, which was by that time fully controlled by CME, that CME
complained about the measure. Even the Notice of Arbitration did not refer to the

measure, which was first mentioned in the Memorial (p. 1-2).

The question therefore arises if the breach by the Respondent of its Treaty obligations
gives rise to any damages to be paid to the Claimant. It is most probable that if in 1993
Mr. Lauder’s investment in the Czech television could have been made directly in
CET 21, the Licence holder, the possible breach of any exclusive agreements in 1999
could not have occurred in the way it did. Even if the breach therefore constitutes one
of several “sine qua non” acts, this alone is not sufficient. In order to come to a finding
of a compensable damage it is also necessary that there existed no intervening cause
for the damage. In our case the Claimant therefore has to show that the last, direct act,
the immediate cause, namely the termination by CET 21 on 5 August 1999 (and the
preceding conclusions by CET 21 of service agreements with other service providers)
did not become a superseding cause and thereby the proximate cause. In other words,
the Claimant has to show that the acts of CET 21 were not so unexpected and so
substantial as to have to be held to have superseded the initial cause and therefore
become the main cause of the ultimate harm. This the Claimant has not shown. First of
all, the Claimant itself in 1993 did not protested against the change imposed by the
Media Council. Furthermore, it was completely impossible at that time to envisage
that the Claimant itself would actively participate in all those later steps which allowed
Mr. Zelezny to disengage himself from CNTS and to acquire control of CET 21 in

order to be able to pursue his own interests without having to rely on CME. These acts

52

235

5.5

5.5.1

236.

of CET 21, and through it by Mr. Zelezny, are the real cause for the damage which

apparently has been inflicted to the Claimant.

The arbitrary and discriminatory breach by the Respondent of its Treaty obligations
constituted a violation of the Treaty. The alleged harm was, however, caused in 1999
by the acts of CET 21, controlled by Mr. Zelezny. The 1993 breach of the Treaty was
too remote to qualify as a relevant cause for the harm caused. A finding on damages

due to the Claimant by the Respondent would therefore not be appropriate.

The 1994-1997 and 1998-1999 time periods

Introduction

Within the 1994-1997 and 1998-1999 time periods, the Claimant alleges that the

Respondent violated all five obligations under the Treaty (see above 5.1). As the

Arbitral Tribunal has already addressed the alleged violations of the obligation not to

expropriate unlawfully (see above 5.2) and of the obligation of treatment in

accordance with general principles of international law (see above 5.3) with respect to

all time periods, it will address the three other alleged violations in the context of the

events which occurred in the period from 1994 through 1999, ie.:

a) the prohibition against arbitrary and discriminatory measures;

b) the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment:

c) the obligation to provide full protection and security (Reply Memorial, p. 62-89;
Summary of Summation, p. 13-14).

5.5.2. The prohibition against arbitrary and discriminatory measures

237.

The Claimant alleges that the Respondent took arbitrary and discriminatory measures
(i) when the Czech Parliament replaced the Media Council in 1994, (ii) when the

Media Council initiated in 1996 the administrative proceedings against CNTS for

33

unauthorized television broadcasting, (iii) when the Media Council stated in its 1996
and 1998 reports that the target of its investigations was CNTS, and that the others did
not receive any attention: (iv) through ongoing efforts to eliminate the original
structure between CET 21 and CNTS in favor of non-exclusive contractual
arrangements; (v) by statements of a Media Council’s member, Mr. Stépanek, that
CNTS was promoting flight of Czech capital abroad; and (vi) when Mr. Josefik
admitted that it did not even occur to him to consider the interest of foreign investor
after Mr. Zelezny's request of March 2, 1999 (Reply Memorial, p. 87-88; Mr.
Kiernan’s closing submissions, Transcript of 12 March 2001, p. 175-176).

238. The Respondent mainly alleges that the Media Council did not discriminate in the
treatment of the Claimant’s investment. The administrative proceedings were initiated
because there were objective grounds for suspecting a breach of the law, especially
when similar proceedings were commenced against others in a similar situation.
Furthermore that the existence of anti-American feelings within the Czech Republic
was the result of a democratic freedom of expression (Response, p. 56-57; Written

Closing Submissions, p. 12-14).

239. As regards the content of the prohibition against discriminatory and arbitrary
measures, the Arbitral Tribunal refers to the developments made in the context of the

1992-1993 time period (see above 5.4.2).

5.5.2.1 The replacement of the Media Council

240. The Arbitral Tribunal holds that the replacement of the Media Council in 1994 did not

amount to an arbitrary and discriminatory measure of the Czech Republic.

241. There is indeed no evidence that this replacement was in any direct relation to the
involvement of Mr. Lauder in TV Nova, nor that it constituted in any manner a
discriminatory and arbitrary measure vis-a-vis the Claimant and his investment in
CNTS.

242.

243.

Furthermore, any country is entitled to organize its own organs as it pleases as long as
this does not result in a discriminatory and arbitrary measure against a foreign

investor, protected by the investment Treaty.

The replacement of the Media Council in 1994 as such did not cause any harm to

Mr. Lauder’s investment in the Czech Republic.

5.5.2.2The Media Council’s 1996 and 1998 reports, and Messrs. Stépanek 's and

244,

245.

246.

Josefik's statements

The Arbitral Tribunal holds that the Claimant’s allegations of discriminatory and
arbitrary measures with respect to the Media Council statements in its 1996 and 1998
reports that the target of its efforts was CNTS; to Mr. Stépanek's statements that CNTS
was promoting flight of Czech capital abroad; and to Mr. Josefik admission that it did
not even occur to him to consider the interest of foreign investor after Mr. Zelemy's

request of 2 March 1999, are clearly unfounded for similar reasons. Therefore, the

Arbitral Tribunal will examine these three allegations together.

First, the Media Council alleged statement in its 1996 and 1998 reports that its target
effort was CNTS does not constitute a “measure” under the Treaty. Such a statement
did indeed not have any direct effect on the Claimant’s investment, and it is not alleged
that it had such an effect. In the light most favorable to the Claimant, it may only have
been evidence of the Media Council’s intent to treat CNTS as a target in the context of
a measure contemporaneously taken by the Media Council. Therefore, such a

statement in itself cannot amount to an arbitrary and discriminatory measure.

Then, the alleged statements of Mr. Stépanek that CNTS was promoting flight of
Czech capital abroad does not constitute a “measure” under the Treaty either.
Furthermore, a statement by a member of the Media Council is not attributable as such
to the Media Council, and to the Czech Republic. On the contrary, it must be
considered as a personal opinion of said member, which may or may not reflect the

Media Council’s opinion on the subject. Therefore, it cannot amount to an arbitrary

55

247

and discriminatory measure. It apparently also did not occur to the Claimant that this
alleged measure would constitute a violation of the Treaty at the time the statement
was made, as this allegation of a violation of the Treaty was raised for the fist time in

the course of the present arbitration proceedings.

Finally, the alleged admission by Mr. Josefik that it did not even occur to him to
consider the interest of foreign investor after Mr. Zelezny’s request of 2 March 1999 is
also a personal statement, and, as such, does not constitute a “measure” under the
Treaty. In addition, it is not attributable to the Czech Republic. Therefore, it cannot
amount to an arbitrary and discriminatory measure. Apparently it did also not occur to

the Claimant until the August 2, 1999 letter of CNTS and CME (Exhibit C41)!

5.5.2.3 The initiation of the administrative proceedings

248.

249

The Arbitral Tribunal holds that the initiation in 1996 of the administrative
proceedings against CNTS for unauthorized television broadcasting did not constitute

an arbitrary and discriminatory measure of the Czech Republic.

There is indeed sufficient evidence that the Media Council thought - or could think -
that CNTS was violating the Media Law. The Media Council had indeed received
complaints from the public on the content of the programs of TV Nova. As regulatory
body for radio and television broadcasting, it was responsible, among other duties, for

ensuring the observance of the Media Law (Article 16(2)).

Article 3(1) of the Media Law, as amended with effect on 1 January 1996, set forth
that a broadcasting operator was one who had “acquired authorization to broadcasting
on the basis of law (a "broadcaster by law”) or being granted a license under this Act
(a “licensed broadcaster") or by registration under this Act (a “registered
broadcaster")“. According to Article 2(1)(a), broadcasting "means dissemination of
program services or pictures and sound information by transmitters, cable systems,

satellites and other means intended to be received by the public” (Exhibit R3).

56

wm

Here, the License had been granted to CET 21, and not to CNTS (Exhibits R10 and
C16). CNTS actually did not enter into any of the three categories of broadcaster
under Article 3(1) of the Media Law (broadcaster by law, licensed broadcaster and

registered broadcaster).

Several objective facts existed which could cast the doubt on whether CET 21 or
CNTS was actually operating the broadcasting of TV Nova. For instance, CNTS’s
entry into the Commercial Registry stated that its business activity was “operating
television broadcasting on the basis of the license no. 001/1003” (Exhibits R10 and
C16). CNTS had also directly entered into agreements with other companies for the
dissemination of broadcasting. In addition, Mr. Zelezny held at that time the position
equivalent to that of a Chief Operating Officer of both companies. Finally, most
activities in connection with TV Nova were performed from CNTS’s large premises in

Prague with an important staff, whereas CET 21 had a much smaller organization.

All these facts lead to a confusion of the roles actually played by CNTS and CET 21,
and the Media Council could legitimately fear that a situation had arisen where there

had been a de facto transfer of the License from CET 21 to CNTS.

Furthermore, the Media Council, upon its request, had been provided with an expert
opinion from Mr. Jan Barta from the State and Law Institute of the Academy of
Science of the Czech Republic stating that the License was issued to CET 21, and
therefore this company had to itself operate the broadcasting activities. Assuming that
broadcasting was actually operated by CNTS, administrative proceedings to impose a
fine could be initiated against the latter (Exhibits C27 and R14). In this respect, the
Arbitral Tribunal considers that this opinion was issued by the State and Law Institute
of the Academy of Science of the Czech Republic and not only by Mr. Barta
personally, since the Media Council’s letter requesting the opinion had been sent to

Mr. Barta at the Institute, and the opinion was issued on the Institute’s letterhead.

The commencement of the administrative proceedings against CNTS for alleged
unauthorized broadcasting constituted the normal exercise of the regulatory duties of

the Media Council. Therefore, this measure was not arbitrary.

256 In addition, administrative proceedings for unauthorized broadcasting were not only
initiated against CNTS, a company controlled by a foreign investor, but also against
two other companies, Premiera TV a.s. and Radio Alfa a.s. (Exhibits R37 and C22).
Although Radio Alfa was also controlled by CME in 1996 and thus can equally be

qualified as a foreign investor, Premiera TV was controlled by a domestic investor.

257. The Arbitral Tribunal considers that the Media Council decision to _ initiate
administrative proceedings against CNTS was objectively not discriminatory, since the
same measure was taken against Premiera TV, which was controlled by a domestic
investor. The foreign investment of Mr. Lauder was therefore not provided a treatment
less favourable than the domestic investment controlling Premiera TV. In this respect,
the Arbitral Tribunal is of the opinion that the Claimant’s allegation that the
consequences of the administrative proceedings were less serious for Premiera TV
than for CNTS is not relevant, because the measure itself is the same in both cases, i.e.
the existence of administrative proceedings for unauthorized _ broadcasting.
Discrimination can only occur when the measure against foreign investment and the
measure against domestic investment are of a different nature, and the former is less

favourable than the latter.

258 Therefore, the initiation of the administrative proceedings against CNTS was also not

discriminatory.

259. This being said, the Arbitral Tribunal notes that neither CNTS nor CME raised any
objection at the time the administrative proceedings were initiated that this action was
in violation of any Czech law let alone that they violated the Treaty or any obligation

of the Czech Republic.

5.5.2.4 The Media Council’s ongoing efforts to eliminate the original structure between
CET 21 and CNTS

260 The Arbitral Tribunal also considers that the alleged ongoing efforts by the Media

Council to eliminate the original structure between CET 21 and CNTS in favor of non-

38

wD
a
D

exclusive contractual arrangements did not constitute an arbitrary and discriminatory

measure of the Czech Republic.

It is first to be noted that this allegation is rather vague. The Arbitral Tribunal
understands that the alleged ongoing efforts to eliminate the original structure between
CET 21 and CNTS refer both to the changes in their contractual relationships, ie. the
amendment to the MOA and the conclusion of the various agreements, and to the
issuance by the Media Council of its 15 March 1999 letter, in response to CET 21’s

request of 3 March 1999 (Exhibit C34).

For the sake of clarity, the Arbitral Tribunal will examine these two sets of facts

separately.

5.5.2.4.1 The changes to the contractual relationships between CET 21 and CNTS

The Arbitral Tribunal considers that the Media Council’s actions leading to the
changes to the MOA and the conclusion of the various agreements between CET 21

and CNTS did not constitute arbitrary and discriminatory measures.

The Arbitral Tribunal is of the opinion that the main reason for the Media Council to
direct CME, CET 21 and CNTS to bring some modifications to their legal
relationships was the same as the ground for initiating the administrative proceedings
against CNTS for unauthorized broadcasting, i.e. the fear that the unclear legal and
factual situation could actually amount to a de facto transfer of the License from CET

21 to CNTS, in violation of the Media Law.

Article 1.4.1(a) of the original MOA stated that "CET shall contribute to the Company
unconditionally, unequivocally, and on an exclusive basis the right to use, exploit and
maintain the License held by CET”. The MOA did not contain any definition of the

words “use, exploit and maintain”, which remained open for interpretation.

This legal uncertainty, reinforced by the doubts about the factual allocation of
responsibilities between CET 21 and CNTS, led the Media Council to ask the two
companies to enter into a service contract setting forth their respective roles in the
operation of TV Nova. This process was initiated at the meeting between the Media
Council and CET 21 of 13 March 1996. The first conclusion of this meeting was that
"[l]awyers of the Council and CET 21 will prepare the first version of a contract on
provision of performances and services between CET 21 and CNTS (...)" (Exhibit
C84).

As a result, CET 21 and CNTS concluded the May 1996 Agreement. This agreement

expressly set forth in the preamble that its "purpose (...) is to specify the mutual rights

and mutual obligations which arise to CET 21 as the party making and CNTS as the
party accepting a contribution made under the memorandum of association of May 4,
1993, by which CNTS was established. The memorandum of association is not
changed by this agreement”. The agreement stated that CNTS had the authorization to
“arrange” the television broadcasting operated on the basis of the License (Article

2(1); Exhibit R17).

The amendment to the MOA in November 1996 (Exhibit C59), as well as the
conclusions of the October 1996 Agreement (Exhibit R21) and of the 1997 Agreement
(Exhibits C29 and R22), were further steps of the same process consisting in
specifying the legal relationship between CET 21, CME and CNTS in order to ensure

the creation of a clear situation in observance of the Media Law.

In this respect, the October 1996 Agreement was mainly similar to the May 1996
Agreement, except for the new Article 1(3) providing that said agreement "does not
affect the exclusive liability of CET 21 for the programming” under the Media Law.
The amended Article 1.4.1(a) of the MOA stated that “the Company is granted the
unconditional, irrevocable, and exclusive right to use and maintain the know-how and
make it the subject of profit to the Company, in connection with the License, its
maintenance, and protection”. Finally, the 1997 Agreement further specified CNTS’s
activities by listing the scope of its business (Article 1(3)), and expressly stated that
the contracts on the provision of services would be concluded by CNTS on behalf of

CET 21 (Article 5(1) and (2).

270.

271.

272.

As they were based on an objective ground, i.e. the efforts to create a clear legal
situation in compliance with the Media Law, and as there is no sufficient evidence that
they were specifically targeted against foreign investment, the Media Council’s actions
leading to the changes to the MOA and the conclusion of the various agreements

between CET 21 and CNTS did not constitute arbitrary and discriminatory measures.

This being said, neither CNTS nor CME raised any objections to this process to the
Media Council. On the contrary, both CET 21 and CNTS fully collaborated. The letter
sent by both companies to the Media Council on 4 October 1996 indeed constituted a
proposal to take several steps “(...) for how to best and most quickly meet the
parliamentary commission’s demands and thus how to amicably resolve the prolonged
differences which arose in addressing the legal situation concerning the arrangement
of legal relationships between [CNTS] and CET 21 s.r.o., as well as around the
cancellation of license conditions (...)" (Exhibit R19). These steps were, among
others, the above mentioned amendment to the MOA and conclusion of the

agreements between CET 21 and CNTS.

This collaboration took place despite the CME’s awareness that their legal situation
vis-a-vis CET 21 might be affected. In an memorandum dated 15 May 1996,
Mrs. DeBruce of CME indeed expressed her concern with respect to the contemplated
amendment to the MOA. All proposed amendments to the MOA and contracts
between CET 21 and CNTS should be reviewed by legal counsel prior to be entered
into (Exhibit C111).

Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal holds that the Claimant acquiesced to the Media
Council’s above mentioned actions, and is in any event barred from making a claim

deriving — therefrom.

Finally, the Arbitral Tribunal notes that no sufficient evidence was offered that the
damage claimed by Mr. Lauder in the present arbitration proceedings, i.e. the
termination of the contractual relationship between CET 21 and CNTS on 5 August
1999 on the initiative of the former, was caused by the insistence of the Media Council

on the respect of the Media Law in 1996 and 1997. On the contrary, such damage was

61

the direct result of Mr. Zelezny's own behavior, which was not backed in 1996 or 1997
by the Media Council or any other organ of the Respondent. Regarding further the
question of causality between the alleged acts of the Media Council and the damage

claimed see above § 234 and 235.

5.5.2.4.2 The 15 March 1999 opinion of the Media Council

The Claimant especially draws the attention of the Arbitral Tribunal to the visit by Mr.
Zelezny to the Media Council on 2 March 1999 (R97), the following letter of CET 21,
signed by Mr. Zelezny to the Media Council on 3 March 1999 (C33) and the answer to
the Media Council by its Chairman Josef Josefik of 15 March 1999, addressed to
Mr. Zelezny “CEO of TV NOVA and Executive Director of CET 21” (C34).
According to these documents, and especially the description of the oral discussion
which took place between Mr. Zelezny and the Media Council, it is clear that the
Media Council was informed of the differences between Mr. Zelezny as master of
CET 21 and CNTS. It was clear that Mr. Zelezny wanted the support of the Media
Council in his struggle to free CET 21, and therefore himself, from the restrictions of
the arrangements with CNTS. Although not in all points but at least in one of the key
issues, namely the exclusive nature of the agreements between CET 21 and CNTS, the
Media Council clearly expressed its opinion that in the context of television
broadcasting the “business relations between the operator of broadcasting and _ service

organizations are built on a non-exclusive basis.”

This view would seem to be contrary to what the 1996 Agreements, which were
discussed and agreed with the Media Council in 1996, with the very active
participation of Mr. Zelezny, then wearing the two hats of CEO of both CNTS and
CET 21 have stipulated. The question which this Arbitral Tribunal, however, has to
decide is not whether the Media Council was allowed to send such a letter, but
whether the sending of the letter constituted a breach of the Treaty obligations of the

Respondent.

271.

278.

280.

The Arbitral Tribunal considers that the issuance of the Media Council’s 15 March
1999 letter does not constitute an arbitrary measure and therefore cannot be considered

as a breach of the Treaty.

As stated above (see 5.5.2.3 and 5.5.2.4.1), the Media Council was concemed with the
fact that the unclear legal and factual situation may lead to a de facto transfer of the
License to CNTS, in violation of the Media Law. The exclusive relationship between
CET 21, the licensed broadcaster, and CNTS, its partner in the operation of TV Nova,
was regarded with suspicion, because the Media Council was of the opinion that it

presented the inherent danger of a de facto transfer of the License.

The Media Council’s view on this issue was expressed, for instance, in its opinion to
the Permanent Media Commission of the House of Deputies of the Parliament of 19
September 1999 with respect to the dispute between CET 21 and CNTS. Chapter 4
reads as follows: “Each party has its own version of the heart of the issue based on a
different interpretation of concluded agreements. CME insists on exclusivity and
claims that CET 21 is obliged to broadcast exclusively through CNTS whereas CET 21
denies exclusivity and claims its right to conclude service agreements with any
companies it pleases. As in the past, the Council’s position in this matter is closer to
the opinion that an exclusive relationship between the license holder and a_ service
company is not desirable as it gives an opportunity to manipulate with the license”
(Exhibit C68). The Media Council also expressed its view on this issue in the
supplementary report of 15 November 1999 to the same Commission: “Administrative
proceedings to revoke a license can be started only in the event of serious violation of
the Broadcasting Act, and there must be provable reasons for them. Interrupting the
cooperation of two private companies is not such a reason, and in addition, the
council considers the exclusive relationship between the broadcaster and the only
service organization as undesirable, due to the danger of a hidden transfer of the

license” (Exhibit R126).

The disputed 15 March 1999 letter to CET 21 contained the following statement:
“Business relations between the operator of broadcasting and service organizations
are built on a nonexclusive basis. Exclusive relations between the operator and the

service organization may result in de facto transfer of some functions and rights

63

281.

pertaining to the operator of broadcasting and, in effect, a transfer of the license”

(Exhibit C34).

This statement is to be replaced in the context of the letter, which expressed the Media
Council’s opinion on the requirements of the Media Law with respect to television
broadcasting: “Because the Council was also asked by the Parliamentary Media
Committee to issue an opinion on whether commercial television broadcasting
complies with the Act on Broadcasting and valid licenses, we would like to summarize
requirements that, in our opinion, express the contents of television broadcasting:
(...)". Beside the list of said requirements, among them the above mentioned statement
on regarding the exclusive relationship, the letter also explained the reason for
terminating the administrative proceedings against CNTS for unauthorized
broadcasting, and requested CET 21 to inform the Media Council about the
implementation of the various changes with respect to the legal relationships between
CET and CNTS, and to submit the current program composition and broadcasting

schedule.

Although the statement about the non exclusive basis of the relationship between the
holder of the license and the service organization might be viewed as a change of the
previous position of the Media Council with respect to this issue, because the Media
Council had been satisfied with the amendment of the MOA and the various 1996 and
1997 agreements between CET 21 and CNTS, which all stated the exclusive basis of
the relationship between the two companies, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that it
does not constitute a “measure” within the meaning of the Treaty, but merely
expresses the general opinion of a regulatory body regarding the proper interpretation

which should be given to the Media Law.

This letter was not aimed at having, and could not have, any legal effect. Condition 17
to the License, which required CET 21 to submit to the Media Council for approval
any change in the MOA, had been cancelled end of 1996 (Exhibits R57 and C30).
Since then, the Media Council had no authority to approve or disapprove any

modification to the relationship between CET 21 and CNTS.

284.

285.

288.

Since the Media Council’s 15 March 1999 letter to CET 21 did not amount to a
“measure”, the Respondent did not violate the prohibition against arbitrary and

discriminatory _measures.

The Arbitral Tribunal also considers that said letter was neither arbitrary nor
discriminatory. There indeed existed reasonable grounds, even if not necessarily
conclusive, for the Media Council to view the existence of an exclusive relationship
between CET 21 and CNTS as a danger of a defacto transfer of the License.

In addition, the Media Council remained independent from the dispute between CET
21 and CNTS. The 15 March 1999 letter was indeed significantly different from the
request for said letter filed by CET 21 on 3 March 1999. In particular, the Media
Council’s letter did not reproduce CET 21’s statement that the operator, i.e. CET 21,
"should order services from service organizations at regular prices so as to respect
rules of equal competition ", nor the statement that "[fJor the level of provided services
to agree with the terms of the license and Czech regulatory requirements, the licensed
subject must have the ability to select relevant services anytime and anywhere at will”
(Exhibit C33). Those differences between CET 21’s request and the Media Council’s
letter show that the latter did not just follow the wishes Mr. Zelezny, who controlled

CET 21 at that time.

In this respect, the Arbitral Tribunal notes that the Claimant or the entities he controls
did not commence any administrative or other proceedings before the appropriate
courts of the Czech Republic in the course of which the issue of the overall attitude of
the Media Council in this affair, mainly its alleged contradictory interpretation of the
Media Law, could be addressed and decided. The Arbitral Tribunal considers that
these proceedings do not constitute the appropriate forum to decide on hypothetical

questions of the interpretation of the Media Law.

The Arbitral Tribunal also considers that the issuance of the Media Council’s 15
March 1999 letter was not the cause of the damage incurred by the Claimant.
Although this letter might have strengthened the resolve of Mr. Zelemy to break up
the relationship between CET 21 and CNTS, it was not used to achieve this purpose.
CET 21 did not terminate the 1997 Agreement on the basis that it provided for an

65

5.53.

290.

exclusive relationship with CNTS whereas the Media Council expressed the view such
a relationship was undesirable. The legal reason for the termination was that CNTS
had failed to submit a television program (Daily Log) on time, a requirement under the
1997 Agreement. Furthermore, there is no evidence that even if the Media Council had
not written the 15 March 1999 letter, CET 21 would not have tried to terminate the

1997 Agreement on the ground of breach of contract.

The obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment

The Claimant alleges that the Respondent breached the obligation to provide fair and
equitable treatment to the Claimant’s investments through the Media Council’s reversal
of critical prior approvals. This concerns the Media Council’s proceedings in 1996
aimed at removing in the MOA the provision giving CNTS the exclusive right to use,
benefit from and maintain the License. Furthermore the Claimant asserts that the
Media Council demonstrated hostile conduct towards CNTS, by the totality of its other
actions and inactions that undermined the rights which had been provided to CNTS

(Reply Memorial, p. 81; Summary of Summation, p. 13).

The Claimant argues that the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment has its
basis in the general principle of good faith. The State bound by the Treaty must indeed
pursue the stated goal of achieving a stable framework for investment. The minimum
requirement is that the State not engage in inconsistent conduct, e.g. by reversing to
the detriment of the investor prior approvals on which he justifiably relied. Such a
requirement is independent of the State’s domestic law, i.e. the obligation to provide
fair and equitable investment can be violated even if the State complied with the
requirements under its domestic law. In addition, it is not relevant whether domestic
investors in the same field received the same treatment as the foreign investor, since
the level of protection may be different under domestic law and under the Treaty

(Reply Memorial, p. 77-83; Mr. Kiernan’s oral closing submissions, p. 161-168).

S

The Respondent argues that there exists no precise definition of the obligation to
provide fair and equitable treatment. What is fair and equitable is to be determined on
the basis of the facts in each individual case. Anyway, this obligation is concerned
with the conduct of the State, not with the results of the investments. Therefore, the
fact that the investor loses money does not indicate that the State has breached the
obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment. There is no evidence of a violation
of this obligation by the Czech Republic. Up to 1997, the Media Council was indeed
seeking to monitor and enforce the Media Law in the face of growing concern that
CNTS was breaching it. The Media Council did not discriminate against the Claimant

in favor of nationals, did not reverse prior express permissions, and did not
maliciously misapply the law. Between 1997 and 1999, the Media Council did not
want to take sides with respect to the dispute between CET 21 and CNTS, which was
considered a commercial dispute. In particular, the Media Council’s letter of March 15,
1999, whose wording is different from the one requested by Mr. Zelezny, expressed
the Media Council’s policy in a lawful and non-discriminatory manner (Response, p.

55; Written Closing Submissions, p. 10-11).

Article II(2)(a) of the Treaty sets forth that "fijnvestments shall at all times be
accorded fair and equitable treatments, (...)". As with any treaty, the Treaty shall be
interpreted by reference to its object and purpose, as well as by the circumstances of
its conclusion (Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Articles 31 and 32). The
preamble of the Treaty states that the Parties agree "that fair and equitable treatment
of investment is desirable in order to maintain a stable framework for investment and
maximum effective utilization of economic resources”. The Arbitral Tribunal notes that
there is no further definition of the notion of fair and equitable treatment in the Treaty.
The United Nations Conference On Trade And Development has examined the
meaning of this doctrine. Fair and equitable treatment is related to the traditional
standard of due diligence and provides a “minimum international standard which
forms part of customary international law” (U.N. Conference On Trade &
Development: Bilateral Investment Treaties In The Mid-1990s at 53, U.N. Doc.
UNCTAD/ITE/IIT/7, U.N. Sales No. E.98.1I-D.8 (1998) (English version). In the
context of bilateral investment treaties, the “fair and equitable” standard is subjective
and depends heavily on a factual context. It “will also prevent discrimination against

the beneficiary of the standard, where discrimination would amount to unfairness or

67

295.

296.

298.

inequity in the circumstances” (U.N. Conference On Trade & Development: Fair And
Equitable Treatment, Vol. III at 10,15, U.N. Doc. UNCTAD/ITE/IT/II, U.N. Sales
No. E.99.11.D.15 (1999) (English version)).

The Arbitral Tribunal holds that none of the actions and inactions of the Media
Council, which have already been examined with respect to the prohibition against
arbitrary and discriminatory measures (see above 5.5.2), constitutes a violation of the

duty to provide fair and equitable treatment.

In order to avoid redundancy, the Arbitral Tribunal mainly refers to the developments
made under the chapter addressing the issue of the prohibition against arbitrary and
discriminatory measures, for most of the arguments denying the existence of any
arbitrary and discriminatory measure from the Czech Republic as from 1996 also
apply to the Respondent’s compliance with the obligation to provide fair and equitable

treatment.

This being said, the Arbitral Tribunal does not see any inconsistent conduct on the part

of the Media Council which would amount to an unfair and inequitable treatment.

In particular, the initiation of the administrative proceedings for unauthorized

broadcasting in 1996 was not inconsistent with any prior conduct of the Media
Council. At that time, the Media Council had objective reasons to think that CNTS
was violating the Media Law, i.e. that it was the broadcaster of TV Nova in lieu of
CET 21, the holder of the License. The Media Council’s duties were, among others, to

ensure the observance of the Media Law.

There can not be any inconsistent conduct in a regulatory body taking the necessary
actions to enforce the law, absent any specific undertaking that it will refrain from
doing so. No such undertaking was given by the Media Council or any other organ of
the Czech Republic.

The prior approval by the Media Council of the MOA, in the context of the License
being granted to CET 21, contained no commitment to allow CET 21 and CNTS to
violate the Media Law. On the contrary, the License expressly stated that "/t/he

68

299.

300.

301.

303.

license holder (...) also agrees to observe the conditions stated in the appendix to this
license”. Condition 1 to the License set forth that "[tJhe license holder agrees (...) that
its broadcasting will be in accordance with the laws of the Czech Republic and the
international obligations of the Czech Republic. Broadcasting will, in particular,
observe (...) the provisions of Act no. 468/199] Coll., on operating radio and
television (...)" (Exhibit R5). The amendment to the Media Law did not change

anything with respect to CET 21’s obligation to comply with the Media Law.

The administrative proceedings against CNTS for unauthorized broadcasting was not
initiated on the ground that CNTS would have abided by the previously approved
MOA, which would itself then be considered as violating the Media Law. As already
stated, the reason for commencing such proceedings was the Media Council’s concern
that CNTS was operating the broadcasting of TV Nova in violation of the License and
of the Media Law.

Regarding the changes to the legal relationships between CET 21 and CNTS, ie. the
amendment to the MOA and the conclusion of the various agreements between the
two companies, there was also no inconsistent conduct on the part of the Media

Council.

At no time did the Media Council decide that the approval of the original MOA was
deemed null and void, and that any guarantee given to CET 21 and CNTS at that time
had to be withdrawn. As stated above (see 5.5.2.4.1), all changes to the legal
relationships between CET 21 and CNTS made in 1996 and 1997 were aimed at
specifying, not altering, the content of said relationships in order to ensure a clear

situation in observance of the Media Law.

Furthermore, CET 21, CNTS and CME fully cooperated to this process, after being

given proper legal advice on the various issues addressed.

Finally, the issuance of the 15 March 1999 letter by the Media Council, although in
some way in contradiction with the previously approved MOA on the question of the
exclusive nature of the contractual relationship between CET 21 and CNTS, was

nothing more than an opinion without any legal effect. It did not alter - and was not

69

304.

5.5.4

305.

306.

aimed at altering - the contractual relationships between the two companies, which

remained governed by the 1997 Agreement then in force.

In addition, the Arbitral Tribunal is of the opinion that the 15 March 1999 letter was
not the direct cause of the damage allegedly suffered by the Claimant. Any damage
resulted from the decision of CET 21, controlled by Mr. Zelezny, to terminate the
1997 Agreement with CNTS. CET 21 made no use of the 15 March 1999 letter. There
is no evidence that CET 21 would not have terminated the contractual relationships
with CNTS if the Media Council had not issued the 15 March letter, or, for argument’s
sake, had stated that it was of the opinion that an exclusive relationship between the
two companies fully complied with the Media Law. With respect to causality in

general see above § 234 and 235.

The obligation to provide full protection and security

The Claimant alleges that the Respondent failed to provide full protection and security
to his investment (i) by forcing a change in the Media Law, (ii) by initiating the
administrative proceedings against CNTS in 1996, (iii) by subsequent pressures to
bring about the restructuring of CNTS, (iv) by issuing the 15 March 1999 letter, (v) by
refusing all CNTS’s requests to halt CET 21’s dismantling of all dealings with the
former, and (vi) by authorizing a share capital increase in CET 21 with knowledge that
it would frustrate the ICC arbitral panel’s interim order and would defy an express

contrary request from Parliament (Reply Memorial, p. 85).

The Claimant argues that the obligation of full protection and security requires that the
State take all steps necessary to protect foreign investments whatever the requirements
of domestic law are and regardless of whether the threat to the investment arises from
the State’s own actions. The State has an obligation of vigilance under which it must
take all measures necessary to ensure the full enjoyment of protection and security of

the foreign investment (Memorial, p. 55; Reply Memorial, p. 83-85).

307.

308.

309.

The Respondent argues the obligation of full protection and security is not an absolute
obligation. A State is only obliged to provide protection which is reasonable under the
circumstances. Furthermore, the obligation is limited to the activities of the State
itself, and does not extend to the activities of a private person or entity. There can also
be no legitimate expectation that there will not be any regulatory change (Response, p.
57-59).

Article II(2)(a) of the Treaty provides that "/iJnvestment (...) shall enjoy full
protection and security". There is no further definition of this obligation in the Treaty.
The Arbitral Tribunal is of the opinion that the Treaty obliges the Parties to exercise
such due diligence in the protection of foreign investment as reasonable under the
circumstances. However, the Treaty does not oblige the Parties to protect foreign
investment against any possible loss of value caused by persons whose acts could not
be attributed to the State. Such protection would indeed amount to strict liability,
which can not be imposed to a State absent any specific provision in the Treaty

(Dolzer and Stevens, Bilateral Investment Treaties, p. 61).

The Arbitral Tribunal holds that none of the facts alleged by the Claimant constituted
a violation by the Respondent of the obligation to provide full protection and security

under the Treaty.

Here again, in order to avoid redundancy, the Arbitral Tribunal refers to the findings
made under the chapter addressing the issue of the prohibition against arbitrary and
discriminatory measures (see above 5.5.2), for most of the arguments denying the
existence of any arbitrary and discriminatory measure from the Czech Republic as
from 1996 also apply to the Respondent’s compliance with the obligation to provide

full protection and_ security.

In particular, as regards the amendment to the Media Law in late 1995, effective on 1
January 1996, there is no evidence that such amendment, enacted by the Czech
Parliament, was forced by the Media Council. Furthermore, the change in the Media
Law did not constitute a danger for the Claimant’s investment in the Czech Republic.
In particular, the deletion of Article 12(3) authorizing the Media Council to include

conditions to the grant of a license was not aimed at, nor suited to, destroying

71

312.

313.

Mr. Lauder’s investment. On the contrary, such a change was favorably viewed by the
entities operating TV Nova, since CET 21, represented by Mr. Zelezny, who was at
that time on the side of the Claimant, immediately applied to the Media Council for
the cancellation of most of the Conditions set in the License, among others Condition

17 (Exhibit R31).

Furthermore, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that it is not the Media Council’s role to
halt the alleged dismantling by CET 21 of all its dealings with CNTS, nor to enforce
an ICC arbitral tribunal interim order. In any event, if the Media Council had acted in
violation of its own obligations in respect of these two issues, the present arbitration
proceedings are not the proper forum to seek relief. The Claimant should have and in
fact did initiate action before the competent administrative or civil courts of the Czech

Republic.

In addition, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that none of the actions or inactions of the
Media Council caused a direct or indirect damage to Mr. Lauder’s investment. The
action which actually caused the Claimant to lose part of his investment was the
termination by CET 21 of its contractual relationship with CNTS in 1999. In other
words, the business relationship between CET 21 and CNTS survived all the alleged
actions and inactions of the Media Council. It so did until Mr. Zelezny changed sides
and decided to act in favor of CET 21, which by 1999 he controlled, against CNTS in
which he no longer had any direct or indirect control. Regarding the issue of causality

for the alleged loss suffered by the Claimant see especially § 234 and 235 above.

The investment treaty created no duty of due diligence on the part of the Czech
Republic to intervene in the dispute between the two companies over the nature of
their legal relationships. The Respondent’s only duty under the Treaty was to keep its
judicial system available for the Claimant and any entities he controls to bring their
claims, and for such claims to be properly examined and decided in accordance with
domestic and international law. There is no evidence - not even an allegation - that
the Respondent has violated this obligation. On the contrary, the numerous Czech
court proceedings initiated by CNTS, CME and Mr. Lauder against CET 21 and Mr.
Zelezny show that the Czech judicial system has remained fully available to the

Claimant. In particular, the 4 May 2000 decision by the Regional Commercial Court in

712

315.

316.

318.

Prague that CET 21 was obligated to procure all services for television broadcasting
exclusively through CNTS (Exhibit C54) is conclusive evidence of this availability.
While this decision was later annulled by the High Court in Prague (Exhibit R134) an
appeal is now pending before the Czech Supreme Court, which may still rule in favor
of CNTS.

Costs

Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules states that the Arbitral Tribunal shall fix the costs

of arbitration in its Award and defines the term “costs”.

At the Hearing of 17 March 2000 the Parties and the Arbitrators agreed on the formula
for the fees of the Arbitral Tribunal. The fees and travel and other expenses incurred

by the Arbitrators are herewith fixed at United States Dollars 501°370.20

According to Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules, the costs of arbitration shall in
principle be borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the Arbitral Tribunal may
apportion such costs between the Parties if it determines that apportionment is
reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case. The same applies
according to Article 40(2) with respect to the costs of legal representation and
assistance. The Arbitral Tribunal can take into account the circumstances of the case
and is free to determine which Party shall bear such costs or may apportioned such

costs between the Parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable.

Among the circumstances the Tribunal has taken into account is its finding that the
Respondent, at the very beginning of the investment by the Claimant in the Czech
Republic, breached its obligations not to subject the investment to discriminatory and
arbitrary measures when it reneged on its original approval of a capital investment in
the licence holder and insisted on the creation of a joint venture. Furthermore, various
steps were taken by the Media Council, especially, but not only, the 15 March 1999
letter to CET 21. Although the Arbitral Tribunal came to the conclusion that such acts

did not constitute a violation of the Treaty obligations of the Respondent, the Claimant

73

bona fide could nevertheless feel that he had to commence these arbitration
proceedings. Furthermore, the behaviour of the Respondent regarding the discovery of
documents, which the Claimant could rightly feel might shed more light on the acts of

the Respondent, needs to be mentioned in this context.

319. Taking all these circumstances of the case into account, the Arbitral Tribunal comes to
the decision that each Party shall pay one half of the fees and expenses of the Arbitral
Tribunal and the hearing cost and bear its own costs for legal representation and

assistance and the costs of its witnesses.

NOW THEREFORE THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL

DECIDES

lL. It has jurisdiction to hear and decide this case.

wv

The Respondent committed a breach of its obligation to refrain from arbitrary
and discriminatory measures when in the Winter of 1993 it changed its original
position, which had been made known to the Claimant and to the public at
large, allowing an equity investment of the Claimant in CET 21, the holder of
the licence to broadcast, and insisted that the participation of the Claimant
could not be made in the form of an equity participation but only through a

joint venture company.

3. The claim for a declaration that the Respondent committed further breaches of

the Treaty are denied and all claims for damages are denied.

4. Each Party shall pay one half of the fees and expenses of the Arbitral Tribunal
which are fixed at US$ 501‘370.20

5. Each Party shall pay one half of the direct costs involved in the London

Hearings, including room hire, cost of court reporters, etc.
6. Each Party shall carry its own costs for legal representation and assistance,
including the travel and other expenses of witnesses presented by the respective

Party.

1. All other claims are herewith dismissed.
