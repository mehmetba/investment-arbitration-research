THE PARTIES

The Claimant is Transban Investment Corporation (“Transban” or “Claimant”), a
company allegedly constituted under the laws of Barbados.

The Respondent is the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (“Venezuela” or
“Respondent”).

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On July 24 or 25, 2012 (the precise date is disputed by the Parties), the International
Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre’”) received a
Request for Arbitration (the “Request” or “RfA”), dated July 24,2012, from the
Claimant. The proceeding is initiated under the Agreement between the Government of
Barbados and the Government of the Republic of Venezuela for the Promotion and
Protection of Investments (“BIT”), which was signed on July 15, 1994 and entered into
force on October 31, 1995.!

On August 27, 2012, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for
Arbitration in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention.

On October 26, 2012, the Claimant informed the Centre of the appointment of Professor
David D. Caron, a U.S. national, as arbitrator. On November 20, 2012, Professor Caron
accepted his appointment.

On January 17, 2013, Venezuela appointed Dr. Santiago Torres Bernardez, a national of
the Kingdom of Spain, as arbitrator. Dr. Santiago Torres Berndrdez accepted his
appointment on January 30, 2013.

On January 17, 2013, the Respondent submitted a proposal to disqualify Professor
Caron. On June 18, 2013, the Claimant proposed the disqualification of Dr. Torres
Bernardez. Both proposals were filed before the constitution of the Tribunal.

On December 24, 2013, the Claimant requested, pursuant to Article 38 of the ICSID
Convention, that the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council appoint the third
arbitrator.

On February 14, 2014, the Chairman appointed Judge Peter Tomka, a national of the
Slovak Republic, as President of the Tribunal. Judge Tomka accepted his appointment
on February 23, 2014.

The Tribunal was constituted on February 24, 2014 in accordance with Article 37(2)(b)
of the ICSID Convention. On the same date, in view of the proposals to disqualify the
two co-arbitrators, the proceeding was suspended until the proposals were decided,
pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6).

22.

On May 13, 2014, the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council issued a Decision
rejecting the proposals to disqualify Professor Caron and Dr. Torres Bernardez. On the
same date, the proceeding was resumed pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6).

The first session of the Arbitral Tribunal was held by telephone conference on July 8,
2014. Prior to that session, the Secretary of the Tribunal circulated to the Parties the
Draft Agenda, on June 11, 2014, and the Draft Procedural Order on June 13, 2014. The
Parties’ comments on these two drafts were received on July 7, 2014.

On July 24, 2014, the revised Draft Procedural Order was circulated to the Parties by the
Tribunal’s Secretary. The Parties’ final comments were received on July 30, 2014.

On September 30, 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 (in English and
Spanish) which sets out the Procedural Rules governing the arbitration, including the
procedural schedule.

On November 26, 2014, the Claimant requested a one month extension to file its
Memorial, with all other deadlines to be extended accordingly. On December 1, 2014,
the Respondent opposed the extension. On December 2, 2014, the Claimant submitted
a revised proposal for amending the original procedural schedule. On December 4,
2014, the Respondent reiterated its opposition to the Claimant’s request, adding that in
case the Tribunal were to grant the request, the deadline for filing the Counter-Memorial
be July 7, 2015.

On December 10, 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, modifying
Section 14 (number and sequence of pleadings) of Procedural Order No. 1.

On February 6, 2015, within the time-limit as extended, the Claimant filed its Memorial.

On April 21, 2015, following exchanges between the Parties, the Tribunal issued
Procedural Order No. 3 on the Respondent’s Request for the Production of Documents.

On May 29, 2015, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to modify the procedural
calendar. On June 5, 2015, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that it had no objection
to the modification of the time-limit for filing the Respondent’s Counter-Memorial.

On June 19, 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 modifying the procedural
calendar.

On August 4, 2015, within the time-limit as extended, the Respondent filed its Memorial
on Objections to Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits (“MOBJ”). It
requested, in accordance with the provisions of Section 14.3 of Procedural Order No. 1,
as modified by Procedural Orders Nos.2 and 4, that the Tribunal bifurcate the
proceedings, dealing with its objections to jurisdiction as a preliminary matter.

On September 4, 2015, within the time-limit set in Section 14.5 as modified by
Procedural Order No.4, the Claimant filed its Memorandum in Opposition to
Respondent’s Request for Bifurcation (“TOB”).

The filing of the Request for Bifurcation did not alter, pursuant to Section 14.5, the
schedule for the Respondent’s document production. On September 25, 2015, the
Claimant submitted its Request for Production of Documents.

On October 8, 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 on the above Claimant’s
request.

On November 2, 2015, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Respondent’s Request for
Bifurcation and decided that the Respondent’s first (ratione temporis) and second
(ratione personae) objections on jurisdiction be dealt by the Tribunal as preliminary
matters, while the third (ratione materiae) objection be joined to the merits. The Tribunal
further ordered the Claimant to file its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction by December
17, 2015.

Pursuant to the deadline established by the Tribunal, the Claimant filed its Counter-
Memorial on Jurisdiction (“TCMJ”) on December 17, 2015.

On February 8, 2016, following exchanges between the Parties, the Tribunal issued
Procedural Order No. 6 concerning the organization of the hearing on jurisdiction.

The hearing on jurisdiction was held at the Peace Palace in The Hague, on
March 2 and 3, 2016.

During the hearing the Claimant was invited by the Tribunal to provide the full text of
the following Barbadian legislation: (a) the Companies Act; (b) the Companies
Regulations; (c) the International Business Companies Act; and (d) the International
Business Companies Regulations. The full text of the requested legislation (with its
Amendments) was transmitted by the Claimant after the hearing on March 11, 2016.

On May 10, 2016, the Parties filed their respective statements on costs.

The Tribunal held deliberations in The Hague on March 4 and June 16, 2016 and further
exchanged views through other means of communication.

THE JURISDICTION OF THE TRIBUNAL

This Tribunal is constituted under the ICSID Convention. The Convention provides, at
Article 25(1), as follows:

The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising
directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any
constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to
the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State,
which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the
Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may
withdraw its consent unilaterally.

It is for Claimant to establish the basis of jurisdiction of an ICSID Tribunal. Consent by

the Parties may be found in a variety of written instruments. The offer to arbitrate may
be in one written instrument and the acceptance in another.

Claimant seeks arbitration before ICSID on the basis of the BIT. In particular, Claimant
points to Article 8(1) of the BIT which provides:

Disputes between one Contracting Party and a national or company of

the other Contracting Party... shall, at the request of the national
concerned, be submitted to [ICSID] for... arbitration... under the
[ICSID Convention].

Claimant asserts that they are investors constituted under the laws of Barbados who have
made an investment in Venezuela through their business activities in that State. Claimant
therefore contends that arbitration before ICSID is available to it for the resolution of
their dispute with Venezuela.

Rule 41(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules states that objections to a Tribunal’s
jurisdiction “shall be made as early as possible”. As noted in paragraph 21, Respondent
timely filed its MOJB on August 4, 2015.

As noted at paragraph 25, Respondent initially raised three preliminary objections to the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction and the admissibility of the claims. In its Decision of November
2, 2015, the Tribunal decided to deal with the Respondent’s objections to jurisdiction
ratione temporis and ratione personae as preliminary matters.

The Tribunal has had the benefit of extensive submissions and evidence from both
Parties. Many issues and sub-issues have been raised in the course of the proceedings.
The Tribunal has carefully considered all submissions, all evidence, and all issues but
for the sake of procedural economy has only discussed in this Award those it considers
necessary.

THE APPLICABLE LAW

To rule, at the present stage of the proceedings, on the two preliminary objections the
Tribunal will have to apply the ICSID Convention and the BIT. In interpreting these
two treaty instruments, the Tribunal will be guided by customary international law as
codified in Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. The
Vienna Convention is, however, not directly applicable as a treaty for two reasons.
Under its Article 4 “[w]ithout prejudice to the application of any rules set forth in the
[Vienna] Convention to which treaties would be subject under international law
independently of the Convention, the Convention applies only to treaties which are
concluded by States after the entry into force of the present Convention with regard to
such States.” The ICSID Convention, adopted on March 18, 1965, entered into force on
October 14, 1996 well before the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties was adopted
on May 23, 1969 and entered into force almost eleven years later, on January 27, 1980.
Moreover, Venezuela is not a Party to the Vienna Convention. For that reason, although
Barbados is a Party to the Vienna Convention, having ratified it on June 24, 1971, the
Vienna Convention is also not applicable as a treaty to the BIT which was signed on
July 15, 1994 and entered into force on October 31, 1995. It is, however, well accepted

that Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on interpretation of treaties reflect
customary international law, as confirmed by the ICJ on a number of occasions.2

41. When dealing with the second preliminary objection in which the Respondent argues
that the Claimant is not a protected investor pursuant to the BIT, since the BIT in its
definition of companies in Article 1(d), refers to “corporations, firms and associations
incorporated or constituted under the law in force in that Contracting Party”, the Tribunal
will have to give careful consideration to the law of Barbados as Transban claims to be
a protected investor of Barbados’ nationality. The Parties presented their arguments
both on the law of Barbados and the law of Venezuela which they consider relevant for
the purpose of reaching a decision on this objection.

V. OBJECTION TO JURISDICTION RATIONE TEMPORIS: ABSENCE OF
CONSENT TO ARBITRATION BY VENEZUELA

42. Venezuela’s objection to jurisdiction ratione temporis has two aspects, each aspect
alleged to be sufficient to deny the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. First, by the denunciation
of the ICSID Convention, Venezuela withdrew its consent to ICSID jurisdiction, with
immediate effect following receipt of the notice of denunciation by the World Bank.
Second, in any case the Claimant filed its RfA with ICSID after more than six months
had elapsed from the receipt by the World Bank of the notice of denunciation, when
Venezuela was not any more a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention.

1. Venezuela’s Denunciation of the ICSID Convention
a. Position of the Respondent

43. Venezuela insists on the importance of State consent for establishing the jurisdiction of
an international dispute settlement forum.? The jurisdiction of an ICSID tribunal is
predicated on a “‘double keyhole’ approach”* or “double-barrelled test”>: First, the
State party to the dispute and the State of whom the claimant investor possesses the
requisite nationality must be Contracting States to the ICSID Convention, and, second,
the disputing party State and the investor must have both consented to submit the dispute
to an ICSID tribunal.®

44. Venezuela argues that its consent to arbitrate the dispute is lacking since it was not a
party to the ICSID Convention upon registration of the RfA by ICSID or upon Transban
expressing its consent to arbitration.’ It contends that Transban had to express its

consent to arbitration prior to the receipt of the Notice of Denunciation by the World
Bank, i.e., before January 24, 2012.8

Venezuela refers to Articles 71 and 72 of the ICSID Convention which read as follows:

Article 71

Any Contracting State may denounce this Convention by written notice
to the depositary of this Convention. The denunciation shall take effect
six months after receipt of such notice.

Article 72

Notice by a Contracting State pursuant to Articles 70 or 71 shall not
affect the rights or obligations under this Convention of that State or of
any of its constituent subdivisions or agencies or of any national of that
State arising out of consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre given by one
of them before such notice was received by the depositary.

Venezuela argues that it ceased to be a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention on
the day when the World Bank received its Notice of Denunciation, i.e., on January 24,
2012.° Respondent disputes therefore that Article 71 of the ICSID Convention means
that Venezuela continued to be a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention during the
six months following receipt of its notice of denunciation.!° Venezuela relies on ICSID
Administrative and Financial Regulation 20 which lays out requirements for keeping a
list of Contracting States that includes former Contracting States and the date on which
the World Bank received their notices of denunciation; Venezuela argues that
Regulation 20 deems the date of receipt of the notice to constitute the date on which a
State ceases to be a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention.'! It submits that pursuant
to Article 71, investors have no rights under the ICSID Convention prior to consenting
to the jurisdiction of an ICSID tribunal,!? and such consent must be expressed prior to
the receipt by the World Bank of a Contracting State’s notice of denunciation. '*

Regarding the effet utile to be given to the provision of Article 71 which states that the
denunciation shall take effect six months after receipt of the notice of denunciation,
Venezuela, relying on Professor Schreuer’s commentary, suggests that this provision
“refers [to] the other obligations incumbent upon a Contracting State under the
Convention”,'* namely the obligations in respect of the Centre’s immunities and
privileges (Arts. 18-24), recognition and enforcement of awards (Art. 54).!° In its oral
argument, Venezuela also included diplomatic protection in this category (Art. 27).!°

Venezuela thus construes the last sentence of Article 71 of the ICSID Convention, “[t]he
denunciation shall take effect six months after receipt of such notice” as meaning that

'” Hearing Trans

“existing rights and obligations under the treaty will continue for six months” after
receipt of such notice; the denunciation concerns rights and obligations under the ICSID
Convention that existed prior to a notice of denunciation. '”

Venezuela views Article 72 as an exception to Article 71'%, as a corollary to Articles 25
and 71 of the ICSID Convention,!? and as an exception to the double-barrelled test for
establishing jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention.”° The irrevocability of consent
under Article 25(1), which provides that disputing parties cannot withdraw their
consents unilaterally once they have given their written consents to submit a dispute to
an ICSID tribunal, explains the existence of Article 72.7!

In Venezuela’s view, the last words of Article 72 of the ICSID Convention, “consent to
the jurisdiction of the Centre given . . . before such notice was received . . .”, mean that
once the notice of denunciation is received by the World Bank, no new requests for
arbitration can be validly formulated against the denouncing State.? An ICSID tribunal
has jurisdiction only once consent has been perfected; rights and obligations therefore
arise only if an investor accepts a Contracting State’s offer to arbitrate, and these
perfected and irrevocable consents must have been expressed before a notice of
denunciation is received by the World Bank in order to benefit from Article 72.7

Venezuela denies limiting Article 72 of the ICSID Convention to six months and instead
argues that Article 72 applies so long as consent to the jurisdiction of an ICSID tribunal
was given by both disputing parties prior to a notice of denunciation.” Contrary to the
conclusions reached by the tribunal in Venoklim, this reading affords investors legal
security from the moment when both disputing parties consent to arbitration, since such
consent cannot be unilaterally withdrawn.”

Venezuela invokes a statement by Aron Broches, General Counsel at the World Bank
during the drafting of the ICSID Convention, with respect to a draft version of what later
became Article 72 of the ICSID Convention, to the effect that “[i]f a State withdraws its
unilateral statement by denouncing the Convention before it has been accepted by any
investor, no investor could later bring a claim before the Centre”.*° Venezuela further
relies on Professor Schreuer’s views that, pursuant to Article 72 of the ICSID
Convention, consent to submit an investment dispute to ICSID cannot be perfected by
an investor once a State has sent a notice of denunciation under Article 71 of the ICSID
Convention to the World Bank.”

53. To Venezuela, the term “consent”, as used in Article 72 of the ICSID Convention, means
“perfected consent.”?* It points to what it considers to be “definitions of consent” in the
Preamble to the ICSID Convention, in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and in ICSID
Institution Rule 2(3) as support for the proposition that “consent” as used in Article 72
means consent by both disputing parties.”°

54. Article 8(1) of the BIT states that “[d]isputes between one Contracting Party and a
national or company of the other Contracting Party... shall, at the request of the
national concerned, be submitted to [ICSID] for... arbitration... under the [ICSID
Convention]”, while pursuant to Article 8(4) of the BIT, Venezuela “hereby gives its
unconditional consent to the submission of disputes as referred to in paragraph 1| of this
Article to international arbitration.” Venezuela acknowledges that Article 8 of the BIT
remains valid and in force, but argues that it merely amounts to a general declaration of
consent and that it is insufficient in and of itself to establish the jurisdiction of an ICSID
tribunal.*? No rights or obligations arise under the ICSID Convention from a mere offer
of consent to arbitrate disputes given in a bilateral investment treaty if such offer had not
been accepted prior to the receipt of a notice of denunciation by the World Bank,
concludes Venezuela.*!

b. Position of the Claimant

55. Transban argues that the denunciation takes effect six months after its receipt by the
ICSID Secretariat, in accordance with Article 71 of the ICSID Convention,* and that
Article 72 of the ICSID Convention is not meant to restrict the application of that
six-month delay: indeed, Article 72 does not mention the six-month delay or the taking
into effect of a denunciation discussed in Article 71.

56. Transban construes Venezuela’s position as meaning that a State’s consent to arbitrate
under the ICSID Convention “is immediately withdrawn at the moment of denunciation,
thereby precluding any new claims under the [ICSID] Convention”™, and that Transban
was barred from filing the RfA since it had not perfected consent prior to the Notice of
Denunciation.*> Transban rejects Venezuela’s argument of immediate effect of its
Notice of Denunciation based on ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 20°°
as contrary to the express wording of Article 71 of the ICSID Convention.*” Transban

further argues that Administrative and Financial Regulation 20 in no way asserts that a
State ceases to be a Contracting State on the day that the World Bank receives a notice
of denunciation.**

Transban emphasises that the tribunal in Venoklim rejected this same position of
Venezuela.*” The Venoklim tribunal stated that Venezuela’s arguments contradict the
ordinary meaning of Articles 71 and 72 of the ICSID Convention by giving immediate
effect to a notice of denunciation.*° According to the Venoklim Tribunal, Venezuela’s
position violated basic principles of legal security by preventing investors from knowing
beforehand that a denunciation of the ICSID Convention was forthcoming: the
impossibility of instituting arbitral proceedings following the receipt of the Notice of
Denunciation by ICSID would vitiate the six-month delay that precedes the taking effect
of a notice of denunciation under Article 71 of the ICSID Convention and would empty
it of its ordinary meaning.*! The wording of Article 71 of the ICSID Convention
provides no support for Venezuela’s attempt at restricting the scope and effects of the
six-month delay.*?

Transban rejects the idea that Article 72 of the ICSID Convention serves as a corollary
or as an exception to Article 71 of the ICSID Convention: Article 72 is a rule entirely
separate from Article 1.8 Rather, Article 72 of the ICSID Convention limits the
extinction of obligations by providing for the survival of obligations arising out of a
denouncing State’s consent to ICSID’s jurisdiction beyond the six-month period
mentioned in Article 71.44 Transban quotes a preliminary draft of what has become
Article 72 which stated that “obligations ... arising out of undertakings given prior to
the date of such [denunciation] shall remain in full force and effect”,*> and argues that
Article 72 was meant to prevent denunciations of the ICSID Convention from operating
as withdrawals of previously given consents to arbitration.*° For support, Transban turns
to Article 70(1)(b) of the VCLT, which states that termination of a treaty “does not affect
any right, obligation or legal situation of the parties created through the execution of the
treaty prior to its termination.”*” The Venoklim tribunal further considered that Article
71 settles the future consequences of denunciations, while Article 72 ensures respect for

rights and obligations acquired prior to the denunciation and establishes the non-
retroactive character of denunciations.**

Transban underlines that nowhere in Article 72 of the ICSID Convention is reference
made to “perfected consent”; on the contrary, Article 72 refers only to consent given by
a Contracting State and “does not require acceptance of the investor in order to become
‘consent’.”? The Venoklim tribunal considered that the consent referred to in Article 72
of the ICSID Convention is that of the respondent State: in the context of investor-State
arbitration, Article 72 refers to a State’s unilateral offer to arbitrate, and not to the
perfecting of such consent by an investor’s acceptance of the State’s unilateral offer to
arbitrate.’ Transban further contrasts Article 72 with the preamble to the ICSID
Convention and Article 25, which specify consent by both disputing parties.*!

Transban points out that Mr. Broches had hastened to confine his statement quoted by
Venezuela: if a State’s unilateral offer to arbitrate a dispute had been accepted before
the denunciation of the ICSID Convention, then “disputes arising between the State and
the investor after the date of denunciation will still be within the jurisdiction of the
Centre.”°? Transban further points out that Mr. Broches referred to the denunciation
itself and not to a notice of denunciation. Transban argues that Mr. Broches’s comments
likely applied in respect of denunciations that had already taken effect, and that a consent
to arbitrate an investment dispute perfected during the six-month delay prior to a
denunciation taking effect would therefore validly situate such a request for arbitration
within the jurisdiction of an ICSID tribunal.**

Articles 8(1) and 8(4) of the BIT take Venezuela’s treaty-based standing offer to consent
to the arbitration of an investment dispute one step further by clearly giving its
unconditional consent to submit BIT disputes to ICSID’s jurisdiction.** Transban argues
that in Tidewater,*> Venezuela acknowledged that the requirement of a separate written
consent by a disputing Party State under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention is met
when the relevant treaty stipulates an obligatory submission to arbitration, as does
Article 8 of the BIT. The decision to refer a dispute to ICSID then rests solely with the
protected investor.*°

In addition, Transban argues that Venezuela’s position contradicts the object and
purpose of the ICSID Convention of encouraging private international investment
through the legally guaranteed availability of international arbitration facilities by
preventing a Contracting State of the ICSID Convention from terminating its obligation

of submitting investment disputes to the jurisdiction of ICSID without prior notice.*”
According to Transban, Venezuela’s position would also “nullif[y] the broad consent
and protection given by the BIT”, since under Article 8 of the BIT, ICSID is “the only
means to resolve the dispute between the investor and the State”; Article 72 of the ICSID
Convention is precisely aimed at preventing such impasse.**

2. The Critical Date for Establishing ICSID Jurisdiction

a. Position of the Respondent

63.

64.

65.

Venezuela argues that even if the Tribunal decided that Transban could consent to
arbitration during the six months following the receipt of the Notice of Denunciation by
the World Bank, Transban’s RfA is nevertheless time-barred.°? Venezuela denounced
the ICSID Convention on January 24, 2012, which means that the subsequent six-month
delay under Article 71 of the ICSID Convention expired on July 24, 2012.

Firstly, Venezuela argues, “the critical date for determining the fulfilment of
jurisdictional requirements is the date of commencement of the proceedings”.°!
Venezuela invokes ICSID Institution Rule 6(2), which deems the institution of an ICSID
proceeding to occur “on the date of the registration of the request”.©* ICSID registered
the RfA on August 27, 2012, which should therefore serve as critical date.©* Venezuela
argues that Professor Schreuer expressed the view that the date of registration is the

relevant date for ascertaining “all jurisdictional requirements”.*

Secondly, Venezuela argues that Transban filed its RFA on July 25, 2012:° Venezuela
relies on a letter from ICSID, dated July 25, 2012, which states that the RfA had been
received by ICSID on July 25, 2012. In accordance with Institution Rules 2 and 4 and
ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 29, the critical date should be the date
of receipt, at the seat of ICSID, of an original signed hard copy of the RfA and five
additional hard copies.°’ Since ICSID received the signed original hard copy of the RfA
on July 25, 2012, Venezuela argues that the RfA was filed after the end of the six-month
delay preceding the taking into effect of the Notice of Denunciation, i.e., at 00:00 on
July 25, 2012.%

to have changed its position and to acknowledge that the Notice of Denunciation was dated 24 January 2012:
see TCMJ, para. 29, fn 33.

12

66. Venezuela rejects the notion that the procedural rules set by this Tribunal apply to the
filing of the RfA: the ICSID Institution Rules and Administrative and Financial
Regulations applied to the RfA at the time of its filing and these rules do not amount to

“hyper-technicalities”.©

b. Position of the Claimant

67. First, Transban insists on the clear distinction between the act of instituting proceedings
and the institution of proceedings by an administrative body” and invokes common
sense to argue that the date of registration of the RfA by ICSID should not serve as
critical date, since it depends almost exclusively on the actions of the ICSID Secretariat,
as opposed to the actions of disputing parties.’! In Transban’s view, the date of the filing
of the request is the critical date for assessing the consent of the parties.’* Transban
rejects Venezuela’s argument,”* based on ICSID Institution Rule 6(2), that registration
of the RfA by ICSID on August 27, 2012 should serve as critical date.’* Transban
illustrates this argument by turning to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID
Institution Rule 6(1)(b), which call on the ICSID Secretariat to register a request for
arbitration unless it manifestly falls outside of ICSID’s jurisdiction: Transban argues
that the ICSID Secretariat would be in an untenable position if a request for arbitration
could fall outside of ICSID’s jurisdiction due to its own lateness in registering a
request.’5

68. Transban relies on the finding of the tribunal in Venoklim, to the effect that the critical
date for determining the existence of perfected consent is the date of filing the RfA,”° as
well as on a number of doctrinal sources and arbitral awards to the same effect.’”
Transban invokes the following elements as indications that the submission of a dispute
to ICSID occurs at the moment when an investor files its request. First, the “settled
jurisprudence” of the International Court of Justice supports the view that “jurisdiction
must be determined at the time that the act instituting proceedings was filed”’*. Second,
Article 8(1) of the BIT uses the terms “shall, at the request of the national concerned, be
submitted [to ICSID]’.” Third, ICSID Institution Rule 2 stipulates that a request for
arbitration must indicate the date of consent; “date of consent” is defined as “the date on
which the second [disputing] party acted’*°, which Transban construes as the date of
filing the RfA.*!

1965), at para. 23 (Exhibit CL-0117), in support of its understanding that the date of filing the RfA proves the
critical date for establishing perfected consent to the present arbitral proceedings.

13

72.

Transban turns to paragraph 13.6 of Procedural Order No. 2, which deems the date of
sending electronic versions of documents to constitute the official date of receipt of
pleadings or communications,*? as further support for its view that filing the RfA was
achieved upon the sender completing its final act needed for sending it.**

Transban points out that, aside from its argument insisting on the date of registration of
the RfA by ICSID as the critical date, Venezuela appears to imply an equivalence
between the date of consent to arbitration, the date of the filing of the RfA and the date
on which the RfA was sent,*+ and Venezuela appears instead to have focused on
challenging the actual date on which Transban had filed the RfA.*5

Second, Transban argues that it filed the RfA — and therefore expressed its consent — on
July 24, 2012 (i.e., within six months of the Notice of Denunciation), not on July 25,
2012 as Venezuela alleges, and that ICSID confirmed receipt of the RfA by letter the
next day.®° Transban points to a letter from Venezuela to ICSID, in which Venezuela
recognizes that Transban filed the RfA on July 24, 2012.8’ Transban further relies on
the following evidence, all dated July 24, 2012, as proof that the RfA was filed on that
same day: the email to the ICSID Secretariat attaching the RfA, UPS electronic
confirmations confirming receipt of relevant mailing information regarding the RfA, and
a wire transfer order for payment of ICSID filing fees by DLA Piper on behalf of
Transban.** Furthermore, the ICSID Secretariat acknowledged having already received
payment of filing fees upon transmitting a copy of the RfA and related documentation
to Venezuela on July 25, 2012.°°

Transban rejects, as a hyper-technicality, Venezuela’s argument predicated on
Institution Rules 2 and 4 and ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 29 and
according to which the delivery of an original signed hard copy and five hard copies to
ICSID was necessary for Transban to express its consent to arbitration.°° Transban
recalls that delivery of the RfA by email on 24 July 2012 occurred instantly.°!

3. Analysis by the Tribunal

723.

The first issue the Tribunal has to resolve is the legal effect of Venezuela’s notification
of denunciation of the ICSID Convention in accordance with its Article 71. That Article
provides as follows:

Any Contracting State may denounce this Convention by written notice
to the depositary of this Convention. The denunciation shall take effect
six months after receipt of such notice.

74. It is established, and the Parties are in agreement, that the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (the World Bank), which is the depositary of the
Convention, received Venezuela’s Notice of Denunciation on January 24, 2012. The
six-month period, mentioned in Article 71 of the Convention, started to run on January
25, 2012 and expired on July 24, 2012. Until that day inclusive, Venezuela continued
to be a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention. As from July 25, 2012, Venezuela
has no longer been a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention.

75. The legal consequences of the termination of a treaty, of which denunciation is one of
the forms, are determined by that treaty itself, or in case that it contains no specific
provisions on this issue, by general international law. The Vienna Convention on the
Law of Treaties is not applicable it this case as such because Venezuela is not a Party to
it. However, Article 70 of the Vienna Convention has been regarded as reflecting
customary international law by another arbitral tribunal®? and no argument has been
made to the Tribunal suggesting otherwise. Under the rule codified in that provision,
“unless the treaty otherwise provides or the parties otherwise agree, the termination of a
treaty under its provisions ... (a) releases the parties from any obligation further to
perform the treaty; (b) does not affect any right, obligation or legal situation of the parties
created through the execution of the treaty prior to its termination.” In case of the
denunciation of a multilateral treaty, the ICSID Convention being of such a nature, the
above rule applies in the relations between the State which has denounced the treaty and
each of the other parties to the treaty from the date when such denunciation takes effect.**

76. In accordance with this rule -- unless the ICSID Convention provides otherwise --
Venezuela has been released, as of July 25, 2012, from any obligation further to perform
the ICSID Convention while any rights, obligations or legal situations created through
the execution of the Convention prior to the taking effect of its denunciation have not
been affected.

77. The ICSID Convention contains only one specific Article referring to the Notice of
Denunciation under Article 71, leaving aside Article 75 which deals with the functions
of the depositary of the Convention among which is also his obligation to notify all
signatory States of denunciation in accordance with Article 71. That specific Article is
Article 72, which provides that

Notice by a Contracting State pursuant to Articles 70° or 71 shall not
affect the rights or obligations under this Convention of that State or of
any of its constituent subdivisions or agencies or of any national of that

°? See ICSID News Release, dated January 26, 2012 informing that on January 24, 2012, the World Bank
received a written Notice of Denunciation of the Convention from the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. The
ICSID News Release further informs that “[i]n accordance with Article 71 of the ICSID Convention, the
denunciation will take effect six months after the receipt of Venezuela’s notice, i.e., on July 25, 2012.” The
ICSID News Release further confirms that, as required by Article 75 of the ICSID Convention, the World Bank,
in its capacity as depositary of the Convention, has notified all ICSID signatory States of this denunciation.

State arising out of consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre given by
one of them before such notice was received by the depositary.
(footnote added)

Venezuela exercised its right to withdraw from the ICSID Convention under Article 71
thereof by its written Notice of Denunciation which the World Bank as depositary of the
Convention received on January 24, 2012.

In the view of the Tribunal, Article 72 is a kind of saving clause. This view is supported
by the fact that it also refers to notice under Article 70 which reads:

This Convention shall apply to all territories for whose international
relations a Contracting State is responsible, except those which are
excluded by such State by written notice to the depositary of this
Convention either at the time of ratification, acceptance or approval or
subsequently.

The purpose of Article 72 is thus to preserve rights, obligations and or legal situations
which have arisen prior to the receipt of notices either under Article 70 or Article 71 of
the Convention.

Article 72 speaks of rights and obligations under the Convention arising out of consent
to the jurisdiction of the Centre given by the State (or its subdivisions or agencies or its
nationals). The State’s consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre does not derive from the
participation of the State in the ICSID Convention. The Preamble to the Convention
makes this clear beyond any doubt when it, in its last paragraph,

[dJeclar[es] that no Contracting State shall by the mere fact of its
ratification, acceptance or approval of this Convention and without its
consent be deemed to be under any obligation to submit any particular
dispute to . . . arbitration. (emphasis added)

Thus, in addition to being a Party to the ICSID Convention, a State has to give “its
consent” to the submission of a dispute to arbitration. Venezuela has given such consent
to the submission of disputes with an investor of Barbados’ nationality to international
arbitration in the BIT which it concluded with Barbados on July 15, 1994.°° Its Article 8,
entitled “Settlement of Disputes between one Contracting Party and Nationals or
Companies of the other Contracting Party”, states in paragraph 4 that

[e]ach Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the
submission of disputes as referred to in paragraph | of this Article to
international arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this
Article. (emphasis added)

Paragraph 1, to which reference is made in paragraph 4, provides for the disputes,
defined therein as

° The BIT, having entered into force on October 31, 1995, remains in force.

16

83.

[d]isputes between one Contracting Party and a national or company of
the other Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the former
under this Agreement in relation to an investment of the latter,

to be submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes.

Venezuela’s consent to international arbitration of investment disputes with investors
from Barbados is thus contained in the BIT and that consent remains valid. It alone,
however, is not sufficient to establish the jurisdiction of ICSID. There are two further
conditions to be met. First, Venezuela’s consent has to meet with the consent of an
investor from Barbados. The ICSID Convention stipulates this requirement clearly. The
Contracting States, in the Preamble to the ICSID Convention, recognize that “mutual
consent by the parties to submit such [i.e., investment] disputes . . . to arbitration...
constitutes a binding agreement”. Further, Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, in its
paragraph (1), provides:

The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising
directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any
constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to
the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State,
which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the
Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may
withdraw its consent unilaterally. (emphasis added)

Transban expressed its consent in writing by the filing of the RfA. The question remains
whether it has done so timely.

The second condition is that the State of the nationality of an investor and the State with
which an investor has an investment dispute, are both Parties or, to use the language of
the ICSID Convention, Contracting States to the Convention, as it appears from its
Article 25 just quoted above.

Venezuela’s consent to international arbitration, for the purposes of the present case, is
expressed in the BIT (see para. 79 above), and not in the ICSID Convention. An action
under the latter instrument, such as notice of its denunciation, cannot affect the BIT
itself. It can only affect the rights and obligations under the Convention itself. The BIT
being still in force, Venezuela’s consent to international arbitration remains valid as
well.

The question for the Tribunal to resolve is whether an investor can express its consent
to ICSID arbitration in the period following the receipt by the depositary of the ICSID
Convention of a notice of denunciation and prior to the taking effect of such notice.
Nothing in Article 72 of the ICSID Convention suggests that this could not be the case.
That Article addresses the issue of consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre given by a
Contracting State, which has notified the depositary of its denunciation of the
Convention under Article 71, as well as the consent given by constituent subdivisions or
agencies or any national of such State. The purpose of this Article is to preserve rights
and obligations under the Convention of that State or its subdivisions or agencies or its
nationals arising out of their consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre given before the
notice of denunciation by that State was received by the depositary. The temporal factor

in Article 72 relates to the consent given by the denouncing State or its subdivisions or
agencies or nationals, not to the rights and obligations under the ICSID Convention. It
is not to be expected that once a State has decided to denounce the ICSID Convention,
it would nevertheless subsequently give its consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre.

It is true that the jurisdiction of the Centre is based on the mutual consent of both parties,
an investor and a State, and that this mutual consent constitutes a binding arbitration
agreement. The text of Article 72 does not create an obstacle for an investor to give its
consent to ICSID arbitration subsequent to the receipt by the depositary of the notice of
denunciation. If the denouncing State has given its consent to the jurisdiction of the
Centre before notifying the depositary of its denunciation of the Convention, and if an
investor has given its consent in writing when the Convention was still in force for the
denouncing State, the mutual consent of both parties is in existence and constitutes a
binding arbitration agreement.

The Tribunal is of the view that, as long as Venezuela was a Party to the ICSID
Convention, it was open to the Claimant (Transban) to give its consent in writing to
ICSID arbitration, Venezuela’s consent having already been given in 1995 when its BIT
with Barbados entered into force. The last day when Venezuela was a Contracting State
to the ICSID Convention was July 24, 2012.

This brings the Tribunal to the issue whether Transban has given its consent in a timely
manner.

Transban expressed its consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre in its RfA. That Request
is dated July 24, 2012. That same day the Request was received in electronic form by
the ICSID Secretariat. Article 25, paragraph 1, of the ICSID Convention requires that
consent to submit an investment dispute to the Centre must be in “writing”. Further,
Article 36, paragraph 1 of the Convention provides that a request for arbitration shall be
addressed in writing to the Secretary-General. The question is whether this requirement
can be satisfied by a scanned copy of the Request, duly signed, having been sent as an
attachment to an email addressed to the Secretary-General of the ICSID, if that scanned
copy is subsequently “confirmed” by receipt of an original hard copy of the Request
(with the required number of additional copies) by the ICSID Secretariat, as happened
in this case.°”

When the Convention in its Article 25 requires consent to be given “in writing”, it makes
clear that it has to be expressed in a written form, i.e., expressed in a recorded paper
form, not just orally. Having consent in written form makes it much easier to prove its
existence.”® In the present case, there is no doubt that the Claimant consented to the
jurisdiction of the Centre, its consent having been expressed through written words in
the RfA. There is also no doubt that this consent was given on July 24, 2012 when
ICSID received a scanned copy of the RfA, annexed to an email from Counsel for the
Claimant. ICSID thus became aware of this consent from the moment of the receipt of
the scanned copy of the RfA.

°7 The original hard copy was received by the ICSID Secretariat on July 25, 2012 (Exhibit R-0002).
°8 One may recall the Latin maxim Littera scripta manet.

18

89. In the view of the Tribunal, it is necessary to distinguish between giving consent to
arbitration, even when it is expressed in the RfA, and the filing of such a request. The
date of giving consent and the date of filing a request may not coincide, the latter may
follow the former.

90. The RfA has to be a written document, as specified in Article 36, paragraph 1, of the
ICSID Convention which provides that a party “wishing to institute arbitration
proceedings shall address a request to that effect in writing to the Secretary-General who

shall send a copy of the request to the other party”.°?

91. The Tribunal notes that, when the Convention was adopted in 1965, no such modern
means of communication as sending documents by facsimile or scanning and emailing
them were known or contemplated. All these technological developments came later. !°
In the view of the Tribunal, the term “in writing” should be interpreted in a reasonable
way as encompassing developments in technology. In fact, as the International Court of
Justice has observed “where the parties have used generic terms in a treaty, the parties
necessarily having been aware that the meaning of the terms was likely to evolve over
time, and where the treaty has been entered into for a very long period or is ‘of continuing
duration’, the parties must be presumed, as a general rule, to have intended those terms
to have an evolving meaning”.'°! The Tribunal refers to a similar line of reasoning in
the “Recommendation regarding the interpretation of article II, paragraph 2, and Article
VII, paragraph 1, of the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement Foreign
Arbitral Awards, done in New York, 10 June 1958” adopted by UNCITRAL on July 7,
2006. It recommends that the requirements in Article II (2) of the 1958 Convention,
which includes an “in writing” requirement, should “be applied recognizing that the
circumstances described therein are not exhaustive.” !°?

92. The Tribunal observes that not only was the RfA in its scanned copy, received on
July 24, 2012, but also the original was mailed by a courier service in Florida the same
day and delivered to the ICSID Secretariat the following day. Further, on July 24, 2012,
the Claimant wired the required fee for lodging the Request, the fee having been received
the same day by ICSID in its bank account.

93. The Tribunal concludes that the Claimant expressed its consent timely, at a time when
Venezuela was still a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal further
finds that the Claimant filed its Request with the Secretary-General of ICSID when the
Centre was still open for either arbitral or conciliation proceedings to be instituted

VI. OBJECTION TO JURISDICTION RATIONE PERSONAE: ABSENCE OF A
PROTECTED INVESTOR

1. Companies as Protected Investors Pursuant to Article 1(d) of the BIT

94. In its second objection to the jurisdiction of the Centre, Venezuela argues that Transban
does not qualify as a foreign investor protected under the ICSID Convention and the
BIT.'™ Article 1(d) of the BIT defines companies for its purposes. It provides that

‘companies’ means, in respect of each Contracting Party, corporations,
firms and associations incorporated or constituted under the law in
force in that Contracting Party;

For the purposes of the Convention referred to in Article 8!
‘Company’ shall include any company incorporated or constituted
under the law in force in one Contracting Party which is owned or
effectively controlled by Nationals or companies of the other
Contracting Party.

a. Position of the Respondent

95.  Transban was initially incorporated under the laws of Venezuela in 1996.!°° Its original
name was Inversiones Cibanca, C.A., until it opted for a second name, Inversiones
Transbanca, C.A. in 1998, which was subsequently replaced by its current name,
Transban Investments Corp., in 2000.'°7 Venezuela argues that Transban is not a
“company” of Barbados. Article 1(d) of the BIT requires that a company must have been
“... incorporated or constituted under the law in force in that Contracting Party” to be a
company of that Contracting Party.!° Venezuela contends that Article 1(d) of the BIT
applies to companies constituted or incorporated under the laws of Barbados, but not to
companies “continued” under those same laws.'®? Venezuela submits that Transban
does not meet this requirement since it was incorporated under the laws of Venezuela in
1996, not those of Barbados, and merely changed its domicile to Barbados on August 1,
2001, which “does not entail a change of nationality.”!!°

96. Venezuela turns to Article 42 of the ICSID Convention and argues that, in the absence
of an agreement in the BIT on the law applicable to the dispute, the Tribunal must apply
the laws of Venezuela, including its rules on conflicts of laws, as well as relevant rules

103 Arbitrator Dr. Santiago Torres Bernardez does not share this conclusion. As explained in the opinion he has
appended to the Award as Annex A, he would have upheld the ratione temporis preliminary objection.

of international law.''!' Venezuela argues that, pursuant to Article 20 of the Law of

International Private Law of Venezuela, matters pertaining to the capacity, operation and
dissolution of Transban are governed by the laws of Venezuela.''? On the basis of
Transban’s alleged corporate continuance pursuant to the Barbados Companies Act,
Venezuela considers Section 356.1(1) of the Barbados Companies Act applicable to
corporate continuance, as an additional basis for deeming Venezuelan corporate law
applicable to the present dispute: Section 356.1(1) of the Barbados Companies Act sets,
as a prerequisite, the authorization of corporate continuance under the laws of the
originating jurisdiction, in this case Venezuela.'!? Venezuela acknowledges and admits
that re-domiciling a corporate entity in a foreign jurisdiction is not prohibited under
Venezuelan law,''* but argues that inasmuch as corporate continuance to another
country is not provided for under Venezuelan law, no prescribed procedure for such a
transfer exists.!!> In the absence of a treaty allowing such re-domiciliation, Venezuela
argues that a corporation would need to be dissolved in Venezuela before being re-
incorporated abroad.!!°

Venezuela recalls that the disputing Parties and the Tribunal agreed, in section 15.1 of
Procedural Order No. 1, to guidance from the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in
International Arbitration for purposes of document production.'!? Venezuela turns to
IBA Rule 9.5 as a basis to argue that the Tribunal should draw three negative inferences
from the document production failures of Transban.'!® First suggested negative
inference: Transban has preserved its Venezuelan nationality, !'!? notably since Transban
has presented no evidence to demonstrate that Transban actually succeeded Inversiones
Transbanca, C.A.!°

Second negative inference: Inversiones Transbanca, C.A. was never validly terminated,
notably through dissolution or liquidation, and never effectively changed its name to
Transban.'?! Transban provided no proof that it had cancelled its registration with the
Commercial Registry of the State of Miranda, Venezuela.'?? Article 280 of the
Commercial Code of Venezuela imposes a quorum of 75% of the shareholders of a
company to validly dissolve a corporation; since Transban did not validly change the
required quorum!” and since Transban’s decision to re-domicile in Barbados was

adopted with a quorum of 68% of shareholders, that decision was invalid and without
effect.!*4 Therefore, Transban never ceased to be a Venezuelan company. !?°

99. Third negative inference: the actual seat of Transban’s business has remained located in
Venezuela.'”° Venezuela points to the absence of evidence that Transban ceased to do
business in Venezuela and underlines that Transban modified nothing to its activities or
corporate control upon changing its domicile to Barbados.'7” Venezuela argues that an
absence of change to Transban’s corporate purpose in its bylaws means no change of
legal personality and therefore no change of nationality. !7*

b. Position of the Claimant

100. Transban underlines that Article 1(d) of the BIT determines corporate nationality and
defines a “company” only by reference to its place of incorporation or constitution!”
and specifies that the law in force in Barbados applies and is exclusively determinative
for such purpose.'*” Transban rejects Venezuela’s argument that one needs to turn to
Venezuelan law pursuant to Article 42 of the ICSID Convention and denies the existence
of any conflict of law; on the contrary, Article 1(d) of the BIT provides specifically that
Barbados law will govern the issue of determining incorporation or constitution of a

company. !*!

101. Transban shareholders voted in favour of changing Transban’s domicile to Barbados on
December 5, 2000.'*? Transban dismisses the notion that the decision to re-domicile in
Barbados is invalid due to a shareholder quorum set higher in Article 280 of the
Commercial Code (75%) to that complied with by Transban (687%), since the quorum in
Article 280 applies only where a company’s bylaws do not mandate a different quorum;
Transban’s bylaws specified that the requisite quorum was set at 66%.'*?_ The quorum
change was accepted and published by the Commercial Registry of Venezuela without
any objection. '*+

102. Transban shareholders voted to amend its bylaws so as to reflect its change of domicile
in accordance with Article 203 of the Commercial Code.'*> Transban registered the
shareholder minutes with the Commercial Registry of Venezuela and published the
minutes in Venezuela’s Repertorio Forense so as to notify third parties in accordance
with Article 221 of the Commercial Code, and then notified Venezuelan tax authorities
that Transban would cease to be a Venezuelan company.!*° The Commercial Registry
of Venezuela accepted and registered Transban’s decision to re-domicile in Barbados
without any objection. !77

103. The Commercial Registry of Venezuela had the duty to deny publication of a document
that contravened applicable law.'** The publication of Transban’s quorum change!*?
and of Transban’s decision to re-domicile in Barbados have never been challenged, and
Venezuela is now estopped from challenging them; nor can anyone else challenge such
decisions fifteen years later due to the statute of limitations. '4°

104. Transban did not produce a certificate of discontinuance or of termination of its
incorporation in Venezuela because such a certificate does not exist under Venezuelan
law and cannot be obtained: the Commercial Registry of Venezuela is not statutorily
empowered to certify the termination of a Venezuelan corporation by issuing a
certificate of termination or of discontinuance. '*!

105. Tore-domicile in Barbados, Transban needed to achieve corporate continuance pursuant
to Section 356.1 of the Barbados Companies Act! by complying with the requirements
set out in Part III, Division D of the Barbados Companies Act. 43 Transban’s Board of
Directors accordingly initiated the change of domicile by executing Articles of
Continuance and filing the same with the Barbadian Registrar on December 29, 2000.'4
Transban was legally continued to Barbados as a result of the issuance of Transban’s
Certificate of Continuance by the Barbadian Registrar on August 17, 2001.'45

106. Transban argues that the issuance by Barbadian authorities of a Certificate of
Continuance in 2001 has the same effect as incorporation under Barbadian law and
deprives Transban’s initial incorporation in Venezuela of any relevance. '*° In essence,
Transban argues that “the change of domicile is [legally and effectively] equivalent to
incorporating in Barbados,” '*’ that Transban’s Certificate of Continuance effectively

deems it an entity originally incorporated in Barbados,'4* and that Transban is a

company incorporated under the laws of Barbados for purposes of Article 1(d) of the
BIT.'*? Transban further argues that the Certificate of Continuance constitutes a fact
and an “unchallenged and unassailable” decision nearly fifteen years after its
issuance. !*°

107. Transban explains that the Barbados Companies Act treats companies re-domiciled in
Barbados as a result of continuance the same way as companies originally incorporated
in the Barbados: Section 356.2(2) of the Barbados Companies Act states that articles of
continuance become the company’s articles of incorporation, that a certificate of
continuance amounts to a certificate of incorporation, and that the Barbados Companies
Act applies to a continued company “as if the company had been incorporated under this
Act.”! Moreover, the definition of “company” set forth in Section 2(1)(b) of the
Barbados Companies Act extends to entities “incorporated or continued” under the
Barbados Companies Act.'°> Following continuance, Transban remained the same
entity in terms of assets and liabilities: it retained its “organic whole”'>*, but became
subject to a new legal regime and by the same token adopted Barbadian nationality.“

108. Transban considers “difficult to follow” Venezuela’s argument that a lack of change in
corporate purpose or activities reflects a lack of change in corporate existence, structure
and nationality: these two aspects are not causally related and Venezuela cites no
authority in support of its position. '°°

109. Regarding the requirement under Section 356.1(1) of the Barbados Companies Act that
corporate continuance be authorised by the laws of Venezuela, Transban and its expert
on Barbadian law argue that this requirement must be construed as “not specifically
prohibited” and that therefore authorization of corporate continuance under the laws of
the originating jurisdiction is assumed.'*°

 

110. Transban dismisses the existence of a conflict of law since Barbadian corporate law
authorizes corporate continuance so long as no specific prohibition exists in the
originating jurisdiction and since Venezuelan law does not prohibit continuance to
another jurisdiction.!°’ Transban further notes the admission by Venezuela that

Transban’s expert, Mr. Carmichael, further distinguishes continued companies from “external companies,”
whose formation under the laws of another country is acknowledged by Section 324(1)(a) of the Barbados
Companies Act, and reincorporation which necessitates the liquidation and dissolution of the original corporate
entity prior to the incorporation of a new entity: see TCMJ, para. 77; Carmichael Expert Report, paras. 19-20.

Venezuelan law does not prohibit continuance in a foreign jurisdiction.'°* Transban
argues that Venezuelan law allows re-domiciling or corporate continuance in a foreign
jurisdiction! and that the change of domicile is not a matter of public order under
Venezuelan law: a juridical person’s freedom and full capacity to act are enshrined in
Article 112 of the Venezuelan Constitution and are limited only by specific prohibitions
provided by law; Article 203 of the Commercial Code recognizes a juridical person’s
freedom to choose its domicile; and Article 335 of the Commercial Code acknowledges
a juridical person’s ability to transform its status, notably through continuance abroad,
without dissolution or liquidation. !°°

111. Moreover, the Barbados Companies Act does not require that dissolution or liquidation

in the originating jurisdiction intervene as a prerequisite for achieving corporate
continuance.'®! Under Barbadian law, corporate continuance would entail, as a practical
and assumed consequence, the cessation of the incorporation in the originating
jurisdiction.'© However, there is no requirement under the Barbados Companies Act to
file any proof of corporate discontinuance or termination from the originating
jurisdiction in order to achieve corporate continuance in Barbados,'® nor was Transban
obligated under Venezuelan law to accomplish any additional steps following the
issuance of its Certificate of Continuance by the Barbadian Registrar. '*

112. The issuance of the Certificate of Continuance means that the requirements that had to

be met prior to its issuance had been satisfied: as the supreme administrative authority
on corporate matters, the Barbadian Registrar had the duty to determine whether the
corporation petitioning for continuance faced a prohibition of continuance in its
jurisdiction of origin; the issuance of the Certificate of Continuance stands for the
finding that there was no such prohibition under Venezuelan law.'®

113. The date of issuance of Transban’s Certificate of Continuance, i.e., 17 August 2001,

mentioned that an affidavit by a Barbadian lawyer had accompanied Transban

therefore stands as the moment when Transban became a Barbados company.'®° Since
then, Transban has paid no taxes, has had no employees and has paid no social security
in Venezuela; Transban has undertaken no action that suggests it is a Venezuelan

company. !©7

2. Companies of the Nationality of the Contracting State Party to the Dispute

a. Position of the Respondent

114. According to Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, both of the following corporate
entities are alternatively eligible to submit investment disputes to ICSID:

[i] any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State
other than the State party to the dispute ... and [ii] any juridical person
which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute
... and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should
be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of
this Convention.

115. Venezuela argues that Article 25 of the ICSID Convention establishes objective outer
limits to the jurisdiction of tribunals: as a general rule, such jurisdiction can be exercised
only in respect of disputes between a Contracting State and nationals of another
Contracting State.'** Article 25(2)(b) in fine of the ICSID Convention provides an
exception to this general rule:'©? Venezuela and Barbados may characterise a company
(in this case, Transban) incorporated in the Contracting State Party to a dispute (in this
case, Venezuela) as an investor of another Contracting State’s nationality (in this case,
Barbados) provided that such company is subject to “foreign control” (i.e., non-
Venezuelan control) (Article 25(2)(b) in fine of the ICSID Convention).!”° Article 1(d)
in fine of the BIT echoes Article 25(2)(b) in fine of the ICSID Convention by stipulating
that, for purposes of Article 8 of the BIT (settlement of disputes), the term “company”
further includes a company (in this case, Transban) incorporated in the Contracting Party
to the dispute (in this case, Venezuela), but which “is owned or effectively controlled by
nationals or companies of” the other Contracting Party (in this case, Barbados).!7!

116. Venezuela argues that Transban has retained its Venezuelan nationality and that
either Transban has dual Barbadian and Venezuelan nationalities or Transban never
properly acquired Barbadian nationality and therefore only has Venezuelan
nationality.'’* Venezuela underlines that Transban did not produce any proof that its
incorporation in Venezuela had been terminated.'”* As a result, Venezuela argues
that Transban’s RfA must be examined in light of Article 25(2)(b) in fine of the ICSID
Convention.

117. Venezuela argues that Transban could not prove that nationals or companies of Barbados
controlled it even if it tried.'* Venezuela further alleges that Transban provided no
evidence as to the ownership or effective control over Transban!”> and calls for a fourth

negative inference under IBA Rule 9.5: that Transban shareholders, directors,
controlling persons and ultimate beneficiaries are Venezuelan nationals and that
Transban’s management structure has remained unchanged since its incorporation in
Venezuela.!”° Venezuela alleges that the true owners of the investments allegedly made
by Transban are Venezuelan nationals;'’” that predecessor corporation Inversiones
Cibanca, C.A. was incorporated by two Venezuelan nationals and had Venezuelan
nationals as shareholders; '’8 that individuals of Venezuelan nationality and/or domiciled
in Venezuela owned a majority interest in Transban back in 2000;'”° that six Venezuelan
individuals, all seemingly members of the Velutini family, appear to conduct business
in Venezuela on behalf of Transban, '*° and that Transban’s Directors are all domiciled
in Venezuela.'*! Venezuela further alleges that the cross-examination of Mr. Zambrano
provided affirmative evidence leading to the same conclusions as the negative inferences
put forward by Venezuela, rendering such negative inferences unnecessary. !*?

118. Notwithstanding Article 1(d) of the BIT, Venezuela alleges that there exists under
international law a requirement for “a real connection between a company and the State
whose nationality is invoked” amounting to a “substantial and effective relation”: !*? in
other words, an “effective and actual nationality” !*4 test. Venezuela constructs such a
requirement by combining two cases: Nottebohm, in which the International Court of
Justice decided that a State exercising diplomatic protection on behalf of natural persons
had to substantiate a “genuine connection” with such individuals, '8° and Barcelona
Traction, in which the Court suggested the possibility of lifting the corporate veil notably
“to prevent the misuse of the privileges of legal personality”.'*° Venezuela invokes a
number of investor-State arbitral awards rendered by tribunals which have cited the
Court’s views expressed in Nottebohm and in Barcelona Traction.'*’ Venezuela further
submits that Transban is incapable of claiming Barbadian nationality on the basis of such
atest. '88

b. Position of the Claimant

119. Transban argues that neither Article 1(d) in fine of the BIT nor Article 25(2)(b) in fine
of the ICSID Convention find application in the present case and need not be
addressed:'*° Transban proved its incorporation under the laws of Barbados and
therefore corresponds to a national of Barbados for purposes of the first part of Article
1(d) of the BIT and the first part of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.'*° Both
Article 1(d) in fine of the BIT and Article 25(2)(b) in fine of the ICSID Convention thus
become inapplicable, since Venezuela’s line of reasoning hinges on finding that
Transban has remained a company incorporated in Venezuela and does not constitute a
company incorporated under the laws of Barbados.

120. Transban counters that neither Nottebohm nor Barcelona Traction can override the
nationality criterion expressly set out in the first part of Article 1(d) of the BIT, and that
ICSID jurisprudence has clearly endorsed prioritising and not overwriting clear and
specific treaty-based criteria for determining corporate nationality.!?!  Transban
underlines that none of Venezuela’s authorities pertain to the first part of Article 25(2)(b)
of the ICSID Convention! and that the first part of Article 1(d) of the BIT clearly
acknowledges incorporation under the laws of a State as sufficient for ascribing the
nationality of the incorporating State to a company, a view supported by numerous
arbitral awards. !°5

nationality, and that “[a] systematic interpretation of Art. 25(2)(b) would militate against the use of the control

request, as well as for the argument that neither the BIT, nor the ICSID Convention
provides for protection of an investor of the host State against the host State!® or of a
“mere shell or ... ‘company of convenience’”.!? Venezuela further urges the Tribunal
to abstain from exercising its jurisdiction so as to avoid an abuse of the ICSID
mechanism.”

122. Venezuela considers that fulfilling Barbadian corporate requirements cannot detract
from the fact that Transban’s business is conducted by Venezuelan nationals from within
Venezuela. Venezuela further accuses the Velutini family and other Venezuelan
nationals of having used Transban and its change of domicile from Venezuela to
Barbados in order to manufacture jurisdiction under the BIT and to benefit from tax
advantages.?°!

b. Position of the Claimant

123. Transban counters that the tribunal in TSA Spectrum proceeded to pierce the corporate
veil in the context of applying Article 25(2)(b) in fine of the ICSID Convention and that
the tribunal in Loewen refused to entertain the piercing of any corporate veil.”
Transban underlines that neither Nottebohm nor Barcelona Traction, as construed by
Venezuela, has found application within ICSID arbitral awards or decisions.”
Transban rejects the notion that the Venezuelan nationality of some of its management
team or of some of its shareholders warrants concocting an unwritten denial of benefits
clause to exclude Transban from protection under the BIT.7°

124. Venezuela knew or should have known that Barbados law provided for the existence of
holding companies or international business corporations with little actual operations in
Barbados; Venezuela could have proposed a different definition of “company” in Article
1(d) of the BIT so as to exclude such corporations if it had wished to do so.

125. Transban further responds by underlining the propriety of prospective nationality
planning so as long as it occurs at a time when the dispute is not yet cognizable.”

Transban insists that the incorporation and domiciliation of Transban in Barbados (in
2001) occurred many years before the events “giving rise to the dispute” (in
2007-2009),?07 at a time when the dispute was not foreseeable, and that “there is no
evidence of abuse or misuse of legal personality.”?°° Transban argues that formal
definitions of nationality should be disregarded “only to prevent a ‘misuse of power
conferred by the law’” and only to prevent “an abuse of the system of international
investment protection.” Transban notes that the high threshold to be met before
finding an abuse of process requires “very exceptional circumstances” absent from the
present dispute.?!°

126. Transban refutes Venezuela’s allegation that it “merely ‘pretended to relocate’” and
turns to its expert of Barbadian corporate law who describes the practice of companies
indicating the address of their law firms as their registered office as “entirely normal
and, in fact, customary”.”!! As a holding company, Transban has held numerous
investments in various jurisdictions; as an international business corporation endowed
with Barbadian nationality, Transban is not authorised to conduct business in
Barbados.”!?. Transban has maintained its good standing and its ability to do business
under Barbados law without interruption; Transban has filed annual tax returns with the
Barbadian Department of Inland Revenue, has paid its taxes and annual fees, has an
office in Barbados, and Transban’s shareholder and board of directors meetings have
taken place in Barbados.?!*

127. Transban disagrees that it produced no evidence as to its ownership214 and rejects any
negative inference under IBA Rule 9.5: Transban argues that it lived up to its document
discovery obligations in good faith and to the best of its abilities; moreover, Transban
produced numerous documents on the very issues in respect of which Venezuela asks
the Tribunal to draw negative inferences for lack of documentary evidence produced.”!°
Transban notably refers to a list of many hundreds of shareholders, which dispels any
notion that ownership of Transban is closely or family held,?!® and to a number of
shareholder meetings which took place in Barbados as attested by minutes made
available to Venezuela through document production.?!”

4. Analysis by the Tribunal

128.

129.

130.

 

In order to enjoy the rights and protection accorded by the BIT, including the right to
institute international arbitral proceedings with ICSID under Article 8(1) of the BIT, the
Claimant must satisfy the jurisdictional requirements set by the BIT. Article 8(1) of the
BIT provides that:

[d]isputes between one Contracting Party and a national or company of
the other Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the former under
this Agreement in relation to an investment of the latter shall, at the
request of the national concerned, be submitted to the International
Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes for settlement by
arbitration or conciliation under the Convention on the Settlement of
Investment Disputes between States and nationals of other States,
opened for signature at Washington on March 18, 1965.?!8

The Tribunal observes that this quoted text in English uses two terms when describing
the dispute, namely “a national” and “a company”. When describing who may submit
the request to ICSID, however, the text refers only to “the national concerned”. It seems
that the drafters of the English version of the BIT were influenced by the phrasing of the
ICSID Convention.”!? However, the Spanish version of the BIT in Article 8(1) refers to
“un nacional 0 sociedad de la otra Parte Contractante” not only when it qualifies the
disputes which may be submitted to the ICSID either for arbitration or conciliation but
also when it describes who may submit such a request (. . .se sometera, a solicitud del
nacional o la sociedad interesada, al Centro . . 2.70

The Respondent has not raised an objection (and rightly so) that a company has no right
under the BIT to institute arbitral proceeding in ICSID. Rather, the Respondent’s
objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione personae is based on the argument that
Claimant does not satisfy the requirements to be considered a company of Barbados for
the purposes of the BIT as that term is defined in its Article 1(d). That provision reads
as follows:

For the purposes of this Agreement:

(d) ‘companies’ means, in respect of each Contracting Party,
corporations, firms and associations incorporated or constituted under
the law in force in that Contracting Party;

For the purposes of the Convention referred to in Article 8 [i.e., the 1965
Washington Convention] ‘Company’ shall include any company

incorporated or constituted under the law in force in one Contracting

sis added.

2! See Article 25(1) and (2) of the ICSID Convention, paragraph 2 defining the term “national” used in
paragraph | thereof.
220 See UNTS, vol. 1984, p. 169. The Parties signed the BIT in both languages, English and Spanish, and as the

Spanish text indicates

 

ndo ambos textos igualmente auténticos” (both texts being equally authentic). This

clause is missing in the English version of the BIT. The UNTS however indicates that the authentic texts are
Spanish and English and that the BIT was registered by Venezuela on 28 July 1997.

Party which is owned or effectively controlled by nationals or
companies of the other Contracting Party.

Claimant in asserting jurisdiction argues that it is a Barbadian company which has
invested in Venezuela; it does not argue that it is a Venezuelan company effectively
controlled by nationals of Barbados or companies of that Contracting Party. The second
part of the Article 1(d) definition is thus of no relevance for the purposes of the case at
hand.77!

The Tribunal will therefore focus its attention on the definition of a company for the
purposes of the BIT. It is not disputed that Transban is a corporation; the Respondent
has not contended that Transban is not organized as a corporation. What the Respondent
argues is that Transban, although a corporation, is not “incorporated or constituted under
the law in force in [Barbados]”.

The Claimant was originally incorporated in Venezuela under its laws in December 1996
with the name Inversiones Cibanca, C.A., with its address in Caracas. According to the
Certificate of Registration and the Third Clause governing the company it has been
established for “the duration . . . of fifty (50) years as of the date it is recorded in the

Commerce Registry”.?”?

In 1998 the company changed its name, while remaining incorporated in Venezuela and
maintaining its address in Caracas, to “Inversiones Transbanca, C.AL”.23

There is no dispute between the Parties that throughout that period, between 1996 and
2000 the Claimant was incorporated under the laws of Venezuela as a Venezuelan
company.

On December 5, 2000 the shareholders of Inversiones Transbanca, C.A., voted for
changing “the company’s address to the Island of Barbados”.?*+ The Chairman of the
Board further “proposed authorizing the opening of branch offices both in Caracas,
Republic of Venezuela, and in New York, United States of America”.?”> It appears from
the Minutes of the Shareholders’ meeting that it was decided, in connection with moving
the address of the company to St. Michael in Barbados, to change the name of the
company. It was thus resolved to amend the First and the Third Clauses in the
company’s Charter By-laws, which refer to the name and the address of the company.
The name of the company was changed to “Transban Investments Corp.”?°

The Shareholders’ meeting further authorized three Venezuelan nationals, Messrs. Jose
Antonio Muci Borjas, Hernando Diaz Candia and Alejandro Alvarez, “to execute and
process all legal procedures for the constitution and incorporation of the company in the

the corresponding [i.e. Venezuelan] Commercial Registry”.?””

138. The Minutes of the Shareholders’ Meeting reveal that the intention was that “the

company w[ould] be sheltered by the laws of the Constitutional Monarchy of Barbados
as a company of international business under the International Business Companies
Act.?228

139. The above short history of the company in the period 1996-2000 shows that it was

established as a Venezuelan company by Venezuelan nationals and incorporated under
the laws of Venezuela. Further, it appears that this Venezuelan company was not
liquidated or dissolved before the end of 2000 when it decided to change its address to
Barbados and also to change its name. In fact, had it been dissolved before the end of
2000 it could not have “continued” in Barbados.”

140. It is now for the Tribunal to determine whether this Venezuelan company, with its name

changed to Transban Investments Corp., has subsequently been incorporated or
constituted under the law in force in Barbados and ceased to be incorporated in
Venezuela as a Venezuelan company. Only if this has been the case it may qualify as a
company for the purposes of the BIT. This requirement flows from the definition of
“companies” in Article 1(d) of the BIT, as well as from its object and purpose which
have to be taken into account when interpreting the BIT as provided for in customary
international law on interpretation of treaties as codified in Articles 31 and 32 of the
Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. The Preamble, where usually the object and
purpose of a treaty is expressed”, states that the two governments have agreed on the
BIT “desiring to strengthen the traditional ties of friendship between their countries, to
extend and intensify the economic relations between them, particularly with respect to
investments by nationals and companies of one Contracting Party in the territory of the
other Contracting Party”. The purpose and object of the BIT is thus to encourage and
protect the investments made by nationals and companies of Barbados in Venezuela and
by nationals and companies of Venezuela in Barbados.

141. Following its application in Barbados, Transban received on August 17, 2001 a

227
228
229
230

Certificate of Continuance issued by Barbadian Registrar of Companies, which certifies
that Transban “was continued as set out in the attached Articles of Continuance, under
section 356.2(1) of the Companies Act of Barbados.””*! The Certificate of Continuance
and the Articles of Continuance of December 29, 2000 indicate that Transban
Investments Corp. possesses in Barbados the company no. 19481. The Articles of
Continuance also provide restrictions on the business that the company may carry on:
“The Company shall not engage in any business other than international business as
defined in the International Business Companies Act, 1991-24.” “International
business” is defined in Barbados’ International Business Companies Act as “the business

of international manufacturing or international trade and commerce.”?*?. The Act itself
provides that

[i]ts purposes are to revise the law governing international business
companies carrying on the business of international manufacturing or
international trade and commerce from within Barbados with a view to

(a) encouraging the development of Barbados as a responsible
international financial centre;

(b) provision of incentives by way of tax reductions, exemptions
and benefits for international manufacturing and international trade and
commerce from within Barbados.?**

Transban thus cannot engage in domestic economic activity in Barbados. The amended
section 9(7) of the International Business Companies Act provides that “[a] licensee
shall not engage in any business than international business.”?*+

142. The Articles of Continuance indicate in a section entitled “Details of incorporation”, that
“Tt]he company was originally incorporated under the name ‘Inversiones Cibanca, C.A’
in the second Commercial Registry of the Office of the Federal District and the State of
Miranda on December 19, 1996 under Number 56, Volume 695-A Sgdo. The
company’s name was changed to ‘Inversiones Transbanca, C.A’.”235

143. It appears from the above that Transban was not strictly speaking, in the language of the
BIT, “incorporated or constituted under the law of Barbados”?**, but rather had moved
to and “continued” in Barbados in accordance with the relevant provisions of Barbados’
Companies Act?*’. The Tribunal must therefore consider whether “continuance” should
be regarded as sat ing the requirement under the BIT of Claimant being “incorporated
or constituted under the law of Barbados”.

 

144. The Companies Act consists of five Parts. Part I is entitled “Formation and Operation
of Companies” and is divided into 12 Divisions. Division A bears the title
“Incorporation of Companies”. Subsection 4(1) of the Companies Act provides that
“subject to subsection (2), one or more persons may incorporate a company by signing
and sending articles of incorporations to the Registrar of Companies”.*** There is no
evidence, and it is not claimed, that Transban would have been established in Barbados
in this way, under subsection 4 (1) of Part I, that is by signing and sending articles of
incorporation to the Registrar of Companies. Nor is there any evidence that the Registrar
of Companies would have issued to Transban a Certificate of Incorporation in

accordance with Section 404. Such certificate is a conclusive proof of the incorporation
of a company named in the certificate. A company comes into existence on the date
shown in its certificate of incorporation.?*

The relevant provisions of Barbados’ Companies Act relating to Transban moving to
Barbados are to be found in Part III ~*° entitled “Other Registered Companies”. Part IIL
consists of eight Divisions”*!. Of particular relevance for the Tribunal’s analysis are the
provisions of Division D, entitled “Corporate Mobility”, upon which the Parties focused
their arguments.

It is useful to reproduce the text of this Division relevant for the analysis of Transban’s
situation. It reads as follows:

DIVISION D
CORPORATE MOBILITY
356.1. (1) A body corporate that is then incorporated in a jurisdiction other than
Barbados may, if so authorised under the laws of that other jurisdiction, apply to the

Registrar for a certificate of continuance under this Act.

(2) An application under subsection (1) must be made by articles of continuance in the
prescribed form.

(3) Articles of continuance may, without so stating in the articles, effect any amendment
to the corporate instruments of the body corporate that applies for continuance under this

section, if the amendment

(a) is authorised in accordance with the law applicable to the body corporate before
continuance under this Act; and

(b) is an amendment that a company incorporated under this Act is entitled to make to its
articles.

356.2. (1) Upon receipt of articles of continuance, the Registrar may issue a certificate
of continuance in accordance with section 404.

(2) On the date shown in the certificate of continuance

(a) the body corporate becomes a company to which this Act applies as ifthe company
had been incorporated under this Act;

(b) the articles of continuance become the articles of incorporation of the continued
company; and

239 See Sections 8 and 9 of the Companies Act of Barbados (Exhibit CL-0125).

~0 Part II of the Companies Act is entitled “Protection of Creditors and Investores”, Part IV “Winding-Up” and
Part V “Administration and General”. They are not relevant for the purpose of the analysis of the Respondent’s
objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione personae.

*4! The eight divisions of Part III are as follows: Division A: Companies without Share Capital, B: External
Companies, C: Former-Act Companies, C.1: Statutory Companies, D: Corporate Mobility, E: Mutual Insurance
Companies, F: Companies with a Separate Account Structure, G: Segregated Cell Companies.

35

(c) except for the purpose of section 62, the certificate of continuance is the certificate
of incorporation of the continued company.

356.3. When a body corporate is continued as a company under this Act, sections 353 and
354 apply, with such modifications as the circumstances require, to the continued
company as if it had been a former-Act company continued under this Act.

356.4. (1) Subject to section 356.5, a company may
(a) if it is authorised by its shareholders in accordance with this section; and

(b) if it is established to the satisfaction of the Registrar that its proposed continuance
in another jurisdiction will not adversely affect its creditors or shareholders, apply to the
appropriate official or public body of the other jurisdiction and request that the company be
continued as a corporation in the other jurisdiction as if it had been incorporated under the
laws of that other jurisdiction.

(2) A notice of a meeting of shareholders complying with section 109 must be sent in
accordance with that section to each shareholder and must state that a dissenting shareholder
is entitled to be paid the fair value of his shares in accordance with sections 213 to 222; but a
failure to make that statement does not invalidate a continuance effected in another
jurisdiction pursuant to an application made otherwise in accordance with this section.

(3) Each share of a company carries the right to vote in respect of acontinuance in another
jurisdiction whether or notit otherwise carries a right to vote.

(4) Anapplication for continuance in another jurisdiction becomes authorised when the
shareholders voting thereon have approved the continuance by special resolution.

(5) The directors of a company may, if authorised by the shareholders at the time of
approving an application under this section for continuance of the company in another
jurisdiction, abandon the application without further approval of the shareholders.

356.5. A company may not apply for continuance in another jurisdiction, nor may it
be continued under the laws of another jurisdiction, as a body corporate incorporated in that
other jurisdiction pursuant to section 356.4 unless the laws of that other jurisdiction
provide in effect that

(a) the property of the company continues to be the property of the body corporate;

(b) the body corporate continues to be liable for the obligations of the company;

(c) any existing cause of action, claim or liability to prosecution is unaffected;

(d) — accivil, criminal or administrative action or proceeding pending by or against the
company can be continued to be prosecuted by or against the body corporate; and

(e) aconviction against or ruling order or judgment in favour of or against, the company
can be enforced by or against the body corporate.

356.6. (1) Upon receipt of notice satisfactory to him that a company that has made
an application under section 356.4 has been continued as a corporation under the laws of
another jurisdiction, the Registrar must file the notice and issue a certificate of
discontinuance in accordance with section 404.

243,

(2) After a certificate of discontinuance is issued under subsection (1) in respect of a
company that is continued as a corporation under the laws of another jurisdiction, the
corporation thereupon becomes an external company for all the purposes of this Act.

(3) The notice described in subsection (1) is, for the purposes of section 404, articles
that conform to law.

Transban submitted its application to the Registrar of Companies under Section
356.1. (1) of the Companies Act. It is not disputed that it fulfilled the condition set in
that Section to be “then [i.e., at the moment of application] incorporated in a jurisdiction
other than Barbados” since it was in 2000-2001 (at least until August 17, 2001) still
incorporated in Venezuela.

The other condition in Section 356.1. (1) for the company applying for the Certificate of
Continuance is that it is “so authorised under the laws of that other [i-e., non-Barbadian]
jurisdiction” in which the applying company is incorporated. The Parties disagree as to
whether the laws of Venezuela “authorise” companies incorporated in Venezuela to
apply for continuance in other jurisdictions. It is this requirement of Barbadian law that
leads the Tribunal’s analysis to Venezuelan law.

The Respondent argued that “Venezuelan law does not authorize a Venezuelan sociedad
anoénima to ‘continue’ in Barbados”; that “[w]hat you will find in Venezuela is the
change of domicile within the territory [of Venezuela]”, but that “[t]he idea of an
international transfer of the seat of the company, that idea of continuance is just simply
completely ignored by the Venezuelan legal system” .?

The Respondent, however, in answering a question of the Tribunal at the hearing
admitted that “there is no prohibition in statute” in Venezuelan law to re-domicile a
corporate entity.**? Respondent further elaborated that “unless there is a specific treaty
providing for a mechanism [of re-domiciling] — such as CIDIP II, which is an
Inter-American Convention [on Conflicts of Laws Concerning Commercial Companies]
which contains a mechanism for re-domiciliation outside of Venezuela — the way in

which any re-domiciliation should occur would be to dissolve an entity and then move
o> 244

The Claimant contended that Venezuelan law authorizes the re-domiciliation of a
Venezuelan company since it does not prohibit it. In support of this contention it refers
to the “full legal capacity” of both individuals and private corporations,” which,
according to it, derives from Article 112 of the Venezuelan Constitution “which
recognizes economic freedom — that is free will - which entails, first freedom to enter
into contracts - and the bylaws of a corporation are a contract —. . .; and furthermore,
freedom to determine the contents of that contract, unless there is a specific and express

provision of a law... enacted by Congress that prohibits certain types of contracts or
certain types of contents.”?*° The Claimant submits that “there is no rule, no such rule
that prohibits change of domicile to another jurisdiction. It does not exist. There is, in
other words, no rule that prohibits the mobility of a company.””47 It may be that
Venezuelan law does not prohibit the re-domiciliation of a Venezuelan company as
Claimant argues. However, the question is not whether Venezuelan law prohibits but
rather whether the Barbadian law requirement that such re-domiciliation is “so
authorized” is satisfied by Venezuela simply not prohibiting such an action.

152. Inthe Tribunal’s view, the word “authorize” in Section 356.1. (1) in its ordinary meaning
is rather equivalent “to give legal or formal warrant to a person or body to do”, “to
empower” or “to permit”*4*, and not simply to a lack of a formal prohibition. Similarly,
in legal English, in which Barbados’ laws are enacted, the word “authorize” has a
meaning of “1. to give legal authority, to empower; 2. to formally approve, to sanction”
and the word “authorization” means “1. official permission to do something, sanction or
warrant; 2. the official document granting such permission.”?“?

153. In the Tribunal’s opinion, the word “authorize” has a similar meaning in the Barbados
Companies Act. It is used in Division D “Corporate Mobility” not only in Section 356.1.
(1) in relation to corporations moving to Barbados, but also in Section 356.4. (1) in
relation to corporations leaving Barbados. Under that latter section, subject to conditions
set out in Section 356.5., “‘a company may (a) if it is authorized by its shareholders in
accordance with this section; . . . apply to the appropriate official or public body of other
jurisdiction and request that the company be continued as a corporation in the other
jurisdiction as if it had been incorporated under the laws of that other jurisdiction.”°°
This section describes the procedure and conditions for authorizing by shareholders of
moving a company out of Barbados and applying to the appropriate official of another
jurisdiction to continue the company in that other jurisdiction. “Authorized” in this
section therefore indicates authority given by the shareholders and would not exist
simply because the shareholders do not prohibit such movement.

154. The Tribunal therefore concludes that the phrase “so authorized” requires an affirmative
empowerment rather than merely a lack of prohibition. This conclusion is also supported
by the limited record before the Tribunal.

155. First, the Tribunal observes that under section 356.6. (1) of Barbados’ Companies Act,
upon receipt of notice that a company has been continued as a corporation under the
laws of another jurisdiction, the Barbados’ Registrar of Companies “must file the notice
and issue a Certificate of Discontinuance.”*°' The legal consequence of the issuance of
such a certificate is that “[a]fter a Certificate of Discontinuance is issued . . . in respect
of a company that is continued as a corporation under the laws of another jurisdiction,
the corporation thereupon becomes an external company for all the purposes of this

[Barbados Companies] Act.”?>? In other words, the primary example of a corporate
mobility regime in Barbados that the Tribunal has before it reveals a clear intent to have
the migration of a company not only recognised by the receiving jurisdiction but also by
the jurisdiction from which the corporation has departed.

Second, the Claimant, and its expert on Barbadian law, Sir Trevor Carmichael, argued
that Barbados company law is influenced by Canada’s company law?® and referred to
the book on Corporate Law in Canada by Bruce Welling.”** While it seems that Division
D on Corporate Mobility in Barbados’ Companies Act (Section 356) is modelled on the
Canada Business Corporation Act (Section 187), it is to be noted that Welling observes
in his treatise that there “are potential difficulties whatever the two jurisdictions
involved.”>> He elaborates:

The first problem involves the capacity of the corporation to change
jurisdictions. In the B.C.C.A.?° example, this capacity was statutorily
bestowed. However, one cannot anticipate that this will be the case in
all jurisdictions. In the event that the jurisdiction of incorporation does
not have such a section’*’, some interpretation of the ‘immigration’
section of the destination jurisdiction is required... the C.B.C.A.
requires that a body corporate seeking to immigrate be ‘so authorized by
the laws of the jurisdiction where it is incorporated.’ It is unclear
whether this requires that the other jurisdiction statutorily permit
emigration, or whether it is sufficient that the concept of emigration is
within the scope of the corporate constitution and is, correspondingly,
not prohibited by the Act.?**

The primary authority relied upon by Claimant thus recognises that there are particular
issues present when the State departed does not explicitly empower re-domiciliation.
Welling concludes his discussion of “corporate emigration and immigration” with the
following cautionary note:

[T]hose who plan or are faced with a proposed continuance would do
well to analyse in detail the types of incorporation statutes in the two
jurisdictions before committing themselves to simplistically designed
and potentially inadequate articles of continuance.”?

The potential confusion as to a corporation’s true status that may follow, unless an
authorization to re-domicile is provided for, supports an interpretation of “so authorized”
that calls for an explicit empowerment.

158. Indeed, such potential confusion exists in the present proceeding. First, the Tribunal
observes that even if it were to accept the Claimant’s view that a Venezuelan company
can re-domicile because Venezuelan law does not prohibit it from changing the
company’s seat to another country, there still would remain the question of the legal
consequences of such a move under the law of Venezuela for the legal status of the
company in that country. Barbados’ laws, including the Companies Act, cannot have an
impact on the legal situation in Venezuela of a company originally incorporated under
the latter’s laws unless Venezuelan law attaches such legal consequences to “corporate
mobility’, to the company’s leaving Venezuela. The Tribunal notes that Claimant is
unable to prove that Transban has ceased to be a company incorporated in Venezuela
under Venezuelan law after it was issued a Certificate of Continuance in August 2001
in Barbados. The Tribunal acknowledges Claimant’s argument that Transban was not
formally discontinued in Venezuela since there is no procedure for such discontinuance
under Venezuelan law and that Claimant could not have produced a Certificate of
Discontinuance because such a certificate does not exist under Venezuelan law.”
Moreover, the Tribunal acknowledges, Claimant’s argument that the Minutes of
Shareholders’ meeting of December 5, 2000, containing a decision to change the
domicile of the company, were recorded by the Commercial Registrar in the Commercial
Registry and the decision of the Registrar has never been challenged by the Government
of Venezuela. The Tribunal on the basis of the evidence before finds that Claimant does
not establish, however, that it no longer exists as a legal entity within Venezuela.

159. The record indicates that the Venezuelan company Inversiones Transbanca, C.A. on
occasion and at least shortly after re-domiciliation continued to act in Venezuela under
that name even after it changed its name to Transban Investment Corp. and received on
August 17, 2001 from the Barbados’ Registrar of Companies the Certificate of
Continuance. At the Extraordinary meeting of Shareholders of Bavarian Motors, C.A.,
held on August 30, 2001, Inversiones Transbanca, C.A., represented by Dr. Maria
Margarita Sosa, participated in the decision to increase the company’s capital and
Inversiones Transbanca, C.A. subscribed fifty percent of the capital increase.7°!

160. Similarly and more recently, in a contract signed in August 2006 between Bavarian
Motors and Banco Fondo Comin, granting a line of credit, Mr. José Luis Velutini
Octavio acted and signed the contract as “the Director of the corporation Inversiones
Transbanca, C.A. (f/k/a Inversiones Cibanca, CA)". The contract indicates that
Inversiones Transbanca, C.A. is “domiciled in the city of St. Michael in the
Constitutional Monarchy of Barbados” as was “recorded beforehand at the Second
Mercantile Registry of the Judicial Jurisdiction of the Capital District and State of
Miranda on December 19, 1996”. The contract further states that the company
“change[d] [its] corporate name to the current name [as] recorded [in] the above-cited
Mercantile Registry on August 20, 1998.” The contract also indicates that the company
changed its “corporate domicile [which] was recorded [in] the above-cited Mercantile
Registry on December 26, 2000... .” and “the company continues to [sic!] August 17,
2001 as an International Trade Corporation under Section 356-2 (1) of the Companies

Law, Volume 308 of the Laws of Barbados, and is currently registered [sic!] in the
registry of Companies”.

The Tribunal therefore concludes on the basis of the evidence and argument presented
to it, that Section 356.1. (1) in providing that a company, a corporate body which is
incorporated in another jurisdiction may apply, if so authorized under the laws of that
other jurisdiction, to the Registrar for a Certificate of Continuance in order to be
continued in Barbados means something more than just a lack of express prohibition of
corporate mobility in the laws of the jurisdiction of the original incorporation of a
company.

There is another matter of concern to the Tribunal. The Claimant presents, as its
investment in Venezuela, the establishment of a company called Bavarian Motors,
C.A.26 However, Bavarian Motors was incorporated in Venezuela on July 13, 2000765,
not by Transban but by Inversiones Transbanca, some 5 months before the shareholders
of that company decided to change the company’s name and to move “the company’s
address to the Island of Barbados”.?® As the Claimant admits, half of the Bavarian
Motors’ initial capital was funded by Inversiones Transbanca and the remaining half by
B.B.O. Servicios Financieros, C.A.67 It cannot thus be disputed that the original
investment was a Venezuelan one, and not a foreign one. Subsequently, in November
2003, after Inversiones Transbanca moved its “company’s address” and changed its
name to Transban Investment Corp., Transban acquired B.B.O.’s share of Bavarian
Motors and thus became the exclusive and sole shareholder in Bavarian Motors.”

The Expert was asked by Counsel for the Claimant “to assess whether Transban is
considered a ‘company’ under the laws of Barbados and within the meaning of
Article 1(d) of the [BIT].7°”

In the view of the Tribunal the key question rather is whether Transban is “a company
incorporated or constituted under the law in force” in Barbados, because only then it
may satisfy the requirements of the definition of companies in Article 1(d) of the BIT.
The Expert’s conclusion is that “Transban is a ‘company’ constituted under the laws of
Barbados, and has been a Barbados company since August 17, 2001 (the ‘Continuance
Date’)”.2”°

The Expert bases his conclusion on the fact that “Transban followed the prescribed legal
requirement for continuance and received a certificate of continuance in Barbados”.*7!

In his view, “[u]nder the laws of Barbados, the legal effect of the issuance of that

certificate of continuance is that Transban is considered as an entity originally
incorporated in Barbados”. 27

The Tribunal notes that the Expert first takes the view that Transban is a company
“constituted under the laws of Barbados” and then in the next paragraph of his report
that “Transban is considered as an entity originally incorporated in Barbados”. It seems
that he does not make a distinction between companies incorporated, and companies
constituted, under the law in force in Barbados, although the text of the BIT
contemplates the two alternatives when it provides that “‘companies’ means, in respect
of each Contracting Party, corporations, firms and associations incorporated or

constituted under the law in force in that Contracting Party”.?7*

The Tribunal further observes that Section 356.2 of the Barbados Companies Act is more
nuanced than what the Expert suggests. It does not provide that “the legal effect of the
issuance of that certificate [i.e., the Certificate of Continuance] is that a company is
considered as an entity originally incorporated in Barbados”?”, as asserted by the
Expert, but rather states that “[o]n the date shown in the Certificate of Continuance the
body corporate becomes a company to which this Act [i.e., the Companies Act] applies
as if the company had been incorporated under this Act”.?’> This language indicates
that the Companies Act distinguishes between the incorporation and the continuation of
companies. Transban is a continued company to which the Barbados’ Companies Act
applies the same way as if it had been incorporated under that Act. But it is clear that
Transban was not incorporated under the Barbados Companies Act because the
“original” incorporation of companies in Barbados is done under Section 4 of Barbados’
Companies Act.

Further, it must be noted that the Barbados’ Companies Act, when defining the term
“company”, distinguishes between incorporation and continuation. It defines a
“company” as “a body corporate that is incorporated or continued under this Act”.?”°
In the view of the Tribunal, a company cannot be under the Barbados’ Companies Act
continued and at the same time incorporated. No evidence to the contrary has been

brought to the Tribunal’s attention.

There is one additional reason why, in the view of the Tribunal, Transban cannot be
viewed as a company incorporated in Barbados, although the Claimant asserted that
“Transban is a company that since August 17, 2001, has been incorporated in
Barbados”.?”7

As mentioned above (see para. 142), the Transban’s Articles of Continuance contain a
restriction on its business: “‘[T]he company shall not engage in any business other than
international business as defined in the International Business Companies Act,
1991-24”.28 This corresponds with the intention of the Shareholders reflected in the

Minutes of their meeting on 5 December 2000, since the company was to be “sheltered
by the laws...of Barbados as a company of international business under the
International Business Companies Act”.?”

171. Section 3 (2) of that Act provides, that “[flor the purposes of this Act, an international

business company shall be deemed to be resident in Barbados where that company is
incorporated or registered under the laws of Barbados.”?*° Clearly, the International
Business Companies Act does make a distinction between companies incorporated under
the laws of Barbados and those which are registered under the laws of Barbados. It is to
be recalled that the division on corporate mobility (Division D) under which Inversiones
Transbanca, C.A. applied for the issuance of the Certificate of Continuance, is contained
in Part III of the Barbados’ Companies Act, entitled “Other Registered Companies”. In
the view of the Tribunal, for the purposes of International Business Companies Act,
Transban is “deemed to be a resident in Barbados” as a company registered under the
laws of Barbados, and not as a company incorporated under the laws of Barbados.

172. In addition to incorporation, the BIT, in its definition of companies in Article 1 (d), uses

also the term “constituted under the law in force in that Contracting Party”. To recall,
the provision reads as follows: “(d) ‘companies’ means, in respect of each Contracting
Party, corporations, firms and associations incorporated or constituted under the law in
force in that Contracting Party”.

173. The Tribunal is of the view that Transban cannot be considered as “constituted under the

law of Barbados” as that term is used in the definition of companies in the BIT. The
ordinary meaning of the term “constitute” is “to establish” or “to form”.”8! This term
has a similar meaning in legal English. It is understood as “to give legal or appropriate

procedural form to (something), to establish by law, to make up or form”.?*?

174. The Barbados’ Companies Act does not use the term “constitute”, “constituted” or

“constitution”. Rather, it uses the term “formation of companies” in the title of its Part I
“Formation and Operation of Companies”. The way to form a company under that Part
is to incorporate it pursuant to Section 4. From the above described history of
Transban?*> it is clear that it was not formed or established in Barbados, it had been in
existence already for more than four years as a Venezuelan company when it decided to
move to Barbados.

175. The Tribunal thus concludes that Transban does not satisfy the conditions set out in

laws of Barbados. If Barbados, as “a responsible international financial centre”?*4,
wished to provide coverage to a whole variety of different sorts of companies governed
by its Companies Act, it could have proposed to and agreed with Venezuela on a
different, broader definition of companies for the purposes of the BIT. It did not do so.

In view of the above, the Tribunal, by majority, upholds the Respondent’s objection
ratione personae and declares that the International Centre for Settlement of Investment
Disputes has no jurisdiction and that the Tribunal has no competence to entertain the

case.?8°

COSTS
On May 10, 2016, the Parties filed their respective Statements of Costs.

Each Party has requested the Tribunal to order that it be reimbursed for the costs of its
legal representation, including the experts’ fees and disbursements.”*° The Claimant
further asked that it be reimbursed for its share of all arbitration costs paid to the ICSID
and for the Respondent be ordered to pay its share.?°’

The Respondent has declined to pay any advance to the ICSID. Claimant made this
payment in lieu of the Respondent.

The Claimant has submitted that it has incurred USD 1,712,511.52 of costs in total. This
amount includes USD 700,766.90 for legal fees, USD 166,744.62 for disbursements
(including travel, subsistence, the expert report, printing, courier fees) and
USD 845,000.00 for advances paid to ICSID (including USD 410,000.00 that the
Claimant was required to advance in view of Venezuela’s refusal to pay any advance),
and the lodging fee.

The Respondent has submitted that it incurred the total costs for the proceedings,
USD2,875,000,00, broken down as follows:

Item Status Amount

Legal fees Disbursed USD 92,000
Legal fees Pending USD 2,601,000
Expert fees Pending USD 75,000
Hearing expenses Disbursed USD 96,000
Other expenses Disbursed USD 11,000
Total USD 2,875,000

Article 61 (2) of the ICSID Convention is applicable to the issue of costs. It provides:

(2) In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as
the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties
in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom.
those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal
and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid.
Such decision shall form part of the award.

Arbitrator Professor David Caron does not share this conclusion. As explained in his Dissenting and

Concurring Opinion appended to the Award as Annex B, he would have rejected the ratione personae
preliminary objection.

As Professor Schreuer observes “[nJeither the Convention, nor the attendant Rules and
Regulations offer substantive criteria for the tribunal’s decision on which party should
bear the costs”.?*° The Tribunal has a rather broad discretionary power over the
allocation of costs incurred in the ICSID arbitration proceedings. Some tribunals applied
the approach that “costs follow the event’, ordering the losing party to bear the costs of
the proceedings, including the reasonable costs of the legal representation of the party
which prevailed. They have occasionally taken into account the conduct of the parties
in the proceedings.

The Tribunal sees no compelling reason not to follow this practice.

Consequently, it decides that the ICSID costs, including the fees and expenses of the
Members of the Tribunal, shall be borne by the Claimant, Transban Investment Corp.
Those costs total USD 738,188.97. The Claimant made all advances for the costs.
Therefore, any balance left will be returned to the Claimant by the ICSID Secretariat.

Regarding the Respondent’s request that it be reimbursed by the Claimant for the costs
of its legal representation, the Tribunal notes that the amount claimed USD 2,875,000.00
is neither fully justified nor reasonable. It is four times higher than the Claimant’s
expenses for its legal representation. Even taking into account the fact that the
Respondent’s costs for legal representation include the costs for the preparation of its
Counter-Memorial on the Merits (79 pages), which was submitted together with its
Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction (57 pages), while the Claimant’s costs of legal
representation cover only the jurisdictional phase, the difference is striking.

There is also a significant difference between the Respondent’s claimed expenses in
these proceedings and its expenses in other ICSID arbitration proceedings: Blue Bank
International & Trust (Barbados) Ltd. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (ICSID
Case No. ARB/12/20). In the Blue Bank proceedings, which involved two rounds of
written briefs and a four-day hearing on Jurisdiction, the Respondent, being represented
by the same Counsel, claimed USD 1,709,295.00 and the Tribunal has ordered the
Claimant to pay the Respondent this amount in full.?*° It is to be recalled that in the
present proceedings each party filed just a single written brief on Jurisdiction and the
hearing was held during two days only. Moreover, the first objection to the jurisdiction
of the Tribunal based on Venezuela’s denunciation of the ICSID Convention, was
identical to the first objection in the Blue Bank proceedings. The same Counsel
represented the Respondent in both proceedings.

Finally, certain expenses of the Respondent were incurred in relation to a challenge of
one arbitrator, which challenge was dismissed by the Chairman of the ICSID
Administrative Council.

Taking all these circumstances into account, the Tribunal — in the exercise of its
discretion — determines that a reasonable amount for the Respondent’s costs of its legal
representation for which it has to be reimbursed by the Claimant, is USD 600,000.00.

The Tribunal considers that a sixty-day period will be appropriate. Neither party
requested that the interest shall be applied to the same award. Therefore, none is
determined by the Tribunal.

DECISION
For the foregoing reasons, the Arbitral Tribunal:

Declares, by majority, that the Centre has no jurisdiction and the Tribunal lacks
competence to adjudicate the present dispute;

Decides that the Claimant shall bear in full the ICSID costs of the proceedings (fees and
expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the administrative fees of the Centre);

Orders the Claimant to pay the Respondent, within sixty days from the date of this
Award, USD 600,000.00 (six hundred thousand United States Dollars) as the
reimbursement of the Respondent’s reasonable costs and expenses incurred in
connection with these proceedings.

ANNEX A

Separate Opinion of Arbitrator Santiago Torres Bernardez concerning the ratione
temporis preliminary objection of the Respondent

1. In its paragraph 93 the Award dismisses the Venezuela’s ratione temporis preliminary
objection, while my own conclusion is that the objection should have been upheld by the
Tribunal. The present opinion explains why, to my regret, I am unable to join my
colleagues in the dismissal of such objection. Thus, this opinion is essentially focused on
what seems to be the core of disagreement among us, beginning with the question of
determination of the critical date to be taken into account in the interpretation and
application of the saving clause of Article 72 of the ICSID Convention.

2. The Award finds that the critical date is 24 July 2012. This conclusion is reached by
extrapolating the six-month period of Article 71 of the ICSID Convention with respect to
the denunciation of the Convention into the interpretation of the provision set forth in
Article 72 of the Convention as pleaded by Transban, while for me the relevant critical
date is 24 January 2012, namely the date in which the World Bank, depositary of the
ICSID Convention, received Venezuela’s Notice of Denunciation, namely as provided
for in Article 72.

3. My conclusion is based on the very text of Article 72, as well as on its context and the
object and purpose of the provision enounced in that Article within the general economy
of the ICSID Convention; a conclusion confirmed by the travaux relating to both Article
72 and Article 71. In my opinion, the issue that divides Parties, as set out in the Award,
of whether or not Transban filed with ICSID its Request for Arbitration either on 24 or
on 25 July 2012 is quite irrelevant for the determination to be made by the Arbitral
Tribunal, without prejudice of recalling in that respect that the official communication of
the Centre to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela concerning the institution of the Case
states that it was on 25 July 2012 when the Centre received the Request for Arbitration
on behalf of Transban.

4. There is, in my opinion, no legal justification to introduce the “six-month period” of
Article 71 into the crucible of the interpretative operation of Article 72, as the Award
does. Any such period is alien to the object and purpose of Article 72. The wording of
Articles 71 and Article 72 of the ICSID Convention differ from each other for a good
cause, namely because each of these provisions is called to serve a different function
within the legal system established by the ICSID Convention. The scope of the temporal
criteria in the text adopted for Article 71 and for Article 72 of the ICSID Convention
respectively by the States reflects undoubtedly their clear intent to define the temporal
scope of each of the provisions set forth in those Articles differently, in view of the
different function each of these two final provisions of the Convention are called to serve.

5. Given the clearness of the text of Article 72 itself and that the text - as explained by the
International Law Commission in its commentary to article 27 of its Draft Articles on the
Law of Treaties — is presumed by the interpreter to be the authentic expression of the
intentions of the parties in the treaty, this arbitrator does not see the need to alter that
presumption in the course of any given particular application of Article 72. The
conventional rule set out in Article 72 should be applied in accordance with the meaning
of the terms thereof resulting from the application of the rules of international law on
interpretation of treaties codified in Articles 31, 32 and 33 of the VCLT which, as

indicated above, are based upon the primacy of the text in the interpretation, without
prejudice of course of having recourse to the relevant extrinsic interpretative elements
forming part of such codified rules.

6. From its very Preamble, the multilateral ICSID Convention distinguishes, on the one
hand, “consent to participate in the ICSID Convention” as a Centre for the settlement of
investment disputes through the conciliation or arbitration procedures defined therein and,
on the other hand, “consent of the parties to an investment dispute” to submit it for
settlement to one or another of these proceedings of the Centre. Article 71 is concerned
with the effects on the consent to participate in the ICSID Convention of a Contracting
State’s notice of denunciation of the Convention, while Article 72 relates to the effects of
any such notice on the eventual existing rights and obligations under the Convention
arising from the parties to a given investment dispute consent to the jurisdiction of the
Centre, namely in the relations between the denouncing Contracting State and a protected
private investor national of another Contracting State of the ICSID Convention.

7. In other words, Article 72 does not regulate the effects of the notice of denunciation by
a Contracting State of the multilateral ICSID Convention on its conventional relations
with other Contracting States to such Convention as Article 71 does. What Article 72
regulates are the effects of that kind of notice with respect to the “binding agreements”
between the denouncing Contracting State and a foreign private party or parties to submit
a given investment dispute to the Centre for conciliation or arbitration as referred to in
paragraph 6 of the Preamble of the ICSID Convention, namely of those “binding
conciliation and/or arbitral agreements” which may be in existence before receipt by the
depositary of the Convention of the notice of denunciation thereof by the Contracting
State concerned.

8. The need of regulating the effects of the Contracting States’ notices of denunciation of
the ICSID Convention with respect to any such “binding conciliation and/or arbitral
agreements” is easy to understand if one bears in mind that such agreements are external
to the ICSID Convention itself because, as declared in paragraph 7 of its Preamble: “...
no Contracting State shall by the mere fact of its ratification, acceptance or approval of
this Convention and without its consent be deemed to be under any obligation to submit
any particular dispute to conciliation or arbitration.”

*

9. The present Award begins by making the distinction between the ICSID Convention
and such “binding agreements” between the parties to an investment dispute. But,
thereafter, the distinction became blurred in the reasoning of the Award as a consequence
of the extrapolation of the temporal element of Article 71 (the six-month period) to Article
72, ignoring the fact that the latter has a temporal element of its own which is alien to the
six-month period of Article 71. The first victim of that approach is the effect utile of the
temporal element of Article 72, namely the terms “... consent given ... before such notice
was received by the depositary”.

10. In my opinion, the extrapolation the Award makes detracts from the intended
meaning and purpose of the saving clause of Article 72 which results from the ordinary
meaning of its terms in their context and in the light of the object and purpose of the
ICSID Convention and which is confirmed by the published travaux of the ICSID
Convention as well as by the most respected doctrinal commentaries (Schreuer, Fouret,
Castro de Figueidero, etc.).

11. Different constructions based, for example, on the reference made in Article 72 to
consent “given by one of them” do not support the doctrinal argument of a few to the
effect that the unilateral “general standing offers” of ICSID arbitration made by host
States (for example, in an Agreement for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of
Investments (BIT) (APPRI for its Spanish acronym) or in any other form) but which had
not been accepted by the investor prior to the critical date established in Article 72 would
remain unaffected by the notice of denunciation of the ICSID Convention. These doctrinal
argument is based on the misreading that the words “given by one of them” refer to the
legal relationship between the host State and the investor when the precedents thereof in
the text are the denouncing State, its constituent subdivisions or agencies or its nationals.
Tam pleased to underscore that the present Award casts also aside the doctrinal argument
based on the terms “given by one of them”, coinciding on that point with my own position
thereon. But, the Award through a reasoning different from mine, reaches a conclusion
similar mutatis mutandis to the conclusion of the supporters of the “given by one of them”
argument on the meaning and scope of the saving clause of Article 72 of the ICSID
Convention.

12. Concerning the legal consequences of the termination of a treaty - of which
denunciation is indeed one of its forms - the Award in its paragraph 75 quotes some
provisions of Article 70 (Consequences of the termination of a treaty) of the Vienna
Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) and considers that the provisions of that
Article codify customary international law in that matter. I think so concerning this last
proposition, but I disagree with the role attributed by the Award to that provision of the
Vienna Convention in the interpretation of Article 72 of the ICSID Convention.

13. First, it should be recalled that Article 70 of the VCLT enounces a residual rule (unless
the treaty otherwise provides or the parties otherwise agree) as admitted by the Award
itself and Article 72 of the ICSID Convention does indeed provide otherwise. For
example, the scope of the saving clause articulated by Article 72 only applies to “rights
or obligations under the Convention” in existence before the critical date defined in that
Article, while the customary rules codified in Article 70 of the VCLT also protect “legal
situations”. These “legal situations” are not listed in the saving clause of Article 72 of the
ICSID Convention. However, the Award in its paragraph 78 concludes otherwise, namely
that: “The purpose of Article 72 is thus to preserve rights, obligations or legal situations
which have arisen prior to the receipt of notices under Article 70 or Article 71 of the
(ICSID) Convention”

14. In support of the conclusion quoted above which adds “legal situations” to the text of
the saving clause of Article 72 of the ICSID Convention, the Award would seem to invoke
the textual fact that the clause applies to notices made pursuant to both Articles 70 (notices

concerning exclusions from territorial application) and Article 71 (notices concerning
denunciations) of the ICSID Convention. But, I fail to see how the fact that the saving
clause of Article 72 applies to those two kinds of notices implies that the clause also
preserves mere “legal situations”. In other words, I do not see the relation between the
premise and the conclusion of the Award on this issue because it is quite clear that the
saving clause of Article 72 preserves only “rights or obligations” under the ICSID
Convention “arising out of consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre” by the parties to an
investment dispute.

15. That said, for such “rights and obligations” to be in existence at a given time, the other
a party to an investment dispute - namely the private foreign investor - must have also
given his own consent to submit the dispute to ICSID arbitration or conciliation (Article
25 (1) of the ICSID Convention). Otherwise, as explained in the Preamble of the
Convention, there is not a “binding agreement” between the parties to the dispute to
submit it to ICSID arbitration or conciliation. It follows necessarily that for the “rights or
obligations” mentioned in Article 72 of the ICSID Convention to come into existence, it
is necessary, as also articulated in the Preamble, the “mutual consent” of the parties to the
dispute. The unilateral consent of one of the parties to the dispute is not a source of
jurisdictional rights or obligations under the ICSID Convention.

16. The exclusion of “legal situations” from Article 72 of the ICSID Convention is in my
opinion a textual fact explained by the particular kind of “rights or obligations” dealt with
in such Article which relate, essentially, to the arbitral and conciliation ICSID procedures
available to the parties to an investment dispute when these have concluded, by means
external to the ICSID Convention, a binding agreement or undertaking to arbitrate or to
conciliate the dispute in the Centre. And these international procedures for settlement of
disputes, by their very nature, require the “mutual consent” of the parties to the dispute
just as in customary international law, mutual consent that paragraph 23 of the Report of
the Executive Directors qualifies as the cornerstone of the jurisdiction of the Centre.

17. It shall be also recalled that in the ICSID system the application of the Law of Treaties
shall be conducted with discernment. There is no problem whatsoever with matters
relating to Article 71 because only States are or may become Contracting States to the
ICSID Convention. But when the reasoning is made in connection with the “arbitral
agreements or undertakings” between the parties to an investment dispute to submit it to
the Centre caution is advisable. Why? Because under the ICSID Convention, such
“arbitral agreements or undertakings” are not “treaties”, since one of the parties, the
investor, lacks jus standing to conclude treaties. There are however other general
principles and rules of international law applicable to those agreements or undertakings,
such as pacta sunt servanda, the mutual consent of the parties to the dispute as the basis
of international arbitration, the requirement of the State’s consent to submit its disputes
with third parties to international courts and tribunals, the principle of res judicata, etc.

18. Lastly, the above described meaning in Article 72 of the ICSID Convention of the
expression that notices concerning territorial applications (Article 70) or denunciations
(Article 71) of the Convention “... shall not affect the rights or obligations ...arising out
of consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre” is not only supported as context by the
aforementioned paragraph 6 of the Preamble and Article 25 (1) of the Convention but also
by other Articles of the Convention. For instance, a similar expression is used in the first

lines of Article 66 (2) of Chapter IX (Amendment) of the ICSID Convention where it is
obvious that the expression cannot encompass “legal situations”.

*

19. Some of the rules codified by Article 70 of the VCLT are in line with the provisions
articulated in articles 71 and 72 of the ICSID Convention. Article 71 reflects the rule
codified in Article 70, paragraph 1(a), of the VCLT to the effect that denunciation releases
the parties from any obligation to maintain compliance with the treaty. In the case of the
ICSID Convention the denunciation takes effect, as stated in Article 71, six months after
receipt by the World Bank of the notice of the denouncing Contracting State. This means
that, in the instant case, Venezuela was released from further complying with its
conventional obligations in its relations with other Contracting States of the ICSID
Convention six months after 24 January 2012, i.e., on 25 July 2012, but this is of course
without prejudice of the saving clause enounced in Article 72 for rights or obligations
under the ICSID Convention arising out of consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre by the
parties to a dispute.

20. The provision of Article 72 corresponds in turn to Article 70, paragraph 1 (b), of the
VCLT according to which the termination of a treaty, by denunciation or otherwise, does
not affect any right, obligation or legal situation of the parties created through the
execution of the treaty prior to its termination. But it is not identical. As already indicated,
Article 72 of the ICSID Convention does not mention “legal situations”. Furthermore -
and this is at the core of my disagreement with the conclusion of the Award — in Article
72 of the ICSID Convention the temporal scope of the saving clause enounced therein
does not go on until the date of effective termination of the denouncing Contracting
State’s participation in the Convention in its relations with other Contracting States, but
as explicitly stated in the Article 72 until receipt of the notice of denunciation by the
depositary of the Convention. In this case, until the notice of denunciation of the
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela was received by the World Bank on 24 January 2012.

21. It follows that, contrary to the conclusion of theAward , the six-month period of
Article 71 of the ICSID Convention — i.e., the period between 24 January 2012 and 24
July 2012 - is not covered by the saving clause of Article 72 the text of which only
preserves from the effects of a notice of denunciation the “rights or obligation under the
ICSID Convention ... arising out of consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre” existing
before the critical date of 24 January 2012, which is the date on which the World Bank
received the notice of denunciation of Venezuela. Continuity of the “binding agreements”
mutually consented between the parties to an investment dispute to submit any such
dispute to ICSID arbitration or conciliation preserved by the saving clause of Article 72
is, exclusively, that of those binding agreements executed before such critical date. In the
instant case, the aforementioned saving clause does not operate at all beyond the 24
January 2012.

22. It should also be recalled that in the ILC commentary on the object of Article 70 of
the VCLT (Article 66 of the ILC Draft Articles), the Commission made the caveat that
the rule in paragraph | (b) of Article 70 of the VCLT relates only to the rights, obligations,
or legal situations of the States parties to the treaties created through the execution thereof
and it is not concerned with the eventual “vested interests” of individuals. Nevertheless,

this caveat as such has no incidence whatsoever in the present case because Transban, as
indicated below, has not pleaded any vested interest, right or legal situation of its own
prior to 24 January 2012. Transban has argued all along that its consent to the present
arbitration was given on 24 July 2012 when the ICSID received a scanned copy of its
Request for Arbitration annexed to an email from Counsel for Claimant.

*

23. The objective legal question to be answered by the Arbitral Tribunal for the purpose

of upholding or dismissing the Venezuela’ ratione temporis preliminary objection is, in
my opinion, the following: Before the receipt by the World Bank of Venezuela’s Notice
of Denunciation on 24 January 2012 were there in the relations between the Bolivarian
Republic of Venezuela and Transban as parties to the present investment dispute rights o
obligations under the ICSID Convention arising out of a consensual obligation binding
both of them to submit the dispute to ICSID arbitration, thereby empowering the ICSID
and the present Arbitral Tribunal with the jurisdiction and competence respectively
necessary to settle the dispute?

24. In the light of the circumstances of the instant case, the answer to that question cannot
be but negative. At no stage has Transban pleaded to have given any kind of consent to
arbitrate the present investment dispute within the ICSID before the receipt by the World
Bank of Venezuela’s Notice of Denunciation of the ICSID Convention on 24 January
2012. The plea of Transban has been that it had accepted the unconditional consent to
international arbitration offer granted by Venezuela under the form of a standing “general
arbitration offer” (in paragraph 4 of article 8 of the 1994 Barbados/Venezuela BIT) on 24
July 2012, namely, on a date following (not preceding) the receipt by the World Bank of
Venezuela’s Notice of Denunciation on 24 January 2012. Transban is wrong with respect
to the effects under the ICSID Convention of its late acceptance of Venezuela’s arbitration
offer. But, Transban has correctly understood the mechanism according to which
Venezuela’s offer in the applicable BIT shall be accepted by the investor in order to
establish the mutual consent of the parties to the investment dispute to submit it to ICSID
arbitration as provided for in the Preamble and Article 25 (1) of the ICSID Convention.
Likewise, Transban admits the principle that a notice of denunciation filed pursuant to
Article 72 of the Convention has, as from a given point in time, preclusive effects with
respect to the possibility for the investor to invoke arbitral rights or obligations under the
ICSID Convention, but it is wrong in the identification of the temporal scope of the saving
clause of Article 72.

25. It follows from the above that propositions that standing “general arbitration offers”
in BITs remain unaffected by a Contracting State’s notice of denunciation are erroneous
as regards establishing the jurisdiction of the ICSID. Under Article 72 of the ICSID
Convention private foreign investors’ eventual acceptance of those offers after the receipt
of the notice by the depositary of the Convention are without effect with respect to
establishing the jurisdiction of the Centre and, therefore, the competence of an ICSID
arbitral tribunal.

26. In the system established by the ICSID Convention the standing “general arbitration
offers” by themselves and without further ado - namely without the acceptance of the
offer by the private foreign investor concerned — do not amount to a host State’s binding

consent to submit the investment dispute in question to ICSID arbitration. The contrary
proposition cannot prevail. Why? Because it would not only ignore the text and context
of Article 72 of the ICSID Convention, but also the legal principle under the Convention
and customary international law that to be binding “arbitration agreements” require the
consent of both parties to the dispute at issue as well as the condition that “arbitration
agreements” are not entered into erga omnes but with regard to a particular person or
persons. Arbitration offers are not arbitration agreements

27. The “jurisdictional obligations” derived from those binding arbitration agreements
between the parties to the dispute, often bilateral, take place with regard to, and as
between two different persons, the one that undertakes an obligation with the other and
the one that has undertaken an obligation with the former as pointed out by the ICSID ad
hoc Committee in CMS v. Argentina (Annulment) with respect to that kind of obligations
in the context of application of the so-called umbrella clauses This implies, in my opinion,
a major legal obstacle standing between Transban’s plea and Venezuela’s general
arbitration offer. In any event, within the ICSID system an “offering State” cannot be
equated with a “bound State”.

28. As already explained, the rights or obligations under the ICSID Convention arising
out of the consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre mentioned in Article 72 do not come
into being without the consent of both parties to the dispute, namely without a duly
established mutual consent of those parties. Thus, a unilateral offer by any one of the
parties is not a source of the aforementioned rights or obligations. The Preamble and
Article 25 (1) of the Convention are crystal clear in that respect, as well as general
international law. It is only when both parties to the investment dispute have given their
respective consents to the ICSID arbitration that no party may withdraw it unilaterally. In
this case, however, Claimant’s consent to arbitrate the present investment dispute was not
given by Transban until 24 or 25 July 2012, i.e., too late to perfect the requirement of the
mutual consent of the parties, because as of 24 January 2012, the doors to ICSID
arbitration were closed for Claimant pursuant to Article 72 of the ICSID Convention.

29. The object and purpose of the rule in Article 72 of the ICSID Convention - as clearly
expressed in its text - is indeed to operate as a saving clause in order to preserve the access
to the ICSID arbitral or conciliation procedures and facilities in face of a given notice of
denunciation of the Convention by a given Contacting State, but providing that both the
Contracting State hosting the investment and the protected investor of another
Contracting State have consented - prior to receipt of the notice by the depositary - to
submit an actual or future investment dispute for settlement to ICSID arbitration or
conciliation, as the case may be.

30. The saving clause enounced by Article 72 therefore preserves pending arbitral ICSID
proceedings as well as “ICSID arbitration agreements” duly executed between the parties
with respect to an actual or future investment dispute or disputes from the preclusive
effects entailed by the exercise by the host Contracting State (or by the Contracting State
of the investor’s nationality) of the unconditional right of denunciation of the ICSID
Convention granted to all Contracting States in its Article 71. However, the scope of the
saving clause of Article 72 is not, as already indicated, all embracing. The Article limits

the non-retroactive effects of a notice of denunciation exclusively to those ICSID
proceedings and ICSID arbitration agreements in existence before the date on which the
depositary received the notice.

31. The temporal delimitation of the saving clause made by Article 72 of the ICSID
Convention actually narrows the temporal scope of the corresponding customary
international law rule codified by the VCLT which extends the non-retroactive effect of
a notice of denunciation until the very date on which the denunciation of the treaty takes
effect (Article 70 (2) of the VCLT). Therefore, there is here a further discrepancy between
the provision in Article 72 of the ICSID Convention and the customary rule codified in
Article 70 of the VCLT, discrepancy that for me is determinative for the conclusion of
the absence of “jurisdiction of the Centre” in the present case. As from the very date of
its institution, the present case falls outside the temporal scope of the saving clause of
Article 72. This factual circumstance prevents the Centre’s procedures and facilities for
arbitration or conciliation of investment disputes from being deemed available for
Transban when it filed its Request for Arbitration on 24 or 25 July 2012 (see Report of
the Executive Directors, paragraph 22).

32. On the other hand, Article 72 of the ICSID Convention preserves without temporal
limitations whatsoever all ongoing arbitral proceedings and agreements between the
parties to the dispute providing for the jurisdiction of the ICSID in existence between them
before the critical date of receipt of the notice of denunciation of the Convention by the
depositary. Hence, the fact that Venezuela’s “general arbitration offer” in the applicable
BIT has been accepted by Transban after the aforementioned critical date is what prevents
the resulting undertaking from constituting an arbitral agreement susceptible to opening
Transban’s access to ICSID arbitral or conciliation procedures and facilities.

33. Obviously, the BIT formulating the aforementioned “general arbitration offer” of
Venezuela cannot modify the multilateral ICSID Convention which has its own
amendment procedures (Articles 65 and 66 of the Convention), as it is equally truth that
the ICSID Convention cannot modify a jota the bilateral Barbados/Venezuela BIT. Both
the ICSID Convention and the applicable BIT are self-contained treaties and the final
provisions of each of them must be interpreted and applied in good faith in accordance
with the Law of Treaties. To do otherwise would result in misleading interpretations and
applications of both the Convention and the BIT.

34. It follows that the fact that the Barbados/Venezuela BIT contains a standing “general
arbitration offer” to private investors of Barbados is as such an element alien to the
process of interpretation or application of Article 72 of the ICSID Convention. On the
other hand, the fact that for the reasons developed in this Opinion the “jurisdiction of the
Centre” does not exist in the instant case because of the temporal restriction of the saving
clause of Article 72 and that, therefore, the present ICSID Arbitral Tribunal has no
competence to adjudicate this ICSID case is a conclusion which I have reached evidently
without prejudice of the eventual legal effects that the acceptance by Transban on 24 or
25 July 2012 of Venezuela’s general arbitration offer of the BIT may have with respect
to non-ICSID arbitral mechanisms. As stated by the Institute of International Law in
Article 3 of its Resolution on “Legal Aspects of Recourse to Arbitration by an Investor
against the Authorities of the Host State under Inter-States Treaties”:

“The requirements and characteristics of investment arbitral mechanisms chosen by
the parties shall be respected and their effects recognized. This applies, inter alia, to the
existence of the parties’ consent (host States and investors) and the existence of an
investment in conformity with the applicable international instruments, taking
particularly into account the features of both ICSID and non-ICSID different arbitration
mechanisms (Annuaire de |’ Institut de Droit International, Session of Tokyo (2013), Vol.
75, at pages 425 (French) and 429/430 (English)).

*

35. In the circumstances of the present ICSID case, for the Arbitral Tribunal to adjudicate
Venezuela’s ratione temporis preliminary objection the first step to be taken is, in my
opinion, to determine the meaning and scope of the saving clause set forth in Article 72
of the ICSID Convention through the application of the rules on the interpretation of
treaties codified in Articles 31 to 33 of the VCLT. Only when that step is taken, shall it
be possible to ascertain whether the legal fact of the acceptance by Transban on 24 or 25
July 2012 of Venezuela’s general arbitration offer in Article 8 (4) of the Barbados/
Venezuela BIT has established or not from that date on a binding arbitral agreement
between the Parties to the present investment dispute and if any such agreement falls
within the scope of the saving clause of Article 72 of the ICSID Convention.

36.To accomplish the first step suggested above, the application of the “General rule of
interpretation” of Article 31 of the VCLT suffices to ascertain with no difficulties
whatsoever the meaning and scope of the saving clause of Article 72 of the ICSID
Convention. Not having been established that Contracting Sates of the ICSID Convention
have given a “special meaning” to some of the terms of Article 72, the object of the
interpretative process of the Article is to determine in good faith the “ordinary meaning”
of the its terms in their context and in the light of the object and purpose of the ICSID
Convention as enounced in its Preamble. In so doing, the interpreter must bear in mind
that for the purpose of interpretation, the “context” comprises, following Article 31 of the
VCLT, in addition to the text of Article 72 itself, the ICSID Convention as a whole, and
particularly the two last paragraphs of the Preamble, Articles 25 and 26 on the jurisdiction
of the Centre, Article 66 (2) on amendment of the Convention, Articles 70, 71 and 75 (d)
of the Final Provisions and the instrument entitled “Report of the Executive Directors” to
which the text of the ICSID Convention was attached.

37. As regards the three interpretative elements, extrinsic to both the “text” and the
“context”, that according to paragraph 3 of Article 31 of the VCLT the interpreter shall
also take into account together with the context, only paragraph (c) could be eventually
relevant in the circumstances of the instant case, namely, “any relevant rules of
international law applicable in the relations between the parties” to the ICSID Convention
(the “Contracting States” in the terminology of the Convention). The taking into account
of this element of the “General rule of interpretation” in the interpretative process of
Article 72 of the ICSID Convention may pose in turn questions of “intertemporal law”
the resolution of which is controlled within the “General rule” by the principle of
interpretation in good faith (see paragraph (16) of the ILC’s commentary to article 27 of
its Draft Articles on the Law of Treaties).

38. However, these “intertemporal” questions of international law do not arise in the
present case because, as it is generally admitted, its relevance in the interpretation process
of a given treaty is dependent on the intentions of the parties to the treaty concerned and
there is not any evidence indicating that the Contracting States of the ICSID Convention
have intended to give an evolutionary meaning to any one of terms used on Article 72
either at the time of adoption of the Convention in 1965 or thereafter. Moreover, the
consensual basic principle governing international arbitration has neither evolved nor
been modified since 1965. It follows that interpretation of the terms of Article 72 must
for this arbitrator be appreciated in the light of the law contemporary to the adoption of
the ICSID Convention.

39. Having applied the provisions in Article 31 of the VCLT bearing in mind that the
general rule of interpretation of treaties articulated therein forms “a single, closely
integrated rule” as was explained by the ILC (paragraph 8) of its Introduction to the
Commentary to Articles 27 and 28 of its Draft Articles on the Law of Treaties), I have
reached the following three main broad conclusions concerning the rule set forth in
Article 72 of the ICSID Convention:

(a) As stated by the opening words of Article 72, a notice of denunciation filed pursuant
to Article71 shall not affect rights or obligations under the ICSID Convention arising out
of consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre which may exist between the parties to a given
actual or future investment dispute (between a host State and a protected private investor)
and, consequently, any such rights or obligations are not altered or modified as per the
saving clause when the notice of denunciation takes effect in the relations between the
Contracting States to the ICSID Convention (functional autonomy of the saving clause);

(b) The rights or obligations under the ICSID Convention preserved by the saving clause
are those arising out of consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre given by both parties to
the investment dispute concerned because it is only by their mutual consent that the
ensuing “binding agreement” may create rights or obligation for those parties, under the
ICSID Convention, that open their access to the conciliation and arbitral proceedings set
forth by the Convention (scope ratione materiae of the saving clause);

(c) The rights or obligations under the ICSID Convention referred to hereinabove are
fully preserved by the saving clause, but only when the mutual consent of the parties to
the investment dispute accepting the jurisdiction of the Centre has been given before
receipt of the notice of denunciation of the Contracting State by the depositary of the
Convention and , consequently, Article 72 leaves outside the jurisdiction of the Centre
conciliation or arbitration agreements between the parties to the dispute perfected or
executed between them during the period running from the date of the receipt of the notice
by the depositary and the date on which the denunciation takes effect in the relations
between Contracting States (scope ratione temporis of the saving clause)

40. It is on the basis of the above conclusions that I uphold the Respondent’s ratione
temporis preliminary objection because Transban’s acceptance on 24 or 25 July 2012 of

Venezuela’s general arbitration offer contained in Article 8(4) of the Barbados/Venezuela
BIT does not fall within the temporal scope of application of the saving clause of Article
72 and, consequently, that acceptance is as such unable to establish a binding
jurisdictional bond as regards settlement of the present investment dispute by recourse to
ICSID arbitration. This conclusion is furthermore fully confirmed by the travaux
préparatoires of Article 72 of the ICSID Convention.

Al. In fact, during the elaboration of the ICSID Convention it became crystal clear that
rights and obligations arising out from existing consents to ICSID arbitration between the
parties to an investment dispute should be preserved as per the saving clause of Article
72, but not beyond or otherwise. In the three drafts (preliminary, first, and revised drafts)
of this present Article 72, the saving clause only preserved the undertakings or consents
to the jurisdiction of the Centre “given prior to the notice of denunciation” or “prior to
the date of any such notice”. The statements made by Broches during the consideration
of Article 72 (then Article 73) cannot be clearer, and they correlate point by point with
meaning and scope of Article 72 which results from my interpretation of the saving clause
made pursuant to Article 31 of the VCLT.

42. After beginning by explaining that Article 72 (then Article 73) was intended to be
about the effects of notices of denunciation of the Convention (Article 71) or the exclusion
of a territory from the scope of application of the Convention (article 70) with respect to
already given consents to conciliation or arbitration under the Convention (emphasis
added), Broches stated inter alia, the following:

“’,. the intention of Article 73 (72) in the text submitted to the Directors, was to make
it clear that if a State had consented to arbitration, for instance by entering into an
arbitration clause with an investor, the subsequent denunciation of the Convention by that
State would not relieve it from its obligation to go to arbitration if a dispute arose”
(Documents Concerning the Origin and the formulation of the Convention, Volume II,
Part 2, page 1009);

. if the agreement with the company included an arbitration clause and that
agreement lasted for say 20 years, that State would still be bound to submit its disputes
with that company under that agreement to the Centre” (Ibid., p. 1010);

“(Mr. Gutierrez Cano raised the question of cases where there was not an agreement
between the State and the investor but only a general declaration on the part of the State
in favour of the submission of claims to the Centre and a subsequent withdrawal from the
Convention by that State before any such claim had been in fact submitted to the Centre.
In that hypothesis, would the Convention still compel the State to accept the jurisdiction
of the Centre?) Broches’ response to the question:

“".. a general statement of the kind mentioned by Mr, Gutierrez Cano would not be
binding on the State that had made it until it had been accepted by the investor. If the
State withdraws its unilateral statement through the denunciation of the Convention
before it has been accepted by any investor, no investor could later bring a claim before
the Centre. If, however, the unilateral offer of the State has been accepted before the

denunciation of the Convention, then disputes arising between the State and the investor
after the date of denunciation will still be within the jurisdiction of the Centre” (Ibid. )

“... the provision under discussion had not been questioned at any of the regional
meetings or in the Legal Committee. It was a basic essential provision. The Convention
establishes the principle that agreements to arbitration cannot be broken by one of the
parties. The provision under discussion only drew the necessary conclusions in the event
of denunciation of the Convention: the denouncing State could not incur in any new
obligations, but existing obligations would remain in force” (Ibid., p. 1011).

(After this last statement by Broches the consensus was for Article 72 of the Convention
to remain unchanged)

43. It follows from the above that the outcome of an interpretation of Article 72 of the
ICSID Convention in accordance with Article 31 of the VCLT and the travaux
préparatoires of the Convention are essentially in harmony, the latter confirming the
meaning and scope of the aforementioned result. This means undoubtedly that in the
present case for the Respondent to be considered a State which has “given its consent” to
submit the present investment dispute to ICSID arbitration, the “general arbitration offer”
made by Venezuela in the BIT should have been duly accepted by Transban before
Venezuela’s notice of denunciation was received by the depositary. However, Claimant’s
consent was granted too late for an ICSID arbitration because by 24 or 25 July 2012 the
saving clause of Article 72 of the Convention had not been operative for a long time,
namely since 24 January 2012 on.

44. In his remarkable commentary on Article 72 of the ICSID Convention, Schreuer,
following Broches, describes with further precision the effects of denunciation of the
ICSID Convention on standing general offers that host States articulate in their legislation
or a treaty as follows:

“Consent to jurisdiction is perfected only after its acceptance by both parties. A
unilateral offer of consent by the host State through legislation or a treaty before a notice
under ... Art. 71 would not suffice for purposes of Art. 72. An investor’s attempt to accept
a standing offer of consent by the host State that may exist under legislation or a treaty
after the receipt of the notice of denunciation under ... Art. 71 would not succeed. In order
to be preserved by Art. 72 consent would have to be perfected prior to the receipt of the
notice of ... denunciation. In order to benefit from the continued validity under Art. 72
consent must have been given before the denunciation of the Convention... Under the
explicit wording of Art. 72 the relevant date is the date of receipt of the notice by the
depositary. Therefore, the provision in Art.71 that the denunciation of the Convention by
a State party takes effect only six months after notice has been given does not afford an
opportunity to perfect consent during this period” (Schreuer, The ICSID Convention. A
Commentary, Second Edition, 6" printing 2014), pp. 1280/1281) (italics supplied).

*
45. I share the Schreuer’s conclusions. They generally correlate with my own findings on

the meaning and scope of the saving clause of Article 72 of the ICSID Convention
construed pursuant to the codified rules on interpretation of treaties of the VCLT. It

should also be recalled that during elaboration of the Convention attempts to further limit
the scope of the saving clause of Article 72 were defeated and that no amendments were
made at any moment to make the operation of the saving clause subject to, or conditioning
it in any respect by the six-month period of Article 71 which, as already stated, concerns
the different question of the effects of notices of denunciations (or of territorial
applications) in the relations between Contracting States to the ICSID Convention (not in
the relations between a host Contacting States and a protected private investor).

46. It would seem that the Award tries to sustain in some way the extrapolation of the six-
month period of Article 71 of the ICSID Convention into its reading of Article 72 on the
fact that during that period the Convention was still in effect for the denouncing
Contracting State, in the instant case for the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. If so, the
argument is not substantiated because, first, the critical date for the application of Article
72 is 24 January 2012 and, second, the ICSID Convention does not establish terminal
limits to the continuation of the rights or obligations under the Convention preserved from
the effects of the denunciation by the saving clause of its Article 72.

47. Consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre remains in effect or is preserved by the saving
clause when it has been given by both parties to the investment dispute before the notice
of denunciation is received by the depositary. And this is quite independent from the fact
that the ICSID Convention continues to be in force in the relations between the
Contracting States until the expiration date of the six-month period of article 71. In
addition, mutual consents to the jurisdiction of the Centre actually preserved by the saving
clause of Article 72 of course remain operative beyond the expiration date of any such
six-month period. Undoubtedly, Transban admits this conclusion because, according to
its own plea, it filed its Request for Arbitration on 24 July 2012 knowing full well that
the ICSID Convention would no longer take effect in the relations between the Bolivarian
Republic of Venezuela and Barbados as Contracting States the following day, namely on
25 July 2012. It just so happens that in the present case the whole unfolding of the
proceedings takes place after Venezuela is no longer a Contracting State. Transban has
not challenged either the unitary character of the regime established by Article 72,
namely, that any such regime applies to all forms or mechanisms whereby consent to the
jurisdiction of the Centre of the parties to the dispute is perfected (contract, legislation,
BIT or any other written form). Nevertheless, Transban denies the effect utile of Article
72 of the ICSID Convention.

48. Finally, a further consideration which explains why, to my regret, I cannot support
the Award is precisely that its conclusion, following Transban, also denies the effect utile
of Article 72 of the ICSID Convention, principle qualified by the ICJ as one of the
“fundamental principles of interpretation of treaties, consistently upheld by international
jurisprudence” (Territorial Dispute (Libya/Chad), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1994, p. 25,
paragraph 51). In fact, the Award deprives the saving clause of Article 72 of the meaning
or effect that was to be attributed within the system established by the ICSID Convention
and without a satisfactory accompanying explanation, because in the instant case, a
conclusion taking due account of the effect utile principle would not be contrary in any
respect to the letter and spirit of such saving clause (see I.C.J. Reports 1950, page_229).

49. As explained by the ILC in its commentary to the corresponding Draft Articles on
the Law of Treaties, the principle of effect utile (rule of effectiveness; maxim ut res magis
valeat quam pereat) is embedded in the general rule of interpretation of Article 31 (1) of
the VCLT under the control of “good faith” and the “object and purpose of the treaty”
(Commentary to Articles 27 and 28, Introduction, paragraph (6)). Moreover, it should
also be recalled that an interpretation the result of which would render futile or make an
inanity the clear terms of Article 72 of the ICSID Convention or of any other Article of
the Convention could be considered an “unreasonable result” and, consequently, in case
of doubts, the interpreter is allowed to have recourse to the supplementary means of
interpretation of Article 32 of the VCLT, including the published travaux préparatoires,
in order to determine the meaning and scope of the saving clause of Article 72 the
operation of which, as explained in this Opinion, is not subject in any respect to Article
71 of the Convention. The opening words of Article 72 cannot be clearest: “Notice by a
Contracting State pursuant to Articles 70 or 71 shall not affect” the rights or obligations
under the ICSID Convention preserved by the saving clause of Article 72.

*

50. In sum, in the light of the considerations made all along in this opinion, I uphold, the
Respondent’s ratione temporis preliminary objection. It follows therefore that for me the
Claimant’s case failed not only upon ratione personae grounds but as well as for ratione
temporis considerations.

Transban Investments Corp.
v.

Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/24

 

Dissenting and Concurring Opinion of

Professor David D Caron

 

1.

I. Introduction

I concur in much of the Tribunal’s holdings. I agree with the Tribunal’s reasoning and
conclusions regarding the effect of Venezuela’s denunciation of the ICSID Convention on
jurisdiction in this proceeding.! Likewise, I agree with the Tribunal’s reasoning and
conclusions regarding the timeliness of Claimant’s consent to jurisdiction.”

I respectfully dissent, however, from the Tribunal’s holding that the Tribunal lacks
jurisdiction over this claim because Transban Investments Corporation (“Transban” or the
“Claimant”) is not a protected investor within the meaning of Article 1(d) of the 1994
Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Venezuela and the Government
of Barbados for the Promotion and Protection of Investments (the “BIT”). In particular, I
dissent from the Tribunal’s holding that the issuance to Transban in 2001 of a Certificate
of Continuance by the Barbados Registrar of Companies did not “constitute” Transban
Investments Corporation, an acknowledged Barbadian continued corporation under the
laws of Barbados.

II. Understanding Corporate Migration

Critically, the reasons justifying the Majority’s holding that the Claimant is not a protected
investor rest solely on the fact that Transban was “continued” in Barbados rather than
“incorporated.” If Transban had gained its legal status through “incorporation” rather than
“continuance” in Barbados, then Transban would meet the definition of a protected

investor under the BIT.* As indicated by the Tribunal, Respondent raises other objections
to Claimant’s status as a protected investor under the BIT.‘ Given, however, the reliance
of the Majority’s holding on Transban’s status as a “continued Company” under Barbados
law the Majority expresses no view on these other objections.>

4. Given that “continuation” is the basis of the Majority’s decision, it is appropriate to
introduce the practice of continuation. “Continuation” is the term utilized by Barbados for
what is known more generally in Barbados law as “corporate mobility,” and even more
widely known as “corporate migration.” Corporate migration is a process used by some
States whereby a corporation in one State may migrate to another State. The alternative to
such migration is for the corporation in the home State to dissolve and, as it does so, to
transfer all of its assets to a newly established corporation in the receiving State. The
fundamental motivation for the practice of corporate migration is to avoid some of the
unnecessary costs of closing, transferring and reestablishing what is, in many respects, a
very similar corporation. Given that corporate law may be different from State to State,
migration can have peripheral effects upon the company. If one thinks of the corporate
laws of two States as two bottles of slightly different shapes, then corporate migration is
the process of pouring a business enterprise from one bottle to another. The content of the
enterprise remains essentially the same, although its precise shape may be different.
Although there exists substantial literature on the practice of corporate migration, almost
no material was made a part of the record in this proceeding, perhaps a reflection of the

> Professor Schreuer, reviewing the practice of ICSID tribunals, observes that:

An analysis of practice indicates that tribunals have given effect to the definitions of corporate nationality
contained in BITs. If the requirements for corporate nationality under the respective BIT were met, the
tribunals typically refused to second guess it.”

C. Schreuer, Nationality of Investors: Legitimate Restrictions vs. Business Interests, 24 ICSID FOREIGN
INVESTMENT LAW JOURNAL 521, 525 (2009) (Exhibit CL-0119). As an example, Schreuer refers to Tokio Tokeles
v. Ukraine, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Decision on Jurisdiction (Apr 29, 2004), where the Claimant was
incorporated in Lithuania but controlled by Ukrainian nationals. The majority held that Claimant's incorporation
in Lithuania met the BIT’s definition of protected investor.

4 See paragraphs 114-120 and paragraphs 121-127.

> I note for the sake of completeness, that I would deny Respondent’s other objections. Respondent’s other two
objections both seek to rebut the presumptive conclusion that meeting the definition of company in the BIT would
suffice to establish Claimant as a protected investor. Both of Respondent’s objections do so by asserting a form
of abuse of process by Claimant.

The second objection argues that there is an abuse of process because in fact the Claimant continued to operate
as a Venezuelan company at its convenience. Aside from the evidentiary questions present, the key points are (1)
although the global extent of its activities is contested, the record indicates that Transban Investments Corporation
made investments and conducted business not only in Venezuela, but elsewhere in the world and, most
importantly, (2) there is no question that the investments at issue in the proceeding are held by Transban
Investments Corporation, the Barbadian continued company. Respondent does not challenge Claimant’s
ownership of the investment itself. If Claimant had not acquired its investment itself, but rather the investment
had been acquired by Inversiones Transbanca, C.A. (the pre-2001 Venezuelan corporate vessel), then there would
not be a protected investment. As stated, however, no evidence is offered or objection is made in this respect.

The third objection argues that the migration of the corporation to Barbados is an abuse of process in that it is an
effort to manufacture ju ction and thus an abuse of the ICSID mechanism. The corporate migration, however,
occurred in 2001 long before the events in 2007-2009 that gave rise to the present proceedings. It is not contested
that Transban’s status under Barbados law was acquired long before the claims in this proceeding arose.

 

 

assumed basic nature of corporate migration. The primary item included in the record is
the relevant portion of Professor Bruce Welling’s study of corporate law in Canada.° As
to the motivation for corporate migration, Welling writes: “Becoming a corporate
immigrant can be looked upon as a shorter and simplified form of dissolving the
corporation in its home jurisdiction and reincorporating in a new jurisdiction.”

5. Simultaneously, it is important to emphasize what “continuation” is not. As Welling
observes “continuance . . . is not to be confused with the mere carrying on of business in
a jurisdiction other than that which created the corporation. . . . Continuance implies the
more substantial step of abandoning the jurisdiction of incorporation and seeking a new
permanent home ....”* There is no dispute in this proceeding that “continuance” under
Barbadian law is an example of corporate migration.

III. What the Majority Holds and Why I Dissent

6. To be a protected investor under the BIT, Transban must meet the definition of
“companies” in Article 1(d) of the BIT:

“[C]ompanies” means, in respect of each Contracting Party, corporations, firms
and associations incorporated or constituted under the law in force in that
Contracting Party.

The Tribunal concludes at paragraph 175 that Transban does not satisfy the conditions set
out in the definition because it has not been incorporated or constituted under the laws of
Barbados.

7. The Tribunal acknowledges, as it must, at paragraph 132 that:

It is not disputed that Transban is a corporation; the Respondent has not contended
that Transban is not organized as a corporation. What the Respondent argues is
that Transban, although a corporation, is not “incorporated or constituted under the
law in force in [Barbados]”.

The Tribunal also acknowledges, as it must, that there is no dispute that Transban
possesses legal personality under the laws of Barbados. The Tribunal writes at paragraph

Transban received on August 17, 2001 a Certificate of Continuance issued by
Barbadian Registrar of Companies, which certifies that Transban “was continued
as set out in the attached Articles of Continuance, under section 356.2(1) of the
Companies Act of Barbados.”

0120).

In other words, Transban is a corporation and possesses legal personality under the laws
of Barbados. Again, it bears emphasis that the nub of the Majority’s holding is that
Transban is a Barbadian corporation by way of continuance rather than by way of
incorporation.

The Tribunal’s reasoning identifies at paragraph 164 the “key question” as “whether
Transban is ‘a company incorporated or constituted under the law in force’ in Barbados,
because only then it may satisfy the requirements of the definition of companies in
Article 1(d) of the BIT.” The Tribunal appropriately divides this question into two parts:
(1) whether Transban was incorporated under the laws of Barbados and (2) whether
Transban was constituted under the laws of Barbados.

On the question of whether it is “incorporated” under the laws of Barbados, the Tribunal
focuses its analysis on those laws. Given that the BIT defines companies with reference to
the laws of Barbados, the Tribunal appropriately seeks to determine the meaning of
“incorporated” by reference to those laws. The Tribunal points out at paragraph 168 that:

[. . .] the Barbados’ Companies Act, when defining the term “company”,
distinguishes between incorporation and continuation. It defines a “company” as
“a body corporate that is incorporated or continued under this Act”. In the view of
the Tribunal, a company cannot be under the Barbados’ Companies Act continued
and at the same time incorporated.

In addition, Section 356.2 of the Barbados Companies Act provides that “[o]n the date
shown in the certificate of continuance the body corporate becomes a company to which
this Act [i.e., the Companies Act] applies as if the company had been incorporated under
this Act” (emphasis added). In other words, although a continued company will be
regarded as equivalent to an incorporated company, it simultaneously is not a company
that was “incorporated.” I agree with the reasoning of the Majority on this point.

. On the question of whether Transban was “constituted” under the laws of Barbados, the

Tribunal in paragraphs 173-174 argues that it could not have been “constituted” because
“it is clear that it was not formed or established in Barbados, it had been in existence
already for more than four years as Venezuelan company when it decided to move to
Barbados.”

. It is with regards to this reasoning and the conclusion concerning “constituted” that I

strongly dissent. The reasoning misperceives the legal act of continuance and both the law
and realities of corporate existence

. The Tribunal, looking to the ordinary meaning of the word “constitutes,” finds that the

word means to establish or to form. I agree that the BIT points to the adoption of a shared
autonomous meaning for the term “constitutes.” Although the word “incorporate” will
have an analog in all legal systems and thus reference should be made to the analog itself,
the word “constitutes” is a more general term allowing for other ways in which legal
systems “establish” or “form” companies.

13.

The Tribunal fails to recognize, however, that the granting of the Certificate of
Continuance “established” or “formed” Transban Investments Corporation, a legal entity
that did not previously exist. That the predecessor Venezuelan company, Inversiones
Transbanca, C.A., had existed for four years as a legal entity within the Venezuelan legal
system is irrelevant. Consider, for example, if the predecessor Venezuelan company had
dissolved and transferred all of its assets to a newly incorporated company in Barbados. It
would make no difference that essentially the same business enterprise previously existed
for four years as a different legal entity in the Venezuelan legal system. Although the
business enterprises were very similar, the legal act of incorporation would have created
a new entity under the Barbados legal system. Likewise, before the issuance of its
Certificate of Continuation, a continued corporation in Barbados operating under the name
of Transban Investments Corporation did not exist. Transban Investments Corporation
was formed, established and constituted by the issuance of the Certificate of Continuance.

. The realities of corporate migration highlight that the formation and establishment of

Transban Investments Corporation was a particularly significant legal act. Property, debts,
rights and liabilities of Transban Investments Corporation are held or appertain to
Transban Investments Corporation, and not to its pre 2001 Venezuelan legal form,
Inversiones Transbanca, C.A. Recalling the imagery in paragraph 4, if one thinks of the
corporate laws of Venezuela and Barbados as providing two bottles of slightly different
shapes, then corporate migration is the process of pouring a business enterprise from a
Venezuelan bottle labeled Inversiones Transbanca, C.A. to a Barbadian bottle labeled
Transban Investments Corporation. Importantly, the word “constitutes” relates to the
bottle and not to the content that migrated. Thus, in this instance, Barbadian law
established, formed and constituted a bottle that had not previously existed, a bottle that
would now hold rights and bear obligations exclusively, a bottle labeled Transban
Investments Corporation. For these reasons, I am unable to agree with the view of the
Majority.

IV. The Distinction between this Proceeding and the
Official Acts and Policy of Barbados

. In the longest section of its reasoning (paragraphs 148 to 161) as to whether Transban is

an investor protected by the BIT, the Tribunal addresses an argument of Respondent as to
whether Transban was entitled at all to the 2001 Certificate of Continuance issued by the
Barbados Registrar of Companies. In addressing this argument, the Tribunal analyses not
the specific application of the laws of Venezuela to Transban, but the application of these
laws generally to Venezuelan companies seeking continuance. It must be emphasized,
however, that this extended section of reasoning is not a basis for the Majority’s holding
that Transban is not an investor protected by the BIT. I offer these comments to mitigate
any uncertainty that this dangling thread of reasoning potentially creates for other
continued companies within Barbados as well as the corporate migration process of
Barbados generally.

. A condition in Section 356.1. (1) for a company applying for a Certificate of Continuance

is that it is “‘so authorised under the laws of that other [i.e., non-Barbadian] jurisdiction”

in which the applying company is incorporated. The Parties disagree as to whether the
laws of Venezuela “authorise” companies incorporated in Venezuela to apply for
continuance in other jurisdictions. The Tribunal accepts that Venezuela does not prohibit
corporate migration but concludes in paragraph 161 that the word authorise “means
something more than just a lack of express prohibition of corporate mobility in the laws
of the jurisdiction of the original incorporation of a company.”

. Tagree with the Majority that, on the basis of the evidence and argument presented to the

Tribunal (limitations recognized likewise by the Tribunal itself), and placing myself in the
position of the Barbadian Registrar of Companies, I would interpret the term “authorise”
in Section 356.1 to mean something more than just a lack of express prohibition of
corporate mobility in the laws of the home jurisdiction. However, such a conclusion on
the part of the Tribunal does not itself yield a conclusion bearing on the case before it. The
Tribunal correctly does not use its reasoning as a basis for its holding because such
reasoning does not alter or address the fact that the Registrar issued a Certificate of
Continuance to Transban in 2001. ICSID jurisprudence consistently regards the award of
citizenship by a State as presumptive proof of the nationality of an individual. The award
of a certificate of continuance should be no different. As with the proof of nationality of
individuals, such a presumption may be overcome. But there is no evidence, or indeed
argument, in this proceeding that Transban in any way misled the Barbadian Registrar of
Companies. Accordingly, the reasoning of the Award is not a questioning of the specific
application of the law of Barbados to Transban, but rather a questioning of the approach
of Barbados generally to the application of its law on corporate mobility. Moreover, it
would apply not only to all other Venezuelan companies who, having gaining Certificates
of Continuance, migrated to Barbados, but it would also apply to corporate migrants from
all countries where there is not a prohibition on corporate mobility but also not an
authorisation.

. For this reason, the Tribunal’s inclusion of the phrase “on the basis of the evidence and

argument presented” is an important limitation and a recognition by the Tribunal that its
reasoning should not be seen as a questioning of the approach of Barbados to the general
application of its laws. In my opinion, the preferable response to Respondent’s argument
would have been to state that the 2001 Certificate of Continuance presumptively
establishes the corporate continuance of Transban under the laws of Barbados and that
Respondent does not establish a basis whereby that presumption may be rebutted.

V. Conclusion

. I respectfully dissent from the Majority’s holding that the Claimant, acknowledged as a

continued corporation under the laws of Barbados, was not “constituted” under the laws
of Barbados and thus is not a protected investor within the meaning of the BIT.
