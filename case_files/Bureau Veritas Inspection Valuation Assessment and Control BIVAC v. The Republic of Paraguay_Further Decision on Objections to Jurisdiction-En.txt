4. BIVAC and Paraguay are hereafter referred to as the “Parties”.

2. The Arbitral Tribunal

5. The parties were unable to agree on the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal.
Therefore, it was constituted in accordance with Articles 37(2)(b) and 38 of the
Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of
Other States (“ICSID Convention”) and Articles 2 to 5 of the ICSID Rules of
Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (“ICSID Arbitration Rules”). By letter dated 14
June 2007 BIVAC appointed Mr. L. Yves Fortier, C.C., O.Q., Q.C., LL.D, a Canadian

national as arbitrator. Mr. Fortier accepted the appointment on 20 June 2007. By letter

2

dated 9 July 2007 Paraguay appointed Professor Philippe Sands QC, a British and
French national. Professor Sands accepted the appointment on 13 July 2007.
Following consultations with the parties, the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or “the Centre”) appointed Professor Dr. Rolf Knieper,
a German national, as the presiding arbitrator. Professor Knieper accepted the

appointment on 10 March 2008.

6. By letter dated 10 March 2008, ICSID informed the parties that as of that date the
Tribunal had been constituted and that the proceedings were deemed to have
commenced. During the first session of the Tribunal which was held with the parties
on 20 May 2008 in Washington, D.C., the parties agreed that the Tribunal had been
properly constituted in accordance with the provisions of the ICSID Convention and
the Arbitration Rules in force since April 2006, which are applicable to these

proceedings.

7. After Mr. Gonzalo Flores, ICSID, and Mr. Sergio Puig de la Parra, ICSID, Ms.
Mercedes Cordido-Freytes de Kurowski was appointed to serve as Secretary of the

Tribunal.

3. Procedural History and Background

3.1. The Developments up to the Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction

8. On 20 February 2007 ICSID received a Request for Arbitration from BIVAC dated 16
February 2007. In its request BIVAC asserted that it had made investments in
Paraguay which were protected under the Agreement between the Kingdom of the
Netherlands and the Republic of Paraguay on Encouragement and Reciprocal

Protection of Investments (“the Treaty” or the “BIT”).'

9. In its request and in further submissions BIVAC asserted that Paraguay violated

' Exhibit CE-66, (signed on 29 October 1992; entered into force on 1 August 1994).

3

various obligations under the Treaty. BIVAC had concluded a contract with the
Ministry of Finance of Paraguay on 6 May 1996 for the provision of technical services
for pre-shipment inspection of imports into Paraguay (“the Contract”). The Contract
was to run for a term of three years, from 15 July 1996, which term was to be renewed
periodically, unless one of the parties gave written notice of its intention not to renew
the Contract no less than four months before the expiration of the term (Article 8.2).'
The Contract was terminated in June 1999 upon mutual agreement of the parties.
BIVAC asserts that it carried out some 70,000 inspections over the three year period
and that it had issued 35 invoices. It alleges that 19 of the invoices remained unpaid
amounting to US$ 22,016,142 and that the last payment made by the Ministry of
Finance was in March 1999.4 BIVAC estimates that as of 31 August 2011 the total
amount due under the outstanding invoices together with accrued interest is US$

63,969,775.13.°

The Centre registered the Request for Arbitration on 11 April 2007 and duly notified
the parties thereof after having been provided with explanations from BIVAC as to the
qualification of its activities as an investment and to the relationship between the

dispute settlement provisions in the Treaty and in the Contract.

Paraguay has consistently objected to the jurisdiction of the Centre and the Arbitral
Tribunal. It has insisted that neither the appointment of an arbitrator nor the agreement
to the constitution of the Tribunal were to be interpreted as its consent to jurisdiction.
It asserted inter alia that Paraguay had not agreed to arbitration before ICSID, that its
relationship with BIVAC was based on an administrative contract which is not covered
by the Treaty, that BIVAC had not made an investment in the territory of Paraguay and
that Article 9.1 of the Contract contains an exclusive dispute settlement mechanism.
Article 9.1 states:
“Any conflict, controversy or claim which arises from or is produced in

relation to this Contract, non compliance, resolution or invalidity shall be
submitted to the Tribunals of the City of Asuncién pursuant to Paraguayan

> Contract between the Ministry of Finance of the Government of the Republic of Paraguay and Bureau Veritas, Inspection,
Valuation, Assessment and Control, BIVAC B.V., regarding the rendering of Technical Services for the Pre-Shipment
Inspection of Imports, (dated 6 May 1996), Exhibit CE-6.A (Contract in English) // CE-6.B (in Spanish).

Law.

During its first session the Tribunal decided that:

“In view of Paraguay’ objections, after hearing from both parties, the Tribunal
decided as follows (as reflected in the Tribunal’s Procedural Order No 1 of
June 12, 2008, amended by letter of the Secretary to the parties of June 25,
2008 (attached to these Minutes as Annexes 2 and 3, respectively)):

- The Respondent’s Preliminary Objections, as set out in the documents dated
April 9, 2008 and May 20, 2008, shall be treated as a preliminary question;

- The proceedings on the merits are suspended until such time as the Tribunal
has adopted a decision on the Preliminary Objections raised by the
Respondent, as provided by Article 41, paragraph 2 of the Convention”.

This was recorded in the Minutes of the session signed by the Secretary and the

President on 6 and 7 July 2008.

Subsequently, the Tribunal received the Claimant’s Counter-Memorial dated 3 July
2008, the Respondent’s Reply dated 18 August 2008 and the Claimant’s Rejoinder
dated 2 October 2008. All were submitted within the time limits prescribed by the
Tribunal. A hearing on jurisdiction was held in Washington D.C. on 11 November
2008. In addition both partiessubmitted post-hearing briefs, the Respondent on 8
December 2008 and the Claimant on 22 December 2008, as agreed by the Tribunal. As
set out below, the Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction was rendered by the Tribunal

on 29 May 2009.°

By letter dated 5 December 2008, the Respondent further requested the Tribunal to
dismiss the claim on the ground that BIVAC lacked standing. Paraguay asserted that
the real party in interest was BIVAC International S.A. (“BIVAC International”) and
not BIVAC BV. By letter dated 11 December 2008, BIVAC responded to Paraguay’s
letter and requested the Tribunal to reject Paraguay’s new submission as inadmissible
on the grounds that it raised new arguments on objections to jurisdiction, contradicting
the Tribunal’s decision not to allow any new arguments to be made at the preliminary
stage of the proceedings. It also asserted that BIVAC BV, the Dutch company, was the
party to the Contract and thus the real party in interest. The Tribunal invited Paraguay
to give its views on the issue, which it did by letter dated 19 December 2008. BIVAC

5

reiterated its request that Paraguay’s new arguments as to standing should be declared

inadmissible by letter dated 22 December 2008.

3.2. The Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction

15. The salient features of the Decision of 29 May 2009 are reproduced here to assist in

understanding the procedure leading to this Further Decision and its motivation.

16. The Tribunal ruled on the jurisdictional issues as follows:

“(a) it has no jurisdiction in relation to the claim made under Article 6 of the
BIT;

(b) it has jurisdiction in relation to the claim made under Article 3(1) of the
BIT, and that claim is admissible;

(c) it has jurisdiction in relation to the claim made under Article 3(4) of the
BIT but that the claim is inadmissible, and it joins to the merits the issue of
whether the consequence of the decision on inadmissibility is that the claim
should be dismissed or the exercise of jurisdiction stayed;

(d) the claim raised by Paraguay in its letter of 5 December 2008 as to the
standing of BIVAC to bring the claims is joined to the merits; and

(e) all other questions, including those concerning the costs and expenses of

the Tribunal and the costs of the parties determination are reserved for future
determination.”

3.2.1. Operative Paragraph A

17. Article 6 of the BIT stipulates that Dutch investments in Paraguay would not be
expropriated except if carried out for a public purpose, on a non-discriminatory basis
and accompanied by the payment of just compensation. The provision reads:

“Neither Contracting Party shall take any measures depriving, directly or
indirectly, nationals of the other Contracting Party of their investments unless
the following conditions are complied with:

(a) the measures are taken in the public interest and under due process of law;

(b) the measures are not discriminatory or contrary to any undertaking which
the Contracting Party which takes such measures may have given;

(c) the measures are taken against just compensation...”

" [bid., para. 162.

The Tribunal held that “in circumstances in which there is no dispute that the alleged
contractual debt continues to exist, or that the forum for the resolution of contractual
dispute remains fully available, the materials put forward by BIVAC do not raise the
possibility of an arguable case of expropriation. To take the standard argued for by the
Claimant, the Tribunal is not satisfied prima facie that the Claimant’s claims are

29

capable of constituting the alleged breach of the Treaty.

3.2.1. Operative Paragraph B

19.

20.

21.

Article 3(1) of the BIT stipulates that Dutch investment in Paraguay would be granted

fair and equitable treatment. The provision reads:

“Each Contracting Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment of the
investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party and shall not impair,
by unreasonable or discriminatory measures, the operation, management,
maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal thereof by those nationals.”"”

The Tribunal found that BIVAC had advanced a factual and legal case which, if
established, would be capable of giving rise to a violation of Article 3(1) of the BIT. It
was satisfied that based on the Claimant’s description of the circumstances of the claim
and Respondent’s reaction it could provisionally conclude that Paraguay’s failure to
challenge the validity of the Contract, BIVAC’s compliance with its obligations, and
the level of indebtedness amounted to an acknowledgement of the debt. Without
expressing any view on the question of whether a persistent failure to pay an
outstanding debt could in itself ever amount to a violation of the fair and equitable
treatment standard, or whether Paraguay had acted not only like an ordinary
contracting party but had exercised governmental power (“puissance publique’), the
Tribunal concluded that these questions were arguable and relevant for the merits and

that this finding sufficed at the preliminary stage to establish its jurisdiction.

The Tribunal further held that the dispute resolution clause set out in Article 9 of the
Contract was no bar to the admissibility of the claim since it was not based on the

application and performance of the Contract as such. Rather, it was based on

 

S Exhibit CE-66.
° Decision on Objections to Jurisdction, para. 117.

"° Ibid.

Paraguay’s alleged exercise of sovereign power in a manner that violated the Treaty

standard and was no mere breach of contract."’

3.2.1. Operative Paragraph C

22. Article 3(4) of the BIT provides that “[eJach Contracting Party shall observe any
obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments of the other Contracting

Party.”

 

23. The Tribunal had concluded this claim was inadmi

 

ible, because

“(1) In Article 9(1) of the Contract the parties agreed to a legally binding
exclusive jurisdiction clause which provided for the resolution of “any
conflict, controversy or claim which arises from or is produced in relation to
[the] Contract” only by the Tribunals of the City of Asuncién;

(2) Article 3(4) of the BIT does not override the exclusive jurisdiction clause
of Article 9(1) of the Contract;

(3) “the fundamental basis of the claim” presented by BIVAC in respect of
Article 3(4) of the BIT concerns a “conflict, controversy or claim” arising
from or produced in relation to the Contract;

(4) having regard to the need to respect the autonomy of the parties, BIVAC
cannot rely on the Contract as the basis of a claim under Article 3(4) of the
BIT when the Contract itself refers that claim exclusively to another forum, in
the absence of exceptional reasons which might make the contractual forum
unavailable;

(5) the proper forum for the resolution of the contractual claim that has been
raised under Article 3(4) of the BIT is the Tribunals of the City of Asuncién,
applying the law of Paraguay.”"”

24. Despite its finding on inadmissibility the Tribunal decided that it was not in a position
to dismiss the claim. It decided instead to stay the proceedings on the grounds that it
had not been provided with arguments by the parties as to the course to be followed in
the event that jurisidiction is upheld under Article 3(4) of the BIT. The Tribunal
therefore decided to join the question of an alternative course to the merits in order to

give the parties the opportunity to present arguments as to the the appropriate course of

 

action to be followed, and to allow BIVAC the possibility to explain why it had not

"' Ibid., paras. 123-127.
"2 Ibid. para. 159.

had recourse to Tribunals of the City of Asuncién, the forum agreed in the Contract."

3.2.1. Operative Paragraph D

25.

26.

The Respondent’s objection to jurisdiction ratione personae was first raised in its letter
dated 5 December 2008, after the hearing on jurisdiction. The Tribunal decided that
this was too late to allow for a substantive debate of these new arguments at the
preliminary stage. A decision on this matter would have been inconsistent with basic
principles of due process and procedural economy. The Tribunal had therefore decided,
in accordance with Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention, to join this new objection

to the merits.

The Decision on Jurisdiction of 29 May 2009, has therefore left the Arbitral Tribunal

with the following matters to be resolved in the award on the merits:

. whether the Claimant had ius standi in the proceedings;

. whether the Respondent had violated its obligation of fair and equitable
treatment in addition to an eventual breach of contract;

. whether the inadmissible claim for a violation of the umbrella clause should be
dismissed or stayed;

. how costs and expenses should be allocated.

3.3. The Developments up to the Further Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction

27.

28.

On 29 May 2009, the Tribunal invited the parties by letter to agree on a timetable for
the next phase of the proceedings and inform the Tribunal of such agreement or, failing
an agreement, to inform the Tribunal by 12 June 2009 of their respective positions.
This date was extended to 26 June 2009, then to 28 July 2009 and then to 10 August

2009, on each occasion at the request of both Parties.

As the Parties did not respond to the Tribunal’s invitation, it issued Procedural Order

' Tbid., paras. 160-161.

29.

30.

31.

32.

No. 2 dated 12 August 2009, which fixed the timetable for next phase of the
proceedings. The Claimant was to submit a Memorial on the merits no later than 13
October 2009, as well as its pleadings with respect to BIVAC’s ius standi and to the
consequences of the inadmissibility of the claim under Article 3(4) of the BIT; the
Respondent was to submit a Counter-Memorial on the merits no later than 14
December 2009; the Claimant was to submit a Reply no later than 28 January 2010

and the Respondent was to submit a Rejoinder no later than 15 March 2010.

Following a common request from the Parties communicated to the Tribunal on 30
September 2009, by letter dated 7 October 2009, the Tribunal granted an extension of
time for the submission of the Parties’ written pleadings: the Claimant’s Memorial was
to be filed on 27 November 2009, the Respondent’s Counter-Memorial on 22 January
2010, the Reply on 5 March 2010 and the Rejoinder on 16 April 2010. The Tribunal
further indicated that it would be available for hearings during the last week of July

2010.

The Claimant duly submitted its Memorial on 27 November 2009. Following a further
request from the Respondent for another extension of time on 27 January 2010 to
which Claimant had given its conditioned agreement, the Tribunal decided by letter
dated 29 January 2010 to further extend the time limits. The Respondent’s Counter-
Memorial was to be submitted no later than 12 March 2010, the Claimant’s Reply by 7
May 2010 and the Respondent’s Rejoinder by 25 June 2010. The dates for the hearing

were unchanged.

The Respondent submitted its Counter-Memorial on 12 March 2010.

On 6 May 2010, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that the Parties had agreed to a
suspension of the arbitration to allow for settlement negotiations. Following receipt of
the Respondent’s confirmation of its agreement to suspend, the Tribunal granted a
suspension until 4 August 2010. The hearing due to be held in July 2010 was
postponed until a later date. The Tribunal acceeded to a request made by the Parties on
29 July 2010 for an extension of the suspension until 4 November 2010. By letter
dated 29 October 2010, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that no request for a

further suspension would be made.
10

34,

35.

36.

37.

The Claimant and the Respondent agreed on a new procedural calendar and
communicated the dates by letter dated 18 November 2010 and by e-mail of 19
November 2010, respectively. The timetable was then fixed by the Tribunal’s letter
dated 20 November 2010 as follows: the Claimant was to submit its Reply on 11
February 2011 and Respondent its Rejoinder on 9 June 2011. Both Parties duly

submitted their pleadings within these timelimits.

The dates for the hearing on the merits were fixed for 5 to 7 July 2011 by letter of the
Tribunal dated 20 November 2010, and confirmed during a telephone conference
between the President of the Tribunal, the Parties and the Secretary of the Tribunal on
9 June 2011. During the conference call the date of 15 September 2011 was fixed for

post-hearing briefs for both Parties.

The delays to these proceedings are considerable as noted by counsel for the Claimant
during the hearing in the opening statement that “here we are, four years later, in
ICSID”. The delays are the result of repeated requests for extensions of time for

submissions and for the suspension of the proceedings by the Parties.

The hearing was held in Washington D.C. from 5 to 7 July 2011. BIVAC was
represented by Mr. Nigel Blackaby, Mr. Lluis Paradell, Ms. Caroline Richard and Mr.
Nigel Best from Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, Mr. Pablo Lu from Mersaén
Abogados and Mr. Andrew Hibbert from BIVAC BV. Paraguay was represented by Dr.
José Enrique Garcia Avalos, Procurador General de la Reptiblica, Mr. Ratil Sapena,
Lawyer of the Treasury, Mr. Benigno Marfa Lopez, Member of the Directorate of the
Central Bank of Paraguay, Mr. Brian C. Dunning and Mr. David N. Cinotti from
Venable LLP.

During the hearing and in consultation with the Parties, the Tribunal modified its initial
timetable for the conduct of the hearing, but both Parties were offered equal time to
give an oral presentation of their submissions. The oral arguments made on behalf of

BIVAC were presented by Messrs. Blackaby and Paradell, and on behalf of Paraguay

38.

39.

40.

41.

42.

by Messrs. Dunning, Cinotti and Dr. Garefa-Avalos. Both Parties used slideshows

during the hearing which were also submitted to the Tribunal.

At the end of the hearing both Parties expressed their satisfaction with the conduct of
the hearing and confirmed to have been treated equally and granted full opportunity to

present their respective arguments.'*

On 12 September 2011, the Parties asked for an extension of the time limit for the
post-hearing briefs until 23 September 2011. This extension was granted by the
Tribunal, and both post-hearing briefs were submitted on time. During the hearing the
date for cost submissions was fixed for 14 October 2011, which was accepted and

respected by both Parties.'°

On 2 December 2011, the Tribunal addressed the following letter to the Parties:

“When the Tribunal prepared internal deliberations and consulted the Codigo
Civil which had been introduced into the proceedings for different reasons,
the question arose whether BIVAC's contractual claim might be time barred,
in accordance with Articles 657 to 668 of the Cédigo.

The Tribunal invites both parties to react to the following questions and this
until Thursday, December 22, 2011 at 5:00 p.m. (Washington, D.C. time).

1. Is Claimant's contractual claim time barred according to Paraguayan law,
and if so, since when?

2. Does the answer to question 1) in any way have any impact upon the
question of Paraguay’s alleged violation of its treaty obligation to treat
BIVAC fairly and equitably, and BIVAC’s alleged claim under the BIT?”

On 23 December 2011, both the Claimant and Respondent submitted their reponse to
the questions posed by the Tribunal, after their common request for a one day

extension of the time limit had been granted by the Tribunal.

The Claimant argues that the contractual claim is not time barred. Even if the period of
prescription under the Civil Code of either four or two years might have been

exceeded, the repeated unequivocal acknowledgment of the debt by the Respondent

 

‘ Hearing on the Merits, 5-7 July 2011, transcript, p. 93.
u

 

p. 607.

and then the request of arbitration had interrupted the limitation period until this day.
Moreover, the problem of time bar according to Paraguayan law is of no significance
since the Claimant pursues a claim under international law for which Paraguayan

contract law is not applicable, and not a contractual claim.

43. The Respondent submits that the normal period of limitation is ten years. Like the
Claimant it asserts that the period of limitation has been interrupted before it had

ended.

4, The Reasons for this Decision

4.1. The Uncontested and the Controversial Factual Contours of the Dispute
4.1.1. The Contract: its Conclusion and Termination

44. In 1995, upon recommendation of the International Monetary Fund, the Government
of President Juan Carlos Wasmosy implemented measures to remedy tax evasion,
among which it established a “programme of pre-shipment inspection” aimed at
optimizing the rate of collection of import duties and taxes.’ Following a selection
process, the Ministry of Finance selected two bidders, the Bureau Veritas group and

Société Générale de Surveillance SA (“SGS”), to render these services."*

45. On 31 January 1996, the Government issued Executive Decree No. 12.311 authorizing
the Ministry of Finance to enter into these contracts." On 6 May 1996, the Ministry of
Finance entered into the Contract with BIVAC for the provision of such technical
services for pre-shipment inspection of imports in Paraguay. The Decree refers to
“BIVAC INTERNATIONAL (BUREAU VERITAS GROUP)” of France, rather than
BIVAC B.V., and the Contract identifies “Bureau Veritas, Inspection, Valuation,

Assessment and Control, BIVAC B.V.” as the contracting partner.”

"7 Witness Statement of Mr. Bojanovich, paras. 8-9; Preamble to the Contract, Exhibit CE-6

'S Report of the General Controller of the Republic to the Ministry of Finance regarding the process for concluding contracts
with BIVAC and SGS, dated 22 February 1999, Exhibit CE-71; Report No 1/96 of the Legal Advisor to the Presidency of the
Paraguayan Republic to the Secretary General of the President of the Paraguayan Republic, dated 31 January 1996, Exhibit
CE-4; Preamble to the Contract, Exhibit CE-6; see also BIVAC Memorial, paras.17-19.

" Executive Decree No. 12.311, Exhibit CE-5.

48.

The customs inspection and clearance system that BIVAC was to operate and the
services it was to provide were regulated by the State, in particular through Resolution
No. 1171/96 “which regulates the operational procedure for the pre-shipment

inspection of imports”, and its subsequent modifications.”

By the terms of the Contract, BIVAC was inter alia required to: (i) physically identify
the goods prior to shipment; (ii) appraise the reasonableness of the price charged by

the seller; (iii) estimate the customs value; (iv) issue certificates of inspection; (v) train

 

Paraguayan personnel; and (vi) assist in the establishment of a database. BIVAC was

 

allowed to open and maintain a lia

 

son office in Paraguay, which was constituted as
“BIVAC Paraguay S.A.”. The Ministry of Finance was obliged to pay fees for the
technical services, which were to be calculated as a percentage of the FOB value of the
goods set out in the certificates of inspection. Such fees were to be invoiced on a
monthly basis to the Ministry of Finance in U.S. dollars and paid within 20 days of
receipt to BIVAC’s offshore bank account. The Contract provided that any differences
arising with respect to the documentation that accompanied the invoices were to be

resolved promptly and the undisputed amount of the invoice paid forthwith.”

The Contract also provided that Paraguayan law was applicable and that disputes in
relation to the Contract with regard to its “non compliance, resolution or invalidity”
were to be submitted to the tribunals of the City of Asuncién.” As set out below, after a
dispute had arisen under the Contract the Claimant chose not to bring a claim to the

pleadings prior to the hearing that these tribunals were not available, or that it was
barred from access to the Paraguayan courts to pursue its claim based on a breach of
contract.” Rather, in response to a question from the Tribunal, it stated that the
decision not to go the tribunals of the City of Asuncién was a “commercial
decision”.*“Instead, the Claimant decided to pursue its claim through a different

channel as the Respondent allegedly not only breached the Contract but also violated

49. Over the course of these proceedings both Parties have revised their characterization
of the Contract. The Claimant initially emphasized the character of the private
investment and the Contract as obliging the Parties to pay service fees in exchange of
services and also involving rights granted under public law.” It later shifted its
approach, emphasising that the Contract “was, from its inception, an eminently public
law contract’.’ For its part, Paraguay initially insisted on the characterization of the
Contract as being administrative in character," but later insisted on the commercial
character of the contractual relationship, given that “Sovereigns and their organs

contract with private parties routinely in nearly every economic sector”.* It stresses

that in line with modern doctrine, jurisdiction and international conventions the quality
of a contract must be determined according to its nature and not its purpose or

motive.*

50. Initially, the Government of President Wasmosy complied with its obligations to make
regular payments upon receipt of BIVAC’s invoices. However, the evidence shows that
delays in payments began as early as November 1996.* By mid-1998, a number of
unpaid invoices had begun to accumulate and Mr. Bojanovich of BIVAC wrote to the
Minister of Finance to request payment of certain outstanding invoices issued after
June 1997.% The Respondent’s then Minister of Finance, Miguel Angel Maidana

Zayas, acknowledged the total sum of the “outstanding debt of the Paraguayan State in

the Contract for the services provided in 1998.” With regards to the outstanding debt
for 1997, the Minister indicated that his office was examining legal mechanisms to

“regulate” such debt to the satisfaction of the Parties’ interests.*

51. The new Government of President Ratil Cubas took office in August 1998.
Investigations into the manner in which the previous regime had entered into the
Contract were instigated.” Thereafter, from September 1998 to June 1999, none of the

new invoice:

 

ued by BIVAC were paid. BIVAC made several requests for payment
to President Cubas’ Minister of Finance, Mr. Gerhard Doll, but no payments were
forthcoming. In January 1999, BIVAC sent the Minister a formal demand for payment
by certified telegram.” Minister Doll responded a week later objecting to all
documents attached to the invoices submitted by BIVAC (from June to December
1997 and from March 1998 onwards), on the basis of alleged breaches of Clause 5 of
the Contract.*' Minister Doll’s telegram did not specify BIVAC’s alleged breaches of
the Contract. Minister Doll referred to Article 4.5 of the Contract and convened
BIVAC to a meeting to resolve the Parties’ discrepancies with respect to the
documentation that accompanied the invoices. In March 1999, following a meeting

between the Parties, a number of invoices dating back to 1997 were paid, amounting to

 

more than $7 million. This was the last payment received by BIVAC.**

Government not to renew the Contract beyond its initial term, pursuant to Clause 8 of
the Contract. Presidential Decree No. 2003 did not allege any contractual breach
either." On 24 February 1999, Minister Doll notified BIVAC of the Government’s

decision not to renew the Contract.*

4.1.2. The Alleged Acknowledgment and Repudiation of the Debt under the Contract by the
Respondent

53. On 7 June 1999, given the decision not to renew the Contract and “taking into account
the accumulation of financial commitments that the Paraguay State will assume on
account of the same”, Minister of Finance Federico Zayas, appointed by President
Cubas’ successor, President Luis Angel Gonzdlez Macchi, proposed that the
termination date of the Contract be brought forward to 9 June 1999 (instead of 15 July
1999 as set forth in the Contract).” Minister Zayas indicated that “[a]s of this date the
obligations emerging for both parties related to the Contract for the Rendering of

Services shall cease, except the rights already acquired”.**

54. On 8 June 1999, BIVAC agreed not to accept additional inspection requests from

importers of 9 June 1999. However, BIVAC indicated that it would not discontinue

 

ongoing operations and that it would submit the corresponding invoices to Paraguay.
BIVAC reiterated its request for payment of the sums due under the Contract, which it

claimed amounted to $US 21,434,956.97, as of 30 April 1999.”

55. On 14 June 1999, in order to negotiate payment, Minister Zayas proposed a 50%
discount on the outstanding balance of the debt, indicating that such balance would be
set out in due course.” In a subsequent meeting between the Parties’ representatives,

the Minister offered to pay in Government bonds.*' On 6 August 1999, BIVAC

expressed its willingness to accept payment of the whole or a part of the outstanding

debt in Government bonds.”

56. Around the same time, the Ministry of Finance issued a list of nineteen “outstanding
ssued by BIVAC as of June 1999”, calculating the “total debt as of 30 June
1999” amounted to US$22,016,140.52 (for the years 1997 to 1999). Another list
entitled “outstanding debt with BIVAC held at the Paymaster’s Department of the

 

invoices

 

Ministry of Finance” and dated 6 August 1999 reproduces the same total amount,

specifying that no credit notes had been issued for this period.

57. In a subsequent letter dated 2 December 1999, Minister Zayas indicated that BIVAC’s
request for payment could not be dealt with until the General Comptroller of the
Republic completed its “Special Investigation” into the Contract, pursuant to the
request formulated by the Office of the Attorney General in a Note dated 14 July 1999,
a copy of which was enclosed to the letter.“ Then, on 13 December 1999, Minister
Zayas responded to a further request for payment sent by BIVAC on 7 December 1999.
Minister Zayas referred to its previous letter of 2 December 1999 and mentioned that
no payment could be done until the National Congress had passed a law authorizing
payment.* In September 2000, the Minister told the press that the debts owed to
BIVAC and SGS had been unlawfully assumed by the Wasmosy Government, since
they had not been authorized by a law of Congress, but were rather entered into
pursuant to a Decree.* Minister Zayas’s tenure ended without payment being effected
and the recovery of the debt fell to be pursued with the next Minister of Finance, Mr.

Francisco Oviedo Britez.”

momentary inability to make any payment until the conclusion of the ongoing
investigation and the completion of account reconciliation. Minister Britez undertook
to then proceed to obtain the necessary budgetary amendment from Congress to
finance and pay the pending obligations owed by Paraguay for the services rendered

by BIVAC.*

Under President Nicanor Duarte Frutos, who took office in 2003, Vice-Minister of
Finance, Miguel Gomez, sent a further letter to BIVAC dated 19 April 2004, in which
he noted that Paraguay wished to honor the debts it had with its different creditors,
including BIVAC, and that it was working on finding a solution for the claimed
amounts. The letter also invited BIVAC’s representatives to settlement negotiations.”
Disputing what is alleged by BIVAC,” Paraguay contends that this letter is not an

unequivocal promise to pay the debt".

On 3 June 2004, the Ministry of Finance adopted Resolution No. 274, by which it
established a new Commission to determine whether there was non-compliance with

the Contract and whether payment of the pending debts was in order.” The

 

Commission concluded that it lacked competence to decide the matter, following

 

which the investigation was reassigned to the National Customs Office, pursuant to
Resolution No. 43 adopted by the Ministry of Finance on 3 February 2005." Although
the Commission concluded that the Contract had been complied with,“ no payment
was made. On 22 June 2007, the Ministry of Interior issued Decree No. 10485,

opening a new investigation into the Contract.*

 

BIVAC alleges that within a period of several years successive administrations have
vacillated between on the one hand, acknowledging the obligation to pay the debt and
on the other, commissioning repetitive and overlapping investigations into the validity

and performance of the Contract; that most of these investigations have led to the

conclusion that the Contract was valid and that BIVAC had fully complied with its

obligations;® that suc

 

ssive Governments have failed to abide by their findings and
have refused to make any payment; that they have escalated the unpaid debt into a

political issue; and that all successive administrations have refused to take

 

responsibility and make payment.” According to the Claimant, since both the validity
of the Contract and BIVAC’s performance under the Contract have been recognized,
the consistent non-payment and “Paraguay's conduct constitute[s] an effective political

repudiation of the debt”.*

The Respondent objects to BIVAC’s assertion that the debt was ever acknowledged, or
to its characterization of the existence of the debt as “undisputed”. It asserts that the
various ministerial letters referred to by the Claimant are largely statements of fact and

do not contain any legally binding expre:

 

ion of acknowledgment and that the
different reports established by Government agencies are to be qualified as internal
documents, advisory technical opinions, dictamen, of a non-binding character. The
Respondent insists that Paraguay’s legal position as to the validity and the quantum of
the debt does not equal its repudiation as alleged by Claimant:® “Paraguay has never

10

repudiated any of BIVAC’s contractual rights”.

  

The Respondent also alleges that the Tribunal did not accurately portray Paraguay’s
position when it held in its Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction that “at no point did
any authority acting on behalf of Paraguay conclude that the Contract had not been
complied with or challenge the level of amounts owing under the 19 unpaid invoices”.
In support of this claim it sets forth two arguments. First, the Respondent deems the
acceptance or challenge of the alleged debt as a substantive matter, which was to be
dealt with at the merits stage of proceedings pursuant to Procedural Order No.1.

Second, the Respondent alleges it rebutted the Claimant’s argument that the

°° BIVAC asserts that such conclusions are reflected in: (i) the audit by the Contralorfa General de la Reptiblica conducted
from October 2000 to October 2002, which concluded that the Contract was valid and that the assertions of breach were
unfounded; (ii) formal recognitions of the debt by the Minister of Finance, as declared in February 2001 and in April 2004;
and (iii) the investigation initiated by the Direccién Nacional de Aduanas in February 2005, which led to the conclusion that
BIVAC had fully complied with the Contract; see Tribunal’s Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, May 29, 2009, para 10.

Respondent had never challenged the debt. The Respondent insists it devoted no fewer
than three full paragraphs in its Post-Hearing Memorial on Jurisdiction to this issue,
and alleges the Respondent’s challenge was acknowledged by the Tribunal. Further,
the Respondent alleges the Tribunal’s perception of the Respondent’s position in
paragraphs 123 and 124 contradicts the Tribunal’s own observations in paragraph

111.7

The Respondent further submits that even if the Minister had admitted the debt,
BIVAC’s claims are “unliquidated” under Article 439 of the Paraguayan Code of Civil

Procedure.”

BIVAC notes that Paraguay disputed the amount of the debt for the first time in its
Counter-Memorial, almost twelve years after the termination of the Contract and more
than three years after the arbitration commenced. In its Decision on Jurisdiction the
Tribunal noted that “Paraguay’s failure to challenge the level of indebtedness may
amount to an acknowledgment of such indebtedness.” BIVAC further submits that the
only document cited by Paraguay to support the argument that it disputed the debt is
Minister Doll’s telegram of 20 January 1999, and that this document does not specify
the documents or debts the Minister objected to, as required under Article 4.5 of the
Contract.” Moreover, no evidence prior or subsequent to Minister Doll’s telegram of
20 January 1999 validates such allegation. With regard to the argument that the claim
is “unliquidated” BIVAC submits that this argument does not detract from the
Government’s acceptance of the principal amounts due: the invoices have a clear face

value and the amount of the debt has been certified by the Ministry of Finance.”

66. The Respondent argues that BIVAC breached material provisions of the Contract.”

 

First, the Respondent contends that BIVAC impermissibly inspected Mercosur Goods
and charged Paraguay a fee for goods that were exempted from the inspection
programme.” BIVAC argues that not all goods originating in Mercosur countries were
exempt goods and not all goods shipped from a Mercosur country necessarily qualified
as originating from Mercosur, as they had to comply with applicable rules of origin.
According to BIVAC, such verification as to the “actual origin” of the goods could not
be ascertained without the documentation enclosed with the Certificate of Inspection.”
However, according to the Respondent, only few goods originating in Mercosur
countries were subject to import duties in Paraguay and BIVAC had the burden of
presenting evidence that the only Mercosur goods that it charged to inspect were those
few goods that were subject to duties. Moreover, the Respondent argues that inspection
by BIVAC of Mercosur goods was not permitted under the Treaty of Asuncién because
the responsibility to confirm the origin of such goods fell on the exporting State.”
Thus, by charging Paraguay to confirm the origin of goods already certified, BIVAC

imposed fees for work that had already been done.*”

67. Second, the Respondent contends that BIVAC impermissibly charged multiple

 

inspection fees for single inspections, by issuing multiple certificates of inspection on

a single commercial invoice to create more opportunities to charge the US$ 280
minimum inspection fee. According to the Respondent, charging to inspect each part
of a single shipment violated the applicable regulations, whether or not importers
requested such inspections. In the Respondent’s view, a “reasonable” reading of
Ministry Resolution 1171*! suggested two things: first, that partial shipments had to be
batched together for custom purposes so that an importer could not evade payment by

breaking orders into small, exempt shipments; and second, that although BIVAC

78 BIVAC explains that Article 1 of Resolution 1579, dated 10 September 1996, Exhibit CE-53, amended the list of goods
exempt from inspection, contained in Article 7 of Resolution No. 1171/96, dated 3 July 1996, Exhibit CE-51, to include “any
and all imports free and clear of duties or internal taxes, as described in general or special laws”. However, it did not establish
a blanket exemption on all Mercosur-origin goods, some of which continued to bear import duties. See BIVAC Reply, para.

should get paid if it was required to inspect small shipments, nothing indicated that
BIVAC should be paid a minimum fee for “each” such partial shipment, in which case

the Parties would have said so clearly.”

BIVAC has firmly denied all charges that it manipulated the inspection programme and
argues that it scrupulously followed Government regulations, as called for in its
Coordination Procedure.“ BIVAC argues that it could not have issued multiple
certificates of inspection when this was not called for as each certificate of inspection
had to relate to a shipment under a specific request for pre-shipment inspection filed
by the trader, and no more than one certificate could be issued per shipment. Thus,
each inspection attracted the minimum fee payable under the Contract because the
FOB value of each shipment was below the threshold value in the Contract and not

because of any form of manipulation by BIVAC.*

Finally, the Respondent argues that BIVAC failed to provide technical assi
training to the Paraguayan customs authorities and did not assist Paraguay to create a

database that would permit those authorities to eventually become self-sufficient, as

  

required under the Contract and in accordance with the WTO technical assistance
standards incorporated into the Contract. The Respondent also alleges that a report
from the Comptroller department shows that BIVAC had not held the required training

program.“ Moreover, the “loan” of a personal computer, printer and monitor,” together

 

with an invitation to a customs official to visit the Claimant’s offices in Ecuador and a

 

monthly shipment of disks containing extremely limited information did not discharge

the Claimant of its technical a:

 

istance obligations under the Contract.**

BIVAC denies any breach of Art. 2.9 and 2.10 of the Contract. It contends that the

submits that the National Customs Office has certified delivery of the computer and
the data, as required under Art. 2.10 of the Contract, and that the General Comptroller
of the Republic has investigated this issue and exonerated BIVAC.” BIVAC further
contends that it complied with all of its obligations under the Contract and that at no
point did Paraguay notify it of any breach under the Contract, nor did it take any action

for breach of the Contract against BIVAC.”'

4.1.4. The Alleged “Political Reasons” Motivating Paraguay’s Conduct

71.

72.

Paraguay contends that the non-payment of BIVAC’s invoices, the investigations into
the Contract, the commissions and reports were not politically motivated. Rather,
Paraguay argues that non-payment of BIVAC’s invoices was a “fiscal issue” and that

2

the poor health of the Paraguayan economy had to be taken into account.

BIVAC does not dispute that the period between 1997 and 2001 was economically
difficult for Paraguay, but it argues that in the absence of a defence of necessity under
international law, Paraguay is not exempted from its obligation under the Contract to

settle the debt.”

Moreover, BIVAC notes that Paraguay has not explained how the difficult fiscal
situation that existed between 1997 and 2001 could excuse the non-payment of the

debt after the economy began to recover in 2001.

4.1.5. Paraguay’s Alleged Dissatisfaction with the Contract

74,

75.

The Respondent argues that the Contract failed to bring a tangible economic benefit to
Paraguay, noting that the costs Paraguay incurred as a result of the Programme

exceeded the benefits it received in increased tax revenue.”

 

The Claimant submits that Paraguay’s dissatisfaction with the Contract is no defence to

Paraguay’s conduct and that no provision of the Contract provides that Paraguay could

 

withhold payment on that b: Moreover, the Claimant argues that this submission

 

lacks merit as the Tribunal had already found this argument to be unpersuasive at the

jurisdictional stage.”

The Respondent argues that the Tribunal should dis BIVAC’s claim for lack of

standing.”

The Respondent submits that Claimant has not met its burden of proof to establish its
standing to bring a claim under the Netherlands-Paraguay BIT. Specifically, it argues
that the Claimant has failed to establish that the contracting party is BIVAC BV, the

Dutch company, rather than BIVAC International, incorporated in France.**

To support its argument that BIVAC International — and not BIVAC BV -— is the party
in interest Paraguay asserts that (i) BIVAC International signed the Contract with the

Ministry of Finance;” (ii) the Ministry invited BIVAC International to submit its

involvement on the part of the Dutch government or its diplomats;'” (xii) finally, a
French Ministerial Memorandum described BIVAC International as the contractual

party.

According to the Respondent, the fact that BIVAC BV might have been the entity
through which BIVAC International intended to perform its obligations does not mean
that Paraguay granted BIVAC BV the right to perform inspection work under the
Contract. Those rights, which the Tribunal has held constituted an investment in its
Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction,"' were granted by Paraguay to BIVAC
International, not BIVAC BV, as evidenced by the Decree authorizing the Contract to

be concluded."*

solely to take advantage of the Netherlands-Paraguay BIT, the fact that the France-
Paraguay BIT did not contain an umbrella clause “could very well explain why

Claimant decided to file the arbitration demand in the name of BIVAC.”'*

Finally, the Respondent questions Mr. Bojanovich’s explanation that BIVAC, not
BIVAC International, is the affiliate in charge of government services. According to
the Respondent, it is clear from the BIVAC Group’s 2008 Annual Report'* that “the
parent company of both BIVAC International and BIVAC is Bureau Veritas Registre
ication de Navires et d’ Aéronefs (‘Registre’), not BIVAC S.A.”
and that “BIVAC International is the headquarters of the ‘GSIT business’, which

 

International de Clas

Respondent notes that “BIVAC does not appear as one of Registre’s principal

subsidiaries.'”

The Claimant argues that BIVAC BV was party to the Contract,''* as evidenced by: (i)
the cover page and the first provision of the Contract which both refer to the Contract
as “between the Ministry of Finance of the Government of the Republic of Paraguay
and Bureau Veritas, Inspection, Valuation, Assessment and Control, BIVAC BV”;"” (ii)
the first provision of the Contract which also specifies that “Bureau Veritas,
Inspection, Valuation, Assessment and Control, BIVAC B.V” is “a company
constituted under the laws of the Netherlands” and is referred to throughout the
Contract as “BIVAC”;'” (iii) the fact that “BIVAC” was represented for the purposes
of the Contract by Mr. Gilles Minard and Mr. Henri Pla,’' respectively the President

and Vice-President of BIVAC BV.’ According to the Claimant, the reference to
“BIVAC International” above the signatures of Messrs Minard and Pla™ is a “clerical
error” and the only other reference to “BIVAC International” in the Contract is the
address where notifications under the Contract should be sent’ and this does not make
“BIVAC International” a party to the Contract. Moreover, the Claimant notes that only
BIVAC BV could conceivably be the party referred to in the Contract as Bureau
Veritas Group party to the Contract, “since it was created by to act as the company of
the Group that would execute, perform and manage all pre-shipment inspection

29 135

contracts signed with States

The Claimant further argues that Paraguay’s commercial relationship was with BIVAC
BV™ and submits the following as evidence to this effect: (i) invoices for the services
provided to the Ministry of Finance under the Contract were issued by BIVAC BV;'”
(ii) letters from BIVAC to the Ministry of Finance stated that payments under the

Contract were to be made to a bank account held by “Bureau Veritas BIVAC BV”"*;

 

a security bond issued by Banco Sudameris Paraguay to the Ministry of Finance
“on behalf of the company BUREAU VERITAS, INSPECTION, VALUATION,

Contract;'” (iv) the Decree which authorized the Ministry of Finance to communicate
to “BIVAC BV” the intention of the Government not to extend the Contract beyond its
initial term pursuant to Clause 8.2 of the Contract; (v) the letter from the Ministry of
Finance addressed to “BIVAC BV” notifying the termination of the Contract;'*' and
(vi) the letter from the Ministry of Finance addressed to “BIVAC Paraguay S.A.”
which refers both to “the debt of the Ministry of Finance with the company BIVAC
BV” and to conversations held with “Mr Henri Pla, director of BIVAC BV”.'*

The Claimant argues that it is irrelevant that the initial Decree authorizing the Ministry
of Finance to contract pre-shipment inspection services refers to “BIVAC International

2133

(Bureau Veritas Group) of France’ as it was only a “logical starting point for
contacts” to refer to the more visible BIVAC parent company and to the Bureau Veritas

Group as a whole. It is also irrelevant, according to the Claimant, that the

  

“Coordination Procedure” of BIVAC Paraguay was

 

sued by BIVAC International, as
this document was prepared for “Bureau Veritas internal use” and “could not have any
effect vis-a-vis the Government let alone alter in any way the fact that the

Government’s contractual relationship was with BIVAC BV.”*

Moreover, the Claimant maintains that it is wrong to say that the Certificates of

Inspection were provided by “BIVAC International” and it explains the different steps

as

through which inspections were carried out.'* First, importers would lodge a “Request

  

136

for Pre-Shipment Inspection” form with one of BIVAC’s liaison offices in Paraguay.
These documents were then dispatched by BIVAC’s central liaison office in Asuncién
to the appropriate BIVAC Centre of Relation with Exporters (CRE) in the country of
export and to BIVAC’s central office in Rotterdam. The CRE in the country of export
would appoint an inspector who would carry out the physical inspection and submit his
conclusions to the CRE.'’ The CRE would then provide the exporter with a draft
Certificate of Inspection (carrying the letterhead “BIVAC International”), which would
be sent internally to BIVAC Paraguay. BIVAC Paraguay would then verify the
information contained therein and provide a final Certificate of Inspection to the
importers and the Paraguayan authorities.'* Thus, the Claimant contends that the
company responsible for the Certificate of Inspection was BIVAC Paraguay, BIVAC

BV’s liaison office in Paraguay.

Finally, the Claimant notes that Dutch investors’ rights to arbitrate disputes under the

Treaty are not conditioned upon their government assisting in the resolution of the

w

dispute. Thus, the fact that “there is no record of any involvement on the part of the

Dutch Government or its diplomats”, as alleged by Respondent, is irrelevant.'”

The Claimant also notes that despite the Tribunal’s invitation in its Decision on
Objections to Jurisdiction that Paraguay provide additional evidence to establish that
BIVAC lacks standing, Paraguay has provided no such additional evidence in its

Counter-Memorial."”

For all these reasons, the Claimant contends that Paraguay’s ius standi argument

should be dismissed.
The Tribunal’s Reasoning and Decision

In its Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, the Tribunal decided to join to the merits
the issue of BIVAC’s standing to bring the claim in order to allow both Parties the

opportunity to present their arguments because it was raised at a late stage by the

Respondent, some three weeks after the hearing on jurisdiction."

In order to fa

 

itate and orient the Parties’ arguments, the Tribunal had already set out

its perception of the facts and law based on the evidence available to it before the

12

Decision was rendered. The relevant passage is set out for convenience:

“(1) It has not been contested that the BIVAC Group operates in several
countries, where it has established companies, including France and the
Netherlands, and that the French company (BIVAC S.A.) is the headquarters
and parent company. The Dutch affiliate of BIVAC was founded in 1984, as a
B.V. On the basis of the information on the record, it fulfils the requirements
of being a juridical person having the nationality of the Netherlands, within
the meaning of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. No evidence has
been put before us to indicate that the Dutch entity was created to take
advantage of a favourable Netherlands-Paraguay BIT, although this point was
alluded to in the Respondent's letter of 5 December 2008. The evidence
before us indicates when the Contract was concluded, Mr. Gilles Minard was
the Executive Director of BIVAC B.V. (a post which apparently shared with
his position as President of BIVAC International/France). It has not been

contested that the Paraguayan Presidential Decree No. 12.311, which
authorized the Ministry of Finance to enter into contracts with SGS and with
BIVAC, refers to BIVAC International (Group Bureau Veritas) of France. It
has also not been contested that the cover page of the Contract refers to
BIVAC BY, that the Contract states in the opening that the Contract is
concluded between the Minister of Finance and BIVAC B.V. (“a company
constituted under the laws of the Netherlands”), and that the Contract
determines that this company is “hereinafter called “BIVAC’” (although it
also refers in the same Article to the Presidential Decree and to “BIVAC
International (Bureau Veritas Group) of France”).

(2) The parties apparently disagree on whether the Contract was signed on
behalf of BIVAC International S.A. (France) or BIVAC B.V. (Netherlands).
The documents are far from clear. The signatures are placed under the words
“BIVAC International” and the postal address refers to BIVAC International,
in France. On the other hand, the commercial register of Rotterdam in The
Netherlands identifies one of the signatories, Mr. Gilles Minard, as executive
director of BIVAC B.V. (Netherlands) and the notarial deed of 29 April 1996,
established in Asuncién and attached to the Contract, certifies a power of
attorney for Mr. Henri Pla to act and sign on behalf of BIVAC B.V.
(Netherlands). The authenticity of these documents has not been challenged.

(3) The documentation is — to say the least - far from being entirely
consistent. The documents presently before us do not allow us to determine
exactly which of the two legal entities is to be identified as the party to the
Contract with the Ministry of Finance. This may serve to distinguish the
present situation with that which pertained in ICSID Case No. ARB/03/08
(LE.S.I. v Algeria), on which Paraguay relies, where the identities of the
signatories to the contract differed from that of the Claimant.

(4) It follows that evidence beyond the documents is needed to determine
with greater certainty the party in interest. This evidence appears to be
available in the related circumstances concerning the parties in relation to and
under the Contract. The evidence put before us shows that: (a) the initial
security bond was issued on behalf of BIVAC B.V.; (b) BIVAC B.V. rendered
the pre-shipment inspection technical services and invoiced the Ministry of
Finance, which then made payments to a Bank account in the name of BIVAC
B.V.; (c) the termination of the Contract was notified to BIVAC B.V.; and (d)
in the course of these proceedings Paraguay did not invoke this standing issue
until after the hearing on jurisdiction, even though it was previously aware of
the economic links between BIVAC S.A. and BIVAC B.V. (in a letter dated 4
December 2007, for example, Paraguay rejected ICSID’s proposal that a
French national be President of the Tribunal because the “Claimant is an
entity established under the laws of the Netherlands but with very close ties to
France by the fact that it is completely owned by the Bureau Veritas Group
whose centre is in Paris” (Tribunal’s translation). These factors are evidenced
by the documents before us. Both parties have acted under the Contract in a
manner that demonstrates (implicitly at least) that they considered BIVAC
B.V. to be the contracting party.

(5) There appears to be no dispute between the parties that, unless otherwise
agreed, the nationality of a legal entity is not determined by who controls it,
but by its place of incorporation. Article 25(2)(b) ICSID Convention defines
“national of another Contracting State” to mean any juridical person which
has the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the
dispute. Case law and commentary are clear in their support for the
proposition that States have a broad discretion to define corporate nationality,
for instance for the purposes of a BIT. The BIT in this case does so by
specifying in its Article 1(b)(ii) that “nationals” of either Contracting Party

31

OL.

92.

94.

comprise “legal persons constituted under the law of that Contracting Party”,
which indicates that no test of corporate control is required. On the basis of
the limited evidence that has been put before us so far, it appears that
Paraguay’s argument may prove to be difficult to sustain. The documentary
material appears to show quite clearly that both parties acted on the basis that
the Claimant was the contracting partner, even if two entities (the Claimant
and BIVAC S.A. (France)) may have been involved in aspects of the
Contract. If Paraguay decides to maintain this argument it will have to
provide additional evidence to establish that BIVAC lacks standing to bring
these proceedings.”
The evidence that has been presented to the Tribunal since it rendered its Decision on

Objections to Jurisdiction has not clarified the picture any further.

It is still uncontested that the BIVAC Group operates (and has established companies
in) several countries, including France and the Netherlands, and that the French S.A. is
the headquarters and the parent company. The fact that the French President has
intervened in favour of the group does not imply that the Claimant is French, nor does
the non-intervention by Dutch political authorities imply that it is not Dutch. The
intervention or non-intervention indicates a difference in the political culture of
different countries but does not determine the legal reality of different members within
a group of companies.

The Dutch BIVAC was founded in 1984 as a BV and it fulfils the requirements of
being a juridical person having the nationality of the Netherlands, as set out in Article
25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. The fact it was constituted in 1984 clearly
demonstrates that it was not established with the aim to profit from the favourable
Dutch-Paraguayan BIT only after the dispute had arisen. At the time of the conclusion
of the Contract, Mr. Gilles Minard was the executive director of BIVAC BV (a post
which he held whilst simultaneously acting as President of BIVAC International). In

that context the Tribunal notes the view advanced by one commentator :

“A putative investor can structure its investment through a company having
the nationality of a state which has an investment treaty with the host state of
the planned investment. This is an example of an investment treaty
performing its stated purpose; viz. to attract foreign capital: There cannot,
however, be a restructuring of the investment in order to resort to the dispute
resolution provisions of an investment treaty once a dispute has arisen. Treaty
shopping is acceptable, forum shopping is not.”!“?

The fact that international groups of companies put in place different strategies and

32

95.

96.

legal structures cannot of itself be considered to be inappropriate or even illegitimate,
and cannot as such justify any suspicions of a hidden agenda as to a future litigation
strategy, as alleged by Respondent'*

The evidence establishes that the Paraguayan Presidential Decree No. 12311 dated 31
January 1996 authorized the Ministry of Finance to enter into contracts with SGS and
with BIVAC and specified BIVAC International (Group Bureau Veritas) of France. It is
undisputed that the Contract mentions on its cover page BIVAC BV and states in its
first Article that the Contract is concluded between the Minister of Finance and BIVAC
BV “a company constituted under the laws of the Netherlands” and determines that
this company is “hereinafter called “BIVAC’”, only to refer in the same Article to the
Presidential Decree and “BIVAC International (Bureau Veritas Group) of France”.

What is disputed is whether the Contract was signed on behalf of BIVAC International

 

or on behalf of BIVAC BV. The relevant documents are not dispositive. The signatures
to the Contract appear under “BIVAC International” and the postal address referred to
is that of BIVAC International in France. On the other hand, the Rotterdam
commercial register identifies one of the signatories, Mr. Gilles Minard, as executive
director of BIVAC BV and the notarial deed of 29 April 1996, established in Asuncién
and attached to the Contract, certifies a power of attorney for Mr. Henri Pla to act and
sign on behalf of BIVAC BV. Neither the existence nor the legality of these documents

are denied.

As it has been presented by the Parties, the documentation does not allow for the
Tribunal to determine with any degree of certitude which of the two legal entities is to
be identified as the contracting party. The Tribunal is required to go further to
determine the identity of the party in interest. The Tribunal must look to the
circumstances and effective conduct of both parties during the performance of the
Contract. Such conduct is reflected inter alia in the following facts: the initial security
bond was issued on behalf of BIVAC BV; BIVAC BV rendered the pre-shipment
inspection technical services and invoiced the Ministry of Finance which in turn made
payments to a Bank account held by BIVAC BY; the termination of the Contract was
notified to BIVAC BV; in the course of the arbitral proceedings Respondent has not

evoked the lack of standing in a substantiated way until after the hearing on

 

‘37. Douglas, The International Law of Investment Claims, Cambridge University Press, 2009, para. 542.

33

97.

98.

jurisdiction although it was aware of the economic links between BIVAC International
and BIVAC BV-: in its letter dated 4 December 2007 with regard to the constitution of
the Arbitral Tribunal, Paraguay had rejected a French national as President of the
Tribunal because “Claimant is an entity established under the laws of the Netherlands
but with very close ties to France by the fact that it is completely owned by the Bureau

Veritas Group whose centre is in Paris” ( Tribunal's translation).'°

The facts lead the Tribunal to conclude without any difficulty that from the conclusion
of the Contract until the Respondent’s letter dated 5 December 2008 challenging the
Claimant’s standing for the first time, both parties had acted in full knowledge of the
fact that two legal entities existed.“° On the Respondent’s side, this knowledge was
common and not reserved to one Ministry. In view of this knowledge and the parties’
conduct throughout the contractual relation, as evidenced by the documentation, the
Tribunal is confident to state that both BIVAC and Paraguay have — at least implicitly

— considered BIVAC BV to be the contracting party.

These facts and arguments remove the ambiguity which emerge from the Contractual
documents to such a degree as to allow the Tribunal to rule that the Claimant is the
correct party in interest. Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant has

standing to bring the claim, and there is no other bar to its doing so.

4.3. The Alleged Violation of the Clause on Fair and Equitable Treatment and its
Consequences

99.

100.

Article 3(1) of the BIT reads:

“Each Contracting Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment of the
investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party and shall not impair,
by unreasonable or discriminatory measures, the operation, management,
maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal thereof by those nationals.”

In its Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, the Tribunal concluded that it had

jurisdiction in relation to the claim made under Article 3(1) of the BIT and that the

 

"4 Supra, para. 77.

34

claim was admi:

 

ible. The Tribunal made a number of observations, and these are here

set out for convenience:

“In these circumstances, it appears at this preliminary stage of the
proceedings that there is no apparent unresolved dispute as to the amount
payable. Accordingly, we conclude that it would not be premature to come to
a decision on the merits of the claim under Article 3(1) of the BIT, at least in
so far as the claim relates to acts attributable to Paraguay in relation to the
failure to make payments owing under the Contract. In reaching this
conclusion, we wish to make clear that we express no view whatsoever on the
merits of the case. In particular, our finding as to jurisdiction should not be
taken to reflect any view, even provisional in nature, as to whether a
persistent failure to make payment on an outstanding debt, however
unreasonable or unwarranted, could of itself ever amount to a violation of the
obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment in circumstances in which a
contractually agreed remedy remains available. In this regard, we note that in
Impregilo SpA v Pakistan (...) the tribunal made the following point in
relation to the interplay between treaty claims and contract claims, of
considerable pertinence also for the present case:

‘In order that the alleged breach of contract may constitute a violation of the
BIT, it must be the result of behaviour going beyond that which an ordinary
contracting party could adopt. Only the State in the exercise of its sovereign
authority (‘puissance publique’), and not as a contracting party, may breach
the obligations assumed under the BIT. In other words, the investment
protection treaty only provides a remedy to the investor where the investor
proves that the alleged damages were a consequence of the behaviour of the
Host State acting in breach of the obligations it had assumed under the treaty.”

Applying this standard, in order to succeed in a claim alleging violation of
Article 3(1) of the BIT, BIVAC would have to meet a threshold for treaty
claims that requires it to establish acts by or attributable to Paraguay that
show an act of ‘puissance publique’, that is to say ‘activity beyond that of an
ordinary contracting party’.

The fundamental basis of the claim under Article 3(1) of the BIT, over which
this Tribunal has jurisdiction, turns on the interpretation and application of
that provision and alleged acts of Paraguay (as ‘puissance publique’), not on
the interpretation and application of the Contract as such, although the
Contract will necessarily be part of the overall factual and legal matrix.
Moreover, the interpretation of Article 3(1) of the BIT is not a matter over
which the courts of Asuncién would be able to exercise jurisdiction under
Article 9 of the Contract. The issue of fair and equitable treatment, and
related matters, was not one which the parties to the Contract agreed to refer
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Asuncién. The treaty issue is
therefore not one for that forum, and there can be no question of an
independent or self-standing treaty claim over which we have jurisdiction
being inadmissible by reason of the choice of forum for the resolution of a
dispute under the Contract.”!4’

“© Paraguay letter to the Tribunal, dated 5 December 2008.
‘47 Tribunal’s Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, paras. 125 and 127.

35

101. The Claimant submits that Paraguay has breached Article 3(1) of the Treaty. It alleges
that the applicable fair and equitable treatment standard is high (4.3.1.1) and that
Paraguay has failed to ensure fair and equitable treatment of BIVAC’s investment
through arbitrariness, lack of transparency and due process, negligence and
inconsistency, bad faith, repudiation of the debt and breach of legitimate expectations
(4.3.1.2). It insists that Paraguay’s conduct was unfair and inequitable because it was

an abuse of governmental power, or ‘puissance publique’ (4.3.1.3). It also rts that

 

Paraguay has impaired BIVAC’s investment with unreasonable measures (4.3.1.4).
Moreover, the Claimant disputes Paraguay’s submission that BIVAC is compelled to
go before Paraguayan courts (4.3.1.5). Finally, the Claimant submits that Paraguay’s
breach of Article 3(1) caused BIVAC’s losses (4.3.1.6) and that Paraguay thus owes
BIVAC full compensation (4.3.1.7).'*

4.3.1.1. The Treaty Standard of Fair and Equitable Treatment

102. The Claimant contends that the fair and equitable treatment (“FET”) standard is a high
and flexible standard which offers crucial protection for investors in a variety of
situations in which State conduct may be regarded as unfair or inequitable in the
context of investment relations.'” It notes that the “fundamental importance” of the
FET standard is directly recognized in the Netherland-Paraguay BIT as it is even
referred to in the preamble, which reads:

“[...] Recognizing that agreement upon the treatment to be accorded to such
investments will stimulate the flow of capital and technology and the

economic development of the Contracting Parties and that fair and equitable
treatment of investment is desirable [...]”!™?

103. According to the Claimant, the Treaty has thus established “an independent, self-
contained treaty standard’'*' which gives latitude to arbitral tribunals to assess the
fairness or unfairness of State conduct in a particular case in light of all the

circumstances.

treatment standard impos

 

a standard of conduct on the host State “beyond that of the
international minimum standard”,'* without requiring that the conduct to constitute
“outrageous” or “egregious”'® or that the State has acted in bad faith or with malicious
intent.'° In the Claimant’s view, the fair and equitable treatment standard must be
interpreted in connection with the purpose of relevant BIT and requires host States to
be proactive in the protection of investments and not to act improperly or discreditably
in ways that provide disincentives to foreign investors.'” The fair and equitable
treatment standard “allows for justice to be done in the absence of the more traditional

breaches of international law standards”.'**

105. The Claimant argues that fair and equitable treatment under Article 3(1) of the Treaty
does not incorporate only the international “minimum standard of treatment” under
customary international law, as Paraguay argues. Not only does Article 3(1) not make
any reference to customary international law or to the international minimum standard
of treatment, but Paraguay has not cited a single award to support its interpretation.'”

took office in August 1998 and Minister of Finance Gerhard Doll instigated a number of
investigations into the manner in which the previous regime had entered into the Contract;
Payments for services under the Contract from that moment on were completely withheld;

In response to requests for payment by BIVAC, on 21 January 1999 Minister Doll objected
to all of the invoices on the basis of unspecified breaches of the Contract;

In the meetings that followed, the Minister of Finance did not explain how or when
BIVAC had failed to observe its obligations under the Contract;

In complete contradiction, in early March 1999, a number of invoices dating back to 1997
were paid. This was the last payment that BIVAC received;

On 19 February 1999 Presidential Decree No. 2003 was passed authorising the Ministry of
Finance to discontinue the Contract upon termination of its initial term;

In June 1999, the new Minister of Finance Federico Zayas acknowledged the State’s
obligation to pay the debt to BIVAC;

On 6 August 1999, the Ministry of Finance compiled the list of the nineteen outstanding
invoices owed to BIVAC;

Immediately after the termination of the Contract, on 14 June 1999 Minister Zayas
responded to BIVAC’s request for payment by proposing a discount of 50% of the pending
debt;

Following meetings in July 1999 Minister Zayas put forward a different proposal: paying
BIVAC’s debt in Government bonds;

Despite all this, on 2 December 1999 Minister Zayas indicated that the debt could not be
paid until the Contraloria completed its ‘Special Investigation’, which had started a year
before and of which BIVAC had never been informed;

On 13 December 1999, Minister Zayas wrote to BIVAC raising a different ground for non-
payment: that the debt could not be paid until the National Congress passed a law
authorizing payment;

The contents of the correspondence exchanged between BIVAC and the Ministry were
subsequently leaked to the press;

In June 2000, the Legal Department of the Ministry of Finance concluded a review and
found that there had been no proved irregularities in the Certificates of Pre-Shipment
Inspection issued by BIVAC;

The Ministry of Finance nonetheless recommended that the General Customs Office
conduct an audit of BIVAC’s compliance with the Contract;

In September 2000, Minister Zayas stated in the press that the debt with BIVAC and SGS
had been invalidly assumed by the Wasmosy Government;

On 12 February 2001, the legal department of the Ministry of Finance prepared an internal
opinion for the new Minister Oviedo Britez noting that the debt was legitimate and should
be paid after the Contralorfa’s investigation;

The following day, new Minister Oviedo Britez wrote to BIVAC noting that the debt was

39

payable and the investigation would be accelerated;

Following meetings with BIVAC’s representatives, Minister Oviedo Britez agreed to make
a partial payment during the 2001 fiscal year of approximately US$5.4 million, and to pay
the remainder of the debt in 2002;

Shortly thereafter, the Ministry prepared to include the amount of the debt in the State
budget;

In complete contradiction on 31 July 2001 Minister Oviedo Britez announced to the press
that he would not pay given that the legality of the Contract had been put in doubt by a
report of the Contralorfa, and added to his objection that the issue ‘related to a contract
that was entered into by former governments’;

The Contraloria report had been issued on 25 July 2001, but had not been communicated
to BIVAC. The report concluded that BIVAC had failed to comply with several provisions
of the Contract;

Only upon request by BIVAC, the Ministry sent the ‘final’ report of the Contraloria dated
July 2001, together with two other reports of which BIVAC had no knowledge: a ‘final’
report dated February 1999, followed by another report in 2000;

All three reports concluded for different, contradictory and extremely formalistic reasons
that the Contract was somehow invalid or that BIVAC had not complied with its terms;

On 17 August 2001, the legal department of the Ministry of Finance reported to the
Minister of Finance noting the contradictions between the Contralorfa’s reports and the
upholding the validity of the Contract;

In spite of the response to the reports provided by BIVAC, and the legal department's
opinion, shortly afterwards BIVAC became aware that, far from being brought to a close,
the investigations into the validity and performance of the Contract were being escalated
to the criminal courts;

In May 2002, newly appointed Minister Spalding decided to reopen the investigations of
the Contraloria;

While the Contralorfa’s investigations were starting afresh, BIVAC became aware that
parallel investigations were being carried out by the General Customs Office, which were
commenced four years earlier;

In June 2002, the General Customs Office issued a certificate confirming that it had
received no complaints regarding the performance of the Contract;

In July 2002, the General Customs Office issued Resolution 113 definitively ending its
investigations;

On 4 October 2002, the Contralorfa issued its ‘final’ report (third final report, considering
the previous two final reports of February 1999 and July 2001), fully vindicating BIVAC’s
position. In spite of this no payment occurred ;

On 27 November 2002, the Minister wrote to BIVAC confirming that a working group

would soon be formed with the Ministry of Finance ‘to jointly study the best course of

40

action to be followed in order to respond to your company’s claim’;

In December 2002, the Public Prosecutor concluded that the criminal complaint that was
pending against BIVAC’s representatives was baseless;

On 30 December 2002, a Criminal Court Judge endorsed the findings of the Public
Prosecutor and rejected the complaint against BIVAC’s representatives;

In plain contradiction with all this, in January 2003 the newly appointed Minister Alcides
Jiménez opened yet another new investigation into the Contract;

On 28 January 2003 a two page report of the Ministry concluded that the contracts had
‘notoriously prejudiced the State’ and that the auditors had come to a ‘negative opinion as
to the implementation of the [inspection] system’. Minister Alcides Jiménez did nothing
else during his tenure;

In August 2003, the newly elected President Duarte Frutos appointed a new Minister of
Finance, Dionisio Borda. Two months later, on 1 October 2003, BIVAC discovered that
Minister Borda was questioning in the press the legitimacy of the debt to BIVAC;

In plain contradiction, when BIVAC’s representatives met with the Vice-Minister of
Finance Miguel Gomez on 8 October 2003, they were reassured that the new
administration would honour the Paraguayan State’s pending obligations to BIVAC;

In subsequent meetings with BIVAC’s representatives in November 2003, the Vice-
Minister confirmed that the Ministry was considering the modalities for the payment of
the debt;

Following some meetings in March 2004, on 19 April 2004 the Vice-Minister of Finance
wrote to BIVAC that the Ministry wished to ‘honour debts owed by the Paraguayan State
to its various creditors, which include [BIVAC]’ and that a study was being finalised in
order to establish a schedule of payments;

In direct contradiction the Ministry of Finance issued Resolution No. 274 in June 2004,
opening yet a new investigation into the Contract noting that the Ministry had ‘not yet
determined whether BIVAC and SGS had complied with the contract’, and establishing a
‘Commission for the Review and Negotiation of the Debt with the Companies BIVAC and
SGS’;

No report was issued by the Commission by the deadline of 3 September 2004;

On 25 February 2005, the Commission that had been created by Resolution No. 274
concluded that it had no competence to decide on the matter;

On 3 February 2005, the Ministry of Finance issued Resolution No. 43, cancelling
Resolution No. 274 and designating the National Customs Office as the body in charge of
establishing ‘whether or not the payment of the debt for the contracted inspection services
with the companies BIVAC and SGS is in order’;

The National Customs Office rendered its conclusions on 30 March 2005, stating that
BIVAC’s performance of the Contract had been investigated several times and concluded

that BIVAC had fully complied with the Contract, and that there was therefore nothing

else to investigate, saying emphatically that ‘what we are attempting to investigate is a
matter that has already been decided’;

However, the Minister of Finance did not inform BIVAC that the investigation had been
concluded, nor did it provide BIVAC with a copy of the conclusions of the National
Customs Office, despite its request following reports of the conclusions in the press.
Paraguay persisted in its failure to pay;

In May 2005, incredibly Minister Borda issued a press release stating that it had launched
a new investigation into the pending debt with BIVAC. Minister Bergen replaced Borda at
the end of that month;

Between August and November of 2005 officials within the Ministry of Finance explained
on various occasions, including to the press, that the new team within the Ministry of
Finance had only recently been formed and that it would need to understand and analyse
the complex issue of the payment of the debt to BIVAC;

Press reports announced that the funds necessary to pay the debt to BIVAC had been
provided for in the State budget and some meetings to discuss the payment of the debt
took place in April 2006;

However, in his trip to France in May 2006 President Duarte declared to the press that the
Government would not ‘pay any debt which [was] not clear’, and that BIVAC's case

would be submitted to yet further review by the Contraloria and the Paraguayan Congress;

 

By Decree 10485 of 22 June 2007, and as if nothing had happened in over eight years,
President Duarte Frutos ordered yet another review of the Contract and the pending

debt.”!

The Claimant argues that Paraguay does not deny these actions and has not submitted
a single document in support of its conduct. According to the Claimant, “[nJothing in

more concerned with delay than BIVAC’s performance).'”°

In light of these facts, the Claimant submits that Paraguay’s conduct amounts to a clear
violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard which is made up of the
following components: non arbitrariness (4.3.1.2.1); transparency and due process
(4.3.1.2.2); diligence and consistency (4.3.1.2.3); and good faith (4.3.1.2.4). The
Claimant also argues that the fair and equitable treatment standard prohibits the
repudiation of the debt (4.3.1.2.5) and that Paraguay has breached its legitimate
expectations (4.3.1.2.6).'

4.3.1.2.1. Arbitrariness

The Claimant submits that international tribunals have defined arbitrary conduct as “a
willful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a
sense of juridical propriety’; a measure “not founded on reason or fact [...] but on
mere fear reflecting national preference”'”*; the lack of explanation of alleged failures
to comply with contractual obligations’; “[dJecisions that were taken without

be recognized “by any reasonable and impartial man”.'*!

According to the Claimant, Paraguay’s conduct was arbitrary, capricious and
unrestrained. The commissioning of endless reports on the same issue and the decision
not to pay a recognized debt was “without cause based on law” and was not based on

any genuine belief of possible wrongdoing by BIVAC. The Claimant explains:

“This case law all supports BIVAC. Here Paraguay in an impressive
succession of contradictory acts and omissions over ten years has failed to

pay to BIVAC for political reasons, linked to the general distrust by
Governments and Ministers of the acts of their predecessors. Paraguay never
communicated what it was doing to BIVAC. It never explained the real
motivation for the non-payment. This in itself constitutes arbitrary conduct.
Further, it is clear that decisions were not taken on objective or reasonable
grounds, nor on the basis of a real disagreement with BIVAC over contract
performance or the obligation to pay.

[el

Paraguay’s refusal to comply with its obligations towards BIVAC’s
investment is demonstrably without any objective grounds. After lengthy and
repetitive administrative processes, various administrative agencies and
organs of the Paraguayan state have all concluded that Paraguay should
honour the Contract and pay the debt. But the Executive power has not
complied with these decisions. Following the holding in RFCC above,
Paraguay has acted unilaterally and arbitrarily and without any justification.
L...] Further, there is no contractual disagreement between the parties here,
either factual or legal; nor is there a normal contractual dispute between
BIVAC and Paraguay. What there is here is a completely unjustified and
willful disregard by Paraguay of its obligations after engaging in an attempt
to escape its obligations by setting in motion its own administrative
structure.”

The Claimant further refutes the reasons put forward by Paraguay to justify its
conduct.’* First, the Claimant argues that Paraguay is wrong in saying that the
“commissions and reports were only internal reports that did not impair BIVAC’s
rights in any way”. According to the Claimant, “the spurious commissions and reports
are part of the arbitrary conduct because they caused deliberate delay and their

repetition and reiteration betray a lack of due process and lack of regard for juridical

 

propriety.” Second, Paraguay’s

 

ssertion that “BIVAC ignores the economic reality of
the Contract, which cost Paraguay more than it was able to recover in taxes” is also
wrong because “the assertion that a contracting party may ignore its contractual
obligations because it later considers them a bad bargain is contrary to the most
elemental principles of law and justice” and “is per se arbitrary.” Third, contrary to
Paraguay’s view that “BIVAC ignores the undisputed evidence that BIVAC did not
comply with its contractual obligations”, the Claimant contends that “there is no
evidence that BIVAC fell short of its contractual obligations” and that “[iJn fact, the
evidence demonstrates the opposite”. Finally, the Claimant argues that it is wrong to
allege that “BIVAC’s arbitrariness claim is immaterial insofar as no one ever stopped

Claimant, “any role for the courts of Asuncién is immaterial to BIVAC’s claim.

4,3.1.2.2. Lack of Transparency and Due Process

vis

113. The Claimant submits that lack of transparency occurs when “arguments [are] made to

justify delay in paying compensation without basis in the Contract or Decree”, or

when the Government fails “to allow [the claimant] to understand exactly what the

Government’s preconditions for an acceptable solution were,” or when it “fail[s] to

respond in any constructive way” and generally acts inconsistently “instead of

engaging in meaningful negotiations.

27186

114. The Claimant submits that the conduct of the Paraguayan Government with regards to

the BIVAC debt is a model of lack of transparency and due proce:

 

“While several Ministers of Finance assured BIVAC time and again that the
debt would be paid, thus acknowledging the obligation to pay and the
legitimacy of the debt, behind the scenes reports, reviews, investigations,
enquiries, and the like were being commissioned to do exactly the opposite.
BIVAC was never informed of the commencement of these processes, let
alone their evolution and outcomes. Most of the time BIVAC learned about
them through the press. BIVAC was never requested to participate.

 

Similar to the Saluka case, Paraguay did not allow BIVAC to understand the
Government's position and the allegations and suspicions leveled at the
Contract and the debt. Following Tecmed, Paraguay’s lack of transparency
suggests that the real discreditable reason for the Government’s conduct was
not to take responsibility for the debt and the self-interested political reasons
of each Minister and Government. These are clear deficiencies that conflict
with what a reasonable and unbiased observer would consider fair and

45187
equitable.

115. The Claimant further notes that Paraguay has not provided any official reason for its

default on the debt except for the arguments provided for the first time in its Counter-

Memorial.

{hereinafter,

116.

The Claimant submits that the facts in the present case are very similar to those in

'® Where the Tribunal found that the State had breached the fair and

Kardassopoulos,
equitable treatment standard through its repeated inconsistencies in the manner it had

addressed the investor’s

   

claim for payment. The Claimant explai:

 

“Those inconsistencies were manifest in the following facts: the ‘circular
response’ to the investor and its claim; the changing government attitudes
towards resolving the issue; the ‘lengthy delays, refusals by various
government officials to address the matter’; the ‘internal disputes over who
carried responsibility for the matter’; ‘responsibility for [the investor's]
claim was shuffled from one government ministry to another, without any
progress’; that when ‘a new government was elected [...] yet another State
commission established to consider the matter of [the investor's] claims’; all
the while ‘the evidence discloses that senior members of the Georgian
Government believed that [...] compensation was owed to [the investor]."”'”

 

On the basis

 

of other arbitral awards, |”! the Claimant further submits that there has
been “evident negligence on the part of the administration in the handling” of the debt
issue; a “roller coaster” of unimagined proportions;'” that the varying, sometimes
“even contradictory positions” by the government “made it difficult or even impossible
for [the Claimant] to accommodate their proposals to the Government’s position”;'*

that there was a “lack of orderly process and timely disposition in relation to an

 

investor of a Party acting in the expectation that it would be treated fairly and justly”;'*

and that the Government’s actions were incoherent and lacked forthrightness.'°°

4.3.1.2.4. Bad Faith

117.

The The Claimant argues that in addition to the Respondent’s arbitrariness, lack of
transparency, negligence, inconsistency and repudiation of the debt, “Paraguay’s use of
its governmental machinery to orchestrate repeated and baseless investigations into the

Contract and the debt”'’® amounts to bad faith and thus to a breach of the fair and

equitable treatment standard.” According to the Claimant, tribunals have recognized

that bad faith is a sufficient — but not a nec

 

ary — requirement for a breach of the fair
and equitable standard.'** The Claimant recognizes that the legal threshold for proving
bad faith under international law may be high, but in the Claimant’s view, there is no

doubt that Paraguay’s conduct crossed that bar.

118. The Claimant describes the facts evidencing bad faith and abuse of authority as

follow:

 

“Absent any basis to deny payment (in spite of numerous attempts to do so),
Paraguay’s attempt to create difficulties for paying the debt, by using its
administrative agencies and review powers smacks of bad faith. None of the
instances of investigations into the Contract and the debt, all of which were
favourable to BIVAC, led to the logical result: payment. Hence those review
exercises were not carried out in good faith, to ascertain whether payment
was due. Had there been good faith, there would not have been necessary to
repeat the reviews continuously — one would have been sufficient. Once again
those reviews had other more obscure and discreditable motivations, based on
real or perceived political necessity. Thus Paraguay acted in bad faith and in
abuse of its sovereign authority in ordering various governmental authorities
ad nauseam, when the State had already concluded that the debt was due.”

119. The Claimant further contends that Paraguay’s defense that it h:

 

s not acted in bad faith
because it “has disputed the debt” is unsupported by the evidence, which clearly shows

that Paraguay has never disputed the debt.

4,3.1.2.5. The Alleged Repudiation of the Debt

120. The Claimant contends that Paraguay’s arbitrary and inconsistent conduct can only be

 

interpreted a repudiation of the debt by Paraguay." Following the tribunal’s

language in Eureko,” the Respondent argues that there was a “clear decision” by

Paraguay “to refuse to abide by and respect its legal obligations” under the Contract,
thus “frustrat[ing] the investment” for which Paraguay is responsible under the Treaty.
According to the Claimant, Paraguay chose to avoid responsibility for the debt due to

“self-interested political motivations of each successive Minister and government”.””

 

BIVAC refutes Paraguay’s arguments that the Claimant cannot maintain its complaint

 

because “political continuity cannot be dealt with in a vacuum” and that “BIVAC was
well aware of the political volatility in Paraguay at the time of the Contract”.“. The
Claimant adds:

“The assertion that BIVAC should have ‘known better’ in contracting with
Paraguay cynically seeks to allocate to investors the risk that successive
governments in Paraguay would repudiate their predecessor's lawfully
contracted pecuniary obligations. There is no such ‘political volatility’
exception to international obligations.

Paraguay cannot be heard to excuse its repudiatory conduct because it is an
unreliable State, incapable of keeping its promises. But by voicing these
excuses, Paraguay is unequivocally illustrating that this case is not one of
pure contractual breach, but rather primarily concerns politically motivated
treatment of BIVAC that is far from fair or equitable.”””>

4,3.1.2.6. Frustration of Legitimate Expectations

122.

According to the Claimant it “had a right under the FET standard and the principle of
good faith that its investment would be treated in accordance with its legitimate
expectations” and that these expectations have been violated, amounting to a breach of
Paraguay’s obligation of fair and equitable treatment under Article 3(1) of the

Treaty. "206

According to the Claimant, Paraguay misstates that BIVAC’s sole
legitimate expectation is that of payment. Adopting the approach of the tribunal in
Kardassopoulos, the Claimant argues that the Treaty protects BIVAC’s expectation of
consistent, transparent, reasonable, non-arbitrary and good faith treatment from

207

Paraguay. As stated in Kardassopoulos,*” the FET treatment protection includes:

“[T]he legitimate expectation that [the State] would conduct itself vis-a-vis
this investment in a manner that was reasonably justifiable and did not

manifestly violate basic requirements of consistency, transparency, even-
handedness and nondiscrimination. This includes, in the view of the Tribunal,
implementing a compensation process [...] that is both procedurally and
substantively fair.”

4.3.1.3. The Alleged Governmental (Non-Commercial) Conduct and its Abuse

123.

124.

The Claimant argues that its claim is based on Paraguay’s “politically motivated”**
violation of its obligation to ensure FET treatment by using its “sovereign prerogatives
and authority to evade its obligation to pay the debt”.*” According to the Claimant, its
claim is not based on a “simple breach of Contract”,’’ nor on Paraguay’s commercial
conduct and not even on “‘a formal attempt to nullify or set aside a contract debt”,*"' as
these “are purely contractual matters” and do not qualify as breaches of the Treaty.?”
The Claimant asks whether “the persistent refusal to pay in good faith, because the

tribunal said you have good reasons not to, is that a breach of the treaty? And the
answer, of course, is no [...]”2"

“The key distinction at the heart of this case lies in determining whether the
parties to a State contract are engaged in a genuine difference of opinion in
respect of the scope or interpretation of their respective contractual rights. If
so, then it is a mere contractual dispute that should be resolved by the
contractual dispute resolution mechanism.

[el

This situation is to be contrasted with the situation where the conduct
surrounding the contract breach is politically motivated, i.e., conduct
involving the exercise of ‘puissance publique’ ,without the existence of any
genuine good faith dispute under the underlying contract. Where the State’s
breach of contract is the consequence of the political convenience of the
government in power then it ceases to be a mere contractual breach and
constitutes a parallel breach of the FET standard.”"*

This juxtaposition implies that the “failure to perform a contract may amount to a
violation of the FET standard.”"* A State act can be based in contract, and yet
constitute a breach of a BIT if the State has not complied with its obligation to treat the

investment fairly and equitably.’ Thus, breaches of the FET treatment standard can be

established when the breach of contract is accompanied by the existence of
“aggravating factors”, such as government conduct which is “arbitrary, unfair, unjust,
lack[s] due process and [does] not respect the investor’s reasonable and legitimate

expectations.””"” The Claimant argues that “no distinction exists in the law of State

 

Responsibility between acts iure imperii (or sovereign acts), for which States can in

principle be responsible under international law, and acts iure gestionis (or commercial

 

acts), for which States cannot be responsible.”?'* A State is responsible for all the a

 

of its associated bodies, whatever their nature.’ Even if an underlying relationship is

125. The Claimant submits that the

Contract for pre-shipment inspection was, from its inception, an eminently
public law contract. BIVAC’s functions directly replaced services typically
performed by the Government through its customs authorities. Further, the
very conclusion of the Contract responded to a political imperative to
increase tax revenues from import operations in order to “achieve the income
levels and to pay expenses provided for in the National General Budget.”

 

Paraguay admitted the public administrative law nature of the Contract early
in these proceedings and has only recently sought to change its position. It is
worth citing what Paraguay said in this respect in its first written submissions
on jurisdiction:

‘At issue in this litigation is a Contract in which one of the parties is the State.
It is not a Private Law contract, executed by two private persons. [...]
Evidence of this is that the Paraguayan State has rescinded the Contract of
Public Law, by means of a unilateral decision, due to the fact that the public
interest was at stake, following the principle that Public Contracts may be
modified or rescinded by unilateral decision of the State’s Administration.”
(Paraguay’s Objections on Jurisdiction, 8 April 2008, page 19).”?*4

126. The Claimant further submits that the dispute was political and stresses that:

 

“Paraguay’s repudiatory conduct was due solely to political imperatives. It
had nothing to do with any genuine discussion of the scope or interpretation
of the Contract, or even with any concern regarding BIVAC’s performance or
compliance. The reality is that no Government or Minister was ready to take
political responsibility for the obligations contracted by a prior
i ion. The endless successive investi providing i
responses simply ensured that the payment of the debt would be passed to the
next Minister or Government.”””>

 

127. The Claimant argues that Paraguay’s conduct is in breach of the FET standard and the
obligation not to impair investments by unreasonable measures for a number of
reasons, all of which are linked to the treatment surrounding the breach of Contract by

the Government of Paraguay, rather than the breach of Contract itself:

“Once again it is not a simple breach of Contract by itself that is complained
of by BIVAC; it is the manner in which Paraguay has treated BIVAC in
dealing with that issue. Like in Azurix, the problem is that the issue was
politicized because of popularity concerns of the different Governments,
and/or because the Contract had been awarded by a previous Government.
That conduct reveals politically motivated governmental arbitrariness,
negligence, lack of transparency, inconsistency or bad faith, and is thus in
breach of the FET standard. It is ultimately an instance of repudiation, since
there cannot be any good faith explanation to Paraguay’s failure to pay. We
are here well within the realm of unfair and inequitable treatment [...

    

 

The Claimant insists that:
“Paraguay’s acts have nothing to do with the acts that an ordinary party could
carry out. They are of a fundamentally different nature. In the absence of any
argument to refuse payment, an ordinary contracting party would have no
right to commission reports and reviews from various state agencies in order
to avoid payment.”

128. The Claimant relies on recent awards to support its position. It refers inter alia to the

award in Joannis Kardassopoulos and Ron Fuchs v. Georgia where the Tribunal held

BIVAC Post-Hearing Brief, para. 19.
Ibid, para. 22.
26 BIVAC Memorial, para. 235.
27 Ibid., para. 238.

 

52

that the facts in that case did

 

“not preclude Mr. Fuchs from holding throughout the term of his investment
the legitimate expectation that Georgia would conduct itself vis-a-vis his
investment in a manner that was reasonably justifiable and did not manifestly
violate basic requirements of consistency, transparency, even-handedness and
non-discrimination. [...]

The compensation process appears to have initially begun in the spirit of
reaching an amicable settlement consistent with what Mr. Fuchs may
reasonably have expected [...]. Lamentably, despite this initial instruction, the
spirit of settlement appears to have diminished over time as lengthy delays,
refusals by various government officials to address the matter, and internal
disputes over who carried responsibility for the matter combined to result in
an overall obfuscation of the compensation process and disregard for the duty
to provide compensation. [...]

 

The process which ultimately unfolded following constitution of the
compensation commission in 1997 can only be described as non-transparent,
arbitrary and unfair. [...] Georgia was, however, obligated to act reasonably,
transparently and in a non-arbitrary manner towards the Claimants. The
evidence on the record demonstrates that this is not, in fact, what transpired.
There is moreover no defence, on the evidence presented, for the delay with
which the process was carried out, even allowing for some delay on the part
of the Claimants in submitting documentation of their claims. [...]While the
Claimants complied with each request in an effort to settle the matter of their
investment amicably, arranging for the preparation of two audit reports by
reputable accounting firms, their efforts were consistently met with a circular
response in which a resolution of the matter was ordered from the highest
level of the Georgian Government only to be avoided or passed off by the
individuals tasked with effecting such a resolution.

Over the course of a seven year period following the formal establishment of
a compensation process, responsibility for Tramex's claim was shuffled from
one government ministry to another, without any progress. [

 

The Tribunal finds inexcusable the categorical denial of any responsibility or
obligation towards the Claimants, which came eight years after Georgia
initiated the compensation process.”~

 

129. The Claimant submits that the facts and circumstances of Kardassopoulos mirror those

in the case at hand. It notes that

“[hJere too there has been a ‘circular response’ to BIVAC and its claim; there
have been ‘lengthy delays, refusals by various government officials to
address the matter’; the ‘internal disputes over who carried responsibility for
the matter combined to result in an overall obfuscation of the compensation
process and disregard for the duty to provide compensation’; ‘responsibility
for [the investor's] claim was shuffled from one government ministry to
another, without any progress’; when ‘a new government was elected [...] yet
another State commission established to consider the matter of [the
investor's] claims’; all while ‘the evidence discloses that senior members of
the [...] Government believed that [...] compensation was owed to’ the
investor. Paraguay’s conduct exhibits all these deficiencies, which constitute

   

 

8 Kardassopoulos and Fuchs v. Georgia, paras. 441, 443 and 446-449.

53

unfair and inequitable treatment, just as in Georgia’s case.”

The Claimant further argues that contrary to Paraguay’s view, the awards in
Bayindir2” RFCC," Impregilo?” Paushok,* Waste Management™ and Parkerings**
lend no support to Paraguay’s position. According to the Claimant, those cases must be

distinguished from the circumstances of the present

 

e because they all concerned
purely contractual disagreements regarding the interpretation of contract terms or

39236

“genuine commercial divergence’’* and there was no arbitrary and unfair conduct or

other issues beyond the application of the contract.?”

4.3.1.4. Unreasonable Measures

130. Under Article 3(1) of the Treaty, Paraguay is also subject to an obligation not to
“impair, by unreasonable or discriminatory measures, the operation, management,
maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal [of the investments of nationals of other

3938

Contracting Party] by those nationals.

  

131. The Claimant argues that the standard of reasonableness requires “a showing that the

State’s conduct bears a reasonable relationship to some rational policy.” As with the

 

FET standard, the reasonableness standard must be determined in light of all the
circumstances of the case, to assess whether the State’s conduct was “appropriate

behaviour.” The Claimant contends that Paraguay’s conduct towards BIVAC “was

 

not grounded in rational policy, as it involved reviewing the legitimacy of an

acknowledged debt time and again leaving the debt repudiated.”™' According to the

Claimant, there can be nothing reasonable in commissioning “some twelve different

in spite of the findings in those reports.””">
The Claimant disputes Paraguay’s view that “it was more than reasonable for Paraguay

to conduct investigations” because of “the concerns [...] about certain conduct on the

 

part of BIVAC in the implementation of the Programme and the economic crisis in

 

Paraguay.”™* First, the Claimant argues that there were no such genuine concerns.

  

Second, according to the Claimant an “economic crisis” does not justify

“investigations” into “conduct on the part of BIVAC” (or anything specifically to do

 

with the Contract). Rather, those investigations were “political ploys used

rons

unreasonably to avoid paying an unpopular debt.

4.3.1.5. The Issue of Jurisdiction

4,3.1.5.1. The Alleged Jurisdiction of the Tribunal

133.

The Claimant asserts its claim is based on the Treaty and “cannot be reduced to a

contractual controversy to be submitted to Paraguayan court:

 

~s The requirement of

 

submission to Paraguayan courts would introduce a rule on exhaustion of local

remedies into the Treaty and would reduce the FET standard to a bare prohibition

against a denial of justice.

The Claimant relies on the Vivendi Annulment Decision:

“In the Committee’s view, it is not open to an ICSID tribunal having
jurisdiction under a BIT in respect of a claim based upon a substantive
provision of that BIT, to dismiss the claim on the ground that it could or
should have been dealt with by a national court [...]

Claimants should not have been deprived of a decision, one way or the other,
merely on the strength of the observation that the local courts could
conceivably have provided them with a remedy, in whole or in part. Under
the BIT they had a choice of remedies.”*"°

BIVAC further submits that since “a FET claim is a pure Treaty claim which does not
fall under the Contract’s dispute resolution clause, and for which this Tribunal is
directly competent under the Treaty,” *’ there is no possible competition between local
courts and an arbitral tribunal and a claim before a local court could not justify a stay

of arbitral proceedings.

The Claimant warns that to “hold otherwise would run contrary to the admonishment

of the Vivendi II tribunal’”** which held:

“To the extent the Respondent contends that the fair and equitable treatment
obligation constrains government conduct only if and when the state’s courts
cannot deliver justice, this appears to conflate the legal concepts of fair and
equitable treatment on the one hand with the denial of justice on the other.

But if this Tribunal were to restrict the claims of unfair and equitable
treatment to circumstances in which Claimants have also established a denial
of justice, it would eviscerate the fair and equitable treatment standard.
Although the standard is commonly understood to include a prohibition on
denial of justice, it would be significantly diminished if it were limited to
claims of denial of justice”?

 

The Claimant reviews the relevant case law addre:

courts, and argues that the dispute at hand is to be distinguished from those cases

 

insofar as the amount of the debt at issue in the present case is not in dispute; that
the conduct of the Respondent was not fair and reasonable; **' and the dispute is not

purely contractual in nature.’

that its own serious and legitimate concerns with the Paraguayan court system were
one of the reasons why it took the “commercial decision” to bring the present dispute

to arbitration. It refers to the lack of independence, corruption, delays in the

 

rendering of judgments, high and irrecoverable c s well as the non-enforceability

of judgments.**

139. The Claimant quotes Transparency International’s 2007 and 2008 Global Corruption
Reports which highlight the constant political interference in the judiciary in Paraguay
and the general lack of trust due to nepotism and corruption. It also cites the United
States Agency for International Development which concluded in its 2004 Report that
there is a “general consensus” that Paraguay’s court system was corrupt.*° The
Claimant also referred to Human Rights Report for Paraguay for 2011 of the US State

Department which found that

“[t]he constitution provides for an independent judiciary; in practice,
however, political interference seriously compromised that independence”.”””

140. The Claimant further asserts that a civil suit before Paraguay’s courts would have cost
it more than US$ 6 million,”* that it would take a court of first instance between 3 and
15 years to decide the dispute and four further years for the dispute to be resolved on
appeal. The Claimant contended that this statement was not contested by the
Respondent,”” and that any potential judgment finding against the State would not be
enforceable because in accordance with Articles 530 and 716 of the Paraguayan Civil
Procedure Code the judgment can only be communicated to the Ministry of Finance so

that payment is foreseen in the annual State budget.

system between 1996, when the Contract was signed, and 2006, when it initiated the
arbitration." The following dialogue during the hearing is instructive:

“MR. FORTIER: Okay. Now, you took us through the chronology of the
factual matrix which brought about decisions by the claimant, and you
reminded us that the contract was signed, in 1996, with the clause 4 and 9.1.
You situated us in 2002 when the Comptroller's report was issued, that, in
effect, said:

“Valid contract, BIVAC has performed its obligations under the contract. And
any criticism is unfounded,’ I think was the word which you focused on at
one point earlier this morning.

This was in 2002. And then between 2002 and the time in 2006 when you
elected to file a request for arbitration before ICSID, you reminded us of the
crescendo of statements by the new president, who came into office in, I
think, in August of 2003.

MR. BLACKABY: Correct.

MR. FORTIER: And you described --with a number of exhibits, you
described what you represent demonstrates the lack of impartiality of the
judiciary under the reign of President ‘Duartos.”

MR. BLACKABY: President Frutos.

MR. FORTIER: [...] I understood you to say you have to focus on the lack of
independence of the judiciary and the corruption prevalent in Paraguay as of
the point in time when BIVAC took the decision to exercise its rights under
the treaty. Correct?

MR. BLACKABY: Yes, I mean, we are trying to explain the decision.

MR. FORTIER: But it was the snapshot is the situation of the judiciary, its
lack of independence, as of the time that you took that decision.

MR. BLACKABY: Correct.

MR. FORTIER: Do we have evidence in the record as to what the situation
was when the contract was signed in 1996 as to the independence or lack
thereof of the judiciary in Paraguay at that moment in time?

MR. BLACKABY: I think there is nothing specific. I mean, the Transparency
International reports don't go back that far, and the elements which we gave
to you go back to 2002.

In 1996, I mean, the only thing one can state is that, with regard to what
happened with the purge — I think you can call it that — in 2003 by the
president of the Supreme Court, inevitably, that was a consequence of a clash
between the powers.

But beyond that, with regard to the situation in 1996, you know, the key issue
—I guess the more immediate issue for BIVAC was that the very president
who had publicly repudiated the debt was the one who had just nominated six
out of the nine members of the Supreme Court, and that, therefore, entering
into a system which the ultimate destination would be before that court, you
know, was not — that was not something that had occurred before 2003.

MR. FORTIER: And that you represented to us drove your — the claimants’
decision to resort to an allegation of treaty breach.

MR. BLACKABY: I think in any event, you know, in terms of the conduct
that we saw here, we believe that the treatment which we had received was a
breach — was a breach of the treaty under various heads.”?

142. The Claimant has submitted further evidence in this regard and cites a Paraguayan

newspaper article reporting that in 2003 the newly elected President Duarte threatened

“to pulverize the judiciary.” The Claimant asserts that according to a report of
Transparency International, shortly thereafter 7 of the 9 judges of the Supreme Court

were removed from office and replaced by new members who

“were professionals with lower-grade qualifications and experience than
those replaced, giving the impression that the president had all along intended
to create a more pliable Supreme Court.”

BIVAC concludes that local remedies would thus have been futile considering the
serious deficiencies in the Paraguayan court system and the repudiatory attitude of the
President in 2006, who at the same time had uncontested power to interfere with

judicial proceedings.”

4.3.1.6. Losses Caused by Paraguay’s Conduct

143. According to the Claimant, Paraguay’s conduct has prevented the payment of the debt
in its entirety for over a decade and is therefore a proximate and direct cause of

BIVAC’s full los:

between the conduct and the | must be “sufi

 

9268 39 269

or the loss must be “attributable to the wrongful act and foreseeable’

“the

“proximate,”

 

The Claimant argues that these requirements are fulfilled in the present c:
loss sustained by BIVAC was a direct consequence of the failure to act transparently
and in good faith in its treatment of the debt, which was not so paid due to Paraguay’s
conduct in breach of FET” and because “[t]he government knew their conduct would

result in the State capturing the full amount of the debt owed to BIVAC.”?!

144. The Claimant notes that its loss “is inextricably tied to the conduct of Paraguay over

the last decade, not only to its failure to pay in 1999 when the Contract was
terminated; “[a]rbitral tribunals do not trace losses back to particular acts or omissions,
rather, what matters is the injury flowing from “the whole of the conduct.”??
According to the Claimant, the Tribunal is therefore required “to award to BIVAC the
full amount of the debt plus interest” in order to restore it to the position it would have

been in had the debt been dealt with fairly and equitably.”

4.3.1.7. The Calculation of Damages

145.

146.

m

Claimant asserts that Paraguay owes BIVAC compensation for the principal amounts
set out in the unpaid invoices amounting to US$ 22,016,142. BIVAC notes that

Paraguay has not denied the face value of the invoices."

According to the Claimant, it is also entitled to a payment of interest in the present
case. BIVAC refers to the Vivendi case where the tribunal held that the liability to pay
interest to an injured claimant, as a form of compensation for the loss of use and

disposition of the money due, is now “an accepted legal principle.”””*

The Claimant further argues that interest rate to be applied is that of Dutch commercial
transactions because this rate has the closest connection to the present case and to the
commercial reality. According to the Claimant, it is far more likely that the sums owed
to BIVAC would have been invested in the Netherlands rather than in Paraguay,
considering the fact that BIVAC BV is a Dutch corporation that routinely transacts
business in the Netherlands and payments under the Contract were made to BIVAC’s
Dutch bank account.” The Claimant also argues that the Treaty supports this
conclusion, since its provision on expropriation refers to interest “at a normal

commercial rate,”?” which is better reflected in the Netherlands’ rate than in

Paraguay’s rate, considering the latter’s “uneven commercial and macroeconomic
conditions.” The Claimant adds that this has been the practice of the Iran-US Claims

tribunal’® as well as other ICSID tribunals.””

148. Moreover, the Claimant submits that a commercial rate of interest compounded
annually should be applied to each of the unpaid invoices from the date they became
due until the date of payment.” First, according to the Claimant, the award of
compound interest is usual practice under international law.*' Second, the Claimant
disputes Paraguay’s argument that “the award of compound interest violates
Paraguayan law.”’**According to Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of

Treaties, the Claimant submits that Paraguay cannot rely on its domestic laws to avoid

its

 

international obligations to pay interest on the sum due.**

annually on the principal amounts, the Claimant argues that BIVAC’s loss amounted to

wrongful actions

 

°° According to the Claimant, this argument is unfounded in law and
is not supported by the evidence. In the Claimant’s view:

performing party has to save a defaulting party from the financial
consequences of its own unlawful acts. Further, it is not true that BIVAC
‘passively sat back and decided to let the debt mount each month.’ The
evidence is uniform: a sustained — and costly — effort by BIVAC to secure
payment.”**°

4.3.2. The Respondent’s Position

151. The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s allegations and legal arguments and asserts that
Paraguay has not breached Article 3(1) of the Treaty. It contends that the applicable
FET standard is reflected in customary international law and that Paraguay has not
violated this standard (4.3.2.1). Paraguay arues that even if the Tribunal were to accept
the Claimant’s interpretation of the standard, Paraguay still cannot be held to have
violated it because it has not acted arbitrarily, lacking transparency and due process,

negligently and inconsistently, in bad faith, and has neither repudiated the debt nor

 

ists that the

 

breached BIVAC;s legitimate expectations (4.3.2.2). The Respondent i
relationship between Paraguay and BIVAC was commercial in nature and not
obstructed by governmental power (‘puissance publique’) (4.3.2.3). It also asserts that
Paraguay has not taken “measures” and that what it did was not unreasonable and did
not impair BIVAC’s investment (4.3.2.4). Moreover, the Respondent insists that the
dispute must be resolved by the sovereign courts of Paraguay as contractually
convened (4.3.2.5). Finally, the Respondent submits that Paraguay’s conduct was
immaterial to BIVAC’s losses (4.3.1.6) and that BIVAC cannot claim contractual
damages for alleged breaches of a treaty provision, let alone compound interest at

Dutch rates and that damages were not mitigated by Claimant (4.3.2.7).2"

4.3.2.1. No violation of the Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard as Defined by Customary
International Law

152. The Respondent alleges that the FET clause in the BIT incorporates the
international minimum standard under customary international law. The Respondent

contends that Paraguay** and the Netherlands*’ each intended the FET standard to

refer to the international minimum standard.” In addition to the intention of the Parties
themselves, the Respondent argues that States, including NAFTA parties such as
United States”! and Canada, and non NAFTA parties such as Switzerland*? have
generally adopted the customary international law minimum standard of FET in

bilateral treati

   

.°* even where the treaty itself does not expressly refer to customary

international law. Indeed, the NAFTA Free Trade Commission issued an official

 

binding interpretation of the FET standard recognizing that “the concepts of ‘fair and
equitable treatment’ and ‘full protection and security’ do not require treatment in
addition to or beyond that which is required by the customary international law
minimum standard”.* The Respondent submits that this interpretation has been

2s

applied in subsequent tribunal awards.”* The Respondent also notes that tribunals
outside NAFTA have found that the fair and equitable treatment standard incorporates
the international minimum standard,” while groups such as the International Law

A

   

ciation noted that the fair and equitable treatment clause is an example of treaty

practice.”

153. The Respondent further alleges that customary international law is “applicable in the
relations” between Paraguay and the Netherlands, as nothing in the Treaty or in the

evidence before the Tribunal demonstrates the existence of a contrary intent.”* The

standard’ which forms part of customary international law.” OECD Draft Convention on the Protection of Foreign Property,

Respondent disputes Claimant’s position that the FET clause requires the Tribunal to
apply its own notions of fairness and equity. The Respondent alleges that BIVAC’s
exclusive reliance on tribunal awards ignores the history of the international minimum
standard and the consistent expressions by States, which recognize that the FET

standard incorporates the international minimum standard.*”

154. The Respondent further disagrees with BIVAC’s interpretation of the awards in Pope
& Talbot, Mondey,", and Azurix,™ as a rejection of the minimum standard. Instead,
the Respondent argues that the tribunal in Pope & Talbot subsequently confirmed the
binding nature of the minimum standard interpretation in the award for damages, and
that while the tribunal in Mondev observed that the FET standard in NAFTA could not
exceed customary international law, and the tribunal in Azurix interpreted a violation
of the FET standard as “conduct below international standards.”** In addition, the
Respondent disagrees with the Claimant’s position that the fair and equitable treatment
standard in the BIT can be interpreted through reference to dictionaries, noting that

such an approach has been rejected by tribunals because it does not provide a defined

 

legal standard. The Respondent also alleges that the Claimant’s approach subverts
the purpose of the “Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties which in reality makes
clear that background principles of customary international law supply the definition

of treaty terms when that is the intent of the treaty parties.” Finally, the Respondent

 

argues that the Claimant’s proposed analysis is contrary to the ICSID Convention and
transforms a legal term with a defined meaning in customary international law into an

implicit consent for arbitrators to decide ex aequo et bono, a standard to which no

 

treaty terms to incorporate their meaning from customary international law pursuant to Art. 31(3)(c). See: OH! Plasforms (Iran

State would agree."

155. According to the Respondent, the content of the minimum standard of treatment under

customary international law may differ depending on the context or State conduct in

 

question. However, the burden to prove that a specific rule has been breached rests
with the Claimant.” Irrespective of the application of context-specific rules or a
general standard, BIVAC has not proven that Paraguay breached such standard of
FET.’

156. According to the Respondent, if a general standard of treatment applies, that standard

remains the one expressed in the Neer case, which states:

“(T]he treatment of an alien, in order to amount to an international
delinquency, should amount to an outrage, to bad faith, to willful neglect of
duty, or to an insufficiency of governmental action so far short of
international standards that every reasonable and impartial man would
readily recognize its insufficiency.”

The Respondent disputes the Claimant’s allegation that Neer has been almost
universally rejected as a statement of the current international minimum standard of

treatment of foreign investors. The Respondent considers that the Claimant’s position

customary international law by means of State practice and opinio juris." Thus,
whether or not scholars and arbitrators had the intention to set out a general standard is
irrelevant to the question of the existence of such a standard.‘ Additionally, “[a]s a

matter of State practice, the United States, Canada, Mexico, Argentina and the Czech

 

Republic have expressly accepted that Neer represents contemporary customary

international law.”*" Further, the “ICJ, the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal, and investor-

 

State tribunals have interpreted undefined and ambiguous treaty terms to incorporate
their meaning from customary international law pursuant to Article 31(3)(c)”.““ The
Respondent further disputes the relevance of each award cited by the Claimant,

“Where, as here, a claim is based on a breach of contract and the State does
not use its executive, legislative, or judicial power to nullify rights under the
contract, it does not engage in the level of conduct that warrants international
intervention pursuant to customary international law. The BIT parties surely
did not expect to be hailed before an international tribunal on a debt-
collection matter for which the investor had, but refused, contractual
remedies.”*"*

against conduct that is ‘arbitrary, inconsistent, negligent, unreasonable, in bad

legitimate expectations violates customary international law. If the Tribunal
concludes that the FET Clause incorporates the international minimum
standard, then it is BIVAC’s burden to prove that these factors are part of that
standard. None of the factors that BIVAC puts forth as contained in the FET
Clause are part of the international minimum standard.”

that they have. Instead, it relies exclusively on decisions of tribunals, which

The Respondent further asserts that even if the Tribunal were to apply standard of FET

. “Paraguay objected to BIVAC’s invoices even before the Parties terminated the Contract.
Two months before the mutual termination of the Contract, the Ministry of Finance
formally objected to BIVAC’s invoices from June 1997 to December 1997 and from

of the Contract;** and payments under the Contract started to be withheld as early as

report from Aduanas Director, Margarita Diaz de Vivar, dated 30 March 2005, reporting
that clause 2.9 of the Contract was not complied with. Although BIVAC says this Report
cleared BIVAC from any wrongdoing, Ms. Vivar’s Report observes that BIVAC did not
comply with its technology transfer obligations under the Contract;**”

The Respondent further states ‘that BIVAC failed to screen the PSI requests it received
from importers is not in dispute’ [...], ‘that BIVAC was responsible for ensuring that
exempt goods were not inspected’ [...] and that ‘Paraguay estimates as much as 50% of the
certificates of inspection BIVAC issued were undue because they corresponded to
Mercorsur goods, a material deviation of the stated goals of the Contract (increased

revenue) and PSI regulations.’”**!

163. The Respondent insists that these communications with the Claimant are evidence of a

dispute between the parties arising prior to the commencement of the arbitration and

refutes the Claimant’s allegation that they “constitute ex post facto rationalizations to

justify not paying BIVAC”.*? Paraguay asserts that the Claimant misrepresents the

facts when alleging that the debt was acknowledged by Paraguay or that there was

even an agreement reached on its payment. It argues that the Claimant relies on five

documents for its allegation and that these five documents are inconclusive:

“The first document is a letter by Minister Zayas dated July 31,1998 (almost
a year before the Contract was terminated), in which Mr. Zayas merely relays
the number of invoices pending payment and expresses the desire to pay a
third of them and to dispose of the rest ($12 million out of $18 million)
through a ‘concertaci6n de intereses,’ that is, through mutual concessions.***

The second document cited by BIVAC is a letter from Minister Zayas dated
June 7, 1999, in which Minister Zayas simply gives notice of termination of
the Contract. In that letter he makes clear that the termination would not
subvert the legal rights and obligations already incurred by both BIVAC and
Paraguay. There is no mention of a specific number purportedly owed, much
less an acknowledgment of the debt.**

The third document relied upon by BIVAC is nothing more than a chart
listing the outstanding invoices issued by BIVAC and SGS. The title of the
chart itself leaves no doubt that the document in question is not an
acknowledgement or admission of the debt: ‘invoices pending payment
issued by BIVAC, BV until June 1999.’ And although the description of the
subtotals for each year uses the word ‘otal adeudado,’ it is a stretch to say
that this document is anything other than what its title says: a list of pending

invoices [...].

The fourth document is a letter written by Minister Oviedo-Britez to BIVAC
dated February 13, 2001, in which Minister Oviedo-Britez is only responding
to BIVAC’s request for payment. The Minister merely says that he assumes
that the Contract was duly performed and that an investigation is ongoing. He
makes no statement that unequivocally states the position of the Ministry or
the government that BIVAC is due all that it claims is owed.

70. Finally, BIVAC relies upon a letter dated April 19, 2004, by Minister
Miguel Gomez. In that letter Minister Gémez states that he is working on
finding a solution for the claimed amounts, including a schedule of payments
that is in accordance with the financial possibilities of the Paraguayan State,
and then requests a new meeting with BIVAC’s representatives in order to
negotiate the outstanding invoices. This is not an unequivocal promise to pay
the debt, as BIVAC claims. It is a letter setting parameters of a settlement
negotiation.**

The other letters BIVAC cites are instances where Paraguay attempted to

resolve the outstanding invoices amicably, first by offering half of the

amounts outstanding and then by offering to pay in government bonds.**

These statements simply cannot be used by BIVAC as evidence that the debt

is undisputed. They are statements in the course of settlement negotiations,

and under international law they cannot in good faith be relied upon by

BIVAC to show that the amounts are owed.”*”
As to the Report by the Comptroller General of 4 October 2002 on which BIVAC
relies, the Respondent submits that it is a technical opinion in response to a request by
the Minister, a “Dictamen” according to Paraguayan administrative law without any
legally binding force. It cannot be interpreted as a document acknowledging

Paraguay’s debt.”

In light of these facts, the Respondent submits that Paraguay’s conduct does not
violate the FET standard as defined by BIVAC because it is not arbitrary (4.3.2.2.1); is
transparent and in accordance with due process (4.3.2.2.2); is diligent and consistent
(4.3.2.2.3); and in good faith (4.3.2.2.4). The Respondent also contends that it did not
repudiate the debt (4.3.2.2.5) nor did it breach BIVAC’s legitimate expectations
(4.3.2.2.6).

The Respondent rejects that arbitrariness is part of the fair and equitable treatment

 

standard,’ yet at the same time and without expr

 

ing any reservations, it cites the
awards in Parkerings v. Lithuania and Pantechniki v. Albania which have both held
that arbitrariness and breach of contract may constitute unfair and inequitable
treatment.** Be that as it may, the Respondent denies the allegation that its conduct
was arbitrary. It reiterates that the commissions and reports were only internal
measures that did not impair the Claimant’s rights and that its refusal to pay the

invoices was valid bec:

   

 BIVAC had not complied with its contractual obligations
regarding the creation of a database, the provision of technical assistance, and
compliance with the regulatory scheme. The economic reality of the Contract, which
cost Paraguay more than it was able to recover in taxes, must equally be taken into

consideration.

The Respondent relies on the ICJ’s decision in ELSI,“ to the effect that its conduct
was not arbitrary insofar as the Claimant has never been precluded from pursuing legal
remedies before the courts of Asuncién, as provided for under the Contract. The
Respondent contends that those legal remedies were available to BIVAC at any point
since 1997 for the alleged non-payment of the debt and allegedly wrongful

commissions and investigations.“*

Furthermore, the Respondent denies that the finding of arbitrariness in Siemens v.
Argentina applies to the present case.“ In Siemens, Argentina acted so as to frustrate

the purpose of the contra

  

t and the investor’s legitimate expectation by not providing
an authorization needed by the investor. Paraguay contends that in the present case it
did not change any regulation or requirement to make BIVAC’s performance more

difficult or impossible.*”

169. The Respondent relies on Pantechniki v. Albania, in which the tribunal held that:

“It is true that arbitrary decisions may constitute unfair and inequitable
treatment and that an ICSID tribunal in a general sense has jurisdiction to
deal with the merits of such claims. Yet this proposition is immediately
defeated if the particular claim of arbitrariness has been voluntarily submitted
to another jurisdiction. It transpires on examination that the alleged
arbitrariness is said to arise by reason of Albania’s refusal to compensate.
That is precisely the issue which the Claimant (to its current regret) took to
the Albanian courts. I could not rule on it without violating my own
jurisdictional constraints.”*“

4,3.2.2.2. Transparency and Due Process

170. Paraguay refutes BIVAC’s contention of lack of due process for the the same reasons
it rejects arguments with regard to arbitrariness:
“BIVAC had an effective legal remedy for both the non-payment and the
allegedly wrongful investigations: a contract suit in court. A judicial
proceeding — complete with all of the rights of a litigant to present evidence,

subpoena and call witnesses, appeal adverse decisions, and enforce a
judgment in its favor — is the epitome of due process.”*”

171. The Respondent further argues that it did not fail to act in a transparent manner. It
describes, as undisputed, that the investigations and reports were not conducted
secretly and that the results were all communicated to BIVAC. It objects to the
allegation that BIVAC was not invited to offer its view of the facts. Paraguay, referring
to Metalclad v. Mexico, where the tribunal had suggested that transparency requires
the unhindered availability of information on laws and regulations with respect to the
investment, asserts that the legal regime in Paraguay was incontestably known by

Claimant.**

4,3.2.2.3. No Negligence and No Inconsistency

172. As with arbitrariness, the Respondent also denies that inconsistency and negligence

are factors relevant to the FET standard.**' This being the case, however, it asserts that

it did not act negligently nor inconsistently“ Unlike the respondents’ conduct in

disputes cited by Claimant, such as Kardossopoulos** and PSEG,** where the

 

tribunals had found inconsistent and negligent conduct for procedural and substantial

 

unfairness during the negotiation proc: , Paraguay’s alleged errors took place in
internal, non-binding investigations with no effect on relations with BIVAC. The
process of negotiations was therefore not possibly tainted with inconsistencies or

negligence.***

4.3.2.2.4. No Bad Faith

173. The Respondent denies it acted in bad faith. It alleges that the standard for proving bad
faith under international law requires “clear and convincing evidence” that the State
engaged in such conduct.’ In the present case, the Claimant did not show that
Paraguay’s conduct meets that standard. Paraguay argues that it had “legitimate
concerns” with regard to paying BIVAC and that the Tribunal cannot, as the Claimant
contends, “infer” bad faith merely from the withholding of payment. Further, relying
on the Tribunal’s Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, the Respondent alleges that
any allegations of bad faith surrounding non compliance with its contractual

obligations are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Paraguayan courts.**”

4,3.2.2.5. No Repudiation

these voiced doubts as to the payment obligations, they also insisted that they would

only pay a debt that is clear and/or legally valid. Finally, it argues that Paraguay never
closed the door to Paraguayan courts and would have respected a ruling establishing

359

an obligation to pay the debt.

175. The Respondent relies in its assessment on Waste Management, EnCana and
Parkerings and quotes the tribunals’ decisions:

“(t]he Mayor was not purporting to exercise legislative authority or
unilaterally to vary the contract. He was not intervening by taking some
extra-legal action|...]. He was saying what ought to be done, in his view, to
allay public concerns which did in fact exist at the time. Individual
statements of this kind made by local political figures in the heat of public
debate may or may not be wise or appropriate, but they are not tantamount to
expropriation unless they are acted on in such a way as to negate the rights
concerned without any remedy. In fact no action was taken of the kind
threatened at the time or later. Even if it had been taken, the Claimant had
remedies available to it, under the Concession Agreement and otherwise.

 

and
“Tn terms of the BIT the executive is entitled to take a position in relation to
claims put forward by individuals, even if that position may turn out to be
wrong in law, provided it does so in good faith and stands ready to defend its
position before the courts. Like private parties, governments do not repudiate
obligations merely by contesting their existence.

and

“Under certain limited circumstances, a substantial breach of a contract might
constitute a violation of a treaty. [...] In most cases, a preliminary
determination by a competent court as to whether the contract was breached
under municipal law is necessary. This preliminary determination is even
more necessary if the parties to the contract have agreed on a specific forum
for all disputes arising out of the contract.”

176. The Respondent relies on the dicta in these awards to argue that:

“the failure to pay a contractual debt remains a contract claim, not a treaty
claim, when the State leaves open a forum to adjudicate and remedy the
alleged breach of contract and does not repudiate the contract by, for
example, taking legislative or extra-legal action to eliminate contractual
rights or remedies.”

The Respondent argues that legitimate expectations must be assessed as “at the time of

 

the investment”. According to the Respondent, BIVAC’s legitimate expectations at
the time of the Contract were “to perform under the Contract, get paid, or, if
insufficient payment was forthcoming, to have the option of stopping performance and
suing in the courts of Asuncién for contractual breach.” The Respondent contends
none of these expectations were frustrated and that BIVAC cannot complain that its
legitimate expectations did not materialize when it itself refused to bring a claim to the
Paraguayan courts.** The Respondent adds that “contractual expectations” are distinct
from “expectations as understood in international law” and that remedy for frustration
of the former is to seek redress before a national Tribunal, rather than bring a claim for

breach of FET in international law."

The Respondent disagrees with the argument that the expectation of payment of
invoices due under the Contract is the type of expectation protected by the FET
standard. Relying on ELSP" and Waste Management,** the Respondent notes that
while a breach of contract may be against a rule of law, but in itself a breach of

contract is not against the rule of law, or international law.”

The Respondent also argues that the Claimant’s view suggests that the Ministry’s
failure to pay BIVAC’s invoices can be considered a breach of the FET standard “as a
fall-back provision to its umbrella clause claim.” The Respondent alleges that such an
interpretation is at odds with Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention, which requires
that terms of a treaty provision be given their ordinary meaning.*” The Respondent
further distinguishes its actions from the case in Azurix: “[b]y contrast, here BIVAC
and the Ministerio agreed to terminate the Contract and there is no allegation that any

branch of the government tortuously interfered with the Contract” or that Paraguay

“subvert[ed] the contractual or regulatory framework in a way that frustrated BIVAC’s

o371

legitimate expectations.

Finally, the Respondent disputes the Claimant’s allegations that Paraguay’s alleged
lack of political continuity affected and deprived BIVAC of its reasonable
expectations. First, the Respondent alleges that the Claimant has failed to address the
issue of causation, i.e. “the nexus between the commissions and reports and the impact
those had on BIVAC separate from the purported breach of the Contract itself.” Since
BIVAC’s alleged losses materialized at the time its invoices became past due, and well
before such commissions and reports were ever initiated, the Claimant’s choice to
pursue a non-litigious resolution and its consequences are to be attributed to the
Claimant alone.” Second, the Respondent alleges that the issue of “political
continuity” must be dealt with by looking into the circumstances of the individual
case. The Respondent suggests that BIVAC was well aware of the political volatility in
Paraguay at the time of Contract, just as the the Claimant in Bayindir had been

aware.”

The Alleged Commercial (not Governmental) Conduct

The Respondent’s argument rejecting BIVAC’s approach to the breach of Treaty claim
is based on the Tribunal’s statement in its Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction “that
BIVAC would have to meet a threshold for treaty claims that requires it to establish
acts by or attributable to Paraguay that show an act of ‘puissance publique’, that is to

say ‘activity beyond that of an ordinary contracting party ." The Respondent alleges
that the Claimant has failed to satisfy this test, and that its theories on liability and on
damages demonstrate that the claims are fundamentally contractual and _ that

Paraguay’s conduct was not sovereign in nature.

The Respondent argues that sovereign acts give rise to sovereign liability in a forum

for sovereigns, while commercial acts give rise to private liability in a private forum.
Only a sovereign State’s acts can violate the standard of treatment under the BIT and
this view is consistent with the Tribunal’s holding in its Decision on Objections to

Jurisdiction and a wider jurisprudence constante.* Consequently, the Respondent

 

argues that a commercial act such as failure to pay a debt due under a contract is not,
as such, a breach of international law.” The Respondent disagrees with the Claimant’s
arguments that any act of the state, either iure imperii or iure gestionis, can violate
international law. Instead, the Respondent advances its own interpretion of the

authorities cited by the Claimant*” to argue that the rules surrounding state conduct

 

require an analysis of the sovereign or commercial nature of the State’s actions. It

refers to modern developments of national and international law which distinguish

 

between public and commercial actions of States on the basis of the nature of the
contractual relationship and not to its purpose as Claimant a: certs.” The Respondent
submits that there is no evidence in the present case to allow for the conclusion that
the parties to the BIT clearly intended for the BIT to apply to commercial acts, and
that such an intention would be required under international law in order to derogate

from well established principles.

183. Further, the Respondent argues the Tribunal’s interpretation of the BIT must comply
with the principle of in dubio mitius, as recognized in international law, which
provides that “[i]f the meaning of a term is ambiguous, that meaning is to be preferred
which is less onerous to the party assuming an obligation, or which interferes less with
the territorial and personal supremacy of a party, or involves less general restrictions

upon the parties.”°”?

184. Furthermore, the Respondent disagrees with the Claimant’s argument that the cases of
Bayindir, Impregilo and RFCC, in which it was held that commercial acts do not
violate BIT provisions such as the FET clause, can be distinguished from the
circumstances in the present case.*° The Respondent goes on to allege that the
Tribunal must apply the rule in Waste Management to the effect that “even the
persistent non-payment of debts by a municipality is not to be equated with a violation
of Article 1105 [of NAFTA (fair and equitable treatment)], provided that it does not
amount to an outright and unjustified repudiation of the transaction and provided that

some remedy is open to the creditor to address the problem.”**!

sserts that the Claimant’s interpretation confuses the issue of
State attribution of an internationally wrongful act with whether that act was
internationally wrongful in the first place. Relying on the ILC Articles on State
Responsibility,’ the Respondent alleges that the question here is not whether a
commercial act of a State organ is attributable to the State (as it was in Noble
Ventures), but whether the primary obligations established in the BIT are violated by

commercial acts. Noble Ventures supports the view that there exist a general rule

whereby breach of a contract by a State, under normal circumstances, does not give

ss
rise to direct responsibility on the part of the State under international law.

Finally, the Respondent disagrees with the Claimant’s interpretation of
Kardassopolous, Rumeli, PSEG Alpha and Eureka™ as providing support for its claim
that a commercial act can breach the standards of treatment under a BIT. First, the
Respondent claims that in none of these cases are the facts parallel to those in the
present case, since they involved the abuse of State sovereign authority; procedurally
and substantially unfair administrative negotiations proceedings; the absence of an
efficient remedy against governmental decisions whereas according to the
Respondent, the present case involves an alleged breach of contract. It concludes that

“[A]Il of the cases on which BIVAC relies are consistent with the principle
that a claimant cannot transform a breach of contract into a breach of treaty
merely by saying that the breach of contract was unfair, arbitrary,
nontransparent, or negligent when the State offers an adequate contract
remedy, which it does not frustrate or repudiate. To the extent that any of
these cases could be said to involve a breach of contract by the State, the
claimants had treaty claims, not contract claims, because the State had not
offered or had frustrated a fair legal process to address the alleged breach of
contract.”

According to the Respondent, given that only sovereign, governmental and public
conduct on behalf of the State of Paraguay consisting an abusive interference with the
Contract could have given rise to a claim for violation of the FET standard, the
Claimant has to prove that such conduct was indeed exercised. The Respondent argues
that the Claimant failed to do so since it did not show that Paraguay had used “its
police, adjudicatory, or legislative powers to the detriment of the rights of the
claimant” which is a requirement for an act to be deemed a sovereign act.” It is
alleged that in reality “[T]he Ministerio behaved as a normal market player. Its failure
to pay sums allegedly due is an act that any private party can commit” and the internal
investigations and reports could also “have been undertaken by a corporation to
evaluate its post-termination strategies.”** BIVAC “attempts to turn an ordinary

Respondent, the attempt to characterize the Respondent’s actions as governmental also
fails because “a private entity certainly can hire a third party to help it collect revenue
and prevent fraud; these are not uniquely sovereign goals. A private party can also rely
on macroeconomic factors, including an economic downturn, to explain non-payment
under a contract”.”” In sum:

“Any private party can refuse to pay under a contract. Commercial disputes
routinely involve alleged non-payment under contracts for goods or services.
A private party can also make statements purportedly consistent with a desire
to pay but still refuse payment. And a private company can conduct internal
investigations or audits regarding a contracting partner’s performance under a
contract to determine whether requested payment is consistent with the
parties’ contractual obligations.”**!

Moreover, the Respondent contends that the Claimant’s allegations regarding
Paraguay’s wrongful refusal to pay and the investigations into BIVAC’s claims for
payment do not support its arguments because they incorrectly focus on the purported
purpose of the alleged acts rather than their nature. According to the Respondent, none
of these allegations demonstrates the misuse of governmental authority or the
application of ‘puissance publique’. Further, the Respondent alleges that to determine
whether an act is commercial or sovereign, the Tribunal can make an analogy with the
law of sovereign immunity, whereby an act is commercial if its nature (rather than its
purpose) is commercial. Paraguay explains that the purpose for which it entered into
the contract and refused payment is not determinative as to the sovereign or private
characterization of the acts. Looking at the distinction in nature between a sovereign
and a private act, the Respondent submits that in the present dispute the elements of

. - . 302
private acts are present, whereas the elements of sovereign acts are absent.

Finally, the Respondent submits that internal reports generated to advise the State as to
whether payment is due to a contracting party which request it, as well as statements
in response to such requests for payment, are not legislative, administrative, or quasi-
judicial acts.” The Respondent further argues that since Paraguay did not undertake

sovereign acts in the present case, such as a legislative decree to cancel the Contract,

and since it has never claimed that its non-payment was unchallengeable in
Paraguayan courts, there was no sovereign act to abrogate or cancel the contract.”
The Respondent maintains that persistent non-payment under a contract constitutes an
indisputably commercial act and thus is not proof of sovereign authority sufficient to

violate Article 3(1) of the BIT.

. The Absence of Unreasonable Measures

 

190. The Respondent alleges that the Claimant has not proven that Paraguay engaged in
unreasonable measures because: (i) it has not shown that the Respondent’s statements

or investigations constitute “measures” as defined under the BIT; (ii) the Respondent’s

  

acts were not unreasonable; and ( the alleged acts did not impair the Claimant’s

investment.

191. First, the Respondent alleges that State conduct without legal effect cannot constitue a
“measure” under international law. The internal reports on which BIVAC relies were
not “measures” because “[t]hey were not binding administrative proceedings and had
no legal effect.” Rather, they were “meant to advise the Paraguayan government as to

so denies

 

whether or not BIVAC was entitled to payment.” Further, the Respondent a
that the alleged statements (the letters or statements made during meetings) constitute

“measures”.*

192. Second, and in the event that the Respondent’s conduct is considered as “measures” by
the Tribunal, the Respondent argues the measures were reasonable and do not
constitute a violation of Article 3(1) of the BIT.** According to the Respondent,
tribunals have recognized that State acts purportedly contrary to law but that can be

corrected through judicial process do not constitute a breach of the general standard of

** Paraguay Rejoinder, para. 65; the Respondent's argument against the existence of a sovereign act in the present case relies
on the definition of “sovereign act” set out in Shufeldt Claim (United States ex rel. PW. Shufeldt v. Republic of Guatemala),
see: Schwebel, “On Whether the Breach by a State of a Contract with an Alien is a Breach of International Law,” in Justice

treatment.*” The Respondent disputes the Claimant’s view that such a rule imposes a
requirement to exhaust local remedies. Instead, the Respondent argues that where the
basis of an alleged breach of an investment treaty is a violation of a contract or the
disregard of contractual rights, the Claimant’s failure to seek an available remedy for
such acts in the contractually designated forum renders the alleged breach of
international law merely inchoate. According to the Respondent, State practice

supports this view.**The Respondent also argues that this interpretation is consistent

 

with the annulment committee’s decision in Helnan and Vivendi, where it was
acknowledged that in some circumstances the failure to seek remedies in the local
courts may be relevant when deciding whether State’s conduct has violated a treaty

399

standard.

193. Third, the Respondent contends that the Claimant must prove that the alleged

unreasonable measures on which it bas

 

its claim impaired “the operation,
management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal” of its investment.“ According
to the Respondent, BIVAC failed to show “clear evidence” that the investigations and
statements, rather than non-payment itself, impaired its investment, nor has it
identified “specific injury” flowing from these actions, or proven that the statements

and investigations were a conditio sine qua non of the impairment of its investment, as

 

other tribunals have required.*”' The Respondent submits that neither the investigations
nor the various statements prevented the Claimant from bringing forward a contractual

claim to secure payment.

194. In the Respondent’s view, the agreement to bring “any conflict, controversy or claim
which arises from or is produced in relation to this Contract, non compliance,
resolution or invalidity [...]’* before Paraguayan courts, entails two consequences

with respect to the present dispute.

195. First, it establishes the exclusive competence of these courts over disputes concerning
the Contract, thus barring the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. The Respondent alleges that
“BIVAC has always had the unimpeded right to resort to the Paraguayan judiciary”,

“ and that this remedy was

even while negotiations and investigations were under way
effective for both the non-payment and the alleged wrongdoing. It insists that

BIVAC’s

 

assertions are nothing more than an attempt to avoid its obligation to bring a
contractual claim in the Paraguayan courts thus circumventing “freely made

contractual choices.”*°*

196. The Respondent further disagrees with Claimant’s assertion that the requirement to
bring the dispute before local courts amounts to a local-exhaustion condition. It
argues that the question in the present case is not one of denial of justice but of

applying the Parties’ autonomous agreement in the appropriate forum.**

197. On the other hand the forum selection clause has a direct bearing on the ascertainment

of Treaty obligations. The Respondent asserts that:

- BIVAC cannot prove that “Paraguay unfairly treated its right to payment

because that right must first be established in Paraguay,”

- it is not possible to establish the repudiation of the debt as long as the

investor’s rights are protected by an effective remedy to courts,"

- arbitrariness or lack of due process cannot be established as long as effective

legal remedies by way of a “suit in court” exist,” and

- no legitimate expectation is frustrated as long as Paraguay does not “block

BIVAC's access to court.”

Finally, the Respondent states that at “no time, and in no way, did anyone prevent

BIVAC from initiating a collection suit in Asuncién.”*"'

198. The Respondent relies on Parkerings v. Lithuania, where the Tribunal held:

“Under certain limited circumstances, a substantial breach of a contract could
constitute a violation of a treaty. So far, case law has offered very few
illustrations of such a situation. In most cases, a preliminary determination by
a competent court as to whether the contract was breached under municipal
law is necessary. This preliminary determination is even more necessary if
the parties to the contract have agreed on a specific forum for all disputes
arising out of the contract. [...]

However, if the contracting-party is denied access to domestic courts, and
thus denied opportunity to obtain redress of the injury and to complain about
those contractual breaches, then an arbitral tribunal is in position, on the basis
of the BIT, to decide whether this lack of remedies had consequences on the
investment and thus whether a violation of international law occurred. In
other words, as a general rule, a tribunal whose jurisdiction is based solely on
a BIT will decide over the “treatment” that the alleged breach of contract has
received in the domestic context, rather than over the existence of a breach as
such.

In the case at hand, there is no doubt that BP had access to the Lithuanian
Courts. [...] The experts confirmed that the Lithuanian Courts are
independent and that levels of corruption had declined substantially.

L..] The failure to complain of the violation of the Agreement before the
Lithuanian Court leads to two consequences. First, the Claimant failed to
show that the Municipality of Vilnius terminated the Agreement wrongfully
and therefore breached the Agreement. Second, even supposing that the
Agreement has been wrongfully terminated, the Claimant failed to show that
the right of BP to complain of the breach of the Agreement has been denied
by the Republic of Lithuania and thus that its own investment was actually
not accorded, by the Respondent, an equitable and reasonable treatment in
such circumstances.”“!”

4,3.2.5.2. The Alleged Insufficiency of the Paraguayan Court System

199. The Respondent strongly objects to BIVAC’s argument that Paraguayan courts are so

corrupt, sluggish, expensive and inefficient that any resort to them would be futile and

84

that it can therefore not be expected to litigate in Paraguay.""’ It does so on two counts.
It firstly argues that

“[T]his argument rings especially hollow given that BIVAC agreed by
contract to the jurisdiction of the Paraguayan courts. It cannot negate its
contractual obligation by now claiming that the forum to which it agreed was
never in a position to grant justice. And it is unlikely that a sophisticated
multinational company like BIVAC would have accepted the jurisdiction of a
forum that it believed would deny it justice. Indeed, Paraguayan courts have
taken the side of foreign investors against the government in recent cases."“!*

Secondly, it submits that BIVAC changed the argument only during the hearing to

accommodate the Tribunal’s question to this effect by suddenly asserting “for the first

 

time that “the Paraguayan courts have deteriorated in the time since it signed the

Contract” and “that the forum-selection clause could no longer be respected.”*'*

200. The Respondent invites the Tribunal to reject the Claimant’s submission since
allegations as to endemic corruption, inefficiency and incompetence are extremely
serious matters and can only be accepted by solid evidence, and that such evidence has
not been put before the Tribunal.** It alleges that BIVAC has relied on “a handful of

unreliable reports” which are devoid of facts and analys

 

and replete with conclusions
about the state of the judiciary based on hearsay and anecdotal evidence, and the

authors are not available for cri

 

-examination. It suggests that hearsay has been

excluded by international tribunals when not supported by confirmatory evidence.‘”

Finally the Respondent refutes the Claimant’s presentation of costs as
includes counsel’s fees and other costs which are not part of costs of courts, as it
presents the costs as being more than US$ 6 million which is 30 times higher than the
real costs, and it neglects that the State would have to reimburse all costs and fees if

BIVAC prevailed.”

The Respondent alleges that BIVAC has failed to prove its damages, since it has not
demonstrated the accuracy of its invoices or that it actually performed all of the
inspections for which it seeks payment. The Respondent also recalls that BIVAC is not
entitled to damages for inspecting goods originating in Mercosur countries that were

not subject to import duties or to recover payment for improperly issued certificates."

Moreover, the Respondent relies on a holding in the case concerning the Factory at
Chorzéw which states that “reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the
consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all
probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.” It asserts that the

would still be left with unpaid contractual debts. Further, the Claimant cannot prove

that losses occurred because it relied on statements made after the termination of the

 

Contract, since they had occurred with its termination and thus could not possibly
have been caused by violations of a FET obligation.** The Claimant has not shown
that the investigations and statements on which it relies for its claim under Article 3(1)
of the BIT has caused any harm to BIVAC or resulted in the same damages as the

alleged breach of contract.

4.3.2.7. The calculation of damages

205. The Respondent submits that in case the Tribunal awards damages, BIVAC would not
be entitled to any interest. It asserts that BIVAC had the responsibility to reduce its
losses by pursuing its claim and seeking compensation in a timely fashion. “Instead,
BIVAC passively sat back and decided to let the debt mount each month.” BIVAC’s
ten year delay before taking legal action against Paraguay caused the interest demand
to balloon is unreasonable and in violation of the obligation to mitigate its damages.
The Respondent alleges that while the Respondent does not accept the Claimant’s
allegations, no reasonable person in BIVAC’s place that believed that successive
governments’ tactics were “empty, baseless, dilatory, clearly unfounded, obviously
meant to evade responsibility, and based on a familiar and predictable pattern”, (which
the Respondent contests), would have waited ten years to file this arbitration or a
contract suit in Paraguay. Therefore, the Tribunal should not award interest, which it

has the power to do since the award and calculation of interest is not mandatory, but

within the Tribunal’s discretion.’

The Respondent asserts that in case interest is awarded it should be simple interest at a
rate based on Paraguayan law, rather than compound interest at a rate based on Dutch
law.” Contrary to BIVAC’s contentions, the Respondent denies that the Netherlands
interest rate more closely corresponds to the “normal commercial rate” under Article 6
of the BIT. According to the Respondent, Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention
directs the application of Paraguayan law, which is both the law of the Contract and
the law of the State party to arbitration:

“The Dutch rate neither reflects the agreement of the parties, nor is it
internationally accepted as the standard interest rate”.“”*

 

The Respondent submits that tribunals have recognized that international law does not
require any particular interest rate and that the law of the host State applies to
determine the amount of interest due. If at all, the Tribunal should follow the trend of

arbitral tribunals and award interest at a maximum rate of LIBOR +2%.*”

As for compound interest, the Respondent submits'” that this principle violates
Paraguayan law which expressly nullifies any clause providing for it,*" and that it has
not been accepted by international tribunals such as Autopista v. Venezuela’? and

further does not correspond to international law as is made clear by the International

 

Law Commission’s Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility, which note

that

“{tIhe general view of courts and tribunals has been against the award of
compound interest.

L.1

Nonetheless, several authors have argued for a reconsideration of this
principle, on the ground that ‘compound interest reasonably incurred by the
injured party should be recoverable as an item of damage’. This view has
also been supported by arbitral tribunals in some cases. But given the present
state of international law, it cannot be said that an injured State has any
entitlement to compound interest, in the absence of special circumstances
which justify some element of compounding as an aspect of full
reparation.”**>

4.3.3. The Reasoning and Decision of the Tribunal

208.

209.

210.

211.

Having concluded that the Claimant h

 

tanding to bring this claim for a violation of
the BIT, the Tribunal turns to the central issue in this case, namely the question of
whether, by its acts or omissions, Paraguay is liable for a violation of Article 3(1) of

the BIT.

Article 3(1) provides:

“Each Contracting Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment of the
investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party and shall not impair,
by unreasonable or discriminatory measures, the operation, management,
maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal thereof by those nationals.”

To prove a violation of Article 3(1), the Claimant must establish that the actions of
Paraguay are of a nature as to give rise to a violation of the treaty obligation set out in
that provision. In its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal addressed one factor that
arises where, as in the present case, the claim under Article 3(1) is closely connected
to the contractual relationship between Claimant and Respondent in circumstances in
which the Contract provides for the resolution of contractual disputes. Having regard
to the arguments and evidence then before it, the Tribunal was alerted to the possibility
that the dispute may be centered on a failure to pay an outstanding debt owing under
the Contract. With this in mind, the Tribunal emphasized in its Decision on
Jurisdiction over the Article 3(1) claim (as formulated by the Claimant) that it
expressed no view as to

“whether a persistent failure to make payment on an outstanding debt,
however unreasonable or unwarranted, could of itself ever amount to a
violation of the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment in
circumstances in which a contractually agreed remedy remains available”.*™

The Tribunal noted the Award of the Tribunal in Impregilo SpA v. Pakistan, on the

interplay between treaty claims and contractual claims. The Tribunal in that case

stated:

“In order that the alleged breach of contract may constitute a violation of the
BIT, it must be the result of behaviour going beyond that which an ordinary
contracting party could adopt. Only the State in the exercise of its sovereign
authority (‘puissance publique’), and not as a contracting party, may breach
the obligations assumed under the BIT. In other words, the investment
protection treaty only provides a remedy to the investor where the investor
proves that the alleged damages were a consequence of the behaviour of the
Host State acting in breach of the obligations it had assumed under the
treaty.”

On the basis of this approach, which the Tribunal considers to be correct and
applicable in the present case, in order to succeed in a claim alleging violation of
Article 3(1) of the BIT, the Claimant must show that it meets the threshold for treaty
claims. It must show, in other words, that the conduct of Paraguay reflects an act of
‘puissance publique’, that is to say “activity beyond that of an ordinary contracting

party.”

The fundamental basis of the treaty claim under Article 3(1), over which this Tribunal
has jurisdiction, turns on the interpretation and application of that treaty provision and
the alleged conduct of Paraguay (as ‘puissance publique’), and not on the
interpretation and application of the Contract as such (although the Contract will
necessarily be part of the overall factual and legal matrix which must be considered).
In this regard, the Tribunal notes that the interpretation of Article 3(1) of the BIT is
not a matter over which the tribunals of the City of Asuncién would be able to exercise
jurisdiction under Article 9 of the Contract. The issue of fair and equitable treatment
was not one which the parties to the Contract agreed to refer to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts of Asuncién. The treaty issue is therefore not one for that
forum, and there can be no question of an independent or self-standing treaty claim
over which the Tribunal has jurisdiction being inadmissible by reason of the choice of

forum for the resolution of a dispute under the Contract.

The Tribunal has paid careful attention to the arguments of the Parties, as they have
evolved over the proceedings, as well as the evidence on which they rely in support of
their respective arguments as to the treaty claim. In order to determine whether or not
there has been a violation of Article 3(1) of the Treaty, the Tribunal considers that it

must begin by looking at the facts, to establish with precision the conduct of Paraguay

90

that is said to give rise to the alleged violation of the Treaty. The Tribunal must begin
by ascertaining whether the facts establish that the conduct of Paraguay amounts only
to “a persistent failure to make payment on an outstanding debt”, or whether it

amounts to something more. Having addressed that issue, the Tribunal must then

   

determine whether the facts as properly characterized can give rise to a violation of
Article 3(1) of the Treaty. If the facts show that Paraguay’s acts amount only to “a
persistent failure to make payment on an outstanding debt”, then the Tribunal must
decide whether such facts are capable of giving rise to a violation of Article 3(1) of the
Treaty; if the facts show something more, as the Claimant alleges (appearing now to
accept that a mere failure to make payment on an outstanding debt would not be
sufficient to allow a successful claim under Article 3(1)), then the Tribunal must

determine whether those facts give rise to a violation of Article 3(1).

4.3.3.1 The Tribunal’s appraisal of the facts

214.

215.

What is the conduct of Paraguay that is complained of? As set out at paragraphs 44 -
52 above, there is no dispute between the Parties that a Contract was entered into, that
certain services were performed under the Contract, that a series of invoices were
issued, and that by August 1998 at least some of those invoices were paid. Nor is it in

dispute that other invoices remain unpaid since that date.

The evidence shows that in August 1998 Paraguay’s new Government of President
Cubas took office, and that shortly thereafter payments for services under the Contract
were suspended. In January 1999 the Minister of Finance instigated investigations
into the Contract, on the basis of alleged breaches of the Contract. In February 1999,
by Presidential Decree No. 2003, the Ministry of Finance was authorised to
discontinue the Contract upon termination of its initial term. There is no dispute as to
the legality of the discontinuance under the Contract: it was agreed between the
Parties, in accordance with the terms of Article 8 of the Contract, which does not
require any reason to be stated or there to be any allegation of a breach of contract.
There is no claim by the Claimant that the adoption of Decree No. 2003 was in any

way in breach of the Contract, or that it violated the BIT.

91

218.

In March 1999, following the adoption of the Decree, a number of invoices dating
back to 1997 were paid. As matters stood at the end of March 1999, the situation was
that the Contract had been lawfully discontinued, but a significant number of invoices
under the Contract remained unpaid by the Government. It is these unpaid invoices -

that total nineteen in number - that are at the heart of this claim under the BIT.

What happened next? By letter dated 7 June 1999, the new Minister of Finance
(Federico Zayas) confirmed the Government’s decision to discontinue the Contract.
He also noted that the obligations of both parties arising under the Contract for the
Rendering of Services shall cease “except the rights already acquired.“ The Tribunal
considers that the letter recognizes that the Claimant’s existing rights under the
Contract will not be interfered with, in the sense that “rights already acquired” by
BIVAC will be honoured. There is no repudiation of any rights under the Contract.
Nor, however, does the Tribunal read the letter as amounting to a recognition of the
validity of the Claimant’s claims to payment under the Contract: it is one thing to
recognize the existence of rights under the Contract, but quite another to determine
whether such rights include the right to be paid for any particular services and invoices

rendered under the Contract.

Minister Zayas followed this communication with another letter a week later, dated 14
June 1999. This responded to a letter from the Claimant of 8 June 1999, requesting
payment of the debt. In his letter, Minister Zayas suggests that it would be appropriate
to set out in due course the balance of the debt, and proposes applying a discount of

50% of the outstanding balance as a ba:

 

for negotiation.” The Tribunal considers
that this letter, like the earlier one, cannot be interpreted as recognizing BIVAC’s right
to payment under the Contract; the letter merely proposes a lump sum reduction of the
claim as eventually ascertained without offering any reason for the proposed way
forward (there is no indication, for example, as to whether the proposal is made for
reasons of contractual disagreement or budgetary difficulties, or the existence of other

reasons).

219.

220.

On 22 June 1999, the Ministry of Finance prepared a Report for Minister Zayas that
addressed the circumstances of the existing non-payment of the financial obligations

under the Contract. The Report identified a series of alleged contractual breaches by

 

the Claimant, including an alleged failure to provide technical a ance as required
by the Contract.** This Report by the Ministry's of Finance technical services
purported to list a number of incidents arising in relation to the Contract, and asserted
that the Claimant had not complied with its contractual obligations. It also raised a
concern about possible double billing by the Claimant, apparently for the first time.
The Tribunal expresses no view on the merits of the arguments raised by the
Ministry’s Report. It recognizes, however, that the concerns raised do set out a prima
facie plausible explanation for non-payment that is founded on a view of the Contract
and an assessment of the facts. As such, the preparation of the Report cannot as such
be said to amount to an exercise of sovereign authority that interferes with a right
under the Treaty: the report is not qualitatively different from any similar internal
report that might have been prepared by a private party to a contract that has formed
the view — whether justified or not - that there are grounds for non-payment of a debt

owing under a contract to which it is a party.

5 9

On 6 August 1999, the Ministry of Finance prepared a List of Outstanding Invoices.
The Claimant asserts that this constitutes a recognition of an outstanding debt. The
Respondent disagrees, on the basis that the title of the chart merely refers to invoices
for which payment is pending as issued by BIVAC, and does not constitute an
admission of a debt. The title indeed leaves no doubt that the document in question is
not an acknowledgement or admission of the debt: it is entitled “invoices pending
payment issued by BIVAC”. The Tribunal considers that the document is no more than
a list of outstanding invoices. It cannot as such amount to a recognition of a debt
owing under the Contract, and its preparation cannot be said to constitute an exercise
of sovereign authority, whether or not in violation of a Treaty obligation. The

document could just as easily have been prepared by any party to a contract.

97 etter No. 2702 from the Mit

On 2 December 1999 the Ministry of Finance wrote to the Claimant responding to a
further request for payment of the outstanding debt.” Minister Zayas indicated in the
letter that no debt could be paid until the General Comptroller of the Republic had
completed a special investigation, in conformity with the request formulated by the
Office of the Attorney General in a Note dated 14 July 1999 (a copy of which was
attached to the letter). The Tribunal considers that this letter once again relates
exclusively to the issue of a payment under the Contract. It does not purport to
repudiate any rights under the Contract, and amounts to an action that any non-
sovereign contracting party could just as easily follow. There is nothing in the action
so initiated that can be said to amount to an exercise of sovereign authority. The
Tribunal reaches the same conclusion in relation to the letter sent the following week —
on 13 December 1999 — in which Minister Zayas responds to a further request for

payment of the debt pending."

The following year, in an undated document prepared at some point during 2000, the
General Comptroller of the Republic published its first report on alleged irregularities
concerning the certificates of inspection issued by the Claimant.’ The Tribunal
expresses no view on the report’s findings, but concludes once again that there is
nothing in the report to support the view that the preparation of the report or its
contents reflects an exercise of sovereign authority in respect of rights arising under
the Contract. The Claimant’s rights under the Contract — in particular the right to be
paid and to seek judicial relief before the courts of Asuncién if payment is not made —
are fully maintained. The preparation of such a report could just as easily have

emanated from the bowels of a private contracting party.

On 12 February 2001 the Ministry of Finance produced a further report on the
matter.’ The report states that the Ministry recognises the validity and existence of the
Contract, but that “the Ministry of Finance cannot effect any payment until the
relevant control procedures initiated by the General Comptroller of the Republic are

completed.” The report adds that “this does not imply in any way that the State is

 

y of Finance to BIVAC, Exhibit CE-24.

refusing to honor its obligations with respect to said contract.” The Tribunal reiterates
its conclusions as set out above in relation to earlier documents, which apply equally
to the Note of 13 February 2001: this indicated the view of the Ministry of Finance

that “once the

 

ssignment is concluded by the [General Comptroller of the Republic],
and the required account reconciliations are completed, we will proceed with utmost
haste to obtain the necessary budgetary amendment from Congress to finance and pay
the pending obligation owed by the State for the services rendered by your
company...’ There is no sovereign interference with the Claimant’s rights, including
any right to be paid. Throughout this period, the Claimant was free to avail itself of
the right of access to the tribunals of the City of Asuncién to resolve the dispute under

the Contract.

On 25 July 2001, the General Comptroller of the Republic produced its Final Report
on certificates of inspection issued by the Claimant.“* The report sought to verify the
performance by the Claimant of services under the Contract, to determine “the facts
that could be considered irregular with respect to the formal and substantive aspects of
pre-shipment inspection certificates.” The Report purported to describe instances of
alleged non-compliance with the Contract and its regulations, including (1) the failure
to obtain authorized signatures on some Certificates of Inspection; (2) the failure to
send some documents electronically as required by Resolution 1171/96; and (3) the
failure to create the database required by the Contract. The Tribunal expresses no view
on any of the allegations made. The Tribunal notes, however, that once again there is
nothing in the report that could be said to amount to an interference with the
Claimant’s rights under the Contract, or an exercise of sovereign authority that goes

beyond that which an ordinary contracting party could adopt.

Over a year later, on 4 October 2002, the General Comptroller of the Republic
produced a further Report, concluding that “the hypothetical non-compliance with the

contract or economic harm to the patrimony of the Republic of Paraguay resulting

from the performance of said contract, is unfounded.”“* This apparently clear
conclusion followed a statement issued by the General Customs Office in June 2002
which certified that “there is no existing complaint regarding non-compliance with the

contract against [the Claimant].’"’ The Tribunal notes that the October 2002 report

 

appears to be the first 0

 

ion on which a body associated with the Respondent states
that the Claimant has complied with its obligations under the Contract (the
certification by the General Customs Office appears to do no more than state that no
claim of non-compliance had previously been made). In response, in its submissions to
the Tribunal the Respondent argues that the further report of the General Comptroller
of the Republic is non-binding, and was merely advisory in character and not part of
an administrative proceeding initiated under Paraguayan law. Whether or not that is an
accurate account of the situation pertaining under the law of Paraguay, the fact is that
the report provides considerable support for the Claimant’s claim to be entitled to be
paid on the outstanding debt. The Tribunal notes that the Claimant did not avail at this
time, as it could have done, of the right of access to the tribunals of the City of

Asunci6n to recover the payment which it claimed to be due under the Contract.

Some nine months later, the situation appears to have changed. On 28 June 2003, the
Internal Audit of the Ministry of Finance produced Note No. 21. This found that the
Claimant had not complied with the Contract, inter alia in relation to matters of pre-
inspection and technical cooperation.“* The Tribunal notes that this finding reiterated
the previous finding of the Ministry of Finance (of June 1999, see above at para. 219),
but contradicted the more recent report of the General Comptroller of the Republic.
The Tribunal is thus faced with a situation in which two government departments have
reached apparently different conclusions on the same matter. The two positions are
indeed contradictory and cannot be reconciled. Yet there is nothing in the June 2003
note that purports to interfere with the Claimant’s rights under the Contract, including
the right to have recourse to the contractually agreed forum for the resolution of
disputes. The mere fact that a difference of view has arisen within two government
departments — not an infrequent occurrence in the life of public authorites --cannot as

such amount to an exercise of sovereign authority that goes beyond that which an

228.

ordinary contracting party could adopt. The Tribunal is equally aware that an ordinary
(non-sovereign) contracting party might equally find itself subject to an internal
difference of view as to whether a contractual obligation requires payment of any

moneys.

On 19 April 2004, the Ministry of Finance wrote to the Claimant once more.” The
Ministry stated that it was “the desire of the National Authorities to honor the debts
that the Paraguayan State has with its different creditors, among which is the company
that you represent”, adding that it is “finalizing a study [...] in order to find a solution
to the payment of the debt claimed and propose a schedule of payments that is in
accordance with the financial possibilities of the Paraguayan State.” The Tribunal
notes that the letter is not on its face an acknowledgement of any outstanding debt, in
the sense of an agreed amount, or a commitment to pay any outstanding debt.
Moreover, there is nothing in the letter that could be said to amount to an interference
with the Claimant’s rights under the Contract, or to reflect any exercise of sovereign
authority that goes beyond the behaviour of any ordinary party to a contract, or to
constitute any inducement for the Claimant to avoid recourse to the tribunals of the
City of Asuncién, which remained available. The delay is unfortunate, to say the least,
and may even be unjustified as a matter of law under the Contract, but the mere fact of
delay cannot as such transform conduct under the Contract (including non-
performance) into a sovereign act that could give rise to a violation of Article 3(1) of
the BIT. Something more is needed, and this conduct, like that which it follows,
relates exclusively to the non-payment of a contractual obligation, and not to anything

else.

Two months later, on 3 June 2004, the Ministry of Finance adopted Resolution No.
274, which determined that the payment of BIVAC’s invoices “are suspended until the
veracity of possible irregularities in the companies’ compliance with the contract is
established.” The Ministry noted that it had “not yet determined whether there was
non-compliance with the contract on the part of [BIVAC]”, and established a

Commission to review the matter. The Resolution further stated that “[p]rior to the

commencement of negotiations with the representatives of BIVAC [...] the
Commission [created herein] shall establish the definitive position of the Ministry of
Finance with respect to whether or not the payment of the pending debts to the
inspecting companies is in order.” The views of the Tribunal as to this conduct is the

same as that pertaining to the earlier conduct.

Eight months later, on 3 Feb 2005, by Resolution No. 43 the Ministry of Finance
resolved that the investigation as to whether any payment should be made to BIVAC
under the Contract would be reassigned to the National Customs Office, a branch of
the Ministry of Finance, as the Committee tasked by Resolution 374 had concluded
that it lacked competence.*' The Tribunal notes the further delay, but sees no basis for
concluding that the resolution as such interferes with the Claimant’s rights under the
Contract, including the right of recourse to the tribunals of the City of Asuncién. The
decision reflected in the Resolution cannot as such amount to an exercise of sovereign
authority that goes beyond the kind of decision that an ordinary contracting party

might also take.

The following month, on 30 March 2005, the National Customs Office issued Report
No. 377. The Report notes that the Claimant has undertaken “scant verification of pre-
shipments”, that there has been a “lack of technical cooperation” and a “lack of
information for the creation of a databank”, and that “the training mentioned in clause
2.9 was not carried out.” However, it concluded that “all possible claims with respect
to the compliance or non-compliance with the contract signed by the Minister of
Finance and Bivac Paraguay S.A. have already been reported, debated, refuted and
dismissed by either the Public Prosecutor or by the General Comptroller of the
Republic.” It further found that the Public Prosecutor and the Comptroller of the
Republic had “already conducted investigations into the contract in question, and both
institutions concluded that all of its clauses had been complied with.”** The Tribunal
takes note of this report, which appears to be conclusive in determining that as at
March 2005 the debt that the Claimant claimed to be owed under the Contract was

recognized by the relevant authorities of Paraguay as being valid. All that remained,

thereafter, was for the amounts to be determined and paid.

Despite this Report, the outstanding debts under the Contract were not paid. Instead,
on 22 June 2007, the Ministry of Interior adopted Decree No. 10485, opening a new
investigation, apparently at the instigation of the President of the Republic.**
Understandably, having regard to the fact that some eight years had now passed since
the matter was first raised, the Claimant decided not to proceed with further efforts at
negotiation, and decided instead to have recourse to the settlement of the dispute under
the law. Rather than have recourse to the tribunals of the City of Asuncion, as it was
still entitled to do under the Contract, it chose to institute ICSID proceedings under the

Treaty.

 

Before summarising the conclusions of the Tribunal as to the facts, it is appropriate
briefly to address certain other evidence tendered by the Claimant in support of its
contention that the Respondent’s conduct constitutes the exercise of sovereign

authority such as to be able to violate Article 3(1) of the Treaty.

The Claimant invokes a number of letters that it has written and sent to Paraguay over
the period of the dispute. For example, on 29 May 2001 it wrote to the Ministry of
Finance, summarizing the situation, and asserting that the Ministry of Finance had
undertaken to pay US$ 5,465,778 for invoices from August, November and December
1997 and to that end would apply to Congress to have this amount included in the
2001 budget.** A further letter of 6 July 2001 suggests that the Claimant had been
shown a budgetary application made to the Congress, to allow payment of US$ 5.4
million to BIVAC in 2001.‘ On 6 November 2003, the Claimant wrote to the Ministry
of Finance referring to a meeting said to have been held on 8 October 2003, claiming
that it was agreed that the Ministry of Finance would examine the matter and suggest a
mechanism to pay the outstanding debt which would be negotiated between the
parties.*° Additionally, on 23 February 2006 the Claimant wrote once again to the

Ministry of Finance, in which it was claimed that the modalities for the payment of the

debt were initiated.’ The Tribunal notes that these letters were written by the
Claimant, summarizing its perspective of the matters that were said to have taken
place, including undertakings alleged to have been given. In the absence of any
confirmatory evidence indicating the views of the Respondent, the Tribunal cannot
rely on such communications as evidence that such undertakings were in fact given. In
any event, on its face none of this material could reasonably be said to reflect any sort
of repudiation by Paraguay of the Claimant’s rights under the Contract. Nor could the
undertakings alleged to have been given — assuming them to be established - be said to
amount to an exercise of sovereign authority that goes beyond a conduct which an

ordinary contracting party could adopt by analogous actions.

234. The Claimant also invokes a number of newspaper articles in support of its claims.
For example, it refers to an article in Ultima Hora dated 31 July 2001 (“No se pagardn
deudas a las SGS y la BIVAC”), that reports that Minister Oviedo announced that he
will not pay a single guarani to BIVAC without Congress’ authorization, as the debt
relates to a contract that was entered into by former governments.** It invokes an
article dated 7 May 2005 in ABC Color (“‘Hacienda anuncia investigacién de deudas
con SGS y BIVAC’), which asserts that the Minister will launch a new investigation,
notwithstanding the recent report by the Customs Office vindicating the Claimant.”
Another article published by the same newspaper on 18 May 2006 (“Gobierno solo
pagarda las deudas legitimas”, ABC Color) includes a quote from President Duarte,
during a visit to France, in which it is alleged that he stated that “I do not have
anything to do with previous Governments” and that no debt would be paid that was
not clear.” The following day a further article was published (“Deuda con los
franceses data de la era Wasmosy”, ABC Color), alleging a statement by President
Duarte that suggested the obligations had been assumed by a previous Government
that may not have accrued them lawfully.*"' Interesting as they may be, the Tribunal is
wary about placing too much reliance on newspaper reports, which may provide an
incomplete or partial account of what has been said, even assuming that the quotations

are accurately recorded and reproduced. The Tribunal has no objection to treating such

reports, which are in the public domain, as admissible but of limited, if any, probative
weight. That said, even assuming such reports to be fully accurate, they do not, in the
view of the Tribunal, constitute a repudiation by Paraguay of the Claimant’s rights to
relief under the Contract, or an exercise of sovereign authority that can reasonably be
said to go beyond behaviour that an ordinary contracting party might adopt if it had

decided not to make a payment owing under a contractual obligation.

The Tribunal turns then to the assessment of these facts. In its Decision on
Jurisdiction, the Tribunal concluded that Article 3(4) of the BIT gave it jurisdiction
over a claim that arises from or is produced directly in relation to the Contract, but that
this included not only the obligation to make payment of invoices in accordance with
the requirements of the Contract but also the obligation (implicit if nothing else) to
ensure that the tribunals of the City of Asuncién were available to resolve any
“conflict, controversy or claim which arises from or is produced in relation to” the
Contract” (Decision on Jurisdiction, para. 142). The Tribunal further concluded that

the Claimants’ case under Article 3(4) was inadmissible because

“(1) In Article 9(1) of the Contract the parties agreed to a legally binding
exclusive jurisdiction clause which provided for the resolution of “any
conflict, controversy or claim which arises from or is produced in relation to
[the] Contract” only by the Tribunals of the City of Asuncién;

(2) Article 3(4) of the BIT does not override the exclusive jurisdiction clause
of Article 9(1) of the Contract;

(3) “the fundamental basis of the claim” presented by BIVAC in respect of
Article 3(4) of the BIT concerns a “conflict, controversy or claim” arising
from or produced in relation to the Contract;

(4) having regard to the need to respect the autonomy of the parties, BIVAC
cannot rely on the Contract as the basis of a claim under Article 3(4) of the
BIT when the Contract itself refers that claim exclusively to another forum,
in the absence of exceptional reasons which might make the contractual
forum unavailable;

(5) the proper forum for the resolution of the contractual claim that has been

raised under Article 3(4) of the BIT is the Tribunals of the City of Asuncién,
applying the law of Paraguay.” (Decision on Jurisdiction, Para. 159)

Against the background of these findings, it is apparent that the parties to the Contract

decided that it would be a matter for the tribunals of the City of Asuncién to determine

 

41 Exhibit CE-132.

101

237.

238.

whether or not Paraguay was in breach of any obligations under the Contract,
including the amounts that it might be owing to the Claimant. It is not for this Tribunal
to make findings of law as to the interpretation and application of the Contract to the
facts. That said, the Tribunal is bound to note that the National Customs Office
concluded, in its Report of 30 March 2005, that “all possible claims with respect to the
compliance or non-compliance with the contract signed by the Minister of Finance and
Bivac Paraguay S.A. have already been reported, debated, refuted and dismissed by
either the Public Prosecutor or by the General Comptroller of the Republic”, and that
the Public Prosecutor and the Comptroller of the Republic had “concluded that all of

[the Contract’s] clauses had been complied with” by the Claimant.” On the basis of

 

the record before the Tribunal, it does not see any real possibility of new facts or legal

arguments emerging so long into the dispute that could now change this conclusion.

On this basis, it appears an inescapable conclusion on the basis of the record of
evidence before the Tribunal that Paraguay has an outstanding debt to the Claimant
under the Contract, and that it has, since 2005 at least, failed without proper
justification to make payment on that debt. Putting it another way, the Tribunal
concludes that the evidence demonstrates that the heart of the dispute that is before it
concerns “a persistent failure to make payment on an outstanding debt.” Having
carefully examined each and every act that is complained of by the Claimant — from
Minister Zayas’ letter of 14 June 1999 to Decree No.10485 adopted by the Ministry of
the Interior on 22 June 2007 — the Tribunal concludes that each act is essentially about
the failure to make the payment that is owed. A generous interpretation of the facts
would conclude that before March 2005, each act could be said to concern the issue of
assessing whether there was an outstanding debt on which payment was due. After the
publication of the Report of March 2005 there was no need for any further assessment,
as the validity of the debt had, in effect, been recognized by the relevant Paraguayan
authorities, and a payment was recognized as being owed. From March 2005, there

has been a straightforward refusal to pay, without any apparent justification.

The Tribunal therefore concludes that the conduct that lies at the heart of the dispute,

and which has been repeated over time in particular since March 2005, is the refusal

102

on the part of Paraguay to pay an outstanding debt that is owed under the Contract.

4.3.3.2 The characterization of the conduct: non-performance of Contract or exercise of
sovereign authority

239. The Tribunal turns therefore next to the issue of how to characterize Paraguay’s

conduct. Is the persistent refusal to pay an outstanding debt under the Contract a

sovereign act, as the Claimant argues, or merely an act that an ordinary contracting

party could have engaged in, as Paraguay argues?

240. It is important to recognize that beyond the refusal to pay there are no other acts that

the Claimant really seeks to remedy. Whilst Paraguay has not paid a contractual debt

that it has recognized since March 2005 as being owed, the Claimant has not argued

that it has interfered in any other way with the Claimant’s rights under the Contract.

There is no allegation that Paraguay has, for example, by legislation or other means,

sought to take any steps to interfere with other rights under the Contract, or that it has

sought to prevent or otherwise limit the Claimant’s rights of access to the tribunals of

the City of Asuncion. There is no claim of the taking of a right under the Contract or

of the Contract’s unlawful discontinuance. There is no claim of harassment or

interference with the Claimant’s right to be present in Paraguay, through its

representatives, or to carry on such commercial activities as it wishes to engage in. It

is impossible to escape the conclusion that this

 

‘ase is, in its totality and however

valiantly the Claimant might otherwise seek to characterise it, about the non-payment

of an outstanding debt under a Contract.

241. It is also apparent that Paraguay has not availed itself of the kinds of powers that are

normally available to a sovereign if it wishes to interfere with the rights of an ordinary

party. No legislation or regulatory acts have been adopted, no police powers used, no

judgment of any court has been ignored. These are the kinds of powers that frequently

characterise claims relating to unfair or inequitable treatment in international

investment law. They typically require the exercise of powers that are simply not

available to the ordinary contracting party. Yet no such act has been complained of in

103

242.

243.

the present case. It is therefore not immediately apparent that any of the conduct
complained of by the Claimant might not equally have been adopted by a contracting
party which was not a sovereign: the initial refusal to pay, the commissioning of one
internal report after another, the contradictory decisions of different departments, the
involvement of the chief executive, and so on. There is nothing inherent in the fact that
such conduct is undertaken by a State in its capacity as a contracting party that might
as such endow them with the quality of sovereign acts such as to catalyse
responsibility under an international treaty obligation relating to fair and equitable
treatment. There has been no reliance by Paraguay on the powers of a public authority
that might not — by analogous means — also be available to a private person or
corporation. Attempts to mislead, distort, conceal or otherwise confuse a contractual

partner are strategies open to and used by both public and private persons.

It is equally not apparent to the Tribunal that the mere passage of time can have the
effect of transforming an act (or acts) that any private person could perform into a
sovereign act. The Tribunal does not see how time alone, coupled with the repetition
of the conduct, could as such transform the act of a sovereign contracting party into an
exercise of sovereign authority. “We will not pay” means “we will not pay”, whether it
is said in Year | or in Year 8. The fact that eight years may have passed does not as
such change the characterisation of the conduct. An act that breaches a contract
remains that - and that alone - whether it has been done once in a single year or twenty

times over eight years.

In this regard, the Tribunal is bound to note the manner in which the case was framed
in the original Request for Arbitration submitted to ICSID on 16 February 2007. Part
Ill of the Request is entitled ‘The Facts Relevant to the Dispute’, and it is in three
sections. Section B is entitled “Paraguay’s Failure to Pay Amounts Due Under the
Contract”, and it runs to eight paragraphs. The only acts alleged to give rise to the
violation of the Treaty concern the alleged failure to make payments owing under the
Contract. Paragraph 33 of the Request, for example, which addresses violations of the
Treaty, states that “The Ministry of Finance’s conduct in failing to pay amounts due to
BIVAC under the Contract [...] is attributable to Paraguay and engages its state
responsibility under international law and the Treaty” (emphasis added). The Tribunal

notes that no acts - either in relation to rights under the Contract or the availability of
104

244.

245.

the contractually agreed forum for the resolution of disputes under the Contract - are
complained of in the Request. It is true that the Claimant has reserved to itself, in the
paragraph that follows, the right to supplement or amend its claims, and that over the
course of the proceedings its case has indeed evolved and changed. This seems to have

occurred in order to accommodate the views expressed by the Tribunal in its Decision

  

on Jurisdiction. This is reflected, for example, in the Claimant’s Reply on the Merits,

where it’s case has been re

   

t to contradict the claim in the Request, stating that:

“BIVAC is not complaining here of its failure to recover its investment
through payment of a contractual debt in January 1999. Rather, it is
complaining about its loss of investment through Paraguay’s conduct in the
following decade — successive governments distancing themselves from an
earlier obligation for their own political interests, one after another —
resulting in effective repudiation”. *°

The Claimant is of course entitled to seek to recast the facts in another light, and to
present them in a different way. The Tribunal is not persuaded, however, that the
Claimant got it wrong in its Request for Arbitration, or that the facts are in reality
different from the way in which they were originally characterised by the Claimant. As

explained in detail in its Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, the Tribunal holds that

 

these fi

 

cannot sustain a claim for a loss of investment due to Paraguay’s conduct,
since there was no allegation that the Contract was unlawfully interfered with except
in relation to a payment that is said to be due under the Contract. The Contract was
lawfully discontinued, and the Claimant’s right to have recourse to the contractually
agreed forum for the resolution of its claim has not been interfered with, whether by
way of exercise of puissance publique or otherwise. The facts show that this dispute
is indeed about Paraguay’s “failing to pay amounts due to BIVAC under the Contract”,
as the Claimant put the matter in it’s Application, no more and no less. The record
cannot sustain a claim that the facts concern conduct that gave rise to a loss of
investment. The investment came to an end, and it is not in dispute that it did so in

accordance with the Contract and therefore lawfully.

Accordingly, we now turn to the consequences of our conclusion that this dispute is, at
its heart, only about the non-payment of a contractual debt. We are bound to inquire

whether the breach of contract is “the result of behaviour going beyond that which an

463 BIVAC Reply on the Merits, para. 5.

105

246.

247.

ordinary contracting party could adopt”, and whether the actions of Paraguay are those
not of a mere contracting party but those of a sovereign exercising public powers

‘puissance publique’ .

The Parties are divided on a great number of issues, but they appear to agree that for
Paraguay to be liable for a violation of Article 3(1) it must be shown that it acted in a
manner that is qualitatively different from an ordinary contracting party. In fact, by its
very nature an act that breaches a contract is likely to contradict an initial
representation of one of the parties to the contract, and the act may occur for
undisclosed reasons or without transparency or pursuant to bad faith of the party in
breach. This is the daily lot and misfortune of commercial life, giving rise to a great
number of commercial proceedings in law. States are not exempt from this type of
conduct. It can be part of the unfair or unreasonable treatment that may be meted out
to a private partner in a contractual relationship. Such behaviour under a contract,
however, cannot as such give rise to a violation of an obligation established by Treaty
governed by international law. All the characterisations that have been invoked to
characterize unfair and unreasonable treatment in international law and which the
Claimant has argued and which the Respondent denies having occurred —
arbitrariness, lack of transparency, negligence, inconsistency, bad faith, the frustration
of legitimate expectations, the introduction of unreasonable measures — occur in
exercise of sovereign authority over and above acts that constitute mere breach of
contract. Something more than mere breach of contract is needed. This might occur,
for example, if the State agreed to the jurisdiction of its national courts for the
resolution of a contractual dispute and then acted to limit effective access to such

courts.

Bearing these considerations in mind, both Parties have devoted considerable attention
to the issue of whether the conduct of Paraguay that is the subject of this dispute is to
be characterised as the exercise of sovereign authority (puissance publique), and as
such the kind of acts that could give rise to Paraguay’s liability for a violation of
Article 3(1) of the BIT. It is no surprise that they adopt markedly different approaches

and conclusions.

106

248.

249.

250.

The Claimant argues that the acts for which Paraguay is responsible amount to an
exercise of sovereign authority. On its approach, the characterization of Paraguay’s
conduct is to be addressed principally by reference to the motivation of the acts that
are the subject of the dispute. The Claimant argues that “conduct surrounding the
contract breach” is to be treated as an exercise of sovereign authority where the
conduct “is politically motivated [...] without the existence of any genuine good faith
dispute under the underlying contract.” On its approach, where the “State’s breach of
contract is the consequence of the political convenience of the government in power
then it ceases to be a mere contractual breach and constitutes a parallel breach of the

FET standard.” According to the Claimant,

“[t]he key distinction between a mere commercial breach of contract and a
breach of FET does not depend on how actions or measures may be labeled.
It depends on whether the parties to a State contract are engaged in a genuine
difference of opinion in respect of the scope or interpretation of their
respective contractual rights or a good-faith exercise (or breach) of such
rights. If so, then that is a simple contractual dispute that should be resolved
by the contractual dispute resolution mechanism. However, if the state is not
engaged in such a good faith discussion and simply asserts political excuses
for its failure to comply in an arbitrary manner then the dispute is a ripe FET
claim. This distinction is at the essence of what has sometimes been called
the exercise (or not) of ‘puissance publique’.

On the Claimant’s assessment of the facts, Paraguay’s act of “non-payment of the debt
obeys political reasons and is not based on any good faith contractual or commercial
cause”, and is motivated by reasons of “political convenience”, namely the desire not
to take responsibility for obligations assumed by a previous government.*” According
to the Claimant, the facts show “that Paraguay did not fail to pay the debt to BIVAC
due to the existence of any good faith contractual dispute” and thus finds

“no reasonable foundation in private law rights, and cannot be labelled as

commercial. It was motivated by governmental or political reasons which
have nothing to do with the Contract itself.“°”

In support of the view that the motive for the conduct is the main factor to be taken

into account in ass

 

sing whether conduct is to be treated as an exercise of sovereign
authority, the Claimant relies principally on five decisions: Alpha v. Ukraine;

Kardassopoulos v. Georgia; Rumeli v. Kazakhstan; PSEG v. Turkey; and Eureko v.

253.

Poland. It invokes other awards, including the decisions in Bayindir v. Pakistan;

RFCC v. Morocco; Impregilo v. Pakistan; and Amto v. Ukraine.

For its part, Paraguay adopts a different approach: it considers that the characterization
of conduct as an exercise of sovereign authority turns not on the motivation of the act,
but rather on its nature and distinguishing features. Paraguay invokes the decision of
the Tribunal in Bayindir v Pakistan, to the effect that the distinction between a treaty
breach and a contract violation requires a claimant to “establish a breach different in
nature from a simple contract violation, in other words one which the State commits in
the exercise of its sovereign power.” For the Respondent, the conduct must be of a

nature that is such that a non-sovereign could not engage in it.

For Paraguay, motivation is not the pertinent factor. It argues that “the alleged purpose
of the contract and purported reasons for failing to pay are irrelevant to whether the
acts that form the basis of BIVAC’s claim ... are acts beyond that of an ordinary
contracting party.”*” Rather, it submits that it is the nature of the act that is significant,
and in support of that proposition it invokes authorities drawn from the area of
sovereign immunity which, it argues, recognise that

“the alleged motive for the act is not dispositive; instead, it is the nature of

the act that matters. If the act is of such a nature that it could have been done

by a private party, it is not a sovereign act. Thus, whatever the purported

reasons for refusing to pay under a contract and failing to comply with

purported promises to pay, there has been no sovereign act because any
private party could have engaged in the same conduct.”*””

In support of its approach, Paraguay distinguishes the authorities relied upon by the
Claimant and invokes a number of other authorities. It argues that all the cases relied
upon by the Claimant in support of its view that motive is the defining factor in fact
show that “‘a sovereign act occurs when the State uses its police, adjudicatory, or
legislative powers to the detriment of the rights of the claimant”; according to
Paraguay, in this case no such act has occurred.*" Paraguay further argues that the

Claimant has not presented evidence to establish that Paraguay’s failure to pay the

468 Paraguay Post-Hearing Brief, para. 7, citing Bayindir v. Pakistan, para 180.

255.

contractual debt was politically motivated, and that no witness testified that Paraguay
withheld payment out of political considerations and no documents prove that the

government was so motivated. BIVAC merely relies on innuendo and supposition.*”

The Tribunal turns now to its own approach. It has paid very close attention to the
arguments of the Parties. The characterization of conduct — does it amount to an
exercise of sovereign authority or is it of the kind that an ordinary contracting party
could engage in? — is necessarily a matter that turns on the facts of each particular
case. This is evident from the numerous decisions invoked by both Parties in support
of their respective arguments. The Tribunal considers that it is useful to carefully look
at those authorities, and it has done so. But it is also conscious that this is a matter that
largely turns on the appreciation of facts, and that it is not for the Tribunal to substitute

its view of the fi

 

of any of these authorities for those of the respective tribunal
reaching the decision, given their proximity to the arguments raised by the parties, and

to the evidence in the factual record. In examining these cases, the Tribunal has

 

therefore sought to understand the approach of each tribunal in assessing the facts,
with a view to understanding whether the decision reached focused on the motive
behind the conduct, as the Claimant argues, or on the nature of the conduct, as
Paraguay argues, or on a combination of these two elements. The Tribunal is bound to
note, before embarking on this review, that in no case that was argued before it has an
arbitral tribunal ruled that the non-payment of an outstanding contractual debt could —
taken alone — be characterized as an exercise of sovereign authority such as to give
rise to a violation of an obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment to an

investor.

substantive due process during the proceedings of the compensation commission,
which was a substitute for the dispute settlement process which the claimants argued
they were entitled to have access to but which they had not invoked. The Claimant
relies on the award to argue that, like the claimants in that case, it had a legitimate
expectation that Paraguay would “implement [a] compensation process that was

procedurally and substantively fair.”**

The Tribunal notes that the facts are distinguishable from the present case. The
claimants were not parties to a contract, and the tribunal did not invoke the availability
of any contractual remedies otherwise available to the entity in which they were
investors. At the heart of that case was an act of expropriation, which by its very
nature is conduct that only a State can engage in and which is, almost be definition, an
example of the exercise of sovereign authority. Moreover, the act of establishing an
adjudicatory ad hoc body to deliberate on and award compensation for the
expropriation is necessarily an act that only a sovereign entity can engage in: the act of
expropriation and consequential actions are not the acts of an entity acting as a

contracting party.

The Kardassopolous tribunal devotes twenty-four paragraphs to its assessment of the

 

obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment, and its conclusion that Georgia
violated its obligation to provide such treatment.”* A careful reading of those
paragraphs makes clear that the tribunal’s conclusion was based on the tribunal’s
finding that, following the act of expropriation, Georgia made “specific assurances of
compensation”, which assurances “gave rise to a specific expectation of
compensation” against the background of “the legitimate expectation that Georgia
would conduct itself vis-a-vis his investment in a manner that was reasonably
justifiable and did not manifestly violate basic requirements of consistency,
transparency, even-handedness and non-discrimination”.*” In the end no compensation

was forthcoming.

260.

The facts in the present case are plainly distinguishable. In the present case there was
no act of expropriation and no assurances were given by Paraguay that were
equivalent to those offered by Georgia. The tribunal in Kardassopolous does not in
terms address the issue of puissance publique, and whether its existence (or not) is to
be determined by reference to the nature of the conduct or its motivation. However, it
is evident from a close reading of the award that it was the nature of Georgia’s actions
— the acts of expropriation, establishment of a compensation commission and offering
of assurances that compensation would be forthcoming — that underpinned the ruling
that Georgia had violated the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment.
Having identified the nature of the acts, only then did the tribunal turn to the issue of
the arbitrariness of Georgia’s conduct. The tribunal did not seek to justify its finding

by reference to the motive of the actions.

477

Rumeli v. Kazakhstan*” In the Rumeli case the tribunal concluded that there had been a

 

violation of the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment in circumstances
where Kazakhstan terminated an investment contract to which it was a party before its
expiration date, without previously suspending the contract as its terms required.
According to the tribunal, such conduct amounted to a breach of the obligation to
provide fair and equitable treatment (which was incorporated by means of a most-
favoured nation clause) because it was “arbitrary, unfair, unjust, lacked in due process
and did not respect the investor’s reasonable and legitimate expectations." The
arbitral tribunal further ruled that the subsequent process that led to the decision of a
working group created to assess the termination of the contract “lacked transparency
and due process and was unfair, in contradiction with the requirements of the fair and
equitable treatment principle”, and that “since the Working Group acted as an organ of
the State, the violation amounts to a breach of the BIT by the Republic of
Kazakhstan.”*”

It cannot be said that this aspect of the award is overly burdened by the weight of its
reasoning. The tribunal does not indicate whether it is the nature of the conduct — the

termination of the investment contract coupled with the creation and operation of the

working group “as an organ of the State” — or its motivation that caused it to reach the
conclusion that it did. The Tribunal does not see, therefore, that either Party in the
present case can obtain much assistance from this somewhat de minimis award. From
the published award, however, it does appear that the Respondent made no arguments
as regards puissance publique or the characterization of Kazakhstan’s conduct in
relation to its contractual obligations. It is also apparent that the claimants had no
contract with Kazakhstan, and accordingly the state owed no contractual obligation to
the claimants, and no contractually agreed forum was therefore available to the
claimants to pursue any claim. The tribunal did not identify or engage with the issues
that arise in the present case, which appears also to be distinguishable in the sense that
the Rumeli case went beyond a mere failure to pay an outstanding debt under a
contract in circumstances in which a remedy for violations of the contract remained

available.

PSEG v. Turkey” In PSEG the tribunal ruled that Turkey had violated its obligations

 

to provide fair and equitable treatment as a result of a series of actions of the State
that were serious enough to give rise to liability. The tribunal found that Turkey had
demonstrated “evident negligence [...] in the handling of the negotiations with the
Claimants”, had engaged in “abuse of authority” in seeking to renegotiate the contract
that governed the relations between the parties in a manner that went “far beyond” the
purpose of the applicable law and the relevant public body’s “authority”, “ignore[d]
rights granted by law as a matter of policy or practice”, ignored a decision of the
Turkish Constitutional Court “upholding the rights acquired under a contract”, and
engaged in constant changes in legislation that had a “‘roller-coaster’ effect of [...]

4st

continuing legislative changes.

It is apparent from the award — which followed a decision on jurisdiction in which the
tribunal had already concluded that “[t]he nature of the dispute is [...] not that of a
typical contractual dispute’? — that the tribunal was addressing conduct that no
ordinary contractual party could engage in, and that in any event went far beyond the

mere failure to pay an outstanding debt under a contract. The case is therefore plainly

distinguishable from the present case, since the conduct of Turkey as a commercial
partner, rather than a sovereign regulator, was not the basis of the tribunal’s

conclusions.

Alpha v. Ukraine*’ In this case, the arbitral tribunal found that Ukraine had interfered
with a contractual relationship between claimant and a third party, in a manner that
effectively negated agreements under the contract and directly interfered with the day-
to-day management of the company in which the claimant had invested.‘ In

circumstances in which the Ukraine was not a party to the contract, the question of

 

whether the State was acting in exercise of sovereign authority or as a contracting

party did not arise. For this reason the award is of no relevance to the issue we face.

Eureko v Poland‘ In the Eureko case the Council of Ministers of Poland adopted a
Resolution on 2 April 2002 which prevented Eureko, the claimant in that case, from
acquiring from the State Treasury an additional 21% of the shares in the entity in
which it had invested, thereby preventing it form acquiring the controlling interest in
the newly privatized company (PZU) that it had expected to gain. By a majority, the
tribunal interpreted this act, and others that followed as a consequence, as evidence
that Poland had “consciously and knowingly, decided to violate the investment of
Eureko in PZU by refusing to honour its legal commitments”, and these acts
“frustrated the investment of Eureko in PZU” (including Poland’s commitment to

allow it to obtain a controlling stake in PZU) and violated its rights as a shareholder.***

It is evident that the majority in the Eureko case founded its decision on the resolution
adopted by Poland’s Council of Ministers, which is self evidently a sovereign act
going beyond what a party to a contract might engage in. By that resolution Poland’s
Council of Ministers “resolved that it was essential for the state Treasury to maintain
control over [PZU] and [...] consented to a change in the privatization strategy for

[PZU].”**’ The resolution also “obligated the State Treasurer to advise ambassadors of

actions that are not of a nature that can be adopted by an ordinary contracting party.
The Tribunal notes that in the present case the conduct that is complained of is

qualitatively different.

Other cases Numerous other cases have also been cited, by one or other Party. In
Bayindir v. Pakistan, for example, the tribunal found that there was no breach of the
obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment, and found inter alia that a failure to

make payments under the contract at issue in this dispute could be characterized as

 

being based on “a reasonable contractual explanation.’ This is a point on which the
Claimant relies. The Tribunal notes, however, that there is nothing in the award to
indicate that the mere failure to pay an amount owing under a contract could, as such
and taken alone, gives rise to an obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment. The
same point may be made in relation to RFCC v. Morocco” and Noble Ventures v.
Romania.*' Another case referred to is AMTO v Ukraine,** which was not a dispute

between the claimant and the State under the contract, but alleged conduct on the part

of the Ukraine that was said to have caused the entity in which the claimant had

 

invested to be unable to recover certain debts. On the basis of the evidence the tribunal
rejected the claim, but this Tribunal notes in any event there is nothing in the award to
support the proposition that the mere failure of a State that is a party to a contract to
pay an outstanding debt on the contract could, of itself, amount to a breach of a treaty

obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment.

From this review of the case law it is apparent that, in determining whether conduct of
a State violates an obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment, arbitral tribunals

do not neces

 

arily adopt a uniform or completely consistent approach, and only rarely
engage in an explicit consideration of whether the conduct in question constitutes an
exercise of sovereign authority. Indeed, that issue inevitably arises only when the State
is itself a party to a contract and the relationship between an alleged breach of a

contract and/or treaty is in issue, and it is necessary to determine whether the conduct

270.

goes beyond that of a contracting party, in the sense identified by the tribunal in the

Impregilo case.

Across the range of cases, it is apparent also that in assessing conduct arbitral tribunals
consider both the nature of the act and its motivation. To the extent that any sort of
general approach can be discerned, it seems that tribunals adopt a two step process,
whether explicitly or implicitly: first they address the nature of conduct; second,
assuming the conduct to be such as to give rise to the possibility of a breach of the
obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment, they address whether it meets the
requirement not to be arbitrary or discriminatory or otherwise unfair or inequitable.
That second element necessarily requires an assessment of motive, but it is plain that
the motive that explains particular conduct is treated as being distinct from, and

informing of, its nature.

In the present case the real issue the Tribunal is faced with is the determination of
whether a refusal to pay an outstanding contractual debt can by its nature constitute a
sovereign act, in the sense of being conduct that an ordinary contracting party cannot
engage in. The Tribunal notes that the Claimant has not been able to identify a single
case in which a tribunal has ruled that the non-payment of an outstanding debt by a
State (or statal body) could be characterised as an exercise of sovereign authority. This
is true too even if the non-payment is said to be persistent and unjustified under the
contract. In cases in which a violation of a contractual obligation has formed the basis
of a finding that the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment has been
violated, the conduct in relation to the contract has been accompanied by some other
act or conduct that the respective tribunal has determined to be an exercise of
sovereign authority: the act of expropriation in the Kardassopolous case is an

example.

The Tribunal concludes therefore that it is necessary to look at the nature of the
conduct in question. In the present case, the failure to pay the outstanding debt was an
act of Paraguay dating back to at least 1999. At that moment, the conduct was the

simple failure to pay the debt: to carry out an assessment of whether the debt was due,

 

v, Ukraine}.

115

271.

272.

273.

and if so to instruct the relevant body to authorize a payment on the amount and then
to pay the amount. That conduct continued until 2005, when the debt was
acknowledged. Throughout that period, the conduct in question concerned the failure
to pay the debt under the contract. Thereafter, the acknowledgment of the debt by the
State — or elements of it — cannot transform the nature of the conduct, which remains a
continuing failure to pay the debt and no more. If that acknowledgement had been
accompanied by other acts of Paraguay that interfered with the Claimant’s ability to
recover the debt — for example by an exercise of sovereign authority interfering with
the availability of the contractually agreed forum for the resolution of disputes
concerning the amount owing under the Contract — the situation may be different. But
there were no such acts. The Tribunal notes too that the Claimant has not been able to
cite any authority for the proposition that international law imposes any obligation as

such on a State to pay moneys owing under a contract.

Against the Claimant’s argument, there are other authorities that support the
conclusion that the non-payment of a contractual debt cannot as such be characterised
as an exercise of sovereign authority such as to give rise to a liability for a failure to

meet the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment.

In Waste Management v. Mexico the arbitral tribunal in a case under the North
American Free Trade Agreement had to decide whether Mexico had violated the
claimant’s right to fair an equitable treatment under Article 1105 NAFT. The tribunal

ruled:

“For present purposes it is sufficient to say that even the persistent non-
payment of debts by a municipality is not to be equated with a violation of
Article 1105, provided that it does not amount to an outright and unjustified
repudiation of the transaction and provided that some remedy is open to the
creditor to address the problem.”*”*

In the Tribunal’s view that conclusion applies equally to the consideration of Article
3(1) of the BIT in the present case. The reason is that such conduct does not go beyond
that in which an ordinary contracting party could engage. Such conduct coupled with

repudiation of the trans: ‘tion,

 

ction, or interference with other rights under the trans:

 

including the right of access to the contractual remedy, would tend to transform the

116

274.

275.

conduct beyond that which an ordinary contracting party could engage in. No such
additional conduct exists in the present case, and it has not been argued — and cannot

reasonably be argued - that there has been a repudiation of the Contract.

The second pertinent case is Parkerings v. Lithuania, where the tribunal was faced
with the issue of the relationship between a breach of a contract and the obligation to

provide fair and equitable treatment. The tribunal ruled that

“[uJnder certain limited circumstances, a substantial breach of a contract
could constitute a violation of a treaty. So far, case law has offered very few
illustrations of such a situation. In most cases, a preliminary determination by
a competent court as to whether the contract was breached under municipal
law is necessary. This preliminary determination is even more necessary if
the parties to the contract have agreed on a specific forum for all disputes
arising out of the contract.

L.1

 

However, if the contracting-party is denied access to domestic courts, and
thus denied opportunity to obtain redress of the injury and to complain about
those contractual breaches, then an arbitral tribunal is in position, on the basis
of the BIT, to decide whether this lack of remedies had consequences on the
investment and thus whether a violation of international law occurred. In
other words, as a general rule, a tribunal whose jurisdiction is based solely on
a BIT will decide over the “treatment” that the alleged breach of contract has
received in the domestic context, rather than over the existence of a breach as
such.”

This Tribunal too does not exclude the possibility that there may be circumstances in
which a substantial breach of a contract could, as such, give rise a breach of an
obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment. To make such a case a claimant
would have to point to a requirement of international law imposing an obligation to
comply with a contract and persuade a tribunal that such a requirement was part of the
obligation to provide such treatment. The fact that no authority has been brought to the
Tribunal’s attention and which identifies an example of such a situation indicates that
it will be rare, assuming that it could ever arise. Even if it did arise, the continued

unhindered availability of a contra

 

tually agreed forum for the resolution of the
dispute under the contract would be a significant factor imposing an additional hurdle

for a claimant to overcome were it to make such an argument.

277.

Having concluded that this dispute is premised on Paraguay’s failure to make a
payment of a debt owing under the Contract it entered into with the Claimant, the
Tribunal further concludes that Paraguay’s failure to pay that outstanding debt,
including in particular in the period after March 2005, cannot properly be
characterized as an exercise of sovereign authority. It is, in the Tribunal’s view,
conduct that an ordinary private party to a contract might also engage in. The fact that
the failure is persistent cannot change the character of the conduct. Nor can the fact
that the failure appears to be wholly unjustified transform the nature of the conduct
into the exercise of sovereign authority. Taking the Claimant’s case at its highest, the
bottom line is that Paraguay has refused to pay sums owing to the Claimant under the
Contract. That failure, which turns on the facts established in the record, cannot as a
matter of law amount to an exercise of sovereign authority. In the Tribunal’s view the
facts show “mere breach by a State of a contract with an alien (whose proper law is
not international law)” and that accordingly no violation of Article 3(1) of the BIT
arises.”* As the Impregilo Tribunal put the point in respect of one aspect of the case

before it:

“These are matters that concern the implementation of the Contracts, and do
not involve any issue beyond the application of a contract, and the conduct of
contracting parties. In particular, the matter does not concern any exercise of
“puissance publique” by the State.”

It follows from this that the Respondent’s failure to pay its debt may be one of the

 

prerequisites for determining that a State might be liable for a breach of an obligation
to provide fair and equitable treatment but that the other essential prerequisite for such
violation, i.e. the exercise of sovereign power, has not been satisfied. Putting this
conclusion another way, the Tribunal finds that the case is a contractual dispute, no
more and no less. A forum for the resolution of contractual disputes has been agreed
by the Parties to the Contract. The right to have access to that forum — the tribunals of
the City of Asuncién - remains fully available, and has not been interfered with by
Paraguay in exercise of sovereign authority (or otherwise). There is nothing in the

record of evidence to indicate that the Claimant was somehow induced — whether by

Justice in International Law, 425, 431 (1994).

contracting party does not “interfere” with a contract; it “performs” it. If it performs the contract badly, this will not result in
a breach of the provisions of the Treaty relating to expropriation or nationalisation, unless it be proved that the State or its
emanation has gone beyond its role asa mere party to the contract, and has exercised the specific functions of a sovereign
authority.”)

representations or other means made by or on behalf of Paraguay - not to bring
proceedings before the tribunals of the City of Asuncién. The Claimant has chosen not
to avail itself of its rights under the Contract to have access to that forum. When asked
during the hearing why it had taken that decision, counsel on its behalf characterised

the choice as “a commercial decision.”*”

The Claimant raises arguments concerning the lack of independence and the general
inadequacy of the tribunals of the City of Asunci6n as a forum for the resolution of the
contractual dispute. The Tribunal notes that the Request for Arbitration made no such
claim when it was submitted in 2007. It was only by the Claimant’s Memorial dated
27 November 2009 and at the hearing that any evidence was tendered in relation to the
matter, and that related to allegations of lack of judicial independence long after the
dispute had arisen, and many years after the Claimant could have brought its case to

the tribunals of the City of Asuncién.

In addressing this matter, the Tribunal has asked itself whether there are any aspects of
Paraguay’s conduct in failing to pay outstanding debts under the Contract that could
not be fully remedied in proceedings before the tribunals of the City of Asuncién. At
this point in time, it sees none. As noted above, in its Request for Arbitration the
Claimant itself characterised its claim as being to recover payment of a debt owing
under a contract. It did not request this Tribunal to provide any other relief, and it did
not assert that Paraguay had otherwise interfered with its contractual rights, for
example by interfering with the availability of the contractually agreed forum for
disputes relating to the Contract. The Tribunal recognizes, however, that the
Claimant’s allegations that “the lack of independence of the Paraguayan courts is
notorious”,*’* and that the court system is corrupt, slow and cost-intensive, are serious
allegations. A cornerstone for the distinction of the non-payment of a contractual debt
as being either a breach of contract or — in addition — a violation of a treaty obligation
is the question of whether the State acted in the exercise of its sovereign power. One of
the expressions of such power would be an intereference with the functioning of the
agreed dispute resolution mechanism before national courts, or the failure to ensure

that such courts function in a manner that is independent and effective, and gives

284.

rulings solely on the basis of law. A deviation from generally accepted principles in the
functioning of the tribunals of the City of Asuncién would be relevant to the

assessment of an alleged violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard.

On the basis of the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that, at this point in time,
Paraguay has not, by its failure to make payment on the outstanding debt under the
Contract, violated Article 3(1) of the BIT. It notes that a lack of effectiveness of the
agreed contractual dispute resolution mechanism might give rise to a different

conclusion

Having so concluded, the Tribunal proceeds to consider the consequences of this

Decision.

3.3 Recourse to the tribunals of the City of Asuncién

As set out above, it has been a central part of the Tribunal’s consideration that the
tribunals of the City of Asuncién were available to the Claimant from the moment the
dispute arose until the date on which the Request for arbitration was filed. As noted at
paragraphs 38 to 41 of this Decision, the Tribunal invited the Parties to express views
as to whether the Claimant's contractual claims were now time barred according to
Paraguayan law. In their responses, both Parties agreed that the tribunals of the City of
Asunci6n continue to be available to the Claimant in respect of its claims under the
Contract, on the grounds that any period of limitation that might have been applicable
was interrupted before it had ended. It follows from this that, if it wishes to do so, the

Claimant can still ave recourse to those tribunals to pursue its contractual claim.

Until now, the Claimant has apparently not wished to avail itself of its right under the
Contract to have recourse to the tribunals of the City of Asuncién. It may now wish to
do so, and the Tribunal considers it appropriate to have a limited period within which

to avail itself of this right.

The Tribunal will therefore stay these proceedings for a limited period of three

 

#8 BIVAC Memorial, para 153.

120

months, within which the Claimant may wish to exercise its right to have recourse to
the Asuncion tribunals. If the Claimant does not avail itself of this possibility, the
Tribunal will thereafter render its Award and terminate these proceedings. In the event
that the Claimant does avail itself of the possibility, the Tribunal will retain
jurisdiction over these proceedings for a reasonable period of time, to allow the
tribunals of Asuncién to hear the Claimant’s claim. The Tribunal considers that it will
be appopriate for the Claimant to inform the Tribunal at the latest three months after
the date of this Decisionwhether it has chosen to pursue its claim before the tribunals
of the City of Asuncion. In the event it does pursue such a claim, the Parties are
directed to report to the Tribunal, separately or jointly, on the status of those
proceedings at intervals of six months. The first report will be due six months after the

date of this Decision.

285. In this regard, the Tribunal is bound to note that on the basis of the arguments
presented in these proceedings, the claim for payment under the Contract would
appear to be straightforward and should not admit of any undue delay in its
adjudication by the tribunals of the City of Asuncién. In the event that such a claim
is made, the Tribunal expects that Paraguay will not introduce any new factual
elements in defending its claim or invoke the statute of limitation which it assures
has not lapsed. The Tribunal further expects that Paraguay will not avail itself of
any procedures that are aimed at introducing any inappropriate delays or other
obstacles to the timely and efficient exercise of jurisdiction by the tribunals of the
City of Asuncién in dealing fairly with the claims for outstanding payments under
the Contract. In the event that Paraguay or any of its organs, including the courts,
fail to address any such claim in accordance with the requirements of Article 3(1)

of the Treaty, the Claimant will be free to make an application to this Tribunal.

286. The Tribunal would be surprised if the resolution of the outstanding contractual
dispute should provide any degree of difficulty before the tribunals of the City of
Asunci6n. The issues of contractual breach have been very fully argued before this
Tribunal. As noted above, the Customs Office has concluded, without ambiguity,
that the Claimant performed its obligations and that it was, in effect, entitled to be
paid what it is owed under the Contract, and both Parties agree that the claim is not
time barred

121

5. Article 3(4) of the Treaty

287.

288.

289.

290.

In its first Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, in relation to the claim made
under Article 3(4) of the Treaty the Tribunal joined to the merits the issue of
whether the consequence of the decision on inadmissibility is that the claim should
be dismissed or the exercise of jurisdiction stayed and had invited the Parties to
submit its arguments with respect to the consequences of the inadmissibility of the

claim.

The Claimant asserts that the Tribunal has the power to order a stay of the proceedings

 

and that it would be appropriate to deal with admissibility issues. It argues that since

the issue is not absolute and only a temporary obstacle, BIVAC should be granted the
opportunity to initiate local proceedings under the contractual dispute settlement
mechanism with the Tribunal exercising an ongoing “supervisory function”:

“[T]here would be little point in dismissing jurisdiction here if, should

BIVAC attempt to overcome the admissibility obstacle by resorting to local

remedies, it became obvious very quickly that those remedies are blocked,

ineffective or futile, or if Paraguay acts unfairly and uncooperatively in those

proceedings. That is, the admissibility issue identified by the Tribunal could

well fade away fairly quickly. If in the meantime the claim is dismissed as

inadmissible, BIVAC would have to restart the process that it commenced

almost three years ago.”*””
The Respondent argues that a stay “would serve no real purpose in light of the
Tribunal’s prior holding as to that claim’s inadmissibility” and that it would only
confuse the specificities of contractual claims and treaty claims. It therefore pleads for

500

 

the dismissal of this part of the case.
The Tribunal considers that a continued stay of the proceedings is the appropriate way
forward, being a cost-effective and efficient in the treatment of the issue of
admissibility. The Parties agree that the contractual dispute solution mechanism is still

available. It is premature to say whether it will be employed by Claimant and— in the

122

event that it is — whether it will meet expectations with regard to the sound
administration of justice The Claimant will inform the Tribunal at the latest three
months after the date of this Decision whether it has chosen to pursue its claim before
the tribunals of the City of Asuncién or not. In case it has, and the Paraguayan courts
have ascertained Claimant’s claim and the Respondent disregarded the decision, the
claim under the umbrella clause might then become admissible, depending on the
circumstances. For these reasons and in view of the decision taken in relation to
Article 3(1), the Tribunal orders the stay of the proceedings with respect to the claim
under Article 3(4) of the BIT.

6. Other matters

291.

292.

The Tribunal is conscious that it might be said that it should have proceeded to give
the relief sought by the Claimant, on the grounds that the Claimant has waited long
enough to be paid on the debt it is owed. That is not a course the Tribunal was entitled

to follow. In entering into the Contract, the Claimant agreed by its Article 9(1) that

 

“any conflict, controversy or claim which from or is produced in relation to this
Contract, non compliance, resolution or invalidity shall be submitted to the Tribunals
of the City of Asuncién pursuant to Paraguayan Law.” The decision not to avail itself
of rights under Article 9(1) was taken by the Claimant and by it alone, without any
inducement, and on its own account for “commercial reasons.” In that respect, such

delays as have arisen are therefore the responsibility of the Claimant alone.

The function of an arbitral tribunal established under the BIT, like any arbitral tribunal
established in relation to ICSID and other investment treaty proceedings, is to apply
the law in relation to the matters agreed by the States that adopted the BIT, in this case
the Netherlands and Paraguay. It is not the function of arbitrators who are charged
with interpreting and applying a treaty to go beyond the limits of what that treaty
allows them to do, whether to do justice or for any other reasons. In its Decision on
Jurisdiction the Tribunal explained why this BIT did not provide remedies for mere
breaches of contractual obligation, in circumstances where the parties to the contract
had agreed on a specific forum to resolve contractual disputes. For this Tribunal to
exercise jurisdiction in relation to a pure contractual dispute, in the circumstances of
this case, would plainly amount to an excess of jurisdiction. The Netherlands and

Paraguay did not agree to allow for the establishment of an arbitral tribunal as a forum
123

for the mere collection of contractual debts except as specified by the BIT. The

jurisdiction of this Tribunal is a limited and exceptional jurisdiction, one that is not

permitted to stray beyond the matters agreed by the Netherlands and Paraguay.

DECISION

For these reasons the Tribunal decides that:

a. BIVAC has

 

nding to bring the claims under Article 3(1) and 3(4) of the BIT;

b. the exercise of jurisdiction in relation to the claims made under Articles 3(1) and
3(4) of the BIT is stayed;

c. the termination of these proceedings is stayed for a period of three months from
the date of this Decision, within which period the Claimant may wish to file
before the tribunals of the City of Asuncién a claim for breach of the Contract in
order to recover the sums owing to it under the Contract and notify the Tribunal
of its course of action, within that period;

d. in the event that such a claim is not filed, the Tribunal shall render its Award and
terminate these proceedings;

e. in the event that such a claim is filed: (i) these proceedings will be stayed further
and the Parties shall be directed to inform the Tribunal, either jointly or
separately, every six months, beginning with the date of this Decision, on the
status of the proceedings before the tribunals of the City of Asunci6n; (ii) the
Claimant shall be free to make a further application in the event that the
tribunals of the City of Asuncién fail to proceed to the adjudication of any such
aclaim in a timely manner and in accordance with the requirements of the
Treaty; and

f. all other questions, including those concerning a potential obligation to pay
interest, the costs and expenses of the Tribunal and the costs of the parties are

reserved for future determination.
