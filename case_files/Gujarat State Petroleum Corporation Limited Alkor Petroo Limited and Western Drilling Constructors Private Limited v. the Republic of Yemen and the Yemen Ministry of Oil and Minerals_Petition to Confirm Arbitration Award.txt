PETITION TO CONFIRM ARBITRAL AWARD

 

Americas 91204124

Case 1:16-cv-01383 Document1 Filed 06/29/16 Page 2 of 9

Petitioners Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation Limited, Alkor Petroo Limited, and
Western Drilling Contractors Private Limited (collectively, “Petitioners”), by and through their
attorneys White & Case LLP, allege as follows:

NATURE OF THE PROCEEDING AND RELIEF SOUGHT

1. Petitioners are commencing this proceeding to confirm an international arbitration
award (the “Final Award”) and to have judgment entered thereon, pursuant to Section 207 of the
Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 207. The Final Award, dated July 10, 2015, is attached as
Exhibit 1 to the Declaration of Dr. Markus Burianski (“Burianski Declaration”), attached hereto
as Exhibit A.

PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE

2. Petitioner Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation Limited (“GSPC”) is a company
duly organized and incorporated under the laws of India and owned 96% by the Government of
Gujarat, India.

3. Petitioner Alkor Petroo Limited (“Alkor”) is a company duly organized and
incorporated under the laws of India.

4. Petitioner Western Drilling Contractors Private Limited (“Western Drilling”) is a
company duly organized and incorporated under the laws of India.

5. The Republic of Yemen (“Yemen” or “the Republic”) is a “foreign state” for
purposes of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1603.

6. The Yemeni Ministry of Oil and Minerals (“the Ministry”) is a “political
subdivision” of the Republic of Yemen for purposes of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act,

28 U.S.C. § 1603.

Americas 91204124

Case 1:16-cv-01383 Document1 Filed 06/29/16 Page 3 of 9

7. This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1330, which
provides for jurisdiction over foreign states as defined in 28 U.S.C. § 1603.

8. This Court also has subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to Chapter 2 of the
Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) because the Final Award is governed by the Convention on the
Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (the “New York Convention”).

9. Specifically, 9 U.S.C. § 207 allows a party to confirm “an arbitral award falling

under the [New York] Convention . . . as against any other party to the arbitration.” This is an
action to enforce an arbitral award rendered in France, a signatory to the New York Convention,
in the United States. Jurisdiction is therefore appropriate. See 9 U.S.C. § 203 (“An action or
proceeding falling under the Convention shall be deemed to arise under the laws and treaties of
the United States. The district courts of the United States . . . shall have original jurisdiction over
such an action or proceeding, regardless of amount in controversy.”).

10. This Court has personal jurisdiction over both Yemen and the Ministry
(collectively, “the Respondents”) pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1330(b), which provides that this Court
can exercise personal jurisdiction over a foreign state in an action with respect to which the
foreign state is not entitled to sovereign immunity under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1605-1607.

11. Respondents are not entitled to sovereign immunity under 28 U.S.C. § 1605
because this case falls under the arbitration exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act
(“FSIA”). In particular, 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(6) provides that a foreign state is not immune under
the FSIA where “the action is brought . . . to confirm an award made pursuant to [an] agreement
to arbitrate, if... the agreement or award is or may be governed by a treaty or other international
agreement in force for the United States calling for the recognition and enforcement of arbitral

awards.”

Americas 91204124

Case 1:16-cv-01383 Document1 Filed 06/29/16 Page 4 of 9

12. The Final Award is governed by the New York Convention, which is
implemented at 9 U.S.C. § 201 et. seq. Thus, 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(6) is applicable.

13. Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 204 and 28 U.S.C.
§ 1391(£)(4).

FACTS
The Parties’ Agreement

14. Petitioners are Indian companies engaged in petroleum exploration and
production. In 2006, Petitioners submitted bids to engage in hydrocarbon exploration and
production activities in Yemen. Those bids were ultimately accepted and awarded to Petitioners
on December 9, 2006.

15. Sixteen months later, on April 13, 2008, the Ministry entered into three nearly
identical Production Sharing Agreements (“PSAs”) with the Petitioners.' The PSAs outlined the
terms of Petitioners’ work regarding certain exploration and production activities. Specifically,
the PSAs provided that Petitioners were to carry out reprocessing and interpreting of existing
seismic data; acquiring, processing, and interpreting new 2D and 3D seismic data; and drilling
work in Yemen.

16. The PSAs were ratified by the President of Yemen on March 17, 2009. The
PSAs are governed by Yemeni law and are not only contracts but also themselves laws of
Yemen.

17. The PSAs each contain an identical dispute resolution clause providing for
arbitration under the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce (Paris) (“ICC”).

Specifically, Article 23 of the PSAs states, in relevant part:

' The PSAs differ only in their commercial terms and their respective Work Program and Budget; all three PSAs
contain identical arbitration provisions.

Case 1:16-cv-01383 Document1 Filed 06/29/16 Page 5 of 9

“{I]n case a dispute arises under this Agreement between the MINISTRY and the

[Petitioners] with respect to interpretation, application or its validity, the Parties to the

dispute . . . shall submit their dispute to arbitration as provided in this Article (23). ...

[T]he arbitration shall be held in Paris, France, and conducted in the English language in

accordance with the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the International Chamber

of Commerce. . . . Judgment [on] the award may be entered by any court having

jurisdiction or application may be made to such court for a judicial acceptance of the

award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be.”
A copy of Article 23 from each of the PSAs is attached hereto as Exhibit 2A, Exhibit 2B, and
Exhibit 2C to the Burianski Declaration.

18. In 2013, due to mounting security concerns in Yemen, the application of a “Force
Majeure” provision of the PSAs became the subject of arbitration between the parties.

Arbitration before the ICC

19. On February 25, 2013, Petitioners filed a Request for Arbitration before the
International Court of Arbitration of the ICC. Respondents filed an Answer to the Request for
Arbitration on May 9, 2013.

20. The arbitration (the “Arbitration”) commenced in 2013 under the caption Gujarat
State Petroleum Corporation Limited, Alkor Petroo Limited and Western Drilling Contractors
Private Limited v. Republic of Yemen and The Yemeni Ministry of Oil and Minerals, Case No.
19299/MCP. The arbitrators were selected in accordance with Article 23 of the PSAs. See
Burianski Decl., Ex. 1 at 13; Burianski Decl., Exs. 2A-2C.

21. The parties asserted numerous claims, counterclaims and defenses in the
Arbitration. As relevant here, Petitioners alleged that the PSAs were terminated by application
of a Force Majeure provision in the agreements and that, as a result, Respondents were not

entitled to draw upon letters of credit issued to ensure that Petitioners satisfied their obligations

under the PSAs.

Americas 91204124

Case 1:16-cv-01383 Document1 Filed 06/29/16 Page 6 of 9

22. In the Arbitration, Yemen challenged the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal.
However, in its Final Award, the tribunal rejected Yemen’s challenge and determined that
jurisdiction existed under the PSAs. See Burianski Decl., Ex. 1 at 125. At no point did the
Ministry challenge the tribunal’s jurisdiction.

The Final Arbitral Award

23. On July 10, 2015, the ICC tribunal issued its Final Award, ruling in favor of
Petitioners and against Respondents.

24. The tribunal first “declare[d] that it ha[d] jurisdiction over Respondent 1 i.e. the
Republic of Yemen.” Burianski Decl., Ex. 1 at 123.

25. The tribunal then found that an event of Force Majeure existed and that the
Petitioners had validly terminated the PSAs. See id.

26. Asa result, the tribunal ordered Respondents to pay Petitioners the following:

© US$ 3,012,059.09 for costs and expenses incurred by Petitioners in
connection with the preparation for and conduct of the arbitration,
including ICC administrative expenses and arbitrator’s fees and expenses;

¢ US$ 776,412.25 for costs incurred by Petitioners in extending the letters

of credit.
See id.
27. The tribunal also “dismisse[d] the Respondents’ counterclaims in their entirety.”
Id. at 124.
28. As of the present date, Respondents have failed to pay the amounts owed to

Petitioners pursuant to the Final Award.
29. Respondents have brought an action before the Cour d’Appel de Paris, a French

appellate court, seeking to challenge the Final Award and that action remains pending.

Americas 91204124

Case 1:16-cv-01383 Document1 Filed 06/29/16 Page 7 of 9

Petitioners believe that the action is without merit and, in any event, it is not relevant to this
Court’s confirmation of the Final Award. See 9 U.S.C. § 207.
CLAIM FOR RELIEF
(9 U.S.C. § 207)

30. The New York Convention, as implemented by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9
U.S.C. §§ 201 et seq., governs the Final Award because the Final Award arises from a
commercial relationship between Petitioners, Yemen, and the Ministry. 9 U.S.C. § 202. Both
the United States and France, where the Arbitration took place, are contracting states to the New
York Convention.

31. This Petition is timely pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 207 because it is filed within three

years from the issuance of the Final Award.

32. This Court has jurisdiction to confirm the Final Award against the Respondents.
33. No grounds exist for this Court to refuse confirmation and recognition of the Final
Award.
Count One

(Confirmation of the Final Award)

34, Petitioners incorporate the above paragraphs as stated herein.

35. The Federal Arbitration Act provides that the “court shall confirm the award
unless it finds one of the grounds for refusal or deferral of recognition or enforcement of the
award specified in the said Convention.” 9 U.S.C. § 207 (emphasis added).

36. None of the grounds available for refusal or deferral of recognition or
enforcement of an award specified in the New York Convention are applicable to the Final

Award.

Americas 91204124

Case 1:16-cv-01383 Document1 Filed 06/29/16 Page 8 of 9

37. Therefore, pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 207, Petitioners request that this Court confirm
and recognize the Final Award and enter judgment in favor of Petitioners and against
Respondents in the amount of the Final Award.

38. Under the terms of the Final Award, Petitioners are entitled to US$ 3,012,059.09
for costs and expenses incurred by Petitioners in connection with the preparation for and conduct
of the arbitration, including ICC administrative expenses and arbitrator’s fees and expenses.

39. Under the terms of the Final Award, Petitioners are also entitled to US$
776,412.25 for costs relating to the extension of the above-mentioned letters of credit for the
duration of the ICC arbitration proceedings.

40. Petitioners also seek prejudgment interest on the amount of the Final Award.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Petitioners respectfully request an order:
A. Confirming the Final Award pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 207 and entering a judgment

in favor of Petitioners and against Respondents in accordance with the Final Award;

B. Awarding interest (including prejudgment interest), legal expenses, and costs; and
Cc. Granting such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
Dated: June 29, 2016 Respectfully submitted,
