INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

This case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”) on the basis of the Energy Charter
Treaty (the “ECT”), dated 17 December 1994, which entered into force for the Italian
Republic and the Kingdom of the Netherlands on 16 April 1998,! and the Convention
on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States,
which entered into force for the Italian Republic and the Kingdom of the Netherlands
on 28 April 1971 and 14 October 1966, respectively (the “ICSID Convention”).

The Claimant is Silver Ridge Power BV (‘Silver Ridge” or the “Claimant”), a private

limited liability company incorporated in the Kingdom of the Netherlands.
The Respondent is the Italian Republic (“Italy” or the “Respondent”).

The Claimant and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the “Parties”. The

Parties’ representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).

In the present dispute, the Claimant challenges a series of measures taken by the
Respondent between 2011 and 2014 as constituting violations by the Respondent of
Articles 10 and 13 of the ECT.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On 29 July 2015, ICSID received a request for arbitration of the same date from Silver

Ridge against Italy (the “Request”).

On 11 August 2015, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in
accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the
registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to

proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule

' The fact that the Italian Republic notified the depositary of its withdrawal from the ECT on 31 December 2014
(see CL-248) and that this withdrawal took effect, pursuant to Article 47(2) of the ECT, one year later, i.e. on 1
January 2016, is not relevant in the present case since Article 47(3) of the ECT states that the treaty provisions
shall continue to apply to investments made in the Respondent’s territory as of the date when the withdrawal takes
effect for a period of 20 years from such date.

7(d) of ICSID’s Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration

Proceedings.

By letter of 12 January 2016, ICSID noted that the Parties had not taken any steps in
the proceedings following the registration and informed the Parties that, pursuant to
ICSID Arbitration Rule 45, if no steps were taken within a six-month period, i.e. by 11

February 2016, the Secretary-General would discontinue the proceedings.

By letter of 13 January 2016, the Claimant informed ICSID of its intent to continue the

proceedings.

By letter of 27 January 2016, the Claimant proposed a method of constituting the
Tribunal. By email of 24 February 2016, the Claimant noted that the Respondent had
not yet agreed to its proposal and asked if Italy was planning to propose a different

method of constitution.

By letter of 25 February 2016, the Respondent agreed with the Claimant’s proposed
method of constitution. In accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention,
the Tribunal would be constituted as follows: the Tribunal would consist of three
arbitrators, one to be appointed by each Party and the third, presiding arbitrator to be

appointed by agreement of the Parties.

By letter of 24 June 2016, the Claimant informed ICSID that the Parties had agreed to
suspend the proceedings until 16 January 2017. By email of 28 June 2016, the

Respondent confirmed its agreement to the suspension.

By letter of 18 January 2017, the Claimant informed the Centre that it intended to

resume the proceedings and that it would nominate its arbitrator in the coming weeks.

By letter of 26 January 2017, the Claimant appointed Judge O. Thomas Johnson (U.S.)
as arbitrator. By letter of 30 January 2017, ICSID confirmed that Judge Johnson had

accepted his appointment.

By letter of 28 February 2017, the Respondent appointed Prof. Bernardo M. Cremades
(Spanish) as arbitrator. By letter of 1 March 2017, ICSID confirmed that Prof.

Cremades had accepted his appointment.

By letter of 28 April 2017, the Respondent informed the Centre that the Parties had
jointly agreed to nominate Judge Bruno Simma (German/Austrian) as the President of

the Tribunal. By email of the same date, the Claimant confirmed its agreement.

On 2 May 2017, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID
Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the “Arbitration Rules”), notified the
Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal
was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Mr. Francisco Abriani,

ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.

The Tribunal is composed of Judge Bruno Simma, a national of Germany and Austria,
President, appointed by agreement of the Parties; Judge O. Thomas Johnson, a national
of the United States of America, appointed by the Claimant; and Prof. Bernardo M.

Cremades, a national of Spain, appointed by the Respondent.

By letter of 23 May 2017, the Tribunal asked the Parties, inter alia, if they would
consent to the appointment of Dr. Andreas Miiller as Assistant to the Tribunal. By
letters of 30 May 2017, both Parties confirmed that they had no objection to the

appointment.

In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session with

the Parties on 19 June 2017 by teleconference.

Following the first session, on 10 July 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No.
1 recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters. Procedural Order No. 1
provides, inter alia, that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from
10 April 2006, that the procedural language would be English, that the place of
proceeding would be Paris, France, and that Dr. Andreas Miiller would serve as
Assistant to the Tribunal. Procedural Order No. 1 also sets out the agreed schedule for

the merits phase of the proceedings.

On 29 September 2017, the Claimant filed its Memorial on All Issues (“Cl. Memorial”)

with accompanying documentation.

On 2 February 2018, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial (“Resp. Counter-

Memorial”), which included a request for bifurcation and a request that the Tribunal

suspend the proceedings pending the decision of the Court of Justice of the European

Union (“CJEU”) in Case C-284/16.

By letter of 17 February 2018, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to respond to the
Respondent’s requests of 2 February 2018 by 21 February 2018.

By letter of 21 February 2018, the Claimant asked the Tribunal to reject the

Respondent’s requests for bifurcation and the suspension of the proceedings in full.

By letter of 27 February 2018, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it intended to rule
on the Respondent’s bifurcation request after the CJEU’s decision in Case C-284/16 on
6 March 2018.

On 7 March 2018, on behalf of the Tribunal, ICSID transmitted the English and French
versions of the CJEU’s decision in Case C-284/16, Slovak Republic v. Achmea BV (the
“Achmea judgement”) to the Parties and invited them to provide any comments by 23

March 2018.

On 23 March 2018, both Parties provided their comments on the Achmea judgement

(“Cl. Achmea Comments” and “Resp. Achmea Comments”).

On 19 April 2018, the Claimant, on behalf of the Parties, transmitted a draft

confidentiality order to the Tribunal for the Tribunal’s consideration and signature.

On 19 April 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 granting the
Respondent’s request for bifurcation and laying out a procedural calendar for the next

phase of the proceedings.

By letter of 27 April 2018, the Claimant asked the Tribunal to clarify the procedural
calendar beyond the hearing on jurisdiction and provided suggested dates for further
submissions/hearings. By email of 30 April 2018, the Tribunal invited the Respondent’s

comments on the Claimant’s proposed calendar by 7 May 2018.

By email of 7 May 2018, the Respondent provided its comments on the calendar for the

remainder of the proceedings.

By email of 8 May 2018, ICSID noted that it had not received a confirmation from the

Respondent of its agreement to the confidentiality order received from the Claimant on

19 April 2018. It informed the Parties that, unless the Respondent objected, the Tribunal
intended to sign and issue the order the following day. By email of the same date, the

Respondent confirmed that it agreed with the contents of the order.

By letter of 9 May 2018, the Tribunal proposed slight modifications to the

confidentiality order and invited the Parties to provide their comments by 11 May 2018.

By email of 10 May 2018, the Claimant confirmed its agreement to the Tribunal’s

proposed wording for the confidentiality order.

By email of 17 May 2018, the Tribunal reiterated its request that the Respondent
provide comments on the Tribunal’s proposed changes to the confidentiality order. By

email of 18 May 2018, the Respondent confirmed its agreement to the changes.

On 21 May 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, embodying the Parties’

confidentiality order.

On 23 and 30 May 2018, the Claimant and the Respondent, respectively, provided

signed copies of the confidentiality order pursuant to Procedural Order No. 3.

On 8 June 2018, the Claimant submitted its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction

(“Cl. Counter-Memorial”) with accompanying documentation.

On 27 July 2018, the Respondent submitted its Reply on Jurisdiction (“Resp. Reply”)

with accompanying documentation.

On 14 September 2018, the Claimant filed its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction (Cl.

Rejoinder”) with accompanying documentation.

By email of 19 September 2018, the Respondent asked that the hearing on jurisdiction
scheduled for 1-2 November 2018 be rescheduled to the following week. By email of
the same date, the Claimant confirmed its availability for the new dates, but asked that,
should the Tribunal not be available, the hearing proceed as scheduled on the original
dates. By email of 20 September 2018, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it was not

available for the new dates and that the hearing would proceed as originally scheduled.

By emails of 28 September 2018, the Parties submitted their joint proposal for the

upcoming hearing and informed the Tribunal that, unless it thought otherwise, the pre-

On 1 October 2018, the European Commission filed an application to intervene as a

non-disputing party.

By email of 2 October 2018, the Tribunal invited the Parties to provide their comments

on the European Commission’s application by 9 October 2018.

On 9 October 2018, the Parties filed their observations on the European Commission’s

application.

By letter of 12 October 2018, the Tribunal granted the European Commission
permission to submit a 15-page written submission by 17 October 2018. The Parties
were granted until 26 October 2018 to respond in writing, with the understanding that
the Commission’s submission could also be addressed at the upcoming hearing on

jurisdiction.

On 17 October 2018, the European Commission filed its Amicus Curiae Submission

with accompanying documentation.

By email of 18 October 2018, the Claimant objected to the format of the Amicus Curiae
Submission, which it stated was not in compliance with the Tribunal’s decision of 12

October 2018 and, as a result of the Commission’s font size, illegible.

By letter of 19 October 2018, the Tribunal asked the European Commission to resubmit
its Amicus Curiae brief in 12-point font, with 1.5 spacing, in compliance with the 15-

page limit by 22 October 2018.

On 22 October 2018, the European Commission provided an updated version of its

Amicus Curiae Submission (“EC Submission’).

By letter of 23 October 2018, the Tribunal invited the European Commission to
indicate, by 30 October 2018, if there were “any pending cases before the EU Court
which concern the application of the Achmea principle in a case involving the Energy

Charter Treaty, and the status of those proceedings”.

Ill. FACTUAL AND REGULATORY BACKGROUND

105. Before addressing the Parties’ contentions regarding the Tribunal’s jurisdiction (see
Chapter V.; paras. 150 et seq.) as well as regarding the liability of the Respondent for
alleged violations of Articles 10 and 13 of the ECT (see Chapter VI.; paras. 314 et seq.),
the Tribunal deems it useful to briefly set out the factual and regulatory background to

the present proceedings.

106. In making its findings in the present and in the following Chapters, the Tribunal has
carefully considered all written and oral submissions and arguments submitted to it by
the Parties in the course of the proceedings, but refers to them in the following only

inasmuch as they are relevant for this Award.
A, THE CLAIMANT’S INVESTMENTS IN ITALY

107. The Claimant, i.e. Silver Ridge Power BV, is a private limited liability company
incorporated in the Kingdom of the Netherlands (see para. 2). The Claimant indirectly
owned and controlled — through its wholly-owned Dutch holding company SRP Italia
Holdings BV — Silver Ridge Power Italia s.r.]., a limited liability company incorporated
in the Italian Republic. Before the creation of SRP Italia Holdings BV in 2014, the
Claimant (then known as AES Solar Energy BV) had directly owned and controlled
Silver Ridge Power Italia s.r.l. (then known as AES Sole Italia s.r.l.).? Silver Ridge
Power Italia s.r.1. owned and controlled the ten Italian local development companies*
which in turn owned and operated the 25 photovoltaic plants (PV plants) subject to the
current dispute* (see Request, paras. 13, 15, 33-34; Cl. Memorial, paras. 44, 46, 86,
236).

108. These 25 PV plants went into operation between September 2010 and May 2012, with
acombined capacity of approximately 130 megawatts (MW) (see Request, paras. 6, 31;

Cl. Memorial, para. 84). According to the Claimant, the total cost for the acquisition,

2 See Rome Chamber of Commerce, Historical File, Commercial Company, p. 41, 54 (C-008).

3 These development companies are: ASI Cellino San Marco FV s.r.1., ASI Frosinone s.r.l., ASI Torchiarolo FV
, Ecosicily s.r.1., Fontesol s.r1., Impianto Alpha s.r.1., Soemina Energeia s.r.1., SR10 s.rJ., SRI s.r.l., and
rl.

   

  

+ As regards the so-called “Project Vega” PV plant with an envisaged capacity of 123 MW, which was however
never realized, see Chapter VI.B (paras. 478 et seq.).

14

construction and maintenance of the 25 plants was approximately EUR 470 million
(Cl. Memorial, para. 94).° The Claimant further submits that it is common practice in
the solar energy market to finance PV plants with a leverage of 70-85 % of the

construction costs® (Cl. Memorial, para. 92).

109. For each of the plants, the Gestore dei Servizi Energetici S.p.A. (GSE), i.e. Italy’s
Management of Electricity Services Company, and the respective local development
company entered into an agreement, the so-called “GSE conventions” (see para. 120).
All the plants benefited from feed-in tariffs (FIT) under the Second, Third, Fourth and
Fifth Energy Accounts (see paras. 123 et seq., 129 et seq.). All but two PV plants
(Cangiano and Santa Maria, i.e. the so-called “Frosinone plants”) also profited from the
off-take regime (see para. 117), with four among them (i.e. Rimo, Gim, South and
Cutrona) qualifying for the minimum guaranteed prices (see para. 118) under the off-

take regime (Request, paras. 29, 36).

110. The 25 PV plants subject to the present arbitration are enlisted below together with the
corresponding Energy Account regime that they were subject to (see Request, para. 32;

In March 2017, Silver Ridge Power Italia s.r.l. entered into agreements by which
subsidiaries owning PV plants with a capacity of about 105 MW were sold to an affiliate
of Cubico Sustainable Investments. The parties to these agreements explicitly agreed
that the Claimant retains the treaty claims asserted in the present arbitration’

(Cl. Memorial, para. 48).

ELEMENTS AND EVOLUTION OF THE ITALIAN INCENTIVIZATION REGIME FOR
PHOTOVOLTAIC ENERGY

In view of the benefits of producing energy from sunlight in terms of avoiding pollution
associated with fossil fuel electricity generation, producing energy locally, lowering the
dependence on energy imports, thus contributing to energy efficiency and energy
security, multiple efforts to encourage investment in renewable energy in general, and
in PV plants producing solar energy in particular, have been made in Europe in general
(see Subsection 1; paras. 113 et seq.) and in Italy in particular (see Subsection 2;

paras. 116 et seq.), notably since the turn of the millennium.

(1) European Union legislation

On 27 September 2001, the European Parliament and the Council adopted Directive
2001/77/EC,* the “First Renewables Directive”, in order to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions and to meet the international targets set by the Kyoto Protocol. According to

the Directive’s preamble,

(1) [...] The Community recognises the need to promote renewable energy
sources as a priority measure given that their exploitation contributes to
environmental protection and sustainable development. [...]

(14) Member States operate different mechanisms of support for renewable
energy sources at the national level, including green certificates, investment
aid, tax exemptions or reductions, tax refunds and direct price support
schemes. One important means to achieve the aim of this Directive is to
guarantee the proper functioning of these mechanisms, until a Community
framework is put into operation, in order to maintain investor confidence.”
The Directive established national indicative targets with a view to achieving the EU’s
target of generating 22.1 % of the total electricity consumed from renewable energy
sources.!° Italy’s target was 25 %.'! The Directive obliged the Member States to
maintain properly functioning schemes to support renewable energy as well as an
objective, transparent and non-discriminatory legislative and regulatory framework that
provided for timely administrative procedures.'? At the same time, it left the possibility
for each Member State to identify the incentivization regime which “corresponds best
to its particular situation”.!°
In 2009, the First Renewables Directive was repealed and replaced by Directive
2009/28/EC, i.e. the “Second Renewables Directive”.'* The new Directive created

mandatory national overall targets for electricity consumption based on renewable

energy in order for the EU to achieve a share of 20 % by 2020. Italy’s mandatory
target was to have a gross consumption of 17 % through energy produced from
renewable sources by 2020.'° These objectives have the primary purpose “to provide
certainty for investors and to encourage continuous development of technologies which
generate energy from all types of renewable sources”.'” In this regard, the Directive
encourages Member States to implement renewable energy support schemes in order to
achieve their renewable energy targets,'* which may inter alia comprise “direct price

support schemes including feed-in tariffs and premium payments”.'?

(2) Italy’s legislative and regulatory framework

Italy implemented the First Renewables Directive through Legislative Decree
No. 387/2003.” Article 7 of this decree delegated the definition of specific criteria for
measures to encourage the production of electricity from PV sources, including the
methods for determining the scope of specific incentive rates for electricity generated
by PV plants, to subsequent ministerial decrees.”! It required that, “[fJor the electricity
produced by photovoltaic conversion of solar energy, the criteria [laid down in the
ministerial decrees] provide for a specific incentive tariff by decreasing amount and
duration as to ensure a fair remuneration of investment and operating costs”.??

In addition to the “Conto Energia” regime (see paras. 119 et seq.), Legislative Decree
No. 387/2003 created another incentivization scheme, the so-called “off-take regime”.
This regime entitled eligible producers, specifically renewable energy producers with a
capacity of less than 10 MW, to sell their electricity directly to the GSE which in turn
sold the electricity into the market. The Autorita per lenergia elettrica e il gas (AEEG),

ie. Italy’s Authority for Electric Energy and Gas, was tasked with establishing the

Economic Activities, in consultation with the Minister of the Environment and the Protection of the Territory, in
agreement with the Joint Conference, shall adopt one or more decrees by which the criteria for encouraging the
production of electricity from solar source[s] are defined”.

modalities of the system.” All of the PV plants subject to the present arbitration except
Cangiano and Santa Maria (i.e. the so-called Frosinone plants) benefited from the off-

take regime (see para. 110).

Moreover, owners of small plants (i.e. with a capacity below 1 MW) could sell their
electricity at minimum guaranteed prices (prezzi minimi garantiti). At the end of the
year, the GSE would reimburse the difference in price if the market price (prezzo zonale
orario) was higher than the minimum guaranteed prices. Four of the PV plants subject
to the present arbitration (Rimo, Gim, South and Cutrona) profited from the minimum

guaranteed prices regimes under the off-take regime (see para. 110).

Under the terms of Article 7 of Legislative Decree No. 387/2003 (see para. 116), three”*
consecutive ministerial decrees were adopted which were called “Conti Energia” or
“energy accounts” and which established the terms and conditions for the incentive
tariff regime specifically for PV plants. In particular, the energy accounts granted PV
plants connected to the national transmission grid special rates funded by the electricity
consumers, referred to as “feed-in tariffs” (FIT). The level of FIT depended on capacity,
technology, whether the plant was on rooftops or on the ground and the date when the
PV plant was effectively connected to the transmission grid and therefore entered into

operation.

Once the PV plants were built and operational, they could apply for FIT under the
applicable energy account. Subsequently, the GSE and the respective local
development company signed an agreement, by which the GSE agreed to pay FIT at a
specified rate for 20 years (convenzione per il riconoscimento delle tariffe incentivanti,
i.e. “GSE conventions”).?> While the specific terms of the GSE conventions differ to
some extent depending on the applicable Energy Account, the contents of the various
GSE conventions widely overlap.”° The terms of the conventions within a given energy
account are identical, except for plant-specific information. The date of entering into

service of the PV plants (or the date of the application for the incentives if made after

25 See Article 24(2)(d) of the Legislative Decree No. 28/2011, i.e. the so-called Romani Decree (CL-080).

26 As regards the GSE conventions pertinent in the present arbitration, see the sets of contracts for the Second
Energy Account (C-030), the Third Energy Account (C-060), the Fourth Energy Account (C-063) and the Fifth
Energy Account (C-068).

15 days from entering into service) fixed the starting point for the FIT under the energy
accounts. Furthermore, the GSE conventions provided that any modifications to their

terms were to be agreed between the GSE and the producers in writing.?”

121. Renewable energy technology scaled up over time in response to these incentives. The
advances in technology drove down the costs associated with the construction and
operation of PV plants. Furthermore, the cost of producing renewable energy decreased
due to resulting economies of scale. In order to take into account the decreasing costs,
FIT were progressively reduced over time on the occasion of the adoption of new

Energy Accounts.

122. The First Energy Account (Conto Energia 1,78 adopted on 28 July 2005, was directed
towards PV plants with an individual capacity between | kW and | MW, granting them
the right to receive a specific incentive tariff for every kWh of electricity produced.”°
None of the PV plants subject to the present arbitration falls under the regime of the

First Energy Account (see para. 110).

123. By virtue of the Second Energy Account (Conto Energia II),*° adopted on 19 February
2007, for the first time the application of the incentives was extended to the totality of
the energy produced by a PV plant and not merely that produced and consumed locally.
In addition, the upper limit of 1 MW prescribed by the First Energy Account was
removed. The Second Energy Account granted a base FIT for PV plants that went into
operation on or before 31 December 2008. For plants commencing operation between
1 January 2009 and 31 December 2010, the tariff was reduced by 2 % for each calendar
year after 2008.*! The Second Energy Account also provided that PV plants connected

to the grid after 14 months from Italy’s reaching an overall installed capacity of 1,200

27 See, for instance, GSE Contracts under the Second Energy Account (C-030), Article 10; see, however, GSE
Contracts under the Fifth Energy Account (C-068), Article 17.3, according to which the GSE could unilaterally
amend the terms of the contracts in case of a regulatory change, subject to the producers’ right to terminate the
contract.

MW would not be eligible for FIT.*? Seven of the PV plants subject to the present
arbitration (Alinca, Cellino, Ciminna, Gim, Rimo, South, Torchiarolo) fall under the

regime of the Second Energy Account (see para. 110).

Subsequently, Law-Decree No. 3/2010,” the so-called “Salva Alcoa Decree”, extended
the FIT under the Second Energy Account to PV plants the construction of which was
concluded by 31 December 2010, if they were connected to the grid by 30 June 2011,**

thus extending the temporal scope of the Second Energy Account.

The Third Energy Account (Conto Energia III),*> adopted on 6 August 2010, granted
FIT for PV plants that entered into operation between 31 December 2010 and 31
December 2013.*° It also established a mechanism of progressive reduction of FIT not
any longer on an annual, but on a tri-annual basis in order to better reflect the evolution
of PV technology and the significant reduction of costs components and PV systems.
The cumulative threshold of the capacity of PV plants admitted to the incentivization
program was increased from 1,200 MW in the Second Energy Account to 3,000 MW
and extendable to PV plants that were connected to the grid within 14 months of the
date on which this threshold was reached by Italy. The GSE was obliged to make a
public announcement if the incentivized installed capacity for PV plants achieved under
that account reached the threshold of 3,000 MW.*’ Four of the PV plants subject to the
present arbitration (Cocomeri, Francavilla Apollo, Raineri, Scopeto) fall under the

regime of the Third Energy Account (see para. 110).

adopted on 3 March 2011 and entered into force on 29 March 2011. Article 24 of this

decree (“Incentive mechanisms”) states in its relevant part:

(1) The production of electricity from renewable sources commissioned
after 31 December 2012 shall be promoted through the instruments and on
the basis of general criteria listed in paragraph 2 and the specific criteria set
out in paragraphs 3 and 4. The preservation of non-incentivized productions
is performed with instruments referred to in paragraph 8.

(2) The electricity produced by the installations referred to in paragraph 1
[i.e. PV plants] shall be promoted on the basis of the following general

criteria:

a) the incentive has the purpose of ensuring fair returns of investment and
operating cost;

b) the period of entitlement to the incentive shall be equal to the average
useful life of the specific types of conventional plant and shall start from
the date of entry into operation of the same;

c) the incentive shall remain constant throughout the period of right, and

may take into account the economic value of the energy produced
[..J!°
127. Furthermore, the Romani Decree limited the applicability of the Third Energy Account
to PV plants commencing operation by 31 May 2011, as opposed to the originally
envisaged end-date of 31 December 2013.4! In addition, the Romani Decree added
further conditions to the eligibility of PV plants to receive FIT, based on size,
organization and zoning of land. In particular, according to the Romani Decree, any PV
plant built on agricultural land would be eligible for FIT only if the plant in question
had a capacity below 1 MW, occupied less than 10 % of the parcel on which it was
erected and, in case of PV plants built on land belonging to the same owner, the plants
were required to be located at least 2 km from one another.” As an exception to this
rule on PV plants located on agricultural land, if the construction permit had been issued

before the entry into force of the Romani Decree (i.e. 29 March 2011) or if the

application for the permit was submitted by 1 January 2011, the new requirements

would not apply provided that the plant entered into operation before 29 March 2012.7

Like its predecessor, i.e. Legislative Decree No. 387/2003, the Romani Decree tasked
certain ministries, namely the Ministry of Economic Development and the Ministry of
Protection of Land and Sea, to determine the incentive regime for renewable energy
investments by way of special decrees.** Two additional energy accounts were adopted

on the basis of this authorization.

The Fourth Energy Account (Conto Energia IV),*> adopted on 5 May 2011, applied to
PV plants entering into operation between 1 June 2011 and 31 December 2016.*° The
Fourth Energy Account also introduced a distinction between “small plants” and “large
plants”, the former being defined as “photovoltaic plants installed on buildings that
have a power output of no more than a [sic] 1,000 kW, other photovoltaic plants with
power output of not more than 200 kW [...]”.4”

In this regard, an electronic register for large PV plants eligible for FIT was established
which was to be maintained by the GSE. In this register, plants were ranked according
to several criteria. For the 2011 tariffs, the GSE had to compile two registers, one in
July for applications made between 20 May and 30 June 2011, and one in September,
for applications made between 15 and 30 September 2011. Inclusion in the registers
was subject to certain cost thresholds for incentive payments, the cost limit for the
period between 1 June 2011 and 31 December 2011 being EUR 300 million which was
estimated to equal to 1,200 MW of installed capacity. In this framework, large PV
plants that came into operation by 31 August 2011 would be automatically eligible for
FIT. Large plants that entered into operation between 1 September 2011 and 31
December 2012 had to be listed in the register and would benefit from FIT provided

that their ranking on the register so allowed and that their certificate of work completion

was sent to the GSE within seven months (or nine months for plants with electric power

capacity above 1 MW) from the date of publication of the ranking.**

In addition, for the first time, a national indicative installed capacity target for PV plants
was introduced which was set at 23 GW, corresponding to an indicative annual
cumulative cost of incentives estimated to be between EUR 6 and 7 billion.” The
incentive regime was tied to this yearly cumulative cost threshold, and the Ministry for
Economic Development was entitled to revise the FIT for future PV plants when Italy

reached the lower end of the threshold, i.e. EUR 6 billion.°°

Twelve of the PV plants subject to the present arbitration (Apollo 2, Barresi, Brunno,
Cutrona, Del Vicario, Francaviglia, Giovannino, La Cogna, Lucia, Nepi, Panevino,

Rinaldone) fall under the regime of the Fourth Energy Account (see para. 110).

The Fifth Energy Account (Conto Energia V) was adopted on 5 July 2012.°! According
to its Article 1(3), the incentivization regime under that energy account would apply 45
days after the publication of the AEEG resolution provided by Article 1(2) of the Fifth
Energy Account. On 15 July 2012, the AEEG decided that “[t]he indicative cumulative
annual cost of the incentives receivable for photovoltaic plants has reached 6 billion

euros per year on 12 July 2012”.*?

The Fifth Energy Account provided for two different incentive regimes based on PV
plants’ capacities. The first regime applied to plants up to 1 MW capacity and awarded
them an “all-inclusive tariff’ which included the price of the electricity and the value
of the incentive. The second regime applied to PV plants exceeding a capacity of 1 MW
and awarded them an amount equal to the difference between the all-inclusive tariff and

the market price of electricity plus the revenues deriving from the sale of the energy on

the market. In addition, regardless of their capacity, all plants were entitled to a bonus

tariff on the electricity produced and consumed by them.*?

The incentive regime under the Fifth Energy Account was to cease to apply to new PV
plants 30 days after the adoption of a further resolution by the AEEG that the cost
threshold of EUR 700 million for incentive tariffs (bringing the total cost of PV
incentives to EUR 6.7 billion per year) was reached.** This resolution was passed on 6
June 2013.5 Two of the PV plants subject to the present arbitration (Cangiano and
Santa Maria, the so-called Frosinone plants) fall under the regime of the Fifth Energy

Account (see para. 110).

In addition, the Fifth Energy Account also contained a provision requiring PV energy
producers benefiting from incentive tariffs under any of the energy accounts to pay, as
of 1 January 2013, an annual administrative fee of EUR 0.0005 per kWh of incentivized
energy. The relevant part of Article 10 (“Management of the incentives system and

implementing regulations”) of the Decree establishing the Fifth Energy Account reads:

 

qd) Producers applying for the feed-in tariffs set forth in this decree
shall pay to the GSE a fee for the processing of the application
equal to EUR 3 for each kW of nominal power for plants below 20
kW and EUR 2 for each kW above 20 kW. [...]

(4) In order to cover for management, control and inspection costs of
the GSE, the responsible entities acceding to the feed-in tariffs
under this decree [...] shall pay to the GSE starting 1 January 2013,
also through the set-off of the incentives due, a fee of 0.05 c euro
for each kWh of incentivized energy. [...]°°
On 23 December 2013, Legislative Decree No. 145/201 3,> the so-called “Destinazione
Italia Decree”, was adopted: “For the purpose of containing the annual burden on prices
and on the electric rates of the incentives for renewable energy and for the purpose of

plants”,** this decree gave PV plant operators the choice between (i) continuing the
existing incentive regime for the 20 year period without any additional benefits after
the expiration of this period; and (ii) accepting a reduced percentage of tariffs under the
Energy Accounts, in exchange for an extension in the duration of the incentive period

by seven years.*?

138. On 24 June 2014, Italy enacted Legislative Decree No. 91/2014, the so-called
“Spalma-incentivi Decree”, which entered into force on 25 June 2014. “In order to
optimize the management of the collection and distribution of incentives and to foster
more sustainable policies supporting renewable energy”,°! the decree, according to its
own terms, sought to “remodulate” or “reformulate” the incentive payments under the
energy accounts (“la tariffa incentivante [...] é rimodulata’®) and to provide for
altered modalities for disbursement of the FIT starting from 1 January 2015. The
remodulation of the FIT regime by the Spalma-incentivi Decree was applicable for PV
plants with a capacity above 200 kW. This measure affected all of the 25 plants subject

to the present arbitration (see para. 110).

139. The new regime offered PV plant operators three options, which they could choose

from:%

- Under Option A, the FIT were to be spread over 24 years instead of the original 20
year period and reduced by 17 to 25 % depending on duration of the “residual

period”.

- Under Option B, the FIT were to be paid for the original 20 year period, but the
tariffs would be remodulated by creating two periods, a first period between 2015
and 2019, in which a reduced incentive tariff would be disbursed, followed by a

second period in which the incentive tariffs would be increased. The relevant

percentages are set out in the Decree of the Ministry of Economic Development of

17 October 2014.

- Under Option C, the FIT were to be paid for the original 20 year incentive period,
but reduced during the residual period depending on the capacity of the respective
PV plant. This would result in a reduction of (a) 6 % for PV plants having a capacity
between 200 and 500 kW; (b) 7 % for PV plants having a capacity between 500 and
900 kW; and (c) 8 % for PV plants having a capacity higher than 900 kW.

The Spalma-incentivi Decree granted PV plant operators until 30 November 2014 to
communicate to the GSE which of the aforementioned three options they would select.
In the absence of a communication from the producers, the default option to be applied
by the GSE would be the third one, i.e. Option C.° The re-modulation of the FIT

became effective as of 1 January 2015.°°

All of the 25 PV plants subject to the present arbitration were assigned the third option
by default. In view of the fact that they all have a capacity higher than 900 kW (see
para. 110), each of the plants, as of 1 January 2015, was subject to an 8 % decrease in

FIT (see Request, para. 40).

The Spalma-incentivi legislation also modified the FIT payment mechanisms. Starting
from 1 July 2014, the GSE would pay the FIT in monthly instalments during a given
year in an amount equal to 90 % of the solar plants’ forecast annual average production
for each calendar year of reference. On 30 June of the subsequent year, the GSE would
pay the remaining balance to the producers, based on the electricity actually produced

by the solar plants.°”

In addition, the Spalma-incentivi Decree altered the administrative management fee
introduced by the Fifth Energy Account (see para. 136). The fee was made contingent
on the PV plant’s capacity in the following terms: (a) 2.20 EUR/kW for PV plants
having a capacity between 3 and 6 kW; (b) 2 EUR/kW for PV plants having a capacity

THE CHALLENGED MEASURES

In the present arbitration proceedings, the Claimant challenges a series of measures
taken by the Respondent between 2011 and 2014 as constituting violations by the
Respondent of Articles 10 and 13 of the ECT. These “challenged measures” are the

following (in chronological order):

a) the adoption of the Romani Decree (see para. 126) in 2011, restricting the
applicability of the Third Energy Account and allegedly forcing the Claimant to
abandon the so-called Project Vega, thus breaching Article 10(1), first and second

sentences, of the ECT (see Section VIB; paras. 478 et seq.);

b) the adoption of the Fifth Energy Account (see para. 133) in 2012, allegedly resulting
in the non-accessibility of the Fourth Energy Account for the Frosinone plants and
forcing them into the Fifth Energy Account regime, thus breaching Article 10(1),
first and second sentences, as well as Article 13(1) of the ECT (see Sections
VLC.2.a and VI.C.2.b; paras. 566 etseq.), and creating an administrative
management fee (see para. 136), thus allegedly breaching Article 10(1), second and

last sentences, of the ECT (see Section VI.C.2.c; paras. 613 et seq.);

c) the adoption of the Spalma-incentivi Decree (see para. 138) in 2014, reducing the
FIT the Claimant received for its 25 PV plants (see Section VI.A; paras. 316 et seq.)
and raising the administrative management fee (see para. 143) introduced by the
Fifth Energy Account (see Section VI.C.2.c; paras. 613 et seq.), thus allegedly

breaching Article 10(1), first, second and last sentences, of the ECT.

REQUESTS FOR RELIEF

In the present arbitration proceedings, the Claimant argues that the Respondent, by
adopting the contested measures referred to above (see para. 144), has breached
Articles 10 and 13 of the ECT. The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s submissions and
claims that it has not violated Articles 10 and 13 of the ECT. In addition, the Respondent

raises four objections to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

In its various submissions (see Cl. Reply, para. 393; see similarly Request, para. 109;
Cl. Memorial, para. 417; Cl. Counter-Memorial, para. 351; Cl. Rejoinder, para. 257;
Cl. PHB, para. 175; Cl. Reply PHB, para. 60), the Claimant requests an Award:

a

Declaring that the Tribunal has jurisdiction under the ECT and the ICSID

Convention over the Claimant’s claims;

b

Declaring that the Italian Republic has breached its obligations under Part III of the

Energy Charter Treaty;

c

Ordering the Italian Republic to pay to Silver Ridge Power BV damages, in an

amount to be proven at the hearing;

d

Ordering the Italian Republic to pay interest on the above sum from the date of the
first breach to the date of the award at the rate for Italian bonds, compounded

annually;

e

Ordering the Italian Republic to pay the expenses incurred by the Claimant in
connection with these proceedings, including professional fees and disbursements,
and to pay the fees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal and the charges
for the use of the facilities of the Centre, in accordance with Article 61(2) of the

ICSID Convention;

f) Ordering the Italian Republic to pay interest on the sums awarded at the rate for

one-year Italian bonds, compounded annually;

g) Ordering such other and further relief as the Tribunal deems appropriate in the

circumstances.

29

147.

148.

In its various submissions (see Resp. Counter-Memorial, para. 602; Resp. Rejoinder,
para. 617; see similarly Resp. Reply, para. 212), the Respondent requests the Tribunal

to:

a

Decline jurisdiction to decide, as the ECT does not cover intra-EU disputes;

b

Alternatively, decline jurisdiction over the claims on the Spalma-incentivi Decree
and the Fifth Energy Account, since the requirement of unconditional consent under
Article 26 ECT is not satisfied as the GSE conventions contain an exclusive

jurisdiction clause;

c

Decline jurisdiction over the claim on the Romani Decree, since the requirement of

Article 26 ECT of prior request for amicable solution has not been fulfilled;

d

Decline jurisdiction over the imposition of administrative fees to cover GSE costs

because these are Taxation Measures under Article 26 ECT; and

e

Ina further alternative, decline admissibility of protection of the Claimant’s alleged
interests since this is barred from seeking relief, since an exclusive forum clause
was selected in the GSE conventions (relevant for claims on the Spalma-incentivi
Decree and the Fifth Energy Account), as well as no amicable solution was

addressed to Italy as for the Romani Decree.

Should the Tribunal decide that it has jurisdiction over the case and that claims are

either totally or partially admissible, the Respondent further requests the Tribunal to

a

Declare, on the merits, that the Respondent did not violate Article 10(1) ECT, first
and second sentence, since it did not fail to grant fair and equitable treatment to the
Claimant’s investment, and to ensure them stable, equitable, favorable and

transparent conditions;

b

Equally, declare, on the merits, that Article 10(1) ECT, last sentence (the so-called
“umbrella clause”) does not apply in the case at stake, or, alternatively, that the

Respondent did not violate it;

c

Further, declare that Italy did not violate Article 13 ECT either, since its behaviors

did not amount to indirect expropriation of two of the Claimant’s plants; and

d) Consequently, declare that no compensation is due.

30

149.

In the event that the Tribunal were to recognise the legitimacy of one of the Claimant’s

grievances, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to:

a) Declare that the damages were not adequately proved;

b) In addition, declare that both the methods for calculation and the Claimant’s
calculation of damages itself are inappropriate and erroneous; and

c) Order the Claimant to pay the expenses incurred by the Italian Republic in

connection with these proceedings, including professional fees and disbursements.

JURISDICTION

The Claimant contends that all pertinent requirements of both Article 26 of the ECT
and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention are met and that, therefore, the Centre has
jurisdiction and the Tribunal has competence to decide the dispute at stake (Request,

paras. 111-127; Cl. Memorial, paras. 222-269).

In the course of the proceedings, the Respondent has raised four jurisdictional
objections, namely: (A) that the ECT does not apply to disputes between an investor of
a Member State of the European Union (“EU Member State”) and another EU Member
State, i.e. the so-called “‘intra-EU objection” (see paras. 153 et seq.); (B) that there is a
lack of consent due to the exclusive jurisdiction clauses contained in the GSE
conventions (see paras. 239 et seq.); (C) that the requirement under Article 26(1) and
(2) of the ECT for prior request for amicable settlement is not met in the present case
in relation to the Romani Decree® (see paras. 265 et seq.); and (D) that the
administrative fee imposed by the Fifth Energy Account falls under the “carve out” for

taxation measures according to Article 21 of the ECT (see paras. 284 et seq.).

Apart from the aforementioned objections, which the Tribunal will address
subsequently, the Respondent has not engaged with, let alone contested, the Claimant’s
factual submissions concerning the fulfilment of the conditions enshrined in Article 26

of the ECT and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention (Cl. Counter-Memorial, paras. 3-5).
THE “INTRA-EU OBJECTION”
(1) The Parties’ Positions

a) Respondent’s Position

The Respondent argues that the application of Article 26(1) of the ECT, which
presupposes a dispute “between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another
Contracting Party”, is excluded in a case where an investor of an EU Member State
(such as the Netherlands) has a dispute with another EU Member State (such as Italy)

in relation to an investment in this State, i.e. a so-called “intra-EU dispute”. The

promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (CL-080).

32

Respondent contends that the Claimant can therefore not benefit from Article 26(1) of

the ECT in the present arbitration.

154. In its pertinent submissions, the Respondent relies on Article 26(6) of the ECT
according to which “[a] tribunal established under [Article 26(4) of the ECT] shall
decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and
principles of international law”. In this regard, the Respondent argues that EU law
forms part of the “applicable rules and principles of international law” to be applied
when judging on the case and that the provision refers to any issue in dispute, including

jurisdictional issues.

155. In addition, according to the Respondent, the duty of consistent interpretation under
Article 31(3)(c) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (“VCLT”) calls for
acknowledging the relevance of EU law in the interpretation of the ECT arbitration
clause. As concerns existing arbitral awards recognizing jurisdiction on intra-EU
disputes, the Respondent contends that, while tribunals are not bound by previous
awards, they are bound by EU law and CJEU decisions, including the Achmea
judgement,” since these pertain to international law to be applied under Article 26(6)
of the ECT (Resp. Reply, paras. 6-18, 118; Resp. Achmea Comments, paras. 4-5;
Request for Termination, p. 2; Resp. Rejoinder, paras. 6, 109-135).

156. On this basis, the Respondent submits that investment protection for investments
carried out by an EU investor in another EU Member State is governed by EU law, in
particular by the rules of free movement of capital and freedom of establishment, the
general principles of Union law, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European
Union and relevant secondary legislation. Pursuant to Article 3(2) of the Treaty on the
Functioning of the European Union (“TFEU”), EU Member States are prohibited from
concluding an agreement between themselves which might affect the rules of EU law
or alter their scope. According to the Respondent, EU Member States therefore lack the
competence to conclude bilateral or multilateral international agreements concerning

protection of intra-EU investments.

157. Moreover, the Respondent contends that, pursuant to Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU,

EU Member States cannot submit a dispute concerning the interpretation and

160.

application of EU law to any method of settlement other than those provided for therein.
An international agreement concluded between two EU Member States that contains an
offer for intra~-EU investment arbitration thus violates Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU
and the general principle of autonomy of EU law. Hence, the offer to arbitrate by the
Respondent must be deemed inapplicable to intra-EU disputes from the outset, as the
incompatibility of the arbitration mechanism with the primacy of EU law existed since
the entry into force of the EU Treaties. According to the Respondent, the ECT does
therefore not apply to disputes between an investor of an EU Member State and another
EU Member State. The appropriate forum for the Claimant to bring an action against
the Respondent would be the competent courts of Italy (Resp. Counter-Memorial,
paras. 45, 105, 134-147; Resp. Reply, paras. 30-48; Resp. Achmea Comments, paras.
6-10, 20).

In its further submissions, the Respondent notably relies on Article 1 of the ECT.
Article 1(3) of the ECT defines “Regional Economic Integration Organisation” (REIO)
as “an organisation constituted by states to which they have transferred competence
over certain matters a number of which are governed by this Treaty, including the
authority to take decisions binding on them in respect of those matters”. Pursuant to
Article 1(10) of the ECT, “area” with respect to a REIO means “the Areas of the
member states of such Organisation, under the provisions contained in the agreement

establishing that Organisation”.

Accordingly, the Respondent argues that the recognition of the overlapping of the
“territories” of the Member States and the Union in this provision confirms the
recognition by the ECT of the existence of a single, unified area within the EU where
competences are internally allocated with external relevance. Hence, according to the
Respondent, the ECT expressly acknowledges that the EU has competence over some
of the matters regulated by the ECT and that that competence entails the power to issue
decisions that are binding on the members of the ECT and, by extension, on tribunals
constituted by them. The binding nature of the rulings of the CJEU was therefore
contemplated and accepted by the Contracting Parties of the ECT (Resp. Counter-
Memorial, paras. 51-54; Resp. Rejoinder, para. 136).

Moreover, according to the Respondent, Article 25 of the ECT can be reasonably

interpreted as being based on the understanding that between the ECT Contracting

34

161.

162.

163.

164.

Parties that are members of the EU, a “preferential treatment” exists and is fully
recognized by the ECT. In addition, the final part of Article 25(2) of the ECT seems
specifically to recognize not only that rules of an Economic Integration Agreement, but
also their further implementation by secondary measures prevail and are recognized by

the ECT (Resp. Counter-Memorial, paras. 55-57).

As regards the purpose of the ECT, the Respondent argues that Article 2 of the ECT
refers to the European Energy Charter process which was planned since its very
beginning as a tool to regulate relations between the European and the Eastern
Europe/Soviet Union markets, and not to regulate the EU internal market for energy

(Resp. Counter-Memorial, paras. 68-70).

The Respondent further contends that the fact that the ECT does not apply to disputes
between an investor of an EU Member State and another EU Member State is also
confirmed by the practice of EU Member States as well as the EU. According to the
Respondent, no investor-state arbitration concerning a purely intra-EU situation was
instituted under the ECT until the Electrabel v. Hungary case in 2007. Starting from
that very first arbitration, the EU and its Member States objected to the jurisdiction of
arbitral tribunals, and the European Commission (“EC”) repeatedly asked to intervene
as amicus curiae to the same end. This shows that the EU and its Member States have
maintained a judicial behavior that confirms their intention for the ECT not to cover
intra-EU situations (Resp. Counter-Memorial, paras. 72-76; Resp. Reply, paras. 49,
110-111; Resp. Rejoinder, para. 78).

With respect to Article 16 of the ECT, the Respondent contends that EU law represents
a more developed and articulated legal system which is without doubt more favorable
and offers more articulated forms of protection to the investors and their investments
than a multilateral treaty such as the ECT. EU law includes a complete set of substantive
and procedural rules that govern investments of EU investors in other EU Member
States. Those rules cover all stages of the investment life cycle (Resp. Counter-
Memorial, paras. 58-59, 94-95, 133; Resp. Reply, para. 61; Resp. Achmea Comments,
paras. 34-38).

According to the Respondent, even leaving aside Article 16 of the ECT, Article 30 of

the VCLT leads to the same conclusion (Resp. Counter-Memorial, para. 96). In

35

particular, the Respondent submits that Article 30 of the VCLT applies to the
succession of treaties between the ECT and EU law as it stands after the entry into force
of the Lisbon Treaty. According to the Respondent, the International Law
Commission’s Report on Fragmentation of International Law’! does not require exact
coincidence of provisions or objectives as regards the “same subject-matter”
requirement. As the provisions of EU law and of the ECT both level the playing field,
ensure development and factually cover the same situation of an investor entering a

foreign market, they relate indeed to the same subject-matter; hence, Article 30 of the

VCLT applies (Resp. Counter-Memorial, paras. 87-92).

165. The Respondent further refers to Article 41 of the VCLT and argues in this regard that,
also in the light of Article 16 of the ECT, the Lisbon Treaty is a perfectly legitimate
inter se agreement derogating from the general rules of the ECT by reinforcing the
treatment of investors and investments within the EU. By adopting the Lisbon Treaty,
EU Member States did not affect, by any means directly nor indirectly the enjoyment
by the other Contracting Parties and their investors of their respective rights under the

ECT (Resp. Counter-Memorial, paras. 98-104; Resp. Reply, paras. 62-63).

166. As regards the CJEU’s Achmea judgement, the Respondent submits that in terms of
implications of this judgement, no distinction can be drawn between bilateral and
multilateral treaties or treaties exclusively undertaken by EU Member States (like BITs)
as opposed to agreements to which the EU itself is party (like the ECT). The reference
in the Achmea judgement to international agreements also signed by the EU should be
read as addressing situations where obligations against third parties are undertaken.
What is decisive, in the light of the CJEU’s jurisprudence, is whether an international
tribunal has to apply and interpret EU law. It is clear therefore, according to the
Respondent, that arbitral tribunals having the features of a tribunal based on the ECT
are, as far as intra-EU situations are concerned, incompatible with EU law (Resp. Reply,

paras. 66-109; Resp. Achmea Comments, paras. 11-17).

The Respondent further relies on the EC Communication of 19 July 2018” as well as
on the Declaration of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States of
15 January 20197? in support of its submission that the investor-State arbitration clause
in the ECT is incompatible with the EU Treaties and must therefore be disapplied.
According to the Respondent, the Declaration is a binding instrument emanating from
sovereign States and providing an authentic interpretation of the scope of application
of Article 26 of the ECT as far as the Contracting States signing the Declaration (that
include Italy and the Netherlands) are concerned. A minority of EU Member States
simultaneously signed a parallel declaration that is not an objection to the 22 Member
States Declaration, but only declared the intention to wait for an express decision of the
CJEU to provide an authoritative interpretation on the question (Resp. Reply, paras. 1-

51; Request for Termination, p. 2; Resp. Rejoinder, paras. 1-57).

Moreover, the Respondent contends that the 22 Member States Declaration is not a
reservation, prohibited under Article 46 of the ECT, but reflects a subsequent agreement
regarding the interpretation of the ECT within the meaning of Article 31(3)(a) of the
VCLT. The Respondent also argues that the Declaration constitutes, for the purposes
of Article 31(3)(b) of the VCLT, subsequent practice in the application of the ECT
establishing agreement of the Parties regarding its interpretation. These are primary
means of treaty interpretation. Hence, while it is undisputed that an arbitral tribunal has
the authority to interpret the ECT, it is called to rely upon the pertinent legal instruments

(Resp. Rejoinder, paras. 58-63; Request for Termination, p. 2).

Finally, the Respondent submits that, if the Tribunal resolved to proceed to the merits
phase and issue an award, the latter would be unenforceable and subject to non-
recognition duties. According to the Respondent, there is a general duty of a tribunal to
render an enforceable award, as exemplified in Article 40 of the ICC Rules of
Arbitration, in order to preserve the integrity of the arbitral function. This aspect alone
should warrant the Tribunal’s acceptance of the Respondent’s jurisdictional objection

or, if the Tribunal prefers to treat this as a matter of admissibility, the refusal to exercise

its jurisdiction in the present case. In addition, the Respondent argues that a tribunal in
this situation should decline to exercise its jurisdiction in the light of the principles of
international comity and forum non conveniens (Resp. Reply, paras. 120-123; Resp.

Achmea Comments, paras. 44-45; Resp. Rejoinder, paras. 147-164).

b) Claimant’s Position

The Claimant argues that the text, the context and the object and purpose of the ECT
confirm that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the present dispute under Article 26

of the ECT (Cl. Counter-Memorial, para. 14).

As regards the first element, the Claimant submits that nothing in the language of
Article 26 of the ECT supports the Respondent’s jurisdictional objection. The clear text
of the first paragraph of this provision states that “[d]isputes between a Contracting
Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter
in the Area of the former” may be submitted to ICSID arbitration. The provision applies
to disputes between any Contracting Party to the ECT, including Italy, and an investor
of any other Contracting Party, including the Netherlands. The ordinary meaning of
Article 26 of the ECT is that the Contracting Parties’ consent to arbitration is
unconditional and that there is no exception for disputes between EU investors and EU

Member States (Cl. Counter-Memorial, paras. 15-27).

As concerns secondly other relevant provisions of the ECT, the Claimant contends that
nothing in Article 16 of the ECT supports the Respondent’s position that EU law should
prevail over the ECT, as the Respondent fails to establish that EU law represents a more
developed and articulated legal system than the ECT. To the contrary, according to the
Claimant, the ECT provides protection to investors that does not exist under EU law
such as investor-State arbitration. Furthermore, Article 25 of the ECT means that most-
favored nation treatment obligations do not require EU Member States to extend the
rights of the EU internal market to investors from beyond the EU. At the same time,
nothing supports the Respondent’s assertion that this provision establishes some
preferential treatment of intra-EU relations or that rules of EU law prevail over the

ECT.

Moreover, the Claimant argues that the definitions of “Regional Economic Integration

Organisation“ (“REIO”) and “Area” in Article 1(3) and Article 1(10) of the ECT,

38

174.

175.

176.

respectively, do not prevent EU investors from arbitrating energy investment disputes.
In particular, nothing in Article 1 of the ECT suggests that the existence of an Area for
a REIO excludes the existence of Areas of Member States for which the latter remain
responsible. Furthermore, the existence of Decision No. | of the European Energy
Charter Conference, according to which in case of a conflict between the Svalbard
Treaty and the ECT the former shall prevail, manifests that, when the ECT Contracting
Parties intended for the ECT to be displaced by another treaty in case of a conflict, they
clearly expressed their intent to do so. Yet, the ECT Contracting States did not include

such exception regarding the EU Treaties (Cl. Counter-Memorial, paras. 28-52).

Thirdly, the Claimant submits that the object and purpose of the ECT of creating a
broader European energy market fully accords with the application of the ECT to all its
Contracting Parties and their investors without exception. Hence, the ECT creates
obligations binding upon all Contracting Parties, including EU Member States in their

mutual relations (Cl. Counter-Memorial, paras. 53-64).

As regards the Respondent’s submissions on subsequent practice, the Claimant
contends that the self-interested positions of a minority of ECT Contracting States
cannot establish a subsequent practice in the application of the ECT that would establish
the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation in the meaning of Article
31(3)(b) of the VCLT. In addition, when the Respondent asserts that all EU Member
States have always raised the intra-EU objection, the Respondent is itself an exception
to the asserted rule, since it did not raise the objection in the Blusun v. Italy case, where

only the EC did (Cl. Counter-Memorial, para. 69; Cl. Rejoinder, paras. 136-137).

Moreover, the Claimant argues that the allocation of competences between the EU and
its Member States does not detract from the grant of jurisdiction in Article 26 of the
ECT. In particular, EU Member States that are parties to the ECT cannot be excused
from their treaty obligations, which they accepted upon signing and ratifying the ECT,
simply because they are Members of the EU. Furthermore, the EU and its Member
States have never issued a so-called “declaration of competence”, as they have done in
the case of many other treaties, to the effect that the ECT would not be binding between
EU Member States. In fact, the EC did propose a so-called “disconnection clause”, but
the other ECT Contracting Parties rejected it so that the EC withdrew its proposal.

Hence, the ECT Contracting Parties declined to adopt a “Community exception” with

39

177.

178.

179.

the consequence that EU Member States, in their mutual relations, are not exempted
from their ECT obligations (Cl. Counter-Memorial, paras. 71-111; Cl. Rejoinder, paras.
118-135).

Inasmuch as the Respondent claims that Article 26(6) of the ECT requires the Tribunal
to apply EU law as part of the “applicable rules and principles of international law”, the
Claimant submits that Article 26(6) of the ECT deals with the substantive law
governing the merits of the case, but not with issues of jurisdiction. In a similar vein,
according to Article 42 of the ICSID Convention, a tribunal shall decide a dispute, i.e.
the merits of the case, while the jurisdiction of an ICSID tribunal is governed by Article
25 of the ICSID Convention and by the instruments expressing consent (Cl. Rejoinder,

paras. 25-33).

In addition, the Claimant objects to the Respondent’s argument that Article 30 of the
VCLT is relevant with respect to the succession of treaties between the ECT and the
Lisbon Treaty. Article 30 of the VCLT applies in case of an incompatibility between
successive treaties relating to the same subject-matter. However, according to the
Claimant, none of these conditions is fulfilled here. First, the ECT and the EU Treaties
do not relate to the same subject-matter. Secondly, these treaties co-exist and can be
applied harmoniously. In particular, Article 26 of the ECT is compatible with Articles
267 and 344 of the TFEU as well as with the principle of mutual trust under EU law.
Thirdly, the pertinent provisions of EU law predated the ECT; hence, the ECT is the
applicable lex posterior. That the Lisbon Treaty was concluded after the entry into force
of the ECT is of no relevance in this regard (Cl. Counter-Memorial, paras. 112-149,

159-169; Cl. Rejoinder, paras. 164, 166).

The Claimant further argues that, if an incompatibility should exist between the ECT
and the EU Treaties, this conflict would be governed by Article 16 of the ECT by virtue
of which the ECT Contracting Parties expressly derogated from Article 30 of the
VCLT. Article 16 of the ECT resolves the conflict in favor of the treaty that offers the
most favorable protections to the investors and the investment, including substantive
provisions and the right to dispute resolution. According to the Claimant, the ECT is
more protective of investors’ rights than the EU Treaties because the ECT provides for
investor-State arbitration, while EU law does not, and because the ECT offers

protections at all stages of the investment whereas EU law mostly covers the pre-

40

180.

181.

182.

investment phase (Cl. Counter-Memorial, paras. 154-158; Cl. Rejoinder, paras. 164-
165).

As far as Article 41 of the VCLT is concerned, the Claimant rejects the Respondent’s
argument that the Lisbon Treaty is a permissible inter se modification of the ECT.
Nowhere does the Lisbon Treaty state that it was intended to modify the ECT. In
addition, under Article 41(2) of the VCLT, any proposed modification must be notified
to all signatories; no such notification was provided in the present case. Moreover, also
in a substantive perspective, such modification would be an impermissible inter se
agreement because the Lisbon Treaty would, due to its lower level of protection of
investors’ rights, be incompatible with the object and purpose of the ECT. Finally,
according to the applicable lex specialis, i.e. Article 1(13) read in conjunction with
Article 33 of the ECT, the negotiations of the Lisbon Treaty would have had to be
“authorized” and its text “adopted” by the Charter Conference; however, this was not

the case (Cl. Counter-Memorial, paras. 170-182; Cl. Rejoinder, paras. 167-171).

The Claimant further submits that numerous arbitral tribunals, operating on the basis of
the ECT, have repeatedly and consistently rejected the argument that the ECT did not
apply to the inter se relations between EU Member States that were ECT Contracting
Parties. As these tribunals have come to their conclusion by applying the ECT and the
same principles of international law that the present Tribunal is called upon to apply,
the Claimant invites the present Tribunal to follow their example (Cl. Counter-

Memorial, paras. 183-198; Cl. Rejoinder, paras. 136-148; Cl. PHB, para. 171).

Turning specifically to the Achmea judgement, the Claimant sees no support for the
Respondent’s assertion that this judgement confirms the lack of jurisdiction of arbitral
tribunals under Article 26 of the ECT in intra-EU investment disputes. In particular, the
Claimant contends that the Achmea judgement is irrelevant to the present dispute, since,
differently from the situation before the CJEU, the ECT is a treaty also concluded by
the EU and since the policy and constitutional concerns underlying the Achmea
judgement are not pertinent to the legal regime agreed to by the EU and the other ECT
Contracting Parties. Furthermore, according to the Claimant, the present Tribunal’s
jurisdiction, including the validity of the Respondent’s offer to arbitrate, is to be
determined exclusively on the basis of the ECT and international law. In this regard,

the Respondent does not explain how the Achmea judgement could possibly impact the

41

183.

184.

185.

agreement on which this Tribunal is based (Cl. Achmea Comments, p. 4-7; Cl. Counter-

Memorial, paras. 208-244; Cl. Rejoinder, paras. 99-117).

As concerns the aforementioned EC Communication,” the Claimant argues that the
Respondent makes general comments about a non-binding policy document issued by
the EC which discusses general principles of EU law, but suggests no incompatibility

between EU law and the ECT (Cl. Rejoinder, paras. 152-160).

Furthermore, with respect to the aforementioned EU Member States Declaration,”> the
Claimant submits that this Declaration is merely a political statement without legal
effect and that it reflects the position of some, but not all EU Member States’
representatives. This is manifested by the fact that, on 16 January 2019, other EU
Member States (Finland, Luxembourg, Malta, Slovenia and Sweden) issued another
declaration on the same topic,”® and that, on the same date, Hungary also issued a
separate declaration.”’ Hence, there is no consensus among EU Member States on the
legal consequences of the Achmea judgement with respect to the ECT. Moreover, the
Claimant rejects the Respondent’s argument that the Declaration falls within Article
31(3)(a) or Article 31(3)(b) of the VCLT since it does not reflect the agreement of all
ECT Contracting Parties (Reply to the Request for Termination, p. 2-6; Cl. Reply,
paras. 377-389).

Finally, the Claimant contends that there is no merit in the Respondent’s argument that
an award in the present case would be unenforceable. Of the 154 States that have ratified
the ICSID Convention, only 27 are EU Member States. This leaves 127 States not
subject to EU law where the award could be enforced. While it is undisputed that
arbitrators should make every reasonable effort to ensure enforceability of the award,
an arbitral tribunal should not frustrate the arbitration agreement in the interests of

ensuring enforceability. Hence, according to the Claimant, the award’s supposed

unenforceability could not justify a finding of lack of jurisdiction or inadmissibility in

the present case (Cl. Rejoinder, paras. 72-97).

c) The European Commission’s Position

The EC Submission (see para. 51) exclusively concerns the “intra-EU objection”,
notably the question as to whether Article 26 of the ECT, i.e. a provision of a treaty that
forms part of EU law and covers a field regulated by EU law, namely energy law,
contains an offer for arbitration from Italy to investors from the Netherlands, and, if so,
whether that offer for arbitration is valid and applicable (EC Submission, para. 1). The
observations made by the EC are presented subsequently in summary fashion. The
Tribunal will consider them, however, only to the extent that they relate to arguments

also made by one of the Parties to the present dispute.

The EC first submits that the proper interpretation of Article 26 of the ECT — in the
light of the wording, context as well as the object and purpose of the ECT, as established
by reference to prior international agreements referenced in the ECT’s preamble and
the circumstances of its conclusion — leads to the conclusion that the arbitration offer
made by the Respondent when ratifying the ECT is solely addressed to investors from
Contracting Parties other than EU Member States and did not create any international
obligations between Member States inter se. According to the EC, all ECT signatory
states, including the non-EU Member States, were fully aware that the EU was using
its internal shared competence for energy and had set up an autonomous regime which
should not be impacted or overlapped by the ECT. The EC further submits that the ECT
Contracting Parties have been made aware of the special features of the EU legal order
and the particularities of transfer of competences to REIOs, as notably recognized in
Article 1(3) and 1(10) of the ECT. Hence, according to the EC, there exists no intra-EU
offer for arbitration with the consequence that the present Tribunal should decline

jurisdiction (EC Submission, paras. 8-17).

Even if Article 26 of the ECT were construed in the opposite manner, i.e. as entailing
an offer also to EU investors, the EC argues that EU law prevails in such a case. In this
regard, the EC submits that EU law is applicable to the dispute as a matter of “applicable
rules and principles of international law” between Italy and the Netherlands pursuant
to Article 26(6) of the ECT. According to the EC, it is generally recognized that the
conflict rules in Article 30(3) to (5) of the VCLT were conceived as residual rules. In

43

189.

190.

191.

contrast, EU law provides for a special conflict rule, namely the primacy of EU law.
This rule applies not only vis-a-vis the domestic laws of each Member State but also
vis-a-vis international treaties concluded between two Member States, regardless of
whether these were concluded before or after accession to the EU (EC Submission,

paras. 3, 18-27).

Furthermore, even if one were to consider that the rules applicable to a conflict between
the ECT and EU law are the general rules of conflict contained in the VCLT, the EC
considers that the inter se obligations between EU Member States would have been
superseded on the basis of Article 30(4)(a) of the VCLT because the ECT and the EU
Treaties relate to the same subject-matter. According to the EC, Article 16 of the ECT
does not lead to a different conclusion since that provision does not contain a rule of
conflict, but only a rule of interpretation. In addition, even if one were to consider
Article 16 of the ECT as a special conflict rule, it would have been overruled by the
later special conflict rule of the primacy of EU law and Article 351 of the TFEU (EC
Submission, paras. 28-35).

In addition, the EC rejects the reasoning of the Masdar v. Spain award” according to
which the Achmea judgement is limited to bilateral investment treaties, but does not
apply to a treaty such as the ECT. According to the EC, the phrase “‘a provision in an

international agreement concluded by the Member States””?

in this judgement clearly
includes treaties such as the ECT, if applied on an intra-EU basis. Hence, it follows
from the Achmea judgement that intra-EU investment arbitration, irrespective of
whether it is based upon bilateral or multilateral instruments of investment protection,
is precluded by the general principles of autonomy and primacy of EU law, by Article
19 of the Treaty on European Union (“TEU”) as well as by Articles 267 and 344 of the

TFEU (EC Submission, paras. 2, 4, 38-39).

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

In addressing the Respondent’s first jurisdictional objection, as to whether there exists,
on the basis of the ECT, jurisdiction with respect to claims of an investor of an EU

Member State against another EU Member State in relation to an investment in this

192.

193.

State (“ECT intra-EU claims”), the Tribunal will proceed, as follows: (a) it will first
clarify whether EU law is law to be applied by investment tribunals when deciding on
jurisdiction regarding ECT intra-EU claims (see paras. 192 et seq.); (b) secondly, in
view of an affirmative response to the previous question, the Tribunal will have to
determine whether the ECT or EU law is the prevailing law in decisions on jurisdiction
regarding ECT intra-EU claims (see paras. 201 et seq.); (c) thirdly, the Tribunal will
turn to the question of whether EU law is relevant for the interpretation of the ECT,
notably its Article 26 (see paras. 214 et seq.); (d) fourthly, the Tribunal will address the
further contention that a modification, according to Article 41 of the VCLT, has been
effectuated with regard to the ECT, notably its Article 26, as far as intra-EU claims are
concerned (see paras. 226 et seq.); (e) finally, the Tribunal will deal with the question
of whether the impact which the CJEU’s Achmea judgement may have upon the
Claimant’s ability to enforce this Award should be a relevant concern for the present

Tribunal (see paras. 232 et seq.).

a) EU Law as Law to be Applied by Investment Tribunals

In their submissions concerning the “intra-EU objection”, both the Respondent and the
Claimant repeatedly refer to provisions of EU law and consider these provisions to be
relevant to the dispute at hand, notably to the Tribunal’s decision on the Respondent’s
jurisdictional objection. Accordingly, the Tribunal must first clarify whether, and to
what extent, EU law, from the perspective of an investment tribunal established on the

basis of the ECT, forms part of the law to be applied by the tribunal.
The relevant parts of Article 26 of the ECT state in this regard:

(1) Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another
Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of
the former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the
former under Part III shall, if possible, be settled amicably.

(2) If such disputes cannot be settled according to the provisions of
paragraph (1) within a period of three months from the date on which
either party to the dispute requested amicable settlement, the Investor
party to the dispute may choose to submit it for resolution:

(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party party
to the dispute;

45

(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute
settlement procedure; or

(c) in accordance with the following paragraphs of this Article.

(3) (a) Subject only to subparagraphs (b) and (c), each Contracting Party
hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute
to international arbitration or conciliation in accordance with the
provisions of this Article.

(4) (4) In the event that an Investor chooses to submit the dispute for
resolution under subparagraph (2)(c), the Investor shall further provide
its consent in writing for the dispute to be submitted to:

(a) (i) The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes,
established pursuant to the Convention on the Settlement of
Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States
opened for signature at Washington, 18 March 1965 (hereinafter
referred to as the “ICSID Convention”), if the Contracting Party of the
Investor and the Contracting Party to the dispute are both parties to the
ICSID Convention;

be]

(6) A tribunal established under paragraph (4) shall decide the issues in
dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and
principles of international law.

194. As regards the question of what the applicable law for decisions on jurisdiction is and,
consequently, whether EU law forms part of the applicable law from the perspective of
an investment tribunal established on the basis of the ECT,*®° two interpretations of

Article 26 of the ECT have been put forward.

195. The first approach, which is supported by the Respondent (see para. 154), relies on
Article 26(6) of the ECT according to which a tribunal “shall decide the issues in
dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and principles of
international law”. In case Article 26(6) of the ECT applies, such rules and principles

of international law would also include EU law inasmuch as it is based on international

80 See Eskosol S.p.A. in liquidazione v. Italian Republic, \CSID Case No. ARB/15/50, Decision on Italy’s Request
for Immediate Termination and Italy’s Jurisdictional Objection based on Inapplicability of the Energy Charter
Treaty to Intra-EU Disputes, 7 May 2019, para. 76 (CL-299): “[...] the source of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is in
the international legal order, not the EU legal order”.

46

treaties concluded between the EU Member States, i.e. the TEU and the TFEU,*!

including judgements of the CJEU.* In this regard, it deserves mention that the CJEU’s

Achmea judgement expressly characterizes EU law as “deriving from an international

agreement between the Member States”.®*

196. The opposite view, which is defended by the Claimant (see para. 177), insists that, with
respect to applicable law, a distinction must be made between decisions on jurisdiction
and decisions on the merits of a dispute. Accordingly, the reference in Article 26(6) of
the ECT to “the issues in dispute” only covers the decision on the merits whereas the
applicable law for decisions on jurisdiction is to be derived from Article 25 of the ICSID

Convention and by the instruments expressing consent.

197. As indicated by the Claimant, in the context of the interpretation of the ICSID
Convention, a similar controversy exists in relation to Articles 25 and 42 of the
Convention. According to Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, “[t]he Tribunal shall
decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties.
In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting
State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of
international law as may be applicable”. Some arbitral tribunals have relied on this
provision in deciding on questions of jurisdiction and have thus also applied other “rules
of international law”.** Others have rejected this approach and stated that the reference
to “decid[ing] a dispute” in Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention only covers the

decision on the merits, whereas questions of jurisdiction are to be decided exclusively

on the basis of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention as well as the treaty provisions
containing the offer to consent to arbitration.*° The second view appears to be the

prevailing one.®°

198. | The arbitral tribunals deciding on ECT intra-EU claims have not adopted a consistent
view on this issue. On the one hand, the Vattenfall v. Germany tribunal confirmed the

view that “the law applicable to the assessment of its jurisdiction is the ECT, in

particular Article 26 thereof, in conjunction with Article 25 of the ICSID Convention”*”

(see para. 196). On the other hand, other tribunals have not taken issue with applying

Article 26(6) of the ECT in regard to jurisdictional objections (see para. 195).°*

199. In the first alternative, EU law does not form part of the law to be applied by investment
tribunals in decisions on jurisdiction concerning ECT intra-EU claims. As only the ECT
is applicable, the problem of how to deal with successive treaties (see infra b) does not
arise in this constellation. Yet, EU law may still be relevant for the question of
interpretation of the ECT, notably its Article 26 (see infra c). In the second alternative,

EU law is part of the applicable law in jurisdictional decisions regarding ECT intra-EU

claims. Consequently, it is relevant for all questions discussed subsequently, including

that of successive treaties.

200. The Tribunal does not need to decide the question of which of the alternatives is the

preferable one at this stage, but will return to it in the following section (see para. 213).

b) ECT or EU Law as the Prevailing Law

201. If EU law forms part of the applicable law in decisions on jurisdiction regarding ECT
intra-EU claims (i.e. the second alternative), the question arises whether, in case a
conflict between the ECT and EU law exists, the ECT, notably Article 26 thereof, or
rather EU law prevails. The existence of such a conflict is suggested by the
aforementioned Achmea judgement. This judgement considers an international
agreement “under which an investor from one of [the] Member States may, in the event
of a dispute concerning investments in the other Member State, bring proceedings
against the latter Member State before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that
Member State had undertaken to accept”,®’ to be incompatible with Articles 267 and
344 of the TFEU due to the interference of the jurisdiction of such tribunals with the

fundamental principle of autonomy of EU law.”

202. While it is true that the CJEU has not yet expressly ruled on the question®! of whether

its ruling in Achmea solely applies to arbitral tribunals based on a bilateral investment

% See ibid., para. 59.

°! This is emphasized by the Declaration of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States on the
Enforcement of the Judgment of the Court of Justice in Achmea and on Investment Protection in the European
Union, 16 January 2019, adopted by five EU Member States (Finland, Luxembourg, Malta, Slovenia and Sweden),
available at _ https://www.regeringen.se/48ee 1 9/contentassets/d759689c0c804a9ea7af6b2de7320128/achmea-
declaration.pdf, p. 3 (CL-268): “The Achmea case concerns the interpretation of EU law in relation to an investor-
state arbitration clause in a bilateral investment treaty between Member States. The Member States note that the
Achmea judgment is silent on the investor-state arbitration clause in the Energy Charter Treaty. A number of
international arbitration tribunals post the Achmea judgment have concluded that the Energy Charter Treaty
contains an investor-State arbitration clause applicable between EU Member States. This interpretation is
currently contested before a national court in a Member State [...]. Against this background, the Member States
underline the importance of allowing for due process and consider that it would be inappropriate, in the absence
of a specific judgment on this matter, to express views as regards the compatibility with Union law of the intra
EU application of the Energy Charter Treaty”.

 

 

See, in a similar vein, Declaration of the Representative of the Government of Hungary on the Legal Consequences
of the Judgment of the Court of Justice in Achmea and on Investment Protection in the European Union, 16 January
2019, paras. 8-9 (CL-269): “The Achmea judgment is silent on the investor-state arbitration clause in the Energy
Charter Treaty Against this background, Hungary underlines the importance of allowing for due process and
considers that it is inappropriate for a Member State to expres: views as regards the compatibility with Union

requires further discussion and individual agreement amongst the Member States”.

agreement (as was the case in Achmea) — as argued by the Claimant (see para. 182)°? —
or also extends to multilateral treaties with the participation not only of the EU Member
States, but of the EU itself, namely the ECT — as submitted by the Respondent (see
para. 166) and the EC (see para. 190)°? —, the Tribunal assumes, for the sake of
argument, that the latter is the case and that therefore a conflict between the ECT and
EU law exists in regard to the jurisdiction of ECT-based arbitral tribunals such as the

present one.**

203. The first provision to consider for the Tribunal in this regard is Article 30 of the VCLT
which deals with the “Application of successive treaties relating to the same subject-
matter” and to which also the Parties (see paras. 164, 178) as well as the EC (EC

Submission, paras. 22 et seq.) have referred in their respective submissions.

204. According to Article 30(3) of the VCLT, in case of successive treaties relating to the
same subject-matter, “[w]Jhen all the parties to the earlier treaty are parties also to the
later treaty but the earlier treaty is not terminated or suspended in operation under article

59, the earlier treaty applies only to the extent that its provisions are compatible with

interpreted the Energy Charter Treaty as also containing an investor-State arbitration clause applicable between
the Member States. Interpreted in such a manner, that clause would be incompatible with the Treaties and thus
would have to be disapplied”.

 

 

°4 For the sake of argument, the present Tribunal also leaves aside the argument of numerous arbitral tribunals
which have concluded, even if the regimes of the ECT and EU law are applied simultaneously, there is no conflict
between them; see Electrabel S.A. v. Hungary, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/19, Award, 25 November 2015, paras.

those of the later treaty”. Pursuant to Article 30(4) of the VCLT, the rule that the later
treaty prevails (lex posterior derogat legi priori) also governs situations where the
parties to the earlier and later treaties do not coincide, but its effect is then limited to
the States which are parties to both treaties. This is the relevant scenario in the present
context, as the relationship of, on the one hand, the ECT and, on the other hand, the EU
Treaties, i.e. the TEU and the TFEU, which are the foundation of EU law (Article 1(2)

of the TEU), is under scrutiny.

205. However, in order for Article 30 of the VCLT to apply, the treaties in question must
have the “same subject-matter”. As far as the ECT and the EU Treaties are concerned,
according to numerous arbitral tribunals, this requirement is not met. In addition, with
respect to the concept of “successive treaties”, there are different views as to whether
the ECT or the EU Treaties qualify as the earlier or later treaties within the meaning of
Article 30 of the VCLT. The ECT was adopted in 1994 and entered into force in 1998.
While it is true that Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU, which are the critical provisions
of EU law from the point of view of the Achmea judgement (see para. 201), form part
of the TFEU which was introduced by the 2007 Treaty of Lisbon (which entered into
force in 2009), these provisions have existed in substantively similar form since the
1957 Treaty of Rome establishing the European Economic Community (Articles 177
and 219 of the EEC Treaty).°°

206. The Tribunal does not have to take a stand on these questions since, according to Article
30(2) of the VCLT, “[w]hen a treaty specifies that it is subject to, or that it is not to be
considered as incompatible with, an earlier or later treaty, the provisions of that other
treaty prevail”. In this regard it is relevant that the ECT contains an Article 16

(“Relation to Other Agreements”), which provides:

Where two or more Contracting Parties have entered into a prior
international agreement, or enter into a subsequent international agreement,

whose terms in either case concern the subject matter of Part III or V of this
Treaty,

(1) nothing in Part III or V of this Treaty shall be construed to derogate
from any provision of such terms of the other agreement or from any
right to dispute resolution with respect thereto under that agreement;
and

(2) nothing in such terms of the other agreement shall be construed to
derogate from any provision of Part III or V of this Treaty or from any
right to dispute resolution with respect thereto under this Treaty,

where any such provision is more favourable to the Investor or Investment.”

207. According to its terms (arg. “construed”), Article 16 of the ECT appears to represent a
tule of interpretation rather than a conflict rule. This has been particularly emphasized
by the EC (EC Submission, para. 35), but was also brought up by the Respondent (Resp.
Counter-Memorial, para. 58). In contrast, the Claimant has endorsed the contrary
position, i.e. that Article 16 of the ECT is a conflict rule (Cl. Counter-Memorial, para.
154; Cl. Rejoinder, para. 165). Arbitral tribunals”® have also considered Article 16 of
the ECT to work as a conflict rule, in case provisions of two treaties are not compatible
with each other, and the present Tribunal shares this view. Hence, Article 16 of the ECT
is lex specialis vis-a-vis Article 30 of the VCLT and is therefore to be applied

preferentially.

208. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that the question of whether the ECT and the EU
Treaties have the “same subject-matter”, which is crucial to the operation of Article 30
of the VCLT (see para. 204), does not arise in the context of Article 16 of the ECT.
Inasmuch as this provision requires that the EU Treaties “concern the subject matter of
Part III or V” of the ECT, thus calling for a significantly weaker link than Article 30 of
the VCLT, the Tribunal is satisfied that the substantive guarantees of freedom of

establishment and free movement of capital (Articles 49 and 63 of the TFEU) and the

concerning Spitsbergen shall prevail to the extent of the conflict, without prejudice to the positions of the
Contracting Parties in respect of the Svalbard Treaty. In the event of such conflict or a dispute as to whether there
is such conflict or as to its extent, Article 16 and Part V of the Energy Charter Treaty shall not apply”. As regards

mechanism of judicial protection of EU law (notably in the interpretation given to it in
the Achmea judgement) overlap with the standards of investment protection and the
dispute settlement mechanism in Parts III and V of the ECT to a sufficient degree for

this condition of the application of Article 16 of the ECT to be met.

Furthermore, Article 16 of the ECT operates irrespective of the question of timing, as
it applies to both prior and subsequent international agreements relating to Part III
(“Investment Promotion and Protection”; Articles 10-17 of the ECT) or Part V of the
ECT (“Dispute Settlement”; Articles 26-28 of the ECT). Accordingly, the issue of
whether the ECT is the earlier or later legal instrument vis-a-vis the EU Treaties, which
is of relevance with respect to Article 30 of the VCLT, does not affect the application
of the lex specialis of Article 16 of the ECT.

According to the clear terms of this provision (see para. 206), neither Part III and V of
the ECT nor the terms of the other agreement (in casu the EU Treaties) shall be
construed to derogate from any substantive guarantee of investment protection or from
any right of dispute resolution with respect thereto, “where any such provision is more

favourable to the Investor or Investment”.

Accordingly, the effect of Article 16 of the ECT essentially depends on whether the
substantive and procedural guarantees of either Part III/V of the ECT or of EU law are
more favorable to EU investors and investments. The Parties have taken contrary
positions on this question. On the one hand, the Respondent argues that EU law
represents without doubt a more developed legal system offering more articulated forms
of protection, both at the substantive and procedural levels, to the investors and their
investment than a multilateral treaty such as the ECT (see para. 163). On the other hand,
the Claimant contends that the ECT provides protection to investors that does not exist
under EU law such as investor-State arbitration (see para. 172). In the arbitral
jurisprudence on the subject” it has been affirmed that Article 26 of the ECT is at least

in some aspects more favorable to investors and investments than EU law, thus

preventing a reading of Article 16 of the ECT which would limit EU investors’ rights
to dispute resolution under the ECT.!°° In particular, the Masdar v. Spain tribunal has

found that

Article 16 of the ECT affords precedence to the more favourable investor-
protection provisions of Article 26 of the ECT of which Claimant has
availed itself over any conflicting provision of the EU treaties. They are
more favourable, not least, because they obviate the need to bring the claim
in the Spanish courts and Respondent cannot derogate from Article 26,
pursuant to which it has given unconditional consent to arbitration.!!

The Tribunal embraces this statement and thus concludes that at least some of the
provisions of Part III and Part V of the ECT are more favorable to investors and
investments with respect to ECT intra-EU claims than EU law. In particular, the mere
existence of Article 26 of the ECT and the possibility of having access to international
arbitration can be seen as an advantage of the ECT over the EU system of judicial
remedies. As a consequence, from the perspective of the ECT which the Tribunal must
primarily apply, the provisions of the ECT, notably its Article 26, prevail over those of
EU law.

This is basically the end of the matter. In the light of the foregoing reasons, the
Respondent’s intra-EU objection must fail. The Tribunal reaches this result,
irrespective of what position one takes with respect to the question of whether EU law
forms part of the law to be applied by an ECT-based investment tribunal in matters of
jurisdiction (see paras. 192 et seq.). Either one denies the applicability of EU law in the
first place (see para. 196) or one accepts its applicability (see para. 195), but, when
called to apply Article 16 of the ECT, one gives preference to Article 26 of the ECT. In
either case, the ECT emerges as the law to be applied by the Tribunal.

resolution, whether against an EU Member State or otherwise”.; see further ibid., para. 229: “[...] Article 16
[ECT] poses an insurmountable obstacle to Respondent’s argument that EU law prevails over the ECT”.

c) Relevance of EU Law for the Interpretation of the ECT, notably
Article 26

214. In order to complete the picture, however, the Tribunal must also address the issue of
treaty interpretation, notably regarding the question of whether EU law in general and
the Achmea judgement in particular have an indirect impact on jurisdiction regarding

ECT intra-EU claims via the interpretation of (Article 26 of) the ECT.

215. To start with, it is generally accepted that the ECT, and notably its Article 26, must be
interpreted in accordance with Articles 31 to 33 of the VCLT and notably the general
tule of interpretation in Article 31(1) of the VCLT according to which “[a] treaty shall

be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the

terms in their context and in the light of its object and purpose”.!°?

216. Throughout the proceedings, the Claimant (see paras. 170 et seq.) has consistently
opposed the argument that the proper interpretation of the relevant provisions of the
ECT would lead to the exclusion of intra-EU claims from ECT dispute settlement, since
plainly no such restriction exists in the language of the ECT. In a similar vein, numerous
arbitral tribunals have unanimously stated that such carve-out or disconnection clause
with regard to intra-EU claims could not be implicit but would have to be express and

clear.'°3

217. The Tribunal endorses this position. Prior to the conclusion of the ECT, the EU had

been aware of and had actually used express disconnection clauses so as to ensure that

provisions of a mixed agreement would not apply between EU Member States.'°*
Furthermore, as opposed to the “intra-EU scenario” on which the ECT is silent, the
ECT includes provisions which explicitly limit its application, notably with respect to
the Svalbard Treaty! as well as in Article 28 of the ECT. Moreover, the EU had
proposed the insertion of a disconnection clause during the negotiations of the ECT,

but the clause was ultimately dropped from the draft treaty.!°°

218. Furthermore, while the Respondent reads Article 1(3) and (10) of the ECT, which
define the terms “Regional Economic Integration Organisation” and “Area” for the
purposes of that treaty, to prevent Article 26(1) of the ECT from applying to “‘intra-EU
disputes” (see paras. 158-159) and is joined in this reading by the EC (EC Submission,
para. 13), the Tribunal cannot find anything in the language of these provisions that
would support such a far-reaching conclusion.'”” The Tribunal has before it claims of a
Dutch investor against Italy, i.e. a dispute between a Contracting Party and an investor
of another Contracting Party. That the home and host States also form part of the EU

as a REIO is of no relevance in this regard.

219. Moreover, as regards the Respondent’s contention that Article 25 of the ECT can be
reasonably interpreted as being based on the understanding that between the ECT
Contracting Parties that are EU Member States a preferential treatment exists (see

para. 160), the Tribunal would agree. It would add, however, that the fact that the EU

Member States have concluded an “Economic Integration Agreement” within the
meaning of Article 25(1) of the ECT and are therefore not required under their most-
favored nation treatment obligations to extend preferential treatment within the EU
internal market to non-EU investors has no implications for the question of what

treatment is to be accorded to EU investors pursuant to the precepts of the ECT.!°*

In addition, the Respondent submits that the rules and principles of EU law, in particular
as authoritatively interpreted by the CJEU in the Achmea judgement and as established
in the EC Communication of 2018,'° should be taken into account by the Tribunal
when interpreting the ECT, by virtue of Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT as embodying a
“duty of consistent interpretation” (Resp. Rejoinder, paras. 109, 127-135). Indeed,
pursuant to Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT, when a treaty is interpreted, “any relevant
rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties” shall be taken
into account together with the context. The Tribunal is, however, not convinced that
this provision can be relied upon to “carve out” intra-EU claims from the scope of

Article 26 of the ECT that is couched in clear terms.

Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT is not to be applied in isolation, but as an integral part of
the general rule of interpretation as enshrined in Article 31(1) of the VCLT (see
para. 215). The Tribunal agrees that the role of this provision in the exercise of treaty
interpretation cannot be to introduce external elements into a treaty with the effect of
rewriting the treaty altogether.'!° Against this background, neither the ordinary
meaning of the terms used by the ECT nor the systematic analysis of its provisions offer
a basis for the Tribunal to conclude that, by drawing on the findings of the CJEU in the
Achmea judgement or the EC’s statements in its legally non-binding 2018
Communication, the ECT, and notably its Article 26, is to be construed as removing

intra-EU claims from ECT dispute settlement.

This also holds true for the Respondent’s reference to the ECT’s object and purpose
(see para. 161). According to Article 2 of the ECT, this treaty “establishes a legal
framework in order to promote long-term cooperation in the energy field, based on
complementarities and mutual benefits, in accordance with the objectives and
principles of the Charter”. In particular, the Respondent claims that the European
Energy Charter process was planned since its very beginning as a tool to regulate
relations between the European and the Eastern Europe/Soviet Union markets (Resp.
Counter-Memorial, para. 69; see also EC Submission, para. 11). The Claimant, in
contrast, reads this clause as creating a broader European energy market applying to all
its Contracting Parties and their investors without exception (Cl. Counter-Memorial,
para. 58). Irrespective of whether one rather leans towards the one or the other
interpretation of Article 2 of the ECT, in the Tribunal’s view, it would mean putting too
much burden on the function of teleological interpretation within the general framework
of Article 31 of the VCLT to go as far as construing the ECT, and notably its Article
26, as excluding intra-EU claims from ECT dispute settlement altogether on this shaky

basis.

Moreover, inasmuch as the Respondent (see paras. 167-168) contends that the
Declaration of 22 EU Member States!!! reflects a subsequent agreement regarding the
interpretation of the ECT within the meaning of Article 31(3)(a) of the VCLT or
constitutes, for the purposes of Article 31(3)(b) of the VCLT, subsequent practice in
the application of the ECT establishing agreement of the Parties regarding its
interpretation, the Tribunal shares the reservations articulated by the Claimant (see
para. 184). To be sure, this Declaration, as well as the two further Declarations, which
were adopted by the remaining EU Member States,'!? may have some interpretative

value. Yet, being non-binding instruments and not reflecting a consensus of all EU

Member States, let alone all ECT Contracting Parties, these Declarations cannot change

the clear terms of the ECT and in particular its Article 26.!!7

In addition, the Tribunal does not find merit in the Respondent’s claim (Request for
Termination, p. 2; Resp. Rejoinder, paras. 4, 8, 51) that the Declaration of 22 EU
Member States can be broken down into a bundle of bilateral declarations — one of them
between Italy and the Netherlands — that provide an authentic interpretation of the scope
of application of Article 26 ECT as far as the participating ECT Contracting Parties are
concerned. In the Tribunal’s view, the Declaration remains what it is: an instrument
which becomes part of, and is relevant to, the exercise of interpretation that is guided
by Article 31(1) of the VLCT. Under this regime, there is no such thing as “authentic
interpretation” with the effect of directly changing the treaty provisions to be applied,
let alone ending an agreement. This can only be effectuated when respecting the
pertinent rules of the VCLT on the modification or termination of treaties. While the
Tribunal will address the issue of modification separately (see paras. 226 et seq.), none
of the scenarios of treaty termination, as set out in Part V of the VCLT, is applicable in
the present case (Cl. Rejoinder, paras. 54-63; Reply to the Request for Termination,
p. 6; Cl. Reply, paras. 388, 390).

In the same vein, the instances of some EU Member States objecting to the jurisdiction
of arbitral tribunals in intra-EU situations or of the EC intervening in such proceedings
(see para. 162) do not amount to a subsequent practice in the application of the ECT
establishing agreement of (all) the ECT Parties regarding its interpretation. Even if they
did, this isolated aspect could not result in an understanding of Article 26 of the ECT
that is so remote from the ordinary meaning of the terms used and from the systematic

analysis of this provision in the context of the ECT, as established above.

d) Modification of the ECT, notably Article 26

As regards the further contention by the Respondent (see para. 165), which is contested
by the Claimant (see para. 180), that Article 41 of the VCLT permits some of the parties
of a treaty to enter into a second treaty by which they modify the previous one among

themselves and that the Lisbon Treaty is a perfectly legitimate inter se agreement

113 See in a similar vein Eskosol S.p.A. in liquidazione v. Italian Republic, 1CSID Case No. ARB/15/50, Decision
on Italy’s Request for Immediate Termination and Italy’s Jurisdictional Objection based on Inapplicability of the
Energy Charter Treaty to Intra-EU Disputes, 7 May 2019, paras. 218-220 (CL-299).

derogating from the general rules of the ECT, the Tribunal refers to the terms of
Article 41 of the VCLT (“Agreements to modify multilateral treaties between certain

of the parties only”):

(1) Two or more of the parties to a multilateral treaty may conclude an
agreement to modify the treaty as between themselves alone if:

(a) the possibility of such a modification is provided for by the treaty; or
(b) the modification in question is not prohibited by the treaty and:

(i) does not affect the enjoyment by the other parties of their rights
under the treaty or the performance of their obligations;

(ii) does not relate to a provision, derogation from which is
incompatible with the effective execution of the object and purpose
of the treaty as a whole.

(2) Unless in a case falling under paragraph 1(a) the treaty otherwise
provides, the parties in question shall notify the other parties of their
intention to conclude the agreement and of the modification to the treaty for
which it provides.

To start with, the Tribunal notes that Article 30(5) of the VCLT expressly states that
Article 30(4) of the VCLT (see para. 204) is without prejudice to Article 41 of the
VCLT. Against this background, one might make the argument that the 2007 Lisbon
Treaty should be considered an inter se modification of (Article 26 of) the ECT by the
EU Member States, introducing an implicit disconnection clause into the ECT insofar
as the relations between the EU Member States are concerned. For the purpose of
evaluating the merits of the Respondent’s argument, the Tribunal leaves aside for the
moment that, as a matter of fact, the ECT was the later treaty in relation to Articles 177

and 219 of the EEC Treaty (see para. 205).

For Article 41 of the VCLT to be applicable, it must however be clarified whether such
modification is, in the meaning of its paragraph 1, provided for or at least not prohibited
by the ECT, in particular Article 42 (“Amendments”) thereof. While the former
alternative (“provided for”) does not apply due to the lack of a pertinent provision in

the ECT (as regards Article 33 of the ECT, see para. 230), one might well take the

60

229.

230.

231.

232.

position that the ECT does not contain an explicit prohibition of such modification

either.!!4

Yet, under Article 41 of the VCLT, it is further required that the modification does not
affect the enjoyment by other parties of their rights or the performance of their
obligations under the ECT and that the modification does not relate to a provision,
derogation from which is incompatible with the effective execution of the object and
purpose of the treaty as a whole. With respect to the latter requirement (which must be
cumulatively fulfilled with the former one), the Tribunal is not convinced by the
Respondent’s submission (Resp. Counter-Memorial, para. 99) that the purported treaty
modification was about reinforcing the treatment of investors and investment within the
EU. In fact, the dispute settlement provision entitling investors to have recourse to
international arbitration is often perceived as the most essential element of an

investment treaty!!>

and is also considered by the present Tribunal as a decisive element
in conceiving of the ECT as being more favorable than EU law for purposes of the

Article 16 ECT assessment (see para. 212).

Moreover, there can be no doubt that the notification requirement laid down in
Article 41(2) of the VCLT — which applies in the present case since, contrary to the
Respondent’s submission (Resp. Counter-Memorial, para. 100), the requirement of
paragraph 1(a) is not met (see para. 226) — has not been complied with.''© Even if the
Respondent sought to rely on Article 33 ECT (Cl. Counter-Memorial, paras. 177 et seq.;
Cl. Rejoinder, para. 170), the procedural requirements of this provision would not have

been satisfied either.
Thus, the Respondent’s argument based on Article 41 of the VCLT must fail.

e) Relevance of the Enforceability of the Award

Finally, the Respondent (see para. 169) contends that in view of the fact that an award

on the merits would be unenforceable due its incompatibility with EU law and in

"14 See, however, Vattenfall AB and others v. Federal Republic of Germany, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/12, Decision
on the Achmea Issue, 31 August 2018, para. 221 (CL-197), stating that a modification excluding intra-EU claims
would be prohibited by the ECT.

2017, paras. 77, 208 (C-110).

particular the CJEU’s Achmea judgement, the Tribunal should decline, or at least refuse
to exercise, its jurisdiction in the present case in order to preserve the integrity of the
arbitral function. The Claimant (see para. 185) rejects this argument and sees no reason

for the Tribunal to find a lack of jurisdiction or admissibility.

233. While neither the ICSID Convention nor the ECT contain a rule analogous to Article 40
of the ICC Rules of Arbitration,!!’ according to which arbitral tribunals “shall make
every effort to make sure that the award is enforceable at law”, the question may be
asked whether serious problems to be expected with respect to the enforceability of the
award rendered should indeed prompt an arbitral tribunal to refrain from exercising its

jurisdiction in order to preserve the integrity of the arbitral function.''
234. In this regard, the Micula v. Romania tribunal aptly stated that

it is not desirable to embark on predictions as to the possible conduct of
various persons and authorities after the Award has been rendered,
especially but not exclusively when it comes to enforcement matters. It is
thus inappropriate for the Tribunal to base its decisions in this case on
matters of EU law that may come to apply after the Award has been
rendered. It will thus not address the Parties’ and the Commission’s
arguments on enforceability of the Award [...]. [T]he Tribunal notes that
Articles 53 and 54 of the ICSID Convention [...] apply in any event to [this]
Award.'!°

235. This was confirmed by the Eskosol v. Italy tribunal, which found:

[T]he Tribunal rejects Italy’s contention that any award it may render (in
either Party’s favour) necessarily would be unenforceable. [...] In these
circumstances, a tribunal finding that it has jurisdiction under the ICSID
Convention and the ECT should not decline to exercise that jurisdiction,
simply because there are certain scenarios under which one or the other
Party might face challenges in enforcement in certain jurisdictions, based
on their national laws and/or their other treaty obligations. This Tribunal has
a duty to exercise the jurisdiction it has found to exist, and will proceed to
do so with respect to the issues remaining in this case.!7°

The Tribunal agrees. Articles 53 and 54 of the ICSID Convention deal with post-award
issues conclusively. The Tribunal has a duty to issue an Award on the merits, to the

extent that it has jurisdiction over the claims submitted to it.
Accordingly, the Tribunal sees no reason to refrain from exercising its jurisdiction.

f) Conclusion

For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent’s first jurisdictional
objection and sees no reason to refrain from exercising its jurisdiction in the present

case.

LACK OF CONSENT DUE TO EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION CLAUSES IN THE GSE
CONVENTIONS

(1) The Parties’ Positions
a) Respondent’s Position

The Respondent submits that the requirement for unconditional consent under Article
26 of the ECT is not satisfied since all GSE conventions contain a provision on
exclusive jurisdiction or choice-of-forum clause in favor of the courts of Rome.
According to the Respondent, if an exclusivity agreement has been legitimately
reached, this agreement must prevail over the ECT (Resp. Counter-Memorial, paras.

19, 151; Resp. Reply, paras. 125, 127, 132, 137).

The Respondent argues in particular that Article 26(2)(b) of the ECT, which contains
the phrase “in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute settlement
procedure”, permits the parties to agree on a specific settlement procedure for a dispute.
Article 26(3) of the ECT expressly states that unconditional consent to the submission
of a dispute to international arbitration is given “[s]ubject only to subparagraphs (b) and
(c)”, which refers back to Article 26(2)(b) of the ECT. Accordingly, there is no
unconditional consent to international arbitration in a case where the parties have opted
for an alternative exclusive dispute settlement procedure (Resp. Counter-Memorial,

para. 155; Resp. Reply, paras. 133-136).

Republic of Germany, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/12, Decision on the Achmea Issue, 31 August 2018, para. 230
(CL-197).

63

241.

242.

243.

244.

The Respondent further submits that the language of the contractual clause contained
in the GSE conventions is particularly wide, as it does not only refer to disputes directly
arising out of such conventions, but also to any dispute related to the interpretation and
execution of “the acts it [i.e. the convention] refers to”. According to the Respondent,
this should be read as referring not just to a direct breach of contract, but also to any
other claim in any way connected to the contract, including the behavior challenged by
the Claimant in the present proceedings and allegedly indirectly affecting the GSE
conventions, either in terms of interpretation or execution thereof. In particular, the
scope of the contractual clause is not limited to issues raised exclusively under Italian
law. The Respondent further contends that no provision expressly states that Article 26
of the ECT would override contractual exclusive forum clauses nor can this be inferred

from any provision of the ECT (Resp. Counter-Memorial, paras. 153, 155-156, 160).

As regards the Claimant’s objection that there would only exist a limitation if the
Claimant had actually initiated a procedure before the domestic courts, the Respondent
insists that such an understanding of the choice-of-forum clause would deprive the
parties’ reciprocal undertakings to exclusively settle disputes related to the GSE
conventions before the courts of Rome of any actual content. Article 26 of the ECT
does more than avoiding double proceedings by leaving the parties the autonomy to

agree on a specific forum as possibly exclusive (Resp. Reply, paras. 125, 138).

Moreover, the Respondent rejects the Claimant’s submission that the Respondent’s
understanding of the exclusive jurisdiction clause would leave the Claimant in a forum
where no justice could be done. To the contrary, the Respondent argues that the
Claimant could receive substantially equal protection before the domestic courts of
Italy, namely compensation for the losses arising from the decrease in revenues

allegedly suffered by the Claimant (Resp. Reply, paras. 141, 145).

In addition, the Respondent submits that this lack of consent should be considered as
affecting the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. If the Tribunal should, however, prefer to
qualify this as a matter of admissibility, the Respondent contends that the
aforementioned arguments on the existence of an exclusive forum clause should be
deemed as having also been put for the purposes of an objection based on
inadmissibility of the claims in question (Resp. Counter-Memorial, paras. 161, 187-

193, 195).

64

245.

246.

247.

248.

b) Claimant’s Position

The Claimant contends that the Respondent’s jurisdictional objection finds no support
in Article 26(2) and (3) of the ECT. To the contrary, the text, the context and the object
and purpose of these provisions confirm that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the

present dispute (Cl. Counter-Memorial, para. 246).

The Claimant submits that the text of Article 26(2) of the ECT makes it clear that the
investor “may choose” to submit its dispute with the host State to any one of the fora
listed in sub-paragraphs (a) to (c). In offering this choice, the ECT explicitly anticipated
in sub-paragraph (b) that the parties might have previously agreed on an applicable
dispute resolution mechanism, whether under a contract or otherwise (Cl. Counter-

Memorial, para. 250; Cl. Rejoinder, para. 190).

According to the Claimant, there is one exception to the Respondent’s unconditional
consent to arbitration, i.e. where the investor has previously “submitted” the dispute to
the domestic courts. Contrary to the Respondent’s submissions, this term is
synonymous with the term “refer” the dispute to a court and does not mean to “select”
a competent court under an exclusive jurisdiction clause (Cl. Counter-Memorial,
paras. 253-255; Cl. Rejoinder, paras. 193-195). The Claimant further contends that the
Respondent’s statement made under Article 26(3)(b)(ii) of the ECT even allows an
investor who might have submitted the dispute to the domestic courts of Italy to “turn
around” and submit the same dispute to international arbitration up until the domestic
courts “resolve” the dispute (Cl. Counter-Memorial, paras. 265-266; Cl. Rejoinder,
paras. 196-197).

Moreover, the Claimant argues that the type of dispute envisaged by the GSE
conventions is not the same type of dispute as the one before the present Tribunal, as
(a) the jurisdiction clause in the GSE conventions does not cover disputes under Part
Ill of the ECT; (b) the Claimant in this arbitration is not relying directly on the GSE
conventions, but rather on the Respondent’s commitment in the ECT to observe the
obligations it has entered into vis-a-vis the Claimant’s investments; and (c) the
Claimant is not a party to the GSE conventions, but only its local subsidiaries are

(Cl. Counter-Memorial, para. 274; Cl. Rejoinder, paras. 178, 185, 209-212).

65

249.

250.

251.

252.

253.

In addition, the Claimant contends that it has not previously submitted the present
dispute to any other fora, in particular to no court or administrative tribunal in Italy.
Inasmuch as the Respondent refers to investors who have supposedly addressed the
administrative courts of Rome or the Italian Constitutional Court, the Claimant insists
that it is not one of these (Cl. Memorial, para. 256; Cl. Counter-Memorial, paras. 275-
278; Cl. Rejoinder, para. 179).

The Claimant further submits that the cases on which the Respondent relies for its
objection based on the exclusive jurisdiction clause do not actually support its
submissions. In particular, these cases do not shed light on the interpretation of Article
26 of the ECT which spells out clear rules on how to address potential conflicts of
jurisdiction. Furthermore, these cases concerned purely contractual claims whereas the
present dispute relates to treaty claims. Hence, according to the Claimant, these cases
are distinguishable based on both the text of the applicable treaties and the nature of the

alleged breaches (Cl. Counter-Memorial, paras. 282-294; Cl. Rejoinder, para. 182).

Finally, the Claimant refers to the Greentech v. Italy case in which the Respondent had
raised the same arguments and in which the tribunal dismissed Italy’s objection based

on the exclusive forum selection clause (Cl. Reply, paras. 351-359).

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Respondent’s second jurisdictional objection is based on the argument that the GSE
conventions contain a provision on exclusive jurisdiction or choice-of-forum clause in
favor of the courts of Rome and that the requirement for unconditional consent under

Article 26 of the ECT is therefore not satisfied.
The relevant parts of Article 26 of the ECT state in this regard:

qd) Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another
Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area
of the former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of
the former under Part III shall, if possible, be settled amicably.

(2) If such disputes cannot be settled according to the provisions of
paragraph (1) within a period of three months from the date on
which either party to the dispute requested amicable settlement, the
Investor party to the dispute may choose to submit it for resolution:

254.

255.

(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party
party to the dispute;

(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute
settlement procedure; or

(c) in accordance with the following paragraphs of this Article.

(3) (a) Subject only to subparagraphs (b) and (c), each Contracting
Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of
a dispute to international arbitration or conciliation in accordance
with the provisions of this Article.

(b) (i) The Contracting Parties listed in Annex ID do not give such
unconditional consent where the Investor has previously submitted
the dispute under subparagraph (2)(a) or (b).

(ii) For the sake of transparency, each Contracting Party that is

listed in Annex ID shall provide a written statement of its policies,

practices and conditions in this regard to the Secretariat no later

than the date of the deposit of its instrument of ratification,

acceptance or approval in accordance with Article 39 or the deposit

of its instrument of accession in accordance with Article 41. [...]
The GSE conventions under the Fifth Energy Account (and for that matter also under
the other Energy Accounts) contain the following clause: “For any dispute arising out
of or in relation to the interpretation and implementation of this Agreement and the
documents referred to herein, the Parties agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Courts of Rome”.!7!
The question to be addressed in the following is whether such exclusive jurisdiction
clause deprives the Tribunal of its jurisdiction, as argued by the Respondent and as
denied by the Claimant. The Respondent particularly relies on the phrase “any
applicable, previously agreed dispute settlement procedure” in Article 26(2)(b) of the
ECT for this purpose. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that a clause such as
the one contained in the GSE conventions (see para. 254) might qualify as a “previously
agreed dispute settlement procedure” in the meaning of Article 26(2)(b) of the ECT
(see, however, para. 262 regarding the question of who was party to the GSE

conventions).

"1 The Italian text of the clause reads: “Per qualsiasi contoversia derivante 0 cumunque connessa

 

all’i

F

e/o all’ ic della presente c e degli atti dalla stessa richiamati, le Parti

convengono la competenza esclusiva del Foro di Roma”. (C-060, C-063).

67

256.

257.

258.

122

The Claimant is, however, justified in equally emphasizing the phrase “the Investor
party to the dispute may choose to submit” in the chapeau of Article 26(2) of the ECT.
Hence, it is the investor’s choice on which of the three options offered by sub-
paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) of that provision it relies. According to the very terms of the
provision, the investor is in no way bound to opt for the option of sub-paragraph (b)
rather than the other two. On the basis of the choice offered by Article 26(2) of the
ECT, the Claimant has opted for sub-paragraph (c) in the present case, i.e. international
arbitration pursuant to Article 26(3) of the ECT which is perfectly compatible with the

requirements of that provision.

Yet, the picture would not be complete without considering Annex ID to the ECT, to
which both Parties have referred in their pleadings. According to Article 26(3)(b)(i) of
the ECT, “[t]he Contracting Parties listed in Annex ID do not give such unconditional
consent where the Investor has previously submitted the dispute under subparagraph

(2)(a) or (b)”. Italy is listed in Annex ID!?? and made the following declaration:

In accordance with Article 26(3)(b)(ii), Italy declares that it does not allow
the dispute between an Investor and a Contracting Party to be submitted for
international arbitration or conciliation, provided that an Investor has
already submitted the dispute to:

(a) Italian courts or administrative tribunals; or
(b) has followed an applicable, previously agreed procedure for the
settlement of disputes.

In this respect the distinction must be made between two options:

1) if the resolution of the dispute has not yet been made by the internal
judicial or conciliation bodies, the Investor may revoke his judicial action
or arbitral procedure by the procedural or lateral renouncement and apply to
other forms of dispute settlement;

(2) if a resolution or any formal or legal document of execution has already
been made to settle the dispute, conciliation or international arbitration is no
longer possible. [...]
Hence, under the regime of this declaration, the investor must opt for submitting a
dispute to either international arbitration or to the domestic courts. However, according

to the terms of Italy’s declaration, this fork-in-the-road clause is flexible in the sense

Energy Charter Secretariat, Annex ID: List of Contracting Parties Not Allowing an Investor to Resubmit the

Same Dispute to International Arbitration at a Later Stage under Article 26, nr. 14: Statement sent by the Italian
Embassy in Lisbon on 17 December 1997 (CL-154).

260.

261.

262.

that the investor, even after having submitted a dispute to the competent domestic
tribunal in Italy, may revoke this step as long as the dispute has not been resolved by

the domestic tribunal.

In the present case, the Claimant has consistently claimed “that it has not previously
submitted the dispute to the courts or administrative tribunals of Italy, nor in accordance
with any other applicable, previously agreed dispute settlement procedure”.'* There is
no reason for the Tribunal to doubt the truth of this statement. In addition, the fact that
other investors have brought their disputes before the domestic courts of Italy, notably
the Administrative Tribunal of Lazio as well as the Italian Constitutional Court, as

124

noted by the Respondent is irrelevant for the operation of Article 26 of the ECT in

the present case.

Accordingly, the restrictions contained in Annex ID have no implications regarding the
case at hand, and the Claimant was free to choose among the three options offered by
Article 26(2) of the ECT. The Claimant chose option (c), i.e. international arbitration,

and the Tribunal cannot see anything that would put this choice into question.

Inasmuch as the Respondent seems to argue that the phrase “submit a dispute”
appearing in Article 26 of the ECT and the respective Italian declaration should be
understood as also covering the “selection” of a competent court under an exclusive
jurisdiction clause (Resp. Counter-Memorial, para. 189), the Tribunal does not agree.
It is clear from the terms used that the pertinent provisions deal with the ex post-decision
where to refer an already existing dispute to, and not the ex ante-decision in what forum

disputes arising in the future should be decided.

This result is corroborated by the fact that, according to the Claimant’s submissions,
which have not been contested by the Respondent, the Claimant itself is not even party
to the GSE conventions, but only its local subsidiaries. In this regard, the Tribunal
endorses the finding of the Greentech v. Italy tribunal: “[...] Claimants are not party to
the GSE Agreements. Thus, regardless of the wide scope of the forum selection clause

in those agreements which Respondent alleges, Claimants do not appear to have

265.

standing to assert claims for breach of contract in Italian court and Respondent has not

stated otherwise”.!?5

Moreover, it is doubtful whether, had the competent domestic courts been approached
on the basis of the exclusive jurisdiction clause in the GSE conventions, they would
actually have dealt with the same dispute. It is obvious that before the present Tribunal
the Claimant claims violations of the ECT, notably the use of state powers to
unilaterally modify the GSE conventions (i.e. treaty claims).'" To the extent that a
possible claim before the domestic courts relied on alleged violations of the GSE
conventions due to non-performance of contractual obligations (i.e. contractual claims),
there would not even be identity of the dispute and the fork-in-the-road mechanism
would not be triggered in the first place. As the Vivendi I v. Argentina annulment
decision aptly put it: “where ‘the fundamental basis of the claim’ is a treaty laying down
an independent standard by which the conduct of the parties is to be judged, the
existence of an exclusive jurisdiction clause in a contract between the claimant and the
respondent state or one of its subdivisions cannot operate as a bar to the application of
the treaty standard”. !7”

For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent’s second jurisdictional
objection. The result would not be different were this objection construed as a challenge

to the admissibility of the claim in question.

LACK OF PRIOR REQUEST FOR AMICABLE SOLUTION REGARDING THE ROMANI
DECREE

(1) The Parties’ Positions
a) Respondent’s Position

The Respondent argues that the Claimant sent a number of letters to the Respondent

between 21 December 2012, and 5 May 2015, and addressed various measures, notably

"5 Greentech Energy Systems A/S et al. v. Italian Republic, SCC Case No. 2015/095, Final Award, 23 December

including the Spalma-incentivi Decree!”* and the Fifth Energy Account, but has referred
to the Romani Decree in none of these letters (Resp. Counter-Memorial, paras. 163-

168; Resp. Reply, paras. 148-150).

The Respondent further contends that one of the letters, i.e. the one of 5 May 2015,
even contains an explicit recognition that the measures taken before 2012 were not only
legitimate, but deserve praise. The Romani Decree, however, had been adopted already

in 2011 (Resp. Counter-Memorial, paras. 169-170; Resp. Reply, para. 152).

According the Respondent, the Claimant’s reference to “acts and omissions of Italy
since at least 2011” is not a sufficiently clear statement nor does the letter of 5 May
2015, apart from mentioning the Vega Project, state that the abandonment of the project
was a direct consequence of the Romani Decree. The Respondent became aware of the
claim that the Vega Project was allegedly abandoned because of the Romani Decree
only when it received the Request. The principle of good faith would have required the
investor to be clear in its claims and not to ex post construe them as referring to any
possible past behavior not related to the other claims (Resp. Reply, paras. 147, 153-
155, 161).

In addition, the Respondent argues that the claim in question is completely autonomous
and different from the other claims, which relate to plants that were already in operation
and therefore entitled to receive incentives, in that it concerns the specific situation of
a plant that never reached the stage of even applying for incentives. Given the fact that
the claim relating to the Romani Decree is based on premises completely different from
the other claims, it cannot be said that the latter would implicitly include the former

(Resp. Counter-Memorial, para. 171; Resp. Reply, paras. 158-159).

Hence, according to the Respondent, as far as the Romani Decree is concerned, no
attempt amicably to settle the dispute has ever been made. The Respondent thus submits
that the requirement under Article 26(1) of the ECT of prior request for amicable
solution has not been met as regards the claim in relation to the Romani Decree (Resp.

Counter-Memorial, paras. 171-172).

71

270.

271.

272.

273.

In addition, the Respondent argues that, should the Tribunal — contrary to the view
endorsed by the Respondent — qualify this as a matter of admissibility rather than
jurisdiction, the aforementioned arguments should be deemed as also be put for the
purposes of an objection based on inadmissibility of the claim in question (Resp.

Counter-Memorial, paras. 187, 194-195).

b) Claimant’s Position

The Claimant contends that it fully satisfied the procedural requirements in Article
26(1) and (2) of the ECT with respect to prior request for amicable solution regarding
the Romani Decree and that it specifically put the Respondent on notice of the claim
regarding Project Vega which is based on the Romani Decree. In particular, the
Claimant argues that it made multiple written requests for amicable settlement
regarding Project Vega, notably in its letter of 5 May 2015. Therefore, the Respondent
had clear notice of the Claimant’s claim regarding the Romani Decree and Project Vega
prior to the beginning of the arbitration (Cl. Memorial, paras. 253-254; Cl. Counter-
Memorial, paras. 297, 300-304, 307; Cl. Rejoinder, para. 215; Cl. Reply, para. 363).

Furthermore, the Claimant submits that the Respondent did not acknowledge receipt of
any but one of the Claimant’s letters requesting amicable settlement and that the
Respondent thus made no effort whatsoever to engage in a good faith effort to resolve
the dispute. Hence, according to the Claimant, nothing in the record suggests that any
aspect of the present dispute, including Project Vega, was capable of amicable
resolution. Moreover, following the 5 May 2015 letter, the Claimant on 29 July 2015
filed the Request that further detailed its claim based on the Romani Decree and its
impact on Project Vega, and requested the Centre not to register the Request until after
5 August 2015, i.e. the date three months after the 5 May 2015 notice of dispute letter
(Cl. Counter-Memorial, paras. 305-306).

The Claimant further contends that, in any event, the three-months waiting period in
Article 26(2) of the ECT is a procedural requirement rather than a jurisdictional one
and that this requirement is satisfied as long as the Parties have had such a three months
opportunity before the Tribunal’s decision is taken. In addition, this procedural
requirement is intended to promote amicable settlement and can therefore not be relied
upon as a delay tactic by a party that has no interest in settlement. According to the
Claimant, the Respondent never attempted to negotiate with the Claimant over any of

72

274.

275.

276.

the claims described in the aforementioned letters, including the Project Vega claim

(Cl. Counter-Memorial, paras. 308-312).

As regards the Respondent’s argument that the Claimant should be estopped from
raising the claim based on the Romani Decree, the Claimant submits that Article 26 of
the ECT does not require that the notice be in any particular form or mention any State
act by its name. Furthermore, if the Respondent had been genuinely perplexed about
the Claimant’s notice regarding Project Vega or the reference in the 5 May 2015 letter
to the Respondent’s acts and omissions dating back to 2011, the latter could have and

should have reached out for clarification (Cl. Reply, paras. 217-221).

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Respondent’s third objection is based on the argument that the requirement under
Article 26(1) and (2) of the ECT for prior request for amicable settlement is not met in

the present case in relation to the Romani Decree. According to these provisions,

qd) Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another
Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area
of the former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of
the former under Part III shall, if possible, be settled amicably.

(2) If such disputes cannot be settled according to the provisions of
paragraph (1) within a period of three months from the date on
which either party to the dispute requested amicable settlement, the
Investor party to the dispute may choose to submit it for resolution:
bok

In this regard, the Parties have notably been in dispute about the meaning and
implications of the Claimant’s Notice of Dispute Letter of 5 May 2015, which reads in

the relevant parts:

The specific acts described above, as well as related acts and omissions of
Italy since at least 2011, constitute serious and material violations of the
protections accorded to the Investors and their investments under the ECT.

As an example only, Italy’s wrongful alterations to the legal and business
framework governing renewable energy facilities caused the Investors to

"2° Notice of Legal Dispute At

abandoned [sic] a project known as Project Vega, a facility with a planned

capacity of approximately 150 MW, at an early stage of its development.'2°
The Claimant contends that, by virtue of this (and previous) letter(s), the Respondent
was properly put on notice, and invited to make an effort of amicable settlement, with
regard to Project Vega and its alleged failure due to the adoption of the Romani Decree.
In contrast, the Respondent argues that the reference to “acts and omissions of Italy
since at least 2011” is not a sufficiently clear statement and that the letter in question
does in particular not state that the abandonment of the project was a direct consequence
of the Romani Decree. According to the Respondent, in light of the completely
autonomous character of the claim regarding the Vega Project as compared to the other
claims in the present arbitration, that concern plants that were already in operation and
therefore entitled to receive incentives, the Claimant would have been required to make
a more specific statement in its letter in order for the prerequisite of prior request of

amicable settlement under Article 26 of the ECT to be met.

First, the Tribunal observes that Article 26 of the ECT, apart from laying down the
requirement that relevant disputes “shall, if possible, be settled amicably”, does not
define in any way in what form and in what degree of specificity an investor should put
the host State on notice in order to prepare the ground for an amicable settlement of the
dispute. Article 26(1) ECT differs in this regard from, for instance, Article 1119 of the
NAFTA, which requires the investor to “deliver to the disputing Party written notice of
its intention to submit a claim to arbitration at least 90 days before the claim is
submitted”!° and that such “notice shall specify”'*! four different elements about the
dispute. With respect to Article 26(1) and (2) of the ECT, the Tribunal endorses the
approach of the Greentech v. Italy tribunal, “flatly rejecting a formalistic approach

toward the notice of dispute, which need not be exhaustive”. '*?

Secondly, the good faith argument made by the Respondent cuts both ways. If, and to

the extent that, the Respondent insists that the principle of good faith requires the

investor to be clear in its claims and not to ex post construe them as referring to any
possible past behavior not related to the other claims, there exists also a bona fide
obligation on the part of the host State to request further clarification from the investors
if, from its perspective, the claim is not phrased in sufficiently clear terms. As has been

aptly stated by the Amto v. Ukraine tribunal:

The purpose of Article 26(2) — to provide for settlement discussions —
requires the avoidance of legal forms, and the facilitation of open
communication. The Investor must inform the State of the state of affairs
involving disagreement, and request amicable settlement. If the State
considers there is insufficient information to initiate discussions then the
good faith response is simply to so advise the Investor, and require more
detail. In other words, to initiate the type of communications envisaged by
Article 26(2).'*>

In the present case, the afore-cited passages regarding Project Vega (see para. 276) were

certainly sufficiently specific to call for such reaction on the part of the Respondent.

However, according to the case record, there has been no reaction at all to the

Claimant’s Notice of Dispute Letter of 5 May 2015.

Thirdly, Article 26(1) of the ECT does not state an absolute or categorical duty of
settling disputes amicably, but requires amicable settlement “if possible”. Hence,
Article 26(1) of the ECT enshrines an obligation of means calling for serious efforts on
the part of both the investor and the host State to achieve an amicable settlement. Yet,
according to the case record, there has never been any reaction on the part of the
Respondent to any of the Claimant’s five letters which it had received between 2012
and 2015.'*4 Hence, in the circumstances of the case, the Claimant was justified to
assume that it was highly doubtful whether it would actually be “possible” to amicably
settle its claims or any part or aspect of these claims. The Tribunal agrees with the Eiser
v. Spain award that Article 26(1) and (2) of the ECT simply require an investor to
“clearly inform[] Respondent of the existence of a dispute and of Claimants’ wish to

seek its amicable settlement”,!*> but do not “require the dispute to be carved into

multiple slices”.!°° This is “particularly evident” where “[nJothing in the record
suggests that further requests for negotiations [...] would have been more effective in

Taking note of the facts that (a) the Claimant filed the Request on 29 July 2015, (b) but
simultaneously requested the Centre not to register the Request until after 5 August
2015!°8, i.e. the date three months after the Claimant’s Notice of Dispute Letter of 5
May 2015, (c) that the Claimant, on 5 August 2015, submitted a supplement to the
Request explaining that the Respondent never reacted to the Notice of Dispute Letter,
and (d) that the Centre registered the Request only on 11 August 2015,'4° with the
consequence that the present arbitration proceedings were only initiated on that date,
the Tribunal is satisfied that the three-months waiting period was complied with before
the registration of the Request and that the requirement, under Article 26 of the ECT,

for prior request for amicable settlement has been met in the present case.'4!

Accordingly, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent’s third objection to its jurisdiction.
The result would not be different were this objection construed as a challenge to the
admissibility of the claim in question.

TAXATION “CARVE-OUT” REGARDING THE ADMINISTRATIVE FEE IMPOSED BY THE
FIFTH ENERGY ACCOUNT

(1) The Parties’ Positions
a) Respondent’s Position

The Respondent contends that the administrative fee imposed by the Fifth Energy
Account is a taxation measure in the meaning of Article 21 of the ECT and therefore
excluded from the scope of application of the ECT, i.e. the so-called “taxation carve-

out” (Resp. Counter-Memorial, para. 173; Resp. Reply, para. 167).

287.

The Respondent further submits that the definition of the term “taxation measures” in
Article 21(7) of the ECT is extremely large and covers an open-ended category of
measures. In particular, two features are characteristic for a “taxation measure” for the
purposes of the ECT: the source of the measure must be either in the domestic
legislation or in an international treaty, and the measure must generally relate to fiscal
measures. Beyond that, it is up to domestic law to define when a domestic measure is
of a fiscal nature, also bearing in mind the discretionary powers that the ECT
intentionally leaves to the Contracting Parties in this matter. In particular, the
Claimant’s argument that international law rather than domestic law is the decisive
parameter in defining what qualifies as a taxation measure under the ECT is inapposite.
The same holds true as regards the further submission that the term “imposte” used in
the Italian version of Article 21(7)(a)(i) of the ECT should have the same meaning as
“imposta’” under Italian law. Fiscal measures according to Article 21 of the ECT are a
wider category than “imposte” and include any measure having the characteristics of a
“fiscal measure” under Italian law (Resp. Counter-Memorial, paras. 174-175; Resp.

Reply, paras. 163-164, 173-183).

The Respondent also argues that, in the absence of legislative measures defining when
a specific measure is to be considered a fiscal measure (tributo), one should take
guidance from the pertinent caselaw, notably that of the Italian Constitutional Court.
Accordingly, irrespective of the name given to the measure, the features which qualify
a disbursement as of fiscal nature are: a) “dutifulness” of the withdrawal, i.e. that it is
established by law, b) absence of exact reciprocity between the parties, and c)
connection of the withdrawal to the public spending by linking this to an economically
significant prerequisite. Moreover, the pertinent domestic caselaw has constantly
qualified similar types of fees as fiscal measures (Resp. Counter-Memorial, paras. 177-

178, 186).

In addition, the Respondent refers to the OECD Glossary, according to which “[t]he
OECD working definition of a tax is a compulsory unrequited payment to the
government”, and considers this definition to define exactly the same elements as those
identified by the Italian Constitutional Court, i.e. a payment required by law
(“compulsory”) and absence of exact reciprocity between the parties (“unrequited”)

(Resp. Counter-Memorial, para. 179).

77

288.

289.

290.

291.

According to the Respondent, the administrative fees imposed by the Decree
establishing the Fifth Energy Account on all producers with plants benefitting from
energy accounts, were established as an annual fee corresponding to a fixed amount per
kWh and were meant to cover GSE’s general management, audit and control expenses.
The Respondent contends that the fee therefore satisfies the requirements to be qualified
as a “fiscal measure”, as it is mandatory, i.e. established by law, and does not
correspond to an identifiable specific service obtained from GSE, but is imposed on all
operators whose plants can be subject to auditing and investigation. Measures serving
the purpose of raising general revenue for covering specific public activities and thus
addressing only those categories of taxpayers that would more directly benefit from
those public activities, are to be qualified as fiscal measures. The dividing criterion
cannot be simply whether a measure addresses the generality of taxpayers or merely a
category of them, as classes of fiscal measures may address only part of the population
(Resp. Counter-Memorial, paras. 183-184; Resp. Reply, paras. 186-190; Resp.
Rejoinder, para. 168).

The Respondent contends that, contrary to the Claimant’s submissions, the use of the
term “contributo” does not indicate that the measure is a fee in the sense of a payment
for a specific service. According to the Respondent, the term is used exactly to show
that there is no synallagmatic relationship between what is paid and the services
received. In addition, the producers charged with the administrative fee contribute in
relation to the amount of incentives they receive, and not in proportion to the services
they actually receive. The lack of any synallagmatic relationship becomes manifest in
the fact that producers cannot refuse to pay by stating that they will not use the services
provided by the GSE. It is also irrelevant for the assessment whether the administrative

fee is subject to VAT or not (Resp. Reply, paras. 195-198, 202-204).

Furthermore, the Respondent refers to the CEF Energia v. Italy award in which the
tribunal had to decide on the very same claim and the very same measures and
concluded that the administrative fee constitutes a taxation measure in the meaning of

Article 21 of the ECT (Resp. Rejoinder, para. 169).

As regards the argument made by the Claimant based on Article 21(3) of the ECT, the
Respondent submits that this provision contains a “claw-back” provision with respect

to Articles 10(2) and (7) of the ECT, which concern the most-favored nation and

78

292.

293.

294.

national treatment principles. However, the Claimant has not relied on any of these
provisions in the present case, but has based its claims solely on Article 10(1) of the
ECT. In addition, a treaty of the kind of the ECT cannot be compared to the Italy-
Lebanon BIT so that the latter cannot be used to widen the interpretation of the former

(Resp. Reply, paras. 206-211; Resp. Rejoinder, paras. 171-198).

b) Claimant’s Position

The Claimant submits that it is not, as suggested by the Respondent, up to domestic law
to define when a domestic measure is a “taxation measure” in the meaning of Article
21 of the ECT. As the ECT is an instrument of international law, its terms must be
interpreted in accordance with international law (Cl. Counter-Memorial, paras. 318-

321; Cl. Rejoinder, paras. 230-232).

According to the Claimant, the ordinary meaning of “tax” is a payment imposed to fund
general public services, as opposed to a “fee” that is paid in exchange for a specific
service or public benefit. In particular, the very definition of “tax” in the OECD
Glossary on which the Respondent relies refers to ““a compulsory unrequited payment
to the government”, i.e. the government provides nothing in return to the individual unit
making the payment. In contrast, the OECD defines a “fee” as a charge for specific
services rendered by a state entity. Furthermore, the Respondent’s reliance on other
authentic texts of the ECT, on the basis of Article 33 of the VCLT, does not change that
result. Both the Spanish and French texts, just like the English and Italian versions,
confirm that the treaty term “taxation measures” is defined in terms of “taxes” (Cl.

Counter-Memorial, paras. 323-330; Cl. Rejoinder, paras. 234-243).

The Claimant further argues that the GSE administrative fee does not resemble a tax. It
is rather a charge for specific services provided to solar producers (notably for
processing the application and for management, control and inspection costs of the
GSE) as part of an incentive scheme that benefits those producers. It is not coherent for
the Respondent to argue, on the one hand, that the GSE administrative fee is equitable
because the Claimant benefits from the GSE services and, on the other, that such fee
constitutes an unrequited tax (Cl. Counter-Memorial, paras. 331-337; Cl. Rejoinder,

paras. 244-249; Cl. Reply, paras. 364-366).

79

295.

296.

297.

In addition, the Claimant contends that the fact that the administrative fee is not a tax
is also confirmed by the Respondent’s practice of charging value-added tax on that fee
(Cl. Counter-Memorial, paras. 338-341; Cl. Rejoinder, para. 250; Cl. Reply, para. 365).
It is, amongst others, on this basis that the Claimant seeks to distinguish the present
case from the CEF Energia v. Italy award where there was no mention of the fact that

the GSE charged VAT on its fee (Cl. PHB, paras. 172-174).

Finally, the Claimant submits that, should the Tribunal qualify the GSE administrative
fee as a “taxation measure” under Article 21 of the ECT, the taxation carve-out would
still not apply because Article 21(3) of the ECT specifically claws back the
Respondent’s most-favored nation obligation from the taxation exception. According
to the Claimant, the Respondent, in its bilateral investment treaty (BIT) with Lebanon,
agreed to provide, amongst others, fair and equitable treatment, without excluding
taxation measures from this obligation. Pursuant to Article 10(7) of the ECT, the
Respondent must therefore accord the Claimant’s investments “treatment no less
favourable” than that it accords to the Lebanese investors. This implies that the
Claimant is entitled to the same level of substantive protection as the Lebanese
investors, i.e. one that includes taxation measures. Contrary to the Respondent’s
submissions, the ECT and the Italy-Lebanon BIT contain the same substantive
provisions and protect the same categories of investors, including companies. In
particular, there is no support for the Respondent’s argument that the rights protected
under the Italy-Lebanon BIT are less articulated and specific as those of the ECT
(Cl. Counter-Memorial, paras. 341-349; Cl. Rejoinder, paras. 252-255; Cl. Reply,
paras. 313-335).

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Respondent’s fourth jurisdictional objection is based on the argument that the
administrative fee imposed by the Fifth Energy Account is a taxation measure in the
meaning of Article 21 of the ECT and therefore excluded from the scope of application
of the ECT (the so-called “taxation carve-out”). The Tribunal would observe at the
outset that this objection must be understood to solely relate to the claims made by the
Claimant under Article 10(1) of the ECT. As far as the Claimant argues that its
investments have become subject to indirect expropriation, the claw-back provision of

Article 21(5)(a) of the ECT applies, according to which “Article 13 [of the ECT] shall

80

apply to taxes”. Hence, in this regard the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is beyond dispute

anyway.

298. According to Article 21(1) of the ECT, “[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this Article,
nothing in this Treaty shall create rights or impose obligations with respect to Taxation
Measures of the Contracting Parties. In the event of any inconsistency between this
Article and any other provision of the Treaty, this Article shall prevail to the extent of

the inconsistency”.
299. Pursuant to Article 21(7)(a) of the ECT, “[t]he term ‘Taxation Measure’ includes:

(i) any provision relating to taxes of the domestic law of the Contracting Party
or of a political subdivision thereof or a local authority therein; and

(ii) any provision relating to taxes of any convention for the avoidance of double
taxation or of any other international agreement or arrangement by which
the Contracting Party is bound”.

300. The Parties are in disagreement whether the “fee” (“contributo”) introduced by the Fifth
Energy Account constitutes a taxation measure for the purposes of Article 21 of the
ECT. The relevant parts of Article 10 (“Management of the incentives system and

implementing regulations”) of the Decree establishing the Fifth Energy Account read:

qd) Producers applying for the feed-in tariffs set forth in this decree
shall pay to the GSE a fee for the processing of the application
equal to EUR 3 for each kW of nominal power for plants below 20
kW and EUR 2 for each kW above 20 kW. [...]

(4) In order to cover for management, control and inspection costs of
the GSE, the responsible entities acceding to the feed-in tariffs
under this decree [...] shall pay to the GSE starting 1 January 2013,
also through the set-off of the incentives due, a fee of 0.05 c euro
for each kWh of incentivized energy. [...]!4”

301. The Decree thus creates (a) a one-time administrative fee that all producers with plants
benefitting from the energy accounts have to pay to the GSE for the processing of the

application (paragraph 1) and (b) an annual fee corresponding to a fixed amount per

305.

kWh of incentivized energy in order to cover for management, control and inspection

costs of the GSE (paragraph 4).

While the definition of “taxation measure” in Article 21(7)(a) of the ECT refers to
“taxes of the domestic law of the Contracting Party”, the reference to domestic law
should not be understood in a manner that would put it completely at the disposal of the
respective Contracting Party what it designates as a “taxation measure” for the purposes
of the taxation carve-out of Article 21 of the ECT. After all, this is a term used in an
international treaty, directing the interpreter, however, to have due regard to the

definition of taxes in the respective domestic legal order.

The Tribunal takes note in this regard of the controversy between the Parties on whether
Article 21 of the ECT should be subject to a narrow reading, given that the Italian
authentic version of the ECT refers to “imposte” (see para. 293), or whether it should
be construed more broadly to cover all “tribute” which would not only include
“imposte” (taxes), but also “tasse” (fees) and “contributi” (contributions) (see
para. 285). At the same time, the Tribunal agrees with the Greentech v. Italy award that
it “need not determine whether Respondent’s broad interpretation or Claimants’
narrower interpretation of Taxation Measures is correct”.'*7

What is decisive in the definition of taxes is, and insofar the Parties appear to be in
agreement (Cl. Counter-Memorial, para. 323; Resp. Counter-Memorial, para. 177), that
the obligation to pay these taxes must be laid down in a law or other binding State
regulation and that there is no reciprocity between the payment and a service offered

by the State, but that the payment contributes to the general public spending.

These elements are also present in the OECD working definition according to which a
tax is a “compulsory unrequited payment to the government” on which both Parties
have relied in the present case (Cl. Counter-Memorial, para. 325; Resp. Counter-
Memorial, para. 179). Furthermore, according to the OECD, taxes “are described as
unrequited because the government provides nothing in return to the individual unit
making the payment, although governments may use the funds raised in taxes to provide

goods or services to other units, either individually or collectively, or to the community

2018, para. 244 (CL-271).

82

as a whole”.'44 In contrast, “[fJees charged by central or local governments can be
distinguished from taxes when they are charged as payments for the supply of particular

services by the authorities”.!4>

306. Against this background, the Tribunal considers the administrative fee established by
the Fifth Energy Account to qualify as a fee rather than a tax. Producers with plants
benefitting from the energy accounts have to make this payment for specific purposes,
i.e. for the processing of the application as well as in order to cover for management,
control and inspection costs of the GSE (see para. 301). This specific purpose is
confirmed by Recital 22 of the Decree establishing the Fifth Energy Account which
states that the Ministry “[d]eemed it appropriate and fair that those who benefit from
the feed-in tariffs for photovoltaics contribute to the coverage of charges for the

management of the photovoltaic incentive scheme”.!#°

307. The Tribunal is aware that there is no strict reciprocal or synallagmatic relationship
between the payments made to the GSE and the services offered by it. Nor do the fees
paid by the producers cover the full costs of the GSE. Similarly to the Greentech v. Italy
award,'4” the present Tribunal considers, however, that a sufficient degree of reciprocity
has been established so as to qualify the payments in question as fees (or charges, as

the Greentech v. Italy tribunal refers to them), and not as taxes.

308. The Tribunal would note in this context that the Respondent’s representation of the
pertinent caselaw of the Italian Constitutional Court on fiscal measures (see para. 286)
does not appear to be fully accurate. While the Respondent identifies the “absence of
exact reciprocity between the parties” as an element of the jurisprudence constante of

that court, the cited judgements speak of “the lack of a relationship of reciprocal nature

between the parties”,!** i.e. in the Italian original “mancanza di un rapporto

sinallagmatico tra parti”.'*? The Respondent’s reading of this phrase, and in particular
the addition of the word “exact”, promote a widened understanding of the concept of
taxes, with the Respondent suggesting that also financial measures with a considerable
degree of, but not full, reciprocity would have to be deemed to lack “exact reciprocity”
and would thus constitute taxes. The Tribunal is not convinced that this is what the

Italian Constitutional Court held in the decisions it was referred to.

The Tribunal would further observe that it is true that the CEF Energia v. Italy
tribunal'*° qualified the administrative fee in question as a tax in the meaning of Article
21 of the ECT and thus applied the taxation carve-out to it. It deserves mention,
however, that that tribunal embraced the Respondent’s reading of the Constitutional
Court’s caselaw, notably including the aforementioned criterion of “absence of exact
reciprocity between the parties”.!>! While acknowledging that the fees in question were
“consideration for a given service rendered by a public body”!*? and that “they are
imposed by Respondent (or an emanation thereof) in order to fund a service rendered
in support of photovoltaic operators”,'>* the CEF Energia v. Italy tribunal nonetheless
concluded that these fees were taxes, without however explaining how this result is
compatible with accepting the existence of a robust element of reciprocity between the
payments made and the services received. The ESPF Beteiligungs GmbH et al. v. Italy

tribunal has recently adopted the same view as CEF Energia v. Italy.!**

The conclusion of the present Tribunal, i.e. that the amounts charged to the energy
producers are actually a fee, and not a tax in the meaning of Article 21 of the ECT, is

further corroborated by the fact, which is also conceded by the Respondent (Resp.

'48 See the reference in Resp. Counter-Memorial, para. 177, n. 53 to Italian Constitutional Court, Decision

Reply, paras. 197-198), that the fees are subject to value-added tax. This is an additional

significant indicator of the non-tax character of the fee in question.!°°

For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal finds that the administrative fee imposed by the
Fifth Energy Account does not constitute a taxation measure in the meaning of
Article 21 of the ECT and thus rejects the Respondent’s fourth jurisdictional objection.
In the light of this result, there is no need for the Tribunal to entertain the Claimant’s
claim based on the claw-back provision of Article 21(3) of the ECT with respect to

most-favored nation treatment.

CONCLUSION

On the basis of the Claimant’s respective submissions in these proceedings, which have
remained uncontested by the Respondent (see paras. 150, 152), the Tribunal is satisfied
that the general jurisdictional requirements of both Article 26 of the ECT and Article 25

of the ICSID Convention are met in the present case.

Having dismissed all the Respondent’s jurisdictional objections — and seeing no reason
to take up the Respondent’s submissions on unenforceability of the award, on exclusive
forum clauses and on the requirement of prior request for amicable settlement as a
separate matter of admissibility (see paras. 237, 264 and 283) —, the Tribunal finds that
the Centre has jurisdiction and that the Tribunal has competence to decide the claims

made by the Claimant.

LIABILITY

In the present proceedings, the Claimant argues that the Respondent has breached
Articles 10(1) and 13 of the ECT and refers to three distinct sets of facts in this regard,
namely — in chronological order — the so-called Project Vega, the so-called Frosinone

plants and the changes brought about by the Spalma-incentivi Decree.

As the Parties’ have made particularly extensive submissions with respect to the latter
claim, the Tribunal will begin its liability analysis with the issues relating to the
adoption of the Spalma-incentivi Decree in 2014 (Section A; see paras. 316 et seq.) and
will only afterwards address the Claimant’s contentions regarding Project Vega and the
adoption of the Romani Decree and the Fourth Energy Account (Section B; see
paras. 478 et seq.) as well as regarding the Frosinone plants and the adoption of the

Fifth Energy Account (Section C; see paras. 533 et seq.).

THE SPALMA-INCENTIVI DECREE

In the present Section, the Tribunal discusses the submissions of the Parties with respect
to the impact of the Spalma-incentivi Decree (see para. 143) on the Claimant’s 25 PV

plants (see para. 110).

In addition, this decree also amended the provisions on the administrative management
fee that had been introduced by the Fifth Energy Account (see para. 136). Accordingly,
the Tribunal deems it preferable to consider this aspect of the Spalma-incentivi Decree

in the context of its analysis of that energy account (see paras. 613 et seq.).
qd) The Parties’ Positions
a. Claimant’s Position

The Claimant contends that the Spalma-incentivi Decree severely affected the 25
PV plants it was operating by way of both reducing the amount of FIT and deferring
the payments of the incentives, thus causing substantial economic losses to the Claimant

(Cl. Memorial, para. 148).

According to the Claimant, the immediate effect of the Spalma-incentivi legislation was
the unilateral modification of the main terms of the GSE conventions. Each GSE

convention contained a provision explicitly stating the amount of the FIT, which for all

86

322.

323.

plants (except the two Frosinone plants) was to remain constant over the duration of the
agreement, i.e. for 20 years. Under the terms of the Spalma-incentivi Decree, due to the
lack of an express choice on the part of the Claimant, Option C applied to the Claimant’s
PV plants by default!*° and resulted in a 6 % to 8 % cut in FIT, depending on the plant’s
power, starting from 1 January 2015 (Cl. Memorial, paras. 149-151; Cl. PHB,
paras. 6-10).

Furthermore, according to the Claimant, under the new incentives payment terms
introduced by the Spalma-incentivi Decree, the 25 PV plants of the Claimant no longer
received FIT on a monthly basis in amounts corresponding to the actual production of
solar energy. Rather, amounts due in a given year were both curtailed and partially
deferred to the next year, thus negatively affecting the cash flows of the Claimant’s

subsidiaries (Cl. Memorial, para. 152).

Moreover, the Claimant submits that its revenues were negatively impacted by the
increased administrative fees imposed by the Spalma-incentivi Decree (Cl. Memorial,

para. 153; Cl. PHB, paras. 11-14).

The Claimant further argues that the strain imposed on the cash flows by the Spalma-
incentivi Decree affected the ability of the Claimant’s subsidiaries to meet their
obligations under the project financing agreements they had entered into based on the
FIT promised by the Respondent. The pertinent repayment schedules provided that, in
the event that the relevant financial ratios fell below certain thresholds, the subsidiaries
would be prohibited from distributing dividends to the Claimant (Cl. Memorial,
paras. 148, 155-156).

According to the Claimant, already in July 2014, the reduced cash flows due to the
retroactive cut of the FIT and the amended FIT payment terms caused the
aforementioned financial ratios to drop below the allowed thresholds, thus resulting in
the imposition of a dividends distribution block. All the revenues coming from the sale
of solar energy and from the FIT were required to be used to pay the loans and the
plants’ operating costs, with no amount left to pay dividends to the holding company.!°7

In addition, three of the Special Purpose Vehicles (SPV) established to operate the

156 See Witness Statement of Claudio Pisi, paras. 48-50.
157 See ibid., para. 56.

87

324.

325.

326.

Claimant’s PV plants went into so-called “technical default”, i.e. the respective
financial ratios dropped to a level where disposal of any proceeds was not possible
anymore without the lenders’ consent, except in specific cases (Cl. Memorial, paras.

156-157).

The Claimant argues that, against this background, it decided to renegotiate the terms
of the banking loans in order to solve the distribution block situation and avoid the
possible consequences of technical defaults.'** In September 2015, the Claimant was
able to agree on the terms of the restructuring. The new terms included a EUR 15.7
million partial prepayment of the loans, the rescheduling of payment dates and the
modification of some of the financial ratios.'°° On this basis, in October 2015, there
was agreement with the banks to modify some of the terms of the banking loans. In
March 2016, final agreements adopting the amendments were concluded. The Claimant
submits in this regard that, while the renegotiation of the banking loans allowed the
resuming of the distribution of dividends, it also meant that the Claimant ultimately
bore all of the losses resulting from the Spalma-incentivi legislation (Cl. Memorial,

paras. 158-160).

On this basis, the Claimant contends that the Respondent’s adoption of the Spalma-
incentivi Decree violated both (i) Article 10(1), last sentence, of the ECT on the
observance-of-obligations or umbrella clause and (ii) Article 10(1), first and second
sentences, of the ECT on fair and equitable treatment (Cl. Memorial, paras. 316, 342;

Cl. Reply, para. 35; Cl. Reply PHB, para. 3).

(i) Umbrella clause

As regards the former, the Claimant argues that the Respondent used its sovereign
legislative power to change the terms of the obligations to the detriment of the
investment, thus breaching the ECT’s observance-of-obligations clause. In this regard,
the Claimant first submits that the Respondent’s obligations under Article 10(1), last
sentence, of the ECT not only cover obligations entered into with an investor, but also
with an investment. As the GSE conventions were entered into with the Claimant’s

local subsidiaries and as these companies were investments in the meaning of

'58 See ibid., para. 57; Silver Ridge Power, Discussion Memorandum to the Board of Directors, 30 January 2015,
1-2 (C-084).
'59 See Silver Ridge Power, Discussion Memorandum to the Board of Directors, 14 September 2015, 1-2 (C-085).

88

327.

328.

329.

Article 1(6)(b) of the ECT, the GSE entered into obligations with respect to the
Claimant’s investments (Cl. Memorial, paras. 318-320; Cl. PHB, para. 7).

Secondly, according to the Claimant, the Respondent’s contention (see para. 345) that
the term “entered into” in Article 10(1), last sentence, of the ECT implies a negotiation
between two parties, while each Energy Account was a general, non-negotiated
measure, is baseless. It is commonplace that parties enter into binding obligations
without negotiation (Tr. 23 September 2019, 30:12-18 [Legum]). In addition, the
context of Article 10(1), last sentence, of the ECT itself contemplates the formation of
agreements without negotiation since Article 26 of the ECT provides for an agreement
to arbitrate based on the investor’s acceptance of the State’s consent to arbitration given
in the Treaty which is not preceded by any negotiation between the host State and the
investor (Cl. PHB, paras. 20-22; Cl. Reply PHB, para. 11; Tr. 23 September 2019,
30:17-25 — 31:1-8 [Legum]).

Thirdly, the Claimant argues that the GSE is a State-owned entity, controlled by the
Ministry of Economy and Finance and in charge of regulating the renewable energy
market, including administering the Energy Accounts. In the Claimant’s view, the GSE
thus expressly exercises governmental authority as concerns electricity generated from
renewable sources in Italy, has the status of a State organ under Italian law and forms
part of the administration, i.e. of the executive branch of the Italian Republic. Applying
the pertinent principles of attribution of conduct to a State, as notably laid down in
Articles 4 and 5 of the Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful
Acts, the GSE acted on behalf of the Respondent when entering into the GSE
conventions (Cl. Memorial, paras. 321-331; Cl. Reply, paras. 44-46; Cl. Reply PHB,
para. 10).

Fourthly, the Claimant contends that, contrary to Article 10(1), last sentence, of the
ECT, the Respondent breached the obligations it had entered into with the Claimant’s
investments. In the Claimant’s view, the Respondent did so by failing to observe the
obligations set out in the GSE conventions, namely that each of the Claimant’s 25 PV
plants would receive the applicable FIT (under the Second, Third, Fourth or Fifth
Energy Accounts, as the case may be) for 20 years from the plant’s entry into operation.
Thus, the Spalma-incentivi Decree caused de facto the unilateral repudiation by the

Respondent of the key aspect of the GSE conventions. In addition, these conventions

89

330.

331.

stipulated that amendments could be made only if agreed to in writing. In spite of this
provision, the Claimant argues, the Spalma-incentivi Decree unilaterally amended the
GSE conventions by imposing a retroactive reduction of FIT and by modifying the
payment terms (Cl. Memorial, paras. 332-335; Cl. Reply, para. 42; Cl. Reply PHB,
para. 6).

Fifthly, the Claimant argues that, contrary to the Respondent’s submissions (see
para. 346), there is no need to show an “autonomous act” of the GSE. In a similar vein,
it is irrelevant that the Spalma-incentivi legislation was neither decided nor adopted by
the GSE. Furthermore, according to the Claimant, the fact that the /ex contractus of the
GSE conventions is Italian law does not imply, as insinuated by the Respondent, that
the application of the umbrella clause is ruled out when a breach of the obligation is not
established under the municipal law governing the obligation. In particular, no case and
no commentator has ever adopted the position put forward by the Respondent that the
umbrella clause only applies to breaches of contract under municipal law and has no
application where, as is the case here, a State uses its sovereign powers to interfere with
an investor’s contractual bargain through legislative change. In the Claimant’s view,
the Respondent’s invocation of its own internal law, as interpreted by the Italian
Constitutional Court, cannot shield it from its international responsibility for breaches

of the ECT (Cl. Reply, paras. 47-55; Cl. PHB, paras. 31-43).

Sixthly, the Claimant rejects the Respondent’s contention that the GSE conventions do
not reflect contractual obligations, but commitments contemplated or required by
legislation which do not fall within the ECT’s observance-of-obligations clause.
According to the Claimant, the GSE conventions are contracts which set out specific
obligations vis-a-vis specific investments of the Claimant and are as such undisputedly
covered by Article 10(1), last sentence, of the ECT. In particular, each of these
conventions was denominated as an agreement between, on the one hand, the GSE and,
on the other, a given local development company, indirectly owned and controlled by
the Claimant at all relevant times. The price or FIT at which the GSE would buy
electricity was clearly set out as well as the method of payment, the duration of contract
and other specific obligations concerning access to documents or checks and
inspections. Each GSE convention thus concerned a specific investment, responsible

for a specific PV plant. Furthermore, the Claimant submits that the record does not

90

332.

333.

334.

335.

support the Respondent’s suggestion that legislation or regulation dictated the entire
content of the GSE conventions (see Cl. Reply, paras. 67-72; Cl. PHB, paras. 25-30;
Cl. Reply PHB, paras. 8-9).

In a similar vein, the Claimant contradicts the Respondent’s contention (see para. 346)
that the GSE conventions were merely accessory contracts, which simply transpose
legal provisions. To the contrary, the Energy Accounts, GSE tariff recognition letters
and the GSE conventions concluded with the Claimant’s subsidiaries amount to
obligations entered into with specific PV operators, i.e. the Claimant’s investments. In
any event, in the Claimant’s view, the GSE conventions are private law contracts under

Italian law, as also indicated by the Romani Decree (Cl. Reply, paras. 73-80).

Moreover, the Claimant rejects the Respondent’s submission (see para. 344) that
umbrella clauses do not allow the inclusion of legislative and regulatory obligations
within their scope, but concludes from the broad wording of Article 10(1), last sentence,
of the ECT (“any obligation”), as well as from the pertinent caselaw, that umbrella
clauses protect specific undertakings which the State has entered into by contract or
otherwise (Cl. Memorial, para. 304; Cl. Reply, paras. 58-66). In any event, the Claimant
deems the Respondent’s contention to be beside the point because there is no dispute

that the ECT’s umbrella clause covers contractual obligations (Cl. Reply, para. 67).

(ii) Fair and equitable treatment

As concerns the latter claim, i.e. the breach of the fair and equitable treatment clause of
Article 10(1), second sentence, of the ECT, the Claimant argues that the Spalma-
incentivi Decree both violated its legitimate expectations and failed to ensure the
stability and transparency of the Italian legal framework. The Claimant contends that
each element of its legitimate expectations and its stability and transparency claims is

met in the present case (Cl. Memorial, paras. 337, 342; Cl. PHB, paras. 49-54).

First, according to the Claimant, the Respondent made specific representations that it
would maintain a stable legal framework, including the levels of FIT fixed by law and
in contracts. In particular, the Respondent committed in each Energy Account that, once
a PV plant qualified for a given FIT, that applicable tariff was granted for 20 years.
With respect to the Claimant’s 25 PV plants, these specific commitments were

memorialized in writing in the respective GSE conventions. In the Claimant’s view, the

91

336.

337.

338.

record therefore establishes that the Respondent adopted the Energy Accounts with the
specific aim to induce investments in solar energy and, in order to achieve this purpose,
gave specific assurances to specific investments of the Claimant that these investments
would receive the specified FIT for the whole 20 year period (Cl. Memorial, paras. 337-
338; Cl. Reply, paras. 107-118; Cl. PHB, para. 54).

Secondly, the Claimant argues that it relied on these representations when making its
long-term investments which required a very substantial capital investment upfront. In
particular, the Claimant submits that it relied on two main elements when making its
investment: the FIT rates guaranteed for 20 years upon a plant’s entry into operation
and the stability and visibility of the legal framework which would not be changed
without proper advance notice. In the Claimant’s submission, the certainty provided by
the fixed FIT for a 20-year period was a critical factor in justifying decisions to invest
in PV plants in Italy. Furthermore, the Claimant contends that it relied not only on the
GSE conventions, but also on the Italian legal framework as a whole, from the Energy
Accounts through the GSE tariff recognition letters to the GSE conventions
(Cl. Memorial, para. 339; Cl. Reply, paras. 119-126; Cl. PHB, paras. 56-58, 87-92;
Cl. Reply PHB, paras. 15-16).

Thirdly, the Claimant argues that its expectations based on these commitments were
reasonable and legitimate under the circumstances. The representations were reflected
in official acts that were unqualified. In a similar vein, the GSE conventions required
the consent of both parties for an amendment or modification of the obligations to be

valid (Cl. Memorial, para. 340; Cl. PHB, para. 61).

Fourthly, the Claimant contends that the Respondent adopted measures directly
contradicting its prior representations and fundamentally altering the legal framework,
thus frustrating the Claimant’s investments due to a sharp and unexpected reduction in
FIT. In particular, the adoption of the Spalma-incentivi Decree in 2014 violated the
Claimant’s legitimate expectations that its 25 PV plants would receive a fixed FIT for
20 years from the start of operation of these plants. In the Claimant’s submission, the
retroactive cut in FIT imposed by Option C, which applied to the Claimant’s
subsidiaries by default, caused an immediate reduction in FIT of 7 % to 8 % for each
of the 25 PV plants, resulting in a loss of EUR 37.5 million in future cash flows, and

thus deprived the Claimant of a significant part of its projected revenues. Contrary to

92

339.

340.

the Respondent’s contention that the Spalma-incentivi legislation was designed to avoid
a disproportionate remuneration of PV investors, the expected internal rate of return of
the Claimant’s PV plants was not excessive. As a matter of fact, the actual return on the
Claimant’s investments was negative, even after the sale of the Italian assets in 2017
and 2018. Hence, the Claimant submits that it realized a substantial loss on its

investments in Italy (Cl. Memorial, para. 341; Cl. Reply, paras. 128-143, 157-163).

The Claimant further contends that the Spalma-incentivi Decree was in no sense a
necessary “fine-tuning” of the FIT, but an unreasonable and disproportionate measure
on the part of the Respondent. In changing the basic parameters of the Energy Accounts
retroactively, this legislation was not just operating a “re-modulation” of tariffs or a
modest reduction of the applicable FIT, but the Respondent suddenly and
fundamentally altered the regulatory framework under which the Claimant had made
its investment in a way that was not foreseeable. In addition, according to the Claimant,
there can be no “fine-tuning” in an ex ante support scheme such as the Energy Accounts
where the government guarantees incentive payments at a specified level which the
investor will take into account when planning the project, assessing the potential
profitability and deciding whether to invest. The situation would be different in an ex
post scheme where the government guarantees a certain rate of return and then adjusts
the support periodically to maintain the desired return despite fluctuations in costs and
performance. For plants in operation that had secured a specific tariff for 20 years, the
Claimant could not have anticipated the reduction imposed by the Spalma-incentivi
Decree (Cl. Reply, paras. 144-156; Cl. PHB, paras. 65-78; Cl. Reply PHB,
paras. 19-20).

Finally, the Claimant also rejects the Respondent’s argument (see paras. 341, 352) that
without the Spalma-incentivi Decree, Italy’s renewable incentive system would have
been at risk of default because of an over-excessive burden on consumers. According
to the Respondent, this excessive burden would have led to a reduction in consumption
on the part of the consumers, making it necessary to modify the incentive system to
guarantee its sustainability, but at the same time to ensure that renewable energy
producers receive a “fair remuneration”. The Claimant argues, however, that there is
no evidence that, absent this legislation, electricity consumers would have faced

increasing charges in relation to the FIT. In addition, the Spalma-incentivi Decree

93

341.

342.

caused only a small reduction in prices to relevant consumers, notably particular types
of industrial users, but excluded from its scope all residential customers. Moreover,
according to the Claimant, the decrease in industrial electricity demand which can be
observed since 2011 is the result of increasing energy efficiency and Italy’s low GDP
growth. As electricity demand is very inelastic to price, the Spalma-incentivi Decree,
which slightly reduced the electricity bill of some industrial consumers, was therefore
unlikely to stimulate any significant increase in demand for electricity. In the
Claimant’s view, there is thus no support for the Respondent’s argument that the Energy
Account incentive scheme would have been at risk of default save for adoption of the
Spalma-incentivi legislation (Cl. Reply, paras. 164-180; Cl. PHB, paras. 79-86;
Cl. Reply PHB, para. 18).

b. Respondent’s Position

The Respondent argues that its intervention — first by the Destinazione Italia Decree
and subsequently by the Spalma-incentivi legislation — was necessary to avoid the
overburdening of the consumers who pay the main share of the expenses for the
renewable energy incentives through their electricity bills. An additional increment of
the costs would have led to a further reduction of energy consumption, with the result
of exposing the FIT mechanism itself to a high risk of financial instability. In addition,
the Respondent contends that, following the economic crisis that also had a fierce
impact on Italy, there was a need to reinvigorate the Italian industry. At the same time,
costs continued to decrease for PV energy producers and returns from operating plants
were still extremely high compared to original estimates. In sum, the Respondent’s
intervention was motivated by promoting the sustainability of the renewable energy
system, thus also benefiting the PV energy producers (Resp. Counter-Memorial,
paras. 311-113, 319, 323-325, 335, 391; Resp. Rejoinder, paras. 423-440; Resp. PHB,
paras. 16-17; Resp. Reply PHB, paras. 43, 46).

According to the Respondent, the Spalma-incentivi Decree contained a set of
emergency measures to cope with the exceptional economic situation prevailing in Italy
at the time. While encompassing provisions of a different nature, all of these provisions
had the objective of enhancing competitiveness of Italian markets, including the
reduction of costs of electricity for small- and medium size businesses through a

reduction and redistribution of the general charges of the electricity system. Thus, the

94

343.

344.

aforementioned Decree did not, as argued by the Claimant (see para. 338), abrogate
Italy’s incentive payment regime and replace it with a new system, but remodulated
incentives under the existing system and therefore implemented a fine-tuning of a still
valid and stable support system. The Respondent further argues that this did not occur
abruptly, but through progressive measures, starting with voluntary and moving on to
compulsory remodulation, albeit with the offering of alternatives to the PV energy
producers. Moreover, the remodulated tariffs did not apply retroactively, but only to
future incentives. In this regard, according to the Respondent, a distinction is necessary
between, on the one hand, situations where the measure in question removes legal
effects already completed and concluded (so-called “claw back” provisions) and, on the
other, situations where long-term relationships are affected by the measure in the sense
that it intervenes in the regulation, but only for the future; the latter is the relevant
scenario in the present case. In sum, the Spalma-incentivi legislation was part of the
general and progressive readjustment of the support schemes for renewable energy and
adopted reasonable and proportionate solutions in this regard (Resp. Counter-
Memorial, paras. 332-335, 388-390; Resp. Rejoinder, paras. 409-422; Resp. PHB,
paras. 18-19).

Against this background, the Respondent rejects both claims, i.e. (i) that the adoption
of the Spalma-incentivi Decree violated Article 10(1), last sentence, of the ECT on the
umbrella clause and (ii) that it further breached Article 10(1), first and second
sentences, of the ECT on fair and equitable treatment (Resp. Counter-Memorial, paras.

28-29; Resp. Rejoinder, paras. 367-368; Resp. PHB, paras. 25-26).

(i) Umbrella clause

As regards the first claim, the Respondent first submits that both the text and function
of the umbrella clause do not allow the inclusion of legislative and regulatory
obligations within its scope. The reason for this exclusion lies in the rationale of the
umbrella clause which is to “internationalize” contractual obligations which otherwise
would remain excluded by the scope of the investment treaty, due to their private nature.
Therefore, Legislative Decree No. 387/2003, the Romani Decree, as well as the Second,
Third, Fourth and Fifth Energy Accounts are not covered by the ECT’s umbrella clause
(Resp. Counter-Memorial, paras. 427-428; Resp. Rejoinder, paras. 505, 509-512).

95

345.

346.

347.

The Respondent further contends that the term “entered into”, as contained in
Article 10(1), last sentence, of the ECT, implies an activity of negotiation between the
parties. However, the Energy Account Decrees were not at all negotiated between
investors and the Respondent. The same holds true for the GSE conventions which are
not the result of a free negotiation between the parties, but are unilaterally established
by, and entirely subject to, the general regulatory framework (Resp. Rejoinder,

paras. 213, 508-509; Resp. PHB, paras. 49, 102-103; Resp. Reply PHB, para. 50).

In addition, the Respondent argues that the GSE conventions are different from
genuinely private contracts. They are of special nature and can only be understood
within the regulatory context they depend on. In fact, they represent the final and lowest
level of a single and unitary general regulatory framework. According to the
Respondent, they are to be qualified as “accessory contracts” (“contratto accessorio”
or “contratto accessivo’’) establishing the operational rules to implement the relevant
public measure they are connected to. In particular, as opposed to private contracts, the
parties do not autonomously determine the essential elements of the agreement, which
are established outside the contract by the legislative and/or regulatory act they depend
upon. In fact, the whole of the GSE conventions is a mere reproduction of the pertinent
regulatory acts, without the need that each individual word or sentence be repeated.
Hence, the Respondent did not undertake any autonomous commitments under the ECT
by having the GSE sign these agreements, compared to the obligations undertaken
through the adoption of the relevant general measures. Put differently, the GSE
conventions must be considered jointly with the public measure as a unique act for the
purposes of international investment law. This holds true irrespectively of the reference
to private law made in the Romani Decree (Resp. Counter-Memorial, paras. 116-117,
253, 266-267, 428-429; Resp. Rejoinder, paras. 209-215, 524-527; Resp. PHB, paras.
51-53; Resp. Reply PHB, para. 51).

Moreover, the Respondent contends that, contrary to the submissions of the Claimant
(see para. 328), the GSE is by no means the regulator of the renewable energy sector.
The authority in charge of regulation of the sector is rather the AEEG. Accordingly, the
drafting of the standard agreements governing the concrete disbursement of the
incentives, i.e. the GSE conventions, is not the competence of the GSE, but of the

AEEG (Resp. Counter-Memorial, para. 252; Resp. Rejoinder, para. 209).

96

348.

349.

350.

351.

352.

Furthermore, according to the Respondent, the Claimant did not actually prove any
infringement of the GSE conventions by the Respondent. In particular, the Claimant
did not challenge any conduct by the GSE, and as far as the Respondent’s regulatory
measures are concerned, they do not have any relevance with respect to the
infringement of the GSE conventions. As a matter of law, as further argued by the
Respondent, contracts produce their obligatory effects only between the parties; thus,
the Respondent’s regulatory measures were intrinsically not apt to be a violation of the

obligations set out in the GSE conventions (Resp. Counter-Memorial, paras. 432-438).

In addition, the Respondent contends that also the Italian Constitutional Court did not
accept that the conventions between the GSE and the investors were contracts governed
by private law, but that they were of a regulatory nature and had the character of
accessory agreements (Resp. Counter-Memorial, para. 440; Resp. Rejoinder, paras.

524, 530; Resp. Reply PHB, paras. 52-61).

(ii) Fair and equitable treatment

With respect to the second claim, the Respondent denies that the fair and equitable

treatment clause of the ECT has been breached in the present case.

In this regard, the Respondent first argues in a general perspective that the legitimacy
—and thus the legal protection — of an expectation may not be simply determined by
relying on the legislative framework existing in a State at the time of the investment,
but must also take into account the State’s fundamental sovereign prerogative of
legislating, i.e. its power to regulate. Otherwise, a State would have the obligation to
freeze its own normative activity each time this activity requires modification of a rule
existing at the time of the investment and negatively affecting a foreign investment. In
the Respondent’s view, stability of legislation is not at all equivalent to a freezing
clause, but implies a degree of reasonable modification of existing rules. At the same
time, the Respondent concedes that not all regulatory modifications made by the host
State would be legitimate, notably if the host State acted either unfairly, unreasonably
or inequitably in the exercise of its legislative power (Resp. Counter-Memorial, paras.

451-455, 467; Resp. Rejoinder, paras. 453-471).

As concerns the purported legitimate expectations on the part of the Claimant, the

Respondent further contends that the renewable energy market is a regulated market

97

353.

354.

355.

and that incentives are subsidies given to a category of producers with the objective of
correcting a market failure to support consumption of PV energy. According to the
Respondent, this needs to be understood within the context of the pertinent EU
legislation, i.e. the First and Second Renewable Directives, but also the EU’s State aid
regime, which requires that no excessive subsidies artificially distorting the market be
granted and the sustainability of the overall scheme be ensured. Any prudent investor
operating in a regulated market, in particular the Claimant as a very sophisticated
investor, should be aware of such a market’s dynamics and of the specific role of the
regulator in this context. Incentives may be necessary to support the market to maturity,
but need not become a source of overcompensation and consequently market distortion
and inefficiency. Adjustment of policies is therefore an inherent feature of these
markets and of the renewable energy market in particular (Resp. Counter-Memorial,

paras. 382-384, 394; Resp. Rejoinder, paras. 201-202; Resp. PHB, para. 4).

In addition, the Respondent states that an adequate assessment of risk would have
required the Claimant to take into consideration that it entered the Italian market at a
late stage, when the support mechanism was close to reaching its sustainability limits,
as well as the general crises that all European economies had undergone since 2009.
The Respondent contends that the Claimant could not simply rely on extremely
favorable incentives and ignore any other reasonable assessment of the context in which
it was operating. The Respondent particularly submits in this regard that no legal due
diligence could be found in the exhibits submitted by the Claimant (Resp. Counter-
Memorial, para. 395; Resp. PHB, para. 7; Resp. Reply PHB, para. 13).

Furthermore, the Respondent submits that the pertinent legal framework contained
general measures addressed to the generality of the public, i.e. to anyone wanting to
produce solar energy, irrespective of legal status, nationality or dimension. Hence,
contrary to the Claimant’s contention (see para. 335), the incentivization regime for PV
energy production was not put in place with a specific aim to induce foreign

investments (Resp. Reply PHB, paras. 8-9).

Moreover, the Respondent contends that, beyond the Claimant’s insistence on investor
confidence, the goals of the pertinent EU renewable energy legislation such as
efficiency, competitiveness and sustainability have to be taken into account as relevant

context for the Respondent’s development of PV energy support schemes as well as the

98

356.

357.

358.

investors’ legitimate expectations in this respect. In particular, while permitting support
schemes as a public measure to intervene in the market, EU legislation is concerned
with efficiency, which must include cost-related measures and the avoidance of
overcompensation. According to the Respondent, EU legislation always requests
national measures to be sustainable and consistent with EU market principles, notably

including State aid rules (Resp. Rejoinder, paras. 376-379).

Furthermore, the Respondent submits that a distinction needs to be made between a
“stable” and a “fixed” tariff. Incentives that remain stable do not necessarily remain
identical. The Respondent argues that the Claimant has not been able to prove that
fixed tariffs were promised or specific commitments were made by statutory act.
According to the Respondent, with its interpretation of the relevant legal framework the
Claimant incorrectly takes off itself any regulatory risk (in addition to the elimination
of the market risk effectuated by the FIT), notwithstanding that the Claimant acts in a
regulated market which by definition has a component of regulatory risk precisely
arising from the possibility of redefinition of administrative conditions to adjust to
policy needs (Resp. Counter-Memorial, paras. 385-386; Resp. Rejoinder, paras. 380-
383, 386-389).

According to the Respondent, the fact that the Claimant could not rely on fixed tariffs
also becomes clear when considering the time of the investment because the entitlement
to obtain a specific tariff only came into existence when the PV plant in question entered
into operation and was connected to the grid, i.e. after the investment date. In addition,
there might be various external reasons for not obtaining the tariff initially expected,
e.g. due to construction delays. As a matter of fact, none of the Claimant’s investment
companies had obtained either a tariff recognition letter or a GSE convention at the time
of investment. As legitimate expectations have to be assessed at the time of making the
investment, allowing investors to rely on the GSE conventions for the purposes of
legitimate expectations would amount to an “ex post assurance” of the stability of the
incentive regime for renewable energy (Resp. Counter-Memorial, paras. 471-474;
Resp. Rejoinder, paras. 392-400, 407; Resp. PHB, paras. 7, 31-47; Resp. Reply PHB,
paras. 4, 6, 10-12).

Thus, the Respondent only accepts that the Claimant could legitimately rely on the

overall or macro-stability of the incentive regimes in the sense of ensuring a “fair

99

359.

360.

remuneration” over the long term, as provided by the pertinent primary legislation,
including the fact that the incentives would be maintained at a level, both in terms of
amount and duration, that would guarantee a fair return on the Claimant’s investment.
At the same time, an expectation that incentives would be ironclad, irrespective of the
fact that they proved to be excessive and that they were not socially sustainable any
longer, including the risk of failure of the system itself, could not be considered
legitimate. Hence, the crucial question is to assess whether the challenged measures of
the Respondent were reasonable, equitable and proportionate with respect to the
expectations of stability of the incentive regime that investors were legitimate to have
(Resp. Counter-Memorial, paras. 476-477; Resp. Rejoinder, paras. 472-484;
Resp. PHB, para. 5).

In this regard, the Respondent contends that it did not provide any stabilization clause
in its regulation concerning PV plants. The Spalma-incentivi Decree simply reshaped
the incentives for PV plants, but left the basic structure of the incentive regime intact.
‘When assessing the reasonableness and proportionality of the adopted measures, what
is important are the way the host State changes its previous regulation, the consistency
of such modification and the concrete reasons underlying it. Furthermore, according to
the Respondent, the absence in previous legislation of the express possibility for tariffs
to be modified would not limit to any extent the power of the State to introduce such a
change. To the contrary, only an express prohibition in a previous statutory act to
modify, i.e. a stabilization clause, would have impeded the State from doing so
(Resp. Counter-Memorial, paras. 480-489; Resp. Rejoinder, paras. 216-223, 390;
Resp. Reply PHB, para. 44).

In particular, the Respondent submits that, at the time when the Claimant started its
investments, the operational costs to produce PV energy had been sharply reduced due

to technological progress and economies of scale. The progressive reductions of FIT in

 

the Third and Fourth Energy Accounts, however, were not su ent to overcome the
imbalance between PV investors’ remuneration and the reduced costs for producing
electricity, also in reason of the huge growth of PV plants in Italy, where the conditions
for investors were particularly favorable compared to the rest of Europe. This situation,
the Respondent argues, was detrimental for consumers who entirely bore the growing

economic weight of the incentives. After an attempt in 2013 to favor voluntary

100

361.

362.

363.

364.

mechanisms via the Destinazione Italia Decree, in 2014 the Respondent adopted the
Spalma-incentivi Decree with the aim of balancing the necessity of avoiding excessive
and cost-disproportionate burdens on consumers with the commitment to grant PV
investors an equitable remuneration of the costs of investment and operation (Resp.

Counter-Memorial, paras. 490, 496).

In sum, according to the Respondent, the Spalma-incentivi Decree is reasonable, as it
is aimed at balancing the need to grant incentives to PV energy with the necessity to
respect a cost-effectiveness criterion, to avoid a disproportionate remuneration of PV
investors and to protect the interests of final consumers. In addition, the Respondent
considers the aforementioned legislation to be proportionate because the concrete way
of reshaping the incentive tariffs is made by providing different mechanisms, notably
by leaving PV investors the possibility of opting for one of three options, thus having a
limited impact on the PV investors. Moreover, the Respondent deems the Spalma-
incentivi Decree to be consistent and coherent with the existing regulatory framework,
both at the Italian and the EU levels (Resp. Counter-Memorial, paras. 497-501;
Resp. Rejoinder, paras. 441-452, 486-496; Resp. PHB, para. 8).

Moreover, the Respondent submits that information documents such as guides or
brochures of the GSE or other institutional subjects that have over time conducted
information campaigns on the Energy Account regime cannot be the basis of protected

assurances to the benefit of the Claimant (Resp. PHB, para. 54).

The Respondent further argues that, in April 2018, the Claimant sold 18 PV plants to
Cubico Sustainable Development.'® This shows that the plants are still valuable assets

(Resp. Counter-Memorial, para. 406).

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Claimant contends, and the Respondent rejects, that the adoption of the Spalma-
incentivi Decree violates, on the one hand, Article 10(1), last sentence, of the ECT on
the observance-of-obligations or umbrella clause (a.) and, on the other, Article 10(1),
first and second sentences, of the ECT on fair and equitable treatment (b.). The Tribunal

will address these two claims in turn.

160 See Exhibit R-039.

101

365.

366.

367.

368.

369.

a. Umbrella clause

Article 10(1), last sentence, of the ECT states: “Each Contracting Party shall observe
any obligations it has entered into with an Investor or an Investment of an Investor of

any other Contracting Party”.

The Claimant argues that the agreements which the GSE concluded with the
corresponding local development companies concerning each of the Claimant’s 25 PV
plants (see para. 109), i.e. the so-called GSE conventions, constitute obligations which
the Respondent entered into with the Claimant in the meaning of the afore-cited
umbrella clause of the ECT and that the Respondent subsequently used its sovereign
legislative power to change the terms of these obligations to the detriment of the
investment, thus breaching the umbrella clause. The Claimant justifies its claim with a

series of arguments all of which the Respondent rejects.

The Tribunal notes that the Claimant has also referred to the debate as to whether the
ECT’s umbrella clause extends exclusively to contractual obligations or may also cover
legislative or regulatory acts (Cl. Memorial, para. 304; Cl. Reply, para. 64; see
para. 333). At the same time, the Claimant considers this debate to be “beside the point”
(Cl. Reply, para. 67) in the case at hand, since contractual obligations such as the GSE
conventions are without a doubt covered by the umbrella clause. Against this
background, the Tribunal will focus its analysis on the Parties’ arguments as to whether
the GSE conventions are covered by the ECT’s umbrella clause (i) and address this
clause’s relevance with respect to Legislative Decree No. 387/2003, the Romani
Decree, the Second, Third, Fourth and Fifth Energy Accounts, as well as the GSE tariff

recognition letters subsequently (ii).

(i) GSE conventions

First, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant’s contention that the terms of the ECT’s
umbrella clause do not only cover obligations entered into with an investor, but also
with an investment, and that the GSE conventions which were concluded between the
GSE, on the one hand, and the Claimant’s local subsidiaries, on the other (see

paras. 109, 120), fall under Article 10(1), last sentence, of the ECT in this respect.

Secondly, the Tribunal is not convinced by the Respondent’s submission (see para. 345)

that the use of the words “entered into” in the ECT’s umbrella clause implies that

102

370.

371.

372.

373.

negotiations must have taken place between the parties to the obligation. The Claimant
(see para. 327) is correct to argue that it is common for parties to enter into binding

obligations both with or without previous negotiations.

Thirdly, the Tribunal further accepts the Claimant’s position (see para. 328), which has
remained unchallenged by the Respondent, that under the rules of State responsibility,
the conduct of the GSE, which acts as an organ of the Italian State, in particular when

concluding the GSE conventions, is attributable to the Respondent.

Fourthly, the Tribunal considers that, while it is disputed between the Parties whether,
and to what extent, Italian law is relevant to determining the existence of an obligation

under the umbrella clause, !°!

the GSE conventions can be governed by no legal order
but the Italian one. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant (Cl. Reply, paras. 40, 49-56)
that this does not imply that the latter must prove a breach of contract under Italian law
in order to succeed under the umbrella clause claim. Making this concession to the
Claimant, however, does not prevent the Tribunal from accepting in principle that the

GSE conventions are governed by Italian law.

Against this background, the Tribunal observes that also Legislative Decree
No. 387/2003, the Romani Decree, as well as the Second, Third, Fourth and Fifth
Energy Accounts (see paras. 116 et seq.), which constitute the legislative and regulatory
basis for the renewable energy incentive scheme, form part of Italian law as the lex
contractus. This is relevant in the light of the Respondent’s submission that the GSE
conventions are not standard commercial contracts governed by private law, as argued
by the Claimant (see para. 332), but “accessory contracts” governed by administrative
law (see para. 346). Accordingly, also the aforementioned legislative and regulatory
provisions are to be taken into account by the Tribunal in order to properly examine the

legal nature of the GSE conventions in light of the ECT’s umbrella clause.

The Tribunal notes in this regard that there exist so-called contratti accessori or
contratti accessivi, i.e. “accessory” or “ancillary” contracts, in Italian (administrative)
law which have certain characteristics distinguishing them from regular private law

contracts. Here, the Tribunal accepts the evidence from the Respondent’s legal expert,

Professor Rojas, that “the agreements between the Claimant’s SPVs and the GSE are

not mere ‘private law contracts’ but have an ‘accessory nature””.!©?

374. The Tribunal also takes into consideration in this context that the Italian Constitutional
Court has ruled that the GSE conventions are “accessory to the provisions granting the
incentives”, and were not “private law contracts”.'®? Furthermore, according to the
same decision, “the agreements reached with the GSE cannot be qualified as contracts
meant to determine the exclusive profit of the operator [...]. They are instead regulatory
instruments [...]”.!° These findings were endorsed subsequently by the Italian Court

of Cassation.'®

375. The Tribunal is aware of the fact that, as an arbitral body operating under international
law, it is not legally bound by the aforementioned decisions and must independently
adjudicate the dispute before it, since “[t]he purpose of investment arbitration is neutral
adjudication of a dispute by a tribunal independent from both parties”, as aptly
described by the Burlington v. Ecuador tribunal.'° The same tribunal declared,
however, that international tribunal should certainly consider decisions rendered by
national courts.'®’ Having this in mind, the Tribunal accepts the relevance of the Italian
Constitutional Court’s findings for its own assessment of the nature of the GSE

conventions in light of the ECT’s umbrella clause.

376. In particular, the Tribunal observes that, on the basis and within the limits of the
pertinent regulatory framework, the GSE submitted the GSE conventions for signature
by the renewable energy producer only at the end of a process that included several
previous steps (namely the energy accounts themselves as well as the GSE tariff
recognition letters, which are both unilateral in character) and at a moment in time when

the core elements of the incentivization scheme for the individual PV plant (notably the

identity of the parties, the duration, the beginning and the amount of incentive payments
as well as the payment modalities) had already been fixed. In fact, the GSE conventions
only reflect a legal relationship whose existence and essential features have been

determined before.

Accordingly, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent’s position that the latter did not
undertake any autonomous commitments by having the GSE sign the GSE conventions
compared to the obligations the Respondent had already undertaken by virtue of
adopting the relevant general regulatory measures since these conventions do nothing
more than implement the general measures. In that sense, the GSE conventions are
indeed mere “accessories” to the pertinent regulatory framework, as notably embodied
in the unilateral energy accounts and the equally unilateral issuing of the tariff
recognition letters by the GSE, and do not create commitments beyond the

administrative acts they are sourced in.

The Claimant (Cl. Reply, para. 77) is correct to refer the Tribunal to the Romani Decree
according to which “incentives shall be allocated through private-law contracts between
the GSE and the entity responsible for the system, based on a standard contract defined
by the [AEEG] [...]”.'!®* However, the question of whether or not the GSE conventions
are private law contracts under Italian law or not and the corresponding question of the
correct interpretation of the afore-cited provision within the Italian legal order are not
issues for this Tribunal to decide. Precisely as they concern matters of Italian law, the
Tribunal defers in this regard to the qualification made by the Italian Constitutional
Court (see para. 374), which also took the aforementioned provision of the Romani
Decree into account in its decision and still characterized the GSE conventions not to

be mere private law contracts.!©?

The characterization of the GSE conventions as accessory in nature and thus not
creating commitments beyond the administrative acts in which they have their source,

is not only relevant at the level of Italian law, the interpretation of which is not within

168 Article 24(2)(d) of the Romani Decree (CL-080), which reads in the original version, as follows: “gli incentive
sono assegnati tramite contratti di diritto private fra il GSE e il soggetto responsabile dell’impianto, sulla base
di un contratto-tipo definite dall 'Autorita per l’energia elettrica e il gas [...]”.

169 See Italian Constitutional Court, Decision No. 16/2017 of 7 December 2016, G.U. of 24 January 2017, nr. 8.2,

the Tribunal’s purview, but also for the purposes of the ECT’s umbrella clause. In the
Tribunal’s view, an obligation can only be deemed to have been “entered into” in the
meaning of Article10(1), last sentence of the ECT if it embodies a relevant measure of
autonomy and self-standing vis-a-vis general legislative and regulatory acts preceding
and predetermining it. If such predetermination encompasses all its essential elements,
thus reducing it to an act of essentially declaratory character, the necessary degree of
autonomy and self-standing will not be reached and an obligation in the meaning of the

umbrella clause cannot be considered to have been “entered into”.

While it has remained disputed between the Parties (Cl. Reply PHB, para. 9;
Resp. PHB, paras. 51-53; Resp. Reply PHB, para. 51) whether the content of the GSE
conventions was completely, or virtually completely, predetermined by the relevant
legislative and regulatory acts, there can be no doubt on the basis of the evidence before
the Tribunal that the degree of predetermination of the GSE conventions was
overwhelming and certainly included all essential elements of the obligation (see
para. 376). Accordingly, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the GSE conventions
lack the necessary autonomy vis-a-vis the legislative and regulatory framework and do
therefore not give rise to obligations entered into in the meaning of the ECT’s umbrella

clause.

That fact that these acts are denominated as “‘convenzione” (see para. 120), translating
as “conventions”, “agreements” or even “contracts”, does not change this result, as the
denomination of an act can only provide an indication, but does not constitute the

decisive factor in the Tribunal’s assessment.

In a similar vein, the Claimant’s contention (Tr. 23 September 2019, 33:2-3 [Legum];
Cl. PHB, para. 26) that there is “no carve-out for obligations contemplated by
legislation” in the ECT’s umbrella clause, does not lead to a different conclusion. The
crucial point in applying the ECT’s umbrella clause is not whether a contract or
convention is mentioned, provided for or, whatever the exact meaning of the concept
may be, “contemplated” by legislation, since contracts and notably contracts concluded
by the government are typically concluded on the basis, and within the framework and
limits, of legislative provisions. What makes the case of the GSE conventions different
from the standard relationship between legislative basis and contract based upon it is,

as demonstrated before, that the pertinent legislative and regulatory acts predetermine

106

383.

384.

the conventions concluded by the GSE in all their essential elements, leaving no space
for an autonomous legal obligation arising from the GSE conventions as such (Tr. 25

September 2019, 108:21-25 [Rojas]).

The Tribunal’s conclusion is also in line with the thrust of the existing arbitral decisions
on the matter. So far, the Greentech v. Italy and the ESPF Beteiligungs GmbH et al. v.
Italy awards have been the only instances where it has been accepted that the ECT’s
umbrella clause would operate under these circumstances.!” The Greentech majority’s
relatively brief examination of the accessory contracts argument which had also been
raised in that case, resulted in the finding that “taken as a whole, the Conto Energia
decrees, the GSE letters, and the GSE Agreements, amounted to obligations ‘entered
into with’ specific PV operators”.'7! The present Tribunal considers, however, that for
the purposes of identifying whether an “obligation” has been “entered into” for the
purposes of the ECT’s umbrella clause, it is not appropriate to assess the combined
legal effects of various legal acts of very different legal character. The decisive role
attributed by the majority in Greentech v. Italy (and for that matter by the majority in
ESPF Beteiligungs GmbH et al. v. Italy'”) to the energy accounts and the GSE tariff
recognition letters rather testifies, in this Tribunal’s opinion, to the non-autonomous
character of the GSE conventions, thus militating against qualifying them as
obligations entered into by the Respondent for the purposes of the ECT’s umbrella

clause.

Ina similar vein, the CEF v. Italy tribunal unanimously did not accept that the claimant
in that case could rely on the ECT’s umbrella clause with respect to the GSE
conventions, notably by referring to their character as “municipal matters, subject to
Italian law”.'”> Moreover, the investor’s umbrella clause argument regarding the GSE
conventions was rejected in the equally unanimously adopted Belenergia v. Italy award,

finding that “[t]he Italian legal and regulatory framework before the Spalma Incentivi

Decree and the Destinazione Italia Decree was clearly addressed to national and foreign
investors and thus could not be interpreted as creating obligations specifically ‘entered
into with’ Belenergia”.'* These ranks have been joined recently in the equally
unanimously adopted SunReserve et al. v. Italy award,'” which, amongst other things,
extensively dealt with the parties’ arguments on the accessory character or not of the
GSE conventions!” and concluded that neither the GSE tariff recognition letters nor
the GSE conventions could create “obligations” that would fall within the meaning of

that term in the ECT’s umbrella clause.!7”

Thus, in the Tribunal’s view, the GSE conventions, as accessory contracts, do not fall
within the ambit of the ECT’s umbrella clause as an obligation “entered into” with the
Claimant’s investments. In the light of this conclusion and the ensuing non-applicability
of Article 10(1), last sentence, of the ECT in the present case, there is no need for the
Tribunal to further analyze the Parties’ submissions on whether the unilateral
modification of the content of the GSE conventions by the Spalma-incentivi Decree

resulted in a breach of these conventions.

(ii) Legislative Decree No. 387/2003, the Romani Decree, the Second,

Third, Fourth and Fifth Energy Accounts and the GSE tariff

recognition letters
This brings the Tribunal back to the Claimant’s initial contention, i.e. its reference to
the possibility that legislative or regulatory acts as such also might give rise to
obligations in the meaning of the ECT’s umbrella clause (see para. 333) and its
acknowledgement that there is an ongoing debate on this issue, with a range of positions
taken by various arbitral tribunals (see para. 367). The present Tribunal sees no need to
enter into this debate for the purposes of the case before it, since the Claimant, in the
Tribunal’s view, cannot in any event derive the desired legal conclusions from
Legislative Decree No. 387/2003, the Romani Decree, the Second, Third, Fourth and
Fifth Energy Accounts or the pertinent GSE tariff recognition letters as the relevant

legislative and regulatory acts in the case at hand.

While the Tribunal cautions against equalizing the thresholds for “entering into
obligations” for the purposes of the ECT’s umbrella clause on the basis of legislative
and regulatory acts, on the one hand, and for “specific commitments” in such legislative
and regulatory acts giving rise to legitimate expectations (to be analyzed below; see
paras. 403 et seq.), on the other, the Tribunal will assume for the sake of argument that
these thresholds are identical, i.e. that the Claimant could rely on the content of the
specific commitments made by the Respondent in the present case also in terms of
obligations “entered into” by the Respondent under the ECT’s umbrella clause.
However, even under this assumption, the content of this obligation would only be that
the legal framework for the incentivization of PV energy would remain intact over 20
years, i.e. that it would not be subject to fundamental or radical changes (see para. 437).
Since, under the circumstances of the present case, there is no added value for the
Claimant in relying on the ECT’s umbrella clause with regard to the pertinent legislative

and regulatory acts, the Tribunal sees no need to further delve into this question.

(iii) Conclusion

For these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the GSE conventions, as accessory
contracts, do not fall within the ambit of the ECT’s umbrella clause as obligations
“entered into” with the Claimant’s investments. The Tribunal further finds that, for the
purposes of the present case, there is no need to further delve into the question of
whether Legislative Decree No. 387/2003, the Romani Decree, the Second, Third,
Fourth and Fifth Energy Accounts or the GSE tariff recognition letters create
obligations entered into by the Respondent for the purposes of Article 10(1), last

sentence, of the ECT.

b. Fair and equitable treatment

Art. 10(1) of the ECT provides in relevant part:

Each contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this
Treaty, encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent
conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments in
its Area. Such conditions shall include a commitment to accord at all times
to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable
treatment.

The Parties agree that this provision involves the general obligation of a State to grant

foreign investors fair and equitable treatment which notably includes the protection of

109

391.

392.

393.

the legitimate expectations of these investors (Cl. Memorial, para. 296; Cl. Reply,
para. 93; Cl. PHB, para. 48; Resp. Counter-Memorial, paras. 443, 446; Resp. Rejoinder,
para. 453). The Parties are further in agreement on the fact that Article 10(1) of the ECT
contains no definition of fair and equitable treatment (Cl. Reply, para. 93;

Resp. Counter-Memorial, para. 444).

The positions of the Parties, however, only partly overlap regarding the actual meaning
to be given to the fair and equitable treatment standard under the ECT, notably
regarding the balance to be struck between the State’s sovereign prerogatives and the
investor’s legitimate expectations. Against this background, the Tribunal will first
determine the applicable legal standard (see paras. 392 et seq.) and then analyze the
various aspects of the Claimant’s fair and equitable treatment claim and the

Respondent’s objections to it in view of the facts of the case (see paras. 423 et seq.).

(i) Applicable legal standard

To start with, there can be no doubt that the exercise of interpretation of Article 10(1),
first and second sentences, of the ECT, that the Tribunal will undertake in the following,
must be guided by the customary rules of treaty interpretation as reflected in Articles
31 to 33 of the VCLT.'”* This is not only confirmed by the Parties in the present case,
either explicitly (Cl. Memorial, para. 276) or at least implicitly (Resp. Counter-
Memorial, paras. 444 et seq.), but also wholly accepted in the pertinent caselaw.'”?
Hence, according to the general rule of interpretation codified in Article 31(1) VCLT,
“Ta] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning
to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and

purpose”.

In the context of interpretation of Article 10(1), first and second sentences, of the ECT,
the Tribunal notes that the Parties’ views differ as to whether these provisions include
two distinct standards of protection (“stable, equitable, favourable and transparent
conditions”, “fair and equitable treatment”) or one combined standard of treatment. As

regards the former position, the Claimant (Cl. Memorial, para. 273) has notably referred

"79 See, for instance, Orascom TMT Investments S.d.r.l. v. People’s Democratic Republic of Algeria, CSID Case
No. ARB/12/35, Award, 31 May 2017, paras. 271 et seq. (CL-059); see recently SunReserve Luxco Holdings
S.a.rl. (Luxembourg) et al. v. Italian Republic, SCC Case No. 2016/32, Final Award, 25 March 2020, paras. 676
et seq. (RL-050).

110

the Tribunal to the observation of the Plama v. Bulgaria tribunal that the standards of
protection in Article 10(1) of the ECT “though related, are separate and
autonomous”.'®° At the same time, the Claimant, again referring to the Plama v.
Bulgaria award!®! as well as to other arbitral decisions,'*” takes the view that the host
State’s guaranteeing of stability and transparency of the legal framework is, together
with the protection of the investor’s legitimate expectations, the second key element of
the fair and equitable treatment standard (Cl. Memorial, paras. 289-291; Cl. Reply,
para. 96). This also seems to be the view held by the Respondent (Resp. Counter-
Memorial, para. 454 et seq.; Resp. Rejoinder, paras. 455 et seq.). In any event, the
present Tribunal agrees with the ESPF Beteiligungs GmbH et al. v. Italy tribunal that
eventually little turns on the question of whether to accept the existence of one
integrated standard of protection including multiple sub-standards or to split Article

10(1) of the ECT up into several (relatively) autonomous protection standards.!*?

394. Against this background, the Tribunal will focus its analysis on the fair and equitable
treatment standard, as enshrined in Article 10(1), second sentence, of the ECT.
However, it will come back to this question and examine whether Article 10(1), first
sentence, in view of the facts and submissions in the present case, offers the Claimant

any additional protection (see para. 475).

395. The Tribunal observes in this regard that the terms of the ECT, as accepted by the
Parties (see para. 390), contain no further clarification as to what the obligation “to

accord at all times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and

framework has been identified as “an emerging standard of fair and equitable treatment in international law”.

equitable treatment” means, let alone a legal definition of the term “fair and equitable

treatment”.

Applying the aforementioned regime of treaty interpretation to Article 10(1), second
sentence, of the ECT, the ordinary meaning of the term “fair and equitable treatment”
contains a clear indication that the host State is not free to act vis-a-vis investors
protected under the ECT ad libitum or to interfere with their rights and assets at its
whim. At the same time, the general nature of the words “fair” and “equitable” suggests
that the protection of the investors’ position is not absolute and unqualified, but rather

a matter of degree and balancing.

As concerns the ECT’s object and purpose, the Tribunal notes that Article 2 ECT
(“Purpose of the Treaty”) stipulates: “This Treaty establishes a legal framework in order
to promote long-term cooperation in the energy field, based on complementarities and
mutual benefit, in accordance with the objectives and principles of the Charter”. This
makes clear that the ECT aims at creating a legal framework in the energy field which
is characterized by two interrelated features, i.e. taking account of the long-term
relationships that are characteristic of this field and emphasizing that such long-term
relationships can only realize their potential and effectively promote the goals of the
ECT if they are conducted in a spirit of cooperation, mutual respect and a fair

distribution of benefits and risks between investors and host States.

In view of the express reference of Article 2 of the ECT to the European Energy
Charter, '* the Tribunal also considers this document, notably its preamble and its “Title
1: Objectives”, reproduced in part below, to be relevant to enlighten the ECT’s object

and purpose.

Preamble

[...] Recognising State sovereignty and sovereign rights over energy
resources; [...]

Recognising the role of entrepreneurs, operating within a transparent and
equitable legal framework, in promoting co-operation under the Charter;

'S See Article I(1) of the ECT (CL-001): “Charter? means the European Energy Charter adopted in the
Concluding Document of the Hague Conference on the European Energy Charter signed at The Hague on 17
December 1991; signature of the Concluding Document is considered to be signature of the Charter”,

112

399.

400.

Determined to establish closer, mutually beneficial commercial relations
and promote energy investments; [...]

Title I: Objectives

The signatories are desirous of improving security of energy supply and of
maximising the efficiency of production, conversion, transport, distribution
and use of energy, to enhance safety and to minimise environmental
problems, on an acceptable economic basis.

Within the framework of State sovereignty and sovereign rights over energy
resources and in a spirit of political and economic co-operation, they
undertake to promote the development of an efficient energy market
throughout Europe, and a better functioning global market, in both cases
based on the principle of non-discrimination and on market-oriented price
formation, taking due account of environmental concerns. They are
determined to create a climate favourable to the operation of enterprises and
to the flow of investments and technologies by implementing market
principles in the field of energy.

To this end, and in accordance with these principles, they will take action in
the following fields: [...]

formulation of stable and transparent legal frameworks creating conditions

for the development of energy resources; [...].!°5
The extracts quoted from the European Energy Charter underscore, and specify, the two
features identified before. As regards the perspective of the host State, a functioning
long-term cooperation in the energy (as in any other) field requires respect for its
particular role and responsibilities under international law, as embodied in the concept
of sovereignty. At the same time, as concerns the investors’ side, their investment can
only be economically viable and flourish in the long run if States create and maintain a
climate favorable to the operation of enterprises and to the flow of investments. In the
long-term perspective, this particularly means that investors can operate within a

transparent, stable and equitable legal framework.

When looking, thirdly, at the context of Article 10(1), second sentence, of the ECT, the
Tribunal notes that the immediately preceding sentence, already referred to above (see
para. 393), lays down the host State’s obligation to “encourage and create stable,

equitable, favourable and transparent conditions” for investors. This is fully consistent

'85 Preamble and Article | of the European Energy Charter (CL-001).

113

401.

402.

with the aforementioned need to create and maintain a climate favorable to the

operation of enterprises and the flow of investments.

The Tribunal observes in this context that the Respondent has argued that, in order to
correctly understand Article 10(1) of the ECT, it must be read consistently with
customary international law on the matter, “in accordance with the hermeneutical
principle that requires international treaties to be interpreted, if possible, in a manner
consistent with general international law” (Resp. Counter-Memorial, para. 444). Apart
from the fact that the Tribunal does not consider that such a principle of interpretation
“in accordance with customary international law” exists in international law or can, in
this generality, be inferred from the interpretation regime of Articles 31 to 33 VCLT,
Article 10(1) of the ECT is, in the Tribunal’s view, a paradigmatic example of where
such interpretation cannot be applied. The special features of the ECT, as analyzed
above, make it evident in the Tribunal’s view that the ECT’s fair and equitable
treatment standard differs from, and goes beyond, the minimum standard of protection

under customary international law and must therefore be determined autonomously.'*°

This does not answer the question of, however, what legal standard should positively
apply in view of the ECT’s guarantee of fair and equitable treatment. The Tribunal takes
note in this respect of the Parties’ agreement that “specific commitments” by a State
may give rise to legitimate expectations of investors protected under the fair and
equitable treatment standard (Cl. Reply, para. 98; Resp. Rejoinder, para. 462).
Furthermore, both Parties accept the proposition that, even in the absence of specific
commitments, the fair and equitable treatment standard protects foreign investors from
fundamental or radical modifications to the legal framework in which their investment
was made (CI. Reply, para. 95; Resp. Counter-Memorial, para. 467). At the same time,
there is significant disagreement between the Parties as to how these principles operate

in more detail. The Tribunal will analyze them in turn.

'86 See in a similar vein, SunReserve Luxco Holdings S.d.r.. (Luxembourg) et al. v. Italian Republic, SCC Case
No. 2016/32, Final Award, 25 March 2020, paras. 671 et seq. (RL-050).

114

aa) Specific commitments

403. While the Parties accept the proposition that specific commitments by a State may give
rise to protected legitimate expectations (see para. 402), they disagree as to what

constitutes such specific commitment.

404. On the one hand, the Claimant argues that legitimate expectations can arise from
explicit or implicit representations on the part of the host State (Cl. Memorial,
para. 301), including specific commitments made by the host State through legislation
or contracts (Cl. Reply, para. 107). To this effect, the Claimant (Cl. Reply, para. 98)
refers to various arbitral decisions, notably the Blusun v. Italy'*’ and the Mobil
Exploration v. Argentina awards.'** Furthermore, the Claimant (Cl. PHB, para. 51)
relies on the 9Ren v. Spain award,'*? which affirmatively cited the proposition in the
UNCTAD 2012 Report on Fair and Equitable Treatment!” that “an investor may derive
legitimate expectations [...] from [...] rules that are not specifically addressed to a
particular investor but which are put in place with a specific aim to induce foreign

investments and on which the foreign investor relied in making his investment”.'?!

405. The Respondent, on the other hand, while accepting that legitimate expectations of the
investor may originate from a specific commitment of the host state explicitly directed
at a foreign investor (Resp. Rejoinder, para. 463), relies on the Parkerings-Compagniet
v. Lithuania award'*? and requires that such specific commitment to come into
existence, it be laid down in an “agreement”. According to the Respondent (Resp.
Rejoinder, para. 467), for such agreement the following three conditions must be met:

and (iii) it is typically adopted before the starting of the foreign investment. In
particular, the Respondent (Resp. Counter-Memorial, paras. 453, 463) insists that
legitimate expectations cannot arise from the general legislative framework or
regulatory measures (such as an administrative decree) existing in a State at the time of
the investment and refers to the Blusun v. Italy! and Charanne v. Spain'** awards in

this respect.

The Masdar v. Spain tribunal'®> is often cited for its dictum that in order to determine
which kind of specific commitments can give rise to legitimate expectations, two
schools of thought exist. “In essence, one school of thought considers that such
commitments can result from general statements in general laws or regulations. The
other considers that any such commitments have to be specific”.!°° While the
Respondent seems to endorse the second school of thought and to distance itself from
the first one, the Tribunal considers the distinction between them to be artificial. The
Tribunal agrees with the Novenergia II v. Spain tribunal, according to which “[t]he
relevant question is rather whether the statement or conduct objectively suffices to
create legitimate expectations in the recipient”.'®’ Put differently, “[t]he decisive issue
is not whether a state’s undertaking is ‘specific’ or ‘general’, or statutory or contractual,
but whether the statements and actions of the state provide a sufficiently clear
commitment to give rise under international law to legitimate expectations or legal

rights on the part of the investor”. !°

Thus, the Tribunal is not convinced by the three prerequisites for a specific commitment
to come into existence, as identified by the Respondent (see para. 405), at least if they
are considered (as is obviously done by the Respondent) to apply cumulatively and

categorically. In particular, the Tribunal does not derive from the existing arbitral

jurisprudence on the matter that, in order for a specific commitment to create legitimate
expectations, it is indispensable that there exists an individual agreement between the
host State and a specific investor. The Mobil Exploration v. Argentina tribunal, for
instance, has found that “two types of commitments might be considered ‘specific’;

those specific as to their addressee and those specific regarding their object and

> 199

purpose’ thus construing conditions (i) and (ii) as an alternative, with the possibility

of the absence of the one to be compensated by the presence of the other.

408. The present Tribunal agrees with this approach?” and is therefore of the view that a
State may make specific commitments to investors also by virtue of legislative or
regulatory acts which are not addressed to particular individuals, provided that these
acts are sufficiently specific regarding their content and their object and purpose.””! In
this context, the Tribunal considers the creation of legitimate expectations more likely

where a State has adopted legislative or regulatory acts “with a specific aim to induce

[...] investments”.20?

409. The assessment of whether such acts are actually capable of giving rise to protected
legitimate expectations on the part of the investor is a factual question that must be
made in view of the circumstances of the case, involving the evaluation whether these
circumstances objectively justify such conclusion. The Tribunal will undertake this

exercise subsequently (see paras. 424 et seq.), after having clarified the standard of

will not be modified in due course. However, a reiteration of the same type of commitment in different types of
general statements could, considering the circumstances, amount to a specific behavior of the State, the object and
purpose of which is to give the investor a guarantee on which it can justifiably rely”.

protection applying in case of fundamental or radical modifications to the legal

framework.
bb) Protection against fundamental or radical modifications

As stated above (see para. 402), both Parties accept the proposition that, even in the
absence of specific commitments, the fair and equitable treatment standard protects
foreign investors from fundamental or radical modifications to the legal framework in
which they made their investment. While the Claimant submits that the Spalma-
incentivi Decree fundamentally altered the incentive regime for PV plants in a sudden
and unpredictable manner (see para. 339), the Respondent argues that the modifications
of the tariff regime brought about by the Spalma-incentivi Decree were reasonable and
proportionate (see para. 342). The Parties’ disagreement is partly due to their different
positions on the factual side of the case, which the Tribunal will address subsequently
(see paras. 438 et seq.). However, the Parties also hold different views as to how the
relevant legal standard, i.e. protection against fundamental or radical modifications of
the existing legal framework, is to be construed; this legal standard must first be

determined by the Tribunal before applying it to the facts.

In order to draw the proper line between acceptable adaptations and non-acceptable
alterations of the legal framework, in the Tribunal’s view, the ECT requires that a
balance be struck between two principles which are both recognized by this treaty and
which are both indispensable in reaching its overarching objective to promote long-
term cooperation in the energy field (see para. 397): on the one hand, the interest of
investors in a stable and transparent legal framework as well as in respect for their
legitimate expectations (as also accepted by the Respondent; Resp. Counter-Memorial,
paras. 446, 467), and on the other, the host State’s sovereignty, notably including the
ability to adapt its legislative and regulatory framework to new developments, which
are unavoidable in a long-term cooperation (as also acknowledged by the Claimant;

Cl. Reply, para. 96).

The tension between these principles and the need to find a proper balance between
them have been recognized by numerous arbitral tribunals, also referred to by the
Parties. For instance, the Novenergia II v. Spain tribunal recognized that a tribunal must

undertake in this context “a balancing exercise, where the state’s regulatory interests

118

413.

414.

203

are weighed against the investors’ legitimate expectations and reliance”.?* In a similar
vein, the Foresight v. Spain tribunal found that, “[iJn the absence of a specific
commitment to the investor by the host State, the investor cannot expect the legal or
regulatory framework to be frozen. In such circumstances, a host State has space to
reasonably modify the legal or regulatory framework without breaching an investor’s

legitimate expectations of stability”.?** Moreover, the Saluka tribunal found:

No investor may reasonably expect that the circumstances prevailing at the
time the investment is made remain totally unchanged. In order to determine
whether frustration of the foreign investor’s expectations was justified and
reasonable, the host State’s legitimate right subsequently to regulate
domestic matters in the public interest must be taken into consideration as
well.2°5
Furthermore, the Tribunal finds it useful to refer to the recent SunReserve v. Italy award,
which observed that “stability and transparency in the legal framework are important
ingredients of the host State’s [fair and equitable treatment] obligation”? and that “the
objectives of creating a stable, transparent and favourable legal framework for

investments are required to be balanced against the host State’s right to regulate”.?°”

The present Tribunal endorses this view and, in assessing the claims regarding the
alleged violation by the Spalma-incentivi Decree of the fair and equitable treatment
guarantee of the ECT, is therefore required to conduct a balancing exercise between,
on the one hand, the Claimant’s legitimate interest, protected by the ECT, in the stability
and transparency of the legal framework created by the host State, and, on the other,
the equally protected right of the Respondent to adapt this legal framework to relevant
developments over time. Against this background, the Tribunal agrees with the
Claimant that Article 10(1) ECT “intended to provide real and effective protection for
investment” (Cl. Memorial, para. 286) because otherwise the protection of the

investor’s legitimate expectations would become moot. At the same time, this cannot

mean that the fair and equitable treatment standard would require the host State to freeze
its legal framework, as emphasized by the Respondent (Resp. Counter-Memorial,
paras. 454-456, 466; Resp. Rejoinder, paras. 455, 458-459) and also accepted by the
Claimant (Cl. Memorial, para. 292; Cl. Reply, para. 94; Cl. PHB, para. 49). Otherwise,
the host State’s sovereignty and its ensuing “right to regulate” would lose any practical

effect.

415. It is well established in arbitral practice that, under its obligation to accord fair and
equitable treatment, the host State is not required “to freeze its legal framework, but
rather to act in an open manner and consistent with commitments it has undertaken”,?°
that “[n]o investor may reasonably expect that the circumstances prevailing at the time
the investment is made remain totally unchanged”? and that “the requirement of
fairness must not be understood as the immutability of the legal framework, but as
implying that subsequent changes should be made fairly, consistently, predictably,
taking into account the circumstances of the investment”.?!°

416. Hence, “[t]he legitimate expectations of foreign investors cannot be that the State will
never modify the legal framework, especially in times of crisis, but certainly investors
must be protected from unreasonable modifications of that legal framework”.?!!
Similarly, the Eiser v. Spain tribunal stated that the “obligation under the ECT to afford
investors fair and equitable treatment does protect investors from a fundamental change
to the regulatory regime in a manner that does not take account of the circumstances of
existing investments made in reliance on the prior regime”,*!* thus requiring the host
State “to provide fundamental stability in the essential characteristics of the legal
regime relied upon by investors in making long-term investments. [...] [T]he Article
10(1) obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment means that regulatory regimes

cannot be radically altered as applied to existing investments in ways that deprive

investors who invested in reliance on those regimes of their investment’s value”.?!> The
Novenergia IT v. Spain tribunal found that the fair and equitable treatment standard
“protect[s] investors from a radical or fundamental change to legislation”.”'+ Moreover,
the Foresight tribunal “agree[d] with the Eiser v. Spain and Novenergia v. Spain
tribunals that the [fair and equitable treatment] standard in the ECT protects investors
from radical or fundamental change in the legal or regulatory framework under which
the investments are made”.?!> In a similar vein, the Plama v. Bulgaria tribunal found
that “the ECT does not protect investors against any and all changes in the host

country’s laws”.?!¢

It has therefore become manifest, and is also accepted by the Parties in the present case,
that, especially in a long-term relationship, a circumspect investor must be prepared for
modifications in the legal framework applicable to it. The Parties are even in agreement
on the proposition that the threshold of violation of legitimate expectations, and thus of
the fair and equitable treatment standard, is reached if the change is radical or
fundamental in character. According to the Claimant, the Respondent “has an
obligation under the ECT to protect investors from fundamental changes to the
regulatory regime that fail to take into account the circumstances in which the
investments were made” (Cl. Reply, para. 95). The Respondent accepts that “while the
legal category of legitimate expectations does not equate to a stabilization clause, not
any regulatory modification made by the host State would be legitimate as such when
colliding with investor expectations. However, this would be limited to when the State
acted either unfairly, unreasonably or inequitably in the exercise of its legislative

power” (Resp. Counter-Memorial, para. 467).

That the stability interest of the investor is only one factor to be taken into account in
the balancing exercise which investment arbitration tribunals have to undertake and that

fundamental or radical modifications, reach the threshold of Article 10(1) of the ECT

has been aptly expressed by the Antaris v. Czech Republic tribunal:

(8) The requirements of legitimate expectations and legal stability as
manifestations of the FET standard do not affect the State’s rights to
exercise its sovereign authority to legislate and to adapt its legal system to
changing circumstances.

(9) The host State is not required to elevate the interests of the investor above
all other considerations, and the application of the FET standard allows for
a balancing or weighing exercise by the State and the determination of a
breach of the FET standard must be made in the light of the high measure
of deference which international law generally extends to the right of
national authorities to regulate matters within their own borders.?!”

419. There is even, to a certain degree at least, common ground between the Parties as
regards the relevant factors in assessing whether a fundamental or radical change has
occurred. While those factors are interrelated and partly overlapping, the pertinent
submissions of the Parties (see paras. 338-339, 342, 351, 358-361) can be classified in
three groups, namely as to whether or not the modifications brought about by the
Spalma-incentivi Decree (1) could draw on a public policy purpose, i.e. were
reasonable, (2) should have been expected by the Claimant, i.e. were foreseeable, and

(3) did not exceed what was necessary, i.e. were proportionate.

420. These criteria also resonate in the pertinent caselaw. For instance, the Electrabel v.

Hungary tribunal found:

While the investor is promised protection against unfair changes, it is well-
established that the host State is entitled to maintain a reasonable degree of
regulatory flexibility to respond to changing circumstances in the public
interest. Consequently, the requirement of fairness must not be understood
as the immutability of the legal framework, but as implying that subsequent
changes should be made fairly, consistently and predictably, taking into
account the circumstances of the investment.?!*

Furthermore, according to the Parkingers-Compagniet v. Lithuania tribunal,

there is nothing objectionable about the amendment brought to the
regulatory framework existing at the time an investor made its investment.
As a matter of fact, any businessman or investor knows that laws will evolve

over time. What is prohibited however is for a State to act unfairly,
unreasonably or inequitably in the exercise of its legislative power.”!°
Moreover, the Charanne v. Spain tribunal found that “an investor has a legitimate
expectation that, when modifying the existing regulation based on which the investment
was made, the State will not act unreasonably, disproportionately or contrary to the

public interest”.?7°

The Parties hold diverging views, however, concerning the relative weight of these
factors and, in particular, regarding their application to the facts of the present case. The
Tribunal notes in this regard that the assessment of whether a change in the legal
framework amounts to a fundamental or radical change or remains below this threshold
is neither a mathematical test nor a philosophical exercise that is made in the abstract,
but a judgment to be made by the Tribunal considering the specific circumstances of
the case before it. In a similar vein, the SunReserve v. Italy tribunal has observed that
“fairness and/or equitability are not absolute concepts that are capable of being reduced
to universally applicable definitions. Instead, what constitutes fair and/or equitable
treatment is a question to be determined by taking into account all circumstances of a

given case”.??!

Against this background, the Tribunal will discuss the Parties’ various arguments
subsequently and offer its own assessment of these arguments. In its analysis, the
Tribunal will proceed in three steps: First, the question is to be addressed whether the
conduct of the host State gave rise to any expectations, and if so, whether these
expectations were legitimate and reasonable in the circumstances of the case (ii).
Secondly, the Tribunal will examine whether the investors relied on these expectations
in making their investments in the host State (iii). Thirdly, it must be clarified whether

the host State frustrated these expectations by its subsequent conduct (iv).

(ii) Existence of legitimate expectations
Having clarified that the fair and equitable treatment standard under the ECT protects
foreign investors against violations, on the one hand, of their legitimate expectations
arising from specific commitments of the host State and, on the other, of their equally
protected expectation that the legal framework existing at the time of the investment
will not be fundamentally or radically altered, the Tribunal will now examine whether
under the circumstances of the present case the conduct of the Respondent gave rise to

any expectations enjoying protection under the ECT.
aa) Specific commitments

First, the Tribunal will address the question of whether, and to what extent, the
Respondent’s conduct brought into existence specific commitments, creating legitimate
expectations that these commitments would be respected. In the Tribunal’s view, when
applying the legal standard set out above (see para. 408) to the facts of the dispute, this
is the case with respect to Legislative Decree No. 387/2003 and the Romani Decree in
combination with the Second, Third, Fourth and Fifth Energy Accounts, which were
adopted under the direction, and on the basis, of these legislative decrees (see paras. 116

et seq.).

Pursuant to these legal acts, PV plants fulfilling the necessary conditions during a
specific window of time would receive a constant”? FIT for a period of twenty years
from the entry into operation of the respective PV plant. The Tribunal thus agrees with
the Claimant’s statement that “[e]Jach Energy Account sets out very precisely for each
category of plants (plants on buildings or other plants) the exact amount of the payable
feed-in tariff based on the plant’s capacity and date of entry into operation” (Cl. PHB,
para. 56). Accordingly, the terms of each of the energy accounts in combination with

the legislative decrees forming their legal basis were detailed and specific.

Moreover, the fact that the Italian FIT regime for PV plants was not an ephemeral effort,
but a more than decade-long endeavor (with Legislative Decree No. 387/2003 being
adopted in 2003 and the First Energy Account in 2005; see paras. 116, 122), and that it

was framed by, and embedded within, the EU’s incentivization strategy for renewable

124

427.

428.

energies (see paras. 113-115), thus successively building one energy account upon the

£223

other, all containing the same type of commitment presents itself to the Tribunal, in

the terms used by the E/ Paso Energy v. Argentina tribunal, as “a reiteration of the same

2 224

type of commitment in different types of general statements’ justifying qualifying it

as “a specific behaviour of the State, the object and purpose of which is to give the

investor a guarantee on which it can justifiably rely”.??>

At the same time, the Tribunal considers that the fact that this commitment was
subsequently confirmed, and individualized, for every single of the Claimant’s PV
plants in GSE tariff recognition letters and GSE conventions (Cl. Reply, paras. 114-
115) does not add to the specificity of the commitment. Nor does, for the same reason,
the non-existence of these letters and conventions at the time of investment detract from
the qualification of the aforementioned legislative decrees and energy accounts as a
clear, specific and repeated commitment on the part of the Respondent. The Tribunal
finds it plausible that the Claimant, like many other investors, understood, at the time
when it took the investment decision, that it would obtain at a later moment in time a
convention from the GSE, provided it could deliver the PV plants in line with the
specifications provided in the energy accounts (Tr. 24 September 2019, 14:1-4 [Hunt]).
Yet, this very understanding did not have its basis in the GSE tariff recognition letters
or the GSE conventions as such which, as conceded by the Claimant itself (Cl. Reply,
para. 115), were only issued after the investment had been made, but rather in the energy
accounts which directed the GSE to issue these letters and conventions if certain
conditions were fulfilled. In this regard, the GSE had to decide on issuing these letters
and conventions on the basis of the criteria laid down in the pertinent laws and

administrative decrees.”

Accordingly, as the GSE tariff recognition letters and GSE conventions were, by
definition, only issued after the entry into operation of the respective PV plant, i.e. a

considerable time after the Claimant’s investment decision, and as the Claimant could

only rely on commitments known to it at the time of the investment, in the present case
the GSE tariff recognition letters and the GSE conventions are irrelevant for the

assessment of the specificity of the commitments in question. This logic is confirmed

by the approach taken by the CEF v. Italy’ and the Belenergia v. Italy tribunals.?*

Hence, the Tribunal is not convinced by the position taken by the majority in the
Greentech v. Italy case which also considered the individual GSE letters and GSE

conventions to form the basis for specific assurances of Italy, giving rise to legitimate

expectations upon which the investors could rely.?”?

429. In addition, there can be no doubt that Legislative Decree No. 387/2003, the Romani
Decree and the Second, Third, Fourth and Fifth Energy Accounts were the result, and
manifestation, of Italy’s efforts at incentivizing renewable energy, notably solar energy.
As mentioned above (see para. 116), Legislative Decree No. 387/2003 contemplated

the adoption of subsequent decrees “by which the criteria for encouraging the

230

production of electricity from solar source are defined”,**° which led to the adoption of

the Second and the Third Energy Accounts. In a similar vein, the Romani Decree
establishes the “incentives and institutional, financial and legal framework necessary to
achieve the targets for 2020 on the overall share of energy from renewable sources in
transports”.”*! Furthermore, although the Respondent argues differently (see para. 354),
even the Respondent’s legal expert, Professor Rojas (Tr. 25 September 2019, 37:25-
38:4 [Rojas]), accepts that “[t]he purpose of providing incentive tariffs was of course
to incentivize investment in the photovoltaic sector, because, as we know, photovoltaic

energy was costly to produce, it was below market price; with no incentive, there would

have not been investment”. As explained before (see para. 408), the adoption of
legislative and regulatory acts with the specific aim to induce investment makes the
coming into existence of legitimate expectations more likely, and the Italian incentive

tariff regime undeniably did just that.

The incentivization efforts of the Respondent are further illustrated by a number of
statements from the GSE website as well as from policy statements”? to which the
Tribunal has been referred by the Claimant (Cl. Reply, para. 113). When analyzing the
content of these statements, however, the Tribunal considers them not sufficiently
specific to give rise to commitments in their own right. Accordingly, there is no reason
for the Tribunal to look further into the questions of who authored these statements and

at what time they were made.

Considering the aforementioned aspects, the Tribunal concludes that the pertinent
Italian legal framework on the incentivization of PV energy, including Legislative
Decree No. 387/2003, the Romani Decree, as well as the Second, Third, Fourth and
Fifth Energy Accounts, has indeed given rise to specific commitments of the
Respondent, thus creating legitimate expectations upon which the Claimant could rely.
Yet, nowhere in the pertinent legislative or regulatory framework did the Respondent
commit itself to leave this legal framework untouched for twenty years.”* All efforts

by the Claimant to argue the opposite cannot convince the Tribunal.

First, to start at the top of the pertinent legal framework, Article 7.2(d) of Legislative
Decree No. 387/2003,2*4 which sets out the criteria for the ministerial decrees to be
adopted subsequently, i.e. the energy accounts (see paras. 122 et seq.), states that “[f]or
the electricity produced by photovoltaic conversion of solar energy, the criteria provide
for a specific incentive tariff by decreasing amount and duration as to ensure a fair
remuneration of investment and operating costs”. In a similar vein, Article 24(2) of the

Romani Decree,”*> which replaced Article 7 of Legislative Decree No. 387/2003,

232 See GSE, The Energy Accounts (5" ed.), April 2010, 27 (C-019); GSE website, Fourth Feed-In Scheme —

No. ARB/16/5, Award, 14 September 2020, paras. 518 et seq., 642 (CL-313).

maintains the emphasis on a fair remuneration, specifying that the incentives should
take into consideration the average conventional useful life of plants in setting an
appropriate rate of compensation. Accordingly, the pertinent legislative acts create a
system which promises PV energy producers a fair return or remuneration for the useful

life of PV plants, without guaranteeing them a defined amount of compensation.

In addition, when Article 24(2)(c) of the Romani Decree further states that the
incentives should remain “constant throughout the period of entitlement and may take
account of the economic value of the energy produced”, there can be no doubt that, as
argued by the Respondent (Resp. Counter-Memorial, paras. 242, 255-256), the term
“constant” (“costante”’) does not mean “fixed”, but that the monetary value of the
incentives will be stable in the sense that it is not subject to updates with inflation

237

rates.”*° The same expression is also used in the energy accounts*” and was consistently

interpreted as meaning that there would be no indexing of the monetary incentives.?**

At the regulatory level, the criteria defined by the pertinent legislation were further
specified. In particular, the energy accounts set a duration for the incentive payments
of twenty years and a specific amount per kWh of energy produced which would be
constant in the aforementioned sense. It is true that the provision in Legislative Decree
No. 387/2003 stating that the decrees to be adopted should set a “specific rate with
decreasing amount”, was implemented in the energy accounts in the manner that a PV
plant, once admitted to the incentivization regime, would obtain a specific incentive
tariff and would keep it for the full duration of twenty years. A lower amount of
incentives would then be offered only in the following energy account for PV plants
newly admitted to the incentive tariff system. This approach was modified by the
Spalma-incentivi Decree (as well as, albeit on a voluntary basis, already half a year

earlier by the Destinazione Italia Decree; see paras. 137-138).

Yet, nowhere in the pertinent legislative acts or administrative decrees is there a

guarantee or promise that this approach would be maintained in all its aspects

236 See, however, for the opposite view ESPF Beteiligungs GmbH et al. v. Italian Republic, ICSID Case No.
ARB/16/5, Award, 14 September 2020, para. 526 (CL-313).

throughout the duration of the incentivization regime. In particular, the energy accounts
do not contain any mechanism that would prevent the relevant ministry (or the
legislator, adopting a provision of normative higher value) from intervening and
adapting the incentive tariff regime in certain ways, notably by reducing (or, for that
matter, increasing) the amount and/or the duration of incentive payments. Hence, in the
Tribunal’s view, the fact that the Respondent maintained a fixed incentive for already
existing PV plants through the adoption of the various energy accounts must not be
confounded with a legal guarantee of the Respondent to maintain the incentive tariff,
once awarded, in its full amount and duration, thus immunizing it against any following
modifications. This would require a stabilization or freezing clause which cannot be

found anywhere in the pertinent legislative or regulatory acts.

The Tribunal accepts the Claimant’s evidence that “[t]he certainty provided by the fixed
feed in tariffs for a 20-year period was a critical factor in justifying decisions to invest

in solar plants in Italy”?*?

and that, in making the decision whether to invest in Italy’s
renewable energy sector, it “relied on the entire legislative and contractual regime
offered by Italy to induce investment in renewable energy”~” (see also para. 336). Yet,
this merely proves that the Claimant intended to rely on the FIT being fixed for 20
years. As explained before (see para. 409), the Tribunal’s task of identifying relevant
legitimate expectations calls for an objective assessment as to whether the
circumstances, from the perspective of a circumspect and reasonable investor, justify
the conclusion that the Respondent has made specific commitments regarding the
stability of the incentivization system created by the pertinent legislative acts and

energy accounts.

In this respect, also taking into account that specific commitments purely based on
legislative and administrative acts addressed to the general public should not be
admitted lightly, but must actually pass the specificity test (see para. 408) regarding all
the elements where such commitment is claimed to exist, the Tribunal finds that the
Respondent did not make any specific commitment in the pertinent legislative decrees

or energy accounts that it would maintain the amount or the duration of incentive

439.

payments exactly at the level originally laid down in the applicable energy accounts. At
the same time, in the Tribunal’s view, the pertinent legal framework, considering all
the aspects analyzed before (see paras. 425-430), led a circumspect and reasonable
investor to believe that the incentive tariff regime created by the Respondent would
remain intact in its overall structure and its essential elements, i.e. that it would not be
subject to fundamental or radical changes to the detriment of the investors. Differently
put, the investor community in the Italian renewables sector could legitimately rely on
the overall integrity of the incentivization regime for solar energy in Italy. This
community nonetheless had to be prepared for certain, non-radical modifications of the
applicable legal framework, without this constituting a violation of their legitimate

expectations, as these only protected them against fundamental or radical changes.
bb) Protection against fundamental or radical modifications

In view of the conclusion of the previous section, it becomes clear that, under the
circumstances of the present case, the Claimant’s legitimate expectations arising from
specific commitments of the Respondent coincide with the Claimant’s equally
protected expectation that the legal framework applicable to it would not be subject to
fundamental or radical modifications (see paras. 410 et seq.). Against this background,
the Tribunal can proceed with the remaining steps of its analysis, i.e. whether the
Claimant actually relied on such expectations in making its investments in Italy (iii.)
and whether these expectations were frustrated by the Respondent’s subsequent
conduct (iv.), without any further need to distinguish between the “specific
commitment” and the “protection against fundamental or radical modification”

scenarios.

(iii) Reliance of the Claimant on legitimate expectations

In order for the Claimant to establish that it had legitimate expectations entitled to
protection by Article 10(1) of the ECT, it must also demonstrate that it relied upon the
Respondent’s specific commitment in making its investment and that such reliance was

objectively reasonable.7"!

41 See Joan Micula, et al. v. Romania, \CSID Case No. ARB/05/20, Award, 11 December 2013, para. 668 (CL-

048).

130

440.

441.

In this regard, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant has sufficiently demonstrated that it
actually relied upon the commitments made by the Respondent with respect to the
incentive tariff scheme for renewable energy when making its investments in Italy. In

particular, the Tribunal accepts the Claimant’s evidence that “[t]he certainty provided

 

by the fixed feed-in-tariffs for a 20-year period was a critical factor in justifying

decisions to invest in solar plants in Italy”,”4? that in making the decision whether to
invest in Italy’s renewable energy sector, the Claimant “relied on the entire legislative
and contractual regime offered by Italy to induce investment in renewable energy”??
and that “[e]ntry into operation entitled the company operating the plant to feed-in
tariffs at a pre-established rate upon application. The feed-in tariffs that the plant was
entitled to were known in advance, as they were set in the Energy Accounts, based on
the plant’s capacity (in megawatts) and date of entry into service”.?4+

This finding is not put into question by the fact that the Claimant’s expectations did not
only cover, but even exceeded the Respondent’s specific commitments which were
limited to the guarantee that the incentive tariff scheme for PV energy established by
the Respondent would not be subject to fundamental or radical changes (see para. 437).
This excessive reliance on the part of the Claimant notably becomes manifest in its
reiterated submission that, when making its investments in Italy, it relied on the
“stability and visibility of the legal framework, which would not be changed without
proper advance notice” (Cl. Reply, para. 124), that “its investments would receive fixed
feed-in tariffs for 20 years upon a plant’s entry into operation” (Cl. Reply, para. 126)
and that “Silver Ridge, like many other solar investors and banks providing financing,
relied on the promises made in the Energy Accounts in making its investments, chief
among which [was] the Government’s promise to pay fixed feed-in tariffs for 20 years
from the date of entry into operation of a solar plant” (Cl. Reply PHB, para. 14; Cl.
PHB, para. 58). As shown above, the reliance of the Claimant on the certainty of the
Italian FIT regime (see para. 436) was not objectively justified under the circumstances

and was therefore not reasonable, inasmuch as it goes beyond the commitment to

445.

maintain the overall structure and the essential elements of the incentive tariff scheme

for renewable energy.

As stated before (see para. 439), the Tribunal’s task is only to take those expectations
on which the Claimant relied and where such reliance was objectively reasonable, to
the last step of its analysis, i.e. the question of whether such legitimate expectations of
the investor were frustrated by the host State’s conduct. In this regard, excessive
subjective reliance of the Claimant does not do any harm to its case, but only results in
the Tribunal’s leaving aside of the Claimant’s reliance on expectations to the extent that

it goes beyond what was objectively reasonable.

The Tribunal further takes note of the Claimant’s evidence that it “engaged numerous

745 and that it

legal, financial and technical experts in Italy to inform [its] views’
“evaluated [the Italian] system very carefully, as did hundreds of other developers, and
it was deemed that if [Silver Ridge] built the project and [...] got it operational, the
GSE was obligated, under the regulations, to sign the contract” (Tr. 24 September 2019,
13:16-20 [Hunt]). In the Tribunal’s view, in spite of certain contentions on the part of
the Respondent to the contrary (see para. 353), the quality of the Claimant’s due
diligence efforts does not raise any concerns regarding the reasonableness of the

Claimant’s reliance on the Respondent’s commitment to protect the Claimant from

fundamental or radical modifications of the legal framework applicable to it.

Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant could reasonably rely on the
Respondent’s commitment to protect the Claimant from fundamental or radical
modifications of the Italian incentive tariff scheme for PV energy and that the Claimant

actually relied on this commitment when making its investments in Italy.

(iv) Frustration of legitimate expectation of the Claimant

The decisive question therefore becomes whether the Respondent, by its conduct
subsequent to the investment, notably by adopting the Spalma-incentivi Decree,
frustrated the legitimate expectations of the Claimant in the afore-described sense. This
boils down to the assessment whether the modification of the existing incentive tariff

regime for renewable energy produced from PV plants was fundamentally or radically

%5 Tbid., para. 7.

132

446.

447.

altered, as contended by the Claimant (see para. 339), or only adapted to new
developments in a manner and to an extent that remains under this threshold, in the

form of a “fine-tuning” of the system, as argued by the Respondent (see para. 342).

The self-characterization of the Spalma-incentivi Decree, which sought, according to
its own terms, to “reformulate” or “remodulate” (“la tariffa incentivante [...] é
rimodulata”)*** the incentives regime under the energy accounts, suggests the latter to
be the case. Yet, this cannot be the authoritative test for the Tribunal when answering
the question of whether the change brought about by the Spalma-incentivi Decree was
sufficiently momentous to qualify it as fundamental or radical. As explained above (see
para. 419), the balancing exercise to be undertaken by the Tribunal between the
Claimant’s interest in the stability of the legal framework and the Respondent’s right to
adapt its legislative and regulatory framework to new developments (see para. 411) can
be usefully structured by considering and weighing three factors, i.e. whether or not the
modifications brought about by the Spalma-incentivi Decree (aa) could draw on a
public policy purpose, i.e. were reasonable, (bb) could have been expected by the
Claimant, i.e. were foreseeable and (cc) did not exceed what was necessary, i.e. were
proportionate. Accordingly, the Tribunal will analyze the pertinent arguments of the

Parties within this framework.
aa) Reasonableness

As concerns the first factor, the Respondent has argued throughout the proceedings that
the adoption of the Spalma-incentivi Decree and the ensuing reduction of incentive
tariff payments were triggered by developments which prompted the Respondent to
become active (see paras. 341-342). In particular, the Respondent submits that, given
the rapid growth of the market of renewable energy production, the ever-growing
burden for the energy consumers had to be mitigated in order to avoid a reduction in
energy consumption. Accordingly, the decree, in order to enhance the competitiveness
of the country, sought to weigh the sustainability of the support scheme for renewable
energy against a comprehensive evaluation of burdens for enterprises in general and

small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) in particular (Resp. Rejoinder, para. 364).

6 Article 26(3) of the Spalma-incentivi Decree (CL-085).

133

448.

449.

While the Parties’ submissions differ as to whether energy consumers had to shoulder
an excessive or disproportionate burden or not (Cl. Reply, paras. 160, 164-182;
Counter-Memorial, paras. 314-326, 497), the Tribunal notes that the Spalma-incentivi
Decree expressly enumerates amongst its goals to “foster more sustainable policies
supporting renewable energy”.*4’ Furthermore, according to the official documents
accompanying the draft law-decree presented to the Italian Parliament, it had two

objectives:

On the one hand enhance the economy, especially referred to small and
medium-size enterprises which are the backbone of the Italian economic
system. On the other hand guarantee fair tariffs in the electric sector,
rebalancing the charges among the different categories of consumers and
reducing forms of levying which are excessive or unjustified.”

The Tribunal observes that the Blusun v. Italy tribunal, though assessing the Romani
Decree and the Fourth Energy Account, accepted the reduction in incentive tariff
payments at that time (i.e. three years before the Spalma-incentivi Decree) to have been
“a response to a genuine fiscal need, given the large take-up under the earlier Energy
Accounts”.24? Furthermore, the Italian Constitutional Court, addressing the 2014

Spalma-incentivi Decree, stated:

In fact, in 2014 the legislature intervened in an economic environment in
which — in view of the profitability of feed-in tariffs for solar energy from
photovoltaic sources, gradually become more pronounced, both
compared to production costs (due to the sudden technological
development of the sector), and with respect to the overall European
framework — came into light an increasing economic weight of such
incentives on the final consumers of electricity (especially small- and
medium-sized companies in the domestic economy).

It acted to rebalance the situation, with the declared aim of “promoting
better sustainability in the policy of support for renewable energy” (Art.
26, paragraph 1 of Law Decree no. 91 of 2014) and to “achieve a more
equitable distribution of costs among the various categories of consumers
of electricity”, providing in this regard that the lower charges for the user

are, in fact, “intended for the reduction of electricity rates for customers
in medium-voltage and low-voltage ranges [...]” (Art. 23 cited law
decree).

The matter in question is therefore an intervention that responds to a
public interest, in terms of the balancing of opposing interests at stake,
which aims to combine the policy of supporting the production of energy
from renewable sources with the higher correlated costs charged to end
users of electricity.?°°

450. In the context of its reasonableness assessment, it is not for the Tribunal to decide
whether the host State made the right choice in selecting and prioritizing public policy
objectives, but rather to determine whether the reasons relied upon by the host State in
order to justify its conduct are, under the circumstances, plausible public policy
objectives. In the Tribunal’s view, this is indeed the case in respect to the Respondent’s
claim that, when adopting the Spalma-incentivi Decree, it saw a need to strengthen the
sustainability of the incentive tariff scheme for renewable energy.”*! The Tribunal also
accepts that securing the stability of the incentivization regime may entail a certain
redistribution of economic advantages and disadvantages among the actors

participating in the system, notably including the producers of PV energy.

451. In addition, the Respondent has argued that the economic emergency situation
prevailing in Italy at the time called for action on the part of the State (see para. 342).
The Tribunal observes that also the unanimous Belenergia v. Italy tribunal accepted the

Respondent’s contentions qualifying the Spalma-incentivi Decree “as an emergency

measure to tackle the economic crisis”.*°* In a similar vein, in the Greentech v. Italy

award, it was stated that “[t]he majority of the Tribunal does not deny that Italy faced

‘a situation of economic difficulty’, as Professor Sacerdoti writes in his dissenting

opinion. However, none of the circumstances evidenced in this case reach the level of
force majeure”? Indeed, Professor Sacerdoti acknowledged that the incentivization
scheme “was quite onerous for the Italian economy, even more so in times of economic
difficulty and lack of growth, making the reduction of the burden desirable”.?** Leaving
aside the question of force majeure as not relevant to the case at hand, the present
Tribunal notes that in both cases, in spite of their very different outcomes, all of the
arbitrators agreed that the Italian government acted in a situation of economic difficulty

when adopting the Spalma-incentivi Decree.

Against this background, the Tribunal is satisfied that the Respondent, when adopting
the Spalma-incentivi Decree, could plausibly claim to have acted on the basis of
legitimate public policy objectives, notably strengthening the sustainability of the
incentive tariff scheme for renewable energy in a situation of economic difficulty. In
that sense, the measures taken by the Respondent in response to these challenges, in

particular the Spalma-incentivi Decree, can claim to be reasonable.
bb) Foreseeability

As already acknowledged by the Tribunal (see para. 434), the approach taken by the
Spalma-incentivi Decree (as well as, for that matter, by the Destinazione Italia Decree;
see paras. 137-138) was new in the sense that under the previous reforms, a PV plant,
once admitted to the incentivization regime, would obtain a specific incentive tariff and
would keep it for the full duration of twenty years; the lower amount of incentive
payments offered in the subsequent energy accounts would then only apply for PV
plants newly admitted to the system. In contrast, the Spalma-incentivi Decree modified
the amount and/or duration of the incentive payments for existing PV plants already
receiving incentive tariffs under one of the energy accounts starting from 1 January
2015 (see para. 138). In this respect, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant’s submission

that the Spalma-incentivi Decree was indeed “the first of its kind” (Cl. PHB, para. 75).

This raises the question of whether such modification of approach was at all foreseeable

for the Claimant. According to the Claimant itself, “[t]he measure was not predictable,

2018, para. 451 (CL-271).

456.

contrary to Italy’s assertion” (Cl. PHB, para. 75). To start with, the Tribunal is not
convinced by the Belenergia v. Italy tribunal’s finding that the reduction in incentive
payments brought about by the Spalma-incentivi Decree “is not surprising in light of
Italy’s previous significant reductions of incentives to new plants entering into
operation before Belenergia first invested in Italy in September 2011”.?°> As explained
in the preceding paragraph, the “previous significant reductions” were all prospective
reductions, with none of them providing for changes applying to already existing plants.
Accordingly, the Claimant (see para. 339) is correct to argue that these reductions could
not, therefore, reasonably prompt an investor to expect that the Respondent would make
changes to the incentive payments it had offered to PV plants already in operation and

already covered by an existing energy account.

Furthermore, although the Respondent (Resp. Rejoinder, para. 449; Tr. 23 September
2019, 161:23-162:4 [Aiello]) considers the Destinazione Italia Decree to be a clear
signal to the operators in the renewable energy market that there was a need to
reconsider the incentives tariffs regime, the Tribunal sides with the Claimant (Cl. PHB,
para. 78) on this issue. The Destinazione Italia Decree is not relevant to the assessment
of whether the Claimant could have foreseen the Spalma-incentivi Decree because all
of the Claimant’s investments in the present case had already been made by the date of

this decree’s adoption in December 2013 (see para. 137).

As holds true for the legitimate expectations analysis as a whole, the relevant moment
with respect to which one has to assess what was foreseeable to the investor or not must
be the moment of making the investment. In this regard, the Tribunal wishes to recall
its previous finding (see para. 437) that, at this moment in time, the Claimant could
legitimately rely on the maintaining of the overall integrity of the incentivization regime
for solar energy in Italy, but had to be prepared for certain, non-radical modifications
of this legal framework. The Tribunal deems it important to further recall that at no
moment in time was the energy accounts’ approach of only applying the reduced
incentives to newly admitted PV plants part and parcel of the investor’s legitimate
expectations (see para. 435). Accordingly, the Spalma-incentivi Decree’s changing of
the approach that had hitherto been practiced and its modifying of the amount and/or

duration of incentive tariff payments for PV plants already admitted to an energy

account from | January 2015 on was, in the Tribunal’s view, not unforeseeable to the

Claimant at the moment when it took its investment decisions.

In this regard, the Tribunal agrees with the submission of the Respondent
(Resp. Counter-Memorial, paras. 394-395) that a prudent investor acting in a highly
regulated market such as the electricity market must, in the course of its risk assessment,
analyze and take into consideration the whole range of potential advantages and
disadvantages associated with the dynamics of the market which might also call for
policy adjustments on the part of the host State. Having said that, this does not mean
that every turn of policy must be anticipated. In particular, even the reasonable and
circumspect investor must not anticipate radical change, which takes the Tribunal to the

third step of its analysis.
cc) Proportionality

As regards thirdly the proportionality question, i.e. whether the measures taken by the
Respondent to reach the aforementioned public policy objectives, i.e. a 6 % to 8 %
reduction in FIT, did not exceed what was necessary, the Tribunal notes that the
positions of the Parties on this issue diverge massively, ranging from a mere “fine-
tuning” which did not meaningfully impact the economics of the incentives (Resp.
Counter-Memorial, para. 391) to claiming that “Italy fundamentally altered the
regulatory framework under which Silver Ridge Power BV had made its investment”
(Cl. Reply, para. 145), thus effectuating “a sudden, unexpected and fundamental shift

of the regulatory regime” (Cl. Reply, para. 156).

The Tribunal further observes that, according to the Respondent, the internal rate of
return of PV plants of the size and entry into operation of the Claimant’s PV plants is
around 13 to 16 % (Resp. Counter-Memorial, para. 404; Resp. PHB, para. 61).7°° The
Claimant (Cl. Reply, paras. 128, 133, 143) contends, however, that the return in its
particular case was below that estimate and that the cut in the FIT deprived it of a
significant part of its projected revenues. In particular, the Claimant submits that when

it decided to invest in the Frosinone plants (see paras. 533 et seq.), the anticipated return

to the equity investors was estimated at a rate of 8.7 %~°’ and that the average unlevered

IRR of its investment portfolio in Italy projected at the time of making the investment

decision was in the range of 10.3-10.4 % (post-tax).?>°

When confronted with a similar situation of sharply differing numerical submissions of
the Parties, the SunReserve v. Italy tribunal**’ recalled the standard of “fair
remuneration” or “fair return”, as contained in Article 7(2)(d) of Legislative Decree
No. 387/2003 as well as, as this Tribunal would add, Article 24(2) of the Romani

Decree (see para. 432), and concluded:

The Tribunal does not consider it appropriate or necessary to determine the
precise percentage or range that satisfied the “fair remuneration” criteria,
especially in the absence of such a numerical benchmark having been set by
Italy while regulating the photovoltaic energy market. [...] For the purposes
of determining Italy’s liability under Article 10(1) ECT, the Tribunal
considers it sufficient to understand “fair remuneration” qualitatively, as
opposed to quantitatively.”
The present Tribunal endorses this qualitative approach and will also apply it in
answering the question of whether the 6 % to 8 % reduction in FIT brought about by

the Spalma-incentivi Decree was proportionate or not.

In this regard, the Tribunal first observes that the Spalma-incentivi Decree did not
eliminate the existing energy accounts system. Its main consequence was a reduction
of the incentive payments for solar energy which amounted, with respect to the
Claimant’s PV plants, to an 8 % decrease in FIT from 1 January 2015 on (see
paras. 139-141). In the Tribunal’s view, maintaining a system with modifications, as
opposed to replacing it by a completely new system, may serve to some extent as an
indicator of whether a change was fundamental or not. At the same time, the Tribunal
acknowledges that this can only be one factor to be taken into account in a more
comprehensive analysis, which notably has to include an assessment of the impact of

the modifications in question. Otherwise a host State could immunize itself against the

claim of radically changing the legal framework by simply referring to the continued
existence of the overall system, irrespective of how momentous the adopted

modifications are.

In this context, the Tribunal further notes the Claimant’s submission that the Spalma-
incentivi Decree had retroactive effect (Cl. Reply, para. 156; Resp. Counter-Memorial,
para. 334), thus indicating a structural deviation from the existing framework. The
Tribunal would recall with respect to this claim of retroactivity that the reduction in
incentive tariff payments became effective only from 1 January 2015 onwards, i.e. after
the adoption and entry into force of the decree (see para. 138). Accordingly, the
Claimant could keep the FIT it had already received and obtained reduced incentive
payments for the future. The fact that the Claimant expected the FIT to be fixed for the
whole 20-year period (see paras. 436, 441) is not relevant in this regard as long as the
incentive payments received by the Claimant in the remainder of the period still
represent a fair remuneration or return, since this was the (only) reasonable expectation
on which the Claimant could, and did rely, in the present case (see para. 444). In that

sense, the Spalma-incentivi Decree was not a retroactive measure.°!

Moreover, the Claimant (see para. 339) has characterized the Italian incentive tariff
regime for renewable energy as an “ex ante support scheme” where the government
guarantees incentives payments at a specified level which the investor will take into
account when planning its investment. According to the Claimant, by adopting the
Spalma-incentivi Decree, the Respondent surprisingly introduced elements of an ex
post regime which the Claimant could not have anticipated. In this regard, the Tribunal
accepts the Claimant’s evidence (Cl. Reply, paras. 119, 121; Cl. PHB, para. 57)?°? that
investments in the renewables sector require a substantial capital investment upfront.
This means that if changes in the remuneration scheme occur over the lifetime of the
PV plant, the investor is not as flexible as in other industries to adapt to such a change
of circumstances. In the Tribunal’s view, this aspect must be taken into account in the

Claimant’s favor in the overall assessment to be made, without losing sight of the fact,

See also First Witness Statement Christopher Hunt, para. 27 as well as the acknowledgment by the

Respondent’s own witnesses of the significant upfront capital investment required in order to build and develop
a solar plant (Tr. 24 September 2019, 112:8-21 [Bacchiocchi]).

however, that the Claimant was not stripped of all scope of maneuvering, e.g. with

respect to operating costs.

In any event, neither the purported retroactivity of the Spalma-incentivi legislation nor
the alleged shift from an ex ante to an ex post support scheme can change the overall
assessment of the Tribunal that the Italian incentivization scheme for solar energy, as

modified by the Spalma-incentivi Decree, was essentially the same as the previous one.

Nonetheless, although the quantitative element is in itself not decisive (see para. 460),
the Tribunal accepts that a reduction of 8 % of incentive payments had a considerable
impact on the Claimant’s solar plants, in particular in combination with the
aforementioned aspect that in the PV sector, the investor is not as flexible as in other
industries to adapt to such a change of circumstances. While this consideration might
cast some doubt on the proportionality of the Spalma-incentivi legislation, the Tribunal
is satisfied that it did not exceed what was necessary to reach its public policy

objectives, namely for the following reasons.

To begin with, the Spalma-incentivi Decree did not apply a one-size-fits-all approach
to the entire community of PV investors, but offered them a certain choice between
three options (see para. 139). Furthermore, as concerns Option C, which is the relevant
one in the case at hand, the decree distinguished between three categories of PV plants
depending on their respective capacity and reduced the incentive payments for smaller
plants by 6 % and for bigger plants by 8 %. This strikes the Tribunal as a plausible
effort of differentiation by virtue of which the host State sought to adequately distribute
the economic burden of the FIT reduction on the PV energy producer community. That
the Claimant, whose plants all fall in the high-capacity category (see para. 141), had to
bear a FIT reduction of 8 % is the result of that effort of differentiation and the host

State’s legitimate policy choice to privilege smaller PV plants.?°

The Tribunal is aware that, as emphasized by the Respondent (Resp. Counter-
Memorial, paras. 355-359), Article 26 of the Spalma-incentivi Decree introduced
certain safeguard measures. In particular, it was possible for the beneficiaries of the

modified incentives to access bank loans for a maximum amount equal to the difference

263 See, in a similar vein, para. 604.

141

468.

469.

between the original and the modified incentive.” In addition, the beneficiaries could
transfer a portion of the received incentives, up to a maximum of 80 %, to an acquirer
selected among major European financial operators.”° At the same time, the Tribunal
acknowledges that the Claimant (Cl. Memorial, paras. 133-134) has challenged the
effectiveness of these safeguard measures. The Tribunal appreciates the Respondent’s
effort to provide mitigating mechanisms for PV producers, but, in view of the lack of

reliable evidence on this matter, does not include it in its proportionality assessment.

Moreover, the Tribunal also takes note of the financial problems incurred by the
Claimant due to the reduction of FIT by virtue of the Spalma-incentivi Decree which
have allegedly magnified its negative effects (see para. 322). However, the Respondent
(Counter-Memorial, para. 397) submits that these problems were not so much the result
of the decree’s adoption, but rather of the Claimant’s excessive use of leverage in
financing its investment projects. In this regard, the Tribunal accepts the Claimant’s
contention (Cl. Memorial, para. 92; see para. 108) that financing a PV plant with a
leverage of 70-85 % of the construction costs was common practice in the renewables
industry. At the same time, while an investor is free to choose the financing structure it
deems best for its investment, this does not dispense it, as a reasonable investor would
do, from preparing itself for certain strains or stumbles in the flow of incentive
payments, for whatever reason. Accordingly, in the Tribunal’s view, the inability of the
Claimant’s subsidiaries to meet their obligations under the project financing agreements
due to reduced cash flows and the ensuing imposition of dividends distribution blocks
and technical defaults (see paras. 322-323), might well have implied financial losses
for the Claimant exceeding the 8 % reduction in incentive payments for the remainder
of the 20-year period, but these additional losses cannot be attributed to the decree as

such, but rather to entrepreneurial choices of the Claimant.

For the foregoing reasons and considering that the fair and equitable treatment standard
has, in the words of the Blusun v. Italy tribunal, “a relatively high threshold”,?® which

is echoed in the recent SunReserve v. Italy award according to which, “the overall

267

standard to establish a breach of the FET obligation is high”,*°’ the present Tribunal,

while acknowledging that an 8 % reduction in incentive tariff payments for the bulk of
the 20-year incentivization period must have resulted in a relevant reduction in income

for the Claimant, does not consider this reduction to be excessive or disproportionate.

470. This result is confirmed both in the caselaw of the Italian Constitutional Court and in
what the Tribunal considers to be the emerging trend in the arbitral tribunals’

assessment of the Spalma-incentivi Decree.

471. The Italian Constitutional Court stated with respect to a constitutional challenge of
Article 26(2) and (3) of the Spalma-incentivi Decree on the ground that it was contrary

to Articles 3 and 41 of the Italian Constitution:

8. The complaints of violations of the Constitution and European parameters
referred to in the appeals share a basic argument that the contested
paragraph 3 of Art. 26 of Law Decree no. 91 of 2014 would weaken the
legitimate expectations of the producers with regard to the tariffs in
question, preserving their established positions of advantage recognized in
agreements with GSE. [...]

8.2. The examination of the reasoning and the content of the contested
provision leads to the conclusion that this has had no impact on lasting
relationships attributable to agreements with GSE entered into by the
beneficiaries of incentives in an unreasonable, arbitrary and unpredictable
manner, infringing (as claimed) the principle noted. [...]

8.3. [...] the guaranteed consistency of the incentive throughout the period
of entitlement does not imply as a necessary consequence that the related
measure should remain for 20 years unchanged and completely shielded
from the variations common to lasting relationships. This is even more so
when one considers that the agreements entered into with the GSE are not
considered contracts intended for the exclusive profit of the operator who
should see the initial conditions unchanged for 20 years, even if the
technological conditions change significantly, but constitute tools of
regulation aimed at achieving incentives of certain energy sources,
balancing them with other sources of renewable energy, and with minimal
sacrifice for users who also bear the economic burden of it. [...]

All this leads to the conclusion that the reformulation of the incentives by
the contested provision does not present the alleged characteristic of
“unpredictability”, and indeed the same resulting in some way forewarned
and finalized precisely to ensure the “stability” taken into account by the
laws establishing the incentives for photovoltaic plants as a characteristic of

Award, 25 March 2020, para. 688 (RL-050).

143

the entire system and not the individual incentive; in addition to being (in
the context of a “regulated” sector market, like the one under discussion) an
element physiologically related to a regulatory business risk.

472. As regards the assessment of the Spalma-incentivi Decree by arbitral tribunals, it is true
that the majority in ESPF Beteiligungs GmbH et al. v. Italy found that “the effect of the
Spalmaincentivi Decree on the Claimants’ investments was significant”? and that this
had “a sizable impact and cannot be qualified as a de minimis effect”.?”° In a similar
vein, the majority in the Greentech v. Italy award stated: “While the investor might
need to live with some minor adjustments, nothing alerted the Claimants that they
would need to accept changes of the magnitude imposed by the Spalma-incentivi
Decree”.2”! In contrast, the dissenting arbitrator in that case, Professor Sacerdoti, came

to the conclusion that “[t]he 6-8% reduction only moderately affected PV operators’

>> 272

revenues [...] Subsequently, the unanimous Belenergia v. Italy award spoke of “a

modest 6% to 8% reduction to a subsidy (feed-in tariff) paid in addition to the energy

99 273

price applicable for 20 years of a PV plant’s estimated life and the equally

unanimous SunReserve v. Italy award found “an 8% reduction in incentive tariffs [not]

99274

to result in an unfair remuneration for any of Claimants’ power plants as well as

that “the remodulation of the incentive tariff regime by the Spalma-incentivi Decree did

not impede the prospects of fair remuneration for photovoltaic plants”.?”>

473. Furthermore, while it is true that the majority of the CEF v. /taly tribunal concluded
that the Spalma-incentivi Decree constituted a breach of Article 10(1) ECT, it did so in
the light of the particular features of the legitimate expectations claim it had accepted

with respect to the claimant’s investment in the Enersol plant,?”° which are not

transposable to the analysis of the present Tribunal. Moreover, Professor Sacerdoti even
dissented from this finding and stated that “[a]s to the tariff cut put in place by the
Spalmaincentivi, the evidence shows in my opinion that it was a reasonable measure,

taken in a transparent way”.?””

dd) Conclusion

Against this background, the Tribunal concludes that the changes brought about by the
Respondent’s adoption of the Spalma-incentivi Decree (notably the 8 % FIT reduction
applied to the Claimant’s PV plants from 1 January 2015 on) were, considering all
relevant elements of the case, reasonable, foreseeable and proportionate and did
therefore not constitute a fundamental or radical alteration of the applicable legal
framework to the detriment of the investor. Thus, the corresponding legitimate
expectation of the Claimant was not frustrated and the fair and equitable treatment claim

based on the Spalma-incentivi Decree must be rejected.

Having found that the fair and equitable treatment standard, as enshrined in
Article 10(1), second sentence, of the ECT, has not been violated in the present case,
the question remains whether the guarantee in Article 10(1), first sentence, according
to which each ECT Contracting Party shall “encourage and create stable, equitable,
favourable and transparent conditions” offers the Claimant any additional protection
with respect to its claim based on the Spalma-incentivi Decree (see para. 394). The
Tribunal responds to this question in the negative as all relevant arguments regarding
maintaining an appropriate degree of stability of the existing legal framework as well
as regarding the necessary measure of transparency when modifying this legal

framework have already been addressed above.

(v) Conclusion

For these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent, by adopting the Spalma-
incentivi Decree, did not violate Article 10(1), first and second sentences, of the ECT
on encouraging and creating stable, equitable, favourable and transparent investment
conditions and on according at all times fair and equitable treatment to investments

protected under the ECT.

(3) Conclusion

In sum, the Tribunal concludes that, by adopting the Spalma-incentivi Decree, the
Respondent has not breached Article 10(1) of the ECT and therefore rejects the

Claimant’s claim in this regard.

PROJECT VEGA AND THE ADOPTION OF THE ROMANI DECREE AND THE FOURTH
ENERGY ACCOUNT

qd) The Parties’ Positions
a. Claimant’s Position

According to the Claimant, the so-called “Project Vega” should have consisted of a
single 123 MW solar plant to be constructed in the northern part of the Italian region of
Puglia, on the outskirts of the Troia municipality. The project was to be built entirely
on agricultural land and was to be divided into five units. Three units were to be built
north of the Troia municipality and the remaining two to the south of it. Both the north
and the south units were to be connected to a single medium-voltage substation through
36 km of medium-voltage cables. The medium-voltage substation, in turn, was to be
connected to a second high-voltage substation built by Terna, i.e. the Italian electricity
transmission system operator, in order to feed the produced energy into the national
high-voltage grid.’’* At the time, Project Vega would have been the largest solar plant
in Europe and constituted, from the Claimant’s point of view, a unique investment
opportunity because its size would have permitted economies of scale (Cl. Memorial,

paras. 162, 164, 177; Cl. PHB, para. 126).

The Claimant further submits that in 2007, AES Solar Energy BV, Silver Ridge Power
BV’s predecessor (see para. 107), entered into an exclusivity agreement with the Italian
developers who owned Project Vega at the time.?”? On 31 October 2007, the AES
Corporation wrote to the Italian developers stating its willingness to option ten solar

projects, including Project Vega, and paid consideration of EUR 3.2 million.7*° On 8

July 2008, AES Sole Italia s.r.1. entered into a framework option agreement”*! with the
holding company of the Italian developers, i.e. World Wind Energy Holding s.r.1. Under
this agreement, which replaced the 2007 exclusivity agreement, AES Sole Italia s.r.1.
acquired the option to purchase a number of solar projects once they were granted the
relevant authorizations and the related land agreements had been concluded. As
consideration, AES Sole Italia s.r.1. undertook to pay an option price of EUR 20,000
per each optioned MW.?*? The framework option agreement covered some of the
original projects, including Project Vega, for a price of EUR 4.5 million, EUR 3.2
million of which was already paid under the first exclusivity agreement”? (Cl.

Memorial, paras. 166-169; Cl. PHB, para. 127).

480. The Claimant contends that, between June 2007 and November 2011, the Italian
developers filed the documents needed for the issuance of the Single Authorization
(autorizzazione unica) by the Puglia Region. They also ensured that Terna would
connect Project Vega to the high-voltage grid and concluded preliminary lease and
acquisition agreements for the land on which both the medium-voltage substation and
the plant would be built.2*4 In addition, on 18 January 2011, AES Solar, through ASI
Troia s.r.1., concluded a contract with Siemens s.p.a. and Guastamacchia s.p.a. for the
engineering, procurement, construction, testing and commissioning of the substation on
a turnkey basis, for a price of EUR 4.1 million and with a view to complete the
substation by September 2011.7*° Furthermore, starting from November 2010, AES
Sole Italia s.r.1. ordered PV modules from First Solar GmbH pursuant to a framework
agreement that its ultimate parent company, AES Solar Energy Ltd., had concluded
with First Solar in April 2008786 (Cl. Memorial, paras. 170, 175-176).

481. The Claimant emphasizes that, under the projected construction schedule, Project Vega
would have been mostly completed in 2011 and would have benefited from the FIT

under the Third Energy Account. At the end of 2010, the Claimant made various efforts

Vega. On 17 February 2011, the Single Authorization was published in the Puglia
Region Official Gazette?”’ (Cl. Memorial, para. 181).

483. As regards financing, the Claimant submits that AES Solar intended to fund the
construction of Project Vega with a combination of equity and project finance, in the
amount of 17 % and 83 %, respectively, as was common practice in the market.”?! The
Claimant denies that such an equity/debt ratio was a risky business choice or made the
project more difficult to be financed. The Claimant further argues that, in view of the
magnitude of the project, it started looking for financing early on, i.e. in December
2010/January 2011, by reaching out to banks it had already dealt with in the past,
namely BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole, Dexia, Société Générale and Unicredit.
According to the Claimant, initial reactions were positive and AES Solar was expecting
to receive financing on terms similar to those obtained for the other 25 PV plants.2°* On
17 February 2011, AES Solar, through a subsidiary of AES Sole Italia s.r.1., i.e. ASTL
s.r.]., entered into a financing agreement with Investec Bank PLC for the acquisition of

further solar panels?*? (Cl. Memorial, paras. 180, 183, 193; Cl. Reply, para. 235; Cl.

[Pisi]).

Hence, according to the Claimant, Project Vega was ready to enter the final stage, i.e.
the construction of the solar plant. However, as submitted by the Claimant, in the spring
of 2011, the Romani Decree and the Fourth Energy Account dramatically changed the
conditions for access to the FIT, making it impossible for the Claimant to secure
financing for Project Vega and forcing it to abandon the project, thus incurring

substantial additional expenses (Cl. Memorial, paras. 184-185, 192).

In particular, the Claimant contends that between the entry into force of the Romani
Decree on 29 March 2011 and the new deadline for the Third Energy Account, as set
by the Romani Decree for 31 May 2011, only two months remained. There was thus no
way that Project Vega, which was not yet built, could qualify for FIT under the Third
Energy Account. The Claimant further asserts that the Romani Decree did not provide
for a new FIT regime, but left this issue open until the Fourth Energy Account was
enacted on 5 May 2011. Moreover, the Romani Decree created new restrictions for PV
plants built on agricultural land. According to the Claimant, this is relevant to the
present arbitration since Project Vega was to be constructed on agricultural land and no
land use restrictions were provided in the previous legislation. However, Project Vega
was encompassed by the exception provided for in the Romani Decree (see para. 127),
as its Single Authorization had been issued on 3 February 2011, i.e. before the entry
into force of the Romani Decree on 29 March 2011; hence, Project Vega was required
to be connected to the grid before 29 March 2012 in order to accede to FIT under any
energy account?™4 (Cl. Memorial, paras. 187-190, 194; Cl. PHB, paras. 129-130).

The Claimant argues that the Romani Decree led to a great outcry in the Italian solar
market and resulted in the lending institutions halting disbursements even on loans and
leasing agreements already decided. As regards Project Vega more specifically, the
Claimant submits that because of the Romani Decree’s 29 March 2012 deadline and the
cancellation of the Third Energy Account, the banks contacted by AES Solar were not
willing to take on either the risk that the construction of the plant would not be

completed by the deadline (thus resulting in the project not qualifying for any renewable

incentives) or the uncertainty about the FIT to be published in the future energy account
(Cl. Memorial, paras. 26, 191-193; Cl. Reply, paras. 28, 234-235, 249; Cl. PHB,
paras. 133-135; Cl. Reply PHB, para. 37; Tr. 23 September 2019, 209:5-11 [Pisi]).

Furthermore, according to the Claimant, the uncertainty with respect to the new level
of FIT prevented it from determining the economic viability of Project Vega and, as a
consequence, from approving the expenditures necessary to advance the project and
from presenting it to potential lenders in order to secure project financing. Hence, AES
Solar decided to halt all major expenditures on the project and to consider resuming the
project only after the new FIT were known. It also created a suspension budget that
would allow the Claimant to quickly resume the project and connect it by 29 March
2012, once the new tariffs became known?> (Cl. Memorial, paras. 194-195; Cl. PHB,
para. 131; Cl. Reply PHB, para. 36; Tr. 24 September 2019, 133:13-134:4
[Bacchiocchi)]).

The Claimant contends that, only after the adoption of the Fourth Energy Account on
5 May 2011, it was finally in a position to reassess the economic viability of Project
Vega. The Claimant submits in this regard that the project, if built and connected by
December 2011, would have obtained FIT more than 32 % lower than those under the
Third Energy Account and that the late adoption of the new FIT forced the Claimant to
further delay the project’s construction to a point where the scheduled date for
completion was dangerously close to the 29 March 2012 cut-off date imposed by the
Romani Decree?”® (Cl. Memorial, paras. 202-203, 206-209; Cl. Reply, para. 236;
Cl. PHB, para. 132).

Moreover, according to the Claimant, the Fourth Energy Account created the additional
hurdle of having to qualify for the two solar plant registers to be administered by the
GSE, as a prerequisite to accede to the 2011-2012 incentives. The Claimant argues in
this regard that, in the absence of a central database listing the applications for permits
to build solar plants, it was impossible to anticipate how many applications to the GSE
registers there would be and whether Project Vega would be included in either register.

Under these circumstances, the Claimant would have had to wait until September 2011

and the publication of the final GSE register to know with certainty whether Project
Vega would be admitted to the register and therefore qualify for FIT under the Fourth
Energy Account?” (Cl. Memorial, paras. 204-205).

The Claimant argues that, in May 2011, its subsidiaries and itself had already sustained
approximately EUR 11 million in acquisition and development costs for Project
Vega.” In addition, AES Sole Italia s.r.1. had already bought 60 MW worth of solar
panels and had undertaken to buy another 40 MW from First Solar,?°? which constituted
a major financial liability. Hence, AES Sole Italia made efforts to renegotiate delivery
terms and the price of the panels. Furthermore, the Claimant started considering
alternative development scenarios for Project Vega, for instance by reducing the size
of the solar plant (e.g. resulting in the so-called “Project Phoenix” as a 38.5 MW plant
instead of the 123 MW for Project Vega), thus allowing for a reduction in equity
funding requirements.*” Moreover, the Claimant scrutinized other options, notably
securing short-term financing to cover the construction expenses (e.g. with UBS) or

finding new equity investors or final buyers.*°!

While initial reactions from major
players in the renewables market were promising, all interested parties eventually
withdrew from negotiations because they considered the risk of Project Vega not

achieving the incentives to be too high (Cl. Memorial, paras. 197-200, 210-213).

According to the Claimant, since all estimated scenarios could not be realized or would
have resulted in a substantial loss for the Claimant, its board concluded in May 2011
that, in light of the dramatic change in the regulatory environment, it could not go
forward with Project Vega in any variation and had no choice but to abandon the

302

project. Termination letters were sent to the Italian developers on | June 201 and to

Siemens on 27 May 2011.°% Eventually, Silver Ridge Power LLC redeployed part of

the PV panels in stock (i.e. the equivalent of 60 MW) on other solar projects it was
developing in Italy, the United States and India, but given the panels’ sharply decreased
value, it registered a loss amounting to EUR 13.18 million. Additionally, AES Sole
Italia s.r.1. had to cancel the solar panel financing agreement with Investec Bank PLC,**
incurring further costs amounting to EUR 1.2 million (Cl. Memorial, paras. 214-216;

Cl. PHB, para. 136; Cl. Reply PHB, para. 41; Tr. 24 September 2019, 42:12-15 [Hunt]).

In sum, the Claimant argues that it was forced to cancel Project Vega, after having
invested more than EUR 20 million in that project, due to the combined effects of the
land use restriction contained in the Romani Decree and the dramatic decrease in the
FIT effectuated by the Fourth Energy Account, suddenly making Project Vega
economically unviable (Request, para. 82; Cl. Memorial, paras. 217, 361; Cl. Reply,
para. 238; Cl. PHB, para. 136).

The Claimant contends that the conditions for investment created by the Respondent
were anything but stable, equitable, favorable and transparent and did not accord fair
and equitable treatment, as required by Article 10(1), first and second sentences, of the
ECT (Cl. Memorial, paras. 359, 364; Cl. Reply, paras. 242-243, 246, 250; Cl. PHB,
paras. 125, 149; Cl. Reply PHB, para. 42). Quite the contrary, according to the
Claimant, the adoption of the Romani Decree in March 2011 marked a sudden, radical
and unforeseeable change in approach to PV plants’ eligibility for FIT. These changes
altered the fundamental elements of the incentive regime on which the Claimant relied
in making its investments in Project Vega. The Romani Decree prematurely terminated
the Third Energy Account that had been adopted just seven months before, i.e. in
August 2010, setting as a new end-date the respective plant’s entry into operation until
31 May 2011 instead of the originally applicable date of 31 December 2013. In addition,
the uncertainty arising from the Respondent’s measures made it impossible for Project
Vega to be completed before the new 29 March 2012 deadline set by the Romani Decree
(Cl. Memorial, paras. 360-361; Cl. Reply, para. 245). Hence, according to the Claimant,
the Romani Decree and the Fourth Energy Account, in the very short timeframe of two

months, profoundly altered the Italian incentives regime available for PV plants,

negatively affecting projects such as Project Vega that were already at an advanced

stage of development (Cl. Memorial, paras. 362-363).

Moreover, the Claimant argues that the Respondent does not deny the instability created
by the Romani Decree, the Fourth Energy Account and the pre-qualification system
introduced by the latter. Accordingly, the Respondent’s attempt to relativize that period
of profound instability by downplaying its length is without merit. The uncertainty
began in March 2011 and ended in September 2011. For a large project like the one in
question, additionally facing the March 2012 completion deadline imposed by the
Romani Decree, this was crucial and indeed lethal for Project Vega (Cl. Reply,

para. 240).

y305 and Charanne v. Spain?

As regards the Respondent’s reliance on the Blusun v. Ital)
awards, the Claimant argues that the Respondent overlooks the distinctions between
these cases and the present one. According to the Claimant, Charanne v. Spain was not
really a legal stability claim. The Blusun v. Italy award, on its part, is distinguishable
on the facts. First, the project in that case consisted of 120 small plants and 250 km of
cables, as opposed to one plant of 5 units along 36 km of cables for Project Vega.
Secondly, the Blusun v. Italy award was based in substantial part on concerns as to the
validity of more informal construction permits issued by localities under a law intended
for small constructions, whereas Project Vega obtained a Single Authorization issued
by the Region of Puglia. Hence, according to the Claimant, Project Vega did not face
the same technical and legal challenges as the Blusun project (Cl. Memorial, para. 359;
Cl. Reply, para. 244; Cl. PHB, paras. 138-139; Cl. Reply PHB, para. 38; Tr. 24
September 2019, 36:16-18 [Hunt]).

In particular, the Claimant insists that the record provides no support for the
Respondent’s assertions (see para. 502) that no causal link can be found between the
adoption of the Romani Decree and the Fourth Energy Account and the failure of
Project Vega, and that any deadlock of financing cannot therefore be imputed to the

Respondent. On the contrary, in the Claimant’s view, the Romani Decree did just that:

3° Blusun S.A., Jean-Pierre Lecorcier and Michael Stein v. Italian Republic, (CSD Case No. ARB/14/3, Award,
27 December 2016, para. 319(4) (CL-010).

Award, 21 January 2016 (CL-011).

153

497.

498.

500.

it created a deadlock for financing large solar projects. There is thus a clear causal link
between the contested measures and the failure of Project Vega (Cl. Reply, paras. 247-

249; Cl. PHB, paras. 137-138; Cl. Reply PHB, para. 38).

Moreover, as concerns the Respondent’s contention that many other PV projects
managed to obtain financing (see paras. 502, 504), the fact that smaller projects were
realized under the Fourth and Fifth Energy Accounts does not, from the Claimant’s
point of view, refute its case with respect to Project Vega, as the Romani Decree had a
dramatic effect especially on large PV projects located on agricultural land such as

Project Vega (Cl. PHB, paras. 140-142).

Furthermore, the Claimant submits that the Respondent’s argument that the Claimant’s
project was huge and that the fact that the Claimant waited until a late stage to look for
financing (see para. 505) demonstrates a lack of understanding of how such projects are
carried out, as well as of the fact that they require a great deal of preparation before
they can be presented to potential lenders and construction works can commence
(Cl. PHB, paras. 143-144; Tr. 23 September 2019, 213:4-6 [Pisi]; 24 September 2019,
39:13-15 [Hunt]; 26 September 2019, 86:5-8 [Dufétre]).

In a similar vein, according to the Claimant, the Respondent errs in contending that the
Claimant purchased solar panels too early and for too high a price (see para. 506). Solar
panels had to be shipped from Asia to Italy, which was a long process, particularly as
there was a “market crunch” and the Claimant, like other investors, was having great
difficulty in getting a sufficient amount of solar panels to build its projects. This is why
the Claimant chose to enter into a framework agreement for the purchase of solar panels
at an early stage*”” and made a rational entrepreneurial choice by doing so (Cl. PHB,
paras. 145-147; Cl. Reply PHB, para. 40; Tr. 23 September 2019, 220:7-11, 232:22-
233:2 [Pisi]; 24 September 2019, 44:17-45:2 [Hunt], 78:23-79:4 [Erdly]).

Finally, as concerns the Respondent’s contention that Project Vega is “alive” (see
para. 509), the Claimant submits that the Province of Foggia, where Project Vega is
located, was affected by a severe drought in 2012 which was recognized as a

“catastrophic event” by a ministerial decision of January 2013. A law adopted in

307 Framework Agreement on the Sale and Purchase of Solar Modules between AES Solar Energy Ltd. and First
Solar GmbH, 14 April 2008 (C-011).

154

501.

502.

503.

December 2013 enabled the extension of the deadline to access FIT under the Fifth
Energy Account for PV plants in areas affected by those “catastrophic events”, thus
enabling ASI Troia to benefit from incentive tariffs under the Fifth Energy Account.
Yet, when the Claimant made the decision to abandon Project Vega in 2011, it could
not have foreseen this course of events (Cl. PHB, para. 148; Cl. Reply PHB, para. 41;
Tr. 24 September 2019, 140:19-23, 141:15-22, 142:14-25 [Bacchiocchi]).

b. Respondent’s Position

The Respondent does not object to the Claimant’s submissions regarding Project
Vega’s location, size, major technical features and the administrative steps taken in
order to realize the project in question (see paras. 478-482). At the same time, the
Respondent rejects the Claimant’s contentions concerning the alleged failure of Project

Vega due to the adoption of the Romani Decree and the Fourth Energy Account.

In particular, the Respondent contends that Project Vega follows the same pattern as
the failed project which the Blusun v. Italy award*®® dealt with. According to the
Respondent, in that as well as in the present case, the immediate cause for the failure of
the project was the lack of financing. The Respondent submits in this regard that the
Claimant (which carries the burden of proof) cannot provide any evidence that the lack
of financing for Project Vega resulted from the adoption of the Romani Decree. To the
contrary, a huge number of PV projects in the very same period obtained financing in
an orderly manner. According to the Claimant’s own submissions, the problem was not
that it could not find financing, but that it considered the deal it was offered too
burdensome. Hence, the Respondent argues that no causal link exists between the
Romani Decree and the Fourth Energy Account, on the one hand, and the failure of
Project Vega on the other (Resp. Counter-Memorial, paras. 283-291, 416-419, 565;
Resp. Rejoinder, paras. 578-579; Resp. PHB, paras. 11, 65; Resp. Reply PHB,
paras. 29-30).

As regards the authority of the Blusun v. Italy award, the Respondent submits that it
might be true that the award was challenged in annulment, not on the assessment of the

Romani Decree, but on different grounds. Hence, according to the Respondent, the

308 Blusun S.A., Jean-Pierre Lecorcier and Michael Stein v. Italian Republic, (CSID Case No. ARB/14/3, Award,
27 December 2016, para. 319(4) (CL-010).

155

504.

505.

506.

507.

Blusun v. Italy award stands unchallenged with respect to the Romani Decree issue

(Resp. Rejoinder, para. 594).

In the Respondent’s view, the real reason for the lack of financing for Project Vega was
the Claimant’s risky business choices. This includes first and foremost the huge and
ambitious character of Project Vega, which would have constituted, following the
Claimant’s own submissions, the largest solar plant in Europe at the time. Moreover, in
order to maximize revenues, the Claimant chose to develop the project financing with
a high equity/debt leverage of approximately 20/80. Thus, the project’s size and
ambition made it riskier in comparison to many other projects in the market that could
attract financing because they entailed a lower risk (Resp. Counter-Memorial,
paras. 409-411; Resp. PHB, paras. 12, 66-67; Resp. Reply PHB, para. 26;
Tr. 23 September 2019, 129:22-130:2 [Malaguti]).

Furthermore, the Respondent argues that the Claimant decided to first start a number of
operations and constructions that implied high expenditures and only at a later stage
began looking for financing. While this might have been a good strategy in abstract
terms, since a more mature project would have possibly been more attractive, this
choice forced the Claimant to disburse most of the available funds before having
secured any concrete financial partners (Resp. Counter-Memorial, para. 411; Resp.

Reply PHB, para. 26; Tr. 23 September 2019, 130:22-131:13 [Malaguti]).

Moreover, according to the Respondent, it is highly surprising that the Claimant
decided to commission the building of substations to connect the future plant to the
national grid, which is an extremely costly operation, as well as to proceed with the
acquisition of PV modules for the total capacity of the plant, without having even signed
an EPC contract for the construction of such a plant. This particularly holds true, as
argued by the Respondent, in view of the fact that the cost of PV modules was dropping
at the time on an almost daily basis (Resp. Counter-Memorial, paras. 412-413; Resp.

PHB, paras. 68-69; Resp. Reply PHB, para. 27).

The Respondent further submits that all this shows a project that still was missing its
fundamental pillars in 2011. Thus, it insists that Project Vega never reached, indeed, it
never came close to, the point of becoming eligible for incentives under any energy

account. It is difficult for the Respondent to believe that the Claimant was peacefully

156

508.

509.

510.

S11.

planning its project while staying confident that no changes in the regulatory framework
would occur in the light of the huge dynamics in the market. According to the
Respondent, regulatory changes that intervene at a time when the investor did not yet
qualify for an incentive tariff, ie. before the acquisition of a “subjective right”, do not
interfere with any legitimate expectations, since at this stage the individual only has a
“mere factual aspiration”, and not a legal expectation, to obtain a certain benefit from
the regulatory framework. In this regard, the Respondent also refers to the caselaw of
the Italian Consiglio di Stato, the highest judicial authority in administrative matters, as
well as to the Blusun v. Italy award (Resp. Counter-Memorial, paras. 408, 415, 566;
Resp. Rejoinder, paras. 580, 583-590; Resp. PHB, para. 12; Resp. Reply PHB, paras.
26, 28).

In addition, the Respondent contends that — in the light of its submissions regarding the
Spalma-incentivi Decree and thus irrespective of the Claimant’s submissions regarding
the Romani Decree and the Fourth Energy Account — the Claimant could not have had
any legitimate expectation at the time when it made the investment to benefit from FIT
under a certain energy account (Resp. Counter-Memorial, para. 564; Resp. Rejoinder,

paras. 591-592).

Moreover, according to the Respondent, Project Vega is back on track again and has
received incentive tariffs under the Fifth Energy Account due to its 2013 registration.
As a consequence, the Respondent argues, the claim regarding Project Vega should be
rejected by the Tribunal. At the very least, the Tribunal should take this fact into
consideration at the damages level (Resp. Rejoinder, paras. 595-598; Resp. PHB, paras.
12, 70).

For the aforementioned reasons, the Respondent contends that its submissions refute
the Claimant’s claims both under the stability and transparency of conditions and the
fair and equitable treatment standards and thus concludes that no infringement of
Article 10(1), first and second sentences, of the ECT has occurred in the present case

(Resp. Counter-Memorial, paras. 552-557; Resp. Rejoinder, paras. 577, 599-600).

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Claimant’s claim regarding Project Vega is framed in terms of both Article 10(1),

first and second sentences, of the ECT, which read:

157

512.

513.

514.

Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this

Treaty, encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent

conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments in

its Area. Such conditions shall include a commitment to accord at all times

to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable

treatment.
The first and second sentences of Article 10(1) of the ECT require an ECT Contracting
Party to observe certain standards of treatment vis-a-vis investors of other ECT
Contracting Parties investing in the former’s territory. If these obligations are breached,
this constitutes an internationally wrongful act which entails the international
responsibility of the host State (see Articles 1 and 2 of the Articles on Responsibility of
States for Internationally Wrongful Acts,*” hereinafter “ASR”) and gives rise to the

legal consequences as laid down in Articles 28 et seq. of the ASR.

According to Article 31(1) of the ASR, which represents customary international
law,*!° the State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation
to make full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act. Hence,
there can be no doubt that, under general international law, the existence of a causal
link between the alleged infringement of obligations under international law and the
damage ensuing from it is an indispensable prerequisite for a compensation claim.*!!
This general tenet of international law also applies in international investment law.
Accordingly, if an obligation under the ECT is not complied with and results in
damages to the detriment of the investor, the ECT Contracting Party in question
becomes liable to compensate the investor for the damage caused by its wrongful act,

and only for that damage.?!”

While the Parties agree that the immediate cause of Project Vega’s failure was the lack
of financing (Cl. Memorial, para. 193; Cl. PHB, para. 134; Resp. Rejoinder, para. 578),
the Parties fundamentally disagree on the relevance of the adoption of the Romani

Decree and the Fourth Energy Account in March and May 2011, respectively, in this

56/83 of 12 December 2001 (CL-004).

Yearbook 2001, Vol. II, 30 (92) (CL-004).

516.

context. The Claimant (see paras. 486 et seq.) argues that the lack of financing was due
to the adoption of these legal acts by the Respondent, which triggered a phase of
regulatory uncertainty and led to a sharp decrease in FIT, thus severely affecting Project
Vega’s economic viability and eventually forcing the Claimant to abandon the project.
Accordingly, the Claimant considers the Respondent’s adoption of the aforementioned
acts and the legal instability created by it to be the real reason for the unavailability of
financing for Project Vega. In contrast, the Respondent (see paras. 502 et seq.) contends
that the project’s economic failure was mainly due to the Claimant’s own business
choices and that therefore no causal link exists between the Romani Decree and the

Fourth Energy Account, on the one hand, and the failure of Project Vega on the other.

Both Parties rely on the Blusun v. Italy award?" in support of their arguments, again in
a contradictory manner. Whereas the Respondent (see para. 502) considers the relevant
facts in the present arbitration to be the same as, or at least widely similar to, those
before the Blusun v. Italy tribunal, thus permitting the transposition of the legal solution
in that case to the present one, the Claimant (see para. 495) argues that the Blusun v.
Italy award must be distinguished on the facts, mainly claiming that two elements in
the factual basis of the case at hand are substantially different from that case. First,
while both projects were quite large, the Blusun project consisted of 120 small plants
with 250 km of cables, as opposed to Project Vega, which consisted of only 5 units with
36 km of cables. Secondly, whereas the Blusun v. Italy award dealt with administrative
permits issued by localities, Project Vega obtained a Single Authorization issued by the
Region of Puglia. Accordingly, in the Claimant’s view, Project Vega did not face the

same technical and legal challenges as the Blusun project.
Indeed, the Blusun vy. Italy award unanimously concluded:

In the Tribunal’s view, the Claimants have not discharged the onus of proof
of establishing that the Italian state’s measures were the operative cause of
the Puglia Project’s failure. Of far greater weight was the continued
dependence on project financing, and the failure to obtain it was due both to
the size of the Project and to justified concerns about the scope of DIA
authorisation, on which the legality of the Project depended. That being so,
the claim under Article 10(1) for loss of the Project would fail in any
event.3!4

519.

The Tribunal acknowledges the Claimant’s efforts to distinguish the factual features of
Project Vega from those of the project in the Blusun v. Italy case and to relate these
allegedly distinct features to the two reasons the Blusun v. Italy tribunal specifically
offered to explain the lack of a causal nexus between Italy’s measures and the failure
of that project (ie. the size of the project and legal concerns regarding the
authorizations). In this regard, the present Tribunal accepts that the fact that, on 3
February 2011, the Region of Puglia issued the Single Authorization for the
construction of Project Vega*!> constitutes a relevant difference when comparing the
two cases. At the same time, in terms of their planned capacity, the two projects are
similar (120 MW for the Blusun project and 123 MW for Project Vega) and either of

them would have constituted (one of) Europe’s largest solar plant(s) at the time.*!°

What is decisive for the Tribunal, however, is that the Blusun v. Italy tribunal based its
conclusion on the finding that the Puglia project “ran a significant risk of incurring legal
or administrative difficulties, even if these could be (and in the event largely were)
overcome. Its success was by no means certain”.*!” Differently put, the Blusun v. Italy
tribunal found that in that case there were other plausible reasons for the difficulties
regarding the attraction of adequate financing, and concluded that the claimants in that
case had not succeeded in discharging the burden of proof falling upon them, i.e. that
the measures adopted by Italy were the proximate cause of the failure of the project (see

para. 516).

The present Tribunal also embraces this approach. At the time when the Romani Decree
and the Fourth Energy Account were adopted, i.e. in March and May 2011,
respectively, some aspects of Project Vega had already been realized, notably the
issuing of the Single Authorization in February 2011, but many others had not. While
contractors had been selected for the planned substations and PV plants and solar panels
had been acquired around the turn of the year 2010/2011 (see paras. 480-481), the

construction works had not yet begun, in spite of the Claimant’s submission that, under

its projected construction schedule, Project Vega would have mostly been completed
in 2011 and that it decided to accelerate the project (see para. 481; see notably

Cl. Memorial, paras. 163, 172).

The Tribunal acknowledges that the early end that the Romani Decree brought to the
Third Energy Account was certainly an unfortunate development from the point of view
of the Claimant. At the same time, while the FIT under the Third Energy Account were
not available due to the 31 May 2011 deadline, it seems that incentive tariffs under the
Fourth Energy Account should have been accessible for Project Vega, even if taking
into account that the specific modalities under which that energy account would operate
were not immediately known when the Romani Decree was adopted in March 2011.
They were only officially announced on 5 May 2011 (see para. 129), but were already
prepared for by a draft of the Fourth Energy Account issued by the Italian Government
on 19 April 2011 (Cl. Memorial, para. 201). If it is true, as expressly argued by the
Claimant (see para. 481), that it was prepared to mostly complete Project Vega in 2011,
it should have been able to complete and connect the PV plant to the grid by the 29
March 2012 cut-off date set by the Romani Decree for PV plants on agricultural land
with a construction permit predating the entry into force of the Romani Decree, as was
the applicable rule for Project Vega because of its Single Authorization of 3 February
2011 (see para. 127), even if taking into account a certain delay of some weeks due to

the adoption of the new rules.

To make use of the existing time window, it might have been necessary for the Claimant
to intensify its efforts to accelerate the construction of the PV plants (which was
apparently on the Claimant’s agenda anyway; see para. 481) and to familiarize itself
with the specific modalities of the incentivization regime under the Fourth Energy
Account, including the working of the registers administered by the GSE. The Tribunal
notes in this regard that twelve of the Claimant’s PV plants have managed to obtain FIT

under the Fourth Energy Account (see para. 132).

Yet, according to the Claimant’s own submissions (see para. 491), its board concluded
in May 2011 that it could not go forward with Project Vega in any variation and had no
choice but to abandon the project. This is certainly a legitimate decision for a
prospective investor to make, in particular if it concludes that any additional economic

input in order to accelerate the project does not make it profitable, and it is not for the

161

523.

524.

525.

Tribunal to second-guess such decision. At the same time, the prospective investor must
also bear the economic consequences flowing from its decision and cannot claim the
Respondent has become responsible for it, except if it can establish that the
Respondent’s adoption of the Romani Decree and the Fourth Energy Account are the

proximate cause of the failure of Project Vega.*!®

By addressing alternative scenarios, the Tribunal has already indicated that there would
have well been other ways for the Claimant to deal with the legal framework for
incentive payments, as modified by the Respondent in the spring of 2011. The fact that
the Claimant considered these alternatives as resulting in losses and took the
entrepreneurial decision of not pursuing a project deemed economically unviable
indicates, in the Tribunal’s view, quite the opposite of what the Claimant is called upon
to prove in order to substantiate its claim. It rather suggests that it was an active choice
of the Claimant not to take Project Vega further and that this choice took into account
several factors, with the adoption of the Romani Decree and the Fourth Energy Account
perhaps being the trigger, but in view of other intervening factors, not the proximate

cause of the project’s abandonment.

This result is corroborated by the Claimant’s own submission (Cl. Memorial, para. 198)
that, in the wake of the Respondent’s adoption of the new measures, AES Sole Italia
s.r.]. entered into negotiations with UBS and that UBS expressed interest in granting a
EUR 175 million loan. However, in view of the amount of the proposed fees and interest
rate as well as of the fact that UBS was not ready to lend the money without security
from AES Sole Italia s.r..’s parent companies,*'? both the AES Corporation and
Riverstone considered the deal too burdensome and eventually decided not to accept
these terms.*”° This indicates, in the Tribunal’s view, that the direct cause for the
abandonment of Project Vega was the inability of the Claimant to secure financing for

the project that it considered economically attractive.

In addition, the Tribunal observes that the Claimant (see para. 497) seems to accept that

smaller PV projects were still able to obtain financing even after the adoption of the

38 See in this regard e.g. Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts. Text and
Commentary, ILC Yearbook 2001, Vol. II, 30 (93) (CL-004).

Romani Decree and the Fourth Energy Account, so that these legal acts did not result
in the creation of a general deadlock for financing solar projects. Yet, the Claimant
maintains that this was still the case for larger PV projects such as Project Vega. The
Tribunal would note in this regard that it was the Claimant’s business choice to initiate
a (for the standards of the time very) large PV project in the first place. In view of the
modified legal situation, the Claimant pondered the possibility of reducing the project’s
size (see para. 490), but eventually decided against it. Once again, this is a legitimate
entrepreneurial choice for the Claimant to make, but the Tribunal cannot see how, on
this basis, a direct causal nexus can be construed between the Respondent’s adoption
of the Romani Decree and the Fourth Energy Account and Claimant’s decision to

abandon Project Vega.

In sum, the Tribunal considers that in the spring of 2011, when the Romani Decree and
the Fourth Energy Account were adopted, as stated in the Blusun v. Italy award, Project
Vega’s “success was by no means certain”.*”! In view of the various factors involved
and the Claimant’s own entrepreneurial decision-making in reaction to the decrees
adopted as well as the changes of behavior of banks and other business partners, the
Tribunal cannot see that the Claimant has successfully discharged its burden of proof
of establishing that its problems with obtaining financing for Project Vega were
sufficiently clearly linked to the adoption of the Romani Decree and the Fourth Energy
Account so as to qualify the latter as the proximate cause for Project Vega’s failure.
Hence, the Tribunal concludes that, in the absence of evidence establishing the
necessary causal nexus, the Respondent cannot be held responsible under international

law for the failure of Project Vega.

This finding suffices to reject the Claimant’s claim under Article 10(1), first and second
sentences, of the ECT regarding Project Vega as unfounded. Accordingly, there is no
need for the Tribunal to address the other submissions made by the Parties with respect

to Project Vega.

For the sake of completeness,*””

the Tribunal would, however, recall that Article 10(1),
first and second sentences, of the ECT, as has been analyzed previously (see paras. 423
et seq.), protects the Claimant from fundamental or radical modifications of the
applicable legal framework. To be sure, the Third Energy Account was supposed to
apply to PV plants connected to the grid by 31 December 2013 before the Romani
Decree limited its application to PV plants commencing operation by 31 May 2011 (see
paras. 125, 127). The Claimant (see para. 493) argues in this regard that the adoption
of the Romani Decree, and the ensuing reduction of the incentive tariff payments, the
restrictions for PV plants built on agricultural land and the establishment of the GSE
registers for which PV operators had to apply, marked a sudden, radical and
unforeseeable change in approach to PV plants’ eligibility to FIT, thus giving rise to a

breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard under the ECT.

The Tribunal does not agree with these arguments. Under the very regime of the Third
Energy Account (as well as the previous energy accounts), it was clear that PV
operators would not obtain access to FIT before the PV plant in question was completed
and connected to the grid. In view of the great dynamism in the renewable energy
market and the strong increase of PV operators acceding to incentive payments, a
reasonable and circumspect investor would not have relied on the Third Energy
Account remaining unchanged for three full years, but would have been prepared for
regulatory changes restricting the future access to FIT, notably with respect to (very)

large PV plant projects such as Project Vega.

In addition, efforts to avoid excessive reduction of agricultural land were also certainly
not unforeseeable for the reasonable and circumspect investor.*?> Moreover, the
differentiated legal regime, which the Fourth Energy Account applied in this regard,
contained, amongst others, an exception clause that still made access to FIT possible

for certain PV plant projects, if connected to the grid by 29 March 2012, and from which

322 Eskosol S.p.A. in liquidazione v. Italian Republic, \CSID Case No. ARB/15/50, Award, 4 September 2020,
para. 380 (RL-051) focuses on this aspect as the “issue of causation logically becomes relevant only if a breach
of duty is first shown. If a State has not violated its treaty obligations with respect to a particular investor and
investment, then it does not matter what consequences the State’s non-wrongful action may have had for a
particular business project”. Since the tribunal concludes that Italy did not violate its treaty obligations (see ibid.,
para. 489), it saw no need to look into the causation issue.

323 See Eskosol S.p.A. in liquidazione v. Italian Republic, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/50, Award, 4 September 2020,
paras. 419 et seq. (RL-051).

533.

Project Vega could have profited.*** This indicates that the measures adopted were not

disproportionate in nature.

Accordingly, in the Tribunal’s view, the adoption of the Romani Decree and the Fourth
Energy Account cannot be considered a fundamental or radical change to the detriment
of the Claimant with respect to Project Vega, even less when taking into account that,
differently from the situation regarding the Spalma-incentivi Decree (see VI.C.) where
the Claimant had already acceded to a specific FIT regime by virtue of completing the
PV plants in question and connecting them to the grid, here the Tribunal is dealing with
a project where the actual construction had not even begun. In this regard, the Tribunal
recalls the finding which the CEF v. /taly tribunal made in distinguishing the Blusun v.
Italy case from the situation before it and which the present Tribunal deems to also
apply to Project Vega, namely that the Claimant was “still at a preliminary stage of its

attempts to invest in the Italian photovoltaic market”.*?>

(3) Conclusion

For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant has not successfully
discharged its burden of proof of establishing that its problems with obtaining financing
for Project Vega were sufficiently linked to the adoption of the Romani Decree and the
Fourth Energy Account so as to create the necessary causal nexus and to make the
Respondent responsible under international law for the failure of Project Vega. Hence,

the Tribunal rejects the Claimant’s claim.

THE FROSINONE PLANTS AND THE ADOPTION OF THE FIFTH ENERGY ACCOUNT
qd) The Parties’ Positions

a. Claimant’s Position
The Claimant argues that in late September/early October 2011, it decided to invest in
the Cangiano and Santa Maria projects, located in the Italian Province of Frosinone (the
so-called “Frosinone plants”). These projects involved the construction of two PV

plants, each of them with a peak power slightly below 5 MW (Cl. Memorial, para. 111).

According to the Claimant, at the time of the investment decision, the Frosinone plants

34 See ibid., paras. 412 et seq.

were anticipated to cost approximately EUR 26 million to be put into place*?® (Cl.

Memorial, para. 350; Cl. Reply, paras. 183, 187; Cl. PHB, para. 101).

The Claimant further submits that its board based its investment decision on the Fourth
Energy Account (see para. 129), which was published on 5 May 2011°” and the content
of which the Claimant describes as follows: this energy account applied to PV plants
entering into operation between 1 June 2011 and 31 December 2016 and offered FIT
depending on the date when a PV plant entered into service. In particular, there were to
be several windows during which producers could apply to GSE registers in order to
gain access to incentive payments in 2011 and 2012.*?* Producers could apply to be
included in the registers before PV plants entered into operation, although this entailed
a lower ranking.*”’ Registration was not required to gain access to FIT in 2013 or
later.**° Moreover, the owners of large plants that entered into service before 31
December 2012 were entitled to have access to the 2013 incentive payments, with the
date of entry into service and the FIT to be memorialized by contract.**! In addition,
the 2011 and 2012 feed-in premiums were subject to national indicative cost targets**?
and the Fourth Energy Account itself was subject to an indicative target of about 23
GW of incentivized capacity or EUR 6 to 7 billion of incentive payments** (Cl.
Memorial, paras. 112, 114-115).

The Claimant further contends that, at the time when it decided to invest in the
Frosinone plants, the GSE had provided no guidance to investors on when the
aforementioned cost limits would be reached*** (Cl. Memorial, para. 114; Cl. Reply,
para. 189). In particular, the Claimant submits that there is no support for the
Respondent’s contention (see para. 558) that its cost commitments under the Fourth

Energy Account could be monitored daily through the GSE website, even though the

burden to prove the assertion that the GSE published the relevant cost data falls upon

the Respondent.

According to the Claimant, the Respondent presents no contemporaneous documents
such as excerpts from the GSE website dating back to the last semester or quarter of
2011, but only documents dating from 2013.**> Despite the evidence produced during
the closing statement on the final day of the Hearing on the Merits (Tr. 26 September
2019, 92:16-22 [Legum]), the Respondent has failed to prove the fact it relies on. The
Respondent’s position on exactly how often (daily, weekly, monthly) and when the PV
counter was updated remains unclear. The only contemporaneous screenshots produced
by the Respondent confirm that the counter was activated on 19 October 2011,7*° while
the documents referenced from 2012, 2013, 2015 and 2016 provide imprecise
statements whose exact relationship to the Respondent’s case remains unclear. In any
event, as emphasized by the Claimant, the new evidence confirms that as of 1 May
2012, just one week before the connection of the second of the two Frosinone plants to
the grid, the total cumulative cost figure published by the GSE was about EUR 5.65
billion*” and therefore still well short of the lower end of the indicative target (Cl.

Reply, paras. 190-193; Cl. PHB, paras. 111-117; Cl. Reply PHB, paras. 29-32).

The Claimant argues that, against this regulatory background, it planned to finish the
Frosinone plants in time to qualify for the FIT of EUR 181 per MWh for plants entering
into service in December 20117** or for the premium of EUR 156 per MWh for plants
entering into service in the first half of 2012.°* At the very least, as the Claimant
submits, the PV plants were expected to be commissioned in the first half of 2013 which
would have led to a comprehensive FIT including the market price of electricity of

EUR 205 per MWh*? (Cl. Memorial, paras. 113-114; Cl. PHB, paras. 101-102).

According to the Claimant, its subsidiary ASI Frosinone s.r.l. applied to the GSE

register at the first opportunity following the Claimant’s acquisition of the rights to the

335 Letter from Italy to Silver Ridge Power BV, 26 February 2013, 1 (R-026).

Frosinone plants, i.e. between 1 and 30 November 2011.4! As predicted by the
Claimant, the December 2011 GSE register did not rank the plants in a position that
would qualify them for 2011 or early 2012 incentives.*4* The Claimant contends,
however, that it had multiple other opportunities under the Fourth Energy Account to
apply to the GSE registers or, at a minimum, to accede to the 2013 tariff (Cl. Memorial,
para. 115; Cl. Reply, paras. 196-197).

539. The Claimant further argues that only on 20 January 2012 did the GSE issue a press
release communicating that the cost limit for large plants (such as the Frosinone plants)
had been reached for all of 2012 and, therefore, there would be no GSE register for the
second half of 2012.3 This meant that some EUR 580 million had been committed to
the plants already registered.*+ According to the Claimant, this came as a surprise as
there was no way to know that the targets for 2012 would be reached so early

(Cl. Memorial, para. 116).

540. However, as the Claimant submits, under the Fourth Energy Account it remained
entitled to access to the 2013 tariff if the plants were brought into service before 31
December 2012. Against this background, the construction of the Frosinone plants was
completed and they went into operation on 7 March 2012 and 9 May 2012,
respectively,**° i.e. while the Fourth Energy Account was still in force. Under the GSE
rules implementing the Fourth Energy Account, the PV plants were entitled to access
the 2013 FIT, but the respective application had to be filed as from 1 January 2013, not
before*4® (Cl. Memorial, paras. 117, 350).

541. On 5 July 2012, the Respondent adopted the Fifth Energy Account (see para. 133). The
Claimant argues that this measure drastically reduced FIT for plants exceeding 1 MW
in capacity and that the Respondent, in addition, applied the Fifth Energy Account to
PV plants which, like the Frosinone plants, had been constructed and brought into
service before the Fifth Energy Account’s entry into force and which were otherwise

entitled to access the FIT for 2013 under the Fourth Energy Account. In particular,

according to the Claimant, unlike the Fourth Energy Account’s provisions for fixed
payments per kWh in addition to the market price of electricity, the Fifth Energy
Account provided only for variable payments representing the difference between a
nominal minimum price and the market price. In effect, the Fifth Energy Account
therefore only guaranteed a minimum price for electricity fed into the grid, with this
347

minimum price being EUR 107 per MWh in the case of the Frosinone plants
(Cl. Memorial, paras. 118-119).

Moreover, as the Claimant further contends, the Fifth Energy Account required all
renewable energy producers benefiting from any energy account to reduce the
incentives received to account for a newly invented administrative fee of
EUR 0.0005/kWh starting on 1 January 2013,** thus negatively affecting all of the
Claimant’s PV plants in Italy.*#? Furthermore, on 1 January 2015, the calculation
method for the fee was changed by virtue of the Spalma-incentivi Decree (see
para. 138), which according to the Claimant approximately doubled the fee
(Cl. Memorial, para. 120; Cl. Reply, paras. 224-225).

Moreover, the Claimant argues that, as a consequence of the Respondent’s measures,
the profitability of the Frosinone plants was eliminated since the revenues provided by
the Fifth Energy Account did not even permit for the Claimant’s investment to be
recovered. In sum, the Frosinone plants do therefore not provide any benefit to the

Claimant, and never have (Cl. Memorial, para. 121).

On this basis, the Claimant claims a threefold violation of the Respondent’s obligations

under the ECT.

First, the Claimant submits that, when it made its investment in the Frosinone plants, it
reasonably expected that these plants would benefit from incentives under the Fourth
Energy Account. The sudden and unpredictable enactment of the Fifth Energy Account,
however, compromised these plants’ profitability and stripped the Claimant of any
benefit from its investment. According to the Claimant, the profoundly unfair and

inequitable character of the Respondent’s measures failed to ensure stability and

8 See Article 10(4) of the Fifth Energy Account (CL-082).

548.

transparency of the legal framework since the change from the Fourth to the Fifth
Energy Account altered the essential characteristics of the incentives regime, and
violated the Claimant’s legitimate expectations regarding the Frosinone plants. From
the Claimant’s perspective, the promises under the Fourth Energy Account gave rise to
the reasonable and justified expectation that the Frosinone plants, when built and
connected under the Fourth Energy Account, would receive the FIT applicable under
that account (Request, para. 54; Cl. Memorial, paras. 344-347, Cl. Reply, para. 184;
Cl. PHB, paras. 95, 97, 100).

In this regard, the Claimant rejects the Respondent’s argument (see para. 555) that the
change from the Fourth to the Fifth Energy Account was foreseeable and transparent
and that no legitimate expectation could have been created on the maintenance of tariffs
under the Fourth Energy Account because it was known that the duration of that energy
account would depend on reaching certain levels of investment. According to the
Claimant, the Fourth Energy Account only set an indicative target, but did not fix a
threshold based on the disbursement of a certain amount of incentives or provide for an
automatic cut-off upon attainment of the threshold. In addition, at the time of making
the investment for the Frosinone plants, the GSE had not provided any guidance to

investors on when the capacity or cost limits would be reached (see para. 535).

Moreover, the Claimant insists that it did everything it reasonably could to monitor the
situation under the Fourth Energy Account (Tr. 24 September 2019, 20:21-21:6
[Hunt]). Based on the information available to it when making the investment decision
for the Frosinone plants, the Claimant considered it reasonable to assume that the
installed capacity was well below the total threshold of 23 GW envisaged under the
Fourth Energy Account and that the corresponding cost of incentives would therefore
be far removed from the total cost target of EUR 6 to 7 billion*° (Cl. Reply, paras. 188-
189, 193; Cl. PHB, paras. 104, 107-108; Cl. PHB, para. 118; Cl. Reply PHB, para. 33).

The Claimant further rejects the Respondent’s argument (see para. 556) that the
Claimant did not qualify for the Fourth Energy Account because it had made the
business choice to wait and take the risk that in the meantime thresholds would be

reached. The contemporaneous documents show that the Claimant made its investment

550.

decision because the Fourth Energy Account provided for automatic access to 2013
tariff rates without registration prior to the plants’ entry into service. It only required
that the plants to go into operation before the end of 2012 and that an application be
filed on or after 1 January 2013. According to the Claimant, it was only due to the Fifth
Energy Account’s adoption on 5 July 2012 that the 2013 incentives under the Fourth
Energy Account became unavailable to the Frosinone plants. Thus, the Claimant made
no decision whatsoever to wait, but it was the Respondent’s adoption of the Fifth
Energy Account that frustrated the Claimant’s legitimate expectations with respect to

the Frosinone plants (Cl. Reply, paras. 196-200).

Secondly, the Claimant contends that the Frosinone plants were subjected to measures
having effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation in the meaning of
Article 13(1) of the ECT and that they do not fall within any of the exceptions defined
in subparagraphs a) through d) of that provision. In particular, after these plants were
fully constructed and were providing electricity to the grid, the Respondent replaced
the Fourth Energy Account with the Fifth Energy Account, thus abandoning the fixed
FIT and instead putting into place a price-support mechanism that only paid the
difference between the market price for electricity and a specified nominal amount.
According to the Claimant, this measure applied retroactively to plants built and entered
into service in reliance on the previous incentive regime. As the revenues under the
Fifth Energy Account are insufficient to offset the cost of acquiring, constructing and
putting into service the Frosinone plants, they cannot generate a positive return for the
Claimant. The measures’ retroactive character combined with their interference with
distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations thus resulted, in the Claimant’s
submission, in the transfer of wealth from PV investors to the Italian administration,
thus confirming the expropriatory character of these measures (Cl. Memorial, paras. 33,

348-354; Cl. PHB, para. 119).

The Claimant further submits that there can be no doubt that the adoption of the Fifth
Energy Account dramatically decreased the value of the Frosinone plants. The fact that
the plants were later sold to a third party does not prove that they were profitable, but
the transaction rather highlights the magnitude of the Claimant’s economic loss, with
the price paid representing only a small fraction of the cost to build the plants

(Cl. Reply, paras. 206-215; Cl. PHB, para. 122).

171

551.

552.

553.

In addition, the Claimant contends that the Respondent’s argument that there is no need
to compensate the Claimant since the Fifth Energy Account falls under the definition
of a regulatory taking, must fail. According to the Claimant, the Fifth Energy Account
is not a regulatory measure as it does not address public welfare objectives such as
public health, safety and the environment, which are characteristic of regulatory
measures, and in any event, a State’s compensation obligation remains, even if
regulatory action is at issue. In particular, the ECT does not provide any exception for
a regulatory taking. Moreover, there is no consensus among arbitral tribunals that a
State may escape its compensation obligation just because it deems its taking
“regulatory”. Hence, the Claimant insists that it is entitled to full compensation for the

indirect expropriation of the Frosinone plants (Cl. Reply, paras. 216-222).

Thirdly, the Claimant argues that the Fifth Energy Account failed to observe the
Respondent’s obligations with respect to 23 of the 25 plants by unilaterally reducing
the incentive payments to compensate for a newly invented GSE administrative fee and
by increasing this fee subsequently by virtue of the Spalma-incentivi Decree. In so
doing, the Respondent effectively modified each of the GSE conventions under the
Second, Third and Fourth Energy Accounts, although none of them provided for such
a deduction from the incentives paid. The Claimant further submits in this regard that
this unilateral deduction from the incentive payments also violated the Claimant’s
legitimate expectations that the Respondent would respect its promises in the energy
accounts to pay a precisely stated rate as an incentive for renewable energy, thus
resulting in a breach of the Respondent’s obligations under the last and the second
sentences of Article 10(1) of the ECT (Cl. Memorial, paras. 355-358; Cl. Reply,
paras. 223, 227-231).

b. Respondent’s Position

With respect to the Claimant’s investment in the Frosinone plants, the Respondent
argues that it has already addressed this issue in its letter of 26 February 2013,**! sent
in response to the Claimant’s Amicable Letter dating from 21 December 2012.°°? In

this letter, the Respondent claims to have indicated to the Claimant that the Fourth

dispute, 21 December 2012 (C-001).

Energy Account had fixed a threshold of EUR 6 billion, calling for the adoption of a
new energy account once the threshold was exceeded. The Respondent also indicated
in that letter that the Fourth Energy Account provided for the publication on the GSE
website of the cumulative indicative annual cost of the incentives and that this provision
was promptly implemented by the GSE which updated its website on a daily basis.
Thus, contrary to what the Claimant states, the passage from the Fourth to the Fifth
Energy Account was foreseeable for reasonable investors (Resp. Counter-Memorial,

paras. 296-299, 517).

The Respondent further claims that, given the terms of the Fourth Energy Account, the
Claimant was aware of the possibility of not being included in the register in a position
useful to the admission to the incentive payments. In addition, according to the
Respondent, the possibility of not opening the second register of 2012 was known to
the operators since this was expressly provided for in the Fourth Energy Account.
Hence, the Claimant invested in the Frosinone plants while accepting the risk that the
incentives allocated under the Fourth Energy Account would be exhausted due to the
achievement of the cost limits set in that energy account and that the legislator could
intervene to modify the tariffs to be paid to PV plants (Resp. Counter-Memorial,

para. 299; Resp. Reply PHB, paras. 38, 40).

Against this background, the Respondent contends that no legitimate expectations
could have been created that the FIT under the Fourth Energy Account be maintained,
since it was known that that energy account’s duration would depend on reaching
certain levels of disbursement of incentive payments (Resp. Counter-Memorial,
para. 518; Resp. Rejoinder, paras. 370, 533-534; Resp. Reply PHB, para. 33). In the
Respondent’s view, the passage from the Fourth to the Fifth Energy Account was
always justified by the achievement of the indicated targets and thresholds, was
predictable and transparently realized and contemplated safeguard measures to permit

a smooth change (Resp. Reply PHB, paras. 32, 35).

According to the Respondent, it was due to the Claimant’s business choice that the
Frosinone plants did not profit from FIT under the Fourth Energy Account. Had the
Claimant managed to qualify for the incentive regime already by the end of 2011, it
would have surely been admitted to the rates under that energy account. In the

Respondent’s view, the Claimant’s decision to wait and take the risk that meanwhile

173

557.

558.

559.

 
 

the relevant threshold would be reached, was a business choice that cannot be imputed
to the Respondent. After all, twelve out of the 25 plants of the Claimant did apply and

could benefit from the Fourth Energy Account (Resp. Counter-Memorial, para. 519).

Moreover, the Respondent argues that the Claimant’s assertion that there was no way
to know that the targets for 2012 would be reached so early is contradicted by the fact
that, through the photovoltaic counter, it was possible for the investors to monitor the

costs of the PV system (Resp. Rejoinder, para. 543).

The Respondent notably submits with respect to the Claimant’s contention that the GSE
website was not updated regularly (see para. 535) that, on 19 October 2011, the GSE
published on its website, within the “Photovoltaic” section, the value of indicative
annual costs of incentives for each energy account.** There the contents of the GSE
database were explained and it was stated that on that date around 288,000 plants were
in operation, corresponding to an installed power of over 11,100 MW and total
cumulative costs of approximately EUR 4.9 billion per year*+ (Resp. Rejoinder,
paras. 534-535). Furthermore, the Respondent relies on two decisions of the Lazio

Regional Administrative Tribunal,3>

according to which it was undisputed that the
operators were informed through the so-called photovoltaic counter (“contatore
fotovoltaico”) of the number of plants that progressively gained access to the
incentives, as well as on the decisions of the Italian Consiglio di Stato confirming the
aforementioned decisions*° (Resp. Rejoinder, paras. 541-542; Resp. PHB, paras. 71-

79).

In addition, as concerns the claim that the Frosinone plants had been constructed and
brought into service before the entry into force of the Fifth Energy Account, thus
creating a retroactive effect (see paras. 541, 549), the Respondent submits that,
according to the GSE Implementing Rules for the Fourth Energy Account, for PV plants

such as the Frosinone plants, the relevant date to qualify for the obtainment of the

incentive payments (and therefore for the determination of the applicable tariff) was
not the date of the plant’s entry into operation, but the first day of the semester in which
the request was filed at the GSE. Hence, the fact that the Frosinone plants went into
service between March and May 2012 is not relevant for the acquisition of the right to
obtain the incentive. This is not problematic if one considers that the Fourth Energy
Account expressly provided for a cumulative cost limit that, if exceeded, would lead to

the adoption of a new energy account (Resp. Rejoinder, paras. 546-547).

Furthermore, the Respondent rejects the second claim regarding the Frosinone plants,
i.e. that of indirect expropriation. According to the Respondent, the Claimant cannot
establish that there has been a concrete and substantial deprivation of the Claimant’s
assets. In particular, in order to establish an (indirect) expropriation, it is not sufficient
to state that a host State measure has reduced expected incomes, but the operation and
the profitability of the asset must have been severely compromised. Furthermore,
according to news reports, the Frosinone plants were sold to Cubico Sustainable
Investments; if this is true, they must be considered to be profitable. Moreover, even
assuming for the sake of argument that there was a significant damage, the Claimant
cannot prove a causal link between such alleged damage and the Respondent’s acts,
since the lack of obtainment of the incentives must be ascribed to the Claimant, who
should have been aware of the reaching of the thresholds of the Fourth Energy Account
and the consequent passage to the Fifth Energy Account (Resp. Counter-Memorial,

paras. 521-533; Resp. Rejoinder, paras. 371, 551-558).

In this regard, the Respondent further contends that it is accepted in investment law
doctrine and caselaw that in case of regulatory takings, which, though interfering with
the investment, are adopted in a non-discriminatory manner and which aim at generally
regulating a matter of public interest, no compensation is required. According to the
Respondent, the energy accounts squarely fall into this definition of regulatory takings
since the ministerial decrees instituting the energy accounts all constitute general
measures having a regulatory nature. Moreover, they did not entail any discrimination
between Italian and foreign investors. The public interest underlying the energy
accounts is also evident, given the fact that they are designed in a logic of reasonable
balance of costs to promote renewable energy, as part of a broader regulatory

framework dictated by the EU. Moreover, they seek to take into account the need to

175

562.

563.

564.

avoid excessive reduction of agricultural land. Hence, according to the Respondent,
there was no violation of Article 13 of the ECT with respect to the Frosinone plants

(Resp. Counter-Memorial, paras. 534-542).

Thirdly, the Respondent also objects to the claim that the imposition by the Fifth Energy
Account of an administrative fee on all PV energy producers to cover GSE costs that
were previously imposed on the final users violated Article 10(1), last sentence, of the
ECT. In particular, the Respondent emphasizes how limited the cost of the fee is, i.e.
EUR 0.0005 per kWh, which is approximately 0.15 % of the average of the incentive
tariffs, thus an extremely reasonable amount for the activity of the GSE. In this regard,
the possibility of off-setting the administrative fee with the amount of incentives
payments due by the GSE is merely a modality to collect fees and does not interfere
with any contractual obligations (Resp. Counter-Memorial, paras. 543-548;

Resp. Rejoinder, 574-576).

The Respondent further submits that the introduction of the GSE administrative fee
does not constitute a violation of the Claimant’s legitimate expectations since the
Respondent never affirmed or made investors believe that it would not impose any new
fiscal measures or any fees on administrative costs. In particular, neither the energy
accounts nor the GSE conventions expressly stated that administrative fees would be
zero. In the Respondent’s view, the silence of the law was not sufficient to create in
foreign investors a legitimate expectation that an existing regulatory situation would be
maintained because otherwise the fair and equitable treatment clause would be
transformed into a general clause freezing regulatory activity of a State (Resp. Counter-

Memorial, para. 549; Resp. Rejoinder, 563-573).

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Claimant’s claim regarding the impact of the Respondent’s adoption of the Fifth
Energy Account on the Frosinone plants is framed in terms of Article 10(1), first,
second and last sentences, of the ECT (see paras. 365, 389) as well as of Article 13 of
the ECT, which reads in relevant part:
(1) Investments of Investors of a Contracting Party in the Area of any other
Contracting Party shall not be nationalized, expropriated or subjected to a

measure or measures having effect equivalent to nationalization or
expropriation [...].

176

565.

566.

567.

568.

The Tribunal will address the fair and equitable treatment claim (a.) and the indirect
expropriation claim (b.) regarding the Frosinone Plants as well as the further claim of a
breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard and of the umbrella clause of the
ECT due to the introduction of an administrative management fee by virtue of the Fifth
Energy Account and its subsequent modification by the Spalma-incentivi Decree (c.) in

turn.

 

a. The fair and equitable tr claim r ding the Frosi plants

The Claimant argues that, when it made its investment in the Frosinone plants, it had
the reasonable and justified expectation that these plants, when built and connected,
would receive the incentive tariffs under the Fourth Energy Account. The sudden and
unpredictable enactment of the Fifth Energy Account, however, altered the essential
characteristics of the incentives regime and therefore violated the Claimant’s legitimate
expectations regarding the Frosinone plants, thus violating Article 10(1), first and

second sentences, of the ECT (see para. 545).

It has remained undisputed between the Parties that the Cangiano and Santa Maria
projects (i.e. the two Frosinone plants) have a capacity of 4.836 and 4.997 MW and,
after the relevant construction works had been completed, went into operation on 27
March 2012 and 9 May 2012, respectively (see para. 110). Furthermore, the Fourth
Energy Account, when adopted on 5 May 2011, was supposed to apply to PV plants
entering into operation between 1 June 2011 and 31 December 2016 (see para. 129).3°7
Yet, on 5 July 2012, the Fifth Energy Account (see para. 133) was adopted and entered
into force on the day following its publication in the Official Gazette of the Italian
Republic on 10 July 2012. According to the terms of the Fifth Energy Account, a limited
scope of application (e.g. for small plants) remained for the Fourth Energy Account,**
but the Frosinone plants were not covered by it and they therefore fell under the regime

of the Fifth Energy Account (see para. 135).

Against this background, the Claimant rightly argues that at the moment when the
Frosinone plants went into operation, the Fourth Energy Account was in force and that

the Fifth Energy Account was only published and entered into force approximately

357 See Article 20(2) of the Fourth Energy Account (CL-081).
388 See Article 1(4) of the Fifth Energy Account (CL-082).

177

569.

570.

3 1/2 and 2 months after the respective Frosinone plants’ connection to the grid. This
timeline certainly distinguishes the present set of facts from that which the Tribunal
examined in the previous section where the actual construction of the Project Vega
plant had not even begun when the regime existing under the Third Energy Account

was modified by the Romani Decree and the Fourth Energy Account (see para. 531).

At the same time, the situation also differs from the Spalma-incentivi Decree which
also affected PV plants that had already acceded to a specific FIT regime (see paras. 138
et seq.). This is not the case with respect to the Frosinone plants. At the time of the
adoption and entry into force of the Fifth Energy Account, the Frosinone plants had not
yet been admitted to incentive payments under the Fourth Energy Account; in particular
the pertinent GSE tariff recognition letters and GSE conventions for the Cangiano and

Santa Maria plants had not yet been issued.*°°

Nonetheless, the Claimant contends that it had the legitimate expectation that the plants,
once built and connected to the grid, would receive FIT under the Fourth, and not the
Fifth Energy Account. The Tribunal would recall in this regard that the GSE tariff
recognition letters and the GSE conventions are not decisive for the assessment of the
legitimate expectations of the Claimant (see paras. 427-428). Insofar as the Claimant
can rely on legitimate expectations in the present case, they can only be based upon the
pertinent legislative decrees, i.e. Legislative Decree No. 387/2003 and the Romani
Decree in combination with the pertinent administrative decrees, in particular the
Fourth Energy Account. The Tribunal has already identified the relevant features of the
Italian regime for the incentivization of renewable energy above and has concluded that
the Claimant could rely on the overall integrity of this incentivization system and could
therefore expect to be protected against fundamental or radical changes of this system,
but had to be prepared for certain, non-radical modifications of the applicable legal
framework (see paras. 424 et seq.). This also holds true with regard to the Claimant’s
claim regarding the Frosinone plants inasmuch as it is based on Article 10(1), first and

second sentences, of the ECT.2

359 See Agreements for the Payment of Subsidized Rates for Electricity produced by Photovoltaic Conversion
from a Solar Source, 1 August 2013 (C-068).

3 As regards the indirect expropriation claim see paras. 608 et seq.

178

S71.

572.

573.

574.

Furthermore, when assessing whether the Respondent frustrated this legitimate
expectation by adopting the Fifth Energy Account, the Tribunal recalls that, in order to
strike the proper balance between the Claimant’s interest in the stability of the
legislative and regulatory framework and the Respondent’s right to adapt it to new
developments, three factors are to be taken into account, namely whether the adopted

measures were (i) reasonable, (ii) foreseeable and (iii) proportionate (see para. 446).

(i) Reasonableness

In terms of reasonableness, i.e. whether or not the modifications brought about by the
Fifth Energy Account could draw on a public policy purpose, the Tribunal refers to its
analysis above which is also applicable in the present context (see paras. 447 et seq.).*°!
Thus, the Tribunal is satisfied that the Respondent, when adopting the Fifth Energy
Account, could plausibly claim to act on the basis of legitimate public policy objectives,
notably strengthening the sustainability of the incentive tariff scheme for renewable

energy in a situation of economic difficulty.

(ii) Foreseeability
As regards, secondly, the question of whether the changes brought about by the Fifth
Energy Account could have been expected by the Claimant, the Tribunal takes note of
the Claimant’s submission that, while in the previous energy accounts, the date of entry
into operation of a PV plant was decisive for its access to incentive payments, the Fifth
Energy Account modified this system. The Tribunal considers, however, that this aspect

calls for further analysis.

Pursuant to Article 6(2) of the Fourth Energy Account, “large plants that come into
operation by 31 August 2011 have direct access to the feed-in tariffs, without prejudice
to the obligation to communicate to the GSE of the plant’s commissioning within 15
calendar days from this date”.** In view of the fact that “large plants” essentially meant
PV plants having a capacity of more than | MW*® (see para. 129) and that the two
Frosinone plants thus qualified as large plants, they would have indeed had access to

FIT under the Fourth Energy Account, had they come into operation 7 or 8.5 months

361 See also Recitals 13 et seq. of the Fifth Energy Account (CL-082).
362 Article 6(2) of the Fourth Energy Account (CL-081).
363 See also Article 3(1)(u) and (v) of the Fourth Energy Account (CL-081).

576.

577.

earlier, ie. before the 31 August 2011 deadline (not considering for the moment that

the adoption of the Fifth Energy Account modified this deadline).

However, already the Fourth Energy Account provided for a modified regime for large

plants not covered by Article 6(2). According to Article 6(3),

[flor the years 2011 and 2012, the large plants that are not covered by
subparagraph 2, can access feed-in tariffs if they satisfy both of the following
additional conditions:

a) the plant has been entered into the register pursuant to Art. 8 in such a
position as to be within the specific cost limits defined for each of the
reference periods mentioned in Art. 4, paragraph 2. To this end, the cost
limit for 2011 is inclusive of the costs related to the promotion of large
plants that entered into operation by 31 August 2011. If all incentive costs
for the large plants that entered into operation by 31 August 2011 and
that entered into the register pursuant to Art. 8 for the year 2011 exceed
the limit of expected cost for the same period, the excess cost will reduce
the cost limit for the second half of 2012;

b

the certificate of work completion regarding the plant is to be sent to GSE
within seven months from the date of publication of the ranking pursuant

to Art. 8, paragraph 3; the above term is increased to nine months for
plants generating power greater than 1 MW.

It was therefore clear from the adoption of the Fourth Energy Account that, in order for
large PV plants with a date of entry into operation after 31 August 2011 — such as the
Frosinone plants — to have access to FIT under that energy account, it was a constitutive
requirement, over and above the plant’s entry into operation, that it be included in the
GSE register in an appropriate position. As can be seen from the above-quoted
provision, the Fourth Energy Account contained a differentiated regime in this regard
which is further detailed in Article 8 (“Enrollment in the register for large plants”),
providing for several periods of enrollment in 2011 and 2012 (see para. 130). In
particular, the question of whether and to what extent further periods of enrollment in
the register were to be reopened, depended on whether there was further availability
within the semi-annual cost limits laid down in Article 4(2) of the Fourth Energy

Account.3

Hence, producers who sought to qualify for FIT under the Fourth Energy Account with

a PV plant project that was to enter into operation after 31 August 2011 (as is the case

364 See in particular Article 8(2) in conjunction with Article 4(2) of the Fourth Energy Account (CL-081).

180

578.

here, as evidenced by the Claimant’s own submission regarding the decision to invest
having been taken in late September/early October 2011; see para. 533), were aware
that the possibility of doing so depended on obtaining a promising ranking in the
register for large plants. This in turn depended on the development of the market, in
particular on the number and size of PV projects with a better ranking that had
successfully qualified for access to incentive payments. Article 6(3)(a) of the Fourth
Energy Account leaves no doubt that, if the incentive cost for (i) the large plants that
entered into operation by 31 August 2011 and (ii) those that entered into the register
pursuant to Article 8 for the year 2011 exceeds the limit of expected cost for the same
period (i.e. an installed capacity of 1,200 MW, corresponding to a cost threshold of
EUR 300 million*®), the excess cost would reduce the cost limit for the second half of
2012. This signifies, and was evident also for PV producers, that a very active market
in the first months of operation of the Fourth Energy Account would imply more limited
possibilities to accede to FIT for those PV plants meeting the requirements set by the
Fourth Energy Account only at a later stage. This particularly holds true with respect to
the Frosinone plants since the Claimant was well aware that, while applying to the GSE
register in November 2011, “the plants did not qualify in a position granting access to
the tariff, because of their early stage of development”,*® that “the registration required
for the 2011 or 2012 tariffs was unlikely because there was ‘a large backlog of plants

with very old permit dates’”,>*”

and that because of a transgression of the applicable
cost limits, the register for large plants might not be reopened for the second half of
2012 (see para. 589), thus leaving the Claimant only with the option of acceding to the

2013 tariff (see paras. 581 et seq.).

This result is not called into question by Article 6(4) of the Fourth Energy Account
according to which “[iJn all cases, the payable feed-in tariff is the one existing at the
date of entry into operation of the plant”. This only means that under paragraph 2 as
well as paragraph 3 of Article 6 (see paras. 574-575), i.e. in “all cases”, the amount of

the FIT to be granted to the PV producer would be the one existing at the date of the

865 See Article 4(2) of the Fourth Energy Account, Table 1.1 (“1/06/2011-31/12/2011”) (CL-081).

580.

respective plant’s entry into operation, but only if the requirements, set by Article 6(3)

as to whether the respective PV plant qualified for FIT in the first place, were met.

Thus, already the Fourth Energy Account, on which the Claimant seeks to base its
legitimate expectations (see para. 545), provided for a differentiated regime that made
the date of entry into operation a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for the access
of large plants such as the Frosinone plants to FIT under that energy account. In this
context, the Tribunal recalls its observation, made with respect to the changes brought
about by the Spalma-incentivi Decree and their relevance for the Claimant’s legitimate
expectations (see para. 456), that at no moment in time was the energy accounts’
approach of applying the reduced incentives only to newly admitted PV plants part and
parcel of the investor’s legitimate expectations. For the reasons explained before, the
Tribunal considers this reasoning to apply also and with even greater force in the

present context.

Indeed, nowhere in the pertinent legislative acts or administrative decrees is there a
guarantee or promise that a PV plant would have access to FIT exclusively depending
on the date of its completion or entry into operation. To the contrary, it has become
clear that the Fourth Energy Account provided for a differentiated regime for large
plants entering into operation after 31 August 2011 (such as the Frosinone plants) which
made FIT access additionally dependent on an appropriate ranking in the register.
Hence, the admission of PV plants to the energy account in force at the moment of entry
into operation of the respective plant under earlier energy accounts (a system already
considerably modified by the Fourth Energy Account) must not be confounded with a
legal guarantee on the part of the Respondent that, at the moment when a PV plant
enters into operation, it will have access to FIT under the energy account in force. Such
immunization of the status quo from following modifications would require a
stabilization or freezing clause which cannot be found anywhere in the pertinent
legislative or regulatory acts. As demonstrated in the previous paragraph, rather the
opposite holds true for the Fourth Energy Account. Hence, the Claimant could not have
a legitimate expectation protected under the fair and equitable treatment clause of the
ECT that the Frosinone plants would accede to FIT under the Fourth Energy Account
solely by virtue of the fact that they entered into operation at a moment when the Fourth

Energy Account was in force.

182

581.

583.

584.

The question remains whether it was foreseeable for the Claimant that the Frosinone
plants would not be able to accede to the Fourth Energy Account at all, even not to the
2013 tariff, which was due to the early termination of that energy account (originally
planned to apply to PV plants entering into operation between 1 June 2011 and 31
December 2016; see para. 129) by the adoption of the Fifth Energy Account. In the
Claimant’s view, this question becomes even more urgent in view of the fact that the
Fifth Energy Account was only adopted and entered into force in July 2012, i.e. at a

moment in time when the Frosinone plants had already entered into operation.

To begin with, the Tribunal observes that the reduction of the incentivization period of
one energy account by the adoption of its successor was not new. As already discussed
in the context of the Project Vega claim (see paras. 528 et seq.), the very Fourth Energy
Account on which the Claimant seeks to base its legitimate expectations regarding the
Frosinone plants (see para. 545), shortened the originally envisaged end-date for the
application of the Third Energy Account, i.e. 31 December 2013, to 31 May 2011.
Accordingly, the very genesis of the Fourth Energy Account had made the investor

community familiar with this mechanism.

Moreover, a further characteristic feature of the Fourth Energy Account was that it
introduced an indicative target of installed power at the national level of about 23 GW,
which corresponded to an indicative cumulative cost of incentives estimated to be
between EUR 6 and 7 billion*® (see para. 131). In addition, Article 2(3) of the Fourth
Energy Account stated that, upon reaching the lower level of the annual cumulative cost
value, the incentive arrangements referred to in the Fourth Energy Account may be
revised by decree of the Minister of Economic Development in agreement with the
Minister of the Environment of the Territory and the Sea, having heard the Joint

Conference, in each case favoring the further development of the sector.*

Article 1(1) of the Fifth Energy Account specifically refers to Article 2(3) of the Fourth

370

Energy Account?” as does the preamble of the Fifth Energy Account.*”! Furthermore,

this preamble stated that the estimated cumulative costs of incentives had reached an

amount of EUR 5.6 billion at the end of March 2012 and that it had therefore been

considered appropriate to intervene in due time.*”

In the Tribunal’s view, this offers a clear indication that the thresholds laid down in
Article 1(2) of the Fourth Energy Account would be reached not even a year after its
adoption and therefore long before the originally stated end-date of 31 December 2016.
This testifies to the enormous dynamism that was to be observed in the Italian solar
energy market at the time, with a massive number of PV plant projects crowding to
obtain access to the incentive payments. What reasonable and circumspect investors
could, and should, have therefore taken from the overall situation is the insight that the
market for PV energy in Italy was on its way to maturity and that, in such dynamic and
volatile circumstances, regulatory interventions were to be expected, not only long
before 31 December 2016, but already in spring 2012 when the reaching of the

thresholds set by the Fourth Energy Account itself became imminent.

The Tribunal harbors no doubt that the estimated cumulative costs of incentives had
actually reached an amount of EUR 5.6 billion at the end of March 2012, as stated in
the preamble of the Fifth Energy Account (see para. 584), and that the reaching of the
aforementioned indicative cost threshold could therefore be expected to be merely a

matter of weeks or a few months.

In this context, the Tribunal notes that the Parties have made extensive submissions
(see paras. 535, 558) as to whether, and to what extent, the GSE has complied with the
obligation under Article 24(2) of the Fourth Energy Account (“Publication of the date
on accumulated powers and on costs”), which reads: “The GSE publishes on its website
and continuously updates the value of the costs of the incentives as per Art. 3, paragraph

1, letters z) and aa), as well as the values of applicable tariffs in each period”.>”7

In spite of the conflicting evidence submitted by the Parties on the frequency of updates
of the so-called “photovoltaic counter” (“contatore fotovoltaico”) administered by the
GSE, the Tribunal observes that eventually there is little to gain for the Claimant’s case
by referring the Tribunal to possible violations by the GSE of Article 24(2) of the Fourth

press release of 19 October 201 1,74 according to which at that time around 288,000 PV
plants were in operation, corresponding to an installed power of more than 11,110 MW
and a total cumulative annual cost of approximately EUR 4.9 billion. Already this
contemporary document sufficed to alert a reasonable and circumspect investor that the

cumulative annual costs were continuously, and rapidly, increasing.

Furthermore, the Claimant itself (see para. 539) concedes that, on 20 January 2012, the
GSE issued a press release communicating that the cost limit for large PV plants had
been reached for all of 2012.37> In addition, the GSE announced that, under the regime
of the Fourth Energy Account, the incentive costs for large PV plants that entered into
operation by 31 August 2011 as well as for those PV plants that entered into the register
for the year 2011 amounted to EUR | billion, which is more than three times as much
as the EUR 300 million cost limit set by Article 6(3)(a) in conjunction with Article 4(2)
of the Fourth Energy Account for that period (see para. 577). By virtue of the latter
provision, the excess cost was to be deducted from the cost limit for the second half of
2012, which was thereby reduced to zero, and the register for large PV plants for that
period was therefore not to be opened.°”° The vast amount by which the cost limit set
by the Fourth Energy Account for the period of June to December 2011 was exceeded
offered just another strong indication to the investor community that the market was
already highly dynamic during the first semester of the Fourth Energy Account’s

operation.

Against this background, the Tribunal is satisfied that, for the purpose of the
foreseeability analysis it has to undertake, relevant information was both available and
accessible for interested PV producers in order to realize that the costs for the
incentivization of solar energy were rapidly increasing in the relevant period and
approaching the thresholds set by the Fourth Energy Account, thus making an
intervention of the Italian authorities foreseeable. Moreover, had a circumspect investor
observed that the GSE website — contrary to Article 24(2) of the Fourth Energy Account

— was not updated regularly in those critical months, it would have been easy to contact

the GSE on this important issue. However, in the present proceedings, the Claimant has
neither argued that it has approached the GSE nor that the GSE, once contacted, would

have refused, or delayed, to provide the necessary information.

The Tribunal would add that the Lazio Regional Administrative Tribunal considered it
undisputed that the PV plant operators were informed through the photovoltaic counter
of the number of plants that progressively gained access to the incentives,*”” and that
the Consiglio di Stato, Italy’s highest judicial authority in administrative matters,
confirmed these decisions, notably stating that “through the monitoring of the s.c.
photovoltaic counter, the operators of the sector were able to follow the evolution of

the annual cumulative costs of the incentives”.>”8

Furthermore, the Lazio Regional Administrative Tribunal found that the Fourth Energy
Account would “exclude any chance of legitimate expectations, given that the operators
were well aware of the fact that the tariffs of the fourth account were subject to a limit,
not merely a time limit, but a limit regarding the level of costs of the incentives, which
were also periodically monitored with the ‘photovoltaic counter’ so that operators could
promptly be informed of the situation”.*”? The Tribunal is well aware that it is not
legally bound by the findings of the competent national courts, but will take their
decisions into consideration whenever appropriate (see para. 375). The Tribunal sees
no reason whatsoever to put these findings into doubt. Accordingly, the Tribunal
concludes that, in the period between fall 2011 and spring 2012, it was manifest for the
reasonable and circumspect investor that the cumulative annual costs of incentives were
quickly increasing and approaching the cost limits set by Article 1(2) of the Fourth

Energy Account, reaching an amount of EUR 5.6 billion at the end of March 2012.
More recently, and conclusively, the Consiglio di Stato stated in a 2016 decision:

And therefore, as noted by the Council of State (see, in particular, sent.
N. 1443 of 2015, cit.), [i]t appears that the operators of the sector have not
only been warned of the possibility of a reduction in the benefits granted
starting since 2011, but have also been placed, both through the control of

the so-called photovoltaic meter (published on the website of the GSE,
which periodically gave an account of the number of plants that received the
incentives and the related annual cost supported), and through specific
publications on the official website of the GSE (such as that of 20 January
2012, entirely relevant in this case, with which the failure to open the
register for the second half of 2012 was announced, due to the exhaustion
of its availability pursuant to Article 6, paragraph 3, of Ministerial Decree 5
May 2011), in the concrete condition to follow the evolution of the annual
cumulative costs of the incentives and to make their own appraisals of
convenience in view of the approaching moment from which, once the six

billion euro limit has been reached, the incentive methods could have been

revised.*%°

While the quoted rulings of Italian domestic courts are not binding upon the Tribunal
(see para. 375), they are nonetheless worth being considered by it, in particular
inasmuch as they confirm the Tribunal’s interim conclusion (see para. 590) that in the
first semester of the Fourth Energy Account’s operation interested PV producers had
access to relevant information in order to become aware that the costs for the
incentivization of solar energy were rapidly increasing and approaching the thresholds
set by the Fourth Energy Account, thus making an intervention of the Italian authorities

foreseeable for a reasonable and circumspect investor.

Contrary to the Claimant’s submission (see para. 546), the question for the Tribunal is
not at what moment in time the cumulative annual cost of incentives reached an amount
of EUR 6 billion (which corresponds to the lower threshold set by Article 1(2) of the
Fourth Energy Account), whether there existed under that energy account an automatic
cut-off mechanism upon attainment of a certain threshold or whether the transition from
the Fourth to the Fifth Energy Account occurred exactly in the manner and procedure
provided for by Article 2(3) of the Fourth Energy Account. As already clarified by the
Tribunal (see paras. 431 et seq.), the pertinent Italian legal framework on the
incentivization of PV energy has indeed given rise to legitimate expectations upon
which the Claimant could rely under the fair and equitable treatment standard of the
ECT. Yet, as also explained above, these legitimate expectations do not protect the
Claimant against a deviation from every single provision contained in the pertinent
administrative decrees, but only against fundamental or radical changes of the

applicable legal framework.

599.

In the light of these reasons, the Tribunal cannot but conclude that the changes brought
about by the Fifth Energy Account that resulted in the Frosinone plants’ not qualifying
for FIT under the Fourth, but the Fifth Energy Account, were foreseeable for a

reasonable and circumspect investor.

This conclusion need not be modified in view of the Claimant’s reliance (see para. 540)

on the GSE Implementing Rules for the Fourth Energy Account according to which

[i]n case of large PV plants that entered into operation between 31 August
2011 and 31 December 2012, without being registered within the specific
costs limits of the relevant period, the Responsible Entities will be entitled
to request admission to the incentives from the year 2013 and a fictious date
of entrance into operation will be established to determine the applicable
feed-in tariff and the beginning of the incentive period, that is the first day
of the semester in which the request is filed at the GSE.**!

As indicated before, the legitimate expectations relevant in the present case do not
protect the Claimant against a deviation from every single provision of the applicable
legislative or administrative decrees, but only against fundamental or radical changes
of the applicable legal framework. Accordingly, in no manner whatsoever could the
Claimant derive from this phrase a guarantee on the part of the Respondent that, when
filing an application from | January 2013 on, the respective PV plants would be entitled

to access for the 2013 incentive tariffs of the Fourth Energy Account.

As a final observation on this point, it is not for the Tribunal to decide whether, as
contended by the Respondent and rejected by the Claimant (see paras. 556 and 548), it
was a business choice of the latter to wait and take the risk that in the meantime the
pertinent thresholds would be reached, as this question is immaterial to the case at hand.
The same holds true with respect to the fact that twelve of the PV plants subject to the
present arbitration have managed to be covered by the Fourth Energy Account (see
para. 132). The question to be answered here is whether it was foreseeable for a
reasonable and circumspect investor at the time that, in light of the highly dynamic
development of the market and its direct implications for the overall costs of Italy’s
incentivization regime for renewable energy, the Respondent would intervene and

modify the existing regulatory framework already with effect for PV plants coming into

operation in the spring of 2012, and the Tribunal answers this question in the

affirmative.

(iii) Proportionality
Thirdly, the Tribunal is called to assess whether the modifications brought about by the
Fifth Energy Account with respect to the Frosinone plants are proportionate, i.e.
whether they did not exceed what was necessary to reach the purposes of that regulatory

act.

In this regard, the Tribunal observes that the Fifth Energy Account entailed both a
qualitative and a quantitative change in the existing incentivization regime. The
Claimant (see para. 541) is correct to turn the Tribunal’s attention to the fact that, unlike
the Fourth Energy Account and its predecessors which provided for fixed payments per
kWh in addition to the market price of electricity, the Fifth Energy Account awarded
large PV plants such as the Frosinone plants an amount equal to the difference between
the all-inclusive tariff, as laid down in Annex 5 to the Fifth Energy Account, and the
market price of electricity plus the revenues deriving from the sale of the energy on the

market*®?

(see para. 133 et seq.). The Tribunal further notes the testimony of the
Respondent’s legal expert, Professor Rojas at the Hearing on the Merits that, “when the
system switched from Energy Account IV and Energy Account V, there was a change
in the paradigm of the incentive scheme, which was not considered any longer as a pure
subsidy, but now the tariff became granting a minimal price” (Tr. 25 September 2019,
55:12-17 [Rojas]). In a similar vein, Mr. Miraglia testified at the Hearing, as follows:
“In the Fifth Energy Account the mechanism changed towards a sliding feed-in

premium” (Tr. 24 September 2019, 218:10-11 [Miraglia]). And he added: “So it
changed the kind of mechanism” (Tr. 24 September 2019, 218:20-21 [Miraglia]).

The Tribunal does not consider, however, that this change in the remuneration system,
albeit noteworthy, resulted in a genuine overhaul of the existing practices of
incentivization of solar energy in Italy. After all, the PV producers still received a
payment per unit produced, which was raised if the electricity was consumed on site.>*°

Moreover, it deserves mention that, as the Claimant itself concedes (see para. 537), the

ee Article 5(1) of the Fifth Energy Account (CL-082).

383 See ibid., Article 5(1).

189

2013 tariff of EUR 205 per MWh under the Fourth Energy Account, to which the
Claimant wished to have acceded, provided (in contrast to the 2011 and 2012 tariffs)
both for a comprehensive FIT including the market price of electricity and a special

tariff for self-consumed energy,?**

thus indicating that no fundamental or radical change
could be observed in the transition from the Fourth to the Fifth Energy Account. Against
this background, the afore-quoted statements of Mr. Rojas and Mr. Miraglia do not, in
the Tribunal’s view, provide a conclusive basis for the Claimant’s contention (Cl. PHB,
para. 97) that the replacement of the Fourth by the Fifth Energy Account altered the
essential characteristics of the Italian incentives regime for solar energy nor can the

Respondent be understood to have accepted this at any point during the proceedings.

603. Furthermore, the Tribunal acknowledges that, in quantitative terms, the Fifth Energy
Account — as its predecessors — entailed a reduction in the level of FIT payments. In the
case of the Frosinone plants, the applicable all-inclusive tariff was set by the Fifth
Energy Account at EUR 107 per MWh,*** which led to a substantial decrease**® in the
incentives from which the Frosinone plants could profit, compared with the scenario in
which they would have been admitted to the 2013 tariff under the Fourth Energy
Account, which amounted to EUR 205 per MWh for facilities such as the Frosinone
plants.*®” According to the Claimant’s economic experts, this generated historical losses

of EUR 1.32 million and future losses of EUR 14.10 million, i.e. total losses of EUR

Alleged by the Claimant, Prof. Enrico Laghi and Prof. Corrado Gatti, 2 February 2018, 17: “[...] the new EA [i.e.
the Fifth Energy Account] was intended to lead the sector to grid parity in a context in which costs had to be
strongly contained. [...] It is worthy to underline that it was the largest decrease, as a percentage, on the previous

September 2011, 1 (C-058).

See, however, also Article 4(4) in conjunction with Annex 5, Table 5 of the Fourth Energy Account (CL-081),
providing for reductions of the incentive payments if the indicative cost limits as defined in Table 1.2 are
exceeded; as regards the massive rise in FIT during 2011, clearly exceeding the cost limit of EUR 580 million set
for 2011 and 2012 together (Article 4(2) of the Fourth Energy Account, Table 1.1), see para. 589.

15.42 million.*** These figures were subsequently lowered to historical losses of EUR

1.31 million and future losses of 12.02 million, i.e. total losses of EUR 13.33 million.*°?

604. When placing the changes brought about by the Fifth Energy Account in a broader
context, the Tribunal notes that that energy account, for instance, privileged small PV
plants as well as integrated PV plants with innovative features and concentrated plants
(Titles III and IV of the Fourth Energy Account) in the sense that under certain
conditions the provisions of the Fourth Energy Account, and thus more attractive
incentive tariffs, would apply to those plants.*°° The Tribunal accepts this as a
legitimate policy choice on the part of the host State,**! with the categories of privileged
plants, as should be underscored, not being newly introduced by the Fifth Energy
Account, but taken from the Fourth Energy Account with which the investor
community was already familiar.*”? In view of the rapid increase in the overall amount
of incentivized energy, which made certain prioritizations necessary, it appears to the
Tribunal as a sound approach to privilege PV plants with innovative features which
meet special technical standards.*”* In a similar vein, the Tribunal deems it reasonable
in such a situation to offer small plants a better deal than large plants such as the
Frosinone plants with a combined capacity of 10 MW, since this involves advantages
for smaller, and often economically weaker plants. A lesser reduction in the incentive
tariffs for large plants would have restricted the ability of the Respondent to apply
relatively better incentive tariffs to those plants that should be prioritized by the Fifth

Energy Account.

605. What is decisive, in the Tribunal’s view, is the enormous dynamism of the market in

the months preceding the adoption of the Fifth Energy Account. The Tribunal accepts

the Public Administration could not, under any circumstances, qualify for the 4th EA, and were subject to the
rules of the 5th EA, even if they commenced operations before 27 August 2012. This specification, though
probably not liked by some investors, simply followed an earlier orientation emerging from what [was] announced
before and specified by the 4th EA”.

the Respondent’s contention that it sought to act swiftly and effectively in order to avoid
that the total amount of incentivized energy would exceed the thresholds set out in the
Fourth Energy Account and thus to maintain the sustainability of the incentivization
regime for solar energy. In view of this important public policy objective, the massive
dynamism in the market which called for swift and effective action on the part of the
authorities, as well as the legitimate choices the authorities made in prioritizing certain
PV plants over others, it strikes the Tribunal as at least plausible that the substantial
reduction in incentive rates which the Fifth Energy Account entailed for large PV plants
such as the Frosinone plants, that would have otherwise qualified for the 2013 tariffs
under the Fourth Energy Account, did not exceed what was necessary to achieve that

goal in the circumstances of the case.

(iv) Conclusion

Hence, while the Tribunal would accept that the extent of reduction in FIT which the
Fifth Energy Account entailed for the Frosinone plants is a disturbing factor in assessing
the compatibility of that energy account with the fair and equitable treatment standard
under Article 10(1), first and second sentences, of the ECT, this aspect is, in the
Tribunal’s view, compensated for by the qualified presence of other factors, notably the
fact that the changes were foreseeable for reasonable and circumspect investors and that
the changes, while involving relevant quantitative reductions, maintained the overall
structure and the essential elements of the Italian incentivization regime for solar

energy.

As to the effort, mandated by this very provision (see paras. 411 et seq.), to strike a
proper balance between the Claimant’s interest in being able to operate in a stable and
transparent legal framework over time and the Respondent’s interest in being able to
adapt its legal framework to new developments, the Tribunal concludes that the
Respondent was justified in adopting the Fifth Energy Account and that the changes it
brought with respect to the Frosinone plants were, considering all relevant elements of
the case, reasonable, foreseeable and proportionate and did not constitute a fundamental
or radical alteration of the applicable legal framework. Thus, the corresponding
legitimate expectation of the Claimant was not frustrated and the fair and equitable

treatment claim regarding the Frosinone plants must be rejected.

b. The indirect expropriation claim regarding the Frosinone plants

As regards the further claim that the Frosinone plants were subject to measures having
effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation in the meaning of Article 13(1) of
the ECT, i.e. an indirect expropriation, because the adoption of the Fifth Energy
Account dramatically decreased the value of the Frosinone plants (see paras. 549-550),
the Claimant has relied on the Electrabel v. Hungary decision, according to which, for
an indirect expropriation to be realized, the measures adopted by the host State must
have effected a “substantial, radical, severe, devastating or fundamental deprivation of
[the investor’s] right or the virtual annihilation, effective neutralization or factual

destruction of its investment, its value or enjoyment”.***

Applying this jurisprudence to the case at hand, the Tribunal considers that, at the
moment of adoption and entry into force of the Fifth Energy Account in July 2012, the
Claimant’s investment with respect to the Frosinone plants essentially consisted in the
completed PV plants. Having this in mind, the Tribunal cannot see how the Fifth Energy
Account would have, even in an indirect manner, annihilated, neutralized or factually

destroyed this installation or its value as it existed at that moment in time.

The argument that the Claimant seeks to make, by raising its claim of indirect
expropriation, appears to be that the adoption of the Fifth Energy Account withdrew
the possibility from the Claimant of having access to the 2013 tariff under the Fourth
Energy Account and brought the Frosinone plants under the regime of the Fifth Energy
Account instead. Yet, at the moment of the adoption and entry into force of the Fifth
Energy Account, accession to the 2013 tariff was a mere aspiration on the part of the
Claimant, but not a “right” in the meaning of the Electrabel v. Hungary decision, of
which the Claimant would have been deprived. Differently put, what the Claimant has
lost is, as argued by the Respondent (Resp. Rejoinder, para. 553), income that the
Claimant expected to generate from its investment. The Claimant did, however, not

have an acquired right to that expected income.

34 Electrabel S.A. v. Republic of Hungary, 1CSID Case No. ARB/07/19, Decision on Jurisdiction, Applicable
Law and Liability, 30 November 2012, para. 6.62 (CL-013).

614.

Accordingly, the FIT reduction cannot be considered, for the purposes of Article 13(1)
ECT, to have annihilated, effectively neutralized or factually destroyed the Claimant’s

investment in the Frosinone plants as it existed in July 2012.

In the light of this finding, the Tribunal sees no need to further delve into the other
submissions of the Parties regarding the alleged indirect expropriation of the Frosinone

plants and rejects the Claimant’s claim inasmuch as it is based on Article 13(1) ECT.

c. Introduction of an administrative management fee by the Fifth Energy
Account and its amendment by the Spalma-incentivi Decree
In addition, the Fifth Energy Account also contained a provision requiring PV energy
producers benefiting from incentive tariffs under any of the energy accounts to pay, as
of 1 January 2013, an annual administrative fee of EUR 0.0005 per kWh of incentivized
energy (see para. 136). The relevant parts of Article 10 (“Management of the incentives
system and implementing regulations”) of the Decree establishing the Fifth Energy

Account read:

qd) Producers applying for the feed-in tariffs set forth in this decree
shall pay to the GSE a fee for the processing of the application
equal to EUR 3 for each kW of nominal power for plants below 20
kW and EUR 2 for each kW above 20 kW. [...]

(4) In order to cover for management, control and inspection costs of

the GSE, the responsible entities acceding to the feed-in tariffs

under this decree [...] shall pay to the GSE starting 1 January 2013,

also through the set-off of the incentives due, a fee of 0.05 c euro

for each kWh of incentivized energy. [...]*?°
Subsequently, the Spalma-incentivi Decree (see para. 143) altered the administrative
management fee, notably by making it contingent on the PV plant’s capacity in the
following terms: (a) 2.20 EUR/kW for PV plants having a capacity between 3 and 6
kW; (b) 2 EUR/kW for PV plants having a capacity between 6 and 20 kW; (c) 1.80
EUR/kW for PV plants having a capacity between 20 and 200 kW; (d) 1.40 EUR/kW
for PV plants having a capacity between 200 and 100 kW; and (e) 1.20 EUR/kW for
PV plants having a capacity above 1 MW.?°

385 See Article 10 of the Fifth Energy Account (CL-082).

3% See Article 25 of the Spalma-incentivi Decree (CL-085=R-030); see further Decreto Ministeriale, 24 December

616.

617.

Having concluded that this administrative management fee does not constitute a
taxation measure in the meaning of Article 21 of the ECT and having therefore rejected
the Respondent’s respective jurisdictional objection (see para. 311), the Tribunal will
now address whether the introduction of the fee by the Fifth Energy Account and/or its
amendment by the Spalma-incentivi Decree violated, as argued by the Claimant
(Cl. Memorial, paras. 355-358; Cl. Reply, paras. 223-231), on the one hand,
Article 10(1), second sentence, of the ECT on fair and equitable treatment and, on the
other, Article 10(1), last sentence, of the ECT on the observance-of-obligations or

umbrella clause.

To begin with, the Claimant (Cl. Memorial, para. 357) contends that through the
unilateral deduction of incentive payments under the label of an administrative
management fee, the Respondent violated the Claimant’s legitimate expectations,
namely to receive a precisely stated rate as an incentive for renewable energy, and

therefore breached the fair and equitable treatment clause of the ECT.

In this regard, the Tribunal refers to the standard identified above, namely that the
pertinent Italian legislative and regulatory framework gave rise to the legitimate
expectation that the overall integrity of the Italian incentivization system for renewable
energy would be maintained and that the Claimant would therefore be protected against
fundamental or radical changes of this system, but had to be prepared for non-radical
modifications of the applicable legal framework (see paras. 424 et seq.). Furthermore,
when assessing whether the Respondent frustrated these legitimate expectations by
introducing the aforementioned administrative management fee, the Tribunal recalls
that, in order to strike a proper balance between the Claimant’s interest in the stability
of the legislative and regulatory framework and the Respondent’s right to adapt this
framework to new developments, three factors are to be taken into account, namely
whether the adopted measures were (i) reasonable, (ii) foreseeable and

(iii) proportionate (see para. 446).

In terms of reasonableness, i.e. whether or not the introduction of the administrative
management fee could draw on a public policy purpose, the Tribunal refers to its
analysis above which is also applicable in the present context (see paras. 447 et seq.).°°”
In this regard, the Tribunal refers to its previous finding that PV energy producers with
plants benefiting from the energy accounts have to pay the fee for specific purposes,
i.e. for the processing of their application as well as in order to cover for the
management, control and inspection costs of the GSE (see paras. 301, 306). This is
confirmed by Recital 22 of the Decree establishing the Fifth Energy Account which
states that the Ministry “[dJeemed it appropriate and fair that those who benefit from
the feed-in tariffs for photovoltaics contribute to the coverage of charges for the
management of the photovoltaic incentive scheme”.*** The Tribunal is satisfied that
allocating a part of the costs of managing the electricity system to energy producers
benefiting from the incentivization regime represents a public policy objective also for
the purposes of the reasonableness assessment to be made in the context of the fair and

equitable treatment analysis.

As concerns, secondly, the question of whether the introduction and subsequent
modification of the administrative management fee by the Fifth Energy Account and
the Spalma-incentivi Decree was to be expected by a reasonable and circumspect
investor, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent (see para. 563) that the Claimant
could not have reasonably expected on the basis of the existing legislative and
regulatory framework that no such administrative fee would be introduced throughout
the incentivization period. In particular, the Tribunal recalls the distinction to be made
between the promise of a fixed and a stable amount of incentives to be paid to PV
producers, with the latter scenario being the relevant one with respect to the Italian
incentivization system for solar energy (see paras. 433, 435). Hence, a reasonable and
circumspect PV producer would have been prepared for certain modifications in the

amount of the incentives received.

Finally, the Tribunal is called to ascertain whether the introduction and modification of
the administrative management fee was proportionate, i.e. did not exceed what was

necessary to reach the purposes of the regulatory act. The Tribunal notes in this regard

391 See in this regard also Recitals 13 et seq. of the Fifth Energy Account (CL-082).

that the Respondent considers the fee to be “extremely low” and to “have a very limited
economic impact on the PV producers”, arguing that the fee amounted to 0.15-0.17 %
of the average of the incentive tariffs (Resp. Counter-Memorial, paras. 309-310, 547;

Resp. Rejoinder, para. 572).

At the same time, the Tribunal acknowledges the Claimant’s submission that the real
impact of the fee in question is a multiple of the percentage posited by the Respondent
(Cl. Reply, para. 227), notably because the modification of the fee’s calculation method
by the Spalma-incentivi Decree approximately doubled the fee (Cl. Memorial,
para. 120; Cl. Reply, para. 225). The Tribunal further observes that the Claimant’s
economic experts, while first having quantified the Claimant’s losses as a result of the
administrative fee at around EUR 2.85 million (EUR 172,000 for historical losses and
EUR 2,678,000 for future losses),*”? subsequently lowered this assessment in their
second report to around EUR 1.7 million (EUR 118,000 of historical losses and
EUR 6,000 of future losses due to the introduction of the fee as well as EUR 1,565,000

for future losses due to the increase of the fee).4°°

While the Claimant (Cl. Reply, para. 227) criticizes the Respondent for having failed
to submit any appropriate evidence for the quantification of the administrative
management fee, the Tribunal observes that the latter (Resp. Counter-Memorial,
paras. 309-310) has relied on a 2014 report which was submitted by the GSE to the
Ministry of Economic Development pursuant to Article 25(2) of the Spalma-incentivi
Decree.*”! According to this report, in 2013, the GSE recorded total operative costs of
EUR 36.41 million for the photovoltaic sector, EUR 15.60 million of which were borne
by the beneficiaries of the incentives; for 2014, the respective numbers were EUR 37.97
million and EUR 11.40 million.“°? When comparing the beneficiaries’ contribution with
the amount of incentive payments for PV energy in 2013 and 2014 of EUR 6.62 billion

and 6.93 billion, respectively, the relative contribution of the beneficiaries of PV

incentives on average accounted for 0.236 % and 0.165 % of the incentives received.*°
The Tribunal notes in this context that the Respondent (Resp. Counter-Memorial,
para. 310), while referring to the numbers of the year 2013, considers it evident that the
contribution of the beneficiaries only amounted to 0.16 % of the incentives perceived,
which appears to come closer to the relevant figure for 2014; in any event, this does not

change the Tribunal’s analysis on this aspect.

Furthermore, the Tribunal observes that the 2014 GSE report expected annual
contributions from the incentivized PV sector of EUR 23.9 million for the years 2015
to 2017,*™ i.e. already under the regime of the administrative fee as modified by the
Spalma-incentivi Decree. Accordingly, even the modification of the method of

calculation of the fee, which also involves an increase of the fee, brings the

  

beneficiaries’ contribution up to only about 0.345 % of the incentives received.

Against this background, even taking into account that the GSE report merely provides
information on the average impact of the fee on PV producers, the Tribunal is satisfied
that the economic burden for the Claimant arising from the introduction and the
modification of the administrative management fee consists in a relatively low

£295

amount not exceeding half of a percent of the incentives received by the Claimant,

and may therefore be considered proportionate.

In the overall assessment to be made under the fair and equitable treatment standard,
the Tribunal cannot but conclude that the introduction and modification of the
administrative management fee by the Fifth Energy Account and the Spalma-incentivi
Decree constituted a non-radical modification of the applicable legal framework. In a
similar vein, the recent SunReserve v. Italy tribunal found that it “does not consider
such a minimal impact on operating costs to constitute a frustration of Claimants’
legitimate expectations”.*°° This also holds true when further considering, as the

Tribunal is required to do, the combined effect of the FIT deduction effectuated by the

Spalma-incentivi Decree (see para. 141) and the administrative fee discussed here. In
view of the relatively low amount of the administrative management fee, the Tribunal
sees no need to reconsider its observations made with respect to the reasonableness,
foreseeability and proportionality of the Spalma-incentivi Decree (see paras. 445 et

seq.).

As regards the claim based on the umbrella clause and the Claimant’s submission that
the introduction of the administrative management fee effectively modified the GSE
conventions under the Second, Third and Fourth Energy Accounts (Cl. Memorial,
para. 355; Cl. Reply, paras. 229-230), the Tribunal can limit itself to recall its previous
finding that the GSE conventions, as accessory contracts, do not fall within the ambit

of the ECT’s umbrella clause (see para. 388).

Hence, the Respondent did not violate Article 10(1), second or last sentence, of the ECT

by introducing or amending the administrative management fee.

(3) Conclusion

For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal concludes that, by adopting the Fifth Energy
Account, the Respondent did not breach the ECT. In particular, the Fifth Energy
Account neither violated the fair and equitable treatment standard with regard to the
Frosinone plants nor did it constitute an indirect expropriation of those plants.
Furthermore, the introduction of an administrative management fee by the Fifth Energy
Account and its subsequent amendment by the Spalma-incentivi Decree did not violate

Article 10, second or last sentence, of the ECT.

CONCLUSION

Having rejected all of the Claimant’s claims, the Tribunal concludes that the

Respondent has not breached Articles 10(1) or 13 of the ECT.

As the Claimant has not succeeded on its liability claims, there is no need for the
Tribunal to summarize or resolve the Parties’ respective positions concerning damages.
The Tribunal thus proceeds to the only remaining issue, i.e. the assessment and

distribution of fees and expenses pursuant to Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention.

TOTAL €3,216,388.41

RESPONDENT’S SUBMISSION ON COSTS

The Respondent has not filed a submission on costs.

THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION ON COSTS

Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:

In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties
otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection
with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses,
the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for
the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form
part of the award.

This provision gives the Tribunal discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration,

including attorney’s fees and other costs, between the Parties as it deems appropriate.

While the Respondent ultimately prevailed on the merits, the Claimant prevailed in
relation to significant non-merits issues. Notably, the Claimant successfully defended
itself against four jurisdictional objections on the part of the Respondent that have
resulted in the bifurcation of the proceedings and the subsequent rejoining of the
jurisdiction and merits phases (as regards Procedural Orders No. 2 and 5, see paras. 30,
57), various briefs of the Parties regarding jurisdictional and admissibility questions
(see paras. 39 et seq.) and a separate Hearing on Jurisdiction on 1 November 2018 (see
para. 56) in which the parties comprehensively argued their respective positions

regarding the Tribunal’s jurisdiction and the admissibility of the claims brought by the

200

637.

638.

Claimant. In addition, the Respondent submitted a Request for Termination which the

Tribunal rejected by Procedural Order No. 6 (see paras. 61 et seq.).

In the Tribunal’s view, in its decision on the allocation of costs it would not be
appropriate to ignore the fact that the Respondent’s objections and request significantly
contributed to the overall costs of the proceedings. Considering that both Parties
prevailed to some significant extent, the Tribunal concludes on this issue that each Party
should bear half of the costs of the arbitration and should bear its own direct costs

incurred in connection with the proceedings.

The costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the
Tribunal’s Assistant, ICSID’s administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in

USD):

Arbitrators’ and Tribunal’s Assistant fees and expenses 886,624.63

ICSID’s administrative fees 158,000
Direct expenses (estimated) 76,247.15
Total 1,120,871.78

The above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties.*°” As a result,

each Party’s share of the costs of arbitration amounts to USD 560,435.89.

407 The remaining balance will be reimbursed to the parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to

Dissenting Opinion of Judge O. Thomas Johnson

Article 10(1) of the ECT obliges Respondent “to accord at all times to Investments of
Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment.” Respondent thus was,
and is, under a treaty obligation to treat Claimant’s investments fairly. I write this separate
opinion because, unlike my two colleagues, I have concluded that Respondent did not treat
Claimant’s investments fairly when, through the Spalma Incentivi Decree, it unilaterally
revised the terms of the Third, Fourth and Fifth Energy Accounts so as to deny to those
investments some of the benefits to which they were entitled under the terms of those

Accounts.

Introduction

I begin with a hypothetical case. A father observes that the house he shares with his
children (assume he is a single parent) has become rather untidy. He approaches his young
daughter and son and asks if they would like to assist in cleaning the house, suggesting that
they might begin by putting away all of the toys that are strewn around their respective
rooms. When neither steps forward, he makes them the following offer: if you help me to
achieve my goal of living in a tidy house by putting away all of your toys before dinner
time, I will give each of you for desert two scoops of ice cream. The daughter complies,

and does so before dinner. (The son is slow off the mark.)

After dinner the father gives his daughter a dish with only one scoop of ice cream. When
the daughter reminds her father that he had promised two scoops of ice cream the father
replies: “That was this morning, and since then I have concluded that this family is
spending too much money on ice cream, so I decided, exercising my undoubted authority
to take whatever action I deem appropriate for the good of the family, to give you only one
scoop of ice cream, even though you cleaned up your room exactly as I asked.” To which
the precocious daughter replies: “I do not doubt your authority as my father to give me less
ice cream than you said you would, and I have no doubt that you believe you are acting in
the best interests of the family as a whole, still, THIS IS NOT FAIR.” Whatever a father

in this situation might say in response, one cannot imagine that it would include an

assertion that his treatment of his daughter was fair. The father might argue that he acted
out of some economic necessity, or that the daughter was eating too much ice cream, or
that he just changed his mind and, after all, he did not radically and fundamentally change
his commitment because he did give her one scoop of ice cream. But it would not dawn
on a father in this situation to argue to his daughter that her judgment was wrong, that she
in fact had been treated fairly; it certainly would not occur to him to tell her that she could

not legitimately have expected him to do as he said he would do.

The claim before this Tribunal concerning Respondent’s reduction of benefits to which the
Claimant’s investments were entitled under the various energy accounts is every bit as
simple and easy to evaluate as my ice cream hypothetical: whatever justifications might be
offered for the reduction, one cannot say that it was fair. Yet my colleagues say just that.
I shall examine their reasoning below. I can, however, summarize that reasoning in terms
of my hypothetical as follows: Because the daughter in my example knew that her father
had the authority to give her less than two scoops of ice cream, and because the father had
not given his daughter a separate promise that he would not exercise that authority, the
daughter had no “legitimate expectation” that her father would comply with his
commitment to give her two scoops of ice cream and, thus, was treated fairly when given

only one scoop of ice cream.!
The Pertinent Facts

Italy implemented the EU’s First Renewables Directive through Legislative Decree
No. 387/2003, which delegated to the Minister of Economic Activities the authority “to
adopt one or more decrees by which the criteria for encouraging the production of
electricity from solar source are defined.”? Pursuant to this authority, a series of so-called
“energy accounts” (“conti energia”) were established by ministerial decree. These
accounts stated the terms and conditions of the incentive tariff regime that would apply to

PV plants for a stated period of time.? Each account provided that any investor that

developed a PV plant of a given capacity and connected it to the grid within a given time
frame would be paid a given rate for the electricity that it produced for a period of 20 years.*
In 2014, Italy enacted Legislative Decree No. 91/2014,> the so-called “Spalma-incentivi
Decree”, which modified the terms of the existing energy accounts by reducing the rates
payable to existing investors by anywhere from six to twenty-five percent over the
remainder of the terms to which they were entitled under their energy accounts. (Claimant’s

reduction was between six and eight percent.)

In other words, the Italian government agreed to provide a very specific benefit to investors
who helped Italy achieve its EU-mandated renewables goals by making specified
investments within specified time periods and, after investors -- including Claimant -- made
the required investments and had begun to receive the promised benefits, the Italian
government reduced the benefits below the promised level. I do not believe that either of
my colleagues would disagree with this characterization of the situation that we are called
upon to measure against the ECT’s requirement that Italy treat Claimant’s investments

fairly and equitably.
Fair and Equitable Treatment, and Specific Commitments

The award’s discussion of fair and equitable treatment begins sensibly enough. It notes at
the outset the agreement of the Parties that “the general obligation of a State to grant foreign
investors fair and equitable treatment ... notably includes the protection of the legitimate
expectations of these investors.”° Some paragraphs later the award takes note of the further
agreement of the Parties “that ‘specific commitments’ by a State may give rise to legitimate
expectations of investors protected under the fair and equitable treatment standard ....””
The award even resolves (to my mind, correctly) the Parties’ dispute over whether a

“specific commitment” can arise only from an agreement between the host State and the

investor that precedes the investment. After quoting the dissent in Jiirgen Wirtgen and
others. v. Czech Republic with approval, the award states the following conclusions in

successive paragraphs:

[T]he Tribunal does not derive from the existing arbitral jurisprudence on
the matter that, in order for a specific commitment to create legitimate
expectations, it is indispensable that there exists an individual agreement
between the host State and a specific investor.’

[A] State may make specific commitments to investors also by virtue of
legislative or regulatory acts which are not addressed to particular
individuals, provided that these acts are sufficiently specific regarding their
content and their object and purpose. In this context, the Tribunal considers
the creation of legitimate expectations more likely where a State has
adopted legislative or regulatory acts “with a specific aim to induce ...
investments.”!°

The award subsequently goes on to determine:

e that the energy accounts, combined with their legislative authorization, were

“detailed and specific”;!!

e that the Italian strategy of “successively building one energy account upon the
other, all containing the same type of commitment, presents itself to the Tribunal,
in the terms used by the El Paso Energy v. Argentina tribunal, as ‘a reiteration of
the same type of commitment in different types of general statements,’ justifying
qualifying it as ‘a specific behaviour of the State, the object and purpose of which
is to give the investor a guarantee on which it can justifiably rely’”;'? and

e (quoting Respondent’s expert with approval) that “‘[t]he purpose of providing

incentive tariffs was of course to incentivize investment in the photovoltaic sector,

8 “The decisive issue is not whether a state’s undertaking is ‘specific’ or ‘general’, or statutory or contractual, but
whether the statements and actions of the state provide a sufficiently clear commitment to give rise under international
law to legitimate expectations or legal rights on the part of the investor”. Award, para. 406, quoting Jiirgen Wirtgen
and others. v. Czech Republic, PCA Case No. 2014-03, Dissenting Opinion of Gary Born, 11 October 2017, para. 12.

because, as we know, photovoltaic energy was costly to produce, it was below

market price; with no incentive, there would have not been investment.’”!3

All of which leads the majority to conclude that “the pertinent Italian legal framework on

the incentivization of PV energy ... has indeed given rise to specific commitments of the

Respondent, thus creating legitimate expectations upon which the Claimant could rely.”!*

8. All of this strikes me as plainly correct. The energy accounts offered clear and specific
benefits to investors who complied with clear and specific conditions. The accounts were
legislatively authorized. The accounts were promulgated solely for the purpose of
incentivizing investment in the solar-power sector and created legitimate expectations on
which investors, including Claimant, relied in making their investments. One might
wonder what more the majority requires before finding that Respondent has breached its
obligation to treat Claimant’s investments fairly? The answer comes in the sentence
immediately following the language quoted at the end of the preceding paragraph: “Yet,
nowhere in the pertinent legislative or regulatory framework did the Respondent commit

itself to leave this legal framework untouched for twenty years.”!>

9. It is hard to know where to begin in replying to this. In the first place, it is not, in any
meaningful sense, true; one of Respondent’s specific commitments in the energy accounts
was that investors who qualified would enjoy the benefits stated in the Accounts for 20
years. It is, of course true that Respondent never gave a separate promise that it would not
violate the terms of its specific commitment. The obvious response to this true statement
is: so what! Can it really be “fair” to break a promise unless one has separately promised
not to break the promise? A full and careful reading of the award’s discussion of fair and
equitable treatment leaves the reader with no doubt that my colleagues believe exactly this.
Their last word on the subject is the following: “the Tribunal finds that the Respondent did
not make any specific commitment in the pertinent legislative decrees or energy accounts

that it would maintain the amount or the duration of incentive payments exactly at the level

originally laid down in the applicable energy accounts.”!® One must view the word “fair”
in the manner of Humpty Dumpty to conclude that the lack of a promise to keep a promise

renders it fair to break the original promise.!7

10. I speculate that the source of my colleagues’ error is what might be called a category
mistake. They are applying the concept of a contractual stabilization clause — that is, a
clause in a contract with a sovereign in which the sovereign explicitly surrenders its
sovereign authority to unilaterally modify its contracts — in a context to which the concept
has no application. A sovereign’s authority to modify its contracts would be relevant to
our consideration of Claimant’s claims under the ECT’s umbrella clause, but it has nothing
to do with whether Italy acted fairly when it unilaterally modified the energy accounts on
which Claimant had relied. If, as my colleagues have concluded, Italy’s solar-power
incentives were specific commitments that created “legitimate expectations upon which
the Claimant could rely,” frustration of those expectations cannot be rendered fair by the
lack of a parallel commitment from Italy not to change its mind. To go back to my ice
cream hypothetical, my colleagues’ reliance on the lack of a stabilization clause has about
the same persuasive appeal as would a statement from my hypothetical father to his
displeased hypothetical daughter that, while he had promised to give her two scoops of ice

cream, he has treated her fairly because he never promised not to give her less.

11. There is a second possible source of my colleague’s error, which also would be a category
mistake, and that is that they may view the degree to which Italy reduced incentives below
the committed level as sufficiently modest to remain within the range of Claimant’s
legitimate expectations. This reason is nowhere stated explicitly in the award, but there
are suggestions. For example, in paragraph 437 (quoted above), the majority says that Italy
did not make a commitment that it would leave incentives “exactly at the level originally
laid down in the applicable energy accounts.” (Italics added.) And in paragraph 431 (also
quoted above), the majority says “nowhere ... did the Respondent commit itself to leave

[the incentives] untouched for twenty years.” (Italics added.) If the majority in fact means

Iv.

that unilateral reductions in promised benefits are fair if the reductions are small, the
obvious answer is that the magnitude of the reductions goes to damages, not liability. A
modest reduction of benefits will cause investors less damage than would a greater
reduction of benefits, all else remaining equal. But to contend that it is fair for a state to
breach a specific commitment if it does so only modestly is nonsense. That no doubt is
why the majority does not actually make this contention. (My hypothetical father would
be in less trouble with his hypothetical daughter if he gave her one and one-half scoops of

ice cream instead of only one, but he would still be in trouble.)

The jurisprudence concerning specific commitments and fair and equitable treatment is, to
say the least, inconsistent. The award, I think, does an admirable job of applying clear
thinking to this jurisprudence. On the important contentious issues (see paragraph 7,
above), the award describes the differing views and comes out on what I believe to be the
right side of the debate, accompanied by cogent and persuasive reasoning. Having gotten
so much right in the award, I have great trouble understanding why my colleagues have
reached a conclusion that not only, in my view, is wrong but cannot be reconciled with
their correct conclusions concerning the preliminary questions. It simply cannot be true
that the provisions of Respondent’s energy accounts are specific commitments on which
Claimant justifiably relied and also be true that Respondent treated Claimant fairly when
it modified those commitments to Claimant’s detriment. And this logical impossibility is
not remedied by observing that Respondent never promised that it would keep its specific
commitment. That may be sufficient to avoid liability under the ECT’s umbrella clause,
but it has nothing to do with whether Respondent has complied with its obligation to treat

Claimant’s investments fairly.

Conclusion

Lawyers — perhaps particularly international lawyers — are inclined to treat as difficult
issues that strike the layman as simple. This inclination, I fear, is evident in the award’s
discussion of fair and equitable treatment. As is recognized in the Award, the starting point
for any exercise in treaty construction is Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the

Law of Treaties, which provides that “[a] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in

accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context
and in the light of its object and purpose.”'* Applying the ordinary meaning of “fair and
equitable” can be difficult if one is ing the effects of changes to a general regulatory
regime, such as revisions to environmental, worker-safety, or land-use regulations, It is not
difficult, however, when one is dealing with specific commitments, as we are in this case.'”
To be in compliance with Article 10(1) of the ECT, Respondent's treatment of Claimant’s
investments must have been both “fair” and “equitable”. It is not possible to fit
Respondent’s revisions of the specific commitments it made to Claimant’s investments
within the ordinary meaning of the word “fair,” and there is nothing in the context of Article
10(1) or in the object and purpose of the ECT that can change that inescapable fact. My
hypothetical father could not fairly give his daughter less ice cream than he promised to
encourage her to help clean the house, and Italy cannot fairly give Claimant less-valuable
benefits than it promised to encourage Claimant to expand Italy’s solar-power capacity. It

really is as simple as that.
