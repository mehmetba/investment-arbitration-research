PCA Case No. 2017-41

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On 15 November 2017, the Claimant submitted a Notice of Arbitration, invoking Article
11 of the Agreement between the Kingdom of Spain and the Republic of Guatemala for
the Mutual Promotion and Protection of Investments, which was signed on 9 December
2002 and entered into force on 21 May 2004 (the “Treaty” or the “BIT”) and the
Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law 1976
(the “UNCITRAL Rules”). The Notice of Arbitration was received by the Respondent on
23 November 2017.

In its Notice of Arbitration, the Claimant proposed that (i) three arbitrators be appointed;
(ii) the arbitration be conducted in English and Spanish; (iii) the seat of the arbitration be
The Hague, the Netherlands; and (iv) the Permanent Court of Arbitration (the “PCA”)
administer the proceedings. In its Notice of Arbitration, the Claimant also appointed
Prof. Pierre-Marie Dupuy, a national of France, as the first arbitrator.

By letter dated 22 December 2017, the Respondent (i) agreed that three arbitrators be
appointed, that the proceedings be conducted in Spanish and English and that the PCA
administer the proceedings; (ii) proposed that the seat of the arbitration be Paris, France;
and (iii) proposed that the Parties attempt to agree on the presiding arbitrator within
45 days, following which either Party would be allowed to request that the Secretary-
General of the PCA, acting as appointing authority, appoint the presiding arbitrator in
accordance with Article 7(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules. In this letter, the Respondent also
appointed Mr. J. Christopher Thomas QC, a national of Canada, as the second arbitrator.

By their respective communications of 9 and 15 January 2018, the Parties informed the
PCA that they had agreed for it to act as administering institution, and as appointing
authority in the event that the Parties failed to agree on a choice of presiding arbitrator
within 45 days.

The Tribunal was constituted on 8 February 2018, when the Parties confirmed the
appointment of Prof. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, a national of Switzerland, as the
Presiding Arbitrator.

By letter dated 28 February 2018, the Tribunal (i) invited the Parties to comment on draft
terms of appointment and a draft procedural order; (ii) proposed dates for a first
procedural conference; and (iii) proposed that Ms. Sabina Sacco be appointed as
Secretary of the Tribunal.

On 3 April 2018, the Parties submitted joint comments on the draft terms of appointment
and procedural order. Inter alia, the Parties agreed that they would exchange two rounds
of written briefs on the Respondent’s preliminary objections. The Claimant proposed that
the written briefs be followed by a procedural order on bifurcation, following which the
Tribunal would either hold a hearing on preliminary objections or convene a procedural
hearing to fix the calendar for the subsequent phase of the proceedings. The Respondent

PCA Case No. 2017-41
Final Award
24 August 2020

proposed that a hearing on preliminary objections be held after the filing of the last written
brief on preliminary objections.

By letter dated 12 April 2018, the Tribunal proposed alternative dates for the first
procedural conference in light of the Parties’ unavailability on the dates proposed by the
Tribunal. The Tribunal also noted the Parties’ agreement on the sequence and timing of
the first round of written briefs, and, subject to any objection from either Party, fixed the
deadlines for the Respondent to submit its Preliminary Objections and for the Claimant
to submit its Response thereto. On 12 and 13 April 2018, the Respondent and the Claimant
respectively confirmed their agreement that the starting date of the procedural calendar
be fixed on 20 April 2018, as proposed by the Tribunal.

On 11 May 2018, the Parties and the Tribunal held the first procedural conference. The
Claimant was represented at the conference by Mr. Félix Sobrino Martinez of Iberdrola
Energia, S.A.; and Mr. Miguel Virgés, Mr. Gabriel Bottini, Ms. Gillian Cahill, Ms. Heidi
Lépez, Ms. Eugenia Simé and Ms. Jana Lamas de Mesa of Uria Menéndez Abogados,
S.L.P. The Respondent was represented at the conference by Ms. Ana Luisa Gatica and
Ms. Lilian Najera of the Procuraduria General de la Nacién of Guatemala; Ms. Gabriela
Hernandez, Mr. Francisco Vasquez and Mr. Jorge Mario Andrade of the Ministry of
Economy of Guatemala; Mr. Eduardo Silva Romero and Ms. Andrea Zumbado of
Dechert (Paris) LLP; and Mr. Juan Felipe Merizalde of Dechert LLP.

Subsequent to the procedural conference held on 11 May 2018, on 1 June 2019, the
Tribunal circulated a finalized version of the Terms of Appointment for signature and
issued Procedural Order No. 1, in which it (i) fixed Geneva (Switzerland) as the seat of
the arbitration; (ii) established the regime for confidentiality and transparency of the
proceedings; (iii) set forth rules governing the languages of the arbitration; and
(iv) established a procedural timetable. The said procedural timetable fixed a calendar for
written submissions leading to a decision on bifurcation, in which the Tribunal would
determine whether:

a. It can resolve the Respondent’s preliminary objections without reviewing
the merits of the case, in which case the proceedings will continue to be
bifurcated, and the next step will be a hearing on preliminary objections, or

b. It cannot resolve the Respondent’s preliminary objections without going into
the merits of the case, in which case it will join the preliminary objections to
the merits and convene a procedural hearing to establish a calendar for the
joined jurisdiction and merits phase.

On 12 June 2018, following consultations with the Parties, the Tribunal fixed the date for
a hearing on preliminary objections (should the proceedings be bifurcated) on 4 June
2019 (and, if necessary, 5 June 2019) (the “Hearing on Preliminary Objections”).

On 16 July 2018, the Tribunal circulated the consolidated executed Terms of
Appointment (the “Terms of Appointment”).

Admissibility of Claims (“Mem.”), which included a counterclaim (the “Counterclaim”).

On 25 July 2018, the Tribunal fixed a calendar for written submissions on the
Counterclaim.

On 28 September 2018, the Parties agreed that the Hearing on Preliminary Objections be
held at the Peace Palace, The Hague, the Netherlands. The Tribunal confirmed the Parties’
agreed venue for the hearing on 1 October 2018.

The Claimant filed its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, Admissibility and

On 8 March 2019, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction on the Counterclaim

On 14 March 2019, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Bifurcation (in English and
Spanish) (the “Decision on Bifurcation”), in which it decided as follows:!

a. Subject to paragraph (b) below, the Respondent’s primary and alternative
objections to jurisdiction and/or admissibility shall be bifurcated;

b. The Tribunal reserves the possibility to join the Respondent’s alternative
objection that the claims fall outside of its ratione materiae jurisdiction to
the merits after the hearing;

c. The hearing scheduled for 4 June 2019 (with 5 June 2019 as reserve day) is
confirmed;

d. The Respondent shall indicate if it wishes to call any of the Claimant’s
experts for cross-examination by 15 April 2019;

e. A pre-hearing conference call will be held on one of the following days and
times: 23, 24, 25, or 26 April at 15:00, 16:00 or 17:00 CET. The Parties are
invited to state whether they are available on such dates and times by 21
March 2019. Unless either Party objects within that time limit, this
conference shall be conducted by the Presiding Arbitrator on behalf of the
Tribunal;

on 25 April 2019.

On 23 April 2019, the Tribunal circulated a draft procedural order for comments and
finalization during the pre-hearing conference.

On 25 April 2019, the Tribunal and the Parties held the pre-hearing conference. The
Claimant was represented at the conference by Ms. Maria Grande and Mr. Félix Sobrino

The Claimant filed its Submission on Article 26 of the ICSID Convention on
27 September 2019 (““C-PHB1”).

On 10 December 2019, the Tribunal invited the Parties to file, by 10 January 2020,
additional post-hearing briefs (i) addressing whether, when assessing the Respondent’s
res judicata objection, the Tribunal should consider Swiss international arbitration law in
addition to international law, and (ii) in the affirmative, establishing the content of Swiss
international arbitration law on res judicata with respect to negative jurisdictional awards.

On 10 January 2020, the Parties filed their submissions on the notion of res judicata under
Swiss international arbitration law (“C-PHB2” and “R-PHB2”, respectively).

On 10 June 2020, the Claimant noted the issuance of the award in Teco Guatemala
Holdings, LLC v. the Republic of Guatemala (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/23) Resubmission
Proceeding (“Teco II”), and noted that it was “in the Tribunal’s hands” should it deem it
useful to hear the Parties’ views on the said award.

On 19 June 2020, the Respondent noted that the Claimant made no specific request to the
Tribunal in connection with the Teco JJ award and declined to make further comments.

On 23 June 2020, the Tribunal noted that neither Party had requested leave to make
submissions on the Teco I award and that, having taken cognizance of the said award, it
did not consider further submissions necessary.

OVERVIEW OF THE DISPUTE AND RELIEF SOUGHT
A. Undisputed facts
The following facts appear to be undisputed by the Parties.

Iberdrola is a Spanish investor who made an investment in Guatemala’s clectricity sector.
Specifically, in 1998 Iberdrola, together with TPS de Ultramar (“TECO”) and EDP
Electricidade de Portugal (“EDP”, and jointly with Iberdrola and TECO, the
“Consortium”), acquired 80.8% of Empresa Eléctrica de Guatemala, S.A. (“EEGSA”).”

Within the framework of the General Electricity Law of 1996 (the “LGE”), Guatemalan
authorities took certain measures in the context of fixing tariffs for the distribution of
electricity for the 2008-2013 period (the “Tariff-Setting Process”), with which EEGSA
disagreed.° That process has given rise to different proceedings:

i. First, in August 2008, EEGSA initiated proceedings before the Guatemalan
administrative and judicial courts against the National Electric Energy Commission
(Comisién Nacional de Energia Eléctrica or the “CNEE”),* arguing that the
CNEE’s resolutions determining the tariffs were not in accordance with
Guatemalan law.> These proceedings included three constitutional amparo
actions,° which were finally decided against EEGSA by the Guatemalan
Constitutional Court.’

ii. Second, in March 2009, Iberdrola initiated an arbitration against Guatemala before
the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID”), invoking
provisions of the Treaty (“Iberdrola I’). The Iberdrola I tribunal declined
jurisdiction with respect to all of Iberdrola’s claims with the exception of its claim

The CNEE is a “a technical organ of the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM), in charge of, among other
things, (i) defining the transmission and distribution tariffs and the methodology for calculating them; (ii)

monitoring to ensure the tariff studies presented reflected only efficient, non-excessive costs related to the
activity of electricity distribution; and (iii) issuing the technical norms for the electric subsector.”; Mem., 9

for denial of justice, which the tribunal dismissed on the merits.* Specifically, the
Iberdrola I tribunal found that the facts alleged by Iberdrola, even if proven, could
not amount to a breach of the Treaty.” Instead, the tribunal concluded that
Iberdrola’s claims involved issues of domestic law which were not covered by the
Treaty dispute resolution clause. It thus denied jurisdiction.

iii. Third, Iberdrola initiated annulment proceedings pursuant to Article 52 of the
ICSID Convention with respect to the Iberdrola I award. By a majority, the ad hoc
Committee denied Iberdrola’s annulment request. !°

B. Overview of the Respondent’s case and request for relief

Essentially, the Respondent’s case is that the dispute before this Tribunal has already been
litigated before the Guatemalan courts and arbitrated before an ICSID tribunal and must
thus end now.!! By initiating this arbitration, the Claimant is said to have committed three
abuses of process, any one of which suffices for the Tribunal to decline jurisdiction and
impose upon the Claimant an exemplary and deterrent award on costs.!*

Citing decisions of the International Court of Justice (the “ICJ’”), the Respondent submits
that, to ensure the preservation of social peace, the stability of legal relations requires that
litigation must come to an end.'? It thus contends that, even if the dispute on the Tariff-
Setting Process did not end with the decisions of the Guatemalan Constitutional Court,
fairness demands that the Claimant should cease its actions against Guatemala after the
Iberdrola I award and decision on annulment. In violation of this principle, the Claimant
has brought these UNCITRAL proceedings. In doing so, it has engaged in the following
three abuses of process:

i. The Claimant has brought this claim in open disregard for the negative effect of res
judicata. The Claimant has brought a claim based on the same facts and between
the same parties, and its attempts to distinguish the legal basis of the claim are
unavailing. In Jberdrola I, the Claimant brought claims under the Treaty (although
the tribunal held that, even if proven, the facts alleged were not susceptible of
constituting Treaty breaches). The triple identity test has been met and the Tribunal
must decline jurisdiction. Were the Tribunal to hold otherwise, it should conclude

that Iberdrola’s international law claims are precluded in application of the principle

of concentration of arguments and claims, according to which it is the claimant’s
duty to invoke all of its legal arguments when submitting its first claim.'*

ii. Alternatively, the Claimant has violated the fork in the road clause of the Treaty
(Article 11(2)). Although this clause requires a claimant to bring suit in one forum
only, the Claimant has acted in three fora: the first instance court and then the
Constitutional Court of Guatemala, ICSID and this Tribunal. This breach of the
fork-in-the-road provision is the ground for the counterclaim.!> Even if Article
11(2) of the Treaty were not a fork-in-the-road provision, the Respondent argues
that Article 26 of the ICSID Convention precludes the Claimant from bringing this
arbitration.

iii. Alternatively, the claim amounts to harassment and abuse of right. As explained by
the Orascom tribunal, “the initiation of multiple proceedings to recover for
essentially the same economic harm would entail the exercise of rights for purposes
that are alien to those for which these rights were established.”!°

The Respondent also argues in the alternative that Iberdrola’s actions violate Article 53(2)
of the ICSID Convention and, as a result, Iberdrola’s claims are excluded from this
Tribunal’s jurisdiction. The fact that this Tribunal has been constituted under the 1976
UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules is no impediment to reaching that conclusion.'’

In the final alternative, if the Tribunal were to consider that Iberdrola can reformulate its
claims under the Treaty, these claims would still be beyond the Tribunal’s jurisdiction
because they relate exclusively to Guatemalan law. In addition, this dispute was already
resolved by the Guatemalan courts and the Tribunal cannot act as an appellate court in
relation to determinations of national law rendered by the Respondent's courts.'®

The Respondent also raises a counterclaim, arguing that the Tribunal must sanction the
Claimant for its systematic and abusive resubmission of the same claim. Under basic
notions of justice, it would be insufficient for the Tribunal to decline jurisdiction and
impose costs; the Tribunal must also uphold the counterclaim and award damages to the
Respondent. More specifically, the Respondent argues that the Claimants’ violation of
the Treaty’s fork in the road clause at Article 11(2) has caused it damage, for which the
Respondent seeks compensation.'?

C. Overview of the Claimant’s case and request for relief

The Claimant submits that its claims are treaty claims, which it is entitled to have decided,
and that neither res judicata nor the other principles invoked by the Respondent bar the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

First, the Claimant argues that certain measures taken by Guatemala during EEGSA’s
2008-2013 tariff review amount to “free-standing violations of the Guatemala-Spain BIT,
through arbitrary, unfair, and inequitable acts of Guatemalan authorities, in breach of
fundamental due process principles.”?*

Second, the Claimant argues that, as a protected investor under the BIT (a characterization
that is undisputed), it has “an international law right to have its treaty claims against those
measures decided on their merits.” It concedes that it is only entitled to one resolution
on their merits, “no more but no less.”*+

Third, the Claimant denies that the Jberdrola I award precludes it from bringing the
present claims for the following reasons:

i. With respect to the Respondent’s res judicata objection, the Claimant denies that
the triple identity test has been met. It does not deny that there is an identity of
parties and concedes that there is some overlap in the subject matter of the dispute
(in particular, it acknowledges that “the different claims arise from the same factual
matrix”). It argues, however, that the claims in this dispute are claims under the
Treaty, while the claims in Jberdrola I were found to be claims under domestic law,
and consequently not based on the same legal ground (causa petendi).”° In any
event, as explained in two recent decisions of the ICJ, aside from applying the triple
identity test, it is also necessary to ascertain the content of the prior decision. The
Iberdrola I tribunal found that the claims submitted to it, as formulated, were
national law claims. As the Claimant is now bringing treaty claims that are not

premised on breaches of national law, the present claims are not precluded by res
judicata.”

The Claimant denies that a “concentration of claims” argument is applicable. The
Respondent’s argument is based on national court decisions and is “contrary to the
basic principles that regulate res judicata in international law”, where “res judicata
applies only to what has been decided.”

The Respondent’s fork-in-the-road objection is similarly meritless. According to
the Claimant, Article 11(2) of the BIT does not contain a true fork in the road. Even
if it did, it would only apply to claims under Article 11 of the BIT. As none of the
claims submitted so far were considered to be claims under Article 11, the fork-in-
the-road argument cannot apply.”? Nor does Article 26 of the ICSID Convention
bar the present proceedings.

iv. The Claimant strongly denies having committed an abuse of process, noting that

this is a serious accusation that should be made only in extreme circumstances,
which are “clearly not present here”.*? The Claimant insists that it is “simply
exercising a right it has to resolve its investment disputes under the Guatemala-
Spain BIT through international arbitration, a way of resolving disputes to which
Guatemala expressly consented in Article 11 of that Treaty.”*! The Claimant
emphasizes that it has been open and transparent with the Respondent as to why the
Iberdrola I decision did not prevent Iberdrola’s treaty claims from being finally
determined on their merits.*?

The Claimant further rejects the Respondent’s alternative objection, i.e., that the
Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae. The Claimant insists that its claims
before this Tribunal are “treaty claims not premised on any breach of national
law.?33

The Claimant thus submits that this Tribunal has full jurisdiction to hear Iberdrola’s
claims, all of which are admissible, and it must hear them and resolve them on their
merits.**

As to the Respondent’s counterclaim, the Claimant contends that the Tribunal lacks
jurisdiction to entertain it, and that, by submitting the counterclaim, the Respondent has
accepted the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over the claims. Were the Tribunal to uphold
jurisdiction on this matter, the Respondent has failed to submit a proper counterclaim.
Even if the Tribunal were to consider that a proper counterclaim has been filed, it lacks
merit.

For the foregoing reasons, the Claimant requests the following relief in response to the
Respondent’s preliminary objections:°>

In light of the above, Iberdrola respectfully requests the Tribunal to:
(i) Declare that it is competent to hear Iberdrola’s claims;
(ii) Declare that Iberdrola’s claims are admissible.

(iii) Consequently, dismiss all Objections on Jurisdiction and Admissibility
raised by Guatemala;

(iv) Order Guatemala to bear all costs incurred by Iberdrola in relation to
Guatemala’s Objections on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, plus interest; and

(v) Order any other relief that the Tribunal may deem fit and proper.
In its Rejoinder, the Claimant updated its request for relief as follows:*°

(iv) Dismiss Guatemala’s counterclaim;

(v) In due course, find that Guatemala has breached the standards of fair and
equitable treatment, full protection and security, the international minimum

Objections on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, plus interest; and

(vii) Order any other relief that the Tribunal may deem just.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

The facts summarized below are provided to give context to the Parties’ jurisdictional
arguments. The Tribunal has assessed these facts to the extent necessary to determine the
issues of jurisdiction and admissibility raised by the Parties.

A. The Claimant’s investment

Between 1993 and 1997, Guatemala amended the legal framework applicable to the
electricity sector, allowing for the participation of private actors. Under the LGE”” and its
Regulation of 1998 (“RLGE”),;* distributors of electricity were compensated as follows:

The distributors of electricity in Guatemala, such as EEGSA, were paid for
their services (and for the investments necessary to carry out those services)
through a component of the tariff, the Valor Agregado de Distibucién or VAD.
The VAD of each distributor, including EEGSA, was to be determined
through a procedure established under the General Electricity Law of
Guatemala (LGE) and its regulation (RLGE). The procedure contemplated the
participation of the distributor (in this case EEGSA) in the determination of
the VAD and the intervention of an Expert Commission of three members
(appointed by the distributor and the regulator) should discrepancies arise
between the distributor and the regulator.°°

According to the Claimant, the system enshrined two important principles aimed at
attracting foreign investment in the electricity sector: the principles of participation and
neutrality in the determination of tariffs.”

The Respondent further explains that tariffs were to be calculated every five years on the
basis of the sum of the weighted price of all of the distributor’s purchases related to the
entry to the distribution network and the Valor Agregado de Distribucién (“VAD”).*!
Each distributor was to calculate the components of the VAD through a tariff study
entrusted to an engineering firm prequalified by the CNEE under the Terms of Reference
by the CNEE (the “ToR”).*? The CNEE was then to review such tariff studies and, if
necessary, formulate observations. In case of disagreement, the distributor and the CNEE
were required to appoint a three-member expert commission (the “Expert Commission”),
which would rule on those disagreements, according to the Respondent in a non-binding
manner.*?

This was the legal framework in which the Claimant decided to invest in Guatemala.
Specifically, when Guatemala decided to privatize EEGSA in 1997, Iberdrola joined
forces with TECO, a US company, and EDP, with which they formed the Consortium
defined in paragraph 46, and ultimately acquired the majority of EEGSA in September
1998. The value of EEGSA (ie., the price paid to the government for it in the
privatization) was calculated in accordance with the regulatory framework offered by
Guatemala.‘> The Consortium held and managed the company through an intermediary
company called Distribucién Eléctrica Centroamericana S.A. (“DECA”, and later
“DECA II”). In total, the partners held 80.8% of EEGSA, and Iberdrola’s indirect
shareholding was 39.64%. The rest was held by other shareholders, including the State of
Guatemala (14%).*6

B. The facts leading to the dispute
For purposes of the jurisdictional phase, the Parties summarize the main facts as follows.

The Claimant alleges that the VAD for the initial period after the privatization (1999-
2003) was established on the basis of a transitional rule, using the values of other
countries following comparable methodologies. The procedure for the determination of
the VAD under the LGE and RLGE was applicd for the first time in the tariff review for
the period 2003-2008.‘” The Claimant does not appear to have complaints in this respect.

However, the Claimant submits that “[t]hings changed in the tariff setting process for the
2008-2013 period. Indeed, from the very beginning Guatemala made it clear that its
intention was to decrease the electricity tariff. The sequence of events that followed was
directed to fulfil at all costs this political goal.”** The Claimant further asserts that the
Ministry of Energy and Mines modified the RLGE to allow the CNEE to set the tariff in
certain exceptional cases without the distributor’s participation.*? During this phase on
preliminary objections, the Respondent has not disputed this allegation.

It is the Claimant’s further submission that the CNEE used the ToR for the independent
consultant Mercados Energéticos who had to calculate the VAD® to predetermine the
result of the consultant’s study on the VAD. According to the Claimant, the CNEE finally
abandoned this strategy in the light of the challenges initiated by EEGSA before the local
courts.*! The Respondent opposes that Mercados Energéticos were appointed to move
forward with the Tariff-Setting Process and meet the applicable deadlines.>? It confirms
that EEGSA withdrew its court challenges upon accepting the modified version of the
ToR, which tasked Bates White with preparing new preliminary-stage reports.°°

The Claimant also contends that the CNEE sought to determine the outcome of Bates
White’s study™ by trying to force the consultant to incorporate comments in its study
with which Bates White did not agree. In the Claimant’s view, the CNEE rejected the
study prepared by Bates White because it had not incorporated all such comments.°°

The Respondent admits filing several observations concerning Bates White’s tariff study.
To the CNEE’s surprise, Bates White disregarded most of the observations,°° which
prompted the CNEE to reject the study.*”

During the constitution of the Expert Commission,** so the Claimant says, Guatemala
tried to influence its composition by modifying the LGE. In the original drafting of the
tule, EEGSA and the CNEE were to have each appointed a member and the third one

would be appointed by common agreement. However, with the modification of the LGE,
in the event of disagreement, the third member would be appointed by Guatemala.*?
While the Respondent does not challenge this allegation, it notes that, as a matter of fact,
the third member of the Expert Commission was appointed by mutual agreement.

The Claimant also contends that the CNEE subsequently held ex parte communications
with one member of the CNEE and dissolved the Commission when its work had not
been completed.°! The Respondent replies that the Expert Commission was dissolved “by

virtue of having met the objective of its appointment”.

Thereafter, so the Claimant alleges, through Resolutions 144, 145, and 146-2008 the
CNEE completely ignored the report of the Expert Commission and discarded the VAD
study of Bates White (although this study had been corrected to reflect the conclusions of
the Expert Commission). Instead of relying on Bates White’s study, the CNEE approved
a different VAD on the basis of a study prepared by a company called Sigla, which was
engaged by the CNEE and did not consider the Expert Commission’s report.

For the Respondent, the CNEE relied on the Sigla® study because the new one by Bates
White failed to acknowledge some of the Expert Commission’s main observations.

C. Proceedings arising from this factual matrix

According to the Claimant, these facts gave rise to proceedings before the local courts in
which EEGSA challenged the CNEE’s measures and to ICSID proceedings in which
Iberdrola claimed that Guatemala had breached the BIT.

1. Domestic proceedings initiated by EEGSA

In the month following the passing of Resolutions 144, 145, and 146/2008, EEGSA (not
Iberdrola) initiated several local court proceedings against the CNEE (not the State of
Guatemala). The bases of those claims were exclusively alleged to be breaches of
Guatemalan law by the CNEE. ®’ The first instance courts ruled in favor of EEGSA on

24 February 2010, the Constitutional Court of Guatemala ruled in favor of the CNEE.®*

2. ‘IberdrolaI

In parallel with the local court proceedings, on 16 March 2009, following the expiration
of the six-month cooling-off period under the BIT, Iberdrola initiated ICSID proceedings
against Guatemala. The Claimant’s request for relief is quoted in Section V.C.2 below.
Essentially, the Claimant sought declarations that Guatemala had breached its obligation
under the expropriation and fair and equitable (“FET”) standards enshrined in the BIT
and claimed compensation for the harm caused by those breaches.

The Iberdrola I tribunal declined jurisdiction over all of Iberdrola’s claims save one
(denial of justice), which it dismissed on the merits.

The Iberdrola I tribunal’s reasoning will be discussed in the analysis section below. It
suffices to mention here that, on the basis of Article 11 of the BIT, the tribunal observed
that Guatemala’s consent to arbitrate was limited to disputes over “matters regulated” by
the Treaty.” After reviewing each of the claims, it concluded that, as a result of the
manner in which the Claimant had pleaded its claims, it had actually only raised claims
under local law as opposed to claims under the BIT and dismissed the claim.”!

3. The annulment proceedings against the Iberdrola I Award

On 11 December 2012, Iberdrola initiated annulment proceedings against the Iberdrola I
Award under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention. In support of its request for annulment,
the Claimant argued that the tribunal had manifestly exceeded its power (Article 52(b)),
had seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(d)), and had
failed to state its reasons (Article 52(e)).’”

The ad hoc committee, by a majority, denied the request for annulment. It held that none
of the grounds invoked were well-founded.’ Specifically, it gave the following reasons
for dismissing Iberdrola’s request:

i. The ad hoc committee found that the Jberdrola I tribunal did not manifestly exceed
its power. It noted that arbitral tribunals have the authority to characterize the claims

submitted by the parties from a legal perspective, and that the Iberdrola I tribunal’s
approach in this regard, while strict, had been reasonable.”

ii. The Jberdrola I tribunal did not depart from any fundamental rule of procedure.
First, because the Iberdrola I tribunal had the authority to make a procedural
decision, such as ruling that the claimant could not modify the relief sought after
the hearing.”> Second, the Iberdrola I tribunal addressed in its award each of
Iberdrola’s claims.”

iii. The ad hoc committee found, after reviewing the structure of the reasoning of the
Iberdrola I tribunal in its Award, that the tribunal had properly stated its reasons.””

As discussed below,” the Parties disagree on the interpretation of the ad hoc committee’s
decision, and on whether it confirms that the negative decision of the Jberdrola I tribunal
on jurisdiction carries res judicata effects.

4. Institution of the present arbitration

On 15 November 2017, the Claimant initiated the present UNCITRAL arbitration under
the BIT.”? The Claimant's prayers for relief are quoted in Section III.C above and further
discussed in the analysis (Section V.C.2). Essentially, Iberdrola seeks declarations that
the Tribunal has jurisdiction over this dispute® and that the Respondent has violated its
Treaty obligations in respect of expropriation and FET,*! as well as compensation for the
damage resulting from these violations.*”

5. The Teco arbitrations

In October 2010, TECO (one of Iberdrola’s partners in the investment in EEGSA)
initiated an investment arbitration against Guatemala under the provisions of the
Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR) based on the
same factual matrix (“Teco I’). The Teco J tribunal held that these facts constituted a
breach of the protection standards of the CAFTA-DR.*

It is noteworthy in the present context that the Teco J tribunal stressed that “[t]he fact that,
in order to assess the Respondent’s alleged responsibility in international law, the Arbitral
Tribunal will have to decide certain points of interpretation of the regulatory framework
by applying Guatemalan law, does not and cannot deprive the Arbitral Tribunal of its
jurisdiction.”** The tribunal also mentioned that its “task is not and cannot be to review
the findings made by the courts of Guatemala under Guatemalan law”; it is “rather to
apply international law to the facts in dispute, including the content of Guatemalan law
as interpreted by the Constitutional Court.”*>

The Teco I tribunal ordered Guatemala to pay approximately USD 21 million in damages.
Both TECO and Guatemala initiated annulment proceedings against the award. On 5
April 2016, the ad hoc committee annulled part of the award relating to damages and
otherwise denied the annulment.

While the Claimant relies on the Teco J tribunal’s findings to support its case, the
Respondent alleges that said arbitration proceeding is not relevant for the case at hand,
notably because the applicable treaties are different.*° The Tribunal addresses the Parties’
respective positions on this issue below.*’

On 3 October 2016, TECO initiated a new ICSID arbitration concerning damages that
were not granted by the Teco J tribunal (“Teco II’). The Teco JI tribunal rendered its
award on 13 May 2020.°* While the Claimant brought this fact to the Tribunal’s attention,
neither party requested the opportunity to make comments on this award. The Tribunal
has reviewed this award but has not found it helpful for its analysis.

JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY
A. The Respondent’s position

The Respondent objects to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, and to the admissibility of the
claims, on the following grounds: the claims are barred by the principle of res judicata;
in the alternative, they are precluded by the doctrine of concentration of arguments; in the
further alternative, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction because the Claimant has violated the
Treaty’s fork-in-the-road clause and the claims are precluded by Article 26 of the ICSID
Convention; in the further alternative, the claims amount to a harassment of the
Respondent and an abuse of right; in the further alternative, the Claimant’s actions violate
Article 53(2) of the ICSID Convention and, as a result, Iberdrola’s claims are excluded
from this Tribunal’s jurisdiction; finally and also in the alternative, were the Tribunal to

consider that Iberdrola can reformulate its claims under the Treaty, these claims would
likewise be beyond the Tribunal’s jurisdiction as they relate exclusively to Guatemalan
law.

The Tribunal will start its analysis with the main objections, i.e. res judicata. It will
review the other objections if necessary or appropriate depending on the outcome of its
examination of res judicata.

1. Res judicata

The Respondent contends that the principle of res judicata, which is a “well-established
and generally recognized principle of law”,*? bars the Claimant from restating claims that
have already been decided. The Iberdrola I tribunal already decided the claims submitted
to this Tribunal, and the Claimant is precluded from bringing them for a second time. The
Respondent raises res judicata as its primary objection and appears to argue that it
precludes the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

The Respondent argues that (a) if there is triple identity, decisions on jurisdiction have
res judicata effect, (b) the Iberdrola I tribunal dismissed the claims that have been
submitted here, and (c) the res judicata principle prevents the Claimant from resubmitting
these claims.

a. The principle of res judicata applies to decisions on jurisdiction

Relying on jurisprudence from the ICJ and other international tribunals, the Respondent
submits that “[t]he principle of res judicata seeks to prevent a decision by a court or
tribunal — which must be final with regard to the parties — from being reopened in new
judicial or arbitral proceedings.” This principle applies both to arbitral awards on the
merits of the dispute and to decisions and awards on jurisdictional objections.?! For
instance, the ICJ stated in the Genocide Case that “once the Court has made a
determination, whether on a matter of the merits of a dispute brought before it, or on a
question of its own jurisdiction, that determination is definitive both for the parties to the
case, in respect of the case (Article 59 of the Statute), and for the Court itself in the context

facie finding related to the existence of treaty breaches, which, by its very nature, can only be preliminary
at the jurisdictional stage”).

of that case.”°? ICSID tribunals have even found that decisions prior to an award also
have res judicata effect when part of the same arbitral proceedings.”

To establish whether res judicata is met, international courts and tribunals have
consistently applied the triple identity test, which requires (i) identity of parties (persona),
(ii) identity of object (petitum) and (iii) identity of cause of action or legal grounds (causa
petendi).°* The Respondent denies that the res judicata effect of an award is limited to
what the tribunal decided “expressly or by necessary implication.”®> The formalistic and
legalistic interpretation of res judicata advanced by the Claimant has been widely
reassessed by international jurisprudence and doctrine in favor of a flexible and pragmatic
approach.”°

b. ‘The Iberdrola I tribunal dismissed the claims with res judicata effect

The Respondent emphasizes that the Jberdrola I Award dismissed the same claims
submitted in this arbitration with res judicata effect.

First, the Respondent contends that the triple identity test is met here:
i. It is undisputed that the parties in this case and in Jberdrola I are the same.”

ii. In both cases, the Claimant has requested the tribunal to hold that Guatemala had
violated Article 3 of the Treaty and order the State to pay compensation.”® There is
thus identity of petitum.

iii. Finally, there is identity of factual and legal bases, and thus identity of cause of
action.”? Both cases rely on the same set of facts related to the Tariff-Setting Process
and, in particular, to CNEE Resolutions 144-2008, 145-2008 and 146-2008. Indeed,
the Claimant has accepted that both cases are based on the same facts. Crucially, in

Iberdrola I the Claimant invoked the same Treaty breaches that it is invoking now

and pleaded first before the tribunal and then before the ad hoc committee that its
claims were made under international law.!°

For the Respondent, the fact that the Jberdrola J tribunal found that the claims were not
claims that could be advanced under the Treaty is irrelevant to determining whether there
is an identity of cause of action. The decisive factor is whether the claims that the
Claimant submitted in the first proceedings and in the present one are identical. The
Claimant has expressly acknowledged that it initiated Jberdrola I “to have its international
law claims heard and determined,”!°! and there is no doubt that it invoked the Treaty to
support its prayer for relief there, as it is doing now. The requirement of identity of cause
of action bars the Claimant from raising the same claim a second time “in a new light.” 1°
The Claimant’s reliance on the contract/treaty claim distinction is irrelevant, as Iberdrola
never attempted to bring a contract (or national law) claim in Iberdrola I.

In the alternative, what matters is whether the claims in Iberdrola I were based on the
facts alleged in this second arbitration, which is undisputed.'°°

Second, contrary to the Claimant’s arguments, the Iberdrola I Award was not limited to
finding that the claims submitted by Iberdrola were national law claims because of the
“form” in which they were formulated, nor did the tribunal fail to analyze “whether the
facts were an eligible basis for the dispute under the Treaty or under international law.” !°*
The Iberdrola I tribunal did analyze the facts alleged by the Claimant and dismissed the
claims.!° It correctly found that the facts alleged, if proven, could not amount to a
violation of the Treaty, but at best, to a breach of domestic law that was outside the
jurisdiction granted by the Treaty. To reach this conclusion, the Tribunal took into
account all of the Parties’ arguments and evidence, including all factual and legal issues
relevant to this matter.!°° More specifically, the Jberdrola I tribunal found that the CNEE
and the Guatemalan courts, acting within their authority under local law, had interpreted
that law in a particular way, and that it thus had no jurisdiction to judge this interpretation
under international law, as this would require it to act as a court of appeal. As a result, the
tribunal found that the facts invoked by Iberdrola could only give rise to a denial of justice
claim.!7

The Respondent denies that the res judicata effect of the Iberdrola I Award is limited to
what the tribunal decided “expressly or by necessary implication.” However, even if the
Tribunal were to adopt this restrictive and formalistic position, Iberdrola’s claims in this
arbitration would still be res judicata. To determine the scope of res judicata, it is
necessary to take into account the reasoning behind the operative part of the award and
the parties’ pleadings throughout the course of the proceeding.'°* In this respect,
Guatemala stresses that:

i. The parties to Jberdrola I thoroughly debated whether or not the facts invoked by
the Claimant constituted a dispute under the Treaty. The discussion was not about
the “form” in which the claims had been submitted. Indeed, the tribunal requested
the parties to indicate in their post-hearing briefs whether the facts that they
considered proved had produced consequences under the BIT or under international
law. The Claimant made colossal efforts to show this.!?

ii. The Jberdrola I tribunal analyzed whether the facts alleged by the Claimant, if
proven, could amount to a violation of the Treaty.'!° After assessing these facts, as
set out in the parties’ pleadings and evidence, the tribunal found that “the foundation
for Iberdrola’s claim” was a dispute under Guatemalan law, and that Iberdrola had
failed to show which “acts of authority” by Guatemala could constitute violations
of the Treaty.!"!

iii. The Iberdrola I tribunal also analyzed Iberdrola’s legal arguments and found that
there was no connection between the facts alleged and the standards invoked. Nor
were there any acts of imperium which under international law may constitute
violations of treaty rights.!!”

In any event, the parties’ positions summarized in the [berdrola I Award show that the
tribunal did take into consideration the same facts and arguments that the Claimant now
seeks to submit before this Tribunal.!'

The Respondent further argues that the annulment decision (as well as the Claimant’s
arguments during the annulment proceedings) corroborates the res judicata effect of the
Iberdrola I Award. During the annulment proceedings, the Claimant focused its efforts
on demonstrating that the facts set forth in Jberdrola I involved a dispute under

international law. Specifically, the Claimant devoted an entire section of its annulment
memorial to the reasons why the facts it had invoked gave rise to a dispute under the
Treaty;'* it identified 16 facts that were said to have led to a breach of the obligation to
afford FET;!!> it submitted two appendices to support its arguments, one explaining the
connection between the alleged facts and the violation of the Treaty standards, and
another with its responses to Guatemala’s jurisdictional objections; it also filed an expert
opinion by Prof. Rudolph Dolzer on the international nature of its claims.

The ad hoc committee concluded that the tribunal had acted within its authority by legally
characterizing the claims of the Claimant as a dispute arising under domestic law, and
that it was thus inappropriate to annul the Jberdrola I Award. The ad hoc Committee’s
decision thus further “affirmed the [final and unappealable nature] of this award pursuant
to the provisions of the ICSID Convention.”!!®

The very fact that the Claimant applied for annulment of the Iberdrola I award
demonstrates that the Claimant is well aware of the res judicata effect of that award, or
else “it would not have felt the need to apply for the annulment.”!!

c. The res judicata principle prevents the Claimant from resubmitting its
claims

For the Respondent, the res judicata principle prevents the Claimant from resubmitting
its claims. The Iberdrola I tribunal has already ruled on “whether, prima facie, the
fundamental basis for Iberdrola’s claim in this case is the Treaty”, which Iberdrola argues
is this Tribunal’s task.!!® According to the Respondent, the Claimant seeks to “have this
Tribunal review and overturn the decision in the Jberdrola I Award — this time accepting
the position that the Claimant advanced throughout the entire course of the prior arbitral
proceeding. Consequently, for all practical purposes, this Tribunal would be acting as an
appellate tribunal, in clear violation of the cardinal principle of res judicata and the
provisions of the ICSID Convention.”!!9

Contrary to the Claimant’s suggestion, the res judicata principle precludes the Claimant
from refiling its claims after those claims were rejected on jurisdictional grounds. The
Iberdrola I decision is final and cannot be remedied in a subsequent proceeding. Whether
the Claimant (or, for the sake of argument, this Tribunal) disagrees with the Iberdrola I
tribunal’s reasoning is irrelevant: the fact is that a duly constituted tribunal with the
authority to reach a finding on the Claimant’s claims has rendered its decision.

If the Tribunal were to accept Iberdrola’s position, it would set a dangerous precedent, as
it would allow investors to question decisions on lack of jurisdiction. For instance, if a
tribunal decided that a particular investment was not protected under the relevant treaty,
the claimant could (erroneously) call for a new tribunal under the treaty in the hopes that
that tribunal would reach a different outcome on its jurisdiction. This would jeopardize
the finality of arbitral awards and the competence of international courts to rule on their
jurisdiction.'?°

In any event, even if the Tribunal accepted the Claimant’s views, the defects in the
Claimant’s legal strategy cannot be corrected in this arbitration.!?! For policy reasons, the
Claimant may not cure its claims by reformulating them in another forum. This would be
contrary to principles of finality, efficiency, justice, legality, loyalty, procedural
diligence, equality of arms, procedural economy and good public management, which
have been recognized by national courts as well as international tribunals.!”? Citing
Apotex III, the Respondent argues that “were it so easy to side-step the application of res
judicata, the doctrine would be largely meaningless under international law [...]. The
costs and time required for investor-state arbitrations, already not inconsiderable, would
be multiplied several times over if unsuccessful claimants could persuade later tribunals
to restrict the effect of earlier awards by simply reformulating their claims and arguments.
As already described, there is a strong interest, both public and private, in bringing an end
to a dispute by one final and binding arbitration award.”!7°

. Regardless of policy, the Respondent submits that the way in which the Claimant

formulated its claims in Iberdrola I is not a jurisdictional defect that can be cured by
bringing newly formulated claims. The Respondent accepts that certain jurisdictional
defects can be cured, but they refer only to procedural requirements to submit a dispute
to arbitration that would otherwise render the claim premature (such as the cooling-off
period or waiver requirements). Neither Waste Management II, nor Mobil v. Canada II,
nor Nicaragua v. Colombia II support the proposition that a claimant might correct a
defect related to the way in which its claims have been formulated. To the contrary, these
cases confirm that only a premature claim can be resubmitted. That is not the case here:
claims that have been badly formulated are not premature; nothing prevents the claimant
from submitting them correctly from the outset. !74

d. Relevance and content of Swiss international arbitration law

(i) Should the Tribunal consider Swiss international arbitration law
on res judicata in addition to international law?

The Respondent submits that Swiss law should be taken into consideration by the
Tribunal, in addition to the applicable international law. The Respondent acknowledges
that “investment treaty tribunals seated in Switzerland are not automatically bound to
apply the law of their seat to res judicata objections”; rather, the applicable law (including
to the issue of res judicata) is defined at Article 11(3) of the Treaty, which points to the
terms of the Treaty, the law of the host State and international law.!*> That said, the
Respondent contends that “the law of the seat should be taken into consideration to
determine whether or not a future award could be set aside in the jurisdiction serving as
the seat of the arbitration proceedings as part of the tribunal’s duty to make every effort
to render an award enforceable at law”.!”°

The seat of the arbitration being Geneva (Switzerland), the Tribunal should take into
consideration Swiss international arbitration law when assessing the Respondent’s res
judicata objection.'”’ In particular, pursuant to Article 176 of the Swiss Private
International Law Act (the “PILA”), Chapter 12 of the PILA would govern any annulment
proceedings in Switzerland.

(ii) What is the content of Swiss international arbitration law about
res judicata of negative jurisdictional awards?

The Respondent makes seven main points with respect to the content of Swiss
international arbitration law on the notion of res judicata and its application to negative
jurisdictional awards.

First, the Respondent submits that, under Swiss law, negative awards on jurisdiction are
final awards, and as such carry res judicata effects.'”* Likewise, awards (including ICSID

recognized and enforced in Switzerland.!”° As “[i]t is beyond any doubt that ICSID
awards can be recognized and enforced in Switzerland, a Contracting State to the ICSID
Convention”, the Respondent argues that the “the Iberdrola I ICSID award which
declined jurisdiction over Claimant’s claim for a breach of Article III of the Treaty
produces res judicata effects in Switzerland.”'*°

Second, according to the Respondent, under Swiss law the doctrine of res judicata applies
where the parties to the dispute are the same and the subject matter of the dispute is the
same, which in turn depends on whether the dispute is based on the same set of facts.!*!
These requirements are met here: the parties, the facts and the relief sought — a declaration
that Guatemala breached Article 3 of the Treaty — are identical in both arbitration
proceedings. 3?

Third, the Respondent submits that, under Swiss law, a negative award on jurisdiction
carries both negative and positive res judicata effects. The negative effect of res judicata
“entails that the same claim cannot be brought again in other proceedings”, while the
positive effect of res judicata “entails that, if an adjudicator has to decide a preliminary
issue that has already been finally decided in the dispositive part of an earlier award, that
adjudicator is bound by the earlier award, and must implement it in its own decision.”!>
The consequences of these principles for this case are two-fold: the Claimant cannot bring
its claim for a breach of Article 3 of the Treaty again, and this Tribunal is bound by the
Iberdrola I award’s decision to decline jurisdiction over the Claimant’s claims for a
breach of Article 3 of the Treaty .!*4

Fourth, the Respondent contends that, “under Swiss law, the res judicata effect of an
arbitral award attaches to the dispositive part of said award”,!*> but does “does not extend

Iberdrola J tribunal found that it had no ratione materiae jurisdiction over the Claimant’s
claims.!*” This decision carries res judicata effects, irrespective of the reasons underlying
the Tribunal’s decision.!** Accordingly, “[e]ven if the Iberdrola I tribunal’s reasoning
that Claimant’s claims are domestic claims were to be considered incorrect by this
Tribunal (quod non), the Iberdrola I tribunal’s decision that Claimant’s claims were
ratione materiae outside of the scope of Article 11 of the Treaty retains its res judicata
effects.”159

. Fifth, the Respondent contends that, “under Swiss law, a party may not bring a new action

with respect to the same dispute by relying on facts that it did not invoke, but could and
should have invoked, during the first proceedings”; “[a] party can only bring a new action
with respect to new facts, i.e., facts that have arisen after the moment up until which that
party could have validly invoked new facts in the first proceedings”.'“° In other words, if
the new claim arises out of new facts then there is no identity of subject matter under
Swiss law.'*! The Respondent notes in this regard that the Claimant’s claims in this
arbitration do not result from new facts.!47

Sixth, the Respondent contends that, “under Swiss law, a subsequent award will be
annulled if rendered in violation of the res judicata effect of a prior award,”'** because
violations of res judicata are considered to be contrary to procedural public policy, which
is a ground for annulment under Article 190(e) PILA. As a result, if the Tribunal were to
allow the Claimant’s case to proceed, the award would be annulled under Article 190
PILA for being contrary to procedural public policy.!“+

Seventh, the Respondent argues that, as under international law, under Swiss law the
Claimant’s resubmission of its claim constitutes an abuse of process which would be
contrary to Article 2.2 of the Swiss Civil Code.'*°

2. Concentration of claims

. Even if the Tribunal were to find that the Claimant can reformulate its treaty claims to

evade the res judicata principle, the Respondent submits that these claims are still
precluded and outside of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction by application of the concentration
of claims principle. Pursuant to this principle, a claimant is required to submit all available
claims related to a particular dispute when initiating judicial or arbitral proceedings. If it
fails to do so, it is barred from raising its claim in subsequent proceedings.'** This
principle seeks to protect the general public interest as well as the interest of the parties,
in particular, the respondent’s interest of not being harassed by successive claims when
only one would suffice.!47

24. According to the Respondent, the concentration of claims principle has been recognized

125,

by both domestic courts and international tribunals. The Respondent relies on norms and
case law of the French courts (RLA-34 and RLA-35), the English courts in Henderson v.
Henderson (RLA-36), Guatemalan procedural norms and jurisprudence (RLA-38),
international courts and commissions such as in the Delgado (RLA-39) and the Machado
cases (RLA-40), and investment tribunals, for instance, in RSM v. Granada (RLA-41)
and Petrobart v. Kyrgyz Republic (DL-3/CLA-3).

In response to the Claimant’s arguments, the Respondent maintains that the principle of
concentration of arguments:

i. Is a general principle of law in the terms of Article 38.1 of the ICJ Statute. The
references to national law have been provided by way of example. The Respondent
cites more examples to support this assertion.!4*

ii. Has been applied by many international courts and tribunals!*’, as international law
condemns the practice of “claim-splitting”.

iii. Is consistent with the doctrine of “exhaustion of treaty process” (in French,
“épuisement des recours prévus dans le traité’) recognized by the ICJ. Like the res
judicata and the principle of ne bis in idem, this doctrine seeks to put an end to
disputes. Citing the Nicaragua v. Colombia case, the Respondent argues that,
“TuJnder this principle, ‘the renewed presentation of a claim previously examined
by the Court may be considered inadmissible if that claim relies on the same treaty
process as the basis of jurisdiction of the Court.’”!°

iv. Is supported by international legal authorities.!>!

3. Fork in the road

In the alternative, the Respondent contends that the fork-in-the-road clause of Article
11(2) of the Treaty bars the Claimant from raising anew claims that have already been
submitted to the Guatemalan courts and the Iberdrola I tribunal.'**

. The Respondent disputes the Claimant’s contention that the Respondent’s fork-in-the-

road objection fails because of its alternative nature. The Respondent agrees that if res
judicata and fork in the road were equivalent concepts, as construed by the Claimant, a
fork-in-the-road objection could not be alternative. However, these concepts are “neither
equivalent nor the ones advanced by Claimant.”!>? Accordingly, if the Tribunal were to
find that Iberdrola’s treaty claims were not decided with res judicata effect, they would
be barred under Article 11(2) of the Treaty.!**

28. In essence, the Respondent contends that Article 11(2) of the Treaty is a fork-in-the-road

clause (a), which has been triggered twice by the Claimant (b), and even if the Tribunal
were to consider otherwise, Article 26 of the ICSID Convention precludes the Claimant
from bringing this UNCITRAL proceeding arbitration (c).

a. Article 11(2) is a fork-in-the-road clause

29. Article 11(2) of the Treaty is a fork-in-the-road clause, so says the Respondent, because

130.

it expressly establishes that an investor may have recourse only to one forum for resolving
a dispute with the host State.

The Respondent emphasizes that Article 11(2) must be interpreted pursuant to its
wording, as established in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties

(“VCLT”) and confirmed in H&H.'* Article 11(2) provides for three alternative and
exclusive mechanisms for dispute resolution. The use of the expression “at the choice of
the investor” and of the conjunction “or” indicate that the three mechanisms are
alternative, so that the choice of one of these fora is irrevocable.'*©

This is consistent with the purpose of fork-in-the-road provisions. Relying on Prof.
Zachary Douglas’s writings, the Respondent contends that “[t]he rationale underpinning
the ‘fork in the road’ provision in investment treaties is clearly the avoidance of multiple
proceedings in multiple fora in relation to the same investment dispute. In more colloquial
terms, it is designed to prevent the investor having several bites at the cherry.”!57

According to the Respondent, the essential criterion for the application of the fork-in-the-
road clause under the Treaty is the submission of the “same dispute” to more than one
forum. The dispute is the same if “the respective claims share the same fundamental
basis;”!°8 it does not need to meet the triple identity test. Relying on Pantechniki v.
Albania, the Respondent argues that it suffices for the disputes to share the same
“normative source”.!°? The test is whether, if the Claimants’ case had been accepted in
domestic proceedings, “it would grant the Claimant exactly what it is seeking” in these
proceedings, and on the same “fundamental basis”.!©

This test has been applied by several investment tribunals, such as H&H v. Egypt,
Supervisién y Control v. Costa Rica, Chevron v. Ecuador and Salini Impregilo v.
Argentina.'*! A similar test has been developed by certain commentators, who argue that
disputes should be “substantially equivalent” for the fork-in-the-road clause to apply.!?

Nor is it necessary, according to the Respondent, for the parties to be identical for the
fork-in-the-road clause to be triggered. The fork-in-the-road clause will be triggered if

domestic proceedings have been initiated by the local company, and an investment
arbitration is later initiated by the investor or controlling shareholder, or by other
companies in the same corporate chain or in “privity of interest” with the claimant.! Nor
is there any authority to support the contention that the State per se needs to be a party to
the domestic proceedings.'™

b. The fork-in-the-road clause in Article 11(2) has been triggered twice

On this basis, the Respondent submits that the fork-in-the-road clause in Article 11(2) of
the BIT has been triggered twice. It was first triggered by EEGSA’s domestic amparo
proceedings against the CNEE. Those proceedings had the same fundamental basis and
factual matrix. Had Iberdrola prevailed in the domestic proceedings, it “would have been
granted exactly what it is sought before [this] Tribunal.”'® As to the parties to those
disputes, the Respondent argues that it suffices that Iberdrola exercised de facto control
over DECA II and thereby EEGSA, and was in any event in privity of interest with
EEGSA,'® and that a State agency (CNEE) was a party.'©”

Even if the Tribunal were to find that the local proceedings did not trigger the fork-in-
the-road clause, the “exact same dispute”, between the same parties, arising from the same
factual matrix, and seeking the same relief, has already been submitted to an ICSID
tribunal.'* The Respondent disputes that the Claimant can avoid the operation of the
fork-in-the-road clause by relying on the Jberdrola I Award. The application of the fork
in the road does not depend on the finding of another court or tribunal; rather, it depends
on the claims submitted. It is therefore irrelevant that the Jberdrola I tribunal decided that
the claims were not treaty claims.'©? The Claimant’s interpretation would run contrary to
the concept of fork in the road. In reliance on Ekosol, the Respondent argues that “the
very notion of a ‘fork’ in a road [...] implies the choice between two different paths,

rather than repeat travels down the identical path.”!”° That interpretation also runs in
conflict with the purpose of fork-in-the-road provisions, which is to avoid the duplication
of proceedings.!”!

c. Article 26 of the ICSID Convention bars the Claimant initiating these
UNCITRAL proceedings

Even if Article 11(2) of the Treaty were not a fork-in-the-road provision, the Respondent
argues that Article 26 of the ICSID Convention, by virtue of which consent to ICSID
arbitration excludes other remedies, precludes Iberdrola from bringing these proceedings.

. According to the Respondent, this means that by consenting to ICSID arbitration, the

parties waive their right to any other remedy, unless they agree otherwise, which they
have not done in the present case.!””

. As noted by Prof. Schreuer, the exclusivity rule enshrined in Article 26 “operates from

the moment of valid consent.”!” In the ICSID system, this occurs when the investor
submits a request for arbitration to the Centre. Here, the Claimant consented to ICSID
arbitration when it submitted its request for arbitration to ICSID on 17 April 2009 in the
Iberdrola I proceedings. From then onwards, the Claimant could not withdraw its consent
unilaterally.

The Claimant cannot now argue that, because its claims were not decided on the merits,
this consent can somehow be undone. By consenting to ICSID arbitration, the Claimant
consented to a tribunal determining its competence over the dispute and the merits of the
claims. The Jberdrola I tribunal ruled on the dispute by dismissing the Claimant’s denial
of justice claims on the merits and declining jurisdiction over its remaining claims.

Because it consented to submit the dispute to ICSID, the Claimant waived its right to any
other remedy available under the Treaty, including UNCITRAL arbitration. Citing Prof.
Schreuer and Pey Casado v. Chile, the Respondent submits that, once there is a valid
consent given to ICSID arbitration, any other forum should decline jurisdiction unless a
contrary intention of the parties can be established.!”*

For the Respondent, the Jberdrola I tribunal’s characterization is immaterial to the
application of the exclusivity rule. What matters is “whether the arbitration submitted by
Claimant to both ICSID and UNCITRAL arbitration is the same.”!”> Relying on Tokios
Tokelés v. Ukraine and Quiborax v. Bolivia, the Respondent submits that Article 26
applies not only to identical claims, but also to claims related to the same subject
matter.'” Here, the claims in both arbitrations relate to the same subject matter, as “[o]n
the basis of these same facts, Claimant, in both proceedings, sought a declaration of
violation of Article 3 of the Treaty.”!7”

. Finally, Guatemala clarifies that its objection does not mean that Article 26 governs in

these proceedings or binds the Tribunal. What is binding is the Claimant’s waiver that is
enforceable by any adjudicator with a dispute already submitted to ICSID arbitration.!”8

For these reasons, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to enforce the Claimant’s waiver
of UNCITRAL arbitration, and to decline jurisdiction over the claims.!”

4. Abuse of process

Should the Tribunal dismiss the Respondent’s previous objections, the Respondent argues
that the doctrine of abuse of process or “abuso del derecho” (abuse of right), as the
Respondent refers to it in Spanish, would preclude the Claimant from raising its claims
again, which would be inadmissible.!*°

Citing Phoenix Action and Orascom, among other cases, the Respondent argues that the
principle of good faith prevents investors from abusing the rights granted under
international investment treaties and the prohibition of abuse of right bars the exercise of
aright, whether substantive or procedural, for purposes other than those for which it was
established.'*! It further specifies that the prohibition of abuse of process sanctions the
submission of multiple claims, even where the triple identity test is not strictly met, with
the inadmissibility of the claims.!*? The Respondent also points out that the abuse of

process theory applies irrespective of whether the proceedings are used for an illicit
purpose.!8°

To resolve any disputes with the host State, the Treaty grants investors recourse to (i) a
domestic court, (ii) an ad hoc tribunal established in accordance with the UNCITRAL
Rules 1976, or (iii) an arbitral tribunal constituted under the ICSID Convention. Here,
however, the Claimant abused its right of recourse to any of these fora by initiating
multiple proceedings against Guatemala on the basis of the Tariff-Setting Process.'**

The Respondent contends that “there is no question that the restatement of Iberdrola’s
claims under the Treaty ‘entail[s] the exercise of rights for purposes that are alien to those
for which these rights were established.’”'*> Accordingly, the Claimant’s Notice of
Arbitration is abusive and must be rejected.!*°

5. Article 53 of the ICSID Convention

Even if all of the previous objections were to fail, the Respondent contends that the claims
would still be excluded from the Tribunal’s jurisdiction because they violate Article 53
of the ICSID Convention.'*’ This provision stipulates that “[t]he award shall be binding
on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those
provided for in this Convention.” For the Respondent, this means that “the forms of
recourse established in the ICSID Convention are exclusive of each other [and] do not
include the possibility of appealing the factual or legal findings of an ICSID tribunal.” !**

. The Respondent contends that the Claimant has exhausted the available remedies against

the Iberdrola I Award by seeking the annulment of this award under Article 52 of the
ICSID Convention.!® There is no dispute that the Jberdrola I tribunal was competent to
determine whether the claims fell under the Treaty. After the Jberdrola I Award, the
Claimant availed itself of the recourse established in the ICSID Convention and
unsuccessfully applied for its annulment. Now it requests this Tribunal to make a finding
that is contrary to that of the Iherdrola I tribunal. Relying on RSM v. Grenada, the
Respondent submits that reopening the findings of an ICSID tribunal (as the Claimant
attempts to do in this arbitration) would breach Article 53 of the ICSID Convention, with
the result that the Tribunal would lack jurisdiction.!°°

. For the Respondent, the fact that this is an UNCITRAL arbitration is no excuse for the

Claimant to violate the ICSID Convention. The contrary solution would affect the
integrity of the investment dispute settlement system.!*!

6. Jurisdiction ratione materiae

The Respondent submits that, in the unlikely event that Iberdrola were allowed to
reformulate its claims, the latter are likewise outside of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction as they
relate exclusively to Guatemalan law.'” Even if the Tribunal were to disagree with this
characterization, the claims have in any event already been resolved by the Guatemalan
courts, and are thus not within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

a. The claims relate exclusively to questions of Guatemalan law

The Respondent argues that, under Article 11(1) of the Treaty, Guatemala’s consent is
limited to disputes concerning matters governed by the Treaty. Disputes about issues of
Guatemalan law are thus outside this Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

Jurisdiction must be proven applying the pro tem test articulated by Judge Higgins in the
Oil Platforms case. Specifically, so says Guatemala, “the Claimant must demonstrate that
the alleged facts, if established, may entail a violation of ‘matters governed’ by the
Treaty.”!°> This is not the case here, as the Claimant’s claims are grounded on domestic
law, particularly on “(i) the binding or nonbinding nature of the Expert Commission’s
statement, (ii) the authority of the [CNEE] to approve the independent study conducted
by Sigla, and (iii) the authority of the [CNEE] to adopt the tariffs based upon said
report.”!*4 Labelling the actions of the CNEE as violations of international law! is
insufficient to establish jurisdiction. If the Tribunal were to accept jurisdiction, “the
Parties would become mired in a purely regulatory debate revolving around the powers
of the regulatory entity and the distributor in the Tariff-Setting Process.”!°° For the
Respondent, the Claimant has provided no information to the contrary.!*”

b. The claims have already been resolved by Guatemalan courts

The Respondent further asserts that, even if the Tribunal were to hold that the claims
relate to “matters governed” by the Treaty, it could not review the decisions of the
Guatemalan Constitutional Court which resolved the dispute over the Tariff Setting

Process.!°8 Citing the Serbian Loan decision, the Respondent submits that “an
international tribunal cannot act as an appellate court on matters of domestic law.”!°°

In its Notice of Arbitration, the Claimant acknowledged that its claims were finally
resolved by the Constitutional Court of Guatemala on 18 November 2009 and 24
February 2010.” As the dispute has already been resolved by domestic courts, so argues
the Respondent, only a denial of justice claim could raise it to the international level.”°!
Yet, the /berdrola I tribunal dismissed the denial of justice claim on its merits. The
Claimant has accepted this and has expressly excluded its previous denial of justice claim
from this arbitration. As a result, nothing in the Claimant’s Notice of Arbitration allows
its exclusively national dispute to be raised to the international level.7

B. The Claimant’s position

The Claimant submits that this Tribunal has jurisdiction over its claims, all of which are
admissible, for the following reasons: (1) the claims are not barred by the principle of res
judicata; (2) the doctrine of concentration of arguments is inapplicable; (3) the Treaty
does not contain a fork-in-the-road clause, and even if it did, it has not been triggered, nor
are the proceedings precluded by Article 26 of the ICSID Convention; (4) there has been
no abuse of process; (5) the claims do not violate Article 53 of the ICSID Convention;
and (6) they are treaty claims not premised on national law, with the result that the
Tribunal has the required jurisdiction ratione materiae.

1. Res judicata

According to the Claimant, the Respondent has failed properly to establish the content of
the res judicata principle in international law. Properly defined, the res judicata principle
does not prevent the Tribunal’s rendering a decision on the international law claims in
this case. More specifically, the Claimant submits that (a) for res judicata to apply, it is
not sufficient for the triple identity test to be met; it is also necessary to determine what
has been “definitively settled”; (b) decisions on jurisdiction do not have preclusive effects
over merits issues; and (c) applying these principles, res judicata does not bar the present
claims. Finally, res judicata does not preclude jurisdiction, but goes to the admissibility
of the claims.

a. The content of the res judicata principle in international law

The Claimant accepts that res judicata is a principle of international law as well as a
general principle of law in the meaning of Article 38(1)(c) of the ICJ Statute. According
to this principle, “the issues that have been determined” are binding on the parties and
final.2°> The Claimant further accepts that “for the principle of res judicata to apply the
international proceedings in question must involve the same parties, the same object, and
the same legal ground, i.e. meet the triple identity test.””°* Yet while the triple identity
test is a necessary condition, it is also necessary to determine what issues have actually
been “definitively settled” by the previous decision.2°° The Claimant cites two recent
decisions of the ICJ on this matter:

It is not sufficient, for the application of res judicata, to identify the case at
issue, characterized by the same parties, object and legal ground; it is also
necessary to ascertain the content of the decision, the finality of which is to be
guaranteed. The Court cannot be satisfied merely by an identity between
requests successively submitted to it by the same Parties; it must determine
whether and to what extent the first claim has already been definitively
settled.”°

[Flor res judicata to apply in a given case, the Court ‘must determine whether
and to what extent the first claim has already been definitively settled’ [...]
for ‘[i]f a matter has not in fact been determined, expressly or by necessary
implication, then no force of res judicata attaches to it’.”°””

In this respect, the Claimant’s expert, Prof. Michael Reisman, opines that “[t]he
construction of res judicata in the field of public international law thus is confined to the
preclusion of claims that not only have been raised but have been decided with finality in
the earlier judgment”.”°* As a result, “the res judicata objection requires the tribunal to
review the prior award to determine whether or not what is now being claimed is what
was definitely decided by the prior tribunal.”

The Claimant further asserts in connection with ascertaining the scope of the res judicata
formed by a prior award or judgment that the ICJ held that, although the decision “is
contained in the operative clause of the judgment”, “it may be necessary to determine the
meaning of the operative clause by reference to the reasoning set out in the judgment in
question”.”'° This being so, the goal remains to identify what was decided and “the fact
that a point was argued by the Parties does not necessarily mean that it was definitively
decided by the Court.”?!!

. The Claimant opposes the Respondent’s suggestion that there is a contemporary trend in

international arbitration towards an autonomous and flexible approach to res judicata
which does not reflect current public international law.”!? According to the Claimant, the
Respondent’s position is flawed because it relies on national laws and disregards the
relevant rules of international law?! and it is an academic proposal or a consideration de
lege ferenda often discussed in the context of international commercial arbitration and
not of investment arbitration.”!* Further, the sources cited by the Respondent suggest that
claims brought before an international tribunal, and rejected at the jurisdictional stage do
not entail res judicata effects, whatever the submissions made before the tribunal
declining jurisdiction.?!5

This being so, “[a]s a party that is seeking to obtain a decision on the merits of its treaty
claims for the first time,”?!° the Claimant does not favor a formalistic approach to res
judicata, and agrees with the Respondent that “[iJnstead of rigid identity tests, an overall
assessment of the parties involved, the legal grounds invoked, the objects pursued and the
underlying facts will be necessary in order to avoid a multiplication of proceedings with
its inherent danger of conflicting outcomes.”?!” Hence, the Tribunal must apply the three
elements of the triple identity test, i.e. personae, petitum, and causa petendi. In other
words, res judicata is not only dependent on the parties and the facts, it is also limited by
the relief sought and the legal basis i.e., the causa petendi.”"® In addition, to apply the
triple identity test, the Tribunal must determine “what has been decided in the first
case.”2°

b. Decisions on jurisdiction have no preclusive effects over merits issues

The Claimant submits that “[w]hen declining jurisdiction an international tribunal
exercises its compétence de la compétence powers exclusively over the claims submitted
to it.”?”° The power to identify the nature of the dispute lies within such compétence de
la compétence.”” In characterizing the claims, the international tribunal will take into
account the position of both parties and pay particular attention to the formulation of the
dispute by the applicant.”” In the end, however, it is for the international tribunal itself
“to determine on an objective basis the subject matter of the dispute between the parties,
that is, to ‘isolate the real issue in the case and to identify the object of the claim.”?”3

Further, Iberdrola submits that decisions on jurisdiction have no preclusive effects over
merits issues, as the ICJ held in South West Africa:

The essential point is that a decision on a preliminary objection can never be
preclusive of a matter appertaining to the merits, whether or not it has in fact
been dealt with in connection with the preliminary objection [...] It may occur
that a judgment on a preliminary objection touches on a point of merits, but
this it can do only in a provisional way, to the extent necessary for deciding
the question raised by the preliminary objection. Any finding on the point of
merits therefore, ranks simply as part of the motivation of the decision on the
preliminary objection, and not as the object of that decision. It cannot rank as
a final decision on the point of merits involved.?**

That being said, the Claimant acknowledges that, in principle, a decision on jurisdiction
has res judicata effect as regards the matters that it definitively decides. However, relying
on Waste Management II, the Claimant submits that no res judicata bar applies when “the
jurisdictional barrier or flaw can be corrected.”?> The same rule applies to decisions on
admissibility .?”°

PCA Case No. 2017-41
Final Award
24 August 2020

According to the Claimant, the Respondent has failed to address the effects of decisions
declining jurisdiction and rather adopts a simplistic approach that relies on virtually no
sources of international law, or takes them out of context. In particular,?”” it has quoted
Bin Cheng out of context, when that author’s position is that no one should be proceeded
against twice for the same cause, and that the “negative effect of res judicata [...] only
attaches, however, to a final judgment of a competent tribunal. Where a tribunal has
merely declared itself to have no jurisdiction to entertain a suit, this does not prevent the
same issue from being presented before another tribunal which may be competent.”?28
Similarly, Guatemala quotes Hobér out of context. While Hobér does state that
“[jJurisdictional decisions based on curable procedural requirements do not constitute res
judicata” , he also writes that res judicata does not apply to awards by which an ICSID
tribunal decides that the dispute is not within its competence or the jurisdiction of ICSID.
Consequently, if an ICSID tribunal declines jurisdiction, a claimant may start proceedings
in another forum.””° Furthermore, the Respondent’s assertion that the ICJ decision on
Nicaragua v. Colombia II “should be awarded scant persuasive value” in light of the
distribution of votes and criticism from the dissenting judges ignores that this was not an
isolated decision. In addition, the admissibility issue was decided by 15 votes to 1.7°°

c. Properly defined, the res judicata principle does not prevent a decision on the
international law claims

Building on the elements set out in (a) and (b) above, the Claimant submits, essentially
for three reasons, that the principle of res judicata does not preclude it from having its
treaty claims decided.

First, Iberdrola’s treaty claims have not been decided and, therefore, cannot fall within
the scope of res judicata. Indeed, the [berdrola I tribunal “considered that the nature of
the claims submitted by Iberdrola I in that arbitration was one of Guatemalan national
law.”?5! This is also the manner in which the annulment committee understood it.”>?
Accordingly, “the tribunal in Jberdrola I could have never decided upon any treaty claim
whatsoever because, under its characterization, the claims before it were purely domestic

claims”?

In the Claimant’s submission, the Respondent’s argument that the Jberdrola I tribunal did
tule on Iberdrola’s international law claims because Iberdrola failed to establish that the
facts, as alleged, could amount to international law claims, is untenable.?* The Iberdrola
I tribunal accepted a jurisdictional defense and, hence, by definition, did not rule on the
merits. It actually underscored that it “did not even have competence to consider the
parties’ allegations about the regulatory or contractual nature of the dispute, because that
would be, above all, a matter relating to the merits of the dispute”.?*> In line with this
finding, it did not mention let alone assess a single piece of evidence.2*°

The Claimant makes the following comments on the Iberdrola I award:

i. The tribunal started by analyzing Article 11 of the BIT. It concluded that “the
consent of the Republic of Guatemala to submit disputes under the Treaty to
arbitration is clearly limited to those disputes concerning “matters regulated by’ the
Treaty itself.”*”

ii. The tribunal then addressed how “the way in which the Claimant raised its claims
regarding the standards of the Treaty that it considers have been violated by
Guatemala.” For the Claimant, this means that the tribunal was addressing how
Iberdrola’s claims had been formulated.”*

iii. When assessing each of the claims, the tribunal concluded that Iberdrola had only
presented local law claims.

iv. After this claim by claim analysis, the tribunal found that Iberdrola had only
submitted claims of Guatemalan law over which it had no jurisdiction, and that, as
formulated, Iberdrola’s claims required a prior decision from the tribunal on claims
of local law.”*? However, the tribunal determined that it was not its function to act
as an appellate body and review the findings of local courts.

According to the Claimant, the Jberdrola I tribunal “did not conclude that the factual
matrix at the origin of the dispute could not give rise to treaty claims, but that, as
formulated by Iberdrola, the claims in Jberdrola I were local law claims premised on the
violation of local law with respect to which the tribunal lacked jurisdiction to make a
ruling.”

The repeated references to the form in which the claimant had presented its claims were
meant to delineate the scope of its jurisdictional decision.”**! Pursuant to the rule against
ultra petita decisions, the [berdrola I tribunal could not dismiss claims that it regarded as
not having been submitted.” According to the Claimant, the tribunal did not say that the
facts of the case could not give rise to treaty breaches.?4*

Second, the Claimant contends that the triple identity test and in particular the
requirement of identical causa petendi, is not met, because the claims before this Tribunal
are treaty claims and thus have a different legal basis from the claims in Iberdrola I. In
support, it relies in particular on the International Law Association’s (“ILA”) Final Report
on Res judicata, which emphasizes that a claim brought in the second proceedings based.
on a different cause of action than the one raised in the first arbitration is not barred by
res judicata. This distinction was also noted for instance by the SGS v. Pakistan
tribunal, according to which “the same set of facts can give rise to different claims
grounded on differing legal orders: the municipal and the international legal orders.”**°
This distinction, which is “widely acknowledged as customary international law”, “is also
reflected in Article 3 of the Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally
Wrongful Acts.”247

Third, the tribunal in Iberdrola I refused to exercise jurisdiction due to the manner in
which the claims were presented. Relying on its expert, Prof. August Reinisch, the
Claimant submits that “by accepting a jurisdictional objection based on the national law
nature of the claims that had been formulated, the Jberdrola I Award does not prevent
Iberdrola from submitting its international law claims to a newly formed arbitral
tribunal.””“* While accepting the jurisdictional finding in respect of national law claims
that cannot be revisited,” the Claimant stresses that the jurisdictional flaw related to how
the claims were formulated, “may be corrected by bringing newly formulated claims
based on treaty breaches that are not premised on national law violations.”°° As stated in

Waste Management II, “if the jurisdictional flaw can be corrected, there is in principle no
9 251

objection to the claimant State recommencing its action”.
This being so, the Claimant concedes that there can be “jurisdictional barriers that cannot
be removed”, such as the lack of a protected investment on the critical date or a finding
that the claimant was not a protected investor, for instance because it lacked the required
nationality at the relevant time. However, the jurisdictional flaw found by the Jberdrola I
tribunal, relating to how the claimant formulated its claims, is a curable one.” The
Claimant invokes especially Hobér who explains as follows:

If an ICSID tribunal declines jurisdiction, a party may also commence
proceedings in another forum for a decision on the merits, provided of course
that the other forum has jurisdiction. Another situation where a decision on
jurisdiction does not have res judicata effect is when jurisdiction is declined
based on a so-called curable jurisdictional defect.”

According to the Claimant, the Jberdrola I tribunal concluded that “the substance of [the
disputed] issues and, above all, of the disputes that [Iberdrola] asks the Tribunal to rule
on, refer to Guatemalan law.”?** By contrast, the claims brought in this arbitration are
stand-alone international law claims. Iberdrola asks the Tribunal to assess the facts
exclusively in the light of international law, the fundamental basis of the claims being
“Guatemala’s obligations under Article 3 of the Treaty to grant fair and equitable
treatment to Claimant’s investments, to respect the minimum standard of treatment under
international law, and not to adopt arbitrary measures. No domestic law violations are
alleged in the present claims; only these facts and the treaty rules applicable to that set of
facts.”255

The Claimant admits that there is some overlap between the two cases given that they
share the same factual matrix. However, unlike the claim in Jberdrola I, the present case
“does not pass by or posit a [violation of Guatemalan law] as a fundamental element or

premise of its cause of action” .*°°

179. For these reasons, the Claimant concludes that res judicata is not dispositive of the

180.

Tribunal’s jurisdiction or of the admissibility of the claim. On the contrary, it maintains
that it is entitled under international law to a decision on the merits under the Treaty.”°”

d. Relevance and content of Swiss international arbitration law

(i) Should the Tribunal consider Swiss international arbitration law
on res judicata in addition to international law?

The Claimant’s short answer to the Tribunal’s first question is as follows:

The issue of the alleged res judicata should be decided solely on the basis of
international law. Swiss law is only applicable to the extent that annulment or
recognition and enforcement proceedings are initiated in Switzerland. Even in
that case, Swiss law would make a renvoi to the ICSID Convention and
international law.”**

More specifically, the Claimant submits that the Respondent’s res judicata objection,
including determining what the ICSID tribunal definitively decided and to what extent
that tribunal’s negative jurisdictional award has preclusive effects over the Claimant’s
treaty claims, must be determined in accordance with international law,” for the
following reasons:

i. The Tribunal is an international tribunal, whose constitution and jurisdiction are
based on the terms of a treaty;7

ii. The agreement to arbitrate (made up of the State’s offer to arbitrate contained in the
Treaty and the Claimant’s acceptance) is subject to international law;?°!

iii. Article 11(3) provides that the arbitration shall be governed by the Treaty’s
provisions, Guatemalan law and international law, and does not refer to the law of
the seat;? and

iv. The Respondent’s admissibility objection stems from an international law
instrument, namely an ICSID award, and thus is premised on alleged inadmissibility
grounds pertaining to the international legal order.?©

That being said, the Claimant acknowledges that, in principle, international law
recognizes that the seat of the arbitration (in the present case Geneva, Switzerland) has
jurisdiction to prescribe rules relating to the arbitration agreement, the arbitral procedure,
and the annulment/enforcement of the arbitral award, subject to any applicable
international law obligations. However, the Claimant emphasizes that “[nJone of these
legal rules alter the fact that this Tribunal must be regarded as a tribunal based on an
international agreement and not one based on Swiss law. Accordingly, the Claimant
submits that “the role of Swiss law is necessarily limited to any annulment or recognition
and enforcement proceedings that any of the parties may initiate in the competent Swiss
court against an award rendered by this Tribunal.” 7

. The Claimant further contends that, were the law of the seat to apply, as shown in its

response to Question 2, Swiss law would lead to the same conclusion as it makes a renvoi
to the applicable international treaty, ie. the ICSID Convention.?© In any event, “the
application of Swiss law could only result in limiting, but never in extending, the scope
of res judicata of the Iberdrola I award as determined by international law.” 7°

(ii) What is the content of Swiss international arbitration law about
res judicata of negative jurisdictional awards?

The Claimant’s short answer to Question 2 is the following:

The answer to question (1) is not affirmative but even were that to be the case,
the substantive result would not change as Swiss law contains a renvoi to
international law. In all events, the content of Swiss international arbitration
law as regards the res judicata effect of negative jurisdictional awards, set out
below, leads to the same outcome.””

The Claimant submits that, for the Swiss Federal Supreme Court (the “SFSC”), the
assessment of the res judicata effects of previous decisions “entails considering two
competing principles of Swiss public policy: the finality of decisions and access to

justice”.?°8 As such, while it must ensure the finality of decisions, the approach to res
judicata must also protect Iberdrola’s right to be heard.”

Hence, according to the Claimant, “Swiss law adopts a restrictive approach as opposed.
to broader common law principles of res judicata or a proposed transnational
approach”.?”° The Claimant also notes that, as there is no positive rule or law or case law
in Switzerland on the extent of the res judicata effect of an ICSID negative award on
jurisdiction, the principles developed in the case law of the SFSC when assessing the res
judicata effects of foreign awards in a non-treaty arbitration may be considered by
analogy.7”!

As to the content of Swiss international arbitration law on res judicata, the Claimant
makes six main points. The Claimant argues however that “Swiss law can only limit the
effect of res judicata of an ICSID award resulting from the ICSID Convention and
international law”, and as a result the extent of res judicata under Swiss law can only be
considered in this context.?”

First, the Claimant submits that, “[u]nder Swiss law, a foreign decision can only have res
judicata effects if it is capable of recognition in Switzerland.”?”? According to the
Claimant, “[uJnless an international treaty provides otherwise”, for a foreign decision to
be capable of recognition, a Swiss court or arbitral tribunal must review the jurisdiction
of the foreign court or arbitral tribunal that adopted the foreign decision in question.”
As aresult, “a foreign decision on jurisdiction cannot have res judicata effect on the Swiss
seated court or arbitral tribunal that will undertake this review.”2”> However, the Claimant
points out that, “[f]or ICSID awards, this question must be assessed considering Art. 54(1)
of the ICSID Convention which provides that “‘[e]ach Contracting State shall recognize

an award rendered pursuant to this Convention as binding’ without subjecting this
recognition to any condition.”?”° This includes decisions by arbitral tribunals declining
jurisdiction, as such decisions constitute an “award” within the meaning of referred to
Art. 54(1). The Claimant thus appears to be acknowledging that, given the terms of the
ICSID Convention, a negative decision on jurisdiction by an ICSID tribunal is capable of
recognition in Switzerland without the Swiss court or arbitral tribunal needing to confirm
the jurisdiction of the foreign court or arbitral tribunal that issued the decision.

Second, the Claimant submits that a foreign decision cannot have greater res judicata
effects in Switzerland than it would have under the /ex fori, nor greater effects than a
domestic award or judgment would have in Switzerland. Unless an international
agreement provides otherwise, the res judicata effect of a foreign decision is “the lowest
common denominator of: (i) [t]he extent of the res judicata effect under the law of the
court or tribunal that rendered the first decision, which is analysed first; and (ii) [t]he
extent of the res judicata effect that Swiss law accords to domestic decisions.””””
However, the Claimant contends that “the ICSID Convention must be considered an
international agreement whose terms provide ‘otherwise’, thereby creating an exception
to the general rules on res judicata under Swiss Law.”?”8 This is because the binding
effect of an ICSID award is not governed by municipal law, but by Article 53(1) of the
ICSID Convention. Accordingly, “when analyzing the res judicata effect of an award
rendered under the ICSID Convention the question falls to be analyzed solely under this
Convention and intemational law”.7”

As discussed elsewhere in this Award, the Claimant contends that, pursuant to
international law principles, “the Jberdrola I award does not have preclusive effects such
as to prevent this Tribunal from hearing the present case”.”*°

Third, the Claimant submits that, “[u]nder Swiss law, res judicata attaches to a decision
that finally determines a legal dispute”, and thus in principle “only a judgment on the
merits generates res judicata effects.”"*! However, the SFSC has allowed for a potential
exception for decisions on the procedural admissibility of a claim, stating that they can

have substantive res judicata effect “at most” with regard to the specific ground of
admissibility the court decided upon.””*? Despite asserting this, the Claimant notes that,
according to certain commentators, the res judicata effects of “a negative jurisdictional
decision rendered by a Swiss seated Tribunal may depend on the grounds on which an
arbitral tribunal found it lacked jurisdiction”. Even if this were the case, the Claimant
contends that it is irrelevant here: the Jberdrola I Award determined that Iberdrola’s
claims required a decision on national issues law and were thus not treaty claims;
consequently, “no aspect of res judicata under Swiss law prevents Iberdrola from
presenting a different claim not requiring a decision on such national law issues, even if
based on the same facts, if that claim gives rise to a treaty claim.” In any event, the
Claimant contends that Swiss law accepts that “a case dismissed under jurisdictional
grounds in one forum may subsequently be brought in another forum.”?8°

Fourth, the Claimant submits that, “under Swiss law, res judicata only applies if there are
identical claims (subject-matter scope) between identical parties (personal scope)”.”°
Relying on case law of the SFSC, the Claimant submits that the legal basis of the claims
is necessarily a “fundamental and meaningful element” to determine whether there is
identity of subject-matter scope.”*’ As the present claims are treaty claims, the legal basis
of the claims is different and the claims are not identical.?**

. Fifth, the Claimant notes that, under Swiss law, “only the dispositive part of a decision

can ever have res judicata effects (i.e., not the reasoning).”*8° However, while not
binding, “the reasoning underlying a decision is relevant to determining the scope of res
judicata”? According to the Claimant, “[t]he dispositive part of the Iberdrola I award
does not contain anything that could create a res judicata effect barring this Tribunal from
hearing the present case.””°! This Tribunal can only consider the reasoning of the
Iberdrola I award when determining which claims the Jberdrola I tribunal declined
jurisdiction over, and whether they are identical to the claims submitted here.”

Sixth, the Claimant contends that there is no rule under Swiss law of claim preclusion or
concentration of claims that would prevent the present claims being determined, and that
Swiss law “accepts that a case dismissed under jurisdictional grounds in one forum may
subsequently be brought in another forum.”

On this basis, the Claimant concludes that even if Swiss law were to apply to this case,
this would not prevent this Tribunal from hearing Iberdrola’s claims on the merits.
Because the Jberdrola I tribunal did not decide that the factual matrix of that case could
never give rise to a claim under the BIT, and because the claims in Jberdrola I and the
present case are not identical, “the required Swiss law conditions for an application of res
judicata do not exist’.?** Considering the competing principles of finality of decisions
and right to be heard, the Claimant argues that “the delicate balance of justice must be
struck by not granting unfounded res judicata effects to a negative decision on
jurisdiction that if so granted would result in denying Iberdrola from ever having a
decision on the merits of its legitimate treaty claims.”?°°

2. Concentration of claims

For the Claimant, there is no rule of international law establishing the so-called “principle
of concentration of claims”. Despite the Respondent’s inaccurate references, international
arbitral tribunals have not acknowledged the existence of such a principle. On the
contrary, recent decisions confirm that no such principle exists.?°° The Claimant cites in
particular Asylum and Haya de la Torre;?" Caratube II;?°* and Mobil v. Canada II”

The Claimant further argues that the legal authorities relied upon by the Respondent are
inapposite or taken out of context. Indeed, the references to “claim-splitting” are
inapposite; the ICJ has never acknowledged the principle of concentration of arguments
as an international law rule. The fact that it did not apply it in the Nicaragua v. Colombia
case and in the Costa Rica v. Nicaragua/Nicaragua v. Costa Rica case proves that this
rule does not exist.°°°

Further, the domestic laws referred to by the Respondent to try to establish the
concentration of claims principle do not apply to this dispute.*°! In any event, domestic
laws do not show that such principle is a general principle of law. It does not apply as
pleaded in three major jurisdictions: in France, where it is inappropriate in international
proceedings; in the United Kingdom, where it is limited to cases of abuse of process, and
in Germany, where it simply does not exist.°°

As a result, this ground does not bar Iberdrola from submitting its claims.
3. Fork in the road

As a preliminary matter, the Claimant notes that, because the Respondent has formulated
this objection in the alternative to its res judicata objection, the fork-in-the-road objection
is premised on the fact that Iberdrola presents a different claim in this case than in prior
cases. This disposes of the fork-in-the-road argument. Indeed, “if the claims in this
arbitration are different from the ones submitted in the prior cases, Iberdrola cannot have
exercised a via electa in relation to this dispute and claims.”°>

As to the substance of the objection, the Claimant’s position is essentially that (a) Article
11(2) is not a fork-in-the-road clause; (b) even if it was, that clause was not triggered, and
(c) Article 26 of the ICSID Convention has no application here.

a. Article 11(2) is not a fork-in-the-road clause

The Claimant submits that Article 11 “does not establish that the choice of one or the
other of the mechanisms by the investor shall be final” and thus “does not prevent an
investor that had recourse to an infructuous via to go to a second forum to have its claims
decided.”° Investment treaties resort to techniques limiting access to international
arbitration, but these do not originate from a general principle of international law. Hence,
for the investor’s choice to be irrevocable, an express rule is needed. Article 11 contains
no such express rule. Citing several investment treaty awards, Iberdrola observes that the
clause does not state that the investor’s choice will exclude any other option or be
irrevocable or definitive, or include other similar wording.*°> By contrast, other BITs

concluded by Spain do provide that the choice of a particular forum is final.5°° Similarly,
Guatemala’s treaty practice shows an awareness of the variety of wordings and, as a
result, of their different implications.”

The Claimant concludes that had the Contracting Parties “wished to include a fork-in-the-
road, they would have clearly expressed such intent”,*°* which they did not do.

b. _Evenif Article 11(2) was a fork-in-the-road clause, it has not been
triggered

Assuming that Article 11(2) was a fork-in-the-road clause, it would only apply to treaty-
based claims, as Article 11 only governs jurisdiction “regarding matters regulated by this
Agreement”.*°? Consequently, the fork-in-the-road clause was not triggered by the
amparo proceedings brought by EEGSA."!° It was not triggered either by the ICSID
proceedings, because the Iberdrola I tribunal found that the Claimant brought domestic
law claims rather than treaty claims. Hence, the claims in the two arbitrations are not the
same and “[e]ven though in 2008 Iberdrola presented its claims in good faith as treaty
claims, the tribunal in Iberdrola I ultimately considered they were not.”*!! The
Respondent’s position is contradictory: on one hand, it argues that the Claimant is
bringing exclusively domestic law claims, while at the same time contending that they
are treaty claims that trigger the fork-in-the-road clause.*!2

Further, the Claimant contends that the fork-in-the-road clause can only be triggered
where there is identity of parties, object and cause of action.*'> Contrary to the
Respondent’s contention, the Tribunal should not focus on the “fundamental basis of the
dispute” test articulated in Pantechniki'* The Claimant appears to agree with the
Respondent that the purpose of Article 11 is “avoiding the duplication of proceedings and
the risk of conflicting decisions.”*!> However, it is of the view that the broad
interpretation of Pantechniki does not preserve this purpose better than a clear-cut criteria,
and in addition it creates uncertainty, forcing the investor to resort to arbitration instead
of seeking to resolve its disputes in the local courts.>'

As a result, “the operation of any fork-in-the-road clause must be analysed dispute by
dispute,” and “only the resubmission of the very same dispute will trigger its
application.”*!” Moreover, the investor’s choice operates only with respect to the actual
investment dispute, not with respect to future disputes. As a result, the investor may
choose different dispute mechanisms for different disputes.*!*

The Claimant further submits that the purpose of Article 11 is to attract investors through
effective protection. With this goal in mind, the “prior choice of a ‘dead-end’ road” cannot
rule out other forum options for disputes not affected by res judicata.>!?

Finally, the Claimant alleges that previous acts by the Respondent contradict its present
position. In particular, Guatemala requested the Claimant to exhaust local remedies under
Article 26 of the ICSID Convention. This would make no sense if the fork-in-the-road
clause operated as the Respondent now alleges.°”°

ce. Article 26 of the ICSID Convention does not bar the present
proceedings

. The Claimant denies that Article 26 of the ICSID Convention prevents the Tribunal from

finding that it has jurisdiction over its claims.

According to the Claimant, the Respondent misinterprets Article 26 of the ICSID
Convention, whether standing alone or in combination with Article 11 of the Treaty.

to such arbitration has been given and continues to exist.”>! Here there is no consent to
ICSID arbitration. Indeed, the Claimant’s consent to arbitration proved ineffective, since
it did not match the Respondent’s offer, leading the Iberdrola I tribunal to deny
jurisdiction. Furthermore, when the investor has consented through the institution of
ICSID proceedings, it cannot be subject ad infinitum to the jurisdiction of a forum which
has expressly refused to exercise that jurisdiction.*”

. For the Claimant, the text of Article 26 establishes a presumption of exclusivity in favor

of ICSID, which “operates to prevent parties from initiating other proceedings in
domestic courts and/or other arbitral fora, while consent to ICSID jurisdiction is in
place.” * This rule presupposes a valid and standing consent to ICSID arbitration.*** As
explained by Prof. Schreuer, “if the tribunal has determined that the Centre does not have
jurisdiction because there is no valid consent, Art. 26 does not apply and other remedies
may be pursued.”>> This interpretation is confirmed by the travaux préparatoires of
Article 26. The travaux show that “[t]he drafters of the ICSID Convention intended
Article 26 to be an interpretative aid in case of doubt as to whether, once consent to ICSID
jurisdiction has been validly given and it is still in place, parallel domestic or international
proceedings were permissible.” >”° Citing Delaume, Alghanim and Perenco, the Claimant
stresses that both doctrine and arbitral practice corroborate that Article 26 is only relevant
while ICSID jurisdiction exists. Accordingly, while Article 26 prevents parallel
proceedings that cover the same dispute, consent to ICSID arbitration is not “fixed in
stone forever more”, and “[t]he stay in favour of ICSID’s exclusive jurisdiction [...]
operates only for as long as that such jurisdiction is in being and will not operate in case
of a negative finding on jurisdiction.”*””

. The Claimant argues that in [berdrola I the tribunal determined that, as presented, the

claims did not fall within Guatemala’s offer to arbitrate.>?8 As the Claimant’s consent was
not effective, there is no exclusivity of ICSID arbitration, and the Claimant is not
prevented from bringing this UNCITRAL arbitration.

The Claimant further contends that the way in which the Respondent purports to use
Article 26 would “at best prevent Iberdrola from obtaining an effective legal remedy for
its still undetermined Treaty claims and at worst, lead to a denial of justice to
Iberdrola.”>2° Relying on Casinos Austria, the Claimant argues that an expansive
interpretation of Article 26 “would have the effect of denying a claimant the choice of
forum set out in the BIT by requiring Iberdrola to submit its Treaty claims to ICSID or to
potentially leave the Claimant with no forum to hear these claims [...] leaving Iberdrola
without any effective legal remedy for its undecided treaty claims.”>*?

Finally, the Claimant submits that “Article 11(2) of the BIT does not affect or alter the
correct interpretation to be given to Article 26.”**! Concretely, Article 11(2) has two
effects vis-a-vis Article 26. First, once the investor chooses ICSID as a forum and initiates
ICSID proceedings, Article 26 is activated and the ICSID remedy is exclusive.**? Second,
if ICSID determines that it has no jurisdiction (leaving aside the question of res judicata),
then the investor may choose again between the available forums for the determination
of its claim. This is what has happened here. °°

4. Abuse of process

The Claimant argues that it is “simply and transparently trying to have its claims heard
and decided on the merits”, and that “[nJo abuse can be found in such legitimate
interest.”>** It also contends that the Respondent presents a distorted notion of the abuse
of process doctrine under international law.**> In particular, the Respondent has distorted
the meaning of the Orascom decision, where the situation was clearly different: involving
“multiple proceedings [...] initiated in parallel for a purely strategic reason by different
entities of the same group of companies under different investment treaties”. Here, by
contrast, the Claimant started a first arbitration over which jurisdiction was denied and
only thereafter did it bring a second arbitration under the same treaty “so that its treaty
claims could be finally decided for the first time.”?°° If anything, Orascom shows that
“the standard of abuse of process is quite high and should not be taken lightly.”3°7

Moreover, the Claimant underlines that the application of the doctrine of abuse of process
to international arbitration is not firmly established.*** However, assuming that it applies
at all in this context, Iberdrola notes that it refers to the abusive exercise of a legally
recognized right or, in the words of Prof. Reisman, “the use of a legal process for an
unlawful purpose”;**’ the burden of proof lies on the party alleging abuse;*° and the
threshold to show an abuse of process is a high one, as was confirmed by several
investment tribunals (see, e.g., Chevron, Caratube II, Waste Management II, SPP, Renée
Rose Levy, Phoenix Action, Churchill Mining, Philip Morris v. Australia, Orascom,
among others).*“!

Lastly, the Claimant observes that as found by investment tribunals, in principle the
existence of multiple proceedings in and of itself does not constitute an abuse of process,
which implies that a party breaches the principle of good faith.**

Understood in this light, the Claimant contends that the prohibition of abuse of process
does not bar its claims. To the extent that it is not pursuing concurrent claims but only
this arbitration, and has yet to obtain a single decision on the merits of its treaty claims,
the submission of claim that has not yet been resolved cannot qualify as an abuse.**
Rather, it is the pursuit of a legitimate interest.*+

5. Article 53 of the ICSID Convention

The Claimant denies that its claims violate Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention. Article
53(1) aims at protecting the finality of awards rendered under the auspices of the ICSID
Convention. Citing Pey Casado I, it submits that “Article 53 of the Convention provides
that the award is not subject to an appeal procedure by a superior adjudication body with
the powers to scrutinize the merits of the award, suspend its binding effect during the
appeal phase or issue a new decision that replaces the original award.”**>

The Claimant acknowledges that “the award rendered in Jberdrola I is res judicata on
what it decided (that it did not have jurisdiction to entertain what it characterised as local
law claims) and cannot be reviewed, as mandated by Article 53 of the ICSID
Convention.” *“° However, it argues that “Iberdrola does not seek a review of the content

of the Iberdrola I Award or the subsequent annulment decision.”*“” For the Claimant, any
dispute or issue not decided in the award is not affected by Article 53.>**

. Citing Schreuer’s commentary to Article 53 of the ICSID Convention,*”? the Claimant

further submits that “[iJn the absence of a decision on the merits from the Iberdrola I
tribunal, Article 53 cannot be used by Guatemala to prevent Iberdrola’s treaty claims
being heard by this tribunal”.*° The Claimant stresses that “the causa petendi in the
current case is different to that decided in Jberdrola I and the res judicata rule is not
applicable”.*>! The Claimant thus concludes that Article 53 does not prevent the Tribunal
from hearing its treaty claims.**

6. Jurisdiction ratione materiae

The Claimant insists that the Tribunal has jurisdiction ratione materiae, “because [...]
this arbitration exclusively involves treaty claims.” It also argues that the Respondent
has failed to disprove that Iberdrola’s claims are based on the BIT;*™ the policy
considerations advanced by Guatemala are incomplete, biased, and irrelevant to the
present dispute;*°> and Guatemala’s “curing defects” reasoning lacks any merit and must
be dismissed.>*°

In accordance with paragraph 2.1 of Procedural Order No. 1, the languages of this
arbitration are Spanish and English. However, in accordance with paragraph 2.4 of that
same Order, this Award has been made in English and is accompanied by a separate
Spanish translation. In case of differences between the English and Spanish versions, the
English version shall prevail.

b. Applicable procedural law

As noted in Section 8.1 of the Terms of Appointment, this arbitration is governed by (in
the following order of precedence):

i. The mandatory rules of the law of international arbitration applicable at the seat of
the arbitration;

ii. The 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, save where modified by these Terms of
Appointment;

iii. The Terms of Appointment and the procedural rules issued by the Tribunal, as
reflected in Procedural Order No. 1 and any amendments thereof.

This arbitration is seated in Geneva and as such is subject to the mandatory rules of Swiss
international arbitration law enshrined in Chapter 12 of the PILA.

c. Tura novit curia

When applying the governing law, be it international or national, the Tribunal is not
bound by the arguments and sources invoked by the Parties. Under the maxim iura novit
curia — or, more precisely, iura novit arbiter — the Tribunal may apply the law of its own
motion, provided it seeks the Parties’ views if it intends to base its decision on a legal
theory that was not addressed and that the Parties could not reasonably anticipate.>**

d. Relevance of prior decisions

Both Parties have relied on previous decisions or awards in support of their positions,
either to conclude that the same solution should be adopted in the present case, or in an
effort to explain why this Tribunal should depart from that solution.

The Tribunal considers that it is not bound by previous decisions. At the same time, in its
judgement it must pay due consideration to earlier decisions of international tribunals.
Specifically, it believes that, subject to compelling contrary grounds, it has a duty to adopt
principles established in a series of consistent cases. It further believes that, subject
always to the specific text of the BIT, and with due regard to the circumstances of each
particular case, it has a duty to contribute to the harmonious development of international

States and investors towards the certainty of the rule of law.
2. Jurisdiction and admissibility

a. Legal framework

The analysis will first set out the legal framework for the review of jurisdiction and
admissibility (a below), assess ex officio the requirements for jurisdiction over which
there is no objection (b below), before addressing the res judicata (c) and fork-in-the-
toad objections (d).

. The Parties rely on Article 11(3) of the BIT to argue that jurisdiction and admissibility,

in particular res judicata, are governed by international law and first and foremost the
BIT, which is the instrument of the Parties’ consent. Article 11(3) of the BIT reads as
follows:

Articulo 11. Controversias entre una Parte Contratante e inversores de la
otra parte contratante.

LJ

3. El arbitraje se basaré en las disposiciones del presente Acuerdo, el
derecho nacional de la Parte Contratante en cuyo territorio se ha realizado
la inversién, incluidas la reglas relativas a los conflictos de Ley, asi como

también en las _reglas y los principios de derecho internacional que pudieran
ser aplicables. (Emphasis added).

English translation:

Article 11. Disputes between a Contracting Party and investors of the
other [C]ontracting [P]arty.

Le]

3. The arbitration shall be governed by the provisions of this Agreement,
the national law of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was
made, including the rules on conflicts of laws, as well as the rules and
principles of international law that may be applicable. (Emphasis added).

While this clause elects the law to govern “the arbitration”, which could point to a choice
made for the arbitration proceedings, the bodies of law chosen rather suggest that this is
a choice of the substantive law applicable to the merits of the dispute, akin to Article
42(1) of the ICSID Convention. Be this as it may, it is common ground that the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction is governed by international law and especially by the BIT, be it because the
latter is the instrument of the parties’ consent or by virtue of Article 11(3) of the BIT.

It is also undisputed that the interpretation of the BIT is governed by the customary
international law principles on treaty interpretation as codified in the VCLT.

The law applicable to the admissibility of the claims before this Tribunal, including the
admissibility defense of res judicata, deserves further elaboration. Subject to the role
of Swiss law to which the Tribunal will revert below, the Parties agree that res judicata
is governed by international law. The Claimant submits that “[the] Respondent’s res
judicata objection, including determining what the ICSID tribunal decided” and “to what
extent that tribunal’s negative jurisdictional award has preclusive effects over Claimant’s
treaty claims, must be determined on the basis of international law”.*° In the same vein
albeit based on different reasoning, the Respondent asserts that “Article 11.3 of the Treaty
defines the law applicable to the present arbitration proceedings, including to the issue of
res judicata. [...] [TJhe principle of res judicata under international law bars Claimant[]

from resubmitting its claims”.*°!

 

. In the Tribunal’s opinion, this view is consistent with the nature of admissibility, which

“concern[s] the existence, scope and exercise of adjudicative power by the arbitral
tribunal”.>° Hence, it is logical that it be governed by the instrument that creates its
adjudicative power, ie., the BIT.“ The application of international law is also in
conformity with the characteristics of the dispute and the source of the Tribunal’s
adjudicatory power: (i) the Tribunal is a body established under an international
instrument (the Treaty); (ii) the dispute involves the international responsibility of a State
under a treaty; and (iii) the res judicata objection aims at preventing the issuance of two
international awards on the same issue within the international legal order.

At the same time, this arbitration is seated in Geneva and as such is subject to the
mandatory rules of Swiss international arbitration law enshrined in Chapter 12 of the
PILA. In this respect, the Tribunal notes that the arbitration agreement, composed of the
State’s offer contained in the BIT and the investor’s acceptance contained in the Notice

It is noted that the res judicata principle is deemed to pertain to admissibility under international law (see
Delimitation of the Continental Shelf (Nicaragua v. Colombia), Judgment on Preliminary Objections,
ICJ Reports 2016, § 48 (17 March) (Exhs. CLA-007; RLA-022) and Swiss law (SFSC decision

of Arbitration, meets the form requirement of Article 178(1) PILA,°** and that the
application of the BIT to jurisdiction is in line with Article 178(2) PILA2®

In answer to questions of the Tribunal, the Parties have commented on the relevance of
Swiss law in matters of res judicata. For the Respondent, “the law of the seat should be
taken into consideration to determine whether or not a future award could be set aside in
the jurisdiction serving as the seat of the arbitration proceedings as part of the tribunal’s
duty to make every effort to render an award enforceable at law”.>® The Claimant for its
part argues that questions of res judicata should be decided solely on the basis of
international law, Swiss law being limited to subsequent annulment or enforcement
proceedings relating to the Award.**” In any event, it submits that Swiss law contains a
“renvoi” to international law with regard to res judicata issues of a foreign award.°® The
Claimant relies on a decision of the SFSC pursuant to which “[uJnless an international
treaty states otherwise, the lex fori determines whether the claim raised before a foreign
state court and the claim submitted to a Swiss court are identical”.*® For the Claimant,
the binding effects of an ICSID award are governed exclusively by Article 53(1) of the
ICSID Convention,*” “which must be considered an international agreement whose
terms provide ‘otherwise’, thereby creating an exception to the general rules on res
judicata under Swiss Law” >”!

In essence, the seat of the arbitration being in Switzerland, the forthcoming award may
be challenged under Article 190(2) PILA. Swiss case law holds that an award that
breaches the principle of res judicata is contrary to public policy and may thus be set
aside on the basis of Article 190(2)(e), which provides for the annulment of awards that
are irreconcilable with public policy.>”

When assessing an alleged breach of the principle of res judicata in application of Article
190(2)(e), the SFSC determines the existence and scope of the res judicata of the prior
foreign judgment or award under that decision’s own law. In the present case, as was

Article 178(1) PILA provides: “[A]n arbitration agreement is valid if made in writing, by telegram, telex,
telecopier or any other means of communication which permits it to be evidenced by a text” (Tribunal’s
translation).

Article 178(2) PILA provides: “[A]n arbitration agreement is valid if it conforms either to the law chosen
by the parties, or to the law governing the subject-matter of the dispute, in particular the main contract, or
to Swiss law” (Tribunal’s translation).

established above, that law would be international law. The SFSC then ascertains that the
foreign decision is not given wider res judicata effects than those it would enjoy under
Swiss law. Or in the words of the SFSC:

Res judicata depends on the law of the state of origin, so it behooves this law
to specify the conditions and limits of its effect [...] Therefore, the subjective,
objective, and temporal scope of res judicata may vary from one legal order
to the other. Harmonization in this field must be sought to the extent possible.
however, and it is achieved as follows: in Switzerland, a recognized foreign
judgment has only the authority it would have if issued by a Swiss court. Thus,
a declaratory foreign judgment which could be opposed to third parties
according to the law of a state of origin will only enjoy such authority in
Switzerland with regard to the parties to the proceedings [...]. Similarly, the
res judicata effect of a foreign judgment, which could extend to its reasons
according to the law of the state of origin, will be admitted in Switzerland only
as to the operative part of the judgment [...]. Conversely, a foreign judgment
may not produce more effects in Switzerland than it has pursuant to the legal
order from which it originates [...]. (Emphasis added).*”*

 

240. It arises from the decision just quoted and from other authorities?” that this test only

241.

applies if the foreign judgment or award can be recognized in Switzerland. The Iberdrola
I Award is an ICSID Award and Switzerland is an ICSID Contracting State. As such,
Switzerland is bound to recognize an ICSID award under Article 54(1) of the ICSID
Convention “as if it were a final judgment of a court in that State”. This requirement is
thus met.

The Claimant agrees that Swiss law will apply in the event of annulment proceedings, but
only if no treaty provides otherwise and it considers that the ICSID Convention, and in
particular Article 53(1) constitutes such a treaty. Article 53(1) stipulates that “[t]he award
shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other
remedy except those provided for in the Convention”. It is the source of the binding force
of ICSID awards. On the basis of this provision, a dispute resolved by an ICSID award is
ares judicata, a matter adjudged. It is thus relevant to the first prong of the test developed
by Swiss case law, which was just referred to, i.e. to the determination of the existence of
res judicata. Beyond that, Article 53(1) does not say whether and to what extent a second
tribunal seised with a potentially identical claim may or may not entertain that claim.

242. In summary, the Tribunal understands that, if called upon, the SFSC would ensure that
the Tribunal has not given the Jberdrola I Award more res judicata effects than it would
have under Swiss law. Because it has a duty to seek to render an award that is valid under
the law of the seat, the Tribunal must thus verify when assessing res judicata under
international law that it does not reach results that would conflict with Swiss law. As will
be seen below, this verification will be unproblematic as the regime of res judicata under
international and Swiss law reveals no outcome-determinative differences.

243. The jurisdiction of this Tribunal is alleged to be based on Article 11 of the BIT, which
reads as follows:

1. Any dispute relating to investments arising between one of the
Contracting Parties and an investor of the other Contracting Party,
concerning matters governed by this Agreement shall be notified in
writing, including detailed information, by the investor to the Contracting
Party receiving the investment. As far as possible, the disputing parties
shall endeavour to settle these differences by amicable agreement.

2. If the dispute cannot be settled in this manner within six months from the
date of written notice referred to in paragraph 1, the dispute may be
submitted, at the choice of the investor:

a. to the competent courts of the Contracting Party in whose territory
the investment was made; or

b. to an ad hoc arbitration tribunal established under the Arbitration
Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade
Law; or

c. to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes
(ICSID) created by the “Convention on the Settlement of Investment
Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States”, opened for
signature in Washington on 18 March 1965, when each State party
to this Agreement has acceded to it. Should one of the Contracting
Parties not be a Contracting State to said Convention, the dispute
may be resolved pursuant to the Additional Facility for the
Administration of Conciliation, Arbitration and Fact-Finding
Procedures by the ICSID Secretariat.

3. The arbitration shall be governed by the provisions of this Agreement,
the national law of the Contracting Party in whose territory the
investment was made, including the rules on conflicts of laws, as well as
the rules and the principles of international law that may be applicable.

4. The Contracting Party that is a party to the dispute shall not invoke in its
defence the fact that the investor, by virtue of an insurance contract or
guarantee, received or will receive a compensation for the total or part of
the losses suffered.

5.  Arbitral decisions shall be final and binding for the disputing parties.

Each Contracting Party undertakes to enforce such decisions in
accordance with its national legislation.

PCA Case No. 2017-41
Final Award
24 August 2020

It is common ground that this Tribunal is the judge of its own jurisdiction. As the ICJ
explained in the Nottebohm case, the Kompetenz-Kompetenz principle is a “rule
consistently accepted by general international law in the matter of international
arbitration”, according to which “in the absence of any agreement to the contrary, an
international tribunal has the right to decide as to its own jurisdiction and has the power
to interpret for this purpose the instruments which govern that jurisdiction.”*”> This
principle is also expressed in Article 186(1) PILA which provides that “[t]he arbitral
tribunal shall rule on its own jurisdiction.”>” It is further enshrined in Article 21(1) of the
UNCITRAL Rules 1976.37”

It is less clear whether, faced with a res judicata defense, a tribunal should start with the
review of such defense or rather discuss its jurisdiction first and only then address res
judicata. This is because, as set out in the Decision on Bifurcation>”* and accepted by the
Claimant,>” the res judicata defense is an objection to the admissibility of the claims. As
the ICJ has held, it “consists in the contention that there exists a legal reason, even when
there is jurisdiction, why the Court should decline to hear the case, or more usually, a
specific claim therein.”**° In theory at least, applying the principle of Kompetenz-
Kompetenz, the Tribunal should first address whether it has the competence to act, and,
if it does, it should then determine whether the claims are admissible, i.e., whether, despite
the Tribunal’s having the competence to resolve a claim, there are other legal reasons
why that claim cannot be heard.>*!

In the Tribunal’s opinion, here this may well be a distinction without a difference. Indeed,
while only a tribunal with jurisdiction can review the admissibility of the claims before
it, here the admissibility defense refers to issues pertaining to jurisdiction. In reality, it is
difficult to keep the two aspects entirely separate when the res judicata, that is the matter
allegedly finally decided, is precisely the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, or more precisely, its
lack of jurisdiction, over the dispute at hand. In a decision to which both Parties refer, the

PCA Case No. 2017-41
Final Award
24 August 2020

SFSC made the same observation after having stressed the “kinship that exists between
99382 5

the issue of jurisdiction and that of res judicata”**’ in the following terms:

Thus, the arbitral tribunal, which entertains a claim that has already been the
subject matter of a judgment vested with res judicata and which issues an
award on such claim, even if it does so on the basis of an arbitration agreement
and hence cannot be deemed to lack jurisdiction and cannot be sanctioned on
the basis of the provision just mentioned [i.e., Article 190(2)(b) which
provides that lack of jurisdiction is a ground for annulment], nevertheless
ultimately arrogates to itself ratione materiae jurisdiction which it lacks.°*°

Before proceeding further, the Tribunal must deal with the Claimant’s argument that
Guatemala has accepted jurisdiction by filing a counterclaim. In fact, the Respondent has
stated that it “is not objecting to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to decide claims under the
Treaty”; its “objection is that these claims have already been decided”.*** At the same
time, however, Guatemala has raised a jurisdictional defense linked to the fork in the road
allegedly contained in Article 11(2) of the BIT. Hence, the Tribunal understands that the
Respondent does not challenge jurisdiction, except in relation to the fork in the road, and
objects on the ground of res judicata. In any event, the Tribunal cannot accept that the
Respondent has voluntarily submitted to its jurisdiction by conduct through the mere act
of raising a counterclaim. Indeed, the counterclaim seeks redress for bringing claims
under the Treaty over which the Tribunal is said not to have jurisdiction. Hence, lack of
jurisdiction is the very basis for the counterclaim. In the circumstances, one cannot
discern how the act of bringing the counterclaim could be deemed a waiver of the
jurisdictional objection.

Finally, the Tribunal notes that, being seized on the basis of a treaty, it must assess its
jurisdiction ex officio, which it will proceed to do now.

b. Ex officio assessment of jurisdictional requirements

Subject to res judicata and fork in the road, the Respondent does not challenge the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction, and rightly so. The BIT requirements are in effect met. One could
of course argue that all the requirements provided in the BIT have been dealt with in
Iberdrola I and therefore must be deemed outside the reach of this Tribunal as a matter
of res judicata. The Respondent has not advanced this argument and has limited its
objection to the nature of the claims at hand. Be this as it may, it would make no difference
as there is no conflict among the Parties about the fulfillment of these requirements, the
Tribunal shares the Parties’ views, and [berdrola I did not decide to the contrary.

Indeed, the dispute is between the Republic of Guatemala, one of the Contracting Parties
to the BIT, and the Claimant, a corporation incorporated in the Kingdom of Spain, the
other Contracting Party to the BIT.**° The Tribunal thus has ratione personae jurisdiction
(Article 11(1)).

Likewise, the dispute concerns an investment made by the Claimant in the territory of the
Respondent, in accordance with Guatemalan law (Articles 11(1) and 12). The Respondent
does not dispute the existence of that investment, nor has it argued that the investment
was not made in accordance with Guatemalan law.

It is similarly undisputed that the dispute between the Parties arose after the BIT’s entry
into force (Article 12). The Tribunal thus has ratione temporis jurisdiction.

It is also common ground that the Claimant sent its notice of dispute to the Respondent
on 7 February 2017, requesting the Respondent to engage in negotiations for an amicable
settlement of the dispute,**° and sent two further letters requesting amicable
negotiations.*®’ The Claimant then initiated the present UNCITRAL arbitration on
15 November 2017.*** Hence, the six-month cooling-off period provided in Article 11(2)
has also been complied with.

In addition to these requirements, under Article 11(1) of the BIT the Claimant must show
that the dispute arises from “matters governed by this Agreement”. Further, it is a well-
established rule that, when examining their jurisdiction, tribunals must ascertain whether,
if proven, the facts alleged may constitute treaty breaches. Differently put, the claims
must fulfill the pro tem test.°*° The Iberdrola I tribunal found that these requirements —
which define the subject matter scope of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction — were not met, and
therefore found that it lacked jurisdiction ratione materiae. The question is whether this
finding is binding on this Tribunal. This is the point where the analysis of jurisdiction
intersects with the issue of res judicata.

ec. Res judicata

Although the Respondent has raised a number of objections to the jurisdiction of the
Tribunal and the admissibility of the claims, and the Parties have debated numerous
theories and arguments, the essential question which the Tribunal must resolve can be

The Respondent does not dispute the Claimant’s nationality, or that it qualifies as an investor under
Article 1(1) of the BIT.

framed in simple terms: Is this Tribunal barred from hearing the claims submitted to it by
virtue of a negative jurisdictional decision issued by an ICSID tribunal in respect of the
same dispute? If the answer is affirmative, then it puts an end to the inquiry. If it is
negative, then the Tribunal will need to examine other defenses raised by the Respondent.
In other words, the primary question before the Tribunal is whether the award issued in
Iberdrola I carries res judicata effects, and thus precludes this Tribunal from reopening
the jurisdictional question decided by the /berdrola I tribunal.

As noted by the ILA, “[t]he term res judicata refers to the general doctrine that an earlier
and final adjudication by a court or arbitration tribunal is conclusive in subsequent
proceedings involving the same subject matter or relief, the same legal grounds and the
same parties (the so-called ‘triple-identity’ criteria).”°°° Both Parties recognize that res
judicata is a general principle of law and a principle of international law. °°!

The ILA explains that res judicata has “a positive effect (namely, that a judgment or award
is final and binding between the parties and should be implemented, subject to any
available appeal or challenge); and a negative effect (namely, that the subject matter of
the judgment or award cannot be re-litigated a second time, also referred to as ne bis in
idem)” *°? As noted in the Orinoco case, it means that “a right, question or fact distinctly
put in issue and directly determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, as a ground of
recovery, cannot be disputed”.*°

. The decision issued by the Iberdrola I tribunal is an award on jurisdiction, more

specifically, a negative award on jurisdiction. It is undisputed that the Jberdrola I Award
did not rule on the merits of the claims, with the exception of the denial of justice claim.
Hence, the question is not whether the merits of the claims before this Tribunal have
already been decided; it is whether the jurisdiction of an investment tribunal constituted
under the BIT over the claims before the present Tribunal has already been decided, thus
precluding this Tribunal from reassessing that jurisdictional issue.

This question raises a number of sub-issues. Bearing in mind the findings on applicable
law reached above, the Tribunal must first ascertain whether a negative ruling on
jurisdiction can have res judicata effects (i). If this is so, then the requirements for a
successful res judicata defense must be identified and applied to determine whether the
Iberdrola I Award carries preclusive effects with respect to this arbitration (ii). This

determination will in particular imply a comparison between the claims involved in the
negative decision of Iberdrola I and those over which this Tribunal is requested to assess
jurisdiction. The Tribunal will then conclude as to whether the res judicata defense
precludes the present claims (iii).

@ Cana negative decision on jurisdiction have res judi effect?

The Parties agree — with certain nuances — that negative jurisdictional decisions can have
res judicata effect. Relying on ICJ jurisprudence, the Respondent submits that “[t]he
principle of res judicata applies both to arbitral awards on the merits of the dispute and
to decisions and awards on jurisdictional objections.”°°* The Claimant submits that
“decisions on jurisdiction do not have preclusive effects over merits issues”, but does not
deny that negative jurisdictional decisions carry res judicata effect.*°° Indeed, the
Claimant accepts that “in principle a decision on jurisdiction has res judicata effect as
regards the matters that it definitively decides [...].”°°° During the hearing, the Claimant
confirmed that the Jberdrola I Award is final and binding, but only regarding the issues
that it definitively settled (a subject discussed further below).°””

. This being so, in reliance on various decisions of international tribunals,*** the Claimant

submits that no res judicata bar applies when “the jurisdictional barrier or flaw can be
corrected.”3° In the same vein, the Claimant notes that under Swiss law “[...] the res
judicata effect of a negative jurisdictional decision rendered by a Swiss seated Tribunal
may depend on the grounds on which an arbitral tribunal found that it lacked
jurisdiction”.“©° The Respondent for its part “does not dispute the existence of certain
jurisdictional defects that may be remedied at a later date”; however, it contends that “the
opportunity to ‘cure’ a jurisdictional defect refers exclusively to essential procedural
requirements for submitting a dispute to arbitration involving claims that would otherwise
be premature”.*°! In the case at hand, “the Claimant’s legal strategy is not a defect that

can be corrected or ‘cured’ in this new arbitration”*”? since it is not a procedural
requirement.‘

. The Tribunal agrees with the Parties that an award declining jurisdiction in principle

carries res judicata effects, subject to certain exceptions addressed below (see § 267).
Under both international law and Swiss law, a negative decision on jurisdiction ends the
arbitral proceedings and is thus a final (and binding) award which carries preclusive
effects.** Article 53 of the ICSID Convention confirms the finality and finding force of
ICSID awards.

The ILA states in this respect that “[a]s to awards on jurisdiction and subject to the
applicable law, the Recommendations [on res judicata] do not exclude giving such
awards conclusive and preclusive effects."“°> The same report adds that “[a]n award
declining jurisdiction entails a decision that there is no agreement to arbitrate or that the
dispute does not fall within the ambit of the arbitration agreement, and accordingly the
general jurisdiction of domestic courts may revive.”4°°

. According to a recent treatise on res judicata “the majority of commentators appears to

agree that both positive and negative arbitral decisions on jurisdiction constitute ‘genuine
arbitral awards’ and should be entitled to the same res judicata effects as other arbitral
awards.”*°’ For instance, Fouchard, Gaillard and Goldman write that “[a] decision on
jurisdiction, the applicable law or the principle of liability [...] is a final decision on one
aspect of the dispute”, and “should therefore be considered as an award, against which an
immediate action to set aside can be brought”.*°8 Likewise, Born affirms that “a tribunal’s
determination that it lacks jurisdiction should be subject to annulment, recognition and

preclusive effects as an arbitral award under both national arbitration legislation and
international arbitration conventions.”*°?

. Swiss commentators also opine that a negative award on jurisdiction carries res judicata

effects. Some suggest that preclusion will depend on the grounds for declining
jurisdiction.*!° The following comment by Berger and Kellerhals is instructive:

If an arbitral tribunal with its seat in Switzerland renders an award declining
jurisdiction on the grounds that the arbitration agreement is invalid or
inexistent or does not cover the subject-matter of the dispute, such decision
must be recognised by, and thus is binding upon, any Swiss court or arbitral
tribunal with its seat in Switzerland seised at a later date with the same matter
between the same parties. Any Swiss authority seised second - whether a state
court or an arbitral tribunal - shall thus decide on its jurisdiction without
having the authority to re-examine the validity and existence of the arbitration
agreement at issue. The same applies if the award declining jurisdiction has
been made by an arbitral tribunal with its seat abroad, provided that such
award can be recognised in Switzerland under PILS, Art.194 and the [New
York Convention]. However, no binding effect emanates from a decision of
an arbitral tribunal declining jurisdiction merely on the grounds that the
claimant proceeded before the "wrong" arbitral tribunal or the "wrong" arbitral
institution (e.g. an arbitral tribunal under the auspices of the ICC instead of
the Swiss Chambers' Arbitration Institution).*"!

It is thus clear that a decision declining jurisdiction because the tribunal held that the
arbitration agreement was invalid or did not cover the subject matter of the dispute is res
judicata and has a preclusive effect on a second arbitral tribunal seised of the same matter.

By contrast, some jurisdictional flaws can be cured with the consequence that an award
denying jurisdiction is not preclusive. A jurisdictional defect may be remedied when a
procedural requirement was not previously complied with, such as a cooling-off period
or waiver. A defect may also be curable when the ground for declining jurisdiction is
specific to the first tribunal and does not apply to the second tribunal, for instance, when
the claimant has proceeded before the “wrong” arbitral institution; or if an ICSID tribunal
declines jurisdiction because either the respondent State or the home State of the investor

is not a party to the ICSID Convention; or because Article 27 of the ICSID Convention
has been breached; or because the dispute is about a class of disputes carved out by the
respondent State under Article 25(4).

In this case, we are not in the presence of any of these categories. Putting to one side for
present purposes the fork-in-the-road objection, there was no defect or impediment to the
making of the Jberdrola I claim, such as the granting of a waiver of other remedies as a
condition of submitting the claim to international arbitration*!”. Rather, after hearing the
Parties, in particular the Claimant’s arguments that certain Treaty breaches had been
made out and the Respondent’s arguments that the Claimant had failed to state a claim
based on the Treaty standards, the Jberdrola I tribunal denied jurisdiction because it found
that the claims as submitted by the Claimant were not “matters governed by the Treaty”
as required by Article 11(1). As discussed in more detail below, it found that the facts, as
alleged, could not amount to breaches of the Treaty. While the Claimant has argued that
the Jberdrola I tribunal’s decision was premised on the way in which the Claimant
formulated its claims, this is not a jurisdictional flaw that can be remedied. Claimants do
not get second opportunities to re-argue their cases simply because their pleadings in the
first proceeding were badly formulated.

The fact of the matter is that the Jberdrola I tribunal held that, even though the Claimant
repeatedly described the Respondent’s measures which it sought to impugn as breaches
of the Treaty, the dispute brought by the Claimant did not fall within the subject matter
scope of the arbitration agreement, and as a result, the tribunal lacked jurisdiction ratione
materiae. This is a final and binding decision that may carry res judicata effects, if the
requirements for the application of the res judicata principle are met, which is the
question to which the Tribunal now turns.

(ii) Requirements for res judicata

The Parties agree — and rightly so — that under international law the Tribunal must apply
the triple identity test to determine whether the Iberdrola I Award has res judicata cffect
for these proceedings ((1) below).*° They disagree however on whether this test is met
here. In this context, the Respondent advocates for an autonomous and flexible approach
to the triple identity test.

The failure to give the required waiver as prescribed in Chapter Eleven of the North American Free Trade
Agreement (“NAFTA”) is what precluded the claimant from pursuing its first claim in Waste Management,
Inc. v. United Mexican States. After the first claim was dismissed, the claimant started a new arbitration
request, this time accompanied by the required waiver in proper form. This led the second tribunal to
conclude that the defect in Waste Management I had been remedied and that the claim could now be heard,
thus, res judicata did not bar the second proceedings (see Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States
[II], ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Decision of the Tribunal of 26 June 2002 on Mexico’s Preliminary
Objection concerning the Previous Proceedings (Exh. CLA-022)).

Further, the Claimant submits that there is an additional requirement for res judicata to
apply: the claims raised in the first proceeding must have been “definitively settled” by
the previous decision ((2) below).

(1) _ Is the triple identity test met?

To establish whether res judicata is met, international courts and tribunals*!* have
consistently applied the triple identity test, which requires (i) identity of parties
(personae), (ii) identity of object (petitum), and (iii) identity of cause of action or legal
grounds (causa petendi) between the first and second proceedings.*!° As the ILA
explains, for an award to have conclusive and preclusive effects:

i. “[I]t must have been rendered between the same parties as the parties in the further
arbitration proceedings” (identity of parties);*"°

ii. “[T]he same claim or relief must be sought in the further arbitration proceedings”
(identity of object or subject matter);*!” and

iii. “[T]he claims or relief sought in further arbitration proceedings must be based on
the same cause of action as in the prior arbitration proceedings”. *!®

. The ILA also adds a fourth requirement: “the prior award must be final and binding and

capable of recognition in the country where the arbitral tribunal of the subsequent
arbitration proceedings has its seat”.*!? The Parties have not specifically discussed this

requirement; however, it is indisputable that the Jberdrola I Award is final, binding, and
capable of recognition in Switzerland, as was already mentioned above.

As the Parties recognize, Swiss courts apply a similar test to determine if a previous
decision is res judicata, but limited to the following two requirements: (i) identity of the
parties and (ii) identity of the subject matter of the dispute.*”° The identity of the subject
matter is defined by reference to the facts and the request for relief without requiring
identity of cause of action.*”! In other words, it is sufficient that the same parties have
already submitted the same request for relief based on the same facts to another court.*??

Applying the more stringent test found in international law, the Tribunal finds that there
is triple identity between the Jberdrola I proceedings and the present proceedings for the
following reasons. If that test is met, the requirements of Swiss law will necessarily be
fulfilled too.

First, it is undisputed that there is identity of parties, as both cases involve Iberdrola
Energia S.A. as the clai and the Republic of G as the respond

Second, it is also undisputed that there is identity of object or petitum.’?> The Iberdrola I
Award being a decision on jurisdiction, the question arises whether one must focus on the
petitum on the merits or on the (implied) request to uphold jurisdiction over the dispute.
In reality, both probably should be addressed: jurisdiction, because the present objection
aims at a jurisdictional decision, and merits, and because jurisdiction can only be defined
by reference to a substantive dispute.

Starting with the substantive petitum, in both cases the Claimant requested the tribunal to
hold that Guatemala had violated Article 3 of the Treaty and to order the State to pay
compensation. Specifically, in Jberdrola I, the Claimant sought the following relief with
regard to the merits:

Further, in both cases the factual matrix is identical.*”” This implies that the Claimant
requested the Iberdrola I tribunal to uphold its jurisdiction in relation to claims, facts and
an arbitration agreement all of which are identical to those invoked in the case at hand.

Third, there is identity of cause of action. The legal ground invoked by the Claimant as
basis for the Tribunal’s jurisdiction in both cases is identical, namely Article 11(1) of the
Treaty. More specifically, the basis for the Tribunal to assess its jurisdiction is the Parties’
consent to submit their investment dispute to arbitration, which results from the
Respondent’s offer found in Article 11(1) of the Treaty and from the Claimant’s
acceptance of such offer through the filing of the Request for Arbitration. The fact that
the Iberdrola I arbitration was conducted under different arbitration rules than the present
case is not relevant. Indeed, the jurisdiction of the Tribunal does not arise from the
arbitration rules chosen by the Claimant, but from Article 11(1) of the Treaty and the
Parties’ consent to arbitrate.

There is also identity of cause of action with regard to the merits. In both cases, the
Claimant has invoked the same legal basis for the claims, namely, a breach of Article 3
of the Treaty. While the Claimant admits so much, it argues that there is no identity of

cause of action,*?8 because the Iberdrola I tribunal held that the claims were grounded on
national law, as opposed to international law.

. The Tribunal cannot uphold that argument. To determine whether there is identity of

cause of action, the legal authorities confirm that what must be compared are the legal
grounds relied upon by the claimant in support of the relief sought.” The
characterization of that legal ground by the Iberdrola I Award is thus irrelevant. As the
Respondent argues, the requirement of identity of cause of action bars the Claimant from
raising the same claim a second time “in a new light.”“*° Indeed, as stated above, the way
in which the Claimant previously sought to argue its claims of breach of international law
cannot now be characterized as a curable jurisdictional defect.

The Respondent also argues in the alternative that what matters is whether the claims in
Iberdrola I were based on the facts alleged in this second arbitration,**! which the
Claimant has admitted is the case.**? It submits that “the contemporary trend in
international arbitration is an autonomous and flexible approach to res judicata”*> and
that “[i]Jnstead of rigid identity tests, an overall assessment of the parties involved, the
legal grounds invoked, the objects pursued and the underlying facts will be necessary in
order to avoid a multiplication of proceedings with its inherent danger of conflicting
outcome”.**4 While the Claimant has also endorsed a less formalistic approach to res

judicata,” it disagrees with the Respondent’s attempt to focus only on the parties to the

dispute and the underlying facts, arguing that the scope of res judicata “is also limited by
the object of the claims (the relief sought) and fundamentally by their legal basis (i.e., the
causa petendi).” °°

Having held that the formal triple identity test is met, the Tribunal can dispense with
entering this debate. However, for the sake of completeness, it notes that if it were to
adopt a less formalistic test, it would likewise reach the conclusion that the subject matter
of the dispute is identical.

(2) Was the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione materiae “definitively
settled” by the Iberdrola I tribunal?

In reliance on ICJ jurisprudence,*” the Claimant asserts that a further requirement must
be fulfilled for the [berdrola I Award to carry res judicata effects over the present
proceedings: the claims brought in the later proceedings must have been finally decided
in the prior action.*** According to the Claimant’s expert Prof. Reisman, the application
of res judicata in public international law “is confined to the preclusion of claims that not
only have been raised but have been decided with finality in the earlier judgment”.*? As
a result, the res judicata objection requires the Tribunal “to review in detail the prior
award in order to determine whether or not the object of the claim or claims before it had
been definitively decided by the prior tribunal.”*“°

For the Claimant, the task is to “compar[e] what was decided in the Iberdrola I award and
what claims have been submitted here”.*! To do so, it adds that “it may be necessary to
determine the meaning of the operative clause by reference to the reasoning set out in the
judgement in question”.“? In this respect, Iberdrola contends that “the tribunal in
Iberdrola I did not decide any treaty claims, characterizing the claims before it as
Guatemalan law claims”.“*? The Respondent denies that the res judicata authority of an

award is limited to what the tribunal decided “expressly or by necessary implication” ,“#*

but does not dispute that the Tribunal must establish what the first tribunal definitively
resolved. The Respondent further accepts that the reasoning behind the operative part of
the award must be taken into account for purposes of establishing the scope of res
judicata.“

The Claimant is correct in pointing out that under international law res judicata will only
bar a second adjudication if the claims before the second court or tribunal have been
“definitively settled” in the first proceedings. The ICJ has recalled this requirement in
two recent decisions, Nicaragua v. Colombia and Costa Rica v. Nicaragua, in the
following terms:

It is not sufficient, for the application of res judicata, to identify the case at
issue, characterized by the same parties, object and legal ground; it is also
necessary to ascertain the content of the decision, the finality of which is to be
guaranteed. The Court cannot be satisfied merely by an identity between
requests successively submitted to it by the same Parties; it must determine

whether and to what extent the first claim has already been definitively
settled.¥°

[Flor res judicata to apply in a given case, the Court ‘must determine whether
and to what extent the first claim has already been definitively settled’ [...]
for ‘[i]f a matter has not in fact been determined, expressly or by necessary
implication, then no force of res judicata attaches to it’.“””

It is equally correct, as both Parties agree, that not only the operative part of a judgment
or award has res judicata authority, but that the second court or tribunal may consult the
reasons to elucidate the meaning of the operative part.*** This is particularly true in the
case of negative decisions on jurisdiction, where the operative part may not state which
jurisdictional requirement was deemed to be lacking.

Accordingly, the Tribunal must now review the operative part of the Jberdrola I Award,
if necessary in light of the relevant reasons, to establish whether the claims raised in this
arbitration were definitively settled in the ICSID proceedings.

PCA Case No. 2017-41
Final Award
24 August 2020

The operative part of the Iberdrola I Award provides as follows:

El Tribunal Arbitral, de conformidad con los Articulos 41, 48 y 61 del
Convenio del CIADI y las Reglas 28, 41 y 47 de las Reglas de Arbitraje, por
unanimidad resuelve:

1. Aceptar la excepcién a la jurisdiccién del CIADI y a la competencia del
Tribunal presentada por la Republica de Guatemala, con respecto a las
peticiones de la Demandante de que se declare la ocurrencia de una
expropiacién; la violacién del estdéndar de trato justo y equitativo; la
violacion de la obligacion de proporcionar plena proteccion y seguridad; la
violacion de la obligacion de no interferir en la inversion y la obligacion de
Guatemala de cumplir las obligaciones contraidas en relacién con las
inversiones de la Demandante;

2. Denegar la pretensién de la Demandante de que la Republica de
Guatemala incurrié en este caso en actos de denegacion de justicia;

3. Declarar que la Demandante debe asumir la totalidad de sus propios costos
y la totalidad de los costos en que incurrié la Parte Demandada que ascienden
ala suma de USD $5.312.107.°

As is evident from the language just quoted, the Iberdrola I Award granted the
Respondent’s objection to jurisdiction over the claims for expropriation, FET, full
protection and security, and the impairment and umbrella clauses. It is clear that the
claims over which jurisdiction is denied are Treaty claims. To understand whether the
denial is due to a defect that can be remedied,*°° one must turn to the body of the Award.

The Iberdrola I Award records that the Respondent raised a defense of lack of jurisdiction
ratione materiae because the dispute was contractual and regulatory in nature and did not
concern matters governed by the Treaty as required by the Treaty’s dispute settlement
clause:

a. Iberdrola somete al Tribunal un desacuerdo cuya base esencial es
regulatoria y contractual y que no puede calificarse como
controversia segtin el Tratado. Consecuentemente, no hay
jurisdiccién ratione materiae.

LJ

Seguin la Demandada, sus excepciones se refieren a la jurisdiccién ratione
materiae del Tribunal y se basan, en gran parte, en el hecho de que la
Demandante no ha sometido al Tribunal una reclamacién ‘respecto a

294. A review of the analysis contained in the Iberdrola I Award shows that that tribunal

granted this objection. It held that the facts as alleged, if proven, could not constitute
Treaty breaches.*” It reached this conclusion because, in its opinion, Iberdrola’s claims,
except for the denial of justice claim which was adjudicated, concerned matters of
Guatemalan law.**3 Not being Treaty claims, the relief sought by the Claimant fell outside
the scope of the arbitration provision embodied in Article 11 of the Treaty, which applies
only to disputes in relation to investments between a Contracting Party and an investor of
the other Contracting Party “respecto a cuestiones reguladas por el presente Acuerdo”.
The Jberdrola I tribunal made its determination after Iberdrola was given a full
opportunity to make its case both before, during and after the hearing. The tribunal even
expressly requested Iberdrola for a statement in its post-hearing brief about “las supuestas
violaciones al Tratado que se habian dado, en qué consistian y mediante cudles actos
espectficos se habian concretado” .***

To fully understand why the Jberdrola I tribunal declined jurisdiction, it is helpful to
quote the relevant passages of the analysis in full:

[349] Como bien se puede observar en los diferentes escritos y alegaciones
formuladas a lo largo de este arbitraje, la sustentacién de la
Demandante de la alegada violacién de Guatemala de los esténdares
del Tratado se basa en las diferencias de interpretacién de las normas
de la Republica de Gi la y de las f le icas para

una discusi6n de derecho local, que no tiene competencia para retomar
y volver a resolver como si fuera una corte de apelacién. [...)

[350] Para el Tribunal Arbitral es claro, como se expondrd mds adelante, que
un tribunal internacional no tiene competencia por el solo hecho de que
una de las partes del proceso afirme que el derecho internacional ha

calificacién que la Demandante dio a los temas controvertidos, la parte
ial de esos temas y, sobre todo, de las controversias que la
Demandante pide al Tribunal que resuelva, se refieren al derecho
guatemalteco. En los distintos escritos presentados durante el
arbitraje, las Partes debatieron in extenso sobre la forma en la que
debian interpretarse determinadas disposiciones del derecho
guatemalteco, y particularmente, las disposiciones de la LGE y el
RLGE.

LJ

[353] Por la forma en que se desarrollaron el debate y las audiencias y por
los temas que se plantearon, este proceso semejaba mds un arbitraje
comercial internacional que uno de inversi6n. Por ello, el Tribunal de
manera expresa solicité a las Partes un pronunciamiento sobre las
supuestas violaciones al Tratado que se habian dado, en qué consistian
y mediante cudles actos espectficos se habian concretado. En su Escrito
Posterior a la Audiencia, la Demandante, si bien vuelve a citar las
normas del Tratado y a referirse a decisiones de otros tribunales
internacionales, se siguid centrando en las diferencias de
interpretacioén, segtin el derecho guatemalteco, de los temas tantas
veces mencionados en el presente laudo. El Tribunal reitera que mds
alla de etiquetar las conductas de la CNEE como violatorias del
Tratado, no planted la Demandante una controversia bajo el Tratado y
el derecho internacional, sino un debate técnico, financiero y juridico
sobre disposiciones del derecho del Estado demandado.

LJ

[355] En resumen, la Demandante pide al Tribunal que actiie como juez de
instancia para definir el debate que se dio de acuerdo con el derecho
guatemalteco y que le conceda la raz6n en su interpretacién de cada
uno de los asuntos debatidos, de manera que, a partir de esa decisién
de este Tribunal Arbitral, la Demandante pueda construir y reclamar
una violacion de los esténdares del Tratado.

 

[356] Para el Tribunal es evidente que la controversia planteada por la
Demandante en este arbitraje versa sobre derecho _ nacional
guatemalteco y que la simple mencién del Tratado y la calificacién de

 

 

las de G la que hace Iberdrola, conforme a los
estandares de ese Tratado, no basta para que la controversia se
convierta en una sobre “ i reguladas” por el Tratado.

 

[357] Seguin se sefiald, la Demandante no demostré que si su posicién en
cuanto a las diferencias de derecho local que originaron este conflicto
fuera la correcta, la consecuencia seria que la Demandada vulneré el
Tratado o el derecho internacional. Tal demostracién es necesaria
para que el CIADI pueda tener jurisdicci6n y el Tribunal competencia.
Asi parece reconocerlo la propia Demandante, quien afirmé que “...no
se trata de demostrar elementos suficientes para que el Tribunal decida

[358] El debate de derecho internacional que se dio durante este proceso fue
meramente tedrico, referente a la procedencia de la aplicacién a este
caso de lo resuelto en algunos laudos que la Demandante cité, asi como
sobre el contenido de los estdndares de proteccién. Sin embargo, en

English translation:

[349] As may be observed in the various submissions and pleadings provided
throughout this arbitration, the Claimant’s foundation for the alleged
violation of the Treaty standards by Guatemala is based on the
discrepancies between EEGSA and the CNEE during the tariff-setting
process for the 2008-2013 term on the interpretation of the norms of the
Republic of G a and the ic formulas to calculate the
VAD. Beyond labelling the Respondent's actions, the Claimant does
not present a clear and specific reasoning as to which are, in its view
the acts of imperium of the Republic of Guatemala which, under
international law, could amount to Treaty violations. In the Claimant’s
pleadings, the Tribunal can only find a discussion about domestic law.
which it has no competence to resume and resolve again as if it were a
court of appeals. [...]

 

[350]It is clear to the Tribunal, as will be explained below, that an
international tribunal does not become competent merely because one
of the parties to the proceedings states that there has been a breach of
international law. In a case as the one raised by the Claimant in this
arbitration, the Tribunal would only have jurisdiction had the Claimant
demonstrated that the facts it alleged, if proven, could amount to a
Treaty violation. As analyzed below, the Claimant did not demonstrate

this basic premise and simply submitted a dispute about Guatemalan
domestic law for the Tribunal’s consideration.

[351] As stated by the Tribunal and reflected on the record, beyond the
Claimant's characterization of the disputed matters, the essential part of
these matters and, especially, of the disputes that the Claimant asks the
Tribunal to resolve, concern Guatemalan law. In the various written
submissions filed during the arbitration, the Parties discussed broadly
how certain provisions of Guatemalan law, and particularly, of the LGE
and the RLGE, should be interpreted.

L.]

 

[353] Based on how the discussion and the hearings developed and the
matters that were raised, this proceeding resembled an international
commercial arbitration rather than an investment one. Thus, the
Tribunal expressly requested a statement from the Parties on the alleged

86

PCA Case No. 2017-41
Final Award
24 August 2020

violations of the Treaty that had taken place, what they entailed and
through which specific actions they had materialized. In its Post-
Hearing Brief, the Claimant, while again quoting the provisions of the
Treaty and referring to the decisions of other international tribunals,
continued focusing on the differing interpretations, according to
Guatemalan law, of the matters repeatedly mentioned in the present
award. The Tribunal reiterates that beyond labelling the CNEE’s
conduct as a Treaty violation, the Claimant did not bring a dispute under
the Treaty and international law, but rather a technical, financial and
legal debate on the legal provisions of the respondent State.

[.]

[355] In summary, the Claimant asks the Tribunal to act as an instance judge
to settle the debate that took place in accordance with Guatemalan law
and that it sides with the Claimant’s interpretation of each of the
disputed matters, such that, based on that decision of this Arbitral
Tribunal, the Claimant may build and claim a violation of the Treaty
standards.

[356] It is evident to the Tribunal that the dispute raised by the Claimant in
this arbitration revolves around Guatemalan domestic law and that
simply mentioning the Treaty and characterizing Guatemala’s actions
as Iberdrola has done, pursuant to the standards in that Treaty. is
insufficient for the dispute to become one about “matters governed” by
the Treaty.

[357] As was noted, the Claimant did not demonstrate that if its position with
regard to the discrepancies on domestic law that gave rise to this
conflict was correct, the consequence would be that the Respondent
breached the Treaty or international law. Such demonstration is
necessary for ICSID to have jurisdiction and for the Tribunal to be
competent. The Claimant seems to acknowledge as much by stating that
“... it is not about proving sufficient elements for the Tribunal to
preliminarily decide whether or not there is a violation of the provisions
in the Treaty (that is a question for the merits), but rather about
verifying that the alleged facts, if true, could amount to a violation of
the provisions in the Treaty”.

[358] The debate on international law that took place during this proceeding
was merely theoretical, related to the appropriateness of applying the
findings of some awards that the Claimant cited to this case, as well as
about the content of the protection standards. However, in sum, there is
no connection in the Claimant’s written submissions between the facts
it alleges and the standards it invokes, nor there is an embodiment of
the act or acts of imperium which, in light of international law, could

have been as violations of its rights ding to the
455
Treaty.

PCA Case No. 2017-41
Final Award
24 August 2020

The excerpts quoted demonstrate that having heard the evidence, the Iberdrola I tribunal
decided that these claims were not capable of amounting to Treaty breaches and
consequently did not fall within the ambit of the Treaty’s arbitration clause. Hence, the
matter “definitively settled” in the Jberdrola I Award, to use the ICJ’s words, is the
existence of jurisdiction pursuant to Article 11 of the Treaty over the same Treaty claims
as the ones before this Tribunal.

In spite of the content of the Jberdrola I Award just described, the Claimant contends that
the findings in that decision were premised on the manner in which the Claimant had
formulated its claims. According to the Claimant, the Jberdrola I tribunal “did not
conclude that the factual matrix at the origin of the dispute could not give rise to treaty
claims, but that, as formulated by Iberdrola, the claims in [berdrola I were local law
claims premised on the violation of local law with respect to which the tribunal lacked
jurisdiction to make a ruling.”*°6

That contention is ill-conceived. As was already stressed, the Iberdrola I tribunal
considered that the Claimant did not establish that the facts, as alleged, could amount to
violations of the Treaty.*°’ More specifically, the tribunal observed that “in the
Claimant’s written submissions there [was] no connection between the facts it alleged
and the standards it invoked, nor did they point to the act or acts of imperium that,
pursuant to international law, could have been characterized as violations of its rights
under the Treaty.”*5* While the tribunal’s reasoning was based on a lack of “connection”
between the facts and the treaty breaches involved, the conclusion was clear: the Claimant
failed to show that the facts alleged could constitute breaches of the Treaty. The Iberdrola
J tribunal’s finding was the result of an assessment of the factual matrix of the case. It
was not based on the formulation of the claims. In any event, even if the [berdrola I
tribunal had been influenced by that formulation, that would make no difference to the
outcome of the present proceedings, because the formulation of a claim is not a curable
defect, and the claims are the same treaty claims in both cases, as was established earlier.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal emphasizes that its conclusion is in conformity
with the ICJ decisions in Nicaragua v. Colombia and Costa Rica v. Nicaragua.

In its 2016 judgment in the first case, the Court considered and rejected Colombia’s
objection to Nicaragua’s claim based on the alleged res judicata effect of the Court’s
prior 2012 judgment in which the Court determined that it was “not in a position to
delimit” a continental shelf boundary.*? The Court framed the issue before it as a
question of admissibility in the following terms:

In particular, the Court will determine whether subparagraph 3 of the operative
clause of its 2012 Judgment must be understood as a straightforward dismissal
of Nicaragua’s request for lack of evidence, as Colombia claims, or a refusal
to rule on the request because a procedural and institutional requirement had
not been fulfilled, as Nicaragua argues.“

The clear implication of this passage was the Court’s acceptance that if it had earlier
considered the claim and dismissed it for lack of evidence, res judicata would bar a
second attempt by Nicaragua to seek adjudication. If, on the other hand, the Court had
previously refused to rule on the request because a procedural and institutional
requirement had not been fulfilled, res judicata would not bar the second submission.

Seeking to establish the meaning of the 2012 judgment, the Court focused its analysis on
whether or not Nicaragua had previously put the Court into the position of being able to
adjudicate Nicaragua’s claims namely by inquiring whether Nicaragua had complied with
the precondition in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (“UNCLOS”)
for seeking a delimitation of the continental shelf between Nicaragua and Colombia in
the area beyond 200 nautical miles of the Nicaragua coast. The Court looked beyond the
dispositif of the 2012 Judgment and reviewed the reasoning in order to ascertain whether
it was res judicata.

This review led the Court to conclude that it had dismissed Nicaragua’s claim in 2012
“because the latter had yet to discharge its obligation, under paragraph 8 of Article 76 of
UNCLOS, to deposit with the CLCS the information on the limits of its continental shelf
beyond 200 nautical miles required by that provision and by Article 4 of Annex II of
UNCLOS”.**! In other words, “delimitation of the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical
miles from the Nicaraguan coast was conditional on the submission by Nicaragua of
information on the limits of its continental shelf’.“? This information had not been
provided in 2012, with the result that “[t]he Court thus did not settle the question of
delimitation in 2012, because it was not, at that time, in a position to do so”.*® In the
meantime, in 2013, Nicaragua had provided the missing information. Consequently, the
Court considered that “the condition imposed by it in its 2012 Judgment in order for it to
be able to examine the claim of Nicaragua [...] ha[d] been fulfilled in the present case”,
ie. in the proceedings leading to the 2016 judgment. **

This makes clear that the Court accepted Nicaragua’s submission of the continental shelf
delimitation in 2016 because it could not have considered it in 2012 due to Nicaragua’s
non-compliance with UNCLOS’ precondition to the submission of such a claim. Having
complied with that condition precedent, Nicaragua’s right to have its claim heard by the

Court was perfected. In other words, the Court was now put into a position where it could
resolve what it could not resolve in the earlier proceeding.

The same kind of analysis is made in the 2018 Judgment in Costa Rica v. Nicaragua.
Costa Rica’s contention that the earlier judgment of the Court had res judicata effect was
rejected because the issue that was put before the Court in the later case had been excluded
from the Court’s consideration in the earlier 2015 decision. Indeed, a review of that earlier
judgment showed that “no decision was taken by the Court in its 2015 Judgment on the
question of sovereignty concerning the coast of the northern part of Isla Portillos, since
this question had been expressly excluded. This mean[t] that it [was] not possible for the
issue of sovereignty over that part of the coast to be res judicata.”*°

. The situations leading the Court to deny the application of res judicata in these two

judgments stand in stark contrast to the present case. Indeed, there is no contention in this
arbitration that there was an unsatisfied condition precedent to the submission of the
Treaty claims to ICSID such that the Iberdrola I tribunal could not have been seised of
the Treaty claims now before this Tribunal (as in Nicaragua v. Colombia).*© Nor did the
Iberdrola I tribunal hold that part of the international law claims were carved out from its
consideration and therefore left open for adjudication by the present Tribunal (as in
Nicaragua v. Costa Rica). Hence, in reliance on the Court’s jurisprudence, the only valid
conclusion in the present circumstances is that the binding force of the Jberdrola I Award
established by Article 53 of the ICSID Convention must be recognized.

(iii) Conclusion on res judicata

For these reasons, the Tribunal finds that the Jberdrola I Award definitively settled the
question as to whether the claims brought in the present arbitration relate to “matters
governed by the Treaty” under Article 11(1). The Jberdrola I tribunal’s decision was that
they did not, and as a result, it determined that it had no jurisdiction ratione materiae.
Having been definitively settled in the Iberdrola I Award, this Tribunal cannot revisit
jurisdiction. It must therefore deny jurisdiction over the present claims.

The Tribunal has reached this conclusion on the basis of international law, but notes that
it is not inconsistent with Swiss law. In the Tribunal’s view, the Iberdrola I award has the
same res judicata effect in Switzerland as it has under international law.

tribunal held that the claimant’s failure to provide a valid waiver of other remedies as a condition for the
submission of the NAFTA claim was not compliant with the requirements of NAFTA Chapter Eleven and
therefore dismissed the claim. After the claimant cured the defect by filing a second waiver in proper form,
the new tribunal held that it was in a position to hear the dispute on the merits because the prior tribunal
had not done so ~ it having merely decided that no valid waiver had been given.

While the Tribunal has noted the Claimant’s assertions of unfairness and denial of justice,
the fact is that res judicata pursues an important policy objective, namely, avoiding that
the same issues be litigated over and over again and thereby ensuring legal certainty. As
noted by the ICJ, “the principle of res judicata [...] protects, at the same time, the judicial
function of a court or tribunal and the parties to a case which has led to a judgment that
is final and without appeal”.“*’ Similarly, the ILA writes that “[tJhe rationale for the res
judicata doctrine finds expression in two Latin maxims: Interest reipublicae ut sit finis
litium (‘it is in the public interest that there should be an end of litigation’) [and] Nemo
debet bis vexari pro una et eadem causa (‘no one should be proceeded against twice for
the same cause’)[.] The former is a matter of public policy, and the latter is a matter of
private justice”.‘ All these objectives are relevant in international investment
arbitration.

The contrary solution would open the floodgates. It would put into question the finality
of arbitral awards and threaten legal certainty, as dissatisfied investors could file their
claims multiple times in the hope that a new tribunal would uphold jurisdiction.
Obviously, decisions declining jurisdiction because of a failure to meet a procedural
requirement or because the ground to deny jurisdiction was specific to the first tribunal,
would not bar claimants from refiling the claim once the defect had been corrected. These
exceptions to the res judicata authority of negative jurisdictional decisions provide the
necessary safeguards to ensure access to justice and avoid unfairness.

. In light of this result, the Tribunal could end its inquiry here. However, because it is the

basis of the counterclaim, the Tribunal will review the defenses linked to the fork-in-the-
road clause.

d. Fork in the road

. The Respondent also contends that Article 11(2) of the Treaty is a fork-in-the-road clause,

and that this fork in the road has been triggered not once, but twice by the Claimant. In
addition, it argues, cven if the Tribunal were to find that the fork in the road has not been
triggered, that Article 26 of the ICSID Convention precludes the Claimant from bringing
this UNCITRAL proceeding.

The Claimant’s position is essentially that Article 11(2) is not a fork-in-the-road clause.
Even if it was, that clause was not triggered by EEGSA’s domestic proceedings or by the
Iberdrola I proceedings, and in any event, Article 26 of the ICSID Convention has no
application here.

To rule on this objection, the Tribunal must thus decide whether Article 11(2) is a fork-
in-the-road provision (ii); if it was triggered (iii); and if Article 26 of the ICSID
Convention precludes the present proceedings (iv). Before turning to these questions, the
Tribunal will address the Claimant’s preliminary argument that the Respondent’s fork-
in-the-road objection fails because of its alternative nature (i).

(@) The Claimant’s preliminary argument

As a preliminary matter, the Claimant contends that, because the Respondent has
formulated it in the alternative to its res judicata objection, the fork-in-the-road objection
is premised on the fact that Iberdrola is presenting a different claim in this case than in
prior cases. According to the Claimant, this disposes of the fork-in-the-road argument:
“Lif the claims in this arbitration are different from the ones submitted in the prior cases,
Iberdrola cannot have exercised a via electa in relation to this dispute and claims.”*

. The Respondent opposes this submission. It agrees that, if res judicata and fork in the

road were equivalent concepts interpreted as the Claimant does, a fork-in-the-road clause
could not give rise to an alternative objection. However, it is of the view that these
concepts are not equivalent, nor should they be interpreted as the Claimant proposes.

. The Tribunal does not understand that the Respondent’s fork-in-the-road objection is

premised on the present claims being different from those submitted in prior cases. It
understands the Respondent’s position to be that the claims advanced in Jberdrola I are
identical to the ones brought here. On this basis, the Respondent’s primary objection is
that the claims have already been decided and as such are precluded by res judicata.
Alternatively, should the Tribunal reject this objection, it is the Respondent’s submission
that the Claimant is attempting to litigate the same dispute before a third forum in
violation of Article 11(2) of the BIT.

The Tribunal does not consider these alternative arguments to be incompatible. As
addressed below, the concepts of res judicata and fork in the road are different and require
different elements to be met.

(ii) Is Article 11(2) a fork-in-the-road provision?

The Respondent submits that Article 11(2) of the Treaty is a fork-in-the-road clause,
which provides that an investor of the other Contracting State may only have recourse to
one forum to resolve a dispute that may arise with the host State under the Treaty. For
Guatemala, this article provides for three alternative and at the same time exclusive
dispute settlement options, which is shown by the use of the expression “at the choice of

the investor” and of the conjunctive “or”.47°

Mem.,§ 260.

PCA Case No. 2017-41
Final Award
24 August 2020

The Claimant disputes that Article 11(2) contains a fork-in-the-road clause. It contends
that this provision “does not establish that the choice of one or the other of the
mechanisms by the investor shall be final” and thus “does not prevent an investor that had
recourse to an infructuous via to go to a second forum to have its claims decided.”*7! The
Claimant explains in this context that investment treaties usually resort to one of two
limiting techniques: they either require the investor to choose a method of dispute
resolution ab initio and estop it from subsequently relitigating the dispute in another
forum, or they allow the investor to pursue all domestic remedies, but once the investor
chooses investment arbitration, it must waive its rights to pursue another form of dispute
settlement.*” It notes that neither of these techniques originates from a general principle
of international law, so in order to make the investor’s choice irrevocable, an express rule
is needed. However, Article 11 contains no such express rule. Finally, Iberdrola draws
attention to the treaty practice of both Contracting States, asserting that they later
expressly so stated when they intended the choice of forum to be irrevocable.

21. To interpret Article 11(2), the Tribunal must resort to the rules of treaty interpretation

contained in Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT. Accordingly, it must interpret the Treaty in
good faith giving the terms their ordinary meaning in their context and in light of the
object and purpose of the Treaty .47°

. In doing so, it must consider other agreements, instruments, or rules specified in

paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 31, as well as any special meaning the Contracting Parties
intended to give to a term (Article 31(4)). Under Article 32, the Tribunal may consider
supplementary means of interpretation to confirm the meaning of the Treaty resulting
from the application of the rules just described, or to determine its meaning if these rules
lead to a result that is ambiguous or obscure, or manifestly absurd or unreasonable.

The relevant language is found in Article 11(2) of the Treaty and reads as follows:

Si la controversia no pudiera ser resuelta de esta forma en un plazo de seis
meses a contar desde la fecha de notificacién escrita mencionada en el
p4rrafo 1, la controversia podrd someterse, a eleccidn del inversor:

Final Award
24 August 2020

English translation:

If the dispute cannot be resolved in this manner within a term of six months
from the date of written notice mentioned in paragraph 1, the dispute may be
submitted, at the choice of the investor:

a) to the competent courts of the Contracting Party in whose territory the
investment was made; or

b) to an ad hoc arbitral tribunal established in accordance with the Arbitration
Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law; or

c) to the Intemational Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)
[...]. (Emphasis added)

Looking first at the ordinary meaning of the terms, it is clear that the text gives the investor
a choice. It is equally clear that it does not expressly say whether an investor who has
made use of the right to choose with respect to a given dispute can later make another
choice or not for the same dispute. In other words, it does not explicitly state whether the
choice afforded is revocable or irrevocable. Yet, the ordinary meaning of the terms “a
eleccién del inversor” and of the conjunction “o” implies that the investor must choose
one or the other mechanism, as opposed to two or three.

According to the Dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy, the term “eleccidn”
(“choice”) is defined as the action and effect of choosing (“elegir”).*”* The Dictionary
defines the verb “elegir” as “[e]scoger o preferir a alguien o algo para un fin” *” i.e. to
choose or prefer someone or something for a purpose. The term “escoger” does not help
much, as it is a synonym of “elegir”, but the term “preferir” (to prefer) is telling, as it
implies a selection whereby one option is preferred to others, which are not selected. The
use of the disjunctive conjunction “or” (“o”) confirms and reinforces the alternative
nature of this choice, as it “denotes a difference, separation or alternative between two or
more persons, things or ideas”, or is used “before each of two or more opposed terms”.4”°
Or in simpler terms, “or” is not “and”. Hence, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that
the ordinary meaning of the words signifies that, once an investor has made a choice, he
cannot make another one for the same dispute. The right to choose a forum afforded by
the Treaty has been exercised and is thereby exhausted. While the clause does not
expressly say that the choice cannot be renewed or is irrevocable, that is the unavoidable
consequence of the words used.

“eleccién”, Diccionario de la lengua espafiola de la Real Academia Espajiola (‘‘1. f. Accién y efecto de

. The context of the provision does not lead to a different conclusion. In fact, there is not

much that the Tribunal can turn to as context: there are no other pertinent Treaty clauses;
the Treaty has no annexes; nor have the Parties pointed to any instruments that might
qualify as context under Article 31(2) of the VCLT, or that must be taken into account
under Article 31(3) of the VCLT. The Tribunal is thus left with the location of the
provision and the Preamble. In terms of its location, Article 11(2) is part of the clause
governing dispute resolution between an investor and the Contracting Party, but this does
not assist in characterizing the choice of forum given to the investor. Nor does the
Preamble provide useful guidance: it is limited to stating that the Contracting Parties
“[w]ish[] to intensify economic cooperation in the mutual benefit of both countries”;
“[iJntend[] to create favorable conditions for investments made by investors of each of
the Contracting Parties in the territory of the other”, and “[rJecogniz[e] that the promotion
and protection of investments in accordance with this Agreement stimulates initiatives in
this field.”*””

While it does not strictly qualify as context, the Claimant argues that the Contracting
Parties’ treaty practice reveals that, when they intended a choice to be irrevocable, they
provided so expressly. It stresses that both Spain and Guatemala have signed treaties
including express language of irrevocability but did not do so in this case. This argument
does not carry the Claimant very far. It is true that the clause could have been written in
stronger terms, but it is indisputable that the provision uses the words “or” and “at the
choice of the investor”. The fact that this Treaty included no explicit language as to the
irrevocable nature of the choice once made does not deprive the existing words of their
ordinary meaning, and the Tribunal does not consider that it was necessary to add mention
of irrevocability ‘for greater certainty’ in order to confirm what is already clear from the
text as drafted.

Moreover, this reading of Article 11(2) is consistent with the object and purpose of the
fork-in-the-road clause. The Parties generally agree — correctly so — that such object and
purpose is to “avoid [...] the duplication of proceedings and the risk of conflicting
decisions.”*”8 As noted by Douglas, “[t]he rationale underpinning the ‘fork in the road’
provision in investment treaties is clearly the avoidance of multiple proceedings in
multiple fora in relation to the same investment dispute. In more colloquial terms, it is
designed to prevent the investor having several bites at the cherry.”*”? The Claimant
rightly emphasizes that this rationale applies only to a ‘true’ fork-in-the-road provision,
i.e., when there is “a clear and unequivocal manifestation of will” from the contracting

parties that the choice of forum is irrevocable.*®° The Tribunal concurs in the sense that
the interpretation of the Treaty under the rules of the VCLT must show an intent to
provide only one choice for a given dispute. That is precisely the result of the
interpretation exercise just conducted.

That being said, the fork-in-the-road clause at Article 11(2) is only triggered when the
investor attempts to submit the same “dispute” (“controversia’”) to second forum.

(iii) What type of disputes trigger the fork-in-the-road clause? Has the
fork-in-the-road provision been triggered?

. The Parties appear to agree that the essential criterion to assess whether the fork-in-the-

road clause is triggered is whether the investor has submitted the “same dispute” to more
than one forum. They disagree, however, on the test to determine the identity of the
dispute.

. Relying inter alia on H&H and Pantechniki, the Respondent submits that the dispute need

not meet the triple identity test; it suffices that “the respective claims share the same
fundamental basis”, specifically that the dispute is based on the same facts and subject
matter**! and the relief sought is the same in both proceedings.**? For Guatemala, the
Claimant has already submitted the same dispute, arising from the same factual matrix,
to two other fora, i.e., to the Guatemalan courts and to ICSID. As a result, it is precluded
from resubmitting this dispute before this UNCITRAL Tribunal.

By contrast, the Claimant contends that the clause can only be triggered by treaty-based
disputes, because the “dispute” must be “regarding matters regulated by this Agreement”,
as required by Article 11(1).*** It thus argues that neither the domestic proceedings
initiated by EEGSA nor Jberdrola I triggered the application of the clause. The Claimant
further contends that, for the fork in the road to be triggered, the dispute must meet the
triple identity test. According to the Claimant, there was no identity of parties or cause of
action between Iberdrola I and the domestic proceedings.

. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that the term “dispute” in Article 11(2) must be

read in conjunction with the definition given in Article 11(1). Thus, Article 11(2) only
deals with disputes regarding matters governed by the Treaty (“respecto a cuestiones
reguladas por el presente Acuerdo”), and only these disputes trigger the fork-in-the-road
clause. Consequently, the fork-in-the-road provision has not been triggered by EEGSA’s

domestic litigations. Those litigations did not involve claims under the Treaty, they dealt
with issues of national law.

Whether the clause was triggered by the Jberdrola I arbitration is a different question.
The Claimant denies it because the /berdrola I tribunal decided that the dispute did not
relate to matters governed by the Treaty and thus did not fall under the scope of Article
11, which necessarily means that it cannot trigger the fork in the road in Article 11(2).
The Claimant further contends that the dispute must meet the triple identity test. For the
same reason, the Claimant submits that there is no identity of causes of action between
the present claims and those brought in Jberdrola I. As noted above, the Respondent
argues that it is sufficient for both disputes to share the same fundamental basis, which is
the case here.

. The Tribunal can dispense with deciding which test should apply to the identity of dispute

in the context of the fork in the road. Indeed, it has already affirmed that the more stringent
test, the triple identity test, was fulfilled. Indeed:

i. It is undisputed that there is identity of parties;

ii. There is also identity of petitum: in both proceedings, the Claimant has requested a
declaration that Article 3 of the Treaty had been breached, together with
compensation;“**

iii. There is finally identity of cause of action. It is evident from the Claimant’s
pleadings in [berdrola I that the Claimant invoked breaches of the Treaty before
that tribunal. In reality, the Claimant concedes this point when it states that “[e]ven
though in 2008 Iberdrola presented its claims in good faith as treaty claims, the
tribunal in /berdrola I ultimately considered they were not.”**>

. The fact is that the Claimant has already submitted a treaty-based dispute to an ICSID

tribunal (option Art. 11(2)(c) under the Treaty) and is now attempting to resubmit the
same treaty dispute to this UNCITRAL Tribunal (option Art. 11(2)(b) under the Treaty).
In other words, the Claimant has already made one forum choice for this dispute and now
seeks to make another choice for the same dispute. This course of action contradicts the
purpose of Article 11(2), which the Claimant expressly acknowledges is “to avoid parallel
litigation on the same investment dispute and, thus, contradictory decisions”.**° The fact
that the Jberdrola J tribunal found that the claims were domestic law claims and not treaty
claims does not change the fact that the Claimant invoked the Treaty as the basis for its
claims. Nor does it alter the analysis conducted above, where the Tribunal concluded that
the two arbitrations involve the same dispute.

For these reasons, the Tribunal finds that the fork in the road contained at Article 11(2)
was triggered by the submission of Jberdrola I to ICSID arbitration. The Claimant already
chose one forum to submit the treaty dispute now before this Tribunal. Consequently,
under the terms of Article 11(2), it is prevented from now resorting to this UNCITRAL
Tribunal.

(iv) Article 26 of the ICSID Convention

Having reviewed the Parties’ submissions on Article 26 of the ICSID Convention, the
Tribunal does not find that it assists it in determining the Respondent’s fork-in-the-road
objection, or its jurisdiction in general. That said, the Tribunal will address the Parties’
arguments for the sake of completeness.

The Respondent contends that, even if Article 11(2) of the Treaty were not a fork-in-the-
road provision, Article 26 of the ICSID Convention would preclude the Claimant from
bringing this UNCITRAL arbitration. The Tribunal understands the Respondent’s
argument essentially to be that Article 26 sets out an exclusive forum for the resolution
of investment disputes, such that if an investor chooses to arbitrate its dispute under the
ICSID Convention, it waives its right to seek another remedy before another forum, and
the Claimant waived its right to submit its dispute before this UNCITRAL tribunal
because it consented to ICSID arbitration in Iberdrola 1.487

Article 26 reads as follows:

Consent of the parties to arbitration under this Convention shall, unless
otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the exclusion of any
other remedy. A Contracting State may require the exhaustion of local
administrative or judicial remedies as a conditions of its consent to arbitration
under this Convention. (Emphasis added)

Pursuant to its own terms, Article 26 applies when the parties have consented to ICSID
arbitration. Unless stated otherwise, such consent is exclusive of any other remedy,
including domestic litigation and non-ICSID arbitration. As Schreuer explains, this means
that “once consent to ICSID arbitration has been given, the parties have lost their right to
seek relief in another forum, national or international, and are restricted to pursuing their
claim through ICSID.”"*88

Importantly, the effect of Article 26 only “operates from the moment of valid consent.”4*°
In the context of a treaty arbitration, this requires an offer of arbitration from the
respondent State contained in the relevant treaty, and an acceptance from the claimant
investor, usually given when filing for arbitration with ICSID. That said, as Schreuer
comments, consent will only be deemed valid if the Secretary-General does not refuse to

register the request for arbitration because it is manifestly outside the Centre’s jurisdiction
or if the arbitral tribunal does not render a decision of lack of jurisdiction:

Art. 26 applies from the moment of consent [...]. If ICSID arbitration has been
instituted, there will be a finding by the Secretary-General in accordance with
his or her screening power under Art. 36(3) or a decision on jurisdiction by
the tribunal under Art. 41. If the Secretary-General has found that, because of
a lack of consent, the dispute is manifestly outside the jurisdiction of the
Centre or if the tribunal has determined that the Centre does not have
jurisdiction because there is no valid consent, Art. 26 does not apply and other
remedies may be pursued. “°

In this case, the Iberdrola I tribunal declined its jurisdiction (and the ad hoc annulment
committee refused to annul that award). By declining jurisdiction, the Jberdrola I tribunal
found that there was no valid consent to ICSID arbitration, because the Claimant’s
acceptance did not match the Respondent’s offer to arbitrate. As a result, Article 26
cannot preclude the Claimant from seeking other remedies. Whether or not the investor
can bring its claim to another forum will depend on the terms of the relevant treaty (for
instance, whether it provides for a fork in the road), or on whether a new claim is barred
by res judicata. The Tribunal thus agrees with the Claimant that “Article 26 does not
resolve the parties’ dispute in the present case”; “[rJather[,] the case must be analysed
through the prism of the correct principles of res judicata”,*?' which the Tribunal has
done above.

e. Objection based on Article 53 of the ICSID Convention

. Inthe alternative, the Respondent contends that, by bringing this arbitration, the Claimant

has breached Article 53 of the ICSID Convention, with the result that this Tribunal has
no jurisdiction to hear the Claimant’s claims. As the Tribunal has already decided that it
lacks jurisdiction, it will only briefly address this objection, in particular because it is
closely linked to res judicata.

. The Respondent argues that, as a result of Article 53, “the forms of recourse established

in the ICSID Convention are exclusive of each other [and] do not include the possibility
of appealing the factual or legal findings of an ICSID tribunal”.**? For the Respondent,
the Claimant has exhausted the available remedies against the Jberdrola I award by
seeking the annulment of this award before the ad hoc committee.’ By initiating this
arbitration and requesting this Tribunal to reopen the jurisdictional findings of the

Iberdrola I tribunal, says Guatemala, the Claimant has breached Article 53 of the ICSID
Convention, with the result that this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction.4%*

The Claimant denies that Article 53 applies in the case at hand. Relying on Schreuer’s
commentary to Article 53 of the ICSID Convention,**> the Claimant submits that “[iJn
the absence of a decision on the merits from the Jberdrola I tribunal, Article 53 cannot be
used by Guatemala to prevent Iberdrola’s treaty claims being heard by this tribunal”.*%°

. Article 53 of the ICSID Convention reads in pertinent part as follows:

(1) The award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any
appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention.
Each party shall abide by and comply with the terms of the award except to
the extent that enforcement shall have been stayed pursuant to the relevant
provisions of this Convention.

. The first part of Article 53(1) states that an ICSID award is final and binding. As was

stressed earlier, this statement is the basis for the binding force of ICSID awards and,
hence, for its res judicata authority.*°” Accordingly, to the extent that the Respondent’s
objection relies on the binding nature of ICSID awards, it calls for the same conclusion
as that reached with regard to the res judicata objection.

The Respondent appears, however, to rely on the second part of the first sentence of
Article 53(1), pursuant to which ICSID awards “shall not be subject to any appeal or to
any other remedy except those provided for in [the ICSID] Convention.” The
Respondent’s submission seems to be that the Iberdrola I Award was already subject to
the remedy allowed by the ICSID Convention, namely, annulment under Article 52, and
that by requesting this Tribunal to revisit the Jberdrola J tribunal’s jurisdictional decision,
the Claimant is impermissibly attempting to bring a new recourse against the [berdrola I
Award. Relying on RSM, the Respondent submits that this would breach Article 53 of the
ICSID Convention.

To the extent that this is the Respondent’s argument, the Tribunal cannot agree. This
arbitration is not an appeal or recourse against the Jberdrola I Award. It is a separate
proceeding over which the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction, because it raises claims identical
to those presented in the Jberdrola I arbitration.

3. Conclusion on jurisdiction and admissibility

In conclusion, the Tribunal holds that it lacks jurisdiction over the present dispute because
the submission of the dispute in this arbitration is irreconcilable with the principle of res
judicata and, alternatively, because it breaches the fork-in-the-road provision embodied
in the Treaty. While out of an abundance of caution the Tribunal has addressed the further
objections related to breaches of Articles 26 and 53 of the ICSID Convention because of
their links with the two prior objections, it considers that, in light of the outcome reached,
it can dispense with resolving the other defenses raised, i.e. the doctrine of concentration
of claims and arguments, the rule prohibiting an abuse of right, and the defense that
Tberdrola cannot reformulate its claims under the Treaty in this arbitration.4%*

COUNTERCLAIM
A. The Respondent’s position

The counterclaim is linked to the Respondent’s fork-in-the-road objection. The
Respondent argues that, by abusively initiating multiple proceedings against it, the
Claimant has violated the Treaty’s fork-in-the-road clause provided at Article 11(2). In
reliance on Articles 19(3) and (4) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules, the Respondent thus
brings a counterclaim seeking a declaration of breach and compensation for the injury
which is suffered as a result of such breach.

. The Respondent submits that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the counterclaim, which

is admissible (1) and well-founded (2). As a preliminary matter, the Respondent denies

that by submitting the counterclaim it has accepted the Tribunal’s jurisdiction or waived

any of its objections to admissibility,*”° a matter that was resolved earlier.°°

1. The Tribunal has jurisdiction over the counterclaim and the counterclaim is
admissible

. The Respondent submits that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide the counterclaim for

the following reasons.*!

. First, the Respondent submits that the Parties have consented to arbitrate this

counterclaim and that the UNCITRAL Rules allow counterclaims. More specifically, the
Respondent argues that, through Article 11 of the Treaty and the Claimant’s Notice of
Arbitration, the Parties have consented to have this Tribunal decide on “all disputes [...]

See §§ 92-93 above.

Transcript, 118:10-14 (“{TJhe fact that we made a counterclaim doesn’t mean that we recognize the
jurisdiction of this Tribunal to adjudicate this case again or not to accept any admissibility objection we
have made in this case.”).

concerning matters governed by this Agreement.” Relying on Urbaser (which interpreted
a similar provision in the Spain-Argentina BIT), the Respondent contends that Article 11
is neutral as to the identity of the parties, and there is nothing in the Treaty that prevents
the State party from submitting a dispute. Accordingly, there is no reason why the party
acting first should prevent the other from raising a counterclaim.*°

In response to the Claimant’s arguments, the Respondent clarifies that it “does not dispute
the fact that the Treaty only allows an investor to initiate an arbitral proceeding against
the State”, and admits that “[a]ny other reading would contradict the language, object and
purpose of the Treaty.”°°> However, “there is nothing in the Treaty that prevents the State,
once a claim has been filed against it, from filing claims ‘regarding matters governed by
this Agreement’” *” This is precisely what has happened here: the Claimant filed a claim
against the Respondent. By doing so, argues Guatemala, the Claimant breached the fork
in the road in Article 11(2) of the Treaty, which is a “matter governed by this Agreement”
as required by the first paragraph of the same provision. As a result, the Respondent
acquired the right to file a counterclaim with regard to the Claimant’s breach of Article
11(2) of the Treaty >

. Contrary to the Claimant’s contention, there is nothing in the Treaty limiting these

“matters” to violations of substantive standards of the Treaty by the host State.*°” Relying
on Paushok and Saluka, the Respondent contends that “the language of the treaty, read in
conjunction with the UNCITRAL Rules, is sufficiently broad to include counterclaims
by the State given that the word ‘disputes’ also encompasses counterclaims.”>°*

. Second, the counterclaim is “intimately linked to the claim submitted by Iberdrola.”°°?

The Respondent accepts that “a legitimate counterclaim must have a close connection
with the primary claim to which it is a response.”>!° Here, the counterclaim and the main
claim are closely connected, as both Parties cite Article 11 of the Treaty. While the

Claimant alleges that it has complied with paragraphs 1 and 2 of this provision, the
Respondent requests a declaration that it has not, together with an order to pay damages.

Third, the Respondent notes that Article 19 of the UNCITRAL Rules expressly provides
for counterclaims.>!!

Fourth, citing David Aven v. Costa Rica and the Claimant’s expert Prof. Reisman, the
Respondent argues that “once an arbitral proceeding is initiated against the State, the
admission of related counterclaims is the proper and efficient decision.”*!?

. Fifth, relying on Urbaser, the Respondent submits that, once the requirements of consent

and connection have been met, there is no need to meet other admissibility requirements
(such as notice or cooling off periods). Indeed, demanding that the requirements of notice
and cooling off periods be met at this stage would be inefficient. >">

2. The counterclaim has merit

As to the merits of the counterclaim, the Respondent argues that it suffered harm caused
by the Claimant’s conduct. The Respondent seeks full reparation of the damages caused.
by the Claimant’s violation of the Treaty’s fork-in-the-road provision, and moral
damages.

. With respect to its first head of damages, Guatemala submits that, by abusively submitting

the same dispute to three of the fora identified in Article 11(2) (and in particular, by
resubmitting its claims before this Tribunal after an ICSID arbitration), the Claimant has
breached the Treaty’s fork-in-the-road provision. As a consequence of the principle of
full reparation, the Respondent must be placed in the position in which it would have been
had the Claimant not violated that provision. Specifically, had the Claimant not
resubmitted its claims, the Respondent would not be incurring significant legal fees.>'*
Therefore, the Respondent requests that Iberdrola be ordered to pay all of the amounts
incurred for the costs and legal expenses of this arbitration.

Mem., § 354, citing Articles 19(3) and 19(4) of the UNCITRAL Rules 1976, which provide:

“3. In his statement of defence, or at a later stage in the arbitral proceedings if the arbitral tribunal decides
that the delay was justified under the circumstances, the respondent may make a counter-claim arising out
of the same contract or rely on a claim arising out of the same contract for the purpose of a set-off.

4. The provisions of article 18, paragraph 2, shall apply to a counter-claim and a claim relied on for the

The Respondent also asserts that the counterclaim must be distinguished from its request
for an order of costs. The legal basis of the counterclaim is not Articles 38 and 40 of the
UNCITRAL Rules. As a result, the counterclaim cannot be examined with the discretion
that Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules confers upon tribunals deciding on costs.

Guatemala further alleges that, by initiating dispute settlement proceedings over the same
dispute for the fourth time over a period of ten years, the Claimant has inflicted a moral
damage to the State, which must be compensated with an amount no less than
US$2 million.>!

Contrary to the Claimant’s contentions, the Respondent maintains that it has clearly
identified the damages it has suffered, being its legal costs in the current proceedings and
moral damages (which are difficult to quantify, but no less real).>!

. Finally, the Respondent contends that any award on the counterclaim must bear pre-award

interest running from the termination of the annulment proceedings as well as post-award
interest at a reasonable rate.

. Inthe alternative, the Respondent requests a full award on costs. This request is dealt with

in Section VII below.
B. The Claimant’s position

The Claimant submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the counterclaim (1). In
addition, according to Iberdrola, the Respondent has not raised an actual counterclaim (2)
and, in any event, the purported counterclaim lacks merit (3). Finally, the Claimant also
argued that Guatemala had submitted to this Tribunal’s jurisdiction by raising a
counterclaim, an argument dealt with earlier.>!”

1. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the Respondent’s counterclaim

The Claimant submits that the Respondent has the burden of showing that its
counterclaim is within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction and that it is admissible in an
international investment arbitration, and that it has failed to do so.>!*

First, the Claimant submits that the BIT does not allow States to submit claims against
investors,°!? and thus the counterclaim falls outside of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione
materiae.>» Contrary to the Respondent’s arguments, Article 11 of the BIT is not similar
to Article 10 of the Argentina-Spain BIT, on which the Urbaser tribunal ruled. The

Claimant highlights that the Argentina-Spain BIT provides that the notice of a dispute
can be submitted before domestic courts “upon one of the parties’ request”. Similarly,
either party may choose the relevant fora. By contrast, the Guatemala-Spain BIT
stipulates that a dispute must be notified “by the investor to the Contracting Party”. This
expression allows no other interpretation but that only investors are allowed to submit
claims under that BIT. Similarly, under paragraph 2 it is for the investor to choose the
relevant forum. Given this language, Article 11 cannot be construed as allowing State
parties to submit claims against foreign investors.

. The Claimant alleges that the Guatemala-Spain BIT bears a greater resemblance to the

Pakistan-Turkey BIT, which was held not to allow counterclaims by the Karkey tribunal,
or to the Greece-Romania BIT, with respect to which the Spyridon Roussalis tribunal
reached a similar conclusion.>”!

Second and in the alternative, the Claimant observes that the counterclaim is “totally
unconnected to the main claim’”.*”? International investment tribunals have interpreted
Article 19(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules as allowing the submission of counterclaims by
States as long as they are allowed to do so by the applicable BIT. However, as noted by
the Saluka tribunal, “they must also satisfy those conditions which customarily govern
the relationship between a counterclaim and the primary claim to which it is a response".
Accordingly, still in the words of the Saluka tribunal, “a legitimate counterclaim must
have a close connection with the primary claim to which it is a response”.°”

According to the Claimant, the close connection requirement implies that “[a]
substantive, genuine link must exist between the main claims and the counterclaim.”***
Here, the Respondent has failed to show this link. Article 11(2) of the Treaty only
provides rights for the benefit of investors (i.e., the freedom to select the forum to settle
an investor-State dispute), but does not establish a substantive obligation. The
Respondent’s counterclaim is not linked to the claims (which relate to breaches of the
Treaty by the State’s sovereign actions during a tariff setting process) in any way. The
Respondent’s purported counterclaim is a generic claim that could be filed against any
claimant who presents a claim under an international investment agreement that the
Respondent deems to be abusive. As a result, it does not meet the condition set in Article
19(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules.°>

2. The Respondent has failed to submit a proper counterclaim

In the alternative, should the Tribunal consider that the Respondent may submit a
counterclaim under the BIT, it is the Claimant’s argument that the Respondent is not a
valid counterclaim for the following reasons.

. First, the Respondent has not followed the notification procedure (notification in writing)

and cooling-off period (six months from the date of the written notice) established in
Article 11 of the BIT.

Second, the Respondent has not raised issues regulated under the BIT, as required by
Article 11. More specifically, it points to no BIT obligation that the Claimant supposedly
breached. According to Iberdrola, “for an international wrongful act to occur, an
international obligation must exist in the first place.” °°” Article 11(2) of the BIT, which
is the basis of the counterclaim creates no substantive obligation; it merely provides a
series of dispute settlement mechanisms from which the investor may choose when
presenting its claims under the Treaty. Interpreting such options as “obligations” goes
against the rules of treaty interpretation of the VCLT. As a result, the Claimant has
breached no BIT obligation that could give rise to liability. >7*

. Third, the Claimant argues that the Respondent has failed to substantiate and quantify its

counterclaim. Relying on Amto, the Claimant submits that claims for costs do not require
a counterclaim: as the issue of costs is necessarily settled in the main proceedings,
ancillary proceedings are not required.*” As to the moral damages claim, the Respondent
gives no explanation on its legal basis on the facts give rise to such an entitlement, and
on how the initiation of these proceedings has resulted in any harm to Guatemala.>*°

3. In the alternative, the counterclaim lacks merit

Finally, the Claimant observes that Guatemala grounds its counterclaim on the “abusive
conduct of the Claimant in filing multiple procedures against it”.**! However, the
Claimant has demonstrated that there has been no such abuse of process.

Consequently, should the Tribunal consider that Guatemala submitted a true counterclaim
over which there is jurisdiction, the Claimant submits that the Tribunal must dismiss the

As to the purported violation of the fork-in-the-road clause, the Claimant contends that it

C. Analysis

To recall, the Treaty dispute resolution clause embodied in Article 11 reads in pertinent
part as follows:

In addition, Article 19(3) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules contains the following rules on
counterclaims:

It does not appear seriously disputed — and rightly so — that an investment tribunal has
jurisdiction over a counterclaim if two requirements are satisfied, i.e. the disputing parties
have given their consent to arbitrate counterclaims and there is a close connection
between the claims and the counterclaim.** In addition, the question arises whether a
tribunal may rule on a counterclaim when it does not entertain the claim because the latter
is outside its jurisdiction or inadmissible.

The first of these requirements relates to consent to arbitration as it is circumscribed in
the host State’s offer found in Article 11 of the BIT>*> and the investor’s acceptance
included in its Notice of Arbitration.

According to Article 11(1) and (2), what can be submitted to arbitration is a dispute
relating to an investment between an investor of one Contracting State and the other
Contracting State concerning matters governed by the Treaty and such dispute can only
be brought to arbitration by the investor. It is thus clear from the wording of the dispute
settlement clause, which constitutes the offer to arbitrate, that the Contracting Parties only
envisaged claims initiated by the investor. This language also circumscribes the investor’s
acceptance of the offer and, hence, the consent to arbitrate (in the meaning of a meeting
of the minds). The limitation is understandable as the Treaty provides for rights in favor
of the investor, not for obligations (this being said without considering here the
Respondent’s theory that the fork in the road creates an obligation of the investor). The
Tribunal can discern no other elements in the Treaty that, applying the rules of
interpretation of the VCLT, could be deemed to indicate consent to the submission of
counterclaims. As a result, it cannot hold that Iberdrola submitted to this Tribunal’s
jurisdiction over counterclaims when it filed this arbitration.

The Respondent accepts that only the investor can start an arbitration, but submits that it
is entitled to react by raising a counterclaim.**° Nothing in the Treaty, so it says, bars it
from doing so. In support, it relies on several decisions and on Article 19(3) of the
UNCITRAL Rules.*”

See for instance Urbaser S.A. v. Argentine Republic, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/26, Award of 8 December
2016, § 1118 (Exh. RLA-088); Saluka v. Czech Republic, Arbitration under UNCITRAL Rules (PCA),

Metal-Tech v. Uzbekistan, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/3, Award of 4 October 2013, § 407 (Exh, RLA-168).

For the proposition that consent to the submission of counterclaims must be found in the treaty’s dispute
settlement clause, see for instance Spyridon Roussalis v. Romania, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/1, Award
of 7 December 2011, § 866 (Exh. CLA-090); Saluka v. Czech Republic, Arbitration under UNCITRAL

Article 19(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules, which is quoted in full above, states that the
respondent may make a counterclaim “arising out of the same contract” in the statement
of defence or at a later stage in the arbitration if authorized. It fulfils the same function as
Article 46 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 40, which provide that
the tribunal shall determine counterclaims “arising directly out of the subject matter of
the disputes” provided they are “within the scope of the consent of the parties” and the
jurisdiction of the Centre. Bearing these provisions in mind, the issue is whether, as a
result of the reference to specific arbitration rules in the BIT, Article 19(3) of the
UNCITRAL Rules (or for this matter Article 46 of the ICSID Convention) are
incorporated into the arbitration agreement in such a manner that consent to the
submission of counterclaims is achieved.

Faced with this question, the tribunal in Goetz v. Burundi II, citing Prof. Reisman’s
dissent to the award in Roussalis v. Romania, expressed the opinion that “when the States
Parties to a BIT contingently consent, inter alia, to ICSID jurisdiction, the consent
component of Article 46 of the Washington Convention is ipso facto imported into any
ICSID arbitration which an investor then elects to pursue” .*** The Tribunal has difficulty
following this line of reasoning in a situation such as the present one and the one in
Roussalis, where the wording of the Treaty provision indicates, to the contrary, that only
the investor can claim.**? While the Tribunal agrees that arbitration rules referred to in a
treaty are incorporated by reference, this is only to the extent that they are not
contradicting the treaty. This was the case Aven v. Costa Rica, another decision on which

Antoine Goetz & Others and S.A. Affinage des Metaux v. Republic of Burundi, CSID Case No. ARB/O1/2.
Award of 21 June 2012, § 279, citing Spyridon Roussalis v. Romania, ICSID Case No. ARB/O06/1,
Declaration of W. Michael Reisman dated 28 December 2011 (Exh. RLA-167).

In Roussalis, the limitation arose from the description of the disputes submitted to arbitration:
In this respect, Article 9 of the BIT provides in its relevant parts that:

“Disputes between an investor of a Contracting Party and the other Contracting
Party concerning an obligation of the latter under this Agreement, in relation to an
investment of the former, shall, if possible, be settled by the disputing parties in
an amicable way [...]

If such disputes cannot be settled within six months from the date either party
requested amicable settlement, the investor concerned may submit the dispute
either to the competent courts of the Contracting Party in the territory of which the
investment has been made or to international arbitration”(emphasis added).

Pursuant to the interpretation rules of Article 31 of the Vienna Convention and the
above quoted ICSID decision, the Tribunal in its majority considers that the references
made in the text of Article 9(1) of the BIT to “disputes ... concerning an obligation of
the latter” undoubtedly limit jurisdiction to claims brought by investors about
obligations of the host State. Accordingly, the BIT does not provide for counterclaims
to be introduced by the host state in relation to obligations of the investor. The
meaning of the “dispute” is the issue of compliance by the State with the BIT.

the Respondent relies. There, the treaty arbitration clause was neutral as to the party
entitled to bring proceedings and allowed for claims for breach of investment agreements
in addition to breaches of investment protections under the treaty.“ However, if there is
a contradiction between the arbitration rules and the treaty language (as is the case here),
the treaty prevails.

This being so, the majority of decisions give prevalence to the treaty language over the
arbitration rules when it comes to establishing consent to arbitrate counterclaims.**! The
award in Karkey v. Pakistan is instructive. The relevant treaty in that case contained a
dispute resolution clause similar to the present one in the sense that it was broad in the
definition of disputes, but expressly limited access to arbitration to the investor. The
Karkey tribunal held the following views:

References to the “investor” highlighted above in the dispute resolution clause
of the BIT means that the BIT is intended to enable arbitration only at the
initiative of the investor. The BIT imposes no obligation on investors, only on
the Contracting State.

The BIT contains no particular or general language that would enable the
Tribunal to conclude, if interpreted in accordance with the Vienna Convention
on the Law of Treaties, that the arbitral agreement between Pakistan and
Karkey includes consent by Karkey to the submission of counterclaims by
Pakistan.*?

On this basis, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the Treaty wording showing that
only the investor is entitled to file claims must prevail over any contrary meaning that the
arbitration rules to which the Treaty refers may suggest. As a result, the Tribunal lacks
jurisdiction over the counterclaim and can dispense with analyzing the requirement of
close connection. It can also dispense with reviewing whether a counterclaim may stand

possibly also when it is silent on their admissibility. In such cases, tribunals tend to accept that the
respondent state has standing to bring a claim or a counterclaim before an investment arbitral tribunal. This
is for instance the case in Saluka v. Czech Republic, Arbitration under UNCITRAL Rules (PCA), Decision

when the claim is rejected for lack of jurisdiction (on the basis of the fork in the road) or
for lack of admissibility (on the ground of res judicata). Finally, it need not determine the
merits of the counterclaim, namely whether the existence of a fork in the road gives rise
to a compensable claim in case of breach.

Finally, while the Tribunal appreciates that counterclaims are a useful procedural tool to
promote the concentration of claims and thus enhance the efficiency of the dispute
settlement system, it notes that its role is limited to applying the treaty on the basis of
which it is seized in accordance with its terms. It cannot go beyond or else it would engage
in policy choices which are the domain of the States.

. Costs

Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules

Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules deals with the costs of the arbitration and provides
as follows:

The arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in its award. The term
“costs” includes only:

(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator
and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 39;

(b) The travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;

(c) The costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral
tribunal;

(d) The travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses are
approved by the arbitral tribunal;

(e) The costs for legal representation and assistance of the successful party if
such costs were claimed during the arbitral proceedings, and only to the extent
that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is
reasonable;

(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the expenses
of the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague.

Thus, Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules recognizes broadly three categories of costs
and expenses: (i) tribunal costs, comprising of the fees and expenses of the Arbitral
Tribunal and Secretary; (ii) costs for legal representation and assistance, comprising of
the legal fees and witness related costs incurred by the Parties; and (iii) administrative
costs, comprising here of the fees and expenses of the PCA, including hearing and other
expenses.

Cost advances

. In accordance with Article 41 of the UNCITRAL Rules and Section 14 of the Terms of

Appointment, each Party has made advances in the amount of EUR 225,000 to cover the
fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the cost of registry services.

. Accordingly, the total advance paid by the Parties amounts to EUR 450,000.

Tribunal and administrative costs

. The members of the Tribunal have collectively spent a total of 534.6 hours as follows:

Prof. Pierre-Marie Dupuy, 79 hours; J. Christopher Thomas QC, 127.6 hours; and
Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler, 328 hours. In the Terms of Appointment, it was agreed that the
Tribunal’s time would be compensated at an hourly rate of EUR 550 exclusive of VAT,
where applicable.

In the same period of time, the Secretary of the Tribunal has spent a total of 266 hours.
In the Terms of Appointment, it was agreed that the Secretary would be compensated at
an hourly rate of EUR 280 exclusive of VAT, where applicable.

The Tribunal and the Secretary have incurred expenses in the amount of EUR 13,255.24.

. The PCA has charged fees in the amount of EUR 30,270 for the administration of the

case and its registry services.

Other costs, such as hearings expenses, including IT costs, catering, court reporting and
interpretation services, as well as the translation of procedural documents and the Award,
amount to EUR 34,610.65.

Thus, the total costs of the proceedings amount to EUR 446,645.89. As a result, the
unexpended balance of the deposit amounts to EUR 3,354.11. In accordance with section
14.4 of the Terms of Appointment, the Tribunal directs that this amount be returned to
the Parties in equal shares (i.e. EUR 1,677.05 each).

In accordance with Article 41(5) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the PCA shall render an
accounting to the Parties of the deposits received after the issuance of this Award.

The Parties’ statements of costs diverge remarkably. Both the legal fees and
the costs relating to the Hearing incurred by Claimant are a fraction of those
incurred by Respondent.

Claimant has conducted this arbitration with prudence and austerity, which is
reflected in its statement of costs. For instance, the costs of Claimant’s in-
house representation have not been included in the submission. Should the
Tribunal decide that Claimant’s treaty claims should be heard, Claimant will
maintain the same approach on costs until the issuance of the award. *“

Thus, the Respondent’s costs for legal representation and assistance, excluding the
advances paid to the PCA to cover the costs of the proceedings, amount to
USD 1,202,241.93.

Allocation of costs
Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides in relevant part:

1. Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in
principle be borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral
tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it
determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the
circumstances of the case.

2. With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to
in article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the
circumstances of the case, shall be free to determine which party shall bear
such costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if it determines
that apportionment is reasonable.

Both Parties have requested that the other Party be ordered to bear all costs incurred in
connection with the proceedings, plus interest.*4”

Subject to the costs of legal representation of the successful party which are dealt with in
Article 40(2), the principle enshrined in Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules is that
costs should follow the event. Hence, since jurisdiction has been denied, the Claimant
should bear the arbitration costs other than the Respondent’s legal fees. The Tribunal sees
no reason to proceed to a different cost allocation under the circumstances.

As for the legal fees of the Party which prevailed, the Tribunal is free under Article 40(2)
to apportion them as it considers appropriate. The central question before this Tribunal
was whether the finding of the Jberdrola I tribunal according to which Iberdrola’s claims
were outside the subject matter scope of its jurisdiction was binding on this Tribunal. As
may be gathered from the analysis above, this is a question raising genuine and complex
issues of res judicata. It can thus hardly be said that the Claimant’s choice to raise this
issue in front of this Tribunal was illegitimate, frivolous or abusive. The Tribunal recalls,

Claimant’s letter to the Tribunal of 16 July 2019.
Notice of Arbitration, § 174 (iv); CM., § 315 (iv); Rejoinder, § 271 (vi); Mem., § 368 (f); Reply, § 279 (f).

nonetheless, that it has also held that the claims were precluded by virtue of the fork-in-
the-road provision at Article 11(2) of the Treaty, meaning that the Claimant would not
have succeeded on its claims even if it had prevailed on res judicata.

Having considered all the relevant circumstances, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion
that the Claimant shall bear the entirety of the costs of the proceedings, as fixed in Section
VII.C above (i.e. EUR 446,645.89); and shall reimburse EUR 223,322.95 to the
Respondent for the costs met from the Respondent’s share of the deposit. The Claimant
shall also bear one third of the Respondent’s costs for legal representation and assistance
and shall thus pay USD 400,747 to the Respondent.

The Respondent has also requested interest on costs, but has failed to provide a legal basis

for such request or indicate an appropriate rate, and thus the Tribunal must dismiss this
request.
