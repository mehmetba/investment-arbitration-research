Agreement”).

Pursuant to Article VI(3)(a)(iii) of the Treaty (cited above), the Arbitration Agreement

C: The Arbitral Tribunal

Pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement, the Tribunal is comprised of three arbitrators

appointed thereunder as follows:

* Dr Grigera Naon: In their Notice of Arbitration dated 23 September 2009, the
Claimants notified the Respondent of their appointment as co-arbitrator of Dr Horacio
A. Grigera Naon, of 5224 Elliott Road, Bethesda, Maryland 20816, United States of

America.

* Professor Lowe: On 4 December 2009, the Respondent notified the Claimants of its
appointment as co-arbitrator of Professor Vaughan Lowe QC, of Essex Court Chambers,

24 Lincoln’s Inn Fields, London WC2A 3EG, United Kingdom.

* Mr Veeder: By email of 22 January 2010, the Claimants informed the Permanent Court
of Arbitration (“PCA”) that the two co-arbitrators were unable to agree on the
appointment of the presiding third arbitrator. Pursuant to the agreement between the
Parties concerning the selection of the presiding third arbitrator, the PCA was requested
to act as appointing authority and “if the party appointed arbitrators cannot agree on the
President by Jan. 22 [2010], then the PCA will appoint the President but only after the
PCA provides the parties an opportunity to comment on the candidate under
consideration by the PCA.” Accordingly, on 25 February 2010 and in accordance with
the Parties’ agreement, the Secretary-General of the PCA appointed as the presiding
arbitrator Mr V.V. Veeder, of Essex Court Chambers, 24 Lincoln’s Inn Fields, London
WC2A 3EG, United Kingdom.

(Professor Lowe and Mr Veeder are individual members of the English Bar. As such,
albeit from the same barristers’ chambers, they practise as arbitrators independently
from each other, as disclosed by Mr Veeder in his Declaration of Acceptance and

Statement of Impartiality and Independence dated 26 January 2010).

By further agreement of the Parties, the PCA’s International Bureau was appointed to
administer these arbitration proceedings, with Mr Martin Doe (of the PCA) acting as

Secretary to the Tribunal.

In its Procedural Order No. 32 dated 26 March 2015, by consent of the Parties and upon

D: The Arbitral Procedure

Earlier Orders, Decision and Awards in Tracks 1 and 1B: This Award follows three
Orders on Interim Measures, five Awards, a Decision, and more than 57 procedural
orders made in these arbitration proceedings. The operative parts of these Orders on
Interim Measures, Awards and Decision are cited below in Annex | to this Part I. The
Tribunal’s Procedural Orders relevant to Track II are listed below in Annex 2 to this

Part I.

This Award is made in Track II of this arbitration, following Track I and Track Ib. It
serves no purpose to revisit here the full procedural history of these arbitration
proceedings from February 2010. For simplicity’s sake, the Tribunal hereby
incorporates by reference Part I of its Third Interim Award on Jurisdiction, Part A of its
First Partial Award on Track I and Part B of its Decision on Track IB. It here includes
only a summary of the major procedural events following the Tribunal’s Decision on

Track IB dated 12 March 2015 (the “Decision on Track IB”).

Orders for Interim Measures, Awards and Decision: As already indicated, the operative
parts of the Tribunal’s three Orders for Interim Measures dated 14 May 2010, 6
December 2010 and 7 February 2011, its five Awards dated 25 January 2012, 16
February 2012, 27 February 2012, 7 February 2013, 17 September 2013 and its Decision
dated 12 March 2015 are cited below in Annex | to this Part 1.

Track IT Procedure: The Tribunal issued its Decision on Track IB on 12 March 2015.
The Tribunal there decided (by a majority), in the form of a decision under the
Arbitration Agreement: that (i) the Complaint dated 7 May 2003 of the Lago Agrio
Plaintiffs in the Lago Agrio Litigation, as an initial pleading, included individual claims
resting upon individual rights under Ecuadorian law, not falling within the scope of the
1995 Settlement Agreement as diffuse claims; (ii) the Complaint was not wholly barred
at its inception by res judicata under Ecuadorian law, by virtue of the 1995 Settlement
Agreement; and (iii) the Lago Agrio Complaint included individual claims materially

similar, in substance, to the individual claims made by the Aguinda Plaintiffs in the

Part I— Page 6

1.27

Aguinda Litigation in New York. The Tribunal expressly reserved its powers to address
and decide the remainder of the Parties’ claimed relief in Track IB by one or more

further orders, decisions or awards at a later stage of these arbitration proceedings.

On 12 March 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Orders No. 29 and 30. In Procedural
Order No. 29, the Tribunal ordered (by consent of the Parties) an amendment to the
Confidentiality Clause forming part of Procedural Order No. 26 so as to exclude from
confidentiality certain passages addressing the results of the joint inspection of Judge
Zambrano’s computer hard drives in the Parties’ respective memorials of 7 November
2014 and 14 January 2015. In Procedural Order No. 30, the Tribunal designated four
sites for the purpose of its Site Visit in Ecuador and decided upon a number of

procedural matters related to the Site Visit.

On 26 March 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Orders No. 31 and 32. In Procedural
Order No. 31, the Tribunal ordered that the Parties’ outside counsel and their law firms
refrain from making any public statement that might aggravate the Parties’ dispute. In
Procedural Order No. 32, as already indicated above, the Tribunal appointed Ms Jessica

Wells as an additional Secretary to the Tribunal in these arbitration proceedings.

On 27 March 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 33. The Tribunal there
indicated its wish to request Dr Zambrano to attend the Track II Hearing as a factual
witness. It circulated a draft letter to Dr Zambrano for the Parties’ comments. The

Tribunal’s letter to Dr Zambrano was sent to him on | April 2015.

Earlier, on 12 May 2014, by Procedural Order No 26 and upon the terms there set out,
the Tribunal appointed Ms Kathryn Owen as the Tribunal’s forensic expert under the
Arbitration Agreement (namely, Article 27(1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules).
On 30 March 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 34 whereby it renewed

the appointment of Ms Kathryn Owen as an expert to the Tribunal.

On 7 April 2015, the Tribunal held a procedural meeting with the Parties (by telephone
conference-call) to prepare for the Track II Hearing and also to address the Parties’
several outstanding procedural applications. On 9 April 2015, the Tribunal issued
Procedural Order No. 35. It there decided certain procedural and logistical matters

relating to the Track II Hearing.

On 14 April 2015 and again on 16 April 2015, the Claimants requested “an immediate
order dissolving the confidentiality provisions of Procedural Orders No. 26 and 29 so
that Claimants would be free to disclose publicly the evidence found on [Judge
Zambrano’s Computers’ hard drives] and Mr Lynch’s expert analysis of that evidence”,
in response to the “[public] leaking [of] a copy of the November 7, 2014 report of
Ecuador’s forensics expert, J. Christopher Racich.” On 18 April 2015, the Tribunal
informed the Parties that it could not convene an urgent telephone conference in order
to decide the Claimants’ application, but requested that the Claimants notify the
Tribunal if any application was made to use Mr Racich’s expert report in the appellate
proceedings then pending before the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in the
RICO Litigation.

On 16 April 2015, the Claimants informed the Tribunal of the Parties’ agreement on all
aspects of the Site Visit Protocol, except for the presence of an audio/video team to be
brought by each Party. On 17 April 2015, the Respondent submitted its comments on
the presence of an audio/video team during the Site Visit. In the event, material parts of
the Tribunal’s Site Visit were filmed; and the sole copy of that confidential film was

lodged with the PCA for safe-keeping (where it remains as at the date of this Award).

Between 21 April 2015 and 8 May 2015, the Track II Hearing took place in Washington,
DC, USA (the “Track II Hearing”). It is described separately below.

At the Track II Hearing, on 5 May 2015, the Tribunal circulated its Draft Procedural
Order No. 36 together with the draft Site Visit Protocol. Procedural Order No. 36,
formalising the Site Visit Protocol, was issued on 7 May 2015, as executed by the
Parties, the Tribunal, and the Secretary-General of the PCA. Also during the Track II
Hearing, on 8 May 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 37. It there rescinded
the confidentiality clauses of Procedural Orders No. 26 and 29, save in respect of the
images of Judge Zambrano’s computer hard drives that were obtained by the Parties

pursuant to Procedural Order No. 26.

On 4 to 10 June 2015, the Tribunal’s Site Visit (accompanied by the Parties) took place
in the Sucumbios and Orellana Provinces of the Oriente in Ecuador. It is described

separately below.

On 18 June 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 38, an “Omnibus Order”.

The Tribunal there decided a number of procedural applications made by the Parties.

On 24 November 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 39. It there (i)
addressed an application for interim measures made by the Respondent regarding USTR
and US trade preference benefits; (ii) requested the Claimants to confirm the terms of
the relief sought for Track I; and, as already indicated above, (iii) extended the
appointment of Ms Kathryn Owen as an expert to the Tribunal in accordance with the
Revised Terms of Reference therein contained (subject to further comments from the
Parties). On 14 December 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 40. It there
confirmed the Revised Terms of Reference for the extension of the appointment of

Ms Owen as an expert to the Tribunal under the Arbitration Agreement.

On 5 February 2016, Ms Owen’s Final Report was sent to the Parties (“Ms Owen’s Final
Report”).

On 29 February 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 41. The Tribunal there
invited the Parties’ comments upon Ms Owen’s Final Report. In Procedural Order No.
42, issued on 16 March 2016, the Tribunal approved and agreed to send to Ms Owen
part of the documentation submitted by the Parties in response to Procedural Order No.

41.

Ms Owen’s Revised Final Report was sent to the Parties on 3 June 2016 (“Ms Owen’s
Revised Final Report”). In Procedural Order No. 43 dated 8 June 2016, the Tribunal
enquired whether the Parties requested that an oral hearing be held for the Parties to
question Ms Owen and make submissions on her report under the Arbitration
Agreement (namely, Article 27(4) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules). By letters
dated 10 June and 17 June 2016, the Claimants and the Respondent respectively stated
that they did not request any hearing on Ms Owen’s report under the Arbitration

Agreement.

On 18 June 2016, the Respondent requested that additional materials be admitted to the
evidential record under Section 4 of Procedural Order No. 41. The Claimants consented

to the Respondent’s request on 27 June 2016. These materials were duly admitted.

On 2 July 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 44. The Tribunal there
recorded the agreement reached by the Parties on a number of procedural issues (as
outlined in the Claimants’ letter of 27 June 2016). It also ordered that the Parties make
two rounds of simultaneous submissions on the significance of Ms Owen’s Revised
Final Report and Ms Owen’s responses to the Parties’ questions. The Parties did so on

12 August and 26 August 2016, respectively.

On 10 August 2016, the Claimants provided the Tribunal with a copy of the judgment
dated 9 August 2016 of the Second Circuit in the RICO Litigation (the “Judgment of
the Second Circuit”). On 16 August 2016, the Respondent submitted its comments on
the Judgment of the Second Circuit. On 18 August 2016, the Claimants submitted
further comments on the Judgment of the Second Circuit. On 29 August 2016, the
Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 45. The Tribunal there admitted the Judgment of
the Second Circuit into the evidential record. It also noted that there could be no issue
estoppel or res judicata applicable to the arbitration proceedings arising from the RICO
Litigation, inter alia, for want of sufficient privity under international law between the
Parties; and that the Parties had agreed that evidence adduced before the US Courts in
the RICO Litigation, as filed in this arbitration with the Tribunal’s approval, was to be

treated as evidence adduced in this arbitration.

At the same time, the Tribunal requested that the Parties submit a copy of an amicus
brief submitted by Ecuador to the Second Circuit in the RICO Litigation (the “RICO
Amicus Brief”). The Claimants provided this RICO Amicus Brief on 30 August 2016.

On 31 August 2016, the Respondent submitted certain comments in relation to the RICO
Amicus Brief and Procedural Order No. 45, noting “that the Tribunal has admitted
evidence from those [USA] proceedings as it was submitted by the parties in their
respective briefs and memorials”; and that certain FTP materials (exceeding 18.3 GB)
proffered by the Claimants on 23 December 2013 had not been admitted by the Tribunal

with its approval into the arbitration’s evidential record.

On 19 September 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 46, whereby (inter
alia) the Tribunal decided not to hold an oral hearing to question Ms Owen in

connection with her Revised Final Report under the Arbitration Agreement. It also

Part I - Page 10

1.44

1.45

1.46

confirmed the Respondent’s understanding regarding the Claimants’ FTP materials, as

expressed in the Respondent’s letter dated 31 August 2016.

On 26 June 2017, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that the US Supreme Court had
issued a decision in the RICO Litigation (the “Supreme Court’s Decision”). On 27 June
2017, the Tribunal requested a copy of the Supreme Court’s Decision, which the

Claimants provided on 29 June 2017.

On 12 July 2017, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal terminate the orders made
in its First, Second and Fourth Interim Awards. On 19 July 2017, the Claimants
requested that these orders remain in force. On 21 July 2017, the Tribunal requested that
the Parties respond to a series of queries by the Tribunal in connection with their
respective applications regarding these Awards. It also requested a copy of the judgment
of The Hague Court of Appeal of 18 July 2017, denying the Respondent’s appeal
seeking to set aside the Tribunal’s Awards (the “Judgment of The Hague Court of
Appeal”). On 25 July 2017, the Claimants provided a copy of the Judgment of The
Hague Court of Appeal. On 1 August 2017, the Parties provided their respective written
responses to the Tribunal’s queries of 21 July 2017. On 31 October 2017, the Tribunal
issued Procedural Order No. 47, whereby it dismissed the Respondent’s application of
12 July 2017 and confirmed that its First, Second and Fourth Interim Awards remained

in full force and effect.

On 5 February 2018, the Tribunal requested that the Parties provide it with certain
additional information regarding the status of the related legal proceedings and identify
which parts of their respective prayers for relief from the outset of the arbitration
remained extant for Track II and Track III. The Tribunal otherwise advised the Parties
that it was approaching the end of its deliberations and intended formally to “close the
hearings” under Article 29 of the UNCITRAL Rules as regards all issues to be addressed
in its award under Track II. On 19 March and 20 April 2018 the Parties provided their
respective comments to the Tribunal’s letter of 5 February 2018. On 23 April 2018, the
Claimants requested the Tribunal’s permission to respond to the Respondent’s letter of
20 April 2018, which the Tribunal denied on 25 April 2018. On 30 April 2018, the
Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 48, whereby it declared the record closed under
Article 29 of the UNCITRAL Rules as regards all issues to be addressed by the Tribunal

in its Track II award.

The Tribunal’s Expert: As already indicated above, by its Procedural Order No. 26 dated
12 May 2014 under the Arbitration Agreement made by consent of the Parties, the
Tribunal appointed Ms Owen as the Tribunal’s forensic expert for the purpose of
undertaking the imaging and safe-keeping of Judge Zambrano’s hard drives in Ecuador,

the following interim measures up to and including the date of issuance of the Tribunal’s
decision on jurisdiction:

(i) The Claimants and the Respondent are both ordered to maintain, as far as possible

Part I: Annex | — Page 24

C: Further Order on Interim Measures dated 28 January 2011, Operative Part, Paragraph
C (pp. 3-4)

“(C) Pending such oral hearing [i.e. the Hearing at the Peace Palace on 6 February 2011] or
further order (on application by any Party or by the Tribunal upon its own initiative), the
Tribunal takes the following interim measures pursuant to Article 26 of the UNCITRAL
Arbitration Rules:

1. The Tribunal re-confirms Paragraphs I(i) to (iv) of its Order dated 14 May 2010 (as
amended); namely:

(i) The Claimants and the Respondent are both ordered to maintain, as far as possible the
status quo and not to exacerbate the procedural and substantive disputes before this Tribunal,
including (in particular but without limiting howsoever the generality of the foregoing) the
avoidance of any public statement tending to compromise these arbitration proceedings;

(ii) The Claimants and the Respondent are both ordered to refrain from any conduct likely
to impair or otherwise adversely affect, directly or indirectly, the ability of the Tribunal to
address fairly any issue raised by the Parties before this Tribunal;

(iii) | The Claimants and the Respondent are both ordered not to exert, directly or indirectly,
any unlawful influence or pressure on the Court addressing the pending litigation in Ecuador
known as the Lago Agrio Case;

(iv) The Claimants and the Respondent are ordered to inform the Tribunal (in writing) of
the likely date for the issue by the Court of its judgment in the Lago Agrio Case as soon as such
date becomes known to any of them;

2. Whilst the Lago Agrio plaintiffs are not named parties to these arbitration proceedings and
the Respondent is not a named party to the Lago Agrio Case, the Tribunal records that, as a
matter of international law, a State may be responsible for the conduct of its organs, including
its judicial organs, as expressed in Chapter II of Part One of the International Law
Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility;

3. If it were established that any judgment made by an Ecuadorian court in the Lago Agrio
Case was a breach of an obligation by the Respondent owed to the Claimants as a matter of
international law, the Tribunal records that any loss arising from the enforcement of such
judgment (within and without Ecuador) may be losses for which the Respondent would be
responsible to the Claimants under international law, as expressed in Part Two of the
International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility; and

4. This order for further interim measures is made by the Tribunal strictly without prejudice to
any Party’s case as regards the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, the Claimants’ First and Second
Applications, the Respondent’s opposition to these First and Second Applications and any claim
or defence by any Party as to the merits of the Parties’ dispute.”

D: Order on Interim Measures dated 9 February 2011, Operative Part (pp. 3-4):

“(A) As to jurisdiction, the Tribunal records that it has not yet determined the Respondent’s
challenge to its jurisdiction (as recorded in the fourth preamble to its Order o 28 January
2011). Nonetheless, for the limited purpose of the present decision, the Tribunal provisionally
assumes that it has the jurisdiction to decide upon the Claimants’ Second Application for

Part I: Annex 1 — Page 25

Interim Measures on the ground that the Claimants have established, to the satisfaction of the
Tribunal, a sufficient case for the existence of such jurisdiction at this preliminary stage of
these arbitration proceedings under the Treaty between the United States of America and the
Republic of Ecuador concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment
(the “BIT” ), incorporating by reference the 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (“the
UNCITRAL Rules”);

(B) The Tribunal notes that: (1) Article 26 of the UNCITRAL Rules permits a tribunal, at the
request of a party, to take interim measures (established in the form of an order or award) in
respect of the subject-matter of the parties’ dispute; (ii) Article 32(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules
provides that any award is final and binding on the parties, with the parties undertaking to
carry out such award without delay; and (iv) Articles VI.3(6) of the BIT provides (inter alia)
than an award rendered pursuant to Article VI.3(a)(iii) of the BIT under the UNCITRAL Rules
shall be binding on the parties to the dispute, with the Contracting Parties undertaking to carry
out without delay the provisions of any such award and to provide in its territory for its
enforcement;

(C) As to form, the Tribunal records that, whilst this decision under Article 26 of the UNCITRAL
Rules is made in the form of an order and not an interim award, given the urgency required for
such decision, the Tribunal may decide (upon its own initiative or any Party’s request) to
confirm such order at a later date in the form of an interim award under Articles 26 and 32 of
the UNCITRAL Rules, without the Tribunal hereby intending conclusively to determine the
status of this decision, one way or the other, as an award under the 1958 New York Convention.

(D) As to the grounds for the Claimants’ Second Application, the Tribunal concludes that the
Claimants have made out a sufficient case, to the Tribunal’s satisfaction, under Article 26 of
the UNCITRAL Rules, for the order made below in the discretionary exercise of the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction to take interim measures in respect of the subject-matter of the Parties’ dispute;

(E) Bearing in mind the Respondent’s several obligations under the BIT and international law,
including the Respondent’s obligation to carry out and provide for the enforcement of an award
on the merits of the Parties’ dispute in these arbitration proceedings (assuming this Tribunal’s
jurisdiction to make such an award) the Tribunal orders:

(i) the Respondent to take all measures at its disposal to suspend or cause to be
suspended the enforcement or recognition within and without Ecuador of any judgment
against the First Claimant in the Lago Agrio Case; and

(ii) the Respondent’s Government to inform this Tribunal, by the Respondent’s legal
representatives in these arbitration proceedings, of all measures which the Respondent
has taken for the implementation of this order for interim measures;

pending further order or award in these arbitration proceedings, including the
Tribunal’s award on jurisdiction or (assuming jurisdiction) on the merits;

(F) The Tribunal records that it is common ground between the Claimants and the Respondent
in these proceedings, as also re-confirmed by the Respondent at the oral hearing on 6 February
2011 (page 107 of the English transcript and page 101 of the Spanish transcript) that, under
Ecuadorean law, a judgment entered in a domestic proceeding at first instance (such as a first-
instance judgment in the Lago Agrio Case) is not final, conclusive or enforceable during the

Part I: Annex | — Page 26

pendency of a first-level appeal until at least such time as that appeal has been decided by the
first-level appellate court;

(G) The Tribunal continues Paragraph C (1) to (3) of its order of 28 January 2011 (which order
is incorporated by reference herein);

(H) The Tribunal decides further that the Claimants shall be legally responsible, jointly and
severally, to the Respondent for any costs or losses which the Respondent may suffer in
performing its obligations under this order, as may be decided by the Tribunal within these
arbitration proceedings (to the exclusion of any other jurisdiction;

(I) This order shall be immediately final and binding upon all Parties, subject only to any
subsequent variation made by the Tribunal (upon either its own initiative or any Party’s
request); and

(J) This order, as with the earlier order of 26 [sic: 28] January 2011,° is made by the Tribunal
strictly without prejudice to any Party’s case as regards the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, the
Claimant’s First Application made by letter dated 12 December 2010, the Respondent’s
opposition to such First Application, and to any claim or defence by any Party as to the merits
of the Parties’ dispute.”

E: Procedural Order No 7 dated 16 March 2011, Paragraphs 1-10:

“1. The Tribunal here addresses the four disputed applications in these arbitration proceedings
regarding the Tribunal’s several orders for interim measures dated 14 May 2010, 28 January
2011 and 9 February 2011; namely: (i) the first application by the Claimants made by letter
dated 23 February 2011; (ii) the second application by the Respondent made by letter dated 24
February 2011; (iii) the third application by the Respondent made by letter dated 28 February
2011; and (iv) the fourth application by the Claimants made by letter dated 4 March 2011.

2. First Application: As regards the first application by the Claimants for further interim
measures against the Respondent in regard to the criminal proceedings in Ecuador concerning
(inter alios) two of the Claimants’ legal representatives (Messrs Ricardo Veiga and Rodrigo
Pérez), the Tribunal refers to the Claimants’ letter dated 23 February 2011, the Claimants’
email message dated 25 February 2011 and the Respondent's letter dated 10 March 2011.

3. Having considered the Parties’ written submissions listed in paragraph 2 above (with
attached exhibits), together with all other relevant circumstances in this case, the Tribunal does
not consider it appropriate to grant the Claimants’ application pleaded specifically at page 21
of their letter dated 23 February 2011, beyond maintaining the Tribunal’s existing orders for
interim measures.

4. Second Application: As regards the second application made by the Respondent seeking the
revocation of the Tribunal’s order dated 9 February 2011, the Tribunal refers to Part II of the
Respondent’s letter dated 24 February 2011 and the Claimants’ letter dated 4 March 2011.

5. Having considered the Parties’ written submissions listed in paragraph 4 above (with
attached exhibits), together with all other relevant circumstances in this case, the Tribunal does

8 This order of 28 January was mis-dated 26 January 2011.

Part I: Annex 1 — Page 27

not consider it appropriate to grant the Respondent’s application or the Claimants’ counter-
application, beyond maintaining its existing order for interim measures dated 9 February 2011.

6. Third Application: As regards the third application made by the Respondent in regard to
alleged violations by the Claimants of the Tribunal’s orders for interim measures and for
further interim measures, the Tribunal refers to the Respondent’s letter dated 28 February 2001
and the Claimants’ letters dated 4 and 10 March 2001.

7. Having considered the Parties’ written submissions listed in paragraph 6 above (with
attached exhibits), together with all other relevant circumstances in this case, the Tribunal does
not consider it appropriate to grant the Respondent’s application pleaded specifically at page
3 of its letter dated 28 February 2011, beyond maintaining the Tribunal’s existing orders for
interim measures.

8. Fourth Application: As regards the fourth application made by the Claimants in regard to
alleged violations by the Respondent of the Tribunal’s order dated 9 February 2011, the
Tribunal refers to the Claimants’ letter dated 4 March 2011.

9. Having considered the written submissions listed in paragraph 8 above (with attached
exhibits), together with all other relevant circumstances in this case, the Tribunal does not
consider it appropriate to grant the Claimants’ application, beyond maintaining the Tribunal’s
existing order for interim measures dated 9 February 2011.

10. This procedural order shall not prejudice any issue as regards jurisdiction, admissibility
or merits in these proceedings; nor shall it preclude any future application by any Party for
interim measures or like relief in the event of any change in relevant circumstances.”

F: First Interim Award on Interim Measures dated 25 January 2012, Operative Part (pp. 16-
17):

“1. Pursuant to Paragraph (C) of its Order dated 9 February 2011 and upon the following
terms, the Tribunal confirms and re-issues such Order as an Interim Award pursuant to Articles
26 and 32 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, specifically Paragraph (E) of such Order;
namely (as here modified):

2. Bearing in mind the Respondent's several obligations under the Treaty and international law,
including the Respondent's obligation to carry out and provide for the enforcement of an award
on the merits of the Parties' dispute in these arbitration proceedings (assuming this Tribunal's
jurisdiction to make such an award), the Tribunal orders:

(i) the Respondent to take all measures at its disposal to suspend or cause to be
suspended the enforcement or recognition within and without Ecuador of any judgment
against the First Claimant in the Lago Agrio Case; and

(ii) the Respondent's Government shall continue to inform this Tribunal, by the
Respondent's legal representatives in these arbitration proceedings, of all measures
which the Respondent has taken for the implementation of this Interim Award;

pending the February Hearing's completion and any further order or award in these arbitration
proceedings;

Part I: Annex 1 — Page 28

3. This Interim Award is and shall remain subject to modification (including its extension or
termination) by the Tribunal at or after the February Hearing; and, in the meantime, any of the
Parties may also apply to the Tribunal for such modification upon 72 hours' written notice for
good cause shown;

4. This Interim Award is made strictly without prejudice to the merits of the Parties' substantive
and other procedural disputes, including (but not limited to) the Parties' respective applications
to be heard at the February Hearing;

5. This Interim Award shall take effect forthwith as an Interim Award, being immediately final
and binding upon all Parties as an award subject only to any subsequent modifications herein
provided, whether upon the Tribunal's own initiative or any Party's application; and

6. This Interim Award, although separately signed by the Tribunal's members on three signing
pages, constitutes an ‘interim award’ signed by the arbitrators under Article 32 of the
UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.”

G: Second Interim Award on Interim Measures dated 16 February 2012, Operative Part (pp.
2-4) (issued after the February Hearing):

“1. The Tribunal determines that: (i) Article 26 of the UNCITRAL Rules (forming part of the
arbitration agreement invoked by the Claimants under the Treaty) permits this Tribunal, at the
request of a Party, to take interim measures (established in the form of an order or award) in
respect of the subject-matter of the Parties’ dispute; (ii) Article 32(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules
permits this Tribunal to make (inter alia) an award in the form of an interim award; (iii) Article
32(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that any award by this Tribunal is final and binding on
the Parties, with the Parties undertaking to carry out such award without delay; and (iv)
Articles VI.3(6) of the Treaty provides (inter alia) that an award rendered by this Tribunal
pursuant to Article VI.3(a)(tii) of the Treaty under the UNCITRAL Rules shall be binding on
the parties to the dispute (i.e. the Claimants and the Respondent), with the Contracting Parties
(i.e. here the Respondent) undertaking to carry out without delay the provisions of any such
award and to provide in its territory for its enforcement;

2. The Tribunal determines further that the Claimants have established, for the purpose of their
said applications for interim measures, (i) a sufficient case as regards both this Tribunal’s
jurisdiction to decide the merits of the Parties’ dispute and the Claimants’ case on the merits
against the Respondent; (ii) a sufficient urgency given the risk that substantial harm may befall
the Claimants before this Tribunal can decide the Parties’ dispute by any final award, and (iii)
a sufficient likelihood that such harm to the Claimants may be irreparable in the form of
monetary compensation payable by the Respondent in the event that the Claimants’ case on
jurisdiction, admissibility and the merits should prevail before this Tribunal;

3. Bearing in mind the Respondent’s several obligations under the Treaty and international
law, including the Respondent’s obligation to carry out and provide for the enforcement of an
award on the merits of the Parties’ dispute in these arbitration proceedings and the Tribunal’s
mission (required under the arbitration agreement) efficaciously and fairly to decide the
Parties’ dispute by a final award, the Tribunal hereby orders:

(i) the Respondent (whether by its judicial, legislative or executive branches) to take all

measures necessary to suspend or cause to be suspended the enforcement and
recognition within and without Ecuador of the judgments by the Provincial Court of

Part I: Annex 1 — Page 29

Sucumbios, Sole Division (Corte Provincial de Justicia de Sucumbios, Sala Unica de la
Corte Provincial de Justicia de Sucumbios) of 3 January 2012 and of 13 January 2012
(and, to the extent confirmed by the said judgments, of the judgment by Judge Nicolas
Zambrano Lozada of 14 February 2011) against the First Claimant in the Ecuadorian
legal proceedings known as “the Lago Agrio Case”;

(ii) in particular, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, such measures to
preclude any certification by the Respondent that would cause the said judgments to be
enforceable against the First Claimant; and

(iii) the Respondent’s Government to continue to inform this Tribunal, by the
Respondent’s legal representatives in these arbitration proceedings, of all measures
which the Respondent has taken for the implementation of its legal obligations under
this Second Interim Award;

until any further order or award made by the Tribunal in these arbitration proceedings;

4. The Tribunal determines that the Claimants shall be legally responsible, jointly and
severally, to the Respondent for any costs or losses which the Respondent may suffer in
performing its legal obligations under this Second Interim Award, as may be decided by the
Tribunal within these arbitration proceedings (to the exclusion of any other jurisdiction); and
further that, as security for such contingent responsibility the Claimants shall deposit within
thirty days of the date of this Second Interim Award the amount of US$ 50,000,000.00 (United
States Dollars Fifty Million) with the Permanent Court of Arbitration in a manner to be
designated separately, to the order of this Tribunal;

5. The Tribunal dismisses the application made by the Respondent to vacate its order for interim
measures of 9 February 2011;

6. The Tribunal's existing orders for interim measures (as recited in the First Interim Award)
and the First Interim Award shall continue to have effect subject to the terms of this Second
Interim Award;

7. This Second Interim Award is and shall remain subject to modification at any time before the
Tribunal's final award in these arbitration proceedings; and, in the meantime, any of the Parties
may also apply to the Tribunal for such modification upon seventy-two hours' written notice for
good cause shown, including any material change in the legal or factual circumstances
prevailing as at the date of the Hearing;

8. This Second Interim Award is made strictly without prejudice to the merits of the Parties'
substantive and other procedural disputes, including the Respondent's objections as to
jurisdiction, admissibility and merits;

9. This Second Interim Award shall take effect forthwith as an Interim Award, being
immediately final and binding upon all Parties as an award subject only to any subsequent
modification as herein provided, whether upon the Tribunal's own initiative or any Party's
application; and

10. This Interim Award, although separately signed by the Tribunal’s members on three signing

pages constitutes an ‘interim award’ signed by the three arbitrators under Article 32 of the
UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.”

H: Third Interim Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility of 27 February 2012, Operative
Part (issued following the Hearing on Jurisdiction held on 22 and 23 November 2010 in

5.2 The Tribunal declares that it has jurisdiction to proceed to the merits phase of these
arbitration proceedings with the claims pleaded in the Claimant’s [sic: Claimants’] Notice of
Arbitration dated 23 September 2009, subject to the following sub-paragraphs;

5.3 A regards the claims pleaded by the Second Claimant (Texaco Petroleum Company or

Admissibility dated 26 July 2010, its Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction Objections dated 6
October 2010 and its further submissions at the Jurisdiction Hearing on 22 and 23 November
2010;

5.4 As regards the claims pleaded by the First Claimant (Chevron Corporation or “Chevron” )
in the Claimants’ said Notice of Arbitration, to reject all objections made by the Respondent as
to jurisdiction and admissibility in its said memorials and further submissions, save those

Article I(1)(a) alleging a “direct” investment under Article VI(1)(c) and an “investment
agreement” under Article VI(1)(a) of the Ecuador-USA Treaty of 27 August 1993 which are
Joined to the merits of the First Claimants’[sic: Claimant’s] claims under Article 21(4) of the
UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules forming part of the Parties’ arbitration agreement under the
Treaty; and

5.5 As regards the Parties’ respective claims for costs, the Tribunal here makes no order save
to reserve in full its jurisdiction and powers to decide such claims by a later order or award in
these arbitration proceedings.”

I: Fourth Interim Award on Interim Measures of 7 February 2013, Operative Part (p. 31)
(issued after the Hearing on 26-28 November 2012 and further written submissions — the
“November Hearing”’):

“T) The Tribunal declares that the Respondent has violated the First and Second Interim
Awards under the Treaty, the UNCITRAL Rules and international law in regard to the
finalisation and enforcement subject to execution of the Lago Agrio Judgment within and
outside Ecuador, including (but not limited to) Canada, Brazil and Argentina;

2) The Tribunal decides that the Respondent shall show cause, in accordance with a
procedural timetable to be ordered by the Tribunal separately, why it (the Respondent) should
not compensate the First Claimant for any harm caused by the Respondent’s violations of the
First and Second Interim Awards;

3) The Tribunal declares and confirms that the Respondent was and remains legally
obliged under international law to ensure that the Respondent ’s commitments under the Treaty
and the UNCITRAL Rules are not rendered nugatory by the finalisation, enforcement or
execution of the Lago Agrio Judgment in violation of the First and Second Interim Awards; and

Part I: Annex | — Page 31

4) The Tribunal states expressly that: (i) it has not yet decided any of the substantive merits
of the Parties’ dispute; and (ii) this award is made strictly without prejudice to those merits,
including all claims advanced by the Claimants and all defences advanced by the Respondent.”

J: First Partial Award on Track I dated 17 September 2013, Operative Part, Paragraph 112:

“112. For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal finally decides and awards as follows in
Track I of these arbitration proceedings:

(1) The First Claimant (“Chevron”) and the Second Claimant (“TexPet”) are both
“Releasees” under Article 5.1 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement and Article IV of the 1998
Final Release;

(2) As such a Releasee, a party to and also part of the 1995 Settlement Agreement, the First
Claimant can invoke its contractual rights thereunder in regard to the release in Article 5.1 of
the 1995 Settlement Agreement and Article IV of the 1998 Final Release as fully as the Second
Claimant as a signatory party and named Releasee;

(3) The scope of the releases in Article 5 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement and Article IV of
the 1998 Final Release made by the Respondent to the First and Second Claimants does not
extend to any environmental claim made by an individual for personal harm in respect of that
individual’s rights separate and different from the Respondent; but it does have legal effect
under Ecuadorian law precluding any “diffuse” claim against the First and Second Claimants
under Article 19-2 of the Constitution made by the Respondent and also made by any individual
not claiming personal harm (actual or threatened); and

(4) Save as aforesaid, the Tribunal does not here decide (one way or the other) any part of the
formal relief claimed by the Parties respectively in regard to Track I, reserving to itself its full
powers and discretion to do so in one or more later awards.”

K: Decision (by a majority) on Track IB Issues dated 12 March 2015: Operative Part,
Paragraphs 186-187:

“186. For the reasons set out above, as regards the said Issue (ii) in Track IB of this arbitration,
the Tribunal decides (but does not award) that:

(1) The Lago Agrio Complaint of 7 May 2003, as an initial pleading, included individual claims
resting upon individual rights under Ecuadorian law, not falling within the scope of the 1995
Settlement Agreement (as invoked by the Claimants);

(2) The Lago Agrio Complaint was not wholly barred at its inception by res judicata, under
Ecuadorian law, by virtue of the 1995 Settlement Agreement (as invoked by the Claimants);
and

(3) The Lago Agrio Complaint included individual claims materially similar, in substance, to
the individual claims made by the Aguinda Plaintiffs in New York.

187. No other part of the Parties’ claimed relief in Track IB is here decided by the Tribunal;
and the Tribunal retains in full its jurisdiction and powers to address and decide such relief
(including costs) by one or more further orders, decisions or awards at a later stage of these
arbitration proceedings.”

First and Second Interim Awards:

1. Declare that Ecuador is in breach of the First and Second Interim Awards;

for all damages, costs, expenses, and attorneys’ fees incurred by Claimants as a result
of its breach.

II. Request for a Partial Final Award as a Result of Track 1:

request for relief (with sub-paragraphs here added for ease of reference):

“263. [1] Based on the foregoing, the Republic respectfully requests that the Tribunal
declare that it does not have jurisdiction over Chevron’s claims under the Settlement and
Release Agreements and reject TexPet’s contractual claims under the 1995 Settlement
Agreement. In particular, the Republic requests that the Tribunal:

[2] Dismiss Chevron’s claims under the 1995 Settlement Agreement and the 1998 Final
Release for lack of jurisdiction under Article VI(1)(a) of the Treaty;

[3] Dismiss Chevron’s claims for lack of jurisdiction under Article VI(1)(c) of the Treaty
to the extent that its treaty claims are predicated on breach of the 1995 Settlement
Agreement and/or the 1998 Final Release;

Release on the merits, should the Tribunal find that Chevron has standing in this

7 Declare specifically that the Respondent has not breached the 1995 Settlement
Agreement or the 1998 Final Release;

[7] Declare further that the Respondent is under no obligation to indemnify, protect,

[8] Declare that the 1995 Settlement Agreement has no effect on third parties, and
specifically, that the release of liability contained therein does not extend to rights and
claims potentially held by third parties or could otherwise bar third-party claims arising
from the environmental impact of TexPet’s operations in Ecuador against TexPet or any
of the defined Releasees;

 

proceedings;

[10] Award Respondent any further relief that the Tribunal deems just and proper.”

Part I: Annex 3 — Page 50

A3.10 In its Track 1 Rejoinder Memorial dated 16 December 2013, the Respondent made the
following request for relief (with sub-paragraphs here added for ease of reference):

“192. Based on the foregoing, the Republic respectfully requests that the Tribunal issue
an Award that:

[1] Denies all the relief and each remedy requested by Claimants in relation to Track 1,
including the relief and remedies requested in Paragraph 272 of Claimants’ Reply on the
Merits;

[2] Declares that Chevron is not a “Releasee” under the 1995 Settlement Agreement and
therefore has no basis to assert claims under Article VI(1)(a) of the Treaty.

Release on the merits, should the Tribunal find that Chevron has standing in this
Arbitration as a matter of jurisdiction;

relief obtained by, third parties including the claims filed by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs,

of the defined Releasees;

[10] Declares that the Lago Agrio Litigation was not barred by res judicata or collateral

A3.11 In its Track 1 Supplementary Counter-Memorial dated 31 March 2014, the Respondent

A3.12

made the following request for relief:

“143. Based on the foregoing, together with the Republic’s previous Track I submissions
and argument and testimony presented in the November 2012 Hearing on the Merits, the
Republic respectfully requests that the Tribunal issue an Award that:

In its Track II Counter Memorial on the Merits dated 18 February 2013, the

Respondent made the following request for relief:

“542. For the aforementioned reasons, the Republic requests that the Tribunal issue a

Final Award that grants the following relief:

a. Declaring that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over Claimants’ denial of justice
claims, or that it refuses to exercise such jurisdiction because such claims are
too remote to any investment.

b. Alternatively, dismissing Claimants’ denial of justice and Treaty claims due to
the failure of Chevron to exhaust local remedies available to it to challenge the
Lago Agrio Judgment in Ecuador.

c. Alternatively, dismissing Claimants’ Treaty and denial of justice claims because

the rights that Claimants claim to have under the 1995 Settlement Agreement do
not exist or were not breached.

Part I: Annex 3 — Page 52

d. Alternatively, even if the 1995 Settlement Agreement has been breached by the
Republic, dismissing all of Claimants’ Treaty claims, inter alia, because
Claimants have separately failed to establish that the Republic has violated the
effective means clause; the fair and equitable treatment clause; the full
protection and security clause; the arbitrary and discriminatory treatment
clause.

e. Alternatively, even if the 1995 Settlement Agreement has been breached by the
Republic, dismissing Claimants’ denial of justice claims because Claimants
have failed to establish that the Republic has denied justice to Claimants under

principles of customary international law.

f Otherwise dismissing all of Claimants’ claims against the Republic in these
arbitration proceedings as meritless.

g. Awarding all costs and attorneys’ fees incurred by the Republic in this arbitral
proceeding.

h. Any other and further relief that the Tribunal deems just and proper.

543. To the extent the Tribunal finds the Republic responsible for a violation of
international law, the Republic requests that the Tribunal conduct a further
phase (Track 3) of the arbitration sufficient to determine Chevron’s actual
liability in fact for the claims asserted against it in Lago Agrio and to fashion a
final award that takes into consideration such established liability.

544. The Republic reincorporates by reference its Request for Relief in Track I to the
extent that such Request remains pending.

545. The Republic reserves its rights to supplement its pleadings and request for
relief.”

A3.13 In its Track II Rejoinder on the Merits dated 16 December 2013, the Respondent made
the following request for relief (footnotes here omitted):

“387. For the aforementioned reasons, the Republic requests that the Tribunal issue a
Final Award, in which the Tribunal:

a. Denies all the relief and each remedy requested by Claimants in relation to
Track II, including the relief and remedies requested in Paragraph 424 of
Claimants’ Amended Track II Reply on the Merits.

b. Declares that it lacks jurisdiction over Claimants’ denial of justice claims, or
refuses to exercise such jurisdiction because such claims are too remote to any
investment.

c. Alternatively, dismisses Claimants’ denial of justice and Treaty claims due to

Chevron’s failure to exhaust local remedies available to it to challenge the Lago
Agrio Judgment in Ecuador.

Part I: Annex 3 — Page 53

. Alternatively, dismisses Claimants’ Treaty and denial of justice claims because
the rights that Claimants claim to have under the 1995 Settlement Agreement,
the 1998 Final Release, and/or the 1996 Local Settlements do not exist or were
not breached.

Alternatively, even if the 1995 Settlement Agreement, the 1998 Final Release,
and/or the 1996 Local Settlements was breached by the Republic, dismisses all
of Claimants’ Treaty claims because Claimants have separately failed to
establish that the Republic has violated any of the Treaty’s provisions.

Alternatively, even if the 1995 Settlement Agreement, the 1998 Final Release,
and/or the 1996 Local Settlements has been breached by the Republic, dismisses
Claimants’ denial of justice claims because Claimants have failed to establish
that the Republic has denied justice to Claimants under principles of customary
international law.

. Alternatively, even if any of Claimants’ Treaty or denial of justice claims are
upheld, declares that the Lago Agrio Judgment is not null and void because
nullification is not an available or appropriate remedy under international law
and such nullification would unjustly enrich Claimants.

. Alternatively, even if any of Claimants’ claims are upheld, orders the arbitration
proceedings to continue to Track 3, so that the Tribunal may assess what
Chevron’s liability should have been for the claims asserted in Lago Agrio so
that the Tribunal may fashion a final award that takes into consideration such
liability.

Declares further that the Respondent is under no obligation to indemnify,
protect, defend or otherwise hold Claimants harmless against claims by third
parties.

Declares that the 1995 Settlement Agreement has no effect on the claims brought
in the Lago Agrio Litigation.

Otherwise dismisses all of Claimants’ claims against the Republic in these
arbitration proceedings as meritless.

Orders, pursuant to Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Claimants
to pay all costs and expenses of this arbitration proceeding, including the fees
and expenses of the Tribunal and the cost of the Republic’s legal representation,
plus pre-award and post-award interest thereon.

Awards any other and further relief that the Tribunal deems just and proper.
The Republic reincorporates by reference its Request for Relief in Track I and
in its Track II Counter-Memorial on the Merits to the extent that such Request

remains pending.

The Republic reserves its rights to supplement its pleadings and request for
relief.”

Part I: Annex 3 — Page 54

A3.14In its Track II Supplemental Counter-Memorial dated 7 November 2014, the

Respondent made the following request for relief (footnotes here omitted):

“481.

482.

483.

e.

For the aforementioned reasons, the Republic requests that the Tribunal issue a
Final Award:

Declaring that it lacks jurisdiction over Claimants’ denial of justice and Treaty
claims against the Republic.

. Alternatively, assuming the Tribunal finds it has jurisdiction over the denial of

justice and Treaty claims, it should dismiss Claimants’ denial of justice and
Treaty claims against the Republic as meritless.

Declaring that Claimants do not possess the rights they claim to have under the
1995 Settlement Agreement, the 1998 Final Release, and/or the 1996 Local
Settlements in connection with the Lago Agrio Litigation.

Declaring further that no breach of the 1995 Settlement Agreement, the 1998
Final Release, and/or the 1996 Local Settlements occurred in connection with
the Lago Agrio Litigation.

Denying all the relief and each remedy requested by Claimants in relation to
Track II, including the relief requested in Paragraph 199 of their Supplemental
Track II Memorial on the Merits.

Alternatively, if any of Claimants’ claims are upheld, the Republic requests, for
the aforementioned reasons, that the Tribunal issue a Partial Award, in which
the Tribunal:

Orders the arbitration proceedings to proceed to Track 3, so that the Tribunal
may assess Chevron’s actual liability in respect of the claims asserted against
them in the Lago Agrio Litigation so that the Tribunal may fashion a final award
that takes into consideration such liability.

Declares that the Respondent is under no obligation to indemnify, protect,
defend or otherwise hold Claimants harmless against claims by third parties,
including but not limited to, Claimants’ request for attorneys’ fees incurred in
any enforcement action in any jurisdiction.

Declares that Claimants are not entitled to moral damages.

Declares that the Lago Agrio Judgment is not null and void because nullification
is not an available or appropriate remedy under international law and such
nullification would unjustly enrich Claimants.

In all events, the Republic requests that, pursuant to Article 40 of the
UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Claimants be ordered to pay all costs and
expenses of this arbitration proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the
Tribunal and the cost of the Republic’s legal representation, plus pre-award and
post-award interest thereon. The Republic also asks that the Tribunal grant it
any other and further relief that the Tribunal deems just and proper.

The Republic incorporates by reference its Request for Relief in Track I and in
its Track II Counter-Memorial and Rejoinder on the Merits to the extent that
such Requests remain pending.”

A3.15In its Track II Supplemental Rejoinder on the Merits dated 17 March 2015 the

Respondent made the following request for relief (footnotes here omitted):

“446,

447.

e.

For the aforementioned reasons, the Republic requests that the Tribunal issue a
Final Award:

Declaring that it lacks jurisdiction over Claimants’ denial of justice and
related treaty claims against the Republic.

. Alternatively, assuming the Tribunal finds it has jurisdiction over the denial

of justice and Treaty claims, dismissing Claimants’ denial of justice and
related treaty claims against the Republic as not ripe for adjudication under
international law in light of Claimants’ failure to exhaust available local
remedies, and as otherwise meritless.

Declaring that Claimants do not possess the rights they claim to have under
the 1995 Settlement Agreement, the 1998 Final Release, and/or the 1996 Local
Settlements in connection with the Lago Agrio Litigation.

Declaring further that no breach of the 1995 Settlement Agreement, the 1998
Final Release, and/or the 1996 Local Settlements occurred in connection with
the Lago Agrio Litigation.

Denying all the relief and each remedy r d by Claimants in relation to
Track II, including the relief r din Paragraph 435 of their Suppl l
Track II Reply.

Alternatively, if any of Claimants’ claims are upheld, the Republic requests, for
the aforementioned reasons, that the Tribunal issue a Partial Award, in which
the Tribunal:

Orders the arbitration proceedings to proceed to Track 3, so that the Tribunal
may assess Chevron’s actual liability in respect of the claims asserted against
them in the Lago Agrio Litigation so that the Tribunal may fashion a final award
that takes into consideration such liability.

Declares that the R il is_under_no obligation to inde ify, protect,
defend or otherwise hold Claimants harmless against claims by third parties.

 

including but not limited to, Claimants’ request for attorneys’ fees incurred in

any enforcement action in any jurisdiction.

       

Declares that Claimants are not entitled to moral damages.

 

is not_an available or appropriate remedy under inter i Ll law and such

nullification would unjustly enrich Claimants.

448. Inall events, the Republic requests that, pursuant to Article 40 of the UNCITRAL
Arbitration Rules, Clai be ordered to pay all costs and expenses of this
arbitration proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the
cost of the Republic’s legal repr i plus _pre-award and _post-award

interest thereon. The Republic also asks that the Tribunal grant it any other and
further relief that the Tribunal deems just and proper.

 

 

449. The Republic incorporates by reference its Request for Relief in Track I and in
its Track IT Counter-Memorial, Rejoinder, and Supplemental Counter-
Memorial, to the extent that such Requests remain pending.”
A3.16 Paragraph 449 of the Respondent’s Track II Supplemental Rejoinder on the Merits

(cited immediately above):

The Respondent here incorporated by general reference certain pending relief requested
in its earlier pleadings submitted under both Track I and Track II, namely, as cited above
(i) as to Track I, the Respondent’s Track 1 Counter-Memorial (Paragraph 263), the
Respondent’s Track I Rejoinder (Paragraph 192), the Respondent’s Track I Supplemental

PART I- ANNEX 4

THE ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS?

From 2012 onwards, the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs have sought to enforce and execute the
Lago Agrio Judgment in (i) Ecuador, (ii) Canada, (iii) Brazil and (iv) Argentina against
the First Claimant (Chevron), the Second Claimant (TexPet) and/or the First Claimant’s
associated companies (for ease of reference, here collectively called “Chevron” save

where indicated otherwise). !°

(i) Ecuador: On 15 October 2012, the Provincial Court for Sucumbios ordered that the
Lago Agrio Judgment’s execution “be applicable to the entirety of the assets of Chevron
Corporation, until such time as the entire obligation has been satisfied.”''! Assets subject
to the attachment order included Chevron’s intellectual property in Ecuador, including
certain trademarks owned by Chevron Intellectual Property LLC, its bank accounts in
Ecuador or transfers through the Ecuadorian banking system and TexPet’s bank account
at Banco Pichincha in Ecuador. On 25 October 2012, the Court extended the attachment

order to additional trademark and intellectual property in Ecuador. !”

The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs have attempted to seize Chevron’s other assets under the
attachment order in Ecuador. In two motions dated 30 January 2015, the Lago Agrio
Plaintiffs asked the Court to instruct the Ecuadorian Intellectual Property Institute
(“EIPY’) to renew certain trademarks owned by Chevron Intellectual Property LLC and
separately order those trademarks embargoed pursuant to the Court’s enforcement orders.
On 5 April 2016, the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs asked the Court to appoint a depository to
withdraw funds that were seized from TexPet’s bank account at Banco Pichincha in
Ecuador. On 11 April 2016, the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs requested that the Court rule on the
Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ prior application for the EIPI to renew and embargo certain
trademarks. On 7 June 2016, the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs requested that the court formally

notify Ecuador of the 27 June 2013 attachment of the Commercial Cases Award. On 12

to any of these enforcement proceedings).

July 2016, the Court, inter alia, denied the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ 5 and 11 April 2016

motions, and granted their 7 June 2016 request.

4. On 21 July 2016, the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs filed a motion requesting that the Court cancel
the embargo of the Commercial Cases Award. The Court granted this motion on the same

day. On 22 July 2016, Ecuador paid the Commercial Cases Award to Chevron in full.

5. In the meantime, to the Tribunal’s current understanding, these enforcement actions in

Ecuador remain pending against Chevron.

6. (ti) Canada: On 30 May 2012, the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs brought legal proceedings in
Ontario, Canada to enforce the Lago Agrio Judgment against Chevron Corporation and
Chevron Canada Limited (the latter being an indirect subsidiary of Chevron Corporation)
in the principal sum of US$ 18.26 billion. By its judgment dated 1 May 2013, the Ontario
Superior Court denied enforcement of the judgment and ordered a stay of the

proceedings. '*

7. The case proceeded to the Canadian Supreme Court. In September 2015, the Canadian
Supreme Court rejected Chevron’s jurisdictional challenge. The Supreme Court
confirmed that it had jurisdiction over Chevron to decide the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’
request to recognise the Lago Agrio Judgment.'* After Chevron and Chevron Canada
Limited filed answers in October 2015, the parties filed cross-motions for summary
judgment, with the defendant parties seeking to dismiss Chevron Canada Limited from

the action based (inter alia) on its separate corporate identity.

8. On 20 January 2017, after discovery, written pleadings and oral argument, the Ontario
Superior Court granted a motion for summary judgment in favour of Chevron Canada
Limited, deciding that it was a separate entity from Chevron, was not a party to the Lago
Agrio Litigation, nor a debtor under the Lago Agrio Judgment, and, therefore, to be
dismissed from the case. The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs appealed that decision. A hearing of
that appeal was scheduled for 10-11 October 2017, and later for 17-18 April 2018. It

appears that judgment was reserved. !>

Earlier, in October 2016, the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs moved to amend their statement of
claim to add Chevron Canada Capital Company (another indirect subsidiary of Chevron
Corporation) as an additional defendant. The Court dismissed this motion to amend on
25 January 2017. The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs appealed that decision also. This appeal was
also scheduled be heard on 17-18 April 2018. It appears that judgment was here also

reserved. '©

In the meantime, to the Tribunal’s current understanding, this recognition action in

Canada remains pending against Chevron.

(iii) Brazil: On 27 June 2012, the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs sought recognition of the Lago
Agrio Judgment in Brazil. On 2 February 2015, the Superior Tribunal de Justiga ordered
that the case file be given to the Brazilian Federal Prosecutor’s Office to issue an opinion
on the recognition claim. On 11 May 2015, the Federal Prosecutor issued an opinion
(published on 13 May 2015) recommending that the Superior Tribunal de Justica not
recognize the Lago Agrio Judgment, concluding that recognising the Lago Agrio
Judgment would be contrary to Brazilian public order. The Federal Prosecutor’s opinion
is a non-binding recommendation; and it has not been accepted (or rejected) by the

Brazilian Court.

On 29 November 2017, the Court held a judgment session, wherein it rejected the request
of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs for recognition of the Lago Agrio Judgment. The Court
published its final judgment on 15 March 2018.'7 According to the Claimants, the parties
may seek clarification of this decision or may choose to appeal it.!* The Respondent
argues that the Court’s decision is, in fact, final in all respects, since the only appeal
available (a “recurso extraordindrio” before the Supreme Court of Brazil) is limited in
scope and restricted to the review of matters pertaining to the Federal Constitution, and

there are no constitutional matters at issue involved in this decision.'°

In the meantime, to the Tribunal’s current understanding, this recognition action in Brazil

remains pending against Chevron.

14. (iv) Argentina: On 12 November 2012, the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs filed enforcement
proceedings in Argentina, seeking recognition of the Lago Agrio Judgment. Upon request
from the Civil Court, on 30 March 2016, the Public Prosecutor issued an opinion to the
effect that the Lago Agrio Judgment should not be recognized. The Public Prosecutor
ratified that opinion on 20 December 2016. As in Brazil, the Public Prosecutor’s opinion
in Argentina is a non-binding recommendation; and it has not been accepted (or rejected)

by the Argentinian Civil Court.

15. In September 2017, Chevron requested a final judgment dismissing the enforcement
proceedings, which was granted by the Civil Court on 31 October 2017. The Lago Agrio

Plaintiffs appealed that decision; and the appeal is pending.”°

16. In the meantime, to the Tribunal’s current understanding, this recognition action in

Argentina remains pending against Chevron.

to the right of each Party to make or maintain exceptions falling within one of the sectors or matters
listed in the Protocol to this Treaty. Each Party agrees to notify the other Party before or on the date of
entry into force of this Treaty of all such laws and regulations of which it is aware concerning the sectors

2. (a) Nothing in this Treaty shall be construed to prevent a Party from maintaining or establishing

(b) Each Party shall ensure that any state enterprise that it maintains or establishes acts in a

State, Territory or possession of the United States of America be no less favorable than the treatment
accorded therein to investments and associated activities of nationals of the United States of America

discriminatory manner; upon payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation; and in

3. Nationals or companies of either Party whose investments suffer losses in the territory of the other
Party owing to war or other armed conflict, revolution, state of national emergency, insurrection, civil
disturbance or other similar events shall be accorded treatment by such other Party no less favorable
than that accorded to its own nationals or companies or to nationals or companies of any third country,
whichever is the most favorable treatment, as regards any measures it adopts in relation to such losses.

concerned may choose to submit the dispute, under one of the following alternatives, for resolution:

for settlement by binding arbitration:

(i) to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (“Centre”)
established by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States

initiate arbitration in accordance with the choice so specified in the consent.

4. Each Party hereby consents to the submission of any investment dispute for settlement by binding
arbitration in accordance with the choice specified in the written consent of the national or company
under paragraph 3. Such consent, together with the written consent of the national or company when
given under paragraph 3 shall satisfy the requirement for:

(a) written consent of the parties to the dispute for Purposes of Chapter II of the ICSID
Convention (Jurisdiction of the Centre) and for purposes of the Additional Facility Rules; and

(b) an “agreement in writing” for purposes of Article II of the United Nations Convention on

(“New York Convention”).

Part I: Annex 5 — Page 66

5. Any arbitration under paragraph 3(a) (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this Article shall be held in a state that is a
party to the New York Convention.

6. Any arbitral award rendered pursuant to this Article shall be final and binding on the parties to the

its alleged damages.

1. Any dispute between the Parties concerning the interpretation or application of the Treaty which is
not resolved through consultations or other diplomatic channels, shall be submitted, upon the request of

international law. In the absence of an agreement by the Parties to the contrary, the arbitration rules of
the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), except to the extent
modified by the Parties or by the arbitrators, shall govern.

2. Within two months of receipt of a request, each Party shall appoint an arbitrator. The two arbitrators
shall select a third arbitrator as Chairman, who is a national of a third State. The UNCITRAL Rules for

arbitral panel except that the appointing authority referenced in those rules shall be the Secretary General
of the Centre.

3. Unless otherwise agreed, all submissions shall be made and all hearings shall be completed within six
months of the date of selection of the third arbitrator, and the Tribunal shall render its decisions within
two months of the date of the final submissions or the date of the closing of the hearings, whichever is
later.

PART IT

THE PRINCIPAL ISSUES

A: Introduction

The several claims made by the Claimants and the several responses made by the
Respondent in this arbitration are recorded in their respective pleaded requests for relief.
These pleadings are fully set out in Annex 3 to Part I of this Award, above. As there
formulated, these comprise a range of specific requests, reflecting the particular facts of
the Parties’ dispute arising from the Lago Agrio Litigation and the Judgments of the
Lago Agrio Court, the Lago Agrio Appellate Court, the Cassation (National) Court and

the Constitutional Court of the Respondent.

These facts were first pleaded in the Claimants’ Notice of Arbitration of 23 September
2009 and disputed by the Respondent’s initial pleading of 3 May 2010, during the
pendency of the Lago Agrio Litigation (begun in 2003) but before the Judgments of the
Lago Agrio Court (2011), the Lago Agrio Appellate Court (2012), the Cassation Court
(2013) and the Constitutional Court (2018). As the Parties’ dispute continued and
deepened from 2009 onwards, after the commencement of this arbitration, the Parties’
respective pleadings have correspondingly developed to take account of these new and

other events, up to 25 July 2018.

These disputed facts and requests are, however, all focused on the overall dispute that
lay and continues to lie at the heart of this case between the Claimants and the

Respondent.

In brief, the Claimants assert that TexPet (with Texaco) made an investment in the form
of an oil concession in the Oriente, Ecuador (beginning in 1964); that this investment
was subsequently acquired by Chevron when it “merged” with Texaco and acquired
TexPet, as Texaco’s subsidiary (in 2001); that the Respondent agreed (in 1995-1998)
on the extent of the responsibility of TexPet, Texaco and subsequently Chevron for
clean-up operations and on the extent of their residual liability for environmental harm
in the concession area; that, in breach of that agreement, the Respondent facilitated legal

proceedings by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs in the form of the Lago Agrio Litigation

Part II — Page 1

2.5

2.6

2.7

2.8

against Chevron; that such proceedings were subject to procedural fraud and judicial
misconduct by judges of the Lago Agrio Court; that the Lago Agrio Judgment was
‘ghostwritten’ by representatives of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs in corrupt collusion with
the presiding judge of the Lago Agrio Court; that the Lago Agrio Appellate Court, the
Cassation Court and the Constitutional Court left such fraud, misconduct and corruption
unremedied; that the Lago Agrio Appellate Court rendered enforceable the Lago Agrio
Judgment, within and without Ecuador (in 2012); and that the Respondent (by its
judicial branch, aided and abetted by its executive branch) failed to provide to both
Chevron and TexPet the legal protections to which they were entitled in the Lago Agrio

Litigation.

The Claimants (as USA nationals) contend that these facts disclose multiple breaches
by the Respondent of their rights under the Treaty (including customary international
law); that many of these breaches have a continuing character that was renewed,
repeated and maintained in successive factual developments; and that these international
wrongs have caused and are still causing injuries to each of them; and that the Claimants
(particularly Chevron) became and remain exposed to potentially disastrous legal
proceedings for the enforcement of the corrupt Lago Agrio Judgment in multiple

jurisdictions, not limited to Ecuador or the USA.

The Claimants contend that these breaches of the Treaty are rooted in: (i) the failure of
the Respondent to give effect to the agreements made by the Respondent concerning the
responsibility and residual liability for environmental damage (collectively, the “1995
Settlement Agreement”); (ii) the issuing, rendering enforceable and maintaining the
enforceability of the Lago Agrio Judgment (as varied by the Cassation Court); and (iii)
the failure of the Respondent to take effective steps to address and remedy the

procedural fraud, judicial misconduct and ‘ghostwriting’ of the Lago Agrio Judgment.

The Claimants assert that this Tribunal has jurisdiction under the Treaty to decide their

claims; and, also, that their claims are admissible in this arbitration under the Treaty.

In brief, the Respondent denies: (i) that Chevron has, or has had, any investment in
Ecuador relevant to the Treaty; (ii) that this Tribunal has any jurisdiction to address the

Claimants’ claims under the Treaty; (iii) that the Claimants’ claims are admissible in

Part II — Page 2

2.9

2.10

2.11

2.12

this arbitration under the Treaty; and (iv) that the Claimants’ cases, on their merits,

entitle either of them to any of the relief which they claim in this arbitration.

In this arbitration, the procedural fraud, judicial misconduct and corruption in the Lago
Agrio Litigation and the Lago Agrio Judgment (as alleged by the Claimants and denied
by the Respondent), taken together, were commonly referred to by the Parties as a
‘denial of justice’. The Tribunal is content to adopt that usage. In doing so, however,
the Tribunal draws attention to the fact that its mandate in this arbitration is focused on
the question of alleged breaches of the Treaty (including customary international law).

The Treaty does not make express provision for denial of justice.

The principal issues to be addressed by the Tribunal in this Award, under Track II of
this arbitration, are whether the Tribunal has any jurisdiction over Chevron’s claims
under the Treaty; (if so) whether such claims are admissible under the Treaty; if so,
whether any alleged conduct attributable to the Respondent amounts to a violation of
the Treaty (including customary international law); if and to the extent that these
questions are answered affirmatively, to what forms of relief are Chevron and TexPet
entitled under the Treaty (including customary international law); and, in any event, to
what forms of relief is the Respondent entitled under the Treaty (including, again,

customary international law).

These principal issues subsume a mass of lesser factual, expert, forensic and legal issues.
For the purpose of this Award, the Tribunal has addressed these issues in the several
Parts that follow. For ease of reference, the subject-matters of these different Parts are

described below.

The Tribunal does not here revisit its determinations made in its earlier awards, orders
and decision. This Award is limited to issues arising in Track II of this Arbitration, as
identified by the Parties up to 25 July 2018. Thus, this Award does not address issues
already decided in Tracks 1 and 1B or still to be addressed in Track III of this arbitration.
Moreover, the Tribunal has not thought it necessary to decide all the issues listed for

Track II by the Parties.

D: The 1995-1998 Settlement and Release Agreements

The term “1995-1998 Settlement and Release Agreements” as generally used in this
Award (save where the context requires otherwise) comprises three sets of contractual
documentation: (i) the 1995 Settlement Agreement of 4 May 1995; (ii) the 1996
Municipal and Provincial Releases; and (iii) the 1998 Final Release.! This

documentation was made in Spanish; and the citations below are all English translations.

(1) The 1995 Settlement Agreement: On 4 May 1995, the Respondent acting by its
Ministry of Energy and Mining (“the Ministry”) and PetroEcuador as “one Party” and
TexPet as “the other party” initialled and signed a written agreement entitled “Contract
for Implementing of Environmental, Remedial Work and Release from Obligations,

Liability and Claims”.

The 1995 Settlement Agreement was made on the Ministry’s headed note-paper with
the Respondent’s coat-of-arms; and it was signed for that Ministry by the Minister of
Energy and Mines. It was also signed by a senior officer of PetroEcuador and two
representatives of TexPet (now, but not then, indirectly owned by Chevron): Dr Ricardo

Reis Veiga and Mr Rodrigo Pérez Pallares.

The 1995 Settlement Agreement provided in the final two paragraphs of its preamble
that TexPet agreed to undertake the “Environmental Remedial Work in consideration
for being released and discharged of all its legal and contractual obligations and liability
for Environmental Impact arising out of the Consortium’s operations.” By Article 1.3,
the term “Environmental Impact” included: “[a]ny solid, liquid, or gaseous substance
present or released into the environment in such concentration or condition, the presence
or release of which causes, or has the potential to cause harm to human health or the

environment.”

As contemplated in the earlier 1994 MOU between the same signatory parties (which
was to be substituted and become void by Article 9.6 and the last paragraph of Annex
“A” of the 1995 Settlement Agreement), the 1995 Settlement Agreement, subject to its
terms: (i) released TexPet from the Respondent’s and PetroEcuador’s claims based upon

Environmental Impact (except for claims related to TexPet’s performance of the Scope

' These documents were more fully set out and considered in the Tribunal’s First Partial Award, which also
contained a copy of the full version of the Settlement Agreement as signed by the parties (in Spanish).

3.22

3.23

of Work); and (ii) provided that TexPet would be released from all remaining

environmental liability upon completion of the remediation obligations described in that

Scope of Work.

Article 1.12 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement defined such release, as follows:

“The release, under the provisions of Article V of this Contract, of all legal and
contractual obligations and liability, towards the Government and Petroecuador,
for the Environmental Impact arising from the Operations of the Consortium,
including any claims that the Government and Petroecuador have, or may have
against Texpet, arising out of the Consortium Agreements.”

The term “Operations of the Consortium” was defined as “Those oil exploration and
production operations carried out under the Consortium Agreement”, i.e. the 1973

Concession Agreement.

Article 5.1 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement (“Article V”) provides (inter alia), in

material part:

“On the execution date of this Contract [i.e. 4 May 1995], and in consideration of
Texpet’s agreement to perform the Environmental Remedial Work in accordance
with the Scope of Work set out in Annex A, and the Remedial Action Plan, the
Government and Petroecuador shall hereby release, acquit and forever discharge
Texpet, Texaco Petroleum Company, Compania Texaco de Petréleos del Ecuador,
S.A., Texaco Inc., and all their respective agents, servants, employees, officers,
directors, legal representatives, insurers, attorneys, indemnitors, guarantors, heirs,
administrators, executors, beneficiaries, successors, predecessors, principals and
subsidiaries (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Releasees’) of all the Government’s and
Petroecuador’s claims against the Releasees for Environmental Impact arising
from the Operations of the Consortium, except for those related to the obligations
contracted hereunder for the performance by Texpet of the Scope of Work (Annex

The Ecuadorian Government’s “claims” were addressed in Article 5.2. It provides:

“The Government and Petroecuador intend claims to mean any and all claims,
rights to Claims, debts, liens, common or civil law or equitable causes of actions
and penalties, whether sounding in contract or tort, constitutional, statutory, or
regulatory causes of action and penalties (including, but not limited to, causes of
action under Article 19-2 of the Political Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador,
Decree No. 1459 of 1971, Decree No. 925 of 1973, the Water Act, R.O. 233 of 1973,
ORO No. 530 of 1974, Decree No. 374 of 1976, Decree No. 101 of 1982, or Decree
No. 2144 of 1989, or any other applicable law or regulation of the Republic of
Ecuador), costs, lawsuits, settlements and attorneys’ fees (past, present, future,
known or unknown), that the Government or Petroecuador have, or ever may have

against each Releasee for or in any way related to contamination, that have or ever
may arise in the future, directly or indirectly arising out of Operations of the
Consortium, including but not limited to consequences of all types of injury that the
Government or Petroecuador may allege concerning persons, properties, business,
reputations, and all other types of injuries that may be measured in money,
including but not limited to, trespass, nuisance, negligence, strict liability, breach
of warranty, or any other theory or potential theory of recovery.”

The reference in Article 5.2 to Article 19-2 of the Ecuadorian Constitution (being the
1978 Constitution effective in 1979 and, as later amended, in force in 1995) signified a
cause of action available to the Respondent under Title II, Section 1 (On the Rights of
People/Individuals)? whereby the Ecuadorian State guaranteed to each person, inter alia
(in English translation): “... the right to live in an environment that is free from
contamination. It is the duty of the State to ensure that this right is not negatively affected
and to foster the preservation of nature ...”. The reference to Decree No. 374 of 1976
signified a cause of action available to the Respondent on the prevention and control of
pollution. The reference to the Water Act of 1973 and Decree No. 2144 of 1989 signified
causes of action available to the Respondent in regard to water resources and water
contamination. The reference to ORO No 530 signified the Regulations for the

Exploration and Exploration of Hydrocarbons of 9 April 1974.

(ii) The 1996 Municipal and Provincial Releases: As provided by Annex “A” to the
Settlement Agreement, TexPet subsequently settled disputes with the four
municipalities of the Oriente Region (Sushufindi, Francisco de Orellana (Coca), Lago
Agrio and Loya de los Sachas), under written agreements made with these
municipalities, as also the Province of Sucumbios and the Napo consortium of

municipalities (the “1996 Municipal and Provincial Releases”).

Under these six settlements, four of which were approved by the Ecuadorian Courts
owing to their nature as extant litigious disputes, TexPet, together with non-signatory
parties, were released from liability to these municipalities for the Consortium’s
activities in the area of the concession. The 1996 Municipal and Provincial Releases
provided (inter alia) for releases in somewhat different terms from Article 5.1 of the

Settlement Agreement.

? As recorded in the Tribunal’s First Partial Award, the Claimants translate the Spanish term “las personas” as
“people” or “persons”; and the Respondent as “individuals” and “persons”. For present purposes, the difference is
immaterial.

3.31

(iii) The 1998 Final Release: On 30 September 1998, pursuant to the Settlement
Agreement, the Respondent (acting by its Minister of Energy and Mines), PetroEcuador,
PetroProduccion and TexPet executed the “Acta Final” (or Final Release), certifying
that TexPet had performed all its obligations under the 1995 Settlement Agreement and,
in accordance with its terms, releasing TexPet from (as specified) any environmental

liability arising from the Consortium’s operations.
Article IV of the Final Release provided (inter alia) in material part as follows:

“... The Government and PetroEcuador proceed to release, absolve and discharge
TexPet, Texas Petroleum Company, Compaiia Texaco de Petréleos del Ecuador,
S.A., Texaco Inc., and all their respective agents, servants, employees, officers,
directors, legal representatives, insurers, attorneys, indemnitors, guarantors, heirs,
administrators, executors, beneficiaries, successors, predecessors, principals,
subsidiaries forever, from any liability and claims by the Government of the
Republic of Ecuador, PetroEcuador and its Affiliates, for items related to the
obligations assumed by TexPet in the aforementioned Contract [the 1995
Settlement Agreement] ....”

The wording of the release in Article IV of the Final Release is materially the same

linguistically as the wording Article 5.1 of the Settlement Agreement.

3.51 Article 7: Article 7 of the Civil Code provides:

“The law does not provide except for the future; it has no retroactive effect; and
when a later law conflicts with a prior law, the following rules shall be observed:

18. The laws in effect when a contract is executed shall be deemed incorporated
into such contract.

This provision shall not apply to: (1) laws about how to sue for rights resulting from
the contract and (2) laws indicating penalties for a violation of the contractual
provisions, since the violation will be punished in accordance with the law under
which it was committed;

20. Laws concerning the hearing of and procedure in lawsuits shall prevail over
prior laws from the time at which they take effect. But time periods that have already

3.52 Article 18: Article 18 of the Civil Code provides:

“Judges shall not suspend or deny the administration of justice because of the
obscurity or lack of a law. In such cases, they shall adjudicate in accordance with
the following rules:

1. When the meaning of the law is clear, they shall not disregard its literal meaning,
on the pretext of determining the spirit of the law.

However, to interpret an obscure provision of a law, they may indeed resort to its
intent or spirit as clearly manifested in the law itself, or to the trustworthy history
of the law’s establishment;

2. The words in the law shall be understood in their natural and obvious meaning,
in accordance with the general use of the words themselves, but when the legislator
has expressly defined them for certain subjects, the words shall be given their legal
meaning;

3. The technical words from any science or art shall be taken in the meaning given
to them by those practicing the same science or art; unless it clearly appears that
they have been taken to mean something different;

4. The context of a law shall be used to interpret the meaning of each of its parts,
so that the due connection and harmony exists among all of them.

Part III - Page 16

Obscure passages in a law may be illustrated by means of other laws, particularly
if they deal with the same topic;

5. The favorable or odious aspect of a provision shall not be taken into account to
broaden or restrict its interpretation. The scope that shall be given to any law shall
be determined through its genuine meaning and in accordance with the foregoing
rules of interpretation.

6. In cases where the foregoing rules of interpretation cannot be applied, obscure
or contradictory passages shall be interpreted in the manner that is most consistent
with the general spirit of the law and natural fairness; and,

7. If there is no law, the laws governing analogous cases shall be applied, and if
there are no such laws, then the general principles of universal law shall be used.”

PART IV

THE FACTS AND OTHER MATTERS

A: Introduction

In Parts IV, V and VI of this Award, the Tribunal considers the Claimants’ allegations
that several judges of the Lago Agrio Court misconducted and misdecided the Lago
Agrio Litigation, in breach of the protections provided to the Claimants by the Treaty.
The Tribunal considers, in particular, the Claimants’ allegation that Judge Zambrano
did not write the Lago Agrio Judgment of 14 February 2011 (with its Clarification Order
of 4 March 2011); but, rather, that the Lago Agrio Judgment was ‘ghostwritten’, with
Judge Zambrano’s corrupt connivance, by certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’
representatives.! In addition, the Tribunal considers the Claimants’ allegations that the
Respondent’s Government improperly intervened in the Lago Agrio Litigation, also in

breach of the protections provided to the Claimants by the Treaty.
These allegations are denied by the Respondent.

In this Part IV, as already indicated, the Tribunal addresses the evidence relevant to the
issues regarding the alleged judicial misconduct, improper intervention by the
Government and the ‘ghostwriting’ of the Lago Agrio Judgment. In Part V, the Tribunal
addresses specific aspects of the Lago Agrio Judgment of 14 February 2011, the Lago
Agrio Appellate Judgment of 3 January 2012,? the Cassation Court Judgment of 12
November 2013 and the Constitutional Court Judgment of 27 June 2018.4 In Part VI,
the Tribunal considers separately the forensic computer evidence adduced by the
Parties’ forensic expert witnesses in support of their respective cases as to the
‘ghostwriting’ of the Lago Agrio Judgment, including earlier orders issued by Judge

Zambrano.

As regards the factual issues (including the expert and forensic issues), the Claimants

bear the legal burden of proving the facts upon which they rely to support their claims,

"C931, C-1367 & R-1193.

2 C-991 (see also the Clarification Order of 13 January 2012, C-2314).

under Article 24(1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.> Whilst the evidential burden
may shift from one side to the other depending on the evidence, it remains always for

the Claimants to prove their positive case.

The Tribunal emphasises, at the outset, that the focus of its inquiry is the conduct of the
Respondent acting through its judicial branch, in the form of the Lago Agrio Court, the
Lago Agrio Appellate Court, the Cassation Court and the Constitutional Court, and
through its executive branch. To that inquiry, the conduct of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’
representatives is incidental, albeit relevant as part of the factual background to the

conduct of the Respondent’s Courts and Government.

Accordingly, the Tribunal does not rely upon the judgments of the New York Courts in
the RICO Litigation, to which the Respondent was not a party and which bore no legal
relationship to the Treaty on which the Tribunal must rest its jurisdiction and apply, as
the applicable law, international law to the Parties’ dispute in this arbitration under the

Treaty.
B: Evidential Sources

The evidence of relevant factual materials is extensive, complicated and much disputed,
taking place over several decades. The Tribunal has preferred to rely, where it can, upon
contemporary written materials, rather than upon the unsupported oral testimony of
certain witnesses who testified before this Tribunal and elsewhere. However, even this
explanation is incomplete, particularly as regards three individuals: (i) Dr Zambrano;
(ii) Mr Steven Donziger; (ii) certain of the Lago Agrio’s other representatives in

Ecuador and the USA; and (iv) Dr Alberta Guerra Bastidas.

(1) Dr Zambrano: Judge Zambrano issued procedural orders in the Lago Agrio
Litigation during his two periods presiding over the Lago Agrio Litigation: (i) from
October 2009 to March 2010 and (ii) from October 2010 to March 2011. He also
delivered the Lago Agrio Judgment and its Clarification on 14 February and 4 March
2011 respectively.°

4.13.

At the procedural meeting held with the Parties on 21 January 2014, the Tribunal
indicated its concern to the Parties that very serious allegations were being made in this
arbitration against Dr Zambrano (by then no longer a judge) in circumstances where he
might not be called as a witness by any of the Parties. In that event, Dr Zambrano would
not be afforded an opportunity to appear before the Tribunal, so as to testify in response
to the allegations made against him as the Judge presiding over the Lago Agrio
Litigation, first, from October 2009 to March 2010 and, second, from 11 October 2010
to 4 March 2011. In those circumstances the Tribunal stated that it would be appropriate
for the Tribunal itself to extend an invitation to Dr Zambrano to attend, as a factual
witness, the hearing then scheduled to take place at the World Bank in Washington D.C.,
USA from 21 April to 8 May 2015 (“the Track IT Hearing”).

On 8 December 2014, the Claimants indicated that they wished to question
Dr Zambrano at the Track II Hearing and asked whether “Ecuador would facilitate and
ensure the appearance of Mr Zambrano at the hearing...”. By the Claimants’ subsequent
list of witnesses contained in their letter dated 20 March 2015, the Claimants again
confirmed their wish to question Dr Zambrano as a factual witness at the Track II
Hearing. It was self-evident that the Claimants were not themselves in a position to call
Dr Zambrano (being resident in Ecuador) as a witness at the Track II Hearing in the

USA.

By letter dated 11 December 2014, the Office of the Attorney-General of Ecuador
informed Dr Zambrano of: (i) the Tribunal’s invitation to him to attend the Track II
Hearing to address the allegations made against him and (ii) the Claimants’ wish to
question him during that Hearing. The Tribunal is satisfied that this information did

reach Dr Zambrano personally; but there was no response from him to the Tribunal.

On 10 January 2015, the Office of the Attorney General of Ecuador sent a further letter
repeating the Tribunal’s invitation. The Tribunal is satisfied that this information also
reached Dr Zambrano personally; but there was again no response from him to the

Tribunal.

By letter to the Tribunal dated 28 January 2015, the Respondent stated that Dr Zambrano
was not under the control of the Respondent; that he was a part-time consultant for an

Ecuadorian company (in Ecuador) in which the Government of Ecuador had an

Part IV — Page 3

4.14.

4.15.

4.16.

4.17.

ownership interest; but that neither the Office of the Attorney General nor the

Respondent’s outside counsel had any relations with Dr Zambrano.

The Claimants, by letter to the Tribunal dated 9 February 2015, contended that
Dr Zambrano was under the Respondent’s control and that the Respondent had the
power to cause Dr Zambrano to appear at the Track II Hearing as a witness. The
Claimants requested the Tribunal to draw adverse inferences against the Respondent in

the event that Dr Zambrano should not give evidence at the Track II Hearing.

At the procedural meeting held with the Parties on 10 March 2015, the Tribunal noted
that, in light of the judgment (then under appeal) of the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York in Chevron Corporation v Stephen Donziger (the
“RICO Litigation” in New York),’ it might be thought awkward for Dr Zambrano to
attend the Track II Hearing in person in the USA. If so, the Tribunal was therefore
minded, as a less preferred alternative, to invite Dr Zambrano to give evidence by video-
link from Ecuador. The Parties’ counsel indicated that they would need to take
instructions from their respective clients on this proposal. The Claimants also noted that
their immediate reaction was that it would not be possible to conduct a full cross-
examination by video-link, not least because it would be necessary to provide Dr
Zambrano with copies of all relevant documents on which the Claimants might wish to

question him.

The Tribunal understood at this time that, without more, Dr Zambrano would not be a

witness at the Track II Hearing.

In these circumstances, the Tribunal re-stated to the Parties its wish to hear
Dr Zambrano’s factual testimony, it at all possible. For that purpose, the Tribunal
confirmed its invitation to Dr Zambrano as a witness to attend the Track II Hearing in
person or, if that was not possible, to participate by video link from Ecuador. The
Tribunal considered that, as a matter of basic fairness, Dr Zambrano should be given a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the Track II Hearing as a witness (subject to
questioning by the Parties and the Tribunal), so as to respond to the allegations made

against him in this arbitration.

7 C-2135 and C-2136 (the “RICO Judgment”).

Part IV — Page 4

4.18.

4.19.

4.20.

The Tribunal therefore decided, as recorded in its Procedural Order No. 33 of 27 March
2015, that the Tribunal would invite Dr Zambrano itself, directly, to attend the Track II
Hearing as a factual witness either (preferably) in person at the World Bank in
Washington DC, USA or (in the less preferred alternative) via video-link from Ecuador
from an appropriate place convenient for Dr Zambrano and the PCA. A draft of the
Tribunal’s proposed letter to Dr Zambrano to this effect was attached as Annex A to this
Procedural Order, in Spanish and English translation, as to which the Parties’ comments

were invited.

The Tribunal also decided that: Dr Zambrano should be free to accept or refuse the
Tribunal’s invitation, as he wished, without any interference from the Parties; in the
event that Dr Zambrano accepted the Tribunal’s invitation to testify, the Parties should
do everything in their power to facilitate his participation as a factual witness during the
Track II Hearing; the reasonable costs of Dr Zambrano’s participation, whether it be in
person or by video-link, should be paid by the PCA out of the Parties’ deposits held by
the PCA; and the date(s) and format of Dr Zambrano’s participation during the Track II
Hearing would be specified later by the Tribunal, following consultations with Dr

Zambrano and the Parties.

In the event that Dr Zambrano decided to attend the Track II Hearing via video-link
only, the Tribunal decided that: the Parties should by a date to be specified later by the
Tribunal (following further consultation with the Parties) compile an electronic file
containing copies of any documents on which they wished to question Dr Zambrano and
transmit that file to the PCA; a representative of the PCA would travel to Ecuador in
order to provide Dr Zambrano with copies of the documents so identified and to provide
any assistance to Dr Zambrano that he might require during the video conference; the
Parties and the Tribunal could question Dr Zambrano during the video conference from
the Hearing at the World Bank; no representative of any Party should be present with
Dr Zambrano in Ecuador; the PCA would liaise directly with Dr Zambrano in relation
to the location and other arrangements for the video conference and would ensure that
all necessary logistical arrangements were in place; and the Tribunal would make a
further procedural order following consultations with the Parties to regulate the

procedure for the video conference.

4.21. By letter dated 1 April 2015, at the Tribunal’s direction, the PCA sent the following
letter to Dr Zambrano, enclosing the Tribunal’s written invitation to testify as a witness

at the Track II Hearing, in Spanish (Dr Zambrano does not know English):

° In English: “Dear Dr Zambrano, As you will be aware, Chevron Corporation and Texaco Petroleum Company
(the “Claimants” ) have commenced an international arbitration before the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The
Hague (the “PCA”) under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules against the State of Ecuador as the Respondent,
pursuant to a Treaty between Ecuador and the United States of America (the “Treaty”). We write to you as the
Arbitration Tribunal appointed under the Treaty to decide the dispute between the Claimants and the Respondent.
In this arbitration, the Claimants allege that the Respondent breached its obligations under international law by,
inter alia, the actions and omissions of the Respondent's judicial branch during the Lago Agrio Litigation. The
Respondent denies the Claimants’ allegations and also objects to the jurisdictional basis for the Claimants’ claims
under the Treaty. There is to be an oral hearing in this arbitration to take place with the Claimants and the
Respondent at the World Bank in Washington DC, USA from 21 April to 8 May 2015. The Arbitral Tribunal would
wish to hear your factual testimony, it at all possible. For that purpose the Tribunal invites you as a witness to
attend this hearing or, if that is not possible, to participate by video link. In the event of your accepting this
invitation, the PCA will make further arrangements for your participation, including provision for your reasonable
expenses. This invitation is made by the Arbitration Tribunal with the support of both the Claimants and the
Respondent. We look forward to your early response, but no later than 7 April 2015. Yours etc.”.

At the procedural meeting held with the Parties on 8 April 2015, the Tribunal reported
that the above correspondence had been delivered to Dr Zambrano in Manta, Ecuador,
as confirmed by the courier’s receipt signed for Dr Zambrano on 7 April 2015.'° The
Tribunal is satisfied that this correspondence reached Dr Zambrano personally; but there

was again no response from him to the Tribunal.

The Tribunal regrets that Dr Zambrano did not testify before this Tribunal. The Tribunal
recognises, however, that it was his right to choose not to do so. Further, on the materials
available in this arbitration, the Tribunal accepts, as submitted by the Respondent, that
his choice was not induced by the Respondent. In these circumstances, the Tribunal does
not think it appropriate to draw any adverse inference against the Respondent, as

requested by the Claimants, for Dr Zambrano’s absence as a witness in this arbitration.

Dr Zambrano did testify, on oath, in the RICO Litigation, before the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York (Judge Kaplan). His testimony, in
the form of a statement, deposition and trial testimony, is available to this Tribunal as
evidence by agreement of the Parties (as submitted by the Parties with their respective

written pleadings).'! The Tribunal has made extensive use of it.

(2) Mr Donziger: Mr Steven Donziger is not an Ecuadorian lawyer or a citizen of
Ecuador; nor is he to be regarded as an agent (or organ) of the Respondent for the
purpose of attribution under international law. He is a citizen of the USA, resident in
New York and a member of the New York Bar (currently suspended). For many years,
since at least 1993, he acted as a representative of the Aguinda Plaintiffs first in the
Aguinda Litigation in New York and, subsequently, of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs in the
Lago Agrio Litigation in Ecuador. He is Spanish-speaking.

The Tribunal would have wished to hear Mr Donziger testify personally in this
arbitration. Mr Donziger was an important actor in the Lago Agrio Litigation leading up
to the Lago Agrio Judgment and Clarification Order. However, it soon became apparent
to the Tribunal that Mr Donziger would not be called as a witness by any Party to this
arbitration. Nor was he. Moreover, as the principal defendant in the RICO Litigation

brought by Chevron in New York, Mr Donziger clearly had other more pressing

personal priorities than assisting this Tribunal as a witness. It was therefore pointless for
the Tribunal itself to extend an invitation to him to testify at the Track II Hearing.
Further, Mr Donziger was afforded a full opportunity to defend himself against
Chevron’s allegations of ‘ghostwriting’ and other improper conduct in the

RICO Litigation.

Mr Donziger did testify at length, on oath, in the RICO Litigation in New York. His
testimony, in the form of depositions and trial testimony, is available to this Tribunal
with the Parties’ agreement (also, as submitted by the Parties with their respective
written pleadings).'2 As with Dr Zambrano’s testimony, the Tribunal has made

extensive use of it.'>

The Tribunal has also made extensive use of Mr Donziger’s personal notebook (or
“diary”). This was originally a private document written by Mr Donziger for his own
personal use only. It was disclosed by Mr Donziger to Chevron under court orders in
the US Section 1782 and RICO Litigation brought by Chevron against Mr Donziger,
along with his private email correspondence and computer hard drives. As a resident of
New York, Mr Donziger was (and remains) subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of

the USA.

The Tribunal has made use of Mr Donziger’s diary and emails with caution. What is
written in a private diary and also in private emails to close colleagues cannot always
be taken literally by third persons, long after the event. In the Tribunal’s view, even the
starkest statement has to be assessed in context and in the light of other circumstances

prevailing at the time.

There is a further qualification. By October 2010, Mr Donziger’s emails and computers
in the USA had been seized by Chevron under orders from US Courts. Thereafter, if not
months before, the form and content of communications between Mr Donziger in New

York and his colleagues in Ecuador doubtless underwent a precautionary change.

2 Again, see the Tribunal’s Procedural Order 45, para 5, and the Respondent’s email message dated 31 August
2016 to the Tribunal.

'3 The Tribunal has not made use of the full materials in the RICO Litigation, said to be 3,750 exhibits totaling
more than 82,800 pages, a 2,970 page transcript of the trial, 1,033 pages of written direct testimony and 7,340
pages of depositions. The Respondent recorded an objection to the Claimants’ late submission of these full
materials, which was accepted by the Tribunal.

Part IV - Page 9

4.32.

4.33.

4.34.

Even earlier, in his email to Mr Donziger of 30 March 2010, Mr Prieto (one of the Lago
Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives in Ecuador) had already expressed grave concerns
about ‘going to jail’ because of email disclosures to Chevron likely to be ordered by the
US Courts in the US Section 1782 Litigation (see the chronology below). Even before
any court orders for such disclosure, certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives
had resorted to using code-words in their email messages to each other (see also the
chronology below). It follows that the content of certain emails from at least October
2010 onwards is likely to have been tailored by certain of these representatives, if email

was used by them for certain purposes at all.

As regards both Mr Donziger and other representatives of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs, the
Tribunal has made extensive use of the offcuts from the documentary film “Crude”.
These offcuts were never intended to be made public. As described further below, these
offcuts (totalling about 600 hours of video film) were disclosed to Chevron under court
orders in the US Section 1782 Litigation brought by Chevron against the film’s director,

Mr Joseph Berlinger. '+

(3) The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ Representatives: The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’
representatives and legal advisers, at different times, included Mr Norman Alberto Wray
(a senior Ecuadorian lawyer and former judge of the Ecuadorian Supreme Court), Mr
Cristébal Bonifaz (of Amherst, MA, USA), Mr Pablo Fajardo Mendoza (from 2005),
Mr Juan Pablo Saenz, Mr Julio Prieto Méndez, Mr Alejandro Ponce Villacis, Mr Luis
Yanza (a director of the “Frente de Defensa La Amazonia” or “Frente” and, in English,
the “Amazon Defence Front” or “ADF”), Mr Icoca Manuel Tegautal, Mr Joseph Kohn
(of Kohn, Swift & Graf, Philadelphia, PA, USA); Patton Boggs (a law firm in
Washington DC, USA from about August 2010) and, as already indicated, Mr Donziger.
The funding for such legal representation came principally from Mr Kohn (until 2010),
Mr Russell DeLeon,'> Patton Boggs and (from 2010) Burford Capital, in return for
success fees calculated on recoveries from Chevron upon the eventual enforcement of
the Lago Agrio Judgment. Other non-party funders appear to have become involved in

the Lago Agrio Judgment’s enforcement proceedings outside Ecuador.

4 €.649, C-359.
'S Mr Deleon also partly financed the making of the documentary film “Crude” directed by Mr Joseph Berlinger.

4.37.

4.38.

As regards the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives in Ecuador, especially Mr Fajardo,
Mr Séenz, Mr Prieto and Mr Yanza,'° there is little evidence in this arbitration of what
they said and did other than what is recorded in the “Crude” off-cuts and their written
communications to and from Mr Donziger, as disclosed to Chevron in the US 1782 and
RICO Litigation. Details of several significant events and relevant materials within
Ecuador are therefore missing from the evidence adduced by the Parties in this
arbitration. None of these individuals gave evidence in the RICO Litigation; they are
not subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of the USA; and it was not in the power of
this Tribunal or the Parties to compel their attendance as witnesses in these arbitration
proceedings. Amongst this group, the leading figure in the Lago Agrio Litigation was
Mr Fajardo, an Ecuadorian lawyer of conspicuous ability and industry who worked

closely with Mr Donziger.

(4) Dr Guerra: Dr Alberto Guerra Bastidas testified under oath at the Track II Hearing,
called by the Claimants, cross-examined by the Respondent and questioned by the

Tribunal. '7

The Respondent strongly impugned his credibility as a witness. Dr Guerra
also testified under oath in the RICO Litigation and at the RICO trial in New York,
where he was deposed and also cross-examined. '* Dr Guerra’s testimony in the form of
his several written witness statements, depositions and oral testimony was adduced by

the Claimants in this arbitration.

In the Tribunal’s view, particular caution is required in assessing Dr Guerra’s testimony.
In the past, Dr Guerra has conducted himself with less than probity. For the present,
whilst the Claimants have taken steps to protect the integrity of his testimony (in this
and other related legal proceedings), there exists still a risk that Dr Guerra could colour

his testimony to favour the Claimants as his benefactors during his exile from Ecuador.

Yet, whatever happened in the past and however great that incentive might be, having
seen and heard him in person subject to vigorous cross-examination by the Respondent,

the Tribunal considers that Dr Guerra was a witness of truth in his testimony at the Track

‘6 These and other individuals are described in the Selected Dramatis Personae above at page xiii.

"” Track I Hearing D3.593-758; D4.852-900. Dr Guerra was also deposed by the Respondent in this arbitration
on 5 November 2013, R-907. He testified at the RICO trial on 23-25 October 2013 (C-1978).

'8 Dr Guerra’s written testimony before the Track II Hearing comprises his declaration of 17 November 2012, C-
16 16a; his first supplemental declaration of 13 January 2013, C-1648; his second supplemental declaration of 11
April 2013, R-1331 & C-1828; his witness statement of 9 October 2013, C-2358 & C-2386; and his RICO
deposition of 2 May 2013, R-906 and C-1888.

4.39.

II Hearing. The Tribunal has therefore relied upon his testimony where it can be
corroborated by other evidence, at least in part. The Tribunal also notes that, in one
material respect regarding the conduct of Respondent’s executive branch towards the
Lago Agrio Litigation, Dr Guerra gave evidence at the Track II Hearing that

unequivocally supported the Respondent’s case (to which the Tribunal returns below).
C: Ecuador’s Oriente and its Inhabitants

The Oriente area of Ecuador is situated in the eastern part of the country, within the
Amazon basin, bordering on Columbia (to the north) and Peru (to the south). In
describing the Oriente and its inhabitants, the Tribunal can do no better than to cite the
work of Professor Kimerling and her colleagues in Amazon Crude, written more than

25 years ago (with footnotes here omitted): !°

“The tropical forests of the Oriente are among the most biologically diverse natural
ecosystems on earth - a treasure trove of rare and unique species and a potential
source of medicines, fruits, nuts, and other forest foods and products. Ecuador’s
ancient rain forests lie at the headwaters of the Amazon River system and help
control flooding and erosion, even in the river’s lower reaches. The Oriente’s
forests also help regulate the region’s rainfall and climate. The forest is a
storehouse of carbon. When it is burned or cleared, carbon dioxide is released into
the atmosphere, heightening the potential for global warming. The rain forests of
the Oriente are also home to the region’s indigenous peoples who depend on the
forest for their livelihoods. Without the forest, Amazonian peoples would be
threatened with cultural and, in some cases, physical extinction ...”.

  

“Ecuador’s Oriente has a rich heritage of indigenous cultures and is home to eight
groups of indigenous people. Estimates of the Oriente’s indigenous population
range from 90,000 to 250,000 — 25 to 50 percent [of] the region’s total population.
Two groups, the Quichua and the Shuar, together account for the great majority of
indigenous people in the Oriente. The balance of the population is found among the
Achuar, Cofan, Huaorani, Shiwiar, Secoya, and Siona. The Huaorani number
roughly 1,580 individuals, the Shiwiar some 600, and together the Secoya and
Siona number about 350. The Cofan population, once 15,000, is now approximately
300 [citation omitted].”

“Indigenous peoples have lived in Amazonia for thousands of years in harmony
with their rain forest environment. Since the Spanish arrived in Ecuador nearly 500
years ago, the Oriente has been a magnet for fortune-seekers and missionaries.
Spanish adventurers first entered upper Amazonia in what is now Ecuador, and the
first mission bases were established there in the sixteenth century. It was not until
the rubber extraction boom began in the late 1800s, however, that dreams of easy
wealth first came true in Amazonia. A handful of ‘rubber barons’ became rich, but

at great expense to the people. Their atrocities throughout Amazonia are well-
documented. Thousands of indigenous people in Ecuador, Peru, and Colombia
were killed [citation omitted]. The boom ended in the early 1900s, when rubber
seeds were smuggled out of Brazil and successfully cultivated on plantations in
Malaysia.”

This case concerns only a part of Ecuador’s Oriente, a former concession area in the
north-east close to the Colombian border, near the town of Lago Agrio in the Province

of Sucumbios (see the map in Annex 6 to this Part IV below).
D: Ecuador’s Government and Judiciary

(1) The Ecuadorian Government: From 1964 onwards, Ecuador had a succession of
governments of different political and economic persuasions. In February 1964, when
the 1964 Concession Agreement was executed, Ecuador was governed by a military
junta. It was succeeded by another military junta. In 1969, President José Ibarra became
the President of Ecuador. In 1972, a military junta took power in Ecuador under General
Guillermo Rodriguez Lara. During this régime, the 1973 Concession Agreement was

executed.

In 1979, President Jaime Roldés Aguilera took office as the President of Ecuador,
succeeded (on President Roldés’ death) by President Osvaldo Hurtado Larrea in 1981.
In 1984, President Leén Febres Cordero Rivadeneira took office as President of
Ecuador, followed in 1988 by President Rodrigo Borja Cevallo and in 1992 by President
Sixto Duran Ballén. During this régime, the Aguinda Litigation was commenced in New
York in 1993; and the 1995 Settlement Agreement was executed, as also the 1995

Remedial Action Plan.

In 1996, President Abdalé Bucaram took office as President of Ecuador, later (in
February 1997) removed from office by the Congress and succeeded by an interim
presidency, that included President Fabian Alarcon. In 1998, President Jamil Mahuad
took office as the President of Ecuador, later forced into exile by a military coup in

January 2000. During these régimes, the 1998 Final Release was executed.

In 2002, President Lucio Gutiérrez took office as the President of Ecuador, but was later
removed from office by the Congress in 2005 and succeeded by an interim presidency
under President Alfredo Palacio. During the early part of this régime, the Lago Agrio

Litigation was commenced in Ecuador in 2003.

Part IV — Page 13

4.45.

4.46.

4.47.

4.48.

4.49.

In January 2007, President Rafael Correa took office as the President of Ecuador, being
re-elected in 2009 and 2013. During this régime, the Lago Agrio Court, the Lago Agrio
Appellate Court and the Cassation Court issued their respective judgments in 2011, 2012
and 2013 respectively. President Correa had left office (in 2017) at the time of the
Constitutional Court’s Judgment (2018).

Until recently, at least, Ecuador was a country marked by political, economic and

institutional instability that began long before President Correa’s election in 2007.

The Claimants’ case, as regards the Respondent’s executive branch, is directed
principally at President Correa and his political administration during the period from

2007 onwards, during the pendency of the Lago Agrio Litigation.

(2) The Ecuadorian Judiciary: The relevant court in the Oriente, the Sucumbios
Provincial Court of Justice of Nueva Loja in Lago Agrio (the “Lago Agrio Court”),
operated on a meagre budget under a swift succession of presiding judges responsible
for the Lago Agrio Litigation. It was not designed for and had never previously
experienced any case of the size, duration, complexity and controversy comparable to
the Lago Agrio Litigation. At the Track II Hearing, the Respondent’s Counsel stated
that the Lago Agrio Litigation grew to become 2,000 times the size of the typical

Ecuadorian lawsuit.”

The Lago Agrio Litigation was heard by the Lago Agrio Court before a succession of
Lago Agrio Judges between May 2003 and March 2011, a period of almost eight years;
namely: (i) Judge Guerra (13 May 2003 — 3 February 2004), (ii) Judge Novillo (4
February 2004 — 1 February 2006), (iii) Judge Yanez (2 February 2006 — 2 October
2007), (iv) Judge Novillo, again (3 October 2007 — 24 August 2008), (v) Judge Nuifiez
(25 August 2008 — 20 October 2009), (vi) Judge Zambrano (21 October 2009 — 11
March 2010), (vii) Judge Ord6fiez (12 March 2010 — 10 October 2010) and lastly (viii),
Judge Zambrano, again (11 October 2010 — 29 February 2011). It was Judge Zambrano
who issued the Lago Agrio Judgment and its Clarifying Order on 14 February 2011 and
4 March 2011 respectively.

4.53.

Judges Nufiez and Judge Ord6fiez were recused as judges in the Lago Agrio Litigation,
respectively in August 2009 and October 2010. Unconnected with the Lago Agrio
Litigation, Judge Guerra was dismissed from the Ecuadorian judiciary in May 2008. In
2012, also unconnected with the Lago Agrio Litigation, one year after the Lago Agrio

Judgment, Judge Zambrano was also dismissed from the Ecuadorian judiciary.

The Claimants’ case, as regards the Ecuadorian judiciary, is directed principally at Judge
Zambrano during the two periods when he presided over the Lago Agrio Litigation,

from (i) October 2009 to March 2010 and (ii) October 2010 to March 2011.

It is necessary to note that the Lago Agrio Court operated on limited resources. From
his time as a judge of the Lago Agrio Court, Dr Guerra gave, as an example, the fact
that even court seals had to be procured by the judge or clerk using their own money.?!
The Tribunal also notes that Judge Zambrano had personally to arrange for a temporary
student secretary, ostensibly at his own immediate expense, whilst presiding over the

Lago Agrio Litigation. He had no law clerk or legal assistant.

More generally, the Tribunal also refers to part of the statement made by the
Respondent’s Attorney-General at the Jurisdictional Hearing, as recorded in its Third

Interim Award. There, the Attorney-General stated (as translated into English):?”

“|. As a first point, I would like to talk about the present justice system in Ecuador.
In the year 2008, the latest Constitutional Assembly in Ecuador as an expression of
sovereign expression of the Ecuadorian nation approved the new Constitution that
rules our country at the moment ...

In terms of the justice administration, the new Constitution consolidated previous
efforts of the judicial reform of Nineties. Although still we are not in the position
that we would like to be, we are achieving important progress in this ambit. First
of all, we have to concentrate the existence of Courts and other Tribunals to
marginal places allowing better access to justice. [Secondly,] There is an
improvement in justice efficiency in relation to the number of cases that are
resolved. Thirdly, we have achieved greater transparency and publicity in terms of
the activities of the judiciary; and, fourthly, we have developed norms that rules

In this way, in our system of justice is an improvement. There is advancement. We
continuously improve trying to achieve high standards, standards of efficiency for
the benefit of the Ecuadorian society.

... Laccepted my designation, and I have done my job as Procurador of the State of
the Republic of Ecuador convinced and respectful of the autonomy of the functions
of the State because I am convinced of the independency of the justice system of my
country and the process of change. But by the same token I am very conscious of
the difficult problems affecting our systems still. We still have delays in processes
in front of our courts. We have complaints against dishonest Courts, and we have
problems of salaries for judges and magistrates and lawyers. But I am conscious of
our problems.

... We know our deficiencies, but we are working to correct them.”

There was another factor especially relevant to Judge Zambrano: Judge Zambrano was

not experienced in handling and deciding civil cases, let alone large and complex cases.
E: The 1964 and 1973 Concessions

On 21 February 1964, the Respondent granted oil exploration and production rights in
Ecuador’s Oriente region to TexPet (a subsidiary of Texaco) and the Ecuadorian Gulf
Oil Company (a subsidiary of Gulf) under a written concession made with these
companies’ local subsidiaries operating as a Consortium (“the 1964 Concession
Agreement).”> TexPet was the “Operator” for the Consortium under the Texaco-Gulf

Joint Operating Agreement of | January 1965.74

In 1967, the Consortium discovered significant deposits of crude oil in the Oriente and
drilled its first wells. By 1969, the Consortium had found considerable reserves of crude

oil.

By 1972, the Consortium had developed nine oil fields and constructed an oil pipeline

over the Andes to the Pacific coast (the “SOTE” pipeline).

On 6 August 1973, the Respondent, TexPet and Gulf entered into a further concession
agreement with a term expiring on 6 June 1992 (“the 1973 Concession Agreement”).”°

It was also agreed (inter alia) to grant an option to acquire an interest in the Consortium

to the Ecuadorian State Oil Corporation, CEPE (abbreviated from Corporacion Estatal

Petrolera Ecuatoriana, later succeeded by PetroEcuador).”°

The 1973 Concession Agreement imposed environmental and related obligations on the
Contractors (TexPet and Gulf) and the Operator (TexPet). Pursuant to Section 46.1
(Preservation of Natural Resources), the Contractors “shall adopt all convenient
measures for the preservation of the flora, fauna and other natural resources, and they
all [shall] also refrain from polluting water courses, the atmosphere and the soil, under
supervision of the relevant Government agencies.” Section 51.1 provided: “Upon
termination of this contract as a result of the expiration of its term ..., the contractors
shall deliver to CEPE, for no consideration and in good production conditions, all the
commercially exploitable hydrocarbon reserves, any wells in activity at that moment,
... and any other real and personal property that [they] acquired in connection with this
contract, provided that all such property shall be in good condition.” Section 40.1
provided: “The contractors shall use modern and efficient machinery, and they shall use
the most adequate technology and methods in their activities so as to obtain the highest
productivity in the exploitation of deposits, observing at all times the reserve

preservation policy laid out by the Government...”

In 1974, CEPE (PetroEcuador) exercised its option under the 1973 Concession
Agreement, thereby acquiring a 25% stake in the Consortium.?’ TexPet and Gulf each

retained a 37.5% interest in the Consortium.

On 21 December 1976: CEPE (PetroEcuador) acquired Gulf’s remaining interest,
thereby owning a 62.5% interest in the Consortium. (TexPet retained its 37.5% minority

interest until the Consortium ended in 1992).?8

On 30 June 1990, TexPet ceased to act as the “Operator” under the 1973 Concession
Agreement, after 25 years (1965 to 1990). From 1 July 1990 onwards, PetroEcuador (by
its subsidiary, Petroamazonas) became the “Operator” under the 1973 Concession

Agreement.” TexPet, as an Operator, left the Oriente in 1990.

On 6 June 1992, the term of the 1973 Concession Agreement expired. TexPet, as a
Contractor, left Ecuador. There was then no longer any presence by TexPet in the
concession area or Ecuador in any capacity. Texaco (TexPet’s parent company) was
itself never active in the concession area. Nor was Chevron at any time, before or after
1992, engaged in activities in the concession area. (Chevron only became TexPet’s
ultimate parent some ten years later, after the “merger” between Texaco and Chevron

in 2001).

As at 1992, the Consortium with, as Operator TexPet (from 1965 to 1990) and
CEPE/PetroEcuador (from 1990 to 1992), had developed within the concession area
16 production fields, with 321 wells, 18 production stations, 6 base camps and hundreds
of miles of associated pipelines, together with the SOTE pipeline over the Andes. The
Consortium’s activities had generated about US$ 23.3 billion in revenues, of which
about US$ 22.67 billion (97.3%) was received by the Respondent in the form of income
taxes, royalties, contribution for domestic consumption and gross profit on
PetroEcuador’s share in the Consortium.” TexPet itself had received about US$ 480
million in revenues.*! The Consortium had helped to make Ecuador the second largest
oil exporter in Latin America (after Venezuela), doubling Ecuador’s per capita GDP,

but making its national budget heavily dependent on oil revenues.

From 1992 to 2008, after TexPet’s departure from Ecuador, PetroEcuador’s subsequent
operations in the area of the former concession in the Oriente generated about 1.2 billion

barrels of crude oil, representing a market value of about US$ 57 billion.*?

The 1995 Settlement Agreement,” the 1995 Remedial Action Plan*™4 and the 1998 Final
Release*> addressed environmental issues arising from the 1964 and 1973 Concession
Agreements. The Settlement Agreement was signed for TexPet by its Vice-President,
Mr Ricardo Reis Veiga and by its legal representative, Dr Rodrigo Pérez Pallares. The
1995 Remedial Action Plan was signed for TexPet by Mr Veiga. The 1998 Final Release
was signed for TexPet by Mr Veiga and Dr Pérez.

* Thes

 

To perform the remediation work for environmental damage under the 1995 Settlement
Agreement, TexPet selected Woodward-Clyde, a well-known engineering firm
specialising in environmental remediation. Woodward-Clyde prepared the Remedial
Action Plan in accordance with the 1995 Settlement Agreement. The Plan identified the
specific pits at each site that required remediation and the remedial action to be taken at
each site. In September 1995, the Respondent, PetroEcuador, TexPet and Woodward-
Clyde approved the Remedial Action Plan. Between October 1995 and September 1998,
Woodward-Clyde conducted the remediation required by the 1995 Settlement

Agreement and the 1995 Remedial Action Plan (at TexPet’s expense).

In all, TexPet spent approximately US$ 40 million on environmental remediation and
community development in Ecuador under the 1995 Settlement Agreement and the

Remedial Action Plan (together with the 1996 Municipal and Provincial Releases).

On 30 September 1998, the Respondent, PetroEcuador and TexPet signed the Final
Release (the “Acta Final”), certifying that TexPet had performed all its obligations under

the 1995 Settlement Agreement.

In its Third Interim Award, First Partial Award and Decision in this arbitration, the
Tribunal has already considered at some length and made certain decisions upon the
meaning and effect of the 1995 Settlement Agreement. It is unnecessary to repeat those
decisions here, which remain in effect (see Annex | to Part 1 for the Operative Parts of

the Third Interim Award, First Partial Award and Decision).
F: Crude Oil Pollution in the Oriente

There is today crude oil pollution in the former concession area of the Oriente, including
pollution lying close to human habitation. The Tribunal has seen such pollution, albeit
only briefly during its site-visit to four sites in the former concession area in June 2015.*°
More significantly, the fact of such pollution has never been denied by the Claimants
themselves. Rather, the technical and legal issues concern the nature, effect, timing and
cause of such pollution, including the role played by PetroEcuador (both before and,

particularly, after TexPet’s departure from the concession area as Operator in 1990).

sites were: (i) Shushufindi Field: SSF-34 Well Site; (ii) Aguarico Field: AG-06 Well Site; (iii) Shushufindi

Field: SSF-55 Well Site; and (iv) Lago Agrio Field: LA-02 Well Site. The Parties’ presentations at each site were
recorded by verbatim transcript and film. (This film is kept by the PCA, by order of the Tribunal).

Part IV - Page 19

4.74.

The origin of such crude oil pollution, apart from accidental leaks and spills, derives
principally from a mixture of oil and “produced water” in pits, subject to run-off into
adjoining land and water courses. It was described by the Respondent (with its expert
Dr Garvey) as follows during the Tribunal’s site-visit to the SSF-34 Well Site (The site
was originally drilled in 1973 and “shut in”, or abandoned, by TexPet in 1983; it then
comprised a plugged well and three pits; and, where cleared of encroaching jungle, the

land is currently used for subsistence farming, with chocolate cacao plants and natural

papaya trees):*”

“When TexPet came and drilled oil, they set up their oil rig here where the hole in
the ground is; and to get to the oil it’s approximately 3,000 meters deep. So 9 to
10,000 feet is where the oil-producing layers are in this area. To drill down that
far, there’s a significant amount of rock and dirt that came out of the hole; and they
had to have some place to put that. These are called cuttings pits or reserve pits.
And this large pit over here to the side probably started off as a cuttings and reserve
pit, so the debris would [be] placed immediately to the side of the well. When you’re
drilling a well, to get the debris to come out, you have to force drilling mud, which
is a sort of a thick mud that, as you push it down, it pushes the rocks and the debris
out; and to make drilling mud, you need a significant amount of water ... After the
well was drilled and they reached the oil layers, this pit and these reserve pits would
often end up filled with oil ...”

“\.. In order for us to find oil present to the surface, the reservoir that’s supplying
this oil has to be quite large because it has to have been insulated from weathering
for 30 years. How was it insulated? ... We have leaf litter falling on top of the pit.
It prevents oxygen from penetrating into the underground; and, as a result, the oil
here is effectively capped temporarily by this leaf litter and prevented from
weathering. What does that mean? Well, it means that a small disturbance ... that
a farmer might make would very quickly release the oil back to the surface here.
Additionally, a large change in the water table ... could also push the oil upward
above it. This may, in fact, be the reason we see oil at the surface here ...”.

This general description does not include the range and complexity of the environmental
issues raised by the Parties and their respective expert witnesses in regard to crude oil
pollution in the former concession area, as also the legal issues arising from such

pollution and the 1995 Settlement Agreement.
G: The Lawsuits, Arbitrations, Prosecutions and Investigations

The crude oil pollution in the concession area has given rise to extensive legal disputes

over the last 25 years, producing multinational lawsuits and arbitrations on a scale

unprecedented in the collective experience of this Tribunal. For ease of reference later,
it is necessary to list these principal lawsuits and arbitrations at the outset. The Tribunal

here also addresses the criminal prosecutions and investigations in Ecuador.

(1) The Aguinda Litigation (New York): The Aguinda Complaint was filed in the District
Court for the Southern District of New York on 3 November 1993. It pleaded a claim
by the Aguinda Plaintiffs as a putative (uncertified) class action under the USA’s
Federal Rules of Procedure, by named individuals and “on behalf of a class of all others
similarly situated” for personal injuries and property damage caused by the defendant’s

wrongdoing.** The original defendant was Texaco.

As pleaded, the named individuals and unnamed class members estimated as numbering
30,000 were all resident in Ecuador from 1972 onwards within a geographical area
defined by latitude and longitude, south of the Colombian border.*? This complaint
asserted individual civil claims for personal injury and property damage, aggregated as
members of the same putative class. The causes of action were pleaded in tort, including
negligence, public nuisance, private nuisance, strict liability, trespass and civil
conspiracy, with relief claimed as compensatory damages, punitive damages and
equitable relief to remedy the alleged pollution and contamination “of the plaintiffs’

environment and the personal injuries and property damage caused thereby” (page 4).

As decided by this Tribunal in its Decision on Track 1B,*° the Aguinda Complaint in
New York was not a ‘diffuse’ claim. This much, at least, is common ground between
the Parties.*! As the Claimants acknowledged at the April Hearing (on Track 1B): “...
both Parties agree that what was at issue in Aguinda were individual claims,

aggregate[d] individual claims.”*?

As recorded by the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in its judgment of 5
August 1997, the Aguinda Plaintiffs’ claims for equitable relief in the Complaint were
later elaborated: “Though the complaints make only a general demand for equitable
relief, the plaintiffs clarified their demand somewhat during discovery. The relief they

seek includes the following: undertaking or financing environmental cleanup, to include

access to potable water and hunting and fishing grounds, renovating or closing the
Trans-Ecuadoran Pipeline, creation of an environmental monitoring fund, formulating
standards to govern future Texaco oil development, creation of a medical monitoring
fund, an injunction restraining Texaco from entering into activities that run that run a

high risk of environmental or human injuries, and restitution.”

By its judgment dated 12 November 1996, the US District Court for the Southern
District of New York (Judge Rakoff) dismissed the Aguinda Complaint. Apart from
applying the doctrine of forum non conveniens (in favour of the Ecuadorian Courts), the
judgment referred to the Aguinda Plaintiffs’ failure to join, as indispensable parties,

PetroEcuador and Ecuador:

“\.. this Court further concludes that there is another independently- sufficient
reason why this action must be dismissed: plaintiffs’ failure to join indispensable
parties, namely, Petroecuador and the Republic of Ecuador. The extensive
equitable relief sought by the plaintiffs-ranging from total environmental ‘clean-
up’ of the affected lands in Ecuador to a major alteration of the consortium’s Trans-
Ecuador pipeline [i.e. the “SOTE” pipeline] to the direct monitoring of the affected
lands for years to come cannot possibly be undertaken in the absence of
Petroecuador, which has owned 100% of the consortium since 1992 and 100% of
the pipeline since 1986, or the Republic of Ecuador, which has helped supervise the
consortium’s activities from the outset and which owns much, if not all, of the
affected lands. Petroecuador and the Republic of Ecuador thus are necessary
‘persons to be joined if feasible’ under either and both prongs of Fed.R.Civ.P. 19(a)

By its judgment of 12 August 1997, the US District Court for the Southern District of

New York (Judge Rakoff) denied Ecuador’s request to join the Aguinda Complaint as

an intervener.*>

The Aguinda Plaintiffs (and Ecuador) appealed to the US Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit. By its judgment of 5 October 1998, the Second Circuit vacated Judge
Rakoff’s orders and remitted the case to him at the US District Court for
reconsideration.*° It held (inter alia) that dismissal on the ground of forum non
conveniens was erroneous in the absence of a condition requiring Texaco to submit to

jurisdiction in Ecuador.

By its judgment dated 30 May 2001, the US District Court for the Southern District of
New York (Judge Rakoff) dismissed the Aguinda Complaint for a second time.*” The
Court ordered an unconditional stay on the ground of forum non conveniens because the
case had “everything to do with Ecuador and nothing to do with the United States [of
America]’”. As there also recorded: “Following remand [by the Second Circuit to Judge
Rakoff], Texaco provided the missing commitment to submit to the jurisdiction of the

courts of Ecuador” (page 4 of the judgment).

This undertaking in favour of Ecuadorian jurisdiction took the form of a Notice of
Agreements made by Texaco on 11 January 1999.** It provides (in material part) as

follows:

“Section A - Actions to Which Agreements Apply: Texaco Inc.’s agreements herein
apply only to a lawsuit that meets all the following conditions:

1. The lawsuit must be brought by a named plaintiff in Aguinda. et al. v, Texaco
Inc., Case No. 93 Civ. 7527 (JSR) (hereafter “Aguinda”).

2. The lawsuit must have been filed in an appropriate court of competent civil
jurisdiction in Ecuador;

3. The lawsuit must arise out of the same events and occurrences alleged in the
Aguinda Complaint filed in this Court on November 3, 1993.

4. To insure prompt notice, a copy of each Complaint intended to be filed by
Aguinda plaintiffs (or any of them) in Ecuador must have been delivered to Texaco
Inc.’s designated representative in Ecuador identified in Section B(1) below not
later than the actual date on which it is filed.

Section B - Agreements: With respect to any lawsuit that meets the conditions set
forth above (a “Foreign Lawsuit”), Texaco Inc. hereby makes the following
agreements:

1. Texaco Inc. will accept service of process in a Foreign Lawsuit in accordance
with the applicable law of Ecuador. Texaco Inc.’s designated representative in
Ecuador authorized to accept service of process in a Foreign Lawsuit shall be:
[Name and address of Texaco’s representative in Quito Ecuador here omitted]. The
authority of [Texaco’s representative] to accept service of process in a Foreign
Lawsuit will become effective upon final dismissal of this action and judgment by

48 R-3 (as more fully described in this Tribunal’s Third Interim Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, para

3.32).

this Court. (The judgment shall become “final” upon the exhaustion of all available
appeals or, if no appeal is filed, the time for filing appeals has expired.)

2. In any such Foreign Lawsuit, Texaco Inc. will waive and/or not assert an
objection based on lack of in personam jurisdiction to the civil jurisdiction of a
court of competent jurisdiction in Ecuador.

3. In any such Foreign Lawsuit, Texaco Inc. will waive any statute of limitations-
based defense that matured during the period of time between: (a) the filing date of
the Aguinda Complaint in this Court (i.e. November 3, 1993), and (b) the 60th day
after the dismissal of this action and judgment becomes final, as defined in Section
B(1) above. Texaco Inc., however, is not waiving any statute of limitations-based
rights or defenses with respect to the passage of time prior to November 3, 1993,
and Texaco Inc. expressly reserves its right to contend in a Foreign Lawsuit that
plaintiffs’ claims were barred, in whole or in part, by the applicable statute of
limitations as of November 3, 1993 when they filed their Complaint in this Court.

4. Texaco Inc. agrees that discovery conducted to date during the pendency of
Aguinda in this Court may be used by any party in a Foreign Lawsuit, including
Texaco Inc., to the same extent as if that discovery had been conducted in
proceedings there, subject to all parties’ rights to challenge the admissibility and
relevance of such discovery under the applicable rules of evidence.

5. Texaco Inc. agrees to satisfy a final judgment (i.e. a judgment with respect to
which all appeals have been exhausted), if any, entered against it in a Foreign
Lawsuit in favor of a named plaintiff in Aguinda, subject to Texaco Inc.’s
reservation of its right to contest any such judgment under New York’s Recognition
of Foreign Country Money Judgments Act, 7B N.Y. Civ. Prac. L&R § 5301-09
(McKinney 1978).”

(This undertaking, as varied, came into effect with the eventual stay of the Aguinda

Litigation on 16 August 2002, i.e. after Texaco’s “merger” with Chevron in 2001).

In 2001, the Aguinda Plaintiffs appealed from Judge Rakoff’s dismissal to the US Court
of Appeals for Second Circuit. By its judgment dated 16 August 2002, the Second

Circuit affirmed, as modified, Judge Rakoff’s Order.*?

The Second Circuit recorded (page 4): “Texaco consented to personal jurisdiction in
Ecuador as to the Aguinda plaintiffs ... in ... Ecuador .... Texaco stipulated it would
waive its statute of limitations defenses that matured during the period of time between
the filing of the complaint and the 60th day after the dismissal of the action by the district

court. It preserved such defenses, however, with respect to the passage of time prior to

Part IV - Page 24

4.86.

4.87.

the initial filing of the complaints. It also offered to stipulate that plaintiffs could utilize
the discovery obtained thus far in resumed proceedings in Ecuador or Peru. Texaco then
renewed its motion to dismiss by reason of forum non conveniens.” The Second Circuit
decided (page 8): “The district court’s judgment dismissing for forum non conveniens
is affirmed, subject to the modification that the judgment be conditioned on Texaco’s
agreement to waive defenses based on statutes of limitation for limitation periods
expiring between the institution of these actions [i.e. 3 November 1993] and a date one
year subsequent to the final judgment of dismissal. “ The Tribunal understands that
Texaco agreed to vary its condition regarding limitation, as directed by the Second

Circuit.

Much later, in 2011, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit decided in the New
York Stay Legal Proceedings (described below) that Texaco’s undertaking (of 1999, as
varied) bound Chevron, albeit a distinct and separate legal person under the laws of the

USA. The Second Circuit held :°°

“Chevron Corporation claims, without citation to relevant case law, that it is not
bound by the promises made by its predecessors in interest Texaco and Chevron-
Texaco, Inc. However, in seeking affirmation of the district court’s forum non
conveniens dismissal, lawyers from Chevron-Texaco appeared in this Court and
reaffirmed the concessions that Texaco had made in order to secure dismissal of
Plaintiffs’ complaint. In so doing, Chevron-Texaco bound itself to those
concessions. In 2005, Chevron-Texaco dropped the name “Texaco” and reverted
to its original name, Chevron Corporation. There is no indication in the record
before us that shortening its name had any effect on Chevron-Texaco’s legal
obligations. Chevron Corporation therefore remains accountable for the promises
upon which we and the district court relied in dismissing [the Aguinda] Plaintiffs’
action.”*!

 

The Tribunal acknowledges the continuing controversy as to whether or not Texaco’s
1999 undertaking (as varied) binds Chevron, as distinct from Texaco. Although other
legal materials suggest otherwise, this decision of the Second Circuit ostensibly binds
both Chevron and the Respondent as a matter of issue (or collateral) estoppel and
judicial estoppel under the laws of the USA. (For reasons explained in Part VIII below,
the Tribunal does not think it necessary or appropriate to decide this controversy, one

way or the other, in this Award).

During the Aguinda Litigation, in support of its case on forum non conveniens, Texaco
generally lauded the Ecuadorian judicial system as the forum for its disputes with the
Aguinda Plaintiffs. In the words of one of Texaco’s expert witnesses testifying in 2000:
“Despite isolated problems that may have occurred in individual criminal proceedings,
Ecuador’s judicial system is neither corrupt nor unfair. Such isolated problems are not

characteristic of Ecuador’s judicial system, as a whole”.*?

(2) The Lago Agrio Litigation (Ecuador): The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ Complaint against
Chevron as the sole named defendant is, in its original Spanish version, a document of
17 pages. It was filed with the Lago Agrio Court on 7 May 2003. By this time, the

“merger” between Texaco and Chevron had taken place (in 2001).

The Lago Agrio Complaint begins with the list of the 48 individual plaintiffs, all being
(as translated into English) “domiciled in the Secoya Community of San Pablo de
Aguarico, Canton of Shushufundi, Province of Sucumbjos” and “Ecuadorian nationals
engaged in farming activities.” These plaintiffs are described as having been the same
Aguinda Plaintiffs in the stayed Aguinda Litigation New York, having there sought
“enforcement of their own rights as well as those of other people in the same class, as
the term is used in [New York’s] procedural rules to designate the people who might
find themselves in an identical legal situation with regard to the specifics of the lawsuit

[i.e. the Aguinda Litigation]” (Paragraph 8).

Part I of the Lago Agrio Complaint pleads the alleged “background” to the case,
including the 1998 Final Release (forming part of the 1995 Settlement) and the “merger”
between Texaco and Chevron. Part II pleads the alleged “contaminating methods
employed by Texaco”. Part III pleads the alleged consequential “damage and the
affected population”. Its Paragraph III.2 pleads, as a matter of causation, the alleged
consequences to the health and life expectancy of the population, including but not
expressly so, the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs. Part IV pleads “Texaco Inc.’s liability”. In the
latter’s Paragraph IV.9, Texaco’s liability and remedial obligation were allegedly
”passed on to” Chevron by virtue of the “merger” between the two corporations”

described in Paragraph 1.12. Thus far, apart from the allegations directed expressly

against Chevron, there is a broad similarity between the complaint in the Aguinda

Litigation and the complaint in the Lago Agrio Litigation.

Part V of the Lago Agrio Complaint pleads the “legal basis” for the claim under the laws
of Ecuador. It invokes Articles 2241 and 2256 of the Civil Code (Paragraph V.1);
Articles 23.6 and 86 of the Constitution (Paragraph V.3(a)); Article 2260 of the Civil
Code, later re-numbered as Article 2236 (Paragraph V.1(b)); and Articles 41 and 43 of
the 1999 Environmental Management Act, the “EMA” (Paragraph V.3(c)).** These
EMA provisions are alleged to establish “a public action” (“accién publica”) based on
the breach of environmental laws” and “the right of legal entities, individuals or human
groups bound by a common interest and directly affected by a harmful action or
omission, to bring an action for damages based on the harm to their health and

environment, including the biodiversity along with its constituting elements.”*>

Part VI of the Lago Agrio Complaint pleads the “prayer for relief’. Such relief is claimed
by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs “in our capacity as members of the affected communities
and in safeguard of their recognized collective rights”.°® The relief claims specific
remedial and ancillary works, with the necessary funds to be paid by Texaco to the
Amazon Defense Front (the “ADF’”), together with 10% of such value payable (with
litigation costs) to the ADF “by express request of the plaintiffs”. It does not expressly
claim compensation for personal harm particular to the individual Lago Agrio Plaintiffs,
or any of them. Part VI addresses “jurisdiction, amount of claim and procedure”,

invoking (inter alia) Articles 42(2) and 43 of the EMA. Part VIII addresses “notices”.

The Lago Agrio Court issued its Judgment in the Lago Agrio Litigation on 14 February
2011 (with its Clarification Order of 4 March 2011), adverse to Chevron. Chevron
initiated three successive appeals against the Lago Agrio Judgment, resulting in the
Judgments of the Appellate Court (2012), the Cassation Court (2013) and the

Constitutional Court (2018).

“Commercial Cases Arbitration”, was brought under Article VI of the Treaty, applying
the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (1976) before the Permanent Court of Arbitration at
The Hague, the Netherlands (PCA Case No. 2007-02/AA277), by Chevron and TexPet
as the claimants, against Ecuador, as the respondent. This UNCITRAL arbitration was

commenced on 21 December 2006.

4.96. The Commercial Cases tribunal made an interim award on jurisdiction of 1 December
2008, a partial award on the merits of 30 March 20107’ and a final award of 31 August
2011.°8 The tribunal rejected the respondent’s jurisdictional objections; the tribunal
found a breach by the respondent of its obligation under Article II(7) of the Treaty
(“effective means”), through the undue delay of the Ecuadorian courts in deciding
TexPet’s seven cases asserting contractual claims for payment under the two Concession
Agreements of 1964 and 1973; and the tribunal held the respondent liable for damages
in the principal amount of US$ 77.74 million, together with pre-award and post-award

compound interest.

4.97. Under challenge by the respondent, the awards in the Commercial Cases were upheld
by the Dutch courts: namely, the Hague District Court (2012), the Hague Court of
Appeal (June 2013) and the Hoge Raad (26 September 2014). In the USA, the US
District Court for the District of Columbia recognised and enforced the final award
under the 1958 New York Convention in 2013.°' The US Court of Appeals for the
District Court of Columbia Circuit dismissed the respondent’s appeal on 4 August

2015.°

4.98. To the Tribunal’s understanding, on 22 July 2016, Ecuador (as the respondent) paid to
Chevron and TexPet the sums due under the awards made in the Commercial Cases

Arbitration.

Apart from the Commercial Cases tribunal’s interpretation of Article II(7) of the Treaty
(to which the Tribunal returns in Part VII below), this Tribunal does not consider that
the Commercial Cases Arbitration provides any specific guidance to the relevant issues

in this arbitration.

As to Article II(7), the Tribunal notes that the Commercial Cases tribunal decided in its
Partial Award that Ecuador’s obligation as to “effective means” constitutes a lex
specialis and not a restatement of customary international law on denial of justice, that
the failure of domestic courts to enforce rights effectively would constitute a violation
of Article II(7); and that the host State’s treaty obligation was a positive obligation to
provide “effective means”, as opposed to a mere negative obligation not to interfere in
the functioning of those means.™ It also notes the Commercial Cases tribunal’s
reference to the “measure of deference” to be afforded to a domestic judicial system and
that the tribunal was “not empowered [by Article II(7) of the Treaty] to act as a court of
appeal reviewing every individual alleged failure of the local judicial system de novo.”®

(The Tribunal returns to these matters also, in Part VII, below).

(4) The Ecuador-USA Treaty Arbitration (PCA): This was an inter-state arbitration
brought on 28 June 2011 by Ecuador (as the claimant) against the USA (as respondent)
under Article VII of the Treaty providing for State-State arbitration, resulting in an
award dated 29 September 2012 dismissing Ecuador’s claim for want of jurisdiction.”
That claim concerned (inter alia) the interpretation of “effective means” in Article II(7)
of the Ecuador-USA Treaty (i.e. the same Treaty in this case), as decided in the partial

award issued in the Commercial Cases Arbitration.

(5) The AAA Arbitration (New York): This arbitration was commenced in June 2004
before the American Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) in New York under an

arbitration agreement allegedly contained in the 1965 Joint Operating Agreement (the

See CLA-47, paras 241, 243, 244, 248.

66 Article VII(1) of the Ecuador-USA Treaty provided (inter alia): “Any dispute between the Parties concerning

channels, shall be submitted upon the request of either Party, to an arbitral tribunal for binding decision in
accordance with the applicable rules of international law ...”

“1965 JOA”) and a draft JOA of 1974 under the 1964 and 1973 Concession Agreements

(i.e. it was not brought under the Treaty).

The claimants were Chevron and TexPet, asserting a contractual indemnity for
environmental damage from the respondents, Ecuador and PetroEcuador. The
respondents applied in New York to the US District Court for the Southern District of
New York for a stay of the AAA Arbitration. By orders of the US District Court (Judge
Sand), the AAA Arbitration was partially stayed in June 2007,® affirmed on appeal by
the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on 7 October 2008.° The US Supreme

Court denied Chevron’s petition for a writ of certiorari in June 2009.”°

(6) The New York Stay Legal Proceedings (New York): On 14 January 2010, the
Respondent and the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs applied to the US District Court for the
Southern District of New York to stay this arbitration between the Claimants and the
Respondent under the Treaty. Their application was rejected by the District Court (Judge
Sand) on 16 March 2010.7! On appeal, the District Court’s judgment was upheld by the
US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on 17 March 2011.7?

In its judgment, the Second Circuit recognised the autonomous nature, or ‘separability’,
of the Treaty from the arbitration agreement between the Claimants and the Respondent

derived from the Treaty:

“At the outset, we note that Chevron is not a party to the BIT. Unlike the more
typical scenario where the agreement to arbitrate is contained in an agreement
between the parties to the arbitration, here the BIT merely creates a framework
through which foreign investors, such as Chevron, can initiate arbitration against
parties to the Treaty. In the end, however, this proves to be a distinction without a
difference, since Ecuador, by signing the BIT, and Chevron, by consenting to
arbitration, have created a separate binding agreement to arbitrate.””?

(7) The Section 1782 Litigation (USA): Beginning in December 2009, Chevron initiated
numerous legal proceedings in several US District Courts in the USA under U.S.C.

Veiga-Pérez Criminal Prosecutions and this arbitration. These proceedings were
directed to (inter alios) Mr Donziger, Mr Berlinger, Mr Bonifaz, Mr Kohn, Mr Wray,
Dr Calmbacher, Mr Champ, Mr Rourke, Stratus Consulting Inc., E-Tech and Banco
Pichincha. The Respondent, in turn, later initiated legal proceedings in the USA under
U.S.C. Section 1782 in order to obtain discovery for use in this arbitration, including (as

later described in Part VII below) Mr Connor.

Title 28, Section 1782 of the U.S. Code permits a US district court, upon the application
of any interested person, to order a person found or residing within the district “to give
testimony or statement or to produce a document or other thing for use in a proceeding
in a foreign or international tribunal”. The factors to be considered in exercising this
discretionary power are set out in the US Supreme Court’s judgment in Jntel Corp. v
Advanced Memo Devices Inc. 542 US 241 (2004). Section 1782 does not apply to

persons not subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of the USA.

As listed in the RICO Judgment (page 1), the reported US court decisions under Section
1782, relevant to the RICO Litigation and this arbitration, include the following: Jn re

It is unnecessary here to address the numerous interlocutory orders and judgments made
in the RICO Litigation by the US District Court for the Southern District of New York
and the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. As listed in the RICO Judgment,
these include: Chevron Corp. v. Donziger, 768 F.Supp 581 (S.D.N.Y.2011) (“Donziger

The RICO trial took place before the US District Court New York (Judge Kaplan) over
seven weeks from 15 October to 26 November 2013. Its proceedings were recorded by
verbatim transcript.’ The District Court issued its judgment on 4 March 2014 in favour
of Chevron and against the Donziger defendants.” Not counting its lengthy appendices,

the RICO Judgment extends over 485 pages. Its conclusion reads in part: “The saga of

the Lago Agrio case is sad. It is distressing that the course of justice was perverted. The
LAPs [Lago Agrio Plaintiffs] received the zealous representation they wanted, but it is
sad that it was not always characterised by honor and honesty as well. It is troubling that
.... What happened here probably means that ‘we’ll never know whether or not there

was a case to be made against Chevron’ ...”

4.112. On 8 August 2016, the Second Circuit affirmed the Judgment of the US District Court;
and it dismissed the appeal by the Donziger defendants.”* For this appeal, Ecuador (not
being a disputing party) submitted to the Second Circuit an amicus brief dated 8 July
2014.”

4.113. On 19 June 2017, the US Supreme Court denied the Donziger defendants’ petition of
certiorari from the judgment of the Second Circuit,*” as notified by the Claimants’ letter

dated 29 June 2017 to the Tribunal.

4.114. On 28 February 2018, the US District for the Southern District of New York (Judge
Kaplan) issued its judgment regarding the allocation and assessment of costs incurred
by the Parties in the RICO Litigation, as reserved in the RICO Judgment.*! The Court
ordered Mr Donziger to pay US$ 944,463.85 to Chevron towards its legal costs.

4.115. (9) The Huaorani Litigation (New York): This lawsuit was brought before the New York
Supreme Court on 2 September 2014 by Kempera Baihua Hunai and 41 others from the
Huaorani community in the Oriente against the same Donziger defendants and the
Amazon Defence Front. The plaintiffs, legally represented by Professor Judith
Kimerling®?, claimed from the Donziger defendants a proportional share in the proceeds
of the Lago Agrio Judgment, pleading (inter alia) breaches of fiduciary duty, unjust

enrichment, constructive trust and ancillary relief.

arbitration.

4.116. The same plaintiffs had earlier applied to join, as interveners, in the RICO Litigation.

4.117.

The US District Court for the Southern District of New York (Judge Kaplan) had denied
their request by order dated 14 January 2013, leaving them “free to pursue their claims
in independent actions in the New York State and doubtless other courts.” In this
Huaorani litigation, the Donziger defendants were represented by Mr Steven Donziger.
It appears that the ADF took no part in this litigation, not being subject to the non-

consensual jurisdiction of the New York Courts.

The Huaorani complaint was described, in the first instance judgment of the New York

Supreme Court, as follows:

“\.. Broadly speaking, plaintiffs allege that Donziger and the ADF are seeking
complete control of the proceeds of the Lago Agrio litigation, for their own benefit
and to the detriment of the Huaorani ... Plaintiffs allege that the Donziger
defendants have ... claimed to represent all of the indigenous people, including
plaintiffs and other Huaorani, in activities related to the Lago Agrio. However, it
is plaintiffs’ position that plaintiffs never authorised such representation and that
there is no written retainer agreement, nor any other agreement, which sets forth
Donziger or ADF’s obligations to plaintiffs in connection with the Lago Agrio
Litigation. Nevertheless, plaintiffs allege that as a result of Donziger’s and ADF’s
representations that Donziger is counsel for plaintiffs in the Lago Agrio litigation
and that ADF brought the Lago Agrio litigation on behalf of all of the Ecuadorian
people harmed by Texaco’s operations, including the Huaorani, the Donziger
defendants and ADF owe plaintiffs a fiduciary duty, including a duty to protect their
interests in the Lago Agrio litigation, a duty to notify plaintiffs of any arrangements
with third parties (investors, funders, and/or the Republic of Ecuador) regarding
the proceeds of the judgment, and a duty to notify plaintiffs of enforcement efforts,
settlement negotiations or any other significant developments regarding the
proceeds of the litigation.

Plaintiffs claim, on information and belief, that the money that the Donziger
defendants and ADF collect will be ‘dissipated and funnelled to off-shore havens
beyond the reach of US Courts and that the Donziger Defendants and ADF intend
to assign away [the Huaorani’s] interest in the Lago Agrio judgment in exchange
for money’. It is plaintiffs’ position that the Donziger defendants and ADF have
agreements with investors and funders in exchange for interests in the judgments
and that they have already collected more than $10 million by selling shares in the
judgment, that the Republic of Ecuador expects to receive at least 90% of the
proceeds of the judgment; and that the Donziger defendants and ADF intend to
distribute the remaining proceeds of the judgment to lawyers and investors before
passing the remaining money to Ecuadorian trusts controlled by ADF.” (pp. 4-5).

4.118. Whilst opposing the Huaorani plaintiffs’ complaint as regards both the Court’s exercise

of jurisdiction and the merits, the Donziger defendants are recorded, in the judgment, as

4.120.

4.121.

4.122.

accepting: “that ADF agrees that the Huaorani people should benefit from the Lago
Agrio litigation” (p.12, footnote 1). The judgment also records that the ADF executed a
retainer agreement with the Donziger defendants in New York (pp. 13 & 15-16). There
is no similar reference to any retainer or other agreement with the individual Huaorani
plaintiffs; and, indeed, the judgment refers to Mr Donziger’s “purported clients”, not

“clients” (p. 15).

By its judgment issued on 29 August 2014, the New York Supreme Court stayed the
lawsuit under the New York legal doctrine of forum non conveniens and dismissed the
plaintiffs’ complaint.*? The plaintiffs appealed to the New York Supreme Court,
Appellate Division, First Department. By its judgment issued on 16 June 2015, that

Court affirmed the Supreme Court’s order for a stay.*+

The Huaorani Litigation is factually significant. First, it confirms that Mr Donziger, with
his colleagues in Ecuador (including the ADF), had no written retainer or power of
attorney to act in the Lago Agrio Litigation on behalf of any member of the Huaorani
community as individuals. Second, it confirms that Mr Donziger and his Ecuadorian
colleagues (including the ADF) intended that, nonetheless, the Lago Agrio Judgment
should accrue (in part) for the benefit of the members of the Huaorani community as a

whole.

The Tribunal here notes again the broad language of the Lago Agrio Complaint: it
alleges legal injury to and relief for all affected persons within a large geographical area,
including expressly members of the Huarani community.*° The Tribunal also notes that
none of the named Aguinda Plaintiffs or the named Lago Agrio Plaintiffs were members
of the Huaorani community.*° (These matters are relevant to the Tribunal’s later
consideration of the “diffuse” nature of Chevron’s legal liability in the Lago

Agrio Judgment, to which the Tribunal returns in Part V below)

(10) The Veiga-Pérez Criminal Prosecutions (Ecuador): In 2003, the Respondent’s
Comptroller-General initiated criminal proceedings, later to become prosecutions,

against (inter alios) Mr Veiga (a national of the USA) and Dr Pérez (a national of

Ecuador). These proceedings are also called “the criminal indictments” in this

arbitration.

These Criminal Prosecutions alleged “falsity in a notarial instrument” (later “ideological
falsehood”) under Articles 338 and 339 of the Ecuadorian Penal Code, committed by
Mr Patricio Rivadeneira (the former Minister of Energy and Mines), Dr Ramiro Gordillo
(the former Executive President of PetroEcuador), Mr Luis Alban Granizo (the former
Manager of Petroproduccion), Mr Veiga and Dr Pérez (TexPet’s Vice-President and
legal representative, respectively). The alleged falsity concerned the 1995 Settlement
Agreement (with associated documentation), signed by the Ministry of Energy and

Mines, PetroEcuador and TexPet.

The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives co-operated with members of President
Correa’s administration to bring these prosecutions in an attempt to nullify the effect of
Chevron’s reliance upon the 1995 Settlement Agreement as a defence in the Lago Agrio

Litigation.

For example, in her email dated 10 February 2005 to the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’
representatives, Dr Escobar described her meeting on 8 February 2005 with members

of the Presidential Office, as follows:°”

“... I explained to Dr Gonzdlez [the Legal Under-Secretary General of the
Presidential Office] that .... [w]ith respect to the topic of the contract, I explained
that the Attorney General’s Office [sic] and all of us working on the State’ s defense
were searching for a way to nullify or undermine the value of the remediation
contract and the final acta and that our greatest difficulty lay in the time that has
passed.”

(The “remediation contract” and “final acta” were references to the 1995 Settlement

Agreement ad the 1998 Final Release. The “‘State’s defense” referred to the pending
AAA Arbitration in New York, described above).

Later, in his email dated 10 February 2006 to the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives,
Mr Donziger stated “... Now that we have the inspections schedule, it’s time to request
Ricardito [sic] Reis Veiga as a witness. Pablo [Fajardo] has the questions. We exploit

that for the press to further create the image of fraud, to put a face on the fraud, perhaps

during the mobilization and press conference about fraud. In the US it’s going to be a
bombshell with the press. We should set a date. Poor him ...”.*°. In his email message
dated 1 October 2007 to Messrs Prieto, Donziger, Yanza, Saenz and Ponce, Mr Fajardo
stated: “ ... Today I went to the Supreme Court to look for the file on the issue regarding
the prosecutor’s office ... Now the file is being reviewed by one of the assistants to the

Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Tomorrow we will meet with the Chief Justice of

the Supreme [Court] to move this issue forward ...”. °°

By its decision dated 9 August 2006, for want of any evidence of criminal conduct, the
Office of the Prosecutor-General dismissed these criminal prosecutions.*® However, by
its decision dated 31 March 2008, “in the light of new elements”, the Office of the

Prosecutor-General re-opened the criminal prosecutions.”!

One of these elements included President Correa’s visit to the former concession area
in April 2007, organised by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives. During his visit,
the President was accompanied by Messrs Fajardo and Yanza. As reported by “A-

F.L./Presidential Press”:°”

“Today, President Rafael Correa called upon the District Attorney of Ecuador to
allow a criminal case to be heard against the Petroecuador officers who approved
the petroleum remediation in Ecuador’s Amazonia performed by the multinational
company, Texaco. The petition was made after a visit was made to the covered pits
of Well 7 (Shushufindi), supposedly remediated by the oil company in the 1990s.
Residents in the area said that the oil company did not solve the problem, rather
just covered the crude waste pits with dirt. Those affected emphasized that the waste
also contaminates the river around which indigenous communities traditionally
live. Similarly, some residents in the area stated their complaints about the
activities being carried out by Petroecuador in the area. One person reported to
the president and the Minister of Health, Caroline Chang, on a disease he has,
allegedly linked to oil activities, asking the government for help. During the
president’s visit, the visitors became familiar with some sites where oil waste
remains in spite of the fact that an environmental remediation was carried out. The
others who participated in this visit were the Minister of Health, Caroline Chang;
the Minister of Tourism, Marfa Isabel Salvador; the Minister of the Environment,
Ana Alban; the Minister of Energy, Alberto Acosta, Petroecuador’s president,
Carlos Pareja; and the Secretary of Communication, Monica Chuji.”

By its order dated 16 September 2008, the Supreme Court (First Criminal Division)
decided that the prosecutorial record be sent to the President of the Supreme Court of
Justice, for trial.% By order dated 19 September 2008, the President of the Court
accepted the case for prosecution.** Subsequently, by its lengthy opinion dated 29 April
2010 (based on 65 binders comprising 6,492 documents), the Office of the Prosecutor-
General decided that there was relevant evidence of criminal conduct, by (inter alios)
Mr Veiga and Dr Pérez, requesting that a summons for trial be issued to the defendants
by the National Court of Justice (First Criminal Division).°° By its order dated 15
February 2011, the Court fixed 2 March 2011 as the date of the preliminary hearing in
Quito.* By its order dated 24 February 2011, the Court adjourned that hearing.°”

By its order dated 1 June 2011, after the resumed preliminary hearing, the National
Court of Justice (First Criminal Division) declared the nullity of the Criminal
Prosecutions against (inter alios) Mr Veiga and Dr Pérez.”* By that date, the Lago Agrio
Judgment and its Clarification Order had been issued (on 14 February and 4 March
2011).

In September 2013, the Respondent resumed criminal investigations of individuals who
signed the 1995 Settlement Agreement and related documentation. These proceedings
were and remain confidential under Ecuadorian law. The Tribunal has not been
informed whether any of Chevron’s representatives are the target of such

investigations.”

(11) Enforcement Litigation (Ecuador): Since 30 May 2012, the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs
have sought to enforce the Lago Agrio Judgment in (i) Ecuador, (ii) Canada, (iii) Brazil
and (iv) Argentina. As regards Canada, Brazil and Argentina, these enforcement

proceedings have already been summarised in Annex 4 to Part I above.

As to Ecuador, on 1 March 2012, the Lago Agrio Appellate Court declared the Lago

Agrio Judgment enforceable; on 3 August 2012, the Lago Agrio Court ordered Chevron

to pay the judgment debt within 24 hours; and on 13 October 2012, the Lago Agrio
Court ordered that the Lago Agrio Judgment’s execution “be applicable to the entirety
of the assets of Chevron Corporation, until such time as the entire obligation has been
satisfied.” Assets subject to the attachment order included Chevron’s subsidiaries’
intellectual property assets in Ecuador (including certain trademarks owned by Chevron
Intellectual Property LLC, indirectly owned by Chevron), bank accounts in Ecuador and
bank transfers through the Ecuadorian banking system, in addition to the modest funds
found in TexPet’s bank account at Banco Pichincha in Ecuador (US$ 358.00). On
25 October 2012, the Court extended the attachment order to additional trademark and
intellectual property in Ecuador indirectly owned by Chevron. (At the Track II Hearing,
the Tribunal was informed that these trademarks in Ecuador had no commercial

value). !0

On 27 June 2013, the Lago Agrio Court granted the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ application
to garnishee the payment due from the Respondent to Chevron and TexPet under the
awards issued in the Commercial Cases Arbitration.'°! This order was notified to the
Respondent under the Court’s Order of 12 July 2016. On 21 July 2016, the Order was
discharged by the Court upon the application to the Court by Mr Fajardo acting as the
Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representative. With the Respondent’s payment of the
Commercial Cases awards to Chevron and TexPet on 22 July 2016, these garnishee

proceedings came to an end without any benefit to the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs.

The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs have made further attempts to seize assets in Ecuador
indirectly owned by Chevron under these attachment orders. For example, in two
motions dated 30 January 2015, the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs asked the Lago Agrio Court
to instruct the Ecuadorian Intellectual Property Institute (“EIPI’) to renew certain
trademarks owned by Chevron Intellectual Property LLC and separately to order those
trademarks embargoed pursuant to the Court’s enforcement orders. On 5 April 2016,
the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs requested the Court to appoint a depository to withdraw the
funds that were seized from TexPet’s bank account at Banco Pichincha. On 11 April

2016, the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs requested that the Court rule on the Lago Agrio

Plaintiffs’ prior application for the EIPI to renew and embargo certain trademarks. On

12 July 2016, the Court refused these applications of 5 and 11 April 2016.

To date, no monies (apart, possibly, from the sum of US$ 358.00) have been recovered
from Chevron, TexPet or its other subsidiaries in any enforcement proceedings of the

Lago Agrio Judgment by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs in Ecuador or elsewhere.

(12) The Gibraltar Litigation: Chevron began legal proceedings in Gibraltar against
certain non-party funders of the Lago Agrio Litigation and ostensible beneficiaries of
and administrators for recoveries from the enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgement,
including Mr DeLeon, the Woodsford Group and other defendants. The defendants
applied to strike out Chevron’s action. The Gibraltar Court refused their application,
with the Court expressing surprise in its judgment that the Ecuadorian Courts had not

ordered a re-hearing of the Lago Agrio Litigation. !°?

(13) The Criminal Investigations (Ecuador): The Respondent’s criminal prosecutors
initiated one or more investigations of specific individuals in the conduct of the Lago
Agrio Litigation. As stated in the Respondent’s letter of 21 July 2016 to the Tribunal

13 ‘the details of these

and confirmed by its Counsel at the Track II Hearing,
investigations were and remain confidential under the Criminal Code of Ecuador, even

from the Respondent’s Attorney-General.

One such individual was Judge Nujfiez, with an investigation begun in 2009 for bribery
(with others). These criminal investigations were closed in 2013.'°* Another is Dr
Guerra, begun in 2013.!° The Tribunal was informed by the Claimants that this criminal

investigation remains pending.

To date, no prosecution has been brought against Dr Zambrano, Dr Guerra or any of the
Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives in Ecuador. However, as the Respondent stated,
any criminal investigations into these individuals would be confidential under

Ecuadorian law.

(14) This Treaty Arbitration (The Hague): This arbitration was commenced by Chevron
and TexPet against the Respondent by the Claimants’ Notice of Arbitration dated 23
September 2009 under the Treaty and the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (the “Notice

of Arbitration”).

This Notice of Arbitration, which pre-dated the Lago Agrio Judgment of 14 February

2011, claimed (inter alia) the following relief under the Treaty:

“|. (3) An order and award requiring Ecuador to inform the court in the Lago
Agrio Litigation that TexPet, its parent company, affiliates, and principals have
been released from all environmental impact arising out of the former Consortium’s
activities and that Ecuador and Petroecuador are responsible for any remaining
and future remediation work;

(4) A declaration that Ecuador or Petroecuador is exclusively liable for any
judgment that may be issued in the Lago Agrio Litigation;

(5) An order and award requiring Ecuador to indemnify, protect and defend
Claimants in connection with the Lago Agrio Litigation, including payment to
Claimants of all damages that may be awarded against Chevron in the Lago Agrio
Litigation;

(6) An award for all damages caused to Claimants, including in particular all costs

including attorneys’ fees incurred by Claimants in defending the Lago Agrio

Litigation and the criminal indictments; ...”.
The Notice of Arbitration pleaded several events allegedly taking place within the Lago
Agrio Litigation up to September 2010, amounting to a “judicial farce”. These included
allegations relating to Mr Cabrera (as the Lago Agrio Court’s global expert) and the
Cabrera Reports, as to which it alleged ‘collaboration’ with the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’
representatives. It also alleged gross misconduct by the Lago Agrio Court, including
Judge Niiiez’s improper predisposition towards the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs (until his
recusal in August 2009) and the Respondent’s resort to the Veiga and Pérez Criminal
Prosecutions, in collusion with the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives, in an attempt
to subvert Chevron’s defences based on the 1995 Settlement Agreement in the Lago

Agrio Litigation.

Following the Notice of Arbitration, as and when new evidential materials became
available to them, the Claimants supplemented their pleaded case against the

Respondent, in accordance with procedural orders made by the Tribunal and the

Part IV - Page 41

4.145.

4.146.

4.147.

4.148.

UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (as did, conversely, the Respondent). In particular, by
their Supplemental Memorial on the Merits of 20 March 2012, the Claimants introduced
a new allegation that the Lago Agrio Court’s judgment of 14 February 2011 (as issued
by the Lago Agrio Court and affirmed and, on 1 March 2012, declared enforceable by
the Lago Agrio Appellate Court) had been corruptly ‘ghostwritten’ by representatives
of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs in collusion with Judge Zambrano. (The Tribunal returns to

this allegation at length below).

To date, the Tribunal has made five awards in this arbitration: (i) the First Interim Award
dated 25 January 2012; (ii) the Second Interim Award dated 16 February 2012; (iii) the
Third Interim Award dated 27 February 2012; (iv) the Fourth Interim Award dated 7
February 2013; and (v) the First Partial Award on Track 1 dated 17 September 2013. It
has also made 55 procedural orders, including its orders for interim measures dated 14
May 2010, 6 December 2010, 28 January 2011, 9 February 2011 and 16 March 2011.

These awards and orders are listed in Annexes | and 3 to Part I above.

The Respondent applied to annul the Tribunal’s five awards before the Hague District
Court and Court of Appeal. The Hague District Court rejected the Respondent’s
applications, by its judgment dated 20 January 2016.'!" By its judgment dated 18 July
2017,'°7 the Court of Appeal of The Hague confirmed the decision of the District Court
“with an improvement of the legal grounds”. The Respondent was entitled under Dutch
law, to appeal from this judgment to the Supreme Court of The Netherlands (the “Hoge
Raad’”).

By letter dated 1 August 2017, the Respondent notified the Tribunal that it was
“currently evaluating” whether to initiate such an appeal. On 18 October 2017, the
Respondent lodged a cassation appeal to the Hoge Raad. These appellate proceedings

remain pending before the Hoge Raad, as of the date of this Award. !°

By letter dated 12 July 2017, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal “terminate” its
First, Second and Fourth Interim Awards for the reasons there set out, principally

because “recent events in U.S. courts and in enforcement courts demonstrate that

Chevron faces no current imminent threat of irreparable harm” (pp. 4-5). By letter dated
19 July 2017, the Claimants opposed the Respondent’s request. By its Procedural Order
No 47 dated 31 October 2017, the Tribunal dismissed the Respondent’s request for the

reasons and upon the terms there set out.
H: The Tribunal’s Annotated Chronology 1993-2018

The Tribunal has found it necessary to set out the relevant facts, as it finds them on the
evidence, in the form of an annotated chronology: from 1993 to the Lago Agrio
Judgment and Clarification Order of 14 February and 4 March 2011; and from March
2011 to 2018. The events there described should be read with the documentary evidence

referenced in the corresponding footnotes.

As regards an overall account of the Aguinda Litigation and the Lago Agrio Litigation,
the Tribunal emphasises that these chronologies, albeit lengthy, are incomplete. They

nonetheless suffice for the purpose of this Award.

Documentation in Spanish is here reproduced in English translations prepared by the

Parties for the Tribunal.
1993

3 November 1993: As already indicated, the Aguinda Plaintiffs begin the Aguinda
Litigation before the US Federal Court for the Southern District of New York, USA in
1993.!° It is a putative (not certified) class action pleading several torts against Texaco,
in negligence, nuisance, strict liability, trespass, conspiracy and violations of the law of
nations under the US Alien Tort Claims Act. The complaint is brought in New York
because, at the time, Texaco’s headquarters were located at White Plains, New York. It
lists 76 named plaintiffs, including 15 Kichwa (including Maria Aguinda), 24 Secoya
and 37 non-indigenous “colonists”. There are no named plaintiffs from the Cofan, Siona
and Huaorani communities. However, the size of the putative class, estimated at 30,000
affected persons, is defined geographically to include members of these communities;

but no class is ever certified by the Court.

Part IV — Page 43

4.153.

4.154.

4.155.

4.156.

Texaco denies any liability to the Aguinda Plaintiffs and applies to dismiss the
proceedings on two grounds: (i) forum non conveniens (in favour of the Ecuadorian
Courts) and (ii) the Aguinda Plaintiffs’ failure to join as parties indispensable third

persons (namely PetroEcuador and Ecuador).

The Aguinda Plaintiffs are represented in the Aguinda Litigation by US lawyers,
including Mr Cristébal Bonifaz, Mr Steven Donziger and Mr Joseph Kohn (of Kohn,
Swift and Graf, a law firm in Philadelphia with significant financial resources). The case
is assigned to Judge Broderick; he died in March 1995; and the case is then re-assigned

to Judge Rakoff.
1994

1994: Between May and August 1994, four municipalities in the Oriente, Shushufindi,
Francisco de Orellana (Coca), Lago Agrio and La Joya de los Sachas, begin legal
proceedings against TexPet before the Ecuadorian Courts (the “Municipal Lawsuits”),
seeking compensation for environmental harm and injuries to their communities
allegedly caused by the former Consortium’s operations and also orders requiring
TexPet to remediate the alleged contamination within the area of the former
Concession.!!° In May 1995, as part of the consideration for the release under the 1995
Settlement Agreement, TexPet agrees to negotiate settlements of the Municipal
Lawsuits. TexPet and the four Municipalities subsequently agree settlements in 1996,

approved by the Ecuadorian Courts between May and September 1996.

14 December 1994: A Memorandum of Understanding is made between the
Respondent, PetroEcuador and TexPet (the “MOU”).!!! In summary, the MOU provides
that the parties would develop a detailed scope of environmental remedial work; that
TexPet would perform such work; and that, after the completion of such work, the
parties would negotiate “the full and complete release of TexPet’s obligations for

environmental impacts arising from the operations of the Consortium.”!!?

4 May 1995: The Respondent, PetroEcuador and TexPet conclude the Settlement
Agreement.!!? It provides (inter alia): “the scope of the Environmental Remedial Work
to be undertaken by TexPet to discharge all of its legal and contractual obligations and
liability [for] Environmental Impact arising out of the Consortium’s operations has been
determined and agreed to by TexPet, the Government and PetroEcuador as described in
this Contract”; the agreed scope of the environmental remedial work is attached as
Annex A; and “TexPet agrees to undertake such Environmental Remedial Work in
consideration for being released and discharged of all its legal and contractual
obligations and liability for Environmental Impact arising out of the Consortium’s

operations”. !!4

By Article 5.1 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement, the Respondent and PetroEcuador
release, acquit and forever discharge TexPet and its fellow “Releasees” of “all the
Government’s and Petroecuador’s claims against the Releasees for Environmental
Impact arising from the Operations of the Consortium, except for those related to the
obligations contracted hereunder for the performance by TexPet of the Scope of Work
(Annex A) which shall be released as the Environmental Remedial Work is performed
to the satisfaction of the Government and Petroecuador ...”. The Settlement Agreement
thereby envisages a two-stage process for this release. First, all claims by the
Respondent and PetroEcuador against the Releasees are released, excepting those
covered by the Scope of Work; and, later, the latter are also released if the remedial

work is performed by TexPet to the satisfaction of the Respondent and PetroEcuador.

The 1995 Settlement Agreement is signed for the Respondent by the Minister of Energy
and Mines (Dr Galo Abril Ojeda), for PetroEcuador by its Executive President
(Dr Fererico Vintimilla Ojeda) and for TexPet by its Vice-President (Mr Veiga) and its
legal representative (Dr Pérez). Later, in February 2008, Mr Veiga and Dr Pérez were
defendants in the Criminal Prosecutions brought by the Respondent in relation to the

1995 Settlement Agreements (see above).

‘4.23, Recitals, p. 3; Article 5.1. In Part III above, the Tribunal has set out more fully the relevant extracts from
the 1995 Settlement Agreement, as also of the 1996 Municipal and Provincial Releases and the 1998 Final Release.

The definition of “Environmental Impact” under the 1995 Settlement Agreement is
broad, including any “solid, liquid, or gaseous substance present or released into the

environment in such concentration or condition, the presence or release of which causes,

or has the potential to cause harm to human health or the environment.” !!°

By Article 5.2, the definition of the “claims” to be released under the 1995 Settlement

Agreement is also broad:

“The Government and Petroecuador intend claims to mean any and all claims,
rights to claims, debts, liens, common or civil law or equitable causes of actions
and penalties, whether sounding in contract or tort, constitutional, statutory, or
regulatory causes of action and penalties, whether sounding in contract or tort,
constitutional, statutory, or regulatory causes of action or penalties (including, but
not limited to, causes of action under Article 19-2 of the Political Constitution of
the Republic of Ecuador, Decree No. 1459 of 1971, Decree No. 925 of 1973, the
Water Act, R.O. 233 of 1973, ORD No. 530 of 1974, Decree No.374 of 1976, Decree
No. 101 of 1982, or Decree No 2144 of 1989, or any other applicable law or
regulation of the Republic of Ecuador), costs, lawsuits, settlements and attorneys’
fees (past, present, future, known or unknown), that the Government or
Petroecuador have, or ever may have against each Releasee for or in any way
related to contamination, that have or ever may arise in the future, directly or
indirectly arising out of Operations of the Consortium, including but not limited to
consequences of all types of injury that the Government or Petroecuador may allege
concerning persons, properties, business, reputations, and all other types of
injuries that may be measured in money, including but not limited to, trespass,
nuisance, negligence, strict liability, breach of warranty, or any other theory or
potential theory of recovery.” |!

Effect: As already decided by the Tribunal, as here confirmed, the 1995 Settlement

Agreement was made by the Respondent, acting by its Government, including the

Ministry of Energy and Mines: see the Tribunal’s First Partial Award at paragraph 25.

Respondent’s Ministry of Energy and Mines. !!7

(Shushufindi, Francisco de Orellana, Lago Agrio and La Joya de los Sachas), pursuant
to Paragraph VII(C) of Annex A of the 1995 Settlement Agreement and approved by

the Ecuadorian Courts. !!®

The approved releases provide, in materially similar terms that the representatives of the

municipality (here Lago Agrio):

“\.. proceed to exempt, release, exonerate and relieve forever Texaco Petroleum
Company, Texas Petroleum Company, Compania Texaco de Petréleos del Ecuador
S.A., Texaco Inc., and any other affiliate, subsidiary or other related companies,
and all their agents, employees, executives, directors, representatives, insurers,
lawyers, guarantors, heirs, administrators, contractors, subcontractors, successors
or predecessors, from any responsibility, claim, request, demand, or complaint, be
it past, current, or future, for any and all reasons related to the actions, works or
omissions arising from the activity of the aforementioned companies in the
territorial jurisdiction of the Canton of Lago Agrio, Province of Sucumbios, which
in part comprises the area of the oil concession ... |!

The Tribunal has seen no evidence in this arbitration that any of these municipalities
sought authority to settle the individual claims by any person for personal harm. As with
the 1995 Settlement Agreement, the Tribunal concludes that such individual claims
were unaffected by these Municipal Settlements. Indeed, the Claimants have not here
contended otherwise. (The Tribunal addresses the issue of “diffuse” claims

separately below).

20 November 1996: A “waiver of rights” is ostensibly granted in favour of the
Respondent and PetroEcuador by the Aguinda Plaintiffs’ representatives, Mr Bonifaz
and Mr Kohn.'”° It is made in the USA in the Spanish language before notaries public
of Massachusetts and Pennsylvania (being the respective domiciles of Messrs Bonifaz
and Kohn) by reference to the pending Aguinda Litigation in New York. Messrs Bonifaz
and Kohn appear “in their capacities as lead attorneys for the plaintiffs [in the Aguinda
Litigation], with full legal capacity to execute this document on behalf of the plaintiffs

and of all other U.S. lawyers who, on behalf of the plaintiffs, are involved in the case

419 C.30, p. 7 (settlement) and C-26 (court approval) for Lago Agrio.
20 C911,

Part IV - Page 47

4.168. The Tribunal has seen no evidence in this arbitration that Messrs Bonifaz and Mr Kohn

4.169.

sought or received express authority to settle individual claims by any person
represented by them in the Aguinda Litigation (or to be represented by them in the later
Lago Agrio Litigation). If it existed, given the terms of this waiver made by and on
behalf of private persons, it would be limited to the plaintiffs named in the Aguinda
Complaint advancing individual claims for personal harm; and, ostensibly at least, it
would not extend to other persons not so named or any person alleging only “diffuse”

rights.

The Respondent and PetroEcuador, as beneficiaries, are not signatories to the waiver, it

being only there recorded that:

“The Government of Ecuador, through its counsel, the Attorney General of
Ecuador, Dr Leonidas Plaza Verduga, has decided to become involved in this case
not as a party to the lawsuit [the Aguinda Litigation], but [on behalf] of the
Republic of Ecuador consequently states that it is willing to allow execution in its
territory of any environmental remediation measures the Court may order the
defendant company to perform in accordance with the remedies the plaintiffs seek.
At the same time Ecuador requests that the compensation sought in the above-
mentioned case be paid exclusively by TEXACO and that the Republic of Ecuador,
PETROECUADOR and its affiliate companies or any other Ecuadorian public
sector institution or agency not under any circumstance be required to pay such
compensation.”

4.170. Under the waiver, the Aguinda Plaintiffs “represented” by Messrs Bonifaz and Kohn):

“(1) ... expressly waive the right to file any claim against the Ecuadorian State,
PETROECUADOR and its affiliate companies or any other Ecuadorian public
sector institution or agency, if in any eventuality the Federal Court of New York
attributes to Ecuador or to the other institutions mentioned, any part of the
compensation claimed by the plaintiffs for personal or environmental damage
generated by the oil production activity TEXACO carried out in Ecuador.”

(2) This waiver includes the impossibility of filing any court action against the
Ecuadorian State, Petroecuador and its affiliate companies, or any other
Ecuadorian public sector institution or agency, whether in the United States of
America or in Ecuador, claiming payment of any compensation that the Court of
the Southern District of New York or other U.S. Court might impose upon the
Ecuadorian State, PETROECUADOR and its affiliate companies or any other
Ecuadorian public sector institution or agency on account of the acts that form the
basis for the Aguinda v. TEXACO case.

(3) If TEXACO were to sue the Ecuadorian State, PETROECUADOR and its
affiliate companies, or any other Ecuadorian public sector institution or agency in

Part IV - Page 48

4.171.

4.172.

4.173.

U.S. court to obtain a contribution to any possible judgment against TEXACO in
the U.S. District Court of New York, then we will reject any decision that the New
York Court makes in said regard in favor of TEXACO, and we expressly waive the
right to collect any amount whatsoever arising from such decision.

(4) In addition, we agree to cooperate and at all times assist the attorneys of the
Ecuadorian State, PETROECUADOR and its affiliate companies or any other
Ecuadorian public sector institution or agency / the Ecuadorian Government in the
Aguinda v. TEXACO case.”

As between the Respondent and the Aguinda Plaintiffs, the Respondent was thereby
ostensibly immunised by the terms of this waiver. It is not clear to the Tribunal whether
it was intended that the Respondent was thereby to become immune from the Lago
Agrio Plaintiffs’ claims in the subsequent Lago Agrio Litigation. Whether or not that
was so as a matter of any applicable law or laws, such was nevertheless the factual
position. In the US Section 1782 Litigation, Mr Bonifaz later testified that it would have
been futile for the Aguinda Plaintiffs to try to sue the Respondent in Ecuador: “... the
fact is that you can sue Ecuador; you’re never going to be able to collect.”!?! Mr
Donziger also stated, as privately recorded on film on 16-17 November 2007 in Ecuador,

that “the government here will never pay for any judgment”. '2

It is nonetheless clear that the waiver could have no legal effect on claims against the
Respondent or PetroEcuador by Texaco (or by TexPet and Chevron), both in the USA
and Ecuador. However, it is common ground that such a claim could not be made by
Chevron against PetroEcuador or the Respondent within the Lago Agrio Litigation,

being “summary proceedings” as a matter of Ecuadorian civil procedure. '?*

The Tribunal records its disquiet at the paucity of the evidence regarding this waiver. It
is possible that its purpose may have been limited in scope and time, given the pending
controversy before the US District Court (Judge Rakoff) in New York over the
application by the Respondent and PetroEcuador to intervene in the Aguinda Litigation
as co-plaintiffs, supporting the Aguinda Plaintiffs, and Texaco’s opposition to that

application (see above).

Mr Bonifaz testified, in the US Section 1782 Litigation, that the waiver had originated
from a comment by Judge Rakoff that, if the Respondent did intervene in the Aguinda
Litigation, “Texaco might bring counterclaims against it”.!** According to Mr Bonifaz,
the waiver was drafted by the Respondent; and: “There’s no question there was a quid
pro quo here. In other words, okay, Mr Leonidas Plaza [the Respondent’s Attorney-
General at the time], I’ll sign this thing and you intervene in New York. Well, that
government lasted one year. And once the old government lasted a year, the government
all of a sudden wrote a letter to the court - the new government of Alarcén [President
Fabian Alarcén] wrote a letter to the court saying something to the effect that we’re not
going to intervene; we’re backing off out of that intervention, but we are going to

support the plaintiffs.” !7>

In any event, whatever the explanation for this waiver, on 12 August 1997, the US
District Court (Judge Rakoff) denies the application by Ecuador to intervene in the
Aguinda Litigation. This order is not vacated by the US Court of Appeals for the Second

Circuit.'°

12 November 1996: The US District Court (Judge Rakoff) grants Texaco’s application
to stay the Aguinda Plaintiffs’ complaint.'?’ (This decision was later reversed by the

U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on 5 October 1998: see below).

sites in 10 fields had been investigated under the RAP, with remedial action taken at
168 of these locations; and the balance (of 89) not subjected to remedial action because

it was not required under the RAP. '*!

4.179. Whilst there was later much disquiet within the Respondent’s Government as to the
making of the 1995 Settlement Agreement (with the 1998 Final Release), there is no
cogent evidence before this Tribunal that TexPet (or Texaco) violated the terms of the

1995 Settlement, the RAP or any Acta.

4.180. To the contrary, Mr Giovanni Rosania Schiavone, the Respondent’s Under-Secretary of
Environmental Protection (1995-1996) testified in this arbitration, as to his signing

of Actas:

“@Q..... The signing of those Actas represented to your knowledge and expertise and
opinion that the work TexPet had promised to do was done successfully and
completely with respect to the Acta that you signed? A. That’s correct. The technical
work — I insist the technical work and environmental work was done well, and we
accepted that the problem had been corrected, environmental problem in that area
had been corrected.” '**

4.181. In May 2006, Mr Manuel Mufioz as the Director of DINAPA (the National
Environmental Protection Management of the Ministry of Energy) was to inform a

Commission of the Congress:

“Twould like to share with you some very important news which are very interesting
but have not come to public notice. Petroproducci6n [PetroEcuador] was left with
a very considerable debit side derived from the pits left by Texaco. Texaco
completed the remediation of the pits that were their responsibility; this was 33%
of the total. However, Petroecuador, during more than three decades, had done
absolutely nothing with regard to the pits that were the state-owned company’s
responsibility to remediate.” '**

4.182. In July 2006, in her expert report to the Office of the Prosecutor, Ms Adriana Enriquez

Sanchez was to conclude:

“The purpose of this examination was to determine whether the surface of the pits
remediated according to the RAP have seeps of oil or any sort of hydrocarbons that
might endanger human health, flora or fauna. The Technical-Visual examination
was conducted on the pits at certain oil wells in the following fields: Sacha,

Shushufindi, Guanta and Lago Agrio ... The surface of the soil in the remediated
pits contains a great deal of organic material and there is no evidence of
hydrocarbons, for which reason it does not represent a risk to human life, flora or
wildlife. Similarly, no remains or leaks of hydrocarbons into the soil around the
pits could be seen.” 4

Later, in his email to Mr Donziger dated 1 August 2008, the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’
expert, Mr Beltman, was to state: “I did not find any clear instances where TexPet did
not meet the conditions required in the cleanup.” !*> (This email message is quoted more

Chevron Corporation, with Texaco Inc. emerging as the surviving corporation in the
merger and becoming a direct subsidiary of Chevron Corporation, '** and with the parent
company changing its name in turn to “ChevronTexaco Corporation”.'*? (In 2005,
ChevronTexaco Corporation drops the name “Texaco” and is (re-) named Chevron

more fully the form and effect of this merger under its applicable law, the laws of

October 2000 between Chevron, Texaco and Keepep Inc. (the "Agreement and Plan of

Merger")!*!

under a legal procedure known under the laws of Delaware as a “reverse
triangular merger”. At all material times, Chevron, Texaco and Chevron’s subsidiary,

Keepep Inc, were companies incorporated in the State of Delaware.

Mr Soler testified that on 9 October 2001, Texaco merged with Keepep Inc., a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Chevron, in accordance with Section 1.1 of the Agreement and
Plan of Merger; Texaco emerged as the surviving corporation from its merger with
Keepep Inc; and, as a result, Texaco became a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of
Chevron; Chevron’s stock in Keepep Inc. was converted into stock in Texaco, while
each share of Texaco common stock held by Texaco’s shareholders was converted into
the right to receive 0.77 shares of Chevron’s common stock, which equated in value to

approximately US$ 38.012 billion.

In accordance with Section 2.1(a) of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, so Mr Soler
testified, Chevron changed its name to “ChevronTexaco Corporation”; Texaco
continued to exist as a subsidiary of ChevronTexaco Corporation; and the change in
name from "Chevron Corporation" to "ChevronTexaco Corporation" did not affect

Chevron’s corporate structure.

Thus, according to Mr Soler, with this “merger”, Chevron acquired all of Texaco’s
stock; Chevron did not acquire any of Texaco’s assets or liabilities (because Texaco
remained a separate corporation); and Texaco retained ownership of all of its assets and
liabilities, consisting primarily of ownership interests in Texaco’s subsidiary

companies, including TexPet.

The legal effects of this “reverse triangular merger” were the subject of expert testimony
by Professor William T. Allen, formerly the Chancellor (or Chief Judge) of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware. In his expert report, '*? Professor Allen testified that
under Delaware law, Chevron did not assume or otherwise become liable for any
obligations of Texaco as a result of the “merger”; the judicial doctrine of piercing the
corporate veil, under Delaware law, does not impose upon Chevron liability for any

obligations of Texaco relating to events that occurred prior to the date of the “merger”;

Chevron had no capacity to “control and dominate” the management of Texaco prior to
the “merger”; the “merger” itself did not constitute any wrong to then existing or future
creditors of Texaco, since under Delaware law, which governed the effects of the
“merger”, those persons were left in precisely the same position vis-a-vis Texaco’s
assets and liabilities as they were before the “‘merger”‘; and those assets and liabilities

remained unaffected by the “merger”.

The Tribunal accepts the factual testimony of Mr Soler and, as to the laws of Delaware,
the expert testimony of Professor Allen. It concludes that, as a matter of Delaware law,
Chevron did not succeed to the liabilities of Texaco or TexPet incurred before the
merger in 2001, including liabilities resulting from their respective activities in Ecuador

from 1964 to 1992.
2002

16 August 2002: The stay of the Aguinda Litigation in New York takes effect, with
Texaco’s undertaking in favour of Ecuadorian jurisdiction and the dismissal of the
Aguinda Plaintiffs’ appeal from the decision of Judge Rakoff by the US Court of

Appeals for the Second Circuit. !*7

2003

7 May 2003: The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs file their Complaint in the Lago Agrio Court in
Ecuador against “Texaco Inc.” as the only named defendant in the title page (“the Lago
Agrio Litigation”). !4

The Complaint is drafted by Mr Alberto Wray, the senior Ecuadorian lawyer acting for
the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs in Ecuador. He testified: “I wrote the claim submitted in Lago
Agrio in 2003 by the members of the ‘Frente de Defensa de la Amazonia’ (‘the
plaintiffs’) ... As the author of the Complaint, I intended to preserve to the extent
possible the claims that had been raised and pursued in the Aguinda case in New York.
Since Ecuadorian law does not contemplate an equivalent of a class action, I based the

claims on, inter alia, Article 2260 of the Civil Code,'4> which grants any individual or

45 Article 2236 of the Civil Code (formerly Article 2260) of the Civil Code provides (in the original Spanish and
in its English translation): “Por regla general se concede accién popular en todos los casos de daito contingente

4.200.

group of individuals a right of action to compel the removal of any threat of damage,

including an environmental threat.” 4°

As the Tribunal decided in its Decision on Track IB (by a majority), the Complaint
includes both claims made by individuals for personal harm (not being diffuse claims)

and diffuse claims.

At this time, the assigned judge in Lago Agrio is Judge Guerra, as the President of the

Superior Court of Nueva Loja (the “Lago Agrio Court”).

The Tribunal understands that the title page for the court file on the Lago Agrio
Litigation was mistakenly prepared by the Lago Agrio Court clerk and that the correct
name of the defendant should have been “ChevronTexaco Corporation”, as appears
from page 7 of the Complaint.'*” For ease of reference, the Tribunal refers to this
defendant in the Lago Agrio Litigation as “Chevron”. Texaco and TexPet are not named

parties to the Lago Agrio Litigation.

Chevron was therefore the sole defendant named in the Lago Agrio Litigation. At first
sight, it was a strange decision by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs. Chevron itself had never
done business in Ecuador; nor had it participated in any capacity under the 1964 or 1973
Concession Agreements; nor was it a signatory party to the 1995 Settlement Agreement
(including the 1998 Final Release). At this time, Chevron and its subsidiaries had no
significant assets in Ecuador. Under US and Delaware laws, as its personal law, Chevron
was and remained a legally distinct and separate company from both Texaco and

TexPet.

Later, Mr Donziger complained that the Lago Agro Plaintiffs’ senior Ecuadorian lawyer
(Mr Alberto Wray) had made a mistake in naming “the wrong party” as the defendant:
“... This goes back to Alberto’s errors: suing the wrong party in the complaint, then
asking for too many inspections rather than controlling the process, capitulating on the

field lab at the first complaint, letting work visa slide at first inspection, signing the Plan

que por imprudencia o negligencia de alguno amenace a personas indeterminadas. Pero si el daiio amenazare
solamente a personas determinadas, sélo alguna de éstas podrd intentar la accion.” (“As a general rule, a popular
action is granted in all cases of contingent harm which, due to recklessness or negligence of a party threatens
undetermined persons. But if the harm threatened only determined persons, only one of these may pursue the
action.”). The relevant texts of the Civil Code are set out in Part III of this Award, above.

of Analysis — most all of these a function of his inability to take on the TEX [Texaco]

lawyers and take control of the litigation.” !#*

Mr Wray ceased acting as the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ senior lawyer in June 2005, when
Mr Donziger assumed a more prominent role, together with Mr Fajardo and Mr Luis
Yanza. Mr Wray had no participation in the Lago Agrio Litigation as the Lago Agrio
Plaintiffs’ “procurador” after February 2006. '*° As Mr Donziger later testified in his US
deposition in the RICO Litigation, in response to the question whether Mr Wray’s role
had then been terminated or reduced: “I wouldn’t say reduced. I would say it evolved to
something different ... when the case began in Ecuador, he [Mr Wray] was the
procurador common, which is the position that Pablo Fajardo occupies today [December
2010], and there came a time when he [Mr Wray] didn’t want to continue in that role
for a variety of reasons, so he evolved into a different role, where he was, I would say,
more eminent — he would sort of advise the lawyers on the Lago Agrio team about
Ecuadorian law issues.”'*° (The Tribunal has seen no evidence connecting Mr Wray
with any improper conduct alleged by the Claimants against the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’

representatives).

In any event, the named defendant in the Lago Agrio Complaint is never amended by
the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs. The sole defendant remains Chevron, allegedly standing in
the shoes of Texaco and TexPet as result of the “merger” between Chevron and Texaco

in 2001.

As already indicated above, in this Award the Tribunal refers to the defendant in the
Lago Agrio Litigation as “Chevron”, although others at the time also referred to it as

“Chevron-Texaco” and “Texaco”.

The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ technical experts are to include Mr David Russell
(subsequently replaced by Stratus Consulting), Mr Douglas Beltman (of Stratus
Consulting), Dr Anne Maest (also of Stratus Consulting), Dr Charles Calmbacher (used
as the first judicial inspection expert), Mr Edison Camino, Dr Castro and Mr Oscar

Davila (used as experts for the judicial inspections).

13 May 2003: The Lago Agrio Court (Judge Guerra) assumes jurisdiction over the Lago
Agrio Complaint, ruling against Chevron’ s jurisdictional objection. Judge Guerra orders
the case to proceed as a summary verbal proceeding under the provisions of Article 43
of the Environmental Management Act 1999 and Articles 843 et seq of the Code of Civil
Procedure.'*! As already indicated, it is common ground between the Parties that such

a summary proceeding does not allow Chevron to implead PetroEcuador.'*

June 2003: At this time, when Mr Fajardo had not yet joined the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’
legal representatives, Mr Fajardo writes, as later recorded in the Final Report FLACSO-
PetroEcuador Project Phase II of November 2003 “on the socio-environmental conflicts

at the Sacha and Shushufindi fields (1994-2002)”:

“They [Petroproduccién and PetroEcuador ] are not trustworthy because Petro
does not practice what it preaches. Even since Texaco left, Petro has caused more
damages and far more disasters than Texaco itself. But that is not what they say at
all. Therefore, there are frequent spills and pipe breaks, and swamps, rivers and
marshlands become contaminated to a large extent. But as this is a state-owned
company and these people are linked with the legal system and everything, no one
says a thing.” !>

Mr Fajardo is described in the Report as the president of the Shushufindi Human Rights

Commission and legal advisor of the Frente de Defensa de la Amazonia.

21 October 2003: A “conciliation hearing” is held before Judge Guerra on 21 October
2003. At this hearing, Chevron files its Response to the Lago Agrio Complaint. Its
response, inter alia, challenges the jurisdiction of the Lago Agrio court over Chevron
and, without prejudice to its jurisdictional challenge, also responds to the substance of

the Complaint. !*

29 October 2003: The Lago Agrio Court (Judge Guerra) orders an “expertise” in two
phases. The first phase is to involve the carrying out of judicial inspections of 25 sites
requested by Chevron and 97 sites requested by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs. Each side
would appoint their own experts to conduct these inspections. The second phase,
requested by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs, envisages: “an expert examination intended to

confirm the environmental effects of hydrocarbon production activities in all the fields

used by TEXACO for production in its role as operator of the Consortium ... this same
procedure shall have the participation of Experts appointed and installed for the

2004

7 August 2004: The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs and Chevron agree terms of reference in the
Lago Agrio Litigation, contemplating that the Lago Agrio Court would appoint a panel
of independent settling experts [“dirimentes”] to resolve any differences between the
reports of the experts of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs and Chevron conducting the judicial
inspections. '°° The parties’ agreement is recorded in a 91-page document, comprising:
(i) terms of reference for the experts who would be carrying out the judicial inspections;
(ii) a detailed sampling plan; (iii) ten “standard operating procedures” covering the
taking of different samples from various locations, the decontamination of equipment
etc; and (iv) an analysis plan, prepared in accordance with USEPA guidelines
[“USEPA” denotes the United States Environmental Protection Agency], which covered

(inter alia) data quality objectives, data validation and laboratory procedures. '*7

26 August 2004: The Lago Agrio Court (now Judge Novillo) orders the parties to

comply with the agreed terms of reference. !°*
Summer 2004: The judicial site inspections begin in the Lago Agrio Litigation.

At first, the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs send their samples to be tested at a laboratory in the
USA, Analytical Services Inc. However, this proves unsatisfactory because of the time
that samples are held before analysis and also because the samples are inspected upon
entry into the USA, which breaks the chain of custody. The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs then
use the Catolica laboratory in Quito and subsequently a laboratory in Quito called

HAVOC.!? The latter became a subject of major controversy between the parties.

During the course of 2004, Dr Calmbacher carries out judicial inspections at Sacha 6,

Sacha 21, Sacha 94 and Shushufindi 48 for the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs.'°° Later,

Dr Calmbacher testified that certain expert reports submitted in his name by the Lago
Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives during the judicial inspections were falsified by them,
and that the sites that he inspected, in fact, did not indicate a danger to human health or

pose a risk to the environment.!°!

I November 2004: In his email message to Mr Donziger of 1 November 2014, reporting
on sampling analyses, Mr David Russell (of Global Environmental Operations, as one
the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ environmental experts) writes: “... Based upon a meeting in
New York with the Attorneys on Thursday of last week, we need to stop analysing for
BTEX and GRO. TPH and DRO are fine, but the analysis and reporting of GRO and
BTEX data is self-defeating except to show that the contamination is much more recent
that we would desire, and that would lead to an argument that the contamination is by

PetroEcuador rather than Texaco. This is especially true for BTEX Data. ...”.'®

It will be recalled that TexPet had left Ecuador in 1992 and that, ostensibly, the Lago
Agrio Plaintiffs had “waived” their rights against PetroEcuador on 20 November 1996
(see above). PetroEcuador continued operations in the former concession area by itself,

from 1992 onwards.

27 November 2004: The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ Ecuadorian lawyer, Mr Alberto Wray,
writes to Mr Donziger that the first two judicial inspection reports by Dr Calmbacher
show that “hydrocarbons are below detection limits” and do “not help” the Lago Agrio

Plaintiffs’ case. !

27 December 2004: In his memorandum of 27 December 2004 to Mr Donziger, Mr

Russell states, as regards DROs:

“Now what we are analyzing is TPH and DRO. That leaves RRO, GRO, and NNO
as unknowns. If you will recall, we stopped analyzing GRO at Cristobal’s insistence
because it helps Texaco prove their case. The problem comes in when we look for
components of the DROs which are harmful. The PAH, or Polynuclear Aromatic
Hydrocarbon compounds. These compounds are powerful carcinogens, and if
present in quantity would amount to a slam dunk for proving harm to people. The
problem is that so far, they are not there or are not detected, even after we lower
the detection limit ... Right now, we can’t prove harm except by inference and

claims that TPH is harmful, that DRO is harmful, and that RRO.s are harmful. But
the problem is that there is nothing specific.” '*

2005

11 February 2005: Mr Russell notes in an email message dated 11 February 2005 to Mr

Donziger:

“From the data I have seen so far, we are not finding any of the highly carcinogenic
compounds one would hope to find when investigating the oil pits. That does not
discount the findings of the metals, but I fear that may not be enough. I believe that
we need a big smoking gun which will link Chevron-Texaco to cancer in and
through the oil, and not through just the drilling muds and chrome and other heavy
metals. There are two possible reasons for the lack of finding organic carcinogenic
compounds in the oils at this time: 1) the compounds (primarily PAH) have been
fully degraded or 2) because the compounds are soluble, they may have escaped
the pits and are found in the groundwater outside the pit areas. Either or both of
these scenarios are possible. We won’t know until we begin a comprehensive look
for the compounds outside the pit areas, and examine the groundwater closely.” '®

Mr Russell is subsequently dismissed as an expert by Mr Donziger and replaced by
experts from Stratus Consulting. Later, on 14 February 2006, Mr Russell instructs Mr
Donziger to cease using his (Mr Russell’s) original estimate of clean-up costs of US$
6.14 billion because it was “too high by a substantial margin, perhaps by a factor of ten

or more” (see below).

10 August 2005: Dr Martha Escobar Koziel (of the office of the Attorney General of
Ecuador) sends an email message dated 10 August 2005 to Mr Wray, Mr Bonifaz and
others regarding the nullification of the 1995 Settlement Agreement and Final Release,
following a visit by Chevron’s representatives to the President.!©° It states, in material
part:
“On the afternoon of August 8, I was in the Office of the President of the Republic;
Dr Gonzalez, the Legal Undersecretary General, invited me to a meeting to discuss
TEXACO; he confirmed that the previous week (he did not say what day) high-
ranking TEXACO officials had been there; he did not give me names either, but he

indicated that there had been a Brazilian (must be Reis Vega), an Argentine, a
bearded American (he said he was a lawyer), and Dr Pérez (who has always been

the legal representative in Ecuador) and an official from the Ministry of Energy
and Mines (whose name he did not know because he did not leave his card).
According to Dr Gonzalez, he and Max Donoso received them and later they spoke
for a few minutes with the President of the Republic.

In the meeting, both the Ministry official as well as those from Texaco left an “Aide
Memoire” (I have a copy of the Ministry’s, but so far they have not sent me
Texaco’s). The purpose of the visit - says Gonzalez - was to propose that the State
intervene in the Sucumbios trial and allege the existence of the environmental
remediation contract and the final acta de entrega-recepcion [i.e. delivery-receipt],
or that a public declaration be made at the highest levels on the existence and
fulfilment of that contract; in exchange, TEXACO would be willing to drop the
arbitration in New York [i.e. the AAA arbitration]. They also expressed their total
disagreement with the State having contracted lawyers linked to the indigenous
plaintiffs.

According to Dr Gonzalez, both he and the President of the Republic told TEXACO
that they would transmit the proposal to the State’s Attorney General, given that it
is an autonomous entity and they should not confuse the attorney of the State with
the attorney of the President of the Republic, and that the invitation they extended
to me was precisely for that reason.

I explained to Dr Gonzalez that the decision to accept the sponsorship of Terry
Collingsworth and Cristobal was an economic one since it did not cost the State
anything.'°’ With respect to the topic of the contract, I explained that the Attorney
General’s Office and all of us working on the State’s defense were searching for a
way to nullify or undermine the value of the remediation contract and the final acta
and that our greatest difficulty lay in the time that has passed.

I have not managed to speak to the Attorney General since Monday, but I am sure
that he will not accept the proposal. The Attorney General remains resolved to have
the Comptroller’s Office conduct another audit (that also seems unlikely to me
given the time); he wants to criminally try those who executed the contract (that
also seems unlikely to me, since the evidence of criminal liability established by the
Comptroller’s Office was rejected by the prosecutor).”!

4.221. 29 September 2005: In his email message to Mr Kohn, acknowledging the legal
impediment posed by the 1995 Settlement Agreement to the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’
claims, Mr Donziger notes: the “idea is to use it [i.e. fraud] to convince the government

to take action against Chevron to nullify the remediation contract ... this could be very

important.”!® This “remediation contract” was a reference to the 1995 Settlement

 

167 Mr Crist6bal Bonifaz and Mr Terry Collingsworth (representing the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs) were simultaneously
acting for the Republic of Ecuador and PetroEcuador in the legal proceedings in New York to stay the AAA
Arbitration.

Agreement (including the 1998 Final Release); and the “fraud” referred to the criminal
prosecution for fraud against those persons who had signed the 1995 Settlement
Agreement and Final Release (including, particularly, Mr Veiga and Dr Peréz as

TexPet’s representatives).

4 October 2005: Mr Donziger records in his diary that: “We pitched the criminal case
to Archie [Archie Avila, an Ecuadorian lawyer]. Idea to pressure the company, get major
press in US via Lehane [Christopher Lehane, a US attorney], and compel the Ec gov
[Ecuadorian Government] to act against the company legally to nullify the remediation

contract.” !7°

6 October 2005: In his diary, Mr Donziger notes: “The key issue is [the] criminal case.
Can we get that going? What does it mean? I really want to consolidate control with
contract [the 1995 Settlement Agreement] before going down a road that I think could
force them to the table for a possible settlement ... RV [Mr Reis Veiga] likely will be

knocked out of the box by the criminal investigation and being called as a witness.”!7!

18 November 2005: At this time, Mr Donziger agrees to pay covertly, as a bribe, Mr
Fernando Reyes and Mr Gustavo Pinto to act nominally as “independent experts” for
the purpose of monitoring the settling experts, but answerable to him.!”? In his diary
entry for 18 November 2005, Mr Donziger notes: “Deal with Gustavo Pinto — feel like
Thave gone over to the dark side. First meeting like that that I was not eaten alive. Made
modest offer, plus bonus. Agreed to keep it between us, no written agreement.

Independent monitoring.”'”?

From the evidence before the Tribunal, this seems to have been a significant turning-
point for Mr Donziger. Contrary to his inclination, he was doing something that was
manifestly wrong by any standard for the administration of justice; and he knew it.

Wrong as this was, much worse was to follow.

2006

2006: By 2006, Mr Donziger had by now assumed the leading role amongst the
representatives of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs, working closely with Mr Fajardo in

Ecuador.

27 January 2006: 35 of the 123 judicial inspections have been completed. The Lago
Agrio Plaintiffs apply to withdraw from the 26 pending inspections at Sacha Central and
Shushufindi on the basis that these are no longer necessary since “the environmental
and social reality, as well as that of chemical or toxic components reported, is virtually
the same; there are no major differences between one site and any other. From this, it
can be concluded that the defendant Chevron (formerly Texaco) used the same operating
practices at all of the sites in these Sacha and Shushufindi fields, and possibly in the
entire concession area...”. The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs further argue that the “Global
Assessment”, namely the audit of the entire Concession Area requested by them and
ordered by Judge Guerra in his Order of 29 October 2003, would provide a detailed and

complete study of each site affected by Texaco.!”

J February 2006: A settling expert report is made on the judicial inspection of a former
concession site that TexPet had remediated under the 1995 Settlement Agreement,
Sacha 53.'7° The settling experts who reviewed the parties’ experts’ reports on Sacha
53 conclude that the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs had failed to substantiate their claims of
environmental contamination. They found that TexPet’s remediation was adequately
performed and met Ecuadorian standards. They could not attribute to TexPet
unremediated oil contamination near Sacha 53, which could have been caused by
PetroEcuador after it assumed operations as “Operator” in 1990. This was the only site

report made by the settling experts.

Dr Ramiro Fernando Reyes Cisneros was a petroleum and environmental engineer
retained by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs. In February and March 2006, Dr Reyes attends
several meetings with representatives of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs, including Mr
Donziger, Mr Fajardo and Mr Yanza. Later, in 2012, Dr Reyes testifies in the US Section
1782 Litigation:

“In these meetings Mr Donziger was very upset by the findings of the settling
experts’ report [on Sacha 53], and he complained that the report supported
Chevron’s position and did not support the plaintiffs’ position ... During our
discussions, Mr Donzinger told us that our report should establish that the findings
of the settling experts’ report on Sacha 53 were wrong, that they lacked objectivity
and were biased toward Chevron, and therefore the report should be discounted.
However, in my professional opinion the evidence did not support Mr Donziger’s
position and I could not twist my professional assessments to make them fit the
plaintiffs’ interests ... Mr Donziger expressed disappointment with our report and
never asked us to submit it to the Court.”'7°

14 February 2006: By letter dated 14 February 2006, Mr David Russell instructs Mr
Donziger that he should not use his name as an expert supporting the quantum of the
Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ case; namely US$ 6.14 billion for clean-up costs (see above). His

letter states:

“To date I have seen no data which would indicate that there is any significant
surface or groundwater contamination caused by petroleum sources in Ecuador.
Moreover, there was not, and is not any effort being made by the Plaintiffs in
Aguinda vs Texaco to characterize the groundwater or the surface waters. As I
recall there was substantial opposition by Cristobal [Bonifaz] toward doing any
work in this area because of the costs of the Investigation. As the surface and
groundwater cleanup represent a very large portion of the cost estimate, (over
half), this further invalidates the 2003 cost estimate. As such, it would cause me to
state that the 2003 cost estimate is too high by a substantial margin, perhaps by a
factor of ten, or more.”

In his later affidavit sworn on 8 May 2013, Mr David Russell testified: “As the lead
environmental scientist for the plaintiffs in their case against Chevron in Ecuador [from
late 2003 to early 2005], I spent several months investigating the environment at the oil
production sites in the Oriente. I found that the environmental evidence did not and does
not support the plaintiffs’ claims. I saw no evidence of any widespread health effects
caused by oil contamination from Texaco, and no evidence of drinking water
contaminated with petroleum from Texaco’s operations ... there was no evidence
linking residents’ health problems to Texaco operations. The idea that the cleanup of

the oil pits in the area would require billions of dollars is nonsense.”!””

March 2006ff: During his period in office for the Lago Agrio Litigation (see above),

Judge Yanez holds private meetings with Messrs Donziger and Fajardo nine times or

more during 2006 and 2007, at his house, a warehouse and elsewhere, to discuss the
withdrawal of judicial inspections and the appointment of a sole global expert. In March
2006, Mr Donziger notes in his diary that: “... due to some good strategising and some
counter-pressure, the court is now in play, up for grabs, and accessible.”!”* These

meetings were not disclosed to or known by Chevron at the time.

4 March 2006: Mr Fajardo reports to his legal colleagues by email dated 4 March 2006
that Judge Yanez had told him that the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ request to withdraw [i.e.

terminate] the judicial inspections had “no legal basis.”!”

8 March 2006: At a judicial inspection of the Sacha Sur Station, Mr Donziger and
a group of protesters are excluded from the site by police. Mr Donziger insists that the
people had a right to enter and demanded that Judge Yanez come to the gate to “enforce

the law”. Mr Donziger warns that: “they’re provoking a violent incident.” !*°

11 March 2006: Mr Donziger describes a private meeting with Judge Yanez on the day

before the San Carlos judicial inspection.!*! He notes in his diary:

“These judges are really not very bright — it is like a vocational job to them, they
deal with resolving disputes at a very basic level, there is little or no intellectual
component to the law... The concepts of tort law and joint and several liability are
acceptable in Ecuador, but nobody uses them, so judges have no exposure to them.
That part of the case is a real uphill battle. But I keep thinking of what Mateo'**
told me - the only way we will win this case is if the judge thinks he will be doused
with gasoline and burned if he rules against us. Given the morality or immorality
of Ecuador’s justice system, that type of comment did not even shock me. It is part
of the rules of the game here.”

In his later US deposition, Mr Donziger testifies: “I remember being shocked by
Mateo’s statement. I never thought that he meant it literally. But I did think that he meant
it in the sense that there was a general feeling among the people we worked with that
Chevron had bought the court and bought the judges based on their long history of the

way they operated in Ecuador. '* And we needed to be aware of that to combat that kind

of institutional corruption.”'** When pressed on this inconsistency, Mr Donziger
testified: “People can change their opinions, sir. I remember specifically when he told
me that being shocked. When I reflected on it and understood how I felt the Ecuadorian
legal system had been abused by Texaco and Chevron over a period of decades, I think

I changed my opinion when I wrote that.” !8>

11 March 2006: In this diary entry, Mr Donziger also describes another private meeting
with Judge Yanez: “— had lunch with him the previous Friday in the Cangrejo Rojo I
love it — this lobbying. I am good at it. But I hate it, hate that it is necessary, hate that it
is part of the legal culture... I think it runs counter to any good person... I gave the
judge a one-page memo on the law, and showed him the graphs from SA-53, the site
where the peritos had derimido supposedly. We talked about the theory, about the need
to let the people in San Carlos speak, about the need not to cancel the inspection, to not
have another Guanta.”'®° This conversation and documentation was not disclosed to or

known by Chevron at the time.

11 March 2006: Mr Donziger’s diary records that “Bonifax fired”.'*7 This was a
reference to Mr Cristébal Bonifaz, being dismissed as a legal representative of the Lago

Agrio Plaintiffs.

30 March 2006: Chevron had filed a motion before the Ecuadorian judge in Quito on
24 March 2006, seeking an order for the judicial inspection of the HAVOC laboratory.
This laboratory was analysing the soil and water samples which the Lago Agrio
Plaintiffs had obtained from TexPet’s sites in the former concession area. Mr Donziger
asserts, privately on camera: “They’re trying to harass the lab out of business, and
extract information that they can use, you know, as part of their publicity campaign to
damage the lab and get rid of its clients...”'** On this day, Mr Donziger explains
privately on camera: “...we’re going down and we’re gonna confront the judge, who we
believe is paid by Texaco; we believe he is corrupt, and we’re gonna confront him,
uh...with — with our ...suspicions about his corruption, and let him know what time it

is.”!8 Mr Donziger states, again privately on camera, “This is something that you would

never do in the United States. I mean, this is something you would — I mean, this is just
out of bounds, both in terms of judicial behaviour, and what — what lawyers would do.
But Ecuador, you know, there’s almost no rules here. And this is how the game is played,
it’s dirty.”'°° Mr Donziger continues, privately on camera: “So we are going down to

have a little chat with the judge today, we’ll see what happens”. !?!

30 March 2006: Mr Donziger further explains, privately on camera: “... this is part —
this is one more battle, it’s been going on now for several weeks: we’ve already met
with the judge [in Quito] once, we’re meeting with him again. And the only language
that I believe this judge is gonna understand is one of pressure, intimidation and
humiliation. And that’s what we’re doing today. ... We’re going to scare the judge, I
think today. We’re gonna let him know what time it is. I hate doing it. I hate doing this
stuff. I don’t feel comfortable doin’ it. As a lawyer I never do this. You don’t have to
do it in the United States. It’s, it’s dirty. I hate it. Hate it, but it’s necessary. I’m not

lettin’ ‘em get away with this stuff.”!°?

There is no justification for Mr Donziger’s improper conduct. There may, however, be
one or more explanations. It is possible to infer, at least until this time, that Mr Donziger
honestly believed that Chevron was misconducting itself in much the same way towards
the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs, and to greater effect. From all the evidence seen by the
Tribunal, however, there was no reasonable basis for Mr Donziger’s belief (if it existed)

that Chevron was conducting itself improperly in the Lago Agrio Litigation.

There is another possible explanation. It was Texaco that had ensured that the Aguinda
Complaint be stayed in New York in favour of Ecuadorian jurisdiction. As Mr Donziger
and his colleagues knew, that jurisdiction was not chosen by Texaco because it feared

the Ecuadorian legal system or the Government of Ecuador (as then constituted).

Mr Wray, as the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ senior legal representative (until 2005/2006),
testified in the US 1782 Litigation, in 2010:!°

“\.. since the beginning of the case and it was clear that the respondents’ strategies
consisted of blaming PetroEcuador of the contamination, I believed it was
necessary for PetroEcuador to appear in the case as a third party defending itself

from the accusations made by Texaco. When the case started, it was not possible to
have any relationship with the government with PetroEcuador, at least for myself.
Iwas very critical and actually I opposed the government at that time so that in the
beginning it was not possible to do it. Moreover, it was clear that just as soon as
the case began, that at that time PetroEcuador’s authorities were rather inclined
towards favoring the respondents, and this became clear of some statements, and I
don’t remember if it was made by either the Minister of Energy or Ecuador’s
President. And because of the fact of the legal team defended Texaco at that time
was getting the clear support of the government at the time, at least to the extent
that they were able to or they allowed them to -- to reside within a military complex
in Lago Agrio when all the judicial inspections began. So meanwhile the team of
the petitioners, the claimants, us, had to -- had to stay at hotels in the area or rent
an apartment for the case. The Chevron/Texaco team was staying within a military
government complex ...”.

Following Mr Correa’s election as President of Ecuador in January 2007, Chevron’s
relations with the Respondent’s Government were to undergo a significant change, for

the worse.

Returning to the events of 30 March 2006 regarding the HAVOC laboratory, Mr
Donziger brings video cameras into the chambers of the judge hearing the parties’
dispute in Quito. Mr Donziger there tells the judge that Texaco’s lawyers were “playing
dirty” and “trying to corrupt the legal process...”. Mr Donziger repeatedly accuses Dr
Larrea, one of Chevron’s lawyers, of being “a corrupt attorney”.'°* The judge suspends
the hearing, which appears from the video to have become unruly resulting from Mr

Donziger’s aggressive conduct. '°>

Mr Donziger later states, privately on camera, that: “the judicial system here is so utterly
weak ... [T]he only way that you can secure a fair trial is if you do things like that ...
like go in and confront the judge with media around. And fight and yell and scream and
make a scene.” !°° In Mr Donziger’s own words, what he achieved “would never happen

in any judicial system that had integrity.”!°7

In his US deposition in the RICO Litigation, Mr Donziger is asked about this incident:

Q: Did you pressure the judge in Ecuador who had approved the inspection of
HAVOC Lab to change his opinion? A: I wouldn’t characterise it as pressure. We
went in and felt like he had made a decision that had no legal basis and had been

done ex parte and we wanted to be heard. So members of our legal team, including
myself, went to his office in a scene that is depicted in the movie Crude, to try to
persuade him to cancel his order.

Q: And going into that meeting didn’t you say that you understood the only

language the judge would understand was pressure, intimidation and humiliation?

A: I don’t know. What I did, though, was entirely proper and was captured in the
je, 198

movie.

30 March 2006: Mr Donziger, privately on camera, further asserts that Texaco’s lawyers
had “got to that judge first ... I believe they have paid him, and paid the secretary,
probably a hundred bucks ... And they signed these illegal documents forcing an
inspection of a lab, in an effort to destroy our case.” Mr Donziger continues: “if it turns
out that if a thousand people need to come up from Quito and surround that lab to
prevent this inspection from happening, we’ll consider doing it. ‘Cause this is hand-to-

hand combat.”!?

Later, in his US deposition in the RICO Litigation, Mr Donziger was asked whether he
had any evidence that the Quito judge had received monies from Chevron in return for

ordering the inspection of the HAVOC laboratory. Mr Donziger testified:

“\.. A: We believed the judge was corrupt, but we didn’t have evidence he had
actually been paid.

Q: Did you have any factual basis for believing the judge was corrupt? A: Yes.

Q: What was your factual basis? A: His decision was illegal, inappropriate,
bizarre, irregular, and fit into Chevron’s — what we believe was Chevron’s corrupt

scheme to intimidate the court. And the whole thing we believed was corrupt. So
therefore, since he did it, we believed he was corrupt”?

(This Tribunal has been shown no evidence that the Quito judge was corrupted by

Chevron, as alleged by Mr Donziger or otherwise).

30 March 2006: Mr Donziger states, privately on camera: “We have concluded that we

need to do more, politically, to control the court, to pressure the court. We believe they

make decisions based on who they fear the most, not based on what the laws

should dictate.”?°!

5 April 2006: Ms Leila Salazar, one of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives
privately tells Mr Donziger and Mr Alejandro Ponce that the judge would “be killed” if
he rules in favour of Chevron, as recorded on camera. Mr Donziger replies, “[h]e might
not be, but ... he thinks he will be. Which is just as good.” Mr Donziger further states,
“[The judges] don’t have to be intelligent enough to understand the law, just as long as

they understand the politics.”7°

30 May 2006: A meeting is held between Messrs Donziger, Fajardo and others
representing the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs to decide whether to petition the Lago Agrio
Court for a global expert. Mr Donziger notes: “Pablo [Fajardo] and our legal team keep
insisting that the solution is for the judge (then Judge Yanez) to appoint someone who

is favorable to us ... I don’t trust this approach, given our experience so far.”?°

2 June 2006: Mr Donziger notes in his diary: “I told them we need a massive protest on
the court, and only after that should we talk to the judge [Judge Yanez] about what he
needs to do. The judge needs to fear us for this to move how it needs to move, and right

now there is no fear, no price to pay for not making these key decisions.”?°*

8 June 2006: The Lago Agrio Court (Judge Yanez) denies the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’
request to terminate the judicial inspections and sets dates for “the performance of
judicial inspections in June and July [2006] ... in response to the requests of both parties.
The Court may subsequently order performance of the requested proceedings that

remain pending in this document.”?°>

14 June 2006: By email to Mr Alejandro Villacis, Mr Donziger calls for the preparation
of “a detailed plan with the necessary steps to attack the judge [Judge Yanez] through

legal, institutional channels and through any other channel you can think of.”?°°

19 June 2006: The Lago Agrio Court (Judge Yanez) denies the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’
request to terminate the judicial inspections a second time, again citing the parties’

agreement for such inspections.7°”

. 21 July 2006: By this date, 42 of the 123 judicial inspections requested by the parties

have been completed. The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs apply to the Lago Agrio Court, to waive
their right to carry out “at this stage of the lawsuit” the judicial inspections requested by
them at Sacha, Aguarico, Guanta, Auca, Cononaco, Lago Agrio, Yuca and

Parahuaco Fields.”

. 25 July 2006: Mr Donziger notes in his diary: “Our issues first and foremost are whether

the judge [Judge Yanez] will accept the renuncia of the inspections. ... If it doesn’t

happen, then we are in all-out war with the judge to get him removed.”

25 July 2006: In his diary, on the same day, Mr Donziger notes:?!° “... At which pt I
launched into my familiar lecture about how the only way the court will respect us is if
they fear us — and that the only way they will fear us is if they think we have come
control over their careers, their jobs, their reputations — that is to say, their ability to earn

a livelihood.”

26 July 2006: Mr Donziger writes in his email message to Mr Kohn (of Kohn, Swift &
Graf) in the USA, entitled “Potentially Huge”: “Pablo [Fajardo] met with the judge
today [Judge Yanez]. The judge, who is on his heels from the charges of trading jobs
for sex in the court, said he is going to accept our request to withdraw the rest of the
inspections. ... The judge also I believe wants to forestall the filing of a complaint

against him by us, which we have prepared but not yet filed.”?!!

This was a private meeting between Judge Yanez and Mr Fajardo not known by or
disclosed to Chevron at the time. Judge Yanez’ decision to accede to the Lago Agrio

Plaintiffs’ applications was the direct result of the blackmail committed by Mr Fajardo,

Agrio Plaintiffs.

22 August 2006: By court order, the Lago Agrio Court (Judge Yanez) terminates the
remaining 64 judicial inspections, in response to the application made by the Lago Agrio

Plaintiffs and opposed by Chevron.?!?

13 September 2006: Mr Donziger notes in his diary: “Legal case: going well with
[Judge] Yanez decision to cancel inspections ... We wrote up a complaint against
‘Yanez, but never filed it, while letting him know we might file it if he does not adhere
to the law and what we need ...”.7!3

11 October 2006: In a private meeting (not known by or disclosed to Chevron at the
time), Judge Yanez tells Mr Fajardo that he would not permit Chevron to assert any
further challenges to the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ request for the waiver (i.e. termination)
of judicial inspections. Mr Fajardo reports by email to Mr Donziger: “The President [of
the Court] was clear and said that he will not permit any further collateral issues about

the waiver of our inspections.”?!+

3 November 2006: In an email message to Mr Neil Mitchell of Winston & Strawn (as
lawyers acting for Ecuador in the USA), relating to Mr Reis Veiga’s deposition in the
USA, Mr Donziger writes: “It would help us for you to keep RV [Mr Veiga] on the hot
seat for as long as possible and press him in a number of areas that will make him
uncomfortable... Remember, the info on the fraud issue is still useful for us in Lago and
in the ongoing criminal investigation in Ecuador — thus, if you could put on the
‘investigatory’ hat in this regard that would be helpful. The way to justify it is that this
all goes to his credibility...”?!> As Mr Donziger knew, this “fraud issue” and “criminal
investigation” impugned the legal validity of the 1995 Settlement Agreement signed by
Mr Veiga and Dr Pérez, which the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs were seeking to negate in the

Lago Agrio Litigation.

of Mr Cabrera as the Court’s sole global assessment expert: “I see using E-tech [E-Tech,
a firm of environmental experts acting for the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs] to give him cover,
but he has to totally play ball with us and let us take the lead while projecting the image

that he is working for the court.”?!7

in the global expert assessment.?!°

19 January 2007: Mr Donziger notes in his diary: “Met with the judge [Judge Yanez]
last night in house. Humble house, furniture. Made tea. I really like the guy. Remember
last August I wanted to ride the wave and get him off the case? This was an example of
Pablo’s [Pablo Fajardo] total intelligence. We saved him, and now we are reaping the
benefits.”?”° Mr Donziger also notes, in the same diary entry: “Guerra will be the judge
to decide the case. We have to start lobbying him, working with him.” None of this was

disclosed to or known by Chevron at the time.

3 March 2007: The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives, including Messrs Donziger
and Fajardo, and their experts meet (privately) Mr Cabrera, as the Court’s sole global
assessment expert in the Lago Agrio Litigation soon to be formally appointed by the

Lago Agrio Court (Judge Yanez).

At this meeting, recorded privately on film, Mr Fajardo identifies six steps that the Lago
Agrio Plaintiffs should take, specifically: (1) “[k]eep up the pressure and constant
oversight in the court”; (2) “[m]ake certain that the expert [i.e. Mr Cabrera] constantly
coordinates with the plaintiffs’ technical and legal team”; (3) “[t]he plaintiffs’ technical
coordinator must be [involved] in the process fulltime” and “[a]Jccompany the expert in
the field’; (4) “an attorney ... will always be in the field to also protect the activity being
performed”; (5) “provide the facilities and necessary support to the field team”; and (6)

“support the expert in writing the report.”

Mr Fajardo emphasises that the entire Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ team must contribute to
the Cabrera report, explaining: “And here is where we do want the support of our entire
technical team ... of experts, scientists, attorneys, political scientists, so that all will
contribute to that report—in other words—you see ... the work isn’t going to be the

expert’s. All of us bear the burden.”

One of the meeting’s participants then asks whether the final report would be prepared
by the expert (i.e. Mr Cabrera). Mr Fajardo states that the expert will “sign the report
and review it. But all of us ... have to contribute to that report.” Dr Anne Maest (of
Stratus Consulting) asks, “together?”, which Mr Fajardo confirms. Dr Maest then says,
“But not Chevron,” to which everyone laughs.”?* Towards the end of the meeting, Mr

Donziger states: “We could jack this thing up to thirty billion dollars in one day.”?>

The same meeting is described by Mr Donziger in his diary, as follows:

“\.. Technical meeting on Sat in office: Richard [Cabrera] there. Sat had all-day
Tech meeting in the office - unusual for a ‘dia laboral’ as Pablo [Fajardo] put it.

Champ [Charlie Kamp]. Pablo delivered first; excellent, then Olga Lucia, the best
I have seen her; then Champ. Great spirit and energy in the room. It made me
realize how much we have accomplished. ... I spend the whole day making
comments and mostly directing them to Richard. We laid out our entire case and
legal theory - what a benefit! We need to do the same with the judge ...”.?>4

No-one present at this meeting could have misunderstood the plan, namely to have Mr
Cabrera formally appointed as the sole expert to the Lago Agrio Court, for the Lago
Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives and advisers (but not Mr Cabrera) covertly to write the
Cabrera Report and to disguise that report, dishonestly, as the work of Mr Cabrera.
Astonishingly, all this was willingly recorded on film by the meeting’s participants,
including Mr Cabrera, Mr Fajardo and Mr Donziger. Needless to say, none of this was

disclosed to or known by Chevron at the time.

4 March 2007: Mr Donziger and the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ US experts meet to discuss
their private meeting held with Mr Cabrera on the previous day. The experts include Dr
Maest, Dr Kamp and Mr Champ. The meeting appears to have taken place in a restaurant
(as privately recorded on film). These experts advise Mr Donziger that no evidence of
groundwater contamination exists. Dr Maest states: “And right now all the reports are
saying it’s just at the pits and the stations and nothing has spread anywhere at all’”.?25
Mr Donziger replies: “Hold on a second, you know, this is Ecuador, okay? ... You can
say whatever you want and at the end of the day, there’s a thousand people around the
courthouse, you’re going to get what you want ... And we can get money for it ...
Because at the end of the day, this is all for the Court just a bunch of smoke and mirrors

and bullshit. It really is. We have enough, to get money, to win.”?°

In his US deposition, Mr Donziger was asked whether when he made this statement he
believed it to be true. He testified: “I think I made that statement for dramatic effect”.??”

The Tribunal does not understand this explanation.

The participants in the meeting later discuss whether it would be helpful to test a specific
site and the particular manner of doing it, also as privately recorded on film. Mr Champ

states “I know we have to be totally transparent with Chevron in showing them what we

everything we do”. Dr Maest then suggests “Yeah, we don’t have to give them our plan.
I don’t think, do we? Mr Donziger replies “Well, it’s a little unclear. Nobody’s ever
done this before. This is so crazy. Our goal is that they don’t know shit - and that’s why
they’re so panicked - there’s no way they can control this, because they didn’t ask for
it7?28
4 March 2007: During a discussion with the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ experts (except Mr
Champ) following the above meeting, Mr Donziger explains as privately recorded on
film, “If we have a legitimate fifty billion dollar damage claim, and they end up - judge
says, well, I can’t give them less than five billion. ... And, say, [Chevron] had a huge

victory; they knocked out ninety per cent of the damage claim.”?”°

6 March 2007: During a meeting with Stratus Consulting and others (including
Dr Maest), Mr Donziger states, as privately recorded on film: “Now, I once worked for
a lawyer who said something I’ve never forgotten. He said, ‘Facts do not exist. Facts
are created.’” Everyone laughs. Mr Donziger continues, “[a]nd ever since that day, I

realized how the law works.””°°

19 March 2007: The Lago Agrio Court (Judge Yanez) formally appoints Mr Cabrera as
the sole expert for conducting the global expert assessment upon the request of the Lago

Agrio Plaintiffs, opposed by Chevron.?*!

20 March 2007: A meeting takes place between President Correa with members of the
Ecuadorian Government, including the Environment Minister, Ms Anita Alban, Mr
Xavier Garaicoa Ortiz (of the Procuradurfa General); Mr Alexis Mera (the President’s
legal adviser), PetroEcuador and representatives of the ADF and the Lago Agrio
Plaintiffs, Mr Yanza, Mr Ponce, Ms Yepez and Ms Lupita Heredia.?**

“... The Prez [President Correa] was very upset at Texaco. He asked the Attorney
General to do everything necessary to win the trial and the arbitration in the U.S.
He asked his team to urgently work on the matter. This Saturday he will report on
the matter on national television. Officially now at that time he will clarify several
points in order not to hurt us in the trial. He ordered that a cabinet be formed in
the Amazon, inviting or bringing the press so they can visit the places affected by
Texaco with his team. He also said that he would like to figure out a legal and
judicial way to try Texaco for genocide. He gave us fabulous support. He even said
that he would call the judge. I don’t know if this could also hurt us, but the attorneys
and Luis [Yanza] have to pay closer attention to delicate matters.”

The Tribunal has seen no evidence that the Respondent’s President (or any officer on

his behalf) called any judge at the Lago Agrio Court, then or later.

26 March 2007: In his email messages to Mr Donziger dated 26 March 2007, Mr Fajardo
refers to Judge Yanez as the “cook,” the Lago Agrio Court’s global assessment expert,
Mr Cabrera, as the “waiter”, the “menu” as the work plan, the “other restaurant” as

Chevron, and the “messenger” as Mr Fajardo:”?*4

“Today the cook met with the waiter to coordinate the menu. What is new is that in
view of the other restaurant’s challenge, the cook has the idea of putting in another
waiter, to be on the other side. This is troublesome. I suggest we activate alarms,
contacts, strategies, pressures in order to avoid this happening. It is necessary to
do it urgently.”

“The Lago Agrio messenger is waiting to meet this afternoon with the cook, to listen
to his position. I suggest that the heads of Quito, Lago Agrio and NY talk at six
thirty, Ecuador time. By this time the messenger will already have some news
regarding what the cook is saying.”

Mr Donziger later confirmed in his testimony at the RICO trial that the “cook” referred
to Judge Yanez, the “waiter” referred to Mr Cabrera, and the “other restaurant” referred
to Chevron.” He also confirmed that the appointment of a second global assessment
expert, as intimated by Judge Yanez, was (in the words of his email to Mr Fajardo)
“unacceptable”. No such second expert is appointed by the Lago Agrio Court. None of

this was disclosed to or known by Chevron at the time.

29 March 2007: In advising the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs during a private meeting,
President Correa’s legal adviser, Mr Alexis Mera, recommends that the Lago Agrio

Plaintiffs pressure the Prosecutor-General to “reopen” the investigation: “you have to

take the people from the Orient[e] there [the Public Prosecutor’s Office], hold a

Plaintiffs’ representatives tell Mr Mera that “although we could mobilize people, the —
the official nature of the President could do much more in this case ... an interest by the
Executive Branch - and pressure on the Public Prosecutor’s Office ... could do a lot on
this subject.” When the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives continue to press that the
Executive Branch’s involvement would have a “political impact” on the case, Mr Mera

agrees, saying: “I do understand the whole political thing.”?*°

27 April 2007: President Correa visits the former concession area in the Oriente, with
Mr Fajardo and Mr Yanza. (Mr Donziger is not present). Shortly thereafter, the
President calls for the criminal prosecution of the Ecuadorian Government’s officials
who signed the 1995 Settlement Agreement and also of TexPet’s representatives, i.e.

Mr Veiga and Dr Pérez (see the Criminal Prosecutions above).

6 June 2007: During a meeting of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ advisers, recorded privately
on film, Mr Donziger proposes to “take over the [Lago Agrio] court with a massive
protest,” in order to “shut the court down for a day.” He states that there was an
“institutional weakness in the judiciary,” and that “they [the judges] make decisions
based on who they fear [the] most.”??” Mr Donziger also describes, privately on film,
the “need to make facts ... that help us” even though “the facts that we need don’t

always exist.”?78

7 June 2007: Mr Fajardo states, privately on film, that the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs need to
increase pressure on the Lago Agrio Court to swear in Mr Cabrera: “the judge [i.e. now

Judge Yanez] is scared shitless.” ?°°

13 June 2007: Less than one week later, the Lago Agrio Court (Judge Yanez) swears in
Mr Cabrera as the Court’s sole “global assessment expert”. At this ceremony, Mr
Cabrera takes an oath “to perform his duties faithfully” and “with complete impartiality

and independence” from the disputing parties.“° Mr Cabrera was thereby to act as a

court expert, appointed by the Lago Agrio Court to act as a neutral expert to the Court.

This was not to be.

13 June 2007: Mr Donziger states privately on film that Judge Yanez “never would have
[appointed Mr Cabrera] had we not really pushed him.” He then states: “It’s just like —
you know? ... All of this bullshit about the law and the facts — and it factors into it
because it affects the level of force... At the end of the day, it is about brute force, who
could apply the pressure and who could withstand the pressure and can you get them to
the breaking point ...”.?4!

When asked about this statement in his US deposition, Mr Donziger testified that
he made it for “dramatic effect’.?4? Again, the Tribunal does not understand
this explanation. Nonetheless, the Tribunal infers that Mr Donziger’s reference to “brute
force” and “breaking point” includes the improper treatment to which Judge Yanez was
deliberately subjected by Mr Donziger and his colleagues, without which Judge Yanez

would not have appointed Mr Cabrera as the Court’s sole Global Assessment expert.

4 July 2007: Mr Cabrera ostensibly begins work as the designated sole global

assessment expert to the Lago Agrio Court, with his technical team.

17 July 2007: Mr Donziger sends an email message to Mr Fajardo: “Ideas para reunion

con Richard [Cabrera]”.”*? It reads:
“Commanders of the Urban and North Front:
These are the fastest ideas:

1) That we think that Richard should suspend his work in the field and we should
not pay the team until after the recess. We just need him to tell the team and Texaco
that he’s going to start all over after the recess so there is nothing strange,
everything appears normal.

2) When I get there, we'll re analyze the work and the budget with Richard. And
we Il adjust with a much smaller team. My tendency is to stop Richard from working
much more in the field... or, if he continues doing it, he should continue under the

most Strict control with an extremely limited number of samples. And we’ll change
the focus of the data at our offices.

3) It is key to have deadlines to receive drafts from all the consultants, such as the
biologists, the water man, and so on. Personally, I don’t want to wait for the ‘final’
product to determine if the work is useful or not, or we will be screwed because
they will ask for even more money to make the changes if we are not properly
informed of everything during the process.

4) The main problem with Richard is the lack of money and the distraction of the
most important proof of the case, that is, the 80,000 chemical results that we
already have. The most important thing of the field is the subterranean water and I
think that we don’t even have that planned, and now I’m worried because we don’t
have the money to do it.

I think that, without realizing it, we are being quite similar to the style of
Wray/Pareja/Russell, that is, we are trying to do too much, producing waste and
delaying for lack of budget, and, without realizing it, we are helping the enemy’s
strategy of delaying the trial.

Ill talk to you later on the phone. It is all about money, I know, but it is also about
strategy.

Thank you, my bosses.

23 July 2007: Mr Cabrera’s letter to the Lago Agrio Court denies that he has “any
relation or agreements with the plaintiff;” and he states that “it seems to me to be an

insult against me that I should be linked with the attorneys of the plaintiffs.”?4+

3 September 2007: Chevron again seeks inspections of the HAVOC Lab, which had
been ordered by the Quito Court. Mr Donziger explains in an email message to Mr
Fajardo and others: “An inspection of [the HAVOC Lab] would be a disaster for the
Lago Agrio case. ... I say that we ... accuse all of them, including the judge [i.e. the
Judge in Quito], of corruption for still even thinking of ordering an illegal inspection
with no basis in the law in order to favour a corrupt transnational that is killing innocent
Ecuadorians.””45 (It is not entirely clear to the Tribunal exactly why such an inspection

would have been a “disaster” for the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ case).

By now, the Lago Plaintiffs’ representatives maintain a “secret” bank account at the
Banco Pichincha for the purpose of making covert payments to Mr Cabrera.”“° This was
one of the accounts used by Selva Viva, an Ecuadorian legal entity controlled by certain
of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives for the purpose of the Lago Agrio
Litigation. Mr Donziger is the president of Selva Viva. One of its employees involved
in banking transactions, is Ms Ximera Centeno. The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ internal
documents identify her as the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ librarian, receptionist and payment
administrator.?4” (As described below, Ms Centeno also made monetary deposits to Mr

Guerra on behalf the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives).

12 September 2007: The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives are now paying more
than US$ 100,000 to Mr Cabrera through the “secret” bank account, including a single
payment of US$ 30,000.48 As Mr Yanza states in an email message of 12 September
2007 to Mr Donziger:

“\.. [think we should plan ahead and not give those Texaco bastards the pleasure,
using the same mechanism from weeks ago, that is, he [Mr Kohn] sends us money
to our secret account, to give to Wuao [Mr Cabrera], [to] not stop the work. I
estimate it will be about 30,000, but since there are expenses from the last work day
in the south, it might be another 20,000. In any case, this money will then be
reimbursed to SV [Selva Viva] once the judge orders us to pay. To conclude, please
explain this situation to JK [Mr Kohn] so he can transfer 30 [US$ 30,000] to our
Secret Account and 20 to SV, but he could send the 50 to the secret account and
then we could pass the 20 to SV to save time and paperwork. I know it’s difficult for
you to be dealing with JK about money all the time, but it is necessary and urgent
to solve this to prevent those bastards from having the pleasure. Call us in 5
minutes.....”

At the RICO trial in New York, Mr Donziger testified that he could not recall “any other

purpose for which this secret account was established”, other than to pay Mr Cabrera.”°°

On the evidence adduced in this arbitration, the Tribunal finds that these payments to
Mr Cabrera were made corruptly as bribes by certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’

representatives, including Mr Fajardo, Mr Yanza and Mr Donziger.

3 October 2007: The Lago Agrio Court (now Judge Novillo) orders Mr Cabrera to be
“responsible for the entire report, the methodology used, for the work done by his
assistants, etc.” The Court also orders Mr Cabrera to “observe and ensure ... the
impartiality of his work, and the transparency of his activities as a professional
appointed by ... the court”. The Court states that the role of the expert was one of
complete impartiality and transparency with respect to the parties and their attorneys.
The Court also states that Mr Cabrera “... is an auxiliary to the Court for purposes of
providing to the process and to the Court scientific elements for determining

the truth.”25!

In his capacity as the sole global assessment expert, Mr Cabrera was at all material times
an auxiliary associate of the Lago Agrio Court and, thus, an officer of the Respondent’s
judicial branch. He was not permitted under Ecuadorian law to be the representative of

or adviser to any disputing party to the Lago Agrio Litigation.

11 October 2007: Further questions arise from Chevron as to the independence of Mr

Cabrera from the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives. On 11 October 2007, Mr

2
252

Cabrera files a formal signed statement addressed to the Lago Agrio Court Tt reads

(inter alia) as follows:

“(1) It is public knowledge that various questions have been raised with regard to
my appointment, my work and the other technical officers that are working on the
expert examination.

(2) Your Honor, being the professional that I am and in compliance with the orders
issued by you regarding my designation, confirmation and acceptance of my
appointment as Expert, I have performed my work with absolute impartiality,
honesty, transparency and professionalism.

(3) I reject the descriptions or attacks that have been leveled against me alleging
that I am biased toward one of the parties, and I also reject the unfounded
accusations that I am performing my work surreptitiously. That is completely
untrue. Both sides to this case have witnessed, on a daily basis, the sampling work
performed, the sampling procedure employed, the number of samples collected, in
addition to other activities.

 

251 C.364, p. 2.
252. €.367, p. 2.

Part IV - Page 82

(4) I have complied with your orders and have provided sufficient advance notice
to both litigating parties under the same conditions with regard to the sites where
I planned to collect samples or perform the respective study.

(5) Furthermore, both parties were initially signing the sample control sheet, but
during the sampling process, first the defendant refused to sign that document, and
then the plaintiff also refused to sign. I could not, in my capacity as an expert,
obligate the parties to sign said document.

(6) The task assigned to me includes evaluating the damage sustained by waters,
soils, plant cover and fauna, among other activities. It is clear that I could not
perform a job of this magnitude alone, and have therefore employed several
technical officers and experts to perform these tasks under my coordination and
responsibility. Once I submit my report to this court, Your Honor, the names of all
of the technical officers that have collaborated in the study under my responsibility
will be made public. Thus far, Your Honor, all I have done is attempt to plan and
conduct the expert examination in the most complete, efficient and professional
manner possible.”

4.307. In particular, as to his alleged relationship with the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs, Mr Cabrera

declares to the Lago Agrio Court:

“The defendant’s attorneys allege that the plaintiff [sic: plaintiffs] is in ‘close
contact’ with me, and that the plaintiff has provided me with technical information
and support staff to assist with the expert examination. This is untrue. If I need any
technical information in connection with this case, all I have to do is request it from
this Court; the idea that the plaintiffs would be helping me with that is unthinkable.
With regard to personnel, I admit that initially, a person associated with the
plaintiff did provide me with logistical support for the expert examination, but this
has had no bearing on the core subjects of the expert examination, and therefore
no influence or actual relationship exists. After the first days, I decided to rectify
this situation and not allow any person associated with the parties to participate in
my work in order to avoid absurd or ill-intentioned comments.

Worse still is the accusation of the plaintiff's [sic: “defendants” ] attorneys that the
conduct of the other technical officers is a ‘decoy’, a ploy to conceal preexisting
information provided by the plaintiff that I allegedly will simply attach to my expert
report. I condemn this assertion because it has no basis and there is no evidence to
support it, and I demand that these attorneys refrain from saying these kinds of
things about me in the future.”

4.308. These statements of impartiality and independence from the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’

representatives were made falsely by Mr Cabrera.

4.309. 2 January 2008: In his email message dated 2 January 2008 (headed “Necessary Tasks
to be Completed in the Year 2008” and “Specific Tasks”) to Messrs Donziger, Saenz,
Prieto, Yanza, Ponce and Alexandra Anchundia, Mr Fajardo includes: “6. Coordinate

with the President of the Republic for defense on the accusation of denial of justice.”?°?

4.310. 13-19 January 2008: Mr Beltman (in charge of Stratus Consulting’s “Ecuador Project”
for the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs) and Dr Maest travel to Ecuador, at Mr Donziger’s request,
to meet Mr Cabrera privately, with certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives.
This meeting is not disclosed to or known by Chevron at the time. In his later witness

statement, Mr Beltman testifies that:

“15. Based on that meeting with Cabrera and a review of his background, Cabrera
lacked the skill, qualifications, and experience to conduct or review a multi-
disciplinary environmental damages assessment himself.

16. At no time did I ever see any indication of an independent Cabrera "team" nor
did I ever meet anyone I understood to be a member of Cabrera’s "independent
team." To the contrary, individuals that I am aware of who assisted in preparing
the Cabrera Report were affiliated with or working at the direction of Donziger and
the LAPs’ representatives.

17. At no point during Stratus’s time working on the Ecuador Project, including at
the January 2008 meeting, did I have an understanding that Cabrera was preparing
his own report. It was clear from statements Donziger and others made that the
LAPs’ team expected the Lago Agrio court to rely upon the Cabrera Report in
rendering its judgment.”?>*

4.311. 22 February 2008: In his email message to his colleagues at Stratus Consulting,
Mr Beltman writes: “The project is at a key point right now. We have to write, over the
next 2 to 3 weeks, probably the single most important technical document for the case.
The document will pull together all of the work over the last 15 or so years on the case
and make recommendations for the court to consider in making its judgment ...”?°> This

“document” was to be the “Cabrera Report”.

outline and chart showing how they should falsely “attribute” their work on the Cabrera
Report to Mr Cabrera’s “team.” The chart identifies who would be responsible for
drafting each section, the reviewer/approver, and to whom it would be

falsely attributed.?°°

12 March 2008: Stratus Consulting exchanges English language drafts of the “Cabrera
Report” (Mr Cabrera does not speak English). Mr Beltman emails the English draft
report for Spanish translation to “info @translatingspanish.com,” stating that “[t]he main
[Cabrera] report (the one attached to this email) is the highest priority.” Mr Beltman
notes that he would travel to Quito to review and make revisions to the report in

so-called “Cabrera Report” until its filing in the Lago Agrio Court.

According to Mr McGowan’s expert testimony (of Stroz Friedberg, for Chevron in the
US Litigation), the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives saved the latest version of the
“Cabrera Report” on 31 March 2008 at 11:09 EST, and, “[t]he text of [the Lago Agrio
Plaintiffs’ report] ... is identical to text of the report filed by Richard Stalin Cabrera
Vega on April 1, 2008.”?>?

J April 2008: Mr Cabrera formally files the Cabrera Report with the Lago Agrio Court.
It advises the Court that Chevron should pay compensation in excess of US$
16 billion. Mr Cabrera files an amended expert report in November 2008, with a

revised figure for compensation of US$ 27.3 billion. (The Tribunal hereon refers to these

two reports collectively, save where the contexts requires otherwise, as the “Cabrera

Report”).

4.318. Later, in US legal proceedings, Mr Beltman and Mr Donziger both admitted that Stratus

Consulting covertly wrote Mr Cabrera’s Report.”*! In this arbitration, the Respondent

does not dispute that certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ experts wrote the Cabrera

Report.

262

4.319. 1 August 2008: Mr Beltman (of Stratus Consulting) reports in his email message, headed

“Plan de Trabajo - Texpet cleanup”, to Mr Fajardo and Mr Donziger:?°:

“One of our tasks for the comments on the Cabrera Report in the Plan de Trabajo
is to conduct a technical analysis of whether the Texpet cleanup in the 1990s
complied with the technical requirements for the cleanup. Cabrera already points
out that the Texpet work did not actually clean up the pits, and the idea of this
analysis was to determine if we could further criticize the Texpet cleanup for not
complying with the technical requirements ... Although there are some ambiguities
of language and potential legal issues (such as apparent contradictions between
the March 1995 Statement of Works and the RAP) I did not find any clear instances
where Texpet did not meet the conditions required in the cleanup. The very large
exception, of course, is that sampling during the judicial inspections and by
Cabrera showed that the “cleaned” pits are still contaminated — however the
sampling done by Woodward Clyde post-cleanup allowed the pits to be in
compliance with the contract requirements. This important discrepancy has already
been addressed by Cabrera in his report. There is also the issue that the RAP
conflicts with Ecuadorian laws, but again I didn’t evaluate that here. Therefore, I
do not have any comments to prepare on this aspect of the Cabrera Report.”

4.320. 9 August 2008: During his weekly presidential address, President Correa referred to the

Government’s support for the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs in the Lago Agrio Litigation, as

follows:

“.. Well, on Saturday the eighth, at 9:30, we had a working meeting on the Texaco
case, so let’s go to that, let’s go to radio link number 81. Why did we have the
working meeting on the Texaco case? You know that there’s a lawsuit filed by the
communities, the Amazon Defense Front, against Texaco Chevron, for all of the
pollution that it left in the Amazon. So then, Texaco Chevron is asking to meet with
the government. Well, I’ve told our comrades about that, to ask them what they
thought, and we’ve agreed that we would meet with them, but with our comrades
from the Amazon Defense Front present. We’re not one of those right-wing sell-out
governments that supported this multinational company and betrayed our people.

But neither are we going to get involved in this, because it might be prejudicial to
our comrades, because it’s a case that’s in the hands of the court, right? It’s a court
case. But previous governments supported Texaco Chevron and betrayed our
people: they signed agreements saying that everything was resolved, which has
been one of the principal arguments by Texaco Chevron in its defence, when in fact
nothing was resolved. Now the Prosecutor General [Mr Washington Pesdntez],
has, very properly, opened an investigation to punish those people, because it was
alie: there was nothing, nothing resolved, nothing cleaned up, of all the pollution.
So then, they probably want us to mediate the case, etc. If we can help, all the better,
but if we meet with Texaco Chevron, we’re also going to meet with our comrades
from the Amazon Defense Front. That’s what were going to say very clearly to our
comrades from that group, who are extraordinary people. They’re real heroes
there, heroes that I would call anonymous heroes, don’t you agree? One Luis
Yanza, one Pablo Fajardo, who have fought for years for their people, for their
Amazon, for the ecosystems, for nature, don’t you agree? Congratulations, but
watch out. There’s not going to be any more of those sell-out governments. We’re
not going to get involved in the case, because it’s a court case and we might hurt
them. They’ve already made accusations that the State was pressuring the judges -
haven’t they? - to prejudice the case, but comrade. I mean that if we receive
Chevron Texaco, it will be with you there. And if we can help in some way to
mediate, etc., well, all the better, but based on justice, not based on power ...”. 264

 

9 August 2008: In an exchange of email messages, Messrs Fajardo and Donziger state
that they should be “doing everything to prepare the court to issue a quick Judgment and
in such a way that it can be enforced in the U.S. before appeals in Ecuador.” They
confirm that they soon will “start the work with the new judges.”?° The latter was a
reference to the imminent end of Judge Novillo’s term on 24 August 2008 as the Lago
Agrio Judge presiding over the Lago Agrio Litigation, when he was succeeded by
Judge Niifiez. The earlier reference to the enforcement of a “quick judgment” referred
to the strategy described later in the Invictus Memorandum prepared by Patton Boggs

in or about August 2010 (see below).

13 August 2008: By email message dated 13 August 2008 to Mr Fajardo, Mr Donziger

states: “If you repeat a lie a thousand times it becomes the truth.”?°°

signatories to the 1995 Settlement Agreement (with related agreements), under Articles

338 and 339 of the Criminal Code.”
2009

January 2009: The film “Crude”, directed by Mr Joseph Berlinger, is shown at the
Sundance Film Festival in Utah, USA. The film was principally funded by Mr Russell
DeLeon, at the time a major non-party funder for the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs in the Lago

Agrio Litigation.

The film was subsequently released to the public. Chevron’s legal advisers noted that
one of these public releases was differently edited, suggesting that the unpublished
outtakes might contain relevant material. In particular, that public version showed Dr
Carlos Martin Beristain (a member of Mr Cabrera’s team) appearing to work privately
with the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives. Mr Berlinger testified that he had
removed from other versions of the film these scenes of Dr Beristain at the express
request of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives. (It is not clear why the other public
version was not similarly edited; but it had significant consequences for the Lago Agrio

Litigation).

Chevron brought legal proceedings in New York against Mr Berlinger and others to
produce unpublished outtakes from the film “Crude” showing the representatives for the
Lago Agrio Plaintiffs, private or court-appointed experts in that proceeding and current
or former officials of the Government of Ecuador. On 15 July 2010, Chevron obtained
copies of these outtakes, amounting to about 600 hours (compared to some 90 minutes
of edited film), by court order made by the US District Court for the Southern District
of New York (Judge Kaplan) under Section 1782 affirmed (as modified) on appeal by
the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on 15 July 2010.76

Subsequently, as a result of these “Crude outtakes”, Chevron also obtained other
documentation, in the US Section 1782 Litigation, from Mr Donziger, Stratus
Consulting and several others. Chevron also took depositions and witness statements

from several persons, including Dr Calmbacher, Mr Beltman, Dr Maest and, for 13 days,

Mr Donziger himself.” This unprecedented mass of evidential material, ordinarily
protected by journalistic or legal privileges, was a major development for Chevron’s
case, both for its RICO Litigation in New York and also for this arbitration under the
Treaty. It was the product of more than 20 actions brought by Chevron in different US
Federal Courts across the USA.2” As of January 2009, however, all this still lay in the

future.

5 January 2009: Mr Donziger notes in a private email message to himself, regarding his
“Strategic Plan for 2009 Ecuador”: “... speed to finish, deal with release, number,
reasoned opinion, relationship to alegato, final order for U.S. enforcement, ask for bond
and interest to run.”2”! In the Tribunal’s view, the reference to the “reasoned opinion”,
in the context of other work to be performed by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’
representatives, likely signified a tentative plan already formed by such representatives

covertly to contribute to or draft material parts of the Lago Agrio Judgment.

14 January 2009: The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representative, Mr Prieto, writes to
Mr Donziger and others in early 2009:

“\.. Let’s keep in mind that Texaco is alleging in the United States that the
Ecuadorian courts can be politically influenced, and that the Lago Agrio Court is
under enormous pressure. The pressure should be felt by the judge, but should be
subtle enough that it can’t be alleged that he acted due to that pressure ... To
understand it, let’s think about when [President] Correa visited the region and
publicly condemned Texaco. It was definitely a media victory, but Correa’s words
that day are the basis for Texaco’s main argument for saying that the Lago Agrio
judge isn’t independent and that he obeys Correa’s orders. To summarize, this
strategy should be as follows: ‘increase the pressure on the Court, but without
negatively impacting its image of independence.’ The political pressure can be in
the form of direct calls to the judge. Preferably avoid public threats!! Social and
media pressure can be brought to bear in their full force — because no one can
silence the voice of society itself — but it’s different than the voice of the State, which
supposedly remains impartial ...”?”

4 February 2009: In an email message to Mr Donziger, Mr Sdenz wrote: “Dude, if the
guys at Jones Day [Chevron’s US lawyers] get a hold of this [i.e. the collusive abuse of

Criminal Prosecutions against TexPet’s two representatives to invalidate the 1995

269 Mr Donziger’s deposition ended on 31 January 2011. Chevron issued its RICO legal proceedings in New York
against him and others the next day, on 1 February 2011.

Settlement Agreement in the Lago Agrio Litigation] it’s gonna hurt us. It’s pretty much
irrefutable evidence of us collaborating with the fiscalia to get Reis Veiga and Pérez
convicted.”?’? Mr Donziger responds, by email: “... nothing Chevron says sticks these
days, people bring evidence of crimes to prosecutors all the time ... you must understand
we are not collaborating with the fiscalia -- we are providing the fiscalia information

about a crime, which is appropriate, and that’s a big difference.”””4

4 March 2009: By declaration addressed to the Lago Agrio Court (Judge Niifiez), in
response to further accusations of impropriety made by Chevron’s Ecuadorian lawyers,
Mr Cabrera again attests to his impartiality and independence before the Lago Agrio

Court. He states (inter alia):

“\.. All my work has been public. I have concealed absolutely nothing, my report
has been submitted to the Court of Justice to which both parties have had access, I
believe, without the least impediment. If my work had been clandestine, the parties
would not have been able to photograph the sampling, would not have been able to
observe everything that was done in the field, would not have criticized the minor

technical details in the field so much”; and “... All the work done was planned,
directed, and approved by me, as the person responsible for the expert
examination. ”??

This statement was false.

5 June 2009: Mr Fajardo informs Mr Donziger that he is giving one of the Lago Agrio
Plaintiffs’ legal interns “a research assignment for our legal alegato and the judgment,
but without him knowing what he is doing.”?”° In the Tribunal’s view, the latter phrase
is a reference to a covert plan for the ‘ghostwriting’ of the Lago Agrio Judgment. Thus,
from Mr Fajardo’s perspective, this mischief could not be made known to the legal

intern.

18 June 2009: Mr Fajardo sends an email message to Mr Donziger, headed “Trust”,
which includes a “transcription” of part of the Ecuadorian court decision in Andrade v.
Conelec (i.e. the “Fajardo Trust Email”).?”” That transcription contains clerical mistakes

not found in any published version of the court decision itself.”’* Later, these same

mistakes appear verbatim in the Lago Agrio Judgment.?” In addition, this email
proposes a “trust” as “the method to execute a judgment”. In the Tribunal’s view, this
is the origin of Part 15 of the Lago Agrio Judgment for a “trust” to be formed as the
payee of any proceeds from the enforcement of the Judgment, controlled by the ADF
and persons designated by the ADF. (The Tribunal returns to these matters below, also

in Part V).

18 June 2009: Mr Fajardo sends an email message to Mr Donziger, attaching the

Ecuadorian decision in Delfina Torres v. Petroecuador*®®

and noting that: “[t]he
arguments by the magistrates are very interesting, I think they serve us well for our
alegato and ... [sic]” The use of an ellipsis was a veiled reference to the covert plan for
‘ghostwriting’ the Lago Agrio Judgment, given Mr Fajardo’s reference only two weeks

earlier to the “alegato and the judgment” (see above under “5 June 2009”).?8!

19 June 2009: The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives hold an important meeting in
Ecuador. According to Mr Fajardo’s email message to Mr Donziger, the participants are
to discuss “all of the outcome of the case and what to do, how much money to put in,

how to distribute the items and everything.””*?

22 June 2009: In response to a newspaper article entitled “State Assumes Environmental
Clean Up,” Mr Fajardo emails his colleagues, expressing concerns that [Chevron] would
“say that the State finally assumed its duty and is going to clean up what it ought to.”
By email headed “Worrisome”, Mr Donziger responds to Mr Saenz and copied to his
other colleagues, “You have to go to [President] Correa to put an end to this shit once
and for all.”2*? Whilst the Ecuadorian Government's initiative (if such it was) could
have benefited the affected local communities, PetroEcuador’s remediation activities
were seen by Mr Donziger and his colleagues (including Messrs Fajardo, Saenz, Yanza
and Prieto) as an unwelcome threat to their strategy in the Lago Agrio Litigation. The
Tribunal infers that the reason for their concerns was the inconsistency with their
strategy that Chevron was to be the only person to be held responsible for such pollution

and resulting compensation in a significant amount, to the exclusion of PetroEcuador

and the Respondent. Given (inter alia) the low estimate for PetroEcuador’s remediation
costs and the terms of the unilateral waiver of 20 November 1996 ostensibly
immunizing PetroEcuador and the Respondent from any like responsibility (see above),

such concerns are understandable.

26 July 2009: Mr Fajardo, in his email message to Mr Donziger, attaches links and texts,
adding: “Some of them are very interesting and, as a matter of fact, will help us with the
alegato work and ... [sic]”.?** The same point arises regarding the ellipsis. It referred to

the covert plan for ghostwriting the Lago Agrio Judgment (see above).

7 August 2009: In his email message to Mr Donziger headed “Meeting with Ecuador
Lawyers”,?®° Mr Kohn (of Kohn, Swift & Graf) writes (inter alia): “In order to be
effective at all in developing a judgment that will be enforceable in the US and
elsewhere we need to be involved in the preparation of the final submission and
proposed judgment, the major task we have all agreed upon repeatedly our firm would
work on. We have been discussing meeting with our Ecuador lawyers since April or
May to begin a working process to get this done ...”. This reference to “developing a

judgment” is ambiguous; but it becomes clearer in later exchanges in September 2009.

31 August 2009: Chevron publicises its allegations that it has videotaped evidence of a
bribery scheme implicating Judge Nufiez. This had allegedly taken place between 11
May and 22 June 2009 during four private meetings between Judge Nufiez, prospective
remediation contractors and persons ostensibly representing the Government.?*° These
allegations depend upon the evidence of Mr Diego Borja (one of the contractors) and
video-tapes. 7°” The latter prove inconclusive; and Mr Borja is soon revealed to be an
unreliable witness. Judge Nufiez denies any allegation of impropriety; but, after the
Ecuadorian judicial authorities begin an investigation, he recuses himself from the Lago

Agrio Litigation.

10 September 2009: The minutes of a meeting between Mr Donziger and lawyers from
Kohn, Swift & Graf refer to the “Creation of Final Order,” including subheadings for

“Trust or 2 phases” (under Section XI). Read with the next email, this means the

operative part of the Lago Agrio Judgment; i.e. the covert plan for ghostwriting the Lago

Agrio Judgment.?**

11 September 2009: A lawyer from Kohn, Swift & Graf incorporates the minutes of the
meeting of 10 September 2009 into an “Ecuador Task List”, sent to, amongst others, Mr
Donziger and Mr Kohn. It states (inter alia): “KSG will continue to discuss and think
about how to structure the judgment” (Section IIC under “Legal Issues”).*° This is

again a reference to the covert plan for ‘ghostwriting’ the Lago Agrio Judgment.

13 September 2009: When the controversy over Judge Ntifiez emerges and his
replacement by Judge Zambrano becomes likely, the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ lawyers
speculate that someone other than Judge Zambrano would draft Judge Zambrano’s
orders. They wonder in their internal emails who that someone would be. As stated in
Mr Fajardo’s email to Mr Donziger dated 13 September 2009, “I understand that
Zambrano himself asked [Judge] Nuiiez, should the case fall to him, that Nujiez help
him with the orders. That would help with the continuity. The problem is, who will carry
more weight: Nuiiez on the one hand, or Liliana [Suarez, the Lago Agrio Court’s clerk]
and [Dr] Guerra on the other..."°° It appears that the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’
representatives and Judge Zambrano chose Dr Guerra. (By now, Dr Guerra was no

longer a judge, having been dismissed from the Ecuadorian judiciary in May 2008).

15 September 2009: Mr Fajardo sends an email to Messrs Yanza, Prieto, Saenz and
Donziger referring to Judge Zambrano and Dr Guerra as the “puppet” and “puppeteer,”
respectively: “I think everything is quiet ... The puppeteer is pulling the string and the
puppet is returning the package ... By now it’s pretty safe that there won’t be anything
to worry about ... The puppet will finish off the entire matter tomorrow ... I hope they
don’t fail me ...”?! (Judge Zambrano was not yet formally re-appointed as the judge of

the Lago Agrio Court presiding over the Lago Agrio Litigation).

In his testimony at the RICO trial, Mr Donziger testified:

Q: Sir you recall in August 2009, Judge Niifiez was the subject of recusal
proceedings, correct, sir? A: I remember due to the Borja scandal that Judge
Niifiez, I think he removed himself from the case.

Q: And you knew that Judge Zambrano would be the person taking over the case
from Judge Nifiez, correct? A: I think I might have been told that by local counsel.

Q: And isn’t it also the fact that at the time your local Ecuadorian legal team told
you that Zambrano was talking to Nufiez about Nifiez potentially helping him with
orders? A: It’s possible. I don’t remember specifically.?”

... Q: Is the puppet Mr Zambrano that’s referred to in these emails? A: As I’ve
testified, I have no recollection of who it referred to. I don’t even know if I knew at
the time. I don’t think I paid a whole lot of attention to these emails. However, as I
sit here today, I have an understanding of who I think it was and it’s not, it is not
Zambrano”?

The Tribunal considers that the use of code-names at this time is likely the sign of
nefarious conduct and guilty minds by the sender and recipients; and that the “puppet”
was a code name for Judge Zambrano. There is no other cogent explanation. (Judge
Zambrano formally became the Lago Agrio Court’s judge hearing the Lago Agrio
Litigation on 21 October 2009).

23 September 2009: The Claimants commence these arbitration proceedings against the
Respondent under the Treaty, by their Notice of Arbitration dated 23 September 2009.
It was received by the Respondent on 29 September 2009.

Early October 2009: Dr Guerra contacts Chevron’s Ecuadorian lawyers with an offer to
fix with Judge Zambrano both the motion annulling Judge Nuifiez’s rulings and “the
entire case”. Chevron declines his offer. Dr Guerra repeats his offer one or two months
later. Chevron again declines his offer. Dr Guerra knew that his offers to Chevron were

illegal under Ecuadorian law.
Dr Guerra describes these events in his First Declaration, as follows:

“Once it became clear that Mr Niifiez would have to withdraw from the Chevron
case, Mr Zambrano asked me to attempt, through friends of mine, to get in touch
with the attorneys for Chevron in order to negotiate an agreement by which the
company would pay Mr Zambrano and me for issuing the final judgment in
Chevron’s favor. Mr Zambrano told me that Chevron would have much more money

282 C-2382, p. 2590.
283 C-2382, p. 2593.

Part IV - Page 94

than the Plaintiffs for this agreement, and therefore we could get a better deal and
greater profits for ourselves. I do not recall the exact date, but approximately
between August and October of 2009, I approached attorney Alberto Racines, of
Mr Adolfo Callejas’ law firm, to tell him I could establish a direct connection with
Judge Zambrano so they could discuss and negotiate important and decisive issues
in the case, including the judgment. For several weeks I insisted on this deal with
Mr Racines, but he rejected my proposal and a relationship with Chevron was never
achieved. It was publicly known that I was close to Mr Zambrano, and some
attorneys in the city of Lago Agrio, including an attorney close to Chevron’s local
attorneys, knew that I was writing rulings on his behalf. Now, it must be clearly
stated that I have no personal knowledge that Chevron’s attorneys ever knew about
my agreement with Mr Zambrano and, obviously, Chevron’s representatives never
paid me for any work I did on behalf of Judge Zambrano.”?°*

4.349. This account was repeated in Dr Guerra’s testimony at the RICO trial” and at the Track
II Hearing.” It is materially corroborated by the contemporaneous affidavit of Dr
Racines dated 16 October 2009;79” and, indirectly, by the affidavit of Dr Adolfo Callejas
Ribadeneira to whom Dr Racines reported at the time.?** Whilst, as recorded earlier in
this Part IV, the Tribunal exercises caution in accepting Dr Guerra’s testimony (for the
reasons there explained), the Tribunal accepts this testimony, with its material

corroboration, as truthful.
4.350. In his First Declaration, Dr Guerra also testified as follows:

“Following Chevron’s rejection of any negotiation regarding the judgment, I
arranged a meeting with Mr Pablo Fajardo at Mr Zambrano’s suggestion. Mr
Zambrano told me to have that meeting because he had reached an agreement with
the Plaintiffs’ representatives to quickly move the case along in their favor, but he
did not tell me the details of that agreement. Mr Fajardo and I met in Quito, at the
corner of Rio Coca and 6 de Diciembre streets, and we discussed my role as
ghostwriter for Mr Zambrano and we agreed on 3 things: (1) I would make the case
move quickly, (2) Chevron’s procedural options would be limited by not granting
their motions on alleged essential errors in rulings I was to write, so the case would
not be delayed; and (3) the Plaintiffs’ representatives would pay me approximately
USD $1,000 per month for writing the court rulings Mr Zambrano was supposed
to write. My understanding was that I had to follow these guidelines during the
remainder of the case. After a short time, I met with Messrs Fajardo, Donziger and
Yanza in the Honey & Honey Restaurant located on Eloy Alfaro and
Portugal streets ... “.°”

This first restaurant meeting in late 2010 is described separately below. Dr Guerra’s
account is materially corroborated by subsequent events and forensic evidence
regarding his drafting of court orders for Judge Zambrano in the Lago Agrio Litigation.
Dr Guerra knew that his drafting of court orders for Judge Zambrano was illegal under

Ecuadorian law, as did Judge Zambrano.

20-21 October 2009 — Draft Orders #1 and #2 are last saved on Dr Guerra’s computer.”
Judge Zambrano’s order based on Dr Guerra’s Draft Orders #1 and #2 is issued in the

Lago Agrio Litigation.*"!

. 21 October 2009: Judge Zambrano has assumed jurisdiction over the Lago Agrio

Litigation. In his order of 21 October 2009, Judge Zambrano denies Chevron’s motion
to annul Judge Niifiez’s rulings. This motion had been made on the ground that Judge
Nuifiez had recused himself after making statements indicating bias and prejudgment in

the Lago Agrio Litigation.

. 25 October 2009: The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives seek to employ a new

lawyer to assist in “organizing the office’s legal information for the alegato and the other
project.” In context, the reference to this unnamed “other project” refers to the covert

plan to ‘ghostwrite’ the Lago Agrio Judgment.

. 27 October 2009: In his email to Mr Donziger dated 27 October 2009, Mr Fajardo

(again) refers to Dr Guerra as the “puppeteer”, Judge Zambrano as the “puppet” and the
Lago Agrio plaintiffs’ representatives as “the audience” when he sends to Messrs
Donziger and Yanza an email message with the subject “News.” The email states: “The
puppeteer won’t move his puppet until the audience doesn’t pay him something ...”°
As before, this use of code-names indicates nefarious conduct and guilty minds by both

sender and recipient.

20 October 2009: A draft order is last saved on Dr Guerra’s computer prior to Judge

Zambrano issuing an order with materially matching text (on 27 October 2009).°%

to be discreet in the use of language in referring to the covert plan for the ‘ghostwriting’

of the Lago Agrio Judgment.

As for the reference to the “plan for the judgment”, Mr Donziger confirmed in the RICO
Litigation that the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs “never publicly on the record submitted a
proposed judgment in Lago Agrio.”*™ The Tribunal considers that Mr Fajardo’s phrase

referred to the covert plan to ‘ghostwrite’ the Lago Agrio Judgment.

11 March 2010: Judge Zambrano is succeeded by Judge Orddfiez in the Lago Agrio
Litigation.

30 March 2010: In his email message, Mr Prieto (in Ecuador) writes to Mr Donziger
(copied to Messrs Fajardo, Yanza and Saenz) to complain at the result of the production
to Chevron of the ‘Crude outtakes’ and other materials in the legal proceedings in the

USA:

“Today Pablo [Fajardo] and Luis [Yanza] were kind enough to tell us what was
going on in Denver [this was a reference to Chevron’s legal proceedings against
Stratus Consulting before the US Federal Court in Denver under US Section 1782],
and the fact that certainly ALL will be made public, including correspondence.
[T]he problem, my friend, is that the effects are potentially devastating in Ecuador
(apart from destroying the proceeding, all of us, your attorneys, might go to jail),
and we are not willing to minimize our concern and to sit to wait for whatever
happens. For us its NOT acceptable for the correspondence, the emails, between
Stratus Consulting and Juanpa and myself be divulged. To avoid this, we have
decided to file a writ of protection before a judge in Ecuador, asking the judge to
write to the judge in Denver not to reveal the correspondence because this would
affect our fundamental rights. This is an idea that may not work, but with adequate
support perhaps we can do it. I am telling you so you'll know. We will send you the
document.”

The reference to “jail” is significant. Criminal proceedings could have arisen from
unlawful conduct over the bribing of Messrs Reyes and Pinto, the blackmailing of Judge
‘Yanez, the corrupt collusion with Mr Cabrera, the ‘ghostwriting’ of Mr Cabrera’s
Report, the bribes paid to Dr Guerra for drafting Judge Zambrano’s orders, the
inappropriate private meetings with several judges of the Lago Agrio Court, the
collusive criminal proceedings against Mr Veiga and Dr Pérez and the covert plan for
‘ghostwriting’ the Lago Agrio Judgment. (There was apparently no written reply from

Mr Donziger to this email message).

14 May 2010: This Tribunal issues its Order on Interim Measures dated 14 May 2010:

333 €-930. These legal proceedings were an application by Chevron to the US District Court of Colorado under
Section 1782 made on 18 December 2009. It eventually resulted in an order against Stratus Consulting of 1 October

17 June 2010: By letter dated 17 June 2010 to the Tribunal’s Secretary, responding to
Paragraph 1(v) of its Order on Interim Measures dated 14 May 2010, the Lago Agrio

Court (Judge Orddjiez) writes as follows:

“Through this letter, I want to communicate that the Attorney General’s Office of
the Republic of Ecuador has informed me of the Order on Provisional Measures,
dated May 14, 2010, ordered by the Tribunal chaired by you within the
international arbitration filed by the companies Chevron Corporation and Texaco
Petroleum Company against Ecuador, where I am invited to give an indication, as
a professional courtesy to the Arbitration Tribunal, of the possible date for the
issuance by the Presidency of the Provincial Court of Justice of Sucumbios, of a
decision regarding lawsuit No.-002- 2003-P-CSNL, which is brought by Maria
Aguinda and others against the Company Chevron Corporation, for compensation
for environmental damages.

In this regard, I must inform you that, within Ecuadorian procedural rules, there
are no provisions that enable me to state a precise date for the issuance of the
decision regarding said lawsuit; however, taking into consideration the length of
the proceedings (185,152 pages), according to my professional experience as a
Judge and my study of the proceedings to date, I foresee that a decision may
possibly be arrived at in 8 to 10 months; nevertheless, this period may vary due to
reasons beyond our control, or events we cannot foresee at this time in connection
with the proceedings.” **

July 2010: The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives dismiss Mr Kohn and his law firm

as advisers and funders from the Lago Agrio Litigation.**>

14 July 2010: Forensic Evidence (See Part VI):**° Windows XP is installed on the “Old
Computer” of Judge Zambrano. A significant amount of data was then copied to the Old
Computer.**’? The transfer included documents named “Caso Texaco.doc” and

“Providencias.doc”.*38

The Old Computer was not found to contain any of the nine draft orders prepared by Dr
Guerra for the Lago Agrio Court during Judge Zambrano’s first period as the judge
presiding over the Lago Agrio Litigation (21 October 2009 to 11 March 2010). The
subsequent installation of Windows XP on 14 July 2010 is the likely explanation.

23 July 2010: A Western Digital 120 GB hard drive is attached as an external storage
device to Dr Guerra’s computer. The 11 Draft Orders were copied to the computer hard
drive as part of a much larger transfer process during which 4,325 files and folders were
placed on the computer hard drive.**? An operating system was installed on Dr Guerra’s

Hard Drive. 11 Documents were created on Dr Guerra’s Hard Drive.*#°

2 August 2010: The false origins of the “Cabrera Reports” are raised by Chevron in the
Lago Agrio Litigation. Chevron had received the off-cuts from “Crude” in July 2010.
Following an application in the Lago Agrio Litigation, the Lago Agrio Court (Judge
Ord6jiez) issues an order allowing the reports attributed to Mr Cabrera to be substituted

by ‘cleansing’ expert reports, to be submitted within 45 days.*4!

18 August 2010: The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives consider the effect of Mr
Cabrera’s departure as the Lago Agrio Court’s sole global assessment expert and his
replacement with the parties’ cleansing experts. This includes an email message, marked
“privileged and confidential — attorney work product”, from Mr Small (of Patton Boggs)
to Mr Donziger: “While our new expert [sic] will most likely rely on some of the same
data as Cabrera (and come to the same conclusions as Cabrera) ... we probably wouldn’t
want to draw that much attention to Cabrera ... our expert might address Cabrera’s
findings in such a subtle way that someone reading the new expert report (the Court in
Lago or an enforcement court elsewhere) might feel comfortable concluding that certain

parts of Cabrera are a valid basis for damages.”*4?

None of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ cleansing experts visit Ecuador, inspect the former
concession area or conduct any sampling or environmental testing, as Mr Donziger later
confirmed during his testimony in the RICO Litigation.*#* The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs
produce their seven expert reports on 16 September 2010, submitted to the Lago Agrio

Court within the 45 days’ time limit.*#

One of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ cleansing experts, Dr Lawrence W. Barnthouse, relies
upon the Cabrera Report “to see exactly how he [Cabrera] had done it.”*4° The Lago
Agrio Judgment in turn relies upon Dr Barnthouse to arrive at its damages of US$
200,000,000 for the recovery of flora, fauna and aquatic life.*4© Hence, the Lago Agrio
Judgment indirectly relies upon the Cabrera Report.**’ The Tribunal returns to this

matter below: see Part V.

For its damages of US$ 5.396 billion for soil remediation, the Lago Agrio Judgment’s
calculation based upon 880 pits can only be traced back to Annex H1 to the Cabrera
Report (’Anexo H1”) and not, as the Judgment and the Clarification Order state,
“various aerial photographs”.*48 Anexo H1 to the Cabrera Report had not, in fact, been
drafted by Mr Cabrera, but prepared by Stratus and falsely attributed to Mr Cabrera by
the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives. The Tribunal returns to this matter below:

see Part V.

August 2010: In or about August 2010, Patton Boggs produce for the representatives of
the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs a lengthy undated memorandum entitled “Path Forward:
Securing and Enforcing Judgment and Reaching Settlement” or, in shorthand, the
“Invictus Memorandum’”.*? It sets out (inter alia) a legal strategy for seizing Chevron’s
assets outside Ecuador in multiple jurisdictions, including the arrest of Chevron’s
vessels.*°° These jurisdictions included the USA, the Philippines, Singapore, Australia,
Argentina, Brazil, Columbia, Venezuela, Canada, Kuwait, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, South
Africa, South Korea, Belgium, Indonesia, The Netherlands, the United Kingdom,
Trinidad and Tobago, New Zealand and Russia.

The conclusion of the Invictus Memorandum reads (in part):

“After approximately seventeen total years of litigation in the United States and in
Ecuador, the case against Chevron now enters its most critical, multi-faceted, and
labor-intensive phase. As described herein, there are challenges and risks, but all
are manageable. With the ultimate goal of effecting a swift and favorable settlement

in mind, the strategy of Plaintiffs’ Team over the coming months preceding and
following entry of a judgment will incorporate the following components: ...

* Securing a defensible and enforceable judgment in Ecuador by executing an
effective alegato finale and submitting a persuasive, thoughtful submission on
damages that will, in many ways, moot Chevron’s criticism of the Cabrera Report

* Identifying jurisdictions globally that are most hospitable to an enforcement
action, with the goal that careful selection and an investment of time on the front
end will simplify the process substantially on the back-end.

* Identifying Chevron’s most vulnerable assets and determining whether pre-
judgment attachment is a viable option for placing settlement pressure on Chevron
in the various jurisdictions where enforcement is contemplated...”

4.392. Later, as reported in ecuardoinmediato.com on 3 March 2012 (shortly after the Lago
Agrio Judgment became enforceable),**! Mr Saenz (of the Lago Agrio representatives)
stated: ““ ... we can immediately go to carry out the compulsory enforcement of the
judgment. We have several teams around the world who are ready to seize tankers,
shares, production. In view of the fact that Chevron has no significant assets in this
country, assets in Panama and Venezuela may be seized, for which the timing has been
analysed and the trust was signed yesterday, the attorney says”. (This trust was created
under the terms of the Lago Agrio Judgment, designating it the beneficiary of the

judgment’s proceeds: see Part V below).
4.393. 5 September 2010: In his email message, Dr Guerra writes to Mr Donziger:*>*

“Alberto Guerra Bastidas here, apart from a warm greeting, I would appreciate
your helping my daughter Gabriela Guerra with respect to the mechanics of
obtaining her residence in the United States. She entered [the USA] last October of
2009 with a tourist visa. Later, in June of 2010 she changed her status from tourist
to student, so she is legal for one year until June 2011. She has an American
boyfriend who for the purpose of making her legal, and for love, she says, they want
to get married. Questions: is it more convenient to have the wedding in the US or
in Ecuador. With the marriage how long will it take to get the residency worked
out. What is an estimate of the cost of the procedures — and attorney’s fees. By the
way, my daughter is in Chicago. I will support the matter of Pablo Fajardo so it
will come out soon and well.”

The last sentence in Dr Guerra’s email is ambiguous; but, in context and as explained

by Dr Guerra himself at the Track II Hearing,***

it indicates, at the very least, an
inappropriate willingness to assist Mr Fajardo in the Lago Agrio Litigation. There is no

reply in evidence before this Tribunal from Mr Donziger to Dr Guerra.

17 September 2010: The Lago Agrio Court (Judge Ordéfiez) issues its procedural order
(autos para sentencia), closing the evidential file in the Lago Agrio Litigation and
preparing the case for judgment.** Later, Judge Ord6iiez recuses himself on 10 October
2010; he is succeeded by Judge Zambrano on 11 October 2010; and by his procedural
order of 11 October 2010, Judge Zambrano revokes Judge Orddjfiez’s order of 17
September 2010.7°°

October 2010: By October 2010, Chevron has filed several US Section 1782
applications in the USA, against Mr Donziger, Stratus Consulting and others; and it had
already received multiple document productions from Mr Donziger and Stratus

Consulting, in addition to the “Crude Outtakes”.

6 October 2010: As he subsequently testified by affidavit, Dr Enrique Carvajal Salas (a
lawyer for Chevron in Ecuador) describes a meeting with a friend in Quito on 6 October

2010:

“In that meeting, my ... friend told me, based on his discussion with Dr Guerra,
that Judge Zambrano would no longer try to reach some agreement with Chevron
because he was aware that the company would not make financial arrangements
with anybody, but, instead, that Judge Zambrano was sure to do so with the
plaintiffs [i.e. the [Lago Agrio Plaintiffs]. I understood this to mean that Judge
Zambrano would reach an agreement with the plaintiffs to receive money from them
in exchange for issuing the judgment in the Aguinda case in their favor.”*°®

Subsequently, in “late April 2012” after the Lago Agrio Judgment had been issued, Dr
Carvajal runs into Dr Guerra, they greet each other, and: “As I walked away, Dr Guerra
came running up behind me. When I turned around, Dr Guerra said, ‘Dr Carvajal, I want
to tell you that I would like to make any kind of statement about the fact that I helped to

prepare the first instance judgment’. I immediately answered: ‘You, and who else?’

After some hesitation, he answered: ‘Fajardo and Zambrano’. Then he added: ‘I am

willing to make a public statement ...”.*°7

Dr Carvajal’s testimony as regards both events is corroborated by the affidavit of

Dr Adolfo Callejas Ribadeneira, to whom Dr Carvajal reported at the time.***

In his affidavit, Dr Callejas describes another event taking place in “approximately the

last quarter of 2010”:

“\.. another one of the lawyers on my legal team in the Aguinda case, Dr Patricio
Efrain Campuzano Merino, told me that, earlier that day, he received a telephone
call from ... who said she had something important to discuss with him regarding
the Aguinda case, and that he met her shortly thereafter. Dr Campuzano told me
that, in his meeting with ... she said that Judge Zambrano wanted to know whether
Chevron would be interested in drafting the final judgment of the trial court in
favour of Chevron in the Aguinda case. Dr Campuzano told me that he understood
Dr Guerra had conveyed that information to ... Based on Dr Campuzano’s
recitation of his discussion with ... understood ... to mean that Chevron could pay
an amount of money to Judge Zambrano to obtain and ghostwrite a judgment in its
favour in the Aguinda case. I replied to Dr Campuzano with a firm, ‘No’ ...”.>?

11 October 2010: Forensic Evidence (See Part VI): A user of Judge Zambrano’s Old
Computer creates a new document,*™ “Providencias.docx”, from some or all of the
“Providencias.doc” document.**! (The latter document had been transferred to Judge

Zambrano’s Old Computer in July 2010: see above).

10-13 October 2010: Judge Ordofiez is recused following Chevron’s application of 26
August 2010 alleging untimely conduct and bias.*°* Judge Zambrano again assumes
judicial responsibility for the Lago Agrio Litigation. He issues an order rejecting most
of Chevron’s pending motions; and he threatens to sanction Chevron’s lawyers if they

file further motions seeking to revoke the Court’s prior orders.**

September-October 2010: Dr Guerra meets the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ lawyers twice at

the Honey & Honey restaurant in Quito.

According to Dr Guerra, the first occasion is for Messrs Fajardo and Yanza to thank him
(Dr Guerra) for his help in writing orders and “steer[ing]” the case in their favour. The
second occasion is for Messrs Fajardo, Yanza and Donziger to discuss paying Dr Guerra
and Judge Zambrano for a judgment drafted (i.e. ‘ghostwritten’) by the Lago Agrio
Plaintiffs’ representatives. According to Dr Guerra, Judge Zambrano later informs Dr
Guerra that he (Judge Zambrano) had made direct contact with Mr Fajardo, and that the
Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives had agreed to pay US$ 500,000 in exchange for
allowing them to write the Lago Agrio Judgment, from which Dr Guerra would receive
“a proper benefit”.*°. Judge Zambrano tells Dr Guerra that he would share part of the

money with him, once it was paid to him.**
At the RICO trial in New York, Dr Guerra testified as follows:

“Q. What if anything happened at that meeting at the Honey [&] Honey restaurant?

A. At that meeting I took it upon myself to summarize in detail the proposal made
by Mr Zambrano, and I obviously stated expressly regarding his intent of receiving
at least $500,000 ... Mr Donziger and the whole group ... stated that they regretted
it very much, but that for the time being, at that time they didn’t have the money
that Mr Zambrano was requesting.”**"

At the Track II Hearing in this arbitration, Dr Guerra testified orally in similar terms:

“Q. Did you have a meeting with anyone in September or October 2010, at the
Honey [&] Honey restaurant in Quito? A. I did. At that time I met with Mr Steven
Donziger, with Pablo Fajardo, Luis Yanza, who represented the Plaintiffs against
Chevron in Ecuador.

Q. What did you say to them at that meeting? A. Specifically at that meeting, I
conveyed a message from Judge Nicolas Zambrano related to the fact that he would
accept for them to prepare the draft Judgment in the Chevron Case, in exchange of
the sum of at least $500,000”**

At the RICO trial in New York, Mr Donziger testified that he met Dr Guerra at a

restaurant in Quito in late 2010 and that Dr Guerra there solicited a bribe from him:

“Q: You admit, sir, that you met with Mr Guerra [at] a restaurant called the Honey

Q: So [Dr Guerra] made clear to you in exchange for a $500,000 bribe, he could

payment.”

Q: And your testimony, sir, is you told [Dr Guerra] no, we can’t do that, correct,
that’s your testimony? A: Yes.”

31 October 2010: The Intercreditor Agreement is executed, in counterparts, by
Mr Donziger, Mr Fajardo, Patton Boggs, Mr Yanza, the ADF and others on the
distribution of proceeds from the Lago Agrio Litigation. The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs rank

accompanied the “Burford Funding Agreement”, also of 31 October 2010.°7

In his deposition in the US Section 1182 Litigation on 1 December 2010, Mr Donziger
stated that it is possible that he might receive personally “hundreds of millions” of

US dollars from a favourable judgment in the Lago Agrio Litigation.*”*

“@Q. Is it fair to say that you have an expectation that you, Steven Donziger, might
receive as much as hundreds of millions of dollars in the event that there is a
judgment in favor of the plaintiffs in that case?... A. It is possible. It depends on the
amount of the overall recovery. I misspoke two questions ago. I don’t know if it
would be appropriate to try to correct something.

Q. Please go ahead. A. The amount -- the top end of the overall recovery of
attorneys’ fees is now lower than that agreement based on an oral understanding
with the clients. It is lower than 25 percent.

Q. What is it now? A. It is 20 percent.

Q. And when was that changed? A. This year, a few months ago. I don’t know when
exactly.

Q. And for what reason? A. Various reasons, but that [sic] this stage of the case we
are trying to bring in new firms and funds to sustain the case. So in coming up with
a formula that would make all of that work, the total amount of the attorneys’ fees
dropped.”*”>

The Tribunal has also been shown a “pie chart” produced for the US State Department
of 20 December 2011 (after the Lago Agrio Judgment), showing the following
figures:*”° From a “total recovery” by external “Funders, Lawyers, and Advisors” of
US$ 5,741,211,538 on US$ 18, 156,936,000, Donziger & Associates would receive US$
1,143,886,968, Mr Fajardo US$ 363,138,720, Patton Boggs US$ 435,768,464 and the
Burford Group (as the major non-party funder) US$ 1,006,802,101.57” Mr Donziger had
earlier prepared (for internal use only) documents showing other figures for shares in
the proceeds of a successful Lago Agrio Judgment, including Mr DeLeon, Mr Yanza &
Mr Fajardo, on 13 April 2009278 and February 2010.7”? The Lago Agrio Complaint had
requested that the ADF be the payee of Chevron’s judgment debt, together with 10% of
the judgment’s value. (The Lago Agrio Judgment was to award this 10% in the sum of

US$ 864 million or, potentially, US$ 1.82 billion).

6 December 2010: This Tribunal issues its Second Order on Interim Measures dated 6

December 2010: see Annex 1(B) to Part I above.

Pursuant to this procedural order, the Tribunal (by its President) writes to Judge
Zambrano at the Lago Agrio Court the following letter of 6 December 2010 (in both
English and Spanish):

“T have the pleasure of addressing you in my capacity as President of the Arbitral
Tribunal presiding over the international arbitration captioned PCA Case No.
2009-23: ‘Chevron Corporation and Texaco Petroleum Company v. The Republic
of Ecuador’.

In that capacity, and on behalf of the Arbitral Tribunal, I write in order to invite
you, as a professional courtesy, and in conformity with your duties to the Parties in
the case named in the subject line above, to make known to the Arbitral Tribunal
and to the Parties to that case, as far in advance as may be reasonably possible,
the likely date that you will render judgment on the merits in that case.

I make reference in this regard to the letter dated 17 June 2010 from the Presidency
of the Provincial Court of Sucumbios, wherein Judge Leonardo Isaac Ord6niez
Pitia, formerly seized of the case, kindly responded to a similar prior invitation from
the Arbitral Tribunal transmitted by the Attorney General and stated at that time
that ‘taking into consideration the length of the proceedings (185,152 pages),
according to my professional experience as a Judge and my study of the
proceedings to date, I foresee that a decision may possibly be arrived at in 8 to 10
months’ **

I request, for the above purpose, and to avoid any delays in the communication of
this information to the Arbitral Tribunal, that this information be transmitted, in
addition to any other means, also by e-mail and facsimile, to the following person
and address:

Martin Doe Permanent Court of Arbitration, [postal, fax and email addresses
supplied.

In the event it is possible for you to transmit this communication also by courier, I
enclose herein a prepaid FedEx envelope with the above address, in order to allow
transmission to the Arbitral Tribunal also by that means.

I thank you kindly in advance for your attention to this matter and your acceptance
of the request set out in this letter ....”

4.418. The Tribunal receives no response to this letter from the Lago Agrio Court or Judge

Zambrano as the judge now presiding over the Lago Agrio Litigation.

4.419. 7 December 2010: Forensic Evidence (See Part VI): First apparent use of the HP

Account on Judge Zambrano’s New Computer.***

4.420. 17 December 2010: In his email dated 17 December 2010 to certain of the Lago Agrio

Plaintiffs’ representatives, including Mr Donziger, Mr Fajardo writes:

“T hereby express my deep concern given the noncompliance with the completion
of the legal argument for the main case, or the Lago Agrio case.

J imagine that you are all aware of this — that the case is closing in Ecuador. From
our analysis, we can deduce that the Judge can issue a writ for judgment at any
time, any day; this means that we must have our legal argument ready, defined and
we must all be in agreement with it, in order to submit it to the Court at any time.

We have spoken a great deal on this matter. We have reached agreements to finish
as quickly as possible, but to date, there is no real response. My friends, I think we
cannot wait any longer. Thus, given this noncompliance, we will develop a second
alternative.

The subsidiary alternative, is that we will draft an argument solely with the vision
of Ecuador, in the event that we must submit the argument in the next days, we will
present only the document that we prepare — the rest will be set on a back-burner,
if it is completed some day. I hope that this decision does not cause internal
problems, but it is the option that would allow us to meet the Court’s demands, in
the event that we have to do so.

The only possibility, if we are able to prepare the document and we can later correct
it in Ecuador, and finally, we can submit it with the Court without any problem, is
for the Judge not to issue a writ for judgment; but this scenario is not within our
reach. This judge is very firm and exercises a great deal of authority; he is
punishing any attempt to delay the proceeding.

Further, in the event that a writ for judgment is issued, it is certain that Chevron
will timely submit its argument, which would be an enormous disadvantage for us
if we fail to submit the document.

I need immediate answers.”**

The terms of this email are, ostensibly, inconsistent with Mr Fajardo’s knowledge of
any scheme whereby certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives were then
‘ghostwriting’ the Lago Agrio Judgment. The explanation, however, is straightforward.
The recipients of this email included persons who had no such knowledge; and it would
have served no purpose for Mr Fajardo to inform them otherwise. Several of the
recipients were also amenable to the jurisdiction of the US Courts, including discovery
under Section 1782. Moreover, as already indicated, Mr Fajardo knew by this time that
any email to Mr Donziger would likely end up in the hands of Chevron as a result of US

litigation — as it did.

17 December 2010: Judge Zambrano issues “autos para sentencia’”, formally closing the

evidentiary phase of the proceedings in the Lago Agrio Litigation.**°

20 December 2010: In his email dated 20 December 2010 to certain of the Lago Agrio
Plaintiffs’ representatives, including Mr Donziger, Mr Fajardo writes of his concern as
to “how the Judge will respond to this new argument set forth by Chevron ...:.°°” This
concern is again, ostensibly, inconsistent with Mr Fajardo’s knowledge of any scheme
whereby certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives were then ‘ghostwriting’
the Lago Agrio Judgment. In the Tribunal’s view, again, the explanation lies in the range
of recipients who were not privy to the ‘ghostwriting’ or subject to the jurisdiction of

the USA courts.

21 December 2010, making a total of 3,153 minutes (52.62 hours) for the period
between 11 October 2010 and 28 December 2010. This version of “Providencias.docx”

contains 66% of the text of the Lago Agrio Judgment.**”

This version also contains text and nine citations to US court decisions materially
identical to the unfiled Erion Memorandum of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’
representatives; and two citations to legal materials in the unfiled Moodie Memorandum
of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives. (These wordings are subsequently edited
for the final version Lago Agrio Judgment, as issued). Text and statistics from the
unfiled Selva Database are also contained in this version of “Providencias.docx’”’. (The

Tribunal returns to these matters in Parts V and VI below).

31 December 2010: In his email dated 31 December 2010 to the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’

representatives, Mr Fajardo writes:

“\..no one knows when the Judge may issue his judgment; he could do so within
two weeks, or within many months or even years. If he does so many months from
now, the judge may possibly consider the legal reports [“informes en derecho” ];
but if the judge issues his judgment soon, the document will remain in our hands
and will be useless. We will not run this risk... I’m sorry my friend, but we are
behind schedule with this memorandum of law, which could have serious
consequences for the case”.°°°

Again, the terms of this email are, ostensibly, inconsistent with Mr Fajardo’s knowledge
of any scheme whereby certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives were then
‘ghostwriting’ the Lago Agrio Judgment. The explanation, however, is again
straightforward. The recipients of this email included a person in the USA who had no
knowledge of ‘ghostwriting’; and it would have served no good purpose (from Mr

Fajardo’s perspective) to inform him otherwise. Moreover, Mr Fajardo must have been

does not explain how Spanish text translated from English language case-law is

contained in the earlier “Providencias.docx” of 28 December 2010.

8 January 2011: In his email dated 8 January 2011 to the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’
representatives headed “Chevron’s Alegato”), Mr Fajardo again writes in terms,
ostensibly, inconsistent with any knowledge on his part of a covert scheme to

‘ghostwrite’ the Lago Agrio Judgment:

“Friends, this is to let you know that I spent several hours yesterday visiting the
Court of Justice of Sucumbios and reviewing the latest motions filed by Chevron. I
found that Chevron, on Thursday, January 6, 2011, at 5:55 p.m., had already filed
their legal alegato. It is a short 292 page document and their theories are amply
briefed. As you can see, my concerns are well founded. Chevron has gotten ahead
of us by filing their alegato, while we are still writing ours. All the more reason to
speed up our work, otherwise the Judge could be convinced by Chevron’s theory

9 3
Again, however, the Tribunal considers that explanation is the same as with his email
messages of 17, 20 and 31 December 2010. (Moreover, by January 2011, the Federal

Court in New York had ordered Mr Donziger to disclose his computers’ hard drives, in

addition to email messages and other documentation).

17 January 2011: The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs file their alegato with the Lago Agrio
Court.*? It is a pleading of some 118 pages. In the alegato, it is submitted (inter alia)

that the Ecuadorian legal system “recognizes circumstances when it is appropriate to

hold a parent company liable for the actions of a separately established subsidiary (page

94). It concludes:

“Chevron’s attempt to now pretend that it and Texaco and Texpet are genuinely
independent and invoke the corporate veil to avoid liability is clearly an abuse and
manipulation of the legal instrument of corporate separation, and fraudulent
perhaps by design but in any event in result, which, as discussed above, is all that
is required to pierce the corporate veil under Ecuadorian law. Moreover,
Chevron’s attempt to shift liability to flagrantly undercapitalized entities (Texaco
and TexPet) is also clear evidence of fraud (by result or by intent) sufficient to
pierce the corporate veil. Finally, the fact that Chevron is invoking this immunity
strategy even after explicitly promising to the U.S. court and the plaintiffs that it
would submit to litigation of these claims in Ecuador and abide by any judgment,
is simply more evidence of fraud that justifies lifting the corporate veil in this case.”
(page 99).

This legal argument, whereby Chevron was to stand in the shoes of both Texaco and

TexPet, was essentially adopted in the Lago Agrio Judgment: see the “merger” issue in

Part V below.

Respondent “to take all measures at its disposal to suspend or cause to be suspended the
enforcement or recognition within and without Ecuador of any judgment against the
First Claimant in the Lago Agrio Case.” (This Procedural Order was maintained and re-
stated in the Tribunal’s Order on Interim Measures of 16 March 2011, its First Interim
Award on Interim Measures dated 25 January 2012, and its Second Interim Award on

Interim Measures dated 16 February 2012: see also Annex | to Part 1 above).

14 February 2011: The Lago Agrio Court issues Judge Zambrano’s Lago Agrio
Judgment (later clarified on 4 March 2011). It awards damages payable by Chevron in
the amount of US$ 8.6 billion, with an additional US$ 8.6 billion in the event that a
public apology is not made by Chevron within 15 days “as a symbolic measure of moral
redress and of recognition of the effects of its misconduct, as well as a guarantee of no
repetition.”*°° A further 10% of the Judgment is awarded to the Amazon Defense Front,
amounting to US$ 864 million (or, potentially, US$ 1.82 billion). The damages are to
be paid into a trust to be established with the ADF as beneficiary.*°! (The Lago Agrio

Judgment is considered at greater length in Part V(B) below).

de novo hearing based on the evidence filed in the Lago Agrio Court. Given the volume
and complexity of that evidence, if it was a de novo hearing, it was a judicial feat of
Olympic proportions achieved within only a few months. (The Lago Agrio Appellate

Court’s judgment is considered at greater length in Part V below).

13 January 2012: The Appellate Court issues a Clarification Order of its Appellate
Judgment on 13 January 2012.4" It effectively grants the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ requests

(The Clarification Order is considered at greater length in Part V below).

20 January 2012: Chevron files a cassation appeal from the Lago Agrio Appellate Court
to the Cassation Court.“ In that appeal, Chevron requests the suspension of the
enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment, as upheld by the Appellate Court by its
Judgment of 3 January 2012 and Clarification Order of 13 January 2012. The appeal
refers (inter alia) to this Tribunal’s orders for interim measures, including its Order of 9
February 2011, ordering the Respondent to suspend the enforcement of the Lago Agrio
Judgment (see Annex | to Part I above). Chevron also requests an exemption from the
requirement to post a bond to suspend the enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment

Act.

27 February 2012: This Tribunal issues its Third Interim Award on Jurisdiction and
Admissibility dated 27 February 2012: see Annex 1(H) to Part I above. It there decides

(inter alia), in Paragraph 5.4:

“As regards the claims pleaded by the First Claimant (Chevron Corporation or
“Chevron”) in the Claimants’ said Notice of Arbitration, to reject all objections
made by the Respondent as to jurisdiction and admissibility in its said memorials
and further submissions, save those relating to the jurisdictional objections raised
against the First Claimant as a investor under Article I(1)(a) alleging a “direct”
investment under Article VI(1)(c) and an “investment agreement” under Article
VI(1)(a) of the Ecuador-USA Treaty of 27 August 1993 which are joined to the
merits of the First Claimants’ claims under Article 21(4) of the UNCITRAL
Arbitration Rules forming part of the Parties’ arbitration agreement under the
Treaty; ...”.

I March 2012: By its Order of 1 March 2012, the Lago Agrio Appellate Court denies
Chevron’s request of 23 February 2012. It confirms that the Lago Agrio Judgment, as
upheld by the Appellate Court, is now enforceable.*!? This Tribunal treats the Order of
1 March 2012 as the certificate of enforceability in Ecuador of the Lago Agrio Judgment
by the Respondent. It was issued and maintained in non-compliance with the Tribunal’s

several Orders for Interim Measures.

7 February 2013: This Tribunal issues its Fourth Interim Award on Interim Measures
dated 7 February 2013 see Annex 1(I) to Part I above. The Tribunal (inter alia) there
declares that the Respondent “has “violated the First and Second Interim Awards under
the Treaty, the UNCITRAL Rules and international law in regard to the finalisation and
enforcement subject to execution of the Lago Agrio Judgment within and outside

Ecuador, including (but not limited to) Canada, Brazil and Argentina.”

28 March 2013: Dr Zambrano signs his sworn Declaration in the RICO Litigation,
shortly before commencing his new employment in Ecuador, with a subsidiary of

PetroEcuador.

21 March 2013: In his witness statement in the RICO Litigation,*?> Mr Beltman (of
Stratus Consulting) admits that Mr Cabrera did not write the Cabrera Report filed in
April 2008, as follows:

“T prepared the first drafts of substantial parts of ... the main body of the Cabrera
Report. At Donziger’s direction, I drafted my portions of the report in the first
person as though it was written by Richard Cabrera. I supervised the preparation
by Dr Maest and other Stratus personnel or subcontractors of 11 of the 24 sub-
reports and appendices, known as Annexes, to the Cabrera Report” ... “Donziger
and Fajardo told me to whom authorship of the various Cabrera Report Annexes
should be attributed, and I recorded those names in a table. Donziger told me that
the reason for the attribution was to make it more difficult to uncover that Stratus
had written the Annexes. Donziger told Stratus to indicate on the draft Summary
Report that it was written ‘By Richard Cabrera’ and instructed Stratus to draft its
portions of the Summary Report in the first person ” ... “I understood that portions
of the Cabrera Response that Stratus was drafting would be filed with the Lago
Agrio court as if written by Cabrera. My discussions about this work with Donziger
and the LAPs’ representatives confirmed that Donziger and the LAPs’ team wanted
the Cabrera’s Responses to increase the damages assessed by billions of dollars.”
... “Tunderstood that Cabrera filed the ‘Cabrera Response’ based at least in part
on text written by the LAPs’ representatives and consultants, including Stratus, on
November 17, 2008. The Cabrera Response incorporated work, calculations, and

text written by Stratus, among others, and increased the damages assessed in the
Cabrera Report from $16 billion to $27 billion ....”.

31 August 2013: President Correa launches a political and publicity campaign, called
“La Mano Sucia de Chevron” (“the Dirty Hand of Chevron”) to facilitate (inter alia)
payment of the Lago Agrio Judgment by Chevron. This campaign’s implementation
over the next several years includes several statements by President Correa during his
weekly broadcasts and statements by his Government’s ministers and diplomats, hostile

to Chevron.

September 2013: The Prosecutor General of Ecuador returns to Chevron three boxes of
evidence on the “ghostwriting” of the Lago Agrio Judgment, sent by Chevron (listed as

9,014 pages and two CDs). He states that the case in question is a civil proceeding in

which the Prosecutor General’s office does not participate.*?°

17 September 2013: This Tribunal issues its First Partial Award on Track I dated 17

September 2013 (see Annex 1(J) to Part I above). It there decides (inter alia):

“(1) The First Claimant (“Chevron”) and the Second Claimant (“TexPet”) are
both ‘Releasees’ under Article 5.1 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement and Article IV
of the 1998 Final Release;

(2) As such a Releasee, a party to and also part of the 1995 Settlement Agreement,
the First Claimant can invoke its contractual rights thereunder in regard to the
release in Article 5.1 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement and Article IV of the 1998
Final Release as fully as the Second Claimant as a signatory party and named
Releasee;

(3) The scope of the releases in Article 5 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement and
Article IV of the 1998 Final Release made by the Respondent to the First and
Second Claimants does not extend to any environmental claim made by an
individual for personal harm in respect of that individual’s rights separate and
different from the Respondent; but it does have legal effect under Ecuadorian law
precluding any “diffuse” claim against the First and Second Claimants under
Article 19-2 of the Constitution made by the Respondent and also made by any
individual not claiming personal harm (actual or threatened); ...”.

12 November 2013: The Cassation (National) Court issues its Judgment affirming part
of the Lago Agrio Judgment; but it nullifies the punitive damages imposed for

Chevron’s omission to “apologise”, as required by that Judgment and as upheld by the

6 C2305.

Appellate Court.*”’ As a result, the Cassation Court reduces the Lago Agrio Judgment’s
award of damages to US$ 8,000,646,160. (The Cassation Court’s Judgment is

considered at greater length in Part V below).

15 October — 26 November 2013: The RICO trial in New York is heard before the US
District Court for the Southern District of New York (Judge Kaplan). The plaintiff was
Chevron and the defendants included Steven Donziger, the Law Offices of Steven R.
Donziger and Donziger Associates PLLC (the “Donziger defendants”), with Hugo
Gerardo Camacho Naranjo and Javier Piaguaje Payaguaje (two of the Lago Agrio

Plaintiffs).

During the RICO trial, the following factual witnesses were examined orally, amongst

others: Dr Zambrano, Mr Donziger and Dr Guerra.

23 December 2013: Chevron submits an “extraordinary action for protection to the
Constitutional Court.*?* It is admitted for consideration by the Constitutional Court on

20 March 2014.
2014

4 March 2014: The US District Court for the Southern District of New York (Judge
Kaplan) issues its judgment and related Orders in the RICO Litigation (“the
RICO Judgment”).*”?

The US District Court states in the “Conclusion” to the RICO Judgment (with references

here omitted):

“The saga of the Lago Agrio case is sad. It is distressing that the course of justice
was perverted. The LAPs received the zealous representation they wanted, but it is
sad that it was not always characterized by honor and honesty as well. It is
troubling that, in the words of Jeffrey Shinder [a New York attorney retained by the
Lago Agrio Plaintiffs], what happened here probably means that ‘we’ll never know
whether or not there was a case to be made against Chevron.’

But we have come full circle. As the Court wrote at the outset, ‘[t]he issue in this
case is not what happened in the Oriente more than twenty years ago and who, if
anyone, now is responsible for any wrongs then done. The issue here, instead, is

27. C.1975.
“28 See the Claimants’ letter dated 19 March 2018, p. 2; and the Respondent's letter dated 20 April 2018, pp. 1-2.

whether a court decision was procured by corrupt means, regardless of whether the
cause was just.’

The decision in the Lago Agrio case was obtained by corrupt means. The defendants
here may not be allowed to benefit from that in any way. The order entered today
will prevent them from doing so.

The foregoing, together with the appendices to this opinion, constitute the Court’s
findings of fact and conclusions of law. Defendants’ motions to dismiss are denied.”

4.483. In the Order appended to the RICO Judgment, the Court orders, adjudges and decrees
as regards the Donziger Defendants and the LAP Representatives (inter alia) as

follows:*°°

“I. The Court hereby imposes a constructive trust for the benefit of Chevron on all

property, whether personal or real, tangible or intangible, vested or contingent,
that Donziger has received, or hereafter may receive, directly or indirectly, or to
which Donziger now has, or hereafter obtains, any right, title or interest, directly
or indirectly, that is traceable to the Judgment or the enforcement of the Judgment
anywhere in the world including, without limitation, all rights to any contingent fee
under the Retainer Agreement and all stock in Amazonia. Donziger shall transfer
and forthwith assign to Chevron all such property that he now has or hereafter may
obtain.

2. The Court hereby imposes a constructive trust for the benefit of Chevron on all
property, whether personal or real, tangible or intangible, vested or contingent,
that the LAP Representatives, and each of them, has received, or hereafter may
receive, directly or indirectly, or to which the LAP Representatives, and each of
them, now has, or hereafter obtains, any right, title or interest, directly or indirectly,
that is traceable to the Judgment or the enforcement of the Judgment anywhere in
the world. The LAP Representatives, and each of them, shall transfer and forthwith
assign to Chevron all such property that he now has or hereafter may obtain.

3. Donziger shall execute in favor of Chevron a stock power transferring to
Chevron all of his right, title and interest in his shares of Amazonia, and Donziger
and the LAP Representatives, and each of them, shall execute such other and further
documents as Chevron reasonably may request or as the Court hereafter may order
to effectuate the foregoing provisions of this Judgment.

4. Donziger and the LAP Representatives, and each of them, is hereby enjoined and
restrained from:

4.2. Seeking prejudgment seizure or attachment of assets based upon the Judgment

enjoined and restrained from undertaking any acts to monetize or profit from the
Judgment, as modified or amended, or any New Judgment, including without
limitation by selling, assigning, pledging, transferring or encumbering any interest

them, jointly and severally, the costs of this action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.

4.484. The RICO Judgment is appealed by the Donziger Defendants to the US Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit.

2015-2018

4.485. 12 March 2015: This Tribunal issues its Decision on Track IB (see Annex 1(K) to Part

T above). It there decides (inter alia), by a majority:

“(1) The Lago Agrio Complaint of 7 May 2003, as an initial pleading, included
individual claims resting upon individual rights under Ecuadorian law, not falling
within the scope of the 1995 Settlement Agreement (as invoked by the Claimants);

Part IV — Page 126

(2) The Lago Agrio Complaint was not wholly barred at its inception by res
judicata, under Ecuadorian law, by virtue of the 1995 Settlement Agreement (as
invoked by the Claimants); and

(3) The Lago Agrio Complaint included individual claims materially similar, in
substance, to the individual claims made by the Aguinda Plaintiffs in New York.”

4.486. 20 April 2015: The RICO appellate hearing is heard before the US Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit. (Its judgment, dismissing the appeal, is issued on 8 August 2016.

The US Supreme Court denies certioriari on 29 June 2017).

4.487. 13 July 2016: By letter with attachments dated 21 July 2016, the Respondent informs

the Tribunal as follows:

“By letter dated 13 July 2016 [a copy of which was attached, with an English
translation] the State’s prosecutor [the Fiscalia General del Estado, or “FGE”]
ordered the Attorney General’s Office to produce within 15 days certified copies of
any testimony given by Mr Steven Donziger that is part of the record of these
arbitral proceedings. The letter notes that the Office of the Prosecutor opened this
preliminary investigation, Case No. 235-2010, in response to a 7 June 2010 letter
from Thomas F. Cullen, counsel for Chevron Corporation. The investigation, which
is now in its sixth year but obviously active, includes ‘three boxes of documents’
furnished to Prosecutor by Chevron. According to Claimants, this is the criminal
investigation requested by Chevron into the alleged ‘extensive evidence of
wholesale corruption in the court process.’ See Claimants’ Suppl. Track II
Memorial { 37. ?!

As we have advised previously, criminal investigations are governed by rules of
secrecy. The Office of the Attorney General does not know the subjects or the
direction of the investigation. However, under Ecuadorian law, Chevron - as the
complaining party - at all times had access to the investigatory developments and
either knew or should have known of the pendency of the investigation and the
Prosecutor’s decision to consider the documents furnished by Chevron.”

4.488. As the FGE letter makes clear, this preliminary investigation “for the suspected crime
of forging public documents” followed the report made by Mr Cullen (of Chevron) on

7 June 2010 to the “Fiscalia Provincial de Sucumbios.” The investigation is said to

 

+3! The Claimants’ pleading reads: “...it was Ecuador and its courts that did nothing to stop or correct the fraud,
despite the extensive evidence of wholesale corruption in the court process. The Lago Agrio Court denied every
motion filed by Chevron that brought the Cabrera’s misconduct and the fraud to the Court's attention. Neither the
Lago Agrio Court nor any other authority in Ecuador did anything to sanction the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs or their
representatives, or the judges in the Lago Agrio Litigation, with respect to the Cabrera fraud. Instead, those State
authorities ignored Chevron’s complaints and the uncontradicted evidence exposing that corruption. This failure
to take legal action against those involved in the Cabrera fraud constitutes ratification of those actions by the
State.”

include a written report dated 31 July 2014 consisting of 14,791 pages made by the

“Fiscal” of the Province of Sucumbios to the FGE.

19 March 2018: By letter (with attachments) dated 19 March 2018, the Claimants
inform the Tribunal about the status of the criminal investigations against the Lago

Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives (footnotes here omitted):

“Beginning in August 2009, Chevron has sent a series of letters to Ecuador’s
Prosecutor General and local prosecutors, summarizing the evidence of the LAPs’
misconduct, attaching the evidence, and requesting criminal investigations. In
response, three preliminary investigations were opened: (a) the Prosecutor
General opened a preliminary investigation in September 2009 into an alleged
bribery solicitation scheme involving former Judge Juan Niifiez, who was then
presiding over the Lago Agrio case pending in the Sucumbios Provincial Court,
and other third parties; (b) the Sucumbios Provincial Prosecutor opened a
preliminary investigation in April 2010 into the alleged crime of falsification of
documents committed by the LAPs’ representatives; and (c) the Sucumbios
Provincial Prosecutor opened a preliminary investigation in July 2010 into the
alleged crime of perjury committed by Richard Cabrera and others.

The first preliminary investigation focused on an alleged bribery solicitation
scheme in which then Judge Niifiez and the other participants were recorded on
video discussing the payment of a bribe in exchange for the issuance of a multi-
billion dollar judgment against Chevron in the Lago Agrio case. Despite the
unrefuted evidence provided by Chevron, Ecuador’s Prosecutor General not only
rejected Chevron’s complaints and refused to bring charges against Judge Niiftez
or others, but accused Chevron’s counsel of being “malicious and reckless” in
filing the complaint and having caused “damage to Ecuador’s national image.” At
the Prosecutor’s request and over Chevron’s objections, the National Court of
Justice closed the investigation on September 30, 2013, and found that Chevron’s
counsel’s letter — which had prompted the investigation — was reckless and
malicious.

 

The second and third preliminary investigations focus on the LAPs’ ghostwriting of
the Cabrera report and supplemental report and their ghostwriting of official
communications filed by Cabrera, while the third preliminary investigation also
focuses on the LAPs’ falsification of the Calmbacher report and their ghostwriting
of the Lago Agrio Judgment. Over the years, the Sucumbios Provincial Prosecutor
has received from Chevron several formal submissions in these investigations
detailing the overwhelming evidence of misconduct and fraud. Yet to this day, these
investigations remain pending, and the Prosecutor has not brought formal charges
against anyone concerning these investigations.”

20 April 2018: By letter (with attachments) dated 20 April 2018, the Respondent

provides the following update on the status of the Criminal Investigations in Ecuador:

Part IV — Page 128

4.491.

4.492.

4.493.

“The Office of the Procurador (the Attorney General with respect to civil matters)
received a request for documents and transcripts in its possession relating to the
testimony of Steven Donziger, a request with which the Procurador has complied.
The caption of the correspondence, and the nature of the request, plainly indicate
that, at least at the time of that request (see Respondent’s Letter to the Tribunal
dated 21 July 2016), there was an active and ongoing investigation into Chevron’s
allegations that Mr Donziger and others acted unlawfully in respect to the Lago
Agrio court proceedings. The Office of the Procurador is unaware if that matter
has been closed, that is, it is unaware of any court order granting an application to
close the matter. We thus have every reason to believe that the investigation
remains open and active. As the complaining party, Chevron would, in the regular
course, be apprised of any decision to charge any persons of a crime arising out of
that investigation, or alternatively, upon the closure of the investigation.

Like the investigation of Mr Donziger and his associates, the investigation of Mr
Guerra - consistent with the rules governing criminal investigations - is not a public
investigation. Like any other criminal investigation, the subject of that
investigation, here, Mr Guerra, would be apprised of any decision to charge him
(or any person) of a crime arising out of that investigation, or alternatively, upon
the closure of the investigation. Claimants have reported that the Prosecutor has
filed a motion to close the case. Ecuador has no information contrary to Chevron’s
representation. We note that a motion to close the case - while available to
Chevron’s client, Mr Guerra - is not available to the Republic’s civil attorneys and
is not a public document. If and when granted, however, the Court’s order will be
public and the matter closed.”

As at the date of this Award, whilst criminal investigations may be continuing in a
confidential manner, there is no material before the Tribunal as to its further progress,
scope or end-result. In the meantime, the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs are still seeking to
enforce the Lago Agrio Judgment outside Ecuador, as summarised above and, probably,

elsewhere as envisaged by the “Invictus” Memorandum (see above).

27 June 2018: The Constitutional Court issues its Judgment on 27 June 2018, affirming
the Judgment of the Cassation (National) Court (2013), following public hearings held
on 16 July 2015 and 22 May 2018. The Constitutional Court declares that there is no
violation of constitutional law, as alleged by Chevron; the Court rejects the
extraordinary action of protection made by Chevron; and it orders its judgment “[t]o be

recorded, published and enforced.”43?

The Tribunal turns, in the next Part V of this Award, to the Lago Agrio Court Judgment,

the Lago Agrio Appellate Judgment, the Cassation Court Judgment and the Judgment

2.02551.

PART V

THE LAGO AGRIO, APPELLATE, CASSATION AND
CONSTITUTIONAL COURT JUDGMENTS

A: Introduction

In this Part V, the Tribunal addresses the factual and non-forensic issues relating to the
Lago Agrio Judgment of 14 February 2011, the judgment of the Lago Agrio Appellate
Court of 3 January 2012, the judgment of the Cassation Court of 12 November 2013
and the judgment of the Constitutional Court of 27 June 2018.

B: The Lago Agrio Judgment (2011)

On 14 February 2011, as indicated above, the Lago Agrio Court (Judge Zambrano)
issues the Lago Agrio Judgment.'! The Lago Agrio Judgment is later clarified by the
Lago Agrio Court (Judge Zambrano) by a Clarification Order on 4 March 2011.7 It
awards US$ 18.2 billion in damages to be paid by Chevron, including US$ 8.6 billion
as punitive damages subject to a timely public apology by Chevron, with a 10% award

to the ADF.

The Lago Agrio Judgment extends to about 88,000 words and 188 pages, typed in single
spacing in unbroken text, with no line or paragraph numbering, page breaks or table of
contents. It is divided into 15 Parts, with many internal sub-sections. Part 1 on
“Competence” or jurisdiction (p.4), Part 2 on the form of Lago Agrio Litigation (p.6),
Part 3 on Chevron’s defences (p.6), Part 4 on the Parties’ motions (p.35), Part 5 on due
process (p.60), Part 6 on Ecuadorian environmental legislation (p.60), Part 7 on the basis
of civil liability (p.74), Part 8 on the nature of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ claims,
including Article 43 of the EMA (p.90), Part 9 on the material facts (p.92), Part 10 on
causation (p.154), Part 11 on “fault” (p.175), Part 12 on the 1995 Settlement Agreement

(p.175), Part 13 on measures of redress for the harm (p.176), Part 14 on Chevron’s “bad

faith” and punitive damages (p.184), and Part 15 on the establishment of a commercial

trust as the beneficiary of compensation (p.186).

At least at first sight, particularly to a non-lawyer unfamiliar with the Lago Agrio
Litigation, the Lago Agrio Judgment appears to be a lengthy, detailed, reasoned and

powerful decision.

As to non-punitive damages, the Lago Agrio Judgment awards: (i) US$ 5,396,160,000
to “recover the natural condition of the soil impacted by TexPet’s activities”;* (ii) US$
1.4 billion for a “health improvement plan” to “cover the health needs created by the
public health problem occasioned by the acts of the defendant [sic: Chevron]”;* (iii)
US$ 100 million for a “community reconstruction and ethnic reaffirmation program” to
redress “cultural harm’”;> (iv) US$ 150 million for the construction of “a potable water
system or systems” to “benefit the persons who inhabit the area that was operated by the
defendant [sic: Chevron]’;° (v) US$ 800 million for “a plan of health which shall
necessarily include treatment for the persons who suffer from cancer that can be
attributed to TexPet’s operation in the Concession” (not being the Lago Agrio
Plaintiffs);” (vi) US$ 200 million “to recover the native flora, fauna, and the aquatic life

of the zone”;* and (vii) US$ 600 million for “the cleanup of groundwater”.?

As to the “trust” as the beneficiary of compensation, the Lago Agrio Judgment envisages
a “commercial trust, to be administered by one of the fund [i.e. the ADF] and trust
administrator companies located in Ecuador.”!° The beneficiary of the trust “shall be
the Amazon Defense Front or the person or persons it designates, considering that ‘those
affected’ by the environmental harm are undetermined ...”. The “representatives of the
Defense Front, or those they designate on behalf of the affected persons, will constitute
the board of the trust ...”. Thus, the proceeds of the Lago Agrio Judgment were to be
controlled by the ADF and not, at least directly, by the individuals comprising the Lago
Agrio Plaintiffs.

In addition, Chevron was ordered “to satisfy an additional 10% of the amount ordered
as reparation of harm in [the] name of the Amazon Defense Front, with costs.!! Apart
from costs, this “reparation” appears to represent a payment due from Chevron of either

US$ 1.82 billion or US$ 864 million to the ADF.

The actual drafting of the Lago Agrio Judgment is, inevitably, the subject of a wide-
ranging controversy between the Parties. The forensic expert issues are considered in
the next Part VI of this Award. For the time being, the Tribunal confines itself to factual

and other non-forensic expert issues below, in this Part V.

Dr Zambrano testified in the RICO Litigation that he started drafting the Judgment in
mid-November 2010, after the Lago Agrio Court had purchased the “New Computer”

for his use.

Dr Zambrano also testified that he prepared the Judgment all by himself (with the
assistance of his student secretary, Ms “ory? between mid-November 2010 and 14
February 2011, a period of three months when he also had to attend to other unrelated
cases pending before him in the Lago Agrio Court. He also testified, more than once,
that he had prepared the whole of the Judgment on the New Computer because it was
“the more modern computer.” '3 Tn fact, based on objective evidence, his use of the New

Computer could not have begun before 26 November 2010.'*

If Dr Zambrano is correct, he drafted the Lago Agrio Judgment in a period of less than
three months, or 81 consecutive days (i.e. 26 November 2010 to 14 February 2011),
based on a court file of some 237,000 pages that included more than 100 expert reports
and many legal submissions. Given his other work on unrelated court cases, whilst not
absolutely impossible, this achievement within such a short time seems inherently

unlikely.

During this period, Judge Zambrano gave several interviews to the press. In the report

published by Reuters on 31 January 2011,'° Judge Zambrano is described as follows:

“\.. The chairs and sofa in Zambrano’s office are littered with 100-page makeshift
notebooks full of evidence, each packet held together with white string. ‘There’s
barely any place left to sit,’ Zambrano joked with Reuters during a recent visit to
his chambers in Lago Agrio, a hardscrabble Amazon town near the Colombian
border. ‘I have about 500 notebooks to go,’ he said, holding his battered reading
glasses in his hand and smiling. ‘Not much.’ He has already gone through 1,500 of
the packets and is widely expected to issue his verdict later this year, although he
declined to comment on the possible timing of his ruling ...”

It is impossible for the Tribunal to accept these statements literally.

Each of these “notebooks” or “packets” (i.e. cuerpos) contain some 100 pages, so that
1,500 cuerpos, as reported, would correspond to some 150,000 pages. '® With 500
cuerpos “to go”, it would mean that Judge Zambrano had still to study 50,000 pages in
the 14 or so days remaining before the Lago Agrio Judgment was issued on 14 February
2011, an average of about 3,500 pages daily without allowing any time for drafting the
Judgment or other unrelated judicial work. As for the 150,000 pages already studied
before 31 January 2011, that would mean an average of about 2,230 pages daily (from
26 November 2010, running consecutively), again without allowing any time for

drafting the Judgment, other unrelated judicial work or non-working days.

Even allowing for the facts that not every page in every cuerpo might require Judge
Zambrano’s consideration, that he might be a better than average speed-reader of
technical documentation and that he might be a superlatively efficient judicial
draftsman, there still arise troubling questions as to the feasibility of his preparing,
alone, the Lago Agrio Court Judgment from the court file in the time and manner

described by him.

The Tribunal notes the expert report of Professor Keith Rayner, a cognitive psychologist
and specialist in the scientific study of reading, adduced by the Claimants. '? He
concluded that: “given the limitations on human readers processing capabilities (both in
terms of acuity limitations and attention limitations), reading rate with good
comprehension is limited to 300-400 wpm”. Thus, so the Tribunal calculates, if the
2,000 or so cuerpos (corresponding to 200,000 pages) averaged 300 words a page (as

Professor Rayner calculated), Judge Zambrano would have needed, with a reading rate

‘6 In Judge Zambrano’s interview with Expreso on 18 December 2010, there is a reference to “2,122 cuerpos”,
corresponding to about 212,200 pages (C-896, p. 1).

of 300 words per minute, at least 138 consecutive 24-hour working days to study the
court file. On the account given by Judge Zambrano, he did not have the time to achieve

this.

As to research into foreign laws, Dr Zambrano (who does not speak English) testified
that his temporary student secretary (Ms “C’”) undertook legal research on the Internet
and found the cases from America, Australia and England cited in the Lago Agrio
Judgment, using Internet services for translation into Spanish.'* As explained below,

there arise troubling questions as to such foreign legal research, as described by him.

In the Tribunal’s view, as also explained later below, the circumstantial and other
evidence, including testimony by Dr Zambrano in the RICO Litigation, does not support
Dr Zambrano’s account of writing the Lago Agrio Judgment. Conversely, as explained
below, it supports the Claimants’ case that the Lago Agrio Judgment was not prepared
by Judge Zambrano, but, at least in material part, that it was ‘ghostwritten’ by certain of

the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives with Judge Zambrano’s corrupt connivance.
C: The Lago Agrio Judgment - The “Merger” between Texaco and Chevron

The Lago Agrio Judgment contains a lengthy passage addressing the issue of the
“merger” (“fusién” in Spanish) between Texaco and Chevron, resulting in Chevron
standing in the shoes of both Texaco and (as Texaco’s “fourth level subsidiary’) TexPet.
It is best cited at length from pp. 6-26 of the Lago Agrio Judgment, as set out below
(with added line references for ease of reference) in Annex 7 to this Part V.!° It proceeds
on the basis that Chevron is the sole defendant in the Lago Agrio Litigation; it accepts
that Texaco “is not a party in this lawsuit” (Line 204); and it assumes that TexPet also

is not a co-defendant in the Lago Agrio Litigation.

In brief, the Lago Agrio Judgment lifts the “corporate veils” between Chevron, Texaco
and TexPet, so that Chevron bears the obligations and liabilities of both Texaco and
TexPet. It invokes, in numerous passages, the principle of good faith under Ecuadorian
law (Lines 163, 174, 221, 293, 310, 332 and 446). It notes: “It is appropriate to recall
that in our legal system the principle prevails that that no one can benefit from his bad

faith” (Lines 221-222). In support, it refers to foreign legal materials, including court

judgments and laws of the state of Delaware, the USA and North America (Lines 251,
309, 312, 314 and 329).

As regards the “merger” between Chevron and Texaco, it attributes “serious doubts as
to the good faith with [sic: which] the defendant [Chevron] acted in this lawsuit” (Lines
332-333). It decides: “The law serves justice, and cannot allow legal institutions to be
manipulated for illegitimate purposes, such as to favour a fraud or to promote injustice,
which would be the case of transferring the assets to one corporation ‘free of
responsibility’, while the responsibilities are kept in a company ‘free of assets’, the way
the defendant tries to have us understand the transaction that took place between
Chevron and Texaco, in which the new company benefits from the combined

companies, but fails to mention the obligations.” (Lines 237-243).

As to the undertaking made by Texaco as a condition of the stay of proceedings in the
Aguinda Litigation, it decides: “In this way the obligation to submit to Ecuadorian
justice pending on Texaco Inc. was also transmitted to new company Chevron Texaco
Corporation, so that consequently Chevron Corp. cannot allege that it never operated in
Ecuador to give grounds for lack of a legitimate opposing party” (Lines 299-302). It
concludes: “It is appropriate, for the purposes of justice, to impose on Chevron Corp.,

which benefits from the ‘merger’, the obligations of Texaco Inc.” (Lines 325-327).

As regards TexPet, it accepts the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ Complaint that: “In reality,
Texpet was nothing more than a screen behind which Texaco Inc. acted...” (Lines 339-
340). It finds: “In this case, it has been proven that in reality TexPet and Texaco Inc.
functioned in Ecuador as a single and inseparable operation.” (Lines 627-628). It
concludes: “... considering the foregoing analysis, the exceptional but justified need has
been established in this case to lift any corporate veil that separates [Texaco from
TexPet] given that it has been proven that it [TexPet] was a company with a capital very
inferior to the volume of its operations, that required constant authorizations and
investments from the parent company [Texaco] to carry out the normal course of
business of its commercial activity, that the executives were the same in both companies,
and principally the obvious fact that not lifting the corporate veil would imply a

‘manifest injustice’.” (Lines 664-671).

The Tribunal returns to the legal consequences of this analysis below in Part VII, on the

issue of jurisdiction under the Treaty.
D: The Lago Agrio Judgment - “Unfiled Materials”

The Claimants contend that the Lago Agrio Judgment incorporates (without attribution)
eight sets of material which were never actually filed by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs during
the Lago Agrio Litigation, and were thus never seen by the Claimants during that
Litigation. The Claimants allege that these materials were corruptly used by the Lago
Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives, with Judge Zambrano’s connivance, in the

‘ghostwriting’ of the Lago Agrio Judgment.

These eight materials are: (1) the Clapp Report;”° (2) the Draft Alegato;7! (3) the Erion
Memorandum; (4) the Fajardo Trust Email;?? (5) the Fusién Memorandum; (6) the
January and June Index Summaries;”* (7) the Moodie Memorandum;”° and (8) the Selva

Viva Database.””

The Respondent accepts that three of these materials were used in the Lago Agrio
Judgment: (1) the Clapp Report, (5) the Fusién Memorandum and (8) the Selva Viva

Database.”*

There is, however an important preliminary issue as to whether any of these “unfiled”
materials were in fact unfiled with the Lago Agrio Court. The files of the Lago Agrio
Litigation held (on paper) by the Lago Agrio Court comprised approximately 217,000

pages of documentation.

The Claimants contend that under Ecuadorian law, as Dr Santiago Velazquez Coello
testified, every document added to the court record of the Lago Agrio Litigation was
required to be acknowledged by a court order, hand-numbered by the Court’s clerk and

invariably sewn into a “cuerpo”, each of which consisted of 100 pages of

documentation. Further, under no circumstances may an Ecuadorian judge base his

judgment on a document not so included in the court record.”

As already indicated, the Respondent does not dispute the use of certain of these
materials in the Lago Agrio Judgment; but it disputes that any of them were not filed by
the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs with the Lago Agrio Court.*® The Respondent contends that
the Lago Agrio Court could have maintained its records improperly or that these
materials had been presented to the Court in person or informally by the Lago Agrio
Plaintiffs’ representatives during one or more of the judicial inspections (attended by
Chevron’s representatives). The Respondent concludes that, in these circumstances, it
is quite impossible for any person to know the universe of the documents submitted to
the Lago Agrio Court.*! The Respondent does not, however, seek to defend the use by
an Ecuadorian Court of evidential materials not openly submitted by the disputing

parties to an Ecuadorian court, formally or informally.

The Claimants adduced expert testimony from Dr Patrick Juola and Mr Samuel
Hernandez. These experts conducted different forms of review of the Lago Agrio
Court’s record. These reviews included both OCR and hand-review. As to the latter, Dr
Juola testified that about 100,000 pages of the record were hand-reviewed.*? In their
expert testimonies, both Dr Juola and Mr Hernandez confirmed that none of these eight
materials are to be found in the court record. As to the Respondent’s allegation that these
materials were submitted informally, the unfiled documents were not found amongst the
papers of Chevron’s lawyers (who attended the judicial inspections), which (according
to these experts) discounts this ‘informal’ explanation. The Tribunal accepts this expert

evidence.

There is a third explanation provided by Judge Zambrano himself. In his Declaration in

the RICO Litigation in the USA, Dr Zambrano testified how the content of the Lago
Agrio Plaintiffs’ “unfiled documents” appeared in the Lago Agrio Judgment:

“[O]ccasionally documents related to the case that were not incorporated into the
process were left at the door to my office at the Court. ... I verified all of that
information regarding the case, that is to say, I made sure that it was not false

information and also that the basis for such information is in the record. This was
relevant information that, as I read it, I realized it could be of use in my decision.”**

The Tribunal notes that this third explanation required the “basis” for such additional
documentary information to have been “in the record” of the Lago Agrio Court. Such
information could not, therefore be entirely new, unfiled information. The eight
materials at issue were new information. Accordingly, in the Tribunal’s view, this third
explanation must be discounted. The Tribunal also notes that the Lago Agrio Judgment
itself states: “... the Presidency should only consider the elements that form part of the

proceeding ...”. (see Annex 7 to this Part V below, Lines 41-42).

Whilst it is near-impossible to prove conclusively a negative, the Tribunal accepts, as
the overwhelmingly probable explanation, that none of these eight materials had been
filed with the Lago Agrio Court; that all were ‘new’ documents (without “a basis ... in
the record’’); and that none were disclosed to or known by Chevron in the Lago Agrio
Litigation, whether formally or informally. It is significant that all these materials favour
the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs, not Chevron. It is also significant that the Respondent has not
advanced any cogent explanation to this Tribunal, from any factual or expert witness,
as to why these eight materials cannot be found in the record held by the Lago Agrio
Court. It is also significant that the Respondent has not produced any of the disputed
documents from the court record. At this point, the evidential burden of proof shifted to

the Respondent. It was not discharged by the Respondent.

As explained below, the Tribunal finds, based on the evidence as a whole, that the
contents of these unfiled materials were used by certain of the Lago Agrio

representatives for the purpose of ‘ghostwriting’ the Lago Agrio Judgment.

(1) The Clapp Report: In brief, this document is a 37 page report of November 2006,
drafted in Spanish by Dr Richard W. Clapp and others, as experts to the Lago Agrio
Plaintiffs.** The report addresses the health impacts of TexPet’s exploitation of the
concession, concluding (inter alia) that soil and water samples indicated an excess of

lead in the former Concession Area.

5.41.

The Respondent accepts that the Clapp Report was used in the Lago Agrio Judgment.
There is no evidence showing that this document was ever submitted by the Lago Agrio

Plaintiffs to the Lago Agrio Court.

Parts of the Clapp Report (not already covertly used by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’
representatives in Annex K to the Cabrera Report) appear in Part 9 of the Lago Agrio
Judgment in regard to contamination.*® There is no evidence that these parts of the Clapp
Report were submitted by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs to the Lago Agrio Court. No such
documentation can be found in the record of the Lago Agrio Court. The Respondent
speculates that this unfiled documentation was informally submitted by the Lago Agrio
Plaintiffs’ representatives at a judicial inspection in April 2007. At that time, the judge
of the Lago Agrio Court was Judge Yanez (not Judge Zambrano). There is no evidence

to support such speculation; and the Tribunal does not accept it.

Dr Leonard testified as to verbatim strings of words copied from the unfiled parts of the
Clapp Report into the Lago Agrio Judgment, such as the latter’s conclusion that oil and
water samples indicated an excess of lead creating a real risk of lead poisoning.*° That
is self-evident from a comparison between page 7 of the Clapp Report and pages 109 to
110 of the Lago Agrio Judgment (in the original Spanish version): see Dr Leonard’s

Example 11 of his second expert report, reproduced below in Annex 8(1) to this Part V.

These are also evident from Dr Leonard’s Exhibit 5 in his second expert report,
reproduced as Annex 9 to this Part V (pp. 116-117). It is a copy of the Lago Agrio
Judgment highlighted to show strings of text and symbols which were copied from the

Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ unfiled materials: for the Clapp Report (original pp. 109-110).

The Tribunal concludes that material parts of the unfiled Clapp Report were used in the

‘ghostwriting’ of the Lago Agrio Judgment.

(2) The Draft Alegato: In brief, this document is a draft Alegato (“argument”) of 11
November 2010, drafted in Spanish ostensibly for submission to the Lago Agrio

Court.*” It is a different document from the Alegatos actually filed by the Lago Agrio

Plaintiffs with the Lago Agrio Court on 23 December 2010, 17 January 2011 and 1
February 2011.

There is no evidence that this draft Alegato was ever submitted by the Lago Agrio

Plaintiffs to the Lago Agrio Court in the Lago Agrio Litigation.

In his expert testimony, Dr Leonard identified in the Lago Agrio Judgment several
strings of texts and symbols in the unfiled draft Alegato that were not present in the filed
Alegatos:** see his Example 14 in his second expert report comparing the unfiled draft
Alegato (page 61) with the Lago Agrio Judgment (page 24) and the filed Final Alegato
(page 99), reproduced in Annex 8(2) below.

These are also evident from Dr Leonard’s Exhibit 5 in his second expert report,
reproduced as Annex 9 to this Part V: for the unfiled Draft Alegato, see pp. 23-24
(original pp. 93-94).

The Tribunal concludes that material parts of the unfiled Draft Alegato were used in the

‘ghostwriting’ of the Lago Agrio Judgment.

(3) The Erion Memorandum: In brief, this document of 18 August 2008, attached to an
email from Mr Erion to Mr Donziger of 11 November 2009, is a six-page research note,
written in English by Mr Graham Erion, a US lawyer working as an intern with the Lago
Agrio Plaintiff's legal representatives.*? It addresses Chevron’s case that it was not a
proper defendant in the Lago Agrio Litigation because (inter alia) the “reverse triangular
merger” between Chevron and Texaco maintained Texaco’s separate corporate identity.
The author analyses the factual materials and the principles of Delaware and other US
laws on merger and on piercing the corporate veil by the Delaware Courts, as regards

Texaco, TexPet and Chevron.

There is no evidence showing that this document was ever submitted by the Lago Agrio

Plaintiffs to the Lago Agrio Court.

It is evident that parts of the Erion Memorandum are reproduced (in Spanish) in the draft

judgment of 21 December 2010 (the “21/12 Providencias”) on Judge Zambrano’s Old

38 Leonard ER 1, Exhibits A & C; Leonard ER 2, Exhibits 5 & 7.
39-2416. (The Tribunal has seen no evidence connecting Mr Erion personally with any improper conduct alleged
by the Claimants against the Lago Agrio Plaintiff's representatives).

Computer, including the citation to four US judgments from New Jersey and Oklahoma:
see page 3 of the Erion Memorandum and page 16 of the 21/12 Providencias. Without
citing the names of these US cases, the Lago Agrio Judgment refers to their principles
on substance (over form), manifest injustice and patent injustice decided “by the Courts

of the US” (pages 15- 16).

In his expert testimony, Dr Leonard identified the use of the Erion Memorandum in the
Lago Agrio Judgment: see the example comparing the Erion Memorandum (page 5), the
“21/12 Providencias” (page 14) and the Lago Agrio Judgment (page 13), reproduced in
Annex 8(3) below.

The Tribunal concludes that material parts of the unfiled Erion Memorandum were used

in the ‘ghostwriting’ of the Lago Agrio Judgment.

(4) The Fajardo Trust Email: In brief, this document is a 1% page email sent by
Mr Fajardo to Messrs Prieto, Saenz and Donziger on 18 June 2009.*° As explained in
Part IV above, it also sets out an unidentified extract of text in Spanish from the decision
of the Ecuadorian Supreme Court in Andrade v Conelec (No. 168-2007, of 11 April
2007), relating to the establishment of a trust to hold an award of damages made by a

court.

There is no evidence showing that any part of this document was ever submitted by the

Lago Agrio Plaintiffs to the Lago Agrio Court in the Lago Agrio Litigation.

As Dr Leonard testified, the email contains errors, misquotations, miscitations and
strings of words that are to be found, verbatim, in the Lago Agrio Judgment but not in
the official report of the Andrade judgment.*! That is evident from a comparison
between the first page of the email and page 186 of the Lago Agrio Judgment: see Annex

8(4) below, reproducing Dr Leonard’s Example 9 from his second expert report.

These are also evident from Dr Leonard’s Exhibit 5 in his second expert report,
reproduced as Annex 9 to this Part V: for the unfiled Fajardo Trust Email, see page 110

(original p 186).

The Respondent’s explanation for this coincidence is that both Mr Fajardo and Judge
Zambrano were coincidentally working from an unofficial version of the Supreme
Court’s judgment, even where, in the same Lago Agrio Judgment, Judge Zambrano cites
the official version of that Supreme Court judgment. The Respondent’s explanation is

speculation unsupported by any cogent evidence. It is not accepted by the Tribunal.

The Tribunal concludes that material parts of the unfiled Fajardo Trust Email were used

in the ‘ghostwriting’ of the Lago Agrio Judgment.

(5) The Fusién Memorandum: In brief, this document is a 20-page memorandum in the
Spanish language that appears to have been drafted on or shortly before 15 November
2007. It was sent by email dated 15 November 2007 from Mr Saenz to (inter alios)
Messrs Donziger, Ponce and Prieto.*? The memorandum (inter alia) describes: (i) the
factual nature of the relationship between Texaco Inc and Texpet; and (ii) the nature of

the “merger” between Texaco and Chevron.

As Dr Leonard testified, substantial parts of the Fusién Memorandum appear verbatim
in the Lago Agrio Judgment.* The Judgment shares the same identical or near-identical
strings of more than 90 words; the same idiosyncratic use of shorthand references; and
out-of-order numerical ordering. That is evident from pages 20, 21 and 24 of the Lago
Agrio Judgment: see Annex 8(5) below, reproducing Example | to Dr Leonard’s second
expert report (comparing page 8 of the Fusion Memorandum and page 24 of the Lago
Agrio Judgment). It is also evident (as regards out-of-order numbering) at page 5 of the
Fusién Memorandum and page 21 of the Lago Agrio Judgment (re 6964”) see also
Annex 8(5) below.

It is also evident from Dr Leonard’s Exhibit 5 in his second expert report, reproduced
as Annex 9 to this Part V: for the Fusi6n Memorandum, see pages 90-92 and 94-95
(original pp. 20, 21, 22, 24 & 25).

The Respondent does not dispute that the Fusion Memorandum was used in the Lago

Agrio Judgment. It contends, however, that its subject-matter, i.e. the “merger” between

Texaco and Chevron, was debated between the parties during the judicial inspection on

12 June 2008.

At that time, the Lago Agrio Litigation was assigned to Judge Novillo (not Judge
Zambrano). No evidence supporting the document’s use exists in any of the email
messages passing between the Lago Agrio plaintiffs’ representatives at the time of this
judicial inspection, where the documents to be submitted to the Lago Agrio Court were
being considered by them, including documentation on “fusién”. In none of these
messages dated 9 June 2008, passing between Mr Donziger, Mr Sdenz and Mr Erion is
the Fusion Memorandum listed amongst those documents. *° Further, the Fusién
Memorandum does not appear in the Lago Agrio Court’s formal protocol and acta

recording documentation submitted by the parties during this judicial inspection.*”

If the Fusi6n Memorandum was nonetheless then informally submitted to the Lago
Court by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives and unrecorded, it is significant that
no witness from the Lago Agrio Court was called by the Respondent to support the
suggestion made by the Respondent. In the circumstances, that suggestion remains

unproven speculation. It is not accepted by the Tribunal.

The Tribunal concludes that material parts of the unfiled Fusion Memorandum were

used in the ‘ghostwriting’ of the Lago Agrio Judgment.

(6) The January and June Index Summaries: In brief, these materials in the form of
Excel spreadsheets, of 39 pages and 191 pages respectively, comprise tables identifying
documents filed in the court record of the Lago Agrio Litigation, prepared internally by

the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives in January 2007 and June 2007 respectively.**

There is no evidence that these Index Summaries were submitted by the Lago Agrio
Plaintiffs to the Lago Agrio Court in the Lago Agrio Litigation. Neither can be found in

the record of the Lago Agrio Court in any form.

In his expert testimony, Dr Leonard testified that he found multiple examples of

identical errors, identical or near-identical words strings and incorrect citations in these

Index Summaries that were repeated in the Lago Agrio Judgment.*? For example, the
court record refers to “75003” whereas both the June Index Summary and the Lago
Agrio Judgment (at pp. 142 and 150) refer mistakenly to “75013”.°° Annex 8(6) below
reproduces Example 7 from Dr Leonard’s second expert report, comparing identical or
near-identical word strings in the unfiled Index Summaries and the Lago Agrio

Judgment with the filed record.

These are also evident from Dr Leonard’s Exhibit 5 in his second expert report,
reproduced as Annex 9 to this Part V: for the Index Summaries, see pages 88-89, 96-97,
and 100-109 (original pp. 6, 7, 100, 101, 114, 127, 128, 129, 133, 137, 138, 142, 146 &
150).

In his testimony at the RICO trial in New York, Dr Zambrano admitted that he did not
know what an Excel spreadsheet was.°! The actual use, or non-use, of Excel on the
Zambrano Computers is considered in Part VI below. These evidential materials
confirm that Dr Zambrano did not himself use the January and June Index Summaries,

notwithstanding their use in the Lago Agrio Judgment.

The Tribunal concludes that material parts of the unfiled January and June Index

Summaries were used in the ‘ghostwriting’ of the Lago Agrio Judgment.

(7) The Moodie Memorandum: In brief, this document is a 13-page memorandum in
English, headed “The standard of proof in US common-law toxic tort negligence
claims.”>? It was sent by Mr Nicholas Moodie, an Australian legal intern working with
the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives, to Mr Prieto and Mr Saenz on 2 February
2009.** In this memorandum, Mr Moodie analyses Californian and Australian case law
regarding causation and burden of proof in medical tort cases and considers how the
tests identified in such case law might be applied to Chevron in the Lago Agrio

Litigation.

The Moodie Memorandum’s particular use of the “substantial factor” test for causation
in asbestos cases under Californian law is repeated in parts of the Lago Agrio Judgment

(pp. 89-90). Annex 8(7) below reproduces these passages.

As Professor Michael Green testified, this “substantial factor” test and other features
taken from Californian law make it at least highly unlikely that the passages in the Lago

Agrio Judgment were prepared independently of the Moodie Memorandum.**

As to the Moodie Memorandum’s use of Australian law, Mr James Spigelman AC QC
(formerly the Chief Justice of New South Wales) testified that the Memorandum’s
particular descriptions of Australian case law were inapposite as a matter of Australian
law; yet the same inapposite factors were used in the Lago Agrio Judgment, using

identical language (allowing for translation).>°

Professor Green also referred to the idiosyncratic use of two common law jurisdictions
for the purpose of applying principles of Ecuadorian law, a civil law system, in the Lago

Agrio Judgment.

The Tribunal concludes that material parts of the unfiled Moodie Memorandum were

used in the ‘ghostwriting’ of the Lago Agrio Judgment.

(8) The Selva Viva Database: In brief, the compilation of this electronic database** was
substantially completed by Hydrosphere Resource Consultants, a contractor working
with E-Tech and Stratus Consulting, both acting as environmental experts for the Lago
Agrio Plaintiffs. Hydrosphere was asked to digitise data in electronic from hard copy
documentation, principally inspection reports, soil samples and water samples, for use
by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ legal representatives. The database was created in about
April-June 2007 by Ms Laura Belanger, Mr John Rodgers and several others in Ecuador
and Boulder, Colorado. It was delivered to Dr Anne Maest (of Stratus Consulting) and
Mr Donziger.*” It was then completed and maintained for the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs by
Selva Viva, the company controlled by certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’

representatives. It comprises three Excel spreadsheets.

The Respondent accepts that the Silva Viva Database was used in the Lago Agrio
Judgment. There is no evidence showing that this material was ever submitted by the

Lago Agrio Plaintiffs to the Lago Agrio Court.

The Respondent’s speculation that the database was submitted to the Lago Agrio Court
informally during a judicial inspection is unsupported by any evidence. The Tribunal
has noted the evidence of Mr Rosero who sought to copy the CDs and DVDs in the
record of the Lago Agrio Court and found that 11 of these devices could not be
duplicated or read.>* These 11 devices were all submitted to the Lago Agrio Court on
behalf of Chevron and not the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives. Thus, contrary to
the Respondent’s submission, these files do not show that Dr Juola’s analysis of the

court record was incomplete and therefore unreliable.

The Claimants allege that there are numerous irregular commonalities between the Selva
Viva Database and the Lago Agrio Judgment that are not consistent with any data filed
with the Lago Agrio Court. The Claimants allege that these commonalities can only be
explained by the copying of the unfiled database into the Judgment, i.e. ‘ghostwriting’.

Their allegations depend upon the expert evidence summarised below.

Mr Spencer Lynch (of Stroz Friedberg) is an expert in digital forensics. He was called
by the Claimants. In his first expert report, Mr Lynch compared the environmental data
at pages 101 — 112 of the Lago Agrio Judgment with the “Filed Lab Results in the

official court record” and with the “Unfiled Selva Viva Database”.
Mr Lynch identified nine categories of naming and data irregularities:*°

“Ti] SV_and TX Suffixes — Many of the sampling results set forth in the Judgment
on pages 104 through 112 end with the suffix “_sv” or “_tx.” However, a review
of the Judicial Inspection Reports and Filed Lab Results provided to me did not
identify a single sample result referenced in this manner. In contrast, a review of
the data within the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation showed that a majority of
the sampling results referenced in the reviewed portion of the Judgment contained
these “_sv” or “_tx” suffixes. Figures I and 2 show examples of data in the Filed
Lab Results and the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation, respectively. Figure 3
shows a list of sampling results extracted from the Judgment where the names

58 R-1176; C-2424.
°° Lynch ER 1, paras 58-70.

Part V — Page 17

match the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation but do not match any of the Filed
Lab Results.

[ii] Parentheses Placement — Further review of the sampling results listed in the
Judgment show another naming convention used in the Unfiled Selva Viva Data
Compilation but not in the Filed Lab Results. Both the Judgment and the Unfiled
Selva Viva Data Compilation used a naming convention ending with numeric
ranges and an “m” or “cm” enclosed within parentheses. In contrast, the Filed
Lab Results in the court record used a naming convention that ended with numeric
ranges in parentheses, followed by an “m” or “cm” outside of the parentheses.
Figures 4 and 5 show data for the same inspection location from the Filed Lab
Results and the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation. Figure 6 shows a comparison
of the affected names across these data sources and the Judgment.

[iii] Underscore Separators — Stroz Friedberg found another naming irregularity
in the Judgment that shows its reliance on the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation.
When discussing benzene results on page 108, the Judgment referred to sample
result “SA_13_JI_AM1_0.1M.” This name contained underscores between various
parts of the title, and this naming format matches that used in the Unfiled Selva
Viva Data Compilation. In contrast, the Filed Lab Results contained no such
underscores. Instead, data for the SA13 sample clearly shows dashes used as
separators within the title of the sample result. Figures 7 and 8 show the data for
this sample in the Filed Lab Results and the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation,
respectively.

[iv] Incorrectly Identified Expert — Finally, page 108 of the Judgment stated,
“Chevron’s expert, John Connor, submitted results showing 9.9 and 2.3 mg/Kg (see
samples JL-LAC-PIT1-SD2-SU1.R (1.30-1.90) M y JI-LAC-PIT1-SD1-SU1-R (1.6-
2.4)M) during the judicial inspection in Lago Agrio Central...” (from translation).
The Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation also shows John Connor as the examiner
responsible for that test data. However, the Judicial Inspection Report filed with
the Court shows Professor Fernando Morales as Chevron’s expert for that
inspection, not John Connor.

[v] Non-Detects — Based on data that Stroz Friedberg has reviewed in this case, I
am aware that some environmental sampling procedures have a detection limit
based on the equipment, the methods used in the sampling procedure, and/or the
substance being tested. Samples under a detection limit often are referred to as a
“non-detect” and, when a non-detect is recorded, it often is shown as a less-than
sign (“<”) followed by a number that represents the minimum concentration of a
substance that can be detected by the applied test or sampling method. In this case,
the Filed Lab Results show that the concentrations of mercury for various
inspection sites were recorded as non-detects, and expressed as “<7.” The
Judgment, however, dropped the “<” and failed to acknowledge that the level of
mercury fell below detectible levels for several sites. Instead, the Court stated in its
decision that “alarming levels of mercury have been found” with “several samples
reaching 7mg/Kg” of mercury.”

Part V — Page 18

The evidence again revealed that the Court likely relied on and subsequently
misinterpreted the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation, rather than relying on the
Filed Lab Results submitted with the Judicial Inspection Reports. The Unfiled Selva
Viva Data Compilation placed the “<” in a separate column, as described in the
email thread dated March 4, 2008 and found in the SN 049997-SN 050000.pdf. The
Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation listed the “7” in its own column, and the
Court appeared to have misinterpreted this as the actual concentration of mercury
for various sites. In doing so, the Judgment eliminated any non-detect results and
made mercury levels appear higher and more certain than the actual filed results.
The Judgment appears to have made the same mistake with respect to
concentrations of benzene and toluene at other sites. Figures 9 and 10 show an
example of the Filed Lab Results versus the spreadsheets from the Unfiled Selva
Viva Data Compilation. Figure 11 shows a comparison of the non-detects located
in the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation and the Filed Lab Results relative to
how they appear in the Judgment.

[vi] Milligram (mg) vs. Microgram (ug) — While comparing data points, Stroz
Friedberg observed instances where concentrations of substances at specific sites
were listed in both the Judgment and the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation as
milligrams per kilogram (mg/Kg). However, the Filed Lab Results indicate that
concentrations for those same substances and sites should have been listed as
micrograms per kilogram (ug/Kg) — a thousand times less concentrated than the
levels reported in the Judgment. Again, the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation
appears to be the source of the erroneous information cited. Figures 12 and 13
show examples of the Filed Lab Results and corresponding data from the Unfiled
Selva Viva Data Compilation. Figure 14 shows a comparison of the concentrations
referenced in the Judgment and data for those sites reflected in the Filed Lab
Results and the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation, respectively.

[vii] Chevron TPH Results — On page 102 of the Judgment, the author referred to
1,984 TPH test results “... brought by the defendants’ experts...” Based on Stroz
Friedberg’s review of The Connor Report and Anexo B to the Cabrera Report, this
number appears to be too high. Those reports indicate that between 932 and 964
soil samples were taken by Chevron. An examination of the Unfiled Selva Viva Data
Compilation confirmed that 1,984 was inaccurate and based on the Unfiled Selva
Viva Data Compilation and not documents filed with the Court. In short, the Unfiled
Selva Viva Data Compilation broke the TPH results down into two parts, and the
Judgment appears to have made the mistake of double-counting these test results.
Stroz Friedberg found this error when it sorted the Unfiled Selva Viva Data
Compilation by the following columns and unique entries: “Fuente de datos”
(Texaco); “Matriz” (Suelo); and “Parametro” (“Begins with” TPH). This sorting
had the effect of limiting results to soil samples attributed to Chevron and analyzed
for TPH. When Stroz Friedberg did this sorting, it found that the count of all
Chevron’s TPH test results in the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation equaled the
number cited in the Judgment — 1,984. However, the TPH results in the Unfiled
Selva Viva Data Compilation contained two parts — one row for Diesel Range

Part V — Page 19

Organics (DRO) readings and one row for Gasoline Range Organics (GRO)
readings (See Figure 15).

The Judgment stated that DRO and GRO readings “have to be added up to in order
to have a relatively comparable equivalence with TPHs.” However, to reach 1,984
TPH results for Chevron, it is necessary to count the DRO and GRO readings for
the same sample as separate TPH results. The resulting 1,984 number was
inconsistent with the court record because, when Stroz Friedberg counted just the
TPH results from the Filed Lab Results in the record, it arrived at a number (935)
that was approximately half that of the number cited in the Judgment and generally
consistent with the counts given in The Connor Report (932) and Anexo B to the
Cabrera Report (964). Based on this analysis, Stroz Friedberg concludes that the
most likely reason the Judgment effectively double counted most of Chevron’s TPH
results was its author’s reliance on the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation, where
the DRO and GRO readings for Chevron appeared in separate rows.

[viii] Lago Agrio Plaintiff TPH Results — In addition to the erroneous reporting of
1,984 Chevron TPH results described above, the Judgment inaccurately counted
the Lago Agrio plaintiffs’ TPH results, again based on its apparent reliance on the
Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation. When discussing TPH levels, the Judgment
stated, in part, “[t]he plaintiffs’ expert have submitted 420 results” for TPH soil
sample. Stroz Friedberg again found that this number was overstated. As a
preliminary matter, The Connor Report and Anexo B to the Cabrera Report indicate
that between 308 and 339 soil samples were taken by the plaintiffs. To perform the
analysis, Stroz Friedberg reviewed entries associated with the plaintiffs’ data in the
Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation. Stroz Friedberg sorted the data first on the
column and unique item labeled “Fuente de datos” (Demandantes), then on
“Matriz” (Suelo), and finally on “Parametro” (“Begins with” TPH). This sorting
had the effect of limiting results to soil samples attributed to the Lago Agrio
plaintiffs and analyzed for TPH. This yielded 420 results, thereby showing a match
between the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation and the Judgment. Once again,
there were many instances where DRO and GRO tests were counted as individual
results, rather than being combined to represent one TPH value. Further distorting
plaintiffs’ numbers in the Judgment, some test sites in the Unfiled Selva Viva Data
Compilation listed both the DRO and GRO individual tests, as well as a separate
TPH value that combined these two tests. Figure 16 shows an example of this data
extracted from the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation. Based on this analysis,
Stroz Friedberg concludes that reliance on the Unfiled Selva Viva Data
Compilation resulted in a substantial over counting of the plaintiffs’ test results
within the Judgment.

 

[ix] Computed Percentages — The erroneous TPH counts in the Judgment had the
additional effect of distorting the sample percentages listed in the decision. Stroz
Friedberg was able to use the “DAQO000040.xIs” spreadsheet containing the
Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation to reproduce the percentages listed in the
Judgment. Stroz Friedberg did so by sorting the Unfiled Selva Viva Data
Compilation spreadsheet to represent the three groups of “Texaco,”
“Demandantes,” and “Corte,” removing any reference to “Cabrera” from the
Perito column, and then grouping by the three categories discussed in the Judgment

Part V — Page 20

(<1000, 1000-5000, >5000). Stroz Friedberg then divided the sums in each of these
columns by the inaccurate TPH counts listed in the Judgment. The percentages
listed in the Judgment, along with the percentages computed using the Unfiled Selva
Viva Data Compilation, are shown in Figure 17. The percentages are almost
identical, and any slight differences between the Judgment and the Unfiled Selva
Viva Data Compilation appear to be due to variations in decimal rounding.”

For the reasons set out in his expert report, Mr Lynch concluded:

“Analysis of the 2011 Judgment indicates that it was derived from material not filed
with the Court in the Lago Agrio litigation in Ecuador. Over 100 specific and
repeated naming and data irregularities indicate that the data points cited in the
2011 Judgment were copied, cut-and-pasted, or otherwise taken directly from the
Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation. Other forensic evidence shows that it is
highly unlikely that the TPH counts, statistical percentages, or pit counts discussed
in this report and cited in the 2011 Judgment were independently derived from the
Filed Lab Results.”

Mr Lynch’s report replaced the earlier reports of Mr Michael L. Younger (also of Stroz
Friedberg), who had also earlier testified as an expert in digital forensics called by the
Claimants and concluded that the Selva Viva database contains errors and
commonalities that are to be found in the Lago Agrio Judgment.°! (Mr Younger
withdrew on grounds of ill-health; and his expert testimony was adopted by Mr Lynch,

his replacement).

The Tribunal concludes that material parts of the Selva Viva Database were used in the

‘ghostwriting’ of the Lago Agrio Judgment.

In summary, the Tribunal finds that Lago Agrio Judgment made improper use of these
eight unfiled materials in the possession of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives.
Based on the evidence adduced before this Tribunal, the Tribunal finds that such use
resulted from the corrupt conduct of Judge Zambrano in permitting certain of the Lago
Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives to ‘ghostwrite’ material parts of the Lago Agrio

Judgment.
E: The Lago Agrio Judgment - Forensic Linguistics

Professor Gerald R. McMenamin, called by the Claimants, is a specialist expert in

forensic linguistics, including Spanish linguistics. He compared the language of the

Lynch ER 1, para 119.
6! Younger ER 1, p. 19.

Lago Agrio Judgment with 36 other known writings by Judge Zambrano from 2009 to
2011.

In his expert report, Professor McMenamin analysed an aggregate set of seven patterned
and re-occurring “markers of writing style”; namely: (a) divisions of text into headings
and subheadings; (b) dollar amounts; (c) form of writing the year: “2.010” v “2010”; (d)
sentence — initial spacing of open quotes; (e) sentence — final punctuation of close quotes
(f) form of textual ellipsis: “[. . .]” or “. . .”; (g) capitalization of month in dates:

“octubre” or “Octubre”.

His report’s statistical analyses are not easily summarised or capable of reproduction
here. The Tribunal therefore takes only one illustrative example, namely (c) the form of
writing the year, in “marked” form (i.e. writing the four-digit year by placing a point to
separate the thousands place from the remaining number-places to its right, e.g. 2.011”)
and the “unmarked” form (i.e. without any punctuation, e.g. “2011”). The report

concludes as to the different uses of these marked and unmarked forms:

“Judge Zambrano’s [known writings] demonstrate this unmarked form in just 21%
of its 759 occurrence-opportunities, and Zambrano’s KNOWN writings also
demonstrate a very much higher incidence of the marked form: e.g., 2.011. In 79%
of the 759 occurrence -opportunities, the year is written with a point between the
thousands and hundreds places, i.e., like the 2.011 in 03 de febrero del 2.011(See
Exhibits C-3).

It is telling that the marked form of the year (e.g., 2.010) appears in the [Lago Agrio
Judgment] less that 1% of the time (once in 224 occurrence opportunities), but that
same marked form occurs in the KNOWN-Zambrano writings 80% of the time (600
times in 750 occurrence -opportunities). This indicates the probability that authors
other than Judge Zambrano wrote those sections of the [Judgment] that contain
references to years as expressed in dates.”

Professor McMenamin, having analysed the linguistic evidence on all seven markers,
concluded that it is “highly probable” that the Lago Agrio Judgment has “multiple

authors” and that Judge Zambrano “did not author a significant amount” of the

Judgment.

Professor McMenamin was not subjected to cross-examination by the Respondent at the
Track II Hearing. Whilst the Tribunal accords weight to his expert testimony, it does

not regard his opinions as conclusive on the issue of ‘ghostwriting’.
F: The Lago Agrio Judgment - The Cabrera Report: Dr Barnthouse

The Lago Agrio Judgment expressly disclaims any reliance on the Cabrera Report.
Ostensibly, it accepted Chevron’s petition that the Cabrera Report was not be taken into

account for the Lago Agrio Judgment.” It appears, at first sight, not to have done so.

However, it did take the Cabrera Report into account indirectly. As already indicated
above in Part IV (see paras 4.402), the Lago Agrio Judgment made use of Dr
Barnthouse’s expert testimony resting on the “Cabrera Report” (e.g. see page 57ff of the

Judgment) and the pit calculations in Annex H1 to the “Cabrera Report”.

Moreover, as considered immediately below, the Lago Agrio Judgment relied on the

Cabrera Report for the number of oil pits requiring remediation.
G: The Lago Agrio Judgment - The Cabrera Report: The Oil Pits

The Lago Agrio Judgment orders the payment by Chevron of US$ 5.396 billion for soil
remediation in areas of the former Concession. It calculates the figure of US$ 5.396
billion by multiplying the number of oil pits requiring remediation, the volume of soil

per pit requiring remediation and the unit cost of remediation.

As to the number of oil pits requiring remediation, the Lago Agrio Judgment finds 880
pits attributable to Chevron (i.e. from TexPet’s operations in the concession area),
leading to the calculation of US$ 5.396 billion. The specific number of “880” pits is

therefore an essential part in the calculation of the figure of US$ 5.396 billion.
In regard to these 880 pits, the Lago Agrio Judgment states:°

“Thus, to conclude with the analysis of the presence of hazardous elements
resulting from the operations of Texpet in the Consortium, and considering that the
results of most of the expert reports are similar: ... 2. The contamination in the area
of the concession extends to 7,392,000 cubic meters (m3), a figure that is arrived

C931, p. 51.

Part V — Page 23

at considering that we have 880 pits (proven through aerial photographs certified
by the Geographic Military Institute which appear throughout the record, analyzed
together with the official documents of Petroecuador submitted by the parties and
especially by the expert Gerardo Barros, and aggravated by the fact that the
defendant has not submitted the historical archives that record the number of pits,
the criteria for their construction, use or abandonment) of an area of 60 x 40
meters, and because of the possibility of leaks and spills, it should be remediated in
an area of at least 5 meters around the pits, and the pits have a depth of 2.40 meters
(which is a reasonable estimate, considering that the pits have different dimensions,
and as we noted above, the defendant has not presented an archive or historical
record that details the number or the dimensions specified for the construction of
the pits.”

5.97. The Clarification Order states, as to the identification of relevant pits:

. it is emphasized that, as explained in the judgment, the Court analyzed the
various aerial photographs that form a part of the record and that were certified
by the military Geographic Institute. The Court found this method appropriate since
all of the photographs are from before 1990, and cannot reflect the existence of pits
constructed after Petroecuador assumed the operations. Thus, they only reflect
those constructed by Texpet ...”.

5.98. LBG: The Tribunal has considered the Respondent’s evidence, especially the several
expert reports of Kenneth J. Goldstein, Jeffrey W. Short and Edward A. Garvey (of the
Louis Berger Group). The Tribunal does not consider that their testimony answers the
criticism made by the Claimants’ expert witnesses in regard to the specific number of

880 pits used in the Lago Agrio Judgment.
5.99. In their first report (of 2013), Messrs Goldstein and Short testified:

“The RAP [i.e. the 1995 Remedial Action Plan] purported to identify the number
of pits and affected soil areas resulting from spills that were present at each well
site and production station identified in the SOW [i.e. the Scope of Work] and
assessed applicable remediation requirements Conservatively assuming 3 pits per
well site and 5 pits per production station, it is reasonable to estimate there were
about a thousand pits scattered across the Concession Area.”*”

5.100. However, this historical estimate was made for all pits in the former concession area. It
therefore included pits that were not contaminated and contaminated pits that had been

remediated under the 1995 Settlement Agreement. It cannot provide evidence

supporting the specific number of 880 pits requiring remediation, as found the Lago

Agrio Judgment.

In their supplemental report (of 2015), Messrs Goldstein and Garvey also testified that
the “880 pit count in the Judgment is reasonable as confirmed by our review of the
record and TexPet documents produced by Claimants”.®* The detailed analysis that
follows is directed only at the reasonableness of the number of 880 pits. It does not in
fact confirm that specific number; nor does it identify the contemporary evidential
materials that could support that specific number. The issue of reasonableness is not
here the critical question, which is directed at the evidence supporting the specific

number of 880 pits used in the Lago Agrio Judgment.

The Lago Agrio Judgment cites, in the passage above, three sources to prove its number
of 880 pits. This Tribunal has been shown no cogent evidence that the specific number

of 880 pits was derived from any of these three sources.

The first, the “aerial photographs certified by the Geographic Military Institute” did not
list 880 pits. (The possible use of these photographs as a scientific method of identifying
and calculating 880 pits is considered separately below). The “official documents of
PetroEcuador” did not list 880 pits. Nor did Dr Barros list 880 pits (as the expert
appointed by the Lago Agrio Court).

The Tribunal turns to the explanations provided by Dr Robert E. Hinchee, Dr James
Ebert (of Ebert & Associates), Mr Spencer Lynch (of Stroz Friedberg), Mr Michael
Younger (also of Stroz Frieberg) and Mr William Di Paolo & Ms Laura Hall (both of
Di Paolo Consulting), as the Claimants’ expert witnesses. These experts addressed (inter
alia) the aerial photographs certified by the Geographic Military Institute and “Anexo
H1” to the Cabrera Report. These photographs were in the filed record before the Lago
Agrio Court. The Lago Agrio Judgment records that no use is there made of the Cabrera

Reports.

The question arises, as the Respondent at least implicitly contends and the Claimants

dispute,” whether it was scientifically possible for Judge Zambrano to identify and

calculate the number of 880 pits by studying these photographs and, if not, the further

question as to where that number of 880 pits originated.

Dr Hinchee: In his first expert report, relying in part upon the expert reports of Dr Ebert
and Mr Di Paolo & Ms Hall, Dr Hinchee concluded that none of the materials cited as
proof in the Lago Agrio Judgment supported the number of 880 pits, including the aerial

photographs.”!

In his third expert report, as to the pit count, Dr Hinchee also testified (with footnoted

references here omitted):

“In 2007, Petroecuador estimated only 370 pits required remediation in the former
Concession. As a result of its ongoing remediation, in 2009, Petroecuador
estimated only 86 pits in the former Concession required remediation. These
estimates demonstrate the unreasonableness of the Judgment’s 880 pit count.” 7?

Again, the Tribunal sets aside any issue of reasonableness in regard to the number of

880 pits. As already indicated, that is not here the critical question.

Dr Ebert: In his report (as an expert photogramaticist), Dr Ebert stated that the aerial
photographs were monoscopic (i.e. not stereoscopic), low resolution and black-and-
white panchromatic images; and, also, that there were no aerial photographs for

approximately 114 out of 343 sites in the record (i.e. only 33.2%).
Dr Ebert concluded:

“Based on my analysis of the aerial photographs in the record, and other data
provided to me, I have concluded, to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty that
it is highly unlikely, if not impossible, that Judge Zambrano could have arrived in
a valid manner at the 880 pit figure from the aerial photographs in the record.
Indeed, given that Judge Zambrano has no identified experience or training in
interpreting aerial photographs, and thus the aerial photographs in the record
likely were largely incomprehensible to him, it is impossible that he could have
reached any appropriate conclusion from a review of the aerial photographs in the
record. Rather, it is far more likely that the Sentencia [i.e. the Lago Agrio
Judgment] includes an 880 pit count by relying on the data in the Cabrera and/or
the Stratus tables.”7?

Mr Lynch: Mr Lynch testified that the number of 880 pits in the Lago Agrio Judgment
was calculated from the total number of 916 pits listed in “Anexo H1” to the Cabrera
Report.” This “Anexo H1” is entitled “History and Inventory of Waste Pits Opened by
the Company’s Operation Texpet in the Ecuadorian Amazon”.”° It is derived, subject to
one material discrepancy addressed below, from the “Stratus Compilation” prepared as

an Excel document for the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives.”

Mr Lynch removed from the total number of 916 the number of pits attributed in “Anexo
H1” to PetroEcuador and those pits listed as having no environmental impact, leaving
the pit number of 880 attributed to Chevron, i.e. the same number of pits used in the

Lago Agrio Judgment.

The Tribunal does not accept the Respondent’s criticisms that Mr Lynch performed this
calculation in an arbitrary manner, given that “Anexo H1” lists 916 pits and that the
Stratus Compilation (in Excel format) lists 917 pits.’” The discrepancy relates to one pit
mistakenly included in the latter document as a pit within the concession area, as Mr

Lynch explained in his first expert report. 7*
Mr Lynch testified:”

“Relying on ... Dr Ebert’s opinion that it was not as the [Lago Agrio] judgment
describes based on the aerial photographs, the only source that I have seen is an
original version of Anexo H1, an Excel version, and then Anexo H1 itself. And my
opinion is that it is more likely than not, given the analysis that I performed and the
data that I had available to me, that it was derived from Anexo H1 or the original
Excel version.”

In his expert report (confirming the findings of the earlier expert report of Mr Younger),

for the reasons there set out, Mr Lynch concluded (with footnotes here omitted):*°

“Pit Counts — On page 125 of the Judgment, the author referred to 880 pits. An
examination revealed that this number likely was based on the Stratus Compilation
or Anexo H-1. Stroz Friedberg observed that the Stratus Compilation contained
almost the exact same data in the exact same format as the information in the Anexo
H-1 document filed earlier with the Cabrera Report. Although the Anexo H-1

document listed 916 pits and the Stratus Compilation had records or rows for 917
pits, Stroz Friedberg observed that the Judgment did not include “no impact”
figures or similar entries or those related to “Petroecuador” and “Petroduccion.”
Therefore, Stroz Friedberg sorted the “COMENTARIO DEL RAP” column and
removed all references to these entries as shown in Figure 18. The result was 880
records — the same number that appeared in the Judgment. Therefore, the count of
880 probably was arrived at by simply sorting on the RAP Comment column within
the Stratus Compilation, which itself contains almost the exact same data in the
exact same format as Anexo H-1.”

5.116. Mr Di Paolo and Ms Hall: In their expert report, Mr William D. Paolo and Ms Laura
Hall stated that Mr Cabrera’s photographic interpretation was incomplete and

contradictory:*!

“In a document submitted to the Nueva Loja Superior Court in April 2008 by Mr.
Richard Cabrera titled “Informe Sumario del Examen Pericial” (translation:
Summary Report of Expert Investigation), the number and area of pits at each site
are presented in a summary table, Annex H-1, “Inventario de Piscinas” (Pit
Inventory). This summary is apparently based solely on aerial photographic
interpretations from 1976, 1986, and 1990, but Mr. Cabrera does not provide aerial
photographs for 74% of the sites (249 of 335) and he does not perform field
verification of 85% (286 of 335) of the sites. Also, he presents contradictory
photographic interpretations of the pits in various annexes, as described below.

[As to the “Number of Pits”:] Mr. Cabrera alleges the existence of 916 pits at 335
sites using as substantiation his photograph interpretation presented in the table in
Annex H-1, even though in the same table he admits that he never observed 156 of
the 916 pits that he claims exist, stating in his table that there is “no evidence” of
a pit, it is “non-existent,” it is “closed,” or there are “no data” for all 3 years for
which he had photos. Therefore, he never observed an open pit for 17% of the pits
that he claims exist in his table from Annex H-1. In addition to having incomplete
photo interpretations, the interpretations he presents in Annex U4 and Annex E are
contradictory. Mr. Cabrera provides photo interpretations for 85 sites in Annex E,
“Graficos y Andlisis de Resultados de Diferentes Estudios” (Graphics and Analysis
of Results of Different Studies) and for a subset (39) of these sites plus one
additional site in Annex U4, “Resultados Sitio por Sitio” (Site by Site Results). As
shown in Table I, below, the contradictions between the number of pits in Mr.
Cabrera’s Annex E and his Annex U4, for the 39 sites in common between them,
are quite significant.”

(Table | sets out a “Comparison of photo interpretation results from Annex E and Annex

H-1 with Annex U4 for the 39 sites that were included in Annex U4”).

8! Hinchee ER 1, Exhibit 21 (Opinion of Di Paolo & Hall), p. 7.

Part V — Page 28

 

5.117. Their expert report then continues:

“As shown in Table 1, Mr Cabrera identified 118 pits on the photos in Annex E, but
only identified 62 pits in Annex U4 at the 39 sites, using the same photos.
Nevertheless, Mr Cabrera based his remediation costs on the number and size of
pits shown in Annex H-1 even though his own data shown in Annex U4 indicates
that there are almost 50% fewer pits that should be used for the cost estimate.”

5.118. These experts summarise their conclusions as follows, which merit here citing in full

(with square brackets here added for ease of reference):**

“[1] Aerial photography can be an excellent tool for making preliminary
assessments of oilfield operations, when used by experienced interpreters for a
preliminary site assessment and to observe changes over time. However, aerial
photography alone is insufficient to accurately assess oil field site details, such as
the existence and number of pits or oil spills. It is impossible to discern an oil spill
or the presence of oil in a pit using the black and white aerial photographs available
from the concession area.

[2] Mr Cabrera’s photo interpretation is incomplete since he provides no photos in
Annex E or Annex U4 for 249 of the 335 sites (74%) that he claims to have
evaluated. Mr Cabrera provides no explanation as to why he does not include the
aerial photos for the other 249 sites, and it is impossible to determine how many
potential errors Mr Cabrera may have made in photo interpretations for those
additional sites.

[3] Mr Cabrera’s report contains contradictory photo interpretation results
between Annex H-1, Annex E, and Annex U4. In estimating remediation costs, Mr
Cabrera focuses on the results presented in Annex H-1 without describing the
reasons for the discrepancies between each of the annexes in terms of the number
and size of pits. In Annex U4, Mr Cabrera identifies 62 pits at the 39 sites he visited
and for which he had aerial photographs in both Annexes E and U4. However, in
Annexes E and H-1 he claims there are 118 pits at these same 39 sites and he uses
this number to estimate his remediation cost.

[4] Not only were the aerial photo interpretations presented by Mr Cabrera
incomplete and contradictory, the interpretations he did present were grossly
inaccurate with many site features being misidentified, incorrectly outlined, or non-
existent. The mistakes made in identifying features at the sites were due to the effects
of shadowing; the distribution and size of vegetation; soil moisture differences, use
of variable quality, relatively low resolution, black and white (panchromatic)
photography; and misrepresentation of the dates of the aerial photography used.
The types and number of errors found would indicate the lack of experienced photo
interpretation professionals using professional, high-quality stereoscopes, and at

® Hinchee ER 1, Exhibit 21 (Opinion of Di Paolo & Hall), p. 7.
83 Hinchee ER 1, Exhibit 21 (Opinion of Di Paolo & Hall), pp. 3-4

Part V — Page 29

best careless and sloppy protocol, or at worst incompetence and/or falsification of
the data.

[5] Mr Cabrera’s photographic interpretations might have been improved if (1) the
image interpretation results were incorporated and analyzed in a geographic
information system (GIS), and (2) multiple, high-resolution aerial photos had been
reviewed in stereo by qualified professionals when attempting to discern pits from
other site features.

[6] Furthermore, Mr Cabrera cannot claim that features he sees on IGM (Instituto
Geogrdafico Militar (translated as: Military Geographical Institute)) aerial
photographs are pits or oil spills unless he has completed field observations at the
site, and then used those field observations to correct his photographic
interpretation. Ground-truthing is critical to verify any air photo interpretations.
Remote sensing and photo interpretation standard practices require such site visits
and ground observations to validate interpretations from aerial photos or any
remotely sensed data.

[7] Mr Cabrera failed to correct the errors found in his aerial photographic
interpretation of pits based on his own field observations, or the field verification
done as part of the Judicial Inspections. Since Mr Cabrera ignored even his own
field observations, his alleged pit count is inaccurate, inflated, and without merit
for calculating remediation cost estimates. Failure to correct interpretation errors
at many sites, even after ground-truthing, would indicate either a gross oversight
or the possible intent to falsify the number and size of pits present at these sites.

[8] In addition to the mistakes outlined above, Mr Cabrera presented aerial
photographic interpretations of well sites drilled by Petroecuador after June 1990,
and he included Petroecuador pits in his report and incorrectly attributed them to
Texpet. He also interpreted and included in his report pits that were constructed
after June 1990 at several production stations. Furthermore, he assessed the status
of pits for wells in the Cononaco oil field, saying they were interpreted from 1990
IGM aerial photographs even though IGM never took aerial photographs of this
area in their 1989-1992 “Carta Nacional” (translation: National Mapping) aerial
survey project for the Oriente region of Ecuador.”

5.119. Based on these materials, the Tribunal concludes that the Lago Agrio Judgment based
its specific number of 880 oil pits on the Cabrera Report and not, as the Lago Judgment
falsely states, on the aerial photographs, PetroEcuador’s official documents or Dr
Barros. The Tribunal also concludes that the Cabrera Report provided no scientific basis
for the specific number of 880 pits used in the Lago Agrio Judgment; and that, contrary
to the Respondent’s submission, the Lago Agrio Judgment’s reliance on the Cabrera

Report was in no way “in some small fashion”.**

The resulting amount of US$ 5.396 billion awarded as damages for soil remediation in
areas of the former Concession was the largest single item of non-punitive damages in
the Lago Agrio Judgment. Thus, the use in the Lago Agrio Judgment of the Cabrera
Report (with its own methodology) was highly significant and material to its award of
damages. It will be recalled that the Cabrera Report was drafted not by Mr Cabrera, but
by certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives and experts in corrupt collusion

with Mr Cabrera (see Part IV above).
H: The Lago Agrio Judgment - Diffuse Liability

The Lago Agrio Judgment addressed and decided the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ claims
unequivocally as “diffuse” claims only and not as individual claims made by a plaintiff

seeking compensation for personal harm to that individual plaintiff.

Thus, the Lago Agrio Judgment recognises that what is being decided is not “the
existence of harm to the health of specific persons”; or “the existence of harm or injuries
to or a specific health problem of a given individual”;** noting also “that the reparation
of particular cases of cancer has not been demanded, nor are such cases identified, thus
they are not remediable ...”.*° It also notes that no Lago Agrio Plaintiff had claimed
“monetary compensation” for individual “losses of animals and domestic farming,”*’
(The Tribunal decided in its Decision on Track 1B (by a majority) that the original
complaint pleaded by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs could be read as pleading individual
claims also, consistent with the individual claims pleaded in the Aguinda Litigation in
New York — albeit there reserving the Tribunal’s decision as to how these claims were

decided in the Lago Agrio Litigation).**

The Tribunal refers to other passages to like effect from the Lago Agrio Judgment and
its subsequent Clarification Order of 4 March 2011, including the following:
* “(T]he complaint has been signed by 42 citizens, the plaintiffs, who have not

requested personal compensation for any harm, but rather have demanded the
protection of a collective right in accordance with the formalities provided by the

EMA, the redress of environmental harm, which as has been alleged in this lawsuit,
affect more than 30,000 people, these supposedly being undetermined.”*°

**[T]he parties potentially affected by the activities of the Consortium are divided
into several different human groups, that claim to be united by the fact of being
affected by an environmental harm, without all belonging to a single nationality or
neighbourhood, but rather who are identifiable for sharing impacts coming from
the environmental harm ... connected by one same impact and a common interest
in resolving it. In this way, the legal grounds on which the collective right of the
plaintiffs to file this claim rests have been established to the satisfaction of the
Court, summarized in the fundamental, inalienable, substantive right of action and
petition, in the second place in the norms of the Civil Code to give grounds for the
right to ask for redress of the harm, and in the third place in the active legal
standing of the plaintiffs to be heard in this proceeding in defence of collective
rights.”

* “This criterion also agrees with the Resolution of the Constitutional Court 1457,
of 18 August 2009, which tells us that, ‘In accordance with the regulation for
applying the mechani isms of social participation established in the Law of
Envi collective envii I rights are those rights
shared by the community to enjoy a healthy environment that is free of
contamination, and involving aesthetic, scenic, recreational and cultural values,
physical and mental integrity, and in general, quality of life. And an environmental
impact is considered to be every positive or negative change to the environment
that is caused directly or indirectly by a project or activity in a determined area.
That is, environmental impact is every action of man that produces changes to the
physical and human surroundings.’”

* “Finally, with regard to the harm to people’s health, it should be noted that none
of these harms or impacts to human health have been proven in a specious manner;
that is, proof has not been presented of the existence of harm to the health of specific
persons; rather, it has been proved, epidemiologically, that there exists harm to
public health. Regarding the lack of proof of the harm or injuries to the health of
specific persons, this Presidency notes that the plaintiff point of view is correct in
the sense that no medical certificates have been submitted to show the existence of
harm or injuries to or a specific health problem of a given individual; therefore, in
order to make this decision, we consider, in the first place, that the reparation of
particular harm has not been requested, rather the plaintiff requests, in regards to
health: ‘contract on charge of the defendant, specialized persons or institutions in
order to design and carry out a plan for the health improvement and monitoring of
the inhabitants affected by contamination.’ (page 80); thus the submitted evidence
does not necessarily refer to the particular harm, but to the harm to public health,
which means that the fact that no particular injuries or harm have been proved is
irrelevant; and in the second place, that the abovementioned claim is coherent with
the object of the complaint, which is the reparation of the environmental harm that,
as been shown, are those caused to the environment or some of its components;

8 C931, p. 33.

°1€-931, p. 95.

Part V — Page 32

thus, we will only analyse the existence of harm to public health and if this harm is
directly related to the reported environmental impacts for which reparation is
required.”.””

* “[S]ince as we have seen in this case there is not a demand for reparation of
harm to the health of specific individuals, but rather a claim for the ‘contract, on
charge of the defendant, of specialized persons or institutions in order to design
and carry out a plan for the health improvement and monitoring of the inhabitants
affected by contamination’, meaning that what should be analysed is the presence
of a public health problem and the causation of this harm applying the mentioned
theories.” *

**This possibility of suffering a harm, which in this case is a risk to undetermined
individuals, should not leave defenseless those threatened by the contingent harm
because the legislator has wisely provided for (Article 2236 of the Civil Code) the
popular action suit that has been brought, by means of which have been requested,
amongst other things, the removal and the adequate treatment and disposal of the
contaminating wastes and materials still present, the cleaning of rivers, streams
and lakes, and in general, the cleaning of the soil, plantations and crops and so on,
where there are contaminating wastes produced or generated as a consequence of
the operations directed by Texaco, which are precisely those contaminants
mentioned in the previous lines, included in the reports of the different experts who
have submitted their reports, and that threaten with the possibility, admitted by the
defendants, to damage undetermined individuals, such as the ones represented by
the plaintiffs.” *4

* The compensation awarded in the Lago Agrio Judgment reflects the diffuse nature
of the rights decided by the Lago Agrio Court: over US$ 6 billion for remediation
of state-owned lands; over US$ 2 billion for a public health system (confirming
“that the individualized reparation of the health of the affected persons, who are
undetermined, cannot be ordered, but measures can be ordered that equally tackle
the problem in a general way”); US$ 150 million for a potable water system to
“benefit the persons who inhabit the area”; and US$ 100 million for “a community
reconstruction and ethnic reaffirmation program.”

* “W]e must note that the reparation of particular cases of cancer has not been
demanded, nor are such cases identified, thus they are not remediable, but rather
to the contrary, it is considered that this evidence together with the statistics reflects
an aggravating factor to the public health problem referred to above. Considering
that the lack of individualization of the victims does not free from the responsibility
of repairing such harm, what is appropriate to analyze is who would be the
beneficiary of said remediation, therefore, paying attention to the fact that it has
that it has been proven that a serious public health problem exists.” °°

* “The beneficiary of the trust shall be the Amazon Defense Front or the person or
persons that it designates, considering that ‘those affected’ by the environmental
harm, are undetermined, but determinable, persons united by a collective right.” 97

* “The additional 10% of the amount ordered as reparation of harm in name of the
Amazon Defense Front” can only be granted to those who bring actions on behalf
of the community. In other words, nobody is rewarded for filing actions seeking
reparation of their personal injuries.” °°

5.124. None of these amounts can be understood as an award of compensation for personal

harm suffered by an individual Lago Agrio Plaintiff.

5.125. The Clarification Order of 4 March 2011 provides that: “it was clearly established in the
Judgment that we are facing a situation of damage to public health, and not to

individualised claims for injuries or diseases”.® It also provides, in material part:

* “The Court points out that the complaint was signed by a group of individuals,
the plaintiffs, but they are not suing on their own behalf. Rather, they are suing on
behalf of thousands who say they have been affected by the existence of
environmental damage. And they filed the complaint to benefit all of these
people.”!

* “In addition, it is clarified that it does not correspond to the President of this
Court to ‘clarify’ the judgment with a list of affected persons, since it was clearly
established in the judgment that we are facing a situation of damage to public
health, and not to individualised claims for injuries or diseases. Thus, the manner
in which the persons affected should be redressed in their health shall be through
a health program established as a redress measure in the thirteenth conclusion of
law of the judgment”!

* “Concerning the twenty-first request, it is clarified that when mention is made of
damage to persons, it is explained in the judgment that what is involved is damage
to their culture and damage to their health, but that are a direct consequence of the
environmental damage. This should not be confused with personal damage in the
sense of damage to individuals. Rather, it should be understood as damage to
persons or human beings in general, and should only include such damage as is a
direct consequence of the contamination, as is explained in the judgment.” !

5.126. As already indicated, the Lago Agrio Judgment appears to award US$ 864 million or

potentially US$ 1.82 billion, to the Amazon Defense Front (the “ADF’”) as the judgment
debt’s beneficiary to fund generalised remediation projects in the former consortium
area, unrelated to any personal harm to any of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs as individuals.

None of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ claims were assigned to the ADF.

This interpretation of the Lago Agrio Judgment is supported by the terms of the
subsequent Appellate Judgment and the Order clarifying the Appellate Judgment of 3
and 13 January 2012 respectively. As to the Judgment, the Appellate Court there
decided:

* “The economic losses suffered by the plaintiffs would constitute a loss and as
such they were not alleged in the complaint and neither is there any claim
whatsoever for their compensation, for which reason the record contains no
grounds that would justify ordering the defendant to indemnify them, even if the
existence of those losses were proven in the eyes of the judge.”!

* “The national case law does not clearly show any reference to the action for
contingent damage, for which reason its non-existent or extremely limited practical
application in Ecuador can be affirmed; so there is no opposition to applying the
mentioned rule to claims of an environmental character, since the ideas of the legal
premise are not in any way inconsistent with that of what happens in the natural
kingdom. Art. 2214 of the Civil Code imposes the obligation to redress on who
caused the damage to another, and in this case the judgment is sound for
establishing damage, with legal responsibility of the defendant and the nexus
between the antecedent - oil production activity -, and consequently - environmental
damage; not personal damage;. there lies the foundation of the obligation to
provide redress; an unintentional tort - infringing Ecuadorian law that causes harm
to another -, affecting not only the flora and fauna, but also other interest as a
protected legal good - the health of the people in connection with the environment,
and its clear result of harm.” !°4

*“[T]t is clarified that the content of the publication must have the same basic
elements of a message, and include the following criteria: a) The message of public

2.- The damages to the lives and health of the recipients; 3.- The impact suffered by
their cultures; e) The offeror must declare that it also recognizes the existence of
other irreparable damages and laments them; f) The offeror must recognize that
the damages were caused by the implementation of inadequate technology and
practices and that the use of available technology that could have prevented; or, at
least decreased, the damages was omitted; g) The offeror may clarify that it is
making the publication by judicial order and that it does not imply recognition of
any obligation nor ulterior, civil nor criminal responsibility.”!

This analysis as to diffuse and not individual liability is supported by the terms of the

later Cassation Court’s Judgment of 12 November 2013. It noted:

“The Environmental Management Act has foreseen these so-called popular-action
lawsuits with regard to the environment and having to do with diffuse rights, under
which rule this complaint has been filed. That is to say, as they are collective rights
that are established under a popular action lawsuit ... .”!%

This analysis is also supported by the terms of the Constitutional Court’s Judgment of
27 June 2018. It decided that the Lago Agrio Judgment was based on the diffuse right
to live in a healthy environment, citing Article 19.2 of the 2008 Constitution and Articles
14 of the current Constitution: the Lago Agrio Litigation is “based on the right of people
to live in a healthy environment, and as this is a constitutional and collective right, it

must be focussed in our analysis.” !°7

This analysis is consistent with the powers of attorney granted by the named Lago Agrio
Plaintiffs to their representatives. Whatever the position in regard to these powers of
attorney (as to which there appears to be an issue), it is clear that these representatives
did not have any powers of attorney from individual members of the broader community
of 30,000 individuals (see also the Huani Litigation summarised in Part IV above).
Moreover, the “waiver of rights” against Ecuador and PetroEcuador ostensibly
conceded by the Aguinda Plaintiffs’ representatives (on 26 November 1996) was made

without powers of attorney from individuals comprising the broader community. !°

It is also consistent with statements made by Mr Donziger. These include the following,

taken from the Crude Outtakes: “But, you know, one change is in the beginning we

always felt like the case was only for, to get money to do a proper clean-up. But we,
we’ ve broadened that out to really come to the conclusion after a lot of analysis that we
should put in every category of damages we possibly can, other than direct

compensation to individuals” '® (emphasis here supplied).

Last but not least, at the Track II Hearing, the Tribunal understood that the Respondent
(which was not a party to the Lago Agrio Litigation) accepted that the Lago Agrio Court
did not award health-related damages based on any past or existing personal injury to

any specific person or persons.!!°

This factor regarding diffuse rights decided by the Lago Agrio Judgment is relevant to
the issue whether under the Treaty the Lago Agrio Judgment is barred by the 1995
Settlement Agreement (with related agreements), as the Claimants contend and the

Respondent denies. The Tribunal addresses this issue later in this Award, in Part VIII.
I: The Lago Agrio Judgment - Judge Zambrano

At the later RICO trial in New York, Dr Zambrano testified in writing and orally, subject
to cross-examination, in regard to the writing of the Lago Agrio Judgment.!!! Dr
Zambrano (who does not speak English) testified in Spanish, interpreted into English.
Dr Zambrano was no longer a judge, having been dismissed from Ecuadorian judiciary

in 2012.

As to the authorship of the Lago Agrio Judgment, Dr Zambrano testified at the
RICO trial:

“Q. Now, Mr. Zambrano, am I correct that it is your testimony that you are the sole
author of the Lago Agrio Chevron judgment? A. Yes.

Q. And that nobody else helped you write even a word of that judgment, that’s your
testimony, correct, sir? A. No.

Q. Who else helped you write even a word of that judgment, sir? A. When I dictated
it to the secretary, she would write what I was dictating.

RICO trial:

“@Q. You say she typed into the computer as you dictated the Lago Agrio judgment
to her, is that correct, sir? A. Yes ...

Q. Did you ever write out exactly what you wanted the judgment to say in longhand

Q. Dr Zambrano, did you ever show Ms [“C”] any documents for her to type from”
A. No...

Q. The words that Ms [“C”] typed into the computer as the Lago Agrio Chevron
judgment were all words that you spoke out loud as dictation to her and she then
typed them into the computer, correct? A. It was what I was dictating to her.” !\*

5.137. Dr Zambrano testified, also at the RICO trial, as to his general working methods for

drafting at the Lago Agrio Judgment, as follows:

“For starters, I would arrive at the office at six, 6:30 in the morning, or seven,
depending if it was raining. She [Ms “C”] would normally arrive at eight in the
morning. She would sit at the computer at the chair that’s in front of the table where
the [New] computer was, and she would begin the day by taking some of the extracts
of items that I had already singled out in some of the cuerpos, the annotations I had
made. I would begin dictating by taking a document from here, another one from
over here. So you have an idea as to what the office was set up, the cases, I’m sorry,
the cuerpos of the trial were laid out. On some of them I had the corresponding
annotations. On some occasions I would sit on the piece of furniture that was next
to her desk. I would dictate. Other times I would stand up because I would reach
for a document or refer to a cuerpo or to some other writing. I would refer to notes
that I had made and in my mind I was developing the idea I wanted to state so she
would type it accurately.” 1°

112 C_1980, pp. 1603-1604.

‘3 Dr Zambrano testified that Ms “C” was a young student whom Judge Zambrano employed temporarily from
mid-November 2010, at US$ 15 a day, at his own expense: C-1980, pp. 1659 & 1664.

5.138. The Tribunal notes that the Lago Agrio Judgment contains numbers, formulae and
abbreviations that do not lend themselves to mere oral dictation; and, in addition, it
contains out of order numeric sequences identical to those in the unfiled materials which
could not be the result of errors in dictation (see above). Dr Zambrano’s account of his

working methods is not credible. His account is not accepted by the Tribunal.
5.139. Later, as to authorship and research, Dr Zambrano testified:
“@Q. Did you work long hours to prepare the judgment, sir? A. Yes.

Q. Did you pour your heart and soul into working on that judgment, nights,
weekends? ... A. I worked many hours, many days, including several weekends.

Q. And nobody else provided assistance to you with the research you say you
needed to do to write the judgment, correct, sir? ... A. Could you please clarify what
you mean by assistance, in what sense?

Q. Nobody else provided assistance to you in connection with you preparing the
Lago Agrio Chevron judgment, correct, sir? ... A. No.

Q. Other than the typist you mentioned earlier, am I correct, sir, that nobody ... A.
No one has helped me to write the judgment. I was the one who exclusively drafted
it.

Q. And nobody helped you do the research you needed to do to write and author
the judgment, correct, sir? A. I did the research. 116

5.140. At the RICO trial, as regards the allegation that Dr Guerra played a part in drafting
orders in the Lago Agrio Litigation and the Lago Agrio Judgment, Dr Zambrano

testified:

“Q. Did Mr. Guerra help you with drafts in connection with the orders you issued
in the Chevron case? A. Never.

Q. Sir, am I correct, sir, that it would have been improper under Ecuadorian law
to have anyone else help you author the Lago Agrio Chevron judgment? A. Yes.”!!7

5.141. Atthe RICO trial, Dr Zambrano admitted that Dr Guerra had drafted other orders issued
by him:

416 C.1980, pp. 1607-1608.
417.1980, pp. 1648-1649.

Part V — Page 39

“Q: Sir, did there come a time when Mr Guerra was no longer a judge? A: Yes.
Q: And you were still a judge when Mr Guerra left the bench, correct? A: Yes.

Q: Am I correct, sir, that Mr Guerra helped you with the drafting of orders in your
cases back in 2010 and 2011? A: Yes.”!"8
5.142. Dr Zambrano further testified at the RICO trial that Ms “C” was responsible for carrying

out internet research:

“Q: ...While you were working on the Lago Agrio Chevron judgment, who
conducted the Internet searches on the new computer? A: I have stated that it was
Ms [“C”].

Q: Who else conducted Internet searches on the new computer on which you were
working on drafting the Lago Agrio judgment? A: I would give the topic to Ms
[“C”]. She would find it for me. Even when it was very late, she would take that
topic and then bring it back to me.

Q: ... She is the only person who did Internet searches you requested on the new
computer that you used to draft the Lago Agrio Chevron judgment, correct, sir? A:

Yes.

Q: Did you do any Internet searches yourself to help you research the Chevron
case, without Ms [“C”’]’s help, on that new computer?

A: No."""9

5.143. At the RICO trial, as regards the use of his “Old” and “New” computers for the Lago

Agrio Judgment, Dr Zambrano testified:

“@Q. Mr. Zambrano, I wanted to ask you some questions about the computer in your
office on which you dictated to Ms [“C”] the judgment in the Lago Agrio Chevron
case. Sir, was this computer an office computer assigned to you by the judicial
council? A. Yes.

Q. Was this a desktop computer? A. Yes.

418 C.1980, p. 1630.
419 C.1980, pp. 1683-1684.

Part V — Page 40

Q. All of the typing of the judgment was done on this one computer, not any other,
correct? A. Yes.

Q. When you first became a judge in Lago Agrio in 2008, you were assigned a
different computer by the judicial council, correct? A. Yes.

Q. And then when the court equipment was modernized, you received a new
computer from the judicial council, correct? A. Yes.

Q. It was on this new computer that the whole writing of the judgment was done,
correct? A. Yes.”!2°

5.144. Dr Zambrano was also questioned during the RICO trial about his use of Excel

spreadsheets:

“Q: Sir, were there ever any Excel spreadsheets left outside your door at the
courthouse in these packages you say were left there during the Lago Agrio
Chevron case? A: I don’t recall.

Q: Do you even know what an Excel spreadsheet is, sir? A: No.

Q: Sir, how did you calculate the percentages of TPH levels that are in this
judgment at pages 101 and 102, if you recall, sir? A: No.

Q: Can’t recall, correct? A: I don’t recall exactly.

The Court: What is your best recollection, sir? The Witness: This was taken from
the reports that were being submitted by the experts.” '*!

5.145. These percentages of TPH were not calculated from expert reports filed in the Lago
Agrio Court. Dr Zambrano’s explanation is also inconsistent with his testimony that he
dictated the Lago Agrio Judgment to his student secretary. Moreover, Dr Zambrano does
not speak English. The term “TPH” (shorthand for total petroleum hydrocarbon) is used
multiple times in the Lago Agrio Judgment, whereas the equivalent Spanish term is

“HTP”. !22 The explanation lies in the use of “TPH” in the unfiled Fusi6n Memorandum,

20 C.1980, pp. 1678-1679.
'21 C.1980, pp. 1697-1698.
122.1980, p. 1615.

Part V — Page 41

as used in the Lago Agrio Judgment in awarding US$ 5.4 billion for the cleaning-up of
TPH.

5.146. In relation to his workload during the period between October 2010 and February 2011,
Dr Zambrano testified at the RICO Trial:

“Q: Sir, during the period from October 2010 through February 14, 2011, you had
many other civil and criminal cases that were assigned to you to decide besides the
Lago Agrio Chevron case, correct? A: Yes.

Q: And you issued many other orders in your other cases during the period from
October 2010 through February 14, 2011, correct, sir? A: Could you please repeat
the question?

Q: You issued many other orders in your other cases besides the Lago Agrio
Chevron case during the period October 2010 to February 14, 2011, correct, sir?
A: Yes.

Q: In fact, it’s possible that you issued more than 200 written orders or judgments
in your other cases besides the Lago Agrio Chevron case between October 2010
and February 14, 2011, correct, sir? ...A: It is likely. 7123

5.147. On the specific question of bribery, Dr Zambrano testified at the RICO trial as follows:

“Q: Dr Zambrano, did you ever solicit a bribe in the Lago Agrio Chevron case
from anyone? A: Never, from no one.

Q: Did you ever agree to accept a bribe in the Lago Agrio case from anyone? A: I
would never do so because it would go against my principles.

Q: Did you ever agree for payment or the promise of payment to allow someone
else to write a part of the Lago Agrio Chevron judgment? A: No.

Q: Can you tell us whether or not you ever agreed in exchange for payment or the
promise of payment to, in the Lago Agrio Chevron case, to rule in favor of one
particular party? ... A: Never. As I’ve stated, that would go against my
principles.” '4

5.148. In his RICO Declaration, Dr Zambrano testified:

“\.. Since it was a complex and enormous case, I spent many hours working on the
case, especially at night. Obviously for logical reasons I spoke to different people,
especially Judges and former Judges for their points of view about certain aspects

23 C1980, pp. 1738-1739.
24 C1980, p. 1806.

5.150.

5.151.

of the case. I never consulted with any of the litigant parties. I confirm that I am the
only author of the judgment that I issued on February 14, 2011, and of the
clarification that I issued on March 4, 2011. I did not receive support or assistance
from Dr Alberto Guerra or from any other person, much less from the litigant
parties. It is not true that Dr Guerra reviewed the judgment, since neither he nor
anyone else reviewed it before it was issued. It is false that Dr Alberto Guerra
worked in my home. He has never entered my house in Lago Agrio or in any other
province for any reason. I have never told Dr Guerra to approach the parties to ask
them for money. I composed and prepared the judgment on the computer that the
Judiciary Council had assigned to me, which was in my possession prior to the
analysis of the principal subject matter of the trial. For such purpose each of the
documents submitted by the litigant parties was reviewed ...”'?°

The Tribunal has tried to give Dr Zambrano, as a witness, the benefit of any reasonable
doubt. He was testifying in a foreign procedure through an interpreter; he was
addressing events taking place years before; no judge recalls in full the details of his or
her judgment years later; he had probably never been cross-examined before; his cross-
examiner during his deposition appears to have lost his temper to an extent that would
shock any civilian lawyer; and, whilst Dr Zambrano was provided with his own counsel,
there was clearly insufficient time for him to brief her on the complexities of the Lago
Agrio Litigation and the Ecuadorian legal system. Further, it may be a significant
disadvantage for this Tribunal to assess his testimony on transcripts only, without seeing

Dr Zambrano testify in person.

Yet, having made all these and other allowances in his favour, it is clear from the
transcripts of his testimony that Dr Zambrano was a most unsatisfactory witness. In
short, the Tribunal finds his testimony, on material issues, incredible; and the Tribunal

does not accept it.
J: The Lago Agrio Judgment — Ms “C”

For the RICO Litigation in New York, Ms “C” testified, in writing, as Judge Zambrano’s
temporary student secretary. !”° Unfortunately, Ms “C” never gave any deposition in the
RICO Litigation or oral testimony at the RICO trial. It appears that she could have done
so, having received her visa from the USA before the end of the trial in the RICO

Litigation; but then the RICO defendants informed the Court that she would not testify

25 C1981, paras 13-15.
'26 C.2458 (Declaration); C-2387 (Direct Examination).

Part V — Page 43

at the RICO trial. As a result of her absence from the RICO trial, Ms “C” was never

cross-examined on her written testimony. Ms “C” was not a witness in this arbitration.

5.152. In her first Declaration of 30 October 2013, made in Spanish and sworn before a notary

in Lago Agrio, Ms “C” testified (with paragraph numbers here added):

“[1] ... declare that during the middle of the month of November of two thousand
ten, I was called by Attorney Nicolds Augusto Zambrano Lozada, in order to help
him with the digital entry of the cases that he was handling in his role as President
of the Provincial Court of Justice of Sucumbios, and, among others, on one very
particular case that I remember, called for DAMAGES being pursued by Ms
MARIA AGUINDA ET AL., against CHEVRON CORPORATION, and which was
numbered as ZERO ZERO TWO DASH TWO THOUSAND THREE (002-2003).”

[2] That my working hours were from eight a.m. to twelve p.m.; and from two p.m.
until six p.m., seven p.m., eight p.m., and on some occasions until nine p.m., and
that for this I received a daily salary of fifteen United States dollars. Additionally,
and in all honesty, I state that on most occasions after I left for my home, attorney
Nicolds Augusto Zambrano Lozada continued to work and he would lock the door;
1 did this until the end of the month of February of two thousand eleven when I told
attorney Nicolas Augusto Zambrano Lozada that I would not go anymore, because
my university studies did not allow me to do so;

[3] Likewise, I must state that during the time that I worked exclusively for attorney
Nicolds Augusto Zambrano Lozada, I only received dictation from him, and that he
did it from his handwritten notes that he took every day and from the constant
review of a large number of binders that case had. I also declare, that when attorney
Nicolds Augusto Zambrano Lozada left the office to fulfill his duties, he asked me
to also leave and wait for him outside until he returned; he never left me alone in
his office, he did not allow it, and he also did not allow outside people to enter it,
nor did I ever see attorney Nicoldés Augusto Zambrano Lozada, with regard to the
referenced case, have any discussion with anyone, at least in my presence.

[4] The judgment of the case: Maria Aguinda et al. against Chevron Corporation
dated February fourteenth of the year two thousand eleven, at eight thirty-seven
a.m. Likewise, I declare that during the time that I spent in attorney Nicolds Augusto
Zambrano Lozada’s office, I did not receive instructions, or dictation, from any
other person that were not those from attorney Nicolas Augusto Zambrano Lozada,
neither was a pen-drive or CD or another storage device used in the digital entry
of the judgment in the case being pursued by Maria Aguinda et al., against
CHEVRON CORPORATION. This is all I have to declare, in all honesty...” 127

5.153. In her subsequent witness statement of 12 November 2013, made in Spanish and signed

in Quito, Ms “C” testified in similar terms:

27 C2458.

Part V — Page 44

28 C2387.

“7. Tam an Ecuadorian citizen of twenty years of age. I have my domicile at ... of
the city of Nueva Loja, in the Providence of Sucumbios. Iam currently studying law
at the Universidad Tecnica Particular de Loja [Private Technical University of
Loja], and working at the National Development Bank, in the legal department.

2. Between the month of November of the year 2010, and the end of February 2011,
I worked for Dr Nicolas Augusto Zambrano Lozada. My work mainly consisted of
typing on a computer the text of the ruling of the trial known as “Aguinda, et al. v.
Chevron Corporation” (number 002-2003), following the dictation of Dr
Zambrano. The ruling was handed down on February 14 of the year 2011.

3. The work for Dr Zambrano I performed in his office, in the Provincial Court of
Justice of Sucumbios, in the city of Nueva Loja, at a desk with a computer that was
available there. For my work, I received the amount of $15 USD daily, and my work
schedule was from 8am to 12pm, and from 2pm to 5, 6, 7, 8 and even until 9pm.
When I would leave, Dr Zambrano in many occasions would stay in his office.

4. The typing process of the aforementioned ruling was as follows: Dr Zambrano
had in his office many files of the record, as well as great quantities of handwritten
notes, and other research texts. He would constantly review and contrast these
materials, going from one side of his office to the other, as he would dictate the
sentence to me while I would type it in the computer. At no time did Dr Zambrano
base his dictation on preexisting printed versions of the ruling; I can attest to this
because of the slow pace that he had when dictating his ideas, sometimes returning
to previous parts and correcting them.

5. Another of the tasks entrusted to me by Dr Zambrano was doing general Internet
research of rulings and other reference texts, which I would print and hand them
over for his reading and analysis. For this, I always used the computer of the Court.
I do not remember which were the subjects or matters that he entrusted to me to
research.

6. Dr Zambrano was always very careful and would verify that his office was always
safe, always leaving it locked in his absence. When he was absent during my work
schedule, he would ask me to wait for his return outside of his office.

7. During the time that I worked for Dr Zambrano typing the ruling, there was never
a third person present in his office, and I never received a dictation or instructions
from any person other than Dr Zambrano.

8. During all of the time of dictation and typing of the ruling, there was never
connected to the computer on which I worked any external storage device such as
USB drive (pen drive) or external hard drive, nor were there any CD or DVD
inserted in the same.” '8

5.157.

It is evident that Ms “C’’s written testimony, albeit limited, ostensibly supports the
testimony of Dr Zambrano in general terms. However, having not been subjected to any
cross-examination at the RICO trial (or in this arbitration), the Tribunal accords her
written testimony no weight on any material issue of fact. There also many unanswered
questions arising from her testimony, including the scope of her foreign language skills
and her abilities as a researcher of foreign legal materials. Ms “C” was a 17 or 18 year-
old student paid US$ 15 an hour; and she was neither a trained legal assistant nor a

professional secretary.

The Tribunal records that there is no evidence before this Tribunal that Ms “C”
participated in or was aware of any ‘ghostwriting’ during her brief and limited
employment by Judge Zambrano. Moreover, the Tribunal has grave reservations as to
the manner in which the two statements were produced in her name in the RICO

Litigation.
K: The Lago Agrio Judgment - Dr Guerra

For the RICO trial in New York and for this arbitration, Dr Guerra testified in the form
of his three RICO statements,!”° his depositions of 2 May 2013'*° and 5 November
2013;'*! his oral testimony at the RICO trial,'°? his Witness Statement!*? and his oral

testimony at the Track IT Hearing. !*4
In his RICO statement, Dr Guerra testified:

“\.. 25. In late January or early February of 2011, approximately two weeks before
the trial court in the Chevron case issued the judgment, Mr Zambrano gave me a
draft of the judgment so that I could revise it. It was through him that I found out
that the attorneys for the [Lago Agrio] Plaintiffs had written that judgment and had
delivered it to him. Mr Zambrano asked me to work on the document to fine-tune
and polish it so it would have a more legal framework. In recalling these facts
initially, I assumed I had received the document on a flash drive given to me by Mr
Zambrano in the Quito airport, as he usually did with the projects I helped him
with. But later on I specifically remembered that I worked on that document in Mr
Zambrano’s residence in Lago Agrio using Mr Fajardo’s computer. I do not recall
the exact date this happened, but I worked on the draft judgment for several hours

during two days. Mr Zambrano explicitly asked me not to make copies nor leave
traces of this document nor the changes I was making, outside of the file on which
I worked.

26. I began to work on the document as soon as I received it. First I read the
holding and I began to work on several sections that needed more structure and
basis, especially with terminology related to envir Llaw.I ber that I
called Mr Fajardo on his cell phone to ask him about some sections of the document
that confused me. Mr Fajardo told me not to worry and that he would e-mail me a
memory aid to clarify my questions. Mr Fajardo e-mailed me a document of around
10 to 12 pages titled “Memory Aid,” with some information about the case. In
reality, the document did not help me much with my doubts, so that day I worked
on punctuation and spelling. I spent the following day making around 20 changes
to improve its structure and make it seem more like a judgment issued by the
Sucumbios Court.

 

27. Overall, I made very few changes to this document—mostly word changes due
to personal preference - and the document I returned to Mr Zambrano was not too
different from the one the Plaintiffs had given him.

28. Based on what Mr. Zambrano told me, it is my understanding that the Plaintiffs’
attorneys made changes to the judgment up to the very last minute before it was
published. But I have never read the final judgment that was published on February
14, 2011 and signed by Judge Zambrano; therefore I don’t know for certain what
changes were made after I turned the project over to Mr. Zambrano.
After Mr. Zambrano issued the judgment, I assisted him over the phone as he
prepared the supplemental and clarification order for the judgment...” °°

5.158. At the Track II Hearing, Dr Guerra testified that Judge Zambrano gave him a draft of

5.159.

the Lago Agrio Judgment for his review and comments a couple of weeks before the
issue of the Judgment on 14 February 2011 (i.e. in the last week of January or the first
week of February 2011); and that Dr Zambrano told him he had received it from Mr
Fajardo. °° Judge Zambrano also told Dr Guerra that he (Judge Zambrano) would
receive US$ 500,000 for agreeing to let the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs prepare the Lago
Agrio Judgment, to be paid once they “received the product of the judgment when it

was implemented.” '!>7

At the Track II Hearing, under cross-examination, Dr Guerra also testified that, upon
studying the draft Judgment, he contacted Mr Fajardo for an explanation of certain

issues that concerned him. As a result, Mr Fajardo supplied Dr Guerra with a document

85 C.1616A, paras 25-28.

he did not use i

known as “the Memory Aid”.'38 However, this document did not help Dr Guerra; and

t.89

Apart from the Memory Aid, there is no corroboration of these two aspects of Dr
Guerra’s testimony from any contemporary documentation or electronic record. The
Memory Aid, by itself, is an inconclusive document. In these circumstances, the

Tribunal accords little weight to this part of Dr Guerra’s testimony.

L: The Lago Agrio Judgment - Mr Donziger

5.161. In his final written testimony, Mr Donziger testified:

“T did not write the judgment in the Aguinda case in Ecuador. I have no knowledge
that anybody on the legal team of the plaintiffs wrote the judgment in this case, or
wrote any part of the judgment.

Thave never met Judge Nicolas Zambrano, nor have I ever communicated with him.
Other than his live testimony during this trial, I have never seen Judge Nicolas
Zambrano.

I did not bribe Judge Zambrano. The allegations by former Judge Alberto Guerra
that I was involved in a meeting where I approved a plan suggested by Pablo
Fajardo to pay Zambrano $500,000 is false. Chevron has no evidence that I had
any involvement in bribing any judge apart from Guerra’s thoroughly false and
corrupt testimony.

I have no knowledge of anybody on the plaintiffs’ team paying or seeking to pay
Judge Zambrano.” '*°

5.162. In his depositions, Mr Donziger testified:

“Q: Did anyone affiliated in any way with the Lago Agrio plaintiffs provide any
portion of the text of the Fusién Memo, Exhibit 1806A, in any form to Judge
Zambrano prior to February I*', 2011? A: I don’t believe so.

Q: Did anyone affiliated in any way with the Lago Agrio plaintiffs provide any
portion of the Fusién Memo marked as Exhibit 1806A to anyone associated with
Judge Zambrano prior to February I of 2011? A: I don’t believe so. But to be as
clear as possible, it is possible this memo was provided to the court to be put into
evidence, or some version of it.

38 R-1331, para 3.
89 Track II Hearing D4.778-779.
440 C.2385, paras 71-74.

Part V — Page 48

5.163.

5.164.

5.165.

Q: Are you aware of an occasion on which Exhibit 1806A, the Fusién memo, was
provided to the court in Lago Agrio? A: No.

... Q: Prior to February 1" of 2011 did anyone affiliated in any way with the Lago
Agrio plaintiffs draft a judgment that included any portion of the text of the Fusion
memo? A: No, not that I know of,'*!

Q: Prior to February 1" of 2011, you were involved in having draft Lago Agrio
judgments prepared, correct? A: No, I don’t believe so.

Q: Would you agree that portions of the rest of the Fusién memo, Exhibit 1806A,
were at some point in some form provided to Judge Zambrano? A: I wouldn’t
characterise it that way, no. 142

... Q: Did the Lago Agrio plaintiff team at any time develop a proposed judgment
for the Lago Agrio case? A: I don’t believe so. I don’t know. It is possible.

Q: Did you personally ever draft any portion of a draft judgment for Lago Agrio?
A: I don’t believe so.”
In the Tribunal’s view, Mr Donziger’s guarded answers based on his non-belief, lack of
knowledge or even possibilities, when he was one of the principal actors at all material
times with personal knowledge of almost every aspect of the Lago Agrio Litigation, are
curiously evasive. None can be categorised as an unequivocal denial of the

‘ghostwriting’ of the Lago Agrio Judgment.

In the circumstances, the Tribunal does not accept that Mr Donziger had no knowledge,
at the time, as to the ‘ghostwriting’ of the Lago Agrio Judgment by certain of the Lago
Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives, in corrupt collusion with Judge Zambrano. The
Tribunal finds that Mr Donziger, with others, was privy to such ‘ghostwriting’ and

collusion.
M: The Judgment of the Lago Agrio Appellate Court (2012)

By its judgment of 3 January 2012, extending over 16 pages, the Lago Agrio Appellate
Court affirms the Lago Agrio Judgment.'*+ It upholds the punitive damages award

because Chevron had refused publicly to “apologise”. It also decides that it cannot

address Chevron’s fraud allegations regarding the conduct of the Lago Agrio Litigation.
The appeal was otherwise, ostensibly, a de novo hearing based on the evidence filed the
Lago Agrio Court. Given the volume and complexity of that evidence, grave doubts

arise as to the thoroughness required for such a de novo hearing,

As to the nature of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ claims decided by the Lago Agrio Court,
the Appellate Court confirms that the Lago Agrio Judgment addressed and decided these
claims unequivocally as “diffuse” claims and not as individual claims made by a
plaintiff seeking compensation for personal harm to that individual plaintiff (see above
for the references to the Appellate Court’s Judgment and subsequent order clarifying its

judgment).
As to Chevron’s “fraud” allegations, this judgment of the Appellate Court reads in part:

“Mention is also made of fraud and corruption of plaintiffs, counsel and
representatives, a matter to which this Division should not refer at all, except to let
it be emphasized that the same accusations are pending resolution before
authorities of the United States of America due to a complaint that has been filed
by the very defendant here, Chevron, under what is known as the RICO act, and
this Division has no competence to rule on the conduct of counsel, experts or other
officials or administrators and auxiliaries of justice, if that were the case.” '4°

The Appellate Court issues a Clarification Order of its Appellate Judgment on 13
January 2012. It effectively grants the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ requests for clarification,
including a statement that the Appellate Court had considered and rejected evidence of

the fraudulent conduct of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives.

The relevant passage, relating to the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ seventh request, merits
citation in full. It reads (in English translation, with numbered paragraphs here added

for ease of reference) as follows: '*°

“7, [1] In relation to the seventh request for clarification, regarding whether or not
the defendant’s accusations with respect to irregularities in the preparation of the
trial court judgment have been considered, it is clarified that yes such allegations
have been considered, but no reliable evidence of any crime have been found.

[2] The Division concluded that the evidence provided by Chevron Corporation,
does not lead anywhere without a good dose of imaginative representation,
therefore it has not been given any merit, nor has more space been dedicated to it.

[3] But it is appropriate to say that the Division rejects in this point, and
definitively, as unfounded, the defendant’s affirmation in chapter “C” of its legal
brief that the judgment has been based on information foreign to the record, or with
secret assistance, because, as the Division reviewed and explained in the 3 January
2012 judgment, all the valid evidence that has been considered, that is to say, all of
the samples, documents, reports, testimonies, interviews, transcripts and minutes,
referred to in the judgment, are found in the record without the defendant
identifying any that is not — the defendant’s motions simply show disagreement with
the reasoning, the interpretation and the value given to the evidence, but they do
not identify correctly legal evidence that is in the record.

[4] The texts indicated by Chevron Corporation, as an example that the judgment
has been based on information foreign to the record, are not considered or put forth
as legal evidence, not even by the defendant itself in its claim, for which reason the
Division understands that it is not alleging that the judgment has been sustained on
evidence foreign to the record.

[5] Therefore, starting by considering that only the evidence legally produced is
deemed authentic in trial about the facts in dispute, and that which must be in the
record, it is concluded that the appealed judgment is based on legally presented
evidence, that is in the record, although certainly the reasoning and the
interpretation, as human — of the judge — having his intellect as source of origin,
are incorporated in the record through his rulings.

[6] It is noted that on at least one occasion of which this Division is aware, the
defendant provided a considerable amount of information to the President of the
Court, related to an arbitration case between Chevron Corporation and the
Government of Ecuador. This information was not introduced into the record of
case 002-2003 and has not been able to be valued by this Division due to the fact
that the defendant has not formally entered it into the lawsuit, but even so, and in
the Division’s opinion, it was known and studied by the lower court judge.

[7] In this scenario, the plaintiffs have denounced that Chevron Corporation
alleged in the United States of America, one day after the appealed judgment was
issued on 14 February 2011, that it suspected that Judge Zambrano had received
‘secret assistance’ in drafting the judgment, and therefore now it is untimely to try
to say this — before the Division — and not before who ruled on the cause in the first
instance so that he clarify them.

 

[8] And there is no explanation for reserving these ‘suspicions’ in order to put them
forth before this Division, if we consider, as the plaintiffs’ reference, that the
defendant knew of this supposed fact the day following issuance of the judgment.
Apart from what has been said, this Division further considers it pertinent to make
an observation about the ‘secret assistance’ that is spoken of for drafting the first

Part V — Page 51

instance judgment, and that is because of the sense of logical orientation it is
difficult to conceive that, were a secret channel to have existed, used illegally by
the plaintiffs to supplement or modify the judgment, that pathway would have
allowed for the introduction of arguments that were decisive for the resolution of
this lawsuit.

[9] The Division cannot fail to observe that the defendant’s arguments to uphold
its accusations revolve around points that in reality do not provide more
information that would shore up the defended position, which put in doubt any
attributed secret conspiracy. It would not be fitting, therefore, for the defendant to
be able easily to say that what is alleged is just an indication of a greater problem
since it is public knowledge that legal proceedings for production of documents
proposed by the defendant in the United States of America allowed it to access the
vast majority of the internal documents prepared by the plaintiffs’ representatives.

[10] If there had been any ‘secret assistance’, the presumed concordance between
the plaintiffs’ internal documentation, and the text of the judgment would not be
limited to a fairly simple interpretation of evidence that is contained in the record.
This is a civil proceeding in which the Division does not find evidence of ‘fraud’ by
the plaintiffs or their representatives, such that, as has been said, it stays out of
these accusations, preserving the parties’ rights to present formal complaint to the
Ecuadorian criminal authorities or to continue the course of the actions that have
been filed in the United States of America. This was a determining factor for the
Division’s considerations in the judgment that is being clarified, since it is obvious
that it was not its responsibility to hear and resolve proceedings that correspond to
another jurisdiction, nor was it admissible to detain the processing of this principal
lawsuit — or worse, to annul it — in order to discuss and make a pronouncement on
the interminable and reciprocal accusations over misconduct of some of the parties’
attorneys, experts or contractors, which is why these could not affect the final result
of the lawsuit.

  

 

[11] However, this Division expresses its concern over the possibility that the abuse
of right extends abroad, with the same intent shown of depriving the plaintiffs of the
right that has been declared in this proceeding. It is clarified that the interests at
play in this judicial proceeding exceed the interests of the adversaries or their
representatives, who in the event that they feel damaged have their rights preserved
to exercise them by independent channels.” !4”

This statement in the Clarification Order seems materially inconsistent with the passage
in the Appellate Judgment, cited above. In any event, it is somewhat difficult to follow
the logic of the Appellate Court. It appears to limit its consideration to “legal evidence
that is in the record” of the Lago Agrio Court. Chevron’s complaint was not so limited.
Nor could it have been before the Lago Agrio Judgement was issued by the Lago Agrio

Court.

In the circumstances, the Tribunal adopts the expert testimony of Dr Coronel to the
effect that “the appellate court specifically refused to fulfil its obligation to perform a
comprehensive review of both the facts and the law regarding the dispute, as well as the

allegations of fraud, as Chevron Corporation (‘Chevron’) had requested it to do.” '48

N: The Judgment of the Cassation Court (2013)

12 November 2013: The Cassation (National) Court issues its Judgment affirming part
of the Lago Agrio Judgment; but it nullifies the punitive damages imposed for
Chevron’s omission to “apologise”, as required by that Judgment and as upheld by the
Appellate Court.'*° As a result, the Cassation Court reduces the Lago Agrio Judgment’s

award of damages to US$ 8.6 billion, with 10% to be paid to the ADF.

The grounds for Chevron’s cassation appeal included: (i) the inadequate application,
lack of application or erroneous interpretation of procedural rules resulting in the
irremediable nullity of the proceedings or in the appellant’s defenselessness, provided
they have influenced the judgment and that the respective nullity has not been legally
validated; (ii) the judgment’s lack of formal requirements provided for by law or the
adoption of incompatible or contradictory decisions in the judgment’s operative part;
(iii) an extra petita or infra petita judgment; (iv) the inadequate application, lack of
application or erroneous interpretation of applicable evidentiary rules, provided they
lead to an erroneous application or to the lack of application of legal rules in the

judgment; and (v) the inadequate application, lack of application or erroneous

interpretation of applicable legal rules, including mandatory judicial precedent, which
were determinative for the judgment’s operative part. In short, these grounds included

Chevron’s fraud allegations and the ‘ghostwriting’ of the Lago Agrio Judgment.

The first 48 pages of the Judgment summarise the cassation claims made by Chevron.
At pages 48-51, the Judgment sets forth the limits on the Cassation Court’s powers to
annul an inferior court’s decision. Such limits are essentially of formalistic nature and
are listed in Article 346 (formerly 355) of the Ecuadorian Code of Civil Procedure.
Consequently, under Ecuadorian law, cassation controls do not extend to the review of
evidence. An evaluation of the evidence is permissible only when the inferior decision
was manifestly illogical, irrational or arbitrary (see pages 145-166 of the Judgment, No.
8.2ff). The purpose of the cassation review (as the Judgment states) is not to serve as a
third instance appeal. It is limited to ensuring that the principles of legality and the
respect of the Constitution of Ecuador are safeguarded. The Cassation Court confirms
that its controls are limited to judging whether such principles have been infringed by

the Appellate Court, but that they do not extend further to the Lago Agrio Judgment.
Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the Cassation Court:

(a) Did not review de novo the conclusion of the Lago Agrio Court or the
confirmation by the Appellate Court of the assertion of jurisdiction over
Chevron by the Lago Agrio Court on the basis of the Chevron and Texaco
“merger”; the Cassation Court accepted that Chevron voluntarily accepted the
jurisdiction of the Ecuadorian courts, particularly of the Lago Agrio Court, in
the Aguinda Litigation in New York (Nos. 5.2-5.4, pages 51-67; No. 6.4. pages
110-111);

(b) Did not review any expert reports as to their legality, consistency, weight,
intrinsic value, contradictions, whether they were “ghostwritten” or not, or

review their evaluation by Judge Zambrano (No. 5.11, page 85);

(c

Did not review whether there had been any procedural fraud committed by the
Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives; moreover, procedural fraud would not be
known under Ecuadorian civil law or criminal law; and it is not a ground to
nullify a court decision in Ecuador (No. 5.13, pages 89-91; No. 6.12, pages
120-121);

Part V — Page 54

(d

(f)

(g

Did not pronounce itself on the integrity or independence of Judges Yanez,
Nufiez, Ordofiez, Zambrano or the validity of Dr Calmbacher’s testimony

(No. 5.15, pages 93-96);

Did not consider or determine whether the Lago Agrio Judgment or other court
orders in the Lago Agrio Litigation were “ghostwritten” or not (No. 5.16, pages

98-99);

Did not review whether the Lago Agrio Court’s conclusions on the principle of
causality for harm or damages were correct or whether the Lago Agrio Court
contradicted itself in the calculation of damages, or whether the damages were
correctly calculated by the Lago Agrio Court (Nos. 6.7, 6.8, pages 115- 117);

and

Did not establish whether the Lago Agrio Judgment was based on evidence not
asked for, not produced or not ordered in accordance with Ecuadorian law (No.

6.9, pages .118-119).

5.176. The Judgment also rejected the submissions made by Chevron, by the Cassation Court’s

decisions:

@

(ii)

The Lago Agrio Court had subject-matter jurisdiction to apply the 1999 EMA;
and, thus, the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs had standing to pursue “diffuse” rights (No.
5.6, pages 67-75);

Although the Judgment upheld Chevron’s cassation claim of insufficient reasons
regarding the falsity of signatures for some of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs in the
Lago Agrio Complaint, the Cassation Court minimises the importance of such
falsity. It decides that that such falsity, even if proven true, had been cured by
several presentations throughout the Lago Agrio Litigation by representatives
duly empowered by such Plaintiffs; and that, in any case, such issues were not
for civil courts (nor for the Cassation Court), but for criminal courts to
investigate and determine. It also decides that the validity of the powers of
attorneys, representing the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs, were public documents whose
authenticity could only be challenged in the criminal courts (No. 5.12, pages 86-
90; No. 6.2, page 104-106);

Part V — Page 55

(iii) The 1995 Settlement Agreement lacks the effect of res judicata in respect of
diffuse rights such as those claimed by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs; neither the
State of Ecuador nor its Municipalities had the exclusive right to advance or
protect such rights prior to the 1999 EMA; and, even before the EMA,
individuals had the right to advance or assert “diffuse” rights. Therefore,
Chevron’s argument that there was a retrospective application of substantive
provisions of the EMA by the Lago Agrio Court was unfounded (No. 9.3-9.8,
pages 174-202);

(iv) The Cassation Court applies the 1999 EMA to Chevron, essentially on the basis
of Article 396 of the (then current) Ecuadorian Constitution, establishing an
objective basis for the causation of harm in Ecuador when attributing
environmental liability. Such liability would also carry with it the jurisdiction of
Ecuadorian courts to hear and decide claims, even in respect of companies not
present in Ecuador and, as well, to dispense with any requirement to identify
PetroEcuador’s shared responsibility for environmental damage claimed in the

Lago Agrio Litigation against Chevron (No. 6.6, pages 113-115); and

(v) The Cassation Court concludes that the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ claims, as
addressed by the Lago Agrio Court and the Appellate Court, were “diffuse” and
not individual claims for personal loss or damage suffered by the Lago Agrio

Plaintiffs as individuals.

5.177. As regards Chevron’s allegations regarding “procedural fraud”, the Cassation Judgment

states, in material part (with citations here omitted):

“Chevron Corporation alleges that there is a ‘great collusive demonstration’.
When collusion is an independent action governed by our Ecuadorian legislation,
it is so regulated under the Collusion Prosecution Act; and, as stated by this
Division of the Court, it is not possible to seek the cassation of a judgment by
making these kinds of allegations, even more so when, according to the cassation
appellant’s affirmations, Judge Nufiez was subject to a proceeding before the
Judicial Council. Therefore, the affirmation made by the court of appeals is the
correct one, as it is not within its scope of that court to have jurisdiction to hear
collusive action cases within a summary verbal proceeding, or procedural fraud,
judges’ behaviours, proper and improper meetings, the appointment of substitute
judges, plaintiffs’ connivance, among other allegations made by the appellant
company.

Part V — Page 56

With respect to the various ancillary proceedings for clarification and expansion
alleged in cassation by appellant, which are an essential part of the procedural
sequence, also known as horizontal remedies and decided by the court of appeals,
in that it lacks jurisdiction to hear and decide cases of procedural fraud, it is for
that reason that the order for clarification requested by the parties allows such
parties to bring such legal actions as they believe are available to them. In
determining in a sufficient and clear manner that there was no procedural fraud in
these proceedings, in the opinion of the Appeals Court, does not mean that the order
issued on January 3, 2012 is inconsistent with the judgment rendered on January
13, 2012; it is clear that, by preserving the rights and actions of the parties, the
court acknowledges the lack of jurisdiction to decide whether or not there has been
procedural fraud.

The conclusion that emerges from the foregoing is that there is no contradiction
between the judgment handed down on January 3, 2012 and the order issued on
January 13, 2012, or any kind of arbitrariness. Arbitrariness occurs when the order
or judgment go against the law, in this specific case and as already reviewed by
this Cassation Court, through the lack of jurisdiction of the court of appeals to
decide on matters such as procedural fraud, there is no arbitrariness and,
accordingly, Article 281 of the Code of Civil Procedure has not been infringed. For
these reasons the charge is dismissed.

As explained [above], the fact that the Trial Court has determined that there is no
evidence of procedural fraud, and at the same time, lacks jurisdiction to decide on
such matters, does not mean that there is any inconsistency, because 1) The subject
matter of the judgment is not the existence or absence of procedural fraud. 2)
Jurisdiction to decide on the existence of procedural fraud does not lie with the trial
court or with the Appeals Court.

If the Court does not find the evidence required to determine the existence or
absence of procedural fraud, this does not, in and of itself, mean that there was
none, since under the law of most countries and as discussed and explained in this
judgment, such matters are dealt with separately, and the subject matter of the
action is the determination of whether or not procedural fraud was committed. The
matters in dispute in this case are different, the action is based on other grounds,
and it is a summary verbal proceeding, which cannot be used to determine this type
of ancillary proceeding.”

5.178. In thus affirming the Lago Agrio Judgment, the Cassation Court did not review the
merits of any of Chevron’s allegations of fraud in the conduct of the Lago Agrio

Litigation or the ‘ghostwriting’ of the Lago Agrio Judgment. However, in commenting

50 C.1975, pp. 95, 120-121 (regarding Chevron’s Cassation Appeal: C-1068).

Part V — Page 57

upon the Cassation Court’s lack of jurisdiction to adjudicate upon Chevron’s
allegations, the Cassation Court noted that these allegations were being heard in the

pending RICO litigation in New York, USA.'*!

5.179. It is not entirely clear to the Tribunal whether the Cassation Court (or, previously, the
Appellate Court) was here effectively relinquishing to the US Courts the allegations of
fraud advanced by Chevron to impugn the Lago Agrio Judgment. Although that appears
to be the conclusion reached much later by the US Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit in the RICO Litigation, the Tribunal does not here assume that this was in fact
so.'? As regards the Cassation Court, that would have been inconsistent with its citation

of the Ecuadorian Collusion Prosecution Act (the “CPA”; see above).
O: The Judgment of the Constitutional Court (2018)

5.180. 27 June 2018: The Constitutional Court issues its Judgment on 27 June 2018, !53
affirming the Judgment of the Cassation (National) Court (2013),'* following public
hearings held on 16 July 2015 and 22 May 2018. The Constitutional Court declares that
there is no violation of constitutional law, as alleged by Chevron; the Court rejects the
Extraordinary Action of Protection made by Chevron; and it orders its judgment “[t]o

be recorded, published and enforced.” !5>

5.181. The Constitutional Court Judgment includes summaries of the submissions made by
Chevron, as well as submissions made by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs, the ADF, the Office
of the Respondent’s Attorney-General and amici curiae. The Constitutional Court’s
reasons for its Judgment extend over some 100 pages (in Spanish), under nine
Chapters.'*° For present purposes, its principal reasons may be summarised as follows,

with parts of its text meriting full quotation.

151 C1975, pp. 120-121.

'S2 In the Second Circuit’s Judgment, the Court decided: “Jn these circumstances, in which the district court has,
on the claims of corruption, granted equitable in personam relief that does not invalidate the Ecuadorian
judgment, and in which the Ecuadorian courts have expressly disclaimed jurisdiction to address the corruption
claims and stated that the matter is preserved for adjudication in the United States courts, international comity is
not an obstacle to the present District Court Judgment.” (C-2540, p. 116).

Part V — Page 58

5.182. Under Chapter 1 of the Judgment, the Constitutional Court decides that there was no

5.183.

infringement of Chevron’s “right to be tried by a competent judge and in pursuance of
the corresponding due process of law applicable to each proceedings”; i.e. the Lago

Agrio Court, the Lago Agrio Appellate Court and the Cassation Court.

The Constitutional Court affirms (inter alia) the decisions of these three courts that, for
the purpose of their jurisdiction (“competence”) and liability to the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs
in the Lago Agrio Litigation, Chevron had assumed Texaco’s and TexPet’s liabilities as
aresult of the “merger” between Texaco and Chevron in 2001. The Constitutional Court

decides Chevron’s jurisdictional objection, as follows: !°”

. the first item to be discussed within the question put forward above bears
relationship with the fact of identifying the linkage or relationship that, according
to the affected parties, existed between the defendant company Chevron
Corporation and the company that operated in the contaminated area until the year
1992, named TexPet, and that, as determined in the lawsuit for environmental
damage, was the person liable for the damage caused. Although this analysis may
at first sight be related to the identification of the corresponding, lawful opposing
party to this lawsuit, it actually seeks to establish above all a linkage allowing for
the determination of the competence of the Ecuadorian judges. That is why, after a
lengthy and well-founded analysis made by the lower court judge and ratified by
the Court of Appeals and the Cassation Court, it was found that the Ecuadorian
company TexPet was an affiliated company of the parent company Texaco Inc., and
this latter company had in turn merged with the American company Chevron
Corporation, a circumstance that within the corporate setting made it possible to
establish that Chevron had undertaken any and all subsequent liabilities for the
acts then performed by the company Texaco Ine. and its affiliated companies. As a
matter of fact, this conclusion drawn by the trial court judge did not only make it
possible to identify the corresponding lawful opposing party within the lawsuit, but
it also allowed for the connection of this fact with the events taking place at the
Court for the Southern District of New York before the date on which the lawsuit
for environmental damages was filed, where within the case for environmental
damages entitled Sequihua v. Texaco [the Aguinda Litigation], the American court
found that the most appropriate forum to try said controversy was Ecuador, since
the alleged damage was caused in said country, a circumstance that was accepted
by Texaco Inc., thus opening the way for the Ecuadorian courts to enjoy sufficient
competence to hear and settle any lawsuits filed on the grounds of environmental
harm then caused by the company TexPet, whose parent company was Texaco Inc.
and that now is, on the basis of the merger undergone by said company, according
to the Ecuadorian courts, Chevron Corporation.”

5.184. From this and other passages, the Tribunal understands that, for the purposes of both

jurisdiction and liability in the Lago Agrio Litigation, the Constitutional Court treats

57.2551, pp. 62-63.

Part V — Page 59

5.185.

5.186.

5.187.

Chevron as if it were TexPet and Texaco and an active participant in their activities in
Ecuador from 1964 onwards in the concession area. This understanding is confirmed by
a later passage in the Constitutional Court’s Judgment referring to the difficulty in
establishing the timing of polluting incidents “from the overall operation of the oil
company for about 28 years.”!>* In context, this reference targets Chevron as the
polluting “oil company” during the period of TexPet’s concession from 1964 to 1992,

a period of 28 years.

Under Chapter 2 of the Judgment, the Constitutional Court decides that the Judgment of
the Cassation Court did not infringe “the constitutional right to the effective judicial

protection by failing to declare the procedural fraud alleged by Chevron.”

The Constitutional Court describes Chevron’s allegations of procedural fraud, as

follows: !°

“\.. The actions that, in the words of the appellant, have caused a massive fraud or
procedural fraud within the lawsuit brought against it, are: the plaintiffs’ furtive
collaboration in the ghostwriting of the trial court judgment, the influence they
exerted for the appointment of the expert witness and the forgery of the expert
witness’ report that eventually did, whether directly or indirectly, serve as the basis
for the assessment of the alleged environmental damage. On such bases, the
appellant does hereby sustain that it has been proven in the various judicial stages
that there has been a severely gross procedural fraud committed by the attorneys
of the plaintiffs with the support of the judicial authorities, by means of the evidence
produced at that moment, which was obtained by means of court orders issued in
proceedings pursued in the United States of America.”

The Constitutional Court decides that the Cassation Court had no power to decide
Chevron’s allegations of procedural fraud. It states, as follows (with footnotes here

omitted):

“\.. it should be remarked that the cassation appeal does not constitute another
trial stage in the court proceedings, wherein issues of fact previously reviewed by
the trial court judges can be freely discussed; but rather, it is by means of the
cassation appeal that the judges of the National Court of Justice, who are in charge
of hearing such an appeal, undertake a review of the jurisdictional activity of the
lower trial court judges, in respect of the application of the rules of law within their
judgments or orders intended to close declaratory proceedings or trials. It is
thereby ruled out any possibility that the cassation court judges may order the
production and examination of evidence, make any assessment of the evidentiary

58 C2551, p. 110.
59 C2551, p. 67.

Part V — Page 60

elements or being to discuss any facts previously heard by the trial court judges,
since any such actions would result in an infringement of judicial independence and
legal certainty, duly guaranteed by the Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador.”

5.188. Later, the Constitutional Court concludes: '!

. it is clear that nullity as a procedural concept corresponds to the grounds
expressly set out in the Law, therefore, for such nullity to possibly take effect as an
argument within a cassation appeal, it must, apart from observing the conditions
established in section 3 of the Cassation Act - i.e. exert influence on the decision of
the case or not having been legally validated - comply with the requirements
established by Law, in the specific case at hand, the Code of Civil Procedure, as it
is the currently applicable law at the time of said civil lawsuit; otherwise, the
alleged error in the application or interpretation of procedural rules alleged by the
company lodging this cassation appeal cannot be analyzed as a ground for the
cassation appeal, insofar as it does not represent any materialization of an
incurable nullity within the process, as stated by the National Court of Justice [the
Cassation Court] in its ruling.

This Court, based on the considerations expounded thus far, must specify that the
appellant’s allegations concerning the performance of fraudulent acts on the part
of and attributable to its counterparty to these proceedings and the judicial
authorities involved in trying the case, are not grounds or reasons expressly
provided for in the Ecuadorian law as a valid foundation to argue and determine
the nullity of the proceedings; otherwise, as analyzed further below and pursuant
to the opinions of the National Court of Justice based on the appellant’s arguments,
the facts therein alleged would correspond to another type of conducts to be tried
by means of the corresponding proceedings, rather than as a ground for procedural
nullity. Therefore, as this is an appeal which is extremely formalistic and rigorous,
the Cassation Tribunal is called on to strictly observe the legal regulations
established in relation thereto, which in the case at hand have not been fulfilled,
hence, there has been no concurrence whatsoever of any essential elements
necessary for the judges of the National Court of Justice to find the appropriateness
of the charges alleged by the appellant as grounds for nullity of the proceedings
and for the very cassation appeal.

In this respect, it can be noticed that the performance of judges when rendering the
judgment subject to appeal is consistent with the nature of the cassation appeal and
with the rules governing such subject matter, otherwise, to admit, as sought by the
appellant, any argument as a ground for procedural nullity would confront us with
a legal system in want of certainty in the application of legal rules and, therefore,
inconsistent with the legal framework provided for by our Ecuadorian Constitution.

  

On the other hand, as previously stated, the judges of the Cassation Court sustain
within the decision subject to appeal that, should the procedural irregularities
alleged by Chevron exist, the Ecuadorian law has already established the
corresponding actions of administrative and criminal nature to punish such kind of

'60 ©.2551, pp. 75-77.

Part V — Page 61

5.189.

5.190.

conducts, notwithstanding the civil liabilities that may arise therefrom. The
Cassation Tribunal considers that the arguments expounded by Chevron make
reference to the commission of somehow collusive actions, a behavior for which,
the judges explain, there is a specific regulation in the Ecuadorian law [Footnote
27 refers to the Collusion Prosecution Act] : likewise, the judged sustain [sic:
“judgment?] that by means of the arguments posed by the company lodging this
cassation appeal, its counterparty’s lawyers, expert witnesses and trial court judges
are thereby being accused of having committed several crimes, an aspect which is
found as inadmissible by the national justices within the context of the cassation
appeal at hand. In furtherance of its stance, the appellant argues that the Cassation
Tribunal’s refusal to hear and remedy the procedural fraud it reported, constitutes
an infringement of its constitutional right subject matter of this legal issue, which,
in turn, has led Chevron to a status of deprivation of its right to judicial defense in
the proceedings pursued against it.

 

In this respect, this Court does hereby notice, in the first place, that the appellant’s
allegation in relation to the fact that the Cassation Tribunal refused to deal with
the procedural fraud reported by the company Chevron, lacks every single
foundation, since as stated and described in the foregoing paragraphs, the National
Court of Justice actually analyzes the arguments proposed by means of the
cassation appeal in relation to the performance of fraudulent acts within said
judicial proceedings; in spite of this, the fact that the judges know the parties’
allegations does not necessarily entail a favorable decision for either party’s
claims, as seems to be the appellant’s intention, when stating that the cassation
court judges infringe constitutional rights by not remedying the fraud reported by
the appellant.”
From these and other passages,'®! the Tribunal concludes that the Constitutional Court
both received and understood the factual allegations of procedural fraud made by
Chevron, including the ‘ghostwriting’ of the Lago Agrio Judgment; that these
allegations were materially the same as the Claimant’s factual allegations made by the
Claimants in this arbitration; and that the Constitutional Court decided that both the
Constitutional Court and the Cassation Court had no jurisdiction under Ecuadorian law
to determine the truth or effect of such allegations upon the status of the Lago Agrio
Judgment, including its enforceability and execution within and without Ecuador. (As
to the Constitutional Court’s reference to the Collusion Prosecution Act, the Tribunal

returns to this issue later below).

Under Chapter 3 of the Judgment, the Constitutional Court decides that the Cassation

Court’s Judgment did not infringe “the right to the due process of law as to the guarantee

5.191. The Constitutional Court concludes: !

“Ultimately, this Court does hereby notice a series of allegations related to the field
of evidence that, far from arguing a constitutional infringement, merely show a
dissatisfaction with the assessment made not only by the judicial authority
rendering the judgment under discussion herein, but also by the judges acting in
the civil lawsuit; a circumstance that, pursuant to the previous findings of this
Court, does not pertain to a constitutional sphere and as such, it should not be the
subject matter of analysis within the context of this petition.

Finally, it is necessary to point out that, once the arguments posed by the appellant
with its intention to clearly show that the procurement of evidence occurred in
violation of constitutional principles and rights have been analyzed, this Court has
not found a clear and well-founded argument that may make it possible to
acknowledge such kind of charges, a situation that, as expounded in the foregoing
paragraph, would indeed constitute an element to be analyzed by this Court. In this
line of thought, it is thus confirmed, based on the foregoing explanations, that the
appellant itself expects a decision of the Constitutional Court on some aspects that
are beyond the production and procurement of evidence referred to in Article 76,
paragraph 4 of the Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador.”

5.192. Under Chapter 4 of the Judgment, the Constitutional Court decides that the Cassation

5.193.

Court’s Judgment did not violate “the constitutional right to legal certainty in connection

with the alleged existence of res judicata.”

The Constitutional Court here considers Chevron’s submissions regarding the 1995
Settlement Agreement. It concludes that the 1995 Settlement Agreement does not
preclude the Lago Agrio Complaint because the Ecuadorian State, as a party to the 1995
Settlement Agreement, did not represent or bind the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs; and, since
the 1995 Settlement Agreement is deprived of res judicata effects, there is no
infringement of the constitutional law principle “non bis in idem” or double jeopardy.!*

The Tribunal returns below to this part of the Constitutional Court’s Judgment.

46 Article 76(4) of the Constitution provides: “In all proceedings determining rights and obligations of any kind,
the right to due process shall be ensured, and it will include the following basic guarantees: 4. Evidence obtained
or taken in violation of the Constitution or the law will have no legal validity and will lack probative value.”

Under Chapter 5 of the Judgment, the Constitutional Court decides that the Cassation
Court’s Judgment did not violate “the right to legal certainty contained in Article 82 of
the Constitution of the Republic, based on the retroactive application of the 1999

Environmental Management Act [the EMA]”.

The Constitutional Court here considers that, in view of the values advanced by the
substantive provisions of Ecuadorian law regarding the protection of the environment,
including provisions in the Civil Code pre-dating the commencement of activities by
Texaco and TexPet in Ecuador, there has not been any retrospective application of

Ecuadorian law in the Lago Agrio Litigation that violates constitutional Law.

The Constitutional Court concludes (with footnotes here omitted):'°

“Tt is possible, therefore, to assert that no one has the acquired right to pollute or
can claim the existence of a consolidated legal situation when his/her actions
damaged the environment and also when there are collective environmental
interests at stake. Under this logic, it is absolutely possible and sometimes
necessary to enforce the retroactive application of the environmental regulations
to the extent that it provides greater levels of protection.

In light of the foregoing, it is the understanding of this Court that the application
of the second paragraph of article 43 of the Environmental Management Act did
not represent a breach of the right to legal certainty, as it addressed the
constitutional principle of in dubio pro natura, which requires judges to apply the
rule most favorable to nature in cases in which there are doubts about the rules to
apply, and was able to protect the right to a healthy environment and nature in the
best possible way.”

From this and other passages, the Tribunal understands that the Constitutional Court is
again treating Chevron as TexPet. For example, in a preceding passage, the
Constitutional Court refers to “Chevron” refusing “to repair the damage”, namely
environmental damage caused by pollution incidents “throughout the entire time”, being

the term of TexPet’s Concession Agreements from 1964 to 1992.'%

Under Chapter 6 of the Judgment, the Constitutional Court decides that the Cassation

Court’s Judgment did not breach “the right to legal certainty contained in Article 82 of

65 C2251, p. 112.
66 C.2551, p.111.

the Constitution of the Republic due to the retroactive application of the objective

liability regime”.
5.199. The Constitutional Court concludes: !°”

“The objective liability regime, reversal of the burden of proof, the principle of
enforcing the rule most favorable to the protection of nature-related rights and the
non-applicability of statute of limitations to environmental rights, configure the
constitutional block to protect nature and these objectives were achieved with the
application of the regulations by trial court judges and by the National Court of
Justice, and this situation must be backed by this Constitutional Court.”

5.200. These rulings include the judgment of the former Supreme Court in the Delfina Torres

case (cited above).'®

5.201. Under Chapter 7 of the Judgment, the Constitutional Court decides that the Cassation
Court’s Judgment did not breach “the constitutional right to legal certainty in relation to

the principle of consistency of legal decisions.”
5.202. The Constitutional Court concludes: !°

“... it is apparent that an impact on the environment has a direct effect on the
culture of the indigenous communities that inhabit the area where pollution has
occurred, as in the specific case of the damages caused in the Amazon. In such a
way, having a redress mechanism that tends to remedy the cultural damage
produced by environmental pollution caused by the appellant company [sic:
Chevron] and as stated by the judge a quo, it is a complementary measure that
contributes to redress for damages caused to the flora and fauna of the territory,
which are fundamental elements for the development of life and cultural identity of
the indigenous population that lived in the concession area. Therefore, this Court
not only rejects the petitioner’s argument but also considers that the redress
ordered in the ruling to implement a community reconstruction and ethnic
reaffirmation program is proper and in no way constitutes a measure that the
plaintiffs did not request ...”

“Therefore, this Court determines that the contested judgment does not infringe on
the principle of non ultra petita applicable to judicial decisions, consequently, it
being established that there is no infringement of the right to legal certainty.”

5.203. Under Chapter 8 of the Judgment, the Constitutional Court decides that the Cassation

Court’s Judgment did not infringe “the right to due process provided for in Article 76,

Number 6 of the Constitution of the Republic’”.!7°

5.204. The Constitutional Court concludes: '7!

“\.. the principle of proportionality from the punitive sphere, as enunciated in the
Constitution of the Republic, must be observed from the perspective that any
imposition of excessive and unnecessary sanctions will also represent a restriction
or arbitrary deprivation of rights. Circumstance that, in turn, imposes on the
legislator the need to establish clear and tolerable limits for each sanction, since,
being clear from the aforementioned Constitutional text, it is through the law that
the proportionality between the infringement and the sanction will be guaranteed.

However, returning to the analysis of the arguments made by the plaintiff [sic: the
appellant, Chevron] in relation to the violation of the principle of proportionality,
it is necessary to refer to the fact that the compensation for damages ordered by the
judge of first instance and ratified by the appeal and cassation judges, irrespective
of its origin, is aimed at economic compensation to those affected by the harmful
consequences caused by the performance of a wilful act or malfeasance, in this
particular case, environmental pollution.

Therefore, it is evident that the compensation described as excessive and
disproportionate that were ordered in the environmental damages case against
Chevron, does not have a punitive nature, that is to say sanctioning, but rather a
compensatory nature, that is, redress for the damage caused, as has been noted
throughout this ruling and as described in the Environmental Management Act in
force on the date the claim was filed.

Therefore, it is clear that the principle of proportionality recognized in the
Constitution as a guarantee of due process, responds to the idea of controlling and
limiting the exercise of the punitive power the State has, avoiding the excessive use
of sanctions that entail a deprivation or restriction of rights in order to protect
valuable legal assets within society; circumstance not related to the case under
analysis, since it has been evidenced that we are facing an economic recovery of
the damage, but not before the application of a penalty that represses unlawful
conduct.”

' Article 76(6) of the Constitution provides, in material part: “In all proceedings determining the rights and
obligations of any kind, the right to due process shall be ensured, and it will include the following basic
guarantees: (6) the law shall establish the proper proportionality between violations and criminal, administrative
or other sanctions.”

5.205. Under Chapter 9 of the Judgment, the Constitutional Court decides that the Cassation
Court’s Judgment did not violate “the right to reasoning contained in Article 76, number

7(1) of the Constitution of the Republic”.!”*

5.206. The Constitutional Court listed Chevron’s criticisms of the Cassation Court’s reasoning,

as follows: !73

“[The Cassation Court] Justice refused to rule on elements such as procedural
fraud; the res judicata effect of the 1995 settlement agreement; violation of
procedural rules related to competition; judicial inspections; essential error; lack
of application of norms related to the assessment of evidence; violation of the
dispositive and congruence principles; retroactive application of substantive
aspects of the Environmental Management Act; illegal and untimely appointment
of the judges who heard the appeal; and lack of reasoning in the appeal decision.”

5.207. As regards Chevron’s allegations of procedural fraud, the Constitutional Court

concludes, approving the Cassation Court’s reasoning, as follows: !74

“Even if true, in the review of judgment, it can be seen that when the plaintiffs make
allegations regarding procedural fraud within the second clause of Article 3 of the
Cassation Act, the National Court of Justice provides a generic answer saying that
‘(...) never identified any law in such allegations, nor has it ever shown how this
affected the validity of these proceedings, and therefore such complaints amount to
vague allegations, with no legal foundation (...)’. However, further on, when
analyzing specific allegations about fraudulent actions of lawyers, the fact that the
judgment has not been drafted by the judge who heard the case; falsification of
Calmbacher’s expert report; and the lack of impartiality and independence of the
judges, the National Court of Justice makes three elements clear: 1) their lack of
competence within civil appeal cases to recognize unproven, fraudulent acts; 2) the
existence of specific procedural channels to prosecute reported fraudulent acts, and
3) the need for plaintiffs to present their accusations before the appropriate
authority.

 

In this sense, although there is no substantive ruling regarding alleged fraudulent
acts, that is regarding whether the fraudulent acts existed or not, the National Court
of Justice provides an answer based on the rules that regulate cassation appeals
and causes for invalidity, concluding that allegations of procedural fraud were not

' Article 76(7)(1) of the Constitution provides, in material part: “Jn all proceedings determining rights and
obligations of any kind, the right to due process shall be ensured, and it will include the following basic
guarantees: (7) Persons’ right to a defence shall include the following guarantees: (1) Decisions made by public
authorities must be reasoned. Reasoning will be lacking if the decision does not state the legal rules or principles
on which it is based and does not explain how they apply to the facts of the case. Administrative actions, decisions
or rulings that are not duly reasoned will be considered void. The responsible public servants shall be sanctioned.”

only raised erroneously, but also demanded analysis to be made outside of its actual
jurisdiction.”

As regards Chevron’s jurisdictional objection, the Constitutional Court concludes,

approving the reasoning of the Cassation Court, as follows:!7>

“The National Court of Justice gives the following premises: 1) Chevron waived
the jurisdiction of its domicile, and 2) Chevron submitted voluntarily to Ecuadorian
competence; these circumstances are contrasted with the relevant procedural rules
and the National Court of Justice arrives at the conclusion that, in effect, the judges
that knew the cause of the case, possessed the competence and applied procedural
rules adequately.

In terms of the legal problem regarding competence, this Court has undertaken an
analysis of the reasons that led the National Court of Justice to consider that the
procedural rules had been applied and to justify the competence of the national
judges in the case. From this analysis, the correct argumentation given by the
National Court of Justice is confirmed in greater detail. From the forgoing, it is
concluded that the judges of Cassation did indeed rule on the matter and did so in
a substantiated manner.”

The Constitutional Court also rejects Chevron’s other allegations that the Cassation
Court’s Judgment lacks reasons or are irrational, including denial of a procedural
opportunity to investigate essential mistakes in the expert evidence presented in the
Lago Agrio Litigation, illegal appointment of judges who decided the appeal against the
Lago Agrio Judgment, failure to apply norms concerning the evaluation of the evidence

and evaluation of the res judicata effects of the 1995 Settlement Agreement.

The Constitutional Court Judgment was issued after the Track IT Hearing, shortly before
the Tribunal was to issue its award under Track II. In the circumstances, the Parties
addressed the Tribunal on the effect of the Constitutional Court Judgment by their
respective written submissions by letters dated 25 July 2018, pursuant to the Tribunal’s

Agreed Procedural Order of 19 July 2018.

In the Claimants’ said submissions of 25 July 2018 (with footnotes here partly omitted),

the Claimants contend (inter alia) as follows:

(1) First, the Constitutional Court affirmed the Lago Agrio Judgment and failed to

mitigate the denial of justice that ripened years ago. To the extent that Chevron’s

"5 ©.2551, pp. 143 and 144,

Part V — Page 68

“Extraordinary Action of Protection” submitted to the Constitutional Court was a local

remedy, so the Claimants conclude, it has been exhausted by the Claimants.

(2) Second, the Constitutional Court refused to consider any of the evidence of fraud
presented by Chevron.!7° At the Track II Hearing, the Respondent quoted Article 94 of
the Ecuadorian Constitution: “An extraordinary action of protection is available against
judgments or final orders by which Constitutional rights were violated by action or
omission.”!”” Yet, according to the Constitutional Court, the Respondent’s Appellate
and Cassation Courts, seized with evidence that a party had bribed a first-instance judge
and ‘ghostwritten’ that judge’s judgment, are required to affirm that judgment; and that

such judicial misconduct does not violate the Ecuadorian Constitution.

Instead, so Chevron submits, the Constitutional Court fastened onto the Respondent’s
“post hoc contrivance” that a prosecution is required of Chevron under the Collusion
Prosecution Action (CPA).'78 The Claimants submit that this reasoning ignores the
“ultima ratio rule”; and that a CPA action could not suspend enforcement of the Lago
Agrio Judgment. The Claimants further submit that political reality in Ecuador means
that no Ecuadorian judge would rule in Chevron’s favour (as contended by the
Claimants in their closing oral submissions at the Track II Hearing).'”? In any event, as
Chevron concluded at the Track II Hearing: “If Ecuador is correct that its judicial system
is powerless to address fraud on direct appeal or even to stay enforcement during the
pendency of a CPA action, then its system falls below international standards.....”.'8°

(3) Third, as the Constitutional Court judgment records, an “Oversight” Council is
currently deciding whether to remove certain judges involved in the Lago Agrio
Litigation. '8! The Council’s chairperson filed an amicus brief before the Constitutional
Court demanding that the Constitutional Court reject Chevron’s action for protection.
Chevron requested the Constitutional Court to delay its ruling on that demand until the

judges’ conflict was resolved.'*? The Constitutional Court ignored Chevron’s request.

(4) Fourth, the Constitutional Court decided that the Lago Agrio Judgment is based
exclusively on the diffuse right to live in a clean environment: ‘the lawsuit [is] based on
the right...to live in a healthy environment, [which] is a constitutional and collective
right....’.!8? Moreover, the Constitutional Court expressly cited Article 19.2 of the

former Constitution (which recognized that right). '*+

According to the Claimants, the Constitutional Court relied on two erroneous reasons to
justify its disregard for the 1995 Settlement Agreement: (i) the 1995 Settlement
Agreement did not ‘refer’ to ‘third party’ rights; '*> whereas the Claimants submit that
this reasoning ignores the express statements in Articles 1.3, 5.1 and 5.2 of the 1995
Settlement Agreement that it releases claims based upon Article 19.2 of the

186 187,

Constitution;'*° and (ii) the State of Ecuador could not represent this diffuse right

whereas the Claimants submit that Article 19.2 expressly states that “‘it is the duty of the

State” to enforce this diffuse right.'**

(5) Lastly, so the Claimants submit, the Constitutional Court’s decision confirms that
the denial of justice in the present case far surpasses that which occurred in Loewen v
USA (2003).'*? At the Track II Hearing, in support of its submissions on the Claimants’
non-exhaustion of local remedies, the Respondent contended that Mr Loewen’s “mortal
sin” was failing to petition the US Supreme Court regarding the Mississippi
judgment.!°° In response, the Claimants compared two fact patterns in its closing oral
submissions at the Track II Hearing.'?!

In Loewen, so the Claimants submitted, the NAFTA tribunal found that an “outrage”
had been committed in the conduct of a trial by court in Mississippi. What should one
say if, instead, several appellate jurisdictions up to the US Supreme Court had applauded

and endorsed the Mississippi judgment, that prosecutors in the USA had blankly refused

to consider evidence of gross fraud, that the USA had indicated in formal submissions
in a treaty arbitration (such as this arbitration) that the remedy which Mr Loewen was
required to exhaust was available in a particular appellate court, that this appellate court
then denied having any authority to consider the matter, and that a US Federal Court
nevertheless endorsed the Mississippi judgment for enforcement abroad? The Claimants
conclude that such facts would be even more ‘outrageous’ than the Loewen case; but
that, today, those are the facts of the Respondent’s conduct regarding the Lago Agrio

Judgment.

In the Respondent’s said submissions of 25 July 2018 (with footnotes here partly

omitted), the Respondent contends:

(1) First, the Constitutional Court, as the highest Ecuadorian Court endowed with the
authority to interpret Ecuador’s Constitution, examined Chevron’s claims and, after a
thorough and well-reasoned analysis, concluded that the Appellate and Cassation Courts
reviewing the Lago Agrio Litigation did not violate any of Chevron’s constitutional
rights. Chevron’s claim that multiple Ecuadorian courts over the last decade were
engaged in an elaborate conspiracy with former President Correa against Chevron has
even less credibility, given that the Constitutional Court rendered its decision under a

new administration long at odds with the former President, no longer in office.

(2) Second, the Constitutional Court expressly found, like the Cassation (National)
Court, that consideration of Chevron’s extrinsic evidence of alleged fraud is precluded
under Ecuadorian law.'°? Rejecting Chevron’s claim that the Cassation Court should
have analysed “the whole of evidence produced in order to prove the commission of the
fraudulent acts”, the Constitutional Court repeatedly noted the limited scope of review
of the Cassation Court, adding that Chevron had available to it alternative avenues of
relief, including “a specific regulation in the Ecuadorian law” to redress “collusive
actions”, i.e., the Collusion Prosecution Act (CPA).'3 The Respondent submits that
Chevron cannot successfully prosecute its claims in this arbitration based upon the
Ecuadorian Courts’ alleged wrongdoings, whilst simultaneously ignoring the recourse

afforded to litigants to redress such alleged wrongdoing in Ecuador.

Part V — Page 71

5.213.

(3) Third, the Constitutional Court determined that Chevron’s right to legal certainty
was not infringed by the Ecuadorian Courts’ failure to accept its res judicata defence
(by which it claimed that the 1995 Settlement Agreement released it from liability for
violations to the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ constitutional right to live in a clean
environment). The Constitutional Court found res judicata inapplicable because,
whether the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ claims are collective or otherwise, there exists no
identity of parties or object.!°* The Constitutional Court instead quoted from and
reaffirmed the admonition in Article 2362 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code that: “[a]
settlement only affects the parties to it.”!°> Further, the Constitutional Court found that
the “substantive law” under which Chevron was tried was ‘tort law under the Civil
Code’.!°° Because the Civil Code long pre-dated the Environmental Management Act
(and the alleged introduction of collective rights in Ecuador), such Code provisions are

individual in nature, rendering res judicata inapplicable. !*”

(4) Fourth, Chevron has long sought to use this Tribunal as an appellate court by
challenging various judicial rulings regarding the application of Ecuadorian law. To the
extent the Constitutional Court examined some or all of these legal questions, the
Constitutional Court’s findings are dispositive. Its findings are reasonable and correct
as a matter of Ecuadorian law and well within the ambit of the “juridically possible”,

using the Claimants’ own terminology.'**

(5) Lastly, so the Respondent concludes, the Lago Agrio Litigation has always been
about far more than Mr Donziger. It is also about “the conduct of an oil company that
put profit over the environment, leaving indigenous residents with substantive claims
for real injuries.” The rule of law requires redress for these indigenous plaintiffs, not

overbroad protection for a multi-national giant well equipped to protect itself.

The Tribunal here addresses several particular features arising from the Judgment of the

Constitutional Court.

It is clear from the Constitutional Court’s Judgment, that the Constitutional Court was
fully appraised of Chevron’s allegations of procedural fraud in the Lago Agrio
Litigation and the ‘ghostwriting’ of the Lago Agrio Judgment. It is equally clear that the
Constitutional Court decided to leave these factual allegations unanswered, save to refer
to its own lack of jurisdiction both to address these allegations and, if proven, to redress

them (in addition to the same lack of jurisdiction in the Cassation Court).

The Constitutional Court decided that any alleged defects in the Lago Agrio Judgment,
including the procedural fraud alleged by Chevron, could not be reviewed or decided by
the Cassation Court or the Constitutional Court; the procedural laws governing their
respective functions do not vest these Courts with any authority either to investigate or
to redress such alleged defects; and, instead, Chevron’s allegations should be the subject
of criminal proceedings or proceedings under the Collusion Prosecution Act (CPA).
Therefore, so the Constitutional Court concluded, there was no basis under Ecuadorian
constitutional law for the Constitutional Court to decide that due process was violated

by the decision of the Cassation Court not to take action in regard to such allegations.

With the Constitutional Court’s Judgment, Chevron has no further appellate remedy
within the Ecuadorian judicial system. Its action for protection before the Constitutional
Court was its last possible opportunity to obtain judicial relief from the Ecuadorian
Courts within the Lago Agrio Litigation. Save for a possible claim under the Collusion
Prosecution Act (subject to a time-bar), Chevron has no judicial remedy under the
Ecuadorian legal system against the enforcement and execution of the Lago Agrio

Judgment under Ecuadorian law.

In several passages, the Constitutional Court emphasised the remedy available to
Chevron under the Collusion Prosecution Act. The first passage cites the submission

made by the Attorney General’s Office, representing the Respondent:

“Ecuador has made it clear that the courts that heard the Lago Agrio case declined
to hear those allegations because these courts do not have jurisdiction. There is an
appropriate and exclusive mechanism - the proceeding established by the Collusion
Prosecution Act—that Chevron should use, and it would allow the company to
submit its evidence and rebut the arguments of the accused.” '?

5.221.

The second passage accepts the submission made by the Attorney General’s Office:

“Tt is necessary to insist that the National Court of Justice has pronounced
decisions about the procedural fraud alleged by Chevron, thereby establishing its
lack of jurisdictional competence to determine the accuracy of the allegations posed
by the appellant on lodging its cassation appeal, as this is neither the corresponding
judicial stage nor the appropriate means to substantiate the criminal reports made
by the appellant; thus, the judges pointed out that if the appellant considers that
they were collusive actions or a commission of crimes, there exists the civil and
criminal procedure, respectively, in order to try any behaviors so deemed as
fraudulent. In this respect, this Court notices that the analysis conducted in the
decision subject to appeal [the Cassation Court’s Judgment] does not at all cause
the appellant to be deprived of its right of judicial defense, since the Cassation
Tribunal is not denying justice to the company lodging the cassation appeal, but
rather, it is resolving the case in accordance with the rules governing the cassation
appeal, thus leaving open the appellant’s possibility to pursue any relevant actions
intended for the facts being reported by means of the cassation appeal to be
punished by more appropriate means.”?°°

The third longer passage expands upon the Constitutional Court’s reasons regarding the
Collusion Prosecution Act. It has already been cited in full above under Chapter 2 of the

Constitutional Court’s Judgment.

It is clear from several passages in the Constitutional Court’s Judgment that the
Constitutional Court equated, as regards jurisdiction and liability, Chevron with TexPet
and Texaco notwithstanding their respective different legal personalities. This
determination approved the like decisions of the Cassation Court, the Lago Agrio
Appellate Court and the Lago Agrio Court based upon Chevron’s “merger” with Texaco
in 2001, as regards both jurisdiction and liability. It also accords with the last of the
submissions made by the Respondent in its letter of 25 July 2018, namely that the Lago
Agrio Litigation was about “the conduct of an oil company that put profit over the
environment” (cited above). That “oil company” is Chevron, even though Chevron was

not involved in any activity in Ecuador under TexPet’s concession.

Lastly, the Tribunal regrets its inability to follow the Constitutional Court’s
interpretation and application of the 1995 Settlement Agreement in regard to Chevron’s
liability under the Lago Agrio Judgment, as affirmed by the Lago Agrio Appellate Court

and (save as to punitive damages) the Cassation Court and the Constitutional Court.

In its Judgment, the Constitutional Court accepts the validity and effectiveness of the
1995 Settlement Agreement, as between (inter alios) TexPet, Texaco, Chevron and the
Respondent.””! The Constitutional Court also sets out the terms of Article 19.2 of the
1978 Constitution, being part of the release from liability expressly granted to Chevron
by the Respondent under Article 5 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement (as also expressly
set out).2”? In describing the environmental rights for which Chevon was adjudged liable
in the Lago Agrio Judgment (as also decided by the Lago Agrio Appellate and Cassation
Courts), the Constitutional Court uses synonymously the terms “diffuse right” and
“collective rights”; in the original Spanish text, respectively, “un derecho difuso” and
“Jos derechos colectivos.”?" It is clear that the Constitutional Court treats the rights of
the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs, as also decided by the Cassation, Lago Agrio Appellate and
Lago Agrio Courts, as constituting a diffuse right, in the words of the Constitutional

Court “a constitutional and collective right”.?°*

The Tribunal re-states the distinction, as set out in its First Partial Award dated 17
September 2013, between an individual claim for personal harm by a Lago Agrio
Plaintiff (not being a diffuse claim) and a diffuse (or collective) claim. The former is
not affected by the 1995 Settlement Agreement; but the 1995 Settlement Agreement
precludes the latter, expressly so in regard to Article 19.2 of the 1978 Constitution.
Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the Constitutional Court’s interpretation of
Article 5 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement deprives that settlement of any practical
meaning, making it a one-sided and open-ended commitment undertaken unilaterally by
TexPet and Texaco, which (as decided by all four Ecuadorian Courts) Chevron inherited
based upon its “merger” between Chevron and Texaco. The Tribunal re-states its

reasons for its conclusion as also set out in its First Partial Award.

In the circumstances, on the basis of the submissions and expert evidence on Ecuadorian
law adduced before the Tribunal in this arbitration, the Tribunal is driven to conclude,
as regards the interpretation and application of the 1995 Settlement Agreement to the
Lago Agrio Judgment, that the decision of the Constitutional Court is inconsistent with

the effect that the Treaty requires to be given to the 1995 Settlement Agreement.

P: The Tribunal’s Conclusions

The Tribunal finds proven, on the evidence adduced in this arbitration, the following
facts based on the factual and non-forensic expert evidence set out above, in Parts IV
and V of this Award. (For ease of reference, these factual and non-forensic expert issues

are referred to as “factual issues”).

The Ghostwriting’ of the Lago Agrio Judgment: The Claimants’ factual allegation that
the Judgment of the Lago Agrio Court was corruptly ‘ghostwritten’ lies at the heart of
their present dispute with the Respondent. It is by far their gravest allegation in this case;
and, if attributable to the Respondent, it is the origin of the injuries of which the

Claimants now complain under the Treaty.

There is no direct factual evidence available in this arbitration proving definitively how
and when the Lago Agrio Judgment was in fact written. There is, however, much
circumstantial evidence, both factual and non-forensic expert evidence. Subject to the
forensic issues considered in the next Part VI of this Award, that circumstantial
evidence, in the Tribunal’s view, proves by whom it was not written and why and by

whom it was written, at least in substantial and material part.

As already indicated, the Tribunal declines to draw any adverse inference against the
Respondent from the absence of Dr Zambrano as a witness in this arbitration. First, the
Tribunal does not accept that Dr Zambrano’s absence was improperly induced or
otherwise influenced by the Respondent. Second, the Tribunal has benefited from the
written testimony of Dr Zambrano in the RICO Litigation, which the Respondent (with
the Claimants) agreed could be received by the Tribunal as if it were testimony adduced
in this arbitration. On the other hand, whilst drawing no such adverse inference, the
Tribunal confers no special advantage upon the Respondent arising from Dr Zambrano’s
absence as a witness in this arbitration. Whilst it thus rejects the Claimants’ criticism of
the Respondent for the missing piece of the jigsaw, it must nevertheless assess the
Respondent’s case (as also the Claimants’ case) without that missing piece, mitigated

by Dr Zambrano’s testimony in the RICO Litigation.

This assessment starts with certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives,
especially Mr Donziger and Mr Fajardo. The evidence before this Tribunal points

clearly to the conclusion that they engaged in prolonged, malign conduct towards the

Part V — Page 76

5.230.

5.231.

5.232.

Respondent’s legal system generally and, particularly, the Lago Agrio Court in a manner
that almost beggars belief in its arrogant contempt for elemental principles of truth and
justice. It is pointless here to characterise such conduct any further, because these
individuals are not the object of the exercise required for this Award under the Treaty
applying international law. Such conduct, as related above, also speaks for itself.
Moreover, others unknown were also involved in the ‘ghostwriting’ exercise. Whilst not
attributable to the Respondent under international law, their collective misconduct
nevertheless remains relevant because it was a necessary condition for what happened;

but it was not the immediate cause of the Claimants’ injuries.

That cause came from Judge Zambrano. The Tribunal considers that Judge Zambrano
actively solicited a bribe from whichever side in the Lago Agrio Litigation would be
willing to pay him for issuing a favourable judgment in the Lago Agrio Litigation.
Chevron refused his approaches; but certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives
did not. It is not proven that Judge Zambrano did receive a monetary consideration
actually paid to him before the issuance of the Lago Agrio Judgment. On a balance of
probabilities, however, it is proven that the consideration was a promise to reward him
financially at a later date from proceeds to be recovered from the enforcement against

Chevron of the Lago Agrio Judgment. It is likely to be a reward that he will never see.

Based on the circumstantial evidence, the Tribunal finds that Judge Zambrano did not
draft the entirety of the Lago Agrio Judgment by himself, as he falsely testified on oath
in the RICO Litigation. The Tribunal finds that Judge Zambrano, in return for his
promised reward, allowed certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives,
corruptly, to ‘ghostwrite’ at least material parts of the Lago Agrio Judgment (with its

Clarification). These representatives included Mr Fajardo and Mr Donziger.

Exactly how that was done remains uncertain on the available factual evidence. It is
clear that the ‘ghostwriting’ exercise was begun by these Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’
representatives in about mid-2009; and it was well underway by the time of Judge
Zambrano’s return to the Lago Agrio Litigation in October 2010. For obvious reasons,
Judge Zambrano was cautious; and these representatives were still more careful (albeit
not careful enough). By that time, Chevron had formed strong suspicions as to what
might be happening, even if Chevron could not prove it. That situation began to change

when Dr Guerra disclosed what he knew to Chevron, later. However, Dr Guerra was

5.237.

largely excluded from this ‘ghostwriting’ exercise at the time; and his knowledge is

limited.

Other Allegations: The Tribunal turns to the Claimants’ other factual allegations under
seven headings: (i) the misconduct of Judge Yanez; (ii) the misconduct of Mr Cabrera,
as an auxiliary officer of the Lago Agrio Court; (iii) Judge Zambrano’s improper
connivance at Dr Guerra’s ghostwriting of his court orders in the Lago Agrio Litigation
(between October 2009 and March 2010); (iv) the Veiga-Pérez Criminal Prosecutions;
(v) the conduct of the Respondent’s Government during the Lago Agrio Litigation; (vi)
criminal investigations of ‘fraud’ in the Lago Agrio Litigation and the Lago Agrio
Court’s Judgment (comprising of the misconduct of Judge Yanez and Mr Cabrera and
the ‘ghostwriting’ of the Lago Agrio Judgment); and (vii) the Judgments of the Lago
Agrio Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts in regard to ‘fraud’. It is

convenient to address these seven headings in reverse order.

The Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts: As to (vii), as a factual matter, the
Lago Agrio Appellate Court, the Cassation Court and the Constitutional Court did not
address in any significant manner the allegations made by Chevron of ‘fraud’ in the
Lago Agrio Litigation and the Lago Agrio Court Judgment, in their respective
Judgments of 3 January 2012 (with its Clarification Order of 13 January 2012), 12
November 2013 and 27 June 2018.

Criminal Investigations: As to (vi), as a factual matter, notwithstanding the existence of
at least prima facie evidence of ‘fraud’ in the Lago Agrio Litigation and the Lago Agrio
Court’s Judgment available to them, the Respondent’s prosecutorial authorities were
unwilling or unable to act in regard to such evidence in any significant and timely
manner, before the Judgment of the Lago Agrio Court was declared enforceable by the

Lago Agrio Appellate Court on 1 March 2012.

The Government’s Conduct: As to (v), the Tribunal does not consider proven the
Claimants’ factual allegation that the Respondent’s Government played any material

part in the Lago Agrio Judgment’s ‘ghostwriting’ exercise.

Moreover, at the Track II Hearing, Dr Guerra testified to his knowledge that the
Government never sought to intervene or influence the judicial process in the Lago

Agrio Litigation; and that “the administration never butted in” as regards the Lago Agrio

Part V — Page 78

Litigation.”°> The Tribunal accepts the truth of his testimony. It is also consistent with
the tactics adopted by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives themselves: see Mr
Prieto’s cautionary advice by his email message of 14 January 2009, recited in Part IV
above. Moreover, with the covert ‘ghostwriting’ exercise in place, these representatives
did not need any intervention from the Government. It is also consistent with the
evidence that Judge Zambrano solicited a bribe from Chevron in return for issuing a
judgment adverse to the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs (which Chevron rejected). That

solicitation was not the result of any intervention by the Government.

As regards other conduct by the Government, subject to (iv) below, it was inevitable
that the Lago Agrio Litigation should arouse strong political, if not populist, passions at
the highest level in Ecuador. Oil pollution and international oil companies often do.
Hostile statements by politicians, practising domestic politics, do not necessarily
amount to international wrongs. In this case, the Tribunal also bears in mind that the
Aguinda and Lago Agrio Plaintiffs were all nationals of the Respondent; and, further,
that the Aguinda and Lago Agrio Litigation gave rise to legal proceedings in the USA
in which the Respondent was a party or putative intervener sharing, at times, an over-
lapping interest with its nationals. As such, a level of co-operation between them cannot
be interpreted as improper collusion. Nor can it all be laid at the door of President
Correa: such co-operation began before he first assumed office as President in January

2007.

The Veiga-Pérez Criminal Prosecutions: As to (iv), the Respondent’s prosecutorial
authorities actively co-operated with certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’
representatives in conducting criminal investigations and initiating criminal
prosecutions against (inter alios) Mr Veiga and Dr Pérez as representatives of TexPet,
for the purpose of disadvantaging Chevron’s defence in the Lago Agrio Litigation based
on the 1995 Settlement Agreement. These intermittent investigations and prosecutions
from 2003 to 2011 were accompanied by vicious and unwarranted statements directed
against each of them personally by senior members of the Government, including (from

2007) President Correa.

5.244.

As already noted in Part IV, on | June 2011, these prosecutions were eventually
discontinued by the Respondent’s National Court, ostensibly without interference by the
Respondent’s Government. By that date, the Lago Agrio Judgment had been issued in

favour of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs notwithstanding the 1995 Settlement Agreement.

The Tribunal does not consider proven that these criminal investigations or prosecutions
had any causative link with the conduct of the Lago Agrio Litigation or the
‘ghostwriting’ of the Lago Agrio Judgment by certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’
representatives. Indeed, after bribing Judge Zambrano, these representatives no longer
needed to impugn the 1995 Settlement Agreement (with its related agreements) by

means of these collusive criminal prosecutions.

Dr Guerra’s Ghostwriting of Judge Zambrano’s Court Orders: As to (iii), during Judge
Zambrano’s first period as the judge presiding over the Lago Agrio Litigation (October
2009 to March 2010), certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives corruptly paid
Dr Guerra to ‘ghostwrite’ seven procedural orders for Judge Zambrano in the Lago
Agrio Litigation, pursuant to which Judge Zambrano, knowing of such ‘ghostwriting’

by Dr Guerra, improperly issued such orders in the Lago Agrio Litigation.

That misconduct is primarily to be attributed to these representatives and to Dr Guerra
(who was then no longer a judge) and not thereby to the Respondent. There is no cogent
evidence that any part of the bribes paid by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives
for such orders was transmitted by Dr Guerra to Judge Zambrano. At the time, Judge
Zambrano most probably knew of the payments to Dr Guerra. He could not have
expected Dr Guerra to work for him pro bono. Judge Zambrano also knew that his
delegating the drafting of procedural orders to Dr Guerra was illegal under Ecuadorian

law.

However, such misconduct by Dr Guerra took place at an earlier time than the
‘ghostwriting’ of the Lago Agrio Judgment during Judge Zambrano’s return to the Lago
Agrio Litigation (October 2010 - March 2011). This later ‘ghostwriting’ exercise was
of a different and much greater order of misconduct by Judge Zambrano, and as the
action of a judge within the scope of his professional duties it was plainly conduct
attributable to the Respondent. It subsumed any earlier, lesser misconduct by Judge

Zambrano. Whilst it is possible, or even likely, that the earlier misconduct by both Dr

5.246.

5.247.

5.248.

5.249.

5.250.

Guerra and Judge Zambrano formed a necessary condition for the subsequent

‘ghostwriting’ exercise by Judge Zambrano, it was not its cause.

Mr Cabrera: As to (ii), Mr Cabrera, as an auxiliary officer of the Lago Agrio Court, (a)
improperly favoured the case of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs in the Lago Agrio Litigation
and (b) improperly colluded with and permitted certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’
representatives and experts to write, covertly, the Cabrera Report, ostensibly in his
name. Mr Cabrera, mendaciously, failed to act as an independent expert to the Lago
Agrio Court, in violation of his oath to so. His misconduct resulted from the bribes
corruptly paid to him by certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives between

mid-2007 to mid-2008.

As a factual matter, Mr Cabrera’s improper conduct severely prejudiced the presentation

of Chevron’s case in the Lago Agrio Litigation.

Again, whilst it is possible, or even likely, that this earlier misconduct formed a
necessary condition for the subsequent ‘ghostwriting’ of the Lago Agrio Judgment, it
was not its cause. To the extent (as the Tribunal finds) that the Cabrera Report influenced
in part the result of the Lago Agrio Judgment, the Tribunal considers that this factor

forms part of the ‘ghostwriting’ exercise as a whole.

Judge Yanez: As to (i), Judge Yanez (a) improperly terminated the procedure for the
Judicial Inspections in the Lago Agrio Litigation, by order of the Lago Agrio Court
dated 22 August 2006; and (b) improperly appointed Mr Cabrera as the Court’s sole
global assessment expert, by order of the Lago Agrio Court dated 19 March 2007. His
misconduct resulted from the blackmail practised against him by certain of the Lago

Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives from July 2006 onwards.

As a factual matter, the misconduct of Judge Yanez severely prejudiced the presentation
of Chevron’s case in the Lago Agrio Litigation. Although it was a necessary condition
for what happened subsequently in the Lago Agrio Litigation, his misconduct was not

the cause of the ‘ghostwriting’ of the Lago Agrio Judgment.

These conclusions are limited to the principal facts at issue between the Parties relevant

to this Award. They remain subject to the Tribunal’s consideration of the forensic issues

considered in the next Part VI of this Award, as also to the other factual and legal issues

considered in Parts VII and VIII of this Award.

PART V- ANNEX 7

THE LAGO AGRIO JUDGMENT ON “MERGER”
(pp. 6-26, with line numbers here added)

The complaint states that Chevron is the successor of Texaco, while the defendant
denies this assertion, therefore, since I must rule in this respect, according to the
record, one can see that the strict legal sense, that is, understanding succession as a
method to acquire control by which the rights and obligations are transferred from the
originator to its successors (according to the Roman tradition), the assertion that
Chevron is not the successor of Texaco Inc. is correct, in so far as the record shows
duly certified documentary evidence that demonstrates that Texaco Inc. maintains legal
status and consequently legal life (at pages 222 and 223 the original document in
English can be found, translated on pages 224 and 225), in such a way that it becomes
evident that there cannot be succession mortis causa without an originator. This
Presidency begins the analysis considering the explanation of the defendant in the
conciliation hearing, referring to there not being a merger between Texaco and
Chevron, but rather, as they proved with the certificate that lies at pages 230 and 231
(translation at page 225), the merger actually occurred between Texaco Inc. and
Keepep Inc. However, this reality, evidenced by documents, must be analyzed in light
of the entire body of evidence, therefore various aspects are considered, among which
it convenient first to refer to page 4103 where a certification is found, from October
29, 2003, at 11:18 a.m., issued by the Clerk of the Presidency, which states that the
defendant did not appear for the presentation of various documents related precisely
to this topic, which was timely requested by the plaintiffs in a motion filed October 23,
2003 at 3:25 a.m., and ordered in the ruling of October 23, 2003 at 3:30 p.m. The
documents that to the defendant should have presented included: 1) A complete and
certified copy of the ‘Agreement and Plan of Merger,’ which is said to be related to the
‘Certificate of Merger between Keepep Inc. and Texaco Inc.,’ a document with the
issuance date of October 9, 2001; 2) A complete and certified copy of the document
containing the authorization of Chevron Corporation, in order for its subsidiary
Keepep Inc. to participate in the Merger; 3) A complete and certified copy of the
authorization from the competent corporate body to proceed with the change in name
of Chevron Corporation to Chevron Texaco Corporation; 4) A complete and certified
copy of the authorization issued by the competent corporate body, for Chevron to be
able to include the word Texaco in its new name. These documents, which the defendant
did not present, despite having been timely requested to do so by the plaintiff and
ordered by the Presidency of this Court, were not filed by the defendant. As the record
shows the defendant explained the reasons that support a supposed inability to produce
said documents, via a brief on October 27, 2003, at 4:50 p.m., which was addressed
through a ruling on October 27, 2003 at 5:20 p.m., ordering compliance with what was
ordered or that the excuse be given on the indicated date. As was noted, the explanation
recorded by the Office of the Clerk clearly indicates that the defendant did not appear
on the indicated date and time, therefore did not offer a valid excuse for this failure to

comply. Considering Art. 826 of the Code of Civil Procedure with respect to the merit
of the presentation of documents requested as evidence, and given that this Presidency
should only consider the elements that form part of the proceeding, I consider that the
refusal to comply with the ordered presentation of documents cannot favor the party in
contempt, but rather to the contrary, the Code of Civil Procedure has established a
sanction for these cases, in Art. 827, which says, ‘If once ordered the presentation of
evidence is not fulfilled within the term indicated, a fine will be imposed on the
reluctant party of ten to forty United States dollars for each day of delay, depending
upon the amount in dispute. This fine may not exceed the value equivalent to ninety
days,’ therefore in this case, due to the time elapsed, the maximum fine must be applied,
equivalent to 40 dollars per day multiplied by the 90 days, for each document that has
not been produced as was ordered. The same thing happened with the documents whose
production was requested in the motion filed on October 24, 2003 at 4:59 p.m., that
refers to ‘Chevron Texaco Notice of the 2002 Annual Meeting and the 2002 Proxy
Statement,’ and to ‘Chevron Texaco Notice of the 2003 Annual Meeting and the 2003
Proxy Statement,’ and also by motion filed on October 24, 2003 at 5:00 p.m., in which
it is requested that a date and time be scheduled for the defendant company to produce
the following documents: ‘a.- Complete and certified copy of the ‘Agreement and Plan
of Merger’ between Chevron Corporation and Texaco Inc., b.- Complete and certified
copy of the records of the competent body , among which appear the authorization for
the institution called ‘merger,’ in the legislation of the state of Delaware, of the United
States of North America, to proceed between the companies Chevron Corporation and
Texaco Inc.; c.- Certificate of Merger between Texaco Inc. and Chevron Corporation;
d.- Authorization of the competent body that permits Chevron Texaco Corporation to
establish, in the legal documents ‘Chevron Texaco Notice of the 2002 Annual Meeting
and the 2002 Proxy Statement and Chevron Texaco Notice of the 2003 Annual Meeting
and the 2003 Proxy Statement,’ that the legal concept called ‘Merger’ has occurred
between the companies Texaco Inc. and Chevron Corporation,’ which motions were
addressed in the ruling of October 27, 2003 at 8:40 a.m., in which the requested
production was scheduled for November 4, 2003, without there being a record in the
proceedings of the compliance with this order. Moreover, this situation has been
considered together with the other record evidence, which indicates to us that both the
representatives of Chevron and those of Texaco each made public statements, in
different media and by different spokespersons, announcing a financial operation that
would combine the strengths of two companies to form a new one that would benefit
from this union. The case file contains important documentary evidence as of page
140700, in the notarial record made on June 6, 2008 of the true copy of the following
documents: 1. Chevron Document: Power — Point slides ‘Analysis of Meeting Notice;’

Federal Trade Commission consent agreement allows the merger of Chevron S.A. and
Texaco Corp., preserves market competition; 12. Analysis of the proposed merger
order to aid public comment; and 13. Agreement containing consent orders, with its
respective translation, and additional documents. Considering that these documents
were publicly available, specifically the official page of Chevron, the defendant
corporation (www.chevron.com), it follows that their content be analyzed in the
following manner. In general, all of these documents refer to or announce a financial
transaction called ‘merger’ in the English language, which is the language in which
these documents appear. Taking into account the translation from the Spanish and
English Legal Dictionary Diccionario Juridico Inglés-Espafiol by Henry Saint Dahl,
McGraw-Hill’s publishing company, and additionally the translations in the record,
the unmistakable conviction is reached that the English language term ‘merger’
translates to Spanish as ‘fusion.’ Likewise, the translation submitted to the Presidency
of the Court inside the same notarial record, done by Mr Mauricio Javier Rodriguez
Sandoval, as of page 140746, invariably translates the English term ‘merger’ with the
Spanish word ‘fusién.’ With respect to what a merger is, the Law of Companies (Ley
de Compajitas) dedicates a complete section, in which it explains the concept of
merger, indicating that this occurs: a) when two or more companies unite to form a
new one that succeeds them in their rights and obligations; and, b) when one or more
companies are absorbed by another that continues existing (art. 337), for which reason
it is appropriate to analyze the underlying legal transaction that occurred between
Chevron and Texaco Inc., to determine if art. 337 of the Law of Companies is
applicable to it. Under this legal approach all of the documentation has been analyzed
related to the transcript of the presentation made at the Chevron-Texaco merger
Analysts meeting held on October 16, 2000, at which Chevron’s General Manager,
David O'Reilly, makes the following statements: ‘First of all we’ll talk about the
strategic rationale for combining Chevron and Texaco to form this new company,
ChevronTexaco Corporation’ (page 140747), then goes on to say ‘The capabilities of
the new company will be made stronger by the combination of the skills and talents of
both organizations,’ and that ‘We’ll have a larger and stronger portfolio which will
enable Chevron and Texaco to better manage and absorb risk’ (page 140748). The
Presidency carefully observes the fact that Chevron’s General Manager emphasizes
the idea of ‘combining’ Chevron and Texaco so that the new company can benefit from
this combination of the skills and talents of both, which makes it evident that the new
company acquired benefits of the combined companies. It is noteworthy that, although
there is no express mention of obligations, the advantage of ‘better manage and absorb
risk’ is analyzed. The Presidency cannot disregard the fact that in slide 13 of the
presentation (page 140750) the benefits of the merger with respect to Latin America
are discussed, describing how the new company will benefit from the rights that the
combined companies have in South American countries; nevertheless, despite the fact
that no mention is made of the obligations of these companies in those countries, due
to an elemental principle of law we understand that the net assets are united as a whole,
made up of assets and liabilities, and therefore in terms of the law, it is understood that
be the underlying financial legal transaction what it may, or however the companies
want to call it or conceal it, what causes legal effects is the true transaction. This
Presidency is convinced that the net assets must be combined as a whole and not just

the rights alone, that is to say, the obligations are also combined. We understand that
the Managers of both companies publicly announced a merger, and that the legal
effects of such operation necessarily entail that the new ‘combined’ company succeeds
its creators in rights and obligations, in accordance with what art. 337 of the Law of
Companies has provided in this regard, and art. 338 which provides that the respective
corporate assets shall be transferred ‘in a block,’ that is to say, that the full net assets
are transferred, assets and liabilities, rights and obligations, without benefit of
inventory or any other limit, as is explained with total clarity in the second paragraph
of art. 341, which provides that ‘the absorbing company shall take care of paying the
liability of the absorbed and shall assume, by virtue thereof, the responsibilities
inherent to a liquidator with respect to the creditors of the latter;’ therefore, the
defendant’s statement that ‘the claimed automatic transfer To Chevron Texaco
Corporation of any obligations TEXACO INC. may have had lacks legal basis’ (page
244) has no legal merit at all, since the transfer is not ‘automatic,’ but rather it finds
its cause in the legal transaction that has been called merger in English, and that
combined the net assets of both companies. In addition, the various press releases
issued by Chevron Corporation have been analyzed, which were published on the
official web page of the same Corporation and are certified in the case file with their
respective translation in the Notarial Record that we are now examining, in which there
appear several statements by Chevron’s General Manager, expressly affirming that ‘
this merger positions ChevronTexaco as a much stronger global energy producer,’ and
that it ‘will create greater value for the shareholders of both companies’ (page 140759,
reverse). The General Manager of ChevronTexaco, on October 10, 2001, also
announced that with the new company ‘we have a broader mix of high-quality assets,
businesses, skills and technology, thanks to the merger’ (page 140768), which
corroborates that the new company, ChevronTexaco Corporation, now called only
Chevron Corporation acquired benefits (assets, businesses, skills and technology) from
the combination of the two combined companies Texaco and Chevron. This coincides
with that said by the President and General Manager of Texaco, Glenn F. Tilton, who
said that ‘the new ChevronTexaco will bring together two great companies,’ as well as
that, he looks forward ‘to completing the merger and creating a great new energy
company’ (page 140766). Per the principle of good faith, any citizen, Ecuadorian or
North American, who heard the public statements made by the companies Chevron and
Texaco would have come inevitably to the conviction of a merger between them. This
same conviction appears to be the one that motivated such that the plaintiffs initiated
their action against the new company resulting from the combination of the other two,
since this conclusion is the result of having trusted the information that both companies
issued publicly through their representatives and official channels. On the official page
of the Company Chevron, www.chevron.com, on October 9, 2001, the defendant
company made the following public announcement: ‘Chevron Texaco Corporation
announces completion of merger’ (page 140767, reverse). This clear and express Said
announcement, clear and express, leaves no room for confusion, and in any case is
presumed truthful for the principle of good faith, but if it turned out that the public
statements by the Presidents and General Managers of both companies are made with
the intention of creating a false impression of reality, then we could qualify these
statements as malicious, and under basic principle of law the author or authors cannot

benefit from such malice, in accordance with the provisions of subsection 2 or art. 17
of the Law of Companies, which provides that ‘For acts of fraud, abuse or other
improper conduct committed on behalf of companies and other individuals or legal
entities, the following shall be held solidarily liable: 1. Those who order or carry them
out, without prejudice to the responsibility that may affect such persons. 2. Those who
obtained benefit to the extent of its value. 3. The holders of the properties for the
purpose of their restitution,’ such that in this case, in which the actions and

ments of the s} persons and repres ives of both companies created a
false impression of reality, the companies that participated in this financial operation
and that seek to benefit from the false information they disseminated are solidarily
liable. In addition, to issue this ruling, I consider the statements of Dr Ricardo Reis
Veiga, who gave his version of the facts (page 103.460) during the judicial inspection
of well Guanta 7, in which he states: ‘I am Vice President of Texaco Petroleum
Company, professionally I am an attorney, I am responsible for all corporate legal
matters in Latin America,’ and also adds, ‘Yes, I do have a relationship with Chevron,
of course I have a relationship with Chevron, but I did not have a relationship with
Chevron at that time because the truth is that it had not merged (...),’ making clear the
position he holds within the company Texaco, and also clarifying that he maintains
‘relations’ with Chevron, but that these relations are subsequent to the merger, which
is inferred when he states ‘because the truth is that it had not merged,’ revealing the
certain fact that the author of this testimony has the internal conviction of the existence
of the merger as a consummated, past and objective fact. Also considered is the
existence in the case file of various checks (pages 103221, 104241, 101884, 69483,
among others) that have been signed by Dr Rodrigo Pérez Pallarez, legal
representative of the company Texaco in Ecuador, to satisfy the obligations that the
defendant party, Chevron Corporation, has had to pay as part of the expenses
generated by this lawsuit. This subrogation of Texaco, who is not a party in this lawsuit,
to satisfy the obligations contracted by Chevron Corporation, necessarily denotes at
least a proprietary/patrimonial relationship between the two companies, since between
distinct, independent companies there would be no legal cause for one company to
assume the legal expenses of the other. All these public statements and procedural acts
carried out by spokespersons and representatives of both companies (Chevron Corp.
and Texaco Inc.) lead to the unequivocal conclusion that the combination of their net
assets and personalities is a legal reality, as well as a public and well-known fact. As
provided by the principle of procedural truth established in art. 27 of the OCJB, this
Presidency, as the competent Judge, does not require further proof of the merger
between Chevron and Texaco, given that it has been shown to be common knowledge
based on the evidence added to the procedural index. One cannot fail to observe the
manifest reality, that neither Chevron Corp. nor Texaco Inc., nor their spokespersons
or representatives, in any of their frequent press releases, has ever denied publicly the
existence of the merger (while they did deny, debate and denounce publicly other facts,
through paid announcements in the press media), but rather all the contrary, this
litigation being the only known scenario in which Chevron Corp. debates the existence
of the merger with Texaco Inc., for which it is appropriate to recall that in our legal
system the principle prevails that no one can benefit from his bad faith, which would
be the case of making several false public announcements to transmit a distorted idea

of the reality and to profit from the error induced, such as, for example, if said
manoeuvre is undertaken for the purpose of evading legal obligations with third parties
The fact that the shareholders of the predecessor companies are the same ones who
control the new company, leaving as the result of said merger that the shareholders of
Chevron are owners of ‘approximately 61% of the new merged company, while the
Texaco shareholders would own approximately 39% of it’ (page 140770); and
moreover that the executives in charge of the new company are the same ones who
managed the combined companies, (140759, 140761, 140768), as occurs in this case,
leads one to think that there is not sufficient separation between the ownership and
control of the new company and its predecessors. One considers that if the shareholder
of Texaco Inc., became the shareholders of Chevron, and consequently benefited from
the new company (same as its executives), the obligations that the latter maintained as
shareholders of Texaco Inc. transferred as well to the new company, Chevron Corp.
The law serves justice, and cannot allow legal institutions to be manipulated for
illegitimate purposes, such as to favor a fraud or to promote injustice, which would be
the case of transferring the assets to one Corporation ‘free of responsibility,’ while the
responsibilities are kept in a company ‘free of assets,’ the way the defendant tries to
have us understand the transaction that took place between Chevron and Texaco, in
which the new company benefits from the combined companies, but fails to mention the
obligations. As the First Civil and Commercial Chamber of the Former Supreme Court
of Justice tells us, ‘in foreign legal treatises and case law, the need is increasingly
gaining ground to lift the veil of legal entities, particularly of corporations [sociedades
anonimas]. The unveiling consists in disregarding the external form of the legal entity
and, giving birth from there, penetrating in the interior of the same and examining the
real interests that live inside it,’ (Gaceta Judicial, Year CV, Series XVIII, No. 1, Page
79, Quito, July 23, 2004, Published in file 172, Registro Oficial 553, March 29, 2005).
In cases like this one, that fit the case where the new corporate structure could provoke
a fraud on third parties or a similar injustice, North American jurisprudence teaches
us that the doctrine of lifting the corporate veil must especially be asserted. The same
thing happens in Ecuadorian jurisprudence, where developments have been such, that
it has been possible to synthesize a series of basic postulates that contain, at the same
time, both a definition and an identification of the scope of action of the institution of
veil lifting in Ecuador. In the first place, it is vitally important to highlight that the
institution of veil lifting is strictly exceptional in nature, since the important social role
that is played by a clear separation of the equity of legal entities and their owners is
undeniable (as set forth in the Ruling of the First Civil and Commercial Chamber of
the Supreme Court of Justice, File No. 393, issued on July 8, 1999 at 9:00 a.m.,
Registro Oficial No. 273 of September 9, 1999). In the second place, there is the
obvious reality that the existence of the corporate entity has lent itself in the past to a
series of abuses, being used not for the purposes provided for in the Law, but rather to
affect rights of third parties through, becoming in practice like a tool of fraud. It is in
this event that the Judges must pull open the corporate curtain of legal entities, in order
to observe and analyze the reality of things beyond the appearances (see ruling of the
First Civil and Commercial Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, File No. 120,
handed down on March 21, 2001 at 11:15 a.m., Registro Oficial No. 350 of June 19,
2001). In the third place, at the time of analyzing abuses of the corporate entity, it is

not relevant if it was organized with the clear intention of causing a fraud or a harm.
It is sufficient that said fraud or harm exists in order to justify a lifting of the veil (see
Ruling of the First Civil and Commercial Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice,
File No. 393, handed down on July 8, 1999 at 9:00 a.m., Registro Oficial No. 273 of
September 9, 1999). Finally, it is essential to highlight that lifting the corporate veil of
a company is not simply a power of the court when faced with abuses of the corporate
form. On the contrary, the application of this institution constitutes a true obligation
of the judge, since that is the only, or at least the most effective, remedy for unmasking
these abuses of the legal entity (see Judgment of the First Civil and Commercial
Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, File No. 20, issued on January 28, 2003 at
11:00 a.m., Registro Oficial No. 58 of April 9, 2003). For these reasons, the fact that
the procedural index demonstrate the legal existence of Texaco and the merger of the
latter with Keepep, does not contradict the demonstrated, public and well-known fact
that the new company, Chevron Corporation, benefited from all the assets and rights
of Texaco and of Chevron, in the same way that the reverse triangular merger, cannot
serve as a legal mechanism to claim that Chevron benefited only from rights and assets,
leaving in the company Texaco the lawsuits and other pending obligations. It is
estimated that if the financial transaction between Chevron And Texaco meant that as
a result, the Texaco shareholders receive 0.77 ordinary shares of Chevron, and the
shareholders that Chevron became owners of 61% of the combined entity, valued at
100 billion, (page 140759) it is because this transaction involved the transfer of assets
and/or rights from which the new company and the shareholders of the combined
companies would directly benefit; however we must insist that it is contrary to the
principles of law and to good faith to expect that only the assets and rights have
transferred, while not the obligations. If we consider the mandate of the Law of
Companies and the principal of procedural truth, along with the evidence provided and
referred to in this judgment that demonstrate that Chevron (and its shareholders)
benefited from the merger with Texaco, plus the universal principles of law, we have
more than enough legal foundation for the transmission of the obligations of Texaco to
the defendant company, Chevron Corp.. In this way the obligation to submit to
Ecuadorian justice pending on Texaco Inc. was also transmitted to the new company
Chevron Texaco Corporation, so that consequently Chevron Corp. cannot allege that
it never operated in Ecuador to give grounds for lack of a legitimate opposing party.
The record shows that Texaco — who did operate it — was obligated to submit to this
jurisdiction, as can be seen in the judgment of the New York Court, at page 152883,
which states: ‘following remand, Texaco provided the missing commitment; in other
words, to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of Ecuador (and Peru as well),’ leaving
then the initiation of the complaint, by reason of territory under the competence of the
Presidency of this Court. In addition to the well-known, justified facts and the law
invoked, this Presidency has studied and considered the precedents of US legislation,
inasmuch as it recognizes that in cases where the merger is carried out in bad faith or
in order to defraud third parties, it must be assumed that it is a de facto merger. The
precedents in Delaware establish that ‘the corporations shall not be able to avoid their
responsibilities through a merger.’ In a manner consistent with that provided by the
principle of procedural truth, the Courts of the US pay more attention to the substance
than to the form of this type of transactions. It has been made clear that the simple fact

of calling a transaction a merger does not turn it into such, and that the Courts must
observe the substance of the transaction in place of what is alleged by the parties.
Considered of vital importance is the general principle according to which in mergers,
‘the party that benefits also assumes the obligations,’ which has been established in
various Codes. From the standpoint of legal scholars, imposing responsibilities on the
new company is appropriate in those cases where it knew previously of the
responsibility of its predecessors therefore, there being no argument whatsoever in the
record that indicates lack of knowledge on the part of Chevron Corp. regarding the
obligations of Texaco Inc., It is presumed that the existence of the New York Court’s
order was not concealed by Texaco Inc. from Chevron Corp. It is appropriate for the
purposes of justice, to impose on Chevron Corp., which benefited from the ‘merger,’
the obligations of Texaco Inc. On the other hand, to allow the right of the victims to
redress to disappear for mere formalities within the merger, would be considered by
the Courts of the US as ‘manifest Injustice,’ always considering that in certain
circumstances, allowing responsibilities to be avoided or eluded through corporate
formalities can be unfair for the victims, who would end up defenseless. Everything
stated leads us to raise serious doubts as to the good faith with which the defendant
acted in this lawsuit in particular, since this is the only known scenario in which
CHEVRON CORP. Appears disputing the merger with Texaco. Responsibility of
Texaco Inc, for Texpet. The complaint states that ‘The employ a subsidiary company,
in this case TEXPET, created to develop operations in Ecuador as a different
corporation, with little equity and patrimony, very much inferior to the real volume of
its operations, corresponds to a scheme designed for the clear purpose of limiting the
impact of any complaint derived from its activities in the country. In reality, TEXPET
was nothing more than a screen behind which TEXACO INC acted, being proprietary
by itself or through its subsidiaries of the total capital.’ It also affirms that TEXACO
INC directed, supervised and controlled the operations in Ecuador of its subsidiary
company TEXPET and established the operating procedures and techniques to be used
in the hydrocarbon exploration and production activities, however, as noted by the
defendant during the conciliation hearing, the Federal Court in New York declared
that neither Texaco Inc, nor Chevron Texaco Corp. ‘conceived or approved of’ the
‘decisions related to the methods, procedures, etc., used by Texpet in Ecuador’ (F.S.
253), so that it is appropriate, in the first place, to conduct an analysis of said legal
decision, which in the event it constitutes material res judicata would prevent this Court
from analyzing this topic again. Thus, the first thing noted is the fact that in the event
that this foreign judgment constitutes res judicata, it should have been so alleged, as a
defense, during the conciliation hearing, which was the appropriate procedural
moment according to Ecuadorian procedural Law. This defense has not been put forth,
demonstrating that the defendant did not have either the conviction or the intention
that said foreign legal judgment be considered as a material decision of final instance;
in the second place, it is noted that although the foreign legal judgment of the United
States District Court, of the Southern District of New York, of May 30, 2001,
(translation by expert Zambrano of November 14, 2008 at 2:30 p.m., from page
152840, in volume 1430) is in the record, which holds that ‘the plaintiffs, after taking
numerous deposition and obtaining responses to no fewer than 81 document requests
and 14 interrogatories, were unable to adduce material competent evidence of

meaningful Texaco [USA] involvement in the misconduct complained of’ (page
152882), this decision refers mainly to the competence of the Court, and was based on
various aspects that need to be reconsidered. From a reading of this court order in its
context it stands out that what is being analysed the decision in question is the link
between the evidence and the US or Ecuador as another parameter for establishing the
most suitable forum, concluding that the greatest amount of evidence is found in
Ecuador. The decision states that ‘the record establishes overwhelmingly that these
cases have everything to do with Ecuador and nothing to do with the United States’
(page 152880), which is not a decision on the merits that decides that Texaco Inc did
not direct or decide on operations in Ecuador, but rather that the lack of proof in this
aspect is considered as one more basis for demonstrating forum non conveniens. The
reasoning of the New York Court is considered correct insomuch as the majority of the
evidence should be, by logic, in Ecuador, which also implies that the New York Court
recognized that new evidence could be introduced. Then, if we consider the transcribed
text of the judgment we read that it refers to the fact that the record has been analyzed
in terms of ‘admissible evidence’ in the US, while in Ecuador the same norms do not
necessarily prevail in order to determine what is considered admissible evidence, with
this Presidency having to adhere to that which our laws establish as regards the
evidence, its presentation and its evaluation; and finally, the new evidence that has
been presented and that is part of this record pursuant to the referenced norms, must
be considered, and must necessarily be taken into account to establish the procedural
truth. In this way, the fact that only the evidence admissible and obtained in the U.S.
was analyzed, along with the fact that new evidence has been presented, push for
consideration of the facts at issue discussed in light of the totality of all the evidence.
In addition, it is felt that this decision refers to this issue only as one additional
argument that demonstrates the absence of a link of the case with the United States, in
order to demonstrate precisely that there was no discretion in the lower court decision
in deciding that in this case the evidence was found in Ecuador, but rather that the
balance of public and private interests tilts the scale toward an Ecuadorian forum, such
that what this judgment does is confirm the formal decision of the lower court, that
rejects the complaint based on Forum non Conveniens, but modifies this decision by
conditioning it on the commitment of Texaco to accept the interruption of the
extinguishing prescription of actions, such that it is clear that it is not possible to speak
of material res judicata, since the matters at issue have not been resolved, but rather
on the contrary, the complaint has been rejected taking as a basis the existence of a
more appropriate forum: this one. In this manner competence has settled in this
Presidency of the Provincial Court of Justice of Sucumbios, where in addition we must
give credit to evidence that has been presented in this lawsuit and that were not
considered either by the Federal Court in New York or by the appeals Court, in handing
down their judgments. Thus we conclude that the judicial decision of the Federal Court
in New York has not been final as to the merits of the matter, nor has it caused state,
so that material res judicata cannot be admitted, nor is it admissible as a decis
the merits binding on this Presidency which is fully competent to rule on this issue
submitted to be heard by it. Therefore, what is incumbent to analyze are both the
documents obtained and turned over by Texaco Inc through the Discovery process,
whose existence has been accepted by the defendant as a certain fact during the

conciliation hearing like other documents that have been lawfully presented, and the
law applicable to the specific circumstances of this case, in order to determine whether
it is appropriate to apply the doctrine of lifting the corporate veil, which in our legal
system has a jurisprudential and not legislative development. Thus, we begin again
remembering that the origin of this institution is due to the need that judges and courts
had to remedy the severe crisis in which the concept of legal entity entered due to the
fact that many have taken advantage of the benefits that the recognition of the
corporate legal entity assumes. That is how our case law recognizes it, in the decision
No. 135-2003, handed down in the ordinary lawsuit for payment of sales Commission
No. 36-2003 that José Miguel Massuh Buraye brought against Roberto Dumani,
published in R.O. No. 128 of July 18, 2003, which notes that ‘[...] cases are presented
in which the legal entity is abused in order to avoid the fulfilment of legal obligations,
especially tax-related or to be used as a screen to evade the rights of third parties. For
this reason, the doctrine is being consolidated which allows for judges to be able to
tear away the veil of legal personality and adopt measures with regard to the men and
the relationships covered behind it,’ such that the benefits granted by the legal system
are limited, thought to promote the general economic development, not only of honest
businessmen, but of all society; however, abusing the division or separation of equity
and of responsibility, the corporate veil has been used for perverse purposes, that have
no relation with its objective. Along that same line, it has been expressed to the
Supreme Court of Justice in decision No.120-2001 on a petition for cassation, in verbal
summary proceeding 242-99, which points out that ‘in the actions of legal entities, in
recent years a well-known and prejudicial deviation has been observed, now that it is
used as an oblique or detoured path to evade the law or harm third parties.’ (Published
in R.O. No. 350 of Tuesday, June 19, 2001, Gaceta Judicial, No. 5, Year CII, Series
XVII, p. 1262, Quito, March 21, 2001). In view of this possibility, which has been
alleged by the plaintiff, it is necessary to start by analyzing it considering that this suit
has been brought for the redress of environmental harm supposedly caused by TEXPET
while it was operating the Napo Concession, therefore it is appropriate for us to
determine if the conditions are met that permit lifting the corporate veil in order to
attribute responsibility to Texaco Inc for the conduct or acts of Texpet, to which the
defendant has expressly objected, noting they are separate and independent companies,
so that in order to resolve this aspect, the various factors will be analyzed that reflect,
beyond formal questions, the level of dependence between subsidiary and parent
company in order to determine whether it can be considered that the corporate veil has
been used to hide the true interested parties and beneficiaries of the subsidiary’s
affairs, or if it has been legitimate. 1.- With this purpose we first note that the capital
of the subsidiary company shall be consistent with the amount of business done and the
obligations to be met, because it is understood that business people acting in good faith
risk in their affairs a capital rationally adequate to face their potential responsibilities.
The capital of the subsidiary can be considered insufficient if it requires constant
authorizations and transfers of funds to proceed with the normal course of business,
since in that case, those really making the decisions and exercising control over the
activities are the people who provide the authorizations and the funds, which frequently
are sheltered behind the mask of the legal entity, making necessary that in certain cases
the formal structure of the corporate entity be disregarded in order to avoid defrauding

third parties. In the record at volume 65, pages 6827, 6828,6830, 6831, 6826, 6833,
are the translations of various requests for authorization from Shields to Palmar, in
which Mr Shields makes requests in the name of the ‘Ecuadorian Division’ of Texaco
Inc. to his superiors at Texaco Inc., requesting their approval for various matters
pertaining to the operations in the Ecuadorian Oriente. The record contains
authorizations for everyday matters, of routine administration, such as tenders for
catering services and the cleaning of the Consortium’s operating sites in Quito and the
Oriente region (translation of document PET 029369 at page 6827 and PET 028910
at page 6830), or the contracting of motion picture entertainment services at the
Oriente installations (PET 029086 at page 6831). Likewise we find an authorization
for the contracting of equipment and personnel for pipeline maintenance (PET 019212
on page 6828) and construction of bridges in Aguarico and Coca (PET 016879 at page
6833). Finally, Shields requests Palmer’s authorization to begin the exploration of the
Sacha-84 well, in October 1976 (PET 012134). Also in the record are various
documents from the Texpet archives, containing authorization requests from Bischoff
to Palmer, in volume 65, pages 6839, 6840, 6843, 6844, 6848, where it appears that,
like Shields, Palmer refers to Texpet’s operations in the Oriente as ‘the Ecuadorian
Division.’ Among his requests for authorization is the urgent request to approve the
tender for two ‘workover’ towers (support and maintenance) for production in the
Oriente (PET 030919 at page 6839), and the tender on a road between the Yuca and
Culebra wells (PET 016947 at page 6843), key aspects for the development of Texpet’s
operations. Authorization also is requested to extend the contract for ferry services in
the zone (PET 032775 at page 6844), and more importantly, approval is requested of
the approval documents for Vista-1 Well. There is also a memorandum of special
importance revealing the existence of a lineal chain of authorization existing between
these executives, since Bischoff asks Palmer who, after approving the document, signs
and forwards it to McKinley, a higher executive of Texaco Inc (PET 022857 at page
6848), denoting the existence of a chain of command, which meant that the decisions
regarding every aspect relating to the operation of Texpet in Ecuador were made by
executives of Texaco Inc in the U.S. In addition, there are respective authorization
requests in the record from Palmer to Granville, in volume 66, pages 6930, 6938, 6943,
which show that the chain of authorizations extends higher than Palmer, since in
echoing a request from Shields (see PET 019212 at page 6828), Palmer asks Granville
for authorization to contract equipment and personnel for pipeline maintenance (PET
029976 at page 69309) and per Bischoff’s requirement (see PET 030919, at page
6839), approves one of the offers for the construction of the ‘workover’ towers,
submitting said approval to Granville for an O.K. (PET 029991, at page 6943). The
record also contains letters and memorandums from Shields and Palmer to John
McKinley, coming from the Texaco Inc, and Texpet files. In volume 66, pages 6957,
6958, 6964, 6959, 6960, 6974. That show that both Shields and Palmer maintained a
constant flow of letters and memos with McKinley, asking for his authorization and
informing him of events relating to the Napo Concession. Likewise, letters from minor
officials addressed to Shields, in volume 65, pages 6855, 6856, 6860, 6861, 6875, 6882,
6885, where reference is made to letters addressed to Shields that originated in Quito,
in hands of minor officials who requested his authorization, such as William Saville,
who was a Texpet executive who operated in Quito, and sent many and daily

communications to Shields (in New York) requesting authorizations. For example, he
sent Shields the estimated costs of drilling the Sacha 36 to 41 wells (unnumbered doc)
and asks his approval to start the tender for fuel transport in the Oriente (PET 031387
at page 6856). J.E.F. Caston, another executive of the oil firm based in Quito, asks
Shields for his authorization to call for bids for various services (PET 020758 at page
6860) and to approve the estimated costs of installing submersible pumps in five wells
in the Lago Agrio field. Finally, we have Max Crawford, another official based in
Quito, who also periodically asked for Shields’ approval for various purposes (PET
035974 at page 6882, and unnumbered doc at page 6885). On the other hand, it is
necessary to consider the proven fact that the decisions of the ‘Executive Committee’
of Texpet had to be approved by the board of directors of Texaco Inc, as we see that in
the Minutes of the Board of Directors No. 478 (Volume 25, page 2427), where it
approved Texpet’s decision to enter into negotiations with Ecuador to object to an
increase in the income tax for the oil company, and additional payments, in the same
way that the Texaco Inc board of directors approved the purchase of a plane for US$
850,000, Minutes 456 (Volume 24, page 2351), demonstrating the decision-making
power of Texaco Inc. over the purchases made by Texpet. In my opinion, these minutes
demonstrate the constant scrutiny that the parent firm Texaco Inc. maintained over all
operations and news relative to Texpet in Ecuador. If we analyze this fact
independently, perhaps it could be confused with the normal control that a board of
directors exercises over its subsidiaries. However we must analyze this control by the
parent firm over its subsidiary in its context, taking into account also that the Board of
Directors of Texaco Inc. also delivered the ‘allocations’ of money with which Texpet
operated, which implies that Texpet lacked not only administrative autonomy, but also
financial, since it was Texaco Inc. that controlled not only the decisions, but that also
authorized the funds that Texpet needed for the normal course of activities. Starting
with the admitted fact that Texpet is a fourth level subsidiary company belonging one
hundred per cent to a single owner, Texaco Inc., and that Texpet operated with funds
coming from the coffer of Texaco Inc., it has been shown that there is not a real
separation of patrimony. We understand that different legal entities necessarily imply
differentiated patrimony, according to the rules of the attributes of the entity, however
in this case, the confusion of patrimony is obvious, plus a confusion of entities in the
same manner. Among the evidence that lead us to this conviction we cite additionally
the minutes of a board of directors meeting of Texaco Inc. No. 380, dated January 22,
1965 (Volume 22, page 2166), which established allocations in favor of the Cia. Texaco
Petréleos del Ecuador for an amount of US$ 30,212.00. The minutes of the board of
directors meeting of Texaco Inc. No. 387, dated September 17, 1965, (Volume 22, page
2176), established allocations in favor of Texaco Petroleum Company (Texpet) for an
amount of US$ 27,625.00. Minutes of the board of directors meeting of Texaco Inc. No.
393, dated April 19, 1966 (Volume 22, page 2182), established allocations in favor of
Texaco Petroleum Company (Texpet) for an amount of US$ 331,272.00, and in favor
of the Cia. Texaco Petréleos del Ecuador for an amount of US$ 13,631 establishing in
this way the conviction of this Presidency regarding that Texaco Inc., controlled the
funds both of the company exercising the concession rights (Texaco Petréleos del
Ecuador) and of the one contracted to operate the concession of the fields, which makes
it obvious that TEXPET was a company without any capital or sufficient autonomy to

face the normal course of business, which in turn constitutes more evidence of lack of
independence of the subsidiary with respect to the principal, leading us to the
conviction that TEXPET was an undercapitalized company, that depended both
economically and administratively on its parent company. The amount of the contracts
that require authorizations to make likely the unavailability of its own capital, which
is an indication of inability to face the possible responsibilities that can be expected
after an oil operation. Cabanellas explains to us in his work ‘Derecho Societario: Parte
General. La personalidad juridical societaria [Corporate Law: General Section. The
corporate legal entity] that ‘the corporate entity is based on a set of rules that
determine what conduct is attributable to the corporation as a legal entity. The general
effects of those rules may see themselves modified according to certain norms that alter
that attribution, turning to imputing the conduct that normally would be attributable to
the corporation as a legal entity, to other physical or legal persons, such as their
partners or other people who exercise the control in fact of the corporation.’ (See Vol.
3. Buenos Aires: Editorial Heliasta, 1993. P. 65.) It has been shown in the record that
the authorizations and investments required by TEXPET, made it so the de facto control
of its operations was exercised by the parent company, which constitutes an important
issue to be considered. Lépez Mesa and José Cesano state it well in their work, El
abuso de la personalidad juridica de las sociedades comerciales: Contribuciones a su
estudio desde las 6pticas mercantil y penal [The abuse of the legal entity of commercial
corporations: Contributions to its study from the commercial and criminal
perspectives] (Buenos Aires: Depalma, 2000), when they note that ‘The regime of the
legal entity cannot be used against the superior interests of the society or the rights of
third parties. The techniques manipulated to inhibit the purely instrumental use of the
corporate form vary and adopt different names, but they all propose, in substance, the
consideration of the economic and social reality and the supremacy of objective law.’
Concordantly, the Supreme Court, in Ruling 120.2001, cited above, has said that ‘in
the face of these abuses, it is necessary to react by rejecting the legal entity, that is,
drawing aside the veil that separates third parties with the true final recipients of the
results of a legal business to reach them, in order to prevent that the corporate entity
be used improperly as a mechanism to harm third parties, be they creditors who would
be hindered or impeded from attaining the fulfilment of their loans, be they legitimate
holders of a good or a right who would be deprived or dispossessed of them. These are
extreme situations, that must be analyzed with extreme care, as legal certainty cannot
be affected, but neither can, on the pretext of upholding this value, the abuse of the law
or the fraud on the law through the abuse of the corporate institution be allowed.’ 2.-
Now, if we consider the formal questions, such as the fact that the same people hold
the positions of executive directors and other managerial posts in both companies,
added to the admitted fact that Texaco Inc was the 100% owner of Texpet, the certainty
abounds as to the need to apply the doctrine of corporate lifting. For example, Mr
Robert C. Shields held the position of Vice President of Texaco Inc. between 1971 and
1977, while at the same time being the Head of Texpet’s Board of Directors, according
to his sworn statement (volume 63, page 6595). Review of the record shows that Shields
signs his letters on behalf of Texpet, when according to his own testimony between
1971 and 1977 he held the position of Vice President of Texaco Inc. This fact is
consistent with Bischoff’s statement that Texpet was the division of Texaco Inc. that

operated in Latin America, and not a mere subsidiary, as the defendant’s defense
maintains. In the same way, over the course of his career, M. Robert M. Bischoff held
positions with Texaco Inc. both in the United States and in Latin America. Between
1962 and 1968 he worked as Vice President in the production division for Latin
America, which he himself calls Texaco Petroleum Company (Texpet), according to his
sworn statement in volume 63, page 6621. This shows how even the executives of
Texaco Inc. themselves thought of Texpet as a division of Texaco Inc., and not as a
separate company. Like Shields, the record clearly shows that Bischoff actively
participated in the complex decision-making chains and processes that involved
Texaco Inc. and Texpet. In his sworn statement Bischoff explains how the contracts of
Texpet’s headquarters, located in Florida, that exceeded US$500,000.00 had to be
approved by an attorney of the last name Wissel, head of Texaco Inc.’s attorneys. In
this case, we see how the relationship between Texpet and Texaco Inc. was not limited
to this one owning the shares of the other, but rather that both worked intimately linked,
with Texaco Inc. taking all the decisions while Texpet was limited to carrying them out.
It is true that as a general rule a company can have subsidiaries with completely
distinct legal status. However, when the subsidiaries share the same informal name,
the same personnel, and are directly linked to the parent company in an uninterrupted
chain of operational decision-making, the separation between entities and patrimonies
is significantly clouded, or even comes to disappear. In this case, it has been proven
that in reality Texpet and Texaco Inc. functioned in Ecuador as a single and
inseparable operation. Both the important decisions as well as the trivial ones passed
through various levels of executives and decision-making bodies of Texaco Inc., to the
extent that the subsidiary depended on the parent company to contract a simple
catering service. In this regard it is completely normal that the Board of Directors of
a subsidiary company be made up of some officers from its parent company, and it is
also normal that the parent company receive periodic reports on its condition, and take
certain decisions that for their importance are beyond the reach of the regular
administration. However, in the case of Texaco Inc. and its subsidiary Texaco
Petroleum Company (Texpet), the role of the Directors transcends roles that might be
considered normal, as they received information and made decisions about the great
majority of Texpet’s deeds and acts regarding everyday matters of the operation of the
Napo Oil concession, responding to a well. lished chain of c d, as has been
shown in the record. 3.- Finally, it is considered that the doctrine of lifting the
corporate veil is especially applicable in the face of the abuses that can be committed
in detriment to the public order or the rights of third parties, in order to avoid fraud
and injustice, that is, that the corporate veil must be lifted whenever not doing so favors
a fraud or promotes injustice, as would be the case in which we find schemes
intentionally created to leave the profits in the parent company, while the obligations
remain in a subsidiary, which in general is incapable of satisfying them. As Lépez Mesa
and José Cesano rightly say: ‘Even when it is admitted as a hypothesis that two
corporations are subordinate to a decision-making unit or constitute an economic unit
or corporate group, this is not sufficient data to dispense with the legal autonomy of
each one of the corporate subjects implicated in the acts, as long as it is not alleged
and proved that the legal forms have been implemented to prejudice the plaintiff in his
rights, since what is appropriate is to respect the corporation’s separation of assets,

as long as this is not likely to be the means of violation of other legal rules, since
rejection of the status or attribution of responsibility to persons in distinct
appearances, is exclusively based on proving the abuse of the privilege granted to the
detriment of public order or the rights of third parties’ (Pages 145 and 146). Along
these lines it is noted that the plaintiffs have indeed expressly alleged that Texpet was
a company implemented to keep pending responsibilities in a company without
sufficient capital, while keeping the capital of the parent company free of
responsibilities, with the precise objective of avoiding potential liabilities with third
parties, while the record contains abundant evidence, as has been noted above,
demonstrating the subsidiary’s deep ties and lack of independence with respect to its
parent company, which was who actually took the decisions and benefited from the acts
of its subsidiary, which is moreover incapable of meeting the extent of the
ibilities that are de led of it. Consideration is finally given to what the
Supreme Court of Justice stated in its judgment No. 393, handed down in Ordinary
Proceeding No. 1152-95 for moral damages brought by Rubén Moran Buenafio against
Ricardo Antonio Onofre Gonzdlez and Leopoldo Moran Intriago, published in R.O.
No. 273 of September 9, 1999, that with respect to the lifting of the corporate veil warns
that ‘the use of this instrument is not open nor indiscriminate, rather it will be in those
hypotheses in which the interpreter of the Law comes to the assessment that the legal
entity has been constituted with the aim of defrauding either the law or the interests of
third parties, or when the use of the formal cover in the legal entity consists leads to
the same defrauding effects’ aspect that coincides with that indicated by the cited
authors in that this principle ‘cannot be made without first applying a large dose of
prudence, mindful that its indiscriminate, frivolous, immoderate application could lead
to doing away with the formal structure of companies, or else to disallowing it under
circumstances where it is not warranted, with serious harm to the law, certainty and
security in legal relationships,’ such that considering the foregoing analysis, the
exceptional but justified need has been established in this case to lift any corporate veil
that separates Texaco Inc. in its fourth-level subsidiary, Texaco Petroleum Company
(Texpet), given that it has been proven that it was a company with a capital very inferior
to the volume of its operations, that required constant authorizations and investments
from the parent company to carry out the normal course of business of its commercial
activity, that the executives were the same in both companies, and principally the
obvious fact that not lifting the corporate veil would imply a ‘manifest injustice’.

Piaguaje, y otros, amparados en el contenido de los articulos 2241 y
2256 de la anterior codificacién*del..Cédigo Civil (en adelante CC),
actualmente articulos 2214 y 2229  respectivamente, segun la

2005, para fundamentar la obligacion de reparar el:dano; en el
articulo 169 de la OIT para fundamentar el derécho a compensacién
de los pueblos indigenas; y en cuanto al derecho a reclamar las
reparaciones derivadas de una afectacién ambiental, en el namero 6
del articulo 23 y en el articulo 86 de la Constitucién de 1998, asi
como en el articulo 2260 de la anterior codificacién del Codigo Civil,
actualmente articulo 2236, que dice “Por regla general se concede
accién popular en todos los casos de dafo contingente que por
imprudencia o negligencia de alguno amenace a_ personas
indeterminadas. Pero si el dafio.amenazare solamente a personas
determinadas, sélo alguna de éstas podra intentar la accién”, y en el
41 de la Ley de Gestion Ambiental -.en adelante LGA (fs. 78 y 79),
comparecen desde fojas 73 a 80 demandando la eliminacién o
remocion de elementos contaminantes y la reparacién de dafios
ambientales, en contra de CHEVRON TEXACO CORPORATION, que

Corte, que como ha quedado establecido en este caso viene dada
por la Constitucion, el nuevo COFJ, el CPC, y la LGA. Esta ”
Presidencia considera que el hecho alegado de que Chevron
Corporation no es sucesora de TEXACO INC. no obsta la
competencia de esta Corte, sino que eventualmente, de ser cierto el
hecho alegado se configuraria como falta de legitimo contradictor,
excepcién que ha sido alegada como primera excepcién subsidiaria
en la contestacién a la demanda, y que sera analizada mas
adelante.- SEGUNDO.- La litis ha quedado trabada con las
pretensiones de la parte actora y las excepciones propuestas por la
demandada en la audiencia de conciliaci6n; como es légico se
analiz6 primero los aspectos previos tratados en la contestacion, los
mismos que se refieren a la falta de competencia de esta Corte, que
ha sido fundamentada en torno a varios hechos que también son
materia de las demas excepciones tratadas posteriormente en la
contestacién y que se resolveran oportunamente en este fallo. Las
excepciones planteadas, en su orden, se resuelven a continuaci6n.-
TERCERO.- La demandada ha alegado las siguientes excepciones,
que seran analizadas en el orden que han sido presentadas porque
en la contestacién la parte demandada no las diferencia si son
excepciones dilatorias o perentorias: 3.1.- Falta de legitimo
contradictor. La demanda afirma que Chevron es sucesora de
Texaco mientras que la demandada niega esta afirmacién, por lo
que debiendo pronunciarme al respecto, segtin consta del
expediente, se observa que el estricto sentido juridico, es decir,
entendiendo la sucesi6n como un modo de adquirir el dominio por
el que se transmiten derechos y obligaciones del causante a sus
sucesores (segun la tradicién romanista), es correcta la afirmacién
de que Chevron no es sucesora de Texaco Inc., por cuanto consta
del proceso prueba documental debidamente certificada que
evidencia que Texaco Inc. mantiene personeria juridica y por ende
vida legal (en fojas 222 y 223 se encuentra el documento original en
inglés, traducido en fojas 224 y 225), de manera que resulta
evidente que no puede haber sucesién mortis causa sin que exista
causante. Esta Presidencia empieza el analisis considerando la
exposicion de la parte demandada en la audiencia de conciliacién,
referente a que no existié una fusion entre Texaco y Chevron, sino
que como lo prueban con el certificado que reposa en fojas 230 y
231 (traduccién en fojas 225), la fusion ocurrié en realidad entre
Texaco Inc. y Keepep Inc. Sin embargo esta realidad probada
documentalmente debe ser analizada a la luz de todo el acervo

probatorio, por lo que se consideran varios aspectos, entre los que
convienen referirnos primeramente que a
del 2003, a las sentada as la

octubre de 2003, a las 17h20, ordenando que se cumpla con lo
ordenado o que se presente la excusa el dia senalado. Como se hizo

notar, la razén sentada por Secretaria indica claramente que la

parte demandada no se presenté en el dia y hora sefalada, por lo

que no present6 excusa valida” para este incumplimiento.
Considerando el Art. 826 del Codigo de Procedimiento Civil respecto

al mérito de la exhibicion pedida como prueba, y debiendo esta
Presidencia considerar Gnicamente los elementos que forman parte

del proceso, estimo que la negativa.a cumplir con la exhibicion
ordenada no puede favorecer a la parte en rebeldia, sino por el
contrario, el Cédigo de Procedimiento Civil ha establecido una

sancion para estos casos, en el Art. 827, que dice: “Si ordenada la
exhibicion no se la cumpliere dentro del término senalado, se
impondra al renuente una multa de diez a cuarenta délares de los

Estados Unidos de América por cada dia de retardo, segin la

cuantia del asunto. Esta multa no podra exceder del valor
equivalente a noventa dias”, por lo que en este caso en razén del

tiempo transcurrido debe aplicarse la multa maxima, equivalente a

40 dolares diarios multiplicados por los 90 dias, por cada
documento que no ha sido exhibido conforme fuera ordenado. Del

mismo modo sucede con los documentos cuya exhibicién fue

actividades son las personas que proveen las autorizaciones y los
fondos, que frecuentemente se encuentren cobijadas tras la %
mascara de personalidad juridica, haciendo necesario que en ciertos

casos se desestime la estructura formal del ente societario para

evitar la defraudacién de terceros. En el expediente, en el cuerpo

65, fojas 6827, 6828,6830, 6831, 6826, 6833, constan las
traducciones de varios pedidos de autorizacién de Shields a Palmar,

en los que el sefior Shields hace pedidos a nombre de la “Divisién
Ecuatoriana” de Texaco Inc. a sus superiores de Texaco Inc.,
solicitando su aprobacién para diversos asuntos propios de las
operaciones en el Oriente ecuatoriano. Constan en el expediente
autorizaciones para asuntos cotidianos, de administracién regular,

como la licitacién de servicios de catering y limpieza para los sitios

de operaciones del consorcio en Quito y el Oriente (traduccién de
documento PET 029369 en foja 6827 y PET 028910 en foja 6830), o

la contratacién de servicios de entretenimiento cinematografico en

las instalaciones del Oriente (PET 029086 en foja 6831). Del mismo

modo encontramos una autorizacién para la contratacién de
equipos y personal para el mantenimiento de oleoductos (PET
019212 en foja 6828) y construccién de puentes en Aguarico y Coca

(PET 016879 en foja 6833). Finalmente, Shields solicita la
autorizacion de Palmer para iniciar la exploracion del pozo Sacha- -
84, en octubre de 1976 (PET 012134), También constan_del{iS0" | |
expediente varios documentos de los archivos Texpet, con pedidos Memo: p. 4
de autorizacién de Bischoff a Palmer, en el cuerpo 65, fojas 6839,

6840, 6843, 6844, 6848, donde consta que del mismo modo que

Shields, Palmer se refiere a las operaciones de Texpet en el Oriente

como “la Division Ecuatoriana”. Entre sus pedidos de autorizacién,

consta el urgente pedido para aprobar la licitacién de dos torres de
“workover” (soporte y mantenimiento) para la explotacién en el

Oriente (PET 030919 en foja 6839), y la licitacion de un camino

entre los pozos Yuca y Culebra (PET 016947 en foja 6843), aspectos

claves para el desarrollo de las operaciones de Texpet. También se

solicita autorizacion para extender un contrato de servicios de ferri

en la zona (PET 032775 en foja 6844), y con mayor importancia, se—= <5,
solicita aprobacién de los documentos de aprobacién del Pozo Vistactiemo: pp.
1. Consta ademas urmmemorando de especial importancia revelando|,_5

la existencia de una cadena lineal de autorizacion existente entre
estos ejecutivos, pues Bischoff le solicita a Palmer que, de aprobar
el documento, lo firme y reenvie a McKinley, un ejecutivo superior
de Texaco Inc (PET 022857 en foja 6848), denotando la existencia,
de una cadena de mando, que hacia que las decisiones sobre todo!
aspecto relacionado con la operacién de Texpet en Ecuador sean!
tomadas por ejecutivos de Texaco Inc, en EEUU. Adicionalmente,
constan en el expediente sendos pedidos de autorizacion de Palmer

a Granville, en el cuerpo 66, fojas 6930, 6938, 6943, que
demuestran que la cadena de autorizaciones se extiende mas arriba
de Palmer, ya que haciendo eco de un pedido de Shields (ver PET
019212, en foja 6828), Palmer le solicita a Granville la autorizaci6n
para contratar equipos y personal para el mantenimiento de
oleoductos (PET 029976, en foja 69309) y segin el requerimiento de
Bischoff (ver PET 030919, en foja 6839) aprueba una de las ofertas

para la construcci6n de las torres de “workover”, sometiendo dicha - -
aprobacién al visto bueno de Grapuille (PET 029901,_en-foja- 6049)" |
Existen ademas en el expediente S y memorandos de Shields y

Palmer a John McKinley, provenientes de los archivos Texaco Inc, y
Texpet. En el cuerpo 66, fojas 6957, 6958, 6964, 6959, 6960, 6974.
Que demuestran que tanto Shields como Palmer mantenian un flujo

constante de cartas y memos~*con McKinley, solicitando su
autorizacién e informandole acerca de acontecimientos relacionados

con la Concesion Napo. Del:mismo modo, cartas de funcionarios

menores dirigidas a Shields, en el cuerpo 65," fojas 6855, 6856,
6860, 6861, 6875, 6882, 6885, donde se hace referencias a cartas |Memo:p. 6
dirigidas a Shields que se originaron“-enQuito,en manos de
funcionarios menores que solicitaban su autorizacién, como William
Saville, que era un ejecutivo de Texpet que operaba en Quito, y
envid muchas y cotidianas comunicaciones a Shields (en Nueva
York) solicitando autorizaciones. Por ejemplo, lé envia a Shields los
costos estimados de la perforacién de los pozos Sacha 36 al 41 (doc
s/n), y solicita su aprobaci6n para iniciar la licitacién de transporte
de combustibles en el Oriente (PET 031387 en foja 6856). J.E.F.
Caston, otro ejecutivo de la petrolera ubicado en Quito solicita la
autorizacion de Shields para licitar varios servicios (PET 020758 en
foja 6860) y para aprobar los costos estimados de instalar bombas
sumergibles en cinco pozos en-el campo Lago Agrio. Finalmente
tenemos a Max Crawford, otro funcionario radicado en Quito, quien
también solicitaba periéddicamente la aprobacién de Shields para
diversos objetivos (PET 035974 en foja 6882, y doc s/r en foja
6885). Por otro lado, debe ser considerado el hecho probado de que
las decisiones del “Comité Ejecutivo” de Texpet debian ser.
aprobadas por el directorio de Texaco Inc, como vemos que en el
Acta de Directorio No. 478 (Cuerpo 25, foja 2427), donde éste |Fusion Memo:
aprobé la decision de Texpet de entrar en negociaciones con el |?- 10
Ecuador para oponerse a una elevacién en el impuesto a la renta
para la petrolera, y pagos adicionales, del mismo modo que el
directorio de Texaco Inc. aprobo la compra de un avion de USD
850.000, Acta 456 (Cuerpo 24, foja 2351), demostrando el poder de
decisién de Texaco Inc. sobre las compras realizadas por Texpet. En

mi criterio estas actas demuestran el constante escrutinio que la
matriz Texaco Inc. mantenia sobre toda operacién y noticias

me

 

 

relativas a Texpet en Ecuador. Si analizamos este hecho
independientemente, quizas se pueda confundir como el normal
control que ejerce un directorio sobre sus subsidiarias. Sin embargo
debemos analizar este control de la matriz sobre su subsidiaria
dentro de su contexto, tomando en cuenta también que el Directorio
de Texaco Inc. ademas entregaba las “asignaciones” de dinero con
las cuales Texpet operaba, lo cual implica que Texpet carecia no
solo de autonomia administrativa, sino financiera, ya que era
Texaco Inc. quien controlaba no solo las decisiones, sino que
también autorizaba los fondos que Texpet necesitaba para el normal
desenvolvimiento de actividades. Partiendo del hecho admitido de
que Texpet es una empresa subsidiaria de cuarto nivel
perteneciente ciento por ciento a un duefio Unico, Texaco Inc., y que
Texpet operaba con fondos provenientes de las arca de Texaco Inc.,
ha quedado demostrado que no existe una separacién real de
patrimonio. Entendemos que personalidades juridicas distintas
necesariamente implican patrimonios diferenciados, segun las|
reglas de los atributos de la personalidad, sin embargo en este casol®-2
la confusién de patrimonios se hace evidente, confundiendo del
mismo modo las personalidades. Entre las pruebas que nos llevan a
este convencimiento citamos adicionalmente el acta de reunion de
directorio de Texaco Inc. No. 380, de fecha 22 de enero de 1965
(Cuerpo 22, foja 2166), que estableciéd asignaciones a favor de la
Cia. Texaco Petréleos del Ecuador por un monto de USD 30.312,00.[Fusion Memo:
Et acta de reunion de directorio de Texaco Inc. No. 387, de fecha 17/|p. 10

de septiembre de 1965 (Cuerpo 22, foja 2176) establecid
asignaciones a favor de Texaco Petroleum Company (Texpet}, por un
monto de USD 27.625,00. El“acta de reunién de Directorio de
Texaco Inc. No. 393, de fecha 19 de abril de 1966 (Cuerpo 22, foja
2182) establecid asignaciones a favor de Texaco Petréleum
Company (Texpet), por un monto de USD 331.272,00, y a favor de la
Cia. Texaco Petrdéleos del Ecuador por USD 13.631. queda de este
modo establecida la conviccién de esta Presidencia respecto a que
Texaco Inc., controlaba los fondos tanto de la empresa que ejercia
los derechos de la concesién (Texaco Petréleos del Ecuador) como de
la que fuera contratada para operar la concesién de los campos, por
lo que resulta evidente que TEXPET fue una empresa sin capital ni
autonomia suficiente para afrontar el giro normal del negocio, lo
cual a su vez se configura como otra evidencia de falta de
independencia de la subsidiaria respecto a la principal, llevandonos
a la conviccién de que TEXPET era una empresa infracapitalizada,
que dependia tanto econémica como administrativamente de su
matriz. El monto de los contratos que requieren autorizaciones
hacer presumible la indisponibilidad de capital propio, lo cual es
una indicacién de incapacidad para hacer frente a las eventuales

responsabilidades que pueden preverse tras una _ operaci6én
petrolera. Cabanellas nos explica en su obra “Derecho Societario:
Parte General. La personalidad juridica societaria’, que “la
personalidad societaria se basa en un conjunto de reglas que
determinan qué conductas se imputan a las sociedad en cuanto
persona juridica. Los efectos generales de esas reglas pueden verse
modificados en funcidén de ciertas normas que alteran tal
atribucién, pasando a imputarse las conductas que normalmente
serian atribuibles a la sociedad como persona juridica, a otras
personas fisicas o de existencia ideal, como pueden ser sus socios u
otras personas que ejercen de hecho el control de la sociedad.” (Ver.
Vol.3. Buenos Aires: Editorial Heliasta, 1993. P. 65). Ha quedado
demostrado en el expediente que las autorizaciones e inversiones
requeridas por TEXPET, hacian--que’el-control de hecho sobre sus
operaciones sea ejercido de “la matriz, lo» que constituye un
importante aspecto a ser considerado: Bien lo afirma Lopez Mesa y
José Cesano en su obra: El abuso de la personalidad juridica de las
sociedades comerciales: Contribuciones a su ‘estudio desde las
épticas mercantil y penal (Buenos. Aires: Depalma, 2000), al decir
que “El régimen de la personalidad juridica no puede ser utilizado
en contra de los intereses superiores de la.sociedad ni de los
derechos de terceros. Las téecnicas manipuladas para cohibir el uso
meramente instrumental de la forma societaria varian y adoptan
diversos nombres, pero. todos : postulan, en  sustancia, la
consideraci6n de la realidad econémica y social y la supremacia del
derecho objetivo”. Concordantemente la Corte Suprema, en la
Sentencia 120.2001, citada anteriormente, ha dicho que “frente a
estos abusos, hay que reaccionar. desestimando la personalidad
juridica, es decir, descorriendo el velo que separa a los terceros con
los verdaderos destinatarios finales de los resultados de un negocio
juridico llegar hasta éstos, a fin de_impedir. que la figura societaria
se utilice desviadamente como un mecanismo para perjudicar a
terceros, sean acreedores a quienes se les obstaculizaria o impediria
el que puedan alcanzar el cumplimiento de sus créditos, sean
legitimos titulares de un bien o un derecho a quienes se les privaria
o despojaria de ellos. Estas son situaciones extremas, que deben
analizarse con sumo cuidado, ya que no puede afectarse la
seguridad juridica, pero tampoco puede a pretexto de proteger este
valor, permitir el abuso del derecho 0 el fraude a la ley mediante el
abuso de la institucién societaria”. 2.- Ahora bien, si consideramos
las cuestiones formales, como el hecho de que las mismas personas
ejercen los cargos de directores ejecutivos y otros cargos directivos
en ambas empresas, sumado al hecho admitido de que Texaco Inc
era propietario del 100% de Texpet, se abunda en la conviccién de
la necesidad de aplicar la doctrina del levantamiento societario. Por

ejemplo, el sefior Robert C. Shields, desempefid el cargo de
Vicepresidente de Texaco Inc. entre 1971 y 1977, siendo a la vez
Jefe de la Junta de Directores de Texpet, segiin consta en su
declaraci6én juramentada (cuerpo 63, foja 6595). Al revisar el
expediente consta que Shields suscribe sus cartas a nombre de
Texpet, cuando segun su mismo testimonio entre 1971 y 1977
ostentaba el cargo de Vicepresidente de Texaco Inc. Este hecho
guarda coherencia con lo declarado por Bischoff, acerca de que
Texpet era la division de Texaco Inc. que operaba en Latinoamérica,
y no una mera subsidiaria, como sostiene la defensa de la parte

América Latina. Entre 1962 y 1968 trabajé como Vicepresidente en|usion Memo:

como inclusive los mismos ejecutivos de Texaco Inc. pensaban en,
Texpet como una division de Texaco Inc., y no como una empresal
separada. Al igual que Shields, ha quedado claro en el expediente|
que Bischoff participaba activamente en las complejas cadenas y
procesos de toma de decisiones que involucraban a Texaco Inc. y
Texpet. En su declaracién juramentada Bischoff explica cémo los
contratos del cuartel general de Texpet, ubicados en Florida, que se
excedieran de USD 500.000,00 debian ser aprobados por un

distinta. Sin embargo, cuando las subsidiarias comparten el mismo

nombre informal, el mismo personal, y estén directamente

vinculadas con la empresa madre en una cadena ininterrumpida de

toma de decisiones operativas, la separacién entre personas y
patrimonios se difumina bastante, o incluso llega desaparecer. En

este caso, se ha probado que en la realidad Texpet y Texaco Inc.
funcionaron en el Ecuador como una operacién Unica e inseparable.

Tanto las decisiones importantes como las triviales pasaban por

diversos niveles de ejecutivos y érganos de decisién de Texaco Inc.,

a tal punto que la subsidiaria dependia de la matriz para contratar

un simple servicio de catering. En este sentido este sentido es
completamente normal que el Directorio de una empresa

subsidiaria esté conformado por algunos oficiales de su matriz, y

que también es normal que la matriz reciba informes periédicos

asuntos cotidianos de la

respondiendo a una cadena de mando bien establecida, como
ha quedado demostrado en el expediente. 3.-Finalmente se
considera que la doctrina del levantamiento del velo societario es
especialmente aplicable frente a los abusos que se pueda cometer
en detrimento del orden publico o de derechos de terceros, para
evitar el fraude y la injusticia, es decir, que se debe levantar el velo
societario siempre que no hacerlo-favorezca una defraudacién o
promueva la injusticia, como seria el-caso en que encontremos
esquemas intencionalmente creados para dejar los beneficios en la
compania matriz, mientras que las obligaciones’' quedan en una
subsidiaria, que por-lo general es'incapaz de satisfacerlas. Como
bien lo dicen Lopez Mesa y José Cesano: “AGn cuando se admita por
via de hipétesis que dos.sociedades estan sometidas a una unidad
de decision o constituyen una unidad economica o grupo de
sociedades, estos no son datos suficientes para prescindir de la
autonomia juridica de’ cada uno de los ;sujetos  societarios
implicados en las actuaciones, en tanto no se alegue y pruebe que
se haya instrumentado las formas juridicas para perjudicar al
demandante en sus derechos, pues lo adecuado es respetar la
separacion patrimonial de la sociedad, en tanto ésta no sea
probablemente el medio de violacién de otras reglas juridicas, ya
que la desestimacion de la personalidad o atribucién de
responsabilidad a personas en -apariencias’ distintas, tiene por
exclusivo fundamento la comprobacién del abuso del privilegio
concedido en detrimento del orden publico o de derechos de
terceros” (Pags. 145 y 146). En este sentido se nota que la parte
actora si ha alegado de manera expresa que Texpet fue una
compafiia instrumentada para mantener las responsabilidades
pendientes sobre una companiia sin capital suficiente, mientras se
mantiene el capital de la matriz libre de responsabilidades, con el
objeto precisamente de evadir las potenciales responsabilidades con
terceros, al tiempo que consta en el expediente abundante
evidencia, como ha sido anotado en lineas anteriores, que
demuestra el profundo nivel de vinculacién y falta de independencia
de la subsidiaria con respecto a su matriz, que fue quien realmente
tomé las decisiones y se beneficié de los actos de su subsidiaria,
quien ademas es incapaz de hacer frente a las potenciales de sus
responsabilidades que se le exijan. Se considera finalmente lo dicho

sitios inspeccionados, y los resultados de esas inspecciones, se
considera que las muestras validas del expediente son
representativas del estado del area de concesién. De este modo con
las consideraciones anotadas, se empieza el andalisis de los
resultados de las muestras tomadas en campo por los distintos
peritos que han actuado en este juicio, haciendo una apreciacion
general de los resultados presentados para Hidrocarburos Totales
de Petréleo (TPHs). Se toma en cuenta que la demandada ha
alegado que el TPH no es un buen indicador de riesgo, al decir que
“Sobre ese mismo tema Senior Presidente, voy a hacer una cantaleta
que ya hice hace unos dias y hace unas cuantas inspecciones
judiciales, relativo a que el contenido de hidrocarburos TPH no
mide la toxicidad ni el riesgo de salud por que los hidrocarburos se
encuentran en la naturaleza, por ejemplo en el pasto con 14 mg/kg
las hojas secas de roble con 18.00 mg/kg, en la aciculas de pino
con 16.000 mg/kg; y muchos productos no tdxicos que son
derivados del petréleo y utilizados por el hombre; tenemos el aceite
para bebés que seguramente muchas personas han utilizado, tiene
865.680 mg/kg de TPH; la vaselina, no la cancién sino la que se
usa para determinados fines, tiene 749.000 mg/kg” (ver foja
155068). Sin embargo en el expediente también encontrados
advertencias en cuanto a los potenciales efectos nocivos de los
TPHs para la salud de las personas, como las del perito Bermeo,
que en las conclusiones de su dictamen nos indica que “ Los
andalisis realizados en el tejido de pescado determinaron la presencia
de hidrocarburos totales en los peces en valores muy por encima de
los maximos permitidos en agua, lo cual al no existir en nuestro
pais referencia o norma que indique o determine la cantidad
maxima en que pueden estar presentes antes de causar problemas
a los peces y por ende a la salud de quienes lo consumen, tomamos
como referencia los valores permisibles para el agua, y desde este
punto podemos manifestar que existe contaminacién por
hidrocarburos; lo cual podria convertirse en un _ problema
alimenticio de seguirse dando. La agencia para Sustancia Téxica y
el Registro de Enfermedades, ATSDR de los EEUU, indica que estos
productos son altamente nocivos para la salud y son el resultado de
una mezcla de diferentes productos derivados del petrdleo como tal
(gasolina, aceites lubricantes, grasas, breas, etc.), por lo que la
presencia de hidrocarburos totales en los pescados son el resultado
de las actividades petroleras que se dan en la zona” (ver fojas
159373 a 159376). Asi también, el perito insinuado por los
demandantes, Edison Camino, ha dicho en ou SSS AERTS:

que “Algunos de los compuestos de los TPHs pueden afectar el

sistema nervioso”, y en que “un compuesto TPH (benceno) es
carcinogénico en seres humanos”

© (52780). De este modo, atendiendo a lo dicho por el perito insinuado
por la parte demandada, Gino Bianchi, en su defensa de la
inspeccién judicial del pozo Lago Agrio 2, respecto a que “El TPH no
se utiliza para evaluar los riesgos potenciales a la salud ya que solo
indica la cantidad de petréleo en la muestra, y no sus
caracteristicas de toxicidad” pero también que “las propiedades
toxicolégicas del petrdleo crudo pueden ser caracterizadas sobre la
base de los siguientes compuestos tédxicos: Hidrocarburos
Aromaticos Volatiles: benceno, tolueno, etilbenceno y xilenos;
Hidrocarburos Aromaticos Policiclicos [...]; Metales pesados: bario,
cadmimo, cobre, cromo, cromo hexavalente, mercurio, niquel,
plomo, vanadio y cinc ” (ver texto en foja 95701, que es idéntico a lo
dicho por el perito Jorge Salcedo en su dictamen de la inspeccién
judicial del pozo Shushufindi.18-y‘en Shushufindi 25, y reiterado
por Gino Bianchi en su dictamen sobre las inspecciones judicial del
pozo Guanta 7), esta Corte ha decidido que lo mas adecuado es que
los TPHs sean considerados en conjunto con las demas evidencias,
pues aunque no fuere un indicador preciso de riesgo para la salud,
es un buen indicador del estado“del.medio ambiente en general en
cuanto a impactos por hidrocarburos, aunque debemos reconocer
que para identificar posibles amenazas ala salud se debe
monitorear la presencia de otros elementos. En este aspecto, de
modo concordante con lo'dicho por € el perito Gino Bianchi respecto a
ciertos compuestos tdxicos, se atiende al informe Yanacuri referidos
en lineas anteriores, en tanto que éste expresa una particular
preocupaci6n que se expresa por la exposicién al benceno, tolueno y
xileno (BTEX), que por su _ solubilidad en el agua, mayor
permanencia en suelo arcilloso, peligrosidad para la salud deben
ser eliminados hasta los niveles cuya presencia sea natural en
suelos. Del mismo modo se atiende este estudio, cuando dice
“numerosos estudios epidemiolégicos realizados en trabajadores de
distintas profesiones han demostrado los efectos carcinogénicos de
los HAPs” (ver foja 3352 y anverso), conocidos como hidrocarburos
aromaticos policiclicos, son contenidos tipicamente en e] agua de
formacién, y aunque no son tan solubles en agua, pueden
permanecer adosados a sdlidos en suspensién y migrar grandes
distancias, inclusive sin degradarse; pero también se considera que
los lodos de perforacién que son utilizados para una variedad de
propésitos, incluyendo controlar la presién subterranea y llevar los
cortes de perforacién a la superficie, aunque pueden variar en
composicion, generalmente contienen metales pesados, asi como el
mercurio, plomo, cadmio, cinc, cromo VI, y el bario. En este orden,
empezaremos refiriéndonos a la presencia de TPHs en los
resultados de las muestras tomadas en suelo por los peritos que
participaron en las inspecciones judiciales, notando que el 10% de

, y 3142 mg/kg, en las muestras tomadas por peritos insinuados por
la parte demandante, ya que los peritos insinuados por la parte
demandada no analizaron este compuesto. En cambio el perito Luis
Villacreces, en muestras tomadas durante las inspecciones del pozo
Auca 1, Cononaco 6, el pozo Sacha 51, y los pozos 18,4 y 7 del
campo Shushufindi, ha presentado resultados que sobrepasan
cualquier criterio de tolerancia razonable, con resultados como
3142 y 466 en Auca 1 en AUO1-PIT1-SD2-SU2-R(220-240 cm)_sv y
AU01-A1-SD1-SU1-R(60-100cm)_sv; 2450 y 876 en Cononaco 6 en
CON6-A2-SE1_sv y CON6-PIT1-SD1-DU1-R(160-260cm)_sv;
154.152,73.6325,70.4021 en Shushufindi 18, en SSF18-A1-SU2-
R(0.0m)_sv, SSF18-PIT2-SD1-SU1-R(1.5-2.0m)_sv; y SSF18-A1-
SU1-R (0.0 m)_sv; el perito José Robalino reporté resultados de
hasta 42.47 en Shushufindi.4;-mientras que el perito Francisco
Viteri report6 34.13 en Shushufindi 7 en SSFO7-A2-SD1-SU1-R(1.3-
1.9)_sv; todo lo cual contribuyéa formar el criterio de esta
Presidencia. El mercurio ha sido considerado:como un posible
agente carcinégenico humano por*la EPA, y~existen multiples
estudios que demuestran los’ efectos ‘dé’ su exposicion, siendo lo
mas preocupantes dafios permanentes al cerebro y rifiones, por lo
que alerta a esta Corte que se hayan. encontrado niveles alarmantes
de mercurio en los campos Sacha,” “Shushufindi, y Lago’ Agrio, en
donde encontramos varias muestras que Negan a los 7 mg/Kg.,
tomadas por los peritos José Robalino en la inspecci6én ‘judicial de
Sacha Central (ver muestras SAC- EST-S1_sv y SAC-PIT1-S1-1_sv);y
SAC-PIT-1-S1-2_sv) y Xavier Grades en Shushufindi 8 y en Lago
Agrio Norte (ver muestras SSFO8-PIT1-S1_sv, SSFO8-PIT1-S2_sv,

SSF08-PIT1-S3_sv, SSF08-PIT2-S11_sv, SSF08-PIT2-S3_SV,

ESTA-C_sv, LAN- ESTB-ASUE1_sv, LLAN-ESTB-ASUE2_sv, LAN-

resultados, que demuestran la-presencia de mercurio en niveles
elevados en muestras de suelo recolectados durante las
inspecciones judiciales, se evidencia una preocupante presencia de
este elemento en los suelos del ecosistema de la concesién. EL
plomo también es encontrado de forma natural en la tierra pero
tiene una bien conocida fama como perjudicial en la salud reflejada
por ejemplo en las crecientes restricciones para el uso de gasolina
con plomo alrededor del mundo, basadas en preocupaciones por la
salud, principalmente en disminuciones de la capacidad cognitiva,
ademas de que es considerado como razonablemente presumible
como agente carcinogénico humano.

muestra JI-SSF-25-PIT2-SD1-(0.0M) tomada por el perito
insinuado por Chevron, Jorge Salcedo, en la inspeccién del pozo
Shushufindi 25, no ha sido suficiente para que estos profesionales
encuentren un riesgo en la salud de las personas. También resaltan
las muestras JI-CO-06-SB4-0.0M y SSF-13-JI-SB1-1.6M_tx,
tomadas por el perito insinuado por la parte demandada, Ernesto

Shushufindi 13, que reportan 98.8 y 98.6 mg/kg., respectivamente.
De modo concordante el perito insinuado por los demandantes,
José Robalino, ha reportado resultados similares en las muestras
SA18-SE3_sv y SA18-NE1l-1_sv, tomadas durante la inspeccién
judicial del pozo Sacha 18, y que alcanzan los 99.89 y 69.93

éste puede irritar gravemente el estomago y la vias respiratorias, y
que existe un consenso cientifico acerca de que el cadmio es de

obtenidas por los peritos John Connor Ernesto Baca en las
inspecciones judiciales de Sacha 6 y Sacha 14, respectivamente, en
las que encontramos resultados superiores a los 2 mg/kg de

Agrio, segin estudios publicados que existen, el agua de
produccién contiene cinco o seis veces menos sal que el agua de
mar, eso no quiere decir que no contengan sal, si la contiene, pero
también en el agua de produccién contiene pequefias cantidades de
petréleo en el tanque ya se separa, por la diferencia de gravedad y
por productos quimicos esas pequefias cantidades de petrdleo, que
generalmente estan entre 20 y 40 partes por millén, insignificantes,
es por eso que en el caso del Consorcio, luego de que el agua de
producci6n era separada en el tanque de lavado se la enviaba a una
o mas piscinas construidas en serie para ser tratadas lograr una
mayor separacién atin de este hidrocarburo, que estaba ahi,
también contiene ciertos metales, no estamos negando, son aquellos
metales que se encuentran naturalmente en el petréleo, en
cantidades también variables, el agua de producci6n que se produce
en la region oriente del Ecuador, como se llamaba a esto, contiene
metales en cantidades que no significan un riesgo para la salud
humana, eso lo han demostrado los analisis del laboratorio que
hemos efectuado en todas las Estaciones que hasta la fecha hemos
inspeccionado y que solicito aqui también como ratificaré en su
oportunidad, se haga”, sin embargo los resultados de las muestras
(ver muestras JI-LA-CENTRAL-PW, tomada por el perito John
Connor, perito insinuado por Chevron, con un contenido de 1.31
mg/kg de bario) contradicen lo afirmado en defensa de Chevron,
respaldando mas bien lo afirmado por los actores, al decir que
“Sabemos por ejemplo que el agua de formacién contiene un 30%
de sal y que obviamente esa sal en exceso , genera los cloruro:
sodio, lo que produce otro tipo de cadena contaminante qu ede
afectar incluso a_ la vegetacién e impide que las raices de las

lantas se desarrollen con normalidad” eer hee
QEREEED Recordamos ademas lo revisado al analizar qué era lo que
podia esperarse de una “buena empresa petrolera”, por lo que se
considera con mucho cuidado el hecho de que ya se habia escrito
importantes advertencias acerca de los peligros del agua de
formacién en 1962, y de hecho se recomendaba que “ El cuidado
extremo debe ejercerse en el manejo y disposicién del agua
producida no sdlo debido al posible dano a la agricultura, sino
también debido a la posibilidad de contaminacién de lagos y rios
que mantienen el agua para beber asi como para propésitos de
irrigacion” (foja 158811), de manera que resulta evidente que no nos
encontramos ante un elemento inofensivo, como lo aseguran los
abogados que ejercen la defensa de la parte demandada. Por el
contrario, como lo afirman los expertos insinuados por Chevron, “
Aunque el agua de produccién no contiene -concentraciones
significativas de componentes tdxicos, esta puede presentar un
dafio potencial a los cuerpos receptores y a la vegetacion debido a

provincias de la Amazonia reportan una cantidad determinada de
casos de muertes relativas a tumores, que pueden estar
relacionadas el cancer que alegan los demandantes, pero para la
provincia de Sucumbios ni siquiera existe una tipologia relacionada
con cancer como causa de muerte, por lo que existe un sesgo
importante en estos datos que no permiten comparar ni apreciar la
realidad que se presenta. Como se vera mas adelante este sesgo se
repite en la mayoria de estadisticas oficiales, debido principalmente
a la falta de presencia estatal en la zona. Con respecto a las copias
certificadas de las paginas 81 y 82, “Cobertura de Saneamiento
Ambiental en el pais y las provincias amazonicas de los ahos 1989 y
1990”, un capitulo del documento anteriormente citado, se toman
en cuenta como indicador estadistico de aquellos rubros que toma
en cuenta en relacién con el saneamiento ambiental, como que la
provincia de Sucumbios tiene-.el total mas bajo de todas las
provincias amazénicas en conexi6n domiciliaria~de agua potable y
también en acceso a grifo ptiblico, lo cual-n ignifica que los
pobladores de estas zonas mo*consumen™. agua, sino que
necesariamente implica que los: habitantes-de estas. provincias
tienen una mayor dependencia de la fuentes dé agua naturales. Se
considera el documento “Situacién de la Salud en el Ecuador,
Indicadores Basicas por regién y por Provincia” Edicion 2000 y
2001. Segtin alegan los demandados, en este documento sé revela
que, a diferencia de lo que afirman los actores, el estado de todos
los cantones y las provincias del’ Ecuador es muy similar, sin
embargo es un hecho conocido, publico y notorio, que no requiere
de evidencia, sino que se deje constancia, como en efecto lo hacen
los datos presentados en “Cobertura de Saneamiento Ambiental en
el pais y las provincias amazoénicas de los ahos 1989 y 1990”, y en
la pagina 14 del documento “ Endemain III” Informe de la Amazonia
capitulo “Caracteristicas de~Vivienda por. Dominio de Estudio”
Cuadro # 3.1, de que las provincias dé Orellana y Sucumbios han
sufrido durante décadas de un-gran abandono por parte del Estado
(el acceso a servicios de salud es inferior, y también es inferior al
acceso a agua potable), dando cuenta de una gran brecha en cuanto
a presencia estatal y necesidades insatisfechas en el ambito de la
salud humana,lo que se ha reflejado en una ausencia casi total de
servicios estatales de salud, impidiendo a los pobladores acceder a
prevencién, diagnéstico ni tratamiento alguno, de manera que es
dificil que pueden llegar siquiera a formar parte de las estadisticas
oficiales, lo cual representa un sesgo importante a ser considerado .

sin embargo, al revisar el documento el juzgador ha
encontrado bajo el titulo: “Algunos Hechos y Cifras de los Problemas
Ecolégico- Ambientales del Ecuador”, en el literal e), el siguiente
texto: “Desordenada e irracional explotacién de los recursos
naturales no renovables. Estas actividades se realizan a nivel
nacional, siendo los caos mas notables y conflictivos los

autorizadas ante la sola presencia de yacimientos sin una

se refleja un altisimo porcentaje del 19% de habitantes/de la
Amazonia que utiliza como fuente de abastecimiento de aun
Rio Lago o Acequia, en comparacién a un 5.7% en las’ demas
regiones (1.3% para la Regién Insular) demostrando mag alla de
cualquier sesgo, la dependencia de los demandantes de la\Amazonia
hacia las fuentes de agua naturales. Con respecto a los

se los tiene en cuenta para
emitir este fallo con las consideraciones anotadas. Se tiene en
consideracién como prueba la publicaci6n realizada por CEPAR “ El
peso de la enfermedad de las provincias del Ecuador- Afos de vida
Saludables perdidos por muerte prématura y ‘discapacidad-Avisa”-
Publicado en Quito , el 10 de Septiembre del 2000,en donde llama
la atencién los datos referentes' a la cantidad de médicos
disponibles por cada 10.000*habitantes,. pues ‘se nota una
disparidad significativa’ ente las. distintas. provincias, como
Pichincha, con 20.9 médicos por cada 10.000 habitantes, y 633
Establecimientos de Salud, y Sucumbios, con 6.8 médicos por
cada 10.000 habitantes, y apenas 38 Establecimientos de Salud. En
segundo lugar, se considera que la publicacién sefiala que “la
agrupacién de enfermedades fue determinada en el estudio de
México por lo tanto para el estudio de las provincias no es necesario
hacer ning&n ajuste”, lo cual llama la atencién porque hay la
posibilidad de que la realidad de todo el territorio mexicano no sea
comparable a la que se vive en las provincias de Orellana y
Sucumbios lo cual no es suficientemente discutido en la
publicacion y podria representar..un importante sesgo en los datos
presentados. Se considera que de los 3 grupos de enfermedades que
agrupan 133 enfermedades, el primer grupo se refiere a las
enfermedades transmisibles, de la nutricion y de la reproducci6n,
que no estarian relacionadas con el objeto de esta litis. El segundo
grupo incluye a las enfermedades no transmisibles, crénicas, y el
tercero se refiere a las muertes por violencia, lesiones accidentales
o intencionales, por lo que nos interesa el segundo, que incluye los
canceres, que contribuyen con el 42.2% del peso de la enfermedad
en el pais (903.561 AVISA), lo que significa una pérdida de 63 afos
de vida saludable por cada mil habitantes. Segan afirma esta

contribuye a probar que este tipo de enfermedades responden a

estudios realizados en humanos referidos por este informe, en su
gran mayoria han demostrado que las poblaciones expuestas
enfrentan un elevado riesgo de efectos graves y no reversibles en su
salud, lo cual, de ser el caso, tiene el potencial de convertirlo en un
importante problema de salud publica. Siendo el objetivo del
estudio, “determinar si la contaminacion del medio ambiente por
las actividades petroleras en el Oriente de Ecuador ha afectado la
salud de la poblacion que vive en las cercanias de los pozos y
estaciones de petréleo”, lo dicho en éste sera aplicable a la
contaminaci6n originada en actividades petrolera, cualesquiera que
sea el actor, consorcio u operador. En términos generales, se
comparé la salud de poblaciones en las cercanias de pozos y
estaciones con la salud de otras poblaciones que viven lejos de esas
instalaciones, y si la contaminacién que. se origina en estos sitios
es un factor contribuyente a esta diferencia. encontrada. En este
estudio se incluye una “evaluacién medio ambiental”, que se hizo en
base a la recoleccién de muestras de agua,~segtin consta del
informe; ante este particular se’ aprecia que las muestras
recolectadas para este informe rio han*sido recolectadas dentro del
proceso judicial, ni por orden de autoridad competente, por lo que
no se las considera como fundamento para emitir este fallo, sino
como fundamento del informe. Para efectos de la ejecucién de la
sentencia se toma en cuenta la definicién que hace el informe
respecto a lo que se entendera como “comunidades cotaminadas”,
entendiéndose que son “aquellas comunidades localizadas dentro
de un area de 5 km, alrededor de un pozo o estacion petrolero,
siguiendo el rio a favor de la corriente”. Este estudio es tomado en
consideracién (juntamente con los posibles sesgos) porque los pasos
seguidos comportan una metodologia que esta Corte considera
apropiada en un estudio epidemiolégico con.el objetivo propuesto,
dado que el objetivo de la epidemiologia ¢s estimar la frecuencia y
distribucién de las enfermedades en las poblaciones, e investigar la
asociacién entre determinadas exposiciones y la ocurrencia de una
enfermedad, atin a pesar de que el estudio de campo se realizo
entre los meses de noviembre de 1998 y abril de 1999, mucho
de que este juicio inicie or ende sin la intervencién de la Corte.

       
 
 

sin embargo, puede
afirmar que “las mujeres que viven en la cercania de pozos y
estaciones de petrdéleo presentan un peor estado general de salud
que la mujeres que viven lejos de estos pozos y estaciones”,
anotando que “ hay una serie de razones que sugieren que la
contaminacién proveniente de pozos y estaciones de petrdleo es la

dice en su testimonio que lo financié la fundacioén Proteus (foja
2147), pero a esta Corte llego un exhorto tramitado con informacion
de dicha fundacién que desmiente este testimonio (ver foja 156033),
lo cual resulta inconsistente y le resta valor a dicho informe, pues
no ha quedado clara su procedencia. Con esta apreciacién se
considera que en la encuesta constan recogidos varios testimonios
donde se reporta afecciones a la salud desde fojas 272, hasta foja
611, sin embargo, es correcta la apreciacion que hace la parte
demandada en su impugnacion a dicho Informe, en el sentido que
para que un testigo pueda ser tomado como tal debe rendir su
testimonio ante funcionario administrativo, judicial o consular
competente, luego de rendir su juramento de Ley. Sin embargo se
advierte que la informacién recogida en este informe, aunque ha
sido inapropiadamente llamada “testimonio”, no es tal, pues

que es usada para cocinar, beber, bafiarse, lavar ropa y para
animales. Por estas causas la presencia de enfermedades

de los autores de este informe, dice en su testimonio

 
   
 
 
 
 

 
  
 

Este testigo asegura que
sin embargo la impugnacion de la parte demandada contra
esta prueba acusa de falta de imparcialidad a sus autores, lo cual
parece comprobarse con el mismo testimonio, en el que su autor
admite haber sido contratado por el Frente de Defensa de la
Amazonia, lo cual pudo haber afectado su objetividad. Por lo
expuesto, esta Corte no asume este informe como prueba efectiva
de los hechos que contienen, sino que constituyen en indicios a ser
considerados en conjunto con los demas. Finalmente, con respecto
a dafios a la salud de las personas, se advierten que ninguno de
estos dafios o afectaciones a la salud humana han sido
demostrados de manera casuistica, es decir, no se han probado
puntualmente la existencia de dafios identificados sobre la salud
de personas particulares, sino que lo que ha quedado demostrado
epidemioldgicamente es la existencia de dafios a la salud publica. Al
respecto de la falta de prueba de dafios a la salud de algun
individuo en particular, esta Presidencia observa que es correcta la
apreciacion de la parte demandada en el sentido de que no se han
presentado certificados médicos que demuestren la existencia de
algun dafio o lesion o la salud de alguna persona determinada, por
lo que para resolver se considera en primer lugar que no se ha
demandado la reparacién de lesiones particulares, sino que la
pretension de la demanda en el tema de salud es “La contratacién a
costa de la demandada de personas instituciones especializadas
para que disefien y pongan en marcha un plan de mejoramiento y
monitoreo de la salud de los habitantes de la poblaciones afectadas
por la contaminaci6n” (foja 80), por lo que la prueba aportada no
necesita referirse a dafios particulares, sino a afectaciones a la
salud publica, de manera que no es relevante el hecho cierto de que
no se han probado lesiones o dafios en particular; y en segundo
lugar, que la pretensi6n citada guarda coherencia con el objeto de la
demanda, que es la reparacién de dafios ambientales, que como se
ha visto, son aquellos causados en el medio ambiente o en alguno
de sus componentes, de manera que lo que compete analizar es la
existencia de dafios a la salud publica y si es que estos tienen
relacion directa con los impactos ambientales reportados y cuya

sefiora declara cémo acostumbraba caminar sobre el crudo regado )
en las carreteras y como las aguas a veces se mezclaban con algo .
que la testigo Hama “crudo”, que ella “lavaba y continuaba igual
como que eso era que ya quedaba normalmente liquida el agua”,
quien afirm6é ante la Corte que hace pocos meses le han detectado
cancer. También en esta inspeccién judicial, el sefior José Holger
Garcia Vargas, quien dijo tener a su esposa postrada en cama y
culp6 a la contaminacion del rio por el sufrimiento suyo y de su
esposa, afirmé ademas que utilizaba el agua del rio “porque en ese
tiempo no habia de donde tomar agua, del rio ocupabamos y nos
banabamos y lavabamos, y es por eso que en el cuerpo le ha pegado
a uno hongos que hasta la vez no se ha podido curar con ninguna
medicina’, declaracién que es particularmente ilustradora para esta
Corte sobre la dependencia de estas personas a las fuentes
naturales de agua que fueron impactadas por los vertimientos de
Texaco. Luego, Gerardo Plutarco Gaibor, durante la inspeccién
judicial de la Estacion Aguarico (fojas 82595-82642) quien dice
estar en la zona desde 1979, afirm6 en la misma inspeccién que : “
nosotros llegamos en este tiempo, por este estero corria bastante
agua turbia, obscura y era bastante salada, yo tenia una casita,
bajando de aqui al margen izquierdo, en la cual ahi me radique con
mi esposa y mis dos hijas que tenian en ese entonces. Entonces las
nifas bajaban a banarse a tomar esa agua y se enfermaban, en la
cual tenian que les daba fiebre tifoidea, hongos, y también a
nosotros porque nosotros no sabiamos que era agua contaminada y
nos banabamos”, declaracién que contribuye a probar que se
trataba de aguas de uso humano y que los vertimientos a cargo de
Texpet sometieron a una exposicién indebida a las personas que
las utilizaban. El sefor Gaibor ademas afirmé y demostré al
Presidente de la Corte las huellas de su enfermedad, como se
aprecia en el acta que dice “ yo tengo enfermedades, como vera
senor Presidente en estas fotos, aqui hay hongos en la piel de mi
esposa, aqui estoy en la parte posterior del lado de mi, esta es mi
barriga, son anos, desde tiempo, y hasta la vez eso ha seguido
contaminado en la piel, y todavia tengo aqui en la canilla, sigo
afectado, no es que me he sanado. Esto es de aproximadamente 20
anos atras. Sigo con esas infecciones en la piel sefior Presidente.

como la ve ahi, es de donde viene inspeccionando el tubo, y caia

donde pobladores de la zona han coincidido en narrar estas mismas
formas de contacto, como por ejemplo Encontramos la declaracion M
de Amada Francisca Armijos Ajila en Conocaco 6 (ver acta en fojas
123088 a 123123), acerca de “como no sabiamos seguiamos
utilizando el agua hasta que llegé el tiempo que mi esposo se
enfermo y el murié el afo 2002”, de manera similar el senor José
Segundo Cordova Encalada, en Sacha Sur (ver acta en fojas 97512
a 97585), declar6 que “ Ahora, por qué mi familia de enfermo?
Porque caminabamos a pie, ya que no somos ricos mas o menos a
las doce del dia, la naturaleza de aqui y el clima hacia que eso
humeara en la carretera, lo que origino que muchos hombres de
estas comunidades sufran de medio cuerpo para abajo y las
mujeres les dio cancer por partes que fecundaba el cuerpo cogian
aspiraciones y eso era de la pura contaminacién yo no soy
conocedor en el arte del petréleo pero creo les afectaba ese fluido
como de candela que cogian en el cuerpo”; aparte de esto, como lo
habiamos anotado , a fojas 97539 consta que “El testigo
manifiesta que un tio hermano de su padre vino sano de la
provincia del oro y tomaba agua aqui no mas, tio le decia yo ya
conozco un poco no tome esa agua pero el seguia tomandola y al
afio mas o menos ya se sintid mal con quemazones en el est6mago”
Gerardo Plutarco (fojas 82595-82642) también indic6é que “por este
estero corria bastante agua turbia, obscura y era bastante salda, yo
tenia una casita , bajando de aqui al margen izquierdo, en la cual
ahi me radique con mi esposa y mis dos hijas que tenia en ese
entonces. Entonces las nifias bajaban a bafiarse a tomar es agua y
se enfermaban, en la cual tenia que les daba fiebre tifoidea, hongos,
y también a nosotros porque nosotros no sabiamos que era agua
contaminada y nos banabamos”, de igual modo que el sefior José
Holger Garcia Vargas, en la estacién Aguarico (ver acta en fojas
82595-82642) quien dijo que utilizaba el agua del rio “ porque en
ese tiempo no habia de donde tomar agua, del rio ocupabamos y
nos bafabamos y lavabamos”, todo lo cual da cuenta de distintas

 

formas de exposicion, a lo cual debemos agregarle lo dicho por el
perito Jorge Bermeo, referido en lineas anteriores, en relacién al
riesgo de que estos elementos entren en la cadena tréfica. Dicho|5 44,
esto, en relacién a los impactos sufridos en la salud de las personas lpedidas por

decir que ya estaban contaminados. Eso era con los pequefios

bagres y con los bagres grandes también”. Durante esta misma Ng

inspeccion, Gerardo Plutarco Gaibor, quien dice estar en la zona

desde 1979, afirmo que : “ Y lo mismo venimos con unas pocas

cabezas de ganado, que bebian esa agua y malparian, se secaban y

morian, se murié el ganado, se murié todos los animales porque

ingerian esta agua, sefior Presidente”. También se considera la

declaracion de Anselmo Abad Vasquez, en foja 79715, brindado

durante la inspeccién judicial de Shushufindi 21, donde sefala que

“ Si, yo tenia ganado, todo esto era puro potreros, todavia se ven

residuos de hierba, a mi el ganado se me enfermaba, tenian unas

llagas que no es el conocido Tupe y todo eso asi, no se curaban por

mas que yo les trataba, aqui sufrimos de falta de veterinarios, pero

preguntando al uno y al otro no habia posibilidad de curarlos, se

flaqueaban y morian, luego nos dimos cuenta que era por la

contaminacion del agua, yo optaba por buscar vertientes y hacer

pozos para que el ganado toma ahi el agua no de los rios, hasta

ahora nadie puede tomar el agua de los rios.” Esto es concordante

también con lo dicho en la declaracién de Maximo Celso, en foja

41659, en la inspeccién judicial de Lago Agrio Norte, afirm6o que “

Aqui tenia una chanchera, de donde la cual perdi todos mis

chanchos, ciento veinte chanchos, de los cuales habia treinta

puercas que producian, desde que Texaco comenzé a botar el agua

para este sector”, y que “ En ese entonces yo cultivaba café. En

medio del café tenia una bananera que tenia una chanchera, y

perdi todos mis animales, porque desde ese momento el agua de

formacion era continuamente. La parte que cruzaba para botar el

agua de formacién era por este lugar. Nos decian que era

saludable, que era buena hasta para tomar. Y yo confiadamente no

saque a mis animales, porque yo estaba seguro de eso. Cuando los

animales, cuando las puercas parian, se quedaban con el Utero

afuera; yo consulté con el médico y me dijo que eso era problema

de una contaminacién gravisima”. También el sefior Simén José

Rogel Robles, fue examinado durante la inspeccién judicial de Lago

Agrio Norte (foja 41632-41693), y declaré que “: Yo y mi familia me

dedicaba a la agricultura y la ganaderia porque todo era potrero

por donde venimos caminando hasta alla, entonces tomaban esa

agua el ganado y para nosotros ya no servia el ganado porque se

ponia raquitico, practicamente nosotros perdiamos, o se caia ahi se

bafiaban en petréleo, y tocaba en medio, medio, medio bafiarlas

venderlas.” En la
la sefora Aura Fanny Melo Melo, sostuvo que “Yo aq

THE FORENSIC ISSUES

A: Introduction

On 20 and 21 May 2014, Ms Kathryn Owen, the Tribunal-appointed expert, travelled to
Quito, Ecuador together with the Secretary to the Tribunal, Mr Martin Doe, and
representatives of both Parties. Ms Owen made forensic images of two computers that
had been identified by the Respondent as having been used by Judge Zambrano during
the Lago Agrio Litigation (the “Zambrano Computers”). Identical copies of the forensic
images of the Zambrano Computers were provided to Mr Lynch (of Stroz Friedberg)
and Mr Racich (of Vestigant), the forensic expert witnesses appointed by the Claimants

and the Respondent respectively in this arbitration.

These forensic images were collected and held, initially, by the Parties in strict
confidence by order of the Tribunal. This order was respected by both the Claimants
and the Respondent. Given the timing, these forensic images played no part in the RICO

trial held in New York in October-November 2013.

Mr Lynch prepared a second report on the Zambrano Computers dated 15 August 2014
(“Lynch ER 2”). Mr Racich produced his analysis of the Zambrano Computers and his
response to Lynch ER 2 in his second report dated 7 November 2014 (“Racich ER 2”).!
Both expert witnesses filed third reports, on 14 January 2015 (“Lynch ER 3”) and 16
March 2015 (“Racich ER 3”).

At the Track II Hearing during their oral testimony, both experts gave short
presentations and were cross-examined by the adverse Party(ies).7 Ms Owen attended
that part of the Track II Hearing (Days 5 and 6); but she did not give oral or written
evidence before the Tribunal then or later, apart from her Final Report and Revised Final

Report of 5 February 2016 and 3 June 2016.

' Mr Lynch and Mr Racich had previously filed first expert reports that addressed Dr Guerra’s computer and other
electronic media.
2 The transcript of their oral evidence is at D5.935 to D6.1284 of the Track II Hearing.

In accordance with Procedural Order No. 40, Ms Owen considered the expert reports
and oral testimony of Mr Lynch and Mr Racich, in order to identify: (i) any material
points on which there was common ground between the technical testimony and
conclusions of Mr Lynch and Mr Racich; (ii) any material points on which there was a
difference between their technical testimony and conclusions; (iii) whether the
differences arose from a difference in forensic analysis or whether they were attributable
to non-technical facts; and (iv) any material conclusions put forward by Mr Lynch or

Mr Racich which she would not characterise as matters of forensic analysis.*

Ms Owen subsequently produced a draft report dated 18 December 2015, which was
circulated to the Parties, but not to the Tribunal. This draft formed the basis for
discussions between Ms Owen, Mr Lynch and Mr Racich in The Hague on 12 January
2016. In accordance with Procedural Order No. 40, Ms Owen’s Final Report was

circulated to the Parties and to the Tribunal on 5 February 2016.

In accordance with Procedural Orders No. 404 and No. 41°, the Parties submitted written
comments on Ms Owen’s Final Report on 4 March 2016.° These comments’ were
transmitted to Ms Owen, pursuant to Procedural Order No. 42.* Further correspondence

from the Parties was sent to Ms Owen in April and May 2016.?

Following further consultation between Ms Owen, Mr Lynch and Mr Racich, on 3 June
2016 Ms Owen provided her final written responses on the Parties’ comments and a

Revised Final Report.

In accordance with paragraph 4 of Procedural Order No. 44, the Parties each filed (i)
submissions on the significance of Ms Owen’s Revised Final Report on 13 August 2016;

and (ii) their reply submissions on 26 August 2016.

The Parties indicated to the Tribunal that they did not seek to examine Ms Owen at an

oral hearing, pursuant to Article 27(4) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. !° In

Procedural Order No. 46, given the Parties’ joint decision, the Tribunal confirmed that
it had decided not to question Ms Owen of its own motion also pursuant to Article 27(4)

of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.!!

In compliance with the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal has received no

private advice from Ms Owen.
B: Summary of Forensic Evidence

Overall, it appears to the Tribunal from the expert reports and oral testimony of Mr
Lynch and Mr Racich, and from the Revised Final Report of Ms Owen, that there are
few, if any, material differences between the expert witnesses in relation to the forensic
evidence that was retrieved from the Zambrano Computers, as distinct from their
respective forensic opinions inferred from such evidence. The various points of
disagreement between the expert witnesses arise from significant differences in the way

in which Mr Lynch and Mr Racich have approached and interpreted that evidence.

In particular, there appears to have been a fundamental difference in the overall focus
of the two experts, based upon their respective terms of reference. Mr Lynch’s analysis
(for the Claimants) appears to have been directed primarily at the question whether the
available forensic evidence is consistent with Judge Zambrano’s testimony at the RICO
trial on his drafting of the Lago Agrio Judgment. '* Conversely, the focus of Mr Racich’s
analysis of the forensic evidence (for the Respondent) was directed at the possibility, or
probability, that a third person or persons did not “ghostwrite” the Lago Agrio

Judgment.
C: Judge Zambrano’s Two Computers

Judge Zambrano was issued with two Hewlett Packard (“HP”) computers. The first
(serial number MXJ64005TG) was manufactured and shipped by HP in 2006 (“the Old
Computer”). The second (serial number MXL0382C3D) was manufactured in 2010 and

1! Procedural Order No. 46, para A.

2 See Lynch ER 2, p. 7, where Mr Lynch concluded that “Jn summary, the totality of the available forensic
evidence is inconsistent in all material respects with Mr Zambrano’s testimony describing how the drafting of the
Ecuadorian Judgment occurred on the New Computer.”

'3 See Racich ER 2, p. 3, where Mr Racich noted that “In my professional opinion, the evidence is more consistent
with Mr Zambrano and his assistant writing the Judgment than it is with a third party writing the Judgment and
giving it to Mr Zambrano for issuance at the beginning of February 2011.”

purchased by the Judicial Council of Ecuador in November 2010 and available to Judge

Zambrano from 26 November 2010 (‘‘the New Computer”). !4

It will be recalled that the periods here under consideration are (i) from 21 October 2009
to 11 March 2010 and (ii) from 11 October 2010 to 4 March 2011 during which Judge
Zambrano presided over the Lago Agrio Litigation. He issued the Lago Agrio Judgment

and its Clarification on 9 February and 4 March 2011 respectively.

Windows XP was installed on the Old Computer on 14 July 2010. Mr Lynch (with Stroz
Friedberg) found evidence of files and folders that pre-dated 14 July 2010, which
indicated that the Old Computer had contained a prior installation of Windows. On 14
July 2010, a significant amount of data was copied to the Old Computer, including 2,428
Microsoft Word documents. This data included files relating to the Lago Agrio
Litigation. In Mr Lynch’s view, this instance of bulk copying, combined with the
evidence he had found of files and folders from a previous installation of Windows, was
consistent with the reinstallation of the operating system, possibly as part of trouble-

shooting or maintenance. '>

The registered user name of the Old Computer at all times prior to March 2011 was
“CPJS”.!® Consequently, files saved using the Old Computer had the author or last saved
name “CPJS”.!7

The first user account, named “HP”, was created on the New Computer on 25 November
2010. Files saved by the New Computer had the author or last saved name “HP”.!* The
first apparent use of this account was on 7 December 2010. There was no evidence of
any bulk transfer of documents to the New Computer prior to the issuance of the Lago

Agrio Judgment on 9 February 2011.'°

D: The Development of the Lago Agrio Judgment’s Text

Mr Lynch (with Stroz Friedberg) carried out searches on the Old and New Computers

for words and phrases from the Lago Agrio Judgment. On the Old Computer, Mr Lynch

identified multiple copies of two files — “Providencias.docx” and “Caso Texaco.doc” —
which contained text which was also found in the Lago Agrio Judgment.”° Subsequent
versions of the “Providencias.docx” and “Caso Texaco.doc” files were subsequently
saved on the Old Computer.7! No documents containing text of the Lago Agrio

Judgment were recovered from the New Computer.7

The distinction between the date of a document’s first creation, and the date(s) on which
it is subsequently saved, is important. The two expert witnesses agree that the earliest
recoverable instance of “Providencias.docx” was created on the Old Computer on 11
October 2010.7° (On that date, 11 October 2010, Judge Zambrano formally resumed his
role as the presiding judge hearing the Lago Agrio Litigation). The experts were not
able to recover a version of “Providencias.docx” which had been last saved on or around
11 October 2010. Accordingly, they were unable to analyse the content of the document

as it stood when it was created.”

However, Mr Lynch noted that early versions of “Providencias.docx” contained a
separate section of text, not related to the text of the Lago Agrio Judgment. He searched
for this section of text and found it replicated in a document called “Providencias.doc”,
which had been transferred to the Old Computer as part of the bulk transfer that had
occurred on 14 July 2010. 25 Tt is not known, however, whether this document
“Providencias.doc” contained any Judgment text at the time it was transferred to the Old
Computer or at the time that it was used to create “Providencias.docx”. (As at 14 July
2010, Judge Zambrano was not assigned to hear the Lago Agrio Litigation: it remained

before Judge Ord6fiez since 12 March 2010).

The 21/12 Providencias: The earliest version of “Providencias.docx” that the experts
were able to recover was dated 21 December 2010 (‘‘the 21/12 Providencias”). Between
11 October 2010 and 21 December 2010 (a period of 71 days), the 21/12 Providencias

was saved 286 times and had been open for approximately 35 hours.”° The Tribunal

notes that the 21/12 Providencias copied text from the Unfiled Moodie Memorandum

and the Unfiled Erion Memorandum (both citing foreign, English language materials).

The 21/12 Providencias contained 42% of the final text of the Lago Agrio Judgment

) 27

(about 80 pages, over pages | to 107 of the Judgment and 94% of its text was

unchanged in the Judgment.”*

Mr Racich calculated that this would equate to a work
rate of approximately 1 page per day during this period, if the work were evenly spaced.
Mr Lynch, however, noted that, during this period, the 21/12 Providencias had been

open for approximately 35 hours (the edit time).”?

Focussing on the edit time, Mr Lynch calculated that the text of the 21/12 Providencias
would be typed at a much higher rate of approximately 26 minutes per page.*” Mr
Racich agreed, in cross-examination at the Track II Hearing, that, if it was assumed that
someone was typing the document during every minute that it was open during this

period, it followed that the text was entered at a rate of less than 30 minutes per page.*!

Mr Lynch testified in his second report that the 21/12 Providencias contained formatting
differences which were consistent with text having been copied and pasted from other
documents. > Mr Racich does not appear to contest that there were formatting
differences in this document (although, as discussed below, Mr Racich does not accept
that this evidence is necessarily consistent with text being provided to Judge Zambrano

by third persons).**

The 28/12 Providencias: The next recoverable version of “Providencias.docx” was a
version that was last saved on 28 December 2010 (“the 28/12 Providencias”). Again the
two experts appear to agree on the metadata of this version of the document; but they
interpret it in different ways. Mr Lynch found that between 21 and 28 December 2010,
the 28/12 Providencias was saved 29 times and was open for approximately 17.5 hours.

He further testified that this version of the document contained 66% of the final text of

2” Lynch ER 2, p. 24.

28 Racich ER 2, para 13 suggests the text at this stage was 78 pages long. Lynch (Track II Hearing D5.950) puts it
at 81 pages.

the Lago Agrio Judgment (over pages | to 154 of the Judgment).*4 96% of its additional

text was unchanged in the Judgment.

6.27. On this basis, Mr Racich calculated that 45 pages had been added to the 28/12

Providencias in this period at a rate of approximately 7 pages per day.*°

6.28 Again, Mr Lynch pointed out that this calculation did not take account of the edit time:
given that the document was only open for 17.5 hours during this period, the additional
text would have been added at an average rate of 27.5 minutes per page.*° That
calculation assumes that someone was typing text into the document for every single

minute that the document was open during this period.*”

6.29. Mr Lynch noted that this document, like the 21/12 Providencias, contained formatting
differences that were, in his view, consistent with text having been copied and pasted
from other sources.** Mr Racich suggested that it was likely that part of this additional
text “originated in another document on Mr Zambrano’s computer, and that the user
copied that text into the Providencias document.” However, Mr Lynch analysed the
Microsoft Office Session logs (“the OSession Logs”) to assess how long Microsoft
Word had been active.*? The OSession logs indicate that, in the period between 21
December and 28 December 2010, Microsoft Word was active for 18.3 hours — that is
just 52 minutes longer than the time for which the 28/12 Providencias was open.*° In
cross-examination at the Track II Hearing, Mr Racich accepted that the OSession logs
indicated that, if someone had been working on any different document on Judge
Zambrano’s computers during the period between 21 and 28 December 2010, they had

done so for less than an hour.*!

4! Track II Hearing D6.1252-1253 (Racich). Mr Racich commented that the OSession logs could be incomplete,
although he agreed that they would only be incomplete if something — such as a crash on Microsoft Word — had
happened. In his third report, Mr Racich suggested that there were a number of reasons why the OSession logs
might not be accurate, for instance if the programme crashed, the power went out or if Word froze (Racich ER 3,
para 20).

In his third report, Mr Lynch also explained that he had searched all the instances of
“Caso Texaco.doc” for any of the text that was added to the 28/12 Providencias and did

not find any of that text.*?

The 19/01 Caso Texaco: The next document containing Judgment text, which Mr Lynch
was able to recover, was a document named “Caso Texaco.doc” (“the 19/01 Caso
Texaco”). This document had been created on 20 October 2009 and last saved on 19
January 2011.*3 The 19/01 Caso Texaco contained 11% of the text of the Lago Agrio
Judgment (over pages 154 to 178). 97% of its additional text was unchanged in the

Judgment.

Neither the previous recoverable version of “Caso Texaco.doc” (last saved date 5
January 2011) nor the subsequent recoverable version (last saved date 4 March 2011)
contained any text of the Lago Agrio Judgment. The 19/01 Caso Texaco had been saved
16 times and had been open for approximately 11.5 hours since 5 January 2011.** This
version of “Caso Texaco.doc” was last saved on the Old Computer.* However, Mr
Racich emphasised that other versions of “Caso Texaco.doc” were opened and edited

on both the Old and New Computers.*°

Mr Racich suggested that the forensic evidence relating to the 19/01 Caso Texaco was
consistent with a person copying text from that document and pasting it into the draft of
the Lago Agrio Judgment (i.e. “Providencias.docx”) some time before 19 January
2011.47 Mr Lynch, however, noted that none of the Judgment text found in the 19/01
Caso Texaco was added to the 28/12 Providencias** (although for the reason elaborated
below, there is no evidence to indicate whether or not the text from the 19/01 Caso
Texaco was added to “Providencias.docx” between 28 December 2010 and 19 January

2011).

In cross-examination at the Track II Hearing, Mr Lynch accepted that Judge Zambrano’s

computers contained documents in both Bookman Old Style and Times New Roman

fonts and that the blocks of text in “Providencias.docx” could have been cut and pasted
from another document on Judge Zambrano’s computer.*? However neither expert was
able to shed any light on where the cut-and-pasted text may have come from. Mr Racich
emphasised that there was no forensic evidence to suggest that any version of the 21/12

Providencias was provided to Judge Zambrano by a third person.*°

21/01 Providencias: On 21 January 2011, “Providencias.docx” was saved using the
“saved as” function, which reset the edit time and revision count (“the 21/01
Providencias”). There was no recoverable temporary file showing the document’s
content at that date>! Accordingly, it was not possible for either expert to determine how
many changes were made to the document during the period from 28 December 2010

to 21 January 2011, or for how long it was edited during this period.**

The Lago Agrio Judgment: As already indicated, the Lago Agrio Judgment was issued
by Judge Zambrano on 14 February 2011. No final draft of the Judgment was found on

the Zambrano Computers.

The 04/03 Providencias: The earliest recovered version of any document containing all
of the Judgment text was a version of “Providencias.docx” found on the Old Computer,
which had been last saved on 4 March 2011 (“the 04/03 Providencias”).** As well as
the text of the Lago Agrio Judgment, it contains the Clarification Order issued on 4

March 2011.

Mr Lynch suggests that it is odd that no “final” draft of the Lago Agrio Judgment was
recovered before 14 February 2011. He testified that, in the context of a document which
has ostensibly taken many months of work, “it is common, based on my experience, for
someone to create a backup copy or to save the final copy as a new ‘final’ version of the
document, particularly before using the same file to create other documents (as is the

case with Providencias).”*+

However, as Mr Racich pointed out, this factor is not conclusive: “The fact that no
backup of the Judgment dated 14 February, 2011 can be found on the Zambrano hard
drives shows that Mr Zambrano may not have followed best practices to protect his

work. In my experience, this is not evidence of ghost-writing.”>>

Between 21 January and 4 March 2011, the 04/03 Providencias had been saved 124
times and had been open for approximately 58.3 hours. This version of the document
contained 99%*° of the final text of the Lago Agrio Judgment, together with a further

24 pages comprising a version of the Clarification Order.*”

In the light of this evidence, Mr Lynch concluded that the forensic evidence was
inconsistent with Judge Zambrano’s testimony in the RICO Proceedings, namely that
the Lago Agrio Judgment was typed by himself and Ms “C”, exclusively on the New

Computer.**

Mr Racich disagreed with Mr Lynch. He explained that the hard drive of the Old
Computer was “mapped” on the New Computer. As a consequence, a user of the Old
Computer could access and edit files saved on the New Computer whilst working on the
Old Computer, and vice versa.>? On this basis, so Mr Racich testified, Judge Zambrano’ s
testimony may have been based on a misunderstanding: if he was sitting at the New
Computer, he may have assumed that the files were being saved on to the New
Computer. Mr Racich also indicated that the metadata (the Author and Last Saved
fields) were not conclusive, since no information is stored about which computer saved

the file between its creation and its last save.

Mr Lynch, however, reiterated in his oral testimony at the Track II Hearing that: “*... all

 

of the files with Judgment text were saved by CPJS [the user name of the Old
Computer], showing that someone was using the Old Computer, not the

New Computer.”®! In his third report, Mr Lynch explained: “... all of the ‘several

56 In cross-examination, Mr Lynch accepted that the substance of the 04/03 Providencias was identical with the

Lago Agrio Judgment: the only difference between the two documents

  

is that former is missing the signature and

the heading (Track II Hearing D5.1053).

successive versions’ of Ecuadorian Judgment text contained in Providencias and the
January 19 Caso Texaco document were saved by the Old Computer and not through
any ‘mapping’ by the New Computer. Had any of those versions been saved using the
New Computer the metadata for those versions would reflect that they had been saved

using the New Computer.” ©

In summary, to the Tribunal’s understanding, the forensic evidence which the two

experts were able to extract from the Zambrano Computers indicates the following:

Between 11 October 2010 and 4 March 2011, the recovered files that contained
Judgment text (the 21/12 Providencias; the 28/12 Providencias; the 19/01 Caso Texaco;
and the 04/03 Providencias) were open for a combined total of at least 162.3 hours. It is

not known how long the 21/01 Providencias had been open.

Between 11 October 2010 and 4 March 2011, “Providencias.docx” was saved at least
439 times on Judge Zambrano’s Computers.® Again, it is not known how many times

the 21/01 Providencias was saved.

Between 11 October 2010 and 14 February 2011, Microsoft Word was open for (at least)

198 hours on the Old Computer and (at least) 36 hours on the New Computer.“

The formatting differences in the text are consistent with blocks of text being cut or
copied and pasted into the Lago Agrio Judgment from other documents, but there is no

way of knowing forensically where those blocks of text came from.
E: The “Unfiled Materials”

Mr Lynch, in his first report, testified that the Final Judgment contained text and errors
that did not exist in the laboratory results filed with the Lago Agrio Court but which did
exist in the “Unfiled” Selva Viva Database (being Material No 8 considered in Part V
above).© Dr Leonard’s expert report had further identified blocks of text in the Lago
Agrio Judgment that were identical, or almost identical, to text found in documents

which were not found in documents filed with the Lago Agrio Court (referred to by Mr

® Lynch ER 3, p. 30.

® Racich ER 2, para 10.
“ Lynch ER 3, p. 20.

® Lynch ER 1, pp. 20-30.

Part VI - Page 11

Lynch as “the Plagiarised Documents”, but the Tribunal uses the term “Unfiled

Materials”).

6.50 For his second report, Mr Lynch was asked to identify whether any of the “Plagiarised
Documents” and/or the text and errors from the Selva Viva Database existed on either

of Judge Zambrano’s Computers.

6.51 Mr Lynch generated search terms from the blocks of text identified in Dr Leonard’s
expert report. He then searched the Old Computer and the New Computer using those
search terms, to identify whether such text existed in any documents (other than
documents containing text of the Lago Agrio Judgment). This search only identified a
single Excel file: INDICE DE CUERPOS JUICIO 002-2003.xIsx (“the Zambrano Index
Summary’), which appeared to have some connection with the unfiled January and June

Index Summaries (being Material No 6 considered in Part V above).

6.52 The earliest created copy of the Zambrano Index Summary was found on the Old
Computer. It was copied to the Old Computer on 6 January 2011. However, the last
saved date for all copies of this document was 12 February 2010 (whereas the last saved
date for the January Index Summary and the June Index Summary was January and June

2007 respectively).

6.53 Mr Lynch compared the Zambrano Index Summary with the January and June Index
Summaries examined in Dr Leonard’s expert report. The latter contained five
worksheets, whereas the version found on Judge Zambrano’s computers contained only
the first worksheet. Furthermore, there were notable differences between the version of
the first worksheet found on Judge Zambrano’s computers and the version contained in
the January and June Index Summaries.®’ Mr Lynch also reviewed the Zambrano Index
Summary to see whether it contained all three instances of the text identified as
plagiarised in Dr Leonard’s Report. It contained only the first two instances.°* The
metadata of the three versions of the Index Summaries (i.e. the June and January Index

Summaries analysed by Dr Leonard and the Zambrano Index Summary) indicated that

Part VI - Page 12

6.54

6.55

6.56

6.57

all three share the same Created Date and Author; but the metadata for all other fields

is different.

Mr Lynch therefore concluded, to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, that:

(a) All the versions of the Index Summaries were generated from the same original
document created in January 2007 but were then separately edited (this date long
preceded Judge Zambrano’s first assignment to the Lago Agrio Litigation,

beginning in October 2009);

(b

The Zambrano Index Summary does not contain all of the plagiarised text which

appears in the Final Judgment; and

(c

None of the other plagiarised documents were on either of Judge Zambrano’s

computers.

In his second report, Mr Lynch also searched for data irregularities in the laboratory
results collated in the Selva Viva Data Database. He could not identify any references
to these on either of Judge Zambrano’s Computers, except in documents containing text

from the Judgment.”°

Both the Index Summaries and the Selva Viva Database are Microsoft Excel (electronic)
documents. Mr Lynch therefore analysed the Microsoft “OSession Logs” to determine
whether Microsoft Excel had been used on Judge Zambrano’s Computers. He found that
the OSession Logs record that, between October 2010 to March 2011, Excel was only
used on the Old Computer and was only active for a total of four minutes: for two
minutes on 18 October 2010; for one minute on 4 November 2010; and for one minute

on 31 January 2011.7!

Mr Lynch also considered how long it would have taken to calculate the percentages
which are contained within the Unfiled Selva Viva Database. He concluded that it would
not have been possible, in the four minutes of recorded activity in Microsoft Excel,

either to (i) derive the statistics appearing in the Lago Agrio Judgment from the unfiled

Excel spreadsheets; or (ii) copy the other Excel data from the “Plagiarised Documents”

appearing in the Lago Agrio Judgment.”

In his second report, Mr Racich did not address in depth Mr Lynch’s analysis of the
“Plagiarised Documents”, although he did question Mr Lynch’s analysis of the usage of
Microsoft Excel and, in particular, his reliance on the OSession logs. Mr Racich noted
that Mr Lynch had not provided any evidence to support the assumption that an
OSession log entry is created every time a Microsoft Office product is opened or

whether the logs accurately record Microsoft Office usage.”

In his third report, Mr Lynch reiterated that “None of the Plagiarized Documents that
served as sources of text for the Ecuadorian Judgment were on the Zambrano
Computers”; and that “Mr Racich offers no analysis to account for the source of that

plagiarized text in the Ecuadorian Judgments.” ”*

Mr Racich responded to this criticism in his third report. He explained that he was
informed that documents in the Lago Agrio Litigation were generally not filed
electronically. On this basis, he concluded that there are no “authorship conclusions to
be drawn from the absence of these documents on the Zambrano hard drives. Instead,
the fact that the documents are not present electronically indicates only that Mr
Zambrano did not have electronic copies of the documents. I see no reason why Mr
Zambrano could not have copied these portions of the Judgment from filed, paper copies
of these documents.””> Mr Racich explained that he did not address this point, as he did

not consider it a matter of computer forensics for the two experts.”

Mr Lynch, in his third report, referred to the suggestion (in the Respondent’s
Supplemental Counter-Memorial) that “many additional documents were submitted on
CDs and DVDs.” Mr Lynch analysed the Old and New Computers and found that the
only evidence of a CD or DVD being accessed on either the Old or New Computer
between October 2010 and March 2011 was on 25 November 2010, when a user on the

New Computer opened a disc called “My Disc”.”” Mr Racich concluded, in his second

report, that “My Disc” appeared to be “related to the IT Department’s set up of
Microsoft Office on Mr Zambrano’s New Computer”.”*® Mr Lynch testified that: “There
is no other forensic evidence of access to a CD or DVD between October 2010 and

March 2011 on either of the Zambrano Computers.”””

In relation to the Unfiled Selva Viva Database, Mr Lynch noted in his third report that
the evidence shows that text and statistics from this document were added to
“Providencias.docx” between 21 December 2010 and 28 December 2010. However, the
OSession logs for Microsoft Excel show that Excel was not opened during that period
on either of the Zambrano Computers.*” In this third report, Mr Lynch reiterated his
assessment that “it is not reasonably possible for someone to accurately calculate the
statistics from the Unfiled Selva Viva Data Compilation without having access to the
data in Microsoft Excel or similar spreadsheet or database program.”*! Mr Lynch found
no evidence on the Zambrano Computers of any program (other than Excel) that could
have been used to calculate the statistics. He therefore concluded that “the Unfiled Selva
Viva Data Compilation spreadsheet document from which the text was plagiarized must
have been available to the drafter in electronic form and accessed using Microsoft Excel.
Yet there is no evidence that the Unfiled Selva Viva Database was available on the
Zambrano Computers or that Microsoft Excel was used during the time period this text

was inserted into Providencias.”*

In response to Mr Racich’s criticism about his reliance on the OSession logs, Mr Lynch
stated that his second report had described how and when OSession logs are created, the
data they track and limitations on the analysis of those logs. Mr Lynch testified that he
had performed extensive testing of the log files (with Stroz Friedberg). He appended, as
Appendix | to his third report, an additional discussion of the testing performed by Stroz

Friedberg.*?

In his third report, Mr Racich stated that Mr Lynch’s testing document did not support
Mr Lynch’s conclusions about the amount of time that Office products were open on

Judge Zambrano’s Computers. In particular, Mr Racich observed, it did not explain how

the logs function (or fail to function) in many cases and that the analysis performed by
Mr Lynch did not preclude other scenarios where Office products could have been in

use for a longer period than the logs suggest.**

In response to Mr Lynch’s conclusions that: (i) Microsoft Excel must have been used to
calculate the statistics in the Lago Agrio Judgment and (ii) because there is no evidence
of usage of Microsoft Excel in the relevant period, Mr Racich concluded that the
allegation that Judge Zambrano could not have authored the Judgment was overstated.
Mr Racich testified: “On this evidence, it cannot be said either that the allegedly unfiled
Selva Viva Database is the source of statistics in the Judgment or that Mr Zambrano did
not simply copy those statistics from a former judge’s notes. There may be still other
explanations. All we can say is that the computer forensic evidence we have at present

cannot answer the question.”®°

In his testimony at the Track II Hearing, Mr Lynch agreed that whether or not the
“Plagiarised Documents” were in the court record was not a question of computer
forensics; but he emphasised that the question whether or not someone had used Excel
was a question for computer forensics. He reiterated his opinions that: (i) someone must
have used Excel to calculate the statistics which appeared in the Lago Agrio Judgment;
(ii) the naming and data irregularities were copied into “Providencias.docx” between 21
and 28 December 2010; but (iii) Excel (the program which would be used to open the

database) was not used on either of Judge Zambrano’s Computers during that period.*°

In cross-examination at the Track II Hearing, it was put to Mr Lynch that another judge
at the Lago Agrio Court could have calculated the percentages used in the Lago Agrio
Judgment at an earlier date, given that the Judicial Inspections, from which the data was
taken, had been suspended or completed by the end of 2006. Mr Lynch answered that
he did not know if an earlier judge at the Lago Agrio Court had calculated the
percentages, but he confirmed his expert opinion that, if that had been the case, that
judge would have had to calculate them using a dataset that exactly double and triple

counted the samples in the same way as the Selva Viva Database.*”

6.71

In his cross-examination, at the Track IT Hearing, Mr Racich was asked about possible
explanations for the calculation of the statistics in the Selva Viva Database. In particular,
it was suggested that the calculations might just as easily have been made by Mr Fajardo
as by a former judge of the Lago Agrio Court. Mr Racich confirmed that he did not
know one way or another; and he agreed that it could have been anyone who had access

to an electronic copy of the Selva Viva Database or the calculations.**

At the Track II Hearing,*® Mr Lynch testified that the unfiled Selva Viva Database (in
Excel format) was over 19 columns wide and over 65,000 rows long. It would extend
to thousands of pages if printed in hard copy, and, therefore, unusable in paper form for
any practical purpose. He also testified that it contains peculiar information, naming
conventions, irregularities and statistical factors that appear in the Lago Agrio Judgment
that do not appear in the filed lab results which it purports to compile. Yet, he continued,
the Selva Viva Database could not have been used on the Zambrano Computers to draft
the Lago Agrio Judgment because, according to the Microsoft Office logs, Excel was
only opened for 4 minutes between October 2010 and March 2011. Moreover, it was
not opened at all during the period from 21 December to 28 December 2010 when its
peculiarities were used or copied into “Providencias.docx”. He concluded that it would
not have been possible “for someone to open the Selva Viva Database reference ... and
then reference them while drafting Providencias because Excel is the program that you

would use to open the Selva Viva Database and it was not used.”°°

Also at the Track II Hearing, Mr Racich testified as to the Selva Viva Database under
cross-examination.°! From a forensic perspective, the Tribunal did not understand Mr
Racich to be disputing Mr Lynch’s expert evidence, as summarised immediately above.
In particular, Mr Racich accepted that, whoever drafted the Lago Agrio Judgment, that
person must have had access to an electronic copy of the Selva Viva Database or

calculations derived from its statistical percentages.”

The Tribunal notes that, in his evidence at the RICO trial, Judge Zambrano testified that

he was not familiar with Excel: see Part IV above. It is not known whether his temporary

student secretary, Ms “C”, was familiar with Excel. Even assuming that she was, Excel
data does not lend itself to oral dictation or mental calculation; and any dictation (if
possible at all) could not have been completed within the times found by Mr Lynch
regarding the use of Excel on the Zambrano Computers. Thus, the Tribunal discounts,
on the forensic evidence, any use by Judge Zambrano of the Selva Viva Database in
paper form. Further, the Selva Viva Database did not exist in the Lago Agrio Court’s
record as an electronic file (which the Respondent does not dispute); and yet the author
of the Lago Agrio Judgment must have made use of the Selva Viva Database in
electronic form, as an Excel file, to draft the Lago Agrio Judgment (as both Mr Lynch
and Mr Racich testified). It is therefore impossible for the Tribunal to understand how
Judge Zambrano could have drafted the Lago Agrio Judgment from the Selva Viva
Database, for want of sufficient computer skills and the non-use of Excel on his

Computers.
6.72 Ms Owen recorded that it appeared to be common ground between the two experts that:

(a) There were no documents found on Judge Zambrano Computers that contained text

from allegedly unfiled materials, including the Selva Viva Database;®* and

(b) The data recorded in the Microsoft OSession log files represented the minimum
amount of usage of Microsoft Office applications; and that the data had been

accurately presented in evidence.”

6.73 As to the difference between the two experts’ approach to the presence of the
“Plagiarised Documents” on Judge Zambrano’s Computers, Ms Owen suggested that
this was a difference in factual assumptions: Mr Lynch considered that the absence of
the documents was of significance when considering how the Lago Agrio Judgment
came into being, whereas Mr Racich considered that this merely showed that Judge

Zambrano had no electronic copies of the documents.”

6.74 In relation to the analysis of the use of Microsoft Excel by reference to the OSession
Logs, Ms Owen similarly suggested that the difference of opinion arose out of the two

experts’ perceptions of technical facts. Mr Lynch was of the opinion that the author of

6.78

the Lago Agrio Judgment must have used Microsoft Excel to calculate statistics from
the Selva Viva Database, thereby adding weight to his view that the Judgment could not
have been drafted on Judge Zambrano’s Computers in the manner suggested by Dr
Zambrano. Conversely, Mr Racich concluded that the available forensic evidence could
not answer the source of the statistics and that there were other explanations for the

presence of these statistics in the Lago Agrio Judgment.”°
F: Internet Usage

Mr Lynch’s second report recorded that he had performed an analysis to recover deleted
records and to aggregate all the available Internet History on the Old and New
Computers (with Stroz Friedberg). He identified, on both Computers, usage of Facebook
and other sites related to Ms “C” (Judge Zambrano’s temporary secretary). However,
he did not identify any usage of translation or legal research services in the Internet

History from either computer.””

Mr Racich, in his second report, disputed Mr Lynch’s implication, namely that because
one can recover Internet History and since Mr Lynch found no Internet History to
indicate that legal research or translation websites had been used, then such websites

had not been used in the relevant period.°*

Mr Racich explained that, through normal computer use, Internet History is deleted over
time and the space where that History was stored becomes occupied by new data. If this
happens, the previous Internet History will no longer be recoverable.”” Mr Racich also
suggested, based on his analysis of the “cookies” which remained on Judge Zambrano’s
Computers, that there was more Internet History for the relevant time period that had

been lost due to normal computer use. !°°

Mr Racich found evidence that the website “fielweb.com” had been used between
October 2010 and March 2011; and that this was a website which enabled legal

research.!°! Mr Racich also found that, as early as June 2009, a user of the Old Computer

had visited the translation website “traducegratis.com’”. He explained that the Internet
History from this period included only seven entries for this website. However, these
seven entries indicated that the site had been visited at least 69 times by September
2009. Mr Racich testified that these numbers illustrated his broader point that much of
the Internet History is no longer available.'°? Mr Racich also found evidence that on 4
January 2011 a user of the New Computer accessed “windowslivetranslator.com”.!°
He further noted that there was evidence that Ms ”C” had accessed the Internet many
times from both Computers during the relevant period, albeit that he only found

evidence that she accessed Facebook. !™

Mr Racich also analysed the average number of objects downloaded on particular days
and identified an apparent gap in the recovered Internet History on the Old Computer
between 14 July 2010 and 14 December 2010. He suggested that this could reflect a
lack of Internet usage during this period or it could be (which was more likely in his
opinion) because the Internet History was subsequently deleted and overwritten through

normal computer use. !°°

Mr Lynch responded to these opinions in his third report, stating that: “Mr Racich’s
analysis [of internet usage] does not offer any evidence that is consistent with Mr

Zambrano’s testimony, and his conclusion is unsupported by the evidence.”!°

In particular, Mr Lynch pointed out that:

(a) Mr Racich identified a single legal research website, “fielweb.com”, that had been
accessed via the Zambrano Computers, but the only recoverable Internet History
between October 2010 and March 2011 showed that this website was only accessed
on the Old Computer on two dates: 2 December 2010 and 3 January 2011. Mr
Lynch further noted that Professor Riofrio’s expert report indicated that
“fielweb.com” does not contain any information about the case law from the USA

which is cited in the Lago Agrio Judgment; !”

(b) Mr Racich found forensic evidence that a translation website,
“windowslivetranslator.com”, was accessed from the New Computer. However, Mr
Lynch’s further analysis indicated that this website was visited only once on 4
January 2011. Mr Lynch questioned how a user of the Old Computer could find
international case law on the Old Computer using “fielweb.com” if the New

Computer was used to access the translation service; !°8

(c

Mr Lynch acknowledged that Mr Racich had identified “cookies” which suggested
that other legal research and translation websites had been accessed from the
Zambrano Computers, but emphasised that Mr Racich did not provide any evidence
that these websites had been accessed during the relevant period. Mr Lynch
disagreed with Mr Racich’s suggestion that the evidence in this regard may have
been incomplete because these cookies may have overwritten a previous cookie or
been new cookies. Mr Lynch pointed to Mr Racich’s own evidence that “when as
part of its normal operations the web browser deletes old Internet History, it often
does not delete old cookies even while it deletes entries related to accessing the
website’s files.” Mr Lynch highlighted that the cookies which Mr Racich discussed
are not from the relevant time period, but are from periods before October 2010 or

after March 2011;!° and

(d

Whilst Mr Lynch agreed with Mr Racich that recoverable Internet History can be
limited, he emphasised that a considerable volume of Internet History —
approximately 50,000 records — was recovered from the Zambrano Computers for
the relevant period. Fewer than 10 of these records relate to “fielweb.com” or

“windowslivetranslator.com”,!!°

6.82 In his third report, Mr Racich dismissed Mr Lynch’s comments on Internet History as
irrelevant. In particular, he testified that: “The fact that there is not more evidence of
particular sites in the recoverable history is likely a consequence of the inherent
limitation of the limited history available years after the fact. And the fact that a
particular number of history records (Mr Lynch says 50,000) between October 2010 and

March 2011 were recovered does not tell us what percentage of the ... total that number

represents.”!'!! Mr Racich explained that his conclusion that the recovered history is
necessarily limited is based on, in particular, gaps in the recorded “hit counts” of

particular websites. !!”

In his direct examination at the Track II Hearing, Mr Lynch gave a general explanation
of how Internet History can be recovered. Both experts agree that Internet History
degrades over time, but that cookies are often not deleted even when Internet History
records are deleted. On this basis, Mr Lynch stated that, “... in order for there to be no
evidence of any other legal research Website on Mr Zambrano’s computer, all of the
Internet History records would have had to have degraded, disappeared and been
overwritten such that they’re no longer recoverable and the cookie would have had to

have been deleted and overwritten.” !!

In cross-examination, Mr Lynch reiterated that the cookies which Mr Racich had
identified for websites such as LexisWeb and LexisNexis all post-dated the relevant
period. He rejected the suggestion that Judge Zambrano might have used these websites
previously and that the website might have created a new cookie which replaced the
record of the earlier visits. Mr Lynch explained that, when a website created a new
cookie, generally “the creation date for that cookie would stay from [the first date the
website was accessed] because of a property known as file tunnelling, where if you
create a file in the same location with the same name where a file was recently deleted,

it will adopt the creation date of the file that previously existed.” !'*

Mr Racich, in his cross-examination, confirmed that the only evidence of a visit to a
legal research site which had a date and time stamp within the relevant period was the
“fielweb.com” site.!!5 He stated that he did not know whether “fielweb.com” could be
used to locate the English language cases which were in the 21 December version of
“Providencias.docx” as he had not done any analysis of what documents were available
on that website. !!* In relation to translation websites, Mr Racich confirmed that the only

evidence of visits to “traducegratis.com” was from 2009 and that the visit to

“windowslivetranslator.com” occurred on 4 January 2011, which was after English

language legal authorities had appeared in the December 21 version of Providencias.!!”

Mr Racich was also questioned about visits to a website — “live.com”. He agreed that
this log-in page could be used to access Hotmail. He also confirmed that the hit count
for this website was 14 on 7 January 2011 and had increased to 29 on 13 January 2011.
He agreed that during this period in early January 2011 someone on Judge Zambrano’s
Computers was logging into Hotmail. Mr Racich confirmed that he had not recovered
the contents of any emails that were opened from Hotmail on Judge Zambrano’s

Computers. !!®

Mr Racich agreed that the Internet History recovered from Judge Zambrano’s Old
Computer (as set out in Exhibit 21 of Mr Lynch’s second report) indicated that someone
on that Computer had opened Hotmail at 17.33 on 12 January 2011 and two minutes
later the “Caso Texaco.doc” document was opened on the Old Computer. It was noted
that 19 January 2011 was the date of a recovered version of “Caso Texaco.doc”

containing Judgment text.!!?

Ms Owen highlighted the differences in the conclusions reached by Mr Lynch and Mr
Racich in relation to the recoverable Internet History. Mr Lynch reported that no
evidence of visits to legal research or translation websites was found and concluded that
this demonstrated an inconsistency in Dr Zambrano’s testimony at the RICO trial. Mr
Racich, however, concluded that websites which could have been used for legal research
and language translation were accessed between October 2010 and February 2011. He
also concluded that the Internet History was incomplete, probably due to subsequent
usage of the Computers. Ms Owen explained that, during the meeting with the two
experts at The Hague on 12 January 2016, the two experts had suggested that these
differences in opinion arose out of instructions to them from their respective appointing

Parties.

(a) Mr Lynch had been instructed to research the Internet History for evidence of visits
to legal research and translation websites consistent with Dr Zambrano’s testimony

and the content of the ““Providencias.docx” document; whereas

(b

Mr Racich had been instructed to search for evidence of visits to legal research and
translation websites within the time-frame of October 2010 to February 2011 and
to provide a general account of Internet History and an explanation of why there

might be no evidence.

Ms Owen expressed the view that the difference in these opinions arises out of different
expectations of how much evidence of Internet activity might be recovered in a given

set of circumstances.
G: USB Analysis

Mr Lynch, in his second report, identified 18 USB devices that were known to have
been used on the Old or New Computers between October 2010 and March 2011.!7° He
then reviewed the records of files accessed on both Computers to determine what files
might have existed on the USB devices. He identified 41 files accessed from USB
devices, but noted that the computer records reviewed by him (with Stroz Friedberg)
were not designed to record every single file that was accessed or existed on USB
devices; and that, therefore, many more files could have existed and/or been accessed. 121
Further, Mr Lynch did not have access to the USB devices themselves (nor did Mr
Racich); and therefore he could not know the content of the files or whether any of them
related to the Lago Agrio Judgment.'?? Nonetheless, so Mr Lynch suggested, the
formatting differences in “Providencias.docx” are consistent with having been copied

and pasted from another document, including documents accessed from USB devices. !77

Mr Racich, in his second report, concluded that neither Mr Lynch’s nor his own analysis
revealed any evidence that any Lago Agrio related document was transferred to Judge

Zambrano’s Computers whilst he was drafting the Lago Agrio Judgment. !*4 Mr Racich

emphasised that no forensic evidence showed that USB devices were inserted into either

of Judge Zambrano’s computers between 1 February 2011 and 20 February 2011.!?°

Mr Racich explained that he had performed (with Vestigant) an independent analysis of
all evidence of files opened from USB devices on either the Old or New Computers
between October 2010 and March 2011. This analysis indicated that up to 56 documents
were opened from USB devices in this time period. Mr Racich suggested that a review
of file names and types indicated that the files so opened were predominantly picture
and PowerPoint files, with only a small number of Word files.!2° Mr Racich identified
two copies of the same document, which appeared to be connected to the Lago Agrio
Litigation. Both files had the same name (“PROVIDENCIA CHEVRON TEXACO DE
FECHA 15 DE JUNIO DEL 2010.docx”’) and almost identical metadata. However, Mr
Racich noted that this document appeared to be a Word version of an order issued in
June 2010 when Judge Zambrano was not the presiding judge in the Lago Agrio
Litigation. This document appeared to have been copied to the New Computer on 7

December 2010 via a thumb drive with the volume name “MARIELA”.!?7

In Mr Racich’s opinion, the vast majority (30 out of 43) of the documents and folders
opened from USB devices, as identified by Mr Lynch, appeared to have been opened
from a USB device named “EVELYN” and appeared to be Ms “C”’s personal
documentation. A further four documents were opened from a USB device named
“MARIELA” which indicated that they were from Mariela Salazar, the court secretary.
Three of the 43 documents were from a USB named “My Disc” and appeared to be

related to the IT Department’s set up of Microsoft Office on the New Computer. !7°

Mr Racich noted that the only other instances of documents being opened between
November 2010 and February 2011 from other USB devices related to four documents
and one folder (which were exhibited to Mr Lynch’s second report as Exhibit 7). Mr
Racich pointed out that Mr Lynch had provided no evidence that these documents had

any bearing on the Lago Agrio Litigation. !”°

6.96

The analysis of the USB drives was not taken much further by the two experts in their
third written reports. Mr Lynch criticised Mr Racich for speculating about the contents
of the files on the USB devices, emphasising that, although Mr Racich claimed to have
performed a thorough analysis of all the files on all the USB devices connected to the
Zambrano Computers in the relevant time frame, he had not offered any evidence of
that review; nor claimed that he had had access to any of the USB devices. Mr Lynch
noted that, without examining the actual USB devices, the only evidence Mr Racich had
reviewed was the names of the files and the metadata highlighted in Mr Lynch’s second
report. Mr Lynch stated that Mr Racich’s conclusions as to the content of the files were
therefore mere speculation.'*° Mr Racich did not respond to this criticism in his third

report.

In cross-examination, Mr Racich was pressed on the dates on which USB devices were
connected to Judge Zambrano’s Computers, as set out in Table 23 in Mr Lynch’s second

report. This cross-examination showed that:

(a) The “Providencias.docx” document was created on 11 October 2010 and on the

following day a USB device was connected; '*!

(b

Between 12 October 2010 and 21 December 2010, at least seven USB devices were

connected; !*?

(c

In the period between 21 December and 28 December 2010, two more USB devices

were connected; !33

(a

In the period after 28 December 2010 and 19 January 2011 (when Judgment text
was recovered from the “Caso Texaco.doc” document) a further three USB

connections were made to the Zambrano Computers; 134 and

(e

Table 23 of Mr Lynch’s third report indicates that a further five connections were

made (three from the same device) between 20 January 2011 and 21 February 2011.

Mr Racich confirmed that a person at one of the Zambrano Computers could have
opened a document from one of the USB devices, copied text out of that document and
pasted it into a document which was already on the Computer, closed the document on
the USB device and unplugged the USB device; and that it would then not be possible

to know what text had been transferred. !*°

Mr Racich also accepted that, during the period from October 2010 to February 2011,
13 USB devices were attached to the Zambrano Computers, as Mr Lynch had testified

earlier. '*° Neither Mr Lynch nor Mr Racich had any access to these 13 USB devices.
H: Bulk Copying

As described above, Mr Lynch’s analysis (with Stroz Friedberg) of the Old Computer
found that Windows XP was installed on 14 July 2010. On the same day, a significant
amount of data was copied to the Old Computer, including 2,428 Microsoft Word
documents. This data included files relating to the Lago Agrio Litigation. Mr Lynch’s
view was that this bulk copying, combined with the evidence he had found of files and
folders from a previous installation of Windows, was consistent with the reinstallation

of the operating system, possibly as part of trouble-shooting or maintenance. '7

Mr Lynch also found evidence of subsequent bulk copying of data onto the Old
Computer, in particular in September 2012. This was some five months after Judge
Zambrano had relinquished the Old Computer; and long after he had completed his
assignment to the Lago Agrio Litigation (4 March 2011). On 26 September 2012, 2,202
files were created in a four minute interval and subsequently deleted. Mr Lynch stated
that the bulk copying of files on the Old Computer would have overwritten or destroyed
data on the Old Computer; and that this was consistent with an attempt to overwrite

previously deleted data.'**

Mr Racich, in his second report, somewhat overstated Mr Lynch’s conclusion,
suggesting that Mr Lynch had concluded that “evidence of data copied in bulk to both

the Old Computer and New Computer reveals some deliberate attempt to overwrite

6.102

deleted data on these computers.” '*? In Mr Racich’s expert opinion, the forensic
evidence did not point to data destruction as the likely motive. He explained that,
because it is not possible to know where previously deleted files were stored or to
determine which parts of unallocated space will be overwritten by new data, a person
who is trying to destroy data will typically try to fill up as much unallocated space as
possible; e.g. by copying large files such as movies. '“° By contrast, the bulk copying on
26 September 2012 involved files that consisted mainly of Microsoft Office documents
These files took up less than 1% of the total space on the drive and less than 4% of the

unallocated space. '+!

In his third report, Mr Lynch pointed out that Mr Racich had omitted to mention that
the final action, in relation to the bulk copying carried out on 26 September 2012, was
the deletion of the copied files. Mr Lynch concluded that this forensic evidence was

inconsistent with Mr Racich’s conclusion this activity was a normal backup.'4?

Mr Racich responded that, while Mr Lynch had discounted the fact that only 734 MB
of data was copied, this was a key point in determining whether the copying and deletion
was a deliberate attempt to overwrite data. He reiterated that this data comprised only
4% of the free space on the Computer. This action was therefore unlikely to overwrite
any particular data and would not guarantee that any particular data was overwritten. '47
In response to Mr Lynch’s view that the subsequent deletion of the copied files was a
strong indicator that the user was attempting to overwrite data, Mr Racich noted that it
was not the deletion of the data that overwrote the small amount of unallocated space,
but the prior copying. He noted that there are many possible motivations for a person to
create, fill and then delete a folder; e.g. this may have been a temporary backup; and the

motivation could not be ascertained through forensic investigations. '*+

Ms Owen records that it was common ground between the two experts that, while bulk

copying of data to the Zambrano Computers had the potential to overwrite previously

deleted files, there was no technical evidence which would enable them to determine

the actual motive for the bulk copying in this instance. !4°
I: The Tribunal’s Conclusions

The Tribunal accepts that both Mr Lynch and Mr Racich were honest witnesses, seeking
to assist the Tribunal in good faith consistent with their obligations as expert witnesses.
The Tribunal also acknowledges that both expert witnesses are experienced and
knowledgeable specialists in a specialist and complex field. The Tribunal also owes a

special debt to Ms Owen, a much respected and senior specialist in this field.

For a long time during this Track II phase of the arbitration, it seemed that the forensic
evidence available from Judge Zambrano’s two Computers could provide a definitive
answer to the ‘ghostwriting’ issues, one way or the other. It remains tantalisingly close;
but, to the Tribunal’s regret, there is no such reliable answer from the forensic evidence.
There is no ‘smoking gun’, but rather a mass of complex questions that cannot be
answered on the limited forensic materials made available at the time to Mr Lynch, Mr
Racich and Ms Owen, without much more evidence from other electronic devices

available to Judge Zambrano, Mr Fajardo and others in Ecuador.

Given that the Claimants bear the legal burden of proof on these forensic issues (as with
its other allegations) under Article 24(1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the
absence of such a definitive answer means that the Claimants’ case does not prevail on

the forensic issues by themselves, on a balance of probabilities.

Nonetheless, the Tribunal considers that much useful work was done by the Parties’ two
experts and Ms Owen. The eventual differences between the two experts are more
differences of perspective, also influenced by non-technical factors lying outside their
expert functions in this arbitration and influenced their respective terms of reference
from the Parties. What this this Tribunal can safely derive for this Award from all the
forensic evidence and the forensic expert evidence is therefore less than complete.

However, in the aggregate, it justifies two conclusions by the Tribunal.

45 Owen, Revised Report, para 29.

Part VI - Page 29

6.109

6.110

6.111

First, the account given at the RICO trial by Dr Zambrano as to how he wrote personally
the full Lago Agrio Judgment on his New Computer (with his student secretary) is

inaccurate, incomplete and unreliable.

Second, whilst the forensic evidence alone does not prove, on the balance of
probabilities, that the Lago Agrio Judgment was corruptly ‘ghostwritten’ by one or more
the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives, it is more likely than not that the Judgment
was drafted in material part on a computer or device other than the Zambrano
Computers. By itself, in the Tribunal’s view, the likely use of another computer or
device is not proof of ‘ghostwriting’; but, equally, it is not proof that there was no

‘ghostwriting’.

These conclusions as to the forensic evidence are consistent with the earlier conclusions
reached by the Tribunal in Parts IV and V above that, based on all the evidence available
to the Tribunal in this arbitration (other than the forensic evidence), the Lago Agrio
Judgment was at least in material part ‘ghostwritten’ by certain of the Lago Agrio

Plaintiffs’ representatives, in corrupt collusion with Judge Zambrano.

PART VII

JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY

A: Introduction

The Tribunal here addresses the issues arising from the Tribunal’s disputed
jurisdiction over the Claimants’ claims and the admissibility of such claims under
Articles VI(1)(a), VI(1)(c), 1(3)(a), 11(3)(c) and II(7) of the Treaty, as asserted by the
Claimants and disputed by the Respondent. For ease of reference, where appropriate,

these issues are collectively described as “jurisdictional” issues.

In its Third Interim Award on Jurisdiction and Admissibility of 27 February 2012, the
Tribunal decided that it had jurisdiction over TexPet’s pleaded claims under both
Articles VI(1)(a) and VI(1)(c) of the Treaty, thereby rejecting all objections made by
the Respondent as to jurisdiction over TexPet’s claims: see Paragraph 5.3 of the Third
Interim Award (set out in Annex 1(H) to Part I above), with Paragraphs 4.14ff and
4.31ff. Accordingly, in this Award as explained further below, the Tribunal addresses
the merits of TexPet’s pleaded claims under Articles II(3)(a), II(3)(c) and II(7) of the
Treaty.

In its Third Interim Award, the Tribunal also decided that it had jurisdiction over
Chevron’s pleaded claims under Article VI(1)(c) of the Treaty, with respect to its
‘indirect’ investment in TexPet. The Tribunal there left expressly undecided whether
the Tribunal had any jurisdiction over Chevron’s pleaded claims under Article
VI(1)(a) and also, with respect to any ‘direct’ investment, under Article VI(1)(c) of the
Treaty, thereby joining these issues to the merits. The Tribunal otherwise rejected all
jurisdictional objections made by the Respondent to Chevron’s pleaded claims: see
Paragraph 5.4 of the Third Interim Award (set out in Annex 1(H) to Part I above), with
Paragraphs 4.22ff and 4.38ff.

As regards the Respondent’s extant jurisdictional objections under Article 21 of the

UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal again exercises its powers of

Part VII - Page 1

‘Kompetenz-Kompetenz’ under Article 21(1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules,

forming part of the Parties’ Arbitration Agreement.!

It is necessary first, however, to refer to the material texts of the Treaty and
subsequently to several special features of this case. Whilst the latter are not
exclusively relevant to issues of jurisdiction and admissibility, it is nonetheless

convenient to address them in this Part of the Award.
B: The Treaty

(1) The Treaty: The Tribunal notes that Articles II(3)(a), II(3)(c) and II(7) of the
Treaty, as regards the FET standard, the FPS standard, customary international law
and “effective means”, provide four possible bases for the Claimants’ claims, read
with Articles VI(1)(a) and (c) of the Treaty. The Tribunal addresses each of these

below.
“Investment”: Article I(1) of the Treaty of the Treaty provides (in material part):?

“For the purposes of this Treaty,

(a) ‘investment’ means every kind of investment in the territory of one Party
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by nationals or companies of the other
Party, such as equity, debt, and service and investment contracts; and includes:
(i)...

(ii)...

(iii) a claim to money or a claim to performance having economic value, and
associated with an investment;

(iv)... and

(v) any right conferred by law or contract, and any licences and permits pursuant
to law; ...”

' The term “Arbitration Agreement” is explained above, in Part I of this Award.
? C-279. The relevant provisions of the Treaty are more fully set out, for ease of reference, in Part III(B) above.
The full text of the Treaty (in English and Spanish) is reproduced in Annex 5 to Part I above.

“Investment Dispute”: Article VI(1) of the Treaty provides:*

“For purposes of this Article, an investment dispute is a dispute between a Party
and a national or company of the other Party arising out of or relating to (a) an
investment agreement between that Party and such national or company; ; or
(c) an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect
to an investment.”

 

Investment Protection: Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty provides:*

“Investments shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, shall
enjoy full protection and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment less
than that required by international law.”

“Umbrella Clause”: Article 11(3)(c) of the Treaty provides:>

“Each Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regards to
investments.”

Effective Means”: Article II(7) of the Treaty provides, in material part:°

“Each Party shall provide effective means of asserting claims and enforcing

rights with respect to investments ...”
(2) The FET Standard and Customary International Law: As regards the FET standard
and customary international law in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty, the Tribunal
considers that these two bases, whether together or separately, provide similar
protections against denial of justice. It was decided in Azinian v Mexico, as also in
Mondev v USA,’ that the FET standard in NAFTA Article 1105 included protection
against a denial of justice. However, the FET standard, not being limited to a
protection against a denial of justice, provides a broader protection than denial of
justice under customary international law, both in scope and as to the time when a

choate claim accrues other than for denial of justice (by reason of the principle of

judicial finality applicable to a claim for denial of justice, as considered separately

below).®

Hence, the Tribunal does not need to treat the protection against denial of justice under
customary international law as a separate standard of protection from denial of justice
under the FET standard. It is also unnecessary to do so on the facts of the present case
as found in this Award: a denial of justice under customary international law
necessarily will entail a breach of the FET standard in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty.
Accordingly, references below to denial of justice under the FET standard should be
understood, where appropriate, as referring also to denial of justice under customary

international law.

(3) The FPS Standard: As to the third basis for the Claimants’ claims for denial of
justice, the Tribunal considers that the FPS standard, as provided in the same Article
II(3)(a) of the Treaty, adds nothing material in the present case to the protection
afforded by the FET standard and customary international law. Hence, the Tribunal

does not address further the meaning or effect of this FPS standard.

(4) Effective Means: As to the fourth basis for the Claimants’ claims, the Tribunal
notes that this provision in Article II(7) of the Treaty, as regards “effective means”,
has been invoked by the Claimants and disputed by the Respondent in other

arbitrations under the Treaty, as also in this arbitration.

It was the subject of the UNCITRAL tribunal’s award dated 30 March 2010 between
Chevron and TexPet (as claimants) and the Respondent (as respondent) in the
Commercial Cases Arbitration.? It was also the subject of the Respondent’s claim (as
claimant) against the USA (as respondent) in the Ecuador-USA Treaty Arbitration.'°

That State-State arbitration did not proceed beyond the issue of jurisdiction; and it did

not therefore decide the parties’ disputed interpretation of “effective means” in the

Treaty (by reason of that tribunal’s award dated 29 September 2012).!!

717 The award in the Commercial Cases Arbitration, applying “effective means” as a
protection for Chevron and TexPet under the Treaty, had followed the earlier approach
taken by the tribunal in Duke Energy v Ecuador by its award of 18 August 2008.'? The
award in Commercial Cases was in turn followed, as to “effective means”, by the

tribunal in White Industries v India in its award of 30 November 2011.!%

7.18 In the present case, the Claimants contend that the Treaty’s provision as to “effective
means” in Article II(7) operates as a ‘lex specialis’, distinct from protection against
denial of justice under the FET standard and customary international law in Article
II(3)(a) of the Treaty, albeit also partly overlapping with such protections. The
Claimants contend that a host State may breach the Treaty’s provision as to “effective
means” (being a less demanding test), even when the State’s conduct does not amount

to a wrongful denial of justice under Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty. '¢

7.19 The Respondent disputes these submissions. It contends that, by “effective means”
under Article II(7), the two States incorporated into the Treaty pre-existing obligations
under customary international law, requiring each State to provide an effective
framework or system under which claims may be asserted and rights enforced.
However, according to the Respondent, the two States did not thereby undertake an
obligation to assure that such framework or system was to be effective in particular
cases, beyond the protection against denial of justice.!° Thus, the Respondent submits

that the Claimants cannot here invoke such an obligation (with its lesser demanding

test), separately from protection against denial of justice under Article II(3)(a) of the

Treaty.!°

For the purposes of this Award, the Tribunal does not address further the meaning or
effect of “effective means” in Article II(7) of the Treaty. It is unnecessary to do so on
the facts of the present case, as found in this Award applying the FET standard under

Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty (including protection against denial of justice).

Lest it be misunderstood, the Tribunal’s reticence as regards the Parties’ disputed
interpretation of Article II(7) of the Treaty should not be taken as implicitly accepting

or rejecting one or other of the Parties’ interpretations.

(5) The Umbrella Clause: The Claimants claim (denied by the Respondent) that the
Respondent did not observe its obligations under the 1995 Settlement Agreement to
release Chevron and TexPet from diffuse liabilities, thereby committing a breach of
Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty. These claims are distinct from the Claimants’ claims for
denial of justice, albeit also occasioned by the Lago Agrio Judgment with the

judgments of the Lago Agrio Appellate Court, Cassation and Constitutional Courts.
C: Special Features

There are several special features to the Claimants’ claims against the Respondent for

denial of justice under the FET standard in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty.

(1) Transnational Enforcement: Chevron had no significant realisable assets in
Ecuador, whether owned directly or indirectly, before and after the “merger” with
Texaco in 2001. Before the “merger”, Chevron was a stranger to Texaco and TexPet.
Texaco and TexPet had left Ecuador by 1992. Neither Texaco nor TexPet left behind
any significant realisable assets in Ecuador. Following the “merger”, therefore,
Chevron’s indirect ownership of Texaco and TexPet did not endow Chevron with any

significant realisable assets in Ecuador.

Outside Ecuador, however, Chevron, with its large group of associated companies,
indirectly owned (and still owns) substantial assets, including ocean-going vessels,

bank deposits around the world, and other properties. By their nature, vessels and bank

'© See R-TII Mar. 2015, paras 375ff.

Part VII — Page 6

7.26

7.27

7.28

deposits were and remain vulnerable to arrest, attachment or seizure by the Lago Agrio
Plaintiffs upon the Lago Agrio Judgment’s enforcement in multiple jurisdictions,
especially ex parte without prior notice. Even if Chevron were in a position to
discharge promptly such an order freezing a bank deposit or arresting a vessel, the
damage to Chevron and its associated companies from such repeated actions could

have been very significant (as it may still be).

Hence, as confirmed by the “Invictus Memorandum” (see Part IV above), the Lago
Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives always intended that the Lago Agrio Judgment should
be enforced in multiple jurisdictions outside Ecuador, not limited to the USA. This
Memorandum listed such other foreign jurisdictions expressly, including the
Philippines, Singapore, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, Canada,
Kuwait, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Belgium, Indonesia, the
Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Trinidad and Tobago, New Zealand and Russia. It

would be possible to add many more jurisdictions to this list.

The Lago Agrio Litigation was therefore likely to involve, from its outset, numerous
national jurisdictions other than Ecuador. This feature makes the present case unusual.
Earlier cases on denial of justice have concerned an alleged wrong and an alleged
injury taking place within the same State. Here, the injury to Chevron was always
intended to take place, at least in part, in one or more foreign jurisdictions elsewhere
than Ecuador, whether by the enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment or by an
enforced “amicable” settlement. Thus, the Lago Agrio Litigation was transnational in
the broadest sense, as confirmed by the multiplicity of foreign lawsuits and
arbitrations in the USA, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, the Netherlands and elsewhere

following the issuance of the Lago Agrio Judgment.

(2) The Individual Plaintiffs: The parties to the Lago Agrio Litigation are not the same
as the parties to this arbitration under the Treaty. TexPet, the Second Claimant in this
arbitration, was not a named party to the Lago Agrio Litigation (or the Aguinda
Litigation). The Respondent was not a party to the Lago Agrio Litigation (or the
Aguinda Litigation). Chevron, the First Claimant in this arbitration, was the sole

defendant in the Lago Agrio Litigation.

Part VII - Page 7

7.29

7.30

7.31

7.32

The Lago Agrio Judgment was made in favour of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs in the

  

Lago Agrio Litigation. These Lago Agrio Plaintiffs had been plaintiffs in the Aguinda
Litigation. The Lago Agrio Plaintiffs are not parties to this arbitration. Moreover, they
have not participated, nor could they participate, as parties to this arbitration between
the Claimants and the Respondent under the terms of the Parties’ Arbitration

Agreement derived from the Treaty.

Thus, so the Respondent contends, Chevron’s claims against the Respondent
impugning the Lago Agrio Judgment under the Treaty could, if successful in this
arbitration, gravely prejudice these Lago Agrio Plaintiffs. It could even require the
Lago Agrio Plaintiffs to begin new legal proceedings in Ecuador, or elsewhere. The
Respondent, therefore, advances in this arbitration a ‘cross-claim’ for environmental
damage against Chevron, by way of an “offset” (or set-off), unjust enrichment,
causation and contributory fault under Article 39 of the ILC Articles on State
Responsibility.!’ (For ease of reference, although these grounds differ juridically, the

Tribunal here refers to them collectively as a ‘cross-claim’ ).

In essence, the Respondent submits that any decision by this Tribunal that the Lago
Agrio Judgment was a nullity (or any other like relief) would effectively immunise
Chevron from justifiable liability to the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs because new legal
proceedings by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs would be time-barred under Ecuadorian law.

As pleaded in its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent contends that: “... granting
Claimants’ proposed relief would have the same effect as granting them special
immunity from liability for the environmental harm that [the Lago Agrio] Plaintiffs

were found to have suffered from Claimants’ misconduct.” !8

As a matter of international law, the Respondent again invokes the judgment of the
International Court of Justice in Monetary Gold (1954), as it did at the November
Hearing leading to the Tribunal’s Third Interim Award.!° In brief, the International

Court of Justice decided in Monetary Gold that an international tribunal cannot

exercise jurisdiction over a dispute between two States when the rights of a third State,

not being a party to the legal proceedings, form the subject-matter of the dispute.

It is clear to this Tribunal that parts of the declaratory relief requested by the
Claimants in this arbitration (if granted) could be used by Chevron, at least
forensically, to defend the enforcement proceedings of the Lago Agrio Judgment by
the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs in, for example, Canada.”° Indeed, the Claimants recognise
that the nullity of the Lago Agrio Judgment, if decided by the Tribunal, “may well

have an effect on the beneficiaries of that judgment as a matter of fact.”*!

The Claimants acknowledge, however, that there was no procedural possibility for the
Lago Agrio Plaintiffs to become parties to this arbitration; and “[nJor is there any
forum that could adjudicate a dispute between Chevron, Ecuador and the [Lago Agrio]
plaintiffs with international law as the applicable law.”?? The Claimants dispute,
however, any prejudice to the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs from any applicable time-bar,

relying upon the expert testimony of Dr Coronel on Ecuadorian law.??

In its Third Interim Award, the Tribunal decided to reject the Respondent’s
jurisdictional objection based upon “Third Party Rights” and Monetary Gold. The
Tribunal there assumed, for the sake of argument, that the principle in Monetary Gold
applied to mixed (i.e. State/Non-State) arbitrations under bilateral investment treaties
(such as this arbitration) and to circumstances in which a mixed tribunal adjudicating
upon the liability of a State might have to consider matters that were the subject of
litigation with private persons elsewhere.”* Nonetheless, the Tribunal decided that its
decisions on the dispute between the Parties in this arbitration “would not decide the
question of the effect of the 1995 Settlement Agreement as between the Lago Agrio
Plaintiffs and Chevron”; that “the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs cannot here be regarded as
indispensable third parties”; and that “this case can properly proceed to the merits of

the Claimants’ claims without them.”?°

7.39

The Tribunal here confirms that decision, for these and other reasons set out in its
Third Interim Award. It does not consider that any of its decisions made in this
arbitration can be legally binding upon any of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs. This Tribunal
has no jurisdiction to decide upon the individual claims for personal harm (not being
diffuse claims) of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs; and it has not sought to exercise any such

jurisdiction in this arbitration.

(3) Environmental Damage: The Respondent makes a related submission, relevant to
its cross-claim for environmental damage (as defined above). The Respondent
contends that there is a risk of unjustly enriching Chevron in this arbitration with a
“windfall”. It submits that Chevron’s burden of proving loss caused by the alleged
denial of justice requires Chevron to prove that: “... it is more likely than not that they
would have prevailed on the merits in the underlying environmental litigation before a
fair and impartial Ecuadorian court. Otherwise, Claimants would receive
indemnification from the State [the Respondent] for damages that a fair and impartial

court justifiably would have awarded the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs anyway.”?°

The Tribunal’s several awards, orders and decisions to date have left intact any
environmental claims in the Lago Agrio Litigation “made by an individual for
personal harm in respect of that individual’s rights separate and distinct from the
Respondent”: see the First Partial Award.?’ As the Tribunal also decided (by a
majority) in its Decision on Track 1B, the Lago Agrio Complaint included individual
claims materially similar, in substance, to the individual claims made by the Aguinda
Plaintiffs in New York: see Paragraph 186(3) of the Decision.”* It is also common
ground between the Parties that claims made by an individual for personal harm (not
being a diffuse claim), including one or more of the Aguinda or Lago Agrio Plaintiffs,
are not precluded by the Claimants’ case in this arbitration, howsoever decided by the

Tribunal.

In the Tribunal’s view, therefore, it remains clear that individual claims for personal
harm from environmental damage, made by the Aguinda Plaintiffs in the Aguinda
Litigation in New York or similar claims for personal harm (not being diffuse claims)

made by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs in the Lago Agrio Litigation, are not and cannot be

744

claims asserted by the Respondent in its own right against Chevron (or TexPet) in this

arbitration.

For its cross-claim in this arbitration, therefore, the Respondent cannot assert against
Chevron (or TexPet) personal rights possessed only by these Aguinda or Lago Agrio
Plaintiffs as individuals. Such an assertion would require an exercise lying beyond this
Tribunal’s jurisdiction under the Parties’ Arbitration Agreement, inconsistent with the
Tribunal’s application of the principle in Monetary Gold in its Third Interim Award

(see above).

Nor can any claims be made by the Respondent, in its own right, against Chevron (or
TexPet), given the effect of the 1995 Settlement Agreement as decided by the Tribunal
in its First Partial Award.”? Under the 1995 Settlement Agreement, the Respondent is
precluded from asserting any diffuse claim against Chevron as a “Releasee” (as also

TexPet and, likewise, Texaco as “Releasees”’).

Thus, whatever right is here being asserted by the Respondent for its cross-claim
alleging environmental damage, it is a right belonging only to these individual
plaintiffs alleging personal harm. It is not a right belonging to the Respondent. If it
were otherwise, the Respondent’s cross-claim could only be a diffuse claim. However,
the Respondent cannot assert a diffuse claim against Chevron (or TexPet) without the
Respondent violating the effect of the 1995 Settlement Agreement, as decided by this
Tribunal. There is therefore no safe passage for the Respondent’s cross-claim between

Scylla and Charybdis.

In the circumstances, the Tribunal does not consider that the Respondent’s cross-
claim impugns its jurisdiction (or, as regards admissibility, the exercise of its
jurisdiction) to decide other issues between the Claimants and the Respondent in this

arbitration.

Conversely, the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the Respondent’s cross-claim; and, in
the exercise of such jurisdiction, it decides that the Respondent has no standing or
right to bring such a cross-claim. Moreover, in a case (such as this) where the
claimant’s alleged liability to a cross-claim would result from a court judgment

impugned by the claimant, the Tribunal considers that the respondent cannot rely upon

2 First Partial Award, para 112(3), (see Annex | to Part I above).

that judgment to shift the legal burden of proof to the claimant; and that, in this case,

the Respondent has not discharged its legal burden of proving its cross-claim.

Nonetheless, as the Respondent’s Counsel rightly submitted at the Track II Hearing,
the individual Aguinda and Lago Agrio Plaintiffs are “real plaintiffs” with “real
claims.”°° For the avoidance of any doubt, the Tribunal re-confirms that it has no
jurisdiction under the Treaty to decide upon the merits of these individual plaintiffs’

claims for personal harm against Chevron (not being diffuse claims).
D: Issues as to Jurisdiction and Admissibility

(1) Introduction: As already indicated, TexPet was not a named party to the Lago
Agrio Litigation. Its position is therefore different from Chevron as the sole named
defendant in the Lago Agrio Litigation. It is necessary to consider their respective
positions separately, as partly decided in the Tribunal’s Third Interim Award (see this

Part VII's “Introduction” above).

It is also necessary to address separately: (i) the Claimants’ claims for denial of justice
under the FET standard in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty; and (ii) the Claimants’ claims
as “Releasees” in the 1995 Settlement Agreement under the Umbrella Clause in

Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty.

(2) The Third Interim Award: As decided in the Tribunal’s Third Interim Award,*!
TexPet’s “investment” qualifies as to jurisdiction, admissibility and protection under

Articles 1(1)(a)(iii), 11)(a)(v), H)(a), 11)(c), VIC)(a) and VI(1)(c) of the Treaty.*2

However, the Tribunal there decided that the 1995 Settlement Agreement (to which
TexPet was a party and signatory) was not, by itself, an “investment” made by TexPet
under the Treaty.?? Nevertheless, as regards TexPet, the Tribunal decided that the 1995
Settlement Agreement must be treated as “a continuation” of the earlier 1964 and 1973

Concession Agreements, so that the 1995 Settlement Agreement formed part of

30 Track II Hearing D13.3033.

3! The Tribunal understands that the Respondent’s legal proceedings in the Netherlands challenging the Third
Interim Award (as with other Awards) remain pending before the Hoge Raad: see the Claimants’ letter dated 19
March 2018, p. 2 and the Respondent’s letter dated 20 April 2018, p. 2. In addition, the Respondent has
requested the Tribunal to re-consider its Third Interim Award, a procedure to be completed in Track III of this
arbitration: see R-TI Mar. 2014, paras 134-138 and the Respondent's letter dated 20 April 2018, p. 6, fn 15. For
present purposes, the Tribunal takes no account of these pending proceedings and request.

TexPet’s “overall investment agreement” with Ecuador invoked under Article VI(1)(a)

of the Treaty.**

In the First Partial Award, the Tribunal decided that Chevron was a “co-Releasee”
under the 1995 Settlement Agreement, although it was not a signatory or named party
to the 1995 Settlement Agreement.*> In the Third Interim Award, the Tribunal also
decided that Chevron was not a “direct” investor by reference to TexPet’s Concession
Agreements of 1964 and 1973: it was never a member of the Consortium; it was not an
“Operator”; and it only appeared in the chronology of this case in 2001 following its
“merger” with Texaco, long after the departure from Ecuador of TexPet and Texaco,
in 1992.5° Hence, unlike TexPet, Chevron had no “direct overall investment” in
Ecuador continuing from the 1964 Concession Agreement; and the 1995 Settlement
Agreement, by itself, could not under the Treaty become in 2001 a “direct” investment

by Chevron in Ecuador.*”

Therefore, although both Chevron and TexPet were and remain “co-Releasees” under
the 1995 Settlement Agreement (with Texaco), Chevron is not in the same position as

TexPet as an investor with a “direct” investment in Ecuador under the Treaty.

For these reasons, as recited below, the Tribunal did not make in the Third Interim
Award any final decision upon the Respondent’s jurisdictional objections to Chevron’s
claims with respect to any alleged “direct” investment by Chevron under Articles
I(1)(a), VIC1)(a) and VI(1)(c) of the Treaty, as distinct from Chevron’s “indirect
investment” in TexPet, as TexPet’s ultimate parent company following Chevron’s

“merger” with Texaco in 2001, under Articles I(1)(a) and VI(1)(c) of the Treaty.**

Thus, in its Third Interim Award, the Tribunal drew a distinction between Chevron’s
“direct” and “indirect” investments. As to Articles I(1)(a) and VI(1)(c) of the Treaty,

the Tribunal decided (inter alia) as follows:*?

“4.24 In the Tribunal’s view, as TexPet’s parent company, Chevron is a covered
investor under Article I(1)(a) of the BIT because it indirectly owns or controls an

‘investment’ in Ecuador. It is not disputed that Chevron is a company ‘of the
other Party’ formed in the USA; and Article I(1)(a) does not require its indirect
investment (i.e. in TexPet and its investment) to be a company formed in Ecuador.
Accordingly, the Tribunal decides, as a matter of jurisdiction, that Chevron can
bring its claims before this Tribunal for an alleged breach of any right conferred
or created by the BIT with respect to its indirect ‘investment’ in TexPet.

4.25 A different issue arises from Chevron’s exposure to the liability to the
plaintiffs in the Lago Agrio Litigation. Chevron became TexPet’s parent and thus
an investor in 2001 only, long after the events said to give rise to Chevron’s
liability and occurring at a time when Texaco (not Chevron) was TexPet’s parent
company. Notwithstanding their ostensibly distinct legal personalities and
corporate histories, the Lago Agrio Litigation appears completely to amalgamate
Chevron with Texaco (for legal reasons which remain unclear to the Tribunal). In
that event, Chevron here submits for jurisdictional purposes that it should be
treated by this Tribunal as, effectively, standing in the shoes of Texaco, as
TexPet’s parent company from 1964 onwards, with the same original investment
indirectly made and continued by Texaco. Otherwise, so Chevron submits, the
Respondent and the Lago Agrio plaintiffs could succeed unfairly in “having it
both ways”, with Chevron liable in the Lago Agrio litigation because of the
concession/investment made by Texaco & TexPet but with Chevron not entitled in
this arbitration to assert any relief because it had in fact no such
investment/concession at the material time, i.e. before 2001.

4.26 The Tribunal declines to cut this Gordian knot at this early stage of these
arbitration proceedings: it will need a much better understanding of the legal
reasons why Chevron is to be treated in the Lago Agrio Litigation as a party
succeeding to Texaco’s liabilities which arose before the “merger” in 2001; and
it will also need a clearer understanding of what constituted such “merger” as
regards the different and successive legal relationships between Texaco, TexPet
and Chevron before and after such “merger”, under whatever applicable law or
laws, namely the laws of the USA and/or Ecuadorian law.

4.27 Accordingly, for the time being, the Tribunal makes no final decision in
regard to the Respondent's jurisdictional objection to Chevron’s own claims as a
direct investor under Article VI(1)(c) of the BIT, save to join that particular
objection to the merits under Article 21(4) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. In
addition, the Tribunal’s jurisdictional decision to treat Chevron as an indirect
investor should not be understood as indicating (one way or the other) that
Chevron would be entitled to all the relief claimed by Chevron in paragraph 547
of the Claimants’ Memorial on the Merits (cited in Part I above). That is also a
matter for the merits phase of this arbitration.”

As to Article VI(1)(a) of the Treaty, the Tribunal also decided in the Third Interim
Award to join that jurisdictional issue to the merits under Article 21(4) of the

UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. “°

The Operative Part of this Third Interim Award, at Paragraph 5.4, provided as regards

Chevron:*!

“As regards the claims pleaded by the First Claimant (Chevron Corporation or
‘Chevron’) in the Claimants’ said Notice of Arbitration, [the Tribunal here
decides] to reject all objections made by the Respondent as to jurisdiction and
admissibility in its said memorials and further submissions, save those relating to
the jurisdictional objections raised against the First Claimant as a[n] investor
under Article I(1)(a) alleging a “direct” investment under Article VI(1)(c) and an
“investment agreement” under Article VI(1)(a) of the Ecuador-USA Treaty of 27
August 1993 which are joined to the merits of the First Claimants’ claims under
Article 21(4) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules forming part of the Parties’
arbitration agreement under the Treaty.”

Accordingly, in summary, the Tribunal there joined to the merits the Respondent’s
jurisdictional objections to Chevron as an investor with a “direct” investment. The
Parties subsequently agreed, and the Tribunal so ordered, that the Respondent’s
objections should be further addressed by the Parties and decided by the Tribunal in

Track II of this arbitration.

For present purposes, therefore, the issue arises as to whether Chevron has any
relevant “investment”, “investment agreement” or “investment dispute” under
Articles I(1)(a), VI(1)(a) and VI(1)(c) of the Treaty, permitting this Tribunal to decide
Chevron’s claims as a national of the USA under the FET standard in Article II(3)(a)
of the Treaty (including protection against denial of justice) or under the Umbrella

Clause in Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty.

(3) The Respondent’s Case: In brief,*? the Respondent maintains several objections to
the Tribunal’s jurisdiction (including, as to admissibility, its exercise of jurisdiction) to

decide Chevron’s claims under Articles II(3)(a) and (c) of the Treaty.

These objections concern Chevron’s alleged lack of any “direct” investment in

Ecuador under Articles I(1)(a), VI(1)(a) and VI(1)(c) of the Treaty; Chevron’s limited

interest as a “Releasee” under the 1995 Settlement Agreement; Chevron’s several
failures to exhaust its local remedies within the Ecuadorian legal system regarding the
Lago Agrio Judgment, as required for denial of justice under Article II(3)(a) of the
Treaty; and (as also raised by the Tribunal) Chevron’s amendment to its claims (with
TexPet) for denial of justice regarding the Lago Agrio Judgment, pleaded after the

commencement of this arbitration.“*

(4) The Claimant’s Case: In brief,‘ the Claimants contend that the Tribunal has both
jurisdiction to decide and (as to admissibility) may exercise such jurisdiction to decide
Chevron’s claims under Articles I(1)(a), VI(1)(a), VI(1)(c), I(3)(a) and II(3)(c) of the

Treaty, on several grounds.

Chevron asserts (inter alia) that its indirect investment in TexPet is a sufficient
“investment” to confer jurisdiction upon this Tribunal under the Treaty to decide its
claims. Further, so Chevron contends, the Respondent should not be permitted to treat
it (Chevron) differently from Texaco and TexPet under the Treaty, given the terms of

the Lago Agrio Judgment merging their respective identities.*>

As regards the
exhaustion of local remedies, Chevron contends that the requirement under
international law is not absolute for a claim for denial of justice; and that it reasonably
availed itself of such remedies as ostensibly existed within the Ecuadorian legal
system; but none offered at the time any reasonable, timely and effective prospect of
success against the Lago Agrio Judgment. As for the amendment to its case to plead
claims in regard to the Lago Agrio Judgment, Chevron contends that such
amendments were permissible under Article 20 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules,

forming part of the Parties’ Arbitration Agreement derived from the Treaty.
E: The Tribunal’s Analysis as to Jurisdiction and Admissibility

(1) Introduction: It is appropriate to address separately the three parts of the
Respondent’s objections to jurisdiction (with admissibility); namely: (i) Chevron’s
lack of any relevant “investment” under Articles I(1), I(3)(a), TI(3)(c), WI(1)(a) and
VI(1)(c) of the Treaty; (ii) Chevron’s alleged failure to exhaust local remedies in the

Ecuadorian legal system for its claims regarding denial of justice in the Lago Agrio

to so interpret it, as also to raise the point upon its own initiative: see below).

Litigation under the FET standard in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty; and (as also raised
by the Tribunal) (iii) the status of the Claimants’ amended claims regarding the Lago

Agrio Judgment under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the Treaty and Dutch law.

(2) Chevron: The Tribunal decides, confirming its Third Interim Award, that Chevron
cannot establish jurisdiction for its claims under Articles II(3)(a) or II(3)(c) of the
Treaty by reference only to its own status as a “Releasee” under the 1995 Settlement
Agreement. The Tribunal there decided that, by itself, the 1995 Settlement Agreement
is not a direct “investment” in Ecuador made by Chevron under Article I(1)(a) of the

Treaty.

The Tribunal therefore decides that Chevron cannot establish jurisdiction for its claims
under Article VI(1)(a) of the Treaty, based only on its own status as a “Releasee”
under the 1995 Settlement Agreement. That provision requires the existence of an
investment dispute “between a Party [i.e. the Respondent] and a national or company
of the other Party [i.e., here, Chevron] arising out of or relating to (a) an investment
agreement made between that Party and such national or company” (see the full
wording set out in Section B of this Part VI above). Whilst there is, in the Tribunal’s
view, a dispute between Chevron and the Respondent arising out of or relating to the
1995 Settlement Agreement, the 1995 Settlement Agreement is not an “investment

agreement” made by Chevron itself.

The Tribunal therefore turns to the interpretation and application of Article VI(1)(c) of
the Treaty, regarding a dispute arising out of or relating to “an alleged breach of any

right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment.”

The Tribunal notes that Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty defines “investment”, but not
“investor”; and that the protection afforded under Article II(3)(a) and (c) of the Treaty
similarly addresses “investments”, as does Article VI of the Treaty in regard to an
“investment dispute” and “investment”. The Preamble to the Treaty also records that it

is “a treaty concerning the encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments.”

The Tribunal has decided that Chevron had no investment under the Treaty before its
“merger” with Texaco in 2001 (whether direct or indirect). However, with this
“merger”, Chevron acquired an interest in the investments made in Ecuador by TexPet

and Texaco since 1964, including (as integral parts of their overall investments) the

Part VII - Page 17

771

1964 Concession, the 1973 Concession and the 1995 Settlement Agreement. In about
2001, as contended by the Respondent, Chevron also became a party (with Texaco) to
Texaco’s earlier undertaking to the US Courts in favour of Ecuadorian jurisdiction
contained in Texaco’s Notice of Agreement of 11 January 1999 in the Aguinda
Litigation, leading to the Lago Agrio Litigation.*° In any event, Chevron became the
sole named defendant in the Lago Agrio Litigation, leading in turn to the Lago Agrio

Judgment.

There is no issue between the Parties that Chevron is a ‘company’ of the USA as a

Party to the Treaty, within the meaning of Articles I(1)(a) and VI(1)(c) of the Treaty.

In the Tribunal’s view, the meaning of the term “investment” in Articles I(1)(a) and
VI(1)(c) of the Treaty is materially different than the term “investor”. An “investment”
identifies the subject-matter protected by the Treaty, as distinct from the person
making that “investment”. As a factual matter, Chevron never was a party making its
own “direct” investment as an investor separate and distinct from the investments of
Texaco and TexPet. Assessed as at 2001, however, Chevron acquired an “indirect”
interest in TexPet’s investments in Ecuador, satisfying (as regards Chevron) the
definition of “investment” in Article I(1)(a) and Article VI(1)(c) of the Treaty, as
applied to “investments” in Articles II(3)(a) and II(3)(c) and also to an “investment

dispute” as defined Article VI(1) of the Treaty.

Accordingly, in the Tribunal’s view, the dispute between Chevron and the Respondent
is an investment dispute “arising out of or related to ... (c) an alleged breach of any
right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment” [namely
Articles II(3)(a) and II(3)(c) of the Treaty]. As already decided by the Tribunal, the
phrase “relating to” is very broad in scope;*’ and the definition of “investment” in
Article 1(a) is equally broad, encompassing “every kind of investment [in Ecuador]

.... owned or controlled directly or indirectly” by a claimant company.

The Tribunal decides, therefore, that Chevron acquired a relevant “investment” in
Ecuador under the Treaty sufficient to entitle it to invoke this Tribunal’s jurisdiction to

decide its claims under Articles II(3)(a) and II(3)(c) of the Treaty. Such an investment

“© The Respondent relies upon the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in its judgment of 17 March 2011,
deciding that Chevron is bound by Texaco’s undertaking of 1999: see Part IV(G)(1) above.

is not required by the Treaty to be a “direct” investment, still less an “investment

agreement” made by Chevron itself.

(3) TexPet: TexPet can assert in this arbitration its own rights under the Treaty in
regard to its direct investments, including TexPet’s own rights as a “Releasee” under
the 1995 Settlement Agreement (forming an intrinsic part of TexPet’s overall

“investment” from 1964 onwards) under Articles II(3)(a) and II(3)(c) of the Treaty.
The Third Interim Award decided, as regards TexPet:*8

“4.20 As a co-claimant in this arbitration, the Tribunal therefore decides that
TexPet has standing (as a matter of jurisdiction) to seek its claimed declaratory,
specific performance, moral damages and other relief against the Respondent,
even though TexPet is not a defendant in the Lago Agro Litigation (or a defendant
in the criminal proceedings). As an investor with a covered investment and as a
contractual party to the 1995 Settlement Agreement with the Respondent, TexPet
enjoys valuable economic rights for itself; and its claimed relief can thus include
relief advanced under Articles I(1)(a)(v), Article II(3)(c), Article I(1)(a)(iti) and
Article VI(1)(c) of the BIT.”

In the Tribunal’s view, therefore, TexPet made a relevant investment under the Treaty

sufficient to invoke this Tribunal’s jurisdiction to decide its claims under the Treaty.

Such an investment was a direct investment made by TexPet itself from 1964 onwards,

in contrast to Chevron.

For two reasons, in the Tribunal’s view, it would be no answer that TexPet has itself
suffered no “damage” from the Lago Agrio Judgment, not being a named party to the
Lago Agrio Litigation. First, damage is not required for an international wrong under
Articles II(3)(a) and II(3)(c) of the Treaty: see Article 31 of the ILC Articles on State
Responsibility.*° It suffices that TexPet with its “investment” has suffered an “injury”.
Such an injury was allegedly caused (inter alia) by the Respondent’s international
wrong committed by the Lago Agrio Court (as part of the Respondent’s judicial
branch) with the Lago Agrio Judgment, in violation of TexPet’s release by the
Respondent from any diffuse claims under the 1995 Settlement Agreement. That
wrong was allegedly repeated and maintained by the judgments of the Lago Agrio

Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts in upholding the Lago Agrio Judgment

and by the Lago Agrio Appellate Court in rendering enforceable and maintaining the

enforceability of the Lago Agrio Judgment.

Second, as alleged by the Claimants, TexPet has in any event suffered damage from
the Lago Agrio Litigation and Lago Agrio Judgment. TexPet, albeit not a named
defendant, was held publicly responsible in the Lago Agrio Judgment, with Chevron,
for extensive environmental damage from 1964 onwards in the area of the concession.
Consequentially, the Lago Agrio Judgment was successfully enforced against TexPet’s

assets in Ecuador, by the Lago Agrio Court’s execution order of 15 October 2012.°°

Under that order, the Court ordered, under paragraph (c), the attachment of “all the
funds deposited and existing in Banco Pichincha Checking Account No 30452125-04,
as well as any other bank account, investment or fund owned by ... Texaco Petroleum

Company, Texpet ...” and, under paragraph (f), “... the total amount of (US$
96,355,369) of the award against the Government of Ecuador in the arbitration
proceedings brought by Chevron and Texaco [i.e. TexPet] with the Republic of
Ecuador, publicly known as the ‘Chevron Case II’ [i.e. the Commercial Cases
Arbitration]”. The Lago Agrio Court ordered this attachment of the award debt
payable to TexPet (with Chevron) to be notified to the Respondent (as the award

debtor), by order of 12 July 2016.*!

Subject to other issues addressed later below, the Tribunal decides, therefore, that
Chevron acquired a relevant “investment” under the Treaty sufficient to invoke this
Tribunal’s jurisdiction to decide its claims under the FET standard in Article II(3)(a)
of the Treaty (including its protection against denial of justice) and under the Umbrella
Clause in Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty. Such an investment comprised Chevron’s
indirect interest, as from the date of the “merger” in 2001, in TexPet’s “overall”

investments from 1964 onwards (including the 1995 Settlement Agreement).

(4) Good Faith: There is a third approach invoked by Chevron, somewhat more

teleological, to address the Respondent’s jurisdictional objections to Chevron’s claims

p. 7 and the Respondent’s letter dated 20 April 2018, p. 4.

>! The award debt was not recovered by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs, owing (inter alia) to the settlement of the
award debt made by the Respondent directly to Chevron and TexPet on 22 July 2016: see the Claimants’ letter
dated 19 March 2018, p. 8.

7.82

7.83

for lack of any relevant “investment” under Articles I(1), VI(1)(a), VI(1)(c), II(3)(a)
and III(3)(c) of the Treaty.

As the Claimants contend, the Respondent cannot, in good faith, ‘have it both ways’ as
regards Chevron’s “investment” in Ecuador. If the Respondent, through its judicial
branch, took the position that Chevron had assets in Ecuador, standing in the shoes of
TexPet and Texaco as the Lago Agrio Judgment states, the Respondent cannot now
adopt the position that Chevron never had any assets in Ecuador, i.e. that it never had
any investments in Ecuador. The Lago Agrio Judgment amalgamates completely
Chevron with TexPet and Texaco as result of the “merger”, so as to hold Chevron
liable for all wrongs committed by TexPet’s and Texaco’s activities in Ecuador from
1964 onwards. Yet the Respondent in this arbitration now seeks, improperly according
to the Claimants, to disassociate Chevron in full from any of TexPet’s and Texaco’s

activities in Ecuador (including investments), for tactical jurisdictional purposes.

The Claimants therefore conclude that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over Chevron’s
claims under Article VI(1)(a) and (c) of the Treaty “because Chevron is entitled to all
procedural and substantive legal rights and defences of TexPet, as a result of having
been sued for TexPet’s conduct as well as by reason of the [Lago Agrio] Court’s

improper amalgamation of Chevron with Texaco and TexPet.”*?

It is necessary to examine more closely the legal principles underlying the Claimants’
submissions based upon on these apparent inconsistencies between the Lago Agrio
Judgment (as also decided by the Lago Agrio Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional
Courts) and the Respondent’s jurisdictional objections in this arbitration. These

inconsistencies and their legal effects are not accepted by the Respondent.

The Parties’ obligations to resolve their dispute by consensual arbitration before an
international tribunal derive from Article VI of the Treaty, subject to international law
(as its applicable law). Under international law, as codified in Article 26 the Vienna
Treaty on the Law of Treaties (the “VCLT”), parties are required to act in good faith

in the performance of their obligations.

°2 C-TI Jan, 2015, para 31; see also id., paras 275ff.

Part VII — Page 21

7.84 Article 26 of the VCLT provides:** “Every treaty in force is binding upon the parties
to it and must be performed in good faith”. The International Law Commission stated
in its commentary to the VCLT that: “In the case of treaties, ... there is the special
consideration that the parties by negotiating and concluding the treaty have brought
themselves into a relationship in which there are particular obligations of good
faith.”>+ In Nuclear Tests (1974), the International Court of Justice decided: “One of
the basic principles governing the creation and performance of legal obligations,
whatever their source, is the principle of good faith”.°> That was decided in regard to
unilateral declarations made by a State. In the ILC’s subsequent “Guiding Principles
applicable to unilateral declarations of States capable of creating legal obligations”
(2006), the first guiding principle declared that the binding character of such unilateral

declarations “is based on good faith.”°°

7.85 The Parties’ mutual consent to arbitration derived from Article VI of the Treaty is not,
course, a treaty between two States. The Parties’ consent is contained in the separate
Arbitration Agreement subject to international law between the Claimants and the
Respondent, that was formed upon the Claimants’ written acceptance (by their Notice
of Arbitration) of the Respondent’s standing, general offer to arbitrate contained in
Article VI of the Treaty.*’ Under international law, the Parties’ Arbitration
Agreement, made pursuant to Article VI(2) of the Treaty, is legally autonomous, or
“separable”, from other provisions of the Treaty.°* This is not a State-State arbitration
under the Treaty (as to which the Treaty contains a separate provision in Article VII).
This investor-State arbitration was therefore commenced by the Claimants in their
own right, not deriving from the USA’s espousal of their claims. Moreover, the

Parties’ Arbitration Agreement incorporates Article 21(2) of the UNCITRAL

Arbitration Rules, which recognises the legal autonomy of an arbitration provision
physically, but not legally, contained in a substantive agreement. The Tribunal refers
to the legal analysis of Article VI of the Treaty made by the US Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit in its judgment of 17 March 2011 in the New York Stay Legal
Proceedings, to the effect that the Parties “have created a separate binding agreement

to arbitrate” (see Part IV(G)(6) above).

In the Tribunal’s view, the Parties’ offer and acceptance imported into the Arbitration
Agreement an obligation derived from the Treaty requiring all Parties to exercise their
rights and to perform their obligations in good faith in the conduct of this arbitration.
This obligation of good faith applies both to substantive provisions, such as Articles
TI(3)(a) and II(3)(c), but also to Article VI of the Treaty. Conversely, the Arbitration
Agreement precludes conduct by any Party in bad faith, calculated to defeat the object
and purpose of arbitration under Article VI of the Treaty: see, particularly, the
Treaty’s Preamble as to “fair and equitable treatment of investment” (set out in Part
TII(B) above), as interpreted under Article 31(1) of the VCLT. Moreover, where the
lex arbitri is international law, the obligation of good faith as a general principle of
international law (with the meaning of Article 38(1)(c) of the ICJ Statute) applies to

the Arbitration Agreement directly.

The general principle of good faith has a long history in regard to the conduct of
dispute resolution, including arbitrations under international law, albeit under different
nomenclatures. It has recently been confirmed by the ICSID award in Orascom v
Algeria (2017), where the arbitration tribunal stated that it was “undeniable” that the
doctrine of abuse of rights, or “‘abus de procédure”, has a role to play in the conduct of
an arbitration under a bilateral investment treaty, prohibiting the exercise of a “right”
for purposes other than those for which that right was established; and that this
doctrine was a general principle applicable in international law as well as in municipal
Jaw. In the Tribunal’s view, such an abuse of rights includes an abusive want of good
faith in the exercise of a procedural right, such as an objection to the jurisdiction of a
tribunal under Article 21 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules derived from Article VI
of the Treaty.

7.88 For present purposes, it is necessary to examine a specific want of good faith. Long
before the VCLT, Lord McNair wrote, in his commentary on the Fur Seal

Arbitration:® “..

. international jurisprudence has a place for some recognition of the
principle that a State cannot blow hot and cold — allegans contraria non audiendus
est.”°! Dr Bin Cheng later wrote in his well-known work, General Principles of Law
as Applied by International Courts and Tribunals, under the similar heading “Allegans
Contraria Non Est Audiendum”:© “It is a principle of good faith that “a man shall not
be allowed to blow hot and cold — to affirm at one time and deny at another ... Such a
principle has its basis in common sense and common justice, and whether it is called

‘estoppel’ or by any other name, it is one which courts of law in modern times most

usefully deployed.”

7.89 As these scholarly authors considered, an important feature of good faith under
international law is the principle expressed in the Latin maxim allegans contraria non
est audiendum, or sometimes, loosely adopting Anglo-Saxon legal terminology,
“estoppel”. Professor Hersch Lauterpacht considered that estoppel under international
law was based upon a general principle of good faith: “It is of little consequence
whether the rule is based on what in English law is known as the principle of estoppel
or the more generally conceived requirement of good faith. The former is probably no
more than one of the aspects of the latter.”®? Professor Bowett also wrote: “The rule of
estoppel, whether treated as a rule of evidence or as a rule of substantive law, operates
so as to preclude a party from denying before a tribunal the truth of a statement of fact
made previously by that party to another whereby that other has acted to his detriment
or the party making the statement has secured some benefit. The basis of the rule is the

general principle of good faith and as such finds a place in many systems of law.”

7.90 Inhis work (supra), Dr Bin Cheng also wrote (with footnotes here omitted):

“The principle [of good faith] applies equally, though perhaps not with the same

force, to other admissions of a State which do not give rise to an equitable
estoppel. Thus it has been held that a State cannot be heard to repudiate liability
for a collision after its authorities on the spot had at the time admitted liability
and sought throughout to make the most advantageous arrangements for the
Government under the circumstances. Again, if a State, having been fully
informed of the circumstances, has accepted a person’s claim to the ownership of
certain property and entered into negotiation with him for its purchase, it
becomes ‘very difficult, if not impossible’ for that State subsequently to allege that
he had no title at the time. If a State, which is the lessee of a property owned by
two joint owners, has, after the death of one of them, paid the entire rent to the
other, who claims to have become the sole owner, ‘this act can not be interpreted
otherwise than as a recognition by the authorities of the fact that the right of
ownership of Hassar [the deceased] has passed to Raini [the claimant].’ Where a
party negotiates for the sublease of a concession granted by a State, it thereby
recognises the validity of the concession and the right of the State to grant it ...”

7.91 Dr MacGibbon, in “Estoppel in International Law” (1958),°° wrote that, underlying
most formulations of the doctrine of estoppel in international law, is “the requirement
that a State ought to be consistent in its attitude to a given factual or legal situation;”
and that it “may be, and often is, grounded on considerations of good faith”. He

concluded his historical survey of legal materials, as follows:

“What appears to be the common denominator of the various aspects of estoppel
which have been discussed, is the requirement that a State ought to maintain
towards a given factual or legal situation an attitude consistent with that which it
was known to have adopted with regard to the same circumstances on previous
occasions. At its simplest, estoppel in international law reflects the possible
variations, in circumstances and effects, of the underlying principle of consistency
which may be summed up in the maxim allegans contraria non audiendus est. ...”.

Poland (1926) regarding the inconsistent conduct of the respondent State (Poland) in
that mixed arbitration.©* Professor Bowett relied upon this Decision in his 1957 article,
“Estoppel before International Tribunals and Its Relation to Acquiescence”.© As

explained below, the Decision is not a case on “estoppel”.”°

7.93 As reported, the relevant facts were as follows: Under the Treaty of Versailles, Poland
had the right to liquidate the property of German nationals situated within its territory.
However, the Treaty also provided that former nationals of Germany, who by virtue of
the Treaty had acquired Polish nationality, were not to be regarded as German
nationals.’! Poland proceeded to liquidate the property of the claimants as German
nationals. These claimants contended that they had acquired Polish nationality and that
their property was, therefore, not liable to such liquidation. The tribunal decided that it
had no jurisdiction to decide claims put forward against Poland by Polish nationals.
Hence, the tribunal rejected the claimants’ claims pleaded as Polish nationals.
However, the tribunal also decided that it was open to the claimants to amend their
claims on the basis that they were German nationals (within the same arbitration
proceedings). Having liquidated their estates on the ground that they were German
nationals, Poland could not deny their German nationality in the arbitration, it being
required by the Versailles Treaty that a person who had suffered damage as a German
national should not be deprived of legal remedies afforded by the Treaty to German

nationals.

7 The edited summary of the Kunkel decision in the Annual Digest prepared in English by Hersch Lauterpacht
uses the word “estopped”; but that word is not used as an English legal term of art, as appears from the original
French text below, taken from the full report in the Recueil.

1 Treaty of Versailles (Treaty of Peace between the Allied and Associated Powers and Germany), 28 June 1919,
UKTS 4 (1919), CMD 153, Chapter V, Property Rights and Interests, Section IV provides (with square brackets
here added): Article 297: “The question of private property, rights and interests in an enemy country shall be
settled according to the principles laid down in this Section and to the provisions of the Annex hereto. ...

(b) [1] Subject to any contrary stipulations which may be provided for in the present Treaty, the Allied and
Associated Powers reserve the right to retain and liquidate all property, rights and interests belonging at the
date of the coming into force of the present Treaty to German nationals, or companies controlled by them, within
their territories, colonies, and | including territories ceded to them by the present
Treaty. [2] The liquidation shall be carried out in accordance with the laws of the Allied or Associated State
concerned, and the German owners shall not be able to dispose of such property, rights or interests nor to
subject them to any charge without the consent of that State. [3] German nationals who acquire ipso facto the
nationality of an Allied or Associated Power in accordance with the provisions of the present Treaty will not be
considered as German nationals within the meaning of this paragraph.”

7.94 The Decision was issued in the French language only. The words “estoppel” and
“estopped”, albeit an Anglo-Saxon legal concept expressed in Norman-French, are not
French words, still less French legal terms of art. The relevant passage in the

Decision’s authentic text in French, provides as follows:

“8. En résumé, le Tribunal doit se déclarer incompétent pour statuer sur les
conclusions des requérants telles qu’elles ont été formulées et motivées. Il y a lieu
toutefois de faire l’importante réserve suivante:

Si les requérants renoncent a fonder leurs réclamations contre l’Etat polonais sur
leur prétendue qualité de ressortissants polonais, s’ils se bornent & invoquer les
droits assurés par le Traité aux ressortissants allemands liquidés, c’est-a-dire
s’ils réclament V’indemnité supplémentaire prévue par Part. 297. litt. h, et par
Tart, 92, ch. 2, ou, é Il Sils ¢ LP é de la liquid
pour un motif autre que leur ressortissance polonaise, les considérations
développées ci-dessus cesseront d’étre applicables. Le Tribunal n’aura pas a
rechercher d office si les requérants sont Allemands ou Polonais; il devra au
point de, vue de sa compétence, les tenir pour Allemands puisque c’est en raison
de cette qualité qu’ils ont été liquidés et que, d’autre part, la prétendue
ressortissance polonaise ne constituera plus la base juridique de la réclamation.
Et l’Etat polonais ne pourra naturellement pas exciper de la ressortissance
polonaise des requérants pour décliner la compétence du Tribunal, puisqu’il les a
traités comme Allemands et qu’ils ne revendiqueront pas autre chose que les
droits garantis aux ressortissants allemands. La condition de nationalité
allemande essentielle pour la compétence du T.A.M. sera donc, dans cette
hypothése, censée réalisée. Cette solution est conforme a la jurisprudence des
T.A.M. (Cf. Recueil, t. II, p. 1017-1018 et p. 606) et elle se justifie par des
raisons d’équité évidentes: celui qui a subi un dommage en sa qualité d’Allemand
doit pouvoir bénéficier des droits attachés a cette qualité, notamment de celui de
saisir le T.A.M. .

 

Strictement, les nouvelles conclusions ainsi réservées devraient faire l’objet de
nouvelles requétes, puisque leur fondement juridique différera de celui des
conclusions actuelles. Cependant, dans un but de simplification, on peut autoriser
les requérants a procéder, dans les deux mois, par le dépét de mémoires qui
seront joints aux dossiers déja constitués et auxquels |’Etat défendeur aura un
délai de deux mois pour répondre, l’échange d’écritures étant ensuite terminé. Ce
n'est que si les conclusions en question ne peuvent étre prises utilement dans le
délai indiqué (par exemple parce que la liquidation ne serait pas encore achevée)
que les requérants devront déposer de nouvelles requétes.”

7.95 Whilst the tribunal invoked “des raisons d’équité évidentes” and did not refer
expressly to bad faith or ‘blowing hot and cold’, this Decision can only be understood

as resting upon Poland’s lack of good faith in taking, unequivocally, starkly

Part VII - Page 27

7.96

7.97

7.98

inconsistent positions towards the same claimants at different times, to their detriment

and to Poland’s benefit.

In his 1957 article, Professor Bowett concluded that “[m]any of the cases on estoppel
by conduct illustrate the simple principle that the law will demand consistency in

conduct where the result of inconsistency would be to prejudice another party”.”? In

support of this conclusion, Professor Bowett cited not only Kunkel (1925) but also a

lengthy study on related forms of estoppel under the laws of the USA published in the
Harvard Law Review (1951-1952).”4

This study addressed (inter alia) “preclusion” by a party taking inconsistent positions

in successive legal proceedings, as follows (with footnotes here omitted, save one):”>

“The rule that a person is precluded from making allegations of fact inconsistent
with a position he took in a previous case is not based on the policies against
relitigation, but on a desire to preserve the dignity of judicial proceedings by
preventing the successive assertion of factually contradictory statements as the
truth. This is a form of estoppel based on the conduct of the party rather than the
court, in which respect it is similar to election of remedies. The preclusion, like
election of remedies, preferably should not be applied where the first position
taken did not harm or cause reliance by the other party. Unlike res judicata, it
operates regardless of finality of the original proceedings or identity of the
parties, and it applies only to positions taken on the facts, not inconsistent points
of law. Some courts apply the rule only where the position was successfully
maintained, while others do not require success if the second action has some
connection with the first. The preclusion seems an undesirable restriction against
decision on the merits in the second action where it is applied to facts that were
not major issues in the first action, or to facts that were conjectural at the time.
[Footnote 30]”

(Footnote 30 states: “Jt has been suggested that the doctrine might generally be
mitigated by using the prior position as an admission, not a preclusion, so that the
trier of fact in the second case could decide on the merits between the two
positions asserted. See Note, 59 Harv. L. Rev. 1132, 1136 (1946)”).

This principle of preclusion from a party’s inconsistent positions was confirmed by the

US Supreme Court in New Hampshire v Maine (2001).”° In that case, the US Supreme

Court decided, applying “judicial estoppel”, that New Hampshire was “equitably
barred from asserting — contrary to its position in the 1970’s litigation — that the inland

Piscataqua River boundary runs along the Maine shore”.

While they are relevant to the establishment of ‘judicial estoppel’ as a general
principle of international law (applicable here under Article 38(1)(c) of the ICJ
Statute), in other circumstances, the Tribunal would not be minded to cite such
municipal legal materials in such detail in support of its approach under international
law. In this case, however, there is good reason to do so in the light of the Parties’ own
joint experiences of these materials directly related to this arbitration, particularly the
Respondent’s successful invocation of preclusion, or “judicial estoppel”, from

contradictory statements made by Chevron to different US courts.

In disputes between the Claimants and the Respondent in US legal proceedings
directly related to this arbitration, this principle of preclusion, or “judicial estoppel”,
based on a party’s inconsistent statements, was applied by the US Court of Appeals for

the Second Circuit and the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.

The first of these judgments was issued by the US Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit on 17 March 2011 in Republic of Ecuador v Chevron Corporation and TexPet
in the US Stay Proceedings.’ It related to the application by the Respondent to the US
Courts for an order staying this arbitration under the Treaty: see Part IV(G)(6) above.
The Tribunal has already addressed the Second Circuit’s judgment; and it is
unnecessary to do so here again, save to note that the Court applied “judicial
estoppel”.”* The Court described the purpose of “judicial estoppel”, citing the US
Supreme Court, as protecting “the integrity of the judicial process by prohibiting
parties from deliberately changing positions according to the exigencies of the

moment”.””

The second of these judgments was issued by the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth
Circuit on 13 February 2013 in Republic of Ecuador v Connor, where Chevron was an
intervening party.*° It related to an application made by the Respondent for discovery
under Section 1782 against Mr Connor, for use as evidence in this arbitration under
the Treaty. That application was resisted by Mr Connor (with GSI), supported by

Chevron.

In its judgment granting the Respondent’s application, the Court (per Jones J) applied

the principle of “judicial estoppel”: *!

“Judicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine designed to protect the integrity of
judicial proceedings by preventing litigants from asserting contradictory positions
for tactical gain. The precise rationale for and consequences of the doctrine vary.
18B Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Edward H. Cooper, Federal
Practice and Procedure § 4477 (2d ed. 2002 & Supp. 2012) (hereinafter ‘Wright
& Miller). Recognizing this, the Supreme Court examined the doctrine extensively
in New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 121 S.Ct. 1808, 149 L.Ed.2d 968
(2001), but in the end refused to establish an ‘inflexible formula.’ Relying instead
on several factors that often indicate the propriety of the sanction, the Court held
that a party may be estopped from asserting a position in a judicial proceeding
where it has previously persuaded a court to adopt a clearly contradictory
position to the disadvantage of an opponent. See also Reed v. City of Arlington,
650 F.3d 571 (5" Cir.2001) (en banc). Reed also notes, ‘Because judicial estoppel
is an equitable doctrine, courts may apply it flexibly to achieve substantial
justice.’ Id. at 576.”

The Court decided that there was an inconsistency in Chevron’s statements regarding
the status of this arbitration under the Treaty as a ‘foreign or international tribunal’
within the meaning of Section 1782. In other legal proceedings under Section 1782,
Chevron (as the applicant) had successfully asserted that this arbitration fell within the
legislative definition, whereas in these particular proceedings Chevron (resisting the
Respondent’s application) was asserting the contrary. As the judgment states: “Why
shouldn’t sauce for Chevron’s goose be sauce for the Ecuador gander as well?”*? The
answer to this question, in addition to other matters decided by the Court, was that it

should.

The Tribunal does not seek here to apply the doctrine of “judicial estoppel” as
recognised by the laws of the USA. International law, not the laws of the USA, is the
applicable law in this arbitration. However, it is clear that the mischief which this US
doctrine seeks to remedy, by its own nomenclature, is the same as the mischief to be
remedied under international law; namely: a deliberate want of good faith by a party’s
inconsistent statements calculated to thwart the integrity of the judicial process for its
own benefit and to the other party’s prejudice. As Dr Bin Cheng stated (quoted above),
the remedy “has its basis in common sense and common justice”; or, more colloquially
in the words of the Fifth Circuit, sauce for the goose should also be sauce for the

gander.

Applying Article 26 of the VCLT and customary international law, the Tribunal
decides that the Parties are bound to act in good faith in the exercise of their rights and
the performance of their respective obligations under the Arbitration Agreement
derived from Article VI of the Treaty. That duty of good faith precludes clearly
inconsistent statements, deliberately made for one party’s material advantage or to the
other’s material prejudice, that adversely affect the legitimacy of the arbitral process.
In other words, no party to this arbitration can ‘have it both ways’ or ‘blow hot and
cold’, to affirm a thing at one time and to deny that same thing at another time

according to the mere exigencies of the moment.

The Tribunal here bases its decision on the general principle of good faith under
international law applied to the Parties’ obligations under their Arbitration Agreement,
rather than upon any specific doctrine derived from the Anglo-Saxon concept of
equitable estoppel by conduct or representation. Dr Bin Cheng recognised that,
although estoppel is consistent with the general principle of good faith, it is a different
doctrine under international law. As Lord McNair wrote in regard to The Fur Seal
Arbitration (above), that decision did not involve “estoppel eo nomine’, but a broader
principle precluding a State, in his words, from ‘blowing hot and cold’; i.e. the

principle of good faith.

The Lago Agrio Court, by the Lago Agrio Judgment, treated Chevron following the
“merger” with Texaco in 2001, as legally indistinct from Texaco and TexPet (as
described in Part V above). In particular, it was there decided (inter alia): “ ... the

obligation to submit to Ecuadorian justice pending on Texaco Inc. was also

Part VII — Page 31

7.109

7.110

7AM

transmitted to new company Chevron Texaco Corporation, so that consequently
Chevron Corp. cannot allege that it never operated in Ecuador to give grounds for
lack of a legitimate opposing party” (see Lines 299 to 302 of Annex 7 to Part V,
emphasis here supplied). In other words, the Lago Agrio Judgment treated Chevron as
if, like TexPet, it had operated in Ecuador from 1964 onwards as a party to the
Concession Agreements of 1964 and 1973, with significant assets in Ecuador. Thus,
according to the Lago Agrio Judgment (as upheld by the Lago Agrio Appellate and
Cassation Courts), Chevron had assets equating to to investments in Ecuador from

1964 onwards.

These statements were unequivocally made in the Lago Agrio Judgment and left intact
by the judgments of the Lago Agrio Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts,
forming part of the judicial branch of the Respondent. The acts of its judicial branch
are attributable to the Respondent under international law: Article 4(1) of the ILC
Articles on State Responsibility. The position of the Respondent by its judicial branch

contrasts starkly with the position of the Respondent in this arbitration.

Here, for its jurisdictional objections, the Respondent seeks to distinguish between the
respective legal personalities of Chevron and TexPet (as also Texaco). The
Respondent then seeks to draw, under Articles 1(1), II(3)(a), II(3)(c), VI(1)(a) and
VI(1)(c) of the Treaty as regards relevant “investments”, a material difference between
Chevron on the one hand and TexPet (with Texaco) on the other. The Respondent
contends unequivocally that, unlike TexPet, Chevron never had any presence in
Ecuador, with no assets and no relevant investment in Ecuador. As described above,

that difference is contradicted in the Lago Agrio Judgment.

It is impossible for the Tribunal to reconcile the statements in the Lago Agrio
Judgment as to the “merger” between Chevron, TexPet and Texaco with the
submissions made by the Respondent in this arbitration. The Respondent’s
jurisdictional objections to Chevron’s claims are manifestly inconsistent with the
unequivocal statements made by the Respondent’s own judicial branch in treating
Chevron with TexPet and Texaco for all their activities in Ecuador from 1964

onwards.

Applying the principle of good faith under international law to the exercise of rights
and the performance of obligations under the Arbitration Agreement, the Tribunal
decides that it is impermissible for the Respondent to ‘blow hot and cold’ or to ‘have it
both ways’, to Chevron’s detriment and to the Respondent’s benefit. In other words,
the Respondent cannot now defeat, under the principle of good faith, the object and
purpose of the Arbitration Agreement derived from Article VI of the Treaty with a
jurisdictional objection under Article 21 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules treating
Chevron so differently from TexPet and Texaco as regards assets and, therefore,
“investments” in Ecuador from 1964 onwards. The Tribunal concludes that the
Respondent is required in this arbitration, as a matter of good faith, to treat Chevron as
‘standing in the shoes’ of TexPet (with Texaco), consistently with the statements made

and acted upon by the Respondent’s judicial branch in the Lago Agrio Litigation.

The Tribunal has taken fully into account that the principle of good faith may be more
cautiously applied to justify a tribunal’s jurisdiction, as compared to other non-
jurisdictional issues. Nevertheless, there is no reason why the same principle of good
faith should not apply to jurisdiction (or admissibility), as well as to the merits. It did

so in the Kunkel arbitration decided almost a century ago (1926).

Accordingly, subject to other issues addressed later below, the Tribunal decides that it
has jurisdiction over Chevron’s claims under of the Treaty, as it does for TexPet’s

claims, under Articles VI(1)(a) and VI(1)(c) of the Treaty.

(5) The Tribunal’s Conclusion as to “Investment”: For these several reasons, subject
to the following issues, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimants’ cases as regards a
relevant investment suffice to meet the Respondent’s jurisdictional objections to the
Claimants’ claims under the FET standard in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty (including
protection against denial of justice) and the Umbrella Clause in Article II(3)(c) of the

Treaty.

(6) Judicial Finality (Local Remedies): As to the second part of the Respondent’s
jurisdictional objections, there is no suggestion in this case that any requirement as to
judicial finality has been waived by the Respondent, whether in the Treaty or
otherwise. It therefore applies to the Claimants’ claims for denial of justice made

under the FET standard in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty.

83 J, Crawford, The International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibili

In the Tribunal’s view, it is well settled that a claimant asserting a claim for denial of
justice committed by a State’s judicial system must satisfy, whether as a matter of
jurisdiction or admissibility, a requirement as to the exhaustion of local remedies or, as
now better expressed, a substantive rule of judicial finality.** Even the grossest
misconduct by a lower court or manifest unfairness in its procedures is not by itself
sufficient to amount to a denial of justice by a State, unless the judicial remedies that
exist in that State either do not correct the deficiencies in the lower court’s judgment
(once exhausted by the foreign national) or are such that none affords to the foreign
national any reasonable prospect of correcting those deficiencies in a timely, fair and

effective manner.

In brief,®* as already summarised above, Chevron contends that it has met the
requirement of judicial finality, by its successive but unsuccessful appeals before the
Lago Agrio Appellate Court, Cassation Court and (most recently) the Constitutional
Court. The Claimants’ counsel, Professor Paulsson, acknowledged that an
international wrong for denial of justice does not occur until reasonable attempts have
been made by the wronged claimant to secure the local remedies available within the
State’s own local legal system. However, Professor Paulson also submitted that a
claimant is not required to exhaust any local remedy that offers no reasonable prospect
of success. The requirement is limited to “reasonable attempts” to right the wrong

within the State’s own legal system.*°

In brief,®° as also summarised above, the Respondent contends that Chevron has not
met the requirement of judicial finality, thereby precluding its claims for denial of

justice in limine (whether as a matter of jurisdiction or admissibility).

At the Track II Hearing, the Respondent’s Counsel, Professor Mayer, accepted that a

judicial remedy would not need to be pursued “in the absence of a reasonable

 

: Introduction, Text and

Commentaries (2002), explains that a claim is inadmissible if any available and effective local remedy has not
been exhausted “when the claim is one to which the rule of exhaustion of local remedies applies” (Article 44).
The rule does not, of course, apply where an initial defect in a lower is corrected by an appellate court because
there can then be no claim for denial of justice. The Tribunal also acknowledges the scholarly debate between
the two concepts underlying this rule: the procedural concept and the substantive concept. In the absence of

waiver, that debate is not relevant to the present case; and the Tribunal does not therefore need to addr

it here.

possibility of effective redress.”*’ The Respondent contends that Chevron failed
reasonably to pursue its effective legal remedies within the Ecuadorian legal system,
particularly (as regards the alleged denial of justice) under the Ecuadorian Collusion
Prosecution Act (the “CPA”). The Respondent also contends that Chevron’s failure to
request the Lago Agrio Appellate Court to fix the amount of a bond and to pay such
bond, so as to suspend the enforceability of the Lago Agrio Judgment, led to the
alleged injury of which the Claimants complain. It was, according to the Respondent,
“an intervening direct and immediate cause of the enforceability of the Judgment,
breaking the ‘causal nexus’ required for a showing of denial of justice”.** At the Track
II Hearing, the Respondent also invoked Chevron’s incomplete proceedings before the
Constitutional Court, a submission no longer relevant with the Constitutional Court’s

Judgment of 27 June 2018.

The Tribunal refers to the classic statement as to judicial finality in the final award of
the NAFTA tribunal in Loewen v USA (2003), where the claimants were held to have
failed to comply with the substantive rule of judicial finality by not appealing to the

US Supreme Court:®

“154. No instance has been drawn to our attention in which an international
tribunal has held a State responsible for a breach of international law constituted
by a lower court decision when there was available an effective and adequate
appeal within the State’s legal system.”

“156. The purpose of the requirement that a decision of a lower court be
challenged through the judicial process before the State is responsible for a
breach of international law constituted by judicial decision is to afford the State
the opportunity of redressing through its legal system the inchoate breach of
international law occasioned by the lower court decision ...”

“215. Here we encounter the central difficulty in Loewen’s case. Loewen failed to
present evidence disclosing its reasons for entering into the settlement agreement
in preference to pursuing other options, in particular the [US] Supreme Court
option ...”

“217. Accordingly, our conclusion is that Loewen failed to pursue its domestic
remedies, notably the Supreme Court option and that, in consequence, Loewen
has not shown a violation of customary international law and a violation of
NAFTA for which Respondent is responsible.”

This decision was made unanimously by three eminent and experienced jurists, of
great renown. It remains the lodestar relevant to the specific issue here under
consideration.*° The Tribunal does not understand from the Parties’ submissions that
there exists any material difference between them as to the applicable legal principle,
as expressed in Loewen. Their differences arise from its application to the facts of the

present case.

For the present case, the Tribunal considers that the crucial part of the statements in
Loewen, is that the availability of a local remedy “is not a standard to be determined or
applied in the abstract. It means reasonably available to the complainant in light of its
situation....”°! As also stated above, the local remedy must be available as “an
effective and adequate appeal within the State’s legal system.” It clearly does not
include any ineffective or inadequate or, equally, any untimely remedy. The test is

similarly expressed in the later awards in Jan de Nul (2008) and Pantechniki (2009).

In the Tribunal’s view, the overall test for such availability is that of reasonableness
applied to the complainant, assessed at the relevant time. Applied to the present case,
it would be wrong in principle to require Chevron to have pursued at the time any
local remedy in Ecuador that lacked any reasonable prospect of a timely, effective and
adequate protection against the enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment within and,
especially, without Ecuador. As with all its allegations, the legal burden of proving
such ineffective protection, once a potential procedure has been identified by the
Respondent, rests upon Chevron under Article 24(1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration
Rules.

In the light of the statements in Loewen, the Tribunal addresses the application of this
requirement of judicial finality to: (i) the Bond, (ii) the CPA and (iii) the

Constitutional Court, as invoked by the Respondent.

(i) The Bond: The enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment was suspended pending
Chevron’s appeal to the Lago Agrio Appellate Court. The Appellate Court issued its
judgment, dismissing Chevron’s appeal from the Lago Agrio Judgment, on 3 January
2012.°? It issued its Clarification Order on 13 January 2012.°? On 20 January 2012,
Chevron filed a cassation appeal with the Appellate Court (of some 176 pages).
Chevron there requested the Appellate Court (inter alia) to suspend the enforcement of
its judgment (thereby continuing the suspension of the Lago Agrio Judgment’s
enforcement) and to declare that there was no requirement for Chevron to post a bond

to suspend the Appellate Court’s Judgment.”

On 17 February 2012, the Appellate Court refused Chevron’s request to suspend the
enforcement of its judgment pending Chevron’s cassation appeal. The Appellate Court
decided also that its judgment would have been suspended pending the cassation
appeal (thereby suspending the enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment) if Chevron
had requested the posting of a bond and had posted a bond, which it had not done.?°
On 24 February 2012, Chevron requested the Appellate Court to revoke its order of 17
February 2012.°° By order of 1 March 2012, the Appellate Court rejected Chevron’s
request, confirming the non-suspension of its judgment. It thereby declared the

enforceability of the Lago Agrio Judgment.”

By the time of the Lago Agrio Appellate Court’s order of 1 March 2012, this Tribunal,
in order to preserve the rights of the Parties pending its decision on the merits, had
already issued interim measures requiring the Respondent (including its judicial
branch) not to permit the enforceability of the Lago Agrio Judgment: see its Orders
and Interim Awards on Interim Measures of 28 January 2011, 9 February 2011, 16

Tribunal had secured Chevron’s cross-undertaking in damages for these interim
measures with an order that the Claimants pay US$ 50 million to the PCA, which was

duly paid by the Claimants and is held to the order of the Tribunal in this arbitration.

One of the grounds invoked by Chevron in support of its application of 20 January
2012 to the Lago Agrio Appellate Court was that the effect of this Tribunal’s orders
and awards, particularly its Order of 9 February 2011, was that the enforcement of the
Lago Agrio Judgment was “currently suspended” by the Tribunal. At page 160 of its

cassation appeal, Chevron pleaded:

“(a) That the appellate judgment shall not be enforced because its enforcement is
currently suspended by order of the Arbitral Tribunal at The Hague;

(b) That, as a consequence of the foregoing, the [Appellate Court] declare that
there is no requirement to post a bond to suspend enforcement of the judgment; ...

(d) That the [Appellate Court] Clerk refrain from certifying that the judgment is
enforceable;

(e) That in the court order by which the Appellate Court declares that
enforcement of the judgment is currently suspended, it orders the enforcement
judge to refrain from issuing any order that initiates a proceeding for enforcement
of the same; ...”
On 30 May 2012, consistent with the order of the Lago Agrio Appellate Court of 1
March 2012, the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs began enforcement proceedings in Canada,
followed by enforcement proceedings in Brazil on 27 June 2012. On 3 August 2012,
the Lago Agrio Court (i.e. the enforcement judge) ordered the enforcement of the
Lago Agrio Judgment in the total amount of US$ 19,041,414,529.00, payable by

Chevron within 24 hours.”

The Respondent (by its judicial branch), in declaring the Lago Agrio Judgment to be
enforceable with the Lago Agrio Appellate Court’s order of 1 March 2012 and the
Lago Agrio Court’s enforcement order of 3 August 2012, did not comply with this

Tribunal’s Orders and Interim Awards.!

°° C1404.

100 In its Fourth Interim Award, the Tribunal decided that the Lago Agrio Judgment was made “final, enforceable
and subject to execution within Ecuador by the Respondent no later than 3 August 2012”. The Tribunal relied
(inter alia) upon the Respondent’s submissions at the hearing on 11 February 2012 (see February Hearing

Part VII - Page 38

7.131

7.132

7.133

7.134

The Tribunal recognised at the time of its orders and awards (as it does still) that
national courts have legal responsibilities to discharge under their State’s laws and
constitution; that the exercise of such responsibilities may impinge upon the rights of
third parties; and that in this new world of interaction between international tribunals
and national courts, there is a need to proceed with mutual respect and sensitivity to
each other’s functions. Nonetheless, when the State has chosen to establish procedures
in parallel to its national court system (as it has here under the Treaty), it is incumbent
on the State to ensure that the commitments that it has agreed are not defeated or

subverted by actions of its national agencies, including its judicial branch.

Before 1 March 2012, as already indicated, this Tribunal had ordered the Respondent,
under its several orders and awards on interim measures, not to declare the Lago Agrio
Judgment enforceable. Chevron was entitled to rely upon those orders and awards,
which were legally binding upon the Respondent under the Arbitration Agreement to
which the Respondent had decided to commit itself. Moreover, given that the
Respondent (by its judicial branch) knowingly did not comply with these orders and
awards, it would inappropriate for the Respondent now to profit from its own wrong
under the general principle of international law known by its Latin maxim: nullus

commodum capere de sua injuria propria.!°!

The Tribunal also relies upon two further factors. First, at the time (after the Lago
Agrio Appellate Court’s judgment), there were insufficient prospects of favourable
relief on Chevron’s appeal to the Cassation Court. Such a cassation appeal could not
be a full appeal addressing Chevron’s multiple complaints regarding the Lago Agrio
Litigation and Lago Agrio Judgment. Apart from relief against punitive damages

ordered by the Lago Agrio Judgment, this was later to prove to be the case.

Second, the amount of the bond would, on the case advanced by both the Claimants
and the Respondent, have been so high as to amount to a practical denial of access to
the Cassation Court by Chevron. Dr Coronel testified that the amount of the bond
would have been between US$ 1.9 billion and US$ 14.6 billion.!° At the Track II

Hearing, the Respondent’s Counsel stated that the amount of the bond would have

 

D1.167ff). For present purposes, the difference of some four months between 1 March and 3 August 2012 is not

material.

Part VII - Page 39

been fixed in an amount between 1% and 5% of the amounts at stake.'°? Applied to
the Lago Agrio Judgment, as affirmed by the Appellate Court in the total sum of US$
18 billion, the amount of the bond would have been between US$ 180 million and

US$ 14.6 billion. These are not trifling amounts.

In the circumstances prevailing at the time, the Tribunal does not consider it
reasonable to require Chevron to have posted a bond of this size so as to suspend the
enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment, as affirmed by the Lago Agrio Appellate
Judgment. Moreover, upon the exhaustion of Chevron’s appellate remedies with the
Constitutional Court’s Judgment of 27 June 2018, the failure to post a bond has now
no legal significance: such a bond could only have suspended the enforcement of the
Lago Agrio Judgment pending the completion of the appellate process; and the failure

to exhaust a local remedy does not extinguish the underlying international wrong.

(ii) The Collusion Prosecution Act (CPA): Under Article 6 of the Collusion
Prosecution Act (CPA), a party claiming to be the victim of collusive legal
proceedings before an Ecuadorian Court may impugn the resulting judgment. It
provides: “If the grounds for the claim are confirmed, measures to void the collusive
proceeding will be issued, invalidating the act or acts ... and redressing the harm
caused... and, as a general matter, restoring the things to the state prior to the
collusion”. Articles 4 and 5 of the CPA permit the complaining party to present
evidence and participate in a hearing under the CPA; and Articles 6 and 7 specify the
CPA’s remedies, including the judgment’s nullification, damages against and

imprisonment of the miscreants. !°*

In its judgment of 12 November 2013, the Cassation Court referred to the CPA, as

follows (with footnotes here omitted): !°>

When collusion is an independent action governed by our Ecuadorian
legislation, it is so regulated under the Collusion Prosecution Act; and, as stated
by this Division of the Court, it is not possible to seek the cassation of a judgment
by making these kinds of allegations ... Therefore, the affirmation made by the
court of appeals is the correct one, as it is not within its scope of that court to
have jurisdiction to hear collusive action cases within a summary verbal

proceeding, or procedural fraud, judges’ behaviors, proper and improper
meetings, the appointment of substitute judges, plaintiffs’ connivance, among
other allegations made by the appellant company ...”

The Tribunal found this passage, at first, difficult to follow. To the Tribunal’s
understanding, the Cassation Court was here deciding that cases of collusion under the
CPA are reserved to the exclusive jurisdiction of judges vested with jurisdiction under
the CPA in respect of the matters described in this passage. Accordingly, in respect of
such matters, these CPA judges have exclusive jurisdiction as a first instance court,
although eventually their decisions may be subject to successive appeals within the

Ecuadorian judicial system.

This difficulty was resolved by the Judgment of the Constitutional Court. The Court
there unequivocally confirmed that the Cassation Court was correct in deciding that it
lacked any jurisdiction to address or redress “the arguments expounded by Chevron”
(as also the Constitutional Court), with Chevron’s only remedy avaible before CPA
judges under the CPA: see the extracts from Chapter 2 of its Judgment in Part V

above.

In his sixth expert report of 7 May 2014 (with footnotes here omitted), Dr Coronel

testified as to ‘how an action under the CPA operates’ :!°°

“32. The action for collusion must be filed before a civil judge. That judgment
issued by the trial court judge may be appealed before the respective Provincial
Court, and the appellate court judgment may be appealed by cassation before the
National Court of Justice. Finally, even after the decision of the National Court of
Justice is rendered, it could be possible to file an extraordinary action for
protection before the Constitutional Court.

33. Chevron has asked me to explain whether or not interim measures may be
granted within a collusion action. Specifically, Chevron has asked me to explain if
a plaintiff in an action for collusion, brought [regarding] a trial in which there
has allegedly been procedural fraud, whose judgment is in the process of being
enforced within and without Ecuador, could obtain any interim measure
suspending the enforcement of this judgment. In my opinion, the answer is no.

34. First, none of the applicable rules on preventive measures grants a judge the
power to order the suspension of a judgment that has been declared to be
enforceable by another court. There are no specific norms regarding interim
measures in the Collusion Act, but the same law states that the Code of Civil

06 Coronel ER 6, paras 32-37.

Part VII - Page 41

Procedure applies in a subsidiary manner where there are no other express
provisions in the law.

35. According to the Code of Civil Procedure, there are only four types of
preventive measures that a party can seek in any state of a lawsuit: (i) the
sequestration of a thing, (ii) the withholding of funds, credits, or assets, (iii) the
prohibition to sell real property, and the (iv) prohibition from leaving the country.
The types of interim measures are thus circumscribed by law; indeed, recognizing
the limited nature of the powers of Ecuadorian judges regarding interim
measures, several bills have suggested that such powers be broadened, but they
have not passed. None of these four possible preventive measures are a
mechanism to suspend the enforcement of a decision.

36. Second, under the hypothetical presented, there would not be any interim
measures available because none of the requisites established by law would be in
place for them to be ordered. Three of these measures (the attachment, seizure,
and prohibition from leaving the country) require the existence of a credit in favor
of the petitioner to be granted. A credit is a personal right which may be
demanded by creditor to debtor, who must give something or do or refrain from
doing something. A debt or a judgment are credits, but a right of action or a
pending lawsuit are not credits. In this hypothetical case, there would be no credit
in favor of petitioner. In the case of the restraining order against selling, to obtain
it, the existence of a credit must be evidenced or it must be proven that a lawsuit
concerning specific property is taking place and that the restraining order against
selling concerns that property. In the hypothetical case presented to me, those
conditions or requirements were not present.

37. Finally, [judicial] practice confirms what I have stated. I am unaware of any
case or precedent in which the Ecuadorian courts have issued an order of this
nature.”

7.141 In brief, Chevron contends that collateral (or parallel) proceedings under the CPA

7.142

would have been “‘a wild goose chase”.'!°’ Such proceedings would have involved a
personal claim against Judge Zambrano and like claims against other alleged
miscreants, in separate independent proceedings.'°* Such proceedings would not have
suspended the enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment, within or, particularly,

without Ecuador in an effective and timely manner.

In brief, the Respondent contends that proceedings under the CPA were an available
local remedy (until time-barred) that would have permitted Chevron to address and, if

supported by persuasive evidence, obtain effective redress for its claims for ‘fraud’ in

‘7 Track II Hearing D1.144.

the Lago Agrio Litigation and the ‘ghostwriting’ of the Lago Agrio Judgment.!° The
Respondent also submits that Chevron’s chances of success under the CPA were not
“tiny” 10
In its Track II Rejoinder, the Respondent acknowledged that a judgment from the CPA
would take about 18 months, followed by successive appeals within the Ecuadorian
legal system.'!! At the Track II Hearing, the Respondent acknowledged that, on
average, CPA proceedings take 17 months, with the CPA judgment only becoming

enforceable later by order of the first instance Appellate Court.!!?

The Tribunal accepts Dr Coronel’s expert testimony that there was no possibility of
interim measures under the CPA protecting Chevron’s position during the pendency of

any CPA proceedings and any subsequent appeals.

The Tribunal does not consider that any proceedings under the CPA, at the material
time, could reasonably have been expected to result in any sufficient remedy for
Chevron. It would have necessarily comprised one or more separate, collateral
proceedings; but, above all, the timing of any CPA proceedings made them ineffective
as a remedy for Chevron against the enforceability of the Lago Agrio Judgment.
Moreover, collusive action cases may be appropriate where it is alleged that there is
collusion between parties, witnesses or legal representatives; but where the complaint
raises procedural fraud, judicial misconduct and corruption within the Court itself, the
State cannot leave remedial action to the efforts of private litigants — the State has its
own responsibility to act by its several investigatory, prosecutorial and judicial

agencies.

As regards timing, it was essential that the risk of enforcement of the Lago Agrio
Judgment, which could have been disastrous for Chevron (as envisaged in the Invictus
Memorandum), be removed whilst the serious allegations of gross procedural and
judicial improprieties in the Lago Agrio Court were addressed within the Ecuadorian
legal system. That was not possible, given the fact that the Lago Agrio Judgment

became enforceable under Ecuadorian law and, thus, enforceable outwith Ecuador on

1 March 2012 (see above).!!3 There was, therefore, insufficient time to complete any
CPA proceedings (including one or more appeals) before the Lago Agrio Judgment
became enforceable, with enforcement proceedings beginning shortly thereafter on 30

May 2012.

There is therefore no reason to assume, assessed objectively at the time, that any
collateral (or parallel) relief under the CPA could have protected Chevron from the
enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment in a sufficiently timely, effective and
adequate manner. The Tribunal also notes the statement, in Pantechniki, that it may
not be necessary for a claimant to resort to “oblique or indirect applications to parallel

jurisdictions”.!!4

In the circumstances prevailing at the time, the Tribunal does not consider it
reasonable to require Chevron to have begun collateral proceedings under the CPA in
an attempt to suspend the enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment, as affirmed by the

Lago Agrio Appellate Judgment.

(iii) The Constitutional Court: On 23 December 2013, Chevron submitted to the
Constitutional Court its “extraordinary action for protection” impugning, on
constitutional grounds, the Lago Agrio Judgment. As at the Track II Hearing,
Chevron’s application remained pending before the Constitutional Court.!!> At that
time, there was no information available to the Claimants as to when the

Constitutional Court was likely to arrive at any decision.

Subsequently, there was a procedural hearing on 16 July 2015 before the
Constitutional Court; on 2 October 2015, the Constitutional Court’s Secretary-General
advised the Parties that the Court had received the Presiding Judge’s draft ruling; on
25 July 2017, the Court advised the Parties that it would require a further hearing, at a
date to be fixed; but no hearing date had been fixed as at April 2018.''® According to
the Respondent’s letter dated 20 April 2018, the Constitutional Court’s judgment

“ought to be forthcoming in the coming months or year”.

7.154

7.155

As already indicated in Part V above, the Constitutional Court held a public hearing on

22 May 2018; and it issued its Judgment on 27 June 2018.!!7

The Tribunal considers that Chevron’s action before the Constitutional Court did not
offer to Chevron any timely and effective remedy for the Lago Agrio Judgment within
the Ecuadorian legal system. As already indicated, the Lago Agrio Judgment became
enforceable on 1 March 2012; foreign enforcement proceedings were commenced on
30 May 2012; and the Lago Agrio Judgment’s execution was ordered against Chevron
and TexPet in Ecuador on 3 August and 15 October 2012. The Constitutional Court’s
Judgment was issued more than 4/2 years after Chevron commenced its action before
the Court; and its action was dismissed by the Court. The Tribunal also notes the
statement in Jan de Nul v Egypt (supra) that “it would make no sense to insist upon the
exhaustion of remedies that are unavailable precisely because the issuance of an

appealable decision is delayed”.!!8

Accordingly, the Tribunal does not consider it reasonable to require Chevron to have
awaited the result of its action before the Constitutional Court before pursuing its
claims in this arbitration under Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty (including its protection
against denial of justice. In any event, given its action’s dismissal, Chevron has
exhausted its remedies within the Ecuadorian judicial system comprising the Lago

Agrio Appelate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts.

(7) The Tribunal’s Conclusion as to Judicial Finality: The Tribunal rejects the
Respondent’s objections, both as to jurisdiction and admissibility, based on Chevron’s
failure to exhaust local remedies or to satisfy the requirement of judicial finality for its

claims for denial of justice under the FET standard in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty.

(8) Amendment of the Claims: The Tribunal turns to the third part of the jurisdictional
objection to the Claimants’ claims for denial of justice under Article II(3)(a) of the
Treaty, as here also raised by the Tribunal upon its own initiative. Further, although
not expressly pleaded by the Respondent as a jurisdictional objection, possibly
because the Respondent also amended its defence during the course of these

proceedings (albeit with no objection by the Claimants), the Tribunal considers it

appropriate to treat the Respondent’s jurisdictional objections as implicitly including

this third part.

The Claimants’ claims for denial of justice under the FET standard in Article II(3)(a)
of the Treaty, based on the alleged ‘ghostwriting’ of the Lago Agrio Judgment, were
not pleaded in their original Notice of Arbitration submitted under Article 2 of the
UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. Nor could they be. The Claimant’s Notice was
submitted on 23 September 2009. The Lago Agrio Judgment was subsequently issued
on 14 February 2011 and declared to be enforceable on 1 March 2012 by the Lago
Agrio Appellate Court. Within five weeks, on 20 March 2012, the Claimants
introduced Chevron’s claims for denial of justice in this arbitration by their
Supplemental Memorial on the Merits, as thereafter supplemented in writing and

orally up to and including the Track IT Hearing.!!°

A similar timing analysis applies, mutatis mutandis, to the Claimants’ claims under the
Umbrella Clause in Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty regarding the 1995 Settlement
Agreement. That alleged breach of the Treaty took place not before the Lago Agrio
Judgment of 14 February 2011 and crystallised on 1 March 2012 with the order of the
Lago Agrio Appellate Court declaring the Lago Agrio Judgment enforceable.

The question arises whether these new claims can be maintained by the Claimants as
an amendment to their pleadings under (i) Article 20 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration
Rules; (ii) the Treaty; and (iii) Dutch law as the lex loci arbitri. The Claimants submit
they can. As already explained above, even without the Respondent’s express
jurisdictional objection, the Tribunal has a duty to check its jurisdiction upon its own

initiative, as it sought to do with the Parties at the Track IT Hearing. !”°

(i) The UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules: Article 20 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules

provides:

“During the course of the arbitral proceedings, either party may amend or
supplement his claim or defence unless the arbitral tribunal considers it
inappropriate to allow such amendment having regard to the delay in making it or
prejudice to the other party or any other circumstances. However, a claim may

not be amended in such a manner that it falls outside the scope of the arbitration
clause or separate arbitration agreement.”

Article 20 entitles a claimant to amend its claim without the prior permission of the
arbitral tribunal. The word “claim” in Article 20 signifies the claimant’s statement of
claim, as does “defence” the respondent’s statement of defence (or counterclaim),
whether in their original form or as supplemented under Article 22 of the UNCITRAL
Arbitration Rules. The amendment is not limited to a specific claim or specific defence
already pleaded by a party.!?! In principle, therefore, a claimant has the right to amend
its pleaded case at any time (subject to the tribunal’s procedural orders otherwise),
including matters occurring after the notice of arbitration. Having done so, the tribunal
has a discretionary power to disallow such an amendment by virtue of any of the three
factors listed in Article 20; namely (i) delay; (ii) prejudice; and (iii) other

circumstances.

As regards the fourth factor (where the tribunal has no discretion), jurisdiction, the
Tribunal notes that it requires that the amended claim should “not fall outside the
tribunal’s jurisdiction under the arbitration clause or agreement”.!?? Thus, the
jurisdictional difficulty that can arise in an ad hoc arbitration, resulting from the
difference between the scope of the arbitration clause and the scope of the reference
under that clause, does not arise in an UNCITRAL arbitration with Article 20 of the

UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. '?3

In the Tribunal’s view, there is no difficulty arising from the interpretation of
Article 20 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. Any difficulty arises from its

application to the present case.

The application of Article 20 was considered by the UNCITRAL tribunal in European

American Bank v Slovakia (2014). The respondent had there amended its statement of

defence to add a late jurisdictional objection. The tribunal decided (with footnotes here

) 124

“115. The Tribunal considers that what is now explicit in Article 23(2) of the
2010 Rules was implicit in [Article 20 of] the 1976 Rules. To preclude a
respondent from making a jurisdictional objection after it submitted its statement
of defence when that objection concerned facts which arose only after the date on
which that statement was filed would involve a grave injustice. That injustice
would be particularly grave where, as here, the new facts involve conduct on the
part of the Claimant which the Claimant chose not to notify to the Respondent or
the Tribunal. The Tribunal notes that the leading commentary on the UNCITRAL
Rules [citing D. Caron & L. Kaplan] points out that the Conference which
adopted the 1976 Rules considered that the inclusion of a provision in what
became Article 21(3) of the 1976 Rules expressly permitting a tribunal to allow a
late jurisdictional plea was unnecessary, because the provision on amendment in
Article 20 and the broad general power of the tribunal ‘to conduct the arbitration
in such manner as it considers appropriate’ were sufficient. The commentary
concludes: ‘The last sentence of Article 23(2) [of the 2010 Rules] thus expressly
states what was previously only implicit under the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules: that
the arbitral tribunal has discretion in limited circumstances to admit justifiably
late pleas, such as due to the discovery of new evidence.’

116. In consequence, the Tribunal finds that the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules do not
bar a party from raising a jurisdictional objection based upon facts which came
into existence, or which it could have discovered by reasonable inquiry, only after
the filing of a statement of defence.”

7.164 It would be possible here to cite at length similar decisions on the application of

7.165

7.166

Article 20 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules made by other UNCITRAL tribunals.
It is unnecessary to do so: the legal materials on the interpretation and application of
Article 20 amount to a liberal or pragmatic ‘jurisprudence constante’ already evident

from its own terms.

As to the first factor of “delay”, the Tribunal does not consider that the Claimants were
guilty of any material delay. They amended their case as promptly as they reasonably
could on 20 March 2012, following the Lago Agrio Appellate Court’s order declaring
the Lago Agrio Judgment enforceable on 1 March 2012.

Moreover, the Claimants had earlier pleaded in their Notice of Arbitration of 23

September 2009 other claims advanced under the FET standard in Article II(3)(a) of

24 European American Bank v Slovakia, PCA Case No 2010-17, Second Award on Jurisdiction of 4 June 2014,
paras 115-116.

the Treaty.'25 The Notice of Arbitration pleaded a “judicial farce” in the Lago Agrio
Litigation.'7° Its allegations related to (inter alia) the Cabrera Report and other
misconduct by the Lago Agrio Court, amounting to serious allegations of gross
procedural and judicial improprieties.'2’ It raised complaints regarding the 1995
Settlement Agreement.'?* The amended claims of 20 March 2012 for denial of justice
regarding the Lago Agrio Judgment were made under the same FET standard,
materially similar to the Claimants’ claims pleaded in 2009 (as supplemented by their

subsequent pleadings prior to March 2012).

As to the second factor, “prejudice”, the Tribunal does not consider that the
Respondent has suffered any material prejudice from the Claimants’ amended claims.
In particular, the Respondent has been afforded a full opportunity in Track II to
address the Claimants’ amended claims and to present its own case, as required by

Article 15(1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, including the Track II Hearing.

As to the third factor, “any other circumstances”, the Tribunal considers that no such
circumstance exists for the Tribunal to disallow the Claimants’ amended claims. In
particular, this is not a case where a new disputing party has sought to join as a co-
claimant, or where an existing party advances an entirely new claim wholly unrelated
to the parties’ existing dispute. The Claimants’ amended claims in regard to the Lago
Agrio Judgment (as affirmed by the Lago Agrio Appellate Court) were made by
existing claimants advancing claims under the same FET standard in Article II(3)(a)
and the same Umbrella Clause in Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty. These amended claims
arose from the same evolving dispute between the same disputing parties that had led
directly to the issuance and enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment in the same Lago

Agrio Litigation.

Moreover, from the time when this Tribunal was appointed in 2010, it was evident that
the Lago Agrio Judgment was a likely imminent event, with the potential to inflict
grave harm not only to the Claimants (particularly Chevron) but also, paradoxically, to
the Respondent also. That is why, so as to maintain the status quo and to avoid the

aggravation of the Parties’ dispute, the Tribunal made its several orders and awards for

25 C_NoA Sept. 2009, paras 69 & 76(2).

26 C_NoA Sept. 2009, para 44.

27 C_NoA Sept. 2009, paras 47-54.

interim measures intended temporarily to preclude the Lago Agrio Judgment’s
issuance and enforcement by the Respondent’s judicial branch. The Claimants’
amended claims following the Lago Agrio Judgment did not therefore fall
unexpectedly from a clear blue sky in this arbitration. These amended claims were a
foreseeable evolution of the Parties’ existing dispute; and they did not transform the
Claimants’ case against the Respondent in this arbitration into an entirely new and

different dispute.

Further, in all the circumstances, the Tribunal considers that it would be an
unreasonable, if not absurd, result for the Claimants to advance their amended claims
as new claims in a new arbitration before a new arbitral tribunal, at unnecessarily
greater expense and delay, with the risk of inconsistent decisions. It could serve no
useful purpose to any of the Parties. If the Claimants had sought to do so, the
Respondent would have had every right to object to such an abuse of process. There is
an overall balancing exercise to be performed by the Tribunal in the exercise of its
discretion as a matter of common sense, under this third factor in Article 20 of the

UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.

129

In this regard, the Tribunal notes the award in Encana v Ecuador (2006 where the

UNCITRAL tribunal decided:

“\.. @ balance must be struck between, on the one hand, unreasonably requiring
that new proceedings be commenced where the substance of a claim of breach of
the BIT [the Ecuador-Canada BIT] may arguably have been made out or very
nearly made out, and subsequent events put the question of breach beyond doubt,
and, on the other, allowing what are in essence new claims or new causes of
action which in reality have no real relation to the events initially relied upon, to
be added onto existing proceedings on the basis of events subsequent to the
commencement of proceedings.”

In this arbitration, as a matter of reasonableness and common sense, the Tribunal

strikes that balance towards the first and not the second of these two alternatives.

Australia), 1CJ, Judgment, 26 June 1992, 1992 ICJ Reports 240, paras 62-70, declaring claims not included in

the original application inadmis

ible insofar as they constituted “both in form and in substance, a new claim, and

  

the subject of the dispute originally submitted to the Court would be transformed if it entertained that claim”
(para 70). See also Grand River Enterprises Six Nations, Ltd., et al. v. United States of America, UNCITRAL

7.176

As to the fourth factor in Article 20 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal
has decided above in favour of its jurisdiction (with admissibility) to decide the
Claimants’ claims. Thus, in relation to the Lago Agrio Judgment, Article 20 does not
require the Tribunal to disallow the Claimants’ amended claims for want of

jurisdiction under the Arbitration Agreement.

(ii) The Treaty: As to the Treaty, the Parties’ Arbitration Agreement expressly
incorporates the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. Thus, by consent from the outset of
these arbitration proceedings, the right of any Party to amend its pleaded case (whether
it be as claimant or respondent) was governed by Article 20 of the UNCITRAL
Arbitration Rules, as a self-contained procedural code. Provided the amendment meets
the requirements of Article 20 (including jurisdiction and admissibility), the Tribunal
considers that nothing in the Treaty precludes such an amendment, even in regard to
an event occurring after the arbitration’s commencement. Thus, the Tribunal sees no
cause under the Treaty barring the Claimants’ amended claims under Articles II(3)(a)

and II(3)(c) of the Treaty in regard to the Lago Agrio Judgment.

The Tribunal has also considered the position under international law generally, in the

absence of Article 20 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.

In Certain Questions of Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (Djibouti v. France),

the International Court of Justice observed:!*°

“When the Court has examined its jurisdiction over facts or events subsequent to
the filing of the application, it has emphasized the need to determine whether
those facts or events were connected to the facts or events already falling within
the Court’s jurisdiction and whether consideration of those later facts or events
would transform the ‘nature of the dispute’ ....”

The International Court of Justice has considered claims based on facts that occurred
after the filing of the Application on multiple occasions. For example, in Fisheries

Jurisdiction (Germany v. Iceland), Germany raised claims based on acts that post-

'8 Certain Questions of Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters (Djibouti v. France), \CJ, Judgment, 4 June
2008, 2008 ICJ Reports 177, para 87.

Part VII - Page 51

dated its Application. The Court had no difficulty in deciding that it had jurisdiction

over these claims, explaining: '*!

“The Court cannot accept the view that it would lack jurisdiction to deal with this
submission. The matter raised therein is part of the controversy between the
Parties, and constitutes a dispute relating to Iceland’s extension of its fisheries
jurisdiction. The submission is one based on facts subsequent to the filing of the
Application, but arising directly out of the question which is the subject-matter of
that Application. As such it falls within the scope of the Court’s jurisdiction
defined in the compromissory clause of the Exchange of Notes of 19 July 1961.”

7177 Similarly, in LaGrand (Germany v. United States), Germany made a submission based
entirely on facts that occurred after the filing of its Application. The Court held that it

had jurisdiction over this submission: !*7

“The third submission of Germany concerns issues that arise directly out of the
dispute between the Parties before the Court over which the Court has already
held that it has jurisdiction (see paragraph 42 above), and which are thus covered
by Article I of the Optional Protocol. The Court reaffirms, in this connection,
what it said in its Judgment in the Fisheries Jurisdiction case, where it declared
that in order to consider the dispute in all its aspects it may also deal with a
submission that ‘is one based on facts subsequent to the filing of the Application,
but arising directly out of the question which is the subject-matter of that
Application. As such it falls within the scope of the Court’s jurisdiction ...’
(Fisheries Jurisdiction (Federal Republic of Germany v. Iceland), Merits,
Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1974, p. 203, para. 72).”

   

7.178 Before the International Court of Justice, the appropriate test for determining the
existence of jurisdiction over facts occurring after the filing of an Application is
whether those facts “aris[e] directly out of the question which is the subject-matter of
[the] Application”. In the Tribunal’s view, the Claimants’ amended claims under
Articles II(3)(a) and II(3)(c) of the Treaty clearly arise directly from the Parties’
dispute pre-dating the Claimants’ Notice of Arbitration. Accordingly, even without
Article 20 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal sees no cause under
international law barring the Claimants’ amended claims under Articles II(3)(a) and

II(3)(c) of the Treaty in regard to the Lago Agrio Judgment.

(iii) Dutch Law: As to Dutch law, the Tribunal has been shown no mandatory or other
rule of Dutch law that could preclude the Claimants’ amended claims. At the Track II
Hearing, the Claimants’ Counsel, relaying advice from their Dutch Counsel, stated that

there was no such mandatory rule.'*? The Respondent did not then suggest otherwise.

(9) The Tribunal’s Conclusion as to the Amended Claims: The Tribunal concludes that
it has jurisdiction to decide the Claimants’ amended claims under the Parties’

Arbitration Agreement.
F: The Tribunal’s Final Conclusions

For these several reasons, the Tribunal decides the first of the Respondent’s
jurisdictional objections, as to a relevant “investment” under to the Treaty, in favour of
Chevron and (confirming its earlier decisions) TexPet. As to the requirement of
judicial finality the Tribunal decides the second of the Respondent’s jurisdictional
objections in favour of Chevron and (if and to the extent relevant) TexPet. As regards
the third part (also raised by the Tribunal upon its own initiative), the Tribunal decides
to leave the Claimants’ amended claims regarding the Lago Agrio Judgment (with the
judgments of the Lago Agrio Appellate and Cassation Courts) as pleaded and not to
disallow that pleading under Article 20 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.

Accordingly, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent’s jurisdictional objections to and
confirms its jurisdiction over the claims and amended claims pleaded by Chevron and
TexPet under the FET standard (including its protection against denial of justice) and
customary international law in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty and also under the
Umbrella Clause in Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty. Further, the Tribunal decides that
these claims are all admissible in this arbitration, and it rejects the Respondent’s

objections to the contrary effect under Articles VI(1)(a) and VI(1)(c) of the Treaty.

PART VIIT

THE MERITS OF
THE CLAIMANTS’ CLAIMS
AND THE RESPONDENT’S DEFENCES

A: Introduction

The Tribunal here addresses the merits of the Claimants’ claims and the Respondent’s
defences under the FET standard and customary international law in Article II(3)(a) of

the Treaty and under the Umbrella Clause in Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty.

It is again necessary to address and decide separately the issues under Article II(3)(a)
of the Treaty as regards denial of justice, and the issues under Article II(3)(c) of the

Treaty as regards the 1995 Settlement Agreement.

For both sets of issues, the Tribunal has again kept in mind that each of the Parties
bears the legal burden of proving its positive allegations under Article 24(1) of the

UNCITRAL Atbitration Rules.!
B: The Tribunal’s Analysis & Conclusion on the 1995 Settlement Agreement

Given the Tribunal’s earlier decisions in Track I and 1B of these arbitration
proceedings, which also record the Parties’ principal submissions on the 1995

Settlement Agreement, it is possible to address this part of the case succinctly.

In its First Partial Award, the Tribunal decided that Chevron and TexPet were both
“Releasees” under Article 5.1 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement and Article IV of the
1998 Final Release. The Tribunal also decided that Chevron and TexPet could invoke
their contractual rights as “Releasees” against the Respondent in regard to “diffuse”

claims (as there described).”

! Article 24(1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules provides: “Each party shall have the burden of proving the
facts relied on to support his claim or defence.”

? First Partial Award, para 112. (For ease of reference, as already indicated earlier in this Award, the Tribunal
has referred to the 1995 Settlement Agreement, the 1996 Release and the 1998 Final Release collectively as “the
1995 Settlement Agreement”).

Part VIII - Page 1

8.6

8.7

8.8

8.9

8.10

In the Tribunal’s view, such contractual rights correspond to an ‘obligation’ by the
Respondent towards each of Chevron and TexPet within the meaning of the Umbrella

Clause in Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty.

In Parts IV and V of this Award, the Tribunal has found that the Lago Agrio
Judgment, with the judgments of the Lago Agrio Appellate, Cassation and
Constitutional Courts, rests upon finding Chevron liable for diffuse claims in non-
compliance with the Respondent’s obligations to release Chevron (with TexPet and

Texaco) from such liability under the 1995 Settlement Agreement.

In the Tribunal’s view, by the acts of its judicial branch, attributable to the Respondent
under Article 4 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, the Respondent violated its
obligations under Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty, thereby committing international

wrongs towards each of Chevron and TexPet.

Chevron’s injury from such international wrong here requires no explanation: it was
the sole named defendant in the Lago Agrio Litigation and the sole named judgment
debtor under the Lago Agrio Judgment. Issues as to reparation for such injury in the
form of compensation claimed by Chevron are currently assigned to Track III of these

arbitration proceedings.

As already indicated in Part VII above, TexPet is in a different position from Chevron
for any injury resulting from the Lago Agrio Litigation and the Lago Agrio Judgment
(as affirmed by the Lago Agrio Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Court
Judgments). TexPet was not a named defendant to the Lago Agrio Litigation; nor was
it so identified in the Lago Agrio Judgment. However, as described in Parts TV and V
of this Award, the Lago Agrio Judgment held TexPet publicly responsible for
extensive environmental damage in the former concession area between 1964 and
1992; and, by its order of 15 October 2012, the Lago Agrio Court ordered the
execution of the Lago Agrio Judgment against (inter alios) TexPet by name and
attached TexPet’s remaining assets in Ecuador. As with Chevron, issues as to
reparation for any injury in the form of compensation claimed by TexPet are currently

assigned to Track III of these arbitration proceedings.

Part VIII — Page 2

8.16

In conclusion, under the Umbrella Clause in Article III(3)(c) of the Treaty, the
Tribunal decides that the Respondent is liable to make reparation to each of Chevron

and TexPet, as addressed in Parts IX and X below.
C: The Parties’ Cases as to Denial of Justice

The Parties’ respective factual and expert cases have been addressed at length in Parts
IV, V and VI above, on which the Tribunal has made its findings. It would therefore
serve no purpose to recite these cases in full here, save for the following summaries

for ease of reference.

(1) The Claimants’ Case: In brief,’ as regards denial of justice, the Claimants at the
Track II Hearing summarised the defects in the Lago Agrio Litigation as “five types of
poison: judicial fraud and corruption, gross violations of due process, executive
interference, judgments which are a mockery of legal reasoning, [and] factual findings

which are taken out of thin air.”*

The first and second of these complaints refer to the alleged ‘ghostwriting’ of the Lago
Agrio Judgment, together with judicial misconduct and procedural fraud. The third
refers to alleged interference with the Lago Agrio Litigation by the Respondent’s
executive branch. The fourth and fifth relate to the “absurd” reasons and “junk
science” in the Lago Agrio Judgment (as affirmed by the subsequent judgments of the
Lago Agrio Appellate Court, Cassation and Constitutional Courts). For reasons
already indicated in Part VII(C)(2) above, as regards their merits, the Tribunal does

not consider these fourth and fifth complaints in this Award any further.

As to the Claimants’ specific allegations in regard to these first three matters, the
Tribunal refers to the description and headings in its Conclusions set out at the end of
Part V above. Using these headings, this part of the Claimants’ case can be

summarised as follows, as decided by the Tribunal.

As to the ‘ghostwriting’ of the Lago Agrio Judgment, the Claimants contend that
Judge Zambrano agreed to receive a bribe of US$ 500,000 from the Lago Agrio

Judgment’s proceeds in return for allowing the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives

8.17

corruptly to ‘ghostwrite’ the Lago Agrio Judgment; that Judge Zambrano did not write

the Lago Agrio Judgment (as he otherwise testified in the RICO Litigation, falsely);

and that the ‘Cabrera fraud’ taints the Lago Agrio Judgment. These allegations, as to

the merits, are considered below.

As to their other allegations; the Claimants plead:

()

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

(v)

(vi)

the misconduct of Judge Yanez, as the presiding judge in the Lago Agrio
Litigation (from February 2006 to October 2007), in regard to his order
terminating the judicial inspections, his appointment of Mr Cabrera and private
meetings with the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives — as a distinct matter,
this alleged denial of justice has not been accepted by the Tribunal: see its

Conclusions at the end of Part V;

the misconduct of Mr Cabrera, as an auxiliary officer of the Lago Agrio Court
(from June 2007 to April 2008) — as a distinct matter, this alleged denial of
justice has not been accepted by the Tribunal: see its Conclusions at the end of

Part V;

Judge Zambrano’s improper connivance at Dr Guerra’s ‘ghostwriting’ of seven
of his court orders in the Lago Agrio Litigation (between October 2009 and
March 2010) — as a distinct matter, this alleged denial of justice has not been

accepted by the Tribunal: see its Conclusions at the end of Part V;

the Veiga-Pérez Criminal Prosecutions by the Respondent (intermittently, from
2003 to 2011) — as a distinct matter, this alleged denial of justice has not been

accepted by the Tribunal: see its Conclusions at the end of Part V;

the conduct of the Respondent’s Government towards the Lago Agrio
Litigation (from 2003 onwards) — as a distinct matter specifically in regard to
the Lago Agrio Judgment itself, this alleged denial of justice has not been
accepted by the Tribunal: see its Conclusions at the end of Part V. As a broader
matter in regard to the Lago Agrio Litigation more generally, the Tribunal

returns to this allegation below;

the unwillingness or inability of the Respondent’s prosecutorial authorities to

conduct and complete criminal investigations in any significant manner into

Part VIII — Page 4

8.18

8.19

8.20

the prima facie evidence of procedural fraud, judicial misconduct in the Lago
Agrio Litigation and of the ‘ghostwriting’ of the Lago Agrio Court’s Judgment,
available to them from Chevron’s allegations at the time of the Lago Agrio
Judgment’s enforceability on 1 March 2012: this allegation forms part of the
overall denial of justice alleged by the Claimants and, as regards the merits, it

is addressed further below; and

(vii) the Judgments of the Lago Agrio Appellate Court (2012), Cassation Court
(2013) and Constitutional Court (2018) in leaving materially unremedied the
Lago Agrio Judgment, notwithstanding the evidence of procedural fraud,
judicial misconduct and ‘ghostwriting’ available to them from Chevron’s
allegations at the time, namely (as regards the Appellate Court) by the date of
its order declaring the Lago Agrio Judgment’s enforceability on 1 March 2012
and (as regards the Cassation and Constitutional Courts) by the date of their
respective judgments on 12 November 2013 and 27 June 2018: these
allegations form part of the overall denial of justice alleged by the Claimants

and, as regards the merits, these are further addressed below.

It follows from this summary that the relevant allegations for the merits of the
Claimants’ claims for denial of justice comprise: (a) the ‘ghostwriting’ of the Lago
Agrio Judgment; (b) the conduct of the Respondent’s prosecutorial authorities; (c) the
judgments of the Lago Agrio Appellate and Cassation Courts in regard to alleged
judicial misconduct, procedural fraud and ‘ghostwriting’ and (d) the conduct of the

Respondent’s Government in regard to the Lago Agrio Litigation generally.

(2) The Respondent’s Case: In brief,> the Respondent denies that there has been any
denial of justice or any other violation of Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty; and it refutes

the Claimants’ claims, as to both the facts and the applicable law.

As to the facts, the Respondent submits that the Lago Agrio Judgment was not
“ghostwritten”; and that there is no cogent evidence to support the Claimants’
allegations otherwise (as to which the Claimants bear the legal burden of proof). In
particular, so the Respondent submits, Dr Guerra’s testimony in support of the

Claimants’ case is inconsistent, unreliable and worthless; the contemporary evidence

does not support any corrupt ‘ghostwriting’; the forensic expert evidence proves that
the Lago Agrio Judgment was not written by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’
representatives; the Claimants’ case on the “Unfiled Materials” rests upon
demonstrably false assumptions; Dr Zambrano’s testimony in the RICO Litigation
does not support the Claimants’ allegations; Mr Cabrera was properly appointed as a
court expert by the Lago Agrio Court; the Cabrera Report does not taint the Lago
Agrio Judgment; and the conduct of the Respondent’s Government towards the Lago

Agrio Plaintiffs was not improper.

As to international law as the applicable law, the Respondent contends that the
Claimants have failed to establish that Judge Zambrano’s alleged misconduct should
be attributed to the Respondent; that the Claimants’ case regarding the Lago Agrio
Litigation and Lago Agrio Judgment does not meet the requirements for a breach by
the Respondent of its obligations under Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty; that the decisions
in the Lago Agrio Judgment were made reasonably; that the Respondent’s
prosecutorial authorities have been and still are investigating, in confidence, aspects of
the Lago Agrio Litigation; and that there is nothing materially amiss in the Lago Agrio

Appellate, Cassation or Constitutional Court Judgments.
D: The Tribunal’s Analysis as to Denial of Justice

(1) Introduction: As to the relevant factual and expert evidence, as indicated above,
the Tribunal has already addressed at length and decided the Parties’ respective cases
in Parts IV, V and VI above. For the reasons there set out, the Tribunal has not
accepted the Respondent’s submissions on the evidence adduced in this arbitration. It
remains unnecessary here to re-state the Tribunal’s conclusions. Nonetheless, as
regards the merits, the Tribunal addresses below the Claimants’ four complaints listed

under sub-paragraphs 8.18(a) to (d) above.

(2) The Legal Test for Denial of Justice under the Treaty: The Tribunal begins with
the legal test for denial of justice under the FET standard and customary international

law in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty.

There is a consistent line of awards over many years, amounting to a jurisprudence
constante, deciding that a denial of justice in violation of customary international law

will also amount to a breach of an FET standard in a treaty: Azinian (1999), Mondev

Part VIII — Page 6

(2002), Waste Management (No 2) (2004), International Thunderbird (2006), Jan de
Nul (2008), Rumeli (2008), Pey Casado (2008), AMTO (2008), Al-Bahloul (2010),
Liman Caspian (2010), Frontier (2010), Roussalis (2011), Oostergetel (2012),
Swisslion (2012), and Flughafen Zurich (2014).° However, ordinarily, the protection
for denial of justice under an FET standard in a treaty (such standard providing the
international minimum standard for fair and equitable treatment of an alien) is neither
broader nor narrower than protection for denial of justice under customary
international law: Iberdrola (2012).7 Conversely, apart from denial of justice, an FET
standard in a treaty (even limited to fair and equitable treatment under international
customary law) provides a broader protection to a covered investor than does denial of

justice under customary international law: Vivendi (2007).°

8.25 Thus, as decided in Part VII above, the Tribunal considers that denial of justice under
the FET standard equates with denial of justice under customary international law,
both as provided in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty. These impose upon the Claimants
the same legal requirements to establish on the merits their case alleging a denial of
justice. (For ease of reference below, the Tribunal continues to address denial of
justice under the FET standard, although its analysis applies equally to denial of

justice under customary international law.)

In the Tribunal’s view, as to the merits, the legal test is whether any shock or surprise
to an impartial tribunal occasioned by the Lago Agrio Judgment, with the judgments
of the Lago Agrio Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts, leads, on reflection,
to justified concerns as to the judicial propriety of the Lago Agrio Judgment, as left

materially uncorrected or unremedied within the Respondent’s own legal system.

By the shorthand terms “uncorrected” and “unremedied”, here and elsewhere in this
Award, the Tribunal means that the Lago Agrio Judgment (excepting its award of
punitive damages) was considered by the Lago Agrio Appellate Court, Cassation and
Constitutional Courts, in full knowledge of the complaints of serious procedural
impropriety, without appropriate steps being taken to address the allegations of
procedural fraud, judicial misconduct and ‘ghostwriting’ raised by Chevron at the

time.

In Part V above, the Tribunal has found that the Lago Agrio Court, the Appellate
Court, the Cassation Court and the Constitutional Court did not investigate Chevron’s
allegations of procedural fraud and judicial misconduct; and the Appellate, Cassation
and Constitutional Courts also did not investigate the allegedly corrupt ‘ghostwriting’
of the Lago Agrio Judgment. This was not done in ignorance of Chevron’s specific
allegations at the time. In the Tribunal’s view, these Courts had sufficient information
available to them so as to amount (at least) to a strong prima facie case of judicial
misconduct, procedural fraud in the Lago Agrio Litigation and (as regards the
Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts) the ‘ghostwriting’ of the Lago Agrio

Judgment.

In Chevron’s Initial Alegato of 6 January 2011 addressed to the Lago Agrio Court,
(extending over 263 pages of written submissions), Chevron contended (inter alia) that
the Lago Agrio Litigation “should be terminated, with the entire Complaint dismissed,
because they have been permeated by fraud”; that “Chevron has been denied due
process and its constitutional rights”; and that “systematic constitutional violations and
substantial procedural defects render these proceedings a legal nullity.” The alleged
fraud included the judicial misconduct of Judge Yanez; the improper appointment of

Mr Cabrera; his corrupt collusion with the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives, the

Part VIII - Page 8

8.30

8.31

8.32

8.33

“fraudulent and flawed” Cabrera Report; and the violation of Chevron’s rights

including its status as a “Releasee” under the 1995 Settlement Agreement.?

In Chevron’s Appeal to the Lago Agrio Appellate Court of 9 March 2011 (extending
over 193 pages), Chevron contended (inter alia) that the Lago Agrio Judgment should
be declared a nullity “due to procedural fraud and violation of the guarantee of due
process”. These allegations, set out at length, included the judicial misconduct of
Judge Yanez; the corrupt collusion with Mr Cabrera; the fraudulent Cabrera Report;
the use of information in the Lago Agrio Judgment that was “not in the record as the
basis for the decision”; and the violation of Chevron’s rights under the 1995

Settlement Agreement. !°

In Chevron’s Cassation Appeal of 20 January 2012 (extending over 176 pages),
Chevron included amongst the grounds for its appeal: the judicial misconduct of Judge
‘Yanez; the “illegal appointment and actions” of Mr Cabrera; the “irregularities” in the
Cabrera Report; the violation of Chevron’s rights under the 1995 Settlement

Agreement; and the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ “illicit participation in the drafting of” the

Lago Agrio Judgment.!!

In Chevron’s action before the Constitutional Court, its submissions recorded in the
Court’s Judgment mirrored much of its case presented earlier at the RICO trial and in

this arbitration.

There is little in this Award (or the RICO Judgment) that would add to the substance
of the allegations made by Chevron to the Lago Agrio Appellate, Cassation and
Constitutional Courts in 2011, 2012 and 2018. In all material respects, at these times,
there was before these three Courts at least strong prima facie evidence of judicial
misconduct, procedural fraud and (particularly) ‘ghostwriting’, raising justifiable
concerns as to the judicial propriety of the Lago Agrio Litigation and the Lago Agrio
Judgment. The same situation prevailed as regards the Respondent’s prosecutorial

authorities, beginning at an earlier time.

Yet, as the Tribunal finds, no appropriate steps were taken by the Lago Agrio
Appellate Court, the Cassation Court, the Constitutional Court or these prosecutorial

authorities to address the allegations of procedural fraud, judicial misconduct and

 

‘ghostwriting’ raised by Chevron at the time, sufficient to suspend the enforceability
of the Lago Agrio Judgment and to comply with the Tribunal’s several Orders and

Awards on Interim Measures.

As to the doctrine of denial justice under international law, the Tribunal has been
guided generally by four awards cited by the Parties: Azinian v Mexico (1999),!?
Mondev v USA (2002),'* Loewen v USA (2003)'* and Oostergetel v Slovakia (2012).'5

In Oostergetel, it was decided that the standard for denial of justice (as part of the FET
standard) was “a demanding one. To meet the applicable test, it will not be enough to
claim that municipal law has been breached, that the decision of a national court is
erroneous, that a judicial procedure was incompetently conducted, or that the actions
of the judge in question were probably motivated by corruption. A denial of justice

implies the failure of a national system as a whole to satisfy minimum standards.”!®

The Tribunal has also borne in mind, as these legal materials confirm, that the doctrine
of denial of justice essentially addresses procedural unfairness and not (by itself) an
error of fact or applicable national law, although both may equally defeat the
complainant’s substantive rights. An international tribunal, such as this Tribunal,
cannot act as a court of appeal. As a former ICJ judge once wrote: “... if all that a
judge does is to make a mistake, i.e. to arrive at a wrong conclusion of law or fact, the
State is not responsible ... the only thing that can establish a denial of justice so far as

a judgment is concerned is an affirmative answer, duly supported by evidence, to some

such question as ‘Was the court guilty of bias, fraud, dishonesty, lack of impartiality,

or gross incompetence?” ... bona fide error does not entail responsibility.” !”

As to the threshold required for denial of justice, the Tribunal adopts the approach
taken by the NAFTA tribunal in Mondev v USA (2002), citing the judgment of the
International Court of Justice in ELSI (1989), that the impugned judgment must be

clearly improper and discreditable!* (with footnotes here omitted):'°

“127. In the ELSI case, a Chamber of the Court described as arbitrary conduct
that which displays ‘a wilful disregard of due process of law, ... which shocks, or
at least surprises, a sense of judicial propriety’. It is true that the question there
was whether certain administrative conduct was ‘arbitrary’, contrary to the
provisions of an FCN treaty. Nonetheless (and without otherwise commenting on
the soundness of the decision itself) the Tribunal regards the Chamber’s criterion
as useful also in the context of denial of justice, and it has been applied in that
context, as the Claimant pointed out. The Tribunal would stress that the word
‘surprises’ does not occur in isolation. The test is not whether a particular result
is surprising, but whether the shock or surprise occasioned to an impartial
tribunal leads, on reflection, to justified concerns as to the judicial propriety of
the outcome, bearing in mind on the one hand that international tribunals are not
courts of appeal, and on the other hand that Chapter 11 of NAFTA (like other
treaties for the protection of investments) is intended to provide a real measure of
protection. In the end the question is whether, at an international level and having
regard to generally accepted standards of the administration of justice, a tribunal
can conclude in the light of all the available facts that the impugned decision was
clearly improper and discreditable, with the result that the investment has been
subjected to unfair and inequitable treatment. This is admittedly a somewhat
open-ended standard, but it may be that in practice no more precise formula can
be offered to cover the range of possibilities.”

The approach in this passage has been followed subsequently by other international

tribunals, including GEA v Ukraine (2011), Arif (2013) and Mamidoil (2015).”°

The Tribunal emphasises that the legal test for denial of justice requires the claimant to
prove objectively that the impugned judgment was “clearly improper and

discreditable”, with the failure by the “national system as a whole to satisfy minimum

standards”. There have been many shocks and surprises caused by court judgments in
legal history, but without much more, amounting to discreditable improprieties and the

failure of the whole national system, such judgments do not amount to a denial of

justice.

A claimant’s legal burden of proof is therefore not lightly discharged, given that a
national legal system will benefit from the general evidential principle known by the
Latin maxim as omnia praesumuntur rite et solemniter esse acta donec probetur in
contrarium. It presumes (subject to rebuttal) that the court or courts have acted
properly. This general principle was described by Professor O’Connell as follows, as

cited to the NAFTA tribunal in Loewen (with footnotes there and here omitted):?!

“When one comes to examine failure of the courts themselves ‘palpable deviation’

from the accepted standards of judicial practice are not so readily ascertained.
For one thing, there is a presumption in favour of the judicial process. For
another, defects in procedure may be of significance only internally, and not work
an international injustice. For a third, wide discretion must be allowed a court in
the reception and rejection of evidence, in adjournment, and in admission of
documents, and it cannot be said that deviations even from the municipal law
rules of evidence are deviations from an international standard. The first thing
that must be ascertained is whether as a result of court manoeuvrings substantial
injustice has been done to the claimant; the second is whether these manoeuvrings
really amount to obstruction of the judicial process, and are extrinsic to the merits
of his claim. Bad faith and not judicial error seems to be the heart of the matter,
and bad faith may be indicated by an unreasonable departure from the rules of
evidence and procedure.”

 

This general principle subsumes a second principle, namely that a court is permitted a
margin of appreciation before the threshold of a denial of justice can be met.
Nonetheless, the balance of probabilities remains the standard of proof, with the

claimant bearing the overall legal burden of proof.

(3) Attribution under International Law: The Respondent contends that the conduct of
Judge Zambrano in regard to the ‘ghostwriting’ of the Lago Agrio Judgment cannot be

attributed to the Respondent because it was motivated by personal gain, with the

Claimants in a better position than the Respondent to prevent such judicial

misconduct.”

As the Tribunal has found in Parts IV and V above, the ‘ghostwriting’ resulted from
Judge Zambrano’s initiative and the bribe promised to him by certain of the Lago
Agrio representatives. It was not conduct directed by the Respondent; and Judge

Zambrano’s misconduct was not authorised under Ecuadorian law.

The Claimants submit that their claims for denial of justice address not the bribe
agreed between Judge Zambrano and certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs, but rather
the Lago Agrio Judgment as “the capstone of the judicial process: it bears the State’s
imprimatur of the proceedings that led to it.”*4 The Claimants cite from A.V.
Freeman’s work (1938, with references here omitted): “... fraud and corruption either
during the proceedings or in connection with the rendering of judgment may produce a
denial of justice ... and the responsibility of the State cannot be evaded by relying
upon any misapplied theory of the apparent powers of an agent ...”.?°

In the Tribunal’s view, the Lago Agrio Judgment was issued by Judge Zambrano in
his capacity as a judge of the Lago Agrio Court, itself part of the Respondent’s judicial
branch; the Lago Agrio Judgment was accorded the status of a court judgment under
Ecuadorian law; and it was (and remains) subject to enforcement and execution by the

Respondent’s judicial branch within the Respondent’s national legal system.

Article 4 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility states: “The conduct of any State
organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the
organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever
position it holds in the organisation of the State and whatever its character as an organ

of the central government or of a territorial unit of the State.”

Article 7 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility states: “The conduct of a State or
of a person or entity empowered to exercise elements of the governmental authority
shall be considered an act of the State under international law if the organ, person or

entity acts in that capacity, even if it exceeds its authority or contravenes instructions.”

8.51

The ILC Commentary to Article 7 emphasises the phrase “‘in that capacity”, so as to
distinguish the unauthorised conduct of persons acting in an official capacity from a
case “where the conduct is so removed from the scope of their official functions that it
should be assimilated to that of private individuals, not attributable to the State.”?° The

latter case is not the present case.

In State Responsibility: The General Part (2013), Professor Crawford addressed the
dividing-line as regards attribution and non-attribution under ILC Article 7, by
reference to two cases cited by the Parties in this arbitration, to different effect: Caire

(1929)?’ and Yeager (1987)8 (with footnotes here added):”°

The difference between the situation in Caire and the actions of the
Revolutionary Guards in Yeager on the one hand [where there was attribution],
and the Iran Air agent in Yeager on the other [where there was no attribution] is
that the latter, although he was able to extract a bribe by virtue of his position,
did not hold himself out as acting on behalf of the state. The soldiers in Caire
were able to arrest their victim through the exercise of state authority; the
Revolutionary Guards invoked their state power as customs officials. As was
made clear in another case of the Iran-US Claims Tribunal, Petrolane Inc. v.
Iran,* the Article 7 ‘extension’ of liability for acts done ultra vires is predicated
on the actions in question being done by ‘persons cloaked with governmental
authority’ ...”

In the present case, the conduct of Judge Zambrano in issuing the Lago Agrio
Judgment (as with all other judges of the Lago Agrio Court acting in the Lago Agrio
Litigation) was manifestly done ‘cloaked with governmental authority’, as members of
the Respondent’s judicial branch. Judge Zambrano was held out by the Respondent

and also held himself out as a judge acting in the name of the Respondent.

Moreover, the Lago Agrio Judgment was left unremedied by the Lago Agrio Appellate
Court and (subject to the issue of punitive damages) the Cassation and Constitutional
Courts, with sufficient knowledge of the Claimants’ allegations regarding gross

judicial improprieties in the Lago Agrio Litigation and the corrupt ‘ghostwriting’ of

the Lago Agrio Judgment. Their respective judgments are also to be attributed to the
Respondent under Article 4 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. It is not
possible, therefore, to treat the misconduct of Judge Zambrano (as also other judges of
the Lago Agrio Court) as private initiatives or personal frolics, unrelated to their
judicial functions or otherwise unattributable to the Respondent under international

law.

Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that there can be no question as regards the
attribution to the Respondent of an international wrong committed by the Lago Agrio
Court (with the Lago Agrio Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts), as the

judicial branch of the Respondent acting in such capacity in the Lago Agrio Litigation.

(4) The ‘Ghostwriting’ of the Lago Agrio Judgment: The facts established on the
factual, expert and forensic evidence speak for themselves, as set out at length in

Parts IV, V and VI above.

As there explained, the details as to how exactly all or material parts of the Lago Agrio
Judgment came to be written, corruptly by certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’
representatives for Judge Zambrano, remain incomplete. The missing factual and
forensic evidence is likely available only in Ecuador, if it still exists at all. Yet the
circumstantial and other evidence adduced in this arbitration is overwhelming. Short
of a signed confession by the miscreants, as rightly submitted by the Claimants at the
end of the Track II Hearing, the evidence establishing ‘ghostwriting’ in this arbitration
“must be the most thorough documentary, video, and testimonial proof of fraud ever

put before an arbitral tribunal.”?!

As found by the Tribunal in Parts IV and V above, two of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’
representatives who were privy to the ‘ghostwriting’ exercise were Mr Donziger and
Mr Fajardo. As the Respondent acknowledged at the Track II Hearing, the
participation of Mr Fajardo in ‘ghostwriting’ for Judge Zambrano, if correct (which
the Respondent denies), would suffice to support the Claimants’ claims for denial of
justice.*? The Tribunal agrees: the Claimants’ inability to identify by name with
sufficient probability others of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives, also

involved in ‘ghostwriting’ (in addition to Mr Donziger), cannot by itself exculpate the

8.57

Respondent from liability for denial of justice. If it were otherwise, the more
successful the ghostwriting exercise, the less culpability would result. In any event, for
denial of justice, the relevant actor is Judge Zambrano; and his participation in the
‘ghostwriting’ of the Lago Agrio Judgment is firmly established on the evidence

before this Tribunal.

On such evidence, the Tribunal has found that Judge Zambrano acted corruptly, in
return for a bribe promised to him by certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’
representatives. Judge Zambrano’s collusive conduct in the ‘ghostwriting’ of the Lago
Agrio Judgment was not authorised under Ecuadorian law.* Nor was it under judicial
standards long established under international law. He was far from acting as an
independent or impartial judge deciding the Lago Agrio Litigation fairly between the
parties, under minimum standards for judicial conduct long recognized under

international law.

Article 10 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the UN General
Assembly on 10 December 1948, provides: “Everyone is entitled in full equality to a
fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, in the determination
of his rights and obligations and any criminal charges against him”. Article 14 of the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, adopted by the UN General
Assembly on 16 December 1966 (in force from 23 March 1976), to which the
Respondent is a party, provides, in material part: “All persons shall be equal before the
courts and tribunals. In the determination of any criminal charge against him, or of his
rights and obligations in a suit at law, everyone shall be entitled to a fair and public
hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law.”
Article 2 of the UN Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary, adopted by
the UN General Assembly in November-December 1985, provides: “The judiciary
shall decide matters before them impartially, on the basis of facts and in accordance
with the law, without any restrictions, improper influences, inducements, pressures,
threats or interferences, direct or indirect, from any quarter or for any reason.” Article

6 of these Basic Principles provides: “The principle of the independence of the

judiciary entitles and requires the judiciary to ensure that judicial proceedings are

conducted fairly and that the rights of the parties are respected.”**

The Tribunal does not understand from the Parties’ respective submissions that these
international standards for judicial conduct are materially disputed between them.
Moreover, in addition to the Universal Declaration of 1948 and the International
Covenant of 1966, the Constitutional Court’s Judgment cites Article 8 of the American
Convention on Human Rights of 1969 on the right to a fair trial “by a competent,
independent and impartial tribunal.” *° As to Ecuadorian law, the Constitutional
Court’s Judgment also cites the constitutional rights under Articles 75 and 76(7)(k) of
the Respondent’s Constitution “to the effective, impartial and speedy protection of his
or her rights and interests” and “to be tried by an independent, impartial and

competent judge.”?°

The Tribunal considers that the Claimants’ case on ‘ghostwriting’ satisfies the legal
test for denial of justice under the FET standard in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty, as at 1
March 2012 when the Lago Agrio Judgment became enforceable as a result of the
Appellate Court’s judgment and order. The evidence pointing to the corrupt conduct of
Judge Zambrano in regard to the ‘ghostwriting” of the Lago Agrio Judgment in
collusion with certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives justifies the very
gravest concerns as to judicial propriety in regard to the Lago Agrio Judgment, with
the judgments of the Lago Agrio Appellate Court, Cassation and Constitutional Courts
leaving the Lago Agrio Judgment materially unremedied. Judge Zambrano’s conduct
was grossly improper by any moral, professional and legal standards; and it directly

impacted, adversely, the rights of Chevron (with TexPet).

Accordingly, in the Tribunal’s view, the Lago Agrio Judgment was, in the words of
the award in ELS/, “clearly improper and discreditable” with the result that the
Claimants’ investments have “been subjected to unfair and inequitable treatment”.
That judgment was left unremedied by the Respondent’s own legal system, including
the judgments of the Lago Agrio Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts and

the Respondent’s prosecutorial authorities. That conduct amounted to a failure of the

Respondent’s national system as a whole to satisfy minimum standards required under

international law.

(5) Other Allegations: The Tribunal does not base its decision, as secondarily alleged
by the Claimants, on the institutional corruption of the Ecuadorian legal system as a
whole, including the Lago Agrio Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts. In
view of the Tribunal’s decisions concerning the Lago Agrio Judgment, it is not an
allegation material to the Claimants’ primary case; and it is not here necessary for the

Tribunal to address this secondary case, beyond the factors listed below.

First, it was Texaco’s decision to support the stay of the Aguinda Litigation in New
York, thereby effectively remitting that litigation to the Ecuadorian legal system under
Texaco’s undertaking of 1999 to the US District Court for the Southern District of
New York in the Aguinda Litigation. According to the Respondent, following its
subsequent merger with Texaco, Chevron became a party to Texaco’s undertaking, as
ostensibly confirmed the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in its judgment
of 2011. It therefore lies with difficulty, so the Respondent contends, for Chevron and
TexPet now to complain, in good faith, about an alleged state of affairs generally in
the legal system of Ecuador, given that recourse to that system was the result of
Texaco’s and their own choosing. On the other hand, the Claimants deny the binding
effect upon either of them of Texaco’s undertaking, as also the legal effect of the
Second Circuit’s judgment under the laws of the USA; and the Claimants contend that
the Lago Agrio Court wrongly assumed personal and subject-matter jurisdiction over

Chevron.

The Tribunal prefers not to decide the issue whether or not Texaco’s undertaking is
binding upon Chevron. It is not necessary to do so for the purposes of this Award.
Even if the Claimants were correct (which the Tribunal assumes, but does not decide),
the Tribunal does not consider that the wrongful assertion of jurisdiction by the Lago
Agrio Court over the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ Complaint against Chevron can amount,
by itself, to any breach of Article VI(1)(a) or Article VI(1)(c) of the Treaty by the
Respondent (acting by its judicial branch). The Tribunal notes, in particular, the terms
of the Second Circuit’s judgment (whatever its legal effect under the laws of the

USA). Hence, the Tribunal discounts this first factor.

Part VIII — Page 18

8.64

8.65

8.66

8.67

8.68

8.69

Second, even the general state of the Ecuadorian legal system (as alleged by the
Claimants) is not uniformly applicable to all cases. As the Respondent rightly submits,
the eventual dismissal of criminal charges against Mr Veiga and Dr Pérez as TexPet’s
signatories to the 1995 Settlement Agreement, albeit late, is inconsistent with the
Ecuadorian judiciary dependent upon instructions from the Respondent’s executive

branch.

Third, even with knowledge of Chevron’s allegations, the New York Courts have
continued to stay related litigation in New York, effectively remitting that litigation to
the Ecuadorian courts: see the Huaorani Litigation summarised in Part ITV(G)(9)

above.

Fourth, there is evidence that Judge Zambrano was willing to be bribed by Chevron in
return for a favourable result in the Lago Agrio Litigation (Chevron declined this
offer). That initiative is also inconsistent with uniform judicial corruption in Ecuador

dependent upon instructions from the Respondent’s executive branch.

Last but not least, as already indicated, the evidential materials regarding the Lago
Agrio Court (including Judge Zambrano) are so overwhelming that the Claimants’
broader allegations of corruption against the Ecuadorian legal system can add nothing

to their proven primary case.

In Parts IV and V above, the Tribunal discounted, as a distinct matter in regard to the
Lago Agrio Judgment, the numerous public condemnatory statements regarding
Chevron made by President Correa and members of his administration. As regards the
Lago Agrio Litigation more generally, although particularly vicious in regard to Mr
Veiga and Dr Pérez, Chevron’s other legal representatives in Ecuador and (later) Dr
Guerra, these statements were also not the cause of any injury sustained by the

Claimants in the Lago Agrio Litigation or under the Lago Agrio Judgment.

Moreover, as the Respondent submitted, Governments sometimes resort to extreme
political language as regards alleged damage to the environment caused by foreign oil

companies.*” The Tribunal does not consider such political, even populist, statements

37 The Respondent cited the public condemnation in 2010 of “British Petroleum” by the President and Interior
Secretary of the USA in regard to the Deepwater Horizon catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico, which involved
fatalities and significant environmental pollution: see R-537 and R-621.

by a State’s executive branch, however regrettable, as amounting by themselves to a
denial of justice. This applies necessarily to a situation where the sole cause for the
denial of justice lies elsewhere within the State’s judicial branch — as it does in the

present case.

The Tribunal returns to the Claimants’ summary of their case on denial of justice, as

formulated at the end of the Track II Hearing, as follows:*®

“[There are] at least five separate and independent denials of justice: First, the
Cabrera fraud, which the private and Government conspirators never quite
managed to cleanse. Second, they paid [for ghostwritten orders] on behalf of the
Plaintiffs; third, the Plaintiffs’ ghostwriting of the Judgment using their own
unfiled materials; fourth, the absurd and discriminatory fraudulent judgment itself
imposing enormous liability by ignoring the environmental standards applic able
to PetroEcuador and other panies, and then turing envi

costs for remediation exponentially greater than those used anywhere else in the
world. Now, the fifth denial of justice is Ecuador’s response to the exposure of the
first four. This goes directly to the question of when international liability will
attach for misconduct that began in a country’s courts”.

The Tribunal has decided the first three allegations as related parts of Judge
Zambrano’s misconduct regarding the ‘ghostwriting’ of the Lago Agrio Judgment.
The Tribunal has decided the fifth allegation, to the effect that the Lago Agrio
Judgment was left materially unremedied by the Lago Agrio Appellate, Cassation and

(now) Constitutional Courts and the Respondent’s prosecutorial authorities.

As regards the merits of the fourth allegation, relating to the Claimants’ criticisms of
‘junk science’ or ‘absurd’ reasoning in the Lago Agrio Judgment, the Tribunal does
not consider it necessary to say more than it has already said in regard to this case’s
special features, namely the Respondent’s cross-claim, in Parts WII(C)(2) and

VII(C)(3) above.

Accordingly, for denial of justice on the merits, the Tribunal does not consider it
appropriate to base its decision on the Lago Agrio Judgment’s treatment of
environmental standards, including its assessment of causation and damages. As
indicated above, the Tribunal bears in mind that similar environmental issues may yet
be argued anew by the Aguinda or Lago Agrio Plaintiffs in resumed legal proceedings

against Chevron, TexPet or Texaco. Albeit not binding upon these Plaintiffs, a

decision by the Tribunal here as to this fourth allegation could prejudice the

determination of these issues.

It is also unnecessary for this Tribunal to address these issues in this arbitration as
regards the dispute between Claimants and the Respondent: the Lago Agrio Judgment

as a whole has been successfully impugned by the Claimants on other grounds.

The Tribunal’s reticence in regard to this fourth allegation, i.e. its necessary exercise
of arbitral economy in this arbitration, should not be misunderstood. If there were to
be individual claims for personal harm by the Aguinda or Lago Agrio Plaintiffs (not
being diffuse claims) in further legal proceedings, the Claimants may well be correct
that the full costs for remediating all environmental damage by whomsoever caused in

the former concession area would be less than US$ 100 million.*®

(6) The Tribunal’s Conclusion as to Denial of Justice: As recited above, the Tribunal
bases its decisions on the merits on the corrupt misconduct of the Lago Agrio Court in
regard to the Lago Agrio Judgment in the Lago Agrio Litigation, together with the
absence of any appropriate relief within the Respondent’s own legal system from the
Lago Agrio Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts and the conduct of the

Respondent’s prosecutorial authorities.

For these reasons, on the merits of the Claimants’ claims for denial of justice, the
Tribunal decides that the Respondent violated the FET standard and customary

international law in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty.
E: The Tribunal’s Final Conclusions

In summary, the Tribunal decides that the Respondent is liable to make reparations to
each of Chevron and TexPet for injuries caused by the breaches of the FET standard
and customary international law in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty and for breaches of
the Umbrella Clause in Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty, as further addressed in Parts IX
and X below.

8.82

If the Claimants’ assessment (above) of the full costs of remediating environmental
damage in the concession area were correct (as to which the Tribunal here expresses
no conclusion), it is deeply regrettable that individual claims for personal harm caused
by such damage were not amicably settled long ago, without the massive costs
expended on the multiple lawsuits and arbitrations (including this arbitration) and,
also, without the involvement of non-party funders and other third persons. The latter
groups ostensibly rank in priority far above the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs for any proceeds
from the Lago Agrio Litigation, as to which, again in the words of the Respondent’s
Counsel, the “real plaintiffs” with “real claims” are likely to receive nothing after 25

years of continuous litigation.

The Tribunal here bears in mind the remarks made by Mr Pate, Chevron’s General
Counsel, at the beginning of the Hearing on Interim Measures held on 11 February

2012, more than six years ago:*?

“\.. I will close by repeating what I said the last time I spoke before this
Tribunal.*! Chevron takes no pleasure in a dispute with any sovereign nation. We
pride ourselves in working as good partners with nations who take a very broad
spectrum of policy views. Chevron would welcome a constructive dialogue with
Ecuador about this case and respects Ecuador’s people and officials. So long as
Ecuador continues to work in league with Mr Donziger, however, the result will
be only further harm to the people, the civil society, and the reputation of
Ecuador. Chevron invites Ecuador to change that course.”

However, then as now, the amount of compensation resulting from any such
“constructive dialogue”, together with PetroEcuador’s share with Chevron and TexPet
for any liability regarding personal harm and environmental remediation in the

concession area, lies beyond the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.

PART IX

THE PARTIES’ CLAIMS FOR RELIEF

A: Introduction

The Tribunal here addresses the Claimants’ and the Respondent’s material requests for
relief in Track II as set out in Part I above, in the light of the decisions taken in this
Award, together with the Tribunal’s earlier awards, decisions and orders. These requests
are taken, respectively, from the Claimant’s letter dated 19 March 2018 (Section B with
its marked-up Enclosure 1) and the Respondent’s letter dated 20 April 2018 (pp. 5-8,

with its marked-up Enclosure 1).

The Tribunal has fully considered the Parties’ respective written and oral submissions
regarding their respective requests for relief. Given the several decisions made by the
Tribunal in this Award, it is unnecessary to set out these submissions for the purpose of

this Award, beyond the Parties’ specific requests for relief. !
B: The Tribunal’s General Approach

As set out in Part VIII above, on the evidence adduced in these proceedings, the Tribunal
has found the Respondent in breach of its obligations towards Chevron and TexPet, for
denial of justice under the FET standard and customary international law in Article

II(3)(a) of the Treaty and under the Umbrella Clause in Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty.

As explained in Parts VII and VIII above, the Tribunal considers that denial of justice
under the Treaty’s FET standard equates to denial of justice under customary
international law, both falling within the scope of Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty. It
follows that the Tribunal’s finding regarding denial of justice under the FET standard
equates with finding the Respondent also in breach of its obligations under customary

international law for denial of justice.

Conversely, the Tribunal has not found the Respondent in breach of its obligations under

the Treaty from the facts only that: (i) the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs commenced legal

  

oral submissions on relief at the Track II Hearing, the Tribunal refers in particular to the

ns at D12.2708ff and to the Respondent’s closing submissions at D13.301 Iff.

proceedings against Chevron before the Lago Agrio Court on 7 May 1993; (ii) the Lago
Agrio Plaintiffs pleaded individual claims for personal harm against Chevron in their
original Complaint filed in the Lago Agrio Litigation (not being diffuse claims);? (iii)
the Lago Agrio Court assumed jurisdiction over the Complaint (as regards non-diffuse
claims), by reason of the undertaking in favour of Ecuadorian jurisdiction in the
Aguinda Litigation; and (iv) certain of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ legal representatives
in the Lago Agrio Litigation engaged in corrupt and other nefarious practices during the

Lago Agrio Litigation (not attributable to the Respondent under international law).

In regard to the Claimants’ material requests for relief regarding the Respondent’s
internationally wrongful acts, the Tribunal’s starting-point comprises the ILC’s Articles
on State Responsibility,? the judgments of the Permanent Court of International Justice
in Chorzéw Factory (1927 & 1928)* and the judgment of the International Court of
Justice in Avena I (2004).>

In Avena I (Mexico v USA), applying the general principles enunciated in Chorzéw

Factory, the Court decided upon the form of reparation (inter alia) as follows:°

“119. The general principle on the legal consequences of the commission of an
internationally wrongful act was stated by the Permanent Court of International
Justice in the Factory at Chorz6w case as follows: ‘It is a principle of international
law that the breach of an engagement involves an obligation to make reparation in
an adequate form.’ (Factory at Chorzéw, Jurisdiction, 1927, P.C.I.J., Series A, No.
9, p. 21.) What constitutes ‘reparation in an adequate form’ clearly varies
depending upon the concrete circumstances surrounding each case and the precise
nature and scope of the injury, since the question has to be examined from the
viewpoint of what is the ‘reparation in an adequate form’ that corresponds to the
injury. In a subsequent phase of the same case, the Permanent Court went on to
elaborate on this point as follows: ‘The essential principle contained in the actual
notion of an illegal act — a principle which seems to be established by international
practice and in particular by the decisions of arbitral tribunals — is that reparation
must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and
reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had

not been committed.’ (Factory at Chorzéw, Merits, 1928, PCIJ., Series A, No. 17,.
p. 47).”

In that case, the Court identified the respondent State’s internationally wrongful acts as
the “process” of the domestic court proceedings (under the Vienna Convention on
Consular Relations), as distinct from “the correctness as such of any conviction or

sentencing”. Accordingly, the Court concluded that: 7

“[121] ... the internationally wrongful acts committed by the United States [sic;
the United States of America] were the failure of its competent authorities to inform
the Mexican nationals concerned, to notify Mexican consular posts and to enable
Mexico to provide consular assistance. It follows that the remedy to make good
these violations should consist in an obligation on the United States to permit
review and reconsideration of these nationals’ cases by the United States’ courts,
as the Court will explain further in paragraphs 128 to 134 below, with a view to
ascertaining whether in each case the violation of Article 36 committed by the
competent authorities caused actual prejudice to the defendant in the process of
administration of criminal justice.

[122] The Court reaffirms that the case before it concerns Article 36 of the Vienna
Convention [i.e. the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations] and not the
correctness as such of any conviction or sentencing. The question of whether the
violations of Article 36, paragraph I, are to be regarded as having, in the causal
sequence of events, ultimately led to convictions and severe penalties is an integral
part of criminal proceedings before the courts of the United States and is for them
to determine in the process of review and reconsideration. In so doing, it is for the
courts of the United States to examine the facts, and in particular the prejudice and
its causes, taking account of the violation of the rights set forth in the Convention.”

As regards the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, the Tribunal refers, in particular, to
Articles 16 and 28 to 38.° An internationally wrongful act (which includes the violation
of a treaty or of customary international law) entails the consequences set out in Part
Two of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. These consequences include Article
28 (“Legal consequences of an internationally wrongful act’’), Article 29 (“Continued
duty of performance”), Article 30 (“Cessation and non-repetition”), Article 31
(“Reparation”), Article 32 (“Irrelevance of Internal law’), Article 33 (“Scope of

international obligations”) and Articles 34 to 38 on forms of reparation.

291.

9.13

In regard to the enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment before the courts of a third
State (i.e. not Ecuador or the USA), the Claimants referred to Article 16 of Part One of
the ILC Articles on State Responsibility (“Aid or assistance in the commission of an
internationally wrongful act”). This Article provides that a State which aids or assists
another State in the commission of an internationally wrongful act entails the
consequences set out in Part Two of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility if: (i) that
State does so with knowledge of the circumstances of the internationally wrongful act
and (ii) the act would be internationally wrongful if committed by that State. For this
purpose, a denial of justice under customary international law would be such
internationally wrongful act. As the International Court of Justice decided in the Bosnia
Genocide Case (2007),'° Article 16 of the ILC Articles reflects a rule of customary

international law.

The Tribunal adopts the general approach suggested by the ICJ in Avena [, to the effect
that reparation for an internationally wrongful act varies, depending upon the concrete
circumstances surrounding each case and the precise nature and scope of the injury

under international law.

The Tribunal also follows the distinction drawn by the ICJ in Avena I between the
“process” of the Lago Agrio Litigation leading to the enforceability of the Lago Agrio
Judgment and the “correctness” of the Lago Agrio Judgment, as decided by the Lago

Agrio Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts.

A similar distinction was drawn by the ICJ in the Case Concerning the Arrest Warrant
(2002).'' In that case, the unlawful arrest warrant engaged the respondent State’s
international responsibility; but the warrant continued to exist, both as a matter of the
local law and also international law. The Court held: “The warrant is still extant and
remains unlawful ... The Court accordingly considers that Belgium must by means of
its own choosing cancel the warrant in question ...”. Significantly, the Court did not

itself cancel the warrant. In the Case Concerning Jurisdictional Immunities (2012),'*

the ICJ ordered the respondent State to take steps, by means of its own choosing, to
ensure that decisions of its own courts “become unenforceable”. Again, significantly,

the ICJ did not itself annul or declare the nullity of these judicial decisions.

Accordingly, applying international law, the Tribunal does not consider that it has the
power to annul the Lago Agrio Judgment as regards its lack of “correctness”. Albeit
unlawful under international law as to “process” (as decided by the Tribunal), the Lago
Agrio Judgment exists as a concrete fact under Ecuadorian law, hence the Claimants’
successive appeals to the Respondent’s courts. Given such existence, the Lago Agrio
Judgment has a legal effect and resulting consequences under international law.
However, the remedy of annulment, as such, lies with the Respondent’s internal law.
This Tribunal has no power to apply such an internal remedy, as an international
tribunal. It does, however, have the power to order the Respondent to take steps to secure

that result.

As to international law, the Tribunal has decided that the Respondent breached its
obligations, by a denial of justice, in issuing the Lago Agrio Judgment, rendering it

enforceable and maintaining its enforceability by the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs.

In Part VIII above, as to the right of a party to receive a fair hearing before an impartial
tribunal, the Tribunal has already referred to Article 10 of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights, Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
and Articles 2 and 6 of the UN Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary.
The violation of such a right by judicial corruption is proscribed by the UN Convention
against Corruption ratified by the General Assembly on 31 October 2003 (to which the
Respondent is a Contracting Party). In World Duty Free (2006), in the context of
corruption by bribery, the tribunal identified, as a matter of international public policy,
an international consensus as to universal standards and accepted norms of conduct that
must be applied in all fora. It concluded: “In light of domestic laws and international
conventions relating to corruption, and in light of the decisions taken in this matter by
courts and arbitral tribunals, this Tribunal is convinced that bribery is contrary to the
international public policy of most, if not all, States ...”. 3 In the Tribunal’s view,

judicial bribery must rank as one of the more serious cases of corruption, striking

directly at the rule of law, access to justice and public confidence in the legal system;
and also, as regards the foreign enforcement of a corrupt judgment, at the law of nations.
Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the Lago Agrio Judgment (with the judgments
of the Lago Agrio Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts) violates international
public policy. As a matter of international comity, it must follow that the Lago Agrio

Judgment should not be recognised or enforced by the courts of other States.

In the Tribunal’s view, the reinstatement of the Claimants’ rights under international
law requires of the Respondent the immediate suspension of the enforceability of the
Lago Agrio Judgment and the implementation of such other corrective measures as are
necessary to “wipe out all the consequences” of the Respondent’s internationally
wrongful acts, so as to re-establish the situation which would have existed if those

internationally wrongful acts had not been committed by the Respondent.

The Tribunal considers that these measures, subject to their elaboration in the form of
declarations and orders below, are appropriate in the present circumstances of this case.
These circumstances do not require the Tribunal itself to declare the nullity of the Lago

Agrio Judgment under international law.

For the time being, contrary to the Claimants’ submissions,'* the Tribunal is willing to
assume that the Respondent will comply in good faith with this Award, in compliance
with the Parties’ Arbitration Agreement (as defined in Part I of this Award), the Treaty

and the lex loci arbitri.
C: The Claimants’ Requests for Relief

For this Track II, in the light of its general approach and decisions in this Award, the
Tribunal addresses below the material relief sought by the Claimants in the form of the
specific declarations and orders highlighted in green and purple in its marked-up
Appendix A to their 19 March 2018 letter, recited in Annex 3(1) to Part I above: '>

The Respondent, whether acting through its judicial branch or otherwise, was and
remains bound to ensure, by means of its own choosing, that the Claimants have no
liability or responsibility as regards diffuse claims under the 1995 Settlement
Agreement. To such extent, this request is granted in principle as set out in this Award’s
Operative Part X.

A3.3 Declaration 7: “Declare that the claims pleaded in the Lago Agrio Litigation (and

upon which the Lago Agrio Judgment were based) are barred by res judicata and
collateral estoppel”.

The Respondent was and remains bound to ensure, by means of its own choosing, that
in accordance with the 1995 Settlement Agreement the Claimants are not exposed to
liability or responsibility for diffuse claims in the courts of Ecuador. To such extent, this
request is granted in principle as set out in this Award’s Operative Part X.

A3.4: Declaration 1: “Declaring that under the 1995, 1996 and 1998 Settlement and
Release Agreements [the 1995 Settlement Agreement], Claimants have no liability or
responsibility for environmental impact, including but not limited to any alleged liability
for impact to human health, the ecosystem, indigenous cultures, the infrastructure, or
any liability for unlawful profits, punitive damages or penalties, or for performing any
further environmental remediation arising out of the former Consortium that was jointly

owned by TexPet and Ecuador, or under the expired Concession Contract between
TexPet and Ecuador”.

This request is not granted save in regard to diffuse claims under the 1995 Settlement
Agreement, as explained in Paragraphs 9.22 and 9.24 above and set out in this Award’s
Operative Part X.

A3.4: Declaration 2: “Declaring that Ecuador has breached the 1995, 1996, and 1998
Settlement and Release Agreements”.

The Respondent failed to observe its obligations under the 1995 Settlement Agreement,
in breach of the Umbrella Clause in Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty. To such extent, this
request is granted in principle as set out in this Award’s Operative Part X.

A3.4: Declaration 3: “Ordering Ecuador to specifically perform the Settlement and
Release Agreements.”

The Respondent is required to observe its obligations under the 1995 Settlement
Agreement, in accordance with the Umbrella Clause in Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty. To
such extent, this request is granted in principle as set out in this Award’s Operative Part
X.

A3.4: Declaration 4: “Declaring that Ecuador has breached the U.S.-Ecuador Treaty,
including its obligations to afford fair and equitable treatment, full protection and

security, an effective means of enforcing rights, non-arbitrary treatment, non-
discriminatory treatment, national treatment, and to observe obligations it entered into
with regard to investments”.

This request is granted in principle as regards: (i) denial of justice under the FET
standard and customary international law in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty; and (ii) the
non-observation of the 1995 Settlement Agreement under the Umbrella Clause in
Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty, as set out in this Award’s Operative Part X.

A3.4: Declaration 6: “Declaring that under the Treaty and applicable international law,
Chevron is not liable for the Judgment”.

Under Articles II(3)(a), Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty and customary international law,
the Respondent (by its judicial branch) was obliged not to hold Chevron (or TexPet)
liable under the Lago Agrio Judgment; and consequently the Claimants are, as a matter
of international law, not obliged to comply with the Lago Agrio Judgment. To such

extent, this request is granted in principle as set out in this Award’s Operative Part X.
A3.4: Declaration 7: “Declaring that Ecuador is exclusively liable for the Judgment.”

This request is granted as set out in this Award’s Operative Part X, to the effect that any
injury to the First or Second Claimant caused by the recognition or enforcement of any
part of the Lago Agrio Judgment within or without Ecuador (as also decided by the Lago
Agrio Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts) shall be injuries for which the

Respondent is liable to make full reparation under international law.
A3.4: Declaration 8: “Nullifying the existence, validity, and all effects of the Judgment”.

This request for nullification is not granted. Under its general approach above in
Paragraphs 9.3 to 9.19, the Tribunal has decided that that a declaration of the nullity of
the Lago Agrio Judgment is not an appropriate remedy under international law.

A3.4: Declaration 9: “Ordering Ecuador to use all measures necessary to enjoin

enforcement of the Judgment, including enjoining the nominal Plaintiffs or any Trust
from obtaining any related attachments, levies or other enforcement devices”.

In accordance with the Tribunal’s decisions in Paragraphs 9.22 and 9.24 above, the
Respondent is obliged to use measures of its own choosing to prevent the enforcement
of the Lago Agrio Judgment. Save to such extent, this request is not granted except as
set out in this Award’s Operative Part X.

A3.4: Declaration 10: “Ordering that, in the event that any court orders the recognition
or enforcement of the Judgment, Ecuador must satisfy the Judgment directly”.

A3.4: Declaration 11*: “Awarding Claimants indemnification against Ecuador in
connection with the Judgment, including a specific obligation by Ecuador to pay
Claimants the sum of money awarded in the Judgment”.

This request is not granted in this Award, any such indemnity or payment being issues
allocated to Track III as set out in this Award’s Operative Part X.
A3.4: Declaration 12*: “Awarding Claimants any sums that the nominal Lago Agrio

Plaintiffs collect against Claimants or their affiliates in connection with enforcing the
Judgment, including the amounts embargoed thus far”.

This request is not granted in this Award, any such sums being issues allocated to Track
III as set out in this Award’s Operative Part X.

A3.4: Declaration 14: “Ordering Ecuador to make a written representation to any court
in which the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs or any Trust attempt to recognize and enforce the
Judgment that: ... (ii) the Lago Agrio Court had no personal or subject-matter

jurisdiction over Chevron; ... (v) any enforcement of the Judgment places Ecuador in
violation of its international law obligations”.

This request is not granted as regards sub-paragraph (ii): see Part VIII above (Paragraph
8.63). As regards sub-paragraph (v), it is granted in principle, as set out above in
Paragraphs 9.22, 9.24 and 9.40 and in this Award’s Operative Part X.

A3.4: Declaration 17: “Any other and further relief that the Tribunal deems just and
proper.”

This general request has been addressed by the Tribunal in its several decisions above,
subject to any further relief to be addressed in Track III. The Tribunal does not think it
necessary to address here this general request any further.

A3.5B: Order: “Claimants also request that the Tribunal provide for a subsequent phase
in this arbitration to determine all costs and attorneys’ fees that should be awarded to
Claimants for being forced to (i) pursue this arbitration; (ii) uncover the Judgment

fraud; and (iii) defend against enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment in any
jurisdiction”.

This request is granted in principle, as set out in this Award’s Operative Part X.
A3.8A: Declaration 1: “By issuing the Judgment and rendering it enforceable within

and without Ecuador, Ecuador committed a denial of justice under international law
and breached provisions of the Treaty.”

This request is granted in principle, as set out this Award’s Operative Part X.

A3.8A: Declaration 3: “The court [1] rendering the Judgment asserted jurisdiction
illegitimately and was not competent in the international sphere [2] to try the Lago
Agrio case and [3] to pass judgment.”

This request (as directed at the Lago Agrio Court in the Lago Agrio Litigation) is not

granted as regards [1] and [2]: see Part VIII above (Paragraph 8.63).

As regards [3], this request (as directed at the terms of the Lago Agrio Judgment) is
granted in principle insofar as the Judgment is inconsistent with the Respondent’s
obligations under Articles II(3)(a) and II(3)(c) of the Treaty, as decided above in
Paragraphs 9.22, 9.24, 9.40 and 9.48 and as set out in this Award’s Operative Part X.

A3.8A: Declaration 4: “The Judgment was issued in a process that violated general

standards of due process and in which Chevron did not have an opportunity to present
its defense.”

This request is granted in principle, as set out in this Award’s Operative Part X.
A3.8A: Declaration 5: “The Judgment is a nullity as a matter of international law”.

This request is not granted. As decided above in Paragraph 9.38, under its general
approach described in Paragraphs 9.3 to 9.19, the Tribunal has decided that a declaration
of the nullity of the Lago Agrio Judgment is not an appropriate remedy under
international law.

A3.8A: Declaration 6: “The Judgment is [1] unlawful and [2] consequently devoid of
any legal effect {under international law}"®.”

As to unlawfulness under the Treaty (including customary international law), the first
part of this request is granted in principle, as set out in this Award’s Operative Part X.
The second part is not granted. As decided above in Paragraphs 9.38 and 9.61, under its
general approach described in Paragraphs 9.3 to 9.19, the Tribunal does not consider
that such a declaration for the Lago Agrio Judgment is an appropriate remedy under
international law.

A3.8A: Declaration 10*: “By taking measures to enforce the Judgment against assets
within Ecuador, and taking measures to facilitate enforcement of the Judgment in other
jurisdictions, Ecuador [1] is in breach of its obligations under the Treaty, and [2] must

indemnify Claimants and any of their affiliates for any sum of money collected from
them as a result of the Judgment”.

‘© The words “under international law” in this Declaration 6 were added by the Claimants at the Track II Hearing:
see D12.2514.

As the first part, this request is granted in principle as set out in this Award’s Operative
Part X, given the order dated 1 March 2012 of the Lago Agrio Appellate Court declaring
the enforceability of the Lago Agrio Judgment and the Respondent’s judicial branch
maintaining such enforceability (see Part IV above). As to the second part, this request
is not granted in this Award, any such indemnity being allocated to Track III, as set out
in this Award’s Operative Part X.

A3.8B: Order 5: “To abstain from collecting or accepting any proceeds arising from or

in connection with the enforcement or execution of the Judgment, and to return to
Claimants any such proceeds that may come into Respondent's possession”.

This request is granted in principle, as set out in this Award’s Operative Part X.
A3.9A: Declaration 1: “The Lago Agrio Litigation is exclusively a diffuse-rights case”.

This request is not granted: the Tribunal refers to its Decision (by a majority) dated 12
March 2015 in Track IB.

A3.9A: Declaration 2: “The 1999 EMA has no legal effect on the Settlement and Release
Agreements [the 1995 Settlement Agreement] ”.

This request is not granted, in the general form requested. In its Decision on Track 1B,
the Tribunal decided (by a majority) that the Lago Agrio Complaint of 7 May 2003, as
an initial pleading, included individual claims resting upon personal rights under
Ecuadorian law, not being diffuse claims falling within the scope of the release under
the 1995 Settlement Agreement. The Tribunal also decided that Article 43 of the 1999
Environmental Management Act (the “EMA”) could not by itself convert what was
otherwise a personal claim by an individual into a diffuse claim. Conversely, the Lago
Agrio Plaintiffs could not succeed in bringing a diffuse claim before the Ecuadorian
Courts, not being an individual claim for personal harm, without the Respondent
breaching the 1995 Settlement Agreement: see Paragraphs 168 and 186(1) of the
Decision on Track IB. In these circumstances, the Tribunal thinks it unnecessary to
answer the request any further in this Award.

A3.9A: Declaration 3: “The Lago Agrio Litigation was barred at its inception by res
judicata.”

This request is not granted. As already indicated, by its Decision on Track IB, the
Tribunal decided (by a majority) that the Lago Agrio Complaint of 7 May 2003, as an
initial pleading, included individual claims resting upon personal rights under

Ecuadorian law, not falling within the scope of the 1995 Settlement Agreement, and that

the Lago Agrio Complaint was not wholly barred at its inception by res judicata, under
Ecuadorian law, by virtue of the 1995 Settlement Agreement: see paragraphs 186(1) and
186(2) of the Decision on Track 1B.

A3.9A: Declaration 4: “By issuing the Lago Agrio Judgment and rendering it

enforceable within and without Ecuador, Ecuador violated various provisions of the
Treaty.”

This request, albeit in different forms of wording, has already been addressed above in
Paragraphs 9.28, 9.32, 9.54, 9.57, 9.63 and 9.65. The Tribunal has decided that the
Respondent (by its judicial branch) failed to comply with its obligations under the FET
standard and customary international law in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty and under the
Umbrella Clause in Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty, by the issuance and enforceability of
the Lago Agrio Judgment resulting from the conduct of the Lago Agrio Court, the Lago
Agrio Appellate Court, the Cassation Court and the Constitutional Court. The Tribunal
does not therefore consider it necessary to grant this further relief, as a matter of
surplusage; and it is not granted.

A3.9A: Declaration 5: “By issuing the Lago Agrio Judgment on diffuse claims barred

as res judicata, Ecuador breached the 1995, 1996 and 1998 Settlement and Release
Agreements, and also violated Chevron’s rights under the Treaty.”

This Tribunal repeats its decision above in Paragraph 9.75; and this request is therefore
not granted.

A3.9A: Declaration 6: “The Lago Agrio Judgment is a nullity as a matter of
international law.”

This request is not granted. (It repeats the requests addressed above under Paragraphs
9.38, 9.61 and 9.63; and the Tribunal provides the same reason for its decision).
A3.9A: Declaration 7: “The Lago Agrio Judgment is [1] unlawful and [2] consequently
devoid of any legal effect.”

As to the first part, this request is granted in principle, as already decided above in
Paragraph 9.63 and as set out in this Award’s Operative Part X. As to the second part,
the Tribunal repeats its decision above in Paragraph 9.38; this request repeats the similar
request addressed above under Paragraphs 9.61 and 9.63; the Tribunal does not therefore
consider it necessary to grant this further relief, as a matter of surplusage; and it is not
granted.

A3.9A: Declaration 8: “The Lago Agrio Judgment is a violation of Chevron’s rights
under the Treaty, and is not entitled to enforcement within or without Ecuador.”

consider it necessary to consider this request separately.

A3.9A: Declaration 9: “The Lago Agrio Judgment violates international public policy

and natural justice, and that as a matter of international comity and public policy, the
Lago Agrio Judgment should not be recognized and enforced”.

This request is granted in principle, as set out in this Award’s Operative Part X.

A3.9A: Declaration 10*: “By: (i) taking measures to enforce the Judgment against
assets within Ecuador, and (ii) taking measures to facilitate enforcement of the
Judgment in other jurisdictions, Ecuador is in breach of its obligations under the Treaty,

and must compensate Claimants for any sum of money collected by the Lago Agrio
Plaintiffs and/or their agents as a result of the Judgment”.

This request repeats the similar request addressed above under Paragraph 9.65. It is
therefore unnecessary to address it here separately, save that all issues relating to
compensation are allocated to Track III, as also set out in this Award’s Operative Part X.
A3.9B: Order 1: “To take all measures necessary to set aside or nullify the Lago Agrio
Judgment under Ecuadorian law.”

This request, albeit in different forms of wording, has already been addressed above in
Paragraphs 9.38, 9.61, 9.63 and 9.81. It is therefore unnecessary to address it here
separately.

A3.9B: Order 2: “To take all measures necessary to prevent enforcement and
recognition within and without Ecuador of the Lago Agrio Judgment”.

This request, albeit in different form of wording, has already been addressed above in
Paragraphs 9.40, 9.63 and 9.83. It is therefore unnecessary to address it here separately.
A3.9B: Order 3: “To take all measures necessary to prevent the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs

or any Trust from obtaining any related attachments, levies, or other enforcement
devices under the impugned Judgment.”

This request, albeit in different form of wording, has already been addressed above in

Paragraph 9.40. It is therefore unnecessary to address it here separately.

A3.9B: Order 4: “To make a written representation to any court in which the Lago
Agrio Plaintiffs or any Trust attempt to recognize and enforce the Lago Agrio Judgment
that: (i) the claims that formed the basis of the Lago Agrio Judgment were validly
released under Ecuadorian law by the Government; (ii) the Lago Agrio Judgment is a
legal nullity; and (iii) any enforcement of the Lago Agrio Judgment will place Ecuador
in violation of its obligations under the Treaty”.

This request is not granted, save as otherwise ordered in this Award’s Operative Part X
(see also the decisions regarding the similar request in Paragraph 9.48 above).
Paragraph 47: “Claimants’ requested relief is without prejudice to all other remedies

sought in relation to Track II or any other remedy that may effectively protect
Claimants’ rights, including a damage remedy as part of Track III.”

To the extent necessary and appropriate, the Tribunal defers to Track III this general

request as to any undecided issues outstanding from Track I, IB and II.
D: The Respondent’s Requests for Relief

In the circumstances, it is possible to decide the Respondent’s requests for relief more
succinctly. As with the Claimants’ requests for relief, it is appropriate to set out the

Respondent’s material requests in the form submitted to the Tribunal.

In its letter dated 20 April 2018, the Respondent limited its pleaded requests for relief
for Track II to “those prayers referring to findings of jurisdiction and State
responsibility”, with “prayers that refer to remedy” assigned to Track III, along with (i)
the ‘show cause’ issues related to the Tribunal’s Fourth Interim Award; (ii) the
Respondent’s application of 1 March 2013 for “Reconsideration of the First, Second
and Fourth Interim Awards” and (iii) any quantum issues (page 8 of its letter).
Moreover, the Respondent has confirmed its agreement that all issues of costs be

assigned to Track III (see below).

For this Track II, in the light of its general approach and decisions in this Award, the
Tribunal addresses below the material relief sought by the Respondent in the form of
the specific declarations and orders as marked-up in its Attachment 1, recited in Annex
3(2) to Part I above: !7

A3.12(b): “Dismisses on the merits Chevron’s claims under the 1995 Settlement

Agreement and the 1998 Final Release [i.e., collectively, “the 1995 Settlement
Agreement” ].”

This request is not granted, as regards the Claimants’ claims under the Umbrella Clause
in Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty.

A3.12(c): “Dismisses on the merits TexPet’s claims under the 1995 Settlement
Agreement and the 1998 Final Release.”

7 As designated by the Respondent, “red” signifies relief requested in Track II and “blue” relief requested in Track
III. See Annex 3 to Part I above.

Settlement Agreement or the 1998 Final Release”.

This request is not granted, as regards the Claimants’ claims under the Umbrella Clause
in Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty.

A3.12(e): “Dismisses all of Claimants’ claims as they relate to the 1996 Local
Settlements, reached between TexPet and local government entities”.

This request is not granted, subject to this Award’s Operative Part X.

A3.12(f): “Declares that the Lago Agrio Litigation was not barred by res judicata or
collateral estoppel.”

In its Decision dated 12 March 2015 in Track IB, the Tribunal decided (by a majority)
that the Lago Agrio Complaint of 7 May 2003 of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs was not
wholly barred at its inception by res judicata, under Ecuadorian law, by virtue of the
1995 Settlement Agreement. Save as aforesaid, this request is not granted.

A3.16(a): “Declaring that it [the Tribunal] lacks jurisdiction over Claimants’ denial of
justice and related treaty claims against the Republic.”

This request is not granted.

A3.16(b): “Alternatively, assuming the Tribunal finds it has jurisdiction over the denial
of justice and Treaty claims, dismissing Claimants’ denial of justice and related treaty

claims against the Republic as not ripe for adjudication under international law in light
of Claimants’ failure to exhaust available local remedies, and as otherwise meritless.”

This request is not granted.

A3.16(c): “Declaring that Claimants do not possess the rights they claim to have under
the 1995 Settlement Agreement, the 1998 Final Release, and/or the 1996 Local
Settlements in connection with the Lago Agrio Litigation.”

This request is not granted, subject to this Award’s Operative Part X.
A3.16(d): “Declaring further that no breach of the 1995 Settlement Agreement, the

1998 Final Release, and/or the 1996 Local Settlements occurred in connection with the
Lago Agrio Litigation.”

This request is not granted.

E: Miscellaneous

Compensation: The Tribunal decides, confirming its earlier procedural orders, that all
issues of quantum shall be addressed in Track III of these arbitration proceedings. These
issues shall include issues as to reparation in the form of compensation for injuries
sustained by the First Claimant or the Second Claimant, as pleaded by the Claimants,
including any assessment of the amount of compensation, moral damages, indemnities,
reimbursements, payments, expenses and interest. Track III may also address, to the

extent still relevant, issues of non-compensatory restitution.

Costs: The Parties are agreed and the Tribunal here confirms that all issues relating to
legal and arbitration costs under Articles 38-40 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules
are deferred to a later stage of these arbitration proceedings. Nevertheless, the Tribunal
considers that it would be useful for the Parties to provide breakdowns of the amounts
of their respective claims for legal costs to date, as set out in as set out in this Award’s

Operative Part X.

Track III Issues: Subject to any further order of the Tribunal otherwise, the issues for
Track III shall include: (i) compensation (as described above); (ii) the Parties’ extant
requests for relief left undecided in this Award, as identified in their respective letters
dated 19 March and 20 April 2018 (including any extant issues as to non-compensatory
restitution); (iii) the ‘show cause’ issues as to compensation claimed by the Claimants
for the Respondent’s violations of the Tribunal’s First and Second Interim Awards on
Interim Measures; and (iv) the Respondent’s application for the reconsideration of the

Tribunal’s First, Second and Fourth Interim Awards.

PART X

THE OPERATIVE PART

A: Introduction

For the reasons set out in this Award, based on the evidential materials adduced
in these arbitration proceedings together with its earlier awards, orders and
decision, the Tribunal makes the following declarations and orders under the

Treaty and international law:

B: Declarations as to Jurisdiction and Admissibility

The Tribunal declares that it has jurisdiction under Article VI of the Treaty over
the claims pleaded in this arbitration by the First Claimant (Chevron) and the
Second Claimant (TexPet) under Articles II(3)(a) and II(3)(c) of the Treaty; and
the Tribunal rejects all objections as to lack of jurisdiction pleaded by the

Respondent;

The Tribunal declares that the claims pleaded in this arbitration by the First
Claimant and the Second Claimant under Articles II(3)(a) and II(3)(c) of the
treaty are admissible under Article VI of the Treaty; and the Tribunal rejects all

objections as to non-admissibility pleaded by the Respondent.

C: Declarations as to the Merits

The Tribunal declares that material parts of the Lago Agrio Judgment of 14
February 2011 (as clarified by order of 4 March 2011) were corruptly
‘ghostwritten’ for Judge Nicolas Zambrano Lozada, as a judge of the Lago Agrio
Court, by one or more of the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ representatives in return for
a promise by such representative(s) to pay to Judge Zambrano a bribe from the
proceeds of the Lago Agrio Judgment’s enforcement by the Lago Agrio
Plaintiffs;

The Tribunal declares that the Respondent, by issuing, rendering enforceable,

maintaining the enforceability and executing the Lago Agrio Judgment (as also

Part X — Page 1

10.6

10.7

10.8

10.9

10.10

decided by the Lago Agrio Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts) and
knowingly facilitating its enforcement outside Ecuador, wrongfully committed a
denial of justice under the standards both for fair and equitable treatment and
for treatment required by customary international law under Article II(3)(a) of

the Treaty;

The Tribunal declares that the Respondent is liable to make full reparation to the
First Claimant and the Second Claimant for denial of justice under the standards
both for fair and equitable treatment and for treatment required by customary
international law under Article I(3)(a) of the Treaty; and the Tribunal rejects

the defences pleaded by the Respondent;

The Tribunal (by a majority) declares, confirming its Decision on Track IB, that
the Lago Agrio Complaint of 7 May 1998, as an initial pleading, included
individual claims (for personal harm) resting upon individual rights under
Ecuadorian law, not falling within the scope of the 1995 Settlement Agreement
and that, therefore, the Lago Agrio Complaint was not wholly barred at its
inception by res judicata under Ecuadorian law, by virtue of the 1995 Settlement

Agreement;

The Tribunal declares that the said Lago Agrio Judgment (as also decided by the
Lago Agrio Appell Cc ion and Constitutional Courts) decided only diffuse

 

claims as distinct from individual claims for personal harm by the Lago Agrio
Plaintiffs, whereby the Respondent violated its obligations towards the First
Claimant and the Second Claimant as “Releasees” under the 1995 Settlement

Agreement;

The Tribunal declares that the Respondent is liable to make full reparation to the
First Claimant and the Second Claimant under Article II(3)(c) of the Treaty for
the non-observation of its obligations towards each of them as a “Releasee” under
the 1995 Settlement Agreement; and the Tribunal rejects the defences pleaded by
the Respondent;

The Tribunal declares that, given the Respondent’s said denial of justice, the
Lago Agrio Judgment (as also decided by the Lago Agrio Appellate, Cassation

and Constitutional Courts) grossly violated the fundamental procedural rights of

Part X — Page 2

10.11

10.12

10.13

the First Claimant (including its rights of defence); the said Lago Agrio
Judgment (as thus decided) is contrary to international public policy; and no part
of the said Lago Agrio Judgment should be recognised or enforced by any State

with knowledge of the Respondent’s said denial of justice;

The Tribunal declares that any injury to the First Claimant or the Second
Claimant caused by the recognition or enforcement of any part of the Lago Agrio
Judgment within or without Ecuador (as decided by the Lago Agrio Appellate,

within the meaning of the 1995 Settlement Agreement.

The Respondent shall, to the satisfaction of the Tribunal and as unconditional

obligations of result (save where otherwise indicated):

Agrio Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts);

(ii) take immediate steps, of its own choosing, to preclude any of the Lago
Agrio Plaintiffs, any “trust” purporting to represent their interests
(including the “Frente de Defensa La Amazonia”), any of the Lago Agrio
Plaintiffs’ representatives, and any non-party funder from enforcing any
part of the Lago Agrio Judgment (as also decided by the Lago Agrio
Appellate, Cassation and Constitutional Courts), directly or indirectly,
