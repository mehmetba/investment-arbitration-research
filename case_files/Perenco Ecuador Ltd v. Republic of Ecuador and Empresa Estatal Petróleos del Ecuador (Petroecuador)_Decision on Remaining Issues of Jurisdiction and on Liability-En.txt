INTRODUCTION

The Parties

The Claimant, Perenco Ecuador Limited, is a company incorporated under the laws of the
Commonwealth of the Bahamas. The Claimant avers that at the material time, namely on 17
October 2007, when consent to the arbitration of this dispute was given, it was controlled by
French nationals and hence the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the Treaty claim brought by
Perenco.' The Claimant has also advanced claims of breach of the Participation Contracts
relating to Blocks 7 and 21. The Claimant is hereinafter referred to as “Perenco” or “the

Claimant.”

The Respondent is the Republic of Ecuador and is hereinafter referred to as “Ecuador” or “the

Respondent.”

The Claimant and the Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as “the Parties.”

The Parties’ respective representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).

The Dispute

This proceeding concerns alleged breaches by Ecuador of the obligations under the Agreement
between the Government of the French Republic and the Government of the Republic of
Ecuador on the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments (“the Treaty” or the
“BIT”) and two “Participation Contracts” (also known as “production sharing contracts”)
concluded by the Claimant and Petroecuador, the latter acting on the State’s behalf, relating to

the exploration and exploitation of Blocks 7 and 21 situated in the Ecuadorian Amazon region.

The Participation Contracts are, first, the Contract Modifying the Service Contract to a
Participation for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons in Block 7 of the Amazon

Region, including the Contract for the Coca-Payamino Unified Field (“the Block 7

Amended Request for Arbitration dated 30 April 2008, paragraph 14 (“Amended Request”). For a further
description of the facts relating to this aspect of the Claimant’s claim, see below at section IIIA.

Participation Contract” or “the Block 7 Contract”),” and second, the Participation Contract
for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons in Block 21 of the Amazon Region (“the
Block 21 Participation Contract” or “the Block 21 Contract”),* (together, the two contracts
will be referred as “the Participation Contracts” or “the Contracts’). Perenco also entered
into Joint Operating Agreements with other entities holding interests in Blocks 7 and 21.4
These agreements, and the Parties’ respective rights and obligations under the Contracts will be

described in further detail below.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On 30 April 2008, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or
“Centre”) received a request for arbitration (“the Request”) from Perenco against the
Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petrdleos del Ecuador (‘“Petroecuador’).
Perenco’s Request was brought to ICSID on the basis of Article 9 of the Treaty and the

arbitration clauses contained in the Participation Contracts.

On 4 June 2008, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance with
Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and

Nationals of Other States (“ICSID Convention”).

On 28 July 2008, the Claimant filed an amended request for arbitration (“the Amended

Request”).

The Tribunal was initially constituted on 21 November 2008 as follows: Thomas Bingham, a
national of the United Kingdom, appointed as President by the party-appointed arbitrators,
after consultation with the parties; Charles N. Brower, a national of the United States,
appointed by the Claimant; and J. Christopher Thomas QC, a national of Canada, appointed by

the Respondent.

21 of the Ecuadorian Amazon Region, 20 March 1995 (translation resubmitted on 04-12-12) (“Block 21

A hearing on provisional measures was held in Paris, France, on 19 March 2009.

accompanied by the witness statements of Mr. Eric D’Argentré, Mr. Laurent Combe, and Mr.

Patrick Spink, as well as by the first expert report of Dr. Hernan Pérez Loose.
On 8 May 2009, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Provisional Measures (“the Decision on
Provisional Measures”) holding that:

79. ... circumstances require it to recommend, and it does recommend,
provisional measures restraining the Respondents from:

qd) demanding that Perenco pay any amounts allegedly due pursuant to Law
42;
(2) instituting or further pursuing any action, judicial or otherwise, including

the actions described in the notices dated 19 February and 3 March 2009, to

collect from Perenco any payments Respondents claim are owed by Perenco or
the Consortium pursuant to Law 42;

(3) instituting or pursuing any action, judicial or otherwise, against Perenco
or any of its officers or employees, arising from or in connection with the
Participation Contracts; and

(4) unilaterally amending, rescinding, terminating, or repudiating the
Participation Contracts or engaging in any other conduct which may directly or
indirectly affect or alter the legal situation under the Participation Contracts, as
agreed upon by the parties.*

On 17 July 2009, Ecuador and Petroecuador filed, in separate submissions, Objections to
Jurisdiction. Ecuador’s Objections were accompanied by the witness statement of Dr. Christian
Davalos and the first expert reports of Professors Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, Luis Parraguez
Ruiz and Hernan Salgado Pesantes. The Respondent made a formal application under Article
41(2) of the Convention that its jurisdictional objections be dealt with as a preliminary

question.

On 17 September 2009, Perenco filed its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction. It was
accompanied by the witness statement of Mr. Andrew Derman and the second expert report of

Dr. Hernan Pérez Loose.

they attached the second expert reports of Professors Aguilar and Parraguez.

On 16 December 2009, following the resignation of Judge Brower, the Secretary-General
notified the Parties of the vacancy on the Tribunal and suspended the proceedings pursuant to
Rule 10(2) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (“the Arbitration
Rules”).

On 13 January 2010, the Claimant appointed Mr. Neil Kaplan CBE, QC, SBS, a national of the

United Kingdom, and the Tribunal was reconstituted.

On 15 January 2010, Perenco filed its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, to which it attached the third

expert report of Dr. Pérez Loose.

28. On 17 February 2010, following the resignation of Lord Bingham, the proceedings were

suspended again.

29. The Parties were unable to agree on a third arbitrator to serve as the President of the Tribunal
and consequently invoked Article 38 of the ICSID Convention to request that the Chairman of
the Administrative Council designate the President of the Tribunal. The Chairman designated
Judge Peter Tomka, a national of Slovakia, to sit as President, and the Tribunal was

reconstituted on 6 May 2010.

THE FACTS

As noted above, the dispute between the Parties concerns the Block 7 and Block 21
Participation Contracts. Perenco was the sole operator and majority holder of Participation
Contract rights in both Blocks, holding a 53.75% interest in Block 21 and a 57.5% interest in
Block 7. The remaining interest in both Blocks was held by Burlington Resources Oriente

Limited (“Burlington Oriente”), with which Perenco has formed a Consortium.

Ownership and Control of the Claimant

Before turning to address the chain of events that led to the initiation of this arbitration, it is
necessary to summarise the facts insofar as they relate to the Respondent’s objection to the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction over Perenco’s Treaty claim. Submissions on the objection, and the
evidence of witnesses tendered by the Parties in relation thereto, are addressed further below at

sections IV.A.(1), and VII.

Perenco is part of the Perenco Group of Companies founded by a French national, the late Mr.
Hubert Perrodo, in 1975. Among other things, it is engaged in the exploration and exploitation

of hydrocarbon resources.

Perenco was incorporated in the Bahamas in November 2001 to hold the Perenco Group’s

investments in Ecuador.

From the time that Mr. Hubert Perrodo took Perenco private in 1995’ until his demise on 29
December 2006 as a result of a climbing accident in France, he controlled the Perenco Group

of Companies.*

At the time of Mr. Perrodo’s death, on 29 December 2006, Perenco was part of the following

corporate structure:°

a

Its sole shareholder was Perenco Gabon S.A (formerly Perenco S.A), also
incorporated in the Commonwealth of the Bahamas.

b

Perenco Gabon S.A, in turn, was wholly owned by Perenco S.A. (formerly
Perenco Oil and Gas), also incorporated in the Commonwealth of the Bahamas.

c

Perenco S.A was wholly owned by Perenco International Limited (“PIL”), also
incorporated in the Commonwealth of the Bahamas.

d

92.9% of the registered shares of PIL were owned by Mr. Hubert Perrodo and the
remaining 7.1% of the shares were owned by another Bahamian company,
Glenmor Energy Limited, whose sole shareholder was Mr. Frangois Perrodo, Mr.

Hubert Perrodo’s eldest son. Mr. Hubert Perrodo gifted 7.1% of the shares in PIL
to his son in 2004."°
Mr. Hubert Perrodo died intestate. Under French law, upon the death of an intestate, the
entirety of his estate vests automatically in his heirs.'' The evidence is that Mr. Perrodo’s
92.9% shareholding in PIL formed part of his estate and thus ownership of that shareholding
also vested automatically in his heirs, namely, his widow, Ka Yee Perrodo, and his three
children, Francois, Nathalie and Bertrand (subject to a further issue of determining the heirs’

respective entitlements, a matter discussed further below). a

Under Bahamian law, where an intestate had property sited in the Commonwealth of the
Bahamas, it is necessary for there to be a grant of the estate to an administrator pursuant to
Letters of Administration. The heirs instructed Bahamian counsel, Ms. Heather Thompson, to
make an application for Letters of Administration on 16 April 2009 in respect of the estate. >

Letters were duly granted on 19 August 2009.'4

The delay between the time of Mr. Hubert Perrodo’s death and the application and grant for
Letters of Administration appears to be due to a dispute between Ka Yee Perrodo and her
children, as evidenced by the fact that on 15 February 2008, Mrs. Perrodo lodged a caveat in
the Supreme Court of the Bahamas preventing any grant of Letters of Administration from
being made in respect of the estate of Hubert Perrodo.'° Mrs. Perrodo later withdrew the

Caveat on 30 March 2009 and the application for Letters of Administration was made shortly

thereafter. '° It was only on 22 December 2011 that the heirs of Hubert Perrodo were registered

as shareholders of PIL (the ultimate parent company of Perenco). 0

Quite apart from the handling of the estate and the ultimate distribution of the PIL shares to the
heirs, steps were also taken by PIL’s Board of Directors shortly after Mr. Perrodo’s death, first
to elect his eldest son Frangois Perrodo as a member and Chairman of the Board of Directors
of PIL and Perenco S.A. on 12 January 2007'8 and then, on 24 September 2007, to elect Ka

Yee Perrodo and Nathalie Perrodo to PIL’s Board of Directors. '°

Ecuador’s Hydrocarbons Industry

This Section summarises the facts of this dispute relating to the development of Ecuador’s

hydrocarbons industry insofar as they are relevant to the Tribunal’s findings.

Prior to 1993, like many other countries, Ecuador had adopted the ‘service contract’ modality
for oil and gas explorations.”° Under a service contract, the contractor, usually an international
oil company, provides all the services necessary to explore and develop the State’s oil deposits
in return for payment of a fee which is supposed to cover the costs of production incurred as
well as a margin of profit.”! The contractor acts solely as a service provider under this model
and it is not entitled to any share in any oil that may be produced. In such an arrangement,
there may be little commercial incentive for the contractor to seek to exploit an oilfield to its

maximum potential, consistent with proper drilling practices.

This arrangement thus had its disadvantages, both for Ecuador and for the oil companies

operating in the country. When oil prices were low, as was the case during the 1980s and 90s,

Ecuador ran the risk that the service fees generated by the contractor would exceed the revenue
it received from oil sales and consequently, it would incur losses, especially when it had little
control over the costs incurred by the contractor and the contractor had little incentive to keep
such costs down.” Further, due to the fee structure of the service contracts, the oil companies
had little incentive to enter into such contracts because of the absence of any “upside”
potential.”* They therefore lacked any commercial motivation to fully exploit the oil and gas
resources of Ecuador in accordance with the State’s overall development goals. This is

evidenced by the fact that from 1988 to 1993, no service contracts were signed in Ecuador.”*

Ecuador thus resolved to revamp its existing hydrocarbons law to make investment in its
hydrocarbons industry more attractive.” On 29 November 1993, Ecuador passed Law 44 to
amend its existing Hydrocarbons Law to recognise “participation contracts” as the preferred
contractual model for the exploration and exploitation of its hydrocarbon resources.”° The
explanatory memoranda accompanying Law 44 reasoned that the risks involved in exploration
and exploitation of its hydrocarbon resources needed to be shared with international oil
companies due to the scarce resources that Ecuador could commit to such ventures, and that
“the Services Contract does not allow the contracting company to own a production flow”,
“[t]his characteristic denatur[ing] the interest and purpose of international oil companies, for
the majority of which the availability of production for selling oil in international markets is an

essential item.”””

As was the case for service contracts under the law of Ecuador, under production sharing
contracts the ownership of the hydrocarbon resources remained with the State. However, the
form of remuneration to the contractor is based upon a production-sharing modality, requiring
the contractor to fund all costs of exploration and exploitation of the hydrocarbons in exchange

for a share of the oil produced, the proportion of which would depend on allocation formulas

set out in each contract.“ The evidence is that most oil companies, including Perenco, prefer

participation contracts even though there is no guarantee that their costs will be covered,

because there is a greater potential reward, particularly when oil prices rise.”
Law 44 defined participation contracts as follows:

[C]ontracts executed by the State, by means of Petroecuador, whereby the
contractor is delegated with...the right to explore and exploit hydrocarbons in the
contract’s area, making at its own account and risk all investments, cost and
expenses necessary for the exploration, development and exploitation.

The contractor...will have the right to a participation in the production from the
contract’s area, which will be calculated on the basis of the percentages offered
and agreed therein, in relation with the volume of hydrocarbons produced. This
participation, valued at the sales price of hydrocarbons from the contract area,
which in no case shall be less than the reference price, will be the contractor’s
gross income, from which the contractor will make deductions and pay income
tax, in accordance with the rules set in the Internal Tax Regime Law.”

Apart from amending the Hydrocarbons Law, Ecuador also took other steps to create a legal
and regulatory environment conducive to attracting further foreign investment in the
hydrocarbons and other sectors. For example, in 1997, Ecuador enacted Law 46 on “the Law
on Promotion and Guarantee of Investments”, the stated objective of which was to “promote
national and foreign investment and regulate the rights and obligations of the investors so that
they may effectively contribute to the economic and social development of the country.”*!
Other measures included amendments to its Constitution which guaranteed that foreign
investment should be afforded the same rights and treatment as national investment,” the

enactment of privatisation laws in 2000 which allowed investors to acquire up to 51% of the

°° as well as measures to replace the then-

shares in electric and telecommunications busines:

Ecuadorian currency, the sucre, with the US dollar.**

The Government also sought to facilitate the financing and construction of a new pipeline, the
Oleoducto de Crudos Pesados or “OCP”.® In February 2001, the Government and a seven-
company consortium concluded a US$ 1.1 billion agreement to construct the ocp.** The OCP
made it possible for significant quantities of Ecuador’s oil reserves hitherto located in remote

areas of the Amazon to be produced and shipped in a commercially viable manner.*”

Perenco’s interests in the Participation Contracts for Blocks 7 and 21

Blocks 7 and 21 are located in the Ecuadorian Amazonian Region and each covers an area of

approximately 200,000 hectares.

In January 1994, shortly after the enactment of Law 44, Petroecuador’s Special Bidding
Commission (known in Spanish as the Comité Especial de Licitaciones (“CEL”)) announced
the 7" International Bidding Round for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons for

Block 21, a block that had not been previously exploited.**

On 15 March 1995, the CEL awarded the Exploration and Exploitation of Block 21 to a group
of companies, namely, Oryx Ecuador Energy Company (“Oryx”), Santa Fe Minerales del
Ecuador Sociedad An6énima (“Santa Fe”), Sociedad Internacional Petrolera Sociedad
An6énima (“SIPETROL”) and Compajifa Latinoamericana Petrolera Sociedad Andénima
(“CLAPSA”).*° The Participation Contract between Petroecuador and these companies was
signed on 20 March 1995,*° Shortly after, in June 1995, Santa Fe transferred its rights and
obligations in the Block 21 Participation Contract to Preussag Energie GMBH PBP

(“Preussag”). “! In June 1999, Kerr McGee Ecuador Energy Corporation acquired Oryx,

including its interest in Block 21.”

Unlike Block 21, Block 7 was originally operated pursuant to a Service Contract concluded in
1985 between British Petroleum (“BP”) and the state-owned enterprise Corporacién Estatal

Petrolera Ecuatoriana (“CEPE”) (Petroecuador’s predecessor).*?

In 1990, BP assigned the Block 7 Service Contract to Oryx. It was only in 1999 (some six
years after Law 44 contemplated the transformation of Service Contracts into Participation
Contracts) that Petroecuador began discussions on the transition of the Block 7 Services
Contract to a Participation Contract.*° On 10 March 2000, shortly after Kerr McGee acquired
Oryx, the CEL approved the Block 7 Services Contract’s migration to a Participation Contract
between Petroecuador and the same consortium that by that time held interests in Block 21,
namely, Kerr McGee, Preussag, SIPETROL and CLAPSA 1. *° On 23 March 2000, the
Participation Contract for Block 7 was signed between Petroecuador and Kerr McGee,

Preussag and SIPETROL and CLAPSA II.*”

In August 2001, Perenco’s Vice President of Business Development, Mr. Patrick Spink, was
contacted by the Business Development Manager of Burlington Resources Inc.
(“Burlington”). Burlington’s subsidiary, Burlington Oriente, was in discussions to acquire
Kerr McGee’s interests in Blocks 7 and 21. According to Mr. Spink, Burlington originally

intended to purchase all of Kerr McGee’s interests in Blocks 7 and 21 but had decided not to

proceed with the full purchase due to a major acquisition it had made in Canada.** Burlington
still wished to proceed with the purchase of 5% of Kerr McGee’s interest and suggested that

Perenco purchase the remaining interest.”

According to Mr. Spink, from Perenco’s perspective, this opportunity was potentially lucrative
because it provided the Perenco Group with the possibility of acquiring a combination of a
mature asset (Block 7), that is, an asset which already had infrastructure and which was already
producing oil, as well as a greenfield development project (Block 21), which had not been
developed at all. While the Perenco Group had operated only mature fields, and had minimal
experience with greenfield developments in Colombia and West Africa, it was looking for
other suitable development opportunities. Purchasing Kerr McGee’s interests in Blocks 7 and
21 would allow Perenco to generate income from Block 7 while it incurred costs in developing

a greenfield block in a remote area where the oil was believed to be of poorer quality.*°

According to the evidence of the Claimant, having regard to these factors, along with
Perenco’s perception of the favourable investment environment in Ecuador at the time,
Perenco purchased 45% of Kerr McGee’s interest in Blocks 7 and 21 for a purchase price of

US $79 million in or around December 2001.7!

On 2 September 2002, after the requisite government approval had been obtained, *? Kerr
McGee assigned its interests in the Participation Contracts for Blocks 7 and 21 to Perenco.”*

The ownership interests in the Blocks at this time were as follows:

Perenco’s purchase of Kerr McGee’s interests in Blocks 7 and 21 was also accompanied by its
purchase of Kerr McGee’s 1.809% equity stake in the Consortium operating the OCP. This
included an undertaking of ship-or-pay commitments for Block 21 of 20,000 barrels per day
until 2018. If Perenco did not ship these 20,000 barrels a day, it would incur payment

obligations for the unused capacity.

Shortly after acquiring its interests in the Blocks, Perenco entered into two Joint Operating
Agreements with Burlington and Preussag whereby Perenco became the Operator of the Joint
Operations. 55 Perenco’s responsibilities as Operator included the management of joint
operations as well as the distribution of profits and administration of joint debts and expenses.
In late 2005, to comply with Ecuadorian tax requirements intended to simplify income tax
auditing and collection, the three companies entered into a Consortium Agreement, which

became effective on 1 January 2006.°°

Three years after acquiring the interests in Blocks 7 and 21 from Kerr McGee, Perenco and
Burlington decided to acquire Preussag’s interests in Block 7 and Block 21. On 7 September
2005, the agreement for the purchase was signed and the requisite government approvals were
also given.” Perenco agreed to pay US $23.5 million for interests acquired by it. The

allocation of interests between Perenco and Burlington were then as follows:

As part of the agreement, Perenco agreed to purchase a small additional equity interest in the

OCP, which thereafter stood at 2.1608%.°°

The Participation Contracts for Blocks 7 and 21 were set to expire in 2010 and 2021,
respectively. The two Contracts differ in certain terms, but they generally follow the same
scheme. In essence, they granted Perenco the right to, “carry out, on its own account and risk,
the activities for Crude Oil exploitation and additional exploration in the Contract Area,
investing the capital and using the necessary personnel, equipment, machinery and technology
for full performance, in exchange for which the Contractor shall receive, as a participation, a

percentage of the Measured Production.”

Clause 8.1 of each of the Participation Contracts set forth the formula for calculating
participation percentages. The Contracts allocated oil production on the basis of two variables,
namely, the volume of oil produced (the X factor) and the quality of crude oil produced (the Y
factor). °! According to the formula, as production increases in volume, or quality, the

contractor’s participation percentage decreases.”

or the creation or elimination of new taxes not foreseen in this Contract, or a
change in the employee profit-sharing regulations in effect on the signature date
of this Contract and as described in this Clause, or their interpretation, which
have consequences for the economy of this Contract, a correction factor shall be

Oil price increases and Ecuador’s response

Shortly after Perenco purchased its interests in Blocks 7 and 21, international oil prices began
to rise dramatically. Block 7 produced a crude oil known in the market as “Oriente Crude” and
Block 21 produced a crude oil known as “Napo Crude”, the latter considered to be of lower
quality than Oriente Crude. During the 1980s and 90s, a period of relative stability in oil
prices, the price for Napo and Oriente Crude was around US $15/bb1.° The WTI benchmark
for crude oil at the time was about US $20/bbI.% These prices remained more or less at the

same level until the 2000s.

In early 2002, the price of Ecuadorian crude was still fluctuating around US $15/bbl. By 2005,
however, prices had more than tripled, reaching US $50/bbl.”°

By 2006, the Ecuadorian crude price had risen to US $60/bbl (US $70/bbl WTI), and by March
2008, it rose further to almost US $90/bbl (US $100/bbl WTI), reaching nearly US $120/bbl
(USD $130/bbl WTI) in June 2008.’! The global financial crisis caused oil prices to fall
sharply to below US $30/bbI through 2008 and the beginning of 2009, but prices then began to
recover, stabilising in the range of US $60-70/bb1 for most of 2009 and 2010.

In August 2005, the Contraloria General del Estado became concerned about the impact of
rising oil prices on the Ecuadorian petroleum sector and undertook an audit of participation
contracts and service contracts for the period 1 March 2000 to 30 October 2004. ° The
Contraloria General del Estado acts as an “external auditor” of State agencies in Ecuador, and
its directions to agencies regarding their use of public monies are, according to the Respondent,
enforceable by way of administrative sanctions.” It concluded that the increase in oil prices
was generating extraordinary profits for oil companies and that the participation contracts
should be renegotiated. Shortly thereafter, in September 2005, the Board of Directors of
Petroecuador recommended that the Special Bidding Committee of Petroecuador initiate

renegotiations of all of the participation and service contracts then in force.”>

Origins of the dispute: Events relating to Law 42-2006 Amending the Hydrocarbons Law

In November 2005, the then-President of the Republic of Ecuador, Mr. Luis Alfredo Palacio
Gonzalez, announced the goal of renegotiating the participation contracts in order to provide
the State with a greater share of revenue from crude oil sales.” Petroecuador then informed oil
companies operating in Ecuador of its intention to renegotiate its participation contracts with
them.”’ The Claimant alleges that while the Ecuadorian government initiated discussions with

some oil companies, there were no serious attempts to negotiate with it.

Before announcing its intention, in November 2005 Petroecuador wrote to the Chairman of the
Permanent Specialized Commission on Civil and Criminal Matters in Ecuador regarding the
proposal to renegotiate oil and gas contracts.*° Referring to the Regulations for Application for

the Law Reforming Law 44, Petroecuador stated:

Article 32 of the mentioned Regulations establishes the procedure to be followed
for the contractual modification submitted for approval to the CEL. In summary,
this procedure indicates that the contractual modifications may be proposed by
either of the parties, and it corresponds to PETROECUADOR to negotiate them
with the contractor, requiring always the prior consent of the other party. In the
event that a mutual agreement is reached based on the respective specifications,
the CEO shall submit the modifications agreed upon with the contractor to the
Board of Directors for its information and for a report.*!

(1) The enactment of Law 42

On 1 March 2006, President Palacio submitted a bill to Congress proposing to amend the
Hydrocarbons Law (a “Bill for the Law Reforming the Hydrocarbons Law” or the “Bill’’),
stating in the accompanying explanatory memorandum that he “ha[d] invited the oil companies

that have contracts with the Ecuadorian State to begin processes of reaching an understanding

for the equitable distribution of the extraordinary earnings.”*”

The cover letter of the Bill stated that it “should be processed as economically urgent” and that
its rationale may be summed up “as the recovery of economic equity to the benefit of the State
in hydrocarbons exploration and exploitation contracts entered into by the Republic of
Ecuador.”** The significant increase in prices, the explanatory memorandum stated further,

“obligates the National Government to submit reforms to the Hydrocarbons Law to the

National Congress.”**

The memorandum stated further that “[t]he contracts for oil and gas exploration and
exploitation in Ecuador were entered into considering the rebus sic stantibus [‘things standing
thus’] clause, which means that the contracts are understood to have been reached under the
tacit condition that the original conditions contracted will subsist, and that when this is not so
and a change in those circumstances occurs, equilibrium in the contractual obligations needs to
be reestablished to the extent that something extraordinary and unforeseeable has an impact on
what the parties had foreseen, on which economic basis they assumed their obligations.”*° It
concluded that “[aJt all times, the equilibrium of the contracts is being maintained, since all the
technical, economic and legal parameters considered by the companies in their analysis are
being respected, and what is being legislated upon are those events that never formed a part of
the will of the parties, such as the extraordinary increase in crude oil prices at the international

level.”*°

The National Congress of Ecuador convened an extraordinary meeting on 29 March 2006 to
debate the Bill. The Claimant directed the Tribunal to statements made by various members of
Congress which displayed a range of opinion. One representative asserted “here we are going
to know who is who; either we vote for the motherland, for the people, for the poor, for the
humble, or we vote for the transnational companies that have stolen our blood, our life, our

987

hope.””’ Another representative focused on the nature of the contractual relations Petroecuador

had entered into with the oil companies, noting that: “...faced with the bill sent by the
President of the Republic, we have discussed if under the law whether or not we can by law

unilaterally amend oil contracts with retroactive effect. That and nothing else is the legal

discussion.”**

The Tribunal notes that ascertaining the intent of the legislative body by means of reference to
the statements of individual legislators is notoriously difficult and apt to lead to a

misapprehension of the intent of the legislature as a whole which is reflected in its acts. It has

taken note of these and other statements, but it has not attempted to use them as a means of

attaching legal significance to the acts of the legislature.

The Ecuadorian Congress passed the Law No. 2006-42 Amending the Hydrocarbons Law (the
“HCL Amendment”) on 19 April 2006. The Law's preamble referred to the Ecuadorian
State’s duty to “defend the natural heritage of the country and preserve the sustainable growth
of the economy, as well as balanced, equitable development for the collective good.”*° It
referred to Article 247 of the Constitution, stating that “subsoil resources are the inalienable
and imprescriptible property of the Ecuadorian government and, therefore, its exploitation

must take place on the basis of national interests and in accordance with the principle of

reasonability.””!

Article 2 of the HCL Amendment stated as follows:

“Article...Participation of the State in surplus prices from the sale of oil and gas
not agreed upon or not foreseen. Contractor companies that maintain participation
contracts for the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons in effect with the
Ecuadorian state under this Law, without prejudice to the volume of crude oil
subject to participation that corresponds to them, when the effective monthly
medium price of FOB sale of Ecuadorian oil petroleum goes above the monthly
average prices in effect at the time of the execution of the contract, expressed in
constant prices for the month of liquidation, will recognize in favor of the
Ecuadorian state a participation of at least 50% of the extraordinary income
generated by the difference in price. For purposes of this Article, extraordinary
revenues shall be understood to mean the difference in the above-described price,
multiplied by the number of barrels produced.”

Following this, Decree No. 1583 Implementing Law 42-2006 was formally issued on 23 June
2006.”°

(2) Implementation of Law 42

On 6 July 2006, the Ministry of Energy and Mines notified Perenco by letter that the prices in
effect at the time of execution of the Block 7 and 21 Participation Contracts were US
$25.111383 and US $15.358274.° These became the relevant “reference” prices for the
purpose of Article 2 of the HCL Amendment.

In July 2006, for instance, the market price for Oriente Crude from Block 7 was US $65.66/bbl
and the adjusted reference price was US $30.01/bbl. Thus, the Law 42 “levy” (to use the
Respondent’s term in this arbitration”’) was US $17.825 per barrel of oil produced in Block 7
(50% of the difference between US $65.66/bbl and US $30.01/bbl). Law 42 would give the
Government of Ecuador an increased participation in the revenues generated from all sales
above such reference prices. On the foregoing example, the Contractor would realise US

$47.835 on the sale of a barrel of oil, rather than the market price of US $65.66/bbl.

On 13 July 2006, the Government issued Executive Decree No. 1672 Implementing Law 42-
2006, which replaced Decree No. 1583 Implementing Law 42-2006 of 23 June 2006 (the
“First Implementing Regulation’”).”°

It, amongst other things, identified the kind of agreements covered by the HCL Amendment,
set the exact percentage of “extraordinary income” payable to the State (50%), provided the
formula to assist in determining the corresponding quantum, and stipulated that payments

pursuant to Law 42 were to be made on a monthly basis.°”

After the law was enacted, by letter dated 26 July 2006 Perenco wrote to the Central Bank of
Ecuador, copied to Petroleum Contracts Administrative Unit of Petroecuador, referring to the
letter it received from the latter notifying it of its Law 42 dues for Block 21, and enclosing a

cheque for US $14,525,361.00. Perenco “state[d] for the record” that it considered Law 42 to

be “unconstitutional along with other legal entities that have filed their respective actions with
the Constitutional Court” and that it “violates certain rights of Consortium members explicitly
contained in the Participation Contracts for Blocks 7 and 21, and in certain International
Treaties”, but that until the law was declared as such, it would make the payment under protest

and with its rights reserved.°*

As Perenco’s letter noted, around this time a Constitutional Court challenge was launched by
Mr. Mauricio Pinto Mancheno in his own interests and in the interests that he represented as
the Chairman of the Chamber of Manufacturers of Pinchincha, as well as the legal
representative of one thousand citizens (based on Article 276(1) of the Constitution of
Ecuador). °° There is no record evidence as to the membership of the Chamber of
Manufacturers. It was contended by the Respondent that it was obvious that the oil companies
were behind the claim, but there is not sufficient evidence of this to make any kind of finding
of fact, although the judgment did record the contention of the Head of the Congress in answer
to the petition that Mr. Pinto was the “official defender of multinational oil companies that
allegedly, in the plaintiffs view, are harmed or injured by the challenged law”!

On 6 September 2006, the Constitutional Tribunal ruled that Law 42 was constitutional and
further that it did not violate the principles of Ecuadorian civil law concerning the performance

101

of the contracts. The petitioners had challenged the form and substantive constitutionality of

Law 42, submitting that it amounted to a modification of the legal system to which oil
contracts with the State were subject, violating fundamental rights to certainty, non-
retroactivity, property, and the modification of administrative contracts by agreement only.'
The Constitutional Tribunal examined the distinction between administrative and civil law

contracts under Ecuadorian law, and then between administrative contracts for the provision of

public services and otherwise. It concluded that unlike contracts between private parties, the
Administration in an administrative contract “is placed in a privileged position with respect to
what is being administered...[a]nd it is precisely this position of privilge that allows the

government...to exercise the power to modify or revise the agreement 10

A relevant illustration of this was that the pacta sunt servanda principle applicable to the
contract had the potential to “fall apart when causes emerge that substantially alter[ed] those
that formed the reality or the state of things upon which the contract was executed.”!™ The
Court held that Law 42 fell within the ambit of this principle, creating “obligations on subjects
that ha[d] not been the subject of contractual stipulation, which ha[d] not been negotiated or
anticipated” by the parties to the contracts. '°° It buttressed this further by concluding that
Article 249 of the Constitution, which prohibited unilateral modifications of contracts by
legislation, did not apply to oil contracts with the State because Article 249 referred
exclusively to administrative contracts for the provision of public services (which differed
from contracts for hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation), and the State would waive
expressly its power to modify in the contract, as recognized in Article 271 of the
Constitution.'° Finally, the Court held that Law 42 did not violate the constitutional guarantee
against retroactivity, or the right to property since hydrocarbons are a non-renewable natural

: . «107
resource subject to public dominion.

During this time, Perenco continued to invest in Blocks 7 and 21. According to the Claimant,
as 2006 drew to a close, it had invested some US $55,004,000 and US $46,938,000 in Blocks
21 and 7, respectively, for the year. '° From April 2006 to October 2007, the Consortium
invested an additional US $61 million and drilled an additional 15 wells in Blocks 7 and 21

compared to the previous year. | The Consortium also submitted to Ecuador on 6 November

2006 an amendment to its development plan for Block 7 in relation to the Oso field." Its
development plan indicated that it anticipated continued positive cash flows in the midst of the
initial application of Law 42 at a rate of 50%.''' The 2006 Oso Development Plan was

approved by the Ministry of Energy and Mines in Ecuador in March 2007.'!

This did not, however, detract from the concerns expressed by Perenco with regard to Law 42's
economic impact on its Ecuadorian operations. On 18 December 2006, Perenco wrote to
Petroecuador, requesting that the latter initiate the administrative process whereby the parties
would analyse the economic impact of Law 42 on Blocks 7 and 21 pursuant to clause 11 of
both Contracts, and stated its intention to file the necessary economic data in support of its
request to adjust the percentage of participation in its favour.''? Petroecuador did not respond

officially to this request.

During the hearing, there was a substantial exchange between the parties as to the timing of
this request and specifically whose responsibility it was to deal with the adjustment of the

participation in the circumstances.

In the Respondent’s view, on a proper construction of the Participation Contracts, the onus was
on the contractor to substantiate its claim that a new or increased tax affected the economy of
the Contracts.!'* Notably, Dr. Chiriboga, who was at the time the President of Petroecuador,
testified that the burden was on Perenco to prove to the State that, contrary to its evaluation of
the impact of Law 42, the equilibrium of the Contracts had been modified to such an extent

that it triggered the administrative process provided for therein. is

For its part, the Claimant asserted first, that it had taken sufficient steps to initiate the process
and second, that it received informal signs of a negative reaction from the Ecuadorian
authorities then in office (in mid-December 2006, the Palacios administration was about to
leave office). One of the Claimant’s witnesses, Mr. Laurent Combe, testified that although
Perenco calculated Law 42’s impact on the economy of the Contracts, it did not send the data
because it would be too confrontational. Mr. Combe testified that no further action was taken
in support of the application because the company did not wish to exacerbate relations with the

116

Government. ’ It is common ground that the taxation modification negotiations contemplated

in clause 11 of both Contracts did not take place.

On 4 October 2007, the administration of President Rafael Correa Delgado issued a further
decree, Decree No. 662 (the “Second Implementing Regulation”), which increased the
State’s share of revenue from sales above the reference price from 50% to 99%.'!7 Dr.
Chiriboga, then the Minister of Mines and Petroleum in Ecuador, testified that this percentage
was chosen based on financial analysis undertaken within or on behalf of Ecuadorian state
agencies and discussed in meetings with the President.''*

Thus, from October 2007, as a matter of Ecuadorian law, Perenco was obliged to deliver to
Ecuador, in addition to its contractually agreed participation in volume, an additional
participation in revenue of at least 99% of its income from all sales of oil above the applicable
reference price (which, as noted above in paragraph 96, varied as between Block 7 and Block

21 oil).!”

process during which the information would be formally presented. This was reiterated by the witness in his re-
examination when asked what he expected would follow the letter of 18 December 2006 to Petroecuador:

(3) Payments under Law 42, the initiation of ICSID arbitration, negotiations and Ley de
Equidad Tributaria

Perenco (and its fellow member of the consortium, Burlington) made payments pursuant to the

HCL Amendment from July 2006 through to April 2008.'2°

Shortly after the Second Implementing Regulation adjusted the percentage of “extraordinary
revenue” to 99% in favour of the State, on 17 October 2007, Perenco wrote to the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum notifying Ecuador that it “‘accept[ed]
and [gave] its consent to the offer of Ecuador to submit any dispute related to the [HCL
Amendment], or with any other measure that impacts Perenco’s investments in Ecuador, to the
International Centre Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (“CIADI’) for their

resolution through arbitration according to Article 25 of the [Convention] and Article 9 of the

yl21

Treaty.

The Tribunal notes parenthetically that on this date, the late Hubert Perrodo’s estate in the

Bahamas was un-administered and un-distributed.'”* It will revert to this state of affairs below.

Throughout the period in which Perenco paid the Law 42 duties, it did so on a “without

prejudice” or “bajo protesta” basis. 123

At the same time, it is common ground that Perenco was willing to consider working with the
Government of Ecuador in arriving at a compromise. It wrote to the Ministry of Mines and
Petroleum on 24 October 2007 requesting information regarding the model of the service

agreement the Government was proposing to use as the basis for negotiations moving

forward.'*4 During the hearing, Dr. Chiriboga testified that while Ecuador had by this time
contracted the services of the Mexico office of Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP to
produce a model of the proposed service contract and some drafts were available, they had not
been discussed internally, '° Consequently, Ecuador determined it was not in a position to

accede to Perenco’s request and did not respond to it.'6

On 29 December 2007, Ecuador passed a further law, the Ley de Equidad Tributaria (the

“LET”), an initiative to facilitate new negotiations between the government and oil

127

companies. ~ This law contemplated an alternative to the strict application of Law 42 at 99%

by providing for: a tax rate at 70%, a statutory reference price not fixed by Ecuador but subject
to negotiation on a case-by-case basis, and applicable only to oil companies that also agreed to
enter into “transitory agreements” to transform their existing Participation Contracts into an

agreement more akin to a service contract model, to come into effect from January 2008. 8

In a national address delivered on 23 January 2008, President Correa set out his view as to the
options available to oil companies operating in Ecuador under a Participation Contract, stating
that a company could either pay the State its share of the extraordinary revenue under Law 42,
renegotiate its contract into a service agreement or terminate the contract, with the State

compensating the company for the monetary expense it had incurred thus far pursuant to its

129

participation contract. ~ In connection with the option to renegotiate, the President stated that

a service agreement model “always should have been the preponderant figure in the oil

industry” and that companies had 45 days to come to a renegotiated agreement with the State

or continue paying their dues under Law 42,130

During the course of 2008 the Parties sought to negotiate an alternative model to the existing

Participation Contracts for Blocks 7 and 21.3!

Negotiations between Petroecuador and Perenco (in its capacity as the operator of the
Consortium) began on 21 January 2008 and carried on, albeit fitfully at times, throughout the
balance of the year. 132 According to Mr. Eric d’Argentré, Perenco’s Country Manager in
Ecuador, “[t]hroughout 2008 [Perenco] made repeated attempts to seek compromises that
would be acceptable to all parties”, and he “personally attended many meetings, had phone
conversations, exchanged written correspondence, analyzed various proposals and took other
steps to try to find a deal.”'*? Minister Chiriboga agreed that in 2008 “[i]n general, there was a
good cooperation between the State and Perenco in order to reach an agreement that would
benefit [both]” and stated “[he] met Perenco’s representatives, either individually or jointly

with other companies, to discuss the progress of the negotiations, as often as requested.”!*4

While events unfolded in Ecuador, the heirs to Hubert Perrodo were disputing their respective
entitlements to the estate. On 15 February 2008, Madame Perrodo filed a caveat in the
Supreme Court of the Bahamas to preclude any grant of Letters of Administration being made
in respect of the estate. |

Perenco on behalf of the consortium wrote to the coordinator of Petroecuador’s negotiation team with a “financial
proposal” for the renegotiation of the Block 7 and 21 Contracts (see Exhibit CE-268, Letter from the Consortium
to Petroecuador, | February 2008 (in Spanish with English translation). Mr. Rodrigo Marquez Pacanins, Group
Assistant General Counsel of Perenco Group from 2001 to 2008, testified that Perenco granted a request by
Burlington to be present at the negotiations up till April 2008 because it would “facilitate the negotiation process”,
even though it was understood that it was Perenco which had acted on behalf of the Consortium in the
negotiations: see Transcript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 3, p 717 (Testimony of Rodrigo Marquez).

In March 2008, Petroecuador and Perenco reached a preliminary agreement (the “Acta de
Acuerdo Parcial’) regarding Block 7.'"" This “transitory agreement” provided that: (i) Block 7
would continue to be operated under the participation sharing model for five years before being
migrated to another contract model (more akin to service contract model); (ii) the term of the
Block 7 contract, which was set to expire in 2010, would be extended until 2018; (iii)
Ecuador’s share would be increased for the period 2008 to 2010, and thereafter linked to oil
prices for the period 2010 to 2018; and (iv) the statutory reference price would be increased to

US $42.5/bbl (from US $ 25.111383 as of 6 July 2006).'**

Thereafter, the Consortium wrote to Petroecuador setting out its proposals for Blocks 7 and 21
on 11 March 2008 and 25 March 2008, respectively, and it appears that the parties were
relatively close to reaching a mutually acceptable agreement on making a transition to a new
contractual model." The benefit to Perenco (when compared to the status quo) was clear in
that it would have another eight years to exploit Block 7 and the revenue sharing obligation

would be triggered at a higher reference price. 140

However, on 12 April 2008, President Correa announced that all existing production-sharing
agreements were to be terminated within the year and new contracts would be employed, the

form and particulars of which were unspecified. '4! Contractors were informed that it would be

. 142
a common service contract model.

This was an abrupt and unexpected change in the negotiating circumstances. Mr. d’ Argentré
testified that that “after months of what [was] thought were productive negotiations, this

sig 9143
announcement was very surprising. M4

An article in the Ecuadorian newspaper El Comercio,
dated 13 April 2008, entitled, “Negotiations with oil companies come to a halt”, reported that
“[nJegotiations with oil companies were suspended by a decision from the President” and
“Te]ven though the Head of State had given a term of 45 days for negotiations to conclude”
“Ta]t the last minute, he decided that new contracts would not be signed.” 4 A quote from a
radio address by President Correa in an article in the online edition of Ecuador’s El Diario,
dated 14 April 2008, entitled “Correa proposes ‘single model’ for contracts with foreign oil
companies” quoted the President as to the reasoning behind his decision to suspend
negotiations:
“T said 45 days, I think in January, for renegotiation of contracts...We were close

to a deal, but I stopped it, because, even though we’ve secured major benefits, I
think that we can do better.” '*

By letter dated 15 April 2008, Perenco notified Ecuador that it would continue to make
payments under protest in compliance with Law 42 for March 2008, and expressed its “deep
concern derived from the Ecuadorian Government’s announcement to put an end to the current
negotiations.” “° In another letter of the same date, Perenco wrote to the Minister of Mines and

Petroleum expressing surprise at the President’s announcement that Ecuador had decided to

Petroleum did not respond to this letter. 48

Two weeks later, on 30 April 2008, the Board of Directors of Perenco S.A. authorised the
filing of a Request for Arbitration with ICSID against Ecuador and Petroecuador. 9 The

request was filed on that same day with the ICSID Secretary-General.

In the face of this, Ecuador proposed a ‘transitional agreement’ on 16 May 2008, which it
requested Perenco sign as a pre-condition to further negotiations. The agreement included a
term obliging Petroecuador and its counterparty to “take best efforts so that, within a period of
120 days, they can sign the new Service Agreement for Exploration and Exploitation of
Hydrocarbons, and as a show of good faith, the Contractor will suspend its proceedings before
ICSID.”!*° This was followed by a letter from the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum, dated 13
June 2008, in which it stated that all oil companies were to sign amended agreements with the
State which would include a commitment to migrate to a service provision agreement within
one year.'*! Perenco refused to do so.!>? Dr. Chiriboga testified that, at this time, the draft

proposed “service contract” had not as yet been provided to contractors. 153

Perenco replied to the Minister of Mines and Petroleum and the Executive President of
Petroecuador on 19 June 2008, referring to the ICSID arbitration it had initiated and continued
calls for payments under Law 42 from the State, and proposing a discussion between parties on

the “possibility of a mutually agreeable solution regarding disputed Law 42 payments that

tribunal (the Decision on Revocation of Provisional Measures and other Procedural Matters in

City Oriente Ltd v. Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petroleos del Ecuador

(Petroecuador)),'*> in which that tribunal had ordered Ecuador to refrain from asserting Law

42 payment demands during the pendency of the arbitration. Perenco proposed the option of
transferring the disputed Law 42 payments into an escrow account, maintained by an

independent escrow agent in a neutral location, pending the resolution of its dispute with

156

Ecuador. ~ This proposal was not accepted by Ecuador and for the balance of 2008 (and into

2009) the Consortium deposited the disputed Law 42 amounts into a segregated account

located outside of Ecuador.'*”

The question of disputed Law 42 payments aside, Perenco continued to request negotiations
with Ecuador. On 26 June 2008, Perenco wrote to the Minister of Mines and Petroleum
requesting the timetable for new negotiations as well as information pertaining to the terms of
the new service contracts proposed by Ecuador.'** On 16 July 2008, Mr. d’Argentré, writing
on behalf of Perenco, and Mr. Alex Martinez, vice-president of Burlington, informed the
Ministry of Mines and Petroleum and Petroecuador that Perenco and Burlington considered

they had no choice but to reject the proposal to enter into the proposed “transitory

agreement”. 9 They continued to request that Ecuador engage in a negotiation towards a

compromise acceptable to both Ecuador and the Consortium. 160

Twelve days later, on 28 July 2008, the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum informed Perenco

that negotiations had and would remain terminated.'*!

On 4 August 2008, Perenco wrote to the Minister of Mines and Petroleum requesting a meeting
to clarify the situation and urging the resumption of negotiations. 102 A meeting was
subsequently held between Mr. d’Argentré and Minister Chiriboga and both agreed that
negotiations could resume, though they disagreed as to the pre-conditions for that to oceur.'%
Mr. d’Argentré testified that after President Correa’s speech in April 2008, the negotiations
urged by Perenco were in its own name and not on behalf of the Consortium. ‘64 Burlington did
not take part in subsequent negotiations, and Mr. d’Argentré testified that he did not

communicate with Burlington about Perenco’s negotiations with Ecuador.'®

On 14 August 2008, Perenco wrote to Minister Chiriboga, confirming the decision to
recommence negotiations, and again requesting a draft of the new contracts that were being

prepared by Ecuador. 166

In its reply of 18 August 2008, the Ministry informed the Consortium that it would not
recommence negotiations unless the Consortium agreed to convert its Participation Contracts

to service contracts and withdrew its claims in this arbitration.'®”

Around this time, Burlington expressed its desire to divest itself of its assets in Ecuador to

Perenco, stating that it had no intention of signing another contract with the State. °° This

September 2008, and reiterated in a letter from Burlington to Petroecuador’s Executive
President on 7 October 2008.'® Perenco however responded to Ecuador’s terms of negotiation
in its own letter of 27 August 2008, stating that it was prepared to begin negotiations on 1
September 2008 with a view to replacing the Participation Contracts with service contracts and
with the issue of the pendency of the ICSID arbitration on the agenda for discussion. 170

In September 2008, Petroecuador informed Perenco that a resolution had been adopted by the
Special Committee for Bidding to form a negotiating team to renegotiate the Participation

Contracts for Blocks 7 and 21.'7!

Negotiations between Perenco and Ecuador resumed in October 2008, with Perenco stating
that it was prepared to agree in principle to migrate to a service contract, the application of the

Ley de Equidad Tributaria tax at 70% and a higher statutory reference price in relation to

Blocks 7 and 21 (US $42.5/bbl for Block 7 and US $48/bbl for Block 21).'”

This led to the Parties agreeing on a draft transitory agreement for Block 7 in the form of a

the Partial Agreement on 3 October 2008 and 17 October 2008 (for Blocks 7 and 21,

respectively). 180

The discussions between Burlington and Ecuador had failed to lead to an agreement over the

divestiture of the former’s interest in Blocks 7 and 21 and the breakdown in that relationship

affected the relationship between Ecuador and Perenco. 81

In a letter dated 16 December 2008, Burlington referred to a conference call with Perenco on

10 December 2008 where Perenco “describe[d] the benefits of signing the draft agreement.” !*

Burlington informed Perenco that it “weigh[ed] the risks of signing the transitory agreement

quite differently from Perenco” and it refused to sign the proposed draft transitory

agreements. '83 Tn addition, Burlington stated that it was “not under any legal obligation of any

kind to sign the draft agreements” and “if, nevertheless, Perenco decide[d] to pursue the
execution of transitory agreements, Burlington hereby reserves all rights and remedies under
applicable law, without prejudice, to protect its interests in the PSCs.” '84 Mr. d@’Argentré
testified that, to his knowledge, Burlington had by this time made this position clear to the
Government of Ecuador as well. '*°

On 24 December 2008, Perenco received a letter from the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum

stating that:

After the negotiation process carried out with the PETROECUADOR team, the
conversations held in this Office with your Principal and, as a result of the
impossibility of arriving at a final agreement between the parties, due to the
intransigent position of your partner Burlington Resources, I would be very
grateful if you would immediately instruct your work team to initiate the process
of reversion of Block 7, the contract for which ends in the year 2010.

Moreover, PERENCO, in its capacity as Operator, must also immediately assign
its negotiating team to early termination of the Block 21 contract, by mutual
agreement. '*°

This led Perenco to write to the Minister of Mines and Petroleum to request him to reconsider
the position expressed in the letter of 24 December 2008. '87 However, on 21 January 2009, the
Minister of Mines and Petroleum announced that the negotiations to have Perenco continue
operating in Ecuador had become “practically impossible”.'**

The present arbitration, which had been initiated on 30 April 2008, thereafter proceeded in
earnest. The First Session of the Tribunal was held on 7 February 2009 at the seat of the Centre
in Washington D.C. At this session, the Claimant did not pursue its application for provisional
measures which it had included with its Amended Request for Arbitration dated 30 April
2008.'°

One week after the First Session of the Tribunal, in a radio address on 14 February 2009,
President Correa declared that he had ordered enforcement actions against two companies,
Repsol and Perenco, because they failed to pay their dues pursuant to Law 42. He challenged
what he described as their “defiance”, and commented on the impact that the State’s actions

might have on Ecuador’s relationship with the governments of France and Spain:

But two companies, Perenco and Repsol, with which Burlington is also allied,
have wasted our time. Agreements were reached, and then backed out of. I
believe, I fear, that they thought they were still dealing with previous
administrations. Gentlemen, we will not permit that. This is going to create
friction with the governments of France and Spain, which are very protective of
their transnational corporations, and for this we are sorry. We like these
governments and hold them in high esteem, but on this subject we must observe
our national sovereignty and our national interests. '””

During this proceeding, the Claimant has adverted to statements by senior Ecuadorian officials,
including President Correa’s description of the Claimant as a French transnational corporation

just quoted.

A Reuters article of the same date quoted Minister Derlis Palacios as having stated that both
companies “will ‘either pay the debt or their stuff will be seized’.”'°' This was a reference to

the coactiva proceedings that were then initiated against both members of the Consortium.

Coactiva proceedings, the Tribunal’s Decision on Provisional Measures, intervention in
the Blocks and declaration of Caducidad

(LD) Coactiva proceedings

Article 21 of the Special Law of the Empresa Estatal Petréleos del Ecuador (Petroecuador
os 192

and its Subsidiaries) empowers Petroecuador to exercise a “coactiva jurisdiction.
Petroecuador, acting as a “Court of Enforcement”, is empowered to employ a wide range of
enforcement measures, including seizures, attachments, liens, and prohibitions against transfer
or assignment of property, in order to collect on a debt owing in accordance with the forcible

enforcement provisions contained in the Code of Civil Procedure of Ecuador. 198

By letter of 18 February 2009, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that the President and the
Minister of Mines and Petroleum “have had no other alternative but to announce — in strict
compliance with International Law, the Constitution, the laws and decrees of Ecuador — that a
‘coercive procedure’ will be promptly initiated — the result of which can be challenged before
the Ecuadorian civil courts — against Perenco to demand that it pay the amounts it still owes

pursuant to the obligations arising out of the application of Law 2006-42 and its regulatory

decrees.”!*

Perenco by letter of 19 February 2009 requested the Minister of Mines and Petroleum to

However, on that same day, Ecuador commenced the coactivas against Perenco (and

Claimant, until it has had an opportunity to further hear from the parties on the question of

provisional measures.”*”° The Tribunal proposed a possible hearing date of 19 March 2009.7!

Ecuador responded to the Tribunal on 26 February 2009, stating it could not comply with the

Tribunal’s request.” Throughout this proceeding Ecuador characterised the Tribunals letter as

recommending a course of action, and not imposing upon it an obligation to comply.

Meanwhile, on that same day, the Minister of Mines and Petroleum set a deadline for Perenco

to pay the claimed US $327 million debt by 2 March 2009.7

The Tribunal responded to the Respondent’s statement of its position on 27 February 2009,
stating it “regrets the stance adopted by the Respondent Republic of Ecuador and must

nullification of the forcible collection notices on the ground that the Tribunal had exclusive

jurisdiction over the dispute surrounding the application of Law 42 to the Participation

Ecuador proceeded with the enforcement measures. On 3 March 2009, Perenco’s personnel at
its facilities in Quito received two notices from the Court of Enforcement of Petroecuador. The

Court ordered the immediate seizure of all of Blocks 7 and 21’s crude production and

cargoes.”” The Court notified OCP on 4 March 2009 of the seizure of all of Block 21’s crude

oil and provided instructions for the retention of the crude until the Law 42 debt was
208

collected.
Also on 3 March 2009, the Minister of Mines and Petroleum, Mr. Derlis Palacios, was
interviewed on Ecuadorian television. In response to questions regarding the proposed actions
that the State could take against Perenco and the reasons why Perenco had failed to pay its Law
42 debt thus far, the Minister stated that the deadline to pay was 2 March 2009, and the State
was “completing all necessary steps to adopt that measure (i.e. coactiva) as soon as

possible.”?”

He stated further that he had met with Perenco’s country manager in order to try
to find a solution and he had concluded that the main resistance faced by Perenco was as a
result of its American partner, Burlington. In the course of this interview, as in the case of the
President of Ecuador’s earlier description of the Claimant as a “French” company, Minister
Palacios described Perenco in like terms. He went on to emphasise that “we are neither

confiscating nor terminating the contract.”7!°

. Around this time, the 2" First Instance Civil Court in Ecuador dismissed Perenco’s application

to nullify the coactivas.*"!

On 4 March 2009, Perenco informed its buyers, Shell West and ConocoPhillips, of an event of

. . . 212
force majeure under their contracts.

The Tribunal responded to the actions taken by the Court of Enforcement of Petroecuador by
way of letter to the Parties on 5 March 2009. Referring to its 24 February 2009 letter, the
Tribunal stated it “wishe[d] to make clear, in view of the parties’ most recent exchange of
correspondence, that its 24 February 2009 request had and continues to have the same

authority as a recommendation, as envisaged in Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID

Arbitration Rule 39”? It additionally confirmed the date for a hearing on the application for

provisional measures, namely, 19 March 2009, at the World Bank’s offices in Paris.?!4

On 6 March 2009, Perenco applied to the 2" First Instance Civil Court of Pichincha in
Ecuador to reconsider the dismissal of its application regarding the collection notices.” Its
application was dismissed on 9 March 2009.7! Appeals against this decision were later

dismissed, with the 2" First Instance Civil Court stating that Perenco could appeal no further

due to the failure to comply with the 3 March 2009 collection notices.7!”

On 11 March 2009, counsel for the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal, explaining that it did so
“not to cavil with the Tribunal’s decision, but to formally record the Republic of Ecuador’s
reservation of rights in relation to it.”?'* It set out a number of reasons why it considered the
Tribunal’s decision to “retrospectively change the form of [Tribunal’s] request” of 24 February

2009 was prejudicial to Ecuador’s rights in the arbitration, which were reserved.”?

While in the midst of the hearing on provisional measures, the Claimant received from the
Ministry of Mines and Petroleum a notice stating that the State had recalculated the amounts
due from the Consortium under Law 42 for the period 25 April 2006 to 31 December 2008
(including interest), and it now was said to owe US $719,087,992 (of which, in the Claimant’s
submission, Perenco was said to allegedly owe US $359,000,000).7”° This included interest of
US $17,773,608 from 24 August 2006 to 19 March 2009.””!

(2) Auction of Consortium crude and the Tribunal’s Decision on Provisional Measures

On 6 April 2009, the Court of Enforcement in Ecuador issued an order stating that
Petroecuador would begin selling the Consortium’s crude at an auction to be held on 15 May
2009.°”? The winning bidder was to pay Petroecuador by means of a direct deposit in an
account it held in the Central Bank of Ecuador.?? A public announcement advertising the

auction was published in E/ Comercio.4

While events unfolded in Ecuador, on 16 April 2009, Bahamian legal counsel Ms. Heather
Thomson was instructed, pursuant to powers of attorney granted to her by the Perrodo heirs, to
apply to the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas for Letters of
Administration in respect of the Perrodo estate in the Bahamas. (The Letters of Administration
were later issued on 19 August 2009.7*5)

On 8 May 2009, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Provisional Measures recommending that
Ecuador refrain from demanding that Perenco pay amounts allegedly due pursuant to Law 42,
instituting or further pursuing any action, judicial or otherwise, to collect from Perenco any
payments owed by Perenco or the Consortium pursuant to Law 42, instituting or further
pursuing any action, judicial or otherwise, against Perenco or any of its offices or employees
arising from or in connection with the Participation Contracts and unilaterally amending,

rescinding, terminating or repudiating the Participation Contraets.””°

The Tribunal also found in its Decision that the Respondents should enjoy a measure of
security in relation to sums accruing to them from Perenco (not the Consortium) under Law 42
from the date of the Decision until any later decision that might find that the Tribunal had no
jurisdiction to entertain the dispute, or that the Respondents were entitled to claim and enforce

the payments required by the Law. It considered that such security was best provided by

payment of the sums so accruing into an escrow account, from which sums would be disbursed
on the direction of the Tribunal or by agreement of the Parties and it invited the parties to agree
the terms and conditions on which such account may be established, and to establish it within
120 days from the issuance of the Decision. If, at the end of that period, the Parties failed to
agree or act, either party was at liberty to revert to the Tribunal.”””

On 11 May 2009, Mr. d’Argentré wrote to the Minister of Mines and Petroleum in Ecuador,
Mr. Derlis Palacios, and the President of Petroecuador, Rear-Admiral Luis Jaramillo, noting
that the Tribunal had invited the Parties to “work jointly to coordinate the creation of an
escrow account to deposit the disputed sums generated” from the date of the Decision, and in
relation to the proposed auction of the oil that had been seized pursuant to the coactivas, that
Perenco was open to starting “discussions immediately as to what would be the most efficient
way to restore Perenco’s title to the crude oil now under attachment.””"* He concluded by
stating that while Perenco “will continue defending [its] rights in the arbitration, [it] remain[s]
willing to talk in order to reach an amicable solution to our dispute on terms that will find
acceptance with all parties.”?”°

According to Mr. d’ Argentré, shortly after the letter of 11 May 2009 was sent, representatives
of Perenco met with Minister Palacios. Mr. d’Argentré testified that the “meeting was not
productive” because it “quickly became clear to [him] that the Tribunal’s Decision did not
have much of an impact on Minister Palacios or his colleagues” who informed Mr. d’Argentré
and his colleagues that “the seizure of [the Consortium’s] crude was non-negotiable and ... the
auction would have to go forward.” 230 Minister Palacios is alleged to have advised Mr.
d’Argentré and his colleagues at this meeting that if he or “any other Perenco personnel tried to

interfere with the auction, [they] would face criminal charges.”?*!

Perenco then sought a meeting with the Attorney-General of Ecuador, Mr. Diego Garcia
Carrién. The Attorney-General, according to Mr. d’Argentré, maintained in this meeting that
he was not in a position to intercede in the dispute, suggesting that Perenco focus its efforts on

communicating with Minister Palacios and Rear-Admiral Jaramillo.”

Perenco’s representatives (Mr. d’Argentré and Ms. Gabriela Rumazo, Perenco’s then-legal
counsel in Ecuador) then met with Mr. Alexis Mera, Legal Counsel to President Correa, on 14
May 2009 at the Presidential Palace. Mr. d’Argentré testified that they related to Mr. Mera the
chronology of events and the detrimental impact of the HCL Amendment and the events
following it on Perenco’s operations in Ecuador.” Mr. Mera, according to Mr. d’Argentré, is
said to have responded to the suggestion that Ecuador “consider cancelling the auctions as a
good faith gesture” so that negotiations could proceed as follows: “Ecuador did not intend to
comply with the Tribunal’s provisional measures orders and that the auction would go forward

regardless.”?*4

Perenco then wrote to Mr. Patricio Uteras Hidalgo, the Judge who ordered the seizure of
Perenco’s crude on 14 May 2009, and to Mr. Wong Loon, President of OCP Ecuador S.A., on
15 May 2009. Perenco referred to the Tribunal’s order of 8 May 2009, describing it as having
resulted in an international obligation upon Ecuador and its state agencies to refrain from
“further seizing and auctioning Block 7 and Block 21 crude oil, and entitles Perenco to full,

effective and immediate control of such crude oil.”**

On 15 May 2009, Ecuador proceeded as scheduled with its auction of the seized crude oil.
Approximately 720,000 barrels of Napo crude and 720,000 barrels of Oriente crude seized

236

from the Blocks were to be sold.” No buyers attended the auction.”*”

On that same day, counsel for the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal, addressing the

relationship between the Tribunal’s Decision on Provisional Measures and the auction:

Ecuador has the highest respect for this learned Tribunal, and has carefully
considered the recommendations set forth in the Decision. Ecuador wishes to
inform the Tribunal, however, that it is not in a position to implement certain of
the recommendations at this time, in so far as they would restrain Ecuador from
enforcing Law 42 against Perenco or the Consortium of which it is a member.

Law 42 and its implementing Decrees (referred to herein collectively as ‘Law
42’) were enacted at the highest levels of government, and have been upheld by
the Ecuadorian Constitutional Court. Under the circumstances, Law 42 must be
applied and enforced, lest the integrity of the legal order be undermined. Were
any public officials to refuse to do so in relation to Perenco or the Consortium,
they would face serious sanctions for failing to carry out their duties,
notwithstanding the Decision.

Nevertheless, Ecuador is committed to furthering the central goal of the Decision,
namely to avoid any actions that would undermine the effectiveness of any
potential award that might be issued (should the Tribunal ultimately affirm its
jurisdiction and proceed to the merits). To that end, Ecuador intends to carry out
the enforcement of Law 42 in such a way as to avoid any disruption of Perenco’s
business. In particular, Ecuador does not intend to seize any assets of the
Consortium beyond oil equivalent in value to the outstanding debt. Nor does
Ecuador intend to terminate the relevant Participation Contracts, or take legal
action against Perenco representatives.”**

Counsel for the Claimant responded to Ecuador’s letter on 19 May 2009.7” Referring to what
it described as Ecuador’s “disrespect” and “disregard” of the Decision on Provisional
Measures, it stated this reflected “in words a policy Respondents have in recent days also
communicated through deeds, including service of additional Law 42 assessment notices,
convening an auction to sell seized crude oil (which failed when no buyers bid) and failing to

respond to Perenco’s overture to discuss the Tribunal directed escrow arrangement.”™"”

Perenco referred to Ecuador’s statement that it intended to carry out the enforcement of Law

42 in such a way as to avoid disruption of Perenco’s business by stating “Perenco simply

doing so. 41

(3) Efforts to compromise and proposed settlement offer

On 21 May 2009, Perenco submitted to Ecuador a proposed settlement offer that, according to
Mr. d’Argentré, “include[d] terms which had seemed amenable to Ecuador during past

22 The terms of this proposal was that Ecuador would receive 70% above the

negotiations.
applicable reference price (US $42.50 per barrel for Block 7 and US $48.00 for Block 21),
would retain all the payments made till May 2009 in respect of Law 42, in addition receiving a
fixed amount of US $2,725,000 monthly for a period of 6 months and a variable amount equal
to the total barrels of crude produced each month by both blocks (not counting the State’s
participation in barrels) multiplied by US $5.00, and in exchange the term of the participation
contract for Block 7 would be extended to June 2021 and the contracts’ terms to otherwise

. : 2.
remain the same in all other respects."

It appears that representatives of the Government of Ecuador considered this offer
provocative.”* A week after submitting its proposal, Mr. d’Argentré and Ms. Rumazo were
summoned to Minister Palacios’ office, who, according to Mr. d'Argentré, stated that President
Correa was offended by the settlement offer, that Ecuador refused to comply with the
Tribunal’s decision and Perenco had one week to submit a revised proposal or be expelled

from the country.745

In his second witness statement, Mr. Derlis Palacios refers to this meeting with Perenco in late

May 2009.“° He testified that during the meeting he discussed the proposal Ecuador had

p 4. In exchange, the State would agree not to “present any demand related to Law 42 or any similar demand
during the duration of the Participation Contracts for Block 7 and 21”, and would refund to Perenco the 1.44
million barrels which were the subject of the first auction for the Consortium “to sell and distribute the income
from the sale “according to the terms of the Participation Contracts.” If the terms were met, the Claimant
undertook to “stipulate that the arbitration proceedings before the ICSID [would be] suspended.”

received and which he considered “was not serious.” “’ Mr. Palacios characterised the
proposed offer as “a clear provocation.”?** He added that, in his opinion, the proposal was an
attempt by Perenco to seek “confrontation in order to make use of any reaction by the State in
this arbitration.”*”?

Following this meeting, the Claimant wrote to Minister Palacios, stressing that it did not intend
to offend him or the Government of Ecuador, and explaining that it had presented the proposal
only with the intention of putting a “quick end to the controversy that has divided us.”
Perenco stated that if the offer was not to the satisfaction of Ecuador, the Parties should
alternatively proceed with the option of depositing disputed sums of Law 42 debts into an
escrow account and “return to normal operations” while the arbitration continued. 251

Addressing the threat of expulsion, Mr. d’ Argentré stated:

If, as you indicated to me on Monday at our meeting, Ecuador decides in any
event to expel Perenco and Burlington from the country, we realize that there is
nothing that we can do to stop you. If that is the road that Ecuador chooses then
we suggest a meeting at least to discuss the technical means for us to hand over
operations in a safe, orderly way over a reasonable period of time.”

Mr. Wong Loon, President of OCP Ecuador S.A., responded to Perenco’s letter on 26 May
2009. Mr. Wong Loon stated that upon Perenco’s request it had sought to clarify with the
Enforcement Court of Petroecuador “if the Orden de Embargo was valid and outstanding” in
light of the Tribunal’s decision. He stated further that “[t]he Enforcement Court of
Petroecuador through notice dated 21 May 2009 and served to OCP Ecuador S.A. on 25 May
2009 ... has responded to OCP Ecuador S.A. that the Orden de Embargo issued on 3 March

continuing “Force Majeure Event caused by a Political Event [which] occurred on March 3,

2009.”254

On 26 May 2009, Ecuador’s Minister of Foreign Relations, Trade and Integration, Mr. Fander

Falconi, spoke to the French Ambassador to Ecuador, Mr. Didier Lopinot, regarding the

“differences that exist between [Perenco] and the Ecuadorian State.”

The following day, Ambassador Lopinot wrote to Minister Falconi (copying Minister
Palacios), informing him that the French authorities intended to “organize a meeting in the next

few days with the President” of Perenco, and requesting Ecuador to “postpone all measures

Minister Palacios then responded to Perenco’s letters of 21 May 2009 and 26 May 2009 on 1
June 2009, rejecting its proposed offer for a number of reasons, primarily that it would seem to
detract from the binding and non-negotiable nature of the terms of Law 42, and that Perenco

could not guarantee the agreement of its fellow consortium member, Burlington.?” He did

however state that the “Ecuadorean State is open to discussing...an agreement.”

On 2 June 2009, Petroecuador issued a notice regarding the planned auction of Perenco’s crude

On 5 June 2009, the French Secretary of State in Charge of Foreign Trade, Mme Anne-Marie
Idrac, wrote to Minister Palacios to express her “concern in relation to the recent developments
surrounding the dispute between your government and French company Perenco[.]” 260
Minister Idrac stated that “it [stood] to the mutual best interest of both our countries that a
French company like Perenco, which invests considerable sums every year in this industry and
hires several hundred employees in your country, should enjoy operational conditions that are

economically viable.”?°!

(4) Second attempt at an auction and the declaration of Caducidad

On 8 June 2009, Mr. Germanico Pinto replaced Minister Derlis Palacios as Minister of Mines

and Petroleum.”

Thereafter, in a 14 June 2009 article in a local news service in Quito, the
new minister was quoted in an interview with state-run channel Ecuadortv as stating that:
“Perenco is challenging an Ecuadorean law and is taking this challenge to an arbitrator, a third
party, and that is unacceptable.”?%

On 25 June 2009, Mr. d’Argentré and Perenco’s Regional Manager for Latin America, Mr.
Rodrigo Marquez, met with Minister Pinto to discuss settlement terms. According to Mr.
d’Argentré, Minister Pinto maintained Ecuador’s position that in order to cease the coactivas,
the Consortium would have to agree to pay all outstanding Law 42 amounts under a payment

plan (amongst other conditions.” Perenco did not agree to this.?°

Mr. Marquez then wrote to Minister Pinto on 2 July 2009, referring to the 25 June 2009

meeting and the terms communicated to Perenco. Mr. Marquez stated that Perenco was not in a

position to offer to “pay off the amounts in dispute as a condition for lifting the enforcement

measure and suspending the auction”~””, adding that:

“... the most prudent thing would be to suspend the auction of crude oil from

Blocks 7 and 21, scheduled for July 3", and to lift the enforcement measures, in

compliance with stipulations of the decisions regarding the injunctions. That way,

we would be able to return to relative operational normality at Blocks 7 and 21,

and minimal conditions would be created to facilitate a dialogue and the

possibility of a negotiated resolution to this conflict.”7°”
Mr. Marquez reaffirmed that Perenco was desirous to continue “pursuing and making room for
dialogue.”?°*

Petroecuador proceeded with the auction of the Consortium’s crude on 3 July 2009. The
Respondent maintains that Perenco threatened legal action against any company who stepped

forward to submit a bid in the auction of its oil.

A press release by Perenco on 3 July 2009
quotes a statement by Mr. Marquez, the Latin American Regional Manager of the Perenco
Group, that “[a]nyone who purchases the seized crude oil under the circumstances is buying
property that Ecuador and Petroecuador are not entitled to sell...[c]onsequently, anyone who
buys at the Government auction may be liable for conversion or other misdeeds” and “‘Perenco
is prepared to enforce its rights wherever it becomes necessary to do so.”?7° Mr. d@’Argentré
testified that this was not intended as a threat, and attributed the subsequent lack of external
bidders at the auction to the fact that “buyers were aware of the situation and that the crude
belonging to Perenco seized was under [sic] Provisional Measures from the Tribunal.”?”!
Under cross-examination, however, Mr. d’Argentré acknowledged that the press release may
have been treated as a threat by potential buyers, or at the least “inform[ing] all buyers that [it]
would — [it] could take legal action against them.”?” Since there were no bidders, Petroecuador

purchased the full volume of oil offered at a 50% discount to the market price, thereafter

The Consortium responded to the auction by beginning to plan to suspend operations in the

Blocks.””*

On 30 June 2009, the Consortium prepared a suspension plan for Blocks 7 and 21.2 The
suspension plan, in the words of Mr. d’Argentré, would take two to three weeks to be

feel that this was unexpected because of Perenco’s familiarity with the conditions of each well

and reservoir in Blocks 7 and 21.78!

Minister Pinto responded by letter of 15 July 2009, stating that “in response to [Perenco’s]
astounding threat to suspend [its] oil operations in Ecuador, we must warn you that an illegal
and unilateral decision of this nature would cause serious technical and monetary damage to
the Republic of Ecuador” and “the public authorities of the Ecuadorian Government reserve all
their rights, which may include bringing action before the competent forum to seek payment of
damages.”*? He stated that Ecuador remained open to receiving a bona fide proposal on the
payment of the Consortium’s Law 42 debt.?°

In addition, by letter of the same date, the Hydrocarbons Directorate in Ecuador wrote to the
Consortium, informing it that it had not received any notice for suspension of its operations, as
required by Ecuadorian law.°** Such notice was supplied to the Directorate the following
day.25

On 16 July 2009, Mr. d’Argentré initiated procedures for the suspension of operations in the
respective blocks.”*” This was done pursuant to a Technical Action Plan produced by Perenco

and Burlington. 288

Ecuador took control of the Blocks on that same day.” Ecuador maintains the position that its
intervention in the Blocks, including its subsequent declaration of caducidad, was necessary in
order to avoid “irreparable damage to hydrocarbons because these are strategic resources.”?””
Moreover, Ecuador alleges that Perenco abandoned the Blocks having performed the

“necessary calculations” leading it to conclude it “was bes

 

to adopt a strategy of self-

expropriation.””*!

Agence France Presse reported on 20 July 2009 that “France warn[s] Ecuador on Monday that

its decision to take control of two oil concessions operated by French oil group Perenco could

jeopardise foreign investment in the country.”?”

Petroecuador, in a statement from its Executive President Rear-Admiral Luis Jaramillo,
informed Perenco’s employees that the government intended to continue with normal
operations in Blocks 7 and 21.7% For this purpose, Petroecuador passed a resolution on 16 July
2009, authorised by Rear-Admiral Jaramillo, characterising the suspension as an “emergency
situation” and accordingly granting to itself the authority to, through Petroamazonas, “take all
action of an administrative, technical, operational, economic and legal nature as is necessary,

up to and including the direct engagement of goods and services to overcome this emergency

so as to allow the normal performance of production activities in Blocks 7 and 21.724

Perenco and Burlington jointly protested the takeover by letter dated 17 July 2009 to Minister
Pinto and Rear-Admiral Jaramillo, asserting that the actions of the Government of Ecuador and
Petroecuador constituted “an unlawful confiscation of the Consortium’s property and violation
of the Consortium’s fundamental rights of ownership of this property.” 5 Perenco and
Burlington demanded the “immediate payment by Ecuador of fair and adequate
compensation.”?"°

According to Mr. d’Argentré, once it “became clear that Perenco would not be resuming
control of the Consortium’s operations in the near future, [he] began to notify [Perenco’s]
services providers, vendors, employees and local community leaders that Perenco would be
terminating its contractual obligations on grounds of force majeure arising from the
Government's takeover of the Blocks.”?””

On 20 July 2009, Petroecuador issued a notice of the planned auction of Perenco’s crude oil on

26 August 2009.7°8

On the following day, Ecuador wrote to Perenco stating that it had abandoned the blocks and

had thus left the State with no option but to assume operational responsibilities.°”° Perenco

denied that this was the case in a letter dated 23 July 2009.5

Also on 23 July 2009, Minister Pinto stated that the production of oil fields in Blocks 7 and 21
were in “perfect condition” after the Ecuadorian State had assumed control over its

operations.*”!

acts constituted an expropriation of their investments in Ecuador, and that the suspension of

operations was intended to mitigate their losses in accordance with law.2°

SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES’ CLAIMS AND RELIEFS
Jurisdiction

(1) Whether Perenco is a company ‘controlled by’ French nationals within the meaning
of Article 1(3)(ii) of the Treaty
Article 1(3) of the Treaty defines “companies” which have standing to claim under the Treaty
as:

(i) Any body corporate constituted in the territory of either Contracting Party in accordance
with its legislation and having its registered office there,

(ii) Any body corporate controlled by nationals of one Contracting Party or by bodies
corporate having their registered office in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties
and constituted in accordance with that Party’s legislation. ***

Perenco submitted that it was at all relevant times controlled by French nationals. Thus, it is a
French company for the purposes of the Treaty and consequently has the requisite standing to

bring a claim regarding alleged breaches of the Treaty by the Respondent.*”

Ecuador submitted that Perenco bears the burden of establishing this Tribunal’s jurisdiction
ratione personae pursuant to the ICSID Convention and the Treaty, and has failed to do so.31°
It stressed that, to succeed, Perenco had to prove that it was directly controlled by Mr. Hubert
Perrodo’s heirs on both the date on which consent to arbitration is purported to be effected (17
October 2007) as well as on the date on which the Request for Arbitration was registered by
the Centre (4 June 2008). 311 ft contended that on each of those dates Perenco was not

controlled by the heirs of the late Mr. Perrodo within the meaning of Article 1(3)Gi).3

Ecuador’s argument in this regard was two-fold.

First, Ecuador asserted that the Treaty required legal control and that at the relevant dates, no

Perrodo heir had the legal capacity to control the ultimate parent company of Perenco Ecuador

Exhibit CE-7, Treaty, PER 00520 [Emphasis added.].

Amended Request, paragraph 14. Exhibit CE-6 to the Amended Request identifies Hubert Perrodo on the register
of members of Perenco Gabon S.A. (formerly, Perenco S.A. and the sole shareholder in Perenco), holding 90,498
shares.

Limited, namely, PIL.*! This was because the shares in that company were not transferred to
Mr. Perrodo’s heirs in accordance with Bahamian law until 22 December 2011, well after the

two dates previously noted.*!4

Ecuador asserted further that the relevant test was whether the heirs individually or collectively
had the legal capacity to control Perenco on the relevant dates, particularly the critical date of
17 October 2007 (the date on which consent to ICSID arbitration was purported to be
given). 3!5 Bouador argued that they did not and that Mr. Perrodo died intestate, and
consequently, after his death on 29 December 2006, his estate, consisting of his shares in PIL,
was left un-administered until 19 August 2009 when letters of administration were formally
granted by the Bahamian courts.*!® On the basis that Bahamian law, not French law, governs
the transmission of shares, the Perrodo heirs had, at best, an equitable interest in the shares in
PIL until such time as they were legally registered as owners of the shares. This could only be
achieved after the letters of administration had been granted.*!”

Pending such registration and transfer of shares, the Articles of Association of Perenco did not
permit the heirs of the late Mr. Perrodo to exercise any rights in relation to the corporate
governance of PIL, including voting. Accordingly, on 17 October 2007, no Perrodo, let alone
Francois Perrodo, was vested with the legal capacity to control PIL (and, through that parent
company, Perenco Ecuador Limited).°"*
Perenco challenged this position as legally and factually incorrect. It cited several cases which
in its submission demonstrate the flexible approach taken by tribunals and which emphasise
that different criterion may be employed to find control, this not necessarily limited to legal

capacity to control.*! It argued that the undisputed facts establish that the Perrodo family

which provides that “the executor or administrator of a deceased member, the guardian of an incompetent
member or the trustee of a bankrupt member shall be the only person recognised by the Company as having any
title to its share” [Emphasis added.]. See also, Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 42-98.

controlled Perenco in every way significant for the purposes of the term “controlled” under
Article 1(3)(ii) of the Treaty. 320 TE argued that this control was manifested in formal and
informal means.*?! The Perrodo family was in fact in control of the Perenco Group both when
Hubert Perrodo was alive and after his death.*77 Moreover, at the date of consent to arbitration,
the Perrodo heirs collectively owned 100% of the shares in PIL under French law and this was
sufficient to establish “control” over the company (and through that, its wholly-owned

subsidiary). 323

Perenco asserted that even if the Tribunal were to proceed on the narrow approach to control
advocated by Ecuador, Perenco was nevertheless legally controlled by French nationals as of
17 October 2007 because approximately 7.1 % of the shares in PIL were owned by Glenmor

Energy, which in turn, was wholly owned by Frangois Perrodo.*4

Perenco emphasised that Ecuador has repeatedly and consistently referred to and treated it as a
French company.*”° It argued that under ICSID jurisprudence on Article 25(2)(b), the host
State’s awareness of the objective fact of control is one of the factors taken into consideration

when determining “foreign control”.*7°

Ecuador’s second point was that Article 1(3)(ii) of the Treaty required “direct” control.*”” It

asserted that according to Bahamian law, the Perrodo heirs were not capable of exercising
direct control over PIL (and through that, Perenco) at the critical date because they were not
shareholders of that company. The Contracting Parties intended that the term “control” refer
only to “direct control” because in negotiating the Treaty they chose to remove the phrase

“directly or indirectly” contained in prior drafts of the Treaty, while simultaneously

incorporating it elsewhere in order to expand the scope of the definition of "investment" under

the Treaty.***

Ecuador contended that “it [was] entirely reasonable to suppose that having taken steps to
protect the indirect investments of nationals of a State party, the Contracting Parties did not
believe that they then needed to provide additional protection to those same investments by
expanding the scope of the persons who have standing to bring treaty claims.”*” It submitted
that regardless of what the Tribunal interprets to be the plain and ordinary meaning of the term
“control” in Article 1(3)(ii) of the Treaty, it should have regard to the travaux préparatoires of
the Treaty which, in its view, clearly indicate that the parties’ intention was not to extend the

scope of the term to indirect control, but rather to restrict it to direct control.?°°

Perenco submitted in turn that Ecuador’s argument that the use of the word “controlled” in
Article 1(3)(ii) of the Treaty must be read to mean “controlled directly” should be rejected
because it was refuted by the plain language of the Treaty, by pertinent components of its
travaux préparatoires, and by prior investment treaty jurisprudence.**! In Perenco’s view, the
term “controlled” encompassed both direct and indirect forms of control.** It asserted that
Ecuador has not offered the Tribunal one citation of a dictionary definition of the term which
defined it as limited to “direct control”.** Indeed, the definitions proffered confirm that the
ordinary meaning of control encompassed both direct and indirect forms of control.>*4
Moreover, Perenco averred that recourse to the travaux was inappropriate when the text of the
Treaty was unambiguous (which it submitted was the case here).**° In the event that the
Tribunal determined it was necessary to consult the travaux, Perenco maintained that the

drafting history of the Treaty confirmed the broad meaning of the word “controlled”.**° The

travaux demonstrated that a proposal to limit the definition of a company “to all juridical
persons controlled directly by nationals of one of the Contracting Parties” was notably rejected

by the Contracting Parties.**”

(2) Whether claims relating to Caducidad are arbitrable

Ecuador objected to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to consider the claims relating to caducidad

and, alternatively, the admissibility of such claims.?°8

First, Ecuador submitted that disputes relating to caducidad are not arbitrable under
Ecuadorian Law. Ecuador relied on the evidence of its expert, Professor Juan Pablo Aguilar
Andrade, to submit that under Ecuadorian law a dispute may be submitted to arbitration only if
it is of a contractual nature.*” The declaration of caducidad was an administrative act, carrying
a presumption of legality under Ecuadorian law and challengeable only before Ecuadorian

courts (as per Article 173 of Ecuador’s Constitution).*"”

Perenco rejected this argument, submitting that if it were accepted Ecuador would effectively
have used its domestic law to evade its Treaty obligation to submit all legal disputes regarding
investments to ICSID arbitration.**! In any event, supported by the evidence of its expert Dr.
Hérnan Pérez Loose, it submitted that Ecuadorian law does not preclude arbitration of
caducidad-related disputes because Article 173 of Ecuador’s Constitution provides only that
administrative acts may be challenged before the Ecuadorian acts, and not that this is the

exclusive forum.*

Second, Ecuador asserted that the parties to the Participation Contracts expressly carved
caducidad out of the subject-matter jurisdiction of the Tribunal.*“* It referred to clauses 21.3
and 21.4 of the Block 7 Contract and clause 20.2 and Annex XVI of the Block 21 Contract,**
and submitted that since “the motive for declaration of caducidad ... was legal and did not
arise out of a disagreement of a technical or economic character” it fell strictly outside these

provisions. *“°

Perenco responded that these provisions set out the procedure that should be followed by a
party in terminating the contract based on different grounds. They did not exclude the
submission of caducidad-related claims to arbitration, nor did they require the submission of

caducidad-related claims exclusively to Ecuadorian courts. *#°

Perenco also argued that the issue was not whether a caducidad-related claim was “legal” but
whether it was “related to technical or economic aspects.”*47 It characterised the declaration of
caducidad as an “inseparable element of Ecuador’s coercive conduct against Perenco” which
gave rise to a dispute concerning key provisions relating to the sharing of economic benefits

under the Contracts.*“*

Perenco submitted that only an explicit and unambiguous waiver of its right to submit to

ICSID arbitration could bar such claims and that none of the provisions in the Participation

Contracts qualified. 4

Lastly, Ecuador submitted that the claims relating to caducidad were premature because
Perenco did not seek redress from administrative courts in Ecuador in respect of the same.**°
Perenco responded it could not proceed before administrative courts in Ecuador because of the

Tribunal’s direction in its Decision on Provisional Measures that the Parties refrain from

Merits

(1) Introduction to the claims under the Treaty and the Participation Contracts

Perenco submitted that Ecuador through Law 42, the Implementing Regulations, the coactivas
and seizure of its crude, intervention in the Blocks and declaration of caducidad breached its

obligations under Articles 4, 5 and 6 of the Treaty, and the Participation Contracts.**
At paragraph 2 of its Revised Memorial, Perenco explained that:

Wielding Law 42, Ecuador not only eviscerated fundamental terms of the
Participation Contracts, but in doing so turned what in all other respects was a
highly profitable business into one that, in 2008 — despite record oil prices —
generated a loss of nearly $63 million, and at the same time took for itself
hundreds of millions of dollars that it was not entitled to under the Contracts.
Respondent’s actions also cost Perenco millions of dollars in foregone profits that
Perenco would have earned if not for the enactment and enforcement of Law
42.

For its part, Ecuador framed the enactment and application of Law 42 in very different terms:

Law 42 — together with the Ley de Equidad Tributaria — represented a legitimate
means for Ecuador to achieve a major public policy goal of both re-establishing
the economic equilibrium of its participation contracts (including the
Participation Contracts) which had been disrupted by massive and unforeseen oil
price increases, and opening discussions with the oil companies operating in
Ecuador with a view to agreeing upon more adapted economic models in light of
the new oil-market price order prevailing since the mid-2000s. These measures
were accordingly taken by Ecuador in accordance with its duty to seek a fair

allocation of the petroleum rent between the oil companies operating in Ecuador
and the public.**

Ecuador asserted that in response to escalating oil prices and the prospect of windfall profits,
“most, if not all major producing oil countries in a comparable position to Ecuador [had] taken
measures similar to Law 42 to maintain the economic stability of their concession contracts
since 2002.” An international tribunal could not hold a State liable for economic injury
which was the consequence of bona fide regulation within its police powers.**° The power to
tax was a sovereign power within the category of a State’s police powers, and neither

customary international law nor the Treaty recognized any limitations on this power.**”

Lastly, Ecuador maintained that the events following the enactment of Law 42 and complained
of by Perenco (i.e., coactivas, intervention in the Blocks and caducidad) were triggered by
Perenco’s own illegal conduct.*** For example, the coactiva process was initiated in response
to Perenco’s failure to pay its Law 42 dues.** Thus, Perenco should be barred from claiming

Le . a3
compensation in relation to these claims.*°

(2) Whether Ecuador breached Article 4 of the Treaty by failing to accord fair and
equitable treatment to Perenco’s investment in Blocks 7 and 21

Perenco submitted that Ecuador breached Article 4 of the Treaty obliging it to accord
Perenco’s investment in Blocks 7 and 21 fair and equitable treatment and to refrain from
interfering with the use and enjoyment of Perenco's investments.**' It asserted that its basic
expectations as largely set forth in the Participation Contracts were that its participation was

tied exclusively to the volume of production it generated, thereby isolating it from oil price

fluctuations, and Ecuador agreed not to upset this commercial bargain by making drastic
362

changes to participation percentages in response to price fluctuations in the global market.
Perenco submitted that Ecuador undermined this expectation by enacting and enforcing Law
42.5 This was compounded by the raising of the percentage of revenues demanded by Law 42

to 99% on 4 October 2007.5

Perenco argued that it had a reasonable expectation that the Participation Contracts would not
be amended given their clause 15.2 which required the prior agreement of the parties for any

365
amendments.

It relied on this understanding when it chose to put enormous capital at risk in
Ecuador.*® In this connection, Perenco asserted that when it sought in good faith to negotiate
with Ecuador, Ecuador responded inflexibly and unpredictably, ignoring its obligation to
negotiate a correction factor and to abide by the Decision on Provisional Measures and further

threatening to take legal action against its employees or expel them.>*”

Perenco further contended that it had a legitimate expectation that disputes regarding the
investment would be “resolved peaceably through an international arbitration process at
ICSID.”*** Ecuador’s defiance of the Tribunal’s Decision on Provisional Measures was unfair

and inequitable.*”

Ibid.; Revised Memorial, paragraphs 156-159, 169; Reply, paragraph 282 (“Ecuador thus deliberately created an

environment in which a contractor could expect that it would operate under a production sharing model where the
economic benefit was allocated between the contractor and the State based on an agreed percentage of production,
that the contractor would not be unilaterally and coercively forced to abandon this model for a less profitable
services contract, and that any disputes over such economic matters would be peaceably resolved through binding
international arbitration.”)

Perenco maintained that Ecuador’s actions in direct contravention of its legitimate expectations
effectively removed a substantial portion of revenue to which it was entitled and rendered its

investment in Blocks 7 and 21 commercially unviable.*”°

Ecuador for its part challenged whether the “legitimate expectation” as articulated by Perenco
was consistent with the terms of the Participation Contracts.*”! It submitted that Law 42 could
not modify the Participation Contracts because on a strict reading of its terms it did not affect
the participation in volume of oil that Perenco was entitled to receive.*”* The Participation
Contracts did not guarantee Perenco a right to a given revenue stream, let alone substantial

373

profits.°’~ Thus, Perenco had failed to prove that Law 42 affected the economy of the Contracts

and that a correction factor to the Consortium’s participation should have been negotiated.*”4

(3) Whether Ecuador breached Article 4 of the Treaty by interfering with Perenco’s use
and enjoyment of its investment in Blocks 7 and 21
In addition, Perenco submitted that Ecuador breached Article 4 of the Treaty by interfering

with the management, use, enjoyment and transfer of its investment in Blocks 7 and 21.

Perenco’s submission was that as a result of Law 42, the Implementing Regulations and
Ecuador’s actions in relation thereto, it was progressively denied the various attributes of
management, use and enjoyment of its investment, namely, its exploitation of the Blocks,
production and sale of crude, further investment in additional wells and infrastructure, and
profits thereof. 375

Ecuador rejected this claim. It submitted that the Participation Contracts did not preclude the
State from enacting and enforcing Law 42 and Perenco could not claim that the events

interfered with the use and enjoyment of its investments as Ecuador was acting to enforce its

domestic law, and was responding to Perenco’s own illegal action.*”°

(4) Whether Ecuador breached Article 5 of the Treaty by acting discriminatorily with
regard to Perenco and its investment in Blocks 7 and 21

Article 5 of the Treaty requires Ecuador to accord to nationals or companies of the other
Contracting Party in respect of their investments and activities in connection with such
investments, the same treatment as is accorded to its own nationals or companies, or the

treatment accorded to nationals or companies of the most-favoured nation.*””

Perenco initially submitted that Law 42 was “openly designed” to target the contracts of
foreign companies and that was descriptive of both its intent and effect.*”* Ecuador in its
Counter-Memorial argued that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to determine this claim because
Article 5 of the Treaty excludes its application to matters of taxation, such as Law 42 and the

actions taken by Ecuador to enforce it”
Perenco subsequently abandoned this claim, stating in its Reply at paragraph 5 that:

In the interests of efficiency, Perenco will not advance further its claim that
Ecuador also violated the most favored nation and national treatment provisions
of Article 5 of the Treaty on the basis that Law 42 and its enforcement
discriminated against Perenco. Perenco takes this position in light of the fact that
Article 5 says that ‘[t]he provisions of this article shall not apply to taxation
matters,’ and the decision on jurisdiction issued by the tribunal in Burlington v.
Ecuador to the effect that Law 42 should fall within the carve-out in the U.S.-
Ecuador Treaty for matters of taxation. See Burlington (Jurisdiction), EL-109, {{{]
164-167. Perenco does not accept that the Burlington tribunal’s analysis is
necessarily correct or binding on this Tribunal, but, to simplify this proceeding, it
is prepared not to pursue its distinct claim for violation of Article 5 of the Treaty.
The discriminatory intent and effect of Ecuador’s conduct nevertheless remains

 

Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 495-502. The Claimant at paragraphs 329-336 of its Reply submitted in turn that

Ecuador had conflated its rebuttal to the claim for breach of fair and equitable treatment with that of breach of the
obligation not to impede or impair the investor's right to manage, use and enjoy with ect to its investment;
that there was in its view no breach of the terms of the Participation Contracts. Perenco submitted that the latter
obligation is distinct from the obligation to afford fair and equitable treatment, and that the observance of
contractual obligations (which Perenco disputed occurred in its case) was not a sufficient answer.

relevant to Ecuador’s obligations under other Treaty provisions, including
Article 4, as well as to Ecuador’s contractual obligations, as discussed below.”

In its Reply, the Claimant raised an alternative submission in the context of a contractual
undertaking under clause 5.1.28 of the Block 7 Participation Contract not to discriminate
between Contractors operating in Ecuador on participation contracts for the exploration and
exploitation of hydrocarbons.**! Due to the contractual nature of this claim, it is described

below at paragraphs 272 and 276.

(5) Whether Ecuador breached Article 6 of the Treaty by expropriating Perenco’s
investment in Blocks 7 and 21

Perenco submitted that the cumulative effect of Ecuador’s measures, beginning with its

enactment of Law 42 (which essentially deprived Perenco of the key terms of Perenco’s

investment, namely the opportunity to earn profits),**?

the enforcement of Law 42 through its
seizure and sale of Perenco’s crude, its physical take-over of the Blocks and unilaterally
declaring caducidad, resulted in a “complete taking of Perenco’s assets” in breach of Article 6

of the Treaty.**°

Ecuador has also failed to comply with the requirements of Article 6 in that it
has not put forward any public necessity justification for its actions and has not paid nor

offered to pay any compensation.***

Perenco submitted that a measure is expropriatory “when it leads to a substantial deprivation or
effectively renders useless an investor’s property rights.”°5° Relying on Alpha Projecktholding
v. Ukraine, Perenco asserted that a “government action need not amount to an outright seizure
or transfer of title in order to amount to an expropriation under international law”, in this way
laying foundation for its submission that the actions of a State which deprive an investor of
acquired contractual rights can be expropriatory. 586 Th this light, Perenco maintained that
“when a State exercise[d] its public authority unilaterally to amend the key terms of a contract

with an investor, with the effect of essentially depriving the investor of the contractor’s
benefits, such a repudiation of acquired contract rights constitute[d] a measure tantamount to
expropriation.”**”

Perenco submitted that Ecuador could not excuse its conduct by arguing that Law 42 was a
legitimate exercise of its sovereign rights to regulate the use of its natural resources or that its
actions were permitted under Ecuadorian law.°** Moreover, the fact that Perenco was prepared
to make disputed payments into an escrow account, and that it moved to suspend operations in
the Blocks, was immaterial to the analysis of its claim as these were “justifiable and

proportionate responses to Ecuador’s prior expropriatory acts.”**°

Ecuador responded by first stressing that Perenco has failed to discharge its burden of proving
how the enforcement by the State of a law legitimately enacted and declared constitutional by

its highest court was expropriatory.*”
Its argument in support was two-fold.

First, Ecuador submitted that Law 42, the coactiva process, Ecuador’s temporary take-over of
the Blocks and caducidad were all bona fide and legitimate exercises of Ecuador’s police
powers and did not constitute an expropriation under international law.**' Ecuador contended
that, in this regard, international tribunals have consistently held that taxation measures, being
one of the most important attributes of sovereignty, are permitted under international law
without creating a duty to compensate. *”” The presumption of validity or legitimacy of a
State’s regulatory interference was not easy to overturn and States had a wide discretion in the

393

exercise of their regulatory functions under domestic law.””” Citing Paushok v. Mongolia,

Ecuador submitted that Perenco could only succeed if it proved that “Law 42 was

Ecuador described Law 42 as a bona fide exercise of police powers pursuant to its
“Tcjonstitutional mandate to seek a fair allocation of the revenues derived from its
hydrocarbons” and, in this way, intended “to remedy a disequilibrium caused by a massive and
unforeseen increase in oil prices” which resulted in oil companies making windfall profits.*°°
In this connection, Ecuador submitted that Law 42 was duly enacted in accordance with the
requisite procedure under Ecuadorian law and its constitutionality was upheld by the

Ecuadorian Constitutional Court.*”°

Similarly, the events following the enactment of Law 42 were legitimate responses to
Perenco’s own illegal conduct. The coactiva process was a normal exercise of Ecuador’s
public powers to collect unpaid taxes and levies when Perenco unilaterally stopped paying its
dues.*”” It temporarily intervened in Blocks 7 and 21 because Perenco unilaterally suspended
operations in these Blocks, an action which in Ecuador’s view, was the product of what it
termed a “self-expropriation” strategy.° In the face of Perenco’s intransigence in refusing to
resume operations of the Blocks and the risk of damage in the Blocks, Ecuador had to continue
to operate the Blocks and undertake proceedings to declare caducidad of the Participation

Contracts.*””

Ecuador further averred in this regard that Perenco had a duty to engage in contractual
renegotiations in order to restore the economic equilibrium of the Participation Contracts, but
failed to do so when it was unable to secure the agreement of its consortium partner,

Second, Ecuador submitted that Law 42 and the actions of the State to enforce it did not
permanently deprive Perenco of its investment. It argued that the burden of proof is on Perenco
and the fact that Law 42 did not amend key terms of the Participation Contracts and a
stabilisation clause was not provided for means there can be no breach of contract and
consequently, no repudiation of Perenco’s contractual rights.*! Perenco has failed to show that

Law 42 deprived it of any of its contractual rights.*

Ecuador submitted in the alternative that if the Tribunal were to find that Law 42 was in breach
of the Participation Contracts, it was not a breach that amounted to an expropriation within

Article 6.4

A breach (or breaches) of a contract can only amount to an expropriation if the
investor is thereby deprived of the contract’s benefits. 4" Ecuador argued that, in contrast,
Perenco’s submission was the mere allegation, “without any true economic analysis”, that Law
42 deprived it of a key term of the Participation Contracts and consequently the benefit of its

investment.“

Finally, Ecuador maintained that, in any event, Law 42, whether at 50% or 99%, did not

amount to an expropriation.“°°

At 50%, Law 42 did not render the investment worthless, and this was supported by the fact

that tax returns for Blocks 7 and 21 for the fiscal years of 2006 and 2007 indicate Perenco

407

continued to derive significant profits from its investments in Ecuador.” Ecuador further

pointed to the 1“ Fair Links report to support its contention that Law 42 at 50% in April 2006
preserved Perenco’s initial expectations of return on its investment.** As for Law 42 at 99%,
Ecuador submitted that this too was not expropriatory because it did not adversely affect the

“reasonable profit” that Perenco could have expected to receive, using the reference price on

which the negotiation of the Participation Contracts was based (US $15/obl).4° Law 42 at 99%

continued to apply only to the share of extraordinary revenue that Perenco was receiving.*"”

(6) Whether Ecuador breached contractual undertakings not to unilaterally amend key
terms of the Participation Contracts, not to discriminate and to negotiate

Perenco submitted that Law 42 and its enforcement had the effect of unilaterally amending key

terms of the Contracts (including but not limited to clause 8.1) in breach of the Contracts’

provisions on modification.“!

Perenco argued that by applying Law 42 Ecuador breached the pacta sunt servanda principle
governing the Contracts pursuant to Article 1561 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code and/or a
specific provision in the Contracts regarding requirements for its amendment.*”? This was
because Law 42 had the effect of unilaterally amending key terms of the Contracts. *"?
Moreover, the Contracts required Perenco and Ecuador to negotiate a correction factor in the

event measures taken by the State upset the economy of the Contracts.*"* This was not done.

Perenco contended further that the Contracts required the parties to negotiate if the law
applicable to the contract was amended.*'° Perenco relied on clause 22.1 of the Participation

Contracts, the governing law clause, which stated that “laws in force at the time of its

execution are understood to be incorporated in inl’

Finally, Perenco averred that by exempting the application of Law 42 to another contractor

operating in Ecuador, Andes Petroleum, Ecuador breached its contractual undertaking in clause

5.1.28 not to discriminate between “Participation Contractors for the Exploration and

Ecuador responded that the only guarantee that the Contracts offered to Perenco was
“participation” in the form of an entitlement to a physical share in the oil produced.*'$ Perenco
could not reasonably claim a guarantee of gross income under the terms of the Contracts.*"”

Ecuador similarly rejected Perenco’s claim in relation to the triggering of the renegotiation
clause in the Contracts. It submitted that it was not triggered because Law 42 did not upset the

- 2
economy of the Contracts.*”°

Ecuador submitted that Perenco has failed to discharge its burden
of demonstrating that Law 42 had an impact on the economy of the Participation Contracts,

and what the appropriate adjustment would have been.*7!

Ecuador denied any suggestion by Perenco that clause 22.1 operates as a stabilisation clause.*”?
Rather, clause 22.1 must be read as providing that that the Contracts are governed by

Ecuadorian legislation in force at the relevant time, in addition to laws which were in force at

the time the Participation Contracts were concluded.’

Finally, Ecuador challenged the claim regarding the alleged breach of clause 5.1.28 of the
Block 7 Contract as raised “far too late”, requesting that it be dismissed.*** It was raised for the
first time by the Claimant in its Reply; it was not canvassed in its Request, Memorial or

(7) Whether Ecuador was contractually bound to comply with the Tribunal’s Decision
on Provisional Measures
In its Amended Request for Arbitration dated 30 April 2008, Perenco sought provisional
measures requesting the Tribunal to enjoin Ecuador from pursuing any action to collect any
payments that Ecuador claimed Perenco owed as a result of Law 42 and its Implementing
Regulations, and from unilaterally amending, rescinding, terminating or repudiating the
Participation Contracts or any of its terms.*”° The chain of events that followed, leading up to
and including the Tribunal’s Decision on Provisional Measures of 8 May 2009, are set out in

detail in the Statement of Facts at Section III. F.

Perenco submitted that Ecuador’s “actions in defiance of the Tribunal’s Provisional Measures
order” formed an independent breach of the Participation Contracts’ terms with respect to the

agreement to arbitrate and the parties’ submission to the decisions of the Tribunal.*””

Ecuador, in response, submitted that any such failure to abide by the Tribunal’s
recommendation of provisional measures did not as a matter of Ecuadorian law violate the
contractual obligations invoked by Perenco.*”* In the alternative, Ecuador argued that its

: . - oe 2
actions were not causative of any loss suffered by Perenco.*”?

Ecuador’s Counterclaims

The Tribunal notes that Ecuador has filed a counterclaim in which it claims that the effect of

Perenco’s actions, in alleged breach of its obligations under Ecuadorian environmental law,

resulted in significant environmental damage to Blocks 7 and 21, and amounted to a failure to

properly maintain the Blocks’ infrastructure in good working condition.“*°

For the purposes of this Decision, it is unnecessary to recount the substance of Ecuador’s
counterclaims and Perenco’s responses thereto as the Parties agreed to a separate briefing
schedule and hearing. Accordingly, the Tribunal will not record the parties’ submissions as
they stand any further in this Decision. The counterclaims will be addressed by the Tribunal in

a separate decision to be issued in due course.

Remedies

Perenco claimed full reparation in respect of its claims and to monetary damages in lieu of
restitution in kind.**! The award of monetary damages should include Law 42 amounts that
Perenco paid under protest, revenues from oil seized by Ecuador by means of the coactivas,
profit from foregone investments that Perenco would have made but for the implementation of
Law 42, the present value of future profits from the Participation Contracts and any extensions
thereof, the costs and expenses that arose from the expropriation of Perenco’s property, the

sap: we . . 3
costs of this arbitration and compound interest at commercial rates on all amounts.*

Ecuador submitted that the Tribunal should find that it lacks jurisdiction over the claims in
their entirety or over particular claims. In the alternative, Ecuador argued that Perenco has
failed to discharge its burden of proof in respect of its claims under the Contracts and the

Treaty, and that in any event the claims fail on their merits.*

As noted, Ecuador forwarded two counterclaims, and sought an order from the Tribunal
directing Perenco to remedy any and all environmental damage in Blocks 7 and 21, and
compensate for its failure to revert the Blocks to Ecuador in good working condition by paying
damages to be determined in the quantum phase of this arbitration, inclusive of compound

interest, and all costs and expenses of the arbitration.***

JURISDICTION OVER CLAIMANT’S CONTRACT CLAIMS

The Tribunal recalls its finding in its Decision on Jurisdiction that in general the claims for
breach of the Block 7 and Block 21 Contracts by reason of the application of Law 42 fall

within its jurisdiction.**”

Ecuador, however, objected to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction under the Contracts to consider any
claims relating to caducidad and, alternatively, to the admissibility of such claims.*** Perenco
argued, both as part of its argument regarding a chain of events set into motion by Ecuador’s
refusal to comply with the Decision on Provisional Measures as well as a separate argument,

that the declaration of caducidad constituted a breach of contract.“

The remaining objection of the Respondent

Ecuador submitted that disputes relating to caducidad were not arbitrable under Ecuadorian
Law.*° The Contracts provided, in clauses 20.2.12 and 20.2.1.3 of the Block 21 and Block 7
Contracts respectively, that the arbitration is “governed by the provisions of this Contract...and

the laws of Ecuador”.“' Ecuador contended that Ecuadorian law permits only contractual

442

disputes to be submitted to arbitration.””~ The declaration of caducidad, however, was an

they fulfill the requirements established herein. For the different entities in the public sector to submit to
arbitration, in addition to complying with the requirements of this Law, they shall fulfill the following additional
requirements: a) Enter into an agreement to arbitrate, before the emergence of the dispute; in the event the
agreement is sought to be signed after the dispute has arisen, the Attorney General of the State must be consulted,
whose opinion will be binding; b) The legal relationship to which the agreement relates shall be contractual in
nature; c) The arbitration agreement must include the manner in which the arbitrators will be selected; and, d) The

“expression of the State’s power (pouvoir public) exercised through an administrative act that
falls outside of the scope of issues that parties can dispose of (materias transigibles).”*8
Administrative acts carry a presumption of legality under Ecuadorian law and may only be

challenged before Ecuadorian courts (as per Article 173 of Ecuador’s Constitution).

In this connection, Ecuador relied on the decision of an ICSID tribunal in Repsol YPF Ecuador

445

S.A. v. Empresa Estatal Petréleos del Ecuador (Petroecuador),> which in its view found that

issues relating to the validity of administrative acts, such as caducidad, were not arbitrable
under Ecuadorian law.“

Ecuador’s legal expert, Professor Aguilar, began his evidence in this regard with the premise
that caducidad was “‘an administrative sanction imposed through an administrative act.” He
referred to Article 65 of the Executive Branch’s Legal and Administrative Regime Act in

448 1“ and the Supreme Court of Justice*?

Ecuador” and decisions of the Constitutional Tribunal
to support the proposition that an administrative act may take the form of a unilateral
declaration in the exercise of administrative function that produces direct and individual legal
effects. *"' He asserted that under Ecuadorian law such administrative acts enjoyed a
“presumption of legitimacy”, the burden falling on the party challenging the act to demonstrate

that it was carried out in a manner that did not comply with applicable law or regulation.**

Professor Aguilar stated that under Ecuadorian law such a challenge could only be brought
before its administrative courts.” In his view the declaration of caducidad in this arbitration

fit perfectly into this notion of an administrative act in Ecuador, and could not be challenged

otherwise than in Ecuadorian administrative courts.***

Professor Aguilar interpreted Article 74(4) of the Hydrocarbons Law, which identifies the legal
and contractual breaches of sufficient gravity to justify the imposition of the sanction of

caducidad, as providing a prerogative administrative power (as opposed to a contractual

455

power) to sanction.” This further supported his position that caducidad could not be the

subject of arbitral review since it was not a dispute which was contractual in nature, as required

by Article 4 of the Arbitration and Mediation Law (where a party to the dispute is a public

sector entity).**°

Second, and in the alternative, Ecuador submitted that the parties to the Contracts expressly

and contractually carved caducidad out of the subject-matter jurisdiction of the Tribunal.”

458

Ecuador relied on clauses 21.3 and 21 of the Block 7 Contract and clause 20.2 and Annex

XVI of the Block 21 Contract.*° The former provided that if the Contract was terminated by

reasons other than caducidad, the procedure to which the parties have agreed for disputes to be

submitted to arbitration should be followed.“ Clause 20.2 of the Block 21 Contract in turn
provided that “if a caducity proceeding is initiated, in the event that the cause for caducity is
related to technical or economic aspects” the matter may be submitted to arbitration by either
party.*°! This had to be read together with Annex XVI which provides that once the ICSID
Convention had been approved by the “National Congress of the Republic of Ecuador and,
therefore, [was] fully in force, the Parties agree[d] that any technical and/or economic dispute
arising out of the application of the Participation Contract ... shall be resolved according to the

provisions of the aforementioned Convention, leaving, accordingly, without effect the

Arbitration procedure provided in Clause twenty of the Contract."

In this regard, in characterising the nature of claims in this arbitration that relate to caducidad,
Ecuador submitted that because “the motive for the declaration of caducidad ... was legal and

did not arise out of a disagreement of a technical or economic nature” it fell strictly outside the

subject-matter jurisdiction of the Tribunal as contractually delineated.*

Lastly, Ecuador submitted that the claims relating to caducidad were premature because
Perenco had not sought redress from the Ecuadorian administrative courts.“ It contended that
treaty claims are “defective” unless there has been a “reasonable attempt by the investor” to

pursue available judicial redress within the State, a ground distinct, in Ecuador’s submission

465

from the requirement to exhaust local remedies.” Ecuador submitted that this claim was not

Clauses 21.3 and 21.4 of the Block 7 Contract provides “21.3 In cases of termination for reasons other than
caducity, the procedures agreed to by the Parties in Clause Twenty shall be followed. 21.4 For the effects of
caducity and sanctions, the provisions of Chapter IX of the Hydrocarbons Law shall apply.” [Italics in original,
emphasis added.] (Exhibit CE-17, PER 04858)

Clause 20.2 of the Block 21 Participation Contract provides that “Technical and/or Economic Arbitration: In
the event that the disputes are related to any matter not included within the scope of the previous clause or if, for
any reason, submitting the matter to a consultant does not produce a final and binding resolution, the technical
matters involving economic aspects, and vice-versa, shall be subject to a consulting and arbitration procedure
accepted by Ecuadorian Law. Legal matters may not be submitted to arbitration and shall be submitted to the
jurisdiction and competence set forth in the relevant legal provisions.

Additionally, if a caducity proceeding is initiated, in the event that the cause for caducity is related to technical or
economic aspects, and the Parties have differing views, either of the Parties may submit the matter to arbitration.
For as long as this process lasts, any caducity proceeding that might have been initiated shall be suspended.”

viable until and unless Perenco challenged the lawfulness of the action in Ecuador’s

administrative courts.“°°

The Claimant’s submission

Perenco submitted that if the Tribunal were to uphold the Respondent’s objection it would be
permitting Ecuador to employ its domestic laws to evade its Treaty obligation to submit all
legal disputes with regard to investments to ICSID arbitration. 467 Perenco relied on the
Decision on Jurisdiction in Occidental IT, where the tribunal considered a similar argument and
held that Ecuador could not invoke its domestic law to avoid ICSID jurisdiction under the

applicable treaty.*%

Perenco submitted that in any event Ecuadorian law did not preclude arbitration of caducidad-
related disputes. It referred to Dr. Pérez Loose’s evidence that Article 4(b) of the Arbitration
and Mediation Law required only that the underlying legal relationship of the dispute be
contractual and not that the dispute and the impugned conduct both had to be contractual in
nature.“ Perenco argued that it “cannot be disputed that the legal relationship arising out of
the Participation Contracts is ‘contractual in nature’.”*”° Dr. Pérez Loose also took the view
that Article 173 of Ecuador’s Constitution provides only that administrative acts may be
challenged before the Ecuadorian courts, and not that they must be challenged before the

courts,*7!

Perenco submitted that Ecuador had misconstrued Repsol, asserting that it stands only for the
proposition that an ICSID tribunal could have jurisdiction over an administrative act with

possibly res judicata effect as long as the conditions of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention

have been satisfied; the administrative nature of the State’s conduct did not in and of itself

preclude the tribunal from claiming jurisdiction.“””

Perenco’s expert also addressed the alternative scenario, namely, that if Article 4(b) of the
Arbitration and Mediation Law required the disputed action to be of a contractual nature (and
not just that the legal relationship from which the dispute arises is contractual), then the
declaration of caducidad remained arbitrable because it was a “contractual administrative

act”. “7? Dr. Pérez Loose defined such acts as “administrative acts [that] presuppose the
existence of a contractual relationship” and marked by the characteristics that “they are
unilateral decisions through which the public entit[y] create[s], terminate[s] or modif[ies]
private individual legal situations” and “whose raison d’étre is an underlying contract or

bilateral relationship established with a private citizen.”*74

Examples given of “contractual administrative acts” were the imposition of a fine on a
contractor for delay or breach of contract and orders to enforce guarantees and collect on
insurance policies.*”° Dr. Pérez Loose relied on the writings of civil legal theorists such as Juan
Carlos Cassagne, *”° Rodolfo Barra, *”” Diana Ximena Correa*”® and Luis Berrocal, *”” who
accepted the existence of a contractual administrative act and in one instance, referred to it as

“acts through which the contracting entity imposes a fine upon the contractor or unilaterally

The Colombian legal scholar Luis Berrocal defines contractual administrative acts similarly as “those that are
carried out within the term of force of the contract and for the purpose of the performance thereof. These occur
within the so-called contractual stage. Therefore, their existence is determined by the existence of the contract,
they depend directly on it. This is the case for acts through which the contracting entity imposes a fine upon the
contractor or unilaterally interprets the contract, declares its caducity, etc.” CA-402, BERROCAL, Luis; Manual

interprets the contract, declares its caducity etc.”**° He submitted that the practice of arbitral
tribunals in Ecuador confirmed that caducity was arbitrable; the examples cited included in one
instance Petroproducci6n as a disputing party, although the cases that considered actions
terminating the contract referred to actions for ‘unilateral termination’, rather than a

declaration of caducidad.**!

This qualification was noted by Professor Aguilar in his fourth expert report, where he stressed
that Dr. Pérez Loose’s admission as to the administrative nature of the sanction was sufficient

- . «atin 482
for Ecuador to succeed on its objection.

Moreover, when pressed in cross-examination, Dr.
Pérez Loose admitted that several of the decisions he cited did not deal with caducidad, but
with fines.“ He argued that they remained relevant as they demonstrated that “in Ecuador,
administrative action, administrative decisions are arbitrable. Some can be infractions or fines,

others can be unilateral termination of contracts, yet again caducidad.”***

When pressed further about the cases that he cited which dealt with unilateral termination, Dr.
Pérez Loose stated that caducidad and unilateral termination are one and the same thing.**
When asked whether he accepted that “there can be a termination of a contract in the exercise
as a Contracting Party and there can be the termination of a contract by resort to what [could be
called] ‘extra-contractual means’ in the sense of initiating a process, an administrative process,
such as caducidad”’, Dr. Pérez Loose responded that he agreed these were “two avenues”, the

latter of which was “based in the law...but materialize[d] in the Contract” and it was for this

examination, Professor Aguilar admitted that “[i]n Ecuador, there [was] a debate currently in connection with
contractual administrative acts”, but clarified that “there is no doubt that a non-contractual administrative act, the
only way it can be challenged is...the Administrative Courts[.]” (Transcript, Hearing the Merits, Day 6, p 1563).

reason that “in administrative law, this type of acts [sic]... are known as administrative

contractual acts.”*°

Addressing the further issue of a contractual carve-out of caducity from arbitration, Perenco
submitted that clauses 21.3 and 21.4 of the Block 7 Contract and clause 20.2 and Annex XVI
of the Block 21 Contract did not exclude caducidad-related claims from the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction. *” Instead, it argued that the clauses were purely procedural, setting out the
procedure that should be followed by a party in terminating the contract based on different
grounds, and not necessarily excluding the submission of caducidad-related claims to
arbitration, nor requiring the submission of such claims exclusively to Ecuadorian courts.“*8 In
this regard, it submitted that it is significant that the clauses appear in section 21 of the Block 7
Contract, which addressed “Termination and Caducity of this Contract”, rather than the
relevant sections on arbitration and applicable law (Sections 20 and 22, particularly clauses

20.3 and 20.4 which dealt with the submission to ICSID arbitration).“*”

Perenco relied on the Occidental II Decision on Jurisdiction where Ecuador advanced a similar
argument with regard to similar provisions, and the tribunal held that the clauses did not
consist of a carve-out of caducidad disputes from ICSID jurisdiction because there was no
evidence of a “common intention” to do so.*”° Perenco contended that if parties intended a
carve-out it would have been included in the arbitration provision of the contracts. ”!

Responding to Ecuador’s insistence on a distinction between legal and technical/economic
issues, Perenco submitted that the question was not whether a caducidad-related claim was
“legal” but whether it was “related to technical or economic aspects." It characterised the
declaration of caducidad in this regard as an inseparable element of Ecuador’s coercive
conduct against Perenco, which in the “words of this Tribunal [gave] rise to a ‘dispute

concerning the participation percentages in the share of the produced crude oil [which]

and was part of a
series of events which had an impact on key provisions relating to the sharing of economic

benefits under the Contracts.**

Perenco submitted that “only an explicit, clear and unambiguous waiver by the investor of its
right to submit treaty claims to an ICSID Tribunal [could] bar such claims in ICSID

arbitration”””, and that none of the provisions in the Contracts could be said to constitute a

clear and unambiguous waiver of ICSID jurisdiction over caducidad-related Treaty claims.*”°

Lastly, Perenco submitted that it could not proceed before administrative courts in Ecuador
because of the Tribunal’s direction in its Decision on Provisional Measures that the parties
should refrain from resorting to “domestic courts of Ecuador to enforce or resist any
claim...”.477 In any event, referring to the Decision on Jurisdiction in Occidental I, and the
Helnan International Hotels v. Arab Republic of Egypt Annulment Decision, Perenco
submitted that an argument to the effect that there can be no international wrong in an ICSID

arbitration without a prior attempt to seek redress under municipal law is without merit."

The Tribunal’s Decision

The caducity issue arises in connection with both the contract claims and Treaty claims. The
latter are addressed below at paragraphs 628 to 630. Insofar as the contract claims are
concerned, the Tribunal’s jurisdiction hinges on the construction of the relevant provisions of

the two contracts.

Turning to the Block 7 Contract, the Tribunal notes firstly that the power to declare caducidad
is an administrative power residing in the Ministry of Energy and Mines, not in Perenco’s

counterparty, Petroecuador.

so

502

Second, caducidad is one of nine specified ways in which the Contract can terminate.

Termination and caducidad are plainly not coterminous concepts.

Third, the sub-clauses dealing with caducidad (clause 21.2 and 21.3) specify the procedure
which the Ministry must follow, provide for cure periods for the contractor, and expressly
distinguish between other forms of termination and termination by caducidad: “In cases of
termination for reasons other than caducity, the procedures agreed to by the Parties in Clause
Twenty [“Consulting and Arbitration”] shall be followed.”*”? That is, by the Contract’s express

terms, all other forms of termination can be arbitrated and caducidad cannot.

The Tribunal considers that the Block 7 Contract is thus clear that caducidad is subject to a
separate regime. Declarations of caducity were excluded from the Contract’s arbitration
provisions, and the Tribunal thus lacks jurisdiction to review the declaration of caducidad for

the Block 7 Contract.

The situation is different under the terms of the Block 21 Contract, which does not provide that
“Ti]n cases of termination for reasons other than caducity, the procedures agreed to by the
Parties in [the Arbitration section]” shall apply. Instead, it states that if a caducity proceeding
has been initiated, and the cause is related to technical or economic aspects, and the parties
“have differing views”, either party may submit the matter to arbitration. In such event, the
process of caducity should be suspended for the duration of the arbitration.°”' As the Tribunal
discussed in its Decision on Jurisdiction, the parties also added provisions regarding the

procedure of the arbitration through Annex XVI to the Block 21 Contract. 5° Annex XVI

provides that:

Once the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes, ICSID, has been
approved by the National Congress of the Republic of Ecuador and, therefore, is
fully in force, the Parties agree that any technical and/or economic dispute
arising out of the application of the Participation Contract for the Exploration

and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons in Block 21 of the Amazon Region, which is
the object of the present Contract, shall be resolved according to the provisions of
the aforementioned Convention, leaving, accordingly, without effect the
Arbitration procedure provided in clause twenty of the Contract.

For the application of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes,
ICSID, the following procedural rules shall also apply:

1. The Parties agree to submit to the INTERNATIONAL CENTRE FOR THE
SETTLEMENT OF INVESTMENT DISPUTES any technical and/or economic
dispute relating to this Participation Contract for the Exploration and
Exploitation of Hydrocarbons for resolution through the Arbitration mechanism,
which for all effects is hereafter referred to as “THE CENTRE”...

The Tribunal found that Annex XVI had to be considered when determining the scope of its
ratione materiae competence over contractual claims. It found that the contractual claims
advanced by Perenco that concerned a “technical” or “economic” dispute relating to the Block
21 Participation Contract fell within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, and that this was not a
cumulative test (i.e. the dispute need not be of a technical and an economic nature).°° Clause
20.2 of the Block 21 Contract contemplates that a dispute regarding a declaration of caducity
which is related to technical or economic aspects may be submitted to arbitration. Annex XVI
does not single out caducity, placing upon the subject-matter jurisdicton of the Tribunal the

sole limitation that the claim should concern a “technical” or “economic” dispute.

Having regard to the Tribunal’s findings in its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal considers
that the declaration of caducidad has economic consequences and therefore falls within its
subject-matter jurisdiction. The Tribunal accordingly finds that it has jurisdiction to entertain

Perenco’s claim that Ecuador breached the Block 21 Contract when it declared caducidad.

CLAIMS FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT

The Tribunal begins by identifying the law applicable to the claims of breach of contract,

before turning to consider the Parties’ submissions and its findings on liability.

Law applicable to the claims relating to the Participation Contracts

Under Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, parties have full autonomy to designate the rules
of law governing any dispute arising between them. In the present case, the parties to the

Participation Contracts agreed for Block 7 that:

22.1 Applicable legislation: This Contract is governed exclusively by
Ecuadorian legislation, and the laws in force at the time of its execution are
understood to be incorporated in it.*°°

The applicable law provision in the Block 21 Contract is identical (clause 22.1).°°7

As a result of these express choices of applicable law, the Tribunal must apply Ecuadorian law.

Under the Block 21 Contract, “any technical and/or economic dispute arising out of
(“derivada’) from the application of the Participation Contract” shall be resolved by ICSID
arbitration.*°* The Tribunal has already found that the claim that the Block 21 contract was
breached by the enactment of Law 42 and related measures falls within its jurisdiction. It has
also found that there are limits on its jurisdiction ratione materiae in respect of the contract
claims. The Tribunal held that the “alleged violation of the Ecuadorian Constitution, its
provisions on confiscation, discrimination and retroactivity of laws concern[ed] essentially
legal matters, and cannot qualify as a ‘technical and/or economic dispute relating to [the Block
21] Participation contract.”°!° Accordingly, these matters were not covered by the Parties’

consent to arbitration, and therefore lie outside the Tribunal’s competence.*!!

With respect to the Block 7 Participation Contract, there is no equivalent restriction on the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione materiae; clause 20.3 records the parties’ agreement to “submit

the disputes or differences arising out of or related to the performance of this Participation

Contract to the jurisdiction and competence of the International Centre for Settlement of

Exhibit CE-17, Block 7 Participation Contract, PER 04858.

“Applicable law. This Contract is governed exclusively by Ecuadorian legislation, and the laws in force at the
time of its execution are understood to be incorporated in it.” (Exhibit CE-10, Block 21 Participation Contract,

Investment Disputes...”. 5B

The Tribunal has rejected the Respondent’s objections to the
Tribunal’s competence over this claim.*? In doing so, it took note of the Claimant’s statement
that it “does not contest the Ecuadorian ‘constitutionality or legality’ of Law 42 and its

implementing regulations.”° 4

Accordingly, the Tribunal applies Ecuadorian law, recognising that it should refrain from
analysing the constitutionality or legality per se of Law 42 and related measures.*!> The focus
instead is on an alleged breach of contract said to arise out of Law 42’s impact on Perenco’s

expected economic benefits resulting from its performance of the Contracts.

The Tribunal’s approach to the claims of breach of the Participation Contracts

The Tribunal begins by noting its approach to the Burlington decision (Decision on Liability of
14 December 2012 in Burlington Resources, Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador (ICSID Case No.
ARB/08/5)) and the decision of the Ecuadorian Constitutional Court on the constitutionality of

Law 42, before turning to the parties’ submissions on Law 42 and its effect on the Contracts.

Both parties have directed the Tribunal to certain findings made by the Burlington tribunal
with a view to either urging the Tribunal to follow or reject such findings. While mindful of the
fact that that the Burlington tribunal has also considered the Participation Contracts, the
Tribunal notes that that tribunal’s jurisdiction differs from its own. The Burlington tribunal had
jurisdiction over treaty disputes only, and therefore to the extent that it considered the
Participation Contracts, it did so incidentally to its treaty jurisdiction and evidently did not
consider the Contract within the general framework of Ecuadorian law. There is, for example,

no discussion by the tribunal in the Decision on Liability or in the dissenting opinion as to

Exhibit CE-17, Block 7 Participation Contract, PER 04851-04852. Clause 20.3 provides: “...from the date on
which the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (‘the
Convention’), signed by Ecuador, as a State member of the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, on 15 January 1986 and published in Official Registry No. 386 of 3 March 1986, is approved by the
Ecuadorian Congress, the Parties shall be obliged to submit the disputes or differences arising out of or related to
the performance of this Participation Contract to the jurisdiction and competence of the International Centre for
the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) to be settled and resolved in conformity with the provisions of said

Convention. Under this system of arbitration, the following provisions shall apply:...”.

whether the Contracts are to be characterised as private or administrative contracts, yet this
was addressed by the Constitutional Court and was a topic to which the parties’ legal experts

devoted considerable attention in this proceeding.*!°

As this Tribunal must determine any “doubts and disputes that may arise” during the

Participation Contracts’ terms, specifically any “technical and/or economic dispute”*"”

, it is
required not only to interpret the Contracts, but also to consider the type of powers that the
State may have had under Ecuadorian law in relation thereto and how such powers could be
exercised. Every economic claim has to be analysed in a legal context but that in itself does not
prevent it from being characterised as an economic dispute. Indeed, extensive evidence has
been submitted by both parties on questions of Ecuadorian law bearing on the interpretation
and application of salient terms of the Participation Contracts. Given its contractual
jurisdiction, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to analyse the issues put before it by the
disputing Parties in light of their submissions and all record evidence, without basing its

decision on the Burlington tribunal’s contractual analysis.

Both Parties referred to the Constitutional Court’s decision. Insofar as the merits of the Court’s
judgment were concerned, Perenco contended — with reference to Dr. Pérez Loose’s criticisms
— that it was not a “persuasive and carefully reasoned treatment of the points of law
addressed.”°'* This raised questions as to precisely what Perenco sought the Tribunal to do
regarding the Constitutional Court’s judgment both in relation to the contract and Treaty

claims.

For its part, the Respondent emphasised that Law 42 had been declared constitutional by the
highest court in Ecuador.*”” It pointed out that during the jurisdictional phase, Perenco had

stated that it “does not contest the Ecuadorian ‘constitutionality or legality’ of Law 42 and its

implementing regulations and that as a result of this, the Tribunal had held that the issue

raised by the Respondent “if it were to be construed as an objection, has become moot.”>!
Ecuador renewed its objection when the issue evidently reappeared in the merits phase in
relation to Perenco’s Revised Memorial’s allegation that “Ecuador’s unilateral modification of
the economic provisions of the Participation Contracts through the enactment and application
of Law 42 [...] violated key constitutional provisions that were incorporated by reference into
the Participation Contracts” and that the “constitutional — and in turn contractual — provisions
mimic principles of international law explored above.”>”
In its Reply, the Claimant restated its position that it did not challenge Ecuador’s authority to
promulgate Law 42 nor did it request the Tribunal to grant relief that would involve
overturning Law 42 or amending it. Rather, it confirmed that it challenged Law 42’s
application to the Participation Contracts and Ecuador’s enforcement of Law 42 against
Perenco, which in its submission breached Ecuador’s contractual and treaty obligations.*
Accordingly:

Perenco’s claim that Ecuador breached the Contracts through conduct that was

contrary to international law or inconsistent with principles recognized in the

Ecuadorian constitution...should be understood in light of this position. To the

extent that the assertions in paragraphs 272 to 232 of Perenco’s Revised

Memorial are considered to be inconsistent with that position, such assertions
should be deemed withdrawn.*™*

 

The Tribunal takes note of this clarification on Perenco’s part.

While mindful that the Constitutional Court did not consider Perenco’s Participation Contracts,
the Tribunal considers that the Court’s findings provide some guidance as to the meaning and

content of Ecuadorian law governing contracts dealing with the exploitation of hydrocarbon

resources. Accordingly, the Tribunal seeks to apply Ecuadorian law consistently with the

Court’s findings, mindful of what the Court did and did not decide.>”°

The Tribunal is also cognisant of the fact that while the Participation Contracts vested a
jurisdiction in the Tribunal to decide certain types of disputes, they also conferred jurisdiction

over other types of disputes on the Ecuadorian courts.°”° The Tribunal has already held that it
does not have jurisdiction over constitutional matters, which are “essentially legal matters.”*?7
It is not open to the Tribunal to second-guess the Ecuadorian courts’ determination and

application of Ecuadorian law in relation to such legal matters.

The submissions of the Parties

(1) The Claimant’s Position

Perenco submitted that Law 42’s enactment and enforcement unilaterally amended key terms
of the Participation Contracts in breach of its provisions permitting modification by way of
agreement only. °°8 The Contracts were governed by the pacta sunt servanda principle, a
principle recognised in Ecuadorian law and incorporated in the Contracts by way of reference

to Article 1561 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code and Article 31.1 of the Hydrocarbons Law.”

The Tribunal is alive to the nature and subject of the claims confronted by the Constitutional Court. The Court
was asked to consider whether Law 42 violated any of the following constitutional norms and the consequences
thereto: legal security, equality, non-retroactivity, respect for the hierarchy of laws, protection of property rights
and observance of procedural formalities in its enactment. See Exhibit CA-313, Constitutional Tribunal’s
Decision on Law 42.

For example, clause 22.1.2 of the Block 7 Participation Contract provides that for claims which arise due to the
acts or resolutions of the Ministry of Energy and Mines the Contractor may initiate claims or appeals before the
local courts (Exhibit CE-17, PER 04859).

Amended Request, paragraph 37; Revised Memorial, paragraphs 201-211; Reply, paragraphs 434-485.

Revised Memorial, paragraphs 201-202. Article 1561 of the Civil Code in Ecuador provides that “[e]very contract
lawfully executed is law between the parties and cannot be invalidated unless it be by mutual consent of the
parties or for legal causes.” (CA-43, Civil Code, p 13). Clause 22.1 of the Participation Contracts provided that
Ecuadorian legislation applied to them (Exhibits CE-17, Block 7 Participation Contract, PER 04858, and CE-10,
Block 21 Participation Contract, PER 04722). Article 31.1 of the Hydrocarbons Law provides that “[a]t the State’s
discretion, contracts for the exploration and use of hydrocarbons may be modified by an agreement of the
contracting parties, and upon approval by the Special Bidding Committee (CEL)... (Exhibit CE-37 (Resubmitted
on 04-12-12), Hydrocarbons Law, Decree 2967 of the Supreme Government Council (in Spanish with additional
translated excerpt), PER 01542.1).

335.

The principle was incorporated expressly in the Contracts’ clause 15.2 which provided that any

amendment required the mutual agreement of the parties.>?

Perenco argued that by applying Law 42 and related measures to the Contracts, Ecuador
breached this principle because it “effectively modified the Participation Contracts’ economic
terms.”**! The participation it was entitled to receive and freely dispose of as a result of the
operation of clause 8.1 of the Contracts constituted its “gross income”, and as a result, formed
the “fundamental economic term” of the Contracts.*” This economic term ensured that both
the Contractor and the State had the potential to benefit from increasing oil prices; “the State
both through its own Participation percentage and also through the additional tax revenues and
other benefits that Perenco paid.”°*? Law 42, however, was intended to, and in effect did,
allocate the benefits of increasing oil prices “almost exclusively to the State, and took them
away from Perenco.” °M Tt created “an additional right for Ecuador (and a corresponding
additional obligation on Perenco) that the Contracts simply did not grant it.” °35 Perenco
submitted that this amounted to a breach of the Contracts’ economic terms.**° It was a
unilateral modification of the Contracts where Ecuadorian law (as incorporated by reference
into the Contracts) and the Contracts themselves required any amendment to be by agreement

of the parties.°*”

Perenco’s rebuttal to the contention that Law 42 was at best “‘an additional charge of some kind

7538

outside the contractual frameworl was that it ignored the fact that the types of income

accruing to the State from oil activities set out in each Contract was a closed list. Article 44 of

the Hydrocarbons Law identified the potential forms of income the State could derive from oil

exploitation activities, and this was then reflected with greater particularity in the case of the
Participation Contracts.*” Perenco submitted that “[iJn fact, every one of the potential sources
of State income [was] addressed in the Contracts either to require some payment or exempt the
Contractor from paying anything in respect of that item.” 4° The Contracts thus
comprehensively set out the Contractor’s payment obligations and Law 42, by “creat[ing] for
the State an additional source of potential income not previously contemplated in the
Hydrocarbons Law or the Contracts”, contravened the parties’ agreement.™!

Perenco acknowledged that while Article 44 of the Hydrocarbons Law could be amended, such
amendment was not automatically reflected in the Contracts which, as a result of the pacta sunt
servanda principle and the terms of the Contracts themselves, required any amendment to be

strictly by agreement.”

Perenco further submitted that the Contracts obliged Ecuador to negotiate a correction factor in

the event that any measures it took upset the economy of the Contracts.*“? This was not done.

Perenco also contended that the principle of pacta sunt servanda could not be displaced by
any, as it put it, ‘administrative law doctrine of ‘extraordinary powers’”, and if it could, “any
such doctrine would require payment of full compensation to the contractor if the changes

affect the economic terms of the agreement, which has not been offered much less paid

here.

It similarly rejected any justification by Ecuador on the basis of the rebus sic stantibus — or

extreme hardship — principle.’ The circumstances that ostensibly required the enactment of

rebus sic stantibus doctrine does not apply to the Participation Contracts for a number of reasons, and could not

paragraphs 38, 91 (explaining that the administration’s jus variandi cannot apply to deprive the contractor of the

Law 42 were not unforeseeable since “price fluctuations were specifically discussed during the
Block 7 negotiations” during which the parties agreed “not to include a price band mechanism
that would have increased the State’s participation percentage for revenues above a reference
price.”“° Ecuador benefitted greatly from Perenco’s investment and the high price of oil. As a
result, it cannot claim that continued performance of the Contracts under these circumstances
would have been “excessively” or “unreasonably more burdensome.”**” Finally, if made out,
the principle entitles the invoking party to seek a renegotiation of the contract terms or, if such
renegotiation should fail, a decision from the competent court or tribunal to readjust the terms
of the contract or rescind it.*“* Ecuador similarly failed to meet this requirement; it did not seek

a negotiation or, failing that, a judicial solution.”

Finally, Perenco submitted that Ecuador’s “relentless efforts to apply Law 42 eventually led it
to breach other aspects of the Contracts”, namely, Perenco’s right to freely dispose of and
market its share of crude through the State’s seizure of Perenco’s oil through the coactivas®”
and its right to operate the Blocks with the State’s forcible seizure and subsequent declaration
of caducidad in 2009.**' In this connection, it argued that Ecuador committed a further breach

of contract in failing to comply with the Decision on Provisional Measures.*”

Perenco further submitted that by exempting the application of Law 42 to another contractor
operating in Ecuador, Andes Petroleum, with respect to its Tarapoa Block Participation

Contract with Ecuador, Ecuador breached its contractual undertaking under clause 5.1.28 of

the Block 7 Participation Contract not to discriminate between “Participation Contractors for

the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons”.* st

(2) The Respondent’s Position

Ecuador submitted that on a true construction of the Participation Contracts and correct
application of Ecuadorian law, Law 42 and its Implementing Regulations cannot be said to

have breached the Participation Contracts.*°

The only guarantee that the Participation Contracts offered to the Claimant was “participation”
in the form of an entitlement to a physical share in the oil produced.**° Clause 4.2 (of both
Contracts) stipulated that the Contractor would receive a “percentage of the Measured
Production as compensation” and this percentage was in turn determined using the formula set
out in clause 8.1.°°” Ecuador further relied on clause 5.3.2 of the Contracts in submitting that
the “Contractor’s right under the Participation Contract was no more and no less than to

‘[rleceive the Contractor’s Share of the Production at the Inspection and Delivery Center and

freely dispose of the Contractor’s Share of Production.’”>°®

Ecuador argued that Perenco cannot, in the face of a true construction of these contractual
terms, reasonably claim a guarantee to a certain allocation of profit. 5° The purpose and
express wording of clause 8.2 of the Contracts supported its interpretation of key terms of the
Contracts. Clause 8.2 reflected the “Parties’ agreement to fix, for income tax purposes, the

gross income deemed to have been generated by the Contractor...Clause 8.2 thus provided: The

Reply, paragraphs 496-501. Clause 5.1.28 of the Block 7 Participation Contract provides “The Parties understand
that the treatment received by the Contractor both by the Government of Ecuador as well as by
PETROECUADOR shall not be less favorable than that in similar conditions by other Participation Contractors
for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons.” (Exhibit CE-17, Block 7 Participation Contract, PER PER
04772). The Tribunal notes that Perenco in its Reply indicated it was not going to pursue its claim of
discrimination under the Treaty: Reply, paragraph 5.

Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 384, 395; Rejoinder, section 4.1.2. Ecuador admitted that the prospect of
adjustment factors in the Contracts to the Parties’ respective participation percentages suggested that “Perenco had
protection that its Share of Production would generate for it at least the ex ante long term average return on cost of
capital.” (Rejoinder, paragraph 369).

Contractor’s Share of Production, calculated as an annual average at actual sales prices,
which will in no case be less than the Reference Price, plus other income from the
Contractor’s activities related to this Contract, will constitute the gross income of the
Contractor under the terms of this Contract, from which all applicable deductions will be
taken and on which income tax will be paid in accordance with the provisions of Clauses
eleven point one (11.1) and eleven point two (11.2).°

In Ecuador’s submission, this suggested that the Contracts did not intend to realize a
guaranteed quantum of gross income in favour of the Contractor since it had to create an
artificial construct for income tax purposes and, moreover, the State remained at liberty to
apply a rate of tax to the gross income as it saw fit!

Alternatively, Ecuador submitted that even if clause 8.2 did guarantee a certain gross income,
Law 42 did not alter clause 8.2 since it did not modify the formula for calculating the
Contractor’s gross income, and in this way cannot be said to have operated to breach clause

8.2.58

Ecuador similarly rejected Perenco’s claim in relation to the triggering of the renegotiation
clause in the Participation Contracts.** It submitted that it was not triggered because Law 42

and its Implementing Regulations did not upset the economy of the Participation Contracts.**

Clauses 8.6 and 11.12 of the Block 7 Contract and 11.7 of Block 21 Contract “caught only

those modifications which ‘have an impact on the economics of” the Contracts and a

correction factor could only be applied to “absorb that ‘impact’ rather than to absorb any

Counter-Memorial, paragraph 395(iii). The Claimant in its Reply noted that this submission taken to its logical
limits suggested that “there was nothing to stop Ecuador from taking away all of Perenco’s economic benefit
under the Contracts. On Ecuador’s argument, it could have taken 100% of all revenue from oil production
(without even a reference price threshold), and yet not have breached the Contracts in the slightest.” (Reply,
paragraph 450 [Emphasis in original.]).

general increase in the tax burden on the Contractor.”*° Ecuador’s position was that clause
11.12/11.7 did not “operate as a stabilisation measure which absorbed any increased tax burden
on the Contractor.”*°

Ecuador contended in this regard that Perenco had failed to discharge its burden of
demonstrating that Law 42 and its Implementing Regulations had an impact on the economy of
the Participation Contracts, and what the appropriate adjustment would have been.*” In fact,
Perenco “offered no evidence as to the meaning of ‘economics of this Contract’ as a matter of
Ecuadorian law”, much less adduced expert or other evidence to show Law 42’s impact on the
Participation Contract’s economics (as understood when the Participation Contracts were
signed).°°*

In Ecuador’s view, the “relevant enquiry [was] whether that measure impacted the long-term
average oil price expectations upon which the Contractor’s Share of Production in Clause 8 of
the Participation Contracts was set such that, all things being equal, those X factors would
continue to generate an IRR of around 15%.” It pointed to evidence that suggested that the
Law 42 reference prices were at all times set above the US$ 15/bbl mark, which it argued was
the basis of the economic modeling undertaken in the negotiation of both contracts, and which

could be found in the calculation attached to the Block 7 Participation Contract as Annex vi”

Counter-Memorial, paragraph 390 [Emphasis in original.]. The Claimant responded to this in its Reply,
contending that it was a selective reading of clause 11.12/11.7: “Ecuador’s argument that the correction factor
must ‘absorb that ‘impact’ [on the economics of the Contracts] rather than to absorb any general increase in the
tax burden on the Contractor’ (ECM, paragraph 390, emphasis in original) inverts the plain language of the
Contracts: Clause 11.12 provides, to the contrary, that the correction factor must ‘absorb the impact of the
increase or decrease in the tax . .. burden’” (Reply, paragraph 465 [Emphasis in original.]).

Counter-Memorial, paragraph 405.

Rejoinder, paragraph 383.

Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 414-419; Rejoinder, section 4.2.1. The Claimant responded that this ignored that
there existed a specific mathematical economic equation expressly set out in clause 8.1 of the Contracts, and this
did not identify US$ 15/bbl as its premise. Clause 8.1 was a self-contained representation of the ‘economy’ or
‘equilibrium’ of the Contracts and this was confirmed by the fact that if a correction factor was to be applied to
the Contracts as a result of a change in tax which impacted the economy of the Contracts, it would be applied to
clause 8.1. See Reply, paragraphs 469-471. The Claimant submitted that Annex V did not purport to be a
statement of the ‘economy’ of the Contract, its purpose only extended as far as demonstrating that it was in the
interest of the State to convert to participation contracts: Reply, paragraph 473. The Claimant similarly argued
vigorously against the imputation of Annex V, which was drawn up in connection with the Block 7 Contract, into
the operation of the Block 21 Contract: “It cannot be the case that the ‘economy’ of the Block 21 Contract is

105

 

351.

The reference prices for Blocks 7 and 21 at the time of execution of the Contracts were fixed
by the Ministry of Energy and Mines at, respectively, US$ 25.111383/bbl and US$
15.358274/bbl.>7! Moreover, there were instances, such as in 2006, as reflected in the Oso
Development Plan, that “Perenco’s own economic projections

below the Law 42 reference price.”°”? This and the 15-20% IRR identified in the 7th Bidding

 

were premised on a price/bbl

Round, which was representative of the ex ante long term economic assumptions underpinning
the Participation Contracts, were preserved in the application of Law 42 and its Implementing
Regulations.”

In any event, assuming arguendo that Law 42 did affect the economy of the Contracts,
Ecuador submitted that the renegotiation provisions at best imposed on the parties an
obligation to negotiate and Perenco bore the burden of proving that the failure to agree to a
correction factor was Ecuador’s fault.°”* Perenco is “put to proof on the issue of causation”.°”>
Ecuador claims it cannot because it failed to “take the most basic steps required even to
invoke” the clauses and then failed to secure its Consortium-partner’s consent to the agreement

that resulted from the negotiations conducted in 2009.57

contained in a non-existent annex. Still less can it be true that an annex to a different contract, with a different
purpose and in different circumstances, drawn up four years after the Block 21 Contract was concluded,
establishes the ‘economy’ of the Block 21 Contract ‘at the time of contracting,’ as Ecuador claims.” [Emphasis in
original.] (Reply, paragraph 475). In its Rejoinder, Ecuador responded by asserting that clause 8.1 was clearly
“the product” of the parameters considered and debated in the 7th Bidding Round, and for this reason the price
assumption was constitutive of the mathematical-economic equation of the Contracts: Rejoinder, paragraph 381.

enclosures.

 

Counter-Memorial, paragraph 420 [Emphasis in original. ].

Rejoinder, section 4.2.1, in particular paragraphs 397-400. In its Rejoinder, Ecuador submitted there was a
fundamental flaw in the economic analysis undertaken by Perenco’s expert; it ignored that Perenco had been
enjoying a price upside from the beginning of the Block 7 and 21 phases till Law 42 entered into force, and
assumed that Law 42 and Decree 662 operated retroactively: Rejoinder, paragraphs 401-404.

 

Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 422-423. The Claimant for its part had a different interpretation regarding on
whom the burden of the renegotiation provisions rested; “The adjustment clauses create a clear obligation of result
on Ecuador: to modify the Contracts to include a correction factor to absorb the consequences of Law 42 on
Perenco. This obligation has nothing to do with a mere obligation to negotiate for an uncertain result.” (Reply,
paragraph 489). See also, Rejoinder, section 4.3.

Counter-Memorial, paragraph 423.

 

 

Counter-Memorial, paragraph 424. The Claimant responded to this in its Reply; it submitted that the 2009
negotiations were not “aimed at agreeing a ‘correction factor’ to the Clause 8 participation formulae but rather at
terminating the Participation Contracts altogether and moving to a services contract” and that it did not fail to
provide the figures but was not required to do so until the process was initiated by Ecuador which the latter failed
to do (Reply, paragraph 487). See also, Reply, paragraphs 490-494. The bottom-line for the Claimant was that the

Ecuador similarly denied any suggestion by Perenco that clause 22.1 of the Contracts operated
as a stabilisation clause.°”’ Rather, that clause must be read as providing that the Contracts “are
governed by Ecuadorian legislation ‘and’ such laws as were then in force” at the time the
Participation Contracts were concluded “were incorporated by reference”.°”* If this clause was
a stabilisation clause, it would render nugatory the renegotiation mechanism of clauses 8.6 and
11.12 of the Block 7 Contract and 11.7 of the Block 21 Contract, which were triggered with an

amendment to Ecuadorian law that had an impact on the economy of the Contracts.*”

Moreover, the clauses cannot be stabilisation clauses because under Ecuadorian law a
stabilisation clause requires the State “to have expressly excluded the application of laws/and
or regulations enacted after the date of the execution of the contracts”, and the clause mirrors a
provision in Article 7(18) of the Ecuadorian Civil Code, which means that to find that they are
stabilisation clauses would suggest that all contracts governed by Ecuadorian law are governed

by its law as frozen at the time of entry into the contract.**°

Finally, Ecuador denied having committed any breach of contract in connection with the
Decision on Provisional Measures. It contended that while the parties undertook in the
Contracts to submit specified disputes to ICSID arbitration and to abide by a tribunal’s “final
award”, they did not undertake to, and these obligations could not inferentially amount to an

undertaking to, comply with a tribunal’s recommendation of provisional measures."

On the matter of Andes Petroleum and the contractual claim under clause 5.1.28 of the Block 7
Contract, Ecuador sought the claim’s dismissal in the first instance because it was introduced

late.**? It was raised for the first time by the Claimant in its Reply; it was not canvassed in its

 

577

579

582

failure to reach an amicable solution was due to Ecuador’s conduct; its conduct in negotiations was “inconsistent
and increasingly adamant” and “Ecuador among other things terminated negotiations, rebuffed comments from
Perenco, and publicly announced that it would take over Perenco’s operations and seize its oil.” (Reply, paragraph
494).

Request, Memorial or Revised Memorial.*** Ecuador submitted in the alternative that Perenco
had failed to discharge its burden of proof in making out this claim, namely that it had failed to
demonstrate that Perenco and Andes were in “similar conditions” (the term used in clause
5.1.28), that there was no credible justification for differing treatment and that there was an

intention on the part of the state to favour Andes Petroleum in the Tarapoa Block Contract.°*4

The Tribunal’s Decision

(LD) The salient terms of the Participation Contracts

The Tribunal begins by noting certain basic features of the Contracts that bear on the contract
dispute. Both Contracts were negotiated within the broader context of Ecuadorian law. Clause
22.1 (in both Contracts) stated that the Contract was governed exclusively by Ecuadorian
legislation, and the laws in force at the time of its execution were understood to be
incorporated in it. The “Legal Framework” then set out a non-exhaustive list of “legal
standards” applicable to the Contract (including the Hydrocarbons Law, the Law amending the

Hydrocarbons Law and various regulations pertaining thereto, as well as certain other general

Ecuadorian laws).>°°

Both Participation Contracts contained an exorbitant clause recognising the Ministry of Energy
and Mines’ power to declare caducidad for the reasons and under the procedure established in

Articles 74-76 of the Hydrocarbons Law. 587 (The presence of such a clause was, as the

Claimant’s Ecuadorian law expert acknowledged, an indication of the existence of an

administrative contract.***)

Insofar as interpretative guidance was given by the parties, clause 3.1 of each Contract stated
that the Contract was to be interpreted “in accordance with the provisions of Title XIII,
Volume IV of the Civil Code of Ecuador...” Article 1561 of the Civil Code provides that:

“All contracts legally entered into are law for the parties, and can only be invalidated by

mutual consent or on legal grounds.”*”°

Both the Hydrocarbons Law and the Participation Contracts required the mutual consent of the
parties to amend the contracts. Article 31-A of Hydrocarbons Law established that oil contracts
may be amended, if that is in the interests of the State, provided that, among other things, the
contractor’s consent is obtained.*! This statutory premise was subsequently reflected in the

Contracts themselves.**

Both Contracts contained a volume sharing formula as well as other provisions aimed at
preserving the parties’ respective shares of production. Clause 8 of the Block 7 Contract, the
“Participation and Delivery Procedures” clause, for example, contained an “economic

stability” clause tied to potential modifications of the tax regime:

8.6 Economic stability: If, due to acts of the Ecuadorian Government, or
PETROECUADOR, any of the events described below should occur, that has
consequences for the economy of this Contract, a correction factor shall be
included in the participation percentages that absorbs the increase or decrease in
the economic burden:

a) Modification of the tax regime, as described in clause 11.12... 593

The parties also addressed the relationship between taxation measures and their respective
shares of production. Clause 11, paragraphs 1 to 11 in the Block 7 Contract (and clause 11,
paragraphs | to 6 of the Block 21 Contract) contained a comprehensive list of fiscal measures
and was clearly designed to operate such that if a new tax was implemented, or an existing tax
was changed, the right to seek a modification of the Contract would be triggered. This is made
clear by the final provision of clause 11.12 of the Block 7 Contract (clause 11.7 of the Block

21 Contract) which provides:

11.12 Modification to the tax regime. Jn the event of a modification to the tax
regime or the creation or elimination of new taxes not foreseen in this Contract...
on the signature date of this Contract and as described in this Clause, or their
interpretation, which have consequences for the economy of this Contract, a
correction factor shall be included in the participation percentages, which
absorbs the increase or decrease in the tax burden...This correction factor shall
be calculated between the Parties and following the procedure set forth in Article
thirty-one (31) of the Regulations for Application of the Law Amending the
Hydrocarbons Law.*”*

By their own terms, clauses 11.7 and 11.12 of the two Contracts did not preclude the State

from introducing new taxes or modifying existing ones, but in the event that such measures

were introduced that had “consequences for the economy of” the Contract, the obligation arose

to negotiate a “correction factor” that would absorb the increase or decrease in the tax burden.
Clauses 15.2, entitled “Contractual Amendments”, stated in this regard:

15.2 Contractual amendments: The negotiation and signing of amending
contracts shall take place, by agreement of the Parties, particularly in the
following cases:

c) When the tax or currency exchange regime or labor participation applicable to
this type of Contract in the country has been amended, in order to reestablish the
economy of this Contract, in conformity with clause 11.11.°°*

The inclusion of the tax modification and contractual amendment clauses thus reflected the
parties’ agreement, noted above, to list the applicable taxes, encumbrances, employee profit

sharing and contributions that would be required of the contractor.

Two points about the foregoing clauses warrant note. First, the predicate for the introduction of
any correction factor was the demonstration (and subsequent agreement of the parties) that the
new or modified tax had “consequences for the economy” of the contract; a new or modified
tax that did not have such consequences would not require a correction factor. Second, clause
11 did not stipulate how the correction factor would be calculated, because the precise nature
of a future or modified tax and its potential effect on the Contract could not be known at the
time of contracting. Clause 11 did stipulate the ultimate result, namely, a change in the parties’
respective participations “which absorbs the increase or decrease in the tax burden.” The
process envisaged was one of the negotiation in good faith of a mutually agreeable offset that

would result in an amended contract.

While these clauses were clearly designed to protect the contractual bargain, in the Tribunal’s
view they do not constitute stabilisation clauses per se. By their own terms (e.g. in “the event
of a modification to the tax regime or the creation ... of new taxes not foreseen in this
Contract...”) the Contracts plainly did not purport to freeze Ecuadorian law as at the time of

their signing and prohibit the State from modifying the tax regime.

Exhibits CE-17, Block 7 Participation Contract, PER 04829, and CE-10, Block 21 Participation Contract, PER
04703. The reference to clause 11.11 appears to be in error; it should be a reference to clause 11.12.

In this connection the Respondent pointed out that Ecuadorian legal practice contains examples
of stabilisation agreements and they expressly require the State to exclude the application of
laws and regulations enacted after the date of the contract’s signing. The Participation
Contracts at issue in this case do not do that.°*° Moreover, the Constitutional Court held that
the “renunciation of exercise [of the State’s power to modify or reform administrative
contracts] must be made expressly in the corresponding administrative contract”.°”” As noted,

there is no such waiver in either Contract.

The final notable feature of the Contracts is that both contained a broadly worded agreement
that the “Parties undertake to use the means set forth in this Contract to resolve doubts and
disputes that may arise during its life...”.°8 The inclusion of the word “doubts”, combined
with the jurisdiction to resolve “economic” disputes, indicates to the Tribunal that the parties
wished to ensure that disputes such as the present one could be put before a tribunal such as the

present one.

(2) Did Law 42 amend, modify or change the legal framework applying to the
Participation Contracts?

Although Perenco contended that Law 42 amended the Contracts, its pleadings also embraced
the possibility that this was not the case. In its Reply, Perenco maintained its primary position
that Law 42 unilaterally amended key terms of the Contract, whether by direct amendment or
by indirect amendment with the creation of additional contractual rights that took away from
the benefit of performing key terms.” It also argued, in the alternative, that Law 42 was an
amendment “in effect even if not in terms.”°?

This alternative characterisation of what was effected by Law 42 was — to the Tribunal’s mind

rightly — a recognition that Petroecuador, the company’s contractual counterparty, did not

unilaterally amend the Contracts and therefore did not breach the Contracts’ provisions

requiring mutual agreement to any amendment of their terms.

That however is not the end of the matter. The fact that Petroecuador, as the nominal
counterparty to Perenco, did not itself purport to amend the Contracts does not mean that the
State did not modify their operation by other means. Law 42 required the contractor to pay to
the State a newly declared “participation in windfalls from oil prices not negotiated or
anticipated.”©! In doing so, it effectively modified the operation of clauses 5.3.2 (the right to
receive the Contractor’s share of the production at the Fiscalization and Delivery Center and to
“freely dispose of” that share), 8.2.1 (the Contractor’s right to opt to receive its share in cash),
and 10.2 (the Contractor’s right to market the production that belongs to it on the domestic or
foreign market) of the Block 7 Participation Contract (and the corresponding clauses of the

Block 21 Participation Contract).

The Tribunal is fortified in its conclusion that this was a modification of the Participation
Contracts’ operation by the Constitutional Court’s discussion of the pacta sunt servanda rule,
where the Court described Law 42 as an exercise of “the power to modify or revise the

agreement... £7,698

 

Article 44 of the Hydrocarbons Law was replaced by the following: "At the very least the State will receive the
following for the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbon deposits: access premiums, surface rights, royalties,
remediation payments, investments in remediation works, participation in surplus from oil sale prices, and for
transportation, a share of rates.” Article 55 was amended to add the following clause: "State participation in
surplus from oil sale prices not negotiated or anticipated. The contracting companies that maintain participation
contracts for the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbon contracts in force with the Ecuadorian State in
accordance with this law, without prejudice to the volume of crude oil from participation corresponding to it,
whenever the actual average monthly FOB sale price of Ecuadorian crude oil exceeds the monthly average sale
price in force on the date that the contract is signed, and expressed in amounts from the settlement month, will
recognize participation by the Ecuadorian State of at least 50% of the surplus generated by the difference in price.
For the purposes of this article, extraordinary profits are understood to mean the described difference in price
multiplied by the number of barrels produced. The crude price on the contract date used as a reference for
calculating the difference will be adjusted by the US Consumer Price Index published by the Central Bank of
Ecuador." (Exhibit CA-313, Constitutional Tribunal’s Decision on Law 42, pp 23-24).

Technically, as Dr. Pérez Loose pointed out, this was an “act of the prince” (factum principis),
i.e., an intervention by branches of government other than the contractual counterparty which

changed the conditions pursuant to which Perenco performed the Contracts.

It follows from this finding that the Tribunal cannot accept Ecuador’s argument that since Law
42 addressed revenues, not participation shares, it therefore addressed a matter which fell
completely outside of the Contracts. Until Law 42, the contractor was free not only to take
legal title to its share of the production, but also to sell it on the market or take cash in lieu of
oil. Law 42 created a new claim by the State to additional revenue above a new reference price
and a correlative obligation on the part of the contractor to pay that revenue to the State. This

indeed was a ‘conceptual modification’ of the Contracts, to use Mr. Silva Romero’s term.°°

(3) Did Law 42 fall within the scope of the taxation modification clauses?

As an amendment to the most directly relevant statute listed in the Contracts’ legal framework,
namely, the Hydrocarbons Law, the question arises as to whether Law 42 was a tax and
therefore caught by the taxation modification clauses of the Contracts. Perenco argued the
point both ways, arguing that Law 42 was not a tax as understood by Ecuadorian law, but in
the alternative, if it was, it was caught by the Contracts’ tax modification clauses, which
required an adjustment of the parties’ participations in its favour.°” For its part, Ecuador
argued that the Law 42 dues should be treated as a “tax” or a “levy.”

The evidence goes both ways: (i) Ecuador’s Attorney General argued before the Constitutional
Court that Law 42 was not a tax, but rather an amendment to the Hydrocarbons Law (which it

plainly was; that said, in exacting a fiscal charge from private contractors it did not follow the

1“ Expert Report of Hernan Pérez Loose, paragraph 43 and footnote 52. He noted further that the fact that this was
done by the legislature as opposed to the contractual counterparty was immaterial as far as the conditions
prescribed by Ecuadorian law for the exercise of the jus variandi power were concerned.

means prescribed by Ecuadorian law for the enactment of a taxation law);°? (ii) Law 42
created an obligation under Ecuadorian law to pay revenues to the State; (iii) after the law was
ruled to be constitutional, Perenco’s letters to Petroecuador described Law 42 dues as a “tax”,
and requested the initiation of the tax modification procedures pursuant to the Contracts;“"” (iv)
although the evidence is inconclusive, it does not appear that at that time, Petroecuador took
the position that such clauses were inapplicable because Law 42 dues were not taxes; and (v)
when it came to the two ICSID cases, Ecuador characterised Law 42 as a tax or “levy.70!!

On balance, having regard to its economic effect, the fact that it mandated the payment of
monies to the State in accordance with a specified formula, and Perenco’s contemporaneous
characterisation of Law 42 as a tax to which the taxation modification clauses of the Contracts

applied, the Tribunal considers that Law 42 should be treated as a taxation measure.

Accordingly, Law 42 modified the tax regime governing the Participation Contracts with the
result that Perenco was entitled to require Petroecuador to engage in negotiations to determine
Law 42’s effect on the economy of the Contracts and to arrive at a consequent correction factor

(in the event the parties agreed that the tax affected the economy of the Contract).

(4) The request for negotiations

In letters dated 18 December 2006, Perenco requested Petroecuador to “order the

commencement of the corresponding administrative process...for which the Consortium will

present the numbers which illustrate said economic impact on the Contract. Such figures

would demonstrate Law 42’s impact “in order to determine the percentage of participation

law, it has the same fate, and the Hydrocarbon Law is in no way a tax law[.]”

which should be adjusted in favor of the Contractor.”°'* These letters were sent to the Palacios

Administration days before it was about to leave office.

380. It is common ground that there was no official response to this request. There is no
contemporaneous document evidencing either the outgoing Palacios Administration’s or
indeed the incoming Correa Administration’s rejection (or acceptance for that matter) of

Perenco’s request.

381. During the hearing, Mr. Laurent Combe was cross-examined on the reasons for the making of

this request and the company’s perception of the unofficial reaction occasioned by the letters:

... Previously, during August 2006, we had successful negotiation with the tax
authorities to adjust the “X” Factors for a change in the VAT.

So, we thought at the end of 2006 we might want to try the same avenue and see
whether the Government would be more responsive to this kind of argument than
just an argument of non-constitutionality. So, that’s why we were going through
this. We were feeling the door — - feeling the water, sorry, try to get through that
avenue, but at the time things were quite tense, so we didn’t want to be too
confrontational, which is we [sic] sent the letter, we never had any feedback,
official feedback, we had informal feedback, so we felt that just sending the
numbers like this without having a proper response from Petroecuador would
have been too confrontational, which is why we never sent the data.°!*

382. Mr. Combe then adverted to the impending change of personnel as a result of the governmental

transition and the company’s decision to temporise in the fact of a change of administrations:

“What I was about to say is, there was a change in administration in 2007, so
actually there were new people coming, so the people that received that letter
were probably not the people that were in place later on, and there was a lot of
confusion, a lot of things happening, and we had informal feedback that the letter
wasn’t well-received, so we thought that it would be prudent to wait a little bit to
see whether things would settle down so we could arrange a talk.”°'°

383. Mr. Combe did confirm that the study to which the 18 December 2007 letters referred was in

fact performed by Perenco,°"° but testified that it was not submitted to Petroecuador to show

the company’s view of Law 42’s impact upon the economy of the Contracts.°'” The disputing
Parties agree that after the letters of 18 December 2006, no further steps were taken by Perenco
in relation to its request nor did the new administration propose clause 11 taxation modification

negotiations in early 2007.5!

(5) Did Perenco sufficiently test the taxation modification process when Law 42 was
applied at 50%?

The existence of a taxation modification process is of pivotal importance in considering
Perenco’s claim that Law 42 at 50% breached the two Contracts. Clause 11 of both Contracts
provided the parties, in this case Perenco, with a means to subject new or modified taxes to a
negotiating process that could lead to an adjustment of their respective entitlements. Given the
fact that the process’ initiation was requested but nothing happened thereafter, the Tribunal
must decide who bears responsibility for this state of affairs and what legal consequences

follow. Put simply, did Perenco do enough?

Having reflected on the precise terms of the Contracts and all of the relevant circumstances, the
Tribunal considers that since Perenco contended that Law 42 had an impact on its Contracts’
economy (a view not shared by President Palacios when he described Law 42’s effect to the
Congress), it was incumbent upon Perenco to fully pursue the clause 11 remedy. To succeed on
this part of its breach of contract claim, Perenco must: (i) satisfy the Tribunal that it took
sufficient steps to press for negotiations, or alternatively, that it was futile to press the new
administration to engage in taxation modification negotiations; or (ii) had such negotiations
occurred with all relevant documentation submitted and the disturbance of the Contracts’

economy proven, the State then refused to engage in good faith adjustment of the Contracts.

At the hearing, when asked by a member of this Tribunal whether he considered it was futile to
invoke clause 11, counsel stated that that was the Claimant’s position.” For its part, Ecuador’s
view was that Perenco having stated its intention to deliver the economic case in favour of the
Mr. Combe testified that for its part, Perenco expected “an acknowledgment of that letter” and “nomination of the

focal point so we could...[present] numbers” before matters proceeded further: Transcript, Hearing on Merits,
Day 2, pp 530-531 (Testimony of Laurent Combe).

On Perenco’s part, see Mr. Combe’s testimony: Transcript, Hearing on Merits, Day 2, p 524 (“We never sent
another letter in these terms.”).

Contracts’ readjustment, thereafter did not act on that intention because it recognised that their
economy had not been disturbed by the establishment of a reference price above US$ 15/barrel
and a continued entitlement to 50% of the so-called “extraordinary revenues.” °° Perenco’s
riposte was that it was not necessary to do so until the administrative process was formally

on: 2
launched, which it never was.°?!

It is undisputed that Perenco did take the first step of requesting negotiations. It is also
undisputed that it prepared the study to support its claim that the Contracts’ economy had been
disturbed, but it did not submit the study to Petroecuador. It is also apparent that although there
was never any “official feedback” from the outgoing administration, there was informal
feedback that the letter was not “well-received.”°” Finally, it is undisputed that the newly
appointed officials of the incoming administration were not contacted by Perenco with a view
to asking the administration to act on the request recently made of its predecessor. As Mr.
Combe stated forthrightly, based on the unofficial reaction (of unidentified officials), Perenco
“.,.thought that it would be prudent to wait a little bit to see whether things would settle down

so we could arrange a talk.”°

   

Although it is a close call, in the Tribunal’s view, insufficient contemporaneous evidence was
adduced by the Claimant in support of the claimed futility of pressing for taxation modification

negotiations.

The evidence against Perenco’s claim of futility is first, the company’s then recent experience
in successfully using the modification clause, second, the absence of any official rejection of
the request at a time of transition in government, and third, Perenco’s contemporaneous

evaluation of the situation in Ecuador.

In terms of its prior experience with the remedy, Perenco’s Block 7 letter referred to the
parties’ then-recent experience with the “[i]ncrease in the Amazon Region Ecodevelopment

Tax” with respect to the Block 21 Contract and expressed Perenco’s view as to what would

occur in relation to the Law 42 “tax” with respect to the Block 7 Contract.°™* At the hearing,
Mr. Combe noted that in August of 2006, four months prior to the 18 December letters, “we
had successful negotiation with the tax authorities to adjust the “X’ Factors for a change in the
VAT.” The remedy was thus acknowledged to have been effective in August 2006 (a time
when Law 42 had already been enacted and applied and the constitutional challenge was

underway).

As for the absence of any official rejection of the requests, the Tribunal notes two points. First,
the Tribunal considers it to be unrealistic to think that the outgoing administration could
resolve a taxation modification negotiations request submitted in the final days of its time in
office. Mr. Combe himself recognised that with a change in administrations came a change in
government representatives (“...there was a change in administration in 2007, so actually there
were new people coming, so the people that received that letter were probably not the people
that were in place later on, and there was a lot of confusion, a lot of things happening”).
Second, although Perenco stated that it would forward the necessary economic data in support
of its request for an adjustment of participation, it did not do so either while the Palacios

administration was still in office or after it was succeeded by the Correa administration.

Finally, the Tribunal considers that it is important not to permit subsequent events to colour an
appraisal of the situation in early 2007. Perenco’s request predated, by over ten months, Decree
662 and the steps taken by the Correa administration to force the conversion of participation
contracts into service contracts. There is insufficient contemporaneous evidence before the
Tribunal to lead it to conclude that in January 2007, the new Correa administration would have

rebuffed a request for modification negotiations.

Exhibits E-129, Letter from the Consortium to Petroecuador dated 18 December 2006 (Block 21) (in Spanish with
English translation), section 4.1 and 4.2, and E-130, Letter from the Consortium to Petroecuador dated 18
December 2006 (Block 7) (in Spanish with English translation), section 4.1. In the letter concerning the Block 21
Contract, the increase in the tax (from US$ 0.10 to US$ 0.50 per barrel) was conceded by Ecuador to have an
impact on the “economics of the contract”, this calculation having been done and included in the first Amendment
to the Development Plan for Block 21. The amended development plan expressly provided that the Contractor,
before beginning production in Block 21 under the amended development plan, was required to “present to
Petroecuador for consideration a study to determine the correction factor that would absorb the increase of the tax
burden caused by the increased tax.” (Exhibit E-129, section 4.1)

The Tribunal has no illusions that any such negotiations would have been challenging.
Petroecuador could have been expected to have advanced the Government’s view (expressed

by the former President ®””

) that Law 42 did not have any impact on the economy of the
contracts and the parties would likely have debated the meaning of ‘economy of the contract’
as they have in this proceeding. Had Perenco submitted its study, Petroecuador would no doubt
have scrutinised the company’s financial performance, both prior to and after Law 42’s
enactment, and if Perenco had performed as well as the limited evidence before the present
Tribunal suggests, it can be anticipated that Petroecuador would have pressed it on ‘how much
profit is enough?’°* Much of the evidence that has been led by both Parties in the current
arbitration as to whether or not Law 42 had an impact on the Contracts’ economy, including
the evidence of the pricing and profitability expectations of the original contracting parties at
the time of the Contracts’ making, general industry expectations of returns on investment, and
so on, could be expected to have been discussed. But the challenges of negotiating a
modification cannot be accepted as a basis for deciding not to press the contractual avenue and

cannot support a finding of futility.

In the end, if Perenco wished to rely on clauses 11.12/11.7, respectively, it was incumbent
upon it to make its case with appropriate documentation at that time and its failure to have

done so is fatal to this part of its claim.

The Tribunal has considered whether, Perenco’s having failed to prove the futility of the
modification process at the time, the Tribunal should take on the task of attempting to
substitute itself for the parties in the contractual modification process. After careful reflection,
the Tribunal does not think it necessary or appropriate in the circumstances to pursue the issue

of whether or not Law 42 at 50% affected the economy of the Contracts. It might well have,

At the time that the President submitted Law 42 to the Congress, he asserted that “...all the technical, economic,
and legal parameters considered by the companies in their analysis are being respected, and what is being
legislated upon are those events that never formed a part of the will of the parties, such as the extraordinary
increase in crude oil prices at the international level.” Exhibit CE-50, Bill of the Law amending Hydrocarbons
Law, presented by President Palacio to the President of Congress, 1 March 2006 (in Spanish with English
translation), PER 01721.

In this arbitration, Perenco, as was its right, chose not to engage in that debate, preferring instead to stand on its
view of its contractual rights, which did not explicitly refer to any expected return on investment. In its Reply, the
Claimant characterised these as “assumptions”, “‘variables’ in a hypothetical model” not to be confused with
contractual terms: “Nowhere in the Block 7 or Block 21 Contracts did Oryx ‘agree’ that the contractor’s IRR
would not exceed 15% or 22%.” Reply, paragraph 479.

 

120

396.

397.

398.

629

but if that was what the Claimant considered, the procedure in clauses 11.12 of the Block 7

Contract and 11.7 of the Block 21 Contract was there to be pursued.

The Tribunal’s additional reasons for declining to divine what might have happened in a
negotiation are threefold. First, the taxation modification clauses required the parties to
determine the predicate for making a change to their respective entitlements, i.e. an agreement
that the new or modified tax had an impact on the contract’s economy. They would do so on
the basis of the data submitted by the private contractor in its capacity as the party moving for
a change to the contract. The parties would then determine the tax’s impact on the contract’s
economy and calculate an adjustment to absorb that impact. In the Tribunal’s view, the clauses
dictated the objective, but not the precise means of correction and this could only be
determined through negotiations that arrived at a mutually agreeable outcome (or, if such
negotiations foundered, thereafter by a tribunal armed with all of the relevant documentation

produced by both parties during the negotiations).

This leads to the second point. While, as discussed above at paragraph 393, the Tribunal can
conceive of the kinds of considerations that would have motivated the parties in the
negotiations, with the passage of time and the absence of critical contemporaneous data, it
would be wholly speculative for the Tribunal to try to estimate what the parties would have
done. Based upon the pleadings and expert reports filed in this arbitration, the Tribunal can
make a guess as to the kinds of arguments that both sides would have advanced, but in the end

it is only a guess.

Finally, the single most important piece of evidence that would necessarily have to be
submitted during the negotiations — the analysis that Perenco prepared in order to demonstrate
Law 42’s impact on the Contracts — has not been produced to the Tribunal.” This is the

seminal piece of evidence in the whole evaluative exercise.

Instead of filing this contemporaneous document, Perenco submitted an expert report prepared for this arbitration
by Professor Joseph P. Kalt. The Tribunal did not find that report to be of assistance to its consideration of the
present question because when it came to modelling the impact of Law 42 on Perenco’s 2000 Block 21
Development Plan, for example, Professor Kalt looked at Law 42 as if it had applied at the 99% rate from the date
of Perenco’s acquisition of its interests in the Contracts. This counterfactual analysis shed no light on the actual
situation prevailing from the date of Perenco’s operation of the blocks up to the beginning of 2007 — the period of

121

 

  

399.

400.

401.

402.

In the end, the Tribunal is left with an untested contractual modification process and an
invitation in the form of a breach of contract claim that it insert itself into a negotiation process
that could be conducted only by the parties to the contracts armed with all of the relevant
financial information. The Tribunal considers that given these factors, and without having the
contemporaneous evidence before it, it cannot seek to replicate and adjudge what would have

occurred had Perenco pressed for the modification negotiations.

In sum, the Tribunal holds that: (i) Law 42 fell within the taxation modification clauses of both
Contracts; (ii) as the party claiming that the law had an impact on the Contracts’ economy, it
was incumbent upon Perenco to pursue negotiations with the new administration at least until
they were shown to be futile; and (iii) Perenco did not do so, preferring instead to adopt a ‘wait
and see’ approach with the new Correa Administration. In these circumstances, the Tribunal

does not find a breach of clauses 11.12 and 11.7 of the two Contracts.

The Tribunal recognises that in requiring Perenco to demonstrate futility in order to succeed on
this point it might be regarded as applying too exacting a requirement; but issues such as that
which faced Perenco in late 2006, early 2007 frequently arise in commercial affairs and they
require difficult decisions to be taken. In the end, Perenco chose not to press its rights,
considering instead that it “would be prudent to wait a little bit to see whether things would
settle down so [that it] could arrange a talk.”°° It was of course entitled to do so, but it cannot
then argue that insisting on its clause 11 rights, which had been so recently shown to be
effective, was futile. At the end of the day, the clauses were not tested and found wanting. This

part of Perenco’s claim is therefore dismissed.

(6) Law 42 at 99%

The situation in relation to the application of Decree 662 to Perenco is entirely different
because of the magnitude of the “extraordinary revenues” claimed by the State and the
demands made around the time of the decree’s promulgation and thereafter that Perenco

migrate to a service contract. In this respect, the Tribunal found Dr. Pérez Loose’s analysis of

 

630

time with which the Tribunal is presently concerned. Professor Kalt acknowledged during cross-examination that
he had not performed a calculation of Law 42 at 50%. Transcript, Hearing on Merits, Day 7, p 1646 et seq.

the constraints that Ecuadorian law places on the exercise of the jus variandi power to modify
an administrative contract to be of assistance.°*! Dr. Pérez Loose asserted that the power could

only be exercised in certain ways and subject to certain limits.

The principal such limit, in his view, was that the unilateral power to modify administrative

. . : see . 99633
contracts existed only in relation to their “non-economic aspects. 63

In his view, the power
must therefore be considered to exist only in relation to the performance of the administrative
contract (i.e., the specification of the contractor’s duties) and could not apply to the economic
bargain struck by the parties.°“

Dr. Pérez Loose asserted further that the exercise of the power was subject to four conditions
which he extracted from the writings of civil law theorists such as Ratil Granillo Campo,

Hector Escola, and Miguel Marienhoff*>:

(i) _ the changes must have a reasonable justification (“in other words, they must not

respond to a ‘deviation of power’)

(ii) the changes cannot distort the contract’s very objective;

(iii) the contracting entity must respect constitutional guarantees that could be affected

by its decision to amend the contract; and

Although he initially resisted characterising the Participation Contracts as “administrative contracts”, Dr. Pérez

Loose ultimately conceded that they could be considered as such: Transcript, Hearing on Jurisdiction, Day 2, pp
165-166, and Transcript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 6, pp 1498-1499.

Ist Expert Report of Hernan Pérez Loose, paragraphs 37-40 and 57. Professor Aguilar did not take issue with Dr.
Pérez Loose’s reliance on the principle of pacta sunt servanda as applying generally to administrative contracts,
and did not address the latter’s characterisation of the power of jus variandi. However, since Professor Aguilar did
rely upon the Constitutional Court’s view that the pacta sunt servanda rule broke down in relation to the
Participation Contracts’ economic terms, argued that the power to vary contracts extends to the financial-
economic equation, and argued further that the right to seek a rebalancing of the contract inheres in both parties,
not just the contractor, it is clear that he took a different view of the law than Dr. Pérez Loose on these key issues
(3rd Expert Report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, paragraphs 34 ef seq.)

(iv) if the exercise of jus variandi negatively affects the economic rights of the
contractor, the entity must compensate the contractor, in such a way that the

stipulated price does not change.°”

Only within these limits, in his view, could the administration lawfully exercise the jus

variandi power.

The Constitutional Court has spoken on limbs (iii) and (iv) of this four-limbed test. The Court
decided that Law 42 was “fully subject to the rules of the [2008 Constitution]” (although this
finding was made prior to the promulgation of Decree 662 and the Tribunal cannot know what
the Court’s view of that decree might have been).°** Given the limits on this Tribunal’s
contractual jurisdiction, its duty to apply the governing law, and the Court’s determination of
Law 42’s constitutionality (at least as of September 2006), the Tribunal proceeds on the basis
that the law was constitutional. Hence limb (iii) of Dr. Pérez Loose’s test is deemed to be
satisfied. As for limb (iv), it must yield to the Constitutional Court’s finding that the

Participation Contracts’ financial-economic equilibrium could be modified.”

Turning to limbs (i) and (ii) of the test, in the Tribunal’s view, these types of issues were not
considered by the Court (and obviously could not have been considered because the Court’s
judgment pre-dated Decree 662 by over a year). The Tribunal accepts Dr. Pérez Loose’s

opinion that these two limbs are recognised by Ecuadorian law.

The Tribunal is of the view that Law 42 at 99% constituted a breach of contract. Having regard
to limb (i), in the Tribunal’s view, there was no possible reasonable justification for the State to
claim 99% of “extraordinary revenues” above the reference price. While the nature of a
“deviation of power” is not precisely defined, the writings of the civil law theorists cited by Dr.
Pérez Loose indicate that it concerns the misuse of power.™° In the Tribunal’s view, Decree
662 constituted an act of coercion when viewed within the context of the parties’ contractual

relations and therefore it can be regarded to be a deviation of power.

Ecuador did not dispute that Decree 662 was intended to prompt re-negotiations with oil
companies. Around the time of the Decree’s promulgation, the Administration began to speak
of converting participation contracts into service contracts.“! This became a major theme in
the Administration’s discussion of hydrocarbon exploitation contractual modalities. In his
national address on 23 January 2008, for example, President Correa framed the State’s actions
as intended to return the contracts to “a services contract which always should have been the
preponderant figure in the oil industry." © Tn its written pleadings in this arbitration the
Respondent described Decree 662 as “a true incentive for petroleum companies operating in
Ecuador to negotiate a new contractual framework that would provide a fairer allocation of the

petroleum rent.”

In the Tribunal’s view, the application of Decree 662 and the statements of senior officials in
relation thereto signaled a new phase in the State’s relationship with Perenco (and the other oil
companies in similar circumstances). This was no longer a question of the State seeking an
adjustment of an otherwise acceptable contractual relationship which, in its view, had been
disrupted by price increases of an unanticipated magnitude. Rather, Law 42 at 99% unilaterally
converted the Participation Contracts into de facto service contracts while the State developed

anew model of such contracts which it demanded the contractor to sign.“

Limb (ii) was also violated. In the Tribunal’s view, as of 4 October 2007, Perenco’s Contracts
were participation contracts in name only; Decree 662 completely modified the Contracts’
objective as it was understood under Ecuadorian law. It follows that Decree 662 cannot be

justified as a lawful exercise of the jus variandi power under Ecuadorian law.

 

 

The Administration’s statements about converting contracts to service contracts prompted Perenco to write to the
Ministry of Mines and Petroleum on 24 October 2007 requesting a copy of the service contract to which
companies were expected to migrate. (Exhibit CE-265, Letter from the Consortium to Ministry of Mines and
Petroleum, 24 October 2007 (in Spanish with English translation).

Counter-Memorial, paragraph 625 [Emphasis added.].
In the 53rd National Address, given on 26 January 2008, President Correa stated that the oil companies would
have three choices: comply with the payment of 99% of the “extraordinary income”, renegotiate their participation
contracts by migrating to a service contract, or leave the country. Exhibit CE-67, Excerpt from the 53rd National
Address of President Raphael Correa, San Miguel de Salcedo, 26 January 2008.

Thus, in the Tribunal’s view, in moving beyond 50% up to 99% the Respondent breached the
Participation Contracts. Whatever might have transpired in clause 11 negotiations on the
impact of Law 42 at 50% on the Contracts’ economy (had they occurred), moving from 50% to
99%, in the Tribunal’s view, was no longer an attempt to claim an equitable distribution of the
windfall revenues generated by an unexpected and significant increase in oil prices, and could
not be justified under the applicable Ecuadorian legal standards for the exercise of the jus

variandi power.

(7) The Tribunal’s Decision on Provisional Measures and the defence of exceptio non
adimpleti contractus
Perenco argued that the Respondent committed a further, independent breach of contract in
failing to comply with the Tribunal’s Decision on Provisional Measures." This issue assumes
importance because if Ecuador was contractually obliged to comply with the decisions of the
Tribunal during the course of the arbitration and it failed to do so, the next question would be
whether that breach entitled Perenco to treat Ecuador’s non-compliance as a basis for its

reciprocal non-compliance when it announced that it would suspend operations.™°

a. Was Ecuador contractually obliged to comply with the Tribunal’s Decision on
Provisional Measures?

The analysis of this issue starts with the parties’ agreement reflected in clause 22.2.2 of the
Contracts that they would “use the means set forth in [the Contract] to resolve doubts and
disputes that may arise during its life, and likewise to observe and comply with the decisions of
the competent...arbitrators, judges or tribunals, as the case may be, pursuant to the provisions

of this Contract.” As far as the contract claim is concerned, Perenco argued that Ecuador

added]. The Tribunal notes that in the original Spanish, the relevant terminology is “observas y cumplio” and
“decisiones” (CE-10, PER 04724; CE-17, PER 04865). Dr. Pérez Loose asserted that this provision reflected the
general approach in Ecuadorian law to the binding power of decisions of an arbitral tribunal: under Article 9 of
the Arbitration and Mediation Act in Ecuador “arbitrators may grant injunctive relief in accordance with the Code
of Civil Procedure provisions, or the relief deemed necessary...” His interpretation of this provision is that it
demonstrates that arbitrators are not required to be accorded a separate and specific power to grant injunctive
relief, in order for parties to be bound to comply: “The mere agreement to submit disputes to arbitration is

126

Als.

assumed a contractual obligation to comply with all decisions of an arbitral tribunal, including
this Decision on Provisional Measures.“ Perenco’s contention was that given the economic
impact of Law 42, then at 99%, it was entitled as a matter of Ecuadorian law to suspend its

performance of the Contracts until such time as Ecuador brought itself into compliance.”

Had it done so, the argument went, Perenco would then not have been required to pay Law 42
dues to the State during the pendency of the arbitration, Ecuador would not have commenced
the coactiva proceedings to seize Perenco’s oil and sell it in satisfaction of the claimed Law 42
debt, Perenco would then not have suspended operations, and the grounds for the Contracts’
ultimate termination by declaration of caducidad arising out of that suspension would not have

occurred.°

Ecuador’s position is that while the parties undertook in the Contracts to submit to ICSID
arbitration specified disputes and to abide by the Tribunal’s “final award”, they did not
undertake to, and these obligations could not inferentially amount to, an undertaking to comply
with a tribunal’s recommendation of provisional measures.! It submitted that clause 22.2.2
was generally worded and, according to principles of contract interpretation in Ecuadorian law,
must be “read in accordance with the other clauses of the Participation Contracts which
specifically refer to these topics” and which in its view establish “only that the Parties agree to

19652

abide by the final award rendered by an ICSID tribunal Where it was intended to give a

sufficient to bind the parties not only to comply with the award but also to comply with provisional measures.”
(4th Expert Report of Hernan Pérez Loose, paragraph 28.)

4" Expert Report of Hernan Pérez Loose, paragraph 30. In addition to clause 22.2.2 of the Contracts, Perenco
relies on clause 22.2 and 20.3 of the Block 21 and Block 7 Contracts, respectively, which in its submission
incorporate the ICSID Convention into the Contracts and by which the parties unambiguously undertook to
resolve specified disputes through ICSID arbitration. Perenco submitted that the principle of pacta sunt servanda
was i to the to arbitrate ised in these provisions, and as such, there was an obligation
on Ecuador to comply in good faith with “its contractual obligation peaceably to resolve disputes like this one
through ICSID arbitration”, in addition to its contractual obligation to observe and comply with any resulting
decision of the ICSID tribunal. Its actions amounted to a breach of both contractual obligations: Revised

tribunal the power to provide for binding and enforceable provisional measures, the Contracts
did so expressly (as was done elsewhere in the Contracts with respect to the power of a
domestic arbitral tribunal to order provisional measures).°?

Ecuador argued further that in any event its actions in alleged breach of the dispute resolution
provisions of the Contracts did not cause any loss to Perenco as it could have continued to
operate the Blocks and made a choice to suspend operations in July 2009.°* Ecuador drew the
Tribunal’s attention to its earlier direction in the Decision urging the parties to establish an
escrow account such that Perenco would pay the “sums so accruing into [the] ... account[.]”°>
In the Respondent’s view, Perenco’s willingness to pay Law 42 dues at 99% into such an
account showed that the “forced sale of oil to recoup the 2008 Law 42 dues left Perenco in no
different economic position than would have prevailed had the Parties acceded to the Arbitral
Tribunal’s recommendation of provisional measures.”°°°

In the Tribunal’s view, a plain reading of clauses 22.2.2 indicates that the contracting parties
agreed that they would comply not only with a final award (i.e., in Spanish, the ‘laudo’ issued
by a tribunal), but in addition, they would observe and comply with the decisions (i.e., in
Spanish, the ‘decisiones’) of the tribunal.°” The latter term constitutes a more capacious
category of tribunal decisions of which the final award forms a part. Thus, under the
Participation Contracts, Ecuador was bound to comply with the Decision on Provisional

Measures and its failure to do so constituted a breach of contract.

b. Can Perenco invoke the defence of exceptio non adimpleti contractus for its
decision to suspend operations?

Having found such a breach by Perenco’s counterparty, one requisite element of the defence of
exceptio non adimpleti contractus (the defence of non-performance) is established. This then

requires the Tribunal to determine whether Perenco is correct to argue that as a matter of

Ecuadorian law it was entitled to respond to this breach by suspending performance of its

contractual obligations.°*

Dr. Pérez Loose’s evidence was that Perenco was entitled to invoke the exceptio non adimpleti

659

contractus defence.””” (And following from this, Dr. Pérez Loose submitted that Ecuador could

not claim that it was justified by Perenco’s suspension of operations to subsequently declare

the Contracts terminated by operation of caducidad.)°°

Dr. Pérez Loose asserted that a corollary of the proposition that the principle of pacta sunt
servanda fully applied to administrative contracts is that a contractor faced with a situation of
non-performance by the public contracting entity may pursuant to Article 1505 of Ecuador’s
Civil Code “go before a judge or arbitrator, as applicable, to request either: (a) that he declare
the contract terminated, or (b) that he order the other party to stop violating the contract and
comply as was agreed.” °°! Under either option, the contractor has the right to claim
damages.°™ In any event, faced with a material breach, the private contracting entity is entitled
to withhold performance of its own contractual obligations, recognised in Ecuadorian law
under Article 1568 of its Civil Code and known as the “defense of the unfulfilled contract” or

by its Roman law expression, “exceptio non adimpleti contractus.”%°

Article 1568 of Ecuador’s Civil Code provides more generally that “[iJn bilateral contracts no
party shall be considered to be in default by failing to comply with the agreed terms, while the
other party has not complied with its obligations or refuses to comply in due manner and
time.” During cross-examination, Dr. Pérez Loose asserted that in his view Article 1568

must apply to administrative contracts since it makes no distinction in terms between private

and administrative contracts, referring only to the generally worded “contracts.” He referred

to the defence as a “transitory” or “transient” right intended to exert pressure on the other

contracting party to comply with its contractual obligations.°” In order to invoke this defence,

the invoking party must demonstrate: (i) a reciprocal connection between the obligation

hn;

breached and the obligation it purports to breac! (ii) that the original breach was material in

nature (it cannot relate to ancillary, secondary, or obligations relatively insignificant in the

larger context of the legal relationship between the parties);°°

70

and (iii) that it was or is ready to

perform its obligations.®

While he asserted that the defence of exceptio non adimpleti contractus applies equally to

administrative contracts as it does to private contracts in Ecuador, Dr. Pérez Loose

671

acknowledged some limitations.°’’ He noted early resistance to applying the defence at all to

administrative contracts because it was necessary to encourage continuity in contracts which
commonly provided for the provision of public services, rather than to grant the contractor a
right to interrupt performance if it considered itself justified by the other party’s failure to

perform its contractual duties.°”

He asserted, however, that this position has “eased into a less rigid stance,” recognising that the
State is party to many contracts unrelated to public services. This was the case with the
Participation Contracts in this arbitration, and the contractor party to such an administrative

contract may invoke the defence if requiring it to continue performance would result in its

suffering “serious economic consequences”. He relied on two decisions of the First Civil

674

and Commercial Division of the Supreme Court of Justice in Ecuador”, two opinions from

the Attorney-General’s office in Ecuador permitting private contractors to postpone
performance without penalty under their contracts with a State entity that had defaulted in
payments to it,” and the writings of civil law theorists such as Marienhoff, Dromi and
Cassagne, to support his view that the defence applies to administrative contracts, and may be

invoked when the State’s conduct results in a situation that renders it prejudicial for the

contractor to perform its obligations.”’” (The threshold of prejudice quoted by Dr. Pérez Loose

in an excerpt from Marienhoff is “reasonable inability”, instead of “serious economic

consequences” which was Dr. Pérez Loose’s characterisation of the test in his fourth expert

report.°”’)

For his part, while Professor Aguilar accepted that Article 1568 of the Civil Code and the
defence of exceptio non adimpleti contractus is of “mandatory application in the field of
Private Law,” he rejected the view that it applied equally in the case of contracts entered into
by State entities, asserting that it is “only applicable in extraordinary circumstances in the field

of Administrative law.”°”* He cited French,” Spanish and Argentinean! legal theorists to

3rd Expert Report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, paragraph 82 [Emphasis added.]. Dr. Pérez Loose in cross-

of exceptio non adimpleti contractus to administrative contracts, contending only that it applied under
“exceptional circumstances.” Transcript, Hearing Day 6, pp 1502, line 16 to 1503, line 4.

this effect; and passages quoted from their administrative law textbooks suggested that the
exceptio did not carry over, without qualification, to administrative contracts because of the
imperative of ensuring continuity of performance under public contracts. He submitted that
the texts of civil law theorists relied upon by Dr. Pérez Loose in his fourth expert report,
namely Marienhoff, Dromi and Cassagne, may use the phrase exceptio non adimpleti
contractus, but in their explanation of the doctrine they were actually referring to the

“existence of a force majeure that excuses the contractor from fulfilling its obligations.”°*

Professor Aguilar asserted further that the writers supported his view that the exceptio can only
apply to administrative contracts in circumstances where the State’s conduct has made it
‘reasonably impossible’ for the private contracting entity to fulfill its obligations. ™* It is
pertinent to note in this regard that Professor Aguilar corrected the relevant threshold
articulated by Marienhoff and cited by Dr. Pérez Loose; stating that Marienhoff used the
phrase “reasonable impossibility”, rather than “reasonable inability’ as noted above. 685
Professor Aguilar cited as an example of “reasonable impossibility” the situation in which a

3" Expert Report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, paragraphs 88-90.

in a sentence which he asserted followed the passage excerpted in the 4th Expert Report of Dr. Pérez Loose,

‘in favor of the contracting party when the Administration’s conduct translates into a ‘reasonable imp‘ ility”

Marienhoff is “razonable imposibilidad”. The same can be said for Dromi (3" Expert Report of Juan Pablo
Aguilar Andrade, Annex 60, p 384 of the original text) who uses the term “una razonable imposibilidad de
cumplir con las obligaciones contractuales” in a section titled “[s]uspensién de la ejecucién y “exceptio non

“extended in time and is of such nature that it grossly undercapitalizes the contractor and

leaves it without the necessary resources to execute the works entrusted.”°*°

Professor Aguilar accepted that his view was derived from the views of foreign legal theorists,
but asserted that this was necessarily the case as “[t]here has been no explicit development in
Ecuador by authors on the subject, nor has a concrete case presented itself that resulted in
applicable jurisprudence.”°” He rejected Dr. Pérez Loose’s reliance on two judicial decisions
of the First Civil and Commercial Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice, stating they
demonstrated instead that a claim invoking the exceptio will not be entertained when the
private contractor is itself in default of its contractual obligations.°* He similarly asserted that
contrary to Dr. Pérez Loose’s submission, the two opinions of the Attorney-General in Ecuador
demonstrate that the exceptio may be invoked by the private contracting entity to an
administrative contract, there was in one case a specific contractual provision providing that no
fine would be imposed on the contractor for non-performance if the public contracting entity
was in default, and the other case supports his view that the exceptio did not apply as the
“Attorney General argues that a delay in payment by a public institution does not authorize an
extension of the contractual term” in favour of the contractor (i.e., permitting non-performance
for a time until payment is received).

Professor Aguilar asserted further that his position was buttressed by the fact that it is
analogous to the approach to contractual breach under statutory law in Ecuador; first, under
Article 96(1) of the National Public Contracting System Law which establishes that breach by

the public contracting entity for a duration of more than 60 days entitles the contractor only to

3" Expert Report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, paragraphs 94 to 95. During the hearing, on cross-examination,
Dr. Pérez Loose acknowledged that in the first case there was a contractual provision that permitted the contractor
to stop fulfilling its obligations if there was non-fulfillment by the administration. He stated that he still found this
case to be useful because there was an opportunity for the Attorney General to say that for administrative
contracts, the exceptio was not to be applied, but this is not what the Attorney General did. As for the second case,
which concerned a contract for the sale of medicine, on cross-examination it was suggested to Dr. Pérez Loose
that this was a private contractor, not an administrative contract, as he had suggested in his opinion. He conceded
that it could be characterised as such. He also agreed that in both cases the exceptio was invoked by the public
sector rather than by the private sector, but maintained that this did not mean that it was not available to the
private contractor. (Transcript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 6, pp 1513, line 3 to 1514, line 15, and pp 1517, line

terminate the contract, and second, under Article 74 of the Hydrocarbons Law which does not
permit breach by the public contracting entity to be raised as a defence by the private
contractor in proceedings leading to the declaration of caducidad (although, as Professor
Aguilar later noted, it does permit that defence in proceedings for caducidad if suspension of

operations is by reason of force majeure).°°

The Participation Contracts, in Professor Aguilar’s view, were contracts where continuity of

performance was imperative and was recognised as such by their own terms oo

692

and by

Ecuadorian constitutional law.’”~ In his opinion, recognition of hydrocarbons activity as being

of public utility suggested that there was a “need to grant priority to contractual continuity over

693

the application of the exceptio non adimpleti contractus” to these Contracts.”’” Accordingly, he

asserted that it would be inappropriate to permit the application of the defence.

Finally, Professor Aguilar asserted that even if the exceptio was applicable, rather than
permitting the suspension of its contractual obligations it would at best permit Perenco to
demand compliance with, or termination of, the Contracts.°* He referred in this respect to the
two judicial decisions of the First Civil and Commercial Chamber of the Supreme Court of
Justice as cited by Dr. Pérez Loose. While Professor Aguilar admitted they applied the exceptio
(though in his view not in the way Dr. Pérez Loose sought to rely on them) he asserted that
“Ti]n both decisions, judges reason that the plaintiffs, both private persons, could not bring

claims against the State because they were in default of their contractual obligations. In other

3" Expert Report of Juan Pablo Aguilar Andrade, paragraphs 96 to 97, 109. Professor Aguilar asserted that non-
renewable natural resources are recognised as one of the strategic sectors of the State under Article 313 of the
Constitution, and continuity as a characteristic of the sector to be pursued by the National Hydrocarbons
Directorate in its mandate under Article 11 of the Hydrocarbons Law. Moreover, Article 326(15) of the
Constitution “prohibits paralyzing, amongst other services and activities, hydrocarbon production.”

words, the contracting party’s breach authorized filing a claim, but could not authorize a failure

to fulfill its contractual obligations.”°°>

In addition to its view of the restrictions on the defence’s availability, Ecuador asserted as a
matter of fact that even if exceptio non adimpleti contractus applied, it would require Perenco
to demonstrate that the impugned conduct rendered it impossible for it to fulfill its own
obligations. This Perenco could not do since during the provisional measures phase of the
proceeding it informed the Tribunal and Ecuador that it was able and willing to pay the
amounts claimed by Ecuador under Law 42 (then at 99%) into an escrow account maintained
in a neutral location.®° Ecuador argued that if Perenco could operate under Law 42 at 99% by
paying the disputed dues into escrow, it could equally operate by paying the dues to the
Government. This demonstrated that Perenco could pay Law 42 dues and that it was not forced

to discontinue performance of the Contracts by reason of the alleged breach.”

Having considered the parties’ submissions, although it accepts Professor Aguilar’s view that
the law is not well developed in this point in Ecuador, the Tribunal finds that the defence may
be invoked by a private party to an administrative contract. Article 1568 of the Civil Code is
worded in general terms and does not support the position that it may only be invoked by the

public contracting entity that is party to the contract.

The next issue is whether it was “reasonably impossible” (the test according to the theorists
cited by Dr. Pérez Loose) for Perenco to comply with the Contracts during the time that its oil
was being seized by Ecuador. The Tribunal considers that the test is concerned with
‘commercial impossibility’ in the circumstances of the particular contracting party. The initial
hurdle Perenco must overcome is whether it was commercially impossible for it to carry on

operations in accordance with its contractual rights and obligations.

In this regard, Perenco faced two issues. First, by expressing its interest in the opening of an
escrow account into which the Law 42 dues would be paid, Perenco seemed to consider that it
could continue to operate both blocks while paying Law 42 dues. Second, if it overcame the
first hurdle, Perenco had to then show that Professor Aguilar was incorrect in arguing that the
remedies afforded by Ecuadorian law extend to suspension of the plaintiff’s own obligations

and not just court proceedings seeking termination or damages.

After reviewing the fact and expert evidence, the Tribunal considers that Perenco has made out
the “commercial impossibility” argument. In the Tribunal’s view, the dispute’s having been
submitted to ICSID arbitration, the Tribunal’s then having made the provisional measures
recommendation in order to avoid the dispute’s aggravation, and Perenco’s having had a
contractual expectation that Ecuador would comply with such a decision, it was entitled to rely
on the prospect of the non-enforcement of the coactivas aimed at collecting past sums claimed
to be owing or new sums generated by Perenco’s exploitaiton of the Blocks during the
pendency of this arbitration. When the coactivas were applied to Perenco’s production, it
became commercially impossible for the company to carry on business because its production
was being seized in order to be sold (at a discount to the prevailing market price) in order to
pay the debt, while it simultaneously continued to incur Law 42 debt at the market price. For
every barrel of oil seized and sold by Ecuador, a new debt was being incurred under the
application of Law 42. In all of the circumstances, carrying on production at a loss amounted to

‘commercial impossibility’.

As for the second point, the Tribunal considers that Ecuadorian law permits the party that is
not in breach to suspend performance of its obligations until such time as the party in breach
brings itself into compliance. Accordingly, the exceptio non adimpleti contractus defence was
open to Perenco.

(8) Was there a breach of clause 5.1.28 of the Block 7 Participation Contract?

The Tribunal recalls that clause 5.1.28 of the Block 7 Participation Contract provides:

“The parties understand that the treatment received by the Contractor both by the
Government of Ecuador as well as by PETROECUADOR shall not be less

136

437.

favorable than that in similar conditions by other Participation Contractors for
the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons.”°*

The Claimant contends that by exempting another contractor, Andes Petroleum, from the
application of Law 42 with respect to its participation contract for the Tarapoa Block,”
Ecuador breached clause 5.1.28. Ecuador’s response is two-fold, first, contesting the
admissibility of the claim since it was advanced for the first time by the Claimant in its Reply,
and second, submitting that Perenco has failed to discharge its burden of proving that Perenco
and Andes Petroleum were “in similar conditions”, that there was differential treatment that

was otherwise unjustified, and that Ecuador intended to favour Andes Petroleum.

On the matter of the claim’s admissibility, the Tribunal cannot accept Ecuador’s submission
that the claim was submitted out of time. Rule 40 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provide that
“an incidental or additional claim...arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute”
“shall be presented not later than in the reply’. It is uncontested that the claim was raised in
the Reply, and the Tribunal accordingly finds that this objection is unfounded and the claim is

admitted for its consideration.

On the matter of the merits of the claim of breach, the Tribunal considers that Perenco has
failed to prove that it and Andes Petroleum were in “similar conditions” as far as their
respective participation contracts were concerned. When Ecuador and City Investing Company

(Andes Petroleum’s predecessor) entered into the Modification Contract for the Explotation

5,701

and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons in the Tarapoa Block on 25 July 199: they agreed to

supplement their clause 8.1 with the following proviso:

“Tf the Contract Area crude oil price exceeds seventeen dollars per production
unit, the profit surplus from the price’s real increase (calculated over 1995
constant values) will be distributed among the parties in equal shares.”

440. Whether Law 42 and its Implementing Regulations should apply to the Tarapoa Block

Participation Contract was the subject of a formal opinion requested of Ecuador’s Attorney-
General Dr. Diego Garcia Carrién in July 2008 by the then-President of Petroecuador Rear-
Admiral Luis Jaramillo. In his opinion of 18 July 2008 the Attorney-General noted that the
objective of Law 42 and its Implementing Regulations was to address “non-negotiated and
unforeseen windfall” profits. °° In contrast, in the case of the Tarapoa Block Participation

Contract, the parties had considered the event of windfall profits and had turned their minds to

704

an agreed approach to addressing that eventuality.’ The Attorney-General concluded:

“Tn light of the foregoing, in the specific case of the Participation Contract for the
Tarapoa Block, in force with Andes Petroleum Company Ltd., Law 2006-42
amending the Hydorcarbons Law is not applicable, given that the contract already
assures participation for the Ecuadorian state in the economic profits earned from
an increase in the price of crude oil exploited in that field.

As regards the distribution percentage, the Participation Contract in effect, which
constitutes law for the contracting parties and cannot be modified other than by
their agreement, in accordance with the principle established by article 1561 of
the Civil Code - which applies to the Contract since it is subject to Ecuadorian
legislation, as stipulated in Clause 22.] - has established a distribution modality
equivalent to what is provided in Law 42, which should be applied in the case of
this contract, to the benefit of the principle of legal certainty for the parties.

With Law 2006-42 not applicable to said contract, which expressly refers to the
windfalls from the oil sales prices not negotiated or unforeseen in the
Participation Contracts, the regulations for said law issued through Executive
Decrees numbers 1672 published in the Second Supplement of the Registro
Oficial no. 312 dated July 13, 2006; and 662 published in Registro Oficial no.
193 dated October 18, 2007 also do not apply.”””°

441. This is evidence of the State’s considered evaluation of whether Law 42 and its Implementing

703

708

705

Regulations should apply to the Tarapoa Block Participation Contract. The Tribunal considers
that the evidence shows that Perenco and Andes Petroleum were not in “similar conditons” and

therefore the required comparator is not present. The Claimant has failed to discharge its

burden of proving that there was unfavourable treatment accorded to it when compared to

another company in similar conditions. This claim is therefore dismissed.

(9) Caducity under the Contracts

The Tribunal finds it most efficient to address the issue of caducity after its discussion of the
Claimant’s expropriation claim. As shall be seen, the Tribunal considers that the declaration of
caducidad effected an expropriation and by parity of reasoning, it constituted a breach of the
Block 21 Contract because, in all of the circumstances, having occupied the blocks and
safeguarded the State’s interest in maintaining the oilfields and ensuring continuity of
operations, without dispossessing Perenco of its contractual rights, Ecuador need not have

brought the Contracts to an end.

Summary of Tribunal’s findings on contract claims

In summary, the Tribunal finds that (i) Law 42 modifed the operation of the Contracts and fell
squarely within the taxation modification provisions of the two Contracts; (ii) Perenco has
failed to make out a breach of contract in relation to Law 42 at 50% due to its decision not to
press its contractual rights and its failure to demonstrate that the clause 11 remedy was futile in
the circumstances prevailing around the time of its request; and (iii) Perenco has made out its

claim that at 99%, Law 42 breached the Contracts.

JURISDICTION OVER CLAIMANT’S TREATY CLAIMS
The remaining jurisdictional question under the Treaty

In its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal left open the question of whether Perenco Ecuador

Limited has standing to bring the claim under the Treaty.”

The Tribunal noted that the Claimant was incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth

of the Bahamas.” It is the fourth company at the lowest rung of a “ladder” of Bahamian

Decision on Jurisdiction, paragraph 86.
Decision on Jurisdiction, paragraph 3.

709

companies with the company at the top of the ladder being PIL.” At the time of his death, the
late Hubert Perrodo, a French national, owned 92.9% of the shares of PIL. The remaining 7.1%

4,7

shares are owned by another Bahamian company, Glenmor Energy Limite which in turn is

wholly owned by Mr. Perrodo’s eldest son, Mr. Francois Perrodo.”!°

Although it dismissed the primary limb of the Respondent’s objections to the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction to hear the Treaty claims in its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal deferred its
consideration of certain issues pending the filing of additional evidence and further

submissions by the Parties. In doing so, the Tribunal expressed two concerns.

First, it observed that this appeared to be the first time in which a juridical person, a national of
a third State, had invoked treaty rights held and obligations owed by the Treaty parties without
there being at least one national of one of the two State parties to the Treaty (or a juridical
person incorporated under the law of one of the two State parties) joining to claim under the
Treaty.”!! It observed further that it was beyond dispute that ordinarily a Bahamian company
could not claim rights under a bilateral treaty to which the Commonwealth of the Bahamas is a

2
stranger.’

Consequently, the Tribunal was somewhat surprised at the lack of affirmation from any French
national, i.e. any heir of the late Mr. Hubert Perrodo, to the effect that such national, either

individually or collectively with other French nationals, now controlled PIL and through it the

713

Claimant. In the circumstances of the case, therefore, the Tribunal considered that the

Due to a corporate reorganisation, the names of various companies in the ladder have changed. For example, what
is now Perenco International Ltd was Perenco Limited in 2006. Similarly, what was Perenco S.A was formerly
Perenco Oil and Gas S.A. Perenco Gabon S.A was formerly Perenco S.A: See Letter from Debevoise & Plimpton
to Dechert dated 8 July 2009, enclosing letter from Debevoise & Plimpton to ICSID dated 28 May 2008 at Exhibit
E-1 to Amended Request

evidence of claimed control by French nationals that had been adduced by the Bahamian

company by the time of the jurisdictional hearing was meagre.”!4

Second, with respect to the second limb of its objection to the treaty claim, the Respondent had
advanced the argument that the word “controlled” used in Article 1(3)(ii) of the Treaty in
relation to the word “companies” meant “any body corporate” that was directly controlled by
nationals of a Contracting Party and did not extend to any body corporate that was indirectly
controlled by such nationals.” At the jurisdictional hearing, the Respondent conceded that if it
was proved that French nationals controlled PIL, the company at the top of the ladder of
Bahamian companies, then that Bahamian company — but, it insisted, only that Bahamian
company — had the requisite standing to bring a claim under the Treaty because it was the only
company that could be said to have been directly controlled by the Perrodo family, assuming
that they were able to discharge the burden of proving that they did indeed control that

company.”!°

During the earlier jurisdictional phase, some argument was led in respect of the travaux
préparatoires of the Treaty and the Tribunal decided to defer its decision on the direct/indirect
control issue for the time being.””” Given that the Respondent apparently had little in the way
of the negotiating history within its possession and without expressing a view as to whether it
was appropriate or not in the circumstances to have recourse to supplementary means of
interpretation pursuant to Article 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the
“Vienna Convention” or the “VCLT”), the Tribunal instructed the parties to approach the
French authorities with a view to obtaining any travaux préparatoires and to return to this

issue in the next phase of the proceeding in the light of any such negotiating history.”'8

After receiving the further written submissions and evidence from the parties, the Tribunal was

in a better position to make a proper determination of the remaining jurisdictional issues.

averment that it is controlled by Mr. Perrodo’s heirs.

(D Key factual findings

Before discussing the objections in detail, it is necessary to consider the facts as they emerged

from the written and oral testimony of witnesses tendered by the Parties.

At the oral hearing in The Hague held from 8 to 16 November 2012, Mr. Francois Perrodo, Mr.
Roland Fox, and Mr. Patrick Spink all testified as to the issue of the control of Perenco

Ecuador Limited both during the late Mr. Hubert Perrodo’s lifetime and after his death.

With respect to the question of whether or not as a matter of fact at the material time (17
October 2007)’"° the Perrodo family controlled PIL, and through PIL and two other interposed

companies, the Claimant, the following key points warrant noting.

The evidence of Mr. Frangois Perrodo was that after his father’s untimely death on 29

December 2006, he had to assume the leadership of the Perenco Group and on 12 January 2007

720

was appointed Director and Chairman of the Board of Directors of PIL.’~ In both his written

and oral testimony, he maintained that after his father’s death, he and his family controlled
PIL, which in turned controlled the subsidiary companies, including Perenco Ecuador Limited,

in that significant decisions affecting the Perenco Group or any Group company were made

2
1,72!

only with the Perrodo family’s approval Mr. Perrodo stated that he continued to follow his

late father’s management practices in that the directors, officers and managers of the various
Perenco Group of companies would consult with him and seek his approval for all kinds of
matters, “including potential acquisitions or dispositions, important contracts, commencing or

terminating relationships with partners, investment decisions, key personnel, relations with

: 99722
governments and many other issues.

During his oral testimony, Mr. Perrodo stated that his father’s only heirs were his mother, Mrs.

Ka Yee Perrodo, and her three children, Nathalie Samani (née Perrodo), Bertrand Perrodo, and

On 17 October 2007, Perenco notified Ecuador that it accepted and gave its consent to the offer by the Respondent
to submit any dispute relating to any measure which may affect the Claimant’s investments in Ecuador to ICSID:

himself.’** There are no other descendants entitled to make a claim of an interest in the

estate.’™*

Mr. Perrodo acknowledged that there was a dispute between his mother and her children as to
how the estate should be divided.’”> Since her husband had died intestate, Mrs. Perrodo had
argued that under the applicable matrimonial regime, 15% of the estate had belonged to her
while her husband was alive.’”° This would have a significant impact on the percentage share

4.727

of the estate that each heir would receive once the estate was administere As a result of

this dispute, on 15 February 2008, Mrs. Perrodo, on the advice of counsel, lodged a caveat in

the Bahamian courts. (This was later withdrawn, on 30 March 2009.)78

Mr. Perrodo testified further that the dispute between the heirs in no way impeded the
management of the Perenco Group.” It had always been clear that Mrs. Perrodo and the other
two Perrodo children completely entrusted him in the running of the company as Executive

Chairman.”

This evidence was consistent with that of Mr. Roland Fox who testified that at all times the
Perrodo family controlled the Perenco Group. 3! When Hubert Perrodo was alive, he
maintained tight control over the Perenco Group,” and this was manifested by his ability as
sole shareholder to appoint senior management and the Board of Directors of PIL.” All
decisions relating to the Perenco Group were made with Mr. Perrodo’s approval.’ He was

succeeded by his son Frangois when he was appointed Chairman of PIL shortly after his

father’s death.” The authorised signatories on PIL’s bank accounts were changed to give
Frangois Perrodo the authority to transact on those accounts on the basis of his signature
alone.”°° On 24 September 2007, his mother, Ka Yee, and his sister, Nathalie, were also

appointed Directors of PIL's Board.”*”

Mr. Fox testified further that as of 17 October 2007, six of the nine Directors of PIL’s Board
were French nationals, consisting of the three Perrodo family appointees and three others,

namely, Bernard Castanet, Patrick Reynis and Jean-Michel Runacher,”**

Mr. Fox testified further that Mr. Frangois Perrodo, as Chairman of the Board, was and has
remained personally involved in all the significant decisions affecting the Perenco Group, and
also consults his family before making such decisions.” No significant decision would be

taken without his approval.“

Mr. Fox further testified that the Perrodo family controlled Perenco Ecuador Limited (“PEL”).
He himself was the President of PEL, which also had two Bahamian Directors. Day-to-day
management of PEL was the responsibility of the Ecuador General Manager, supervised by the
Regional Manager, but all material and strategic decisions were first brought to the attention of

Hubert Perrodo, and after his death, to Frangois Perrodo.”*!

Mr. Fox averred that Frangois Perrodo has made significant decisions affecting PEL, including
approving PEL’s expenditures in the country, its annual work programme and budget, and how
to react to the actions of Ecuador which were considered to be detrimental to PEL’s operations

in Ecuador."”

Two other aspects of Mr. Fox’s testimony warrant note. The first relates to the shareholding of

PIL at the time of Hubert Perrodo’s death. Mr. Fox confirmed that at the time of Mr. Hubert

Perrodo’s death, the entire share capital of PIL amounted to 97,414 shares of which Hubert
Perrodo owned 90,498 shares, equivalent to 92.9% of the total issued share capital of PIL, and
Glenmore Energy Ltd, owned by Francois Perrodo, owned the remaining 6,916 shares

equivalent to 7.1% of PIL’s share capital.”

Mr. Fox testified that in his role as Company Secretary of PIL, he was advised by Mr. Patrick
Reynis, a French lawyer on PIL’s Board, that the 90,498 shares in PIL formed part of Hubert
Perrodo’s estate and that under French law, upon his death they became immediately and
indivisibly owned by his four heirs.” He testified further that on 22 December 2011, the PIL
shares that the heirs jointly owned were divided such that each of the four members of the
Perrodo family ended up owning 25% of the total issued share capital of PIL.”*° On this date,
the transfer and re-registration of 24,353.5 shares were registered in each of the names of Ka

Yee Perrodo, Nathalie Samani and Bertrand Perrodo. Some 17,437.5 shares were registered in

the name of Frangois Perrodo because he already owned 6,916 shares through Glenmor.”“°

Another aspect of Mr. Fox’s testimony that warrants note concerned his view as to the voting
rights attached to the shares of PIL. In this regard, he testified that in the period between Mr.
Perrodo’s death and the time that the PIL shares were transferred and re-registered on 22
December 2011 — the period in which the consent to ICSID arbitration was given by PEL -
although the shares were held indivisibly by the heirs, there were no voting rights attached to
them because nobody was in a position to vote on them.“ Accordingly, from his perspective
as the Company Secretary, Francois Perrodo’s indirect 7.1% shareholding in PIL gave him the
right to determine shareholders’ decisions until the other shareholders had been registered.”“*

The Tribunal will revert to his testimony on this point below.

Mr. Patrick Spink also testified as to the issue of control exercised by both Hubert Perrodo and

Francois Perrodo over PIL and PEL.

He testified that the Perrodo family’s control extended to more than just acquisitions and that
they had a “decisive say over matters as diverse as capital expenditures, relationships with
business partners, annual budgets, personnel and other matters.” ™ Mr. Spink also gave
evidence as to Hubert Perrodo’s control over PEL, and the investment in Ecuador, which he

said was directly supervised by Hubert Perrodo.’*°

The expert opinion of Mr. Bernard Reynis, a French notary called by the Claimant, addressed

the immediate devolution under French law of interest in Hubert Perrodo’s estate upon his

death to his surviving spouse and descendants. *"

Mr. Reynis testified that under French law, in
the absence of any last will and testament by the deceased and in the presence of a surviving
spouse and descendants, the estate reverts to the surviving spouse and his descendants (i.e. the
heirs).’* The heirs are vested immediately with “capacity” in relation to their interest in the
estate “without any need for formalities or ‘probate’ proceedings such as those used in
common-law jurisdictions.””*°

Mr. Reynis added that where there are numerous heirs, this results in the creation of a joint
ownership, and “[d]uring the joint ownership period, the coheirs hold title to and exercise
control over the entire estate, which includes shares of stock held by the deceased in a
corporation at the time of death, jointly and indivisibly.”7™ This testimony was consistent with
Mr. Fox’s evidence that from his perspective as Company Secretary, the shares were held
indivisibly by the heirs. It was also consistent with the Claimant’s position that immediately

upon the death of Hubert Perrodo, the Perrodo heirs owned PIL, and through that, PEL.

testified that, in his view, the heirs were immediately vested with title to the shares in PIL and could have
registered the shares at any time, and in any event, for all relevant purposes the heirs were treated as shareholders:

While the Respondent challenged certain aspects of the testimony of each of the foregoing
witnesses, it did not successfully challenge the central points of the foregoing testimony going
to the issue of the Perrodo family’s control in fact of PIL (the issue of legal control will be

considered separately below).
In light of the foregoing, six key factual findings can be made in this respect.

First, after two rounds of oral hearings, each of which was preceded by two rounds of written
pleadings, there is no evidence that the PIL shares did not form part of the Perrodo estate for
the purposes of French law. There is no evidence, for example, that Mr. Perrodo created a
testamentary or other trust domiciled outside of France which might have meant that the PIL

shares did not form part of the estate which vested in the heirs under French law.

Rather, the evidence is that the shares of PIL did form part of the estate and in view of Mr.
Perrodo’s intestacy, they fell to devolve to the heirs in accordance with French law, as
indicated in the Acte de notoriété and Death Certificate of Hubert Perrodo prepared by Mr.
Bernard Reynis on 11 June 2007 (as further confirmed by Mr. Reynis’ expert report filed in
this proceeding).’*>

Second, while evidence emerged which showed that the surviving heirs of Mr. Perrodo
disputed their respective shares of the estate (a fact which Mr. Francois Perrodo freely

a. 756
acknowledged under cross-examination

), no evidence was adduced to contradict the
Claimant’s position that, under French law, the ownership of the estate vested in the heirs
immediately upon Mr. Perrodo’s death. The Respondent did not seek to contradict Mr. Reynis’
expert opinion on French law and its operation in this fashion was accepted by the
Respondent’s expert on Bahamian law, Mr. Brian Moree QC, as an assumption for his

opinion.’*”

Third, no evidence was adduced to suggest that any other person of French or of any other
nationality came forward to contest the heirs’ collective entitlement to the estate. It is true that
on 15 February 2008, Madame Perrodo filed a caveat in the estate of Hubert Perrodo in the
Supreme Court of the Bahamas’”*, but this was explained by Mr. Perrodo as an act taken out of
an abundance of caution by his mother and in light of the then-brewing dispute between the
heirs.’ There is no record evidence that any other party — of French or of any other nationality

— contested the Perrodo heirs’ entitlement to the estate.

Fourth, the consistent evidence of the Perenco officers and management was that there was no
doubt amongst the Board or the senior officers of the company as to the Perrodo family’s
ownership and continued control of PIL after Mr. Perrodo’s death. Mr. Fox testified that in
light of the advice he had received from a French attorney on the board, management did

whatever it could to facilitate the transition in the company’s governance.”

In this respect, as already noted, on 12 January 2007, some 14 days after Mr. Perrodo’s death,
Francois Perrodo was elected to the Board of PIL and appointed its Chairman.”*! The officers
of the Perenco Group testified that they then consulted with Frangois Perrodo in the same way

in which they had previously consulted his father.’

Fifth, Francois Perrodo also had an existing 7.1% shareholding interest in PIL through his

: . 763
ownership of Glenmor.

This shareholding was unaffected by his father’s death and
continued unabated during the period in which the heirs’ respective entitlements to the estate
were contested. (There is some debate between the Parties as to whether or not the shares of
the late Mr. Perrodo were “disabled” from voting until such time as they were re-registered,
and if so, whether Francois Perrodo therefore controlled PIL by virtue of his company being
the only shareholder with the ability to cast a vote at any general meeting of PIL held during

the time that the other shares had not been distributed and registered the names of the heirs.) It

should be noted that Mr. Moree QC objected to using the term “disabled” — his point being that

the rights still existed but there was no one to exercise them.”

Six, approximately nine months after Frangois Perrodo assumed the chairmanship, he was
joined on PIL's Board by his mother and sister.” Thus, when, on 17 October 2007, the
Claimant wrote to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum
purporting to accept Ecuador’s offer to submit the dispute to ICSID pursuant to Article 25 of
the ICSID Convention and Article 9 of the Treaty, three of the four surviving heirs of Hubert

Perrodo were members of PIL’s Board.”

The evidence, therefore, as to the fact of the heirs’ control of PIL, the company at the top of the
ladder of Bahamian companies, is substantial and, in respect of the foregoing, not seriously

contested and indeed un-contradicted in a number of instances.

However, it also remains a fact that what plainly had not occurred either at the time that the
Claimant consented to ICSID arbitration with Ecuador on 17 October 2007 or on 30 April
2008 when the Board of Directors of Perenco S.A. (now PIL) authorised the filing of the
Requests for Arbitration with ICSID, was the registration of the shares previously owned by
Hubert Perrodo in the names of the heirs. It was not until 22 December 2011 that Letters of
Administration were taken out in the Bahamas directing that the heirs be registered as

167

shareholders of PIL in the proportions agreed by the heirs.” This of course is one of the

principal remaining objections, to which the Tribunal now turns.

(2) Submissions on the issue of control

Quite apart from the issues of fact in respect of which it adduced additional evidence on the

issue of control, the Claimant argued against the Tribunal’s placing any reliance upon what it

considered to be “incomplete” parts of the travaux préparatoires as they were said to provide

no definitive interpretative guidance.”

For its part, the Respondent filed what was available in terms of the travaux (while also
complaining that it was evident that the Claimant already had the documents at the time of the

earlier jurisdiction proceedings).””

The Respondent asserted that the travaux supported the view that the changes between the
original initialled draft and the final text that was signed and ratified by the parties were
substantial and the clear interpretative inference to be drawn was that the State parties agreed
that a legal person incorporated under the law of a third State would have standing to bring a

claim only if it was directly controlled by nationals of one of the two Contracting Parties.”

Since the Claimant was not directly controlled by French nationals but rather by a Bahamian
company, the Respondent argued it follows that it lacked the requisite standing to bring the

present Treaty claim.””!

a. The Respondent’s objections

With respect to the Respondent’s objections that were not disposed of by the Tribunal’s

Decision on Jurisdiction, the Respondent’s case as it stands can be summarised as follows:

First, it is clear that the Perrodo heirs had not taken the steps required by Bahamian law to
acquire legal title to the shares at the time that consent to ICSID arbitration was given by the

Claimant.

In the Respondent’s submission, whatever may be said about their ownership of the shares

under French law and the fact that Bahamian law recognised their beneficial interest in the PIL

   

The Claimant described the travaux as “incomplete” and providing “no definitive interpretative guidance”: See
paragraph 28 of the Reply. At the hearing, counsel for the Claimant described the travaux as "...fragmentary and
incomplete. There is in these travaux no ive memo of the negotiations, no agreed i or
Protocols underlying the Treaty, no guides as to why certain language was used or not used. Instead, what
Ecuador invites you to do is to look at a couple of drafts with handwritten markings on and imagine what might
have been in the minds of the negotiators, and from that impose a limitation on the ordinary meaning of the
perfectly clear terms.” Transcript, Hearing on the Merits, Day 1, p 165, lines 16-22, p 166, lines 1-3.

shares””?, as a matter of Bahamian law, since they were not registered as shareholders, they
lacked the power to participate as shareholders in PIL at the crucial date of consent, and
therefore were not in a position to control that company. On this analysis, it was not until

December 2011 that they were, as a matter of Bahamian law, in a position to control PIL.”*

The Respondent thus contends that in the absence of the ownership of legal title of the shares,
PIL itself was not controlled by French nationals and it follows therefore that PEL — which
would derive its right of standing from its being controlled by PIL and it in turn being
controlled by French nationals — likewise lacks standing to bring the Treaty claim.”

Second, the Respondent reaffirms what was originally the second limb of its objection to the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction. This objection exists independently of whatever may be decided in
respect of the first objection in that even if it is accepted that the Perrodo heirs controlled PIL
at the material time, PIL is not the claimant in this arbitral proceeding. Rather, the claim has
been brought by a Bahamian company which is separated by three layers of Bahamian
companies and is therefore not directly controlled by the Perrodo heirs. The immediate,
controlling parent of the Claimant is Perenco S.A. and it is not a French company or

national.””°

The essence of the Respondent’s argument in respect of the second objection is that while the
phrase “directly or indirectly” was used in connection with “controlled” in the first draft of the
treaty negotiated in 1986 — a phrasing that was consistent with the approach taken in French

bilateral investment treaty-making practice, that was not what was ultimately signed and

ratified by the two States in 1994.7”

1st Expert Report of Brian Moree QC, paragraph 6, states that “under Bahamian Law, the heirs only have an
equitable right to the shares pending their registration as the owners of the shares.”

On 22 December 2011, the heirs of Hubert Perrodo were formally registered as shareholders of PIL. See exhibit
CE-294, email correspondence between Roland Fox and Heather Thompson, enclosing instructions from Perrodo
heirs, 22 December 2011.

The 1986 draft followed the French model BIT which provided that “companies” included “...
toute personne morale constituée sur le territoire de l’une des Parties contractantes,
conformément a la législation de celle-ci y possédant son siége social, ou contrdlée directement
ou indirectement par des nationaux de l’une des Parties contractantes 7 Likewise, the
draft initialled in October 19867 similarly provided in Spanish that “...toda persona juridica
constituida en el territorio de una de las Partes Contrantes conforme a su legislacién y que
posea en el mismo su domicio social, 0 controla directa o indirectamente por nacionales de una

de las Partes Contratantes...”.

However, this is not what the final text states. It is common ground that the 1986 draft text was

not finalised and ratified by the two States.

After a hiatus of some 8 years, negotiations between France and Ecuador resumed. By that
time, Ecuador had developed its own model BIT and the approach taken by that instrument
was to confine the standing to bring a claim upon natural persons who were nationals of either
of the two Contracting Parties and legal persons that were incorporated under the law of either
of the two Contracting Parties and whose seat was located in the territory of a Contracting
Party.”” On this approach, legal persons incorporated under the law of a third State would

have no standing to bring a claim.

The Respondent emphasised that consistent with this approach, Ecuador had concluded a
bilateral investment treaty with the United Kingdom which also contained a different model for
establishing the standing of legal persons shortly before the resumption of negotiations with
France. *° That Treaty defined “companies” as “corporations, firms and associations

incorporated or constituted under the law in force in any part of the United Kingdom” or “legal

persons constituted in accordance with the law in force in the Republic of Ecuador.””*! The
Treaty essentially adopted a ‘place of incorporation’ test in accordance with the relevant laws
of the Contracting Parties rather than a ‘control’ test and thus did not contemplate legal persons
incorporated in the law of third States having rights of standing by virtue of their being
controlled by nationals of one of the Contracting Parties. A document, evidently prepared by
French officials prior to the resumption of negotiations with Ecuador in 1994, referred to the

UK treaty and noted the different requirements for the standing of legal persons. *?

Two undated draft texts which evidently preceded the final version of the Treaty were also
submitted. Each contained handwritten annotations that either deleted or inserted text. The first

undated draft includes handwritten marks in the definition of “companies” as follows:

“the term ‘companies’ shall designate i) Any legal entity organized in the
territory of one of the Contracting Parties, in accordance with its legislation, and
that pessesses-has its corporate domicile within the same; or ii) #itis-Any legal
entity controlled directly (or indirectly) by nationals of one of the Contracting
Parties”’** [Handwritten additions in bold, deletions indicated by strikethrough]

 

In the second undated draft of the treaty, the relevant paragraph has the words “directly” and

“indirectly” crossed out:

“companies shall designate // i) Any legal entity organized in the territory of one
of the Contracting Parties, in accordance with its legislation, and that has its
corporate domicile within the same; or // ii) Any legal entity controlled director
indireetly—by nationals of one of the Contracting Parties [...]””*

In the end, the Treaty signed by France and Ecuador contained a different expression of control
than the prior drafts or the 1986 initialled version. The words “directly or indirectly” were
omitted and, as noted above, the phrase “directly or indirectly” was inserted into the definition
of “investment” in Article 1(1). It warrants noting that unlike the then-recently concluded
Ecuador-UK Treaty, the Treaty did not restrict rights of standing to legal persons incorporated

under the law of either of the Contracting Parties, but in addition conferred standing on legal
persons incorporated under the law of a third State, provided that such legal persons were

“controlled” by nationals of one of the Contracting Parties.

b. The Claimant’s submission

The Claimant’s submission in response to this objection can be summarised as follows:

First, it submitted that on the undisputed facts in the record, Perenco is a company “controlled”
by French nationals within the meaning of Article 1(3)(ii) of the Treaty and has been
recognised as such by Ecuador. 785 Bouador’s position that the Treaty’s use of the term
“control” required “legal control” and could not extend to the case where the Perrodo heirs had
not as yet obtained Letters of Administration in the Bahamas, was “premised on a limiting and
formalistic definition of ‘control’ that [was] contrary to the more flexible and fact-dependent
approach that international law adopts”.”°° The Perrodo family was in fact in control of the
Perenco Group both when Hubert Perrodo was alive and after his death.”*” In particular,
Francois Perrodo was appointed Chairman of PIL and was significantly involved in decisions

relating to the management of the Perenco Group, including that of Perenco.’**

Moreover, at
the date of consent to arbitration, the Perrodo heirs collectively owned 100% of the shares in

PIL and this was suffi

 

  

ent to establish “control” over the company (and through that, its
wholly-owned subsidiary). The fact that the Perrodos’ shareholding had not been formally
registered in their individual names could not detract from the fact that under French law, upon
Hubert Perrodo’s death, his ownership of 92.9% of PIL’s shares automatically vested in his

four heirs jointly - they owned the shares.”

Perenco. On that date, the Board appointed Francois as a director and as Chairman of the company with
immediate effect. It also transferred authority to transact ‘any or all business’ involving Perenco’s bank accounts

transactions on the bas signature alone.”).

Perenco asserted that even if the Tribunal were to proceed on the narrow approach to control
advocated by Ecuador, Perenco was nevertheless legally controlled by French nationals as of
17 October 2007 because approximately 7.1% of the shares in PIL were owned by Glenmor
Energy, which in turn, was wholly owned by Francois Perrodo.”! This entitled Frangois
Perrodo to vote on decisions taken by the management of PIL, even if it was assumed that the
beneficiaries of the Perrodo estate could not vote in respect of the shares vested in Hubert

Perrodo.

Finally, Perenco submitted that the Government of Ecuador has repeatedly and consistently

792

referred to Perenco as a French company.’~ It referred to statements by President Correa,

Minister Derlis Palacios and Ecuador’s Attorney General in February and March 2009, where

they referred to Perenco as a French company, and the brewing dispute as having implications

793

for its relationship with the French Government.’”” Ecuador’s representatives met with French

government representatives, not Bahamian representatives, ””* Perenco submitted that “[a]s
Prof. Schreuer has explained, under 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, ‘the host State’s
awareness of [the] objective fact [of foreign control] over a local company’ is an element of a

control analysis”, and that “the host State’s awareness of the nationality of foreign controllers

has been a decisive factor in ICSID jurisprudence.”

Second, Perenco contended that Ecuador’s argument that the use of the word “controlled” in
Article 1(3)(ii) of the Treaty must be read to mean “controlled directly” should be rejected

because it is “refuted by the plain language of the Treaty, by pertinent components of its

travaux préparatoires, and by prior investment treaty jurisprudence.”””°

The plain meaning of “control” did not, in Perenco’s view, connote “direct control.” ””” It

encompassed both direct and indirect forms of control.’** It submitted that Ecuador had not

offered the Tribunal one citation of a dictionary definition of the term which defined it as
limited to “direct control.”””? Indeed, the definitions proffered confirmed that the ordinary
meaning of control encompassed both direct and indirect forms of control.5 For example, a
Black’s Law Dictionary definition provided by Ecuador stated that “to control is: To exercise
power or influence over...To have a controlling interest in[.]’*"' Perenco submitted that to
exercise power or influence over a company could not reasonably be said to be “limited to
being its direct 100% shareholder.”*”* Moreover, Perenco challenged Ecuador for having failed
to provide the full citation of the definition; that it followed on in the same page to refer to
“[t]he direct or indirect power to direct the management and policies of a person or entity

whether through ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise [7.8%

Perenco argued that the travaux confirmed that the negotiating parties “did not agree to limit
the term ‘control’ to direct control.”*™ Perenco in the first instance submitted that recourse to
the travaux was inappropriate because the text of the Treaty was in its view unambiguous, and
that the travaux was incomplete and for this reason could not stand as definitive.*° In the
second instance it submitted that if the Tribunal should see fit to refer to the travaux, it was
significant that “a proposal to limit explicitly the definition of ‘company’ to ‘all juridical
persons controlled directly by nationals of one of the Contracting Parties’ was in fact

rejected”.*°° This was a reference to the two undated drafts decribed above at paragraphs 497-
498, Perenco placing considerable emphasis on the handwritten qualification of the term “(or

indirectly)” in the first undated draft, and then the altogether deletion of the phrase “directly or

indirectly” in the second which ultimately was the version carried over into the final text.”
Perenco further contended that if “the parties had wished to restrict the definition of ‘company’
as Ecuador proposes, they could also have adopted the formulation they inserted in Article 9 of
the Treaty, which refers to a company ‘a majority of whose shares were held, prior to the
dispute, by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party...””.8°8

Moreover, responding to Ecuador’s contention that the insertion of the phrase “indirectly or
directly” in the definition of “investment” and the simultaneous deletion of the same phrase
from the definition of company informed its interpretation, Perenco submitted that “[i]f the
term ‘investment’ had not been expanded to include investments belonging ‘indirectly or
directly’ to nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party, then individuals holding an
indirect minority or non-controlling interest in the investment would not have been covered by

the Treaty”.5°

Finally, Perenco relied on what it termed “‘a long line of investment arbitration jurisprudence

not explicitly include that term.”*"* It further relied on decisions in SOABI v. Senegal and AIG
v. Republic of Kazakhstan, characterising them as having recognised the “incongruity of

in order to structure their investments optimally.”*!° To interpret the term in this case any

differently would be “unprecedented” and would ignore “commercial realities.”*'°

(3) The Tribunal’s Decision

The Tribunal begins by noting that the State parties included the bare word “controlled” in the
Treaty. Had they also retained the word “directly” only, the Respondent’s objection would
dispose of the Treaty claim. However, the deletion of the phrase “directly or indirectly” when
referring to “controlled” does not materially differ from the unelaborated use of the word
“controlled” in that, as the Claimant has shown with numerous examples, legal dictionaries
commonly note that courts and tribunals will interpret the word “control” to extend beyond

direct control to indirect control.*!”

In this respect, the Tribunal is satisfied that the Claimant is correct in asserting that the

ordinary meaning of the term “controlled” encompasses direct and indirect control.

The Respondent contends that “the interpreter’s task under Article 31 of the VCLT is to select,
from amongst the range of possible meanings of the word controlled, the ordinary meaning in
the context of the Treaty as a whole.”*'§ The Respondent accepts, however, that one of the
possible meanings “of the term control ‘encompasses’ both direct and indirect forms of control,
including majority equity ownership”.®!? Where it diverges from the Claimant is whether this
is the correct meaning when the interpreter follows the Vienna Convention’s requirement that
it read the ordinary meaning of the word “controlled” in the context of the Treaty and in light

of its object and purpose, and having regard to the Treaty as a whole.

In this regard, it is significant that an object and purpose of the Treaty was to attract foreign
investment and it is not unusual for foreign investors to use a variety of corporate vehicles to

achieve the benefit of an investment. This must have been in the minds of the negotiating

teams on both sides in finalising the Treaty and they chose to retain the possibility that a legal

entity incorporated in a third State could claim standing under the Treaty.

Nevertheless, it can be accepted that on one reading of the Treaty, on the facts of this case, it
could be concluded that the person that controls PEL is Perenco S.A., not the latter’s ultimate
parent company, PIL, or the Perrodo family. But given that the Respondent “crossed the
Rubicon” when it conceded — as was entirely right and proper to do given the plain wording of
Article 1(3)(ii) — that PIL, even though a creature of Bahamian law, had a right of standing to
bring a claim if it could show that it was controlled by the heirs, one can ask how the Treaty’s
object and purpose would be undermined by recognising a right of standing in one Bahamian
company, but not in another which is plainly and indisputably controlled by the one which the

Respondent was prepared to acknowledge did have standing.*”°

The Tribunal will revert to the issue of legal title, but for the present it notes that the totality of
the evidence, i.e. the Perrodo family’s complete ownership of the estate under French law,
Bahamian law’s recognition of that ownership interest, the steps taken to permit three of the
four heirs, in particular Frangois Perrodo, to participate in the overall direction and control of
PIL by means of membership in the board prior to PEL’s consenting to ICSID arbitration, the
eventual registration of all of the late Hubert Perrodo’s shares in the names of the heirs, and
ultimately the fact that there is simply no evidence of any other person(s) who asserted a
claimed interest in the estate taken together is compelling evidence that, quite apart from their
legal title to the shares, shows that the Perrodo family was in every other respect plainly the
owners of PIL as a matter of fact and as a matter of French law before formalising such
ownership as a matter of Bahamian law. In this sense, even though the heirs did not possess
legal title to the shares, it is undisputed they were the owners of all of the estate, including the

shares, under the law governing the distribution of the late Mr. Hubert Perrodo’s estate.

This is not to diminish the significance of the fact that at the time that PEL provided its consent
to ICSID arbitration none of the shares of PIL, except for the 7.1% shareholding owned by
Frangois Perrodo’s holding company, Glenmor Energy Limited, were owned by any of the

Perrodos in the sense of their holding /egal title to the shares.

In this respect, the Tribunal accepted the evidence of Mr. Brian Moree QC, as an accurate
statement of Bahamian law. However, Mr. Moree QC also acknowledged that Bahamian law
recognised French law as being the law applicable to the devolution of the estate, and further
that until such time as the Letters of Administration applicable to the re-registration of shares
owned by a person who died intestate was effected, under Bahamian law their ownership was
deemed to be vested in a judge of the Supreme Court. He readily acknowledged that it was not
open to a judge to in any way diminish the estate or distribute it other than in accordance with

the law.*!

Mr. Moree QC also agreed with the suggestion that the act of the Supreme Court in authorising
the registration of the shares in the names of the heirs was ministerial and would have to be
forthcoming in the event of adequate proof of their entitlement.*” He opined that the fact of
registration is one of great legal significance in terms of vesting the shareholders with such

823

rights as accrued to them under Bahamian company law.*~ In the Tribunal’s view, there is no

doubt that this is the case.

It can be fairly asked why an international tribunal which derives its jurisdiction from an
international treaty specifically concerned with the reciprocal promotion and protection of
investment ought not to be concerned with the formalities of the law of the particular State
pursuant to which a company has been incorporated when considering the ownership and
governance of that company. Title to the shares of course specifies the precise extent of the
shareholder’s ownership in the company, establishes each shareholder’s right to participate in
the making of decisions which can be made by the shareholders alone, and is the means by

which shareholders are identified for the purposes of convening meetings.

Thus, since the Claimant is a creature of Bahamian law, the Tribunal must look to the
operation of that law. The point was made by the International Court of Justice in the

Barcelona Traction case, where it observed:

In this field international law is called upon to recognize institutions of municipal
law that have an important and extensive role in the international field. This does
not necessarily imply drawing any analogy between its own institutions and those
of municipal law, nor does it amount to making rules of international law
depended upon categories of municipal law. All it means is that international law
has had to recognize the corporate entity as an institution created by States in a
domain essentially within their domestic jurisdiction. This in turn requires that,
whenever legal issues arise concerning the rights of States with regard to the
treatment of companies and shareholders, as to which rights international law has
not established its own rules, it has to refer to the relevant rules of municipal
law.”

 

Both general international law and the applicable bilateral Treaty lack the specificity and
particularity of municipal law (e.g. French law, Ecuadorian law, or Bahamian law) in terms of
the ordering of corporate relationships and neither purports to regulate such spheres of

corporate activity in detail.

As a matter of Bahamian law, the Perrodo heirs did not own the PIL shares as of the date of
consent. Ought this not to disentitle them from claiming indirect control over PEL? Should the

Tribunal not accord significant weight to this legal fact?

Given the absence of detailed general or conventional rules of international law governing the
organisation, operation, management and control of an enterprise, a tribunal should in principle
be guided by the more detailed prescriptions of the applicable municipal law.*?> But at the
same time, international law does not tend to permit formalities to triumph over fundamental

realities.°7° By way of example, in the field of diplomatic protection (which may, depending

upon the issue, be relevant to the interpretation of a BIT), when claims commissions and
arbitral tribunals have determined whether it is a person who holds the legal interest as
opposed to a person who holds the beneficial interest in shares that is entitled to seek
diplomatic protection, they have consistently found that it is the beneficial interest which is

deserving of protection.*?”

The diplomatic protection cases are not directly on point because where claims commissions
and tribunals have recognised the owners of beneficial interests, it has been in the context of
determining whether such beneficial owners were proper claimants even though they lacked
legal title to the assets in respect of which they were making a claim.** The present case is
different in that the beneficial owners of PIL at the material time are not claimants, but are
rather adducing evidence of their legal interests under French law and their beneficial interests
under Bahamian law in order to demonstrate that the Bahamian company that they ultimately

control is a proper claimant under the France-Ecuador Treaty.

A similar tension between the choices of proceeding on formalities or the fundamental
economic facts is evident in ICSID jurisprudence on the scope of the bare use of the word

“controlled” when determining the standing of a juridical person.*”? In Aguas del Tunari, S.A.

v. Republic of Bolivia, the tribunal considered the definition of the phrase “controlled directly
or indirectly.” The issue before it did not centre on the significance of “directly or indirectly”,
but whether the term “controlled” referred to formal legal ownership or extended to actual
exercise of control.*? The majority of the tribunal concluded that the “ordinary meaning of
‘control’ would seemingly encompass both actual exercise of powers or direction and the
rights arising from the ownership of shares.”**! It added that, as for the legal definition, it “also
encompasses both the actual exercise of control and the right to control”.* In his dissent, Mr.
José-Luis Alberro-Semerena suggested that since the word “controlled” was a past participle,
encompassing the effect of an action rather than just the capacity to perform said action, the
standing of a juridical person was established with evidence that it has received the effect of
actions of the controlling entity.*3 In his view it was “incorrect to equate ‘controlled’ and
‘control’” and “[o]ne should be ‘aware of the general principle of interpretation whereby a text

ought to be interpreted in the manner that gives it effect — ut magis valeat quam pereat.”**4

The tribunal members in Aguas del Tunari stood in agreement in one significant respect; that
is, the necessity of considering more than the formal capacity to control the juridical entity.

They diverged on whether this, in and of itself, can establish standing.

In the exceptional circumstances of this case, where except for legal title under Bahamian law,
French nationals manifested every indicia of control over the shares of PIL — including legal
ownership under the /ex situs of the estate — the Tribunal is of the view that it cannot take a
formalistic approach to the question of control. In this regard, the decision of the NAFTA
Tribunal in International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v United Mexican States warrants
note. That tribunal found that Article 1117 of the NAFTA which requires that the investor
bringing a claim on behalf of an enterprise demonstrate that it “own[s] or control[s]” the

enterprise, could be satisfied by a showing of de facto control:

Ibid.

Aguas del Tunari, paragraph 227.

Aguas del Tunari, paragraph 231. The Respondent at the hearing relies on the majority decision, stating “the test
for “control” presupposes an ownership interest” (Transcript, Day 1, p 239 (Mr. Gal)). The Tribunal accepts that
the majority in Aguas del Tunari emphasised the significance of ownership interest, but it did not exclude the
relevance of evidence of actual exercise of control (see paragraphs 227 to 231 of Aguas del Tunari).

“The Tribunal does not follow Mexico’s proposition that Article 1117 of the
NAFTA requires a showing of legal control. The term “control” is not defined in
the NAFTA. Interpreted in accordance with its ordinary meaning, control can be
exercised in various manners. Therefore, a showing of effective or “de facto”
control is, in the Tribunal’s view, sufficient for the purposes of Article 1117 of the
NAFTA. In the absence of legal control however, the Tribunal is of the opinion
that de facto control must be established beyond any reasonable doubt.

Despite Thunderbird having less than 50% ownership of the Minority EDM
Entities, the Tribunal has found sufficient evidence on the record establishing an
unquestionable pattern of de facto control exercised by Thunderbird over the
EDM entities. Thunderbird had the ability to exercise a significant influence on
the decision-making of EDM and was, through its actions, officers, resources,
and expertise, the consistent driving force behind EDM’s business endeavour in
Mexico.”** [Emphasis added]

In light of the above, it is significant that the evidence is that as of 17 October 2007, the French
nationals had legal ownership of the shares under French law, a fact recognised by Bahamian
law, and they have established that at that date they had de facto control of PIL and through it

the Bahamian subsidiaries.

Having regard to the fact that the text of the applicable provision of the Treaty refers simply to
“controlled”, the Tribunal is persuaded by the fact that the formal transfer of the shares of the
late Mr. Hubert Perrodo to his heirs was an administrative or ministerial act. It is true that it
occurred after the consent to ICSID arbitration was given, but it is also true that it could have
occurred at any time after the heirs became the owners of the estate under French law, and that
occurred at the time of death, namely, 29 December 2006, over 10 months prior to the giving

of consent.

Moreover, the evidence of French control is so substantial, so compelling and un-contradicted
that it is the Tribunal's view that in the circumstances of this case, it is most consonant with the
approach taken by international law to give weight to the fact of Bahamian law’s recognition

that the heirs owned the shares as a matter of French law and as a result they had beneficial

names.**°

For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal dismis

 

es the Respondent’s objection to the Claimant’s

standing to bring the claim under the Treaty.

CLAIMS OF BREACH OF TREATY

The Tribunal begins by identifying the law applicable to the claims of breach of Treaty, before

turning to consider the parties’ submissions and its findings on liability.

Law applicable to the claims relating to the Treaty

The Tribunal observes that, unlike the Participation Contracts, which specify Ecuadorian law
as the applicable law, the Treaty does not contain an express applicable law clause.
Accordingly, the Tribunal must apply Article 42(1), second sentence, of the ICSID

Convention, which provides as follows:

In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the
Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws)
and such rules of international law as may be applicable.

This requires the Tribunal to apply Ecuadorian law and international law. It is well-established

that the Treaty itself, as conventional law, falls within the phrase “such rules of international

In some of the commentaries and cases there has been some discussion of the desi
formalism when it comes to establishing a claimant's standing to bring a claim. For example, in Banro American
Resources, Inc and Société Aurifére du Kivu et du Maniema S.A.R.L. v. Democratic Republic of the Congo, I\CSID
Case No. ARB/98/7, Award (1 September 2000), at paragraph 11, the tribunal stated: "These few examples
demonstrate that in general, ICSID tribunals do not accept the view that their competence is limited by
formalities, and rather they rule on their competence based on a review of the circumstances surrounding the case,
and, in particular, the actual relationships among the companies involved. This jurisprudence reveals the
willingness of ICSID tribunals to refrain from making decisions on their competence based on formal
appearances, and to base their decisions on a realistic assessment of the situation before them.” The examples to
which the Banro tribunal referred were cases where the claimant, as the party requesting arbitration, was not the
same entity as the parties consenting to arbitration, and it was suggested by the tribunal that in such cases tribunals
are willing to consider the nationalities of the consenting party and the claimant when making their determinations
on jurisdiction. Banro has been discussed and distinguished from the case before the tribunal in the majority
decision in Tokios Tokelés v. Ukraine, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Decision on Jurisdiction (29 April 2004) at
paragraph 58, and discussed in the dissenting opinion of Professor Prosper Weil in the same case (see his
dissenting opinion in paragraphs 25-26), and by the dissenting opinion of Horacio Grigera Na6n in Murphy
Exploration and Production Company International v. Republic of Ecuador, 1CSID Case No. ARB/O8/4, Award
on Jurisdiction (15 December 2010), paragraphs 20-21.

law as may be applicable.” The Report of the Executive Directors on the Convention noted in
this regard that the term ‘international law’ as used in Article 42(1), second sentence, “should
be understood in the sense given to it by Article 38(1) of the Statute of the International Court
of Justice, allowance being made for the fact that Article 38 was designed to apply to inter-
State disputes.” A bilateral investment treaty falls within Article 38’s description of

international law.**”

The Tribunal therefore finds that the applicable law for the purposes of this claim is
Ecuadorian law (as already considered by the Tribunal) and the Treaty. In the event that there
is a conflict between the two, on the basis of well-established principle recognised in
international judicial and arbitral case law as well as in Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on
the Law of Treaties and Article 3 of the International Law Commission’s Articles on

Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, international law prevails.

Fair and Equitable Treatment under Article 4 of the Treaty
(LD) The Treaty
Article 4 of the Treaty provides as follows:

Each Contracting Party shall undertake to accord just and equitable treatment, in
accordance with the principles of international law, to the investments of
nationals and companies of the other Contracting Party and to ensure that the
exercise of the right so granted is not impeded either de jure or de facto.

In particular, but not exclusively, the following shall be considered as de jure or
de facto impediments to just and equitable treatment: any restrictions on the

Report of the Executive Directors on the Convention, paragraph 40.

 

As noted by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the Case of the Greek-Bulgarian Communities: “... it
is a generally accepted principle of international law that in the relations between Powers who are contracting
Parties to a treaty the provisions of municipal law cannot prevail over those of the treaty.” PCIJ Series B, No. 17,
p 32. It follows from that principle, as recognised the Case of the Treatment of Polish Nationals in Danzig, that a
State "cannot adduce against another State its own Constitution with a view to evading obligations incumbent
upon it under international law or treaties in force." PCIJ Series A/B. No. 44, p. 24. See also, Vienna Convention
on the Law of Treaties, Article 27, Internal law and observance of treaties: "A party may not invoke the provisions
of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty.” Article 3 of the ILC Articles on State
Responsibility, entitled, "Characterisation of an act of a State as internationally wrongful,” states: "The
characterisation of an act of a State as internationally wrongful is governed by international law. Such
characterisation is not affected by the characterisation of the same act as lawful by internal law.” Both Article 27
and Article 3 have been applied consistently by ICSID and other investment treaty arbitral tribunals.

Neither Contracting Party shall in any way impede the management, preservation,

(2) The Parties’ Positions
a. The Claimant’s Position

Perenco submitted that Law 42, both at 50% and at 99%, as well as other measures Ecuador

took in relation thereto amounted to a breach of the fair and equitable treatment obligation in

Article 45°

According to Perenco, the objective of the fair and equitable treatment standard is to:

“..provide to international investments treatment that that does not affect the
basic expectations that were taken into account by the foreign investor to make
the investment, as long as these expectations are reasonable and legitimate and
have been relied upon by the investor to make the investment.”*!

Perenco argued that its basic expectations were largely set forth in the Participation

842

Contracts.*”~ It had a legitimate expectation that Ecuador, by entering into the Participation

Revised Memorial, paragraph 155, quoting from Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd. v. United Republic of Tanzania,
ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Award (24 July 2008) (CA-5), paragraph 602. The Biwater tribunal articulated this
in connection with its explanation of the content of the fair and equitable treatment standard; it identified as
components of the standard the “protection of legitimate expectations,” the principle that “contracting parties must
act in good faith” and that the “conduct of the State must be transparent, consistent and non-discriminatory.”
Revised Memorial, paragraph 156: “They included the expectation that the fundamental economic deal was
settled based on the participation sharing agreed in the Contracts, that this was a stable basis for investing, and
that should disputes arise they would be settled by an orderly and peaceable process of international arbitration
rather than through local Ecuadorian procedures.” In its Reply, Perenco clarified the relationship between the
terms of the Participation Contracts and its legitimate expectations; the Participation Contracts “did not delimit the
investor expectations that Ecuador created”, though they “certainly reflected and reinforced these expectations.”

Contracts, agreed to tie the parties’ participation exclusively to the volume of production
generated by the contractor, thereby isolating it from oil price fluctuations, and that it would
not upset the underlying commercial bargain arrived at by taking action which would result in

drastic changes to participation percentages in response to price fluctuations in the global

843

market.*”” Ecuador undermined this expectation by enacting and enforcing Law 42.4 This

was compounded by the raising of the percentage of revenues demanded by Law 42 to 99% on
4 October 2007," the purpose of which was to “force companies like Perenco to ‘open the

profit box’ — essentially to take income that Perenco had borne all risk and expense to earn and

that by the originally agreed allocation formulae belonged to Perenco.”*°

Perenco submitted that it also held a reasonable expectation that the Participation Contracts
would not be amended given their clause 15.2 which required the prior agreement of the parties
for any amendments, this reinforced by statements of Ecuadorian Government officials in
2005." It relied on this understanding of the underlying commercial bargain when it chose to
put enormous capital at risk in Ecuador,** combined with the serious steps Ecuador had taken
to encourage foreign investment in Ecuador.*” In this way, Perenco argued it was justified in

its “eminently reasonable expectation” that Ecuador “would not take away the reward of the

Amended Request, paragraph 34; Revised Memorial, paragraphs 156-159, 169. At paragraph 282 of the Reply,
Perenco summarised its claim against Ecuador in the following terms: “Ecuador thus deliberately created an
environment in which a contractor could expect that it would operate under a production sharing model where the
economic benefit was allocated between the contractor and the State based on an agreed percentage of production,
that the contractor would not be unilaterally and coercively forced to abandon this model for a less profitable
services contract, and that any disputes over such economic matters would be peaceably resolved through binding
international arbitration.”

Revised Memorial, paragraph 167; Reply, paragraph 287. In this regard, Perenco, at paragraph 287 of its Reply,
characterised Ecuador’s conduct as having “concede[d] that the motive for these contractual amendments was to
achieve the State’s goal of imposing services contracts in place of participation contracts, thus undoing what the
prior governments had done.”

Ibid., paragraph 162. Perenco claimed that Ecuador in the years preceding its decision to invest actively courted
foreign investment "through a wide range of official actions,” including though not limited to “liberalization of
laws concerning the oil industry, such as the amendment to the [Hydrocarbons Law] that permitted participation
contracts” and “active Government support and encouragement for large scale investment required to construct
the OCP pipeline”: see Revised Memorial, paragraph 162.

investment once it had successfully managed the risk of that investment.”*” In this connection,
Perenco contended that when it sought in good faith to negotiate with Ecuador, Ecuador
responded inflexibly and unpredictably, ignoring its obligation to negotiate a correction factor

and to abide by the Decision on Provisional Measures.**!

Perenco further submitted that it had a legitimate expectation that disputes regarding the
investment would be “resolved peaceably through an international arbitration process at
ICSID.”**? This expectation was buttressed by the Participation Contracts themselves, which
expressly called for certain disputes to be resolved by ICSID arbitration.** Perenco maintained
that the dispute resolution procedure was an important aspect of its agreement with Ecuador
(set out in the Participation Contracts), on which it specifically relied.** In this connection,
Perenco challenged Ecuador’s “defiance” of the Tribunal’s Decision on Provisional Measures

as unfair and inequitable.**°

Perenco claimed that Ecuador’s actions in direct contravention of Perenco’s legitimate
expectations effectively removed a substantial portion of revenue to which Perenco was
entitled and rendered its investment in Blocks 7 and 21 commercially unviable.**° As such, it
requested that the Tribunal issue an award which declares, amongst other things, that Ecuador
failed to accord fair and equitable treatment to its investments in the Participation Contracts in
breach of its obligations under Article 4 of the Treaty and should be ordered to pay monetary

damages.

In addition, Perenco submitted that Ecuador breached Article 4 of the Treaty by interfering
with the management, use, enjoyment and transfer of its investment in Blocks 7 and 21. That
the right “to manage, use and enjoy its investments entailed that it would be permitted, within

the contractual parameters, to operate the Blocks, to seek and produce oil, to further invest in

additional wells and infrastructure, to direct the activities of employees, and to earn and benefit
from profits determined according to the agreed participation sharing formulae.”*°
However, as a result of Law 42, the Implementing Regulations and Ecuador’s actions in
relation thereto, Perenco contended that Ecuador “progressively and increasingly denied
Perenco the various attributes of management, use and enjoyment of its investments”:

First, by enacting and enforcing Law 42, Ecuador deprived Perenco of substantial

profits and blunted further investment in additional wells. Second, by lodging

coactivas and commencing seizures Ecuador deprived Perenco of all its

production, cargoes and revenue. Third, by seizing the Blocks themselves and

terminating the Contracts Ecuador prevented Perenco from any management, use
and enjoyment of the investments whatsoever.**

b. The Respondent’s Position

Ecuador for its part challenged whether the “legitimate expectation” as articulated by Perenco
was consistent with the terms of the Contracts:

Where, as in the present case, it is said that the investment is a set of contractual

rights conferred by the State, an investor’s purported ‘expectation’ within the

meaning of Article 4 of the Treaty will neither be reasonable nor capable of

reasonable reliance where it is inconsistent with the express terms of the contract
between the investor and the State.*”

Ecuador submitted that Perenco has failed to prove that Law 42 modified the economic bargain
upon which the terms of the Contracts were premised.5° It argued Law 42 could not modify

the Contracts because on a strict reading of its terms it did not affect the participation in

Revised Memorial, paragraph 176; Reply, paragraph 328.

Ibid. [Italics in original.].

Counter-Memorial, paragraph 465 [Italics in original.]. At paragraphs 272-276 of its Reply, Perenco submitted in
this regard that Ecuador improperly contends that its Treaty obligation of fair and equitable treatment is strictly
bounded by the terms of the Participation Contracts.

 

In this regard, Ecuador relies on the evidence of its expert, Dr. Aguilar. Dr. Aguilar at paragraphs 51-53 of his 3"
Expert Report states that Law 42 could not have modified the Participation Contracts because they established a
participation in crude oil and Law 42 did not change the percentages of participation in oil, only “the benefit that
can be obtained from its sale”, and further, that Law 42 was an administrative act which modified the legal
framework governing the contracts and was not “an administrative act intended to alter one or more specific
contracts.” Dr. Aguilar in his 4 Expert Report reiterates this distinction between the change in the legal
framework applicable to the Participation Contracts and a modification in its terms, while acknowledging that it is
apparent that the change in the legal framework had “an impact on the contractual relationship”: paragraphs 82-
84.

volume of oil that Perenco was entitled to receive.*°! The Participation Contracts did not
guarantee Perenco a right to a given revenue stream, let alone substantial profits, Thus,
Perenco faced an uphill battle in proving that Law 42 affected the economy of the Participation
Contracts and further that a correction factor to the Consortium’s participation in oil should

have been negotiated between the parties.°°

Ecuador suggested that Perenco’s submission was in essence an argument that an investor may

reasonably expect that the circumstances prevailing at the time it made its investment will

. 864
remain unchanged.

It stressed that this was not just contrary to settled jurisprudence on this
issue, but stood in stark contrast to the decision of the contracting parties not to include a

stabilisation clause in their contracts.*®°

In this connection, Ecuador submitted that, at best, the “only expectation which Perenco could
reasonably have entertained given the terms of its Participation Contracts with Ecuador was
that the State would negotiate a correction factor to the participation percentages” in the event
of a tax modification which disrupted the economy of the contracts.*® However, in this respect
Perenco has failed to discharge its burden of proving that the parties were obliged to negotiate
a correction factor as a result of Law 42, and that the failure to negotiate (if it was obliged to

do so) was due to the fault of Ecuador.**” Ecuador argued that it was incumbent upon Perenco

characterisation of its position, stating “[i]t is not Perenco’s position that a State’s laws cannot change over time,
or that the circumstances prevailing at the time of the investment would ‘remain totally unchanged’ (citation
omitted). However, this does not in and of itself mean that any subsequent regulation is compliant with a State’s
international obligations, particularly if the State created expectations as to the structure that would govern an
investment.” [Emphasis in original.]

significant factor when determining whether an investor legitimately held an expectation that it would not be
exposed to significant tax modifications in the future (paragraph 302 of the Award).

to provide the necessary financial impact data to Petroecuador in order for the adjustment

process to be initiated. *°*

Regarding Perenco’s claim that Ecuador breached Article 4 by interfering with Perenco’s use
and enjoyment of its investment, Ecuador submitted that the Participation Contracts did not
preclude the State from enacting and enforcing Law 42 because they did not guarantee Perenco
a right to a given revenue stream.*© Moreover, Law 42 did not ‘blunt’ further investment as
evidenced by the position adopted by Perenco during the provisional measures stage of this
arbitration that it could feasibly continue to operate and commit to necessary expenditure in

Ecuador if it paid the dues owed to Ecuador into an escrow account.*”

Ecuador further submitted that Perenco could not contend that the events subsequent to the
enactment of Law 42 and the termination of the Contracts interfered with the use and

enjoyment of its investment since the State was acting pursuant to a lawfully enacted law, and

was obliged to respond to Perenco’s own illegal conduct.*”!

Furthermore, Ecuador submitted that Perenco’s claims taken at its highest estimation is that
Law 42 prevented its ability to act “within the contractual parameters” of the Participation
Contracts, and that this cannot in and of itself constitute a breach of the Article 4 treaty
standard because Article 4 requires Perenco to further demonstrate that “any impediment to its

ability to exercise its contractual rights by the State was ‘obviously arbitrary’ or involved some

Counter-Memorial, paragraph 495.

Counter-Memorial, paragraph 496: “...Those dues, amounting to approximately US$ 327 million were precisely
the sums that Perenco offered, and the Arbitral Tribunal recommended at the preliminary measures stage, should
be paid into escrow by Perenco. It was Perenco’s case that it could perfectly well continue to operate, and make
the necessary investments, if it paid those dues into escrow. In those circumstances, Perenco cannot reasonably
contend that the manner in which Law 42 was applied in the instant case, including the lodging of coactivas and
the system of seizures of oil, would have left it in any different position that which it proposed and the Arbitral
Tribunal recommended.” [Emphasis in original.]

Counter-Memorial, paragraphs 495-498. In this regard, Ecuador contends that the temporary running of the
Blocks and the action seeking the termination of the Participation Contracts were expressly provided for in the
Contracts and Ecuadorian law as legitimate responses to Perenco’s alleged breach of contract: Counter-Memorial,

‘tortuous element’.”*” Perenco had failed to substantiate this in its submissions with respect to

Article 4.57

(3) The Tribunal’s Decision

Although the unofficial English translation of the Treaty published by the United Nations
Treaty Series uses the phrase “just and equitable treatment,” both disputing Parties have treated

the phrase as if it is “fair and equitable treatment” and rightly so.

As set out above, the Claimant’s submissions focus on two parts of Article 4: (i) what might be
called a general fair and equitable treatment argument advanced under Article 4, first
paragraph, based upon Perenco’s legitimate expectations; and (ii) a somewhat different
argument advanced under Article 4, fourth paragraph, based on the claim that by enacting Law
42 at 50% and by raising it to 99%, the Respondent impeded the management, preservation,

use, enjoyment or transfer of Perenco’s investments.

Article 4 sets out the general obligation to “accord [fair] and equitable treatment, in accordance
with the principles of international law” which is buttressed by the duty to ensure that the
exercise of the rights so granted is not impeded (either de jure or de facto). Examples of such
impediments are then set out in a non-exhaustive form in the second paragraph (“... [i]n
particular, but not exclusively, the following shall be considered as de jure or de facto
impediments to [fair] and equitable treatment...”). The second paragraph, which has not been
emphasised by the Claimant, is evidently designed to elaborate upon the last part of the first
paragraph. 874

The fourth paragraph, which has been invoked by the Claimant, also uses the word “impede.”
Given the use of this verb, it might also be thought to be, like the second paragraph, an
elaboration of the kind of conduct which could constitute a de jure or de facto impediment.
However, it can also be read as a separate obligation of a somewhat broader nature than the fair

and equitable treatment obligations set forth in the first paragraph. This is the basis on which

the Claimant has argued the case.*” The Tribunal will proceed on the basis that it is a separate

obligation.

The Tribunal will first deal with the general fair and equitable treatment claim and then

consider the impediment claim.

a. The general allegation of breach of fair and equitable treatment and the

Claimant’s legitimate expectations
The Claimant’s Article 4 claim has a number of separate, but interrelated strands. For the
purposes of analysis, the Tribunal will differentiate between claimed expectations pertaining to
the resolution of disputes arising under the Participation Contracts — i.e. the Claimant’s
entitlement to ICSID arbitration under the two Contracts and the Respondent’s conduct in
relation thereto — and its expectations of a more substantive nature —- i.e. the impact on
Perenco’s expectations of the enactment of Law 42, the application of Decree 662, and various
other measures taken by Ecuador in relation to Perenco’s rights under the Participation

Contracts. The Tribunal finds it convenient to deal with these expectations separately.

With respect to the general approach to be taken to the meaning of the fair and equitable
treatment standard, Article 4 of the Treaty requires a Contracting Party to accord “[fair] and
equitable treatment, in accordance with the principles of international law”.*” This particular
formulation of the standard is not tethered to the international minimum standard of treatment

under customary international law.6”7

 

Perenco’s rebuttal, at paragraphs 329-336 of the Reply, warrants note. Perenco stated that Ecuador conflates its
rebuttal to the claim for breach of fair and equitable treatment with that of breach of the obligation not to impede
or impair the investor's right to manage, use and enjoy; that there was in Ecuador’s view no breach of the terms of
the Participation Contracts. Perenco submitted that the latter obligation is distinct from the obligation to afford fair
and equitable treatment, and the observance of contractual obligations (which Perenco disputes occurred in its
case in any event) is not a sufficient answer.

Exhibit CE-7, Treaty, Article 4, paragraph 1 (PER 00520).

As noted by the tribunal in AWG Group Ltd. v. Argentine Republic, UNCITRAL, Decision on Liability (30 July
2010), which examined a similar treaty between Argentina and France (at paragraph 184): “With respect to the
Argentina-France BIT, it is to be noted that the text of the treaty refers simply to ‘the principles of international
law,’ not to ‘the minimum standard of customary international law.’ The formulation ‘minimum standard under
customary international law’ or simply ‘minimum international standard’ is so well known and so well-established
in international law that one can assume that if France and Argentina had intended to limit the content of fair and
equitable treatment to the international minimum standards they would have used that formulation specifically. In
fact, they did not.”

That said, as has been found by many other investment treaty tribunals presented with the task
of ascertaining the standard’s meaning — even where the applicable treaty contains no reference
to customary international law — there is much to be said for the general approach stated by the
tribunal in Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States, which characterised conduct

attributable to the State and injurious to the investor as violating the standard when it is:

...arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes
the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process
leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety - as might be the case
with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a complete
lack of transparency and candour in an administrative process.*”*

The inclusion of such words as “arbitrary,” the use of the adjectival modifiers “grossly” in
relation to “unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic,” and “manifest” in relation to a failure of natural
justice and “complete” in relation to a lack of transparency and candour implies a search for
the ‘something more’ that distinguishes an act in violation of international law from the
perceived unfairness occasioned by many governmental actions that do not rise to a breach of

international law. The challenge is to discern between the two.

Many cases hold that a central aspect of the analysis of an alleged breach of the fair and
equitable treatment standard is the investor’s reasonable expectations as to the future treatment
of its investment by the host State. *” This requires the Tribunal to make an objective

determination of such expectations having regard to all relevant circumstances. 58 The

tribunal then cited paragraph 98 of the Waste Management II award). In Vannessa Ventures Ltd. v. Bolivarian
Republic of Venezuela, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/6, Award (16 January 2013), at paragraph 227, the tribunal
commented: "Tribunals in other cases have pointed to be high threshold in this regard. In Waste Management, the
award referred to ‘‘a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety — as might be the
case with the manifest failure of natural justice...’ The Tribunal considers that to be the correct approach.” See
also Deutsche Bank AG v. Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, 1CSID Case No. ARB/09/2, Award (31
October 2012), at paragraph 420: “In this respect, the Tribunal notes that the standard has been rightly — although
not exhaustively — defined in the Waste Management II case” (which the tribunal then proceeded to set out).

expectations are not those exclusively of the investor and an undue reliance upon a claimant’s
subjective expectations expressed in the context of adversarial proceedings years after the
investment’s making, can result in a skewed view of what it could reasonably have expected
when it made the investment. In Saluka Investments BV v. Czech Republic the tribunal
observed, after having reviewed certain statements of prior tribunals, that if taken too literally,
they would impose “obligations which would be inappropriate and unrealistic” on the host
State.**! The search is for a balanced approach between the investor’s reasonable expectations

and the exercise of the host State’s regulatory and other powers.

In cases where a contract exists between the investor and the host State, the terms of the
contract and the State’s legislation in relation thereto, assume particular significance in the
analysis. As has already been seen, the relevant administrative contracts exist not only as ‘law
between the parties’ in Ecuador, but also within a broader framework of law, including the

Civil Code, the Hydrocarbons Law, and the Constitution.

Where a State has duly considered a legislative/regulatory policy, as was the case in 1994
when Ecuador resolved that it was in the nation’s interest to move from service to participation
contracts, governmental decisions taken thereafter must, during the lifetime of such contractual
arrangements maintain fidelity to that policy framework. This is not to say that the policy

framework is frozen and cannot be changed because this is not so unless the State has

 

expressly stabilised its law vis-d-vis its contractual counterparty.** But even as in the instant
case, where there is no full stability clause in its contracts, any changes to the policy

framework must still be made mindful of the State’s contractual commitments.

framework at a certain date, such that the adoption of any changes in the legal regulatory framework of the
investment concerned (even by law of general application and without any discriminatory intent by the host State)
would be illegal.”

The Participation Contracts were anchored in a legislative framework duly considered and
enacted by the Nation’s Congress. **3 That framework and its rationale set out certain key
features of the new contractual regime which were then reflected in the contracts subsequently
concluded with oil companies.*** Consequently, any contractor could reasonably expect that
the contracts’ structure would not be altered by Petroecuador unilaterally or undone by
subsequent State action external to the contract except in accordance with their terms and the

State’s law.

The dramatic rise in oil prices in the last decade should not be permitted to obscure this.
Particularly after changes in government occur, States must seek to act consistently with, and
governments cannot wilfully repudiate, long-term commercial relationships with foreign
investors concluded by their predecessors. **° New governments must bear in mind why the
State engaged in such relationships in the first place, because resource extraction and other
capital-intensive investments with substantial ‘up-front’ costs generally require a medium to
long-term period of operations in order to be able to generate a reasonable return on
investment. Such investments must be able to withstand deviations in governmental policy that

could undermine their contractual framework.

i. | What expectations did Perenco have at the time of the making of
its investment?

 

There is no record evidence that the Respondent made any specific representations or gave any
specific assurances to Perenco that induced it to acquire Kerr McGee’s interests in the two

contracts.

Mr. Patrick Spink, who evaluated the Kerr McGee opportunity for Perenco, testified that the

company “took great comfort in the relatively clear terms of key aspects of the Participation

Exhibit CE-4, Law 44 Legislative Debates, PER 00481: “Third objective of the reforms: Who is going to invest in
these [six] exploration capitals? The private companies. In the last five years there has not been a single petroleum
exploration contract signed in Ecuador. How do we make the investment in Ecuador more attractive? Through this
new type of contract, the participation contract which is used in every country which produces oil.”; see also,
Exhibit CE-5, Law 44, PER 00487: “That more investments are required for exploration and exploitation of
hydrocarbons...it is essential to introduce contractual systems into Ecuador's legislation that will make
hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation competitive.”

Contracts” **°

and noted that “Ecuador had also sent other signals that it welcomed foreign
investment in the oil sector and intended to continue to support a business and legal
environment conducive to such investment,” referring in particular to the construction of the
OcP pipeline.**” Mr. Spink testified further that his perception of Ecuador’s commitment to
the development of its oil industry in partnership with foreign investors was “reinforced by the
limited contact [he] had with Ecuadorian Government officials,” noting that shortly after the
signature of the Kerr McGee deal, he had a courtesy meeting with Ecuador’s former Minister

888

of Energy and Mines, Dr. Teran.”” In short, although Perenco took comfort from the terms of

the contracts and the OCP project, Mr. Spink did not claim that he received express

commitments from Ecuadorian officials prior to Perenco’s making the investment.**?

Thus, Perenco’s expectations were, as the Claimant generally pleaded the case, basically

founded upon the Participation Contracts which in turn reflected the provisions of Law 44,5

With respect to the expectations of Perenco’s predecessor in interest, Oryx/Kerr McGee, the
Tribunal recalls that Ecuador’s move from service contracts to participation contracts was
motivated by the nation’s inability to adequately develop its petroleum resources.*”! In such
circumstances, an investor such as Oryx/Kerr McGee could reasonably expect at the time of
the acquisition of its contractual rights that so long as it acted consistently with its legal and
contractual obligations, it would be entitled to receive its share of petroleum pursuant to its
contract, and that it would be free to dispose of that share with the expectation that, subject to
the payment of all taxes and other levies, it would be entitled to make whatever profit remained

after the costs of doing business.**? Given Article 10 of Law 44°” and Decree 141784, both of

which were expressly incorporated into the Participation Contracts, and both of which stated

8° the contractor could also

that amendments “required the prior agreement of the parties,
reasonably expect that the contract would not be unilaterally amended by Petroecuador in a

manner which was inconsistent with Ecuadorian law.

Consistent with its prior determination that the Contracts were not stabilised as understood by
by Ecuadorian law, the Tribunal sees force in Ecuador’s argument that without a full
stabilisation clause in the contracts, the contractor could not reasonably expect that the
contracts would be completely immunised from future legislative or other measures.*”° That
said, the contractor could also reasonably expect that the taxation modification clauses could

be employed in appropriate circumstances.*?”

There is no suggestion that the two Contracts did not operate in accordance with their terms up
to the date of the sale of Kerr McGee’s interests to Perenco. Given Kerr McGee’s experience,
there was no reason why Perenco should not have held essentially the same expectations as its

predecessor in interest." Perenco did not suggest that the Participation Contracts did not

windfall revenues for the State” (Counter-Memorial, paragraph 471). Perenco states first, that it could and “in fact
did” expect that it would “benefit from higher oil prices in proportion to the contractually agreed participation
formula”, and then follows this by asserting that regardless of whether or not this was the case, it “certainly had
every right to expect that Ecuador would not entirely deprive it of the upside from sales at higher oil prices” since
that was a “fundamental benefit” of participation contracts: Reply, paragraph 285 [Emphasis in original.].

made by Executive Decree No. 1672, the law’s implementing decree issued on 11 July 2006.

ii. Dispute _settlement_expectations based_on__the Participation
Contracts

Perenco emphasised that quite apart from its expectations as to how the Contracts would
operate generally, it had other legitimate expectations, namely, that any disputes arising under
the Participation Contracts would be resolved peaceably through arbitration. It noted in this
regard:

Perenco also had every reason to expect that disputes regarding the investment

would be resolved peaceably through an international arbitration process at

ICSID. As the Tribunal has already determined, after the Congress in 1986 had

confirmed its ratification of the ICSID Convention, the Contracts themselves

expressly called for economic disputes to be resolved by ICSID arbitration...

Pursuant to Clause 22.1 of the Block 21 Contract, the parties even incorporated
the ICSID Convention as part of the Contract’s ‘legal framework.’*”

This agreement to resolve disputes through arbitration in Perenco’s view “certainly implied an
agreement to honor decisions of an arbitral tribunal” and Perenco noted that this expectation
was made explicit as a contractual promise in clauses 22.2.2, by which both parties undertook
to use the means set forth in the Contract “to resolve doubts and disputes that may arise during
its life, and to observe and comply with the decisions of the competent consultants, arbitrators,

judges or courts, as the case may be, pursuant to the provisions of this Contract.”°°

Having set out its expectations based upon the contracts, including their arbitration provisions,

Perenco then asserted that Ecuador undermined its expectations of the economic terms of the

 

899

900

crude-oil prices in the weeks preceding, different prices should be stipulated to apply during the course of the
contractual term; namely, “US$ 17 through 2002; from 2003 to 2006, a price of US$ 16; and from 2007 to 2010, a
price of US$ 15.” This was not accepted by Oryx because, according to the memorandum prepared by
"s Cc “this was uncertain in terms of its behavior, to the
point of it being at US$ 8 in May 1998, when the company accepted it at US$ 15 and historically the trend had
demonstrated it to be below US$ 15.” The memorandum further records that Oryx on the basis of the same
reasoning rejecting an alternative proposal; that “an average of US$ 17 per barrel be set, with the parties equitably
sharing the surplus at 50% each.”

deal by enacting and enforcing Law 42." It also argued that the Respondent’s initiation of the
coactiva process to collect sums claimed to be due, which in turn led to the various requests
and orders of the Tribunal in relation to the process of its considering and ultimately granting
the provisional measures sought by Perenco, and Ecuador’s subsequent disregard of the
provisional measures recommendation amounted to an additional breach of fair and equitable
treatment (as well as a breach of contract). But for this latter breach, it argued, Perenco
would still be operating in Ecuador today and a large escrow balance would have

903
accumulated.

Ecuador argued in response that in order to succeed on this argument Perenco would have to
demonstrate that the notion of “legitimate expectations” on which it relied was well-founded
and consistent with the terms of the Participation Contracts.°™ Ecuador submitted that Perenco
failed to do so because its argument presupposed that Ecuador was required contractually to
abide by the “request of 24 February 2009 and the Arbitral Tribunal’s recommendation of
provisional measures.”””® It contended that the Participation Contracts created an expectation
that the parties would submit to ICSID arbitration specified disputes and abide by the final
award.” It could not support the expectation that Ecuador would be bound to comply with the

Tribunal’s recommendations of provisional measures.°””

Alternatively, Ecuador submitted that should the Tribunal find that such expectation is well-
founded, Ecuador’s actions in alleged breach could not be said to be causative of any loss to
Perenco.””* In particular, it did not cause Perenco to abandon the Blocks.” Ecuador’s actions

were declared as a consequence of Perenco’s actions, and it demanded the payment of dues or

seized their equivalent in crude that Perenco already agreed to set aside and represented could

do so without requiring it to abandon the Blocks (by placing it in escrow).?!°

The Tribunal agrees with Perenco that the expectation of peaceable resolution of disputes
pursuant to the Contracts’ arbitration clauses was a reasonable and legitimate expectation of
the private contractor (whether the original contractor or its successor in interest). It will deal
with the Respondent’s response to the Tribunal’s Decision on Provisional Measures separately
below, but for present purposes it will consider the general expectation of peaceable settlement

of disputes and whether that expectation has been met.

Perenco did not move to challenge Law 42 either under the Contracts or under the Treaty until
after Ecuador began to apply Decree 662 to it. (Perenco consented to ICSID arbitration on 17
October 2007, some thirteen days after Decree 662 was issued. It filed its Request for
Arbitration on 30 April 2008.°!') Putting to one side for the moment the Respondent’s decision
not to comply with the Provisional Measures Decision, the arbitration has unfolded in
accordance with the Contracts. Ecuador has participated fully herein, has exercised its right to
make objections, and has contested the merits of the claims after the Decision on
Jurisdiction.°” Indeed, it has filed a counterclaim against Perenco for alleged environmental

damage.

In the Tribunal's view, Perenco’s claims that Ecuador has denied it fair and equitable treatment
in relation to its procedural expectations of access to international dispute settlement generally

have not been made out.

iii. | Expectations with respect to the Decision on Provisional Measures
Turning to the narrower question of the Claimant’s claimed expectation of Ecuador’s

compliance with the Decision on Provisional Measures, the Tribunal has already found that as

comply not only with any award of a tribunal, but also with a broader category of “decisions”.
Thus, the Claimant justifiably had a reasonable expectation that if a dispute arose between the
parties, the Respondent would comply with all decisions of a tribunal constituted pursuant to
the Contracts. Having found that there was a breach of contract for Ecuador’s failure to comply
with the Tribunal’s Decision on Provisional Measures, as set out above at paragraphs 413 to
417, the Tribunal considers it is therefore not necessary to deal with arguments regarding the

effect of the Decision on Provisional Measures under Article 4 of the Treaty.

iv. Substantive expectations relating to the Contracts
In advancing its allegation of breach, the Claimant tended to conflate a series of measures
which were taken at different times over a course of some four years. In its pleadings, the
Claimant tended to lump together: (i) Law 42 at 50%; (ii) the promulgation and application of
Decree 662;

 

ii) the Correa administration’s demands for the migration of participation
contracts to a service contract model; (iv) the subsequent demand for a faster migration to
service contracts than that initially sought; (v) the demands for payment of levies claimed to
have been owed under Law 42; (vi) the launching of coactivas; (vii) the decision to enforce the
coactivas notwithstanding the Tribunal’s recommendation that it not do so during the pendency
of the arbitration; and (viii) the breakdown in negotiations which led to the Consortium’s
decision to suspend operations, which in turn led to the initiation of the proceeding resulting in

the declaration of caducidad.’'*

Listing these measures, taken over a period of some four years, illustrates the deepening and
intensification of the State’s demands and actions. When evaluating the international
lawfulness of Law 42 at 50%, however, the Tribunal will consider this measure separately

from the measures which ensued. In the course of this analysis, it will be evident that certain of

For example, following a proposed settlement offer by Perenco on 21 May 2009, its representatives were
summoned to meet Ecuador’s Minister of Mines and Petroleum where, in the evidence of Mr. d’Argentré, they
were informed that President Correa was offended by the settlement offer and Ecuador would not comply with the
provisional measures recommendation. Subsequently, when Minister Palacios was replaced by Minister Pinto on
8 June 2009, representatives of Perenco met with him to discuss settlement terms. Minister Pinto’s statements,
according to Mr. d’Argentré, which were not disputed by Ecuador, maintained Ecuador’s position that in order to
cease coactiva enforcement measures, the Consortium would have to agree to pay all outstanding Law 42 amounts
under a payment plan (amongst other conditions). Perenco did not agree to this. This pattern of interaction
continued through to and during the course of the auction of the consortium’s crude on 3 July 2009 and 20 July
2009.

916

the Tribunal’s determinations in regard to the alleged breaches of contract assume importance
in the Treaty claim. To some extent, the Treaty analysis mirrors the contract analysis.
However, in contrast to its contractual jurisdictional mandate, in exercising its jurisdiction to
apply the Treaty, the Tribunal is not bound by Ecuadorian law or by the courts’ interpretation

of that law, although it will defer to an authoritative interpretation of the domestic law.

b. Law 42 at 50%

The Tribunal begins with some comments on the relationship between the Constitutional Court
proceedings and the Treaty claims, the characterisation of Law 42 for the purposes of
international law, and a reference to a prior investment treaty case that has considered windfall
taxes. With respect to this latter point, the Tribunal considers that the substantial upwards
movement of oil prices in the last decade fell outside of the expectations of the original parties
to the Participation Contracts and generated windfall profits. The expert evidence before the

Tribunal shows that Ecuador’s initial response thereto was not unlike that of many other States.

Turning to the Consitutional Court’s decision, the fact that the Court has spoken on Law 42’s
constitutionality does not of course preclude this Tribunal from exercising its jurisdiction under
the Treaty to consider the international lawfulness of Law 42. But in applying international
law, the Tribunal does not act as a court of appeal on questions of Ecuadorian law. This
jurisdictional limit is well-established in the jurisprudence.°'° The Tribunal must recognise the
allocation of competencies between adjudicatory bodies at the national and international levels.
An international tribunal cannot second-guess the court's interpretation and application of local
law.”!° At the same time, under well-established principles of international law, as codified in

Article 3 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, the fact that a law has been declared

constitutional by the local courts, even by the highest court of the land, is not dispositive of

whether it was in conformity with international law.”

As for the proper characterisation of Law 42, the Tribunal has already found that for the
purposes of the contractual claims, Law 42 is to be characterised as a taxation measure. In the
context of the Treaty claim, it has carefully considered Perenco’s complaint as to Ecuador’s
“opportunistic” change in the measure’s characterisation between the constitutional court
proceedings and this international arbitration:°'*

Ecuador cannot have it both ways: it cannot both insist it is entitled to special

deference when exercising its powers of taxation, and insist that it is not engaged

in taxation when it desires to sidestep its contractual obligations related to
«919
taxation.

While it is possible for a measure to be characterised differently under different legal systems,
the municipal and international, the Respondent's inconsistency in characterisation depending
upon the forum and applicable law is troubling. In the end, following the approach taken in
EnCana v. Ecuador when it comes to determining whether a measure is to be characterised as
a tax for the purposes of international law, the Tribunal has concluded that it should focus on
the Law 42’s substantive effect (i.e., whether a liability was imposed upon a class of persons to
pay a portion of “extraordinary revenues” to and for the benefit of the State).°”° It is buttressed
in this conclusion by the fact that the law’s characterisation during the Constitutional Court
proceeding in no way precluded Perenco itself from characterising it as a tax which gave rise to

its right to claim a modification of the Contracts.””!

As a final introductory comment, it is well recognised in investment treaty arbitration that

States retain flexibility to respond to changing circumstances unless they have stabilised their

relationship with an investor. In Paushok v. Mongolia, for example, the tribunal discussed the

claimant’s expectations in relation to a windfall tax, noting:

There is no doubt that the [Windfall Profit Tax] represented a radical change in
the taxation of the gold mining industry in Mongolia and that it had a severe
negative impact upon the industry as a whole and upon GEM in particular. But
this does not mean that the enactment of such legislation was contrary to the
Treaty. An investor, without an agreement which limits or prohibits the
possibility of tax increases, should not be surprised to be hit with tax increases in
subsequent years and such an event could not be considered as ‘unpredictable’.
Mongolia is far from being the only country in the world were dramatic
unforeseen increases in the price of certain commodities has led to major changes
in taxation regimes of those commodities. Before concluding that a particular
taxation level alters ‘the predictability of the business and legal framework’ of a
country, an international arbitration tribunal will want to see a clear
demonstration that, absent such an agreement, such increase in taxation
constitutes a breach of an international obligation of that country. ~

 

Paushok’s emphasis on “an agreement which limits or prohibits the possibility of tax
increases” underscores the significance of the Tribunal’s finding that although there was such
an agreement in this case, it was not adequately pursued such as to be shown to have been
futile in 2007 (until the application of Decree 662). It further underscores the Tribunal’s earlier
finding that to the extent that Perenco’s expectations are derived from its contractual rights, the
Contracts as a whole, including their taxation modification clauses, not just the “economic

bargain” clauses, must be considered.

The Tribunal also sees support in Paushok for its view that a consideration of legitimate
expectations should include a consideration of industry practices and expectations. Given the
oil industry’s typically expected returns and its experience with governmental responses to
market changes, it would be unsurprising to an experienced oil company that given its access

to the State’s exhaustible natural resources, with the substantial increase in world oil prices,

 

there was a chance that the State would wish to revisit the economic bargain underlying the

contracts.°”* In its pleadings, Perenco itself emphasised its good faith efforts to negotiate with

In its 1“ Report, Fair Links commented at paragraph 62: "...as the owners of the non-renewable resources, States
will inevitably determine how to share the extractive revenue with the extractive companies. Where the extractive
revenues significantly outstrip the reasonable expected returns due to contractors, there is no general assumption
in the industry that the extractive company will enjoy the entirety of the windfall profits. On the contrary, States
do generally intervene (and have historically intervened) to reassert a proportionate share of extractive revenues

186

589.

591.

592.

Ecuador.°”4 In Perenco’s statements and in its conduct, the Tribunal sees evidence of this type
of business judgement (albeit one exercised in increasingly difficult conditions). Perenco’s
repeated efforts to reach a mutually satisfactory adjustment of its relationship with Ecuador is
consistent with Fair Links’ description of the oil industry’s general experience with the

renegotiation of oil contracts in changed circumstances.°”
With these points in mind, the Tribunal turns to its consideration of the Article 4 claims.

c. Did Law 42 violate Article 4?

The Tribunal’s three findings in respect to the taxation modification clauses made in its breach
of contract analysis apply equally to the Article 4 claim: (i) the Contracts’ taxation
modification clauses were drafted to encompass new forms of taxation such as Law 42; (ii)
new taxes per se did not generate an automatic adjustment in the ‘X’ factor; and (iii) Perenco

did not prove that resort to this contractual remedy was futile.

The Tribunal is presented with a situation where organs of the State other than Perenco’s
contractual counterparty modified the Contracts’ operation through the exercise of sovereign
power not open to ordinary contracting parties. The market conditions in which the State acted
were, in the Tribunal’s view, quite extraordinary and the widespread array of measures taken
by other States during this time satisfies the Tribunal that seeking an adjustment of the
economic rent derived from exhaustible natural resources was not per se arbitrary,

unreasonable or idiosyncratic.

It has already been found that Petroecuador was not automatically in breach of contract when
the Congress enacted Law 42 or when the Executive fixed the 50% rate. Rather, Perenco was
faced with a measure taken by the Congress which could give rise to a breach of contract if

Petroecuador refused to negotiate or if, its having agreed to negotiate, it refused to accept

 

924

925

above those which would reasonably be due to contractors for their investment, risk and industrial performance,
i.e. their reasonable initial economic expectations.” This led it to comment in its Summary 3: “Since the State is
the owner of the non-renewable resources, investors with concession-type contracts inelastic to price would
reasonably expect the State to find solutions in a high-price scenario to reassert a proportionate share of
extractive revenues above those which would reasonably be due to contractors for their investment, risk and
industrial performance, i.e. their reasonable initial economic expectations.” [Italics in original.]

persuasive evidence tendered by Perenco that Law 42 had adversely affected the Contracts’
economy and/or refused to agree a correction factor. But just as it could not be found that
Petroecuador was in breach of contract until such time as clauses 11.12/11.7 were tested and
proven to be futile, subject to what is discussed below, it likewise cannot be found that
Ecuador was in breach of Article 4 when it enacted Law 42 and began to collect payment of
the amounts claimed to be due. It cannot be said at this point in the chronology of events, that
Ecuador’s having modified the Contracts’ operation, it then foreclosed the exercise of
Perenco’s intra-contractual recourse (or for that matter precluded it from seeking recourse to
contractual and Treaty arbitration). Had the contractual route been pressed and had
Petroecuador refused to engage in negotiations as to the claimed disturbance of the Contract’s
economy or to agree on a correction factor, the situation before the Tribunal would have been

different.

In addition, the Tribunal would have little difficulty holding that a fully stabilised contract that
did not admit of any future legislative or other change cannot be changed unilaterally, but this
is not the case here.°”° Insofar as this aspect of the fair and equitable treatment claim is
concerned, given the precise expression of the parties’ contractual rights and obligations,
Perenco has not proven that resort to the taxation modification process would have been futile.
Therefore, the Tribunal declines to find the Respondent in breach for enacting and applying

Law 42.

While Perenco is correct to point out that Article 31-A of Hydrocarbons Law established that
oil contracts may be amended provided that the contractor’s consent is obtained and that this
statutory premise was reflected in the Contracts themselves, if the prior modification
negotiations process itself was not pursued, it cannot be held that this common consent could
not have been reached. Clause 15.2 of both Contracts shows that the amendment of each

Contract follows modification negotiations. Had such negotiations been pressed and resulted in

927

a satisfactory adjustment of the Contracts’ economic terms, the Contracts would have then

been amended by consent of both parties.°””

The Tribunal has attached such weight to the availability of the contractual remedy because it
believes that, objectively speaking, the oil market conditions in 2006-07 were profoundly
different from those prevailing at the time of contracting and that this fact could hardly be
denied in negotiations. Perenco had evidently generated good financial returns and it behooved
both parties to the Contracts to negotiate with a view to agreeing what impact Law 42 had on
the economy of the Contracts in the changed market conditions and what was to be done about

it.
d. The impediment claim

As noted earlier, Perenco also relies upon the prohibition against a Contracting Party’s
impeding the management, preservation, use, enjoyment or transfer of the investments of
nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party. The Tribunal considers that while they
were certainly affected by the application of Law 42, the management, preservation, use, etc.

of Perenco’s investments were not impeded.
The Tribunal finds support for its conclusion in the following evidence.

First, Law 42 at 50% was restricted specifically to the question of so-called “extraordinary
revenues” and did not purport to impede the management, preservation, use, of Perenco

Ecuador Ltd. itself or its investments.

Second, it did not purport to fundamentally alter the structure of the contracts. Perenco

continued to be entitled to the volumes calculated pursuant to the contracts, and 50% of the

For example, clause 15.2 of the Block 21 Contract provided: “Contractual amendments: Amending contracts
may be negotiated and executed, by agreement of the Parties, in particular in the following cases:...c) When the
tax regime, employee profit sharing or currency treatment applicable to this type of Contract in the country has
been modified, in order to restore the economy of the Contract; f) Due to other reasons in the State’s interes
duly agreed to by the Ministry of Energy and Mines and the Contractor, in accordance with the Law. In the cases
contemplated in items a), b), d), e), and f) above, the modification must be authorized by the Special Bidding
Committee, upon prior favorable reports from the Attorney General, the Joint Command of the Armed Forces,
PETROECUADOR’s Administrative Council, and the Ministry of Energy and Mines. In the case of a
modification pursuant to (c) above, only the authorization of PETROECUADOR’s Administrative Council shall
be required.” (Exhibit CE-10, PER 04703) [Bolding in original.]

extraordinary revenues generated therefrom. Throughout this period, Perenco was free to use

its investments to generate substantial revenues.

Third, there is no persuasive record evidence that Law 42 at 50% “blunted further
investment”.°”* The Tribunal has already referred to Mr. Spink’s testimony with respect to
Perenco’s expectation that it expected to recover relatively quickly the capital invested if oil
remained at US $20/barrel. If it could do so at US $20/barrel, it could do so at say, US $40 or
US $50/barrel with the parties splitting the extraordinary revenues above the reference price.
Indeed, in November 2006 (some six months after Law 42’s enactment), the consortium
submitted an amendment to the development plan for Block 7 related to the Oso field. The
consortium considered three price scenarios for the 2007-2010 period; two of the three
considered the price of oil at above the Law 42 reference price of US $29.6 (ie., at US
$34/barrel and US $39/barrel). All three scenarios showed significant positive cash flows to the
contractors and in fact higher positive cash flows then would have resulted had the price of oil
been below the reference price.” After the plan was approved, commencing in April 2006
through to October 2007, the consortium invested an additional US $61 million and drilled an

22°

additional 15 wells in the fiel Had Law 42 at 50% truly impeded the management, use, etc.

of the investments, the development plan would not have been pursued.

On the basis of the available record evidence, therefore, the Tribunal considers that in 2006-
2007, with the then-prevailing price of Napo and Oriente crude and with Law 42 at 50%,
Perenco was still generating significant cash flows and appeared to be quite profitable.
Obviously, it was not enjoying the windfall that it would have enjoyed in the absence of Law
42, but until the amount claimed by the State was increased to 99%, Perenco still generated a
greater cash flow than its business case assumed in its due diligence performed when acquiring

Kerr McGee’s interests in the two blocks.

In all of the circumstances, therefore, the Tribunal finds that Law 42 per se did not amount to a

breach of Article 4 of the Treaty.

e. Law 42 at 99%

603. It has already been found that Decree 662 breached the Participation Contracts by increasing
Ecuador’s participation to 99% of the value of all sales of oil above the reference price and
thus effectively removing virtually all of the upside potential above the reference prices. It also

marked the beginning of demands for the contractors to make a transition to service contracts.

604. Perenco argued in connection with the effect of Decree 662 that:

There can be no question that this ‘change in the legal framework’ was
fundamental. No dissection of individual contractual provisions or sophisticated
economic analysis is required to appreciate that if the State takes 99% of revenue
over a given reference price, that is effectively the same thing as a services
contract with a fee in the amount of that reference price. In both instances the
investor has no opportunity to participate in the upside of higher oil prices.”*!

605. It elaborated upon this point in the course of discussing the ADC v. Hungary award:

In the present case Ecuador likewise took aim at the foundations of the contracts
and effectively destroyed them. Its unilateral abrogation of one of the essential
features of the participation contract — namely, the prospect of upside benefits — is
conceptually akin to outlawing contracts containing such provisions altogether.
Of course, through caducidad, Ecuador rendered impossible any continued
operations at all.”

606. The Tribunal has already made a finding to this effect (at paragraphs 407 to 410). It agrees
with Perenco’s argument that the application of the law at 99% rendered a participation
contract essentially the same as a service contract. Moreover, Decree 662 marked the
beginning of a series of other measures in breach of Article 4 taken in relation to the
Participation Contracts, namely: (i) demanding that the contractors agree to surrender their
rights under their participation contracts and migrate to what for a considerable period of time
was an unspecified model, such that the contractors were unable to discern precisely what they
were being asked to move to; (ii) escalating negotiating demands, in particular in April 2008
when the President unexpectedly suspended the negotiations and rejected what had recently
been achieved in a Partial Agreement in respect of one of the blocks; (iii) making coercive and

threatening statements, including threats of expulsion from Ecuador; and (iv) taking steps to

enforce Law 42 against Perenco (and Burlington) for non-payment of dues claimed to be
owing, a portion of which has been held to be in breach of Article 4, and when no payments
were made, forcibly seizing and selling the oil produced in Blocks 7 and 21 in order to realise
the claimed Law 42 debt. This set the stage for the Consortium’s suspension of operations and
ultimately the declaration of caducidad which formally terminated the Consortium’s rights in

the two blocks.

The Tribunal has already noted that Ecuador has not contested the Claimant’s assertion that
Decree 662 was intended to force a renegotiation of the participation contracts in order to
migrate Petroecuador’s counterparties to service contracts.°*? In the Tribunal’s view, moving
beyond 50% to 99% with the application of Decree 662 amounted to a breach of Article 4 of
the Treaty and the measures, taken collectively, just listed also constituted breaches of

Article 4.

Decree 662 had the intended effect of inducing the Consortium to write to Petroecuador setting
out a financial proposal for the renegotiation of the two Participation Contracts. Discussions
between the parties led Petroecuador and Perenco to sign Minutes of Partial Agreement on 11
March 2008 in relation to Block 7 which, if implemented, would have: (i) permitted Perenco to
operate the block under the participation contract model for a period of five years after which it
would be migrated to another contract model; (ii) would have extended its contractual term,
scheduled to expire in 2010, to 2018; (iii) would have increased the State’s participation share
for the period 2008-2010 and then have it linked to oil prices for the period 2010-2018; and

(iv) would have amended the statutory reference price to US $42.50/barrel.°*

The Tribunal is hesitant to accord much weight to tentative agreements negotiated under
conditions of such duress because Perenco can reasonably say that all such negotiations were
intended to make the best of a bad situation. That said, it appears that at least some of the
damage which ensued from Decree 662 could have been avoided had the parties been able to
put what was agreed in the March 2008 Partial Agreement into a final, executed amending
Counter-Memorial, paragraph 626; Rejoinder, paragraphs 13-14; Perenco in its Reply, at paragraph 287, asserted
that the Respondent had conceded “that the motive for these contractual amendments was to achieve the State's

goal of imposing services contracts in place of participation contracts, thus undoing what the prior governments
had done.”

contract for Block 7 (and had they concluded a similar amending contract for Block 21). A
review of the terms shows that the arrangement was capable of benefitting both Perenco and

the State, and their contractual relationship would have been modified by agreement.

However, on 12 April 2008, without advance notice to Perenco (or it appears to any of the
other oil companies then engaged in discussions with the State), President Correa announced
that the negotiations would be suspended and all existing production sharing contracts would
be terminated unilaterally with the result that new contracts would be signed by the oil

companies. In making this announcement, President Correa asserted:

I said 45 days, I think in January, for renegotiation of the contracts ... We were
close to a deal, but I stopped it, because, even though we’ve secured major
benefits, I think that we can do better.»

Two days after this announcement, Perenco wrote to the Minister of Mines and Petroleum
expressing its “deep concern derived from the Ecuadorian Government’s announcement to put
an end to the current negotiations.”°*° This was followed two weeks later with the resolution of
the Board of Directors of Perenco S.A. to commence ICSID arbitration against Ecuador and

Petroecuador.*” At this point, Perenco and Burlington began to withhold payments of Law 42

dues, depositing the same instead into a segregated account located outside of Ecuador.”**

The evidence suggests that Perenco could have lived with the March Partial Agreement.
Obviously, it would have preferred the existing contractual regime and no Law 42, and it was

negotiating under the considerable pressure of Decree 662, but the Tribunal considers that

Perenco’s persistent efforts to achieve a mutually acceptable renegotiation of its contracts
supports the finding that it would have accepted the terms of the Partial Agreement had they
not been repudiated in April?”

The Respondent acknowledged that the President’s decision to hasten the migration of the
contracts to service contracts within a year had the effect of suspending negotiations with all of
the oil companies, including Perenco.“° Under increasingly difficult circumstances, Perenco

continued to seek a negotiated solution.

Negotiations resumed in May 2008 with Ecuador submitting a new draft Transitory Agreement
pursuant to which: (i) the parties would make their “best efforts” to migrate to a service
contract within 120 days (the model for which had not yet been developed by the State’s
external legal advisers); (ii) Perenco would be obliged to maintain the levels of investment
originally proposed for 2008; and (iii) the ICSID proceedings would be suspended.™*! Perenco
objected to these proposed terms.” In its view, they were less advantageous than the terms of
the March Partial Agreement, and at this time, the draft proposed service contracts was not
available for review which meant that the contractors’ commitment to the Transitory
Agreement would be sight unseen as to the terms of the contract to which they were expected
to migrate.°

On 10 July 2008, Ecuador proposed another draft Transitory Agreement which, if
implemented, would require Perenco to migrate to a service contract within one year of its
In this regard, the evidence of Mr. Eric d’Argentré, the Country Manager for Perenco in Ecuador at the relevant
time is that by “April 2008, Perenco was making what [he] considered to be good progress towards a deal with the
Government. The deal being discussed would have given Ecuador a greater participation than it was entitled to
under the Participation Contracts, but also contained some potential benefits for Perenco and Burlington”: see 1
Witness Statement of Eric d’Argentré, paragraph 8. Similarly, Mr. Derlis Palacios, who was the Minister of Mines
and Petroleum until June 2009, confirms in his written evidence that Ecuador perceived Perenco’s intention at this

time to be to enter into transitory agreements with the State and that “Burlington was the problem.”: 1“ Witness.

execution.** This too was rejected by Perenco on the grounds that the new agreement’s terms

were “substantially similar” to those of the May 2008 Transitory Agreement and were

unacceptable.”

In late July 2008, Minister Chiriboga informed Perenco that he had instructed Petroecuador to

terminate the negotiation process."

At this point the record shows that Burlington decided that it would prefer to divest itself of its
assets in Ecuador rather than migrate to a service contract.” This created yet another problem
for Perenco. As the consortium operator, Perenco was negotiating on its own behalf but it was
also, from the government’s perspective, negotiating on behalf of Burlington. Under the terms
of its contractual relationship with Burlington, it appears that Perenco could not bind
Burlington to a renegotiated contract which might be acceptable to Perenco but not to
Burlington. Burlington declined to be bound by Perenco’s efforts to arrive at a negotiated

solution.

The Tribunal can understand why Burlington arrived at this conclusion. In his letter to Perenco

dated 18 August 2008, Minister Chiriboga commented:

This occurred in the midst of attempts by Perenco to reach a compromise with representatives of the Ministry of
Mines and Petroleum and Petroecuador regarding the disputed Law 42 payments that had or would become due
pending the arbitration or any agreed transitory agreement. For example, Perenco by letter dated 19 June 2008
sought a meeting with Petroecuador to discuss the “possibility of a mutually agreeable solution regarding disputed
Law 42 payments that become due” and proposed the option of transferring the disputed payments into an escrow
account maintained by an independent escrow agent in a neutral location: Exhibit CE-072, Letter from Perenco
and Burlington to the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum and Petroecuador proposing an escrow account for
transfer of disputed Law 42 payments, 19 June 2008 (in Spanish and English).

The draft transitory agreement included a “commitment clause” for companies to migrate to a service-model
contract within one year, replaced the existing provision which dealt with the modification of the tax regime with
a provision subrogating the rights of the contractor to the domestic taxation regime with no exception or
contractual review mechanism, and included a clause “modifying the Arbitration Center” to the Permanent Court
of Arbitration, requiring parties to go through a series of consultation and mediations before submitting the
dispute to arbitration, and excluding disputes which arise from or are connected to taxation matters: Exhibits E-85,

[T]he Ecuadorian State maintains its position of converting all participation
contracts to services contracts, which, among other matters, include changing
from ICSID arbitration to regional arbitration...fiscal sovereignty, so that tax
issues will not be subject to arbitration but to the country’s courts; fulfillment of
the contractual obligations of the company and of Law 42; and the withdrawal of
your claims before the ICSID.*”

This contemplated a very different contractual arrangement from that which had prevailed up
to President Correa’s announcement in April 2008. Moreover, even though Burlington’s
refusal to negotiate changes to its contractual rights fell outside of Perenco’s control, this was

essentially held against Perenco.°*°

Notwithstanding the obstacles and the State’s shift away from the approach recorded in the
first Partial Agreement, Perenco continued to seek a negotiated solution.?>! In October 2008,
negotiations resumed and on 3 October and 17 October the two parties reached another Partial
Agreement for Blocks 7 and 21, respectively. At this point, the partial agreement contained the
following points: (i) the principle of migrating to a service contract; (ii) a higher statutory
reference price (US $42.50/barrel for Block 7 and US $48/barrel for Block 21); (iii) the
application of the LET rate of taxation (70%) in lieu of Law 42 at 99%; and (iv) a guaranteed
investment of US $110 million, supported by a commitment from a parent company

2
guarantee.”

This Partial Agreement also foundered. Perenco sent comments on the draft agreement on 31
October (for Block 7) and 7 November (for Block 21), and this was followed up with a letter to

Petroecuador’s negotiating team confirming its agreement with the terms but stating it could

The evidence of Minister Chiriboga at paragraph 25 of his 1‘ Witness Statement is that was clear by the fourth
quarter of 2008 that “Burlington's refusal to accept a new agreement with the State [made] it impossible to reach a
definitive agreement with respect to blocks 7 and 21 with Perenco.”

not sign the draft agreements which had since been approved by Ecuadorian government

agencies without its comments having been taken into account.”*

The bigger problem was that after Perenco informed Burlington that following extensive
negotiations it had reached a draft transitory agreement that was “acceptable to both Perenco
on the one hand, and the Government of Ecuador and Petroecuador on the other” Burlington
would not go along with the proposed agreement.” Burlington informed Perenco that it would
not sign the draft transitory agreement.”*° The agreement could not become effective without

Burlington’s participation.

Perenco was then informed by the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum that since it had been
impossible to reach an agreement due to Burlington’s “‘intransigent position,” Perenco should
appoint a team to negotiate the reversion of Block 7 (then scheduled to expire in August 2010)

and that it should “immediately assign its negotiating team to early termination of the Block 21

contract, by mutual agreement” even though that block was not set to expire until 2021.°°

Perenco asked the Minister to reconsider the position in view of the fact that the parties were

so close to an amicable solution.°*’ However, Minister Derlis Palacios stated publicly on 21

January 2009 that negotiations with Perenco and Burlington were “practically impossible”.°°*

As noted below some further negotiations occurred in 2009, but they too foundered. The

Respondent argued that their failure was attributable to Perenco.”” The Tribunal does not see it

that way. In its view, the negotiations failed due to the State’s escalating demands and its view

that Perenco was responsible for ensuring that Burlington agreed to the terms of the tentative

deals.

Insofar as the separate claim of breach of Article 4’s impediment provision is concerned, the
Tribunal considers that although Perenco’s management, preservation, and use of the Blocks
was unimpeded by the application of Decree 662, its enjoyment of the investment was

impeded. This constitutes a separate breach of Article 4.

In sum, the Tribunal finds that: (i) Law 42’s enactment did not breach Article 4; (ii) moving
beyond 50% to 99% with the application of Decree 662 to Perenco as well as the ensuing
measures just discussed breached Article 4. The Tribunal now turns to the events leading up to

the declaration of caducidad.

f The declaration of Caducidad

The Tribunal has already discussed the history of the Decision on Provisional Measures in the
Facts and in the course of its decision on Perenco’s invocation of the defence of exceptio non
adimpleti contractus. It is unnecessary to repeat the chronology. Suffice to say that on 13 July
2009 the Consortium gave notice of its intention to suspend operations. This set in train the
events that led to the declaration of caducidad on 20 July 2010 which brought the Contracts to

an end.

The Tribunal notes that in contrast to the contractual claims, the carve-out of caducity in Block
7 from the Tribunal’s contractual jurisdiction can have no effect on its jurisdiction to consider

whether the declarations made in respect of both Contracts amount to a breach of Treaty.

Since the declaration of caducidad is bound up with the Parties’ submissions on whether
Perenco suffered an expropriation, the Tribunal will defer its discussion of caducidad as a
potential breach of fair and equitable treatment until after it it has considered the expropriation

claim, to which it now turns.

Expropriation under Article 6 of the Treaty

Article 6 of the Treaty precludes a Contracting Party from taking any expropriation or

nationalisation measures “or any other measures which would cause nationals and companies

198

of the other Party to be dispossessed, directly or indirectly, of their investments” unless it has

satisfied certain conditions:

1. The Contracting Parties shall not take any expropriation or
nationalization measures or any other measures which would cause nationals and
companies of the other Party to be dispossessed, directly or indirectly, of their
investments (measures hereinafter referred to as ‘expropriation measures’) except
for reasons of public necessity and on condition that such measures are not
discriminatory or contrary to a specific undertaking made in accordance with the
laws of the Contracting Party between those nationals or companies and the host
State. The legality of the expropriation shall be verifiable through regular judicial
procedure.

Any expropriation measures taken shall give rise to the payment of fair
and adequate compensation equivalent to the real value of the investments in
question and assessed on the basis of a normal economic situation prior to any
threat of dispossession.

 

Such compensation, its amount and methods of payment shall be
determined not later than the date of expropriation. The compensation shall be
effectively realizable, paid without delay and freely transferable. It shall yield, up
to Ln date of payment, interest calculated on the basis of the market interest
rate.”

(DL The Claimant’s Position

632. Perenco submitted that Ecuador’s actions in enacting and implementing Law 42 amounted to
an expropriation of its investment in Ecuador because (i) it deprived Perenco of its contractual
right to an agreed participation percentage of the crude oil produced in the Blocks, (ii) it
deprived Perenco of the benefits accruing from that contractual right; namely, the opportunity
to earn further profits from the use of monies that could have been re-invested rather than paid
as Law 42 dues; and (iii) as a result of the “cumulative effect” of the coactiva process,
Ecuador’s take-over of the Blocks, and declaration of caducidad, Perenco was divested of its

rights and assets in Ecuador (in Perenco’s submission, a “complete taking”).

633. Perenco’s Reply clarified that Law 42 at 50% and at 99% were to be considered differently.

Whereas the former was treated as part of a series of measures which culminated in a complete

°00 Exhibit CE-07, Treaty, PER 00521.

635.

636.

964

966

taking, at 99%, Law 42 was said to be “economically devastating to Perenco”, constituting an
961

expropriation “in and of itself.”
Perenco contended further that Ecuador had failed to discharge its burden of demonstrating
that such measures were taken “for reasons of public necessity”, were applied non-
discriminatorily and were accompanied by “fair and adequate compensation ‘equivalent to the
real value of the investments’ ...determined ‘not later than the date of the expropriation.”°

In Perenco’s submission, a measure qualified as an expropriation measure within the meaning
of Article 6 if its effect was to deprive the investor of the fundamental rights of ownership and
control of its investment.°® Put another way, a measure was expropriatory if it “‘substantial[ly]
depriv[ed] or effectively render[ed] useless an investor’s property rights.”°™ In this regard,
Perenco asserted that both Alpha Projecktholding v. Ukraine and Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania
have recognised that in the case of indirect expropriation it is enough to demonstrate that the
effect of the State’s actions is to interfere with the rights of the investor to such an extent that
these rights “are rendered useless”, “even though the State does not purport to have
expropriated them and the legal title to the property formally remains with the original
owner.”

Perenco submitted that the ‘rights’ in question could extend to contractual rights, asserting that
“[d]eprivation of acquired contract rights is likewise expropriatory.” °° It cited Siemens v.
Argentina and Eureko v. Poland in support, contending that “when a State exercises its public

authority unilaterally to amend the key terms of a contract with an investor, with the effect of

1987) (CA-285) for the proposition that “the litmus test for determining whether a state action or series of actions
rise to the level of expropriation is not the action itself, but rather ‘the effects of the measures on the owner’ and
‘the reality of their impact.’” (Paragraph 22).

essentially depriving the investor of the contract’s benefits, such a repudiation of acquired

contract rights constitutes a measure tantamount to expropriation.”°”

To this end, it argued that Ecuador expropriated its investment in the Contracts by depriving it
of a “fundamental contract right’, defined as its “agreed participation percentage.” 998
Moreover, by depriving Perenco of that key term, Ecuador had “correspondingly deprived
Perenco of the benefit of the investment, namely the opportunity to earn profits.”° It relied for
this purpose on economic analyses prepared and annexed to the first witness statement of Mr.
d’ Argentré, and the evidence of its expert, Professor Kalt.°”° Both submitted that in 2008, for
example, the Consortium suffered a US $63 million loss, rather than benefitting from the US
$229 million profit it projected it would have earned (of which Perenco would have enjoyed
US $127,975 million) but for Law 42.°”' Perenco asserted that from 2006 to 2008, the State
“increased its take from 58% to 110%”, that is, the share of net profits accruing to the State
with Law 42 in effect increased from US $140,448,000 in 2006 (compared to Perenco’s US

$38,471,000), to US $375,800,000 in 2008 (compared to Perenco’s US $34,939,000).°”?

Mr. d’Argentré’s evidence was that: “Following this analysis, the cumulative effect of Law 42
from its enactment until the present has been to take from the Consortium approximately $476
million in after-tax profits that it would have been entitled to under the Participation Contracts,

and at the same time confer on the Government $588 million that it was not entitled to under

973

the Participation Contracts. In Professor Kalt’s view, the financial consequences of Law 42

expropriatory in substance and in effect.”; Siemens A.G. v The Argentine Republic, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8,
Award (6 February 2007) (CA-28), paragraph 267: “There is a long judicial practice that recognizes that

when the rate was increased from 50% to 99% was that “Perenco was effectively only able to
recover expenses and was not even afforded recovery of past or going-forward capital related
costs (including a return to capital) [...] Perenco was placed in the position of a service
provider and afforded revenues that were not even up to the level that a 100% participation
service contract between an ex ante willing seller of oil field services and a willing buyer of

such services would yield”?

The effect of the coactivas, subsequent to which Ecuador bought at auction the entire
production of Blocks 7 and 21 for half and subsequently two-thirds of its market price,
“credit[ing] these sales against Perenco’s alleged Law 42 ‘debt’ — at the reduced auction sale
price”, all the while continuing to issue new Law 42 assessments against Perenco, “created the
perverse situation that not only was Perenco receiving no revenue at all from its production —
not even money to cover operating costs — its Law 42 ‘debt’ actually continued to mount, while
Ecuador made significant profits by reselling Perenco’s oil at much higher market prices.”°”>

In addition, Perenco relied on its analysis of “foregone profits”, i.e. profits that it would have
received and would have been entitled to use, but for Law 42, to further invest and drill new

wells in Blocks 7 and 21, to claim an additional US $214 million.”

In the third prong of Perenco’s claim, it submitted that the Tribunal must consider the
cumulative effect of the measures taken by Ecuador in connection with Law 42, relying on
RosInvest Co UK Ltd v. Russian Federation, a case in which a taxation investigation initiated
by Russia and certain measures taken in relation thereto affected the claimant’s ability to pay

the additional taxes and penalties demanded by the State, eventually leading the State to seize

Reply, paragraph 360. Perenco submitted that this placed it an impossible situation with respect to the remainder
of the contractual term of the Block 7 Contract, and the foreseeable future of the contractual term of the Block 21
Contract. It relied on the evidence of Professor Kalt, stating it demonstrated that Perenco would have had a Law
42 burden of US $146 million when the Block 7 Contract expired, and with respect to the Block 21 Contract, it
would have meant that Perenco faced a Law 42 burden of US $156 million at the beginning of 2009, and an
additional US $163 million by the end of 2010 despite Petroecuador having seized and sold off the Block’s crude
for two years by that point. (Reply, paragraphs 361-362; Expert Report of Joseph P. Kalt, Figure 20.)

and sell the claimant’s assets in Russia.°”’ The RosInvest tribunal accepted the argument that
“‘the totality of Respondent’ [sic] measures were structured in such a way’ as to result in a
‘complete taking of all of the assets of [the investor] [amounting] to a nationalization or
expropriation’” of its investment.””* Perenco argued similarly that “[t]he “cumulative effect’ of
Ecuador’s measures, its enactment and enforcement of Law 42 through the seizure and sale of
Perenco’s crude, its physical take-over of the Blocks, and its actions to unilaterally terminate
the Participation Contract, have equally resulted in a ‘complete taking’ of Perenco’s assets”,
amounting to an “‘expropriation measure’ under Article 6?

Perenco’s rebuttal to any claim by Ecuador to the effect that the measures were legitimate
regulatory measures was that Law 42 was pursued for an illegitimate public purpose, namely,
to coerce oil companies such as Perenco to abandon their Participation Contracts.* It relied on
the decisions in ADC v. Hungary (a “state’s right to regulate within its domestic affairs is not
unbounded”)”*! and AES v. Hungary (“[i]t cannot be considered a reasonable measure for a
state to use its governmental powers to force a private party to change or give up its contractual
rights”).2
In this regard, Perenco challenged Ecuador’s reliance on the ‘police powers’ doctrine, stating it
was subject to limitations that “Ecuador fail[ed] to acknowledge”, including the limitation that
“[t]he measure in question must also be proportionate to the identified public purpose”.°** It
submitted that the ‘police powers’ doctrine was intended to “recognize a State’s sovereign

power to implement regulations for bona fide public purposes”, and not as in this case, in

Perenco’s view, to “provide a cover for State action... that is arbitrary, discriminatory,
99984

disproportionate, or unreasonable.
Ecuador similarly could not excuse its conduct by “contending that its actions were permitted
or even compelled by Ecuadorian law.”°* This related to Ecuador’s position in its Counter-
Memorial that its actions to enforce Law 42 when Perenco halted payments, i.e., through the
coactivas, intervention in the Blocks and ultimate declaration of caducidad were consequent to
Perenco’s failure to comply with Ecuadorian law. 986 Th response, Perenco submitted that
Ecuador “omit[ed] the fact that throughout this period it was acting in open defiance of the
Tribunal’s decision on provisional measures. As a matter of international law, it was Ecuador,
not Perenco that was acting illegally.”°*’

Finally, Perenco contended that Ecuador could not claim that its actions were justified on
grounds of necessity. ** It acted discriminatorily and contrary to its specific undertakings in
clause 8.1 of the Contracts. °° Moreover, it “ha[d] not offered, much less paid, any
compensation and ha[d] wielded its sovereign power to violate Perenco’s rights through

measures that far exceed[ed] any of its contractual privileges.”””°

(2) The Respondent’s Position

For its part, Ecuador maintained two objections to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction in relation to the
expropriation claims. First, it argued that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction because the coactiva
notices were issued by the Juzgado de Coactivas de Petroecuador, and the Tribunal had

already ruled that it did not have jurisdiction over Petroecuador.””! Second, Ecuador reiterated

Perenco’s case which extended to claiming that the caducidad decrees “completed” the
expropriation of Perenco’s rights and property (or, alternatively, objected to the admissibility

of the same).°”

Turning to the merits, Ecuador submitted in the first instance that Perenco had wrongly
conflated the effect of Law 42 and the actions subsequent to it taken in response to Perenco’s
failure to comply with Ecuadorian law.°* It asserted that “international law does not require a
State to compensate any loss resulting from the taking of valid and legitimate police powers
measures to enforce its law in response to a foreign investor’s (such as Perenco) [sic] illegal
behavior.”°™* The coactivas, Ecuador’s intervention in the Blocks and declaring the caducidad
of the Contracts were actions “validly and legitimately taken by Ecuador in response to
Perenco’s own illegal behavior.” 995 Caducidad, in particular, was declared, not because
Perenco had failed to make Law 42 payments, but rather because “Perenco abandoned Blocks
7 and 21 in the face of repeated requests by Ecuador over a period of 12 months to resume
operations.” 996 This, Ecuador submitted, namely, Perenco’s withholding of Law 42 dues
starting in 2008 and its decision to leave the Blocks in July 2009, was part of a ‘manufactured

self-expropriation exit strategy’ 7

since it had concluded by this time that “potentially greater
value could be had for the Consortium by withholding Law 42 and Decree 662 dues over the

short-term”, and pursuing a claim for lost profits in an arbitration than could be “gained

In Ecuador’s view, Perenco had intentionally structured its expropriation claim as one of
“cumulative effect” because it recognised that the enactment and application of Law 42 at 50%
in and of itself was insufficient to make out a breach of Article 6.°” It requested that the
Tribunal confine its analysis of Perenco’s case with regard to Article 6 to the enactment and

application of Law 42 to Perenco.'°”

Ecuador submitted in the alternative that Perenco’s “cumulative case” on expropriation
“fail[ed] because Law 42, the coactiva process, Ecuador’s temporary intervention following
Perenco’s illegal abandonment of the Blocks and caducidad [were] all legitimate and bona fide

regulatory and thus non-compensable measures and, in any event, Law 42 (whether at the 50%

or 99% rate) [did] not amount to an expropriation of Perenco’s investment.” ©!

Ecuador contended that Perenco had made a fundamental error in its submissions in this
regard; it had failed to address that the enactment of Law 42, Decree 662, the coactiva process,
Ecuador’s intervention in the Blocks, and caducidad were “all bona fide and legitimate
exercises of Ecuador’s police powers and, under international law, legitimate and bona fide

State measures within the exercise of the State’s police powers [could not] constitute a

»» 1002

compensable expropriation. It asserted that it was well-accepted in international

investment law jurisprudence that a State was not liable to compensate an investor for bona
fide regulation promulgated within its police powers. 103 The power to tax, it submitted,

“undoubtedly” fell within the category of a State’s police powers, and “[a]bsent extraordinary

circumstances — such as discrimination, arbitrariness, denial of due process or abuse of powers
— the burden imposed on a foreign investment by the State’s levies [did] not entitle the alien to
claim compensation for the appropriation of its property which is the natural result of the
levies’ application.” !°"

Ecuador asserted moreover that the power to tax received “special treatment in the
international law of expropriation given that they result from the exercise of one of the
attributes of sovereignty (the right to tax aliens and their property located in its territory).”!°
It further submitted that customary international law “not only recognizes the sovereign power
to tax as part of the State’s police powers”, it did “not impose limits to this power” and “[s]uch
limits cannot be found in investment treaties either.”!° To tax is a “presumptively non-

compensable” regulatory act in the exercise of a State’s sovereign power. !07

Ecuador submitted that to accept Perenco’s case, which it characterised as the contention that a
tax which reduces the economic benefits of a contractual arrangement for an investor is
expropriatory, would be to “[negate] a State’s sovereign power to tax.”!8 It cited Paushok v.
Mongolia, which considered the legality of a 68% windfall profits tax and the claimant’s
argument that it exceeded “international standards” limiting the right of the State to tax!
The tribunal concluded that the “[c]laimants ha[d] not established the existence of such
standards. At best, they ha[d] succeeded in demonstrating that such legislation went beyond the
taxation levels in application at the time in most countries of the world [...] The fact that a
particular country happens to have, at a particular time, the highest taxation level affecting a
certain industry does not automatically mean that there has been a breach of a BIT.”'°"° The
tribunal also concluded that an ‘excessive’ tax was not presumptively an arbitrary and

unreasonable one. '°!!

In this light, Ecuador submitted that Perenco was required to demonstrate first that Law 42 was
arbitrary and unreasonable, falling outside of the bounds of a State’s police powers, and
second, that it had a direct or indirect expropriatory effect on its investment in Ecuador, and
finally, that it had been applied discriminatorily, was abusive in purpose or involved a denial of
due process. '012 Tt asserted that Perenco’s submission fell far short; characterising it as limited
to arguing that “any measure taken by a State even in a legitimate exercise of its regulatory
powers and in response to the investor’s illegal behavior, could amount to an expropriation if it

[affected] the investor’s property rights [...] an absurd proposition, which [found] no support

we . »9 1013,
in international law.”!”!

Responding to Perenco’s reliance on ADC v. Hungary for the proposition that a State’s right to
regulate “is not unbounded”, Ecuador distinguished that case on its facts, stating that that
tribunal considered legislation that did not just “radically alter’ the regulatory regime
applicable to the contractual relationship between the parties, but “rendered the object of such
contract illegal under Hungarian law.”'°'4 Ecuador instead drew the Tribunal’s attention to two

other decisions, AES Summit Generation Limited and AES-Tisza Erémii Kft v. The Republic of

1015 1016

Hungary ~~ and again Paushok v. Mongolia”, which it submitted more analogously dealt

with the implementation of ‘luxury’ or ‘windfall’ profits and rightly found that it was
necessary for the claimant to demonstrate that the tax was arbitrary or unreasonable, bringing it
outside the bounds of the legitimate exercise of regulatory police powers. '°!7 It stated that

Perenco had not discharged this burden and would fail to do so because Law 42 was enacted in

the bona fide exercise of Ecuador’s police powers as evidenced by the following: 1018

that distinguishing ADC v Hungary on the facts does not “detract from its point of principle”, namely that a State
is bound to honour the investment-protection obligations it undertakes in an investment treaty.

(i) Ecuador had a constitutional mandate to seek a fair allocation of revenues derived from
its hydrocarbons resources ‘“‘and a duty to legislate to deal with the unexpected and

excessive increase in oil prices.”!°!°

(ii) The legislative intent of Law 42 was to remedy a disequilibrium “caused by a massive

and unforeseen increase in oil prices.”!07°

(iii) Law 42 was not discriminatory, it was a general measure adopted by Ecuador to
“restore the economics of its participation contracts with all private companies in like
circumstances in light of the unexpected increase in oil prices” and “was not

specifically aimed at Perenco or at foreign investors exclusively.” 1°?!

(iv) Law 42 was duly enacted, in accordance with Ecuadorian law.

(v) The Constitutional Court in Ecuador affirmed Law 42’s constitutionality. In Ecuador’s
submission, it “affirmed the constitutionality of all of the substantive provisions of Law
42 and the fact that it did not modify the Participation Contracts.”

In this regard, Ecuador further reiterated that the purpose of Law 42 and Decree 662 should be
considered separately from that of the coactiva process and caducidad, which Ecuador
submitted did “not have the same public purpose”, namely, the enforcement of Ecuadorian

2:
law, 103

Should the Tribunal find that Law 42 was an “illegitimate and compensable regulatory
measure”, Ecuador submitted in the alternative that Perenco had failed to prove that “Law 42
permanently deprived [it] of its contractual rights or rendered worthless [its] investment in
Ecuador.”!°™* Perenco had “not demonstrated — nor could it — that Law 42 unilaterally amended

the Participation Contracts, in particular the participation percentage agreed in Clause 8.1 of

the Participation Contracts (i.e., the allocation of volumes of crude to the contractor).” 1°75 It

reiterated its submissions in its breach of contract claim, emphasising its contention that there

was no stabilisation clause or its equivalent in the Ecuadorian Constitution restraining the State

Ecuador cites in support of this Article 247 of the 1998 Ecuadorian Constitution. Article 247 provides that non-
renewable natural resources are considered the “inalienable and imprescriptible property of the State”, to be
“exploited in light of national interests.” (Exhibit EL-128)

from exercising its “sovereign right to enact new laws and/or regulations that could affect the
legal framework of the Participation Contracts”, 1026 and submitting that “[i]f the Arbitral
Tribunal finds that there was no breach under the Participation Contracts, Perenco’s

expropriation claim under the Treaty should be rejected.” 1027

However, should the Tribunal find that Law 42 did breach the Participation Contracts, Ecuador
submitted that that could not automatically amount to an expropriation of Perenco’s contractual
rights. Perenco had to additionally demonstrate, and Ecuador contended it accepts this burden
in its written pleadings, that the breach had the effect of essentially depriving the investor of
the benefits of the Contracts. '°* To succeed on a claim of “indirect expropriation”, the investor
must prove that the measure, or a series of measures, has effectively and permanently deprived
it of “the economic use, enjoyment or benefits of its investment.” !° Ecuador asserted that
Perenco failed to put forward any credible economic analysis to prove that Law 42 had such an
effect. '°° In this regard, Ecuador pointed to evidence that it submitted countered any
suggestion that Law 42 caused a near-total loss of value or control of Perenco’s rights under

the Contracts:

(i) The first was Perenco’s offer to place monies into escrow in June 2008 (six months
after the enactment of Decree 662 and the application of Law 42 at the 99% rate). It was
Perenco’s own position at the time that its “operations in Ecuador generated enough
cash to deposit the amounts due under Law 42 into an escrow account and still continue

to operate the Blocks.” 1031

as an admission that there was “no economic difference between a scenario in which Ecuador enforced coactivas
against Perenco and a scenario in which Ecuador complied with the Provisional Measures Decision” (Reply,
paragraph 367; see also, Provisional Measures Decision, paragraph 80). Ecuador responded that Perenco’s counsel

(ii) The second was Perenco’s failure to “put forward any clear and compelling evidence of
what effects Law 42 had, in practice, on its investment.” !°*? Ecuador disputed the
probative value of Mr. d’Argentré’s evidence and the economic analyses appended in
table-form in Exhibits CE-116 and CE-117 to his witness statement because “(i) they do
not even indicate the source for the figures mentioned therein and (ii) they are

unsupported by any independent economic analysis.”!°¥

(iii) | The third was the economic analysis produced by Perenco at Exhibit CE-116, which
purportedly demonstrated the effect of Law 42 at 99% in 2008 and suggested that
Perenco suffered a loss for the first time in 2008 when it should have earned a profit of
US $127,975,000. This conceded that “when Law 42 was applied at a 50% rate, Law 42

did not devastate Perenco’s investment.”!°**

Ecuador submitted that while it did not bear the burden of proof in this respect, it could
demonstrate that Law 42, whether at 50% or 99%, did not in fact amount to an expropriation of
Perenco’s investment.!° It drew the Tribunal’s attention to the following: “(i) the Blocks 7
and 21 Consortium’s tax records after the passage of Law 42; (ii) the Fair Links Expert Report;
(iii) the Consortium’s own economic valuation as of the end of 2006 for additional investment
in Block 7; and (iv) ConocoPhillip’s (Perenco’s partner’s — i.e., Burlington’s — mother

company) annual reports following the adoption of Law 42,7106

The Consortium’s tax records showed that the Consortium reported earning gross profits of US

$100 to 200 million in the years 2006 and 2007 (i.e., while Law 42 in effect), and that these

in the Provisional Measures hearing made it “perfectly clear that his client was prepared to put into escrow the
entirety of the disputed amounts assessed under Law 42 and Decree 662”, this including “further escrow of the
past accrued disputed payments.” In this way, Perenco admitted that it was financially able to continue to operate
the Blocks under either escrow scenario. (Rejoinder, paragraphs 548 and 554; Transcript, Hearing on Provisional
Measures, pp 83-84.)

figures were greater than the profits the Consortium reported having earned in 2005, before

Law 42 was enacted. '°°”

Fair Links concluded that while the “State’s revenues derived from the 50% levy [increased] in
greater proportions than the contractor’s revenues”, the contractor’s take “still benefit{ed] from
a higher market price environment through an increased return on investments”, in this way it
always preserved the initial expectations parties had in the negotiation of the Contracts. 1038 Pair
Links presented a ‘free cash flows analysis’ over a period of ten years (i.e., the cash that a
company is able to generate after spending the resources required to maintain its capital
expenditure) with Law 42 and Decree 662 in effect, determining that “it did not alter the global
trend of positive cash flows” and “the Consortium’s operations [would have] generated a

compounded surplus of more than $8/bbI.”!1°°

Perenco challenged the credibility of this analysis, arguing it did “not include the impact of the
coactivas” and reflected “an entirely hypothetical situation.”'™” It relied on the evidence of
Professor Kalt, which it stated accounted for the effect of the coactivas, and demonstrated at
Figure 19 that it caused the free cash flow result to move from positive to negative. oar

Ecuador submitted in response that the evidence of both of its experts, Brattle and Fair Links,
demonstrated that the effect of the coactivas on the Consortium was only that it created a
greater financial incentive for the Consortium to withhold payments and suspend operations
rather than to pay the dues and continue to operate the Blocks.'° Law 42 and Decree 662
applied only to revenues above the statutory reference price and only took effect after Perenco

had an opportunity to benefit from a significant windfall from increasing oil prices. 1043

Ecuador emphasised the significance of the amendment of the Block 7 development plan
relating to the Oso field in November 2007 (i.e., more than sixteen months after the enactment
of Law 42). (This is discussed above in relation to the claim under Article 4 of the Treaty.)

Perenco’s response was that Professor Kalt’s evidence suggested that “not having the benefit

of the upside change[d] the midpoint”, !°4 and that the Oso field was “but one field of many,

and not the most expensive at that.” 1°

Ecuador also noted that the 2006 to 2008 Annual Reports of ConocoPhillips (Perenco’s
consortium partner’s parent company) recorded no write-down on the book value of its
Ecuadorian assets during those years, something it was required to report under US GAAP

regulations. Ecuador submitted this suggested that there was no such impairment resulting

from the enactment and implementation of Law 42. 1046

Finally, Ecuador argued that there can be no permanent deprivation of Perenco’s investment
because Law 42 only applied in the event the market price of Ecuadorian crude exceeded the

Law 42 reference price. There were periods of time where Law 42 had no effect whatsoever on

the Consortium’s profits. tour

Ecuador submitted that this evidence was similarly probative when considering whether Law
42 at 99% was expropriatory. '48 Tt claimed that Perenco for its part again offered no objective

evidence to demonstrate that Law 42 at 99% crippled its operations in Ecuador:

[I]t is worth noting that [Perenco] deliberately omitted any economic assessment
by an independent economic expert of the impact of Law 42 on the Blocks 7 and
21 Consortium’s overall profitability. Accordingly, because Perenco has failed to
sustain its burden of proof, this Arbitral Tribunal need not go any further. It
should dismiss Perenco’s claims on this basis alone.'“?

Ecuador contended that Perenco could not succeed in its claim that Law 42 at 99% amounted
to a permanent deprivation of its benefits under the Contracts'°™ because Law 42 applied only
above a certain reference price, preserving the returns the Contractor could expect from the
base price contemplated in the negotiations up to the Law 42 reference price. 105! The “test for
indirect expropriation as a matter of international law [was] high”, and the “mere loss of value,
which [was] not the result of an interference with the control or use of the investment, [was]

not an indirect expropriation. Were it otherwise, every breach of contract which [led] to a loss

- . os 591052
of value would constitute an expropriation.

Ecuador argued that it could prove that “there was neither a total loss of value of Perenco’s
investment nor a loss of control over it.”!°™ It relied on the findings of Fair Links and Brattle

that “[t]he operations of Perenco were still generating positive cash flows after the enactment

of Law 42 and Decree 662”, 054 Perenco’s offer to place Law 42 monies into escrow, 105

similarly the amendment to the Block 7 development plan relating to the Oso field, and
ConocoPhillips’ annual reports for the period 2006 to 2008.'°°° In this connection, Ecuador
highlighted that the only impairment recorded by ConocoPhillips was in its 10-K form for

2009, a consequence of Perenco’s allegedly unlawful suspension of operations in July

the windfall accumulated pre-April 2006 meant that even when combined with the application of Decree 662 at
99% the Contractor would have expected the Block 7 Contract to generate an IRR of 64% over the life of the
Contract. With the full use of hindsight, in July 2012, the built-up windfall and prices actually realized meant that,
against the initial modelling, the Contractor even paying Decree 662 dues at 99% would still have generated an
IRR of around 63.9%. The position for Block 21, updating the 2000 development plan for actual oil prices and
holding the other ex ante assumptions unchanged, was similar. The Contractor looking out in April 2006 when
Law 42 came into force, would still have expected an IRR of close to 50%. By October 2007, when Decree 662
came into effect, the pre-April 2006 windfall when combined with increasing prices would still have led a
contractor to expect an IRR of 43% on its investment in Block 21 even applying Decree 662 at 99%. By July
2012, looking back with hindsight, and applying the actual prices realized to the ex ante model, a contractor
would have been expected to generate an IRR of 43% on Block 21 even if Decree 662 at 99% applied to it.”)

2009.'°5? While Perenco submitted that it had no alternative but to suspend operations and
leave the Blocks, Ecuador relied on the evidence of Brattle to assert that it was because
Perenco was earning “extraordinary returns off the back of the sustained period of
extraordinary and unexpected oil prices” that it “ha[d] an incentive to breach the participation
contracts if it could make more money in the short term withholding Law 42 and Decree 662
dues than it could expect to make over the long-term through continued production over the
remaining life of the Blocks.”!°°8

Finally, Ecuador submitted that should the Tribunal find that the measures complained of by
Perenco constituted an expropriation of its investment within the meaning of Article 6 of the
Treaty, such expropriation was lawful in the circumstances. 1059 aw 42 served a public purpose
and was necessary. 1069 Perenco had not demonstrated that Ecuador’s measures were
discriminatory. ‘061 There had been moreover no violation of “specific undertakings” since
Ecuador maintained that the Contracts were not breached or modified.' It submitted it was
not required to pay compensation since this condition in Article 6 was triggered only by an
expropriatory action having already taken place and a finding of the same (whether in the form

of acceptance by the State or a declaration by an arbitral tribunal). 1063

(3) The Tribunal’s Decision
a. The remaining jurisdictional objections

The Respondent’s jurisdictional objections can be dealt with summarily. It will be recalled that
Ecuador argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because the coactiva notices were issued by

the Juzgado de Coactivas de Petroecuador and the Tribunal has already ruled that it does not

have jurisdiction over Petroecuador. !°“ In the Tribunal’s view, the determination that the
Republic, not Petroecuador, was the proper party to the claim does not in any way restrict the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction to consider measures taken by Petroecuador in the context of this treaty
claim. The coactivas were measures taken to enforce Law 42 and are attributable to the State
for the purposes of international responsibility. Distinctions between different agencies of the
Ecuadorian State which may be relevant to a contract claim governed by Ecuadorian law may
not be relevant when it comes to an international law claim based on a treaty. The Tribunal
considers that this is such a case and that it therefore has jurisdiction to consider the coactivas’

consistency with the Treaty. The objection is dismissed.

As for Ecuador’s objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione materiae to consider that part
of Perenco’s case which extends to claiming that the caducidad decrees “completed” the
expropriation of Perenco’s rights and property (or, alternatively, the objection to the
admissibility of the same), the Tribunal considers that the initiation of the caducidad
proceedings and the ultimate declarations made by the Ministry are likewise attributable to the
State. The fact that the Block 7 Contract excluded the arbitrability of caducidad under that
Contract cannot preclude the Tribunal from considering the declaration’s consistency with

Ecuador’s obligations under the Treaty. This objection is also dismissed.

b. Law 42 at 50%

It appears that although the Claimant saw Law 42 at 50% as the first of a series of measures
that culminated in the expropriation of the investment, it did not press the point that at 50%
Law 42 was itself an expropriation. !°° The Tribunal agrees that at 50%, Law 42 did not

constitute a deprivation within the meaning of Article 6.

While like any other windfall tax, Law 42 reduced Perenco’s profitability, it did not deprive
the Claimant of its rights of management and control over the investment in Ecuador, nor did it

reach the requisite level of a substantial diminution in the value of that investment. The

346.

Reply, paragraph 356: “At 50%, Law 42 constituted a breach of the Participation Contracts and of the fair and
equitable treatment and non-impairment standards under the Treaty...At 99%, it was also economically
devastating to Perenco, and, contrary to Ecuador’s contention, constituted an expropriation in and of itself.”

1066

1067

1068

1069

Tribunal is mindful in this regard of the point made in a number of awards that a distinction is
to be drawn between a partial deprivation of value, which is not an expropriation, and a
“complete or near complete deprivation of value”, which can constitute an expropriation. '°%
Thus, for example, in Tecmed v. Mexico, the tribunal adverted to measures that “radically
deprived [the investor] of the economical use and enjoyment of its investments, as if the rights
related thereto... had ceased to exist” or, to put it another way, “the assets involved have lost
their value or economic use for their holder...”.!°° In CME v. Czech Republic, the tribunal
noted that an indirect expropriation can arise where there are measures that do not involve an
overt taking but that effectively neutralize the benefit of the property of the foreign
owner...”,'°°8

These formulations as to the amount of deprivation of value required to be shown before an
indirect expropriation will be found to exist tend in the direction of positing a very substantial
amount of deprivation. It need not be complete, but it must be very substantial. The point was
also made by the tribunal in EnCana v. Ecuador, where the tribunal found that a denial of VAT
refunds did not amount to an indirect expropriation because there was no evidence to suggest
that the measure “brought the companies to a standstill or rendered the value to be derived
from their activities so marginal or unprofitable as effectively to deprive them of their
character as investments.”
Using the standards employed in prior cases, it is plain that Law 42 at 50% did not
substantially deprive the Claimant of its investment, or effectively neutralise the benefit of the
investment or rights related thereto, nor did it render Perenco’s activities so marginal or
unprofitable as to effectively deprive them of their character as investments. Reference to, for
example, the Consortium’s tax returns for 2006 and its Oso Development Plan, discussed

previously, demonstrates this clearly.

c. Law 42 at 99%

With respect to Decree 662, it is to be noted that other than the claim to 99% of the
“extraordinary revenues” — which the Tribunal has already found to be a breach of Article 4 —
the State did not attempt to interfere with the normal attributes of management and control
over the investment. This part of the claim turns entirely on the question of whether the State’s
demand of payment of 99% of the “extraordinary revenues” amounted to such a substantial

diminution of Perenco’s investment such as to amount to an indirect expropriation.

Perenco argued that it plainly was; taking away 99% of the Contracts’ upside benefits
amounted to an indirect expropriation of its investment, even if it retained the ability to
generate income at and below the reference price, and otherwise continue to operate the
business. Ecuador looked at it from the other end of the telescope: since Decree 662 applied
only above the reference price for each Contract, there could be no finding of expropriation
because the revenues generated by sales up to the reference price were broadly what the parties
expected would be generated when the Contracts were entered into, and there was no

interference with the management and control of the business.

The Tribunal has already rejected Ecuador’s contention that Perenco’s contractual expectations
were satisfied by its obtaining the kind of revenues that were anticipated at the time of
contracting. This goes against the very notion of a participation contract and fails to accord
sufficient weight to Perenco’s assumption of risk. That said, there is merit in Ecuador’s

argument that Decree 662 did not interfere with the management and control of the business.

As for Decree 662’s impact on Perenco’s operations, Ecuador referred to the evidence of its

expert, Fair Links. Figure 14 in Fair Links’ first Report, which charted Block 21’s historical

1070

free cash flow "analysis, suggested that both the cumulative and annual free cash flow of the

Consortium should have remained steadily positive throughout the enactment and

1071

implementation of Law 42 and Decree 662. Figure 15 charted the historical cash flow

analysis for Block 7, and similarly posited a steady increase of the annual and cumulative free

The term ‘free cash flow’ is defined by Fair Links as “the cash that company is able to generate after spending the
resources required to maintain or expand its asset base (free cash flows are calculated as operating cash flow
minus capital expenditures)”: 1" Expert Report of Fair Links, p 39, paragraph 109.

cash flow that the Consortium should have had the benefit of during that time.'°” Fair Links
found that for both Blocks “the most significant annual cash contributions over the life of the
[Blocks] [were] either in 2007 (Block 21) or 2008 (Block 7), i.e., when Law 42 then Decree
662 were fully applicable.”!°% It is pertinent to note that the charts recorded a dip in the annual
free cash flow for Block 21 in 2008 as compared to 2007 (though it remained positive). !°* The
same cannot be said for the amount of annual free cash flow in Block 7; Figure 15 recorded a
rise in 2008 (though not as significant as the increase in positive free cash flow from 2006 to

2007 in Block 7).'°7°

The evidence of Perenco’s expert, Professor Kalt, was that the effect of Law 42 and Decree
662 should be considered from the perspective of “field viability”, i.e., the balance between the
revenues associated with operating the field as weighed against the capital costs already
incurred and the operational costs associated with continuing production. Perenco made
significant investments in Blocks 7 and 21 after it bought its interest in 2002, totaling
approximately US $364 million.'°”° The effect of the tax at 99% could not be weighed solely
against the current operating costs of the contractor but additionally had to account for sunk
capital costs. 1077 He responded to Fair Link’s evidence that the Consortium continued to
generate positive annual free cash under Decree 662 by challenging whether the margin was
“‘reasonable’ and/or ‘enough’...to make it rational for Perenco to continue to operate under”
the Participation Contracts from the contractor’s perspective, i.e., a perspective of field
viability, and submitting that the “economic character” of Contracts under Decree 662 had
taken on the “most extreme form of government participation — i.e., a service contract.”!°"* He
further contended that “Fair Links’ own ‘free cash’ analysis implicitly recognize[d] [that under
Decree 662] Perenco was effectively only able to recover expenses and was not even afforded

recovery of past or going-forward capital related costs (including a return on capital).”!0” In

this regard, Figure 17 of his report opined that under Decree 662 and before coactivas were
issued, Perenco would have reported a loss of net income from combined Block 7 and 21
operations of US $60.6 million, when it should have earned a projected profit of US $272

million (in the absence of Law 42). 1080

d. The Tribunal’s Decision

In the Tribunal’s view, although it contravened Article 4 of the Treaty for the reasons
previously explained, Decree 662 did not amount to an indirect expropriation. The Tribunal’s

reasons are threefold.

First, the Tribunal recalls Perenco’s expectations of relatively stable oil prices at the time of the
acquisition of its interests in the Contracts. As Mr. Spink testified, at US $20/barrel, Perenco
considered that it could achieve a return on its investment in a relatively short period of time.
Subject to what the Tribunal has to say about the impact of the coactivas on the Consortium’s
cashflow, which is dealt with separately below, if this was so prior to Decree 662, it remained
the case thereafter. Perenco continued to operate the Blocks and there was no impairment of

any rights of ownership or control.

At paragraph 672 above, the Tribunal referred to three cases in which other tribunals focused
on whether the effect of the alleged exproriatory measures came close to extinguishing the
investor’s business. To these can be added other cases. In Grand River Enterprises Six Nations,
Ltd., et al. v. United States of America, the tribunal found that a measure was not expropriatory
when it did not cause a “complete or very substantial deprivation of owners’ rights in the
totality of the investment” and the claimant remained in possession of an “ongoing
business”.!°*! It made these remarks with regard to Article 1110 of the NAFTA, highlighting

several decisions which bear some resemblance to the facts of the present case:

Ibid., and Figure 17 cf 2"! Expert Report of Fair Links, paragraphs 48-52: “...in 2008, assuming that Perenco had
paid Decree 662 dues for the whole year...Perenco’s operations would have generated a compound surplus (free
cash flow) of more than US $8/bbI”. It alleged that Professor Kalt “confuse[d] cash flows and accounting income
and fail[ed] to consider that the main source of lo: for Block 21 was the accounting treatment of amortizations
(close to $70 million).”

Grand River Enterprises Six Nations, Ltd., et al. v. United States of America, UNCITRAL, Award (12 January
2011), paragraph 148.

 

 

220

148. Other NAFTA tribunals have regularly construed Article 1110 to require a
complete or very substantial deprivation of owners' rights in the totality of the
investment, and have rejected expropriation claims where (as here) a claimant
remained in possession of an ongoing business. The Pope & Talbot Interim
Award rejected a claim that the disputed measures interfered with the claimants’
business sufficiently to constitute an expropriation, where the claimant continued
to make profitable exports of logs. As the $.D. Myers tribunal explained, ‘[a]n
expropriation usually amounts to a lasting removal of the ability of an owner to
make use of its economic rights.”

149. The tribunal in Feldman v. Mexico rejected a claim of expropriation where
the claimant remained in possession and able to conduct other lines of business.

‘[H]ere, as in Pope & Talbot, the regulatory action (enforcement of
longstanding provisions of Mexican law) has not deprived the Claimant
of control of the investment, CEMSA, interfered directly in the internal
operations of CEMSA or displaced the Claimant as the controlling
shareholder. The Claimant is free to pursue other continuing lines of
export trading, such as exporting alcoholic beverages, photographic
supplies, or other products ... although he is effectively precluded from
exporting cigarettes. Thus, this Tribunal believes there has been no
“taking” under this standard articulated in Pope & Talbot, in the present
case.”

150. Glamis Gold is to similar effect.

‘[A] panel’s analysis should begin with determining whether the
economic impact of the complained of measures is sufficient to
potentially constitute a taking at all: ‘[I]t must first be determined if the
Claimant was radically deprived of the economical use and enjoyment of
its investments, as if the rights related thereto ... had ceased to exist.’ The
Tribunal agrees with these statements and thus begins its analysis of
whether a violation of Article 1110 of the NAFTA has occurred by
determining whether the federal and California measures “substantially
impair[ed] the investor’s economic rights, i.e. ownership, use, enjoyment
or management of the business, by rendering them useless. Mere
restrictions on the property rights do not constitute takings.” '°**

683. The Grand River tribunal added that this was consistent with the approach of non-NAFTA
tribunals who have “held that an expropriation requires very great loss or impairment of all of a

claimant’s investment”:

151. ...ICISD tribunals have rejected expropriation claims involving significant
diminution of the value of a claimant’s property where the claimant nevertheless
retained ownership and control. Thus, the Tribunal in CMS v. Argentina rejected
a claim of expropriation where the claimant retained full ownership and control

1084

of the investment, even though its value was reduced by more than 90%. LG&E
v. Argentina is similar: ‘Interference with the investment’s ability to carry on its
business is not satisfied where the investment continues to operate, even if profits
are diminished.’ !*?

Having regard to the strict tests posited by the foregoing cases, the Tribunal considers that
although Decree 662 breached the fair and equitable treatment standard, it did not amount to an

indirect expropriation. It came close to, but did not cross the line.

Second, throughout the period following the application of Decree 662 and until the suspension
of operations in July 2009, Perenco continued to operate the fields and either paid Law 42 dues
at 99% (until it submitted the claim to ICSID arbitration following the President’s suspension
of the negotiations in April 2008) or thereafter deposited the disputed amounts into a bank
account located outside of Ecuador. Even after the arbitration started in earnest, Perenco stated
its willingness to comply with the Tribunal’s suggestion that the Parties agree an escrow
account arrangement such that future payments of the disputed sums could be set aside pending
a decision from the Tribunal on the merits. Thus, the financial burden of paying 99% of the
revenues above the reference price, while disadvantageous to Perenco, did not bring its
operation to a halt or, to revert to the tests previously cited, effectively neutralise the
investment or render it as if it had ceased to exist.'°™

Third, throughout 2008 and into 2009, Perenco continued to negotiate with Ecuador with a
view to arriving at a mutually satisfactory adjustment of their relationship. It has already been
found that it did so in an atmosphere of coercion, and was seeking to make the best of a

worsening situation, and for this reason the Tribunal does not attach much weight to this point,

Ibid., paragraph 151.

After the Tribunal had substantially completed its deliberations in this phase of the proceeding, on 28 May 2014,
Ecuador filed a letter together with a document that it proposed to put before the Tribunal. The document, that
Ecuador sought to have admitted as Exhibit E-376, was an internal ConocoPhillips email exchange entitled
“Drilling Plan Proposal from Ecuador”, dated 9 October 2007. In this document, employees of ConocoPhillips
(the parent company of Perenco’s fellow consortium member, Burlington) referred to communications with
Perenco after Decree 662 had bene promulgated in which Perenco expressed views as to the economics of
proceedings with certain drilling plans in the changed circumstances. By letter dated 14 June 2014, Perenco
objected to the admission of the document at this stage of the proceeding. After considering the document and the
Parties’ submissons, on 19 June 2014, the Tribunal informed the Parties that due to the lateness of the request and
the requirements of procedural fairness, it would not admit the document to the record. In the Tribunal’s view,
given its analysis of the Treaty claims, the document, had it been admitted, would have made no difference to the
outcome of this Decision.

688.

689.

690.

but it does provide some basis for the Tribunal’s view that Decree 662 did not bring the

investment to an end.

In arriving at this conclusion, it need hardly be said that it is obvious that the constraints
imposed by Decree 662 made its operating conditions highly sub-optimal for Perenco. The
immediate impact of Decree 662 (and subsequent statements from Ecuadorian ministers as to
the State’s intention to convert participation contracts into service contracts) likely led to a
reduction in investment, increased the demands placed on management, and caused substantial
stress to the business generally. But the central focus of the expropriation analysis is not on
whether a claimant’s business was optimal, but rather on whether it was effectively taken away

from it.

The Tribunal has focused primarily on the effect of Decree 662 on Perenco. The Claimant
made additional arguments going to the legitimacy and proportionality of the decree in terms
of its purpose. Indeed, one can reasonably ask whether it was appropriate for the State to claim
99% of the extraordinary revenues and whether this was disproportionate to the State’s public
policy objective. As Perenco pointed out, Ecuador had the benefit of “far less Draconian
measures” as evidenced by the enactment of Ley de Equidad Tributaria and its offer of a 70-30

split over higher reference prices than the one Law 42 employed.

This argument has some merit, but at the end of the day, the Tribunal does not believe that a
measure which may be disproportionate tips the balance to a finding of expropriation where the
evidence of effect indicates otherwise. The disproportionality point was relevant to the finding
that Decree 662 constituted a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard, but it does

not get the Claimant over the hurdle of proving an indirect expropriation in this case.

In sum, the Tribunal holds that Decree 662 did not effect an indirect expropriation. This, of
course, is not the end of the matter. There remains the combined effect of Decree 662, the
initiation of the coactivas, Ecuador’s decision not to comply with the Decision on Provisional
Measures, the suspension of operations and the initiation of caducidad proceedings. At the end
of the day, Perenco’s contractual rights were formally terminated by the declaration of
caducidad and the investment in Blocks 7 and 21 was effectively brought to an end as of the

date of that declaration.

e. The combined effect of Decree 662, the coactivas, and the declaration of caducidad

Ecuador argues that the Consortium pursued a kind of “self-expropriation” strategy whereby
Perenco and Burlington, having calculated the costs of continuing to operate the Blocks and
complying with Law 42 versus surrendering the Blocks, holding onto the monies which they
had paid into an account outside the territory of Ecuador, and suing for damages in this
arbitration, knowingly took action that would provoke the authorities to intervene and exercise

their statutory duties. 1085

Perenco rejected the “self-expropriation” allegation, noting firstly, that it expressed its
willingness to pay the disputed Law 42 sums into escrow during the pendency of the
arbitration (specifically future payments that would otherwise be due after the escrow
account’s establishment) and secondly, that after the seizures of its production led it to suspend
its operations, it offered to resume operations if Ecuador brought itself into compliance with

the Tribunal’s Decision on Provisional Measures. '°*° This of course did not occur.

The decision as to whether or not the measures, starting with the coactivas and continuing
through to the declaration of caducidad, amount to an expropriation of Perenco’s investment is

not as straightforward as either party suggests.

The Tribunal has already found that Perenco had a reasonable expectation under the
Participation Contracts that Ecuador would comply with any decision of the Tribunal. This
contractual expectation was buttressed by the general expectation that any disputing party has
that once the dispute is submitted to arbitration, both parties will seek to conform their conduct

to the Tribunal’s directives, particularly with respect to the non-aggravation of the dispute.

Ecuador found itself unable to comply with the Tribunal’s Decision in this case. The Tribunal
can well understand why in 2009, in applying a domestic law, Ecuador would wish to liquidate
the amounts claimed to be owing for 2008. However, when the matter was put before the
Tribunal, Ecuador’s duty to enforce the law conflicted with its contractual obligation to comply
with decisions of the Tribunal. The Tribunal recommended what it considered to be a
reasonable way to protect both Parties’ rights pending a final determination of their dispute.

1090

Regrettably, this was not possible in the circumstances. Perenco is correct to point out that had
the State stayed its hand in relation to the coactivas, the dispute would not have been

aggravated in the way in which it was.

The Tribunal is therefore presented with a situation in which the Respondent seized Perenco’s
oil production and put it to auction in order to retire the claimed Law 42 debt for 2008. When
Perenco (and Burlington) declined to use the monies located outside of Ecuador to pay the
claimed debt, it was obvious that Ecuador’s decision to employ the coactivas would have a

serious impact on the Consortium’s cashflow.

When it came to the auctioning of the seized oil, both Parties contributed to the situation. The
State held auctions and Perenco, it appears, threatened suit against any person who bought the
oil that had been seized from it.'°’ As a result, the prices achieved by Petroecuador’s
purchasing the oil in the absence of any other bidder were substantially less than the market
price. Perenco was in turn credited with a lower value than would have obtained had the oil
been sold at market prices. Ecuador bought the production of Blocks 7 and 21 for half and
subsequently two-thirds of its market price. '88 It credited these sales against Perenco’s Law 42
debt, but did so at the reduced auction sales price rather than at the market price of the

crude. '°8°

Perenco submits that under both Contracts, with Law 42 at 99% in effect, and its crude being
seized and auctioned off at less than its international market price, it was being asked to use its
operational revenue not caught by Law 42 to pay off remaining old and future Law 42

assessments.” It asserted that while it could have “continued operating for a limited amount

of time...by drawing down cash reserves, it could only continue to erode its overall return on

the free cash flow that the Consortium would have benefited from in 2008 and 2009 despite the

1093

effect of coactivas’”~ as flawed because it failed to account for the effect that the coactivas

“ dot . . «591094
had on “the Contractor’s incentives to continue operating.

He stated that the “impact of
Ecuador’s decision to seize production share as compensation for past Law 42 assessments can
be readily illustrated by the fact that these seizures were large enough to reduce Perenco’s
actual sales volumes to zero by early 2009. Thus, in reality, by 2009 Perenco could not have
had positive free cash flow since it was receiving no cash inflows from sales of oil. At the
same time, it continue[d] to incur significant out of pocket costs to continue operating the field
and to transport the production to the market place. In such circumstances, net free cash flow
ha[d] to be negative, not positive as claimed by Fair Links.”'°5 For example, for Block 7 in
2009, Professor Kalt submitted that instead of free cash flow of US $32 million, the
Consortium would have suffered a loss of US $66 million as a result of Law 42, Decree 662
and the coactivas.'”°
In its second report, Fair Links responded to Professor Kalt’s points, contending that the
“impact of the Coactivas procedures is different to an assessment of Law 42 (including Decree
662) in 2009.”!°°" In its First Report, Fair Links concluded that, assuming that Perenco paid its
Decree 662 dues for 2008, it should have nevertheless benefited from a “compound surplus
(free cash flow) of more than $8/bb!”.!°* Fair Links argued in this regard that Decree 662 and
the coactivas were two separate measures, and to add them would be to “distort the impact of

Law 42.”' It clarified its meaning in the course of the report, explaining that since the
coactiva procedures were meant to enforce Law 42, to request what should have been paid
under Law 42, its design was not to impose “an additional burden beyond Law 42” but to
collect “sums that Perenco already received as revenues in 2008 but had withheld.” '! It
challenged Professor Kalt’s analysis as “distorted by the impact of the discounts from the
actual auction procedures”, stating that since it had been “instructed that these discounts
resulted from Perenco’s own actions to hamper the auction process rather than from
Coactivas’s (sic) legal procedures”, its approach was that the “impact of Coactivas should be

assessed independently from discounts that were caused by Perenco itself.”'''

Ecuador’s second expert, the Brattle Group, took a different tack and responded by
extrapolating from the Annex V and development models Professor Kalt employed before
concluding that “[i]f we isolat[ed] the impact of the auction results...the evidence appear[ed]
entirely consistent with [its] analysis of the consortium’s financial incentives in April 2008,
namely that potentially greater value could be had for the consortium by withholding Law 42
and Decree 662 dues over the short-term than could be gained through paying the dues and
operating the fields until the scheduled end of the contracts.”!!°? Figures 12 and 13 of the
Brattle report suggest that in August 2008, when oil market prices hit a peak, |! the
cumulative value of Law 42 dues began to exceed the continuation value of operations to the
Consortium. Ecuador emphasised repeatedly that Law 42 and Decree 662 only applied to
revenues above statutory reference prices beyond the ex ante price assumptions of the
parties. !!* Brattle’s evidence is that since neither Law 42 nor Decree 662 reduced the expected
price net of taxes below the originally anticipated levels, neither measure reduced the cash

flows, internal rate of return or net present value of the financial models for Block 7 and 21

below the original estimates, !!5 Indeed, “the cash flows, internal rate of return or net present

value of these financial models were all much greater than the original estimates.”!!°°

Ecuador made the further point that Law 42 and Decree 662 came into effect after oil prices
had already begin to rise; in other words they did not “deprive Perenco of the massive
windfalls it had already generated in a period of skyrocketing oil prices before 2006.”!'"’ The
suggestion is that this should be accounted for in any analysis of whether the IRR of 15% was
being met over time (i.e., challenging Professor Kalt’s IRR of 13% as ignoring the upsides that

Perenco had already received). 1108

In the end, the narrow question for the Tribunal is whether Perenco, having sought the aid of
the Tribunal, could then take comfort that its refusal to pay the 2008 Law 42 dues to Ecuador
would protect it in this arbitration without any potentially adverse consequences. The Tribunal
has carefully considered the Parties’ positions. It considers that Perenco had a right to expect
that Ecuador would desist from enforcing the coactivas during the pendency of the arbitration.
It also considers that in deciding to withhold all Law 42 amounts claimed in 2008, Perenco
assumed that the Tribunal would accept its claims that none of the Law 42 dues claimed by the
State were permissible under the Contracts or the Treaty. Given that Perenco has not made out
its claims in respect of Law 42 at 50%, the Tribunal holds that even though Ecuador should
have complied with the Decision on Provisional Measures, the coactivas ought not to be
included in the Tribunal’s analysis of the measures said collectively to constitute an indirect
expropriation. (Quite apart from the expropriation issue, the Tribunal considers that
Petroecuador’s decision to credit the Consortium’s tax debt with only the price received in the
auction was unfair and inequitable. It can be safely assumed that Petroecuador would have sold
the oil at the market price and by crediting Perenco with the depressed auction price instead of
the prevailing market price, it would plainly take longer for the seizures to pay down the debt
claimed to be owing. In addition, to the extent that Perenco has succeeded in its claim that the
application of Decree 662 at 99% violated Article 4 of the Treaty, as found at paragraphs 606-
607 above, the enforcement of the coactivas to collect the claimed additional 49% constituted a

breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard, but it was not an expropriation of the

investment.)

f The suspension of operations and the State’s response thereto

This takes the Tribunal to the suspension of operations which can be addressed summarily.
Perenco argued that the State’s decision to intervene and operate the blocks after it decided to
suspend operations amounted to an expropriatory act. While the Tribunal has accepted that the
defence of exceptio non adempleti contractus was available to Perenco under Ecuadorian law,
and therefore it could lawfully suspend operations when faced with a breach of contract
without itself being found to be in breach, this does not dictate the conclusion that when faced
with suspension of operations, the State was powerless to intervene and that any such

intervention constituted an expropriation.

Here the Tribunal accepts the Respondent’s argument that when the Consortium announced its
intention to suspend operations, there were good and valid reasons for the State to intervene in
order to operate the Blocks, thereby ensuring their continuity and maintaining their

productivity. 109

The Respondent has demonstrated the potential production losses and other
technical problems that could have ensued had operations been suspended. The Tribunal
therefore accepts that the State had the right to operate and maintain the Blocks after the
Consortium withdrew.'!'° This intervention — which cannot be said to have interfered with the
Consortium’s rights of management and control over the Blocks because the Consortium had
voluntarily surrendered such rights on a temporary basis — did not amount to an expropriation

and cannot be counted towards one.

g. The declaration of caducidad

The Tribunal now turns to the Respondent’s decision to initiate caducidad proceedings. !!"!

This too can be dealt with summarily. While it accepts that the State had the right to intervene
and operate the blocks, the Tribunal does not accept that the State was bound to bring the

Claimant’s contracts to an end by means of a caducidad declaration. The Tribunal notes in this

regard that under Chapter IX of the Hydrocarbons Law, Article 74, the Ministry “may declare
the caducidad of contracts, if the contractor” engages in any of thirteen different types of acts
including suspending operations “without cause justifying it, as determined by
PETROECUADOR.” |!” The Tribunal attaches particular importance to the fact that the
opening phrase of Article 74 is expressed in permissive rather than mandatory terms. That is,
the Ministry is empowered to declare the caducity of contracts in any of the specified

circumstances, but it is not obliged to do so.

The Tribunal accepts Ecuador’s submission that this was not done without fair warning to the
Consortium. '!'? The Ministry and Petroecuador wrote to the Consortium on four occasions
requesting it to resume operations and warned that a failure to do so could lead to the
termination of their Contracts. '!

But in all the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal considers that the Ministry should have
stayed its hand and awaited the outcome of this arbitration. It was not contrary to Article 6 for
Ecuador to have continued to operate the oilfields in the face of the Claimant’s refusal to return
until the coactiva matter had been addressed to its satisfaction. But the decision to initiate
caducity proceedings and thereby bring Perenco’s contractual rights to an end during the midst

of this arbitration leads the Tribunal to find a breach of Article 6.

In this regard, the Tribunal notes that when Ecuador first indicated its inability to comply with
the Decision on Provisional Measures, it stated that it had no intention to terminate the

Participation Contracts:

...Nevertheless, Ecuador is committed to furthering the central goal of the
Decision, namely to avoid any actions that would undermine the effectiveness of
any potential award that might be issued (should the Tribunal ultimately affirm its
jurisdiction and proceed to the merits). To that end, Ecuador intends to carry out
the enforcement of Law 42 in such a way as to avoid any disruption of Perenco’s
business. In particular, Ecuador does not intend to seize any assets of the
Consortium beyond oil equivalent in value to the outstanding debt. Nor does

suspension of its operations and the ensuing correspondence between the Parties. Be that as it
may, the Ministry had the discretion not to commence caducidad proceedings and it is the
Tribunal’s judgment that this discretion should have been exercised in favour of not pursuing
caducidad while the Parties’ respective rights and obligations were being determined in this
proceeding. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that as of the date of caducidad having been
declared and the Consortium’s interests were finally brought to an end, the Respondent
effected an expropriation of Perenco’s contractual rights contrary to Article 6 of the Treaty.
This is the date of the expropriation; for the reasons given above, the Tribunal rejects the

creeping expropriation argument advanced by Perenco.

This declaration of caducity was for the same reason equally a breach of the Block 21 Contract
because, having occupied the blocks in order to safeguard the oilfields, it was unnecessary for

the Ministry to then bring the Contract to an end.

caducidad in respect of the Block 7 Contract. This falls outside of the Tribunal’s

contractual jurisdiction.

The Tribunal has jurisdiction over the claims of breach of Treaty.

The claim of breach of contract in respect of Law 42 at 50% is rejected.
The claim of breach of contract in respect of Law 42 at 99% is upheld.

The claim of breach of the Block 7 Contract in respect of alleged discriminatory

treatment of Perenco in comparison to Andes Petroleum is rejected.

The claim of breach of the Block 21 Contract as a result of the declaration of

caducidad is upheld.

The claim of breach of Article 4 of the Treaty in respect of Law 42 at 50% is rejected.
The claim of breach of Article 4 of the Treaty in respect of Law 42 at 99% is upheld.
The claim that Decree 662 constituted a breach of Article 6 of the Treaty is rejected.

The claim that the enforcement of the coactivas constituted a breach of Article 6 of

the Treaty is rejected.

The claim that the Respondent’s intervention in Blocks 7 and 21 in order to operate

The claim that the declaration of caducidad constituted a breach of Article 6 of the

Treaty is upheld.

Since the Respondent has brought a counterclaim which has already been the subject
of pleadings and a hearing, the Tribunal is not in a position to consider granting the
relief sought by the Claimant at paragraph 511 of its Reply, namely, a declaration that
Perenco has no further obligation of any kind, to Ecuador, Petroecuador or any other
Ecuadorian department or instrumentality, whether under the Participation Contracts

or otherwise, with respect to Blocks 7 and 21; and

Having found the Respondent to be in breach of the Participation Contracts and the
Treaty, it is necessary to move to the damages phase of this arbitration. The Tribunal
will lay down a briefing schedule as well as propose dates for a hearing on damages

for the parties’ consideration.
