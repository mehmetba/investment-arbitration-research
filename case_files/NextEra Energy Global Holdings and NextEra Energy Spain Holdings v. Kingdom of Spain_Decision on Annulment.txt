Case 1:19-cv-01618-TSC Document 59-1 Filed 03/25/22 Page 14 of 163

IL. INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

1. This annulment proceeding concerns an application for annulment (the “Application”) of
the award rendered on 31 May 2019 in the arbitration proceeding between NextEra Energy
Global Holdings B.V. and NextEra Energy Spain Holdings B.V. and the Kingdom of Spain
(ICSID Case No. ARB/14/11) (the “Award”) rendered by a Tribunal composed of
Professor Donald M. McRae (President), the Honourable Yves Fortier, P.C., C.C., 0.Q.,

Q.C., and Professor Laurence Boisson de Chazournes (the “Tribunal’).

2. The respondents on annulment are NextEra Energy Global Holdings B.V. (“NextEra
Global’), and NextEra Energy Spain Holdings B.V. (“NextEra Spain”), both limited
liability companies incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands (bes/oten vennootschap

met beperkte aansprakelijkheid), (collectively, “NextEra Entities” or the “Claimants”).!
3. The applicant on annulment is the Kingdom of Spain (“Spain” or the “Applicant’).

4. The NextEra Entities and Spain are collectively referred to as the “Parties”. The Parties’

representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).

5. The Award decided on a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”) on the basis of the Energy Charter Treaty
(the “ECT”), which entered into force on 16 April 1998 for the Netherlands and Spain, and
the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of

Other States, which entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the “ICSID Convention”).

6. The dispute in the original proceeding related to regulatory measures implemented by

Spain modifying the economic regime for renewable energy investments in Spain.

7. In the Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Quantum dated 12 March 2019 (the
“Decision”), issued 80 days before the Award, the Tribunal found Spain liable for breach

of the fair and equitable treatment standard in Art. 10(1) of the ECT.* The Tribunal

| While the Applicant uses the “Florida Power & Light, Inc”, “FPL” and “NextEra” interchangeably in its submissions,
for purposes of this decision, the Committee uses “NextEra Entities” or “Claimants” unless otherwise relevant.

2 Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Quantum, 12 March 2019 (“Decision”), RL-132, 4] 682.

Case 1:19-cv-01618-TSC Document 59-1 Filed 03/25/22 Page 15 of 163

stipulated that the Decision constituted an “integral part of this Award and it is hereby
incorporated as Annex A”. The Tribunal found that “on the basis of the assurances given
to them by the Spanish authorities, in the broader context of the specific terms of
Regulatory Framework I, registration in the Pre-assignment Registry and the Ministerial

Resolutic of 28 D ber 2010, Claii had a legitii ex] ion that the

 

 

regulatory regime in RD 661/2007 would not be changed in a way that would undermine
the security and viability of their investment”.* The Tribunal further held that, the “denial
of legitimate expectations is based on the failure to provide that certainty and security by
changing fundamentally the regime under which remuneration was to be calculated”. The

Tribunal did not rule on the other liability claims.°

In its Award, the Tribunal reaffirmed the Decision and ordered Spain to pay the NextEra
Entities damages assessed at EUR 290.6 million, together with pre-Award and post-Award

interest and costs.’

Spain applied for the annulment of the Award on the basis of Art. 52(1) of the ICSID
Convention, identifying three grounds for annulment: (i) the Tribunal manifestly exceeded
its powers (ICSID Convention, Art. 52(1)(b)); (ii) there was a serious departure from a
fundamental rule of procedure (ICSID Convention, Art. 52(1)(d)); and (iii) the Award
failed to state the reasons on which it was based (ICSID Convention, Art. 52(1)(e)).®

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On 26 September 2019, Spain submitted its Application on annulment of the Award. In the
Application, Spain also requested (i) a provisional stay of enforcement of the Award in
accordance with Art. 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2),

which provide that the Secretary-General shall grant an automatic provisional stay until the

3 Award, 31 May 2019 (“Award”), RL-130, 4 5.

ad hoc committee rules on such request; and (ii) the continuation of the stay of
enforcement until the decision in this annulment proceeding is rendered by the ad hoc

committee.

On 2 October 2019, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 50(2), the acting Secretary-
General of ICSID registered the Application. On the same date, in accordance with ICSID
Arbitration Rule 54(2), the acting Secretary-General informed the Parties that the

enforcement of the Award had been provisionally stayed.

By letter dated 16 December 2019, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rules 6 and 53,
the Parties were notified that an ad hoc committee composed of Professor Joongi Kim, a
national of the Republic of Korea, Professor Lawrence Boo, a national of Singapore, and
Mr. Humberto Saenz-Marinero, a national of El Salvador, had been constituted following
its members’ appointment by the Chairman of the Administrative Council (“the
Committee”). On the same date, the Parties were notified that Ms. Natali Sequeira, Team

Leader — Legal Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Committee.

On 16 January 2020, Spain filed a request to continue the stay of enforcement of the

Award.

On 26 January 2020, the NextEra Entities filed an opposition to Spain’s request to

continue the stay of enforcement of the Award.

On 30 January 2020, Spain filed a reply on the request to continue the stay of enforcement

of the Award.

On 5 February 2020, the NextEra Entities filed a rejoinder on the request to continue the

stay of enforcement of the Award.

In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rules 53 and 13(1), the Committee held a First
Session with the Parties on 11 February 2020 by teleconference. On the same date before
the First Session, the Committee held a hearing in which the Parties’ representatives

explained their arguments in favor of and against the continuance of the stay of

enforcement. They further discussed and agreed to the applicable rules for the annulment

proceeding.

On 17 February 2020, the NextEra Entities submitted a letter that sought to clarify whether
they could execute an undertaking to protect against attachment of any funds by third
parties and to offer proof as to the corporate relationship between NextEra Global, NextEra
Energy Canada Holdings B.V., and the nine wind farm projects in Canada identified in

their opposition to Spain’s request to continue the stay of enforcement of the Award.

On 24 February 2020, the European Commission (“EC”) submitted an application for leave
to intervene as a non-disputing party pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2). The Centre
transmitted the application to the Parties and the members of the Committee on

25 February 2020.

On 27 February 2020, the Committee invited the Parties to submit any observations on

EC’s application.

Following the first session, on 4 March 2020, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 1
(“PO1”) recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters and the Committee’s
decision on disputed issues. PO1 provided, inter alia, that the procedural languages would
be English and Spanish, and that the place of proceeding would be Washington, D.C. PO1

also set out the agreed procedural calendar for the proceeding.

On 6 March 2020, Spain submitted its comments to the EC’s application, requesting that

the Committee grant the request for intervention as a non-disputing party.

On the same date, the NextEra Entities filed their comments to EC’s application, requesting

that the Committee reject the application.

On 13 March 2020, Spain filed a request for leave to submit three types of new expert

evidence into the annulment proceeding.

On 15 March 2020, the Committee invited the NextEra Entities to respond to Spain’s

request.

On 18 March 2020, the NextEra Entities filed observations on Spain’s request, requesting

the Committee to deny it in its entirety.

On 2 April 2020, the Committee issued its Decision on the Request to Admit New
Evidence, allowing Spain to submit “one expert report or declaration by a university
professor that addresses the relevant rules and principles of European Union [(“EU”)]
Law for purposes of Art. 52(1)(b) and (e) of the ICSID Convention under the terms
stipulated in Section 15.3 of Procedural Order No. I”, and denying Spain’s other requests

to submit additional expert evidence.”

On 3 April 2020, the Committee issued its Decision on the EC’s Application to Intervene
as a Non-Disputing Party, granting EC permission to present a written submission,
“addressing why the Arbitral Tribunal lacked jurisdiction based upon the conflict of EU
Law and the ECT’.'° The Committee denied the EC’s “participation in the ruling of the
stay of enforcement” and deferred its decision on whether to allow the EC to participate in

the hearing.!!

On 6 April 2020, the Committee issued its Decision on the Stay of Enforcement of the

Award, extending the stay of enforcement of the Award “on a provisional basis”.'*

On 16 April 2020, Spain filed a Memorial on Annulment.

On 23 April 2020, the EC filed a written submission pursuant to ICSID Arbitration
Rule 37(2).

On 25 May 2020, the NextEra Entities filed their observations on the EC’s written

submission.

The Parties filed their submissions on costs on 25 February 2021.

On 10 September 2021, Spain filed a request to introduce into the record the Court of
Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) Judgment dated 2 September 2021 issued in the
Case C-741/19, Republic of Moldova v. Komstroy, which was rendered in a request for a
preliminary ruling made by the Paris Court of Appeal to the CJEU concerning the
interpretation of certain provisions of the Energy Charter Treaty and the concept of

“investment” under the same.

Following the Committee’s invitation, on 14 September 2021, the NextEra Entities
submitted their response to Spain’s application opposing the introduction of the CJEU

Judgment into the record.

On 17 September 2021, the Committee granted Spain’s request to submit the CJEU

Judgment as a new legal authority. The Committee further granted leave for the Parties to

submit their observations on the CJEU Judgment, together with “an elaboration of how the

Judgment is related to the nature and purpose of the annulment proceeding given the

annulment committee's mandate under the ICSID Convention”. On 24 September 2021,

REQUEST FOR RELIEF

Spain requests the Committee to:

(i) annul the Award in its entirety or, alternatively, annul it in part on the basis of the

following grounds and arguments:

(a) in accordance with Art. 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal
manifestly exceeded its powers for any or all of the following reasons: (i) the

NextEra Entities did not have investor status; (ii) the NextEra Entities did not make

Case 1:19-cv-01618-TSC Document 59-1 Filed 03/25/22 Page 23 of 163

an investment; or (iii) there was no direct relationship between the investor and

Spain;

(b) under Art. 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, the Award failed to state the
reasons why the Tribunal considered that the NextEra Entities had an investment

and were investors;

(c) in accordance with Art. 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal
manifestly exceeded its powers when Spain availed itself of the power provided for
in Art. 17 of the ECT and the Tribunal rejected it by inventing requirements for the

exercise of that power not provided for in the ECT;

(d) under Art. 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, the Award failed to state the
reasons why it did not accept the denial of benefits ground provided for in Art. 17

of the ECT and imposed requirements for such refusal not set out in Art. 17;

(e) under Art. 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded
its powers by conferring international protection on those who did not turn to the
Tribunal with clean hands and being against jus cogens and the principle that

international arbitration cannot shelter or protect fraudulent actions;

(f) under Art. 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, the Award failed to state the
reasons why it considered that the Tribunal had jurisdiction to hear an arbitration
initiated by the NextEra Entities in order to obtain protection for investments made

without clean hands;

(g) under Art. 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded
its powers when it heard a dispute between an alleged investor of an EU Member

State and an EU Member State;

(h) under Art. 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, the Award failed to state the
reasons why it considered that the Tribunal had jurisdiction to hear a dispute

between an alleged investor of an EU Member State and an EU Member State;

Case 1:19-cv-01618-TSC Document 59-1 Filed 03/25/22 Page 24 of 163

(i) under Art. 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded

its powers by dispensing with the application of applicable international rules,

including the ECT itself and totally dismissing the application of all EU law;

(j) under Art. 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, the Award failed to state the

reasons why it disregarded the application of applicable international standards,

including the ECT itself and why it totally disregarded the application of all EU

law;

(k) under Art. 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded

its powers by making a manifestly incorrect application of applicable law to be

taken into account in assessing legitimate expectations;

(J) under Art. 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, the Award failed to state the

reasons for how there may be legitimate expectations of petrification of subsidies

contrary to EU law and other applicable legislation;

(m) under Art. 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, the Award failed to state the

reasons in determining which date should be taken into account as the date of the

investment and, without deciding on the date of the investment, resolving on the

alleged legitimate expectations;

(n) under Art. 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, the Award failed to state the

reasons with regard to liability;

(0) under Art. 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, the Award failed to state the

reasons with regard to damages;

(p) under Art. 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded

its powers by granting damages contrary to its own conclusions on quantum;

(q) under Art. 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention, there was a serious departure

from a fundamental rule of procedure to the extent that the Tribunal allowed the

NextEra Entities to submit documents, expert reports, memorials and witness

ll

Case 1:19-cv-01618-TSC Document 59-1 Filed 03/25/22 Page 25 of 163

statements outside the deadlines set by the Tribunal, breaking the balance of the

Parties in the process;'+

(r) under Art. 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention, there was a serious departure from
a fundamental rule of procedure to the extent that the Tribunal committed multiple
procedural breaches in relation to the evidentiary activity and the assessment of

evidence developed in the Arbitration;

(s) under Art. 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, the Award repeatedly failed to
state the reasons in relation to the evidentiary activity and the assessment of

evidence developed in the Arbitration;

(t) under Art. 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention, there was a serious departure from
a fundamental rule of procedure insofar as the Tribunal, in breach of the principle
of congruence, infringed the right of defence of the Spain by condemning on
grounds different from those expressed by the NextEra Entities in their

memorials; !>

(u) under Art. 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention, there was a serious departure from
a fundamental rule of procedure to the extent that the Tribunal relied on a false

document to make its decision; and

(v) under Art. 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, the Award failed to state the
reasons in so far as Spain denounced and demonstrated the falsehood of a key
document in the proceedings and the Tribunal completely failed to resolve or even

comment on this point.
(ii) reject all requests made by the NextEra Entities;

(iii) order the NextEra Entities to pay all the costs of the proceedings, including the fees

and expenses of the Spain's legal service, together with interest at an appropriate rate; and

(iv) annul the Award if the facts described by Spain constitute a ground for annulment
according to Art. 52(1) of the ICSID Convention, other than those grounds alleged by

Spain.!°
The NextEra Entities request the Committee issue a final decision:

(i) declaring that Spain has not established any ground for annulling the Award, in whole

or in part; or

(ii) in the alternative, declaring that any ground for potential annulment established by
Spain shall not result in annulment of the Award, exercising the Committee's discretion

under Art. 52(3) of the ICSID Convention;
(iii) denying Spain’s Application;

(iv) ordering Spain to bear the entire costs of this annulment proceeding, including the fees
and expenses of the Members of the Committee and all associated costs including the

ICSID fees and translators’ fees; and

(v) ordering Spain to reimburse the NextEra Entities for their full legal costs and expenses
incurred in the defence of these annulment proceedings (including expert fees), together
with interest to run from the date of the Committee’s Decision on Annulment until the date

of payment by Spain, at the same rate of interest ordered by the Tribunal in its Award.!7

APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARDS FOR ANNULMENT

As an initial matter, the Committee extends its appreciation to the Parties and their
representatives for their consummate professionalism and extensive written and oral

submissions. The Committee has carefully considered all of the Parties’ arguments even if

not referred to expressly, or not set out in full in this Decision and they are subsumed in

the Tribunal’s analysis.

The Committee first provides its analysis on the applicable legal standards for annulment.
The Committee observes that the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules
provide the legal standards that apply in an annulment proceeding and are the source of the

Committee’s mandate.

Art. 52(1) of the ICSID Convention provides that a party may seek annulment on one or

more of the following grounds:
(a) that the Tribunal was not properly constituted;
(b) that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;
(c) that there was corruption on the part of a member of the Tribunal;
(d) that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; or
(e) that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.

The Committee confirms that the five grounds under Art. 52(1) are the exclusive grounds

for annulment.

Art. 52(3) of the ICSID Convention adds that an ad hoc committee “shall have the authority

to annul the award or any part thereof on any of the grounds set forth in paragraph (1)”.'®

Art. 53(1) of the ICSID Convention confirms that an annulment should not amount to an
appeal by providing that an “award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject
to any appeal”. A fundamental goal of the ICSID system is to assure the finality of an

ICSID arbitration award.!°

Case 1:19-cv-01618-TSC Document 59-1 Filed 03/25/22 Page 28 of 163

62. As an initial matter, the Committee observes that the Vienna Convention on the Law of
Treaties (“Vienna Convention”) as such is not applicable to the ICSID Convention,
which predates it. Nevertheless, its provisions on treaty interpretation are widely regarded
as declaratory of customary international law. Both Parties extensively cite the Vienna
Convention in their memorials and the Netherlands and Spain are both contracting parties
to the Vienna Convention. The Committee considers it appropriate to be guided by the
General Rule of Interpretation in Art. 31 of the Vienna Convention such that interpretation
of relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention should be conducted “in good faith and in
accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context

and in the light of its object and purpose”.”!

63. The Parties have referred to prior ad hoc committee decisions for the various criteria to be
considered when deciding an annulment. The Committee confirms that prior decisions of
other ad hoc committees are non-binding, and notes, as prior ad hoc committees have, that
no jurisprudence constante can be discerned regarding annulment. The Committee
concludes that, subject to the specific facts of the relevant case, due consideration should
be given to earlier cases where these are indicative of a certain line of jurisprudential
consistency. The Committee’s decision ultimately remains one based on its own opinion

given the particular circumstances of the case at hand.

A. MANIFEST EXCESS OF POWERS (ART. 52(1)(b) OF THE ICSID CONVENTION)

a. Spain’s Position

As Spain points out, regarding Art. 52(1)(b), committees have “on some occasions, made
a very uniform and undisputed interpretation of the standard” but “on other occasions

there are certain nuances among the arbitral precedents” >

Spain indicates that in Spanish, the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy of the
Spanish Language cited by Spain provides that the first meaning of “manifiesta” is
“descubierta” or “discovered”.*> In English, the Oxford dictionary provides that
“manifest” means “easy to see or understand”.** In French, the Larousse dictionary cited
by Spain provides that “manifeste” means “dont la nature, la réalité, l'authenticité
s'imposent avec évidence” or “whose nature, reality or authenticity are evident”.?> Spain
suggests that manifest should be interpreted to mean that “if an overshoot of powers is

discovered” or “becomes evident”.*6

Spain cites the ICSID Background Paper on Annulment and the History of the ICSID
Convention to assert that a manifest excess of powers may exist, inter alia, when a tribunal
does not “apply the appropriate law (including ius cogens) or when the Tribunal exceeds
its jurisdiction or has no jurisdiction or the Tribunal decides on matters not raised by the
Parties”.*” Spain considers mistaken or wrong application of the law could be annullable.
Spain relies on Soufraki v. The United Arab Emirates and Occidental Petroleum v. Ecuador

and other ad hoc committees’ observations for the view that “[i]n exceptional

circumstances ...a gross or egregious error of law could be construed to amount to a failure

to apply the proper law” and could be grounds for annulment.?* (emphasis added).

Spain also cites Pey Casado v. Chile I, which concluded that a manifest excess of power
could exist “as long as it is sufficiently clear and serious” even though a Tribunal engaged

in “extensive argumentation and analysis”?

b The NextEra Entities’ Position

The NextEra Entities assert that Art. 52(1)(b) sets a demanding threshold. The Claimants
submit that a “manifest” excess of jurisdiction must be “obvious, i.e., not discerned through
elaborate arguments by each side”.*® The NextEra Entities note that in Spanish, the
Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy of the Spanish Language cited by Spain provides
that “manifiesta” has the meaning of not only “descubierta” or “discovered” but also
“patente” or “patent”, or “clara” or “clear”.>' In French, the NextEra Entities cite the
French Academy’s Dictionary that provides the meaning of “manifeste” as “dont
existence, la réalité est évidente, incontestable; flagrant, patent” or “whose existence
[and] reality is evident, incontestable, flagrant, patent” .**

The Claimants point out that an ad hoc committee is not empowered to verify whether a
tribunal’s jurisdictional analysis was “correct”, but only whether it was “tenable”. Where
other ICSID tribunals have reached the same jurisdictional finding, where “reasonable
minds” disagree as to jurisdiction, or where there can be more than one possible
interpretation of a dispute provision, for instance, the “manifest” requirement cannot be

fulfilled.*3

The NextEra Entities argue that an error related to the applicable law does not amount to a
manifest excess of powers.*+ They assert only a failure to choose the proper law applicable
to the merits would be annullable. They also cite Occidental Petroleum v. Ecuador for the
view that even then “annulment...is only permitted if the tribunal totally disregarded
applicable law or grounded its award on a law other than the applicable law”.*> They
stress that the few committees that annulled based on a failure to apply the applicable law
have been “widely criticised as unfortunate examples of committees straying past their

limited mandate” *

G The Committee’s Analysis

The Committee observes that for annulment to occur under Art. 52(1)(b) a tribunal must
have “exceeded its powers” in a “manifest” manner. An application under Art. 52(1)(b)
must therefore demonstrate both an “excess of powers” and that such excess was

“manifest? 7

The Committee notes that a key consideration under Art. 52(1)(b) is what constitutes a
“manifest” excess of powers. The Spanish version of the ICSID Convention uses the term
“manifiestamente” and the French version, the term “manifeste”. All three terms are

equally authoritative and appear to derive from the same word.

In Spanish, the Diccionario de la Lengua Espanola de la Real Academia Espanola
(Dictionary of the of the Spanish Language of the Royal Spanish Academy) cited by both
Parties provides that “manifiestamente” means “de una manera manifiesta”.** In turn,
“manifiesta” means not only “descubierta” (“discovered”), but also “patente” (“patent”),

r “clara” (“clear”).*? In French, the Larousse dictionary cited by Spain provides that

order to ascertain if any alleged excess of powers was so egregious as to be manifest”, AES Summit Generation
Limited and AES-Tisza Erémii Kfi. v. Republic of Hungary, \CSID Case No. ARB/07/22, Decision on Annulment, 29

18

Case 1:19-cv-01618-TSC Document 59-1 Filed 03/25/22 Page 32 of 163

“manifeste” means “dont la nature, la réalité, l'authenticité s‘imposent avec évidence” or
“whose nature, reality or authenticity are evident’.*° Whereas the French Academy’s
Dictionary, as cited by the NextEra Entities, provides the meaning of “manifeste” as “dont
existence, la réalité est évidente, incontestable; flagrant, patent” or “whose existence
[and] reality is evident, incontestable; flagrant, patent”. In English, the Oxford dictionary
cited by both Parties provides that “manifest” means “easy to see or understand”.*! The
NextEra Entities also referred to the dictionary meaning “clearly apparent, obvious” as

cited by the Dugan v. Turkmenistan committee.”

75. The Committee finds that the ordinary meaning as described in the dictionary of
“manifest”, “manifiesta” and “manifeste” is virtually identical in all three languages and
the meaning of “patent”, “clear”, “evident”, “clearly apparent’, “obvious”, “flagrant” are
practically interchangeable. Spain’s suggestion that “manifest” should be interpreted to
mean “become evident” or “is discovered” as though “manifest” means one must engage
in some additional process to “become evident” or “be discovered” are not persuasive and

deviate from the plain meaning of the term as described in the various dictionaries.

76. The Committee concludes that based on the ordinary meaning of the term “manifest”, the

excess of power must reach the level of being “patent”, “clear”, “evident” and “easy to see
or understand”. The Committee decides that its analysis should focus on the “ease with
which [the excess of power] is perceived” such that it must be “discerned with little effort

and without deeper analysis”. Thus, instead of the “gravity” or “seriousness” of the

excess of powers, the focus should be on “the cognitive process that makes it apparent”.

77. Numerous other ad hoc committees have broadly reached the same conclusion regarding

the meaning of the term “manifest”. Soufraki v. The United Arab Emirates proclaimed that

“manifest” as “clearly apparent to the sight or understanding; obvious” (available at
https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=manifest)).

““manifest’ is a strong and emphatic term referring to obviousness” and should be
“textually obvious and substantively serious”.*> (emphasis added). CDC v. Seychelles
described that “the excess must be plain on its face” (emphasis added) and Rumeli v.
Kazakhstan similarly held it must be “evident on the face of the award”.*° The Wena Hotels
v. Egypt committee stated “manifest” must be “self-evident rather than the product of

elaborate interpretation one way or the other”.*” (emphasis added).
78. Hence, the term “manifest” establishes a high threshold that an applicant must meet.

79. The ordinary meaning of “manifest” must be interpreted in its context, and in light of the
object and purpose of the ICSID Convention. Art. 52 establishes the exclusive grounds for
annulment and Art. 53 stipulates the finality and binding nature of an award. The drafting
history also confirms that “manifest” was added to address concerns that “annulment posed

a risk of frustrating awards and therefore the annulment provision should be made more

restrictive” “8

80. The Committee agrees with past ad hoc committees that if any apparent excess in the

exercise of the tribunal’s powers is “susceptible of argument ‘one way or the other’?
(CDC v. Seychelles), or if “reasonable minds differ as to whether or not the tribunal issued
a correct decision” (Standard Chartered y. Tanzania Electric), then the manifest

requirement would not be satisfied.*° Put it differently, as TECO v. Guatemala explained,

Case 1:19-cv-01618-TSC Document 59-1 Filed 03/25/22 Page 34 of 163

“an annulment committee is not empowered to verify whether a tribunal’s jurisdictional
analysis or a tribunal’s application of the law was correct, but only whether it was tenable
as a matter of law”.*! The Committee agrees that its role is not to determine whether a
tribunal’s analysis was correct, but only whether it was “tenable”. If its decision was
tenable, a tribunal could not have committed an excess of powers that is “patent”, “clear”,

“evident” or “easy to see or understand”.

A manifest excess of powers based on a tribunal’s treaty interpretation will be generally
difficult to establish. The Committee agrees with the Lucchetti v. Peru committee that
treaty interpretation by its nature is “not an exact science, and it is frequently the case that
there is more than one possible interpretation of a disputed provision”. If other ICSID
committees reached a similar finding or interpretation on the same issue, this will
demonstrate that an issue was “susceptible of argument ‘one way or the other”. One
interpretation of a treaty among many possible ones will not qualify as a manifest excess
of powers. As Alapli v. Turkey held, “[t]he Applicant would need to prove that its
interpretation is a monolithic and firmly settled principle of law that is ‘not subject to

debate”.

The ICSID Annulment Background Paper confirms that the focus of the excess of powers
provision pertains to a tribunal’s powers to decide on its jurisdiction and to the applicable
law.* It will include, for example, the failure to exercise jurisdiction or a failure to apply
the law agreed to by the parties.*> As found by the committee in Jmpregilo v. Argentina,
“[f]ailure to apply the law is part of the concept of manifest excess of powers and for the

reasons set out above, should be self-evident, clear, obvious, flagrant and substantially

serious”.*© The Committee also agrees with Schreuer that annulment for non-application
of the applicable law would be possible where a tribunal has failed to apply the proper law

in toto.”

The Parties hold different positions on whether an error in the application of the law or a
misapplication of the law qualifies as a manifest excess of powers. Both Parties cite
Occidental Petroleum v. Ecuador in support of their respective positions. Spain believes a
gross and egregious error may be annullable grounds whereas the NextEra Entities
disagree. The Committee observes that the “fine line between failure to apply the proper
law and erroneous application of the law” is difficult to discern. ** An alleged
misapplication could easily overstep the line to become an appeal instead of an annulment.
The drafting history of the ICSID Convention confirms that an “erroneous application of
the law could not amount to an annullable error, even if it is manifest”. The drafting
Legal Committee of the ICSID Convention confirmed that even a “manifestly incorrect
application of the law” was not a ground for annulment.®° The Committee finds that unlike
a non-application or disregarding of the law, a mere misapplication or incorrect application

of the law would not meet the high threshold of a manifest excess of powers.*!

The Committee finds that for a misapplication of the law to become annullable it would
require meeting an “extraordinarily high standard”.® The Committee agrees with the

Alapli v. Turkey committee that it would require a “‘gross and egregious’ misapplication

of law” reaching the level of “non-application of the proper law”. An applicant would
have to show that the tribunal’s legal analysis was “so untenable or implausible that the
error is evident on the face of the award’”.°* As Occidental Petroleum v. Ecuador
similarly provided, “[o]n/y exceptionally gross or egregious errors of law, acknowledged
as such by any reasonable person, could be construed to amount to a failure to apply the
proper law, and could give rise to the possibility of annulment?.® Furthermore, as
suggested by Soufraki v. The United Arab Emirates, the “gross and consequential
misinterpretation or misapplication of the proper law” must be such that “no reasonable
person (‘bon pére de famille’) could accept” it.° The Committee concludes that a
misapplication of the law could only be annullable if it was so “gross and egregious” that

“no reasonable person could accept it’ and amounted to a non-application of the law.

Overall, as long as a tribunal’s decision and its reasoning reflected in the Award is tenable,
it would not be a “patent”, “clear”, “evident”, “obvious”, “flagrant” or “easy to see or
understand” excess of powers, and a tribunal could not have manifestly exceeded its

powers to justify annulment of an award.”

SERIOUS DEPARTURE FROM A FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF PROCEDURE (ART. 52(1)(d) OF

THE ICSID CONVENTION)

a. Spain’s Position

87. According to Spain, a departure is serious if a party is “deprived of the protection afforded
by the relevant procedural rule”.®* A procedural rule is fundamental if it refers to the
“essential impartiality that must govern all proceedings and is included within the
minimum standards of ‘due process' required by international law”. Spain focuses its
claim on the right to be heard, equality of arms, treatment of evidence, and the rules on the

burden of proof.”

88. Spain contends the right to be heard can be violated when a party cannot submit “‘al/ the
arguments and all the evidence it [deems] relevant”,”! “does not have the opportunity to
respond ad ly to the a ‘sand evide bmitted by the other party”,” or a

request for the submission of documents is unjustifiably refused.’

89. Spain agrees with Fraport v. Philippines that “[iJt is [not an] answer to a failure to accord
such a right that both parties were equally disadvantaged’.” Spain also claims that the
infringement of a simple procedural rule such as admitting a document as evidence or
accepting false evidence can constitute a “serious” offence.” Spain cites Teco v.

Guatemala for the position that a “serious breach of a fundamental rule of procedure

cannot be justified in light of a tribunal’s discretion” .”°

In terms of the equality of arms, Spain argues that the Tribunal refused Spain’s right to
present the evidence it considered necessary for the defense of its case and on an equal

footing with the other party.”’

As to the effect of a departure on the outcome, in its Memorial, Spain states that an
applicant has “no obligation to prove that the result of the Arbitration would have been
different...but only the seriousness of the breach’.”® At the Hearing, Spain repeated this
position.” In its Reply, however, Spain recalibrates its position and states that an applicant
would have to show “the clear possibility that...there would have been a difference in some
relevant aspect of the dispute” .*° (emphasis added). Spain then cites with approval Teco v.
Guatemala’s position, and similarly Tulip v. Turkey’s, that it would be enough to show
“whether the tribunal’s compliance with a rule of procedure could potentially have affected

the award”! (emphasis added).
b The NextEra Entities’ Position

The NextEra Entities claim that “Spain has waived the majority of its procedural

complaints, if not all of them, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 27”.

The NextEra Entities argue that the legal threshold to establish a serious violation of a
fundamental rule of procedure is far higher than what Spain asserts. They claim that “[o]n/y
rules of natural justice, which concern the essential fairness of the proceedings, can be
considered fundamental”. They cite the Background Paper’s summary that “it excludes

the Tribunal’s failure to observe ordinary arbitration rules” *4

They contend that an application must (1) identify a fundamental rule of procedure; (b)
show that the Tribunal departed from that fundamental rule; and (c) demonstrate that the

departure was serious.*°

They contend that Spain confuses the meaning of the right to be heard with how the
Tribunal decided on its arguments after hearing them.*° The Claimants claim that Fraport
v. Philippines, Amco v. Indonesia II, Pey Casado v. Chile I and Teco v. Guatemala, the
four examples of annulment on this ground, had “readily distinguishable” violations of

procedure.*’

They cite Churchill Mining v. Indonesia to stress that “the right to be heard is commonly
considered as not absolute, but rather subject to possible limitations, provided that they
are reasonable and proportional to the aim to be achieved”.** They also argue that Spain

denies effect to the adjective “serious”.®°

The NextEra Entities argue that for a departure to be “serious” it must have either “caused
the tribunal to reach a result substantially different from what it would have awarded had
such a rule been observed’(Wena Hotels v. Egypt) or “a material effect on the outcome of
the award”.°° (emphasis in original). They also cite the MINE v. Guinea standard that the

term “serious” “establishes both quantitative and qualitative criteria: the departure must
be substantial and be such as to deprive a party of the benefit or protection which the rule
was intended to provide”.°! They disagree with Spain’s view that a “potential impact”

would suffice and submit that an actual impact is necessary.

G The Committee’s Analysis

98. Art. 52(1)(d) provides for annulment if “there has been a serious departure from a
fundamental rule of procedure”. To meet this ground, an applicant must establish that a
“rule of procedure” that was “fundamental” existed, and that a “departure from” it,
occurred in a “serious” manner. The Committee observes that the ICSID Convention does
not stipulate what rules of procedure are “fundamental”, what is a “departure”, and what
constitutes a “serious” departure. The Committee finds that the meaning of “fiindamental”,
“departure”, and “serious” should be interpreted in accordance with their ordinary

meaning, in their context, and in light of the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention.

99. In terms of what constitutes a “fundamental” rule of procedure, the Committee agrees with
the conclusions reached by Fraport v. Philippines that it should be “restricted to the
principles of natural justice, including the principles that both parties must be heard and
that there must be adequate opportunity for rebuttal’.°” Only rules of natural justice or
rules concerned with the “essential fairness of the proceeding”®’ (CDC v. Seychelles) or
“essential to the integrity and fairness of the arbitral process”®* (Occidental Petroleum v.
Ecuador), for example, would qualify. As Wena Hotels v. Egypt provided, a fundamental
tule of procedure refers to a “set of minimal standards of procedure to be respected as a
matter of international law”.°> The ICSID Convention’s drafting history also provides that

this ground concerns principles of due process that are necessary to ensure a full and fair

hearing “but that it excludes the Tribunal’s failure to observe ordinary arbitration rules” °°

Case 1:19-cv-01618-TSC Document 59-1 Filed 03/25/22 Page 41 of 163

The Committee notes that Spain contends that the fundamental rules of procedure in
dispute consist of the right to be heard, equality of arms, and the rules on the burden of
proof.°’ The Claimants do not challenge that these are fundamental rules of procedure but
stress that “[o]nly rules of natural justice, which concern the essential fairness of the
proceedings, can be considered fundamental”.*

Most of Spain’s claims under this ground focus on the right to be heard. Spain takes a
broader view of the scope of the right to be heard and argues for the view taken by Tulip v.
Turkey that a party should be able to submit “a// the arguments and all the evidence it
[deems] relevant”. The Claimants assert the view of Churchill Mining v. Indonesia that
the “the right to be heard is commonly considered as not absolute, but rather subject to
possible limitations, provided that they are reasonable and proportional to the aim to be

achieved” '°°

The Committee finds that Art. 52(1)(b) only applies to a “serious departure” of a
fundamental rule of procedure that is essential to the fairness and integrity of the
proceeding. Given that only a serious departure of the right to be heard would qualify, the
Committee concludes that the right should be limited by a standard of reasonableness. The
Committee agrees with Churchill Mining v. Indonesia that the right to be heard could be
subject to “reasonable and proportional’ limitations provided that the fairness and

integrity of the proceeding were maintained.

Furthermore, the Committee finds that in accordance with its ordinary meaning, in its
context, and in light of the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention, a serious departure
from a fundamental rule of procedure would not be meaningful unless it is interpreted to
have a material impact on the outcome. Committees have diverged on how seriously

affected an applicant must be. Some committees believe an applicant must demonstrate

that the final decision of the tribunal would have been different but for the breach, whereas

others consider a potential impact would suffice.'°!

104. The NextEra Entities adopt the former view. They argue that, for a departure to be
“serious”, it must have either “caused the tribunal to reach a result substantially different
from what it would have awarded had the rule been observed” or “a material effect on the
outcome of the award”.'°? They cite Wena Hotels v. Egypt for the view that “the violation
of such a rule must have caused the Tribunal to reach a result substantially different from
what it would have awarded had such a rule been observed”.'° They also cite MINE v.

Guinea that held that the term “serious” “establishes both quantitative and qualitative

criteria: the departure must be substantial and be such as to deprive a party of the benefit

or protection which the rule was intended to provide” .'°*

105. Other committees such as Pey Casado v. Chile I and Tulip v. Turkey have adopted Spain’s
position in its Reply, and focused on whether the final decision could have been different
but for the breach.!°° Pey Casado v. Chile I, for example, held that “a distinct possibility
(a ‘chance’) that it may have made a difference on a critical issue” would be sufficient.
Tulip v. Turkey held that “the potential of causing the tribunal to render an award
substantially different from what it actually decided” was all that needed to be shown.!%°
Notably, some committees have gone further and followed Spain’s original position in its
Memorial that a breach alone was sufficient for an award to be annulled. This view suggests
that the effect on the outcome need not be shown as long as the breach was serious enough.

The Committee concurs with the Claimants that Spain’s reference in its Memorial to Tulip

v. Turkey and Pey Casado v. Chile I as support for this view is inapposite but does find

Churchill Mining v. Indonesia serves as an example for this view.'°”

The Committee agrees with Spain’s position in its Reply and the committees that have held
that it is sufficient to demonstrate that the departure had the potential of causing a material
impact on the outcome of the award. Requiring an applicant to establish that a departure
would have had a material impact on the outcome would constitute an unreasonable
burden. A committee does not have to go so far as to determine whether the award would
have been substantially different. At the same time, having an applicant only establish a
breach of the standard without any potential impact would undermine the purpose of the

annulment proceeding.

Finally, in terms of ICSID Arbitration Rule 27, the Committee notes that the Parties agree
that, for an applicant to be entitled to seek annulment based on a serious departure of a
fundamental rule of procedure, the applicant must object in a timely manner at the time the
procedural violation occurred. !°* Failure to make a timely objection would preclude

annulment based on these grounds. '°

AWARD’S FAILURE TO STATE REASONS (ART. 52(1)(e) OF THE ICSID CONVENTION)

Art. 52(1)(e) provides that an award may be annulled if it “fail[s] to state the reasons on
which it is based”. This provision should be considered within the context of Art. 48(3)
which requires that “the award shall deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal,

and shall state the reasons upon which it is based”.

a. Spain’s Position

109. Spain submits that committees have “uniformly established” that Arts. 48(3) and 52(1)(e)
require “at least, that the award allow the reader to ‘follow how the tribunal proceeded

from Point A. to Point B’”.''°

110. Spain cites TECO v. Guatemala for support that an award should be annulled if a tribunal
“ignored the existence in the record of evidence which at least appeared to be relevant to
its analysis”.!!!

111. Spain recites examples of what would qualify as a failure to state reasons. First, Spain
submits that “a failure to deal with ‘every question submitted to the Tribunal” would
qualify. ''* (emphasis added). Spain contends that an award must “address all issues
submitted to the Tribunal by the parties and state the reasons on which it is based
(Article 48) so that, if those reasons are not stated, the award must be annulled under
Article 52(1)(e)”'"> (emphasis added). At the same time, Spain acknowledges that “all
arguments and evidences may not be addressed in an Award”.'"4 It agrees with MINE v.
Guinea that “the lack of response to each of the arguments presented by the parties was
not constitutive of the cause of annulment”.''> Yet, Spain submits that when a tribunal
“fails to rule on relevant issues raised by the parties” this constitutes a failure to state

reasons. |!6

112. Second, in terms of the “adequacy of the reasons’, Spain submits the reasons must be

“comprehensive and consistent”,'"' “sufficiently relevant” (Klockner v. Cameroon)''®, or

“sufficiently pertinent” (Amco v. Indonesia 1).''? An award must “detail the reasoning
which enabled the Tribunal to reach that particular conclusion” .'?° Spain explains that an
award would fail to state reasons if the reasons are “insufficient or inadequate” (Soufraki
v. The United Arab Emirates)'*' or “so inadequate that the coherence of the reasoning is
seriously affected” (Mitchell v. The Democratic Republic of Congo)!”*.

113. Third, the reasons must not be “frivolous” or “contradictory’.' Spain submits that

2124

reasoning that is “inconsistent or contradictory”'** or “seriously contradictory” (Mitchell

v. The Democratic Republic of Congo)'*> would be annullable. It cites MINE v. Guinea
and Amco v. Indonesia I as examples of annulment because the tribunal “contradicted

itself”!

114. Finally, Spain argues that if a tribunal “does not treat a specific question referred to it” or
“fails to cover certain relevant proof or evidence” for its determination it would justify

annulment.'27

115. Spain stresses the finding in K/éckner v. Cameroon that “it is not for the Committee to
imagine what might or should have been the arbitrators' reasons, any more than it should
substitute ‘correct’ reasons for possibly ‘incorrect’ reasons, or deal ‘ex post facto’ with

questions submitted to the Tribunal which the Award left unanswered” .'?8

116. Spain also cites MINE v. Guinea regarding the “relevance” of the questions that did not

have reasons and suggests that it was necessary that the answer to those questions “might

b The NextEra Entities’ Position

117. As provided in response to Annulment Ground (e) in Section V.D(1), infra, the Claimants
submit that under ICSID Arbitration Rule 27 the Applicant waived its objections on these
grounds.'*! The NextEra Entities argue that Spain has waived its right to seek annulment
because it became aware of the issue when it received the Tribunal’s Decision but failed to
object within the 80 days since the Award was rendered. Spain’s waiver is compounded

because it did not request a supplementary decision on, or rectification of, the Award.'**

118. The NextEra Entities emphasize the high threshold that must be met for annulment for
failure to state reasons. '** First, Art. 52(1)(e) only requires a tribunal to address the
questions that are “essential” or “necessary” to its award.'*4 A tribunal does not have to
deal with every question or argument submitted to it.'*> The Claimants criticize the

Applicant’s failure to address the difference between Art. 48(3) and Art. 52(1)(e) and how

“failure to deal with every question submitted to a Tribunal” is not a basis for annulment. !*°

Citing MINE v. Guinea, the Claimants argue that the sole exception is where the question

is so “essential” the failure to deal with it would “render ] the award ‘unintelligible”.!°"”

The Claimants claim that Spain misquoted Sempra v. Argentina for the view that

“comprehensive” reasoning is needed because the actual wording is that awards should be

“reasonably comprehensible and consistent” .'*

Along similar lines, the Claimants submit a tribunal is not required to address every piece
of evidence. Citing Tza Yap Shum v. Peru, they argue that a tribunal does not have to
“explain [...] itself in respect of each piece of evidence adduced by either party which is
not outcome determinative”.'*° The Claimants submit that “even for issues that are
outcome-determinative”, a tribunal does not have to “traverse every single argument or

piece of evidence”.'*

Second, Art. 52(1)(e) does not permit a review of the merits of a tribunal’s decision. As
provided by Tidewater v. Venezuela, a committee “must not re-argue the merits of the

case”.'41

Third, Art. 52(1)(e) does not involve an inquiry into the sufficiency or adequacy of a
tribunal’s reasons but only the existence of reasons. '4* The Claimants submit that
“{ajnnulment committees have widely rejected the claim that Art. 52(1)(e) allows an
inquiry into the adequacy or sufficiency of a tribunal’s reasons” .'* The Claimants disagree
with Spain and claim Spain mis-cites Mitchell v. The Democratic Republic of Congo, which
endorsed the MINE vy. Guinea test when it stated “the adequacy of the reasoning is not an

appropriate standard of review” .'#*

Fourth, tribunals are given considerable discretion as to how they provide their reasons,

both expressly and implicitly, and they may do so succinctly.'4> As summarized by the

Wena Hotels v. Egypt committee: “[t]he Tribunal’s reasons may be implicit in the
considerations and conclusions contained in the award, provided they can be reasonably
be inferred from the terms used in the decision”.'*° They also point out that a committee
may “explain or clarify” a tribunal’s reasons. '4” Contrary to Spain’s assertions, the
NextEra Entities argue that Spain’s own authorities provide that tribunals: (i) can state their
reasons without reference to the underlying factual or legal bases of such reasons; and (ii)
are not required to document reasons with elaborate citations to decisions and exhibits. '4*
The Claimants highlight that tribunals are given even greater discretion as to their statement

of reasons on quantum.

123. Fifth, Art. 52(1)(e) sets a high threshold for proving contradictory reasons and awards are
presumed not to contain them.'*? They cite Daimler v. Argentina for the position that a
committee should, “to the extent possible and considering each case, prefer an
interpretation which confirms an award’s consistency as opposed to its alleged inner
contradictions”.'°° They also cite Standard Chartered v. Tanzania Electric for the view

that contradictory reasons must “completely cancel each other out, leaving the Award with

a total absence of reasons”.'>!

124. The Claimants also invoke Gambrinus v. Venezuela to point out that a “Tribunal cannot be
faulted in not addressing [an issue] when it was not raised specifically as an issue or argued
in extensor [sic] by the Applicant before the Tribunal”.!*? The Claimants raise this point

due to the “extensive new merits and jurisdictional arguments contained in Spain’s Reply

on Annulment and the Reply Report of Professor Gosalbo” .‘*>

125. Finally, the Claimants challenge Spain’s assertion that a tribunal’s summation of the
parties’ arguments cannot be considered to be part of the tribunal’s reasoning. The
Claimants assert that awards should be read as a whole.'** As support, they invoke
Continental v. Argentina for the position that “in determining whether the reasons given
for a conclusion on a particular question are sufficient, it is necessary not to look in
isolation at the particular paragraphs of the award dealing specifically with that question.

Those paragraphs must always be read together with the award as a whole”.'>°

G The Committee’s Analysis

126. Art. 52(1)(e) provides for annulment if an award fails to state the reasons on which it is

based. Unlike other grounds, Art. 52(1)(e) does not include any limiting terms such as

“manifest”, “serious”, or “fundamental”. The Committee agrees with the Claimants that
Art. 52(1)(e) should be interpreted within the context of Art. 48(3). While Art. 48(3)
requires that a tribunal should answer “every question submitted’, a failure to do so was
specifically not included as a basis for annulment in Art. 52(1)(e).'*° A tribunal’s failure
to address all questions submitted to it by the parties is not in itself a basis for annulment.
As Schreuer explains, “[t]he duty to state reasons refers only to a minimum requirement.

It does not call for tribunals to strain every sinew in an attempt to convince the losing party

that the decision was the right one”.!>7

127. Both Parties cite MINE v. Guinea to support their positions on Art. 52(1)(e) with Spain

calling it “one of the most followed interpretations” and the NextEra Entities, one that has

been “/argely settled”.'** The Parties agree that under Art. 52(1)(e) an award must allow a
reader to “follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to Point B., and eventually to
its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or law. This minimum requirement is in
particular not satisfied by either contradictory or frivolous reasons”.'? MINE v. Guinea’s
pronouncement on the meaning of Art. 52(1)(e) is well-established, although the Parties

differ in its application.

One issue concerns whether the correctness, persuasiveness, or adequacy of an award’s
reasoning should be considered. The Committee notes the admonishment by Schreuer that
Art. 52(1)(e) “is most likely to blend into an examination of the award’s substantive
correctness and hence to cross the border between annulment and appeal’.' The
Committee confirms that its mandate requires it must not engage in an appeal but only
assess whether to annul within the limits prescribed under Art. 52(1). The Committee finds
that it must not engage in an assessment of the “correctness” of the Tribunal’s reasoning
or whether it was “appropriate or convincing”. The Committee agrees with Vivendi v.
Argentina I that “[p]rovided that the reasons given by a tribunal can be followed and relate
to the issues that were before the tribunal, their correctness is beside the point in terms of
Article 52(1)(e)”.'°! Along similar lines, the Committee agrees with the analysis of CEAC
v. Montenegro that a committee is “not empowered to reconsider whether the Tribunal’s

reasons were appropriate or convincing”.

Echoing MINE v. Guinea, CEAC v. Montenegro summarizes that “[t]he test is simply
whether the Tribunal was guilty of a failure to state its reasons in such a way that there is
a lack of expressed rationale or that the reasoning cannot be followed”.' The failure to
state reasons must leave the decision on a particular point essentially lacking in any

expressed rationale or the reasoning could not be followed. Second, that point must itself

be necessary to the tribunal’s decision. As long as there is some rationale, the focus of the

analysis is whether the reasoning could be “followed”.

In terms of adequacy of the reasoning, the Committee does not agree with Spain’s assertion
that “the mere expression in the Decision or the Award of an opinion is not an expression
of reasoning if it does not detail the reasoning which enabled the Tribunal to reach that
particular conclusion” and “the mere expression of reasons is not sufficient to validate the
Award...if they are not adequate”.'® Art. 52(1)(e) does not require a committee to
determine if a tribunal “derail[ed] the reasoning which enabled [it] to reach [a] particular
conclusion”. Instead, as found above, the Committee finds that it must not venture into
whether a tribunal “detailed” its reasoning and whether it was “adequate...to reach [a]
particular conclusion”. Should a committee assess the adequacy or completeness of the

reasoning it should only do so to determine if the reasoning could be “followed”.

Both Parties agree that “contradictory’ or “frivolous” reasons may, in certain
circumstances, give rise to a potential ground for annulment. '“ The Committee agrees with
both Parties that contradictory reasons exist when they cancel each other out. '°> The
Committee concurs with Vivendi v. Argentina I, that a committee should be “careful not to
discern contradiction when what is actually expressed in a tribunal's reasons could more

Vv. GROUNDS FOR ANNULMENT

A. TRIBUNAL’S DECISION CONCERNING ITS JURISDICTION RATIONE PERSONAE

qd) Manifest Excess of Powers and Failure to State Reasons to Exercise
Jurisdiction: The NextEra Entities’ Nationality and Status as Investor (Art.
52(1)(b) and Art. 52(1)(e)) (Annulment Grounds (a) and (b))

a. Spain’s Position

133. Spain submits that the Tribunal committed a manifest excess of powers by upholding
jurisdiction ratione personae given the Claimants’ nationality and lack of status as an

“Investor” under the ECT.
134. Spain starts by explaining the following:

The ECT does not give further criteria as to what is to be understood
as the ‘enterprise’ making the investment in accordance with Article
1(7). The determination of the ECT is to refer to the law of the
contracting party. It was clearly explained in the Arbitration that an
‘enterprise’ could only be considered as such for the purposes of the
ECT if under the law applicable to that entity it is qualified as
‘enterprise’. !”°

Case 1:19-cv-01618-TSC Document 59-1 Filed 03/25/22 Page 53 of 163

Spain claims that the Tribunal erred in its analysis in connection with the existence of an
“Investor” under the ECT because it merely resorted to case law, which is not a source of
international law, and did not look at the factual circumstances.'7! Under the ECT, to
analyze whether a company can be qualified as an “Jnvestor’”, it was necessary to analyze
the law of the State concerned. Spain recalls that the ECT refers to the legislation of the
State concerned to determine the existence or inexistence of an enterprise that can qualify
as an “Jnvestor” under the treaty.'’? The Tribunal did not conduct such an analysis of Dutch
or EU legislation. According to Spain, based on the ECT and following the criteria for
interpretation stated in the Vienna Convention, the NextEra Entities did not qualify under
Dutch law as an enterprise or another legally constituted organization for the purpose of

the ECT.'7

Spain rebuts the NextEra Entities’ point that the Tribunal interpreted Art. 1(7) consistently
with dozens of other ECT tribunals by arguing that: (i) ECT awards “are not a source of
international law’’; (ii) “it is perfectly feasible that many tribunals have been mistaken on
the same point before”; and (iii) “previous decisions are not comparable to the case. The

case here is different, since the Tribunal does not apply the ECT directly” .‘7*

On similar grounds, Spain adds that the Award failed to state reasons in finding jurisdiction
ratione personae based on the nationality of the NextEra Entities and their status as
investors under the ECT. '7> Spain claims it provided evidence of Florida Power and Light’s
(“FPL”) control and direction of the Claimants and the implications of this under the
applicable Dutch and EU legislation. Yet, the Tribunal ruled on the matter without giving
any reasons other than relying on arguments from other awards. It disregarded the evidence

and did not justify why the evidence submitted by the Parties led to its judgment.!7°

Case 1:19-cv-01618-TSC Document 59-1 Filed 03/25/22 Page 54 of 163

According to Spain, the Tribunal dismissed the claims under Art. 1(7) of the ECT without

analyzing the applicable Dutch or EU law and without analyzing a “single piece of
evidence”.'"" The Tribunal “totally and absolutely dispense[d] with any explanation of why

it understands that there is an investor” under the ECT.'8

Spain submits the Award is “obviously contradictory, when it mentions the CVDT [Vienna
Convention] but does not apply the ordinary meaning of the ECT and consequently applies
the law applicable in the Netherlands”.'”° Alternatively, the Award should be annulled for
“failure to apply EU law to a company formally incorporated in the EU to determine its

nationality and therefore to apply the appropriate law” .'®°

b The NextEra Entities’ Position

The NextEra Entities start by claiming that Spain waived its argument on this ground
because after it reviewed the Decision, it knew, or should have known, of its objection that
the Tribunal had failed to deal with all of Spain’s arguments about the existence of an
investment. Spain did not promptly object, and it also failed to apply to the Tribunal to
rectify or supplement this aspect of its Decision under Art. 49(2) of the ICSID
Convention.'*! They cite Schreuer to contend that jurisdictional objections must be raised

as soon as they are known and if these are not raised, they are deemed to be waived. '**

The NextEra Entities refer to their Observations on the EC’s Amicus Brief of 23 April

2020, where they explained that:

be manifest; and (d) where ‘reasonable minds’ disagree as to
jurisdiction, the ‘manifest’ requirement is not fulfilled.'**

The NextEra Entities contend that it is not a function of an ad hoc committee in an

annulment proceeding to substitute its own view of the law and its own appreciation of the

facts for those of the tribunal.'**
The NextEra Entities explain as follows:

...the ECT contains broad definitions of Investor’ (based on a place
of incorporation test)....Unsurprisingly, the Tribunal found that the
Claimants satisfied [the] definition [ ] because they were companies
incorporated in the Netherlands, which held direct and indirect
equity interests in NEE Espana (the Spanish holding company that,
in turn, owned the Spanish project companies).'**

  

The Claimants claim that dozens of ECT tribunals have interpreted Art. 1(7) of the ECT in
accordance with its ordinary meaning with the result that it covers holding companies
incorporated in a relevant State just as the Tribunal did. Where many other tribunals have

adopted the same interpretation, any alleged excess of powers cannot be manifest. !*°

The NextEra Entities conclude that there was no manifest excess of powers as the
Tribunal’s interpretation was plainly tenable because it applied the express language of the

ECT to undisputed facts such as NextEra Entities’ place of incorporation. '*”

Similarly, they claim that there was no failure to state reasons because reasoning was
provided and it could be followed. The Decision identified the relevant treaty text in
Art. 1(7) of the ECT and applied it to the fact that the Claimants were incorporated in the
Netherlands and the Claimants owned the shareholding in NEE Espajia.'** The Tribunal
was not required to address all of the Spain’s arguments, particularly irrelevant ones, and

was entitled to state its reasons succinctly. The Tribunal explained why it rejected

based on the Vienna Convention. !*°

The Claimants contend the Decision’s reasoning was not contradictory. Spain’s sole basis
for claiming a contradiction in paragraph 205 of the Decision was that since there was no
“Investment” there was no “Investor”. The Claimants argue the reasoning within the
paragraph “fit [s] /ogically together”.'°° Each aspect of the Tribunal’s reasoning was plain

B11
G The Committee’s Analysis

The Committee must determine whether the Tribunal’s interpretation and application of
Art. 1(7) of the ECT to uphold jurisdiction ratione personae constitute a manifest excess

of powers and whether the Award fails to state the reasons on which it is based.

First, the Committee examines the Tribunal’s exercise of its powers to determine whether
it had jurisdiction ratione personae. The Tribunal noted that the ECT was a treaty and
should be interpreted based on the Vienna Convention and its terms should be given their
ordinary meaning in their context, and in light of the object and purpose of the treaty. The
Tribunal first quoted the definition of “Jnvestor” under Art. 1(7)(a)(ii) that provided “a
company or other organisation organised in accordance with the law applicable within

that Contracting Party”.

The Tribunal found that the NextEra Entities qualified as a “company or other
organisation” under Art. 1(7). The Committee finds that the Tribunal’s application of the
plain wording of Art. 1(7)(a)(ii) that “a company or other organisation” would include
holding companies and indirect equity interests was not untenable or implausible as a

matter of law.

The Tribunal proceeded to declare that it was “not disputed that Claimants, NextEra Global
and NextEra Spain are incorporated in accordance with the law of the Netherlands”.'**
The Tribunal found that the NextEra Entities satisfied the second component of the
definition of “Jnvestor” under the ECT. The Tribunal based this decision on the fact that
the Claimants were incorporated in the Netherlands and owned the subsidiary NEE Espaiia,
the Spanish holding company that owned the Spanish project companies. The incorporation
and ownership are not contested.'*? The Committee finds that the Tribunal analyzed the
status of the Claimants under Dutch law and does not agree with Spain that the Tribunal
“dispensed with” an analysis of the applicable law. The Tribunal identified the conditions
for ratione personae by establishing that the dispute involved a Contracting State and a
national of another Contracting State. The Committee therefore finds that the Tribunal’s
interpretation and application of Art. 1(7) to the Claimants were tenable and plausible as a
matter of law and could not be considered a manifest excess of powers. The Tribunal’s
decision does not fall under the realm of being a “ ‘gross and egregious’ misapplication of
law” that a “reasonable person could not accept” and does not reach the level of being a

“non-application of the proper law”!

The Committee observes that, as noted by the Tribunal itself, other tribunals applying the
ECT have reached the same conclusions on jurisdiction ratione personae as the Tribunal
in interpreting Art. 1(7).!°> As noted by the NextEra Entities, a “dozens of ECT tribunals”
have interpreted Art. 1(7) in accordance with its ordinary meaning and held that they
include “holding companies incorporated in a relevant State, and indirect equity
interests”.'°° Spain has not challenged this fact or cited any decisions disputing this
argument.!*’ While the decisions of other tribunals are not binding, they do shed light on

whether a view is tenable. At a minimum, the fact that other tribunals have arrived at the

same conclusion supports the position that the Tribunal’s findings were not only

“susceptible of argument ‘one way or the other’” but also “tenable as a matter of law”.

This also confirms that the Tribunal’s decision on jurisdiction ratione personae and the

applicable law could not constitute an excess of powers that was “plain”, “clear”,

“obvious”, “flagrant”, “evident” or “easily understood or recognized by the mind”.

Second, on a similar basis, the Committee finds that Spain has not demonstrated that the
Award failed to state reasons based on the NextEra Entities’ nationality and jurisdiction
ratione personae. The Tribunal considered Spain’s argument that pure holding companies
did not comply with Art. 1(7) and that it had to be interpreted on the basis of a particular
meaning under EU or Netherlands law. '!°* The Tribunal then applied the rules of
interpretation according to Art. 31(1) of the Vienna Convention to find that the “Claimants
are companies that are organized under the law of the Netherlands” and were thus
“investors” under Art. 1(7). The Committee concludes that the Tribunal’s decision on the
Claimant’s status as investors under Art. 1(7) of the ECT did not lack a rationale and that
its reasoning could be followed. The Award did not fail to state reasons concerning its

finding that the Claimants qualified as investors.

The Committee concludes that the Tribunal interpreted and applied Art. 1(7) of the ECT
based on its plain meaning to find jurisdiction ratione personae. This was not untenable or
implausible and overall the reasons could be followed. Therefore, the Tribunal did not

manifestly exceed its powers and the Award did not fail to provide reasons.

TRIBUNAL’S DECISION CONCERNING ITS JURISDICTION RATIONE MATERIAE

qd) Manifest Excess of Powers to Exercise Jurisdiction and Failure to State
Reasons: Whether a Protected Investment and Direct Relationship Existed
between the Parties (Art. 52(1)(b) and Art. 52(1)(e))(Annulment Grounds (a)
and (b))

a. Spain’s Position

Spain considers that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers as it lacked jurisdiction
to hear the present case, because there was neither an investment nor a direct relationship
between the NextEra Entities and the events that gave rise to the alleged legitimate

expectation.

Relying on Jsolux v. Spain, Spain states that according to the ECT an investment requires
the existence of three elements: (i) contribution of funds; (ii) receipt of benefits; and (iii)
assumption of risk.!°? The text of Art. 1(6) of the ECT should be read to require a “real

and effective economic investment, in an objective sense”?

Spain argues that the NextEra Entities did not contribute any funds as all economic

obligations and risks were assumed by the American company FPL””!.

Referring to the NextEra Entities, Spain explains that “[t]hese Claimants acted as a mere
conduit through which funds flow from the United States to Spain, without providing any

economic value”?

As provided with respect to Art. 1(7), Spain rebuts the NextEra Entities’ point that the
Tribunal interpreted Art. 1(6) consistently with dozens of other ECT tribunals by providing
that: (i) ECT awards “are not a source of international law’; (ii) “it is perfectly feasible

that many tribunals have been mistaken on the same point before”; and (iti) “previous

decisions are not comparable to the case. The case here is different, since the Tribunal

does not apply the ECT directly”?

Spain claims on similar grounds that the Award failed to state reasons for finding
jurisdiction ratione materiae based on the NextEra Entities’ investment. According to
Spain, the Award did not provide reasons as to why the NextEra Entities’ investment
qualified as a protected investment and “totally and absolutely dispenses with any
explanation of why it understands that there is an investment”.?™ Spain argues that the
Tribunal did not address its argument that since the Claimants are not “/nvestors” within
the meaning of Article 1(7) of the ECT, then they cannot have an “/nvestment” within the

meaning of Article 1 (6) of the ECT.

Spain contends the Tribunal ruled on the matter without giving any reasons, and simply
relied on arguments from other awards. It disregarded the evidence and did not justify why
the evidence submitted by the Parties led to its judgment.?°> Spain also submits that the
Award is “obviously contradictory, when it mentions the CVDT [Vienna Convention] but
does not apply the ordinary meaning of the ECT and consequently applies the law

applicable in the Netherlands” .?°°

Spain then invokes Art. 25 of the ICSID Convention and Art 26 (1) of the ECT. Spain
asserts that there was no direct relationship between the NextEra Entities and Spain that
could justify any legitimate expectation. The letters that the Claimants rely upon for their
claim of damages were addressed to an American entity.7°” Spain concludes by saying that
“there is not a dispute directly arising from expectations that the Kingdom of Spain would
have generated in the Claimants. And the direct relationship required by the treaties is

therefore non-existent” .?°

Finally, Spain claims the Award wrongly concludes that it waived its objections under
Art. 1(6). Spain submits that the Tribunal no longer dealt with Spain’s claims as to why
there was no investment under the Salini test just because it determined that Spain
recognized that the Claimants owned the investment.” Spain also denies that the Salini
arguments were raised for the first time and argues that the entire rationale was raised in

the underlying arbitration.?!”
b The NextEra Entities’ Position

The NextEra Entities again contend that Spain’s argument regarding the existence of an
investment has been waived because Spain did not promptly object and also failed to apply
to the Tribunal to rectify or supplement this aspect of the Decision under Art. 49(2) of the
ICSID Convention.”!! They cite Schreuer to contend that jurisdictional objections must be
raised as soon as they are known and if these are not raised, they are deemed to be

waived.?!?

The NextEra Entities explain that Spain cannot relitigate the existence of an investment by
introducing new arguments not raised in the arbitration, such as the Salini test.?!> They
explain that doing so would breach the well-established principle that an annulment
proceeding is not an appeal or a “challenge to the correctness” and is not a forum to expand
a party’s original arguments.7!4* According to the Claimants, other than claiming that
without an “Jnvestor” under Art. 1(7) there could be no “investment”, Spain pursued no

other arguments concerning the requirements of Art. 1(6).7!°

The Tribunal found that the Claimants satisfied the definition of investment because the
companies incorporated in the Netherlands held direct and indirect equity interests in NEE

Espaiia, the Spanish holding company that owned the Spanish project companies. The ECT

contains broad definitions of “/nvestment” that expressly extend to investments held both

directly and indirectly.

The Claimants cite that dozens of ECT tribunals have interpreted Art. 1(6) in accordance
with its ordinary meaning with the result that they cover holding companies and indirect
equity interests just as the Tribunal did. Where many other tribunals have adopted the same

interpretation, any alleged excess of powers cannot be manifest.7!®

In addition, the NextEra Entities contend that Spain’s argument regarding the need for a
direct relationship between the investor and the State confuses the requirements under
Art. 1(6) of the ECT and Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. First, they claim that Spain
never raised this argument in the arbitration. Second, they claim that Art. 25(1) does not
require a direct relationship between the parties for the purposes of legitimate expectations

but only a direct relationship between the investment and the dispute.!”

The Tribunal did not fail to state reasons because each aspect of the Tribunal’s reasoning
is plain and can be followed by any reasonable reader of the Decision from Point A to

Point B.
G The Committee’s Analysis

Art. 1(6)(b) of the ECT provides that an “Jnvestment” means “every kind of asset, owned
or controlled directly or indirectly by an Investor” and includes “a company or business
enterprise”. The Committee examines the Tribunal’s exercise of its powers to determine it
had jurisdiction ratione materiae based on Art. 1(6) and whether the Award fails to state

the reasons on which it is based.

First, the Tribunal addressed Spain’s argument that an investor had to own and control the
assets on which the investment was based and found that Spain conceded that the
Claimant’s owned the Spanish companies. The Tribunal then considered Spain’s next

argument that since the Claimants were not “‘Investors’ within the meaning of Art. 1(7)”

216 Counter-Memorial, § 101.
217 Counter-Memorial, § 116; Rejoinder, § 98.

49

Case 1:19-cv-01618-TSC Document 59-1 Filed 03/25/22 Page 63 of 163

they consequently could not have an “‘/nvestment’ within the meaning of Art. 1(6)”.7'* The
Tribunal concluded that since the Claimants were determined to be “Jnvestors” under
Art. 1(7), Spain’s related argument under Art. 1(6) failed. The Committee finds that the
Tribunal’s reasoning concerning whether an investment existed pursuant to Art. 1(6) was
based on the dismissal of Spain’s argument concerning Art. 1(7). In the view of the
Committee, the Tribunal considered that once Spain’s argument based on Art. 1(7) was
dismissed, Spain’s basis to challenge the existence of an investment under Art. 1(6) was
undermined. The Committee notes that this constituted Spain’s core objection concerning

Art. 1(6).

172. As for the Salini test, Spain does not dispute that it did not specifically cite the Salini v.
Morocco case in the underlying arbitration. At the same time, the Claimants recognize that
Spain did raise an argument based on the principles outlined in the Sa/ini test through the
Isolux v. Spain case.?'° Nevertheless, the Committee concludes that whether the Salini test
should have been applied calls for an assessment of the correctness of the decision and

need not be considered in an application under Art. 52(1)(b) or (e).

173. The Committee finds that the Tribunal interpreted and applied the plain wording of
Art. 1(6)(b) to find a legal dispute arising directly out of an investment based on the
NextEra Entities ownership. This conclusion was tenable and cannot be considered a
manifest excess of powers. Whether Art. 1(6)(b) requires an investment to be a “real and
effective economic investment, in an objective sense” or a “direct” relationship concerns
the correct interpretation and relates to an alleged misapplication of the law beyond the
subject of review under Art. 52(1)(b). The Tribunal’s decision does not fall under the realm
of being a “ ‘gross and egregious’ misapplication of law” to reach the level of being a “non-

application of the proper law”.??°

174. Again, the Committee observes that, as noted by the Tribunal itself, other tribunals

applying the ECT have reached the same conclusions on jurisdiction ratione materiae as

the Tribunal in interpreting Art. 1(6).??! As noted by the NextEra Entities, “dozens of ECT
tribunals” have interpreted the wording of Art. 1(6) in accordance with its ordinary
meaning and held that it includes “holding companies incorporated in a relevant State, and
indirect equity interests”.°?> Spain has not challenged this fact or cited any decisions
disputing this argument.??? The decisions of other tribunals are not binding but do shed
light on whether a view is tenable. At a minimum, the fact that other tribunals have made
such a decision supports the position that the Tribunal’s findings were not only “susceptible

of argument ‘one way or the other’” but also “tenable as a matter of law’. This also
confirms that the Tribunal’s decision on jurisdiction ratione materiae and the applicable
law could not be deemed an excess of powers that was “plain”, “clear”, “obvious”,

“flagrant”, “evident” or “easily understood or recognized by the mind”.

On a similar basis, the Committee also finds that Spain has not demonstrated that the
Tribunal failed to state reasons when finding it had jurisdiction ratione materiae based on
the existence of a protected investment under the ECT. The Tribunal first addressed Spain’s
argument regarding whether an investor must own and control the assets on which the
investment was based. The Tribunal found that Spain conceded that the Claimants owned
the Spanish companies. According to the Tribunal, Spain argued that since the Claimants
were not investors under Art. 1(7) they consequently could not have an investment under
Art. 1(6).??4 The Tribunal concluded that since the Claimants were determined to be
investors under Art. 1(7), Spain’s related argument under Art. 1(6) failed. The Committee
notes that this was the core of Spain’s argument concerning Art. 1(6). A tribunal’s reasons
may be stated “succinctly” and adequacy and comprehensibility are not the test under Art.
52(1)(e). The Award did not lack a rationale in finding that the Claimant’s investment met

Art. 1(6) of the ECT.

The Committee finds the Tribunal’s reasoning concerning whether an investment existed
under Art. 1(6) of the ECT focused on rebutting Spain’s argument based on Art. 1(7). In
the view of the Committee, the Tribunal considered that once Spain’s argument based on
Art. 1(7) was dismissed, Spain’s basis to challenge the existence of an investment under

Art. 1(6) was undermined.

The Committee also agrees with the Claimants that the Applicant confuses the
requirements under Art. 1(6) of the ECT and Art. 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. The plain
wording of the Art. 25(1) provides that it does not require a direct relationship between the
parties for the purposes of legitimate expectations but only a direct relationship between

the investment and the dispute.

The Committee concludes that the Applicant has not established that the Tribunal
manifestly exceed its powers or that the Award failed to state the reasons when it

determined it had jurisdiction ratione materiae based on Att. 1(6) of the ECT.

TRIBUNAL’S DECISION CONCERNING ITS JURISDICTION RATIONE VOLUNTATIS

qd) Manifest Excess of Powers to Exercise Jurisdiction and Failure to State
Reasons: Denial of Benefits under Art. 17 of the ECT. (Art. 52(1)(b) and (e))
(Annulment Grounds (c) and (d))

a. Spain’s Position

Referring to the denial of benefit clause of Art. 17 of the ECT, Spain contends that the
Tribunal exceeded its powers when rejecting Spain’s decision to deny benefits to the
NextEra Entities based on a non-existent time requirement.” The Tribunal’s interpretation
created a new requirement not provided for in Art. 17, and violated the criteria for
interpretation of the Vienna Convention. Spain’s right of defense was infringed contrary to
general principles of law when it was deprived of the denial of benefits clause under

Art. 17.

Case 1:19-cv-01618-TSC Document 59-1 Filed 03/25/22 Page 66 of 163

Spain contends that the Tribunal “violated a general principle of international law and
violated the right of defense of the accused of an international wrong and gave an

interpretation of Article 17 favourable to the accuser and not to the accused” .?*

In furtherance of its argument, Spain states that Art. 17 “does not set time limits on the
exercise of this right and may not be freely created by arbitral [t]ribunals without support

in the ECT or in the interpretation thereof under the Vienna Convention” .?2”

The Tribunal exceeded its power by relying on decisions of “international courts”, which
are not a source of international law according to Article 38 of the Statute of the
International Court of Justice (“ICJ”). Spain argues that the Tribunal created international
law by relying upon “decisions of international courts” to create new requirements under

Art. 17.

Referring to the “denial of benefit” clause of Art. 17 of the ECT, Spain also contends that
the Award fails to state the reasons “why it [did] not accept the denial of benefits provided
for in Article 17 of the ECT and impose[d] requirements for such refusal not set out in

Article 17 of the ECT”.
b The NextEra Entities’ Position

The NextEra Entities argue that Spain waived its right to object to the Award on this ground

because six months passed since the Tribunal issued its Decision.””?

In addition, the Claimants explain that “numerous ECT tribunals had found that a State
cannot deny the benefits of the ECT after the investment had been made. Acknowledging
the two authorities submitted by Spain (Ulysseas and Guaracachi - neither of which was

decided under the ECT), the Tribunal noted the ‘controversy’ surrounding this question

and stated that ‘recent cases have suggested that the right must be exercised no later than

the time the benefits are claimed’””.?°°

The NextEra Entities assert that the Tribunal held that Spain’s government knew that it
was dealing with an American corporation but that the investment was going to be operated
through a Dutch company and it provided assurances to the NextEra Entities without any

suggestions that it would invoke Art. 17(1) of the ECT.??!

The NextEra Entities highlight that even after they communicated to Spain their
willingness to enforce their rights under the ECT through arbitration, Spain did not invoke

Art. 17(1) of the ECT.2*2

The NextEra Entities recall that the Tribunal held that Spain’s “conduct can only be viewed
as acquiescence in Claimants’ assertion of ECT rights precluding Respondent from later
seeking to assert a right to deny benefits when it filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction on 9

September 2015”?

The NextEra Entities conclude that the Tribunal’s reasoning was plainly tenable and its
decision did not manifestly exceed its powers in rejecting Spain’s Art. 17 defense.?*4 To
them, Spain impermissibly raises an issue regarding the correctness of the interpretation of
the ECT. They also argue that the Award did not fail to state reasons because it provided

reasoning that could be followed.
G The Committee’s Analysis

Art. 17 of the ECT provides that “[e]ach Contracting Party reserves the right to deny the
advantages of this Part to: (1) a legal entity if citizens or nationals of a third state own or
control such entity and if that entity has no substantial business activities in the Area of the

Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers to determine it had jurisdiction ratione voluntatis
despite Spain’s objection under Art. 17 and whether the Award stated the reasons on which

it is based.

191. First, the Committee notes that the Tribunal rejected Spain’s denial of benefits defense
under Art. 17 of the ECT. The Tribunal considered the objection was three years too late
such that Spain had acquiesced to the Claimants’ assertion of rights under the ECT.?*> The
Tribunal reached its decision based upon the submissions of both Parties and its assessment
of the evidence. It focused on the timeline of Spain’s knowledge that the Claimants were
controlled by citizens or nationals of a third State and when it could have potentially
asserted an objection under the ECT. The Committee notes that the Tribunal then cites
Khan Resources v. Mongolia concerning what would constitute a “good faith
interpretation” of Art. 17. The Tribunal concluded that if a State could deny an investor’s
benefits under the Art. 17 of ECT after luring an investor into an investment, this would

not be a “good faith exercise of its rights”.?°°

192. The Committee finds that the Tribunal’s interpretation and application of Art. 17 of the
ECT and rejection of Spain’s denial of benefits defense based on the general concept of
good faith were tenable as a matter of law. The Committee does not agree that the Tribunal
created international law, imposed a new requirement, or violated a general principle of
international law or Spain’s right of defense. The Tribunal did not exceed its powers in
reaching this decision, let alone in a manifest manner. The Tribunal’s interpretation of
Art. 17 could also not be considered a non-application of the law or a misapplication of the

law.

193. The Committee observes that various ICSID tribunals applying the ECT reached the same
conclusions as the Tribunal in rejecting a denial of benefits defense after an investment
was made.”*’ While other tribunal decisions are not binding, the fact that so many other

tribunals made the same decision supports the position that the Tribunal’s decision was not

only “susceptible of argument ‘one way or the other’” but also “tenable as a matter of
law”.”>8 This further confirms that the Tribunal’s decision to reject Spain’s denial of

benefits defense was not a manifest excess of powers.

194. Next, the Committee finds that the Tribunal did not fail to state reasons concerning the
Applicant’s objections under Art. 17. The Tribunal first dealt with the question whether
the Claimants were owned and controlled by the citizens or nationals of a third State and
concluded that the first criterion under Art. 17(1) was met because the “w/timate principal
entity” that controlled them was an “American company”.*° Second, the Tribunal
considered whether the Claimants had substantial business activities in the Netherlands but
concluded it was unnecessary to determine based on the subsequent denial of benefits
decision.” Third, the Tribunal reviewed when Spain became aware that the investment
was made through a Dutch company controlled by an American corporation and whether
the Applicant exercised a denial of benefits under Art. 17(1) in a timely fashion.*4! The
Committee finds that the Tribunal did explain why it did not accept Spain’s denial of

benefits objection under Art. 17 and no grounds for annulment exist under Art. 52(1)(e).

195. Thus, in view of the above, the Committee concludes that the Tribunal did not manifestly
exceed its powers and did not fail to state reasons when it determined it had jurisdiction

ratione voluntatis.

SPAIN’S ALLEGATIONS AS TO MANIFEST EXCESS OF POWERS

qd) Manifest Excess of Powers by Upholding Jurisdiction despite Spain’s Installed
Capacity and “Unclean Hands” Objection (Art. 52(1)(b) (Annulment
Ground (e))

a. Spain’s Position

Spain argues that the NextEra Entities “consciously made misrepresentations” in
connection with the installed capacity of its investment to benefit from a system of
subsidies to which they would not have been entitled having “acted in bad faith,

fraudulently or unlawfully”?

In support of its position, Spain recalls what the tribunal held in Plama Consortium Limited

v. Bulgaria:

... The Tribunal is of the view that granting the ECT’s protections to

Claimant’s investment would be contrary to the principle nemo

auditur propriam turpitudinem allegans invoked above. It would also

be contrary to the basic notion of international-public policy - that

a contract obtained by wrongful means (fraudulent

misrepresentation) should not be enforced by a tribunal...°*
Spain explains that the NextEra Entities “/ied” by saying that the installed capacity of the
project was lower than 50 MW when, according to Spain, it was above 50 MW.*4
According to Spain, “Article 27 of the 1997 Electricity Sector Act required as an essential
condition that, in order to qualify for the system of Article 36 of the RD 661/2007, the
installations had an ‘installed power [which] does not exceed 50 MW”.* Spain submits
that since the plants had an installed capacity of more than 50 MW, they could not benefit

from the privileged system of subsidies.

Spain submits that NextEra Entities’ misrepresentation constituted the crime of subsidy

fraud and the crime of falsehood in public documents under Spanish law.”4°

The Tribunal committed a manifest excess of powers by upholding jurisdiction and
conferring international protection on the Claimants when they were not entitled to it due
to their unclean hands. The Tribunal should have found a lack of jurisdiction or
inadmissibility of the NextEra Entities’ claim.**” Spain submits that the Tribunal’s decision
is against ius cogens, “essential principles of international law”, and the principle that

international arbitration cannot shelter or protect fraudulent actions.”“*

In this regard, Spain contends that it raised a jurisdictional objection in the underlying
arbitration “because legitimate expectations cannot be protected in those who access
benefits with fraud and falsehood”. Spain claims that the Tribunal committed a manifest
excess of its power by “omitting any pronouncement on the matter” and deciding on the
merits of the case when it should have “declared itself incompetent” or “dismiss[ed] the
substance of the claim” due to the “unlawful investment”.?°° Spain also contends that the
Committee must annul the Award because the Tribunal did not have jurisdiction or because
“it is contrary to the essential principles of international law and to the ius cogens that

protection is granted to those who go to a Tribunal without clean hands”.**!

b The NextEra Entities’ Position
The NextEra Entities highlight that:

...it is not an option for a party first to await the outcome of the
proceedings on the merits without making an objection to
jurisdiction and then, if the award turns out to be unfavourable, to

request annulment on the ground of an excess of powers because the
tribunal acted outside of its competence...?>*

203. According to the NextEra Entities, Spain is precluded from raising any argument in
connection with the installed capacity based on two reasons: (i) Spain cannot invoke the
installed capacity objection or unclean hands allegation as a jurisdictional issue because
Spain never raised that issue as a jurisdictional objection in the arbitration; and (ii) ICSID
Arbitration Rule 27 is applicable to the annulment and therefore the argument has been
waived because it was not promptly raised after the Decision.”>? Spain also did not seek a

supplemental decision under Art. 49 of the ICSID Convention.

204. The NextEra Entities also argue that the Tribunal ultimately did not need to decide upon
the installed capacity issue because it was a matter only relevant for its primary claim. They
added that in any event the Tribunal did decide upon the matter implicitly. A tribunal does
not “manifestly” exceed its powers by finding it does not need to resolve a particular

question.?*+

205. The NextEra Entities also argue that the Committee is not able to make findings of fact as

that is “beyond its remit”.?°°

206. In this regard, it requests the Committee dismiss Spain’s grounds of annulment regarding

the installed capacity issue.7*°
G The Committee’s Analysis

207. The Committee examines whether the Tribunal committed a manifest excess of powers
because it upheld jurisdiction or admitted the Claimants’ claims despite their unclean hands
concerning the installed capacity issue. Spain contends that upholding jurisdiction or

admitting their claims would be contrary to the “essential principles of international law

and ius cogens”.*°’ According to Spain, the Tribunal should have “declared itself
incompetent to deal with an unlawful investment or, alternatively, dismiss the substance of
the claim’.*** The Committee considers that the Applicant has raised this annulment

ground as a jurisdictional objection and a matter of inadmissibility.

208. The Committee focuses its attention on how this argument was presented in the underlying
arbitration. In the underlying arbitration, Spain did not plead the installed capacity issue
(“Installed Capacity Objection”) as a jurisdictional objection. As the Claimants point out,
the Applicant specifically stated that it was “not defending the investment violation by the
Claimants as a grounds [sic] affecting the Tribunal’s jurisdiction” in the underlying
arbitration.*? Spain reaffirmed this fact in its 27 February 2017 post-hearing letter to the

Tribunal.?® The Applicant only raised installed capacity as a merits and quantum issue in

the underlying arbitration and specifically did not as a jurisdictional objection.”°! Spain

instead raised five, specific jurisdictional objections in the underlying arbitration that were
based on (1) ratione materiae and ratione personae, (2) ratione voluntatis, (3) ratione
personae, (4) Art. 10(1) of the ECT, and (5) Art. 10(7) of the ECT, none of which were
related to the Installed Capacity Objection.” Spain’s two key pleadings on jurisdiction,
its Memorial on Preliminary Objections with Request for Bifurcation dated 9 September

2015 and Reply on Preliminary Objections dated 14 October 2016, did not raise installed

capacity as the basis for a jurisdictional objection.

209. The Committee further finds that Spain did not frame the installed capacity issue as an

issue involving unclean hands, illegality, fraud, misrepresentation or bad faith on the part

of the Claimants (collectively “Unclean Hands Argument’) in the underlying arbitration.
The Committee notes that Spain’s related claims based on a violation of ius cogens,
“essential principles of international law”, and Spanish criminal law, were also not raised
before the annulment proceeding. The Committee considers the Unclean Hands Argument
as a subsidiary argument of the Installed Capacity Objection. The key memorials Spain
submitted such as its Memorial on Preliminary Objections with Request for Bifurcation
dated 9 September 2015, Reply on Preliminary Objections dated 14 October 2016,
Counter-Memorial on the Merits dated 4 March 2016, or its Rejoinder on the Merits of 20
October 2016 contain nothing regarding the Unclean Hands Argument.” At most, in its
Rejoinder on the Merits, Spain raised the issue that the real installed capacity was
“concealed” .* Subsequently, during the arbitration hearing, Spain alleged that it had been
“deluded” and that the nameplate contained “false information”.*® Further, in two post-
hearing letters Spain submitted that information was “hidden” or “concealed”.?*" Spain did
not formally advance the Unclean Hands Argument in the underlying arbitration and

introduced it for the first time in its Application.?%

210. The Committee concludes that Spain therefore raised both the Installed Capacity Objection
and the Unclean Hands Argument as jurisdictional objections at the annulment stage for
the first time. The Committee assesses the consequences of the Applicant raising these
jurisdictional objections for the first time at the annulment stage. ICSID Arbitration

Rule 41(1) stipulates that “[a]ny objection that the dispute or any ancillary claim is not

within the jurisdiction of the Centre or, for other reasons, is not within the competence of
the Tribunal shall be made as early as possible”. (emphasis added). ICSID Arbitration
Rule 41(1) adds that where the facts concerning the objection are known, the party must
file its objection before its counter-memorial. Spain itself confirmed that parties must raise
jurisdictional objections no later than their counter-memorial where they know of the facts
underlying the objection.”” Spain has not denied that it was aware of the installed capacity

issue before it filed its Counter-Memorial on the Merits.

ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1) does not stipulate the consequences of failing to raise a
jurisdictional objection “as early as possible” or before the counter-memorial. The
Claimants argue that taken together with ICSID Arbitration Rule 27 the consequences
should be a waiver of the objection. They contend that Spain was aware of the issue and,
under ICSID Arbitration Rule 27, had to “state promptly its objection” >” They claim that
by not “promptly” complaining, Spain waived its right to object under ICSID Arbitration
Rule 27.

The implications of failing to comply with ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1) and whether it
should automatically lead to a waiver under ICSID Arbitration Rule 27 are not specified
under the ICSID Arbitration Rules. In any event, the Committee finds that the Installed
Capacity Objection and Unclean Hands Argument were never raised before the Tribunal
as a jurisdictional objection. Spain raised five specific jurisdictional objections before the

Tribunal but none of them concerned installed capacity or unclean hands.

The Tribunal rejected all five jurisdictional objections and upheld jurisdiction. The
Tribunal could not have committed a manifest excess of powers because it did not consider
a jurisdictional objection that was never advanced before it. A jurisdictional argument that
was never advanced before a tribunal cannot be brought before an ad hoc committee de
novo and serve as a basis for annulment. Spain has not claimed that the facts behind the
Installed Capacity Objection and Unclean Hands Argument were unknown and recently

discovered. Therefore, in the words of Schreuer, “it would appear unacceptable to let a

party that has knowingly failed to challenge a serious irregularity before the tribunal later
attack the award in annulment proceedings”.”"' Along the same lines, the Committee finds
it is unnecessary to consider Spain’s ius cogens, “essential principles of international law”,
and Spanish criminal law arguments since they are dependent upon the Unclean Hands

Argument and were never advanced in the underlying arbitration either.

214. In addition to the jurisdictional objection, Spain also claims the Tribunal committed a
manifest excess of powers because the NextEra Entities’ claims should have been
inadmissible based on the Installed Capacity Objection and the Unclean Hands Argument.
The Committee notes that admissibility is not a concept mentioned or used in the ICSID
Convention. As a general matter, the Committee observes that, if admissibility is
considered, it should be viewed as a narrower concept than jurisdiction, and a tribunal
should be granted substantial discretion in its assessment of what is admissible in a
particular circumstance. The Committee ultimately finds that admissibility need not be

considered since it was never raised before the Tribunal.

215. The Committee concludes that Spain’s claim that the Tribunal committed a manifest excess
of powers based on Spain’s Unclean Hands Argument and Install Capacity Objection must
be denied because they were not advanced as a jurisdictional objection or admissibility

challenge in the underlying arbitration and cannot be raised for the first time on annulment.

(2) Manifest Excess of Powers by Hearing a Dispute between an Investor of an EU
Member State and an EU Member State - “Jntra-EU Objection” (Art. 52(1)(b))
(Annulment Ground (g))

a. Spain’s Position

216. Spain argues that “there is no possibility of investment arbitration between a company of
an EU Member State and a Member State”.*”” Spain refers to Professor Gosalbo’s two

expert reports and provides that “[a]// the reasons stated by Professor Gosalbo are assumed

2” Schreuer, CL-279, Art. 52, 60.
22 Memorial, § 128.

63

Case 1:19-cv-01618-TSC Document 59-1 Filed 03/25/22 Page 77 of 163

by the Kingdom of Spain”? Professor Gosalbo opined that (1) the ECT does not apply to

intra-EU disputes; (2) the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (“TFEU”) provides that

international agreements such as the ECT cannot be contradictory to EU law since the latter

has primacy; and (3) the CJEU has exclusive jurisdiction over EU law issues.”

217. According to Spain, EU Member States decided that EU legislation should apply to intra-
community affairs and intra-EU disputes, while international conventions remain in force

for relations with third countries.?”°
218. Referring to the Achmea decision, Spain remarks that the CJEU found that:

Articles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a
provision in an international agreement concluded between
Member States, such as Article 8 of the BIT, under which an investor
from one of those Member States may, in the event of a dispute
concerning investments in the other Member State, bring
proceedings against the latter Member State before an arbitral
tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to
accept...2"6

219. Spain claims that Art. 26 of the ECT does not apply within the EU for disputes between
Member States. It further holds that the Tribunal did not carry out an analysis of all the
tules of interpretation provided in Art. 31 of the Vienna Convention, but merely indicated

that there was no disconnection clause and on that basis stated its conclusion.?””

220. Spain argues that the CJEU judgment in Moldova v. Komstroy decides for the first time
that arbitration of intra-EU investment disputes under the ECT is not allowed and not

compatible with EU law, EU treaties, and the autonomy principle. Spain adds that the

decision is binding upon the Netherlands and Spain, and Dutch investors cannot have any

rights different than the rights and legal framework that is applicable to the Netherlands.?’*

Spain concludes by saying that admitting jurisdiction for investment arbitration within the

EU for disputes between Member States constitutes a manifest excess of jurisdiction.?”
b The NextEra Entities’ Position

The NextEra Entities submit that there can hardly be a manifest excess of jurisdiction by
the Tribunal where all other ECT tribunals to date have unanimously upheld their
jurisdiction over intra-EU disputes.°*° The Tribunal’s conclusion on jurisdiction was

instead plainly tenable.?*!

Additionally, the NextEra Entities consider that this is an attempt from Spain to re-argue

the correctness of the case that is beyond the bounds of Art. 52 of the ICSID Convention.?*?
Finally, the NextEra Entities refer to Professor Piet Eeckhout’s expert opinion:

..Jn particular, Professor Eeckhout explains that: (i) the ECT

applies on an intra-EU basis; (ii) there is in fact no conflict between

the ECT and EU law; and (iii) even if such a conflict existed, it

would have to be resolved in favour of the ECT and international

law, not EU law, based on the express terms of Art. 16 of the ECT.?*?
According to the Claimants, the “elaborate arguments” that Spain, Professor Gosalbo and
the EC through “more than one hundred pages of complex (and highly disputed) legal
argument” illustrate that the Tribunal’s decision was not an excess of powers “evident on
its face”.”*+ The Claimants argue that the Applicant attempts to “re-argue jurisdiction de

novo” through its arguments based on Art. 38 of the ICJ Statute.

As for the Moldova v. Komstroy CJEU judgment, the Claimants submit that it was rendered
years after the Tribunal’s award. This precludes it from being a basis for annulment.
Spain’s attempt to rely on it contradict the settled law that ad hoc committees assess a
tribunal’s decision based on the record before it at the time of its award, not on subsequent

materials.?°°

For these reasons, according to the NextEra Entities, Spain failed to establish that the
Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by upholding jurisdiction over an intra~EU

claim.?*”
G The Committee’s Analysis

The Committee examines whether the Tribunal committed a manifest excess of powers by
hearing a dispute between an investor from an EU Member State and another Member

State.

The Committee finds that the Tribunal’s decision was based on a straightforward analysis
of the ECT, the Vienna Convention, and the applicable rules and principles of international
law, which, as agreed by the Parties, together constituted the applicable substantive law.?**
The Tribunal first reviewed the decisions of previous tribunals that upheld jurisdiction
under Art. 26 of the ECT, the Achmea judgment, and the observations of the EC.*? The
Tribunal then considered whether the ECT applied to relations between EU Member States
or whether it excluded jurisdiction over intra-EU disputes.?°° The Tribunal decided that
absent a “disconnection clause and a revision of the ECT” the EU’s consenting to the ECT

did not supersede each EU Member State’s individual consent to the ECT.”?!

The Tribunal next considered whether the overlap that might exist between the ECT and
EU law affected Spain’s offer to arbitrate.?°* The Tribunal concluded that even if there was
an overlap, its jurisdiction “must be answered in light of Article 26 of the ECT” and not EU
law.? The Tribunal also decided that intra-EU obligations were not superseded by
subsequent treaties because the treaties did not relate to the same subject matter.?** The
Tribunal concluded that it could not hold that “Spain’s consent to submit ECT disputes to
arbitration excluded intra-EU investment disputes” and that “primacy of EU Law

exclude[d] jurisdiction of the present Tribunal established under the ECT”.?°°

The Committee finds that the Tribunal did not exceed its powers by upholding jurisdiction
to hear the case under Art. 26 of the ECT despite Spain’s intra-EU objection. The
Tribunal’s decision was tenable as a matter of law and it could not be deemed a gross or
egregious misapplication of the law that a reasonable person could not accept such that it
would amount to a non-application of the law. In terms of application of Art. 38 of the ICJ
Statute, the Committee agrees that this argument was raised de novo during the annulment
proceedings and need not be considered since it was not brought before the Tribunal. Spain
did not demonstrate that it made any reference to Art. 38 of the ICJ Statute in the underlying

arbitration.

The Committee also notes that, as the Claimants submit, 32 ICSID tribunals applying the
ECT have rejected the alleged primacy of EU law over intra-EU disputes between an
investor of the EU and another EU Member State under the ECT.?*° As Spain contends,
the Committee agrees that it is not bound by these decisions and arguably they may not
even be correct. Yet, the Committee finds that the fact that so many other tribunals reached
the same conclusion on the same issue as the Tribunal confirms that the Tribunal’s
interpretation of the ECT was tenable as a matter of law. In contrast, Spain did not submit

any ICSID decisions upholding its intra-EU argument. This reaffirms that the Tribunal’s

decision to uphold its jurisdiction for the intra-EU dispute under the ECT and reject Spain’s
argument based on the primacy of EU law over intra-EU disputes cannot be considered as

being an excess of powers, let alone a plain, clear, obvious, flagrant or evident one.

The Committee finds that the CJEU judgment Moldova v. Komstroy was rendered more
than two years after the Tribunal’s Award. Art. 52(1)(b) is limited to assessing a tribunal’s
decision based on the record and law at the time it was rendered. This precludes the
Committee from considering the CJEU judgment and it cannot serve as a basis for

annulment.

The Committee concludes that the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers in finding

jurisdiction to hear the intra-EU dispute and instead had a tenable basis to do.

(3) Manifest Excess of Powers by not Applying the Applicable International
Rules, the ECT and EU Law to the Merits of the Case (Art. 52(1)(b))
(Annulment Ground (i))

a. Spain’s Position

According to Spain, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by going beyond its
jurisdiction and totally omitting the application of applicable international rules and

applicable international law, the ECT, and EU law.?””

In furtherance of this argument, Spain states that the Tribunal exceeded its powers when
deciding that the applicable law was the “ECT and any rules of international law relevant
to its interpretation and application” and did not recognize the “autonomy and primacy”

of EU law.?°*

Relying on Soufraki v. The United Arab Emirates?” and Sempra v. Argentina,*®° Spain

highlights that:

. Committees have concluded that there is also an excess of
powers, where the Tribunal fails in determining the applicable law
or when it manifestly fails in interpreting the law applicable to the
dispute...>°!
Spain argues that under Art. 26(6) of the ECT, the Tribunal should have applied the
“applicable rules and principles of international law” but instead limited the application

of the rules and principles of international law to only what may be “relevant to the

application and the interpretation” of the ECT.*
b The NextEra Entities’ Position

Based on Lemire v. Ukraine, the NextEra Entities argue that Spain should have raised its
objection that the Tribunal failed to apply the applicable law promptly after receipt of the

Decision.*°3

The NextEra Entities also add that the Tribunal’s interpretation of the applicable law clause

contained in Art. 26(6) of the ECT was consistent with the interpretation reached by

numerous other ECT tribunals.*°

In addition, the NextEra Entities highlight that:

«Consistent with that finding, the Tribunal then proceeded to
decide the dispute in accordance with Art. 10(1) of the ECT and
applicable rules of international law relevant to the interpretation
and application of the ECT, such as the rules of interpretation set
out in the VCLT.*°°

Case 1:19-cv-01618-TSC Document 59-1 Filed 03/25/22 Page 83 of 163

All in all, the NextEra Entities conclude that the Tribunal’s decision to not apply EU law,
including EU State aid rules, as a substantive law, is not a manifest excess of power but

the natural consequence of the Tribunal’s finding as to the applicable law.*°°
G The Committee’s Analysis

The Committee examines whether the Tribunal committed a manifest excess of powers
concerning the applicable law and rules. Art. 26(6) of the ECT provides that “[a]
tribunal...shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable

rules and principles of international law” 3°7

Spain’s claims that the Tribunal dispensed with the application of (1) “applicable
international rules” and “applicable international law”, (2) the ECT, and (3) all EU law.
The Committee considers Spain’s argument as being that the Tribunal committed a
manifest excess of powers by improperly interpreting and applying Art. 26(6) of the ECT
and by not determining and applying the applicable law and rules, which included the ECT
and all EU law. As provided in Section V.A(1)c, supra, Spain’s claim of a manifest excess
of powers is, all the more difficult because it primarily seeks to challenge the interpretation
of a treaty provision. A party seeking annulment on this basis must “prove that its
interpretation is a monolithic and firmly settled principle of law that is ‘not subject to

debate” 3”

The Committee finds that the Tribunal held that it was common ground between the Parties
that the substantive law included the ECT, the Vienna Convention, and the “applicable
rules and principles of international law”.*'° They also agreed that Spanish law was
“relevant”, although they disagreed as to how much weight should be given to Spanish law

and EU law.*!! The Tribunal interpreted the meaning of Art. 26(6) of the ECT and

determined the applicable law and rules when it held that “the applicable law is the ECT
and any rules of international law relevant to its interpretation and application”.*'* The
Tribunal added that it would “refer to provisions of Spanish law and EU law if
appropriate”.*'> The Committee finds that the Tribunal’s interpretation is based on the
general agreement between the Parties on the substantive law and the express text of
Art. 26(6). The Committee finds that the Tribunal decided that it only needed to determine
the meaning of “applicable rules and principles of international law” under Art. 26(6) and

the relevance and weight to be given to Spanish and EU law.

The Committee notes that the Tribunal then proceeded to apply the applicable law and
tules. Contrary to Spain’s assertion, the Committee finds that the Tribunal did not
“dispense[] with the application of applicable international rules” and “applicable
international law”.*'+ The Tribunal instead rejected Spain’s preferred application of the

“applicable law and rules” concerning the weight to be given to EU law.

As provided in Section V.D(2), supra, the Tribunal chose to reject Spain’s intra-EU
objection based on EU law. The Tribunal accordingly rejected Spain’s claim concerning
the “applicable rules and the principles of international law” under Art. 26(6) of the ECT
and the weight to be given to EU law. As found above, the Committee considers that the
Tribunal’s interpretation and application of the ECT were tenable as a matter of law. Even
if this application was a misapplication, it could not be considered a non-application of
law. A tenable decision to not apply a certain law is not a failure to apply the law annullable

under Art. 52(1)(b).

The Committee notes again that various ICSID tribunals applying the ECT reached the
same conclusion as the Tribunal’s regarding the interpretation of Art 26(6) of the ECT and
the limited application of EU Law. The Committee agrees with Spain that it is not bound

to follow these other tribunals’ decisions and there are tribunals that have decided

differently.*!° Yet, the fact that so many other tribunals reached the same decision
regarding the same matter reinforces that the Tribunal’s interpretation was at a minimum
tenable as a matter of law. This reaffirms that the Tribunal’s decision to determine the
applicable law based on the ECT and the weight to be given to EU Law could not be
deemed an excess of powers, let alone one that was plain, clear, obvious, flagrant or

evident.

In terms of application of Art. 38 of the ICJ Statute, as provided in Section V.D(2)c, supra,
the Committee repeats that this argument was raised de novo during the annulment

proceedings and need not be considered since it was not raised before the Tribunal.

The Committee finds that the Applicant has not established a manifest excess of powers
under Art. 52(1)(b) based upon the interpretation and application of the applicable law
under Art. 26(6) of the ECT.

(4) Manifest Excess of Powers Regarding the Tribunal’s Assessment of Legitimate

Expectation Regarding the State Aid (Art. 52(1)(b)) (Annulment Ground (k))
a. Spain’s Position

Spain argues that the Tribunal misapplied and dispensed with EU law and the decision of

the EC, both applicable laws, to assess legitimate expectations.

In their submissions, both Spain and the EC, the latter as amicus curiae, stressed that the
State aid schemes for renewable energies should have been notified to the EC and they

were not in the present case.*!°

253. Therefore, Spain explains that under the EU law on State aid “it could not be understood
that there was any legitimate expectation that the subsidy would remain unchanged”>""

Based on Electrabel v. Hungary, Spain argues that:

... interpretation must be made in accordance with EU law and that
it cannot be held that Article 10 of the ECT has been infringed to the
extent that there is another rule of international law (recognised by
Article 1 (3) of the ECT itself) that prevents legitimate expectations
from being considered.*'*

254. Spain concludes by saying that:

In the event that it was understood that the Arbitral Tribunal applied
European Union law (quod non), it would have made a blatantly
erroneous application by completely disregarding the value of the
Commission's Decision applicable to the case and by declaring that
there were legitimate expectations contrary to what this European
Commission’s Decision states.*!°

255. According to Spain, the Tribunal should have also applied the State aid regime as part of
Spanish (i.e., national) law.*?° The Claimants could not have had any expectation to
something that was “illegal” or “not authorised by law”.*?! Spain also adopts “all the
reasons stated by” Professor Gosalbo who argued that “there is a likelihood of frustration

of enforcement of intra-EU ECT awards dealing with State Aid”.>”?

256. The Tribunal failed to apply EU State aid law and committed a “blatantly erroneous
application” of the applicable law.*?> The Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers through

“a manifestly incorrect application of applicable law to be taken into account in assessing

legitimate expectations” .***

b The NextEra Entities’ Position

As an initial matter, the NextEra Entities claim that if the Committee denies Spain’s
Annulment Ground (i), supra, Spain’s Annulment Ground (k) necessarily fails by

extension.*?°

The NextEra Entities contend that Spain offers no substantive analysis as to why a EC
decision is a “rule and principle of international law” that is applicable in deciding whether

Spain breached the ECT.**
The NextEra Entities explain that:

[n]umerous ECT tribunals have declined to follow Electrabel’s

reasoning on the law applicable to merits of an ECT claim,

illustrating that there can be no manifest excess of powers where an

ECT tribunal elects not to subordinate Art. 10(1) of the ECT to EU

law, or to EU State aid law in particular.*?”
The NextEra Entities highlight that the Tribunal was entitled to interpret the applicable law
clause in the Art. 26(6) in the way it did. The Tribunal’s application of Art. 10 of the ECT,
exclusive of EU law, as the governing standard for determining legitimate expectations
could not serve as a basis for annulment.*”* This interpretation was tenable as a matter of

law.

The NextEra Entities also conclude by saying that Spain’s request to this Committee
concerns an alleged erroneous application of the law and is an attempt to re-argue the merits

of the case, both of which lie beyond the scope of Art. 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.
G The Committee’s Analysis

The Committee examines whether the Tribunal’s assessment of legitimate expectation that

was based on its decision not to apply EU State aid law was a manifest excess of powers.

Case 1:19-cv-01618-TSC Document 59-1 Filed 03/25/22 Page 88 of 163

The Committee agrees with the Claimants that this ground cannot be sustained based on
the same reasons as Annulment Ground (i). Spain itself concedes that this ground is
“subsidiary” to the previous ground on EU law.*?? If the Tribunal did not commit a
manifest excess of powers when it found that the law applicable to the merits was the ECT
and applicable rules and principles of international law, and EU law where appropriate,
then it could not have committed a manifest excess of powers when it found legitimate
expectations under Art. 10 of the ECT without applying EU State aid law. This premise
establishes that the Tribunal’s decision could not be deemed an excess of powers, let alone

one that was plain, clear, obvious, flagrant or evident.

For completeness, the Committee does not find that the Tribunal committed a “blatantly
erroneous application”, that the Tribunal should have applied the EU State aid regime as
part of Spanish (i.e., national) law,**° or that the Claimants could not have had any
expectation to something that was “i/legal” or “not authorised by law” that breaches the
EU State aid law. The Committee finds that Applicant’s claims are at most assertions that
the Tribunal incorrectly applied the applicable law. The Committee observes that the
Tribunal decided that since EU law was not applicable to determining the alleged breach
of fair and equitable treatment, then EU State aid law should not be applied to determine
the Claimants’ legitimate expectations. As noted in Section V.D(1), supra, the Committee
notes that the installed capacity issue was not framed in terms of illegality in the underlying
arbitration. The Tribunal’s decision does not reach the bar established by Alapli v. Turkey
that the “/egal analysis was so untenable or implausible that the error [wa]s evident on the
face of the award” .**' The Tribunal’s decision could not be considered a gross or egregious
misapplication of the law that a reasonable person could not accept and amount to a failure

to apply the law.

The Committee confirms that other ICSID tribunals applying the ECT such as AES v.

Hungary reached the same conclusions as the Tribunal and found legitimate expectations

based on Art. 10(1) of the ECT without applying EU law.>*? For the Committee’s purposes,
whether AES v. Hungary or Electrabel v. Hungary were correct does not matter. What
matters is that some tribunals reached the same decision on legitimate expectations as the

Tribunal. This confirms that the Tribunal’s decision was at least tenable as a matter of law.

The Committee also agrees with the Claimants that Art. 52(1)(b) does not permit
annulment based on the potential for enforcement and Professor Gosalbo’s report in this

regard may be disregarded.

The Committee concludes that the Tribunal did not commit a manifest excess of powers

based on its assessment of legitimate expectation under Spain’s State aid regime.

(5) Manifest Excess of Powers Regarding the Tribunal’s Granting of Damages
(Art. 52(1)(b)) (Annulment Ground (p))

a. Spain’s Position

Spain asserts that the Decision is inconsistent with the Tribunal’s finding on liability
because, among other things, the Tribunal intended to provide the Claimants with a return
fixed at the weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) established as of the valuation
date of June 2016 plus 200 basis points (“bps”) but did not do so.**? Spain submits that the
Decision provides that the Claimants were entitled to a return equal to WACC plus 200
bps at the valuation date, and did not distinguish “between periods or different expectations
at an earlier stage”.**+ According to Spain, the Decision on quantum is inconsistent with

this.

While primarily focused on the failure to state reasons grounds, Spain also submits “where

appropriate that the Tribunal committed a manifest excess of powers due to the

following: (1) for the capitalization of historical damages, a risk-free rate should have been

used instead of the cost of equity; (2) for the primary claim of the actual scenario, the
benchmark for the regulatory rate of return was not set even though it was disputed by the
experts of the Parties; (3) for the premium added to the WACC reference, although disputed
by the experts, the use of 200 bps was not “specifically justified’***, and (4) for the effective
tax conversion rate, although disputed by the experts, Compass Lexecon’s assumption of
using a nominal tax rate was accepted without mentioning and explaining the reasons for

rejecting Accuracy’s arguments.**”

b The NextEra Entities’ Position

The NextEra Entities claim that the Tribunal’s approach to quantum was straightforward
and consistent since it adopted the alternative but-for damages model put forward by
Compass Lexecon in its entirety with one adjustment in the form of a reduction of 100 bps

to the allowed rate of return.

The Claimants submit that Spain’s argument is a “complete rewriting of the Decision”
because there was no “contradiction” and that Spain is trying to appeal the Tribunal’s

findings on quantum as being “incorrect”.***

Under settled law, annulment is not a forum for challenging the correctness of an award

and would not qualify as a manifest excess of powers.
G The Committee’s Analysis

The Committee examines whether the Tribunal committed a manifest excess of power
when it awarded damages as Spain claims. As a general matter, the Committee agrees with
the consensus that exists among committees that tribunals have a wide margin of

appreciation when determining damages. As provided in Occidental Petroleum v. Ecuador,

 

“a)nnul of decisions face an additi hurdle: ad hoc committees have

consistently held that tribunals have a wide margin of discretion with respect to the

Case 1:19-cv-01618-TSC Document 59-1 Filed 03/25/22 Page 91 of 163

calculation of damages”.**° By its nature, a tribunal must engage in a fact intensive inquiry
and must make a discretionary judgment to assess what it deems appropriate for damages.

An annulment application based on damages must meet a higher bar.

The Committee notes that for the first regulatory period from 2014 to 2019, the Tribunal
used a WACC prevailing as of 30 June 2014 that was equal to 6.0% (on a post-tax basis),
then added a 200-bps premium and converted it to a pre-tax basis resulting in a reasonable
rate of return of 11.4%. For the subsequent regulatory period from 2020 onwards, the
Tribunal used a WACC that reflected the date of valuation 30 June 2016, then again added
a 200-bps premium and converted it to a pre-tax basis resulting in a reasonable rate of

return of 9.2%.

First, Spain claims that the Tribunal included the Claimants’ damages experts’ “incorrect
quantification” of the capitalization of historical damages that should have included a risk-
free rate instead of the cost of equity used.*4° The Committee considers that even if Spain’s
contention is accepted and the quantification of the Claimants’ damages experts was

incorrect, it would not constitute an excess of powers since it was tenable.

Second, Spain argues that the experts did not agree on the benchmark for reasonable return
used in the Actual Scenario and the Tribunal “overlooked” this and did not “substantiate[]
its decision” for choosing the rate proposed by the Claimants’ experts.*4! The Committee
finds that a difference of opinion among experts only supports the view that tenable
arguments existed on both sides. The Tribunal’s decision to choose one benchmark over

the other was tenable and not an excess of powers.

Third, Spain asserts that the Tribunal added 200 bps to the WACC reference instead of 300
bps. The Committee finds that the Tribunal considered three factors in making this
decision: (1) “there is no consistent practice of fixing the premium at 300bps in European

jurisdictions that provide for a premium when calculating a return on investment in

regulated sectors”; (2) “the desire to encourage entrants into the Spanish solar energy

system”; and (3) “the view expressed by CNE [the Comision Nacional de Energia] that a

premium over WACC was a reasonable expectation of return”.*** What matters is not

whether it would have been more “appropriate” to have granted a premium between “0
99343,

and 100 basis points’”’**’; what matters is whether the decision was tenable. The Committee

finds the decision was tenable based on these factors.

Fourth, Spain submits that the Tribunal used a nominal tax rate over an effective tax
conversion rate that was disputed among the experts and the Tribunal “simply accepted”
the Claimants’ expert’s position. The Committee again holds that the key issue is whether
the Tribunal decision on the nominal tax rate was a tenable one. The Tribunal explained
that it “took account of the fact that the statement of Compass Lexecon that the use of the
nominal rate [was] ‘accepted regulatory practice’ was not contradicted by Respondent and
noted the difficulty of calculating an ‘effective rate’ for each year”. The Committee
concludes that the Tribunal’s decision to adopt an “accepted regulatory practice” instead
of the position of Spain’s experts in light of the difficulty of calculating an “effective rate”
for each year was a tenable one.*4> The Committee again confirms that a difference of
opinion among experts only supports the view that tenable arguments existed on both sides.
The Tribunal’s decision to prefer one expert’s methodology and choose a nominal tax rate

over an effective tax conversion rate cannot constitute a manifest excess of powers.

The Committee’s role under a claim under Art. 52(1)(b) is not to assess the correctness of
the Tribunal’s decision or whether it had “inconsistencies” but only whether it was tenable
as a matter of law and not a “plain”, “clear”, “obvious”, “flagrant”, or “evident” excess of
powers. Paragraph 678 of the Decision provides that the “Claimants are entitled to
damages based on a return on the capitalized value of their assets as of 30 June 2016 on
the basis of the WAAC of the Termosol Plants plus a premium of 200bps”. Spain claims

that the Tribunal intended to provide the Claimants with a return based on a fixed WACC

established as of the valuation date of June 2016 plus 200 bps for the entire period,
including the first regulatory period, but that the Award provided otherwise. The Claimants
contend that the Tribunal’s reference to 30 June 2016 “corresponds to the date of valuation
for the capitalised value of the Claimants’ assets, and not the date on which to establish
the rate of return for the first regulatory period” .**° (emphasis in original). The Committee
finds that the Decision might be ambiguous whether the same WACC plus a 200-bps
premium was meant to apply for the entire period, including the first regulatory period.
Theoretically, both Parties’ interpretations are tenable. The Committee’s mandate is not to
determine which view is more tenable. All in all, the Tribunal’s decision on quantum in

the Award cannot be considered a manifest excess of powers.

SPAIN’S ALLEGATIONS AS TO FAILURES TO STATE REASONS

qd) Failure to State Reasons Regarding the Installed Capacity Objection—
“Unclean Hands Objection” (Art. 52(1)(e)) (Annulment Ground (f))

a. Spain’s Position

Spain argues that the Award fails to state the reasons why it has “jurisdiction to hear an
arbitration initiated by Claimants in order to obtain protection for investments made
without clean hands”.**” Spain submits that “the falsehoods committed by FPL in the

investment, which prevent it from going to the Tribunal to claim and, in any case, would
determine _inadmissibility on the grounds as legitimate expectations cannot cover an

 

investor fraud” *** (emphasis added). A violation of the clean-hands doctrine leads to the
Tribunal’s “/ack of jurisdiction” or that the “claim should [have been] dismissed”, because
international arbitration cannot protect fraud or those without clean hands. *4? Spain
submits that “it is clear that the legality of the investment, in so far as it determines the

material scope of the Tribunal’s own jurisdiction, or where appropriate, the admissibility

of the Claim, are aspects of what should have been pronounced by the Award”.>°
(emphasis added).

As noted in Section V.D(1)a, paragraph 198, supra, Spain explains that the NextEra
Entities “lied” by saying that the installed capacity of the project was lower than 50 MW
when, according to Spain, it was above 50 MW.**! According to Spain, “Article 27 of the
1997 Electricity Sector Act required as an essential condition that, in order to qualify for
the system of Article 36 of the RD 661/2007, the installations had an ‘installed power
[which] does not exceed 50 MW”? Since the plants had an installed capacity of more

than 50 MW, they could not benefit from the privileged system of subsidies.

Spain also submits that the Tribunal did not apply or interpret international jus cogens,
“which prevents those who seek to benefit from falsehoods and frauds from being granted
international protection”. ** The Award does not give any reasoning on this
“transcendental issue that centered the debate on the Arbitration” >*+ The Tribunal failed
to state reasons on the “fraudulent access...to subsidies to which [the Claimants were] not

entitled due to [their] false statements on installed power” >>

Spain contends that it raised a jurisdictional objection in the underlying arbitration
“because legitimate expectations cannot be protected in those who access benefits with
fraud and falsehood”.** On the first day of the Hearing, Spain stated that not only that the
fraud “should not be admitted’, but it also provided “on the basis of such a false
declaration, one cannot have legitimate ex, ions” .*>7 (emphasis added). On the second

day of the Hearing, Spain expanded upon the Tribunal’s failure to state reasons on how the

Claimants could have a legitimate expectation in light of the unclean hands issue

surrounding the installed capacity.***

Spain claims that tribunals may not be required to state their reasoning in full extent but a
“minimum pronouncement is required on the essential issues raised by the parties” such
as the “/egality of the investment”.* According to Spain, the Tribunal acknowledged that
both Parties made arguments regarding the installed capacity of the project, but the Award
failed to make any pronouncement, even brief, on these matters and did not refer to the

evidence presented.*”
b The NextEra Entities’ Position

The NextEra Entities argue that most of the arguments under this ground overlap with

Annulment Ground (e) in Section V.D(1), supra.

The Claimants argue that Spain has waived its right to seek annulment because it became
aware of the issue when it received the Tribunal’s Decision but failed to object within the
80 days since the Award was rendered. This cannot be allowed. As cited above in response
to Annulment Ground (e), in Section V.D(1), supra, the Claimants submit that under

Art. 27 the Applicant waived its objections on these grounds.**!

The NextEra Entities stress that Spain raised the unclean hands, illegality, fraud, and
misrepresentation arguments as a jurisdictional objection for the first time in the annulment
proceedings. They claim that Spain did not raise a jurisdictional objection in the underlying
arbitration arising from fraud and falsehood. The Claimants argue that an objection based

on admissibility cannot be sustained even more so.>

The Claimants submit that even if, guod non, the Applicant’s objections were permissible,

they are not sustainable because no unclean hands, falsehood, fraud, or misrepresentation

existed. The Claimants argue that they were transparent about the installed capacity.*°

They state Spain is asserting a novel interpretation of the installed capacity of a power plant
not supported by Spanish law or industry practice, and the qualification of the Termosol
Plants under the Special Regime was confirmed by various administrative organs of the
Spanish State in full knowledge of the actual capacity of the Termosol Plants.*°* The

NextEra Entities claim they presented evidence to this effect not challenged by Spain.*°

The NextEra Entities contend that given the Tribunal’s findings on liability and legitimate
expectations based on the Claimants’ alternative claim, it did not have to decide upon the
installed capacity issue. Since the Tribunal found that the Claimants were not entitled to
damages based on RD 661/2007, but on a corrected version of Regulatory Framework III,

it was unnecessary to decide the installed capacity objection.*

The Claimants finally argue that the Tribunal implicitly provided reasons concerning the
installed capacity issue. Based on the Wena Hotels v. Egypt case, the NextEra Entities
explain that a tribunal’s reasons “may be implicit in the considerations and conclusions
contained in the award, provided they can be reasonably inferred from the terms used in

the decision” >"

G The Committee’s Analysis

The Committee examines whether the Award failed to state reasons regarding “a potential
fraud on the installed MW that would determine that the Claimants didn’t come with clean
hands to the ICSID and that they were out of legal scope they benefited from” > (emphasis
added). The Applicant claims that the Claimants made a “misrepresentation” or “possible
misrepresentation” on the installed capacity to be “entitled to” or “benefit” from the special

subsidies.*” Spain’s Memorial states that the clean hands doctrine means the Tribunal

should be “declared without jurisdiction, or simply that the claim should be dismissed”>”

Spain added that the “/egality of the investment, insofar as it determines the material scope
of the Tribunal’s own jurisdiction or, where appropriate, the admissibility of the Claim,

are aspects of what should have been pronounced by the Award” >"! (emphasis added).

292. As determined in Section V.D(1), supra, in the underlying arbitration, the Installed
Capacity Objection was raised as a merits issue and the Unclean Hands Argument was not
advanced at all. Both issues were advanced as jurisdictional issues for the first time on
annulment. In addition to the jurisdictional objection, Spain claims that the Tribunal failed
to state reasons because the NextEra Entities’ claims should have been inadmissible based
on the Installed Capacity Objection and the Unclean Hands Argument. Yet, based on its
conclusions above in Section V.D(1), supra, the Committee similarly finds that

admissibility need not be considered since it was never raised before the Tribunal.

293. The Committee focuses its analysis on whether the Tribunal failed to state reasons
concerning the Installed Capacity Objection issue. The Committee holds the Unclean
Hands Argument need not be considered because it was not raised as a merits issue in the
underlying arbitration. The Committee first examines whether it was relevant or necessary
for the Tribunal to state reasons concerning the Installed Capacity Objection in terms of its
merits. The Tribunal rejected the primary claim based on RD 661/2007 and instead chose
to adopt the alternative claim. While the installed capacity issue was relevant for the

primary claim, whether it was, for the alternative claim is the question.

294. Spain argues that the installed capacity was a threshold issue that could not be divorced
from Regulatory Framework III even if the claim was not based upon Art. 36 of
RD 661/2007. Spain emphasizes that the Decision summarizes that “Respondent points out
that Article 27 of the 1997 Electricity Law required as an ‘essential condition’ that in order

to qualify for the regime in Article 36 of RD 661/2007 the installations had an ‘installed

capacity [ ... ] no greater than 5|OMW’”.*” The Claimants, in contrast, cite RREEF v. Spain
as an example where a tribunal found it was not necessary to decide the installed capacity
issue because its decision was not based on the special regime under RD 661/2007.57? The

RREEF y. Spain tribunal explained:

concerning more specifically [the] Arenales [CSP plant], the
question debated between the Parties as to its installed capacity has
no consequence in the Tribunal’s reasoning since the compensation
awarded to the Claimants is based on an assessment of the
reasonableness of the actual return, not on that resulting from the
special regime under RD 661/2007 which was limited to plants of
an installed capacity of 530 MW and below.>™*

295. The Committee does not find that the installed capacity issue was an “essential condition”
under the alternative claim. The Tribunal ultimately based its finding on legitimate
expectations not on a specific law but on the broad assurances of the Spanish authorities
that legal security would be guaranteed and the economic regime would not be significantly
changed. The Tribunal concluded that based on those assurances the “Claimants had a
legitimate expectation that the regime would not be changed in a way that would
undermine the security that Claimants had in respect of the economic regime set out in RD
661/2007”.*”> (emphasis added).

296. Tribunals may be succinct in their reasoning and do not have to address all issues. What

matters is whether a matter was “relevant or necessary”. As TECO v. Guatemala explains:

[i]nsufficiency of reasons is not a ground for annulment where a
tribunal did not explain why it rejected arguments, evidence or
authorities that were not relevant or necessary for its analysis...
Similarly, ‘inadequate’ reasons may justify annulment only if they

cannot logically explain the decision they are purportedly

supporting.*”°
Spain has not convinced the Committee that it was “relevant or necessary” for the Tribunal
to address the installed capacity issue given that it rejected the primary claim. The Tribunal
did not explicitly deal with the installed capacity although it was extensively explored by
the Parties in the underlying arbitration. The Committee finds this can be logically

explained because it was not “relevant or necessary” to consider it in the alternative claim.

The Committee concludes that Spain’s claim that the Award failed to state reasons
concerning the Installed Capacity Objection should be denied because it was not necessary
or relevant for the Tribunal’s decision. Furthermore, as determined in Section V.D(1),
supra, Spain’s claim that the Award failed to state reasons concerning the Unclean Hands
Argument and Installed Capacity Objection cannot be sustained as a jurisdictional
objection or admissibility challenge because they were not advanced in the underlying

arbitration and cannot be raised for the first time on annulment.

(2) Failure to State Reasons in Hearing a Dispute between an Investor of an EU
Member State and an EU Member State - “Jntra-EU Objection” (Art. 52(1)(b))
(Annulment Ground (h))

a. Spain’s Position
Spain refers to Professor Gosalbo’s report and argues that:

..there is no possibility of investment arbitration between a

company of an EU Member State and a Member State.*”
According to Spain, Member States of the EU decided that EU legislation should apply to
intra-community affairs and intra-EU disputes, while international conventions remain in

force for relations with third countries.>”8

Referring to the Achmea decision, Spain remarks that the CJEU found that:

Articles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a

provision in an international agreement concluded between

Member States, such as Article 8 of the BIT, under which an investor

from one of those Member States may, in the event of a dispute

concerning investments in the other Member State, bring

proceedings against the latter Member State before an arbitral

tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to

accept...°”
Spain claims that the Tribunal did not explain how Art. 26 of the ECT applies within the
EU. It further holds that the Tribunal did not carry out an analysis of all the rules of
interpretation provided in Art. 31 of the Vienna Convention, but merely indicated that there

was no disconnection clause and on that basis stated its conclusion.**°

Spain concludes that the Tribunal failed to state its reasons for admitting jurisdiction for

an investment arbitration within the EU.
b The NextEra Entities’ Position

The NextEra Entities submit that the Tribunal did provide reasons for upholding its

jurisdiction over intra-EU disputes.**!

To rebut Spain’s argument, the NextEra Entities explain that the Tribunal found that EU
law did not apply for the purpose of jurisdiction. Instead, the jurisdictional question was to

be determined under the ECT (Art. 26) and the ICSID Convention (Art. 25).°*?
The NextEra Entities conclude by saying:

On any analysis, the Tribunal therefore stated reasons for its
decision that the ECT and the ICSID Convention — rather than EU
law — provided the basis for determining its jurisdiction.**°

The Claimants cite Professor Piet Eeckhout’s expert opinion:

..Jn particular, Professor Eeckhout explains that: (i) the ECT
applies on an intra-EU basis; (ii) there is in fact no conflict between
the ECT and EU law; and (iii) even if such a conflict existed, it
would have to be resolved in favour of the ECT and international
law, not EU law, based on the express terms of Art. 16 of the ECT.***+

 

According to the NextEra Entities, Spain did not establish that the Tribunal failed to state

reasons for upholding jurisdiction over an intra-EU claim.**>
G The Committee’s Analysis

The Committee examines whether the Award failed to state reasons to uphold jurisdiction
to hear the dispute between an investor of an EU Member State and another EU Member
State under the ECT. The Committee finds that much of the reasoning in this section
overlaps with the analysis concerning Annulment Ground (g) in Section V.D(2), supra,

and that the Award stated its reasons in finding jurisdiction to hear the intra-EU dispute.

As provided in Section V.D(2), supra, the Tribunal first reviewed the earlier decisions from
other tribunals that upheld jurisdiction under Art. 26 of the ECT, the Achmea judgment,
and the observations of the EC.**° The Tribunal then considered whether the ECT applied
to relations inter se of EU Member States and whether the ECT intended to carve out and
exclude jurisdiction over intra-EU disputes.**’ The Tribunal analyzed Arts. 1(3) and 10 of
the ECT and noted in the absence of a “disconnection clause and a revision of the ECT” it
could not conclude that EU’s consenting to the ECT would supersede the consent given by
the EU Member States individually to the ECT.*** The Tribunal cited the reasoning of
Blusun vy. Italy to support its views and held it could not infer a carve-out to exclude intra-

EU disputes as Spain argued.

The Tribunal next reviewed whether the subsequent overlap that may exist between the
ECT and EU law regarding investment operations rendered Spain’s offer to arbitrate
invalid.** The Tribunal noted that it was not empowered to determine whether a dispute
under the ECT falls under the TFEU and instead held that the ECT was “the instrument
governing the present Tribunal’s jurisdiction”.*”° The Tribunal rejected Spain’s arguments
that any intra-EU obligations were superseded by subsequent treaties because it found the
treaties did not relate to the same subject matter under Art. 30 of the Vienna Convention.**!
As support, the Tribunal also cited Electrabel v. Hungary that “the ECT’s genesis generates
a presumption that no contradiction exists between the ECT and EU law”.* The Tribunal
concluded that it could not hold that “Spain's consent to submit ECT disputes to arbitration
excluded intra-EU investment disputes” and that “primacy of EU Law exclude[d]
jurisdiction of the present Tribunal established under the ECT’.*** The Tribunal therefore
rejected Spain’s argument based on the primacy of EU law over intra-EU disputes between

an investor and EU.

The Committee finds that the Award provided reasoning that can be followed in upholding
jurisdiction over an intra~-EU dispute under the ECT. The Committee holds that the
Tribunal provided reasoning for rejecting Spain’s intra-EU objection and that the Award
did not fail to state its reasons concerning intra-EU disputes. The Committee denies Spain’s

Application based on this ground.

(3) Failure to State Reasons for not Applying Applicable International Rules, the
ECT and EU law (Art. 52(1)(e)) (Annulment Ground (j))

a. Spain’s Position

Spain explains that Art. 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention states that an award must be

annulled if it fails to indicate the reasons on which it is based. Additionally, Spain holds

that pursuant to Art. 48(3) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal must deal with all matters

referred to it and state the reasons on which it bases its conclusions.>™4
314. Citing the Amco v. Indonesia I case, Spain points out the following:

... supporting reasons must be more than a matter of nomenclature
and must constitute an appropriate foundation for the conclusions
reached through such reasons. Stated a little differently, there must
be a reasonable connection between the bases invoked by a tribunal
and the conclusions reached by it.°*

315. Spain argues that the Tribunal rejected the application of EU law by denying it the character

of international law without giving any justification.*”°

316. In addition, Spain explains that according to Art. 26(6) of the ECT, arbitral tribunals must
apply the ECT and the applicable rules of international law which, according to Spain, lead

to the application of Art. 38 of the ICJ Statute.**”
317. Spain claims that:

..the Award, without justification or motivation, modifies the
International Law and invents a new rule of ‘international law’ by
pointing out that the rules of International Law apply only to the
extent relevant to (the) interpretation and application (of the
ECT)

b The NextEra Entities’ Position

318. The NextEra Entities again argue that Spain waived its claims under this ground based on
ICSID Arbitration Rule 27. Spain did not raise its objection promptly after receiving the

Tribunal’s Decision and prior to the Award.

Referring to the Micula v. Romania case, the NextEra Entities argue that the committee in

that case explained the threshold for establishing a failure to state reason by saying that:

The standard for annulment under Art. 52(1)(e) of the ICSID
Convention is, therefore, high. It does not permit an ad hoc
committee to second-guess the reasoning of the tribunal. It imposes
on the applicant the burden of proving that the reasoning of the
tribunal on a point that is essential for the outcome of the case was
either absent, unintelligible, contradictory or frivolous. To succeed,
the Applicant must discharge this burden?

In addition, they cite the Daimler v. Argentina case where it was held that:

...in reviewing the apparent contradictions, the ad hoc committee

should, to the extent possible and considering each case, prefer an

interpretation which confirms an award’s consistency as opposed to

its alleged inner contradictions.“
The NextEra Entities further argue that any objective reader would be able to follow the
Tribunal’s reasons. The Tribunal’s decision is reasoned because it recounts the Parties’
arguments and it is based on the express text of Art. 26(6) ECT, to which the Tribunal had

referred in the immediately preceding paragraphs.*”'

They claim that the Tribunal not only referred to the treaty text, but went further and
interpreted it. They point out that the Decision found that the reference to “applicable rules
and principles of international law” in Art. 26(6) meant “any rules of international law

relevant to [the ECT’s] interpretation and application” (emphasis added by the Claimants)

rather than “international law” at large or EU law.*
G The Committee’s Analysis

The Committee examines whether Spain demonstrated that the Award failed to provide

reasons concerning the applicable law and rules. Art. 26(6) of the ECT provides that “4

tribunal...shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable
rules and principles of international law”.* The Tribunal first summarized that the Parties
were largely in agreement that the applicable substantive law pursuant to Art. 26(6) of the
ECT was (i) the ECT substantive provisions; (ii) the Vienna Convention; and (iii)
“applicable rules and principles of international law” 4° The Tribunal then explained that

the Parties differed in their view on the relevance and weight of Spanish law and EU law.*°>

The Tribunal explained in its “Analysis” that “the applicable law is the ECT and any rules
of international law relevant to its interpretation and application”. The Tribunal added
that it will “refer to provisions of Spanish law and EU law if appropriate” “°° The Tribunal
concluded that “[t]heir particular weight and relevance will be assessed in this decision in

the context of the issues in respect of which they have been raised” .*°”

The Committee finds that the reasoning of the Award is based on the general agreement
between the Parties on the substantive law and the express text of Art. 26(6) of ECT. The
Committee finds the Tribunal provided reasons when determining the meaning of
“applicable rules and principles of international law” under Art. 26(6) and the relevance
and weight to be given to Spanish and EU law. The Tribunal explained that “applicable
rules and principles of international law” in Art. 26(6) meant “any rules of international
law relevant to [the ECT’s] interpretation and application’’***, The Tribunal therefore
distinguished between “rules of international law relevant to its [i.e. the ECT’s]
interpretation and application” and “Spanish law and EU law”. While the applicable law
was the “ECT and rules of international law relevant to its interpretation and application”,
the Tribunal would separately “refer” to Spanish and EU law “if appropriate”. The

Tribunal explained that how much “weight” and “relevance” Spanish and EU law would

be given would depend upon the “context of the issues in respect of which they have been

raised”.

The Committee agrees with the Claimants’ view that the Tribunal did not consider EU law
to be among the “rules of international law relevant to [the] interpretation and application”
of the ECT.*!° The Tribunal (i) dealt with each body of law in separate sentences; (ii)
placed EU law in the same category as Spanish law; (iii) found that EU law could be
“referred to” and “applied” or not “if appropriate”; and (iv) provided that “weight” and
“relevance” given to EU law would depend upon the “context of the issues in respect of
which they have been raised’. Spain itself admits that the Tribunal “devotes a single

paragraph to the analysis of the applicable law”.*"'

The Tribunal then separately referred to EU law to determine its potential application in
relation to intra-EU disputes under the ECT. In terms of EU law, the Tribunal explained
when addressing Spain’s intra-EU objection that “it is not the task of this Tribunal to
determine whether the scope of this dispute concerns the application of the TFEU, but
rather whether such dispute concerns the application of substantive provisions of the
ECT” .*"? As explained in Section V.E(2)c, supra, the Tribunal then held that the ECT
applies and EU law does not have primacy in an intra~-EU dispute. The Committee finds
that the Tribunal’s analysis on the applicable law provides reasons that could be followed

and grounds for annulment under Art. 52(1)(e) were not met.

Spain also challenges how the Tribunal interprets the ECT and its application of
international law and suggests that the Tribunal did not provide “justification or reasoning”
or “sufficient grounds”.*'> The Committee is not persuaded. As Spain concedes, the
Tribunal “devotes paragraphs 332 to 357 to try to justify the existence of jurisdiction to

know the intra-EU disputes”. *'+ The Committee concludes that these issues therefore were

covered in these paragraphs. The Tribunal did provide “justification or reasoning” and
“sufficient grounds” when it analyzed (1) whether the ECT applied to relations inter se of
EU Member States; (2) whether the ECT Contracting Parties intended to carve out and
exclude jurisdiction over intra-EU disputes; and (3) whether any subsequent overlap
between the ECT and EU law regarding investment operations rendered Spain’s offer to

arbitrate invalid.

Spain next cites the Tribunal’s failure to address the EU rules on State aid or the EC’s
decision.*!> The Committee finds that the Tribunal’s decision to reject the primacy of EU
law resulted in an umbrella that subsumed these issues, rendered them moot, and made it

unnecessary to “give reasons” or “even mention” them.+!°

Spain’s assertion that the reasoning of the Award contained “flaws and clumsiness” +!”

focuses on the adequacy and correctness of the Tribunal’s decision. These factors do not
constitute a basis for annulment under Art. 52(1)(e) as long as the reasoning could be

followed and was not contradictory or frivolous.

As provided in paragraph 126, supra, while Art. 48(3) of the ICSID Convention requires
an award to “deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal” this does not serve as a
ground for annulment.*!* Art. 52(1)(e) provides for annulment only when a failure to state
reasons exists. The test for the Committee is whether the reasoning could be followed. The
Tribunal did not have to address all of Spain’s assertions regarding the applicable

international law and rules.

The Committee observes that Spain finds fault with the Tribunal’s justification and the
adequacy of such justification. Yet, the correctness and adequacy of the Tribunal’s
justification do not qualify as annulment grounds under Art. 52(1)(e). The Committee

concludes that the Tribunal stated its reasons for determining the applicable law and how

EU law should apply. The reasoning could be followed and was not contradictory or

frivolous.

(4) Failure to State Reasons for its Conclusion on the Breach of Legitimate

Expectations (Art. 52(1)(e)) (Annulment Ground (1))
a. Spain’s Position

According to Spain, the NextEra Entities’ legitimate expectation claim was based on five
bases, four of which were dismissed by the Tribunal.*!? Spain asserts the Tribunal did not
explain how the Claimants could have had legitimate expectations of the petrification of

subsidies contrary to EU law and other applicable legislation.

Spain argues that “the [Tribunal’s] decision jumps from one conclusion to another without
being able to follow how one arrives at one”, “its paragraphs jump from one point to
another without reasoning”, and “in each conclusion” Spain can “find aspects that are
either unsubstantiated or frankly contradictory” .”° Spain blames the Tribunal’s reasoning

for its “absences and serious inconsistencies”.

Spain points out that the Tribunal found that “/egitimate expectations can exist in the

absence of actual formal commitment”.*?

Spain claims that this conclusion was in
complete disconnection with the Tribunal’s findings”? and that the Tribunal did not

explain its reasoning to arrive to such conclusion.*7*

336. Citing Continental v. Argentina,*> Charanne v. Spain,*® Isolux v. Spain,*”’ Stadtwerke v.
Spain,*® and PV Investors v. Spain,*”° Spain argues that the Award is contradictory

because absent “specific formal immutability commitments” there cannot be legitimate

expectations of immutability.*°

337. Spain reinforces its argument by saying that:

..such Tribunal affirmation, that in the absence of a formal
commitment to immutability in the regulatory framework or by the
Spanish authorities, may nevertheless raise legitimate expectations,
is not supported by sufficient and non-contradictory reasons offered
by the Court. And this affirmation is the substance on which the
declaration of liability against Spain hinges, so that it must be
annulled.*!

338. Spain concludes by saying that:

...the lack of expression of reasons is notable and the Decision does
not allow to follow the reasoning from Point A to B and now C: the
State retains the regulatory power to accommodate the regulation
to the economic situation for reasons of general interest (Point A),
a State for those same reasons cannot change the regulation
unexpectedly, altering essential characteristics of the regulation
(Point B), Spain has altered essential characteristics of its
regulation and that this also leads to point C that Spain has
consequently infringed the ECT.*?

b The NextEra Entities’ Position

On this point, the NextEra Entities explain that the Tribunal analyzed each of the sources

on which the NextEra Entities based their legitimate expectation claim.

The NextEra Entities also highlight that the Tribunal went on to explain why it was not
convinced that any of these arguments, viewed in isolation, were sufficient for the
expectation that the NextEra Entities would be guaranteed the terms of Regulatory

Framework 1.433
Nevertheless, it went on to say that the Tribunal found that these elements:

did ‘provide context for [the] claim’ that the final component

identified by the Claimants — i.e., the specific statements and

representations made to NextEra by Spanish officials — created

protected legitimate expectations.***
According to the NextEra Entities, the Tribunal thereby reasoned that the NextEra Entities
could not have had the expectation that the regime would remain frozen and could not be
changed. However, based on the assurances given by Spanish authorities, they had a
legitimate expectation that the regime would not be changed in a way that would undermine

the security and viability of their investment.*>

The NextEra Entities conclude by denying any contradiction in the Tribunal’s reasoning
and highlighting that the Tribunal found the regime was fundamentally and radically

changed, violating the NextEra Entities’ legitimate expectations.**°
G The Committee’s Analysis

The Committee finds that the test under Art. 52(1)(e) is not whether a tribunal’s decision
“jumps from one point to another without reasoning” but whether it can be “followed”

overall. A tribunal’s decision can “jump from one point to another without reasoning” as

long as the reader can follow how the tribunal’s reasoning proceeded from point to point.
The Committee also confirms that tribunals have discretion to decide on a legal standard

for legitimate expectations.

The Committee is not convinced by Spain’s contentions concerning the lack of reasoning.
First, the Committee does not find that the decision “jumps” from one point to the next
without reasoning in a manner that cannot be followed. The Committee finds that Spain’s
claim of a lack of reasoning pertaining to legitimate expectations concerns more the
adequacy and correctness of the reasoning. A reasonable reader can understand that the
Tribunal reached a finding on legitimate expectations based on the assurances and
representations that Spanish authorities made guaranteeing the security of the regulatory
framework that went beyond the immutability of legislation. In this regard, the Committee

finds that Tribunal met its “minimum requirement” to state reasons.**”

The Tribunal does not have to “strain every sinew” as Spain’s detailed analysis of the
Award would suggest.*** A committee’s mandate does not include assessing “the quality
or persuasiveness of reasons” and a committee may be “dissatisfied with the adequacy of
reasons, but provided they meet the conditions set out in MINE” the grounds under

Art. 52(1)(e) will not be met.*”

The Committee disagrees with Spain that the lack of “reasonable and sufficient

2441

explanations” ,“° lack of “understandable”! reasoning, “flaws in the findings”,*”? failure

to “develop [an] idea in order to clear...doubts” “8

and “ambiguities” would qualify for
an application under Art. 52(1)(e). These factors would call upon the Committee to

consider the merits in the manner of an appeal, which is beyond its mandate.

The Committee holds that “serious inconsistencies” could constitute grounds under
Art. 52(1)(e) but only if they reached the level of being “contradictions” that led to an
absence of reasons.**° An assessment of whether such inconsistencies existed could only
be conducted to determine if they amounted to contradictory reasons that cancelled each
other. An inquiry beyond that would fall prey to the slippery slope of an impermissible

inquiry into the adequacy and correctness of the reasoning.

The ad hoc committee’s mandate under Art. 52(1)(e) does not include a reassessment of
the Tribunal’s analysis of the evidence and the weight and significance it placed on the
evidence. The ad hoc Committee’s mandate does not include how the Tribunal determined
(1) whether the statements that the Spanish authorities made amounted to guarantees of
security; (2) whether the Claimants conducted due diligence; (3) how other tribunals
treated the regulatory changes; (4) how to treat the jurisprudence of the Spanish Supreme
Court; and (5) whether the assurances were made to a legal entity different from the
Claimants. The fact that the letters were characterized as being “from a Spanish minister”

instead of a “Secretario de Estado” is similarly at most a “mistake” and an error of fact.*4°

The Committee does not find any contradictions or “antinomy”**’ to sustain a basis for an
application under Art. 52(1)(e). The Committee notes that Spain also based its Application
under Art. 52(1)(e) on the existence of frivolous reasons but does not fully elaborate this

basis.“8

Spain’s claims are more a dissatisfaction with the adequacy, correctness, and quality of the
reasons, which, however fair the criticisms might be, would not form the basis for the “/ack

of reasons” ground.

The Committee agrees with the Claimants that the Tribunal rejected the Claimant’s primary

claim and did not find legitimate expectations based on the petrification of the subsidies.

The Tribunal stated that it was “not convinced that in the circumstances of the present case
the mere fact of Regulatory Framework I was a sufficient basis for the expectation that
Claimants would be guaranteed the terms of Regulatory Framework I. The Framework
was based on legislation and legislation can be changed”.* The Tribunal held that the
Claimants could not have any legitimate expectations concerning the petrification of
subsidies solely based on the immutability of legislation itself. Under these circumstances,
contrary to Spain’s assertions, the Tribunal did not have to determine whether “there may
be a legitimate expectation that the legal framework would not be amended” even though
the “the legal framework [did] not have any immutability clause”.**° The Committee finds
that the Tribunal’s rejection of the primary claim does not contradict finding legitimate
expectation based on the separate assurances of the Spanish authorities concerning the

regulatory framework.**!

The Committee finds that the Tribunal did provide reasoning on this point. The Tribunal
explained that the various statements and assurances by the Spanish authorities might not
have been “actual formal commitments” but considered that the “question [wa]s whether
what was said could reasonably give rise to expectations about the future conduct of the

government” 4°?

The Tribunal elaborated that the specific assurances of a Spanish minister
could “reasonably be taken as statements that the Spanish government had no intention of
making significant changes to the investment regime...and that this could be relied on by
an investor”.* Spain claims that the Decision does not “clearly identify the content” of
the Claimants’ legitimate expectations and does not “analyse each of the disputed measures
under the prism of the FET standard’.*** The Committee finds that the Tribunal stated its
reasoning that specific assurances could lead to legitimate expectations even though they

were not formal commitments. The Tribunal provided reasons when finding that legitimate

expectations could exist, particularly in the “absence of actual formal commitment’. The

Committee does not agree with Spain that “this assertion is not reasoned”.*>

Spain also claims that this assertion “remains unjustified’, but this would not be a basis for
annulment under Art. 52(1)(e).*°° For instance, whether other tribunal’s “stated the
opposite” and reached contrary conclusions goes to the correctness of the reasoning not the
lack of it.4°’ The Committee finds that Spain is ultimately challenging the correctness of

the Tribunal’s reasoning, which cannot be the basis for an application under Art. 52(1)(e).

The Committee concludes that, given the reasoning that the Tribunal provided, the

Applicant’s assertion of failure to state reasons based on Art. 52(1)(e) cannot be sustained.

(5) Failure to State Reasons Regarding the Date of Investment (Art. 52(1)(e))
(Annulment Ground (m))

a. Spain’s Position

Spain claims that the Tribunal failed to decide the date on which the purported investment

was made, which was a matter disputed by the Parties during the proceedings.

Spain considers that the investment date is a key issue for a “motivated analysis” of the

Claimants’ expectation.*** Spain states as follows:

The Kingdom of Spain considered that FPL had made its alleged
investment in April 2011. However, the Claimants stated that the
investment was made in December 2010.4

Spain alleges that the failure of the Tribunal to rule upon this “fundamental issue in

2460

dispute”*®” constituted a violation to Art. 48 of the ICSID Convention and constituted

grounds for annulment of the Award under Art. 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.**!

Spain asserts that while the Award reflects the Parties’ positions it does not state who is
right and why. Spain contends that the date of the investment was relevant for liability or
quantum because it acts as the date from which an investor’s legitimate expectations may

be assessed.4

b The NextEra Entities’ Position

The NextEra Entities deny that the Tribunal failed to determine when the NextEra Entities’
investment was made. However, even if this were a valid argument, it holds that Spain
waived this claim long ago in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 27 as it was not
promptly raised after receiving the Decision and prior to the Award.* The NextEra
Entities explain that Spain never raised this alleged lack of decision until it filed for
annulment of the Award, which cannot be considered to be a “prompt?” objection on Spain’s

part as provided under ICSID Arbitration Rule 27.4

The NextEra Entities argue that Spain’s arguments are a challenge to the correctness of the
Decision and its appreciation of the evidence, rather than a failure to state reasons or to

decide when the investment took place.**

In any case, they contend that the Award was not silent on the date of the investment
because it expressly recorded the Parties’ respective positions on the issue and included

express findings of fact that referred to the investment.**°

The NextEra Entities add that the date of the investment was not relevant for liability or
quantum as the Tribunal found that the NextEra Entities could not have expected the
regime to remain unchanged, but nevertheless could expect that there would be no radical

changes made to the economic regime.*”
G The Committee’s Analysis

The Committee examines whether Spain has established that the Tribunal failed to state

reasons concerning the date of the investment.

The Tribunal did make findings of fact as to how and when the Claimants’ investment was
made and was not silent on the issue of the investment date.‘ At the same time, the
Committee agrees with Spain that the Tribunal did not make a determination about the
exact investment date that was disputed between the Parties. The passages in the Decision
that the Claimants cite as examples where the Tribunal provided reasons consist of only

summaries of the Parties’ respective positions.*”

Nevertheless, the Committee ultimately determines that whether the investment date was
December 2010, as the Claimants argued, or April 2011, as the Applicant argued, does not
affect the finding on legitimate expectations in this case. The Committee notes that neither
investment date would have affected the Tribunal’s finding on legitimate expectations.
Both dates were related to the Claimants’ primary claim that was dismissed, but not the

alternative claim that the Tribunal adopted.

Under these circumstances, the Committee does not consider that it was “relevant or
necessary” to rule on this issue. Even if the Tribunal failed to state reasons on the
investment date, it would not qualify as a ground for annulment because it was not relevant

or necessary. As TECO v. Guatemala explains:

[i]nsufficiency of reasons is not a ground for annulment where a
tribunal did not explain why it rejected arguments, evidence or
authorities that were not relevant or necessary for its

analysis...Similarly, insufficiency of reasons does not warrant
annulment if the tribunal did not address every argument, piece of
evidence or authority in the record...Similarly, ‘inadequate’
reasons may justify annulment only if they cannot logically explain
the decision they are purportedly supporting.*”

 

The Committee concludes that the Applicant’s claims based on the investment date cannot

be sustained under Art. 52(1)(e).

(6) Failure to State Reasons for its Conclusion on Liability (Art. 52(1)(e))
(Annulment Ground (n))

a. Spain’s Position
Spain claims the following:

...the NextEra Tribunal has not sufficiently reasoned: (1) neither

Article 10(1) ECT nor the interpretation that should be given to it in

accordance with the Vienna Convention; (2) the alleged breaches

by the Kingdom of Spain of the applicable standards and

regulations...*"'
Spain argues that the Tribunal failed to examine the standards contained in Art. 10(1) of
the ECT which, according to the NextEra Entities, were violated.*” In particular, Spain
considers that there is a lack of reasons on the Tribunal’s decision not to carry out an
analysis of the alleged breached of Art. 10 of the ECT after finding the “alleged breach of
legitimate expectations as an integral part of the Fair and Equitable Treatment” +?
Spain claims that the Tribunal did not conduct any analysis on the “concept of legitimate
expectations, its application by arbitral jurisprudence, its configuration, content, and
scope”.*” The Tribunal only cited one prior investment treaty award when discussing

legitimate expectations.

As a result, according to Spain, it is not possible to verify whether such reasoning was
correct or not and whether it was “well applied in relation to the facts” of the case,
preventing Spain from rebutting what the Tribunal considered when deciding on Spain’s

liability, 475

b The NextEra Entities’ Position
The NextEra Entities start by saying that:

Annulment is not a forum for correcting an allegedly ‘flawed
application of Article 10(1) of the ECT’. Nor is annulment
concerned with whether the reasoning in an award is ‘valid’. Even
less so can an annulment committee determine what should have
been ‘the content of [the NextEra Entities’] legitimate expectations’

(which is a fact-driven inquiry) or second-guess the Tribunal’s

‘assessment of the disputed measures’.*7°

The NextEra Entities recall that Spain has waived these arguments by virtue of ICSID
Arbitration Rule 27, because they arose from a claim that the Tribunal failed to state
reasons when issuing the Decision. Spain should therefore have raised its objections

promptly upon receipt of the Decision and before the Award.*77

The NextEra Entities explain that the Tribunal summarized the Parties’ views on the legal
standard contained in Art. 10(1) of the ECT, including legitimate expectations. Under the
heading “The Standard in Article 10(1) of the ECT’, the Tribunal explained its views on
the scope of that article. The NextEra Entities further hold that Tribunal’s analysis clearly

allows a reader to follow its reasoning.*”*

The NextEra Entities conclude that Spain is trying to expand the scope of the annulment
proceeding to re-argue the case and has not established that the Award failed to state

reasons when finding liability.*”

G The Committee’s Analysis

The Committee examines whether Spain met the grounds for annulment based on the

Award’s failure to state reasons concerning Spain’s liability under the ECT.

The Committee notes that the Tribunal first sought to analyze and interpret Art. 10(1) of
the ECT in accordance with Arts. 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention by “/ook[ing] at the
words used in Article 10 in their context and in light of the object and purpose of the treaty
as a whole” .**° The Tribunal found that based on the words of Art. 10(1) it was a “broad-
ranging provision”.**' It then determined that “the protection of legitimate expectations
[wa]s an essential element of the provision of fair and equitable treatment” under Art. 104°”
and that it served as the legal basis for Spain’s liability.**> The Tribunal explained that the
source and content of the Claimants’ legitimate expectations were the assurances given by
the Spanish authorities. The other factors such as the terms of the Regulatory Framework I,
the registration of the Termosol Plants in the Pre-Assignment Registry and in the
Administrative Registry for Production Facilities under the Special Regime (RAIPRE), and
the Ministerial Resolutions of 28 December 2010 provided “context”.*** The Tribunal then
described how Spain breached those expectations through the “substantial” changes to the

economic regime under Regulatory Framework III.*85

The Committee can clearly follow the Award’s reasoning from “Point A. to Point B.” on
how the Tribunal reached its decision on legitimate expectations based on Art. 10(1).4%°
The Committee finds that the Tribunal did interpret Art. 10 in accordance with Arts. 31
and 32 of the Vienna Convention to determine the scope and content of legitimate

expectations as part of the fair and equitable treatment standard.**”

380. The Tribunal provided reasons that could be followed. Tribunals are not required to address
every argument that the parties raise and the adequacy and correctness of reasons do not
serve as a basis for annulment. Overall, the Committee concludes that Tribunal did not fail
to provide reasons when finding Spain liable for a breach of legitimate expectation under
Art, 10(1) of the ECT.

(7) Failure to State Reasons Regarding the Quantification of Damages
(Art. 52(1)(e)) (Annulment Ground (0))

a. Spain’s Position
381. In connection with this point, Spain argues that:

...the reasons for the annulment of the Award in relation to quantum
are as follows:

a.- There is a clear inconsistency between the principles of the
decision on quantum and the amount of damages awarded; and

b.- There is a lack reasoning in the Award related to several issues
that have significant impact on quantum: the capitalisation of
historical damages, the 200 bps premium above the WACC granted,
and the effective tax conversion rate.**8
382. Spain further recalls that the NextEra Entities’ experts on quantum departed from the
instructions given by the Tribunal when calculating damages for the period that went from

2014-2019,4%°

383. Spain concludes that the Tribunal did not adopt Compass Lexecon’s approach and that
Compass Lexecon’s quantification is inconsistent with the quantum principles set forth in
the Decision. This includes the capitalization of historical losses until the valuation date of

30 June 2016, the regulatory rate of return in the actual scenario, the magnitude of the 200

bps premium of the WACC, and the tax rate to convert the reasonable rate of return into a

pre-tax return.*”° Therefore, the Award should be annulled.

384. Spain adds that it did not confirm that it agreed with Compass Lexecon’s approach or that
it had no criticism with the Decision and Award when it did not claim anything when
questioned by the Tribunal. Spain only confirmed that Compass Lexecon’s calculation was

“mathematically” correct.*”!
b The NextEra Entities’ Position

385. The NextEra Entities recall the scope of annulment proceedings and that Spain is trying to
re-argue the case.**? The Claimants reiterate their general waiver argument and claim that

Spain has failed to address this.

386. They first contend that the Award did not have any “inconsistencies” with the decision on

liability and the approach to quantum, as Spain claims.

387. They also explain that the Tribunal provided ample reasons for its determination of
damages and that the approach to quantum was entirely consistent with the Tribunal’s
findings on liability by using an “alternative but-for scenario”.* The Tribunal covered
the capitalization of historical losses, the regulatory return in the actual scenario, the

magnitude of the 200-bps premium above the WACC, and the nominal tax rate.

388. The NextEra Entities recall that the Tribunal instructed them to re-calculate their damages
claim following the principles that the Tribunal set forth in its Decision. As a result, the
NextEra Entities submitted their calculations, amounting to EUR 290.6 million (excluding

interest) as of 30 June 2016, to which Spain replied it had “no observations on the

 

h ical lations of the Clai ’ recalculation of their dc claim” +

Spain was allowed to comment on the Claimants’ re-calculated damages but it did not

disagree or raise any concerns with the rate used.
G The Committee’s Analysis

The Committee examines whether the Tribunal failed to state reasons concerning damages.
As an initial matter, the Committee reiterates that it agrees with the general consensus that
exists among committees that tribunals have a wide margin of appreciation to assess the

parties’ positions on damages and determine a reasonable approximation of damages.*”

Spain initially argues that the Award has inconsistencies between the quantum decision
and the damages awarded concerning the WACC and the 200-bps premium granted in the
but-for scenario. Spain reiterates its argument regarding the appropriate investment date to
be used for the WACC that was made under Annulment Ground (m) in Section V.E(5)a,
supra. As provided in Section V.E(5)c, supra, the Committee does not find a clear
inconsistency that could be considered a contradiction or lack of reasoning concerning

damages.

Spain claims that the Award failed to state reasons concerning the capitalization of
historical damages, the benchmark of reasonable return used in the Actual Scenario, the
200-bps premium added to the WACC reference, and the effective tax conversion rate.

First, Spain claims that the Tribunal included the Claimants’ damages experts’ “incorrect
quantification” of the capitalization of historical damages that should have included a risk-
free rate instead of the cost of equity used.*°° The Committee considers that even if the

quantification was, as Spain argues, incorrect it would not constitute an annullable error.

Second, Spain argues that the experts did not agree on the benchmark for reasonable return
used in the Actual Scenario and the Tribunal “overlooked” this and did not “substantiate[]

its decision” for choosing the rate proposed by the Claimants’ experts.*”” The Committee

finds that the Tribunal chose the benchmark that Compass Lexecon proposed and stated its
reasons for doing so. It explained that it chose the model because it was “based on a
calculation of the value of the assets and a reasonable return on that value” and was “an

appropriate method for valuation of loss in this case” 4°

393. Third, Spain asserts that the Tribunal failed to state the reasons why it chose to add a
200-bps premium to the WACC reference. As described in paragraph 277 in Section
V.D(5)c, supra, the Committee finds that the Tribunal provided reasons in choosing a
premium of 200 bps instead of 300 bps.*”? Spain’s argument that the Tribunal did not
“specifically justif[y] its decision to adopt the 200 basis points” is not convincing.*°°
Spain’s suggestion that it would have been more “appropriate” to have granted a premium
between 0 and 100 bps is not a ground for annulment.*°!

394. Fourth, Spain submits that the Tribunal failed to state reasons concerning the use of a
nominal tax rate over an effective tax conversion rate that was disputed among the experts.
Spain also claims that the Tribunal “simply accepted” the Claimants’ experts’ position.*°?
The Committee does not agree with Spain that not mentioning its expert’s view and not
providing the reason for rejecting those views would necessarily qualify as grounds for
annulment. The key factor is whether the Tribunal provided reasons for its decision on the
nominal tax rate. Furthermore, the Committee finds that the Tribunal did consider Spain’s
expert’s view and did provide reasons for rejecting it. The Tribunal provided reasons for
its decision by stating that it “took account of the fact that the statement of Compass
Lexecon that the use of the nominal rate is ‘accepted regulatory practice’ was not
contradicted by Respondent and noted the difficulty of calculating an ‘effective rate’ for
each year”.* The Tribunal provided reasoning when it explained that it adopted an

“accepted regulatory practice”.** The Tribunal considered the view of Spain’s experts in

that they chose not to dispute that the use of the nominal rate was an “accepted regulatory
practice” and also explained that a reason for rejecting the Spanish experts’ view was the

difficulty of calculating an effective rate for each year.

The Committee concludes that the Tribunal did not fail to state reasons concerning the

quantification damages, as Spain claims.

(8) Failure to State Reasons in Relation to the Evidentiary Activity and the
Assessment of Evidence (Art. 52(1)(e)) (Annulment Ground (s))

a. Spain’s Position

Spain asserts a failure to state reasons based on its claim under Annulment Ground (r) in
Section V.F(2), infra. Spain argues that pursuant to Art. 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention,
the Award must be annulled for its failure to state reasons pertaining to the evidentiary
activity and the assessment of evidence, including regarding the burden of proof, both in

terms of its incorporation and in terms of its assessment.

Spain submits that the Award relies on reasons “not properly explained’,*®> that its
“argument{s] [are] not understood”,*° that it “does not analyse”,**’ that it reveals a
“blatant absence of any reference to the evidentiary activity carried out in the oral
hearing”,*®® that it “does not make any assessment of such evidence”,*® and that it
“lack{s]...valid reasons”.*'° The Award “without any reasons, place[d] on Spain the
negative consequences of (allegedly) not carrying out evidential work on a question” that
was the Claimants’ burden to prove.*!! The Applicant submits that the Tribunal kept “an

absolute silence in relation to a whole array of evidences”, including “many internal

documents” of the Claimants, “[t]he normative evolution of the regulatory framework prior

to the alleged investment”, and the “numerous Rulings by the of [sic] Supreme Court” >!

b The NextEra Entities’ Position

The Claimants deny the Applicant’s assertions and submit that the Tribunal did state
reasons in this regard. The Claimants dealt with this ground together with Annulment

Ground (r).

Regarding Spain’s burden of proof argument, the Claimants submit that it was “plainly not
a reversal of the burden of proof’.*'? The Tribunal’s decision was based on Spain’s
election not to both adduce any witness testimony from its own officials who provided the
alleged assurances and cross-examine the Claimants’ witnesses.°'* This was “a classic
instance of a tribunal evaluating the evidence and (in this case) finding that it was

unrebutted”.*'> The Claimants submit that this was an “entirely reasonable finding”!

The Claimants point out that the Tribunal “stated the reasons on which its decision was
based” and “was not required to explain why it did not refer to any particular witness

statement or factual exhibit in its analysis of liability”.>\7

G The Committee’s Analysis

The Committee examines whether the Applicant established that the Tribunal failed to state
reasons in relation to the evidentiary activity and the assessment of evidence pursuant to

Art. 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.

Spain presented its claims based on these grounds together with its claim under Annulment

Ground (r) in Section V.F(2), infra. The NextEra Entities largely rebutted both grounds

together.*'® The Committee concludes that considerable overlap exists in its analysis under

the present ground and Annulment Ground (r).

As an initial matter, the Committee agrees with the Claimants that Art. 52(1)(e) does not
require a tribunal to state why it has not referred to any individual piece of written or oral
fact evidence. The Tribunal was not required to provide reasons as to why it did not refer
to all of the evidentiary activity carried out at the Hearing such as Mr. Montoya’s evidence.
As provided in Enron v. Argentina, “a tribunal is not required to comment on all arguments
of the parties in relation to each of the questions that it decides”.*!° The Committee
similarly agrees with Rumeli v. Kazakh that “[t]he C ittee is neither emp ed
nor competent to conduct a re-evaluation of the significance of the factual evidence
weighed by the Tribunal” .° The evaluation of the significance of factual evidence is a

realm for the Tribunal.

Hence, the Committee agrees that an award cannot be annulled because it did not state
reasons concerning all of the evidentiary activity and assessment of evidence. The
Committee finds that the Applicant has not established that the Award could not be

“followed”, or was “contradictory”, “frivolous” or rendered “unintelligible” due to the

Tribunal’s failure to address certain evidentiary activity or to assess particular evidence.*”!

The Committee finds that the Award did state the reasons on which it was based concerning
the evidentiary activity and assessment of evidence and therefore the Committee dismisses

Spain’s argument that this constituted an annullable ground under Art. 52(1)(e).

(9) Failure to State Reasons when Admitting an Alleged Erroneous Translation

(Art. 52(1)(e)) (Annulment Ground (v))
a. Spain’s Position

Spain claims that pursuant to Art. 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, the Award must be
annulled given the Tribunal was “silent on the claim and evidence made by the Kingdom

of Spain at this point” concerning false and fraudulent translation of Exhibit C-006.*??

Spain’s claim focuses on how the words “se realizaron” in the sentence “Jas inversiones
en marcha, garantizando por tanto las perspectivas bajo las que se realizaron dichas
inversiones” were translated. (emphasis added). For the translation of the tense of the verb

“se realizaron”, as “are to be made” instead of “were made”, Spain submits that the

Claimants’ “misrepresentation [was] very serious and seems clearly intended”.*» Spain

argues that the “clear error” in translation was “identical to that of falsehood and fraud” .>*+
The translation made a huge difference and was a bad faith attempt to gain protection for

future investments.

Spain claims that “the Award is based on the document whose translation (in front of
interpreters) is discussed as the basis for the given Award”.**> Despite this, the Tribunal
“completely disregarded any consideration of this matter and used in its deliberation” and

“did not even rule on this matter” and failed to state reasons accordingly.**°
b The NextEra Entities’ Position

The NextEra Entities assert that Spain has waived the right to challenge the translation of
Exhibit C-006 under ICSID Arbitration Rule 27 as it was part of the record of the
proceeding from the very outset of the case when it was filed with the Claimants’ Request

for Arbitration. Spain even devoted a specific section of its Counter-Memorial on the

Merits to the exhibit that never questioned the accuracy of the English translation. Spain

only raised an objection to the translation for the first time during its oral closing.*”’

The Claimants submit that a debate on the translation would not have had any impact on
the proceedings.*** According to the Claimants, the Applicant’s revised translation would
still serve as evidence of the Claimants’ legitimate expectations. The Claimants add that
the Tribunal placed no particular emphasis on the phrases the Applicant claimed were

incorrect.°7°

Furthermore, the Claimants contend that the translation of the Spanish verb “realizaron”
as “are to be made” was entirely legitimate in the context of the sentence in which it
appears. They also point out that Spain never filed its own translation or requested a
certified translation as provided under Procedural Order No. 1 of the underlying arbitration

(“PO1-A”) in the case of a dispute in the translation.**°
G The Committee’s Analysis

The Committee examines whether the Tribunal failed to state reasons by not ruling on the

translation issue concerning Exhibit C-006.

The Committee takes note that Spain did not object to the translation even though it was
used in an exhibit that was part of the Claimants’ Request for Arbitration in May 2014.**!
Spain did not challenge the translation until its closing argument on the last day of the
underlying arbitration in December 2016 when it stated it should have been the
“perspective — not the forecast but the perspective — under which said investments were
made”’.>*? In response to the Claimants’ objection that the Applicant belatedly raised the

translation issue, the Applicant replied thereafter that “[t]he last point I wanted to talk about

was the translation of the English word ‘forecast’ into Spanish. We don’t have anything to
add to that. I apologise. I certainly don’t want to reopen the debate, Mr President” .>**
Spain never even requested a certified translation through the procedure established for
disputed translations under PO1-A. Spain apparently did not raise the translation issue in
any of its written post-hearing submissions, including its 27 February 2017 Post-Hearing
Submission or its 8 March 2017 Post-Hearing Reply. Even after receiving the Tribunal’s
Decision, which stated the Tribunal’s reliance upon the exhibit, Spain still did not raise any

issues regarding the translation.

Under these circumstances, the Committee agrees with the Claimants that the Applicant
waived its right to challenge this procedural matter as provided under ICSID Arbitration
Rule 27 by not “promptly” objecting to it. Spain was aware of the document from the onset
of the arbitration. Spain’s awareness of the document is confirmed because it even raised
its own arguments based on the document. It never challenged the translation under the
procedures stipulated under PO1-A. It raised the translation issue over two and a half years
after the document in question was submitted. This can hardly be considered as “promptly”
objecting as required under ICSID Arbitration Rule 27. Furthermore, after raising the issue
for the first time, it appeared to withdraw its concern about the translation overall when
responding to Claimants’ objection by stating, “[w]e don’t have anything to add to that
[the translation of ‘forecast’]. J apologise. I certainly don’t want to reopen the debate” .**
It did not mention any issue with the tense used in the translation and did not make any
reservations when withdrawing its concerns.*** Thereafter, the Applicant never raised the

translation issue even after receiving the Decision that relied upon the exhibit.

The Committee holds that disputes concerning a translation of a document, particularly one
that existed from the beginning of a proceeding, are a procedural matter concerning a

“rule[]...applicable to the proceeding” under ICSID Arbitration Rule 27. The Applicant

waived any basis to present its Application on the translation issue because it “fail[ed] to

state promptly its objection” pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 27.

Irrespective of the waiver under ICSID Arbitration Rule 27, the Committee also finds that
it was not necessary for the Tribunal to state any reasons concerning the translation issue
because the Applicant appeared to withdraw the issue overall at the hearing without
reservation and did not present it before the Tribunal thereafter. The Tribunal reasonably

considered the issue was withdrawn.

Hence, the Applicant waived its rights to bring a claim on this basis and the Tribunal did

not fail to state reasons when using the translation by not ruling on this matter.

SPAIN’S ALLEGATIONS AS TO VIOLATIONS OF FUNDAMENTAL RULES OF PROCEDURE

qd) Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure Regarding Late

Submissions (Art. 52(1)(d)) (Annulment Ground (q))
a. Spain’s Position

Spain claims that pursuant to Art. 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention, an award must be
annulled if there is a serious deviation from a fundamental procedural rule. Spain explains

that:

A departure is serious if a party is deprived of the protection
afforded by the relevant procedural rule. A procedural rule is
fundamental if it refers to the essential impartiality that must govern
all proceedings and is included within the minimum standards of
‘due process’ required by international law.>*°

Spain further explains that:

..ifa Tribunal quotes a lack of evidence as the basis for its decision,
and it has previously refused requests to submit documents to
constitute said evidence, there could be a serious departure from
rules of procedure.*"

Spain further recalls the berdrola v. Guatemala case where the following was decided,

This Committee understands that a fundamental rule of procedure
is one that establishes a minimum procedural standard that must be
respected in accordance with international law, as defined in Wena
Hotels v. Egypt. In general, the following hypotheses have been
recognized as a violation of fundamental rules: (i) the lack of
impartiality and unequal treatment of the parties, (ii) the violation
of the right to be heard, (iii) the absence or abuse of deliberation by
the arbitrators; (iv) the violation of the rules of proof and (v) the
violation of the rules of legal standing.***

Spain explains that the Tribunal accepted the NextEra Entities’ reply on the merits despite
being filed late and in violation of PO1-A. According to Spain, the Tribunal explained that
the late submission would not have any consequences in terms of admission but could have

consequences in terms of costs.**?

In addition, Spain argues that this violation was obvious and decisive for the result because:

..there is no doubt that we speak of violations that affect the
pretension, the amount claimed and the reports and witnesses on
which the claim and the amount are based.**°

b The NextEra Entities’ Position

The NextEra Entities explain that Art. 52(1)(d) provides that parties may request annulment
of an award on the ground “that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental

rule of procedure” .*4!

Referring to the MINE v. Guinea case “[t]he text of Article 52(1)(d) makes clear that not

every departure from a rule of procedure justifies annulment; it requires that the departure

be a serious one and that the rule of procedure be fundamental in order to constitute a

 

ground for annulment”>” (emphasis in original).

Furthermore, the NextEra Entities highlight that the committee in MINE v. Guinea held

that the term “serious” “establishes both quantitative and qualitative criteria: the

departure must be substantial and be such as to deprive a party of the benefit or protection

which the rule was intended to provide” *°

Moreover, the Wena Hotels v. Egypt committee elaborated on this standard by saying that:

[i]n order to be a ‘serious’ departure from a fundamental rule of
procedure, the violation of such a rule must have caused the
Tribunal to reach a result substantially different from what it would
have awarded had such a rule been observed.“

Therefore, the NextEra Entities argue that:

Ifa breach of a fundamental rule has no material impact, even if it

deprived a party of the benefit it was intended to provide, then it can

hardly be considered to be so serious as to require the exceptional

remedy of annulment.**
In connection with Spain’s argument, the NextEra Entities explain that the Tribunal
admitted its Reply on the Merits 55 minutes after the relevant deadline and also permitted
the NextEra Entities to file a supplemental quantum report nine days later, but these
examples do not meet the threshold of a serious violation of fundamental rule of

procedure. *°

The NextEra Entities also argue that in any case Spain has waived this argument as it did

not raise it until it filed its Application.*4”

Finally, the NextEra Entities refer to the Tribunal’s decision dated 17 August 2016 where,
after the hearing, it held that failing to meet deadlines can be considered in the

determination of costs but does not affect the admissibility of documents filed.***

G The Committee’s Analysis

The Committee confirms that Spain withdrew its Application based on this ground at the

Hearing.” The Committee therefore holds that this ground need not be considered.

(2) Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure in Relation to the
Evidentiary Activity and Assessment of Evidence (Art. 52(1)(d) (Annulment
Ground (r))

a. Spain’s Position

Spain asserts that the Tribunal committed a series of breaches in relation to “evidential
activity and the assessment of evidence”. Such violations breached the rules of evidence
(and in particular the rules on the burden of proof), the right to be heard, and the right to

equality of arms.>°°

Spain claims this ground for annulment based on the Claimants’ concealment of essential
documents, the Tribunal’s practice in the hearing, and the Tribunal’s other lack of
assessment of the evidence submitted. In terms of Claimant’s concealment of essential
documents, Spain argues that the Tribunal’s denial of access and use of documents relevant
to Spain’s defense and its refusal to order the submission of documents violated Spain’s
right to be heard.**! Spain argues that on several occasions, the Tribunal pointed out the
relevance of the NextEra Entities’ due diligence reports concerning the regulatory
framework under which they made their investment.*°? The NextEra Entities opposed the

production of the due diligence reports alleging attorney-client privilege or attorney work

product. The Tribunal “ignore[d] the lack of evidence” and denied the production of the
documents holding that the request was “too broad”.** Spain claims that the Tribunal
ignored “the lack of evidence derived from failure to provide legal reports” and ignored
Péyry’s report provided by the NextEra Entities, which was “incompatible with any
legitimate expectation of the immutability of the system”.*°4 By ignoring the lack of

evidence, it violated the rules on the burden of proof.**°

In terms of the Tribunal’s practice in the hearing, Spain submits that the Tribunal violated
the rules of the burden of proof, by not complying with the principle of onus probandi
incumbit actori and extracting negative inferences from the lack of questions by Spain
concerning two witnesses.**° The Tribunal unlawfully reversed the burden of proof. Spain
claims that the Tribunal did not examine and assess the content of the statements made by
the witnesses or experts and did not “refer[ ] to the evidentiary activity carried out at the
hearing”, particularly Mr. Carlos Montoya’s testimony, in violation of the right to be

heard.*57

In terms of the Tribunal’s other lack of assessment of the evidence, Spain explains that on
numerous occasions the Tribunal did not consider documentary evidence that negated any
legitimate expectation, such as: (i) the possibility of rule change was expressly reflected in
various agreements signed by the Claimants and the Claimants’ own internal documents
and emails; (ii) the existence, prior to the investments, of multiple modifications to the
legal framework showing that the Claimants knew that the legal framework was not
petrified; (iii) the Péyry report, submitted by the NextEra Entities, highlighted those
modifications, and showing the NextEra Entities were aware of them; and (iii) the Supreme
Court’s judgment, which was also provided, where it was decided that no one could claim

to have a right to the immutability of tariffs.**

This series of breaches infringed Spain’s right of defense in the form of the right to be
heard. The violations, both individually and as a whole, are of the necessary magnitude to

have had a clear impact on the Award and warrant annulment.
b The NextEra Entities’ Position

The NextEra Entities recall the high threshold contained in Art. 52(1)(d) and argue that

Spain did not meet it.

In particular, the NextEra Entities explain that the Tribunal was entitled to exercise its
discretion by not ordering the disclosure of documents and that privilege is widely
recognized as a ground to refuse disclosure of documents. In addition, the NextEra Entities

allege they provided adequate and substantial evidence regarding their due diligence.*?

Relying on Azurix v. Argentina, the NextEra Entities highlight that the committee decided

the following:

...@ party cannot, simply by requesting the tribunal to call upon the
other party to produce documents which are said to be relevant to a
particular allegation, mandate the tribunal either to require the
production of those documents or to accept the truth of the
allegation in default of production...Regardless of whether or not
the tribunal decides to call upon a party to produce documents, it
will decide all of the issues on the basis of the evidence before it.
However, the fact that the tribunal decides to exercise its discretion
one way rather than the other cannot in itself be annullable error.
To establish an annullable error, it is not sufficient to show that the
tribunal rejected repeated requests for the production of evidence
that the requesting party considered crucial to its case. Rather, it is
necessary to establish that, in all circumstances there has been a
serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.*©

Regarding Spain’s burden of proof argument, the Claimants submit that it was “plainly not
a reversal of the burden of proof’.*°' The Tribunal’s decision was based on Spain’s

election not to adduce any witness testimony from its own officials who provided the

alleged assurances or cross-examine the Claimants’ witnesses. This was “a classic instance

of a tribunal evaluating the evidence and (in this case) finding that it was unrebutted” °°

The Claimants submit that this was an “entirely reasonable finding” °°

The Claimants submit that the lack of congruence cannot serve as a basis for annulment

per se.>* Spain has not provided a single authority to support this alleged principle.

As for Mr. Montoya’s evidence, the Claimants submit that it is “not the role of an
annulment committee to decide which parts of the oral or written evidence a tribunal
should give emphasis to in its award’.*® They further explain that this evidence was

irrelevant to the claim of legitimate expectations.

The NextEra Entities conclude that this argument does not show a case of serious departure
from a fundamental rule of procedure and argue that Spain is trying to expand the scope of

annulment.5°°
G The Committee’s Analysis

The Committee examines whether the Tribunal’s decision pertaining to the Claimants’
alleged concealment of essential documents, the Tribunal’s practice at the hearing, the
Tribunal’s alleged lack of assessment of the evidence submitted, or the Tribunal’s decision
regarding the alternative but-for scenario amounted to a serious departure of fundamental

tules of procedure.

ICSID Arbitration Rule 34(1) stipulates that that “the Tribunal shall be the judge of the
admissibility of any evidence adduced and of its probative value”. The Committee observes
that a tribunal has considerable discretion in formulating its opinions about the relevance
and evaluation of the elements of evidence presented by the parties. It would require

exceptional circumstances for a tribunal’s opinions about the relevance and evaluation of

the elements of evidence to amount to a serious departure of fundamental rules of

procedure.

Other committees such as Wena Hotels v. Egypt have similarly declared that “[i]rrespective
whether the matter is one of substance or procedure, it is in the Tribunal’s discretion to
make its opinion about the relevance and evaluation of the elements of proof presented by
each Party”.>“' Tulip v. Turkey is also consistent with the Committee’s views when it stated
that “an applicant's dissatisfaction with the way a tribunal has exercised its discretion in
evaluating evidence cannot be a basis for a finding that there has been unequal

treatment” °°

The Committee first finds that a tribunal is entitled to a measure of discretion in its decision
on whether to order the disclosure of documents. The Committee notes that Spain has not
offered any case where a decision on document disclosure has served as the basis for

annulment by constituting a serious departure of a fundamental rule of procedure.

Although explained within the context of Art. 43(a) of the ICSID Convention, the
Committee finds the Azurix v. Argentina committee’s views persuasive where it stated that:
“[t]he extent to which the tribunal does call upon one party to produce documents at the
request of another party will always be a matter for the tribunal to determine in its

discretion” °® As further found in Azurix v. Argentina,

[t]o establish an annullable error, it is not sufficient to show that the
tribunal rejected repeated requests for the production of evidence
that the requesting party considered crucial to its case. Rather, it is
necessary to establish that, in all of the circumstances there has
been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.*”

The Committee considers that the Tribunal’s treatment and assessment of the evidence
concerning the Claimants’ alleged due diligence and privilege attached to certain

documents was within its discretion. The Tribunal had the “discretion to make its opinion

about the relevance and evaluation of the elements of proof’ concerning the assessment of

the due diligence and privilege.*”!

Furthermore, the Committee does not find that Spain has established that, had the
documents Spain requested been produced, it could have led to a “substantially different”

Award or it could have had a “material impact on the outcome” on the Award.

The Committee also finds that the Tribunal’s alleged lack of reference to the evidentiary
record does not constitute annullable grounds. The Committee finds that even if the
Tribunal chose not to refer to the evidentiary record, particularly regarding specific
testimony such as Mr. Carlos Montoya’s, this would be within the realm of its discretion
in weighing the evidence. Again, the Tribunal had the “discretion to make its opinion about
the relevance and evaluation of the elements of proof? that was presented during the

hearing.*””

Spain’s attempts to distinguish the present case from Tulip v. Turkey are not
convincing given that, as a general matter, whether a tribunal mentions any witnesses is
within its discretion. The Tribunal did mention the testimony of two of the Claimants’
witnesses. The Tribunal’s choice not to mention Spain’s only witness could not be deemed
as a failure of its “duty to respect the right to be heard of both parties in an equitable
manner”.>” Just because one witness was not mentioned does not mean that the witness’

testimony was not considered or that the right to be heard was violated.

The Committee similarly does not find Spain’s arguments persuasive concerning the
burden of proof and the Tribunal’s practices concerning the hearing. The Committee
considers that weighing the evidence and effect of a party’s failure to cross-examine a
witness is broadly within the province of a tribunal’s discretion. Spain cites Section 18.2
of PO1-A and the IBA Rules for the proposition that “a decision not to call a witness cannot
per se imply the assumption of correctness of his or her statement?.*™ Section 18.2
provides that “[i]f the appearance and/or examination of a witness has not been requested,

none of the parties shall be deemed to have (i) admitted any facts or opinions stated in the

witness statement or (ii) agreed to the correctness of the content of the witness
statement’.*° The Committee does not find this means that the Tribunal cannot take this
into consideration when weighing the evidence. It only means that a party will not be
deemed to have “admitted any facts or opinions” or “agreed to the correctness”. The
Tribunal is free to assess the weight of a witness’ testimony when it is not challenged. The
Tribunal’s consideration of the witness statements presented by the Claimants containing
various alleged statements made by the Spanish government officials and the consequences
of Spain’s choice not to challenge the witnesses were matters within the Tribunal’s

discretion.

The Tribunal’s alleged lack of assessment of the other evidence submitted appears based
on a lack of reference to the evidence and is similarly unpersuasive. The Tribunal’s
assessment of the various documentary evidence that Spain contends might have negated
any legitimate expectation was within its permissible discretion. The Tribunal had the
“discretion to make its opinion about the relevance and evaluation of the elements of proof”
concerning the assessment of the various forms of evidence.*”° The Tribunal was not
required to reference the “whole array of evidence[]” and not doing so did not mean they
did not “examine...key elements”.°”’ The Tribunal had the “discretion to make its opinion
about the relevance and evaluation of the elements of proof’ and could choose not to
mention evidence. A lack of reference to evidence does not necessarily mean a lack of its

assessment.

The Committee finds that Spain briefed the relevant issues through both written and oral
submissions and was given the opportunity to be heard. All in all, the Committee concludes
that the Tribunal’s decision pertaining to the Claimants’ alleged concealment of essential
documents, the Tribunal’s practice at the hearing, the Tribunal’s lack of reference to the
evidence submitted, or the Tribunal’s consideration of the alternative but-for scenario did

not constitute a serious departure of fundamental rules of procedure under Art. 52(1)(d).

(3) Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure by Breaching the
Principle of Congruence and Infringing the Right of Defense (Art. 52(1)(d))
(Annulment Ground (t))

a. Spain’s Position

Spain asserts a lack of congruence between the Claimants’ claims and the considerations
the Tribunal made to find liability. In terms of the Tribunal’s lack of congruence between
the Claimants’ claims and the Tribunal’s considerations to find liability, Spain submits that
the Tribunal found liability based on reasons not set forth by the Claimants and, as a result,

it could not defend itself properly.°”*

Spain submits that the Tribunal went beyond the facts that were “prefigured” and “on
which the debate between the parties [was] established”, and ruled on the “alleged factual
grounds which clearly deviate[d] from those which were the subject of the debate”.*” To
Spain, the Tribunal introduced “ex novo” and “invent[ed] an alternative theory different
from the one put forward” that Spain had no opportunity to defend against.**° The Tribunal
invented an alternative theory that was not based on the principle of reasonable returns as

argued by the Parties.

Spain also submits that the Tribunal’s “/ack of congruence” infringed its rights to be heard.
According to Spain, if “the Tribunal goes beyond the facts which are prefigured by the
Claim, and on which the debate between the parties has been established, and rules on
alleged factual grounds which clearly deviate from those which were the subject of the
debate, the right of the party to be heard is violated’.**'! Spain cites TECO v. Guatemala

and Caratube v. Kazakhstan as support for this principle.**”

b The NextEra Entities’ Position
The Claimants argue that there was no lack of congruence as Spain claims.

The Claimants submit that they briefed both the primary claim and alternative case with
respect to liability and quantum from the outset. For its primary claim, they anticipated
Spain’s position that the Claimants did not have a legitimate expectation to receive the

tariffs and premiums applicable under Regulatory Framework I.

They also made the alternative claim that they had a legitimate expectation to earn a
“reasonable return” on their investment.**? The Claimants’ quantum expert Compass
Lexecon used Regulatory Framework III for the primary claim and an adjusted Regulatory

Framework III for the alternative but-for claim.

The Claimants also submit that “Spain [has] not provided a single authority for the

‘principle of congruence’”.***

G The Committee’s Analysis

The Committee examines Spain’s claim that the Tribunal committed a serious departure
from a fundamental rule of procedure under Art. 52(1)(b) by breaching the principle of

congruence and infringing the right of defense.

At the outset, the Committee agrees with the Claimants’ point that the Applicant has not
provided any specific authority for the “principle of congruence” that it pleads. The
definition of the principle and its boundaries remain unclear. To the extent it may exist, the
Committee concludes that it falls within the principle of a right to be heard and will analyze

Spain’s application accordingly.

The Committee agrees that, as found in TECO v. Guatemala, a breach of Art. 52(1)(d)
could arise “when a tribunal effectively surprises the parties with an issue that neither

party has invoked, argued or reasonably could have anticipated during the proceedings.

In such a scenario, a reasonable question to ask is whether the parties’ right to be heard
has been seriously affected” .**° (emphasis added). As provided under TECO v. Guatemala,
two issues to consider are whether a party was “effectively surprised” and whether a party’s
rights were “seriously affected”. Other cases cited by the Parties such as Fraport v.
Philippines and Pey Casado v. Chile I, also confirm that a key element is whether a party
was afforded an opportunity to address the relevant matter.**° The present case differs from
TECO v. Guatemala, where a central legal concept (“unjust enrichment”) which served as

the basis for the tribunal’s decision was never raised before the parties.

Furthermore, the Committee agrees with the Caratube v. Kazakhstan committee that

provided:

Tribunals do not violate the parties’ right to be heard if they ground
their decision on legal reasoning not specifically advanced by the
parties, provided that the tribunal’s arguments can be fitted within
the legal framework argued during the procedure and therefore
concern aspects on which the parties could bly be expected
to comment, if they wished their views to be taken into account by
the tribunal”..°*’ (emphasis added).

 

The Committee does not find Spain could have been “effectively surprised” and instead
finds the Tribunal’s arguments “fitted within the legal framework argued during the
procedure and therefore concern[ed] aspects on which the parties could reasonably be
expected to comment”.>** The Committee finds that the Claimants’ primary claim and

alternative case with respect to liability and quantum “fit{ ] within the legal framework

argued during the procedure”. The central tenets of the alternative claim fit within the

same general legal framework of the primary claim.**

Contrary to Spain’s claims, the Committee considers that the Tribunal’s finding of a
legitimate expectation through the Claimants’ alternative claim did not constitute an
annullable ground under Art. 52(1)(d). The Tribunal found that the Claimants had a
legitimate expectation that Spain would honor its commitments in terms of regulatory
certainty, stability, and viability. The Committee does not find that the Tribunal “invented”
an alternative theory, and “effectively surprised” and denied Spain the opportunity to
defend itself. The Tribunal’s decision was within the framework and arguments presented
by the Parties concerning legitimate expectations and a right to a reasonable return on
actual sunk costs and actual cost of capital plus a margin. Spain was not denied a right to
be heard. After the Claimants raised the alternative theory, the Spain had the full
opportunity to respond and responded to the allegations that formed the basis of the

alternative case.*”

The Committee concludes that the Tribunal decided the case on liability within the
framework presented by the Parties. The Tribunal therefore did not infringe Spain’s right
to be heard and there was no serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure under

Art, 52(1)(d).

(4) Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure by Admitting an

Alleged Erroneous Translation (Art. 52(1)(d)) (Annulment Ground (u))
a. Spain’s Position

Spain’s raises the same issues concerning the translation of Exhibit C-006 as Annulment

Ground (v) in Section V.E(9), supra, but based on Art. 52(1(d) of ICSID Convention.
Spain claims the following:

As can be seen from the Award, the Tribunal bases the hypothetical
legitimate expectations on two simple letters from the Secretario de
Estado de Energia to the American company FLP (not to the
instrumental masks of the Claimants). The fact is that the translation
of one of these letters is blatantly erroneous, tending to change the
meaning of it and benefit the position of the Claimants. The
Kingdom of Spain considers that the result is identical to that of
falsehood and fraud.”
Spain explains that because the Award was based on a false document, it can be assumed

that the result of the arbitration could have been different.°””

A serious departure of a fundamental rule of procedure occurred because the Award relied

upon a false and fraudulent translation.
b The NextEra Entities’ Position

The NextEra Entities reiterate that Spain’s ground on annulment that relies upon the

allegedly incorrect translation has been waived under ICSID Arbitration Rule 27.5%
In any event, the NextEra Entities argue the following:

Spain’s revised translation would still be evidence of the Claimants’
legitimate expectations: Spain does not challenge the fact in this
letter that Secretary Marin informs Mitch Davidson of NextEra ‘that

the absolute vocation of said legislation is to preserve the legal

security of all investments currently underway’.>**
The NextEra Entities conclude by saying that even using Spain’s preferred translation, the
overall meaning of the letter would not be materially changed.** They also argue that the
translation was not incorrect.°°°
The Claimants contend that a serious departure of a fundamental rule of procedure did not

occur due to the translation of the Exhibit C-006.°””
G The Committee’s Analysis

The Committee examines whether the Tribunal committed a serious departure from a

fundamental rule of procedure concerning the translation issue for Exhibit C-006.

This ground overlaps with the Annulment Ground (v) in Section V.E(9), supra. The
Committee reiterates that Spain did not to object to the translation even though it was used
as an exhibit that was part of the Claimants’ Request for Arbitration in May 2014. Spain
did not challenge the translation until its closing argument on the last day of the underlying
arbitration hearing in December 2016. In response to the Claimants’ objection that the
Applicant belatedly raised the translation issue, the Applicant replied shortly thereafter that
“[t]he last point I wanted to talk about was the translation of the English word ‘forecast’
into Spanish. We don’t have anything to add to that. I apologise. I certainly don’t want to
reopen the debate, Mr President”.*** Spain never even requested a certified translation
through the procedure established for disputed translations under PO1-A. Spain apparently
did not raise the translation issue in any of its written post-hearing submissions, including
its 27 February 2017 Post-Hearing Submission or its 8 March 2017 Post-Hearing Reply.
Even after receiving the Tribunal’s Decision, which stated the Tribunal’s reliance upon the

exhibit, Spain did not raise any issues regarding the translation.

Under these circumstances, the Committee agrees with the Claimants that the Applicant
waived its right to challenge this procedural matter as provided under ICSID Arbitration
Rule 27 by not promptly objecting to it. Spain was aware of the document from the onset
of the arbitration. Spain’s awareness of the document is confirmed because it even raised
its own arguments based on the document. It never challenged the translation under the
procedures provided for in PO1-A. It raised the translation issue over two and a half years
after the document in question was submitted. This cannot be considered as “promptly”
objecting under ICSID Arbitration Rule 27. Furthermore, after raising the issue for the first
time, it appeared to withdraw its concern about the translation as a general matter by
stating, “[w]e don’t have anything to add to that [the translation of ‘forecast’ ]. I apologise.
I certainly don’t want to reopen the debate”.*® It did not mention any issue with the tense
used in the translation and it did not make any reservations when withdrawing its concerns.
Thereafter, the Applicant never raised the issue even after receiving the Decision that relied

upon the exhibit.

The Committee holds that the dispute concerning a translation of a document, particularly
one that existed from the beginning of a proceeding, was a procedural matter concerning a
“rule[ ]...applicable to the proceeding” under ICSID Arbitration Rule 27. The Applicant
waived any basis to present its Application based on the translation issue because it

“failled] to state promptly its objection” pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 27.

Hence, Spain waived its rights to bring a claim on this basis and the Tribunal’s use of the

translation did not constitute a serious departure of a fundamental rules of procedure.

qd) Waiver of the Grounds for Annulment (ICSID Arbitration Rule 27)

483. The NextEra Entities continue by asserting that ICSID ad hoc committees have concurred
on two basic principles: (i) ICSID Arbitration Rule 27 applies to annulment proceedings;
and (ii) the rule prevents a party from raising as ground for annulment something that it

failed to object promptly before the tribunal if it had an opportunity to do so.°°!

484. The NextEra Entities rely on Lemire v. Ukraine where the committee held that Ukraine’s
right to claim the annulment of the decision on jurisdiction and liability were waived in

light of ICSID Arbitration Rule 27.
485. The Lemire v. Ukraine committee explained that:

the waiver provided by Arbitration Rule 27 applies to the case at
hand on the basis that Respondent knew or should have known about
such violations since the moment the Decision on Jurisdiction and
Liability was issued on January 14, 2010. Consequently,
Respondent should have objected to such violations and should have
reserved its rights to claim these objections in a subsequent
annulment proceeding. There was no reason for Respondent to
remain silent and wait until the Award was issued to object to the
terms and content of the first decision. Respondent’s silence
amounts to a waiver of its rights to object to the Decision on
Jurisdiction and Liability at the present stage.”

486. Among other things, “Spain chose not to raise its current complaints with the Tribunal
throughout the period of almost three months (80 days, to be more precise) between the

Decision and the final Award”.

As a result, the NextEra Entities argue that because Spain failed to act promptly it waived

most of the grounds on which it now seeks to annul the Award.
db. Spain’s Position

Spain claims that the NextEra Entities are trying to apply ICSID Arbitration Rule 27 not
only to procedural grounds for annulment but also to other grounds such as a manifest
excess of powers and failure to state reasons. In this regard, Spain states that such
interpretation is contrary to the wording and purpose of the provision and must be

rejected.°*

Spain explains that ICSID Arbitration Rule 27 is applicable to those cases in which there
was an opportunity, during the proceedings, to use the mechanisms provided for purging

them.°°5

Spain also cites Pey Casado v. Chile I for the view that “ ‘waiver’ can only be triggered if
the applicant knew that the tribunal by its conduct had not complied with the rule and thus
had a reasonable opportunity to raise its objection. If the objecting party acquired actual
or constructive knowledge of a rule violation only after the award has become available,

it cannot be considered as having waived its right to object”.

According to Spain, due to the nature of the mistakes in the Award, the annulment

proceeding was the only available procedural mechanism.°”
G The Committee’s Analysis

In light of its rulings above, the Committee exercises its procedural economy and decides

it is not necessary to render a separate decision on this issue.

H. RESIDUAL DISCRETION

qd) Residual Discretion of ad hoc Committees (Art. 52(3) of the ICSID

Convention)
a. The NextEra Entities’ Position

493. The NextEra Entities hold that Art. 52(3) of the ICSID Convention entrusts an ad hoc
committee with the authority and not the obligation to annul an award. In this regard, they

highlight that:

This is borne out by the plain wording of Art. 52(3), which provides
that a committee ‘shall have the authority to annul the award’. It
does not say ‘shall annul the award ’.°°*

494. The NextEra Entities say:

For the reasons explained in this Counter-Memorial, Spain has
failed to establish any of the Art. 52(1) grounds of annulment.
However, if the Committee considers that Spain has established a
possible ground for annulment, NextEra respectfully requests the
Committee exercise its discretion to deny Spain’s Annulment
Application and uphold the Award in full.°”

495. Finally, the NextEra Entities point out that regarding this discretion the Committee should
follow the factors mentioned in CEAC v. Montenegro. In exercising its discretion, the

Committee should consider as follows:

[the] gravity of the relevant issue and its impact on the Award; the
impact on each party that annulment would produce; the length of
the proceeding, which began in 2014; the costs for both sides of a
resubmitted dispute; the undisputed commitments that Spain
provided to NextEra in this case; and the importance of the finality
of the Award in the ICSID system.°!°

db. Spain’s Position
Spain argues that:

The ICSID Convention does not provide that ad hoc annulment

committees have ‘discretion’ to refuse to annul an award once it is

determined that there are grounds for annulment. Nor does the

drafting history of the ICSID Convention support that position.°"'
Spain relies on K/éckner v. Cameroon, Pey Casado v. Chile I, and Eiser v. Spain, where
committees held that if there are grounds for annulment, then the award should be annulled

without the committee having any discretion.°!”
G The Committee’s Analysis

The Committee finds that Art. 52(3) of the ICSID Convention must be interpreted based
upon the ordinary meaning as provided under the Vienna Convention. The plain wording
of Art. 52(3) provides that a committee “shall have the authority to annul the award”. It
does not say “shall annul the award”. This suggests that a committee has “the authority”
to determine whether or not to annul an award based upon its discretion. The discretion of
committees is well-established. As the Pey Casado v. Chile IJ committee found in 2020,
“the Committee agrees with the position of the CEAC committee, which is itself in line with
well-established case law, that committees should not automatically declare an award
annulled if one of the grounds for annulment is present”.°'? As described by Professor
Schreuer, committees no longer adopt the “hair trigger’ standard of automatically

annulling awards.°!*

499. The Committee agrees that the discretion should be subject to reasonable limits and that
various factors should be taken into consideration when exercising this discretion. As listed
in Pey Casado v. Chile II, factors to be considered include “the gravity of the circumstances
which constitute the ground for annulment’, and, “whether they had — or could have had —
a material effect upon the outcome of the case”.°'> CEAC v. Montenegro also cites (1) “the
importance of the finality of the award” and (2) “the overall question of fairness to both

Parties” .°'%

500. In light of its rulings above that Spain has not established any grounds for annulment, the

Committee decides it is not necessary to render a separate decision on this issue.

VI. COSTS

A. SPAIN’S COST SUBMISSIONS

501. In its submission on costs, the Applicant requests that the Claimants be ordered to pay the
total costs of the arbitration proceeding and the legal fees and expenses incurred by the

Applicant, amounting to EUR 2,014,749.04°!’, broken down as follows:

 

 

 

 

ICSID Fees and Advance Payments EUR 497,742.25°!8

EUR 572,275.79 (USD 650,000). The Committee observes, however, ICSID has not made any reimbursements out
of the advance payments concerning the annulment proceeding.

It asserts that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction to hear the dispute and that the Claimants
should be responsible for the costs Spain incurred as they decided to initiate the dispute.
Furthermore, according to Spain, the Claimants should bear the costs since they “filed a
conscious false translation that led the Tribunal to an erroneous holding’, and they “got

access to a privileged subsidies framework due to a false statement that made them go to

Spain notes that its costs are “reasonable in light of the complexity and duration of the

case” 5

Spain further requests that the Claimants should pay “post-award interest on the foregoing
sums, at a compound rate of interest to be determined by the Committee until the date of

full satisfaction of the Committee’s decision” °°

Finally, Spain reserves its right to submit “additional arguments in accordance with the
ICSID Rules and the instructions of the ad hoc Committee for the purpose of responding

to the allegations made by the Respondent on Annulment”.

THE NEXTERA ENTITIES’ COST SUBMISSIONS

In its submissions on costs, the Claimants submit that the Applicant should bear all the
costs, fees, and expenses of these annulment proceedings and reimburse the Claimants’
attorneys’ fees, expert fees, and other disbursements for a total amount of

510. Inaddition, the Claimants request interests for the fees and disbursements (specified in the

previous paragraph), from the date of the Committee’s Decision on Annulment until the

date of payment at the same interest rate specified in the Award. °°?

511. The Claimants also argue that Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention extends to ICSID ad
hoc committees. They cite that “both sides have claimed that costs should be awarded to
them as the prevailing party”.°° They note that “[p]rior annulment committees have
attached importance to any such common position. Article 61(2) also expressly recognises
the deference that should be given to any party agreement on costs”.°! They advocate the

‘cost follows the event’ approach should be followed as it is “well-settled in ICSID

arbitration” 6?

512. While a party has a right to seek annulment, such right should not be “consequence-
free”. They assert that “[t]he applicant for annulment is the only party that stands to
gain from filing an annulment application. If the applicant prevails, it reaps a substantial

benefit by annulling the award. If the applicant loses, the respondent on annulment gains

nothing new”.6*4

513. They argue that the cost-follows-event principle is “especially relevant here, where Spain

raised 22 claims for annulment (which may be a record number in ICSID arbitration)” .°*

They emphasize that “Spain should bear the cost consequences that flow from its ‘kitchen

sink” approach.**° They add that even if Spain were to prevail on any one of its 22 claims,

the principle should still warrant awarding them almost all of their costs because they

would have prevailed on the other 21 claims.**’ In addition to the number of claims, the
Claimants argue that the following factors increased costs: (1) Spain’s re-litigation of
issues beyond the limits of annulment review, including a considerable number of new
arguments and authorities; (2) the Parties’ diverging views on waiver; (3) Spain’s

arguments based on alleged omission; and (4) Spain’s lengthy use of expert evidence.**

The Claimants assert that it should be able to claim costs for the numerous procedural
applications that Spain lost. This includes Spain’s request for a stay of enforcement, two
requests for new expert evidence, invocation of criminal law, and application for expert
testimony. The Claimants also claimed supplemental costs incurred for responding to
Spain’s application to introduce the Moldova v. Komstroy judgment into the record,
commenting on that judgment after its admission into the record, and responding to Spain’s

application to reopen these proceedings.**

They also cite various “recent committees” have awarded attorney’s fees as part of the
“recent trend in ICSID annulment proceedings towards a ‘cost follows the event
approach’”.° They argue that the “allocation of attorneys’ fees supplements the well-
accepted principle that the costs of the annulment proceeding itself (such as the fees of the
committee members) should be borne by the unsuccessful applicant, ‘unless there are

exceptional circumstances which warrant an alternative allocation’”.©*!

The Claimants assert that their costs are reasonable and commensurate with the number of
claims that Spain raised in this annulment proceeding. They add that their costs are

“consistent with the costs incurred by both Spain and the investor in the Eiser annulment

proceeding (which is the closest comparator because it is the only other Spanish ECT
award that has reached a decision on annulment thus far)”. They cite that Eiser v. Spain
involved far fewer claims but that Eiser claimed approximately USD 2.9 million in
attorney’s fees and approximately USD 235,000 in disbursements, which amounted to 2%
of the Eiser v. Spain award’s value. They highlight that their legal costs is commensurate

with the value of the Award and amounts to 1% of the sums owed.“

They cite that they anticipate that Spain’s legal costs will be lower because its State
Attorney’s Office is handling the case and many of its arguments have been raised in other
ECT cases, which allows it to spread its costs.“* In contrast, the Claimant’s counsel is not
acting for any other investors against Spain, which does not allow it to similarly spread

costs.°5

THE COMMITTEE’ S DECISION ON COSTS
Art. 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:

In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as
the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the
parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how
and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members
of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the
Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.

 

ICSID Arbitration Rule 47(1)(j) provides that an award shall contain “any decision of the

Tribunal regarding the cost of the proceeding”.

Art. 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 47(1)(j) (applied by virtue of
Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 53) give an ad hoc committee
discretion to allocate the costs of the proceeding, including attorneys’ fees and other costs,

between the Parties as it deems appropriate. The Committee notes that Regulation 14(3)(e)

of the ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations also recognizes the committee’s

discretion to allocate the costs of annulment proceedings.

In exercise of its discretion, the Committee considers that the “costs should follow the
event” principle should apply. An important factor for the Committee to follow this
principle is that both Parties agree with its application. Both Parties claim recovery of their
costs based on their position prevailing in the case. The Committee further notes the recent
practice of committees following this principle.“ The Committee agrees with CEAC v
Montenegro that the costs should be borne by the unsuccessful applicant unless there are

“exceptional circumstances which warrant an alternative allocation” .“"

In view that the Application did not succeed Spain should therefore bear the entire costs of
the proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the Members of the Committee. The
Committee sees no exceptional circumstances that would warrant a different allocation of

costs.

The costs of the proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the Committee, ICSID’s

administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):

The above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Applicant pursuant to

Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(e).°*

In terms of legal fees and other expenses, the Committee finds that the same principle
should apply and the costs should be borne by the unsuccessful Applicant. In applying the
principle, the Committee takes into consideration the relative success of the Parties’
submissions, the particular circumstances of the case, reasonableness of fees and expenses

claimed, and the conduct of the Parties.
The Committee first notes that Spain’s Application was denied in its entirety.

In terms of the circumstances of the case, Spain raised 22 claims in its Application, all of
which were denied in their entirety. Similarly, it did not prevail in most of the procedural
applications made during the course of the proceedings, including the request for stay of
enforcement, several applications to submit new evidence, and an application to reopen the
proceedings. The Committee does not find any exceptional circumstances that would

warrant a different allocation.

Given the complexity of the case and the issues argued, the Claimants’ attorneys’ fees and
other expenses such as translations, experts’ fees, and miscellaneous fees seem reasonable.
The Committee, however, observes that the “Trial graphics consultant fee” substantially

surpasses even the expert’s fees of Prof. Eeckhout and finds it excessive.

The Committee extends its appreciation to both Parties for having conducted themselves
in a professional and cooperative manner and considers that neither can be faulted for
causing any unwarranted delays. The Committee does not find that either Party committed

any misconduct during the annulment proceedings.

Accordingly, taking these factors into consideration, the Committee orders the Applicant
to cover USD 3,500,000 of the Claimants’ legal fees and other expenses (out of the total
amount of USD 3,529,855.95 claimed).

8 The remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Applicant.

531. |The Committee finds that, in the normal course of business, interest should accrue for sums
due until payment is made. The Committee notes that Spain requests post-Decision interest
at a compound rate to be determined by the Committee. The Respondent requests the same
interest rate specified in the Award (i.e. 0.234% compounded monthly). Both Parties

requested post-Decision compound interest.

532. The Committee considers appropriate to apply the same interest rate granted in the Award.
Accordingly, Spain shall pay interests on the amount determined in this Decision, at the
rate of 0.234% compounded monthly, starting 30 days after the date of the Decision until

the date of payment.
